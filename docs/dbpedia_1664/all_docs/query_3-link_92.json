        "text": "Carlos Alcaraz defeated Alexander Zverev to win the French Open for the first time and lift a third grand slam title at the age of just 21. The Spaniard became the youngest player in tennis history to win grand slam titles on all three surfaces and defeated the German fourth seed in an epic five-set thriller at Roland Garros, battling from behind to win 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 6-2 in four hours and 19 minutes.\n\nIn what was the first French Open men’s final without either Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer since 2004, Alcaraz held his nerve to defy defeat and he produced a stunning series of passing shots in his comeback. The third seed took a medical timeout in the fourth set but prevailed to extend his perfect record in grand slam finals to three wins from his first three appearances.\n\nAlcaraz, who had previously won the US Open and Wimbledon, is now an Australian Open title away from completing the career grand slam. Meanwhile, Zverev missed the chance to win his first grand slam title, with the 27-year-old losing the US Open final from two sets up against Dominic Thiem in 2020. The German was a set from glory before Alcaraz produced a stunning escape to win the title.\n\nFollow all the latest tennis scores and results from the final day at the French Open below.\n\nFrench Open LIVE: Alcaraz faces Zverev in men’s final - latest updates\n\nCarlos Alcaraz defeats Alexander Zverev in French Open men’s final\n\n5th SET!

At the US Open it was all unexpected, at Wimbledon he was playing for everything to win and nothing to lose against the greatest player in our game in Novak Djokovic. I don’t think anyone thought he would win against Djokovic.\n\n“Here, he wins from two sets to one down and he wins easily in the fourth and fifth.

This tournament I wanted to win since five, six years old. It’s great for me, a team come true. I’ll enjoy it with my team.\n\n“When I finished the third I had a lot of doubts, I’m not going to lie. I thought my shots didn’t trouble Sacha. He was dominating with his serve and it was difficult for me. With the nerves, I didn’t play my best tennis, but it’s the final of a grand slam! It was the time to find solutions, to give everything, and of course in the fourth set getting to 4-0 helped me out a lot.\n\n“[The conditions] were difficult. Sacha was playing great tennis, he put a lot of pressure on his serves and he got a lot of returns in. I had to save a lot of break points. The fifth set was 6-2 but I could have lost the fifth set, it was close. It was tricky with the wind, the sun. We know we have to win a way and adapt. I’m really happy to do it today.\n\n“Another tattoo, yes, it’ll be soon!”\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz defeats Alexander Zverev to claim third Grand Slam title\n\n19:16 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nThree finals, three surfaces, three grand slam titles!\n\nCarlos Alcaraz is incredible.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz defeats Alexander Zverev to claim third Grand Slam title\n\n19:07 , Mike Jones\n\nMore from Alcaraz: “I have loved to have part of my family here.

Everything you have been through the last years in this court. I’m pretty sure you will win Slams and this tournament very, very soon so keep going and congratulations.\n\n“My team have been incredible the last month. We were struggling a lot with the injury. Coming back from Madrid, I didn’t feel well. Coming here and not practicing too much on the court. I’m grateful to have the team that I have. I know everyone in my team is giving their heart to help me improve.

You’ve won three different ones, you are already a hall-of-famer, you have won so much and you’re only 21. An incredible player and not the last time you are going to win this.\n\n“To the [Alcaraz] team, well done. I wish I could say otherwise, but too good today. All of you are unbelievably nice guys so I’m happy for you. Not today, but generally I am happy for you.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz defeats Alexander Zverev to claim third Grand Slam title\n\n18:54 , Mike Jones\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz defeats Alexander Zverev to claim third Grand Slam title\n\n18:51 , Mike Jones\n\nAnd now it’s the turn of the French Open winner, Carlos Alcaraz.

Alexander Zverev has had a painful wait, he’s fallen short at the final hurdle once again in his pursuit of a first Grand Slam title but he gave his all.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the rising star of men’s tennis, was just too good on the day.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz defeats Alexander Zverev 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 6-2 to claim third Grand Slam title\n\n18:38 , Mike Jones\n\nCarlos Alcaraz is the first men’s player in the Open era to win his first three Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces following his victories at the US Open and Wimbledon.\n\nWhat a player.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz defeats Alexander Zverev 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 6-2 to claim third Grand Slam title\n\n18:34 , Mike Jones\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 6-2 Alexander Zverev\n\n18:32 , Mike Jones\n\nHere we go then.\n\nAlcaraz starts off with a fine serve that Zverev gets back well. The Spaniard edges further and further into the court and crunches a series of backhands back at his opponent who eventually drills one into the net.\n\nZverev digs in though and takes the next point before Alcaraz moves back into the lead with a sidespinning drop shot. Zverev manages to get to the ball but flicks it wide. 30-15.\n\nHe’s one away! Zverev curls a forehand too long to give Alcaraz two chances at winning the Championship...\n\n... there it is! Zverev goes into the net, Alcaraz drops to the floor and the French Open title is his. Game, set and match!\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 5-2 Alexander Zverev - BREAK!\n\n18:26 , Mike Jones\n\nHe only needs one! Carlos Alcaraz breaks and will now be serving for the Championship.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 4-2 Alexander Zverev*\n\n18:25 , Mike Jones\n\nWill Carlos Alcaraz go after Alexander Zverev and try to break again?\n\nYes. By the looks of the opening two rallies which both go the way of the Spaniard. He punishes every forehand that he gets and outpowers the German to move 0-30 up.\n\nOh wow! Zverev comes up to the net and meets the ball on the volley. Alcaraz darts across the court and whips a backhand, the ball clips the tape and drops in play!\n\nThree break points to come.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 4-2 Alexander Zverev*\n\n18:21 , Mike Jones\n\nZverev sets himself up with a break point but Alcaraz serves and volleys next up to bring him back to deuce. Alcaraz puts one too long to give up a break point but Zverev hits the net.\n\nThe Spaniard goes up to advantage and wins the game as Zverev slices a forehand into the net again.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 3-2 Alexander Zverev\n\n18:17 , Mike Jones\n\nAlcaraz doesn’t unleash fully on a smash but Zverev’s return goes long. The Spaniard then puts down and error of his own with a wild forehand.\n\nTwo smash winners, one for each player, bring the game up to 30-30. Alcaraz trying to hold, Zverev desperately searching for a break.\n\nThe Spaniard takes the next point with an accurate serve and forehand follow up. But, a miscued backhand lands in the net and Zverev gets to deuce.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 3-2 Alexander Zverev\n\n18:12 , Mike Jones\n\nZverev holds! He saves another break point and flies through the next two points to keep his hopes of lifting the trophy going.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 3-1 Alexander Zverev*\n\n18:11 , Mike Jones\n\nThe only thing Zverev can do now is hold his own serve. He needs to keep chipping away at this set and hopefully edge the momentum his way.\n\nFrom 40-15 an few errors and another double fault bring the game to deuce before Alcaraz nails a passing winner to set up another break point.\n\nThis could be the deciding rally of the final. Zverev serves out wide but Alcaraz gets back the return only for the German to land an acute backhand across court. Back to deuce.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 3-1 Alexander Zverev*\n\n18:04 , Mike Jones\n\nWhat a rally! Alexander Zverev comes up to the net early to try and close out the rally but never takes on a proper smash. Instead he looks to work Alcaraz around the court but the Spaniard repeatedly tracks down the ball. Eventually Zverev gets the winner but his lead doesn’t last long as Alcaraz serves out wide and forces an error from the German.\n\nBang! Zverev looks to dominate but Alcaraz has other ideas. He’s off balance but decides to come down the line with a brilliant backhand that brings him close to holding.\n\nHe does hold! From 0-40 down, the Spaniard manages to move ahead in the set and he completes the break of serve.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 2-1 Alexander Zverev\n\n18:00 , Mike Jones\n\nZverev’s last service was full of mistakes and Alcaraz has started his own service game with a couple of errors too. An attempted drop shot clips the tape and doesn’t drop moving his opponent 0-30 ahead.\n\nWow. Alcaraz wrestles his way into a winning position and has the simplest of forehand winners to get on the board. Instead his pushes it wide and leaves Zverev with three break points.\n\nAlcaraz saves one with a fine forehand winner. A disputed second serve is called in which annoys Zverev who is feeling the pressure. He’ll be more aggrieved after sending a backhand out of play.\n\nAlcaraz then finds the baseline and the game goes to deuce! What defence.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 2-1 Alexander Zverev - BREAK!\n\n17:52 , Mike Jones\n\nAlexander Zverev is under a lot of pressure. A couple of errors from the German and a double fault leave the Spaniard with three break points.\n\nHe punts one of them too long but then claims the break. Zverev then pings one over the back and gifts the break to his opponent. Alcaraz draws first blood in the final set. Can he hold serve now to complete the break?\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 1-1 Alexander Zverev*\n\n17:48 , Mike Jones\n\nOh my! Neither man is holding back here and both are taking on difficult shots. Zverev comes up to the net and is met with a dipping forehand. He attempts to volley across court but gets it wrong and spoons the ball out of play.\n\nAnother mistake from the German gives Alcaraz two attempts to close out the game and he misses the first one. A long, long rally gets both men dancing around the court before setting up an opportunity for a cross court forehand, Alcaraz puts it into the net.\n\nThe next attempt is better, he serves wide and Zverev returns into the net.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 0-1 Alexander Zverev\n\n17:43 , Mike Jones\n\nThis match has been going on for three hours and 26 minutes already and will be decided in this fifth set. Alexander Zverev has the opening serve and will want to start well having only won on game in the previous set.\n\nHe takes the first point with a blazing backhand winner before flicking over a drop shot volley. Carlos Alcaraz sprints up the court and gets to the ball but doesn’t have the space to get over the return.\n\nPerhaps there’s a sign of nerves as Zverev double faults but his next effort is perfect out wide to Alcaraz’s backhand. The German completes his hold with a smash winner.\n\nOver to Alcaraz.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 Alexander Zverev*\n\n17:36 , Mike Jones\n\nYes he can!\n\nneeds to work to save another break point but an ace, his first since the third set, takes him up to set point. Zverev lands one in the net and that’s that.\n\nThe French Open men’s final will be decided in a final set!\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 5-1 Alexander Zverev\n\n17:33 , Mike Jones\n\nAlcaraz had a chance to serve out the third set and messed it up. He looks to be on a similar course after a driving backhand from Zverev takes the German 0-30 up.\n\nZverev then misses only for Alcaraz to blaze a forehand into the net and leave him with two break points. The Spaniard saves one with a solid return wide to the backhand forcing Zverev to pump his effort wide down the line.\n\nAnother miss, this one trying to go across court with a forehand, brings Alcaraz back to deuce. Can he close out the set?\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 5-1 Alexander Zverev\n\n17:29 , Mike Jones\n\nCarlos Alcaraz has called for a medical timeout with the physio working on the left leg giving his a vigorous rub down.\n\nThe Spaniard jogs back onto court with renewed purpose and helps to force an error out of Alexander Zverev who floats a forehand wide. Then it’s Alcaraz’s turn to mishit one and give away a point, 15-15.\n\nOh wow! Both players trade blows and points before a lob from Alcaraz lands on the back of the court, just in play. Zverev sprints back for it then fizzes a backhand out of play.\n\nAlcaraz fails to take advantage of his break point and the German forces his way to deuce. The deciding factor is a missed cross court backhand from Zverev which sets up another break point for Alcaraz who takes it this time and moves within one game of winning the fourth set.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 4-1 Alexander Zverev*\n\n17:19 , Mike Jones\n\nThis final and its momentum has swing on a pendulum repeatedly. At the start of this game it was firmly leaning towards Alcaraz but Zverev has wrestled it back!\n\nIt was a poor outing from the Spaniard who was outworked and out hit by his opponent who recovers a break. Alcaraz is still the heavy favourite to take the fourth set but Zverev now has a foothold.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 4-0 Alexander Zverev\n\n17:15 , Mike Jones\n\nAlcaraz looks to have really turned up the heat and edges into the lead in the next game, this one being served up by Zverev. The Spaniard should take the next point too but is a little wayward with a backhand and just sends it out of play on the right side.\n\nHowever, he makes full use of Zverev coming up to the net and laces a top spinner across court that dips on the German forcing him to miss the ball.\n\nZverev comes back at him though with a couple of powerful hits. A floaty return from Alcaraz provides plenty of time for Zverev to pick a spot and he drills a forehand down the line to draw level at 30-30.\n\nA double fault sets Alcaraz up with a break point and he secures it with a brilliant backhand drop shot!\n\nWhat a performance in this set from Alcaraz so far.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 3-0 Alexander Zverev*\n\n17:09 , Mike Jones\n\nCarlos Alcaraz has woken up again. He’s won 11 of the last 14 points and moves to 40-0 with a blistering backhand across the court. A mistake from Zverev brings Alcaraz a hold to love and he moves three games ahead in the fourth set.\n\nIf he holds serve each time he’ll win the fourth and draw back level.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 2-0 Alexander Zverev - BREAK!\n\n17:07 , Mike Jones\n\nOh yes! After sending one too long to give Alcaraz the first points of his service game, Zverev switches up forehand and backhand play whilst, mainly, trying to keep the ball flat.\n\nHe makes Alcaraz run before coming up to the net and landing a winner volley. In the next rally, Alcaraz lunges to reach a low ball and manages to lob it over Zverev. The German can take on the smash but decides to leave it and the ball lands in play!\n\n15-30.\n\nZverev is then unnerved as he drills a cross court forehand close to the sideline. The call of ‘out’ comes quite late but the umpire checks the court and agrees. Alcaraz has two break points.\n\nHe saves the first one as a backhand return from the Spaniard lands long. Zverev goes down the centre from a second serve next up and moves up to the net.\n\nHe volleys back at Alcaraz who sweeps to the right and whips a curling forehand around his opponent and lands it right on the line! He breaks!\n\nThat is a superb shot.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 1-0 Alexander Zverev*\n\n17:00 , Mike Jones\n\nAlexander Zverev has the advantage in this final now. He’s only one set away from the title and knows that Carlos Alcaraz cannot mess up from here.\n\nThe Spaniard doesn’t. An incredibly backhand from him fizzes the ball over the top of the net to take him to a comfortable 40-15 lead in the opening game of the fourth.\n\nAlcaraz is bouncing around and forces an error from Zverev to hold serve.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 0-0 Alexander Zverev\n\n16:56 , Mike Jones\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-7 Alexander Zverev - SET!\n\n16:54 , Mike Jones\n\nAlcaraz latches onto a drop shot to set up a break point but Zverev manages to save it in the next rally. He then comes up to the net, hits a fine backhand volley before winning the point with a brilliant smash.\n\nHis second attempt at closing out this set sees him miss his first serve once again. The next one goes to Alcaraz’s backhand and a long rally builds up.\n\nZverev starts to get the upper hand forces Alcaraz into a couple of loopy returns. He crunches a cross court forehand to Alcaraz’s right but the Spaniard can’t return the ball and the set goes to the German!\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-6 Alexander Zverev*\n\n16:49 , Mike Jones\n\nCarlos Alcaraz looks a little rattled. He’s complaining about the lack of clay on the court and tells the umpire ‘it’s like a hard court.’ That’s just frustration boiling over for the Spaniard.\n\nAlexander Zverev begins the next rally with a wonder serve and volley. He seems very confident now.\n\nThe German is gifted the next point too as Alcaraz continues to struggle to return the serve. Zverev gets drawn into a lengthy rally next up before being forced wide to the right. He looks to slice a stretching forehand back but doesn’t catch it right and Alcaraz gets a point on the board. 30-15.\n\nThe Spaniard starts to dictate. He repeatedly drills his shots at Zverev’s backhand and the German runs out of patience. He looks to go down the line and sends one wide.\n\nThat doesn’t bother him though as his next serve is exceptional! It lands right on the side line of the box and flies wide of Alcaraz’s racquet for an ace.\n\nOn set point, Zverev faults first up before serving to middle. Alcaraz defends with a couple of high shots before the rally develops into a backhand battle. The Spaniard wins it and brings the game to deuce.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-6 Alexander Zverev* - BREAK!\n\n16:42 , Mike Jones\n\nAlcaraz is looking to stop the onslaught from Zverev who has won the last three games. The Spaniard goes behind from his firs serve but follows up with a dainty drop shot that his opponent gives up.\n\nZverev attempts the same thing in the next rally but doesn’t execute it well. The ball bounces kindly for Alcaraz who slices a forehand too long! 15-30.\n\nPressure! Zverev is the one dictating the rallies and peppers Alcaraz with a few strong backhands. The Spaniard looks to switch to a forehand but spoons the ball wide. Two break points for Zverev here...\n\n... He only needs one! Zverev will serve to win the third set. What a turnaround.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-5 Alexander Zverev\n\n16:37 , Mike Jones\n\nAlcaraz still has the chance to close out the set but will need to break the German here in this game. He shuffles around the court and prepares for the first serve.\n\nZverev sends it to the forehand and wins the point as Alcaraz’s return loops over the back of court. The German increases his lead after Alcaraz attempts to unleash on a second serve. He goes for it early but gets the angle wrong and scuffs the ball out of play.\n\nThe next point is won with an ace and Zverev secures the hold to love with ease. All square.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-4 Alexander Zverev*\n\n16:34 , Mike Jones\n\nLovely stuff! The pressure is now on Alcaraz who goes for accuracy over power and pays the price. Zverev sprints across court to meet the shot and hooks in back into play before the Spaniard mishits a half-volley.\n\nZverev moves 0-30 up with a powerful return of serve before missing out on a very gettable backhand down the line.\n\nThe German then errs again with a wild forehand that smokes the ball well over the back of court and Alcaraz is back on level terms trying to close out the third set.\n\nBreak point! Alcaraz knocks one too long and will have to defend another break point. Can he do it?\n\nNo! Alcaraz goes up to the net but is met with a powerful backhand by Zverev. He throws himself towards the ball but can’t reach it and his opponent is back in this set.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-3 Alexander Zverev\n\n16:29 , Mike Jones\n\nZverev finds himself needing to hold serve just to stay in this third set. He starts off with a sublime wide serve ace that beats Alcaraz for pace.\n\nNext up he misses his first serve down the middle and a rally ensues. Alcaraz pushes him deep before delicately flicking a forehand over the net to wrongfoot his opponent. 15-15.\n\nA miscue from the German puts Alcaraz into the lead as he scuffs a shot into the net before following up with a decent first serve that his opponent fails to get back. 30-30.\n\nFrom here Zverev does the business. He’s aided by an error from Alcaraz before closing out the game with an ace.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 5-2 Alexander Zverev*\n\n16:24 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nIncredible forehand attack from Alcaraz, as he comes into the net and puts away the smash.\n\nGame point: Alcaraz drops and Zverev hits the net!\n\nThree break points saved and he moves a game away!\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 4-2 Alexander Zverev*\n\n16:23 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nWow. Alcaraz looked to have turned this set after getting the first two points on serve, only for Zverev to come roaring back himself. He finds depth to push Alcaraz back, and swat away the smash.\n\nA break point for the German: but he keeps his head and finds two baselines in a row, as Zverev’s backhand misfires!\n\nDeuce. Double fault from Alcaraz! Zverev will have another break point. Big first serve from Alcaraz down the middle, then the smash!\n\nThe roof may come off if he holds serve here: but Alcaraz swing wildly at the forehand and gives Zverev another chance!\n\nDrop shot from Alcaraz on break point! Steel from Alcaraz, Zverev reaches it, but Alcaraz finds the backhand pass!\n\nDEUCE.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 4-2 Alexander Zverev - BREAK!\n\n16:15 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nOh now! Alcaraz stops the run of points against Zverev’s serve, and finds the moment to strike! Zverev suddenly becomes hesistant, as Alcaraz goes on the attack!\n\nHe flashes a backhand drive down the line and gets a look at three break points: INCREDIBLE! Alcaraz pings the backhand onto Zverev’s feet and the German swings at the backhand and shanks it out!\n\nThat came from nowhere!\n\nThat’s huge: Alcaraz sensed his moment after Zverev slipped at the baseline on the opening point, and Zverev not being able to reach the short return. Zverev couldn’t find a first serve and Alcaraz attacked on the forehand side, before putting away the smash.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 3-2 Alexander Zverev*\n\n16:11 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAnother pressure point for Alcaraz to face at 15-15, but he whips a backhand winner down the line as Zverev closed the net. And that’s more like it! A stunning reverse drop-shot from Alcaraz.\n\nBut Zverev drags himself back, hanging on. He closes the net and Alcaraz can only stretch at the at the volley.\n\nAlcaraz is feeling the tension: he switches to serve and volley, and pops the overhead into the open court.\n\nAlcaraz yells again! He’s willing himself into this and roars as he thrashes the forehand winner down the line.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 2-2 Alexander Zverev\n\n16:06 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAlcaraz can’t touch Zverev’s serve right now. The German holds to love for the second game in a row to start the third set.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 2-1 Alexander Zverev*\n\n16:02 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAlcaraz roars behind the forehand winner hit down the line! The Spaniard emerges from a tricky game that coughed up another double fault, but that forehand winner was more like it.\n\nAlcaraz yells out as he returns to his chair.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 1-1 Alexander Zverev\n\n15:59 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nZverev is so solid from the baseline right now, to add to that big first serve and strike from inside the line. He holds the love and is putting together a huge run of points.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 1-0 Alexander Zverev*\n\n15:55 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAlcaraz led 2-1 in the second set before Zverev won five games in a row to level the match: the Spaniard needs a hold of serve here.\n\nAnd he gets one, behind a lovely drop shot.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 Alexander Zverev - SET!\n\n15:51 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nZverev’s serve was so much better in the second set, with the German winning over 80 per cent of his first serve points, serving at over 80 per cent too.\n\nAlcaraz couldn’t generate a break point there, while Zverev gave away just four unforced errors. A brilliant set from the German.\n\nThe French Open finals in 2022 and 2023 were won in straight-sets, by Nadal and Djokovic, both against Casper Ruud, but we could be going the distance here.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-6 Alexander Zverev - SET!\n\n15:48 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nSublime serving from Zverev. His thumps an ace out wide and gets to 40-0, so three set points.\n\nAlcaraz chips the reply and Zverev clips the forehand winner. How this has turned. We’re a set all in the French Open final.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-5 Alexander Zverev*\n\n15:42 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nThis feels like the best level of the match so far. Alcaraz thumps an ace out wide before Zverev lands a huge forehand winner down the line.\n\nZverev is alive in every rally now. He takes over from the baseline and pushes Alcaraz wide behind the forehand. The Spaniard nets. It’s gone from 40-15 to deuce.\n\nAlcaraz with the backhand dropshot into the net! It’s another break point for Zverev!\n\nAlcaraz saves: finding the forehand strike and then putting away the overhead, but it’s brutal from Zverev as he jumps on the forehand into the corner.\n\nAnother break point: and Alcaraz nets! Zverev gets the double break and this is a different match now!\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-4 Alexander Zverev\n\n15:37 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nSo good from Alcaraz! The Spaniard gets a chance to strike on the forehand as Zverev’s ball kicks off the netcord, but then moves in wonderfully on 15-15 to send a forehand winner past the German.\n\nZverev lands a brilliant serve out wide, leaving Alcaraz so far from the baseline to do anything with the backhand. Zverev repeats the trick on the other side.\n\nDeuce: Alcaraz works himself inside on the forehand and strikes down the line. Alcaraz finds a brilliant backhand down the line, and then a wonderful pick-up volley.\n\nBut Zverev’s reply is even better! What a shot from Zverev, reaching and producing a stunning angle! Alcaraz nets and that’s an impressive hold.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-3 Alexander Zverev* - BREAK!\n\n15:29 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAlcaraz finds himself in a hole on 0-30 and although he finds a stunning drop shot, a forehand into the net hands Zverev a look at two break points at 15-40.\n\nAlcaraz accelerates behind the backhand, while a huge gust kicks up a cloud of dust from the clay and puts Zverev off his backhand strike. 30-40.\n\nAlcaraz send a wild forehand out of the court and Zverev breaks to lead the second set, converting on the fifth break point of the second set!\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-2 Alexander Zverev\n\n15:24 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nIt looks like this second set could go the distance, as we’re 24 minutes played after four games. Zverev speeds things along with a love hold - more signs that his serve is improving.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 2-1 Alexander Zverev*\n\n15:20 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nA bruising rally from the baseline, the longest of the match at 21 shots, is finished wonderfully by Alcaraz with the forehand winner onto the line.\n\nZverev nets on the forehand return and turns to his box, venting in frustration. A good hold from Alcaraz.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 1-1 Alexander Zverev\n\n15:15 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nA very similar game to the previous one as Alcaraz battles back from 40-15 to deuce, as Zverev fails to deal with the Alcaraz forehand.\n\nZverev lands a big first serve out wide, leaving Alcaraz no room to return from. Another big first serve from Zverev and he lands the smash.\n\nHe holds and will need to continue that serving into the second set.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 1-0 Alexander Zverev*\n\n15:10 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nA second break point for Zverev, as Alcaraz lets a lob drop inside the baseline, but Alcaraz replies with the one-two strike as he lands the forehand winner.\n\nDouble fault from Alcaraz! Zverev will have another look at break point: but the fourth seed once again can’t land his return.\n\nAlcaraz pushes on the serve out wide, as Zverev fires wide on the forehand - another missed return.\n\nAlcaraz makes no mistake! Backhand winner, fired from the hip! Alcaraz holds serve in 10 minutes. A huge moment early in this second set.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 0-0 Alexander Zverev*\n\n15:05 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nNow then. Alcaraz jumped into a 40-0 lead at the start of the second set, but suddenly throws away the lead as Zverev gets back to deuce. Alcaraz’s backhand lob drifts long and all of a sudden Zverev has a look at break point.\n\nAlcaraz finds a first serve but Zverev can’t return! Chance missed. Zverev misses again on the backhand, pushing long, and has to restrain himself from smashing his racquet in frustration.\n\nZverev does well to follow in the forehand down the line, getting back to deuce.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 6-3 Alexander Zverev - SET!\n\n14:56 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nA window for Alcaraz he meets a Zverev volley at the net and the German gets the ball stuck under his feet, but Alcaraz then cracks the net on the forehand.\n\n30-30, but Zverev blinks on the foreand and fires long!\n\nSet point to Alcaraz: and a winner to seal it!

It’s 0-30, and Zverev’s first serve has gone missing, too.\n\nAlcaraz finds great depth to the baseline and Zverev can’t adjust as his forehand sails long. There will be two more break points: Alcaraz defends brilliantly and had the chance to pass Zverev at the net! He grins, after netting on the forehand!\n\nStunning defence from Alcaraz again to retrieve the Zverev smash - only to net again on the backhand! Zverev hangs on to get to deuce.\n\nACE from Zverev - timely. And that’s a big hold as Alcaraz pushes the backhand out.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz 4-2 Alexander Zverev*\n\n14:38 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nIt’s all flowing Alcaraz’s way right now, with Zverev struggling from the baseline. Alcaraz is throwing all sorts of balls at him and the German is having to hit on the run, react to spin and different depths. Alcaraz isn’t having to hit many winners yet but holds to take a 4-2 lead in this first set.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 3-2 Alexander Zverev - BREAK!\n\n14:34 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nA chance for Alcaraz, as the Spaniard becomes solid on the baseline to force Zverev into consecutive errors into the net.

Zverev races into it and puts away the forehand winner. Two break points for Zverev now: his forehand return is clipped wide.\n\nBut Zverev gets the break back! Alcaraz shanks a backhand wide and can’t take advantage of the opening break.\n\nFrench Open: *Carlos Alcaraz 1-0 Alexander Zverev - BREAK!\n\n14:14 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nWow. Zverev with two double faults in a row to start the final! The German changes his racquet after just two points, with Alcaraz looking at 0-30 in the opening game.\n\nThe change helps: Zverev thunders down a first serve straight away as Alcaraz hits a couple of forehands out of play, the Spaniard had a chance at 15-30 but went for too much on the forehand.\n\nZverev pushes wide so this opening game will go to deuce - Alcaraz moves in well and puts away a stunning slice volley!

We’re ready to go.\n\nAlcaraz won the toss and chose to receive, so Zverev will serve first.\n\n*denotes next server\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz vs Alexander Zverev\n\n14:05 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nWhile a right forerm injury limited Carlos Alcaraz to just four matches on clay before the French Open, Alexander Zverev played tournaments in Monte Carlo, Munich, Madrid and Rome - where he won six matches in a row to win his biggest title on clay.\n\nThe German was sharp when he defeated Rafael Nadal in his first-round opener. Alcaraz, meanwhile, has had to build his way through the tournament and rediscover his confidence. But has been able to reach the final and now stands on the brink of a third grand slam title.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz vs Alexander Zverev\n\n14:05 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nHere we go! Alexander Zverev will be the first out on court as the German emerges from the tunnel into the light on Court Philippe-Chatrier. The 27-year-old has spent more than 19 hours on court so far this tournament, which is considerably more than his opponent.\n\nNow here comes Alcaraz - still sporting that right arm sleeve. The Spaniard has never lost a grand slam final and is the slim favourite here. He seems to be the favourite among the crowd, too. We’re almost ready to go, after the warm-ups.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz vs Alexander Zverev\n\n13:47 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nCarlos Alcaraz on facing Alexander Zverev: “Sascha, he’s playing great tennis on clay. Big serve, big shots, really solid. It’s going to be a really interesting final.”\n\nOn his victory over Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals: “The cramps in this match, it wasn’t as much here as last year. I’m going to say I’m stronger mentally. I knew how to deal with these situations. I knew that the cramps are going to [go] away if I stay there. I know everything what I have to do [in] the situation.\n\n“But the cramping, I knew that I had to stay there. I knew that probably I had to make shorter the points. So I knew much better how to do it this year than last year.”\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz vs Alexander Zverev\n\n13:40 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAlexander Zverev on Carlos Alcaraz rivalry: “We had very tough battles in the past. It’s going to be a difficult match. It is a Grand Slam final. If you’re in a Grand Slam final, you deserve to be there. That goes for both of us. I think both of is are expecting a tough battle.”\n\nZverev on coming back from his US Open final defeat in 2020 and his ankle ligament injury in 2022: “You either come back stronger and you come back hungrier, you come back wanting to win more, which I feel like I did in 2021... Or you kind of go into yourself. You drop mentally a bit, as well. I’m happy that I was the sort of person that took the first path.”\n\nFrench Open: Keys to Carlos Alcaraz vs Alexander Zverev key stats\n\n13:30 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nDuring the French Open\n\nAces: Carlos Alcaraz - 22 | 64 - Alexander Zverev\n\nFirst serve: Carlos Alcaraz - 70% | 75% - Alexander Zverev\n\nSecond serve: Carlos Alcaraz - 59% | 52% - Alexander Zverev\n\nNet points: Carlos Alcaraz - 71% | 65% - Alexander Zverev\n\nBreak points: Carlos Alcaraz - 48% | 44% - Alexander Zverev\n\nReceiving points: Carlos Alcaraz - 47% | 42% - Alexander Zverev\n\nWinners: Carlos Alcaraz - 226 | 272 - Alexander Zverev\n\nFrench Open: Keys to Carlos Alcaraz vs Alexander Zverev\n\n13:20 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAlexander Zverev’s improved serve has been key to his performances on clay this season: the German made 86% of his first serves in his semi-final win against Casper Ruud and similar stats today would put him in a great position against Alcaraz.\n\nThe Spaniard is a brilliant counter-puncher, but Zverev dominated on serve in the pair Australian Open quarter-final earlier this season - with Alcaraz having a look at just five break points across the four sets.\n\nAlcaraz made a slow start to that match in Melbourne, as he did in the semi-final against Sinner, and can’t afford another against such a big server. Alcaraz’s variety and speed will always give him a certain advantage against Zverev, especially if his first serve percentage dips and Alcaraz can attack the second.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev arrivals\n\n13:10 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nCarlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev arrived at Roland Garros bright and early this morning. It’s a sunny, clear day in Paris, which should lead to conditions that favour big-serving and attacking play from the baseline. Both players had to slog it out during the first week, where the roof was often closed and resulted in a very different tournament.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz: Route to French Open final\n\n13:00 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nR1: vs JJ Wolf, 6-1 6-2 6-1\n\nR2: vs Jesper de Jong, 6-3 6-4 2-6 6-2\n\nR3: vs Seb Korda (27), 6-4 7-6 6-3\n\nR4: vs Felix Auger-Aliassime (21), 6-3 6-3 6-1\n\nQFs: vs Stefanos Tsitsipas (9), 6-3 7-6 6-4\n\nSFs: vs Jannik Sinner (2), 2-6 6-3 3-6 4-6 6-3\n\nWatch every moment of Roland-Garros LIVE on Eurosport and discovery+\n\nFrench Open: Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova win women’s doubles title!\n\n12:41 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nCoco Gauff: “This is my third final so third time is a charm. Thank you Katerina for agreeing to play with me, it was very last minute. Congratulations to Sara and Jasmine for a great tournament and congratulations Jasmine for a great tournament in singles.\n\n“Thank you for my team - it’s been a fun two weeks with you guys in singles and doubles. I know it’s been long and we’re all ready to go and have fun. Paris is my favourite city.”\n\nFrench Open: Alexander Zverev on ‘journey’ to Roland Garros final\n\n12:40 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAlexander Zverev spoke about his “journey” to his second grand slam final before facing Carlos Alcaraz today, and it’s certainly been an interesting one.\n\nFrom losing the US Open final to Dominic Thiem from two sets up in 2020, to breaking his ankle when facing Rafael Nadal in the French Open semi-finals in 2022, Zverev has taken the long road to get himself back to grand slam contention.\n\nCan the German, who won the Rome title to mark him as one of the favourites for Roland Garros, now take the next step? The 27-year-old has long been tipped to step into the dominance left behind by Djokovic, Nadal and Federer, but has seen the likes of Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner overtake him in recent years.\n\n“Going from basically the US Open final where I was two points away, to being rolled off in a wheelchair here two years ago. It’s all part of my journey,” he said.\n\n“Look, I’m in the final. I haven’t won yet. But I just want to play my best tennis and give myself the best chance. If I am able to do that and if I am able to lift that trophy, it will mean the world to me.”\n\nFrench Open: Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova win women’s doubles title!\n\n12:30 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nCoco Gauff is a doubles champion! The American and Czech partner Katerina Siniakova have defeated Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani to win the French Open women’s doubles title. It’s Siniakova eighth doubles title at the grand slams.\n\nMore heartbreak for the Italian Paolini, who was beaten in the singles final by Iga Swiatek yesterday. Gauff, the US Open champion in singles, now adds a doubles title to the 20-year-old’s impressive resume.\n\nGauff usually plays doubles with American partner Jessica Pegula, but the World No 5 had to withdraw from the French Open due to injury. Gauff and Siniakova have proved to be a dream pairing. Siniakova hads a third French Open women’s titles.\n\nFrench Open: Alexander Zverev settles abuse case with former girlfriend\n\n12:20 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nOn Friday, Alexander Zverev reached an out-of-court settlement with his former girlfriend, who accused the German tennis star of strangling her during an argument in May 2020.\n\nAccording to reports in Germany, the settlement includes a monetary condition of 200,000 euros. The discontinuation of the trial does not constitute a finding of guilt or an admission of guilt, a statement from Zverev’s lawyers said.\n\n“The process against Alexander Zverev was shelved today by the court with the agreement of the prosecutor’s office and Ms Brenda Patea,” a statement from the World No 4’s defence team said, hours before his French Open semi-final against Casper Ruud.\n\n“Alexander Zverev agreed to this in order to shorten the process especially in the interest of the child they have together. Alexander Zverev remains innocent.”\n\nAccording to the court, 150,000 euros of Zverev’s fine will go to the state with the other 50,000 euros going to charity, with both Zverev and Patea agreeing to stop the trial.\n\nZverev settles abuse case with ex-girlfriend before French Open semi\n\nFrench Open: Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova win opening set of doubles final\n\n12:07 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nThe opening set of the women’s doubles final goes the way of Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova, who edge the first-set tiebreak against Jasmine Paolini and Sara Erranil.

He had beaten rival Jannik Sinner in five sets, overturning a rocky start to outlast the player who will be turning world No 1 on Monday. Alcaraz’s victory, 2-6 6-3 3-6 6-4 6-3 in four hours and nine minutes, was not the classic that was expected between the two finest players of their generation, but it was a victory to display the vast amount of experience the Spaniard has already accumulated on these stages, acquiring the physical and mental tools to progress.\n\n“You have to find the joy in suffering, that’s the key, even more on clay in Roland Garros,” Alcaraz grinned. “Long rallies, four-hour matches, five sets, you have to suffer. But you have to enjoy suffering.” He is now the youngest player in tennis history to reach grand slam finals on all three surfaces, after winning the US Open and Wimbledon. Unlike the 22-year-old Sinner, this was not his first time in a French Open semi-final. While Sinner struggled with cramps, stretching out his hand and arm due to “tension” in the third set, Alcaraz had been there before.\n\nThe key to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner’s ‘weird’ French Open semi-final\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev’s grand slam records\n\n11:20 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nCarlos Alcaraz made history by becoming the youngest player to reach grand slam finals on all three surfaces. The Spaniard defeated Casper Ruud to win the US Open at the age of 19 in 2022, before winning an epic Wimbledon final against Novak Djokovic the following summer. Alcaraz will be playing in his first French Open final following victory over Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals.\n\nZverev is also playing in his first French Open final. The German had lost three semi-finals in a row before earning revenge over Casper Ruud on Friday. While Zverev is an Olympic champion and two-time ATP Finals winner, he has never won a grand slam. The closest he came was at the US Open in 2020. Zverev became the first player to lost a US Open final from two sets up in the open era, as Dominic Thiem claimed his first grand slam title.\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev head-to-head\n\n11:00 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAlexander Zverev holds the head-to-head over Carlos Alcaraz, and the German is the opponent the young Spaniard has faced the most often so far in his career with nine meetings.\n\nThree of those have come to at the grand slams, with Zverev winning two of them when he was not considered the favourite. That includes wins over Alcaraz in the 2022 French Open semi-finals and 2024 Australian Open quarter-finals.\n\n2024 - Indian Wells: Alcaraz 6-3 6-1\n\n2024 - Australian Open: Zverev 6-1 6-3 6-7 6-4\n\n2023 - ATP Finals: Zverev 6-7 6-3 6-4\n\n2023 - US Open: Alcaraz 6-3 6-2 6-4\n\n2023 - Madrid: Alcaraz 6-1 6-2\n\n2022 - French Open: Zverev 6-4 6-4 4-6 7-6\n\n2022 - Madrid: Alcaraz 6-3 6-1\n\n2021 - Vienna: Zverev 6-3 6-3\n\n2021: Acapulco: 6-3 6-1\n\nFrench Open: A historic French Open final\n\n10:40 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nThis afternoon’s French Open final will be the first without either Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic since 2004, as a new French Open men’s champion will be crowned.\n\nNadal won 14 French Open titles between 2005 and 2022, with Federer winning his first in 2009 and Djokovic claiming victory in 2015, 2021 and 2023. Stanislas Wawrinka also beat Djokovic in two finals.\n\nNadal was beaten in this year’s French Open first round by Alexander Zverev, while Djokovic withdrew before his quarter-final due to a right knee injury.\n\nFrench Open: Iga Swiatek says fourth Roland Garros title ’emotional’\n\n10:15 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nIga Swiatek on an “emotional” French Open title after victory over Jasmine Paolinin:\n\n“When I talk about pressure, I usually put pressure on myself because of pressure of the outside,” she said.\n\n“Obviously I’m a perfectionist, so there is always pressure behind me. But I think I’m fine with handling my own pressure.\n\n“It’s when the pressure from the outside hits me, then it’s a little bit worse. But I managed it really well at this tournament.\n\n“It was an emotional win, because I felt a lot of stress yesterday and today in the morning. And I knew if I’m going to just focus on tennis I can kind of fight through it, and at the end it all went how I wanted. So I just felt really proud of myself.”\n\nIga Swiatek races to third straight French Open title with victory over Jasmine Paolini\n\n09:45 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nIga Swiatek swept to a fourth French Open crown to keep her Queen of Clay title at Roland Garros.\n\nThe world number one from Poland brushed aside Italian underdog Jasmine Paolini 6-2 6-1 in and hour and eight minutes.\n\nKing of Clay Rafael Nadal may have played his last French Open this year but Swiatek comprehensively proved once again she is also Roland Garros royalty.\n\nShe is the first woman to win three consecutive Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007 and only the third to achieve the feat in Open history, along with Monica Seles.\n\nSwiatek is undefeated in Paris since 2021, 21 matches ago, and has won 34 of her 36 matches here, a record matched only by Seles and Chris Evert.\n\nSwiatek races to third straight French Open title with victory over Paolini\n\nFrench Open: Carlos Alcaraz on his first Roland Garros final\n\n09:20 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nCarlos Alcaraz wants to continue Rafael Nadal’s dominance of the French Open and keep the Spanish titles coming in Paris.\n\n“I have a special feeling about this tournament,” said the 21-year-old, who plays in his first French Open final today.\n\n“I remember when I finished school, running to my home just to put the TV on and watch the matches here in the French Open.\n\n“I watched a lot of matches. Of course Rafa Nadal dominating this tournament for, let’s say, 14, 15 years. It’s something unbelievable.\n\n“I wanted to put my name on that list of the Spanish players who won this tournament.\n\n“Not only Rafa. Ferrero, Moya, Costa, a lot of Spanish players, legends from our sport that won this tournament, I really want to put my name on that list, as well.”\n\nFrench Open: Women’s doubles final coming up first\n\n09:04 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nJasmine Paolini may have lost the women’s singles final to Iga Swiatek yesterday, but the Italian could yet taste silverware at Roland Garros as she bids for glory in the women’s doubles final at 10:30am.\n\nPaolini and Italian playing partner, the former World No 1 Sara Errani, are taking on the team of US Open champion Coco Gauff and Czech player Katerina Siniakova.\n\nThis is Gauff’s third grand slam final in doubles, but the American is yet to win one. She lost the French Open final with Jessica Pegula in 2022, the same year she lost to Swiatek in the singles final.\n\nPaolini is playing in a grand slam doubles final for the first time. Yesterday was her first singles final, so it’s been quite the weekend for the 28-year-old.\n\nFrench Open: Is Carlos Alcaraz vs Alexander Zverev on TV?\n\n09:01 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nWhen is it?\n\nThe French Open men’s final between Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz will not start before 1:30pm BST.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nViewers in the United Kingdom can watch the final live on Eurosport 1, with build-up on the channel from 1.00pm BST.
