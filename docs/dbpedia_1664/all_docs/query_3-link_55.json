        "text": "The gold medal is on the line, and it will be heading back to either China or Croatia as the women's singles tennis final gets underway at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Both Zheng Qinwen and Donna Vekic have beaten higher-seeded opposition to reach the decider, and will now face off at Roland-Garros to decide who will be the Olympic champion.\n\nChina's Qinwen came into the Olympics as the sixth seed, following a breakout year in which she reached her first major final at the 2024 Australian Open. Despite losing to Aryna Sabalenka in Melbourne, Qinwen has continued her strong 2024 form at the Paris Games, defeating Emma Navarro and Angelique Kerber on her way to the semifinals.\n\nIn the last four, she faced world number one Iga Swiatek, who having won her third-straight French Open title on the very same court just a few weeks ago, went into the semifinal as the clear favourite. However, Qinwen produced arguably her best performance of the year so far to win in straight sets, with a 6-2 7-5 scoreline taking her into the decider.\n\nSTREAM THE 2024 SUMMER OLYMPICS FOR FREE\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nLikewise, Vekic has also had the best year of her career to date in 2024, reaching the Wimbledon semifinals and coming into the Olympics as the 13th seed. She produced one of the biggest upsets of the tournament with a 7-6 6-2 win over USA hopeful and second seed Coco Gauff in the third round, before getting past 12th seed Marta Kostyuk and Anna Karolina Schmiedlova in the quarters and semifinals respectively.\n\nThat sets up a final between two players who've already pulled off major victories at this year's Games, both of whom reached the third round at Roland-Garros in June's French Open. With Paris' iconic home of tennis set to take centre stage again, trying to determine who will win the gold medal is far too close to call!\n\nThe curtain comes down on the women's tennis singles at the 2024 Olympic Games with what should be an enthralling final, and The Sporting News has all your TV and streaming details to follow all the action from Qinwen and Vekic's match.\n\nMORE: Exploring North Korea's return to the Olympic Games in 2024\n\n2024 Olympics women's tennis final date, location\n\nDate: Saturday, August 3, 2024\n\nLocation: Paris, France\n\nVenue: Court Philippe-Chatrier, Stade Roland-Garros\n\nThe women's singles tennis final at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris takes place on Saturday, August 3, from the home of the French Open, Roland-Garros.
