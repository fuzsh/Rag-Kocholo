        "text": "Roland Garros, the second Grand Slam tournament has finally come to an end, in Paris, France. Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz is the new Prince of Clay, winning his first major on red clay. In an intense final, against Alexander Zverev, Alcaraz toppled the German to win his maiden French Open title. The final scoreline read 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 in a match that lasted for over four hours.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz now has three grand slam titles to his name, on three different surfaces – clay, grass, and hard court. Only Australian Open has been out of his reach, and with the way he is performing that day isn’t too far away.\n\nPoland’s Iga Swiatek is the champion at Roland Garros for the third straight year. In the final, she defeated Italy’s Jasmine Paolini in straight sets. The final scoreline read 6-2, 6-1, in what was a sheer dominating performance from the world number one.\n\nThe match lasted for less than an hour, which clearly shows her domination in the final. She also became the French Open Champion for the 4th time in her career. With this, Iga has now equaled Belgium Justin’s Henin’s record in Paris. Only two more players – USA’s Chris Evert (7) and Germany’s Steffi Graf (6) have won more French Open titles at the Garros than Iga.\n\nAlso Read: Novak Djokovic’s withdrawal – what does this mean to tennis?\n\nNeither the 14-time winner Rafael Nadal, nor Novak Djokovic have made it to the Final here. Carlos Alcaraz is the new Prince of Clay and while Alexander Zverev gave his all, he can be really proud of what he achieved at the Garros 2024.\n\nTop players – both in the men’s and women’s categories were in the hunt to become the King and the Queen in Paris. There was a lot at stake for the participating players – regarding money and ranking points. Apart from lifting the trophy, Carlos Alcaraz also bagged some massive ATP points and also a big fat paycheque.\n\nHere’s a detailed monetary breakdown for the Roland Garros 2024.\n\nOther than players, here’s what fans should know going into the Roland Garros 2024:\n\nWhen is the Roland Garros?\n\nThe 2024 Roland Garros will be held from May 26 to June 9. This clay-court major will take place at Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France, and Amélie Mauresmo is the tournament director.\n\nWho is playing at the Roland Garros?\n\nRoland Garros will feature top players, including world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, Rafael Nadal, Daniil Medvedev, and Casper Ruud.\n\nWhat’s the Prize Money for Champions at Roland Garros?\n\nThe prizes for winning the tournament and reaching the final are significant. The runner-up will receive $1,304,880, while the champion will take home $2,609,760.\n\nFrench Open: How much money does the female single champion get?\n\nThe prizes for the finalist and champion in the women’s tournament will be the same as for the men. The runner-up will receive $1,304,880, and the new champion will win $2,609,760.\n\nFrench Open: How much money does the doubles champion get?\n\nFor doubles, the prize money is significantly less than for singles. Both the men’s and women’s doubles champions will earn the same amount. The doubles finalists will receive $320,783 each, while the doubles champions will take home $641,566 each.\n\nRoland Garros promises exciting competition with top-tier players vying for prestigious titles and substantial prize money.\n\nWith equality in prize distribution between men’s and women’s events, Roland Garros continues to uphold its reputation as a premier tennis tournament on the clay courts of Paris.
