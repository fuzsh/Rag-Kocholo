The result means there has now been a first-time winner of the women's singles at Wimbledon for seven successive years.\n\nThe match went to a deciding third set, with Krejcikova having won the first 6-2, and Paolini winning the second by the same score.\n\nSky Sports' Raz Mirza at Wimbledon said: \"In the opening set Paolini was nervy, but she came out firing in the second.\"\n\nHowever, the Czech ace overcame Paolini in the third and final set - breaking her opponent's serve to win 6-4 after a tense final game which saw her give up Championship Point twice.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Krejcikova said: \"I don't have any words right now. It's unreal what just happened. The best day of my tennis career and the best day of my life.\n\n\"I want to congratulate Jasmine and her team, she fought for every single ball, in the end I was the lucky one, but it's amazing what she's been able to achieve in such a short period.\n\n\"I was just telling myself to be brave. It was such a difficult match, a great final, a great competition and I'm super happy to be standing here enjoying this moment.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think nobody's going to believe I won Wimbledon. I still can't believe it. Two weeks ago I had a very tough match, 7-5 in the third set and I wasn't in good shape.\n\n\"I was injured and ill and didn't have a good start to the season and now I'm Wimbledon winner. How did that happen?\"\n\nRead more:\n\nDjokovic says Wimbledon fans 'disrespected' him\n\nMurray's mum reacts to decision that saw his Wimbledon career ended\n\n'You play such beautiful tennis'\n\nHolding her second grand slam runners-up trophy, Paolini said: \"To see this stadium full is a dream come true and to play on this stage.\n\n\"I want to congratulate Barbora, you played unbelievable, you play such beautiful tennis so congratulations to you and your team.\"\n\nIn reaching the final, Italian seventh seed Paolini, 28, had become the first woman to reach the French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same year since Serena Williams in 2016.\n\nKrejcikova, the 31st seed who won the 2021 French Open, had failed to go beyond the fourth round in Wimbledon until earlier this week.\n\nShe is the latest Czech to win the singles at Wimbledon, following last year's winner Marketa Vondrousova, who lost in the first round last week.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nAmong the famous faces watching the match were Mission Impossible actor Tom Cruise, as well as Wolverine star Hugh Jackman.\n\nSue Barker, Martina Navratilova, Ellie Goulding, Maria Sharapova and Billie Jean King, were also in the Royal Box."
