        "text": "Coco Gauff won the French Open women’s doubles title with partner Katerina Siniakova on Sunday, beating Italian duo Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani 7-6(5), 6-3.\n\nIt was Gauff and Siniakova’s first time playing together, with Gauff’s usual partner, American world No 5 singles player Jessica Pegula, out injured.\n\nGauff and Siniakova were able to target Errani’s serve throughout, but the Italians were able to do the same to Siniakova, with the pairs trading breaks on those serves through to a tiebreak. Gauff and Siniakova edged that, and a lengthy game on Gauff’s serve at the start of the second set, which deflated the Italian pair and allowed the Czech and the American to stay ahead until the end.\n\nThis is Gauff’s first Grand Slam doubles title, having lost two finals — the French Open in 2022, and the U.S. Open in 2021. Siniakova has now won eight, all with fellow Czech Barbora Krejcikova, but they parted ways after the 2023 season.\n\nBoth Gauff and Paolini were standout players in the women’s singles draw, losing to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in the semifinal and final respectively. This defeat for Paolini and Errani also marked the end of Italy’s promising run at the tournament; compatriots Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori yesterday lost the men’s doubles final to Marcelo Arevalo of El Salvador and Mate Pavic of Croatia, 5-7, 3-6.\n\nThere has also been more American success in Paris: Los Angeles 18-year-old Kaylan Bigun, who will play college tennis at UCLA, won the boys’ singles title, defeating Poland’s Tomasz Birkieta 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.\n\n(Tim Goode / Getty Images)"
