        "text": "Simone Biles, the most decorated gymnast in history, left the door open to possibly competing at the next Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028 after winning her third gold medal of the Paris Games on Saturday.\n\nAsked if the Paris Games would be the last time she would ever vault in competition, the 27-year-old American said: \"Never say never. The next Olympics is at home, so you just never know. But I am getting really old.\"\n\nBiles has captured gold medals in all three women's events contested so far in Paris: the team event, the all-around and the vault. She now owns 10 Olympic medals overall, including seven gold.\n\nBiles' health has been in the spotlight even since she withdrew from several events at the Tokyo Games after experiencing the \"twisties,\" a condition involving the temporary loss of spatial awareness experienced by some gymnasts when completing high-difficulty elements.\n\nShe took a two-year hiatus from the sport after the Tokyo Games but returned to qualify for Paris with the help of a therapist and the support for her teammates.\n\nUkraine claimed the gold medal in the women's sabre team event as they rallied to edge South Korea in a thrilling final bout at the Paris Games on Saturday.\n\nOlga Kharlan, who won individual bronze and Ukraine's first medal in Paris, put on a brilliant performance to lead her team to a comeback win for the country's first gold at the 2024 Games.\n\nBacked once again by an ecstatic Grand Palais crowd, Kharlan scored 22 touches in total to earn her sixth Olympic medal and the second gold in the event for Ukraine after winning in 2008.\n\nUkraine also tied the two gold medals won by the Russians at the 2016 and 2021 Games, while former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko praised the stunning triumph.\n\nJulien Alfred delivered a brilliant gun-to-tape performance to win the women’s 100 metres final on Saturday and claim Saint Lucia’s first-ever Olympic medal.\n\nAlfred made her usual slick start and remained clear in heavy rain on a sodden track to come home in a national record 10.72 seconds.\n\nWorld champion and race favourite Sha'Carri Richardson took silver in 10.87 but the American never really threatened and her compatriot Melissa Jefferson claimed bronze in 10.92.\n\nA notable absentee from the final was Jamaican double Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce who missed her semi-final after security officials at the Stade de France refused to let her in.\n\nAmerican Ryan Crouser became the first man to \"three-peat\" in the Olympic shot put on Saturday, adding another gold medal to his packed trophy cabinet with a mighty throw of 22.90 metres.\n\nHis compatriot Joe Kovacs won silver and Jamaica's Rajindra Campbell took bronze.\n\nThe world record holder battled with a nerve issue in his elbow this year but had no issues at the Stade de France as he produced his best throw of the season on his third attempt and clapped with satisfaction.\n\nThe win underlined the United States' total dominance of the event as they have now won 20 men's Olympic shot put gold medals. The next closest country is Poland with three.\n\nCanada's Summer McIntosh won the women's 200 metres individual medley on Saturday in an Olympic record time for her third swimming gold of the Paris Games and fourth medal overall.\n\nKate Douglass of the United States won the silver and Australian Kaylee McKeown the bronze after U.S. swimmer Alex Walsh was disqualified.\n\nThe gold completed a medley double for the 17-year-old McIntosh, who won the 400 IM last Monday. She also won the 200 butterfly on Thursday and took silver in the 400 freestyle on the opening Saturday.\n\nAustralia's Ella Ramsey did not start the final after the team reported she had tested positive for COVID.\n\nIndia's Shubhankar Sharma shot two late birdies that saw him card 1-over 72 but he slipped to Tied-48th at 2-under for three rounds in the Olympic men's golf competition in Paris on Saturday.\n\nSharma had two birdies against three bogeys.\n\nThings also did not work well for Gaganjeet Bhullar, the Indian in the fray.\n\nBhullar, who, like Sharma, is making his Olympic debut shot even par 71 and was T-48th as the Indians were in the lower half of the 60-man field. There is no cut at the Olympic Games.\n\nBhullar had three birdies, one of them on the 18th, against three bogeys.\n\nIn a bout that attracted global attention, Hungary's Luca Anna Hamari (66kg) braved intimidating gender row boxer Iman Khelif for three competitive rounds at the Paris Olympics and walked out feeling proud of herself as \"not fighting was not an option\" for her, here Saturday.\n\nThe Algerian, embroiled in a major gender controversy in the French capital, left the ring in tears after she guaranteed herself at least bronze by entering the women's 66kg semifinals.\n\nHer previous opponent, Italian boxer Angela Carini had pulled out of her bout against Khelif on Thursday just after 46 seconds, unable to take heavy punches from the Algerian, who was banned from the 2023 World Championship in New Delhi for failing the gender eligibility test.\n\nThe dramatic turn of events had created a huge furore in the boxing world and at the Games, with many questioning Khelif's presence in the women's competition even as IOC put up a stout defence of their decision to allow the Algerian to compete as a female.\n\nLuca had made it clear that she won't step back and she kept her promise with a courageous show. She took several punches on her body and also succeeded in landing a few on her opponent.\n\nIn the end, Khelif, who was cheered by the crowd, emerged victorious, taking a 5-0 unanimous decision win.\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwan's double world champion Lin Yu-ting are women who have every right to compete at the Paris Olympics despite a gender dispute that has overshadowed their competitions, the International Olympic Committee president said on Saturday.\n\nThe pair were cleared to compete in Paris despite being disqualified at the 2023 World Championships after failing International Boxing Association eligibility rules that prevent athletes with male XY chromosomes competing in women's events.\n\nThe IOC last year stripped the IBA of its status as boxing's governing body over governance issues, and took charge of the Paris 2024 boxing competition.\n\n\"We are talking about women's boxing. We have two boxers who were born as women, raised as women, who have passports as wo men and who have competed for many years as women and this is a clear definition of a woman,\" Thomas Bach told a press conference.\n\n\"There was never any doubt about them being women.\"\n\nThe IOC has said the IBA decision to disqualify them last year was arbitrary and the main cause for the furore that has swept social media and seen people such as J. K. Rowling and Elon Musk voice their opposition to them competing in the Games. Khelif pummelled Angela Carini in the round of 16 of their welterweight bout on Thursday before the Italian stopped after 46 seconds, with the Algerian's dominant performance further fanning the debate. The IBA on Friday promised to pay the defeated athlete $50,000 in prize money.\n\nRhys McClenaghan earned Ireland their first ever Olympic medal in gymnastics when he struck gold on the pommel horse with a smooth performance at the Paris Games on Saturday.\n\nNariman Kurbanov of Kazakhstan took silver, while Stephen Nedoroscik of the U.S. captured bronze.\n\nMcClenaghan closed his eyes and smiled in relief after executing his challenging routine for a score of 15.533 to eclipse Kurbanov by one-tenth of a point. Kurbanov also secured Kazakhstan their first ever Olympic medal in gymnastics.\n\nNedoroscik will take home his second bronze of the Games after helping the U.S. to a third-place finish in the team event.\n\nBriton Max Whitlock, the twice defending Olympic champion on the apparatus, was edged off the medal podium by 0.1 point, finishing in fourth despite besting his qualification score.\n\nBelgium's Remco Evenepoel had a heart-in-mouth moment as he claimed gold in the Olympic men's road race in impressive fashion on Saturday to become the first male rider to achieve the double after also winning the time trial.\n\nEvenepoel suffered a puncture less than four kilometres from the finish, on the Carousel du Louvre, raising his arm for assistance before clapping and waving at his team to deliver a new bike in a scene of sheer panic.\n\nWith race radio communication banned at the Games, the 24-year-old, who was cruising to victory, had no idea about the advantage he had over his rivals.\n\nThe change was made swiftly, however, and he powered to the line after he had made the decisive move 15km from the finish, in the run-in to the second of three punishing ascents of the Butte Montmartre.\n\nEvenepoel's brutal attack left Valentin Madouas, who was hovering 1:15 behind when Evenepoel's incident occurred, gasping for air but the Frenchman hung on to take silver after 273km, one minute and 11 seconds off the pace.\n\nChristophe Laporte won a small group sprint five seconds behind to take the bronze as France grabbed their first medals in the Olympic road race since 1956.\n\nEvenepoel raised his arm again in the final kilometre but this time it was a pre-celebration before stepping off his bike as he crossed the line for a photo with the Eiffel Tower in the background.\n\nBoxer Imane Khelif of Algeria assured a medal Saturday at the Paris Olympics following days of sharp scrutiny and online abuse as misconceptions about her gender have exploded into a larger clash about identity in sports.\n\nKhelif defeated Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary 5:0 in the quarterfinals of the women’s 66-kilogram bout.\n\nKhelif will win at least a bronze medal after defeating Hamori for the second victory of her tumultuous second trip to the Olympics.\n\nKhelif was faced international scrutiny after the banned International Boxing Association claimed Khelif failed an unspecified eligibility test for women’s competition last year. She then won her opening bout Thursday when opponent Angela Carini of Italy tearfully abandoned the fight after just 46 seconds.\n\nThe Indian shooting community, including veteran administrator Raninder Singh and renowned coach Jaspal Rana, on Saturday called for the junior program to be brought back under the national federation fold as \"nothing is coming out of Khelo India\" project.\n\nThe National Rifle Association of India's (NRAI) junior program had to be scrapped to make way for the central government-run Khelo India Games.\n\nThe current lot of shooters, including double Olympic medallist Manu Bhaker, is reaping the rewards of being around for a long time. But experts like Rana and Raninder are predicting doom for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic campaign if the federation does not get complete control of the development program.\n\nHistory repeated itself for China's defending champion Chen Meng when she beat teammate Sun Yingsha to win the women's singles table tennis gold medal at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, just as she had done at the Tokyo Games.\n\nChen, 30, became the third female table tennis player to win gold medals in singles at two consecutive Olympics.\n\nSun, the world number one, won the opening game comfortably with an 11-4 score.\n\nChen remained calm under pressure, especially when she went behind in the sixth game, to win the match 4-2.\n\nTwo table tennis Grand Slam champions, Zhang Yining and Ding Ning, were present in the stands to watch the match.\n\nIn the earlier bronze-medal match, Japan's Hina Hayata overcame injury to defeat South Korea's Shin Yu-bin in a hard-fought 4-2 victory that left her in tears.\n\nIt was Japan's second medal in the event, following Mimo Ito's bronze in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nMoments after Novak Djokovic beat Lorenzo Musetti to reach his first Olympic final the Serbian said in a court-side television interview that he had nothing to lose in the gold-medal match.\n\nLater that day, however, when asked whether he would be happy to leave the Paris Games with silver, the 37-year-old glared at his inquisitor and snapped: \"Next question!\"\n\nDjokovic faces Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in a blockbuster showdown at Roland Garros on Sunday and only victory will really satisfy the 24-time Grand Slam champion's hunger.\n\nHis four previous appearances at the Olympics earned him a solitary bronze medal and plenty of heartache as he lost three singles semi-finals to Rafa Nadal, Andy Murray and Alexander Zverev.\n\nHis relief at going a stage further in Paris was obvious as he fell on his back on the red clay after finishing off Italian Musetti.\n\nWhile he said the 21-year-old Alcaraz was the favourite, after the Spaniard beat him badly in the Wimbledon final last month, Djokovic has a steely look in his eye. He knows this is his last shot at the golden piece he needs to complete his career jigsaw puzzle.\n\n\"He reached the final without dropping a set. I mean, I did too, but I think with the way he's playing he's definitely a favourite,\" said Djokovic, the oldest player to reach the Olympic men's singles final since tennis returned to the Games in 1988.\n\nSpain's Carolia Marin moved into the Olympic badminton semi-finals on Saturday and said it had been a long journey back since missing the Tokyo Games with a serious knee injury.\n\nMarin, the 2016 women's singles champion, beat Japan's Aya Ohori 21-13, 21-14 at La Chapelle Arena to set up a final-four showdown with China's He Bingjiao.\n\nMarin was hot favourite for the title at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago until she suffered a cruciate ligament knee tear just months before the tournament.\n\nThat kept her out for a year and came just two years after she ruptured the ligament in her other knee -- an injury that sidelined her for eight months of 2019.\n\nMarin said it \"means a lot\" to be back in medal contention on the Olympic stage.\n\n\"Three years ago, I couldn't think that I would reach a semi-final here in Paris,\" she said.\n\nSouth Korea's Lim Sihyeon won gold in the women's individual archery event at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, taking home her third title during the Games.\n\nLim's compatriot Nam Suhyeon took silver, ensuring their country dominated the podium. But France's Lisa Barbelin fought off South Korea's Jeon Hunyoung for the bronze, winning France's first medal in the event to a wild roar from the crowd.\n\nWeather conditions at Esplanade des Invalides varied throughout the afternoon, as overcast skies alternated with bright sun and the archers dealt with both wind and still air, likely forcing them to constantly adjust their aim.\n\nIn the gold medal competition, Lim and Nam were well-matched and each had one set with a perfect score. The two archers helped South Korea win their 10th consecutive gold medal in the women's team event earlier during the Games.\n\nBut Lim, who also won gold in the mixed team event, overtook her teammate 7-3 to win the individual medal.\n\nSpectators backing France and South Korea rivalled each other for support on Saturday, waving flags and banners and stomping their feet during the bronze medal competition."
