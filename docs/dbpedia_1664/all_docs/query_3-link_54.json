        "text": "While tennis action at the French Open is dwindling, the best is yet to come in the tournament's final days.\n\nWorld No. 1 Iga Swiatek, who has been nearly unstoppable, is set to take on Italian star No. 12 Paolini for the title on Saturday.\n\nSwiatek's road to the final has been one of the most exciting to date, as the 23-year-old battled back from being down match point against Naomi Osaka in the second round before playing flawless tennis to win her next three rounds. She only dropped two games in the Round of 16 and quarterfinals. In the semifinals, she downed American Coco Gauff convincingly to book her third straight French Open final.\n\nThe Pole is on a quest to capture her fourth French Open singles title, a number that would put her past Serena Williams for Grand Slams won in Paris.\n\nOnly one women left may be able to stop her run. Here's how to catch the French Open women's final action:\n\nHow to watch the French Open women's final\n\nThe French Open final airs live on NBC and Peacock from Roland Garros in Paris at 9 a.m. ET.\n\nThe match will also stream on NBCSports.com and the NBC Sports app.\n\nHas Iga Swiatek faced Jasmine Paolini before?\n\nThe two have faced once in the 2022 U.S. Open first round which Swiatek won 6-3, 6-0.\n\nPaolini should not be counted out, however, as the Italian is playing some of her best tennis and is in the finals of both singles and doubles (with partner Italy's Sara Errani).\n\nWhat will make Swiatek difficult to beat is the confidence she has at the French Open but also playing in multiple Grand Slam finals. In comparision, this is Paolini's first major championship.\n\nPrediction: Swiatek beats Paolini 6-3, 6-2\n\nWho has the most French Open titles in women's tennis?\n\nChris Evert, the Queen of Clay, holds the record with seven French Open singles titles. The rest of the best are as follows:\n\n1. Chris Evert, 7\n\nT-2. Suzanne Lenglen, 6\n\nT-2. Steffi Graf, 6\n\nT-4. Margaret Court, 5\n\nT-4. Adine Masson, 5\n\nT-6. Justine Henin, 4\n\nT-6. Helen Wills Moody, 4\n\nT-6. Jeanne Matthey, 4\n\nT-9. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, 3\n\nT-9. Monica Seles, 3\n\nT-9. Serena Williams, 3\n\nT-9. Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling, 3\n\nT-9. Iga Swiatek, 3"
