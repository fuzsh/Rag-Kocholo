        "text": "The 2024 French Open has already delivered epic tennis battles sure to be talked about for years to come. This weekend, the French Open finals will be played, promising more top-tier tennis from the world's best including Carlos Alcaraz, Coco Gauff and Iga Świątek.\n\nKeep reading for how and when to watch the 2024 French Open finals at Roland-Garros.\n\nHow and when to watch the French Open finals\n\nThe 2024 French Open finals will be played on Saturday, June 8, 2024 and Sunday, June 9, 2024. The French Open finals will air on NBC and live stream on Peacock, and the platforms featured below.\n\nThe French Open finals schedule is:\n\nSaturday, June 8, 2024\n\nWomen's singles: 9 a.m. ET (6 a.m. PT)\n\nMen's doubles: 10:15 a.m. ET (7:15 a.m. PT)\n\nSunday, June 9, 2024\n\nMen's singles: 9 a.m. ET (6 a.m. PT)\n\nWomen's doubles: 10:15 a.m. ET (7:15 a.m. PT)\n\nHow to watch the French Open finals without cable\n\nIf your cable company doesn't carry NBC, or you've cut the cord with your cable company, you can watch the French Open finals on the platforms below.\n\nWatch the French Open finals on Peacock\n\nPeacock will broadcast the 2024 French Open finals. The streaming service has plenty more live sports to offer, including Sunday Night Football and Peacock-exclusive NFL games next season, Big Ten football, Premier League soccer and WWE wrestling (including formerly PPV-only events such as WrestleMania). There are 80,000 hours worth of recorded content to watch as well, including hit movies and TV series such as \"The Office\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\"\n\nA Peacock subscription costs $6 per month. An annual plan is available for $60 per year. You can cancel anytime.\n\nTop features of Peacock:\n\nPeacock is the only way to watch certain events of this year's French Open.\n\nPeacock features plenty of current and classic NBC and Bravo TV shows.\n\nStream the French Open finals on Sling TV for half price\n\nNBC is included in most cable TV packages. If you don't have cable TV that includes NBC, one of the most cost-effective ways to stream live tennis airing on NBC this year is through a subscription to Sling TV. The streamer offers access to the French Open, NFL Network, local NBC, Fox and ABC affiliates (where available) and ESPN with its Orange + Blue Tier plan. Also worth noting: Sling TV comes with 50 hours of cloud-based DVR recording space included, perfect for recording all the season's top NFL matchups.\n\nThat plan normally costs $60 per month, but the streamer is currently offering a 50% off promotion for your first month, so you'll pay just $30. You can learn more by tapping the button below.\n\nTop features of Sling TV Orange + Blue tier:\n\nThere are 46 channels to watch in total, including local NBC, Fox and ABC affiliates (where available).\n\nYou get access to most local NFL games and nationally broadcast games next season at the lowest price.\n\nAll subscription tiers include 50 hours of cloud-based DVR storage.\n\nWatch the French Open finals for free with FuboTV\n\nYou can also catch the French Open finals airing on NBC on FuboTV. FuboTV is a sports-centric streaming service that offers access to almost every NFL game of the season. Packages include CBS, Fox Sunday NFC games via \"NFL on Fox\", NBC (the French Open and Sunday Night Football), ESPN (Monday Night Football), NFL Network and more, so you'll be able to watch more than just today's games, all without a cable subscription.\n\nTo watch the French Open finals without cable, start a seven-day free trial of Fubo. You can begin watching immediately on your TV, phone, tablet or computer. In addition to the French Open, FuboTV offers MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer games.\n\nSports fans will want to consider adding on the $7.99 per month Fubo Extra package, which includes MLB Network, NBA TV, NHL Network, Tennis Channel, SEC Network and more channels with live games. Or upgrade to the Fubo Elite tier and get all the Fubo Extra channels, plus the ability to stream in 4K, starting at $90 per month ($70 for the first month).\n\nTop features of FuboTV Pro Tier:\n\nThere are no contracts with FuboTV -- you can cancel at any time.\n\nThe Pro tier includes over 180 channels, including NFL Network. (You'll need to upgrade to Ultimate for NFL RedZone.)\n\nFuboTV includes all the channels you'll need to watch college and pro football, including CBS (not available through Sling TV).\n\nAll tiers come with 1,000 hours of cloud-based DVR recording.\n\nStream on your TV, phone, and other devices.\n\nWatch the French Open finals free on Hulu + Live TV\n\nYou can watch the French Open airing on NBC with Hulu + Live TV. The bundle features access to 90 channels, including both Fox and FS1. Unlimited DVR storage is also included. Watch the French Open, plus every NFL game on every network next season with Hulu + Live TV, plus catch live NHL games, NBA games, MLB, exclusive live NFL regular season games, popular studio shows (including NFL Total Access and the Emmy-nominated show Good Morning Football) and lots more.\n\nHulu + Live TV comes bundled with ESPN+ and Disney+ for $77 per month after a three-day free trial. Tennis fans wanting to level up their coverage should consider the Sports add-on, which includes Tennis Channel and NFL Red Zone among others, for $9.99 per month.\n\nWatch the French Open finals live with a digital HDTV antenna\n\nIf you're cutting the cord to your cable company, you're not alone; in fact, you are in luck. You can still watch the French Open with an affordable indoor antenna, which pulls in local over-the-air HDYC channels such as CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS, Univision and more. Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.\n\nFor anyone living in a partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch the French Open on NBC without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable (or your cable company gets in a squabble with a network).\n\nThis amplified digital antenna can receive hundreds of HD TV channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox and Univision and can filter out cellular and FM signals. It has a 50-miles range and delivers a high-quality picture in 4K, UHD and 1080 HDTV, top-tier sound and features a 10-foot digital coax cable. This Amazon best-selling antenna is available for $19.\n\nWho's competing in the French Open finals?\n\nHere are the finalists in the 2024 French Open at Roland-Garros."
