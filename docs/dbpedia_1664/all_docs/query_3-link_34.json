        "text": "When to watch tennis during the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nTennis events begin at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games on the first weekend of competition. Men’s and women’s singles preliminary matches start on Saturday, July 27, with the finals of the women singles set to be played on Saturday, August 3. The men's singles final is scheduled to be played on Sunday, August 4.\n\nDoubles competitions will also be held for men, women and mixed teams. Final matches to decide who will take home gold will be played between Friday, August 2 and Sunday, August 4.\n\nTop-ranked Americans Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz will lead the U.S. tennis team this summer at the 2024 Paris Olympics, the USTA announced.\n\nGauff will make her debut at the Games in Paris after she had to drop out of the Tokyo Games in 2020 due to COVID-19. Joining Gauff on the women’s side is Jessica Pegula, Danielle Collins, Emma Navarro and Desirae Krawczyk. Gauff and Pegula will play doubles together, and Navarro will team up with Krawczyk for doubles. Krawczyk won the first of her four Grand Slam mixed doubles titles in Paris three years ago. The team will be coached by Kathy Rinaldi, the USTA's head of women's tennis.\n\nThe Paris Games will be Fritz’s Olympic debut. Fritz will be joined on the men’s team by Tommy Paul, Chris Eubanks and Marcos Giron for the singles event. Doubles specialists Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek are part of the roster and will compete in doubles, as will Fritz and Paul. The men will be coached by 2012 Olympic doubles gold medalist Bob Bryan.\n\nThe U.S. has captured 14 gold medals in Olympic tennis and will look to add to the collection this summer."
