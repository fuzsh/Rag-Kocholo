At closing, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon will be merged with and into MCI. MCI will be the surviving corporation, thereby becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. MCI shareholders will receive 0.4062 shares of Verizon common stock and $1.50 for each MCI share owned. In addition, MCI shareholders will receive a special dividend payment of $4.50 per share at that time. MCI will continue to own the stock of its subsidiaries, and MCI and its subsidiaries will continue to hold all of the FCC authorizations that they hold prior to the merger. Verizon will become the new parent of MCI, resulting in the indirect assignment of licenses or transfer of direct control of the FCC authorizations.
