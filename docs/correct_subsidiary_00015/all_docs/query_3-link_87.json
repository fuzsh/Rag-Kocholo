The prospectus supplement or pricing supplement may also add, update or change information in this prospectus. You should rely only on the information provided or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, any prospectus supplement, any free writing prospectus or any pricing supplement, and the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein, which are accurate as of their respective dates. Neither the delivery of this prospectus or any prospectus supplement, nor any sale made hereunder, shall under any circumstances create any implication that there has been no change in our affairs since the date of this prospectus, or that the information contained or incorporated by reference into this prospectus or any prospectus supplement is correct as of any time subsequent to the date of such information.\n\nYou should not consider any information in this prospectus, any prospectus supplement or any of the documents incorporated by reference herein or therein to be investment, legal or tax advice. You should consult your own counsel, accountants and other advisers for legal, tax, business, financial and related advice regarding the purchase of any securities.\n\nWe have not authorized anyone else to provide you with any information or to make any representation that is different from, or in addition to, those contained or incorporated by reference into this prospectus or any prospectus supplement, and, if given or made, such information or representations must not be relied upon as having been authorized by us.\n\nTo the extent there is a conflict between the information contained in this prospectus, on the one hand, and the information contained in a prospectus supplement, on the other hand, the information contained in the prospectus supplement shall control. If any statement in this prospectus conflicts with any statement in a document that we have incorporated by reference, then you should consider only the statement in the more recent document.\n\nThis prospectus contains summaries of certain provisions contained in some of the documents described herein, but reference is made to the actual documents for complete information. All of the summaries are qualified in their entirety by the actual documents. Copies of some of the documents referred to herein have been filed, will be filed or will be incorporated by reference as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and you may obtain copies of those documents as described below under the heading Where You Can Find Additional Information.\n\nIn this prospectus, we, us, our, us, and Verizon Communications refer to Verizon Communications Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION\n\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Filings that we make with the SEC also can be found on our website at http://www.verizon.com. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference herein and is not part of this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.\n\n1\n\n(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser:\n\n(i) Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and\n\n(ii) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(l)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.\n\n(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities:\n\nThe undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:\n\n(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;\n\n(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;\n\n(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and\n\n(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.\n\nThe undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the registrants annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole and (xii) the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.\n\nindemnifying party) in writing, and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding (provided, however, that if such indemnified party shall object to the selection of counsel after having been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall designate other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party) and the indemnifying party shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.\n\nIf the indemnification provided for in this Article VIII is unavailable to an indemnified party under the first or second paragraph hereof or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall severally contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Reselling Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Reselling Purchasers on the other in connection with the statement or omission that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Reselling Purchasers on the other in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes received by the Company bear to the total commissions, if any, received by all of the Reselling Purchasers in respect thereof. If there are no commissions allowed or paid by the Company to the Reselling Purchasers in respect of the Notes, the relative benefits received by the Reselling Purchasers in the preceding sentence shall be the difference between the price received by such Reselling Purchasers upon resale of the Notes and the price paid for the Notes pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Reselling Purchasers on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Reselling Purchasers and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.\n\nThe amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in this Article VIII shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, no Reselling Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it under this Agreement and resold as contemplated herein and in the Prospectus exceeds the amount of any damages which such Reselling Purchaser has otherwise paid or becomes liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Reselling Purchasers obligations to contribute as provided in this Article VIII are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.\n\nIX. SURVIVAL\n\nThe indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Article VIII and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Article VII of this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Reselling Purchaser or on behalf of any Reselling Purchaser or any person controlling any Reselling Purchaser and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.\n\nX. TERMINATION BY RESELLING PURCHASERS\n\nAt any time prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Reselling Purchasers, by notice given to the Company, if (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York [or Toronto]62 shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State [or Canadian]63 authorities, (iii) minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange by Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities involving the United States [or Canada]64 or declaration by the United States [or Canada]65 of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis shall have occurred, the effect of any of which is such as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the General Disclosure Package[, / and[ the Prospectus [and the Canadian Offering Memorandum]66.\n\nXI. TERMINATION BY PURCHASERS\n\nIf this Agreement shall be terminated by the Purchasers because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason (other than those set forth in Article V) the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Purchasers for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by such Purchasers in connection with the Notes. Except as provided herein, the Purchasers shall bear all of their expenses, including the fees and disbursements of counsel.\n\nXII. SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASERS\n\nIf for any reason any Purchaser shall not purchase the Notes it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the remaining Purchasers shall have the right within 24 hours to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Notes hereunder. If any Notes remain unpurchased after such 24-hour period, the amounts of Notes that the remaining Purchasers are obligated, severally, to purchase under this Agreement shall be increased in the proportions which the total amount of Notes which they have respectively agreed to purchase bears to the total amount of Notes which all non-defaulting Purchasers have so agreed to purchase, or in such other proportions as the Purchasers may specify to absorb such unpurchased Notes, provided that such aggregate increases shall not exceed 10% of the total amount of the Notes set forth in Schedule A to the Purchase Agreement. If any unpurchased Notes still remain after such 24-hour period and such increase, the Company shall have the right either to elect (i) to consummate the sale except as to any such unpurchased Notes so remaining or (ii) within the next succeeding 24 hours, to make arrangements satisfactory to the remaining Purchasers for the purchase by one or more other parties (collectively, the Substitute Purchaser) of such unpurchased Notes such that all of the Notes originally scheduled to be purchased hereunder shall be purchased by the non-defaulting Purchasers and such Substitute Purchaser. In such cases described in the first, second and third sentences of this paragraph, either the Purchasers [or the Representatives]67, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for not more than seven business days to a mutually acceptable date. If the Company shall not elect to so consummate the sale pursuant to clause (i) of the third sentence of this paragraph and any unpurchased Notes remain for which no satisfactory substitute Purchaser is obtained pursuant to clause (ii) of the third sentence of this paragraph, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Purchaser or the Company for the purchase or sale of any Notes under this Agreement. No provision in this paragraph shall relieve any defaulting Purchaser of liability to the Company for damages occasioned by such default.\n\n67\n\nInclude if applicable.\n\n[(i) The Paying Agent, Security Registrar, Transfer Agent and Sub-Authenticating Agent Agreement dated as of , 20[ ] , among the Company, the Trustee and BNY Trust Company of Canada (the Canadian Agent).]68\n\nI, or attorneys under my direction, have examined and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, certificates of public officials and other instruments relating to the offer and sale of the Notes as I have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of this opinion. In such examination I have assumed that all signatures on all such documents are genuine and that all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, and that copies of all documents submitted to us are complete and conform to the original documents.\n\nOn the basis of my examination of the foregoing and of such other documents and matters as I have deemed necessary as the basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed, I am of the opinion that:\n\n1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a duly licensed and qualified foreign corporation in good standing under the laws of those jurisdictions in which the Companys ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification (except where the failure to so qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the business, business prospects, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company), and has adequate corporate power to own and operate its properties and to carry on the business in which it is now engaged.\n\n2. All legal proceedings necessary to the authorization, issue and sale of the Notes have been taken by the Company.\n\n3. The Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.\n\n4. The Indenture is in proper form, has been duly authorized, has been duly executed by the Company and the Trustee and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, or similar laws of general applicability affecting the enforceability of creditors rights. The enforceability of the Indenture is subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including without limitation (i) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the TIA.\n\n5. The Notes (i) conform as to legal matters in all material respects with the description thereof in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, (ii) have been duly authorized and executed by the Company, and (iii) assuming due authentication and delivery thereof by the Trustee and payment therefor by the Purchasers in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and subject to the qualifications set forth in paragraph 4 above, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms and are entitled to the benefits afforded by the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and of the Notes.\n\n6. Except as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of certain jurisdictions, no authorization, approval or consent of any governmental or regulatory authority of the United States of America, the State of New York or the State of Delaware is required for the issuance and sale of the Notes.\n\n7. The execution and delivery of the Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture and the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein will not result in a violation of or conflict with the provisions of the restated certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the Company or any law, statute, order, decree, rule or regulation known to me of any court or governmental agency having jurisdiction over the Company or its property.\n\n8. To my knowledge there is no litigation or governmental proceeding pending or threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries which would affect the subject matter of the Agreement.\n\n9. The Registration Statement became effective under the Act, and, based solely upon a review of filings on the website of the Commission, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued by the Commission, and, to the best of my knowledge, no proceeding for that purpose is pending or threatened by the Commission. The Registration Statement as of its most recent effective date (including each deemed effective date pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Act), the Pricing Prospectus as of the Applicable Time, and the Prospectus as of the date thereof (except any financial statements or other financial data included in or omitted from, or incorporated by reference in, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, as to which no opinion is expressed) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Notes, to the requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder. For purposes of this paragraph, I have assumed that the statements made in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus are correct and complete. The Prospectus is lawful for use for the purposes specified in the Act in connection with the offer for sale and sale of the Notes in the manner specified in the Prospectus, subject to compliance with the provisions of securities or Blue Sky laws of certain States in connection with the offer for sale or sale of the Notes in such States.\n\nIn addition, I confirm to you that I have no reason to believe (A) that the Registration Statement and the Incorporated Documents, considered as a whole on the effective date of the Registration Statement (including each deemed effective date pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Act), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (B) that the General Disclosure Package and the Incorporated Documents, considered as a whole as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (C) that the Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, considered as a whole as of the date of the Prospectus and on the date hereof, contained or contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case I make no statement and express no belief as to the financial statements and schedules or other financial and accounting information and data or managements report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting contained therein.\n\nIn rendering the opinions contained herein, I am acting solely in my capacity as counsel to the Company, and I am not engaged or acting as counsel for any other person or entity. I disclaim any responsibility or duty to conduct any further investigation of the matters addressed herein after the date hereof, and disclaim any responsibility or duty to bring to your attention any change in the information herein.\n\nI express no opinion: (a) as to whether a United States federal or state court outside the State of New York would give effect to the choice of New York law in the Indenture and the Notes; (b) as to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts of the United States located in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Indenture; and (c) any waiver of forum non conveniens or similar doctrine with respect to proceedings in any court other than a court of the State of New York.\n\nI express no opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the Federal laws of the United States of America and the corporate laws of the State of Delaware.\n\nWithout my prior written consent, the opinions contained herein may not be relied upon by any person or entity other than the addressees, quoted in whole or in part, or otherwise referred to in any report or document, or furnished to any other person or entity, except that Milbank LLP [and __________] may rely upon the opinions contained herein as if this letter were separately addressed to them.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\ncc: Milbank LLP\n\n[_________]\n\n(d) performance of each of the Purchase Agreement, Indenture and Notes by the respective parties thereto do not, in the case of any such party, contravene, and such agreements are not invalid under, the law of the jurisdiction of organization of such party; and\n\n(e) the Notes have been duly authenticated by the Trustee.\n\nIn addition, we attended the closing held today [at the offices of the Company at One Verizon Way, Basking Ridge, New Jersey/via teleconference], at which the Company caused the Notes to be delivered to and held by the [insert name of the recipient of the Notes][ on behalf of The Depository Trust Company, 55 Water Street, New York, New York/, as common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream], for your several accounts, against payment therefor.\n\nBased upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject also to the assumptions and qualifications set forth below, and having regard to legal considerations which we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:\n\n1. The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.\n\n2. The Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by and on behalf of the Company.\n\n3. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (A) as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally; and (B) as the enforceability thereof is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including without limitation (i) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.\n\n4. The Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Notes and the Indenture conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. The Notes, when authenticated by the Trustee under the Indenture and issued and paid for by the Purchasers in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, and are entitled to the benefits afforded by the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and of the Notes (subject to the qualifications in paragraph 3 above).\n\n5. On the basis of information received by the Company from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission), the Registration Statement, as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement, filed with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), is effective under the Act and, to our knowledge based on our review of the Commissions website, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to our knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened.. The Prospectus is lawful for use for the purposes specified in the Act, in connection with the offer for sale and sale of the Notes in the manner therein specified, subject to compliance with the provisions of securities or Blue Sky laws of certain States in connection with the offer for sale or sale of the Notes in such States. For the purposes of this paragraph 5, the term knowledge means the current actual knowledge of the attorneys at our firm who are actively and directly involved in the representation of the Purchasers in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.\n\n6. The Registration Statement, as of its most recent effective date (including each deemed effective date pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2)), the Pricing Prospectus, as of the Applicable Time, and the Prospectus, as of the date thereof (except any financial statements or other financial data included in or omitted from, or incorporated by reference in, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus as to which no opinion is expressed) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Notes, to the requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as applicable, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. For purposes of this paragraph, we have assumed that the statements made in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus are correct and complete.\n\nEXHIBIT B-2\n\nMILBANK LLP\n\n55 Hudson Yards\n\nNew York, New York 10001-2163\n\nVERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC.\n\n[$//£/C$] ,000 Notes due\n\nand the other several Purchasers\n\nreferred to in the Purchase Agreement\n\ndated , among such\n\nPurchasers and Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen:\n\nWe acted as counsel for the Purchasers in connection with the purchase by you of [$//£/C$] ,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes due (the Notes) issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (the Company) pursuant to the terms of a Purchase Agreement dated , relating to the Notes (the Purchase Agreement), entered into by you with the Company. We are furnishing this letter to you pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein that are not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Purchase Agreement.\n\nAs counsel for the Purchasers, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (each such document being prepared by the Company), we reviewed certain corporate records and documents furnished to us by the Company and we participated in discussions with counsel for and representatives of the Company, independent registered public accountants for the Company and your representatives regarding the contents of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and related matters. We note that we did not participate in the preparation of the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, although we have reviewed such documents and considered the factual matters set forth therein as a part of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as of the dates set forth in this letter. The purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and we have not undertaken to verify independently any of such factual matters. Moreover, many of the determinations required to be made in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus involve matters of a non-legal nature. Accordingly, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, and we make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements except to the extent set forth in paragraph 4 of our separate opinion letter to you dated the date hereof. In addition, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for ascertaining whether or when any of the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus was conveyed to any person for purposes of Rule 159 under the Act.\n\nOn the basis of and subject to the foregoing we confirm to you that nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that: (i) the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting information and data and managements report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as to which we express no belief and make no statement), as of its most recent effective date (including each deemed effective date pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2)), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) the General Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements and other financial and accounting information and data and managements report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as to which we express no belief and make no statement), as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial and accounting information and data and managements report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as to which we express no belief and make no statement), as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\n\nExhibit 4.9\n\nFORM OF U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED, FIXED RATE DEBT SECURITY\n\n(FORM OF FACE OF DEBT SECURITY)\n\n[IF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY IS THE DEPOSITORY, INSERT THE FOLLOWING:\n\nUNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION (DTC), NEW YORK, NEW YORK, TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO.
