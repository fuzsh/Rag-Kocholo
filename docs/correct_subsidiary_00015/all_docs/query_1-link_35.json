        "text": "ASHEVILLE, NC -- Cellular customers in Transylvania, Haywood, Swain, Jackson, Macon, Clay, Graham, and Cherokee counties now have continuous cellular telephone coverage, plus a host of other new services, thanks to the fact that Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile has acquired the license to provide service to their communities.\n\n\"A customer can now start a call in Greenville, S.C., or even Charlotte, and continue it on up I-40 or down I-26 or even down Highway 19 all the way to Murphy,\" said Lindell Agee, General Manager of sales in the area. \"In this new service area, customers will receive both better and clearer communications via their cellular phones, faxes, and laptops and achieve savings in doing so because of our seamless efficiency.\"\n\nIn the Carolinas, Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile now provides seamless cellular service to an area of approximately 3,429 square miles. According to Agee, the acquisition is part of Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile's plan to expand its presence in the Carolinas, as well as the entire East Coast corridor.\n\nBell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile plans to incorporate the new area into its Carolinas SuperSystem, which provides home-rate calling to customers in the Charlotte, Hickory, Rockingham, Columbia, Greenwood, and Upstate South Carolina markets.\n\nIn addition to an extended seamless coverage area, the company intends to make significant enhancements to its local cellular network.\n\n\"Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile takes great pride in providing our customers with cellular services that are second to none,\" Agee said. \"We plan to enhance the quality of the service in the area by activating new cell sites and upgrading existing locations over the next few months.\n\n\"The counties within this new service area are some of the most remote in the Carolinas, making strong, sure communications via cellular of great importance in serving the needs of both businesses and individuals.\"\n\nThe company also plans to offer new services to customers in the area, including the Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile MobileReach and TraveLink(SM) services.\n\nTraveLink provides automatic call delivery through 3,000 major U.S. cities and Canada.\n\n\"With TraveLink there's no need to know Roamer access codes to reach a Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile customer,\" Agee says. \"Callers just dial the seven-digit number and the TraveLink system does the rest -- it finds them in whatever TraveLink city they happen to be.\"\n\nTo provide for the increasing service demands of the new area, BELL ATLANTIC NYNEX Mobile plans to locate a temporary Communications Store in Waynesville, until the permanent location is finalized. The Waynesville store will feature a variety of wireless communications products, including cellular phones, fax machines, pagers, and accessories.\n\n\"Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile Communications Stores are one-stop shops where customers can rely on our specialists to help them determine the products and services that best fit their needs,\" Agee says. \"The store will be staffed with familiar faces because we know local people understand local needs and we are committed to being the best local service provider.\"\n\nBell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile also has outside communications professionals who provide one-on-one, on-site service by appointment.\n\nBell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile, headquartered in Bedminster, NJ, is the largest wireless service provider on the East Coast and the second largest provider in the United States. The company offers a full range of wireless voice, data, and paging communications solutions to its three million customers in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and through a separate subsidiary, in the Southwest. The company was formed in July 1995 through a combination of Bell Atlantic Mobile's and NYNEX Mobile's cellular operations. The new company has more than 5,000 employees.\n\nNYNEX is a global communications and media company that provides a full range of services in the northeastern United States and high-growth markets around the world, including the United Kingdom, Thailand, Gibraltar, Greece, Indonesia, the Philippines, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Corporation is a leader in the telecommunications, wireless communications, cable television, directory publishing and entertainment and information services."
