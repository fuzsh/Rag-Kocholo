        "text": "WALLINGFORD, Conn. â€” To support the growing demand for its wireless communications services in Connecticut, Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile announced it has begun construction of a 42,000 square foot, $5 million expansion to its regional headquarters located at 20 Alexander Drive in the Barnes Industrial Park in Wallingford.\n\nAt a groundbreaking ceremony today, Jack Plating, president, Northeast region, Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile kicked-off the effort which is scheduled for completion in the third quarter `97.\n\nThe company's existing 63,200 square foot facility, housing 300 employees, will now expand by 42,000 square feet to accommodate additional personnel. The additional room will also house more wireless switching equipment needed for the growing wireless network. The need to expand the facility, according to Plating, is due to continued strong growth in cellular phone subscribers.\n\n\"Maintaining high quality service requires a continuous investment in our facilities and network,\" said Plating. \"The investment will support the introduction of new wireless communications equipment which will allow us to meet growing service demands.\" Editor's Note: Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile is the largest wireless service provider on the East Coast and the second largest in the United States. The company owns and operates the most extensive network in the east, covering 111,000 square miles, and the largest chain of wireless retail outlets offering a full range of wireless personal communications services, including voice, data and paging. Based in Bedminster, NJ, Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile has 4.4 million customers and 6,500 employees in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and, through a separate subsidiary, in the Southwest. The company was formed in July, 1995, by combining the cellular operations of Bell Atlantic Mobile and NYNEX Mobile.\n\n####"
