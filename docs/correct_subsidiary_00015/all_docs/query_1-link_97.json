        "text": "Fairpoint Communications is making its case before Vermont regulators this week as part of its bid to buy Verizon's land-line business in northern New England.\n\nVerizon — the successor of New England Telephone, NYNEX and Bell Atlantic — is focusing more and more on wireless voice and data transmission. Getting out of the land-line business is a natural part of the company's direction.\n\nThe hearings before Vermont's Public Service Board — that state's equivalent of New Hampshire's Public Utilities Commission — began Wednesday and continue through today and are of a technical nature.\n\nFairpoint is expected to be quizzed in detail regarding how it plans to operate Verizon's telephone land lines and broadband service. In addition to getting a go-ahead from Vermont regulators, similar approvals have to come from public utilities regulators in New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nWho owns and operates telephone and broadband service in northern New England is mainly a technical and economic one. Can Fairpoint do the job at least as well as Verizon has done at a similar cost to ratepayers?\n\nIt's a $2.7 billion deal Fairpoint — a North Carolina firm — is trying to pull off.\n\nFace it, a lot has changed since the days of Ma Bell — when the alternatives to American Telephone and Telegraph and its subsidiaries were the technological equivalent of two tin cans and a length of string.\n\nMore and more people are turning to wireless communication, especially as it applies to telephone service. But, for the time being at least, land lines will remain an integral part of the communications network in the U.S.\n\nThe bid to transfer Verizon's land-line business to Fairpoint is not without its critics. Voices have been raised and lawn signs calling for the sale to be halted are being seen in some areas. Verizon employees are understandably concerned about what new ownership will mean for them despite Fairpoint assurances.\n\nThe wheel will turn — or at least ought to turn — on what is best for the ratepayers of New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont — reliable service at reasonable rates.\n\nIt's a cold fact, but it's all that matters to most of us."
