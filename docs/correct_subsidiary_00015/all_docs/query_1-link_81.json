        "meta_description": "Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ, NASDAQ: VZ), branded as Verizon, is an American broadband and telecommunications company and a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It started in 1983 as Bell Atlantic (based in New York City) with a footprint covering New Jersey to Virginia and emerged as part of the 1984 AT&T breakup into seven \"Baby Bells.\" In 1997, Bell Atlantic merged with another Regional Bell Operating Company, NYNEX, based in New York City with a footprint spanning from New York to Maine. The combined company kept the Bell Atlantic name. In 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired former independent phone company GTE, and adopted the name \"Verizon\", a portmanteau of veritas and horizon. The company's headquarters are located in the Verizon Building at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, New York City.\n\t\n\tAT&T breakup and NYNEX acquisition\n\t\n\tVerizon was founded as Bell Atlantic Corporation, by William J. Kathrein. It was one of the \"Baby Bells\" that were formed as a result of the anti-trust judgment against the American Telephone & Telegraph Company. Bell Atlantic then inherited seven of the Bell Operating Companies from AT&T (later known as AT&T Corporation) following its breakup. Bell Atlantic's original roster of operating companies included:\n\t\n\tThe Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania\n\tNew Jersey Bell Telephone Company\n\tThe Diamond State Telephone Company\n\tThe Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company\n\tThe Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland\n\tThe Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia\n\tThe Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia\n\tBell Atlantic originally operated in the US states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, as well as Washington, D.C.\n\t\n\tIn 1994, Bell Atlantic became the first Regional Bell Operating Company to entirely drop the original names of its original operating companies. Operating company titles were simplified to \"Bell Atlantic – state name\".\n\t\n\tIn 1996, CEO and Chairman Raymond W. Smith orchestrated Bell Atlantic's merger with NYNEX CEO Ivan G. Seidenberg. When it merged, it moved its corporate headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City where CEO's Smith and Seidenberg shared Co-CEO duties. NYNEX was consolidated into this name by 1997.\n\t\n\tPrior to its merger with GTE, Bell Atlantic traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the \"BEL\" symbol.\n\t_________________________________________________\n\t\n\tOn September 21, 1999, Bell Atlantic and UK-based Vodafone AirTouch Plc (now Vodafone Group Plc) announced that they had agreed to create a new wireless business with a national footprint, a single brand and a common digital technology – composed of Bell Atlantic's and Vodafone's U.S. wireless assets (Bell Atlantic Mobile (which was previously called Bell Atlantic-NYNEX Mobile by 1997), AirTouch Cellular, PrimeCo Personal Communications, and AirTouch Paging). This wireless joint venture received regulatory approval in six months, and began operations as Verizon Wireless on April 4, 2000, kicking off the new \"Verizon\" brand name.\n\t\n\tWikipedia Quote",
