        "meta_description": "A wireless-driven world, outstanding recovery systems and consumer satisfaction: Verizon has read twentyfirst century mobile communications trends better than its competitors and is poised to reap rich rewards. In the history of mankind, the power of communication has never been as ubiquitous as it is today. Our lives are inextricably linked with quick and reliable communications. From the nineteenth century, when the telephone was invented, to the birth of the Baby Bells, the telephone has graduated from an obscure product to one of the most potent and versatile modern technological tools ever invented. Though conceived in 2000, Verizon is a corporate progeny of the nineteenth century Baby Bells. Today, with 60.7 million U.S. subscribers in its Wireless division alone, the company is a global force. Headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, offering a legion of communications products and solutions through three business divisions, Verizon – which stands for reliability and limitless possibilities – epitomizes the global communications revolution that has transformed the telephone into a mobile, web-enabled marvel purveying voice, text, pictures, mail, information and entertainment. And along with Spirit and Cingular (see chart), Verizon is one of America’s big three telecom firms, leading the country’s cellular telephony revolution. It recorded revenues of $88.1 billion and net income of $6.2 billion in 2006. But it is Verizon’s cutting-edge, innovative corporate philosophy and occasional derring-do that sets it apart from not only its two similar-sized American competitors but global leaders like France Télécom and Deutsche Telekom. (The British mobile phone giant, Vodafone, owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless.) “THE SPIRIT OF SERVICE” “Mr. Watson – come here – I want to see you.” These were the first human words uttered across a communication device designed for ‘transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically’. Alexander Graham Bell had accidentally upset a battery, spilling some acid on his clothes and was urgently calling out to his assistant, who was in a different room. Of course in the ensuing excitement of the first telephonic exchange, the accident was forgotten. This was in 1876, only three days after Bell received a patent for a telephone transmitter. The next year, 1877, spawned Bell Telephone Company and sparked the phenomenon called telephonic communications.The world would never be quite the same again. A century-and-a-quarter later, in 2000, Verizon was born from the merger of several telecom companies. Some were successful enterprises made up of mergers and acquisitions themselves. The connection between these, and therefore of Verizon, lay in their roots in the 1800s and 1900s. Alexander Bell’s Eureka moment and the establishment of his company are the defining moments in the telephone’s history. However, Alexander Bell’s monopoly came to an end in 1893 when his original patents expired. Independent telephone companies now mushroomed. In 1908, Theodore Vail, the then-new president of AT&T (American Telephone and Telegraph), announced his vision for the telephone industry which would operate effectively as a monopoly offering universal service. “One Policy, One System, Universal Service” was the motto of the new Bell System. While AT&T was nicknamed “Ma Bell”, innumerable RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies) came up, known as Baby Bells. Although the system was criticized for allowing AT&T’s monopoly to flourish, it was said to be an effective arrangement whose aim was to arm every American household with a telephone. “The Spirit of Service” became synonymous with the Bell system, as represented in a specially-commissioned painting by the same name. It depicted 23-year-old Angus MacDonald, a New England Bell lineman working amidst the Great Blizzard of 1888 so that the long-distance telephone lines between New York and Boston were maintained. At a time when the Northeast came to a standstill with piles of snow as tall as houses and highways blocked off, telephone lines were the only means of communication with New York due to the dedication of linemen like MacDonald. Consumers were appropriately impressed and turned a blind eye to the monopoly. The history of the Bell companies is dotted with similar instances demonstrating “The Spirit of Service”. On February 27, 1975, a fire wrecked a New York Telephone Central Office, causing the worst damage ever to a Bell company. Restoring lines serving over 170,000 phones within 22 days, the company achieved in just over three weeks what would have otherwise taken a year. The exemplary repair work is often referred to as “The Miracle of Second Avenue”. Much later, after the Bell companies had been broken up and mobile phone services launched, Verizon would carry on the lineage with heroic restoration work during other times of disaster. THE MORE THE MERRIER “The most successful men in the end are those whose success is the result of steady accretion.” —Alexander Graham Bell Verizon, a Dow 30 company, seems to have lived by – and indeed lived up to – this adage. The brand name, synonymous with broadband, wireline and wireless solutions, has three businesses in its portfolio: Verizon Telecom, Verizon Wireless and Verizon Business. Each of these ventures was formed by divestitures or mergers and acquisitions from a number of companies. The first venture, Verizon Communications, was created from the amalgamation of Bell Atlantic and GTE. This move, itself, was fueled by the Telecommunications Act of February 8, 1996, which allowed for greater market-based policies and permitted RBOCs to offer long-distance services. Two years later, on July 27, 1998, the Bell Atlantic- GTE merger, one of the largest in U.S. business history, was formalized. While Bell Atlantic was one of the seven original Baby Bell companies which began operations in 1984, GTE was never a part of the Bell System and has its beginnings in 1918. The $52-billion deal, which brought them together, aimed at building a firm which would be one of the most formidable companies in the telecommunications industry – Verizon. It seemed possible to achieve an optimum scale of operations, given the companies’ outstanding track records. Prior to the merger, GTE was one of the world’s largest telecommunications enterprises with over $25 billion in revenues in 1999. Its operations served 35 million access lines through subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada and the Dominican Republic. The markets in Canada, Puerto Rico and Venezuela were served through affiliates. In the U.S., GTE served more than 7.1 million wireless customers. Impressive as GTE’s portfolio was, Bell Atlantic was even bigger with revenues of $33 billion. Bell Atlantic had a customer base across 13 states from Maine to Virginia which were complemented by GTE’s long-distance expertise. They say when it rains, it really pours. Even while Verizon Communications was gestating, another embryonic Verizon entity was taking shape. On September 21, 1999, Bell Atlantic and London-based Vodafone AirTouch Plc announced the coming together of their U.S. wireless assets. Armed with a plan for a single brand name, common digital technology and a national footprint, Verizon Wireless was established on April 4, 2000, one day after the Verizon brand was officially launched. GTE’s wireless operations naturally came under the Verizon Wireless umbrella, creating the largest wireless company in the U.S. The management of the original companies assumed similar roles in Verizon Communications. Former GTE Chairman and CEO Charles R. “Chuck” Lee became Verizon’s founding Chairman of the Board and co-CEO, while former Bell Atlantic CEO Ivan Seidenberg was appointed Verizon’s founding President and co-CEO. Armed with its powerful bouquet of products, services and expertise, Verizon began its ascent. In the first five years, Verizon spent over $72 billion to maintain and expand its technology infrastructure. With operating activities generating large returns, Verizon invested money in developing its broadband and wireless services. The firm was quick to shed its non-profitable arms. In 2002, it sold its wireline access lines in Alabama, Missouri and Kentucky. Hawaii followed suit in 2005. The environment for mobile telephony and valueadded internet services was meanwhile becoming increasingly fertile. Opportunities abounded. In order to bring next-generation broadband services (wireless EVDO and fiber-optic-based FiOS services) to wireline and wireless consumers in the U.S., Verizon began several initiatives in 2004. FiOS TV, a video service that harnessed the speed and capacity of broadband and offered the consumer a number of television choices, was launched in September 2005. This became a big hit, yielding high demand: franchises covering one million households for FiOS TV services were set up. “CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?” The victory sign used during World War II has left an indelible mark on the human psyche. While derivatives of the ‘V’ sign are found often, Verizon too expressed its identity through the ‘V’. The 2000 advertising campaign showed people on their cell phones making the ‘V’ sign to indicate they were on the Verizon network. Over the years, Verizon’s marketing campaign also evolved: from “Join in” to stage actor Paul Marcarelli – walking in strange places – asking a Verizon test technician: “Can you hear me now? Good.” In 2005, the tagline changed to “It’s the Network”, to emphasize its reliability. Verizon’s favorite line, however, was: “We never stop working for you.” While Verizon Wireless and Verizon Communications were establishing themselves, the third arm, Verizon Business, was coming up. On February 14, 2005, Verizon agreed to acquire MCI, Inc. with the aim of improving Verizon’s global delivery in the areas of converged communications, information and entertainment. The deal closed at $8.5 billion on January 6, 2006, giving Verizon $90 billion in annual consolidated operating revenues, 250,000 employees and customers in 140 countries. Verizon Business employs undersea mesh technology to connect three major submarine cable systems across the Atlantic Ocean, providing multiple paths for voice and data traffic. Today, Verizon Business holds over 700 technology patents. In December 2006, Verizon Business joined an Asia- Pacific consortium to build the first next-generation undersea optical cable system linking the U.S. and China, the Trans-Pacific Express, which will be completed in 2008. Verizon Business focuses on disaster recovery through its network. On December 26, 2006, an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale hit Taiwan, damaging eight major under-sea cables in 22 locations. Communications to hundreds of people were disrupted with Taiwan, Hong Kong and China being most affected. All major voice and data routes to Asia were interrupted. Verizon Business restored critical network traffic within 12 hours and maintained full network connectivity on its private IP network. It restored part of the public IP network to Taiwan within 24 hours. Less than a week after 9/11, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) began trading again. Within three months, a phone and data network resembling the size and complexity of a Cincinnati-sized city was set up at Ground Zero. Verizon was key in these endeavors, also providing emergency services help in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon, where the terror attacks had wrecked communications facilities. These instances display the importance of having a well-backed up data network, especially in today’s globalized environment. More and more companies are realizing the necessity of adding recovery processes to their portfolios. Recently ENGlobal Corp., a provider of engineering and professional services in the petroleum and petrochemical industries, sought recovery solutions. “Disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita remind us that recovery processes are critical for today’s data-rich businesses,” says Nancy Gofus, Senior Vice-President and Chief Marketing Officer, Verizon Business. “Our disaster planning places specific dollar figures on the loss of business continuity,” says Alex Schroeder, Manager of IT, ENGlobal. “As a technology-driven business, we take a close look at the impact of recovery on our day-to-day operations – things like information technology costs, lost worker productivity and lost customer projects.” In 2004, Verizon’s new Chairman and CEO, Ivan Seidenberg, told the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that delivering 100 megabits of capacity to people wherever they are – at home, at work, on the go – should be the long-term goal for the communications and high-tech industries. He said: “These kinds of networks will create a platform for new applications, services and communications technologies, giving Americans even more choices in the electronic communications marketplace.” WIRELESS FUTURE Communications technology has evolved over the years – from analog to digital, from wired to wireless platforms, from narrowband to broadband. Companies too have evolved to integrate the demand for newer technologies. Wireless services are contributing an ever-larger part of Verizon’s revenues while local wireline services are shrinking. Within the wireline market, growth has come in the areas of longdistance, data and broadband services (DSL/Digital Subscriber Lines and new optic-based services marketed under FiOS). Verizon added more than 440,000 wireline broadband customers in the second and third quarters of 2006. Of these, over 111,000 were new FiOS customers in the second quarter and 147,000 new FiOS customers in the third quarter. The future will clearly favor wireless technology with statistics indicating that the wireless solutions industry will total $1.6 trillion in 2011. The U.S. will be the biggest telecommunications market with revenues rising to $720 billion by 2011. Markets will expand in Western Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America with revenue growth particularly high in Latin America over the next few years. In such an environment, Verizon with its quick and practical strategies will thrive. Verizon’s Wireless cellular service – like competitor Sprint’s – is based on Qualcomm’s CDMA technology. The alternative GSM technology is widely used elsewhere in the world. Till recently, customers of Verizon Wireless could use their BlackBerrys only in a few countries outside North America – for example, Japan and Korea. However, Verizon has solved the problem by recently launching its service for the Black- Berry 8830 World Edition which enables Verizon customers to roam seamlessly anywhere in the world. This is another example of Verizon’s ceaseless endeavor to anticipate and meet incipient customer demand. The United States is today the world’s second largest mobile phone market (275 million cellular phones) after China (487 million cellular phones). India is rapidly catching up (180 million cellular phones), adding an average of six million new mobile phone connections every month compared to just over two million new mobile phones in the U.S. Verizon may be a young company – just over seven years old – but it has a powerful lineage and strong inherited leadership. Seidenberg and his senior executives have based Verizon’s growth strategy on three pillars: the development of cutting-edge technology; anticipating the market’s rapidly changing demands as the global hunger for delivery of information and entertainment over mobile phones deepens; and three, developing insights into new wireless trends – including G-4 services – that will drive Verizon’s future. It is a future replete with promise.",

Verizon Business focuses on disaster recovery through its network. On December 26, 2006, an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale hit Taiwan, damaging eight major under-sea cables in 22 locations. Communications to hundreds of people were disrupted with Taiwan, Hong Kong and China being most affected. All major voice and data routes to Asia were interrupted. Verizon Business restored critical network traffic within 12 hours and maintained full network connectivity on its private IP network. It restored part of the public IP network to Taiwan within 24 hours.\n\nLess than a week after 9/11, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) began trading again. Within three months, a phone and data network resembling the size and complexity of a Cincinnati-sized city was set up at Ground Zero. Verizon was key in these endeavors, also providing emergency services help in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon, where the terror attacks had wrecked communications facilities.\n\nThese instances display the importance of having a well-backed up data network, especially in today’s globalized environment. More and more companies are realizing the necessity of adding recovery processes to their portfolios. Recently ENGlobal Corp., a provider of engineering and professional services in the petroleum and petrochemical industries, sought recovery solutions. “Disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita remind us that recovery processes are critical for today’s data-rich businesses,” says Nancy Gofus, Senior Vice-President and Chief Marketing Officer, Verizon Business.\n\n“Our disaster planning places specific dollar figures on the loss of business continuity,” says Alex Schroeder, Manager of IT, ENGlobal. “As a technology-driven business, we take a close look at the impact of recovery on our day-to-day operations – things like information technology costs, lost worker productivity and lost customer projects.”\n\nIn 2004, Verizon’s new Chairman and CEO, Ivan Seidenberg, told the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that delivering 100 megabits of capacity to people wherever they are – at home, at work, on the go – should be the long-term goal for the communications and high-tech industries. He said: “These kinds of networks will create a platform for new applications, services and communications technologies, giving Americans even more choices in the electronic communications marketplace.”\n\nWIRELESS FUTURE\n\nCommunications technology has evolved over the years – from analog to digital, from wired to wireless platforms, from narrowband to broadband. Companies too have evolved to integrate the demand for newer technologies. Wireless services are contributing an ever-larger part of Verizon’s revenues while local wireline services are shrinking. Within the wireline market, growth has come in the areas of longdistance, data and broadband services (DSL/Digital Subscriber Lines and new optic-based services marketed under FiOS).\n\nVerizon added more than 440,000 wireline broadband customers in the second and third quarters of 2006. Of these, over 111,000 were new FiOS customers in the second quarter and 147,000 new FiOS customers in the third quarter. The future will clearly favor wireless technology with statistics indicating that the wireless solutions industry will total $1.6 trillion in 2011. The U.S. will be the biggest telecommunications market with revenues rising to $720 billion by 2011. Markets will expand in Western Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America with revenue growth particularly high in Latin America over the next few years.\n\nIn such an environment, Verizon with its quick and practical strategies will thrive. Verizon’s Wireless cellular service – like competitor Sprint’s – is based on Qualcomm’s CDMA technology. The alternative GSM technology is widely used elsewhere in the world. Till recently, customers of Verizon Wireless could use their BlackBerrys only in a few countries outside North America – for example, Japan and Korea. However, Verizon has solved the problem by recently launching its service for the Black- Berry 8830 World Edition which enables Verizon customers to roam seamlessly anywhere in the world. This is another example of Verizon’s ceaseless endeavor to anticipate and meet incipient customer demand."
