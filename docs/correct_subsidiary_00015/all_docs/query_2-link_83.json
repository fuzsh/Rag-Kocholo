The divestiture fractured this monolithic system as it forced the PUCs to respond to new forces unleashed in their own backyards. Soon there was great diversity in the overall regulatory landscape. Within this new environment, there is considerable disparity among the PUCs in terms of their ability to implement new ideas. This paper seeks to understand the structural factors that influence the latitude of regulatory action by PUCs via a comparative study of local telephone competition policy making in Arkansas and New York. The analysis suggests that the presence or absence of countervailing forces determines the relative autonomy the PUCs enjoy and thereby their ability to introduce new ideas into their states.\n\nPUC Autonomy and Policy Innovation:\n\nLocal Telephone Competition in Arkansas and New York\n\nContext\n\nIn the pre-divestiture environment, the state Public Utility Commissions (PUCs) did not play a very visible role in the regulation of the telephone industry in the United States. While they had jurisdiction over intrastate telephone service, they operated for the most part as the proverbial cogs in a fairly unified national regulatory system. Typically, the FCC set the course by formulating federal policies and the state PUCs made corresponding changes, some times after a little friction, in their intrastate policies so as to harmonize the overall system. As Glen Robinson, former FCC Commissioner (1974-1976) recounts:\n\nThe state regulatory presence became more noticeable in the 1970s, though I cannot honestly say I, as an FCC Commissioner, noticed it much. Perhaps it was my parochial attitude to think that all actionsuch as it wastook place at the federal level. It seemed to me, at the time, that the states principal role was to quarrel with the FCC over how much local service should be cross-subsidized by rates on interstate service (Robinson, 1991, p. 83).\n\nFor the most part, the interests of the PUCs were limited to ensuring affordable rates for residential local telephone (Briesemeister & Horrigan, 1989). Accordingly, they remained preoccupied with the intricacies of the separations procedures that determined the amount of subsidies that the local service would get from long distance. Although there were differences among the PUCs in terms of their composition and the way they conducted their business, these were relatively small compared to the similarities in their policies. In effect, the 50 state PUCs and the FCC worked as a single monolithic system.\n\nThe divestiture turned this placid world on its head. According to Neilsen Cochran, MPSC (Mississippi Public Service Commission) commissioner, \"the majority of the commissioners and staff throughout the country were ill-prepared for the divestiture of AT&T\" (Cochran, 1986, p. 13). After having operated in the background for 75 years, the divestiture thrust the PUCs into the limelight as the \"venue shopping\" Baby Bells brought their problems to them sensing a more sympathetic hearing there than at national fora where AT&T had considerable influence (Bonnett, 1996; Teske, 1990). Also, while the divestiture partially resolved some of the national issues, it created many new ones at the state level (Teske, 1990). Somewhat shell-shocked at the sudden paradigm change, the PUCs reflex reaction was to grab at their old issue, universal service, with even greater fervor. In the words of Neilsen Cochran, Mississippi Public Service Commission commissioner, \"The preservation of local exchange service is my number-one priority, and this newly created environment must be treated as cautiously as one would handle a loaded gun\" (Cochran, 1986, p. 13). Soon, the PUCs found themselves at odds with the FCC over universal service and other issues. Furthermore, as different interest groups realized the importance of telecommunications in the new economy, local politicians stepped into an arena that had earlier been a preserve of technocrats. The PUCs could no longer afford to limit themselves to narrow accounting matters. As Charles Stalon, Commissioner, Illinois Commerce Commission, noted in 1984, one of the major casualties of divestiture was the form of regulation (1) employed by the PUCs.\n\nMy view, stated briefly, is that the blow is fatal although artificial life-support mechanisms provided by the industry and the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) may preserve appearances of life for some time to come. Note carefully my argument is not that state regulation by Public Utility Commissions (PUCs) is fatally wounded. That question is still open. My argument is that the current forms of such regulation are fatally wounded. Dramatic changes in both purposes and procedures are going to be necessary if PUC regulation is not to become a meaningless paper shuffle (Stalon, 1984, p. 28).\n\nIn order to stay relevant, the PUCs had to radically re-orient themselves. Among other things, they had to very significantly increase their in-house expertise, as they could no longer afford to simply mirror FCC initiatives. In 1969 Minnesota Public Service Commission had a \"grand total of three persons assigned to the telephone-telegraph division responsible for regulating the local telephone company, Northwestern Bell. Of those three, one was a secretary, one an accountant, and the other a person of no particular calling who was assigned the task of reading Northwestern Bells annual reports and other published materials\" (Robinson, 1991, p. 82). More importantly, for the purposes of our discussion, it is important to note that Minnesota was not an unusual state. At that point in time, Texas did not even have a PUC. (2) Quite obviously, this level of \"regulation\" would not suffice in the post-divestiture environment.\n\nThe PUCs had to enhance their capabilities to regulate in the changed circumstances. Correspondingly, they had to learn how to deal with issues such as bypass, interconnection, and privacy, which required a very different vocabulary and approach than traditional rate of return regulation. Furthermore, they had to learn to deal with new stakeholders such as economic development agencies and governors that urged the PUCs to provide incentives for network investments in targeted areas. Here they were called on to assume a degree of activism they were not accustomed to. As the PUCs re-oriented themselves in the new environment, they developed their own unique personalities and in the process fractured the earlier monolithic regulatory system and replaced it with a highly variegated one. The regulatory philosophies they developed and the issues that preoccupied them were colored by local concerns.\n\nWhile the country had become long accustomed to the monolithic regulatory system of the pre-divestiture era, it was an alien arrangement in a country that celebrates \"dividing and diffusing sovereignty\" (Boorstin, 1966, p. 400). In many ways, it was a product of one of the major tensions that have shaped American history: coexistence of political decentralization and economic centralization. If it were not for the nation-wide Bell System, there would have been no monolithic regulatory system in the pre-divestiture era. As Robinson (1991) points out, \"With the entire system of local exchange and interstate service dominated by a single firm, it was relatively simple to shuffle costs of the former to the latter, and with that shuffle to transfer the main burden of regulation to the FCC\" (p. 83). Although the post-divestiture chaos looked very unnatural to observers like von Auw (1983), it was \"essentially a recent manifestation of a deep-seated cultural pattern. The dispersion of political authority is something fundamental to the American character\" (Sawhney, 1993, p. 506). In sum, the post-divestiture regulatory chaos and not the pre-divestiture monolithic system, whose demise is often lamented, is in keeping with the polycentricity of the American political culture (Sawhney, 1993).\n\nFinally, with the demise of the old order, the telecommunications policy making started looking similar to other areas of public importance such as education, health care, and welfare. Take, for example, the case of education where there are more than 16,000 school districts, each of which zealously guards its independence. On this \"quilted topography,\" the Department of Education in Washington, DC has had to tread gingerly since many people question its very legitimacy (Sawhney, 1994). No wonder, most innovations in education occur bottom-up rather than top-down. In the post-divestiture environment, we see a similar process underway. The PUCs have become what Justice Brandeis called \"laboratories of democracy.\" \"Brandeis's phrase captured the peculiar, pragmatic genius of the federal system. As one approach to governmentone political paradigmwears thin, its successor is molded in the states, piece by piece. The process has little to do with ideology and everything to do with trial-and-error, seat-of-the-pants pragmatism\" (Osborne, 1993, p. 3). The peculiar conditions within a state often prompt the PUCs to take steps which are later hailed as major innovations. For instance, the community-and consensus-oriented culture in Vermont enabled it to develop \"social contract\" (3) as a means of regulating its telephone companies. Other states developed other methods such as rate caps, flexible regulation, incentive regulation, and competitive pricing (Briesemeister and Horrigan, 1989; Davis, 1995). In general, \"some states have been more innovative than the FCC in deregulatory approaches, such as with respect to intrastate tolls and in substituting price regulation for the traditional rate-of-return method\" (Henry Geller quoted in Bonnett, 1996, p. 74). Because of this innovative activity, the once bureaucratic PUCs came to be viewed as policy laboratories.\n\nRegulatory Autonomy\n\nWhile the overall picture suggests widespread innovation, there is considerable disparity among the PUCs. On one end, there are states that have repeatedly made conceptual breakthroughs. On the other end, there are those that have had difficulty introducing changes even when there is widespread consensus that the old paradigm is not appropriate for the changed telecommunications environment. Quite obviously, the reasons for these differences are complex as the circumstances vary from state to state. Although a whole host of factors involving the PUCs, legislatures, and courts influence a states stance on local competition, the objectives of this paper are somewhat narrowly circumscribed. We are interested in understanding the structural factors that influence the latitude of regulatory action by the PUCs and thereby impact their ability to introduce new ideas into their states. Sikkink (1991), while writing about Brazil and Argentina, observed: \"insulated bureaucracy governed by merit criteria and with significant personnel continuity, made it easier for ideas to become embedded in state institutions . . . institutions with little autonomy or continuity are much less likely to become carriers of influential ideas\" (p. 249). Correspondingly, within our own context, the suggestion is that the PUCs ability to generate and implement new ideas is largely dependent on whether or not it has \"relative autonomy\" (4) from state politics. The importance of regulatory autonomy for policy innovation leads to our research question: What factors are influential in securing the \"relative autonomy\" of the PUCs?\n\nThis paper employs a comparative study of the debate on local telephone competition (5) in two states to address this question. We chose to study local telephone competition for two main reasons. One, the thinking behind local telephone competition represents nothing short of a paradigm shift. In the pre-divestiture days, when the natural monopoly paradigm reigned unchallenged, the idea of local telephone competition was not even considered a possibility. Today, it has been widely embraced as the new paradigm across the nation. In other words, it is not an idiosyncratic local innovation of a particularistic nature but a universalistic idea that has been implement (implemented) in diverse states with varying conditions. (6) Second, relative to other policy innovations, it has a fairly long history which makes it ripe for study, making comparisons possible across jurisdictions. New York started the trend towards local telephone competition in 1986 by allowing Teleport Communications Groups (TCG) to compete with New York Telephone. Illinois followed suit in 1988. Thereafter the momentum towards competition picked up when Michigan, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Washington, Maryland, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania adopted pro-competition policies in 1994. Another batch of 17 states (7) passed legislation to introduce competition in the local telephone service in 1995 while the issue was being discussed at the federal level. After the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Indiana, Kansas, New Jersey, Idaho, and many other states adopted local telephone competition policies. Yet, there were other states such as Arkansas and Alaska that were bucking the trend and holding out against competition at the time of the conclusion of this study in 1999.\n\nFor our paper, we chose to study the local telephone debate in Arkansas, a state that has not allowed competition, and New York, the first state to adopt competitive policies. While other states would also have been appropriate for our study, we chose Arkansas and New York because the contrast between the \"relative autonomy\" of their PUCs is quite striking. In both states, the PUCs embraced local telephone competition. So, as far as the acceptance of the idea of local telephone competition by the PUCs was concerned, both the states were similarly situated. The key difference between the two states was in the ability of their respective PUCs to implement the new idea they have embraced. While the New York PUC was able to blaze a trail when the idea was still new, the Arkansas PUC was unable to implement it even when it was widely accepted as the new paradigm across the country. As we will see from the case discussion, the \"relative autonomy\" of the PUCs was a key difference between the two states.\n\nRole of Ideas in the Policy-making Process\n\nThere is a vast literature on regulatory theory. The economic theories of regulation assume that human beings behave as rational utility maximizers who pursue their own political and financial interests (Huntington, 1952; Bernstein, 1955; Noll, 1971; Peltzman, 1975). Stigler observes that \"regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit\" (Stigler, 1971, p. 3). According to this strain of economic theory, which is known as the capture theory, profit-maximizing businesses seek wealth transfers from the government and, in turn, give politicians campaign resources. Most political theories of regulation focus either on interest groups or on the state and other political institutions. In the interest group approach, the institutions, such as legislatures, executive offices, and governmental agencies, are seen as responding to pressures by social actors and then translating their interests into outcomes. This approach assumes that political collectivities form around naturally occurring economic groups; that these groups express and pursue objective material interests (8); and that policy choices reflect the relative political clout of competing groups (Landes & Posner, 1975; Marvel, 1977; McCormick & Tollison, 1981; Moe, 1987). Lowi (1969), for instance, describes policy-making process as a \"parallelogram of forces\" among groups where \"the public interest is determined and established through the free competition of interest groups\" (p. 75).\n\nThe statists regard the state as an autonomous structure with its own distinct history and, perhaps, its own distinct interests (Carnoy, 1984; Coleman, 1996; Katzenstein, 1978; Krasner, 1978; Schmidt, 1997; Tilly, 1975). They argue that the cross-national variations in public policies stem from the degree to which a) state officials form a cohesive group capable of articulating their own policy prescriptions, b) the ability of state officials to resist societal pressures, c) the ability of state officials to elicit the cooperation of private actors, and d) the administrative capacities of the state (Evans, Rueschemeyer, & Skocpol, 1985).\n\nIn the traditional approaches, ideas are considered purely exogenous variables in the policy-making process, without paying much attention as to why those specific ideas matter. Hence institutionalists tend to overlook the role of ideas in the policy-making process. Recently, attempts have been made by neo-institutionalists (9) to incorporate the role of ideas in the study of policy making. As Cooper et al (1989) have shown in the case of health care, ideas are not always available when they are needed, and even if they are found in one polity, they are often ignored in the next. In the same vein, Hall (1989a) asks: Why is one set of ideas influential at one place and time but not at another? What are the processes whereby new ideas acquire influence in policy making? Sikkink (1991) suggests that that degree of acceptance of an idea depends on the existing ideological conditions, the manner in which the new ideas are introduced, and the institutional support for the new ideas (p. 21). Moore (1988) makes a distinction between intellectual and contextual properties of ideas. Intellectual properties are a normative conception of how the society should deal with a particular problem, and perhaps even the methods used to produce the idea\" (p. 78). The contextual properties of an idea have to do with how it fits within an ongoing historical discussion of a particular problem and how it accommodates or challenges the current politics of a given issue and the new interests that are advanced or retarded by the idea (p. 78-79). Hence an idea does not mean the same thing in different settings. Hall (1989b) observes that,\n\nMany complex sets of ideas are ambiguous and far from immediately comprehensible. In these cases, interpretation is a necessary prerequisite to understanding; and to make such interpretations, individuals tend to refer to an existing stock of knowledge that is generally conditioned by prior historical experience. Hence, the same set of ideas can be interpreted quite differently in settings where the relevant historical experiences diverge (p. 370).\n\nIn the following case studies, we will see how the different settings in Arkansas and New York led to very different receptions to the idea of local telephone competition introduced by their PUCs. The initial sections in each case study describe what happened in that state on matters regarding competition. And then, the last section analyzes how the characteristics of the institutional arrangements in which the PUCs are embedded interact with actors resources to influence PUCs latitude in dealing with the idea of competition. The bulk of the discussion in both case studies is devoted to the interaction between the four main policy playersthe governor, the legislature, the incumbent local telephone companies, and the PUC. The amount of attention the other players such as competitors, users, and press get varies with their presence and influence in each state.\n\nArkansas: Interests-centered Modus Operandi(10)\n\nAround 1995, when a number of states adopted competition, the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC) recognized the growing importance of the trend toward competition. Thereafter, the APSC made efforts to open the local telephone market in spite of strong resistance from incumbent local carriers. However, it did not make any headway because of the legislatures intervention. The legislators wanted to shape policies regarding competition themselves. Within this context, this case study explores why the APSC, which has jurisdiction over telecommunications, had little say in the formulation of competition policy in Arkansas. The focus is on contextual factors which undermined APSCs autonomy and thereby made it ineffective in the policy-making process.\n\nWhite Water Inquiry's Aftermath\n\nIn 1995, Former Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker sought to give APSC some latitude for paving its way towards competition in local telephone markets. He said:\n\nThere could be a real legislative fight. What I expect to see is continued debate between all of these various interests. But my hope is that a greater, comprehensive new statute can be adopted that gives the PSC a great deal of flexibility and allows it to foster competition and to move toward a deregulatory climate. (David & Tyler, 1995, p. 1)\n\nThe former governors strong support for the APSC could have increased Arkansass chances of adopting and implementing a competitive regulatory framework.\n\nWithin this context, the APSC allowed American Communications Services Incorporated of Little Rock (ACSI) to offer private line and special access telecommunications services, even though there was considerable resistance from Southwestern Bell which claimed that the resulting loss of traffic due to bypass would increase residential rates. (11) As evident in this decision, the APSC was positively predisposed towards competition and was willing to move in that direction. (12) The following remark by Sarah Bradshaw, Chief Administrative Law Judge, captures the APSCs thinking at that time:\n\nThe services ACSI proposes will not be just privately but publicly beneficial as well. ACSI will provide customers a state-of-the-art network designed to meet the needs of an increasingly information-intensive economy providing a reliable system for the transmission of data and information at competitive prices . . . an enhanced telecommunications infrastructure in the state may attract business in Arkansas. (Moreau, 1995, p. 1D)\n\nDespite strong resistance from incumbent local telephone companies, the APSC began to open the door for competition in a systematic way during Governor Jim Guy Tuckers tenure. It held several public hearings on the appropriate common carrier line (CCL) charge and other competition related issues (Arkansas Public Service Commission, 1996a).\n\nHowever, the White Water inquiry deprived the APSC of political support required for the introduction of competition as Jim Guy Tucker had to hand over the governorship to Mike Huckabee, the then Lieutenant Governor. Huckabee became the third Republican governor since the Reconstruction in a state long dominated by the Democrats. Furthermore, the fact that he was selected by the legislators and not directly elected by the people limited his political power. As a result of the weakness in the administrative branch, legislators had a free rein over policy decisions. If there had been a strong governor who supported competition, the result would have been different. (13) The withdrawal of Jim Guy Tucker from the policy arena forestalled the formation of a task force like the one in the New York, handing over the policy-making process to the legislators.\n\nIn this context, Huckabee decided to defer to the wishes of the legislature. Accordingly, Huckabee made it known via his spokesman, Rex Nelson, that he would not comment on the activities of the legislature until a bill reached his desk. Nelson said, If there are any problems, hes confident theyll be taken care of in the legislative process\" (Moreau, 1997, p. 10A). This lack of support from the governor allowed the legislature to exercise control over APSC.\n\nReconsideration of the Idea of Competition\n\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 prompted two groups, incumbent local carriers and the prospective new entrants, to propose competing bills that were strikingly different in their attitude towards the APSC. Teletruth Arkansas, an organization of pro-competition interests, (14) insisted that the APSC must continue its supervision of large local telephone companies until there was full competition for their services, while Arkansas Telephone Association (ATA) represented incumbent local carriers who wanted to remove regulatory oversight by the commission.\n\nAlong with the conflict between the incumbent local carriers and TeleTruth, there were two important relationships that structured the debate in Arkansas. First, as the process unfolded, the legislators distrust of APSC kept increasing. Second, a relationship between legislators and the incumbent local carriers, especially rural ones, developed. In addition, the new governors unwillingness to intervene and his deference to the legislature further weakened APSCs position. In a state where pro-competition interests lacked clout, the governors stand on the issue was of critical importance since he was the only player in the policy-making process who could have checked the strong anti-competition forces in the legislature.\n\nIn many ways, the following statement by APSC Chairman Sam Bratton was the flash point of the showdown between APSC and the legislators:\n\nShould the commission fail to follow the federal act, the state will lose its authority over telecommunications regulation. It would be appropriate for the commission to begin considering alternatives to the rate system now used by telephone companies. (Caldwell, 1996, p. 1D)\n\nBrattons suggestion that the legislators limit their role in the formulation of competition policy infuriated them. Legislators began to argue that the APSC was just a regulatory body, not a policy-making body or an advisory agency. (15) Representative Irma Hunter Brown contended that the only body that could make policies was the legislature (Caldwell, 1996). In light of this sentiment, the Telecommunications Subcommittee of the House and Senate Interim Committee on Insurance and Commerce wrote a joint letter to APSC asking it not to issue any order or docket related to competition and universal service until they completed their own study of the implications of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. (16) Yielding to legislative pressure, the APSC issued Order No. 49 in Docket No. 86-159-U, stating that all tariffs and other matters are hereby suspended pending further action by the Committees and order of the Commission (Arkansas Public Service Commission, 1996b). Thus the APSC was deterred from working on any issues related to competition.\n\nFurthermore, legislators began to question whether the commission had outlived its usefulness in supervising telecommunications. For instance, State Senator Nick Wilson proposed to divest the APSC of its power to regulate telephone companies. (Moreau, 1996a). According to Interviewee A, who preferred to remain anonymous, there was a close relationship between legislators and incumbent local telephone companies. Both the rural companies appeal to legislators to protect them from competition and ATAs warnings of increased residential rates solidified the relationship between them.\n\nWhen ATA proposed competition-related legislation in 1997, Sam Bratton, APSC Chairman, opposed this proposal because it would allow local phone companies to increase rates with less regulatory scrutiny (Moreau, 1996a, p. 1G). Yet, APSC did nothing more than voice its opposition to ATAs proposed legislation. In the words of Sam Bratton, \"I think we have been trying to be responsive to what we were asked to do. The commission has offered no opinion on how it would prefer to regulate competitors\" (Moreau, 1996b, p. 1G). Sarah Bradshaw, APSCs Chief Administrative Law Judge, added: all weve done is what we were asked to do, analyze the proposals. Its up to the legislators to decide which recommendations they want to utilize\" (Moreau, 1996c, p. 1D). Furthermore, a bill proposed by TeleTruth, which would have provided another point of view to the legislators, was withdrawn because it could not find a sponsor who had the political clout to ensure its survival in the legislature. (17)\n\nIn Arkansas, we find that there was no strong political sponsor of APSCs program to introduce competition. Also, the APSC, which had the professional expertise, was deterred from participating in the competition debate in any meaningful way. The result was that the legislators were greatly influenced by interests groups. The Arkansas Senate and the House of Representatives approved ATAs bill by 32-1 and 92-3 margin, respectively. On Ferbruary 4, 1997, Governor Huckabee signed the bill into law as the Arkansas Telecommunications Regulatory Reform Act of 1997.\n\nAs a result of 158-years of dominance of state politics by the Democrats, Arkansas has a weak Republican Party. In the absence of a vigorous opposition, the Democratic Partys political machine has long dominated the policy-making process. The accompanying patron-client relationships have enabled the close interaction between capitalistic government and business interests without adequate scrutiny (Hunt, 1994, p. A12). This institutional structure tilted towards the Democrats has created a policy arena in which governors have played a rather limited role in Arkansas history. (18)\n\nInterests-driven Policy Making\n\nThis section analyzes the contextual factors within which the APSC became an ineffective agency. It examines how institutional arrangements (19) interacted with actors in the policy process to produce interests-driven policy, thus providing the incumbent local carriers with advantages over the prospective carriers.\n\nTelecommunications policy in Arkansas is largely determined by material interests stemming from the close relationship between incumbent local carriers and legislators instead of theoretical analysis of policy ideas by a governmental agency with professional expertise. An APSC official, who preferred to remain anonymous, summed up the situation very well by saying: We do not have anything to say about this issue. Legislators took away everything from us.\" (20) In Arkansas, institutional arrangements, which mediate between agent and social structure/culture, are totally geared towards giving overwhelming power to legislators and the local interest groups with respect to other players in the policy process. These institutional arrangements reflect the states social structure which privileges personal rather than performance-based relationships:\n\nPower and politics in Arkansas are highly personalized. Power itself is seen as personal, not institutional or organizational. Unlike in many states, where control of local economic institutions long ago passed into the control of anonymous corporate and financial forces, many Arkansans can still tell you who the people are that own and operate the states major businesses, whose names grace the letterhead of the Arkansas Business Council. Politics are seen as personalized, affiliational, informal: not what you know but who you know, who you have access to, who owes you on the patch-quilt of relationships that seem to determine both position and power in a small town state. (Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, 1989, p. 7 and 9)\n\nIn a society where personal relationships are more important than institutional ones, an innovative idea, even though it may be thought to be beneficial to society, will not be accepted unless it has the support of the right people. Typically, whether or not an innovative policy idea is adopted depends on personal persuasion rather than theoretical merit. (21) This attitude is very evident in the following quote from an address by a legislator who served on the telecommunications subcommittee:\n\nThe real problem was TeleTruth seemed to be relying on the Arkansas PSC. Also, I was amazed by that through this whole long process, the long-distance people never contacted me, never sat down with me. I dont understand it. (Spillenger, 1997, p. 26)\n\nThe above statement shows that, as observed in institutional structure, the patron-client relationship structures the policy-making process in Arkansas.\n\nIn addition to a personal relationship oriented culture, there are few telecommunications-intensive industries in Arkansas which could counteract the power of local carriers. Most businesses in Arkansas are either agricultural or manufacturing in nature. Telecommunications-intensive industries, such as communications and services industries, comprise only about 10% of the Arkansas gross product even though the percentage has gradually increased over the years (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2001). Furthermore, except for the American Association of Retired Persons State Legislative Committee, there has been no major involvement of consumer groups on behalf of residential users. Finally, the media environment in Arkansas is dominated by local press, Arkansas Democrat Gazette in particular, which reports developments related to local competition without questioning the agendas of the main players. Consequently, voices different from the local carriers have only a slight chance to be heard by the legislators. From this observation, one can gather that there is no important Arkansas based constituency pushing for competitive telecommunications service, and therefore, there is a lack of interest and pressure from non-governmental entities to block the powers of both the legislators and local carriers. (22)\n\nNew York: Theoretical Analysis-centered Modus Operandi\n\nThe New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) was very aggressive compared to APSC, in implementing competition in local telephone markets. Unlike Arkansas, the NYPSC implemented competitive policies in New York without any involvement of the legislature. The NYPSCs approach to competition might be characterized as innovatively neutral. It was neutral in the sense that it tried to balance, so as to build consensus, the sometimes competing interests of incumbent local exchange companies, new entrants, and other affected constituencies (New York Public Service Commission, 1996). It was innovative in the sense that it started gradually introducing competition in the early 1980syears before other states. New Yorks approach has been characterized as cautious pro-deregulation; instead of a headlong rush for deregulation\" (Jennings & Sawhney, 1989, p. 119).\n\nBackground for the Emergence of Competition\n\nThis section provides an overview of the overall context within which policy innovations took place in New York. It analyzes the structural factors that enabled NYPSC to assume a leadership role in the policy-making process without any interference from other forces.\n\nThe story of competition in New York is closely tied to that of the Teleport. In 1983, Merrill Lynch set up Teleport, a satellite earth station farm, for itself and other financial firms, in Staten Island so as to get away from the microwave congestion in Manhattan. The project included a fiber optic network to connect offices in Manhattan to the earth stations in Staten Island. While the earth station business never took off, Merrill Lynch found that it had created a valuable asset in the fiber optic network. The firms in Manhattan were very interested in using Teleports network to bypass NYNEX, the incumbent local carrier, and connect directly to long-distance service providers. Sensing considerable business potential in its fiber optic network, it vigorously sought and gained regulatory approvals to serve the needs of large and medium-sized businesses in New York City (Jennings & Sawhney, 1989). Thus local telephone competition in New York was triggered inadvertently by the establishment of Teleport, a project set up with the objective of improving satellite communication rather than breaking NYNEXs local telephone monopoly.\n\nSince many large businesses started using Teleport and other CAP (Competitive Access Providers) facilities as backup networks, NYNEX introduced a new disaster avoidance service that allowed corporations to run separate lines to central office switches. David Granoff, Director of System Planning for the Commodity Exchange, remarked that the service I've received from NYNEX this year is much better than what I had before. It's like a whole new company\" (Edmund, 1991, p. 1). Observing the growing subscription rates of CAPs and efforts by incumbent local carriers to enhance their own network capabilities, the NYPSC sought to encourage competition by requiring NYNEX to connect the networks of the aspiring rivals to the public telephone network. (23) It believed that interconnection of competitive networks to the public network would bring down rates and provide consumers access to state-of-the-rate technologies. (24) Thus the combination of market factors and technological developments convinced the NYPSC that the old regulatory system needed to be changed. It thereby embarked on a path that would make it a trailblazer in local telephone competition policies.\n\nTheoretical Analysis-centered Modus Operandi\n\nNew York is really the microcosm of how competition will be developing in other areas,\" claimed Roger Cawley, Teleports spokesman, in 1994 (Local Competition Report, 1994). The trend-setting reform in New York was initiated and implemented by the states Public Service Commission. The legislature did not play an important role in addressing competition-related issues. (25) This unique situation, which provides a lesson for other states, might be explained by the \"vast autonomy\" from New York politics the NYPSC has historically enjoyed. Without interference from politicians, innovative thinkers in the NYPSC were able to introduce a competitive paradigm that could serve as a model for other states.\n\nWhat kinds of institutional factors were influential in making the NYPSC an effective regulatory agency compared to APSC? On one level, most actors in the telecommunications policy process in New York think that complex telecommunications issues should be taken care of by a regulatory agency because they require expert knowledge. On another level, diverse countervailing forces (26) check each other, consequently no powerful interest group can exert its clout over the telecommunications policy-making process. (27) As Dennis Taratus of Telecommunications Exchange Group observes, New York has a lot of horses for legislators to pull. (28) Policy makers, aware of the political pitfalls of public utility issues, stay away from them and thereby give the experts a free rein.\n\nIn addition, the New York governorship is strong enough to counteract other actors via both formal power and political entrepreneurship. Since New York governorship has historically been a springboard for presidential aspirants, the states governors have tended to view New Yorks problems as national ones. Hence the mindset in New York is very different from that of small states whose governors aspire to the Senate, resulting in a narrower point of view. (29) Also, the formal grants of institutional authority that make the New York governorship one of the most powerful in the nation include four-year terms without limits on reelection, vast powers to make appointments, a large budget, and broad fiscal responsibilities. Thus New York governorship is yet another countervailing force that restrains the power of the legislature.\n\nFurthermore, Governor Cuomo was quite aware of the importance of telecommunications for New Yorks economic development. He argued that just as the Erie Canal and the railroads that followed it a century and a half ago helped make New York become the commercial capital of the world, so too the information highway can establish its dominant position in the 21st century (Cuomo, 1993).\n\nIn a message to the New York legislature, he stated:\n\nNew Yorks economic competitiveness requires a strong infrastructure of roads, rails, bridges, and now, in the information age, telecommunications infrastructure. To take stronger, quicker steps to accelerate the deployment of new telecommunications technologies throughout the State, I am asking Public Service Commission Chair Peter Bradford, to develop the Telecommunications Exchange which will guide the modernization of telecommunications infrastructure and services in New York State. (30)\n\nThe institutional arrangements in New York allowed Governor Cuomo to staff the Telecommunications Exchange Group with experts instead of politicians. This task force proposed guidelines for telecommunications regulation and helped forge a political coalition for competition in the local telephone market. Most important policy makers came to believe that competition in the local telephone market was necessary for the development of an advanced telecommunications network. According to Lieutenant Governor Stan Lundine, who served as the chair of the Telecommunications Exchange Group:\n\nNew York needs to have the best telecommunications system in the world. The best way to get to this is through competition, not regulation. I believe the report will lead to a nationwide competitive model. (Bernstein, 1993)\n\nThe report published by the Telecommunications Exchange Group (1993), Connecting to the Future, recommended that the state ease regulation and stimulate competition in the telecommunications industry to help create new jobs in New York.\n\nWhen it comes to factors that structure the latitude of the NYPSC, the countervailing forces of diverse interest groups prevent the emergence of a coalition among politicians, regulatory agencies, and industry interests. (31) Such a grand coalition can survive only when the political culture encourages campaign contributions, political appointments, and the movement of personnel between public and private sectors. Also, in a highly centralized legislative system, like the one in New York, party\n\ninterests take precedence over interest groups agendas because Majority Leaders and Speakers of the House appoint the chairs of subcommittees (Peterson, 1990). Furthermore, the Republican-dominated Senate and the Democratic-dominated House of Representatives are often at loggerheads. The resulting stalemate in the legislative process often leaves important decisions in the hands of governmental agencies. (32)\n\nFinally, an important factor that contributes to an unbiased policy-making process is the public scrutiny by the New York based national and international press. (33) An aggressive press tends to be a good check on special interests influence on government policy. Also, the disproportionately large number of attorneys in New York is an important factor. Generally, incumbent local telephone companies in small states tend to have more information than both new entrants and regulatory agencies and thereby wield undue influence over the policy-making process. However, in New York, most interest groups have access to attorneys with expertise in telecommunications issues and therefore are in a better position to compete with incumbent local carriers. (34)\n\nSince telecommunications issues are not only complex but also politically contentious, politicians in New York have tended to leave them to the experts. As a result, in most cases, New York governors have regularly appointed experts and not political operatives on the commission. Furthermore, most legislators do not pay much attention to the commissions activities because they trust its competence in dealing with telecommunications issues. (35) Conversely, because of their expertise, most commissioners do not care about what both the governor and the legislators would like them to do. (36)\n\nConclusion\n\nWhy there is variation in the way in which the idea of competition is treated in Arkansas and New York? As the analysis shows, as soon as different policy players within a state begin to evaluate a new policy idea as well as interpret and internalize institutional arrangements, a policy window opens. Then the interaction between institutional arrangements and policy players starts to take place. Within the bounded setting of the institutional arrangements, policy players pursue their material interests based on their evaluation of a new policy idea. In other words, policy players determine what kinds of economic stakes they can acquire by pushing the new policy idea in directions that would be favorable to them. The players agendas tend to vary based on their perceptions of the new idea and their assessment of their own structural resources. As soon as the material interests they will pursue are decided, policy players start to search for the best strategy within the bounded setting of their interpretations of institutional arrangements. Consequently, there arise interactions between policy players interpretations of institutional arrangements and the material interests they seek to obtain.\n\nBroadly, there are two very different material interests that are impacted by competition:1) preservation of universal service (37) via maintenance of the status quo, and 2) promotion of efficiency through the introduction of competition in the local carrier market. Most policy players are divided in their positions on this issue. The legislature and the incumbent local carriers embrace universal service in order to protect the local carrier markets while the prospective local carriers try to open up these markets with the promise of increased efficiency. How these two material interests are discussed in the policy process is greatly influenced by both policy players interpretations of institutional arrangements and their structural resources.\n\nIn Arkansas, most policy players perceive that personal relationships are very important in influencing the policy process. Hence community-oriented discourse to protect the local interests is dominant in the discussion on competition related issues. Instead of promoting efficiency by opening up the local carrier markets, the ways in which the incumbent local carriers can be protected in the new deregulatory environment are the primary concern of policy makers. While most legislators tend to consider their constituents interests due to their close relationships with them, the more professional commission tends to emphasize efficiency that can be achieved by opening up local telephone markets. In this context, policy players recognize inter-subjectively that policy making has to be done by the legislature and not by the commission. Furthermore, the commissions role has to be limited to the implementation of the dictates of the legislature. These interpretations combine with the general characteristic of institutional arrangements, namely, personal-relationship-driven policy making, to produce policies which give advantage to the incumbent local carriers.\n\nAs opposed to Arkansas, New Yorks institutional arrangements emphasize performance-driven policy making. Hence discourse on restructuring telecommunications regulations to promote economic development is dominant in the policy-making process. Within this environment, power and norms are inter-subjectively interpreted in such a way that telecommunications policy has to be created by the commission because it has the required expertise. Also, because of the balance of resources between policy players, politicians do not want to interfere with the workings of the commission. Thus, with the synergy effect between institutional arrangements and the environments in which policy players are situated, the commission can actively steer telecommunications regulations based on theoretical analysis of telecommunications issues.\n\nThe way in which the policy idea held by the commission is structured in the policy process greatly depends on whether or not there is a balance of power between policy players in the state who, using their own resources, try to push their views on telecommunications regulation. As observed in Arkansas, because of the absence of actors powerful enough to disrupt the established relationships, the existing institutional arrangements to a large degree determine the pattern of interaction among the policy players. That is, a lack of countervailing forces, such as other interest groups, the governor, media scrutiny, and consumer groups, increases the probability that incumbent local carriers will have an undue influence on legislators.\n\nIn New York, the chances of tight bonds between legislators and incumbent local carriers are lessened because there are countervailing forces to check against them, such as diverse industries in the telecommunications policy process. Institutional arrangements in New York ensure the relative autonomy of the commission. Consequently, the policy idea the commission holds has a high possibility of blossoming and eventually getting implemented as public policy. Interestingly, in contrast to telecommunications issues, we see an entirely different dynamic in the regulation of electricity and other energy industries in New York. (38) These differences are very illustrative. Both the legislators and the regulated energy industries interfere with the workings of the commission because of the absence of countervailing forces, such as energy-intensive industries, even though the commission staff working on electricity issues, like their telecommunications counterparts, are regarded as experts. Although the situation here is akin to that of Arkansas, the case of electric regulation is more of an exception than a rule in New York. More importantly, even this exception supports the thesis that lack of countervailing forces allows the dominant interests to unduly influence the policy-making process.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the neo-institutionalists, reacting against the tendency of traditional approaches to treat ideas as purely exogenous variables, have sought to understand the role of ideas in the policy-making process. One of their preoccupations has been the impact of contextual factors in the acceptance or rejection of a new idea by a society. They have identified factors such as existing ideological conditions, prior historical experience, and intellectual and contextual properties of ideas themselves that influence whether or not an idea is accepted (Cooper et al, 1989; Hall, 1989a, 1989b; Moore, 1988; Sikkink, 1991). Within the context of telecommunications regulation, this paper shows how regulatory autonomy also has a bearing on the ability of a state to adopt a new regulatory idea.\n\nIn sum, structural factors influence a state regulatory agencys ability to exercise its professional expertise, which in turn determines when and how a new policy idea is adopted. In other words, in states with multiple centers of initiative and diversified power structures, the regulatory agencies tend to enjoy a certain degree of autonomy because countervailing forces check each other and thereby insulate the regulatory agency from politics. However, in states with a few powerful actors, the prospects of their dominating the policy process and imposing their agendas are high since the countervailing forces are weak. The regulatory agency cannot function as an independent body (39) with regulatory jurisdiction over public utilities. Consequently, the policy choices tend to be determined by economic interests of powerful actors without a considered evaluation of the merits of a new policy idea. Based on such observations, it can be concluded that the relative autonomy of state regulatory agencies to a large extent accounts for the variations in the policy choices made by the different states on any issue in any given setting at any given time.\n\nReferences\n\nArkansas Public Service Commission (1996a).

According to Stalon (1984), while this incremental approach worked in the past when change was predictable, it is grossly inadequate for a turbulent environmental.\n\n(2) Before 1975, the regulation of telephone companies in urban areas was left to the cities, which did not have the resources to provide meaningful oversight. The telephone companies in rural areas were not regulated at all. Increasing complaints of abuse by telephone companies eventually led to the 1975 Public Utility Regulation Act which established the Texas Public Utility Commission (McCarty, 1989).\n\n(3) Briesemeister and Treuer (1989) describe Vermonts social contract as an \"agreement between the industry and the state by which the company agrees to stabilize basic phone rates and modernize plant and equipment in exchange for the elimination of rate of return regulation and the loosening of some regulatory restrictions on competitive services\" (p. 185).\n\n(4) The term \"relative autonomy\" refers to the ability of the PUC to make decisions based on its professional expertise without undue interference from the politicians.\n\n(5) Since the term \"local telephone competition\" has meant somewhat different things over time, it behooves us to chart its evolution and clearly indicate the object of our study. At first, local telephone competition was limited to competitive access providers (CAPs) who bypassed the networks of the incumbent local telephone companies and directly connected high volume business clients to the long distance carriers. The business clients found the CAPs attractive because they saved them access charges, provided connections of much higher quality than the local loop, and offered redundant routes in case of outages on the public telephone network. Later, the term was broadened to include price caps and other types of incentive regulations that gave the local telephone companies greater flexibility in their pricing decisions. Today, it refers to the provision of a wide array of competitive services at the local loop level by CLECs (competitive local exchange carriers). In this paper, our primary focus is on CLEC phase of local telephone competition.\n\n(6) Local telephone competition began as an idiosyncratic local innovation in New York. However, it was an idea that could be transferred to other contexts.\n\n(7) Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\n(8) The term \"material interests\" comes from the interest group literature. It refers to the economic and political interests pursued by different interest groups.\n\n(9) The traditional rational choice scholars, whose works were mentioned in the previous paragraph, and neo-institutionalists differ in their interpretation of the way institutions affect behavior. Rational choice scholars see actors with given preferences and beliefs pursuing objectives within a set of constraining factors (i.e. distribution of capabilities and information) and strategically interacting with other actors in accordance with a set of commonly known rules (i.e. institutions). According to neo-institutionalists, what is problematic in rational choice theories is the \"givens.\" The formation of preferences and beliefs are rarely investigated. The neo-institutionists therefore focus on ideational, normative, cultural and cognitive factors that facilitate intersubjective communication and constitute actors preferences (Immergut, 1992; Hall, 1989; King, 1992; March & Olsen, 1984, 1989).\n\n(10) Modus operandi is understood as inter-subjectively agreed upon underlying principles among policy players at a given time in a given setting which influence how the power structure deals with a policy idea.\n\n(11) Mike Sutphin, American Communications Services Incorporated, Personal Interview, February 19, 1998; Cheryl A.

This structuring occurs at two levels. The first level involves formal mechanisms such as the law that structures the relationship between governmental organizations themselves and between them and private organizations. The second level involves informal mechanisms such as custom, rules, and norms that are internalized by the participants in the policy arena.\n\n(20) Anonymous APSC staff, Telephone Interview, February 2, 1998.\n\n(21) Gregory Yielding, Arkansas Cable Telecommunications Association, Personal Interview, February 17, 1998.\n\n(22) Mike Sutphin, American Communications Services Incorporated, Personal Interview, February 19, 1998.\n\n(23) Dennis Taratus, Telecommunications Exchange Group, Personal Interview, March 9, 1998.\n\n(24) Another factor, which cannot be overlooked, is the bad reputation that NYNEX had acquired in mid 1980s because of poor service. The business community was particularly critical of NYNEXs failure to prevent outages. Also, it felt that New York Telephone had been slow in digitizing its network.
