        "text": "Recent & Ongoing Campaigns\n\nBreak up the Telecom Giants\n\nOsita Nwanevu | TNR | March 17, 2021\n\nVerizon and AT&T hold the keys to the internet for millions of Americans—and have enough power, online and off, to be just as worthy of scrutiny as the social media giants.\n\nWorkers and Elected Leaders Protest Racial Discrimination at Verizon Wireless\n\nCommunications Workers of America | October 10, 2019\n\nToday, Verizon Wireless workers and elected leaders including New York State Senator Julia Salazar and New York State Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou rallied outside the Verizon Wireless store on Wall Street to protest and deliver a 15,000-signature petition calling on Verizon to address issues of racism reported by workers around the country.\n\n'It's union busting 101': documents reveal Verizon's attacks on organized labor\n\nMichael Sainato | The Guardian | January 16, 2019\n\nUnions offer “empty promises and unrealistic expectations” and don’t act with “integrity”, according to internal documents circulated by Verizon’s human resources department and obtained by the Guardian.\n\nGroups of angry protesters are gathering outside of Verizon stores\n\nGabriel Bell | The Salon | December 8, 2017\n\nIn small groups across the country, demonstrators could be found Thursday holding up placards and chanting slogans can be found outside of Verizon stores. But, no, they weren't protesting against the carrier's hidden fees, dropped calls or lack of iPhone Xs.\n\nDon't Kill Net Neutrality\n\nVerizon Protest | December 7, 2017\n\nThe new chairman of the FCC was a top lawyer at Verizon. Now he's calling for a vote to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting at retail stores across the U.S. to demand that Congress stop Verizon’s puppet FCC from destroying the Internet as we know it.\n\nVerizon workers vote to back strike in contract dispute, if necessary\n\nAssociated Press | The Guardian | July 26, 2016\n\nVerizon workers in nine states have voted to go on strike if necessary over a dispute about a new contract, a union official said at a rally Saturday. “Our members are clear and they are determined,” said Dennis Trainor, an official with the Communications Workers of America union. “They reject management’s harsh concessionary demands.”"
