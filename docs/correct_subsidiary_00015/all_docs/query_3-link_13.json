        "text": "Frontier Communications Corporation (\"Frontier\") and Verizon Communications Inc. (\"Verizon\") seek the Commission's consent for the assignment and transfer of control of various licenses and authorizations for purposes of sections 214 and 310(d) of the Communications Act of 1934. Frontier, a widely-held and publicly traded corporation, is a full service communication provider focusing on rural areas and smaller cities and provides an array of telecommunications and broadband Internet access services through its wholly-owned operating companies in 24 states. Verizon, a widely-held and publicly traded corporation, is a full service communications provider with territories stretching across the United States and beyond. Under the contemplated transaction, Verizon will spin-off certain local exchange networks in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, and a portion of Verizon's local exchange networks in California, to a newly created and wholly-owned subsidiary, New Communications Holdings, Inc. (\"NCH\"). Verizon will make a pro rata distribution of NCH stock to Verizon shareholders, which will be immediately followed by a stock for stock merger of NCH into Frontier. After the transaction is completed, Verizon shareholders will hold 68% of the newly merged Frontier and the former Frontier shareholders will hold 32%, but with no individual or company owning or controlling 10% or more of Frontier stock. Verizon will have the right to appoint three of the nine board members and Frontier will have the right to appoint six of the nine members of the newly-merged Frontier Board of Directors.
