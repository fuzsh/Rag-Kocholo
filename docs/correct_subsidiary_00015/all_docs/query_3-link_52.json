        "text": "Verizon/MCI Merger\n\nJoint Application 05-04-020\n\nVerizon and MCI (collectively, Applicants) filed a joint application on April 21, 2005 for CPUC authority to transfer control of MCI’s California utility subsidiaries to Verizon.\n\nInitially, MCI will merge into ELI Acquisitions, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon created solely to facilitate the merger transaction. When the transaction is completed, the new company – which will be called MCI, LLC. – will be a subsidiary of Verizon.\n\nThe transaction does not involve any change or assignment of existing licenses or authorizations. As such, MCI and Verizon will continue to provide service to the public under licenses and authorizations held respectively prior to the transaction.\n\nApplicants are seeking concurrent approval from the FCC, SEC, DOJ and 23 state commissions (including the CPUC).\n\nThe merger seeks to enhance the abilities of each company to compete and provide a more comprehensive suite of services to consumers, business and government through the combined company.\n\nMCI states that its consumer business is in an irreversible decline and that it must focus on its enterprise market and Internet backbone. MCI’s substantial Internet backbone, specifically, will complement Verizon’s existing local exchange, wireless networks, and consumer market share.\n\nThe new company will deliver broadband to a greater share of the mass market and provide a full array of services using the latest technologies.\n\nMerger benefits are estimated at $8.6 million over four years with a present value of $6.2 million.\n\nApplicants believe they are exempt from Public Utility Code Sections 854(b) and (c) and that no mitigation measures or distribution of economic benefits to ratepayers are necessary.\n\nThey are nonetheless providing the Commission with full information about the nature and scope of the economic benefits associated with the merger agreement.\n\nIf required, Applicants propose two approaches to share merger benefits with ratepayers.\n\nA community project to increase broadband access in low income areas, and\n\nA surcredit on Verizon customer bills to distribute any remaining benefits.\n\nSixteen parties filed protests or responses, May 24-25, 2005:\n\nCALTEL, Covad, Cox, “Joint Intervenors” (Consumers Federation, Consumers Union, Disability Rights Advocate, Greenlining, Latino Issues Forum, TURN, and UCAN), Level 3, Navigator, ORA, Pac-West, Qwest, Telscape and XO.\n\nThe protests state that the merger is detrimental to the public interest as the combined entity would have dominant market power in retail local and long distance telecommunications services, wholesale market circuit-switched and broadband access facilities.\n\nThey contend, also, that merged company would have significant market presence in unregulated markets (wireless and advanced services).\n\nCommenters request merger conditions that will ensure California’s pro-competitive telecommunications policies are enforceable after the merger.\n\nApplicants replied to the comments on June 6, 2005.\n\nApplicants ask the Commission to reject attempts to block the transaction subject to a prolonged regulatory inquiry into onerous, unnecessary and unrelated conditions.\n\nInstead they request expeditious review and approval of the merger so benefits can be delivered quickly and so the Applicants can keep pace with technological and structural changes which are rapidly transforming the communications industry.\n\nA Prehearing Conference (PHC) will be held at the Commission on June 21, 2005.\n\nAt the PHC, Assigned ALJ Glen Walker and Assigned Commissioner Kennedy will hear the parties’ views on such procedural matters as the need for Public Participation Hearings, evidentiary hearings, and expedited discovery procedures.\n\nA scoping memo will be issued, following the PHC, setting the procedural schedule and defining the scope of the issues."
