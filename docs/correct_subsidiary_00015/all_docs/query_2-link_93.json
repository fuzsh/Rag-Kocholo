        "text": "International telecoms group Cable and Wireless (C&W) was yesterday thrust to the forefront of the burgeoning British information and entertainment market following the announcement of a complex alliance with two major cable and telecommunications companies.\n\nThe three companies - C&W, US group Nynex and Bell Canada International - said they were merging their telecoms, cable and information activities in Britain.\n\nThey will create a company called Cable and Wireless Communications to offer domestic, national, international and mobile telecommunications services, multi-channel television and Internet services.\n\nThe new company, which will become Britain's biggest cable television operator, is to be ultimately listed in London and New York.\n\nThe move means C&W will be able to offer a one-stop shop for telephone, information and entertainment services, which previously have only been available from separate companies.\n\nIt also means the company is well-placed for future interactive digital services and multimedia products as they become available.\n\nAnalysts said the move would help reduce C&W's overall reliance on earnings from 57.5 per cent-owned Hongkong Telecom, but also made it an even stronger competitor to British Telecom's dominance of the country's fixed-line market.\n\nC&W shares soared 26.5 pence, or more than 6 per cent, to 467.5 pence on the news.\n\nOn completion of the deal, C&W will own 52.6 per cent of C&W Communications, Nynex will have 18.5 per cent and Bell 14.2 per cent. The remainder will be floated.\n\nThe new business incorporates Mercury - the British subsidiary of C&W - Nynex CableComms Group, Nynex Cable Group Inc, Bell Cablemedia and Videotron Holdings, the seventh biggest cable company in Britain.\n\nVideotron is to sell its 55.6 per cent stake in its British cable television arm to Bell Cablemedia for US$19.75 per US depositary share, but will be funded by C&W through a $338 million equity investment in Bell Cablemedia, plus a short-term bridge facility and existing resources.\n\nThe offer would value the whole of the issued ordinary share capital of Videotron at about $1.09 billion, giving Bell, which owns 26 per cent of Videotron, an 81.6 per cent holding.\n\nC&W, which owns 80 per cent of Mercury, will buy an additional 5.17 per cent of the company from Bell, which owns the remaining 20 per cent of Mercury, for GBP150 million (about HK$1.84 billion).\n\nC&W said it would use its experience in Hong Kong of providing advanced integrated services and expected the new company to increase revenues, reduce costs and improve services, through eliminating duplication, enhancing spending power and increasing capital expenditure opportunities.\n\nIn May, C&W and British Telecom the main British operator, ended talks on a merger which would have created one of the biggest telecommunications companies in the world.\n\nMercury is the second biggest telecoms operator in Britain behind British Telecom which has more than 80 per cent of the market for fixed-line telecommunications.\n\nTHREE-WAY DEAL C&W merges with US and Canadian firms Marriage creates biggest cable TV operator in the UK C&W will use its Hong Kong experience in new venture Move reduces C&W's reliance on HK Telecom"
