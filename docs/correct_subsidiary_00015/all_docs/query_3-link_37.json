        "text": "Verizon India, Latvia, Ljubljana, Malta, Hong Kong, Norway, Italy, Beograd (in Serbia), etc.; Verizon sure does get around. The chart above is just an excerpt of a group of 392 different companies/investments of Verizon Communications, Inc. that are presented in the Verizon NY 2019 Annual Report. According the report, Verizon has an “interest of 5% or more” in these companies. The full list of investments is presented below.\n\nIn fact, Verizon’s web site claims that the company is doing business in 150 countries.\n\nThis, of course, brings into question Verizon’s commitment to their state wired utility customers and the US cities and municipalities where the company controls critical wireline infrastructure — and where the company failed to properly upgrade and maintain the state utilities, like Verizon NY or Verizon New Jersey.\n\nNOTE: This story is Part II.\n\nSEE: PART 1: Verizon NY 2019 Annual Report Screams: Start Investigations in NY and Every State in America. This documents the massive financial cross-subsidies — the flows of money — that are evident in the Verizon NY 2019 Annual Report.\n\nHundreds or Thousands of Companies?\n\nOver the last decade we tried to track the Verizon subsidiaries and the company’s investments. In 2017, this list was compiled and posted to Quora; only a few are still mentioned or are using the same name. This list also gives the money paid for the company or the investment made, or that information about the company was “Unknown”.\n\nNov 14, 2016 LQD WiFi Unknown\n\nOct 26, 2016 Vessel Unknown\n\nSep 12, 2016 Sensity Systems Unknown\n\nAug 1, 2016 FleetMatics $2.4B in Cash\n\nJul 25, 2016 Yahoo! $4.83B in Cash\n\nJun 21, 2016 Telogis Unknown\n\nApr 18, 2016 Complex $250M (terms undisclosed)\n\nMar 16, 2016 Volicon Unknown\n\nSome of These Companies have been Renamed.\n\nSmall Business Trends reports:\n\n“Meet Aabaco Small Business (the Reincarnation of Yahoo Directory …\n\n“Who is Aabaco small business?” It’s now part of Aabaco Small Business. Aabaco — whatever that means — is a company owned (for now) by Yahoo and attempts to reach the Yahoo Small Business Directory now direct users to the Aabaco site. Before Google was a household name, many people found their way around the Web by way of the Yahoo Directory. Nov 23, 2015\n\nWhat Are Charlie, Echo, Delta?\n\nMoreover, some of the names of these investments/companies are downright suspicious, attempting to sound more like some mystery spy novel.\n\nAll of this Brings Up a Series of Questions.\n\n§ Did the state public utility networks, not to mention the local phone customers or others that using the wired networks, pay extra to fund these investments?\n\n§ Are the current ‘Corporate Operations’ expenses being used to pay for expenses for any of these subsidiaries or investments?\n\n§ What services is Verizon providing in these other countries and how do they compare to what we’re getting in America? Are other countries getting a better deal on broadband or internet or wireless service?\n\n§ Of the information supplied to the public, how much of it is a direct fabrication or a ‘combining’ of information of investments, some not even in America?\n\nA simple example: Verizon Communications, Inc.’s, (the holding company) 2019 Annual Report claims it has 135,000 employees, but this covers the 150 countries as well as all of these other investments. This has nothing to do with US workers or the numbers of staff delivering wired services — or even delivering a telecommunications service vs selling advertising on Yahoo, a Verizon subsidiary.\n\n“Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading providers of communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 135,000 employees as of December 31, 2019.”\n\nWhat follows is the list of Verizon investments/companies that are in the Verizon New York 2019 Annual Report, published June 8th, 2020.\n\nPlease note that the Verizon Communications, Inc. 2018 Annual Report to investors only listed 15 principal subsidiaries. We do not know why Verizon has not fully disclosed its investments and subsidiaries as compared to this list of 392 found in the Verizon NY 2019 Annual Report.\n\n================================\n\nLIST OF INVESTMENTS:\n\n210 Pine Street Condominium Association\n\nAabaco Small Business, LLC\n\nAirTouch Cellular Inc.\n\nAllentown SMSA Limited
