It provided local telephone service to customers in 13 states from Maine to Virginia, as well as Washington, DC.\n\nBell Atlantic was founded in 1984 as one of the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) in the wake of the breakup of the Bell System. Bell Atlantic merged with NYNEX, a fellow RBOC, in 1997 and subsequently moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City.\n\nThe Bell Atlantic-GTE transaction – valued at more than $52 billion at the time of the announcement in July 1998 – combined Bell Atlantic’s sophisticated network with GTE’s national footprint to create new a leader in the communications industry. After receiving regulatory approval for the merger, Verizon began operations in mid-2000.\n\nLearn more about Bell Atlantic and NYNEX:\n\nRead archived Bell Atlantic news\n\nInformation for Bell Atlantic and NYNEX investors\n\nInformation for Bell Atlantic retirees\n\nBell Atlantic and Verizon history"
