        "text": "The Bell Atlantic name and logo will soon appear throughout the northeastern United States as the company replaces the NYNEX tag on everything from buildings and trucks to telephone bills.\n\nBell Atlantic and NYNEX last month completed a $25.6 billion merger, creating the nation's second-largest communications company. This week, Bell Atlantic kicked off an advertising campaign to tell customers in New York and New England about the change\n\nThis month, the company will start replacing the NYNEX name with the Bell Atlantic name and redesigned logo on company buildings, pay phones, vehicles, White and Yellow Pages directories, employee identification badges and customer bills. Callers to the company's directory assistance or customer service centers already hear a greeting welcoming them to Bell Atlantic. In the Mid-Atlantic states, a redesigned Bell Atlantic logo will replace the current logo.\n\nBell Atlantic expects to complete the name and logo change in all major locations in its local telephone companies' service area by the end of 1998. Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic Mobile will begin changing its name from Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile on facilities throughout its service area."
