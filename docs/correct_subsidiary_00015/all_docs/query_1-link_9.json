        "text": "Bell Atlantic Description Industry: Technology Type: Telecommunications Years Active: 1984-2000 Defunct Reason: Merger\n\nBell Atlantic is a former telecommunications brand.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBell Atlantic was one of seven 'Baby Bell' companies that were created as a result of the the Bell System breakup in 1984.\n\nThe company remained independent and operated in it's own respective region of the United States until 1995, when they made a joint venture with Nynex, another Baby Bell company that operated in a different region. Said joint venture consisted of the two combining both of their cellular operations into a new company known as 'Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile.'[1][2]\n\nBell Atlantic would later acquire the NYNEX company as a whole in 1997, with it being dissolved in favor of their own brand.[3]After the acquisition, Bell Atlantic would expand into 7 new states, all of which previously being Nynex's territory.\n\nThey would repeat this process again in 2000,[4] this time with the telecommunications company GTE. Unlike the previous deal with Nynex however, instead of one company absorbing the other, both companies would merge together to create one new company. This new company would be the current day Verizon, one of the main competitors to AT&T and T-Mobile.[5][6]\n\nDefunct AT&T Brands / The Bell System\n\nA2B Music | Aio Wireless | AT&T Broadband | AT&T Digital Cable | AT&T Phone Center | Audience Network | Cingular Wireless | TCI | Vanguard Cellular Systems\n\nBell System\n\nBell System\n\nBell Phone Center Store | Western Electric\n\nRegional Bell Operating Companies / 'Baby Bells'\n\nAmeritech1 | Bell Atlantic | BellSouth | Nynex1 | Pacific Telesis1 | SBC Communications | US West\n\nAmeritech\n\nAmericast2 | Ameritech1 | Illinois Bell | Indiana Bell | Michigan Bell | Ohio Bell | Wisconsin Bell\n\nBell Atlantic\n\nBell Atlantic | Bell Of Pennsylvania | Diamond State Telephone | GTE | New Jersey Bell | Nynex1 | Tele-TV2 | The C&P Telephone Company | The C&P Telephone Company Of Maryland | The C&P Telephone Company Of Virginia | The C&P Telephone Company Of West Virginia\n\nBellSouth\n\nAmericast2 | BellSouth | Cingular Wireless2 | South Central Bell | Southern Bell\n\nNynex\n\nIBM Product Center | New England Telephone | New York Telephone | Nynex1 | NYNEX Business Centers | NYNEX CableComms | Tele-TV2\n\nPacific Telesis\n\nPacific Telesis1 | Pacific Bell | Nevada Bell | Tele-TV2\n\nSBC Communications\n\nAmericast2 | Ameritech1 | Cingular Wireless2 | Pacific Telesis1 | SBC Communications | SNET | Prodigy (Internet Service)\n\nUS West\n\nContinental Cablevision | MediaOne | Mountain Bell | Northwestern Bell | Pacific Northwest Bell | US West\n\n1Baby Bell company which was acquired by another Baby Bell company\n\n2Joint Venture"
