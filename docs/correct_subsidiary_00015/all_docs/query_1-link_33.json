        "text": "BEDMINSTER, NJ â€” In its continuing effort to increase its East Coast footprint and provide added value to its more than 3 million customers, Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile today announced its agreement to acquire Georgia Rural Service Area 2 (RSA 2) from Horizon Cellular. The cellular property encompasses Barrow and Hall counties, and stretches from the South Carolina border on the north, to areas of suburban Atlanta's Fulton and Gwinnett counties on the south. The property is also contiguous with the current Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile service regions of Anderson and Greenville, South Carolina, and will provide for significant expansion of the in-zone calling area for the company's southeastern customers, as well as the roaming area for the company's customers.\n\nRepresenting an addition of approximately 286,000 POPs (potential customers), the acquisition is an important component in Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile's ongoing strategy to maintain its leadership position in the wireless industry. The additional geography also expands the company's East Coast footprint into the northern corridor of the highly-populated Atlanta metro area, one of the fastest growing regions in the U.S.\n\n\"This acquisition benefits our customers in the southeast and our company,\" said Denny Strigl, president and CEO of Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile. \"It provides us with the kind of strategic growth and opportunity we have identified as company goals for 1996. We will continue to consider acquisitions like this one in the future, as they make sense for our customers and their cellular calling needs.\"\n\nThe acquisition is expected to be completed over the next several months.\n\nWith more than three million customers, Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile is the largest wireless service provider on the East Coast and the second largest provider in the US. Headquartered in Bedminster, NJ, the company offers a full range of wireless voice, data, and paging communications solutions to customers in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and, through a separate subsidiary, in the Southwest. Formed in July 1995 through the combination of Bell Atlantic Mobile's and NYNEX Mobile's cellular operations, the company has more than 5,000 employees.\n\n####"
