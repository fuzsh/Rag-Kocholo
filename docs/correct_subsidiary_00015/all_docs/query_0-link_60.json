        "text": "1900\n\nBrown installed the first long distance line to compete with Bell, being an independent telco.\n\n1911\n\nBrown merged with 3 other telcos to form the United Telephone Company.\n\n1925\n\nUTC became United Telephone & Electric, (UT&E).\n\n1934\n\nThe Communications Act of 1934 was passed, this was supposed to “combine and organize federal regulation of telephone, telegraph, and radio communications. The Act created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to oversee and regulate these industries.”\n\n1939\n\nUT&E (and Brown) renamed itself to United Utilities. Brown had declared bankruptcy in the early 1930s and restructured by creating United Utilities.\n\n1946\n\nClarke McRae Williams receives Oak Ridge Telephone Company as a wedding gift and then purchases Marion Telephone Company.\n\n1963\n\nMicrowave Communications Inc, (MCI) was formed when John Goeken filed with the FCC to create a microwave private line system between Chicago and St Louis. However, the company MCI wasn’t actually founded until 1968. Goeken’s dream was big, to construct microwave towers between the two cities and all points in between to have a solid microwave path connecting voice calls between the two cities. He was trying to compete with AT&T. Goeken said he could do it cheaper and better. He actually did keep that promise. At that time, AT&T saw him as small, but still a viable threat to their business. Suddenly, they had a competitor which, in those days, was a bad thing for the incumbent. This is why it took the FCC until 1968 to allow MCI to build the network. William McGowen became the CEO and put money into MCI, and then things got moving.\n\n1968\n\nMcGowen set up Microwave Communications of America, announced that the 11,000-mile system would go through 40 states, and had affiliates to support MCI.\n\n1969\n\nThe FCC authorizes the microwave system that MCI proposed. AT&T accused MCI of only picking the profitable routes. I can imagine how angry AT&T was at the FCC when MCI got the approvals. The FCC’s decision was a 4 to 3 decision, not a sweep. Think about that for a minute. AT&T and Western Union fought the approval.\n\n1971\n\nMCI hired Kenneth Cox. Cox was a former FCC Commissioner and his job was to lobby the FCC to break apart AT&T’s monopoly. They were very brave to take on a behemoth like AT&T. This is when the FCC actually allowed MCI to move forward. Oak Ridge Telephone renamed to Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc.\n\n1972\n\nUnited Utilities became United Telecommunications. MCI went public to raise capital to fund the project.\n\nSouthern Pacific needed to name its long-distance company, so it picked Sprint which stood for “Southern Pacific Railroad Intelligent Network of Telecommunications”.\n\nCentury Telephone acquired La Crosse Telephone Corporation in Wisconsin.\n\n1973\n\nMCI renamed and restructured itself, they were now MCI Communications Corporation, (it’s funny because technically its name is microwave communication incorporates communications company). The company was in serious financial trouble. The FCC really did want competition so MCI asked for and got permission to allow FX lines. FYI - FX lines are foreign exchange service (FX) is really just voice line access outside the local telco’s area. Hence the name is foreign. But to be honest, it’s a voice line with numbers. Basically, a voice line connecting the FXO, foreign exchange office to the FXS, foreign exchange subscriber.\n\nMcCaw Communications, a paging and broadcast company run by Craaig McCaw after it was nearly shut down, and started to build a large cable empire called McCaw Communications Companies, Inc.\n\n1974\n\nAntitrust suits against AT&T begin. MCI filed one against AT&T asking for damages and then the Department of Justice (DoJ) filed theirs against AT&T. Let the Bell break up begin! MCI was expanding, but not making money. If you run a business, making money helps keep you running the business. MCI was bleeding money from 1973 to 1975.\n\nMcCaw gets into the common carrier business, offering paging to its customers.\n\n1975\n\nA division of South Pacific Company (SPC), South Pacific Communications Company, filed with the FCC to provide long distance to compete with AT&T using the lines they ran alongside South Pacific Railroad, another division of SPC.\n\n1977\n\nAmerican Radio Telephone Service and Motorola start a Joint venture called Cellular One.\n\n1980\n\nUnited Telecommunications started to build a 23,000-mile fiber optic network for long distance communications.\n\n1981\n\nCraig McCaw, now CEO of McCaw Communications, read an AT&T document that cellular would have over 900,000 subscribers by the turn of the century.\n\n1982\n\nThe US DoJ commands AT&T to break apart,\n\nGeneral Telephone and Electronics, GTE, agrees to buy SPC’s long-distance service, Sprint. This deal was finalized in 1983.\n\n1983\n\nAT&T Corp breaks up the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) expected to be 1) The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania, 2) New Jersey Bell, 3) Diamond State Telephone, 4) C&P Telephone. Cellular One offers services in Baltimore and Washington DC. The FCC could not handle all the cellular license applications, so they went to a lottery system.\n\nMcCaw files for cellular licenses and starts to build out its network. Craig McCaw had been buying licenses for the past several years.\n\n1984\n\nAT&T broken up and becomes what we called, at that time, the baby Bells officially split: 1) Ameritech - someone I don’t think I dealt with often, 2) Bell Atlantic - A very good Bell company, 3) BellSouth - OK to deal with, 4) NYNEX - a company I hated to deal with and in my opinion was terrible to work with, 5) Pacific Telesis - someone hard to deal with but fair, 6) Southwest Bell - I didn’t do much business with them, 7) US West - I think they were OK to work with,\n\nMcCaw purchases Dominion Cellular.\n\n1985\n\nMcCaw purchases MCI Airsignal, closing in 1986\n\nMcCaw buys MaxCell Telecom Plus and Charisma Communications.\n\n1986\n\nGTE Sprint merged with United Telecom Company’s US Telecom. The new name? Sprint. Sprint stood for “Southern Pacific Railroad Intelligent Network of Telecommunications”.\n\nGTE spins off its Sprint division,\n\nMcCaw begins to sell off its paging to Mobile Communications and cable assets to Jack Kent Cooke.\n\nCincinnati Bell buys 45% of Ameritech Cellular\n\n1987\n\nFleet Call formed and later became Nextel.\n\nMcCaw Cellular Communications purchased MCI Communications.\n\nSouthwestern Bell Company acquired Cellular One which was the cellular division of Metromedia. At that time Metromedia was a paging and cellular company.\n\nUnited Telecom officially becomes Sprint\n\n1988\n\nPacific Northwest Cellular was founded. They later renamed themselves VoiceStream. At that time, voice was the future.\n\n1989\n\nUnited Telecommunications' long-distance service was profitable for the first time.\n\nSouthwestern Bell Mobile Systems and McCaw Communications came together to form Cellular One Group.\n\n1990\n\nUnited Telecom has completed its acquisition of Sprint.\n\nMcCaw partners with AT&T as a technology partner.\n\nThanks to McCaw, Cellular One started to use SS7 across the network for their cellular connections to the tower.\n\n1992\n\nVanguard Cellular Systems joined Cellular One Group.\n\nAT&T purchases 33% of McCaw Cellular.\n\n1993\n\nSprint entered the wireless market by purchasing Centel, then based in Chicago and the 10th largest cellular carrier operating across 22 states.\n\nFleet Call becomes Nextel.\n\n1994\n\nAT&T Wireless acquired the rest of McCaw Cellular. They started using AT&T Wireless Group as their name. Pacific Telesis spins off its cellular company as AIRTouch.\n\nJohn Stanton founded VoiceStream Wireless as a spinoff of Western Wireless Corporation.\n\n1995\n\nSouthwest Bell Cellular changes its official name to Cellular One opens up membership to affiliates. They served over 5 million customers and covered 69% of the US population. NET, Southern New England Telephone, an AT&T affiliate, joined the Cellular One Partnership.\n\n1996\n\nSprint partners with Radio Shack to sell phones.\n\nBill Clinton’s Telecom Reform Act was passed in 1996. This was supposed to be “An act to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for American telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.” PDF found here.\n\nQwest is formed.\n\nRadio Shack declares bankruptcy closing 1,440 stores, later sued Sprint claiming Sprint used the Radio Shack data to locate its own stores.\n\n1997\n\nSBC acquired Pacific Telesis.\n\nWorldCom, a long-distance company, acquired MCI, another long-distance company forming WorldCom MCI. Yes, long distance companies were huge back then and very profitable. I remember paying over 25 cents a minute was considered a good deal and that the long-distance plans were so complicated. Bell Atlantic acquired NYNEX.\n\nCentury Telephone purchases Pacific Telesis,\n\n1998\n\nSprint builds its headquarters in Overland Park, Ks. A huge campus.\n\nCincinnati Bell Wireless (CBW) was formed to serve southeast Indiana and Western Ohio. Cincinnati Bell buys 80% of AT&T Wireless’ Cincinnati Dayton PCS network.\n\n1999\n\nSBC acquired Ameritech.\n\nAirtouch and Vodafone UK merge to form Vodafone Airtouch. Creative name, right?\n\nVoiceStream spun off from Western Wireless Corp.\n\n2000\n\nQwest takes over US West.\n\nVodafone Airtouch combined with Bell Atlantic to create Verizon Wireless, Vodafone owned 45% and Bell Atlantic owned 55%.\n\nOn the landline side, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE to create Verizon. FYI Verizon is a combination of veritas (Latin for certainty or reliability) and horizon (visionary and forward-looking), taking the Ver and adding izon to form Verizon.\n\nVoiceStream Wireless acquired Omnipoint Communications and Aerial Communications Inc.\n\nCentury sells wireless business to AllTel.\n\n2001\n\nCingular is formed when SBC combines with BellSouth.\n\nGerman Deutsche Telekom AG took over American companies VoiceStream and Powertel Inc.\n\nVoiceStream becomes T-Mobile US, an entity of T-Mobile International. A subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG.\n\n2002\n\nAT&T spins off AT&T Wireless Services.\n\nVoiceStream officially became T-Mobile (still owned by Deutsche Telekom in Germany).\n\n2003\n\nClearwire formed and offered WiMAX service.\n\nWorldCom changed its name to MCI after an accounting scandal.\n\n2004\n\nCingular takes over AT&T Wireless. Cingular was 40% owned by Bellsouth and 60% by SBC Communications, both Baby Bells.\n\nQwest sells off its wireless division, keeps landlines, and becomes a reseller for Sprint.\n\nSprint merges with Nextel forming Sprint Nextel. The goal was to increase Sprint's subscriber base, but the networks had literally nothing in common and could not be easily merged. What really happened was that it drove away customers and on top of the loss of subs, they took a $37B loss.\n\nVerizon launched Fios Internet in Keller, Tx, using fiber to the home, FTTH.\n\n2005\n\nVerizon takes over MCI.\n\nSBC acquired AT&T, keeping the AT&T name.\n\nVerizon acquired MCI.\n\nVerizon launched Fios TV in Keller, Tx.\n\n2006\n\nAT&T takes over BellSouth, renames Cingular Wireless to AT&T.\n\nVerizon loses its Telephone Directory Service.\n\nCincinnati Bell bought out all of Cingular's share of Cincinnati Bell Wireless.\n\n2007\n\nVerizon sells off landlines in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont to FairPoint Communications.\n\nVerizon sued and won against Vonage for patent infringement, Vonage appealed and lost, $120 million settlement.\n\nVerizon acquired CyberTrust, they provide information security services.\n\n2008\n\nQwest drops Sprint and becomes reseller for Verizon Wireless\n\nSprint Nextel forms Xohm, (a 4G WiMAX provider) and merges it with Clearwire taking a 54% ownership claim.\n\nVerizon takes over Rural Cellular Corp.\n\nT-Mobile acquired SunCom Wireless Holdings Inc.\n\nCenturyTel acquired Embarq and became CenturyLink.

Then T-Mobile UK became part of France Telecom’s UK and Orange (UK) joint venture to name it EE and it became the UK’s largest mobile network operator.\n\n2011\n\nAT&T attempted to take over T-Mobile, but it failed, which made Sprint very happy since they were considering a merger with T-Mobile.\n\nCenturyLink buys Qwest formerly US West.\n\nVerizon bought Telemark Worldwide, an IT services company.\n\nVerizon takes over CloudSwitch.\n\n2012\n\nT-Mobile mergers with MetroPCS Communications which closed in 2013 and the new leadership, John Legere, will lead for the next decade or so.\n\nVerizon buys Hughes Telematics, entering the automobile market with wireless products and services.\n\nVerizon completes purchase of AWS spectrum from Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.\n\n2013\n\nSoftBank invests in Sprint and takes 70% ownership.\n\nT-Mobile buys spectrum from US Cellular for $308 Million.\n\nVerizon buys uplink.\n\nVerizon buys EdgeCast.\n\nT-Mobile is now the “un-carrier”.\n\nTMUS goes public on the NYSE.\n\nSprint and Softbank attempt to acquire a stake in T-Mobile US.\n\n2014\n\nT-Mobile buys 700MHz spectrum from Verizon Wireless for 2.365B.Verizon completes its buyback of Vodaphone's 45% stake in Verizon.Verizon buys Intel Media.\n\n2015\n\nSprint’s Clear is to be shuttered.\n\nVerizon Acquired AOL, (what a disaster!).\n\nVerizon spun management of its tower division to American Tower Corp, ATC.AT&T purchases DirectTV and Time Warner.\n\nT-Mobile passes Sprint as the new #3 carrier in the US.\n\n2016\n\nSBC Communications buys AT&T and adopts the AT&T name.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the FCC's net neutrality rules which made broadband access a public utility, no longer a luxury.
