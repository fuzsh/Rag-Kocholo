        "text": "April 24, 1996\n\nNYNEX CONTACT: Media Relations,\n\n(212) 395-0500\n\nNYNEX Signs First-Of-Its-Kind Agreement With Long Distance Vendor - Describes Long\n\nDistance Strategy\n\nNEW YORK, N.Y. -- NYNEX (NYSE:NYN) today announced it has\n\nsigned a unique agreement with Sprint Communications Company, L.P. that will\n\nenable NYNEX to quickly enter long distance markets, including the $10 billion\n\nmarket in its own home region.\n\nThe agreement is part of NYNEX's plan to\n\nrapidly provide a full array of long distance services to customers throughout\n\nits Northeast service area as well as in select domestic and international\n\nmarkets outside its region.\n\nUnder the terms of the two-year contract, NYNEX\n\nwill purchase a comprehensive set of network, customer care, billing and\n\ntelemarketing services and use these to sell domestic and international long\n\ndistance services. The contract also gives NYNEX the flexibility to develop and\n\npackage with its long distance service a broad array of other value-added\n\nservices.\n\n\"Our agreement with Sprint is more comprehensive and\n\nflexible than conventional long distance resale agreements, and it allows us to\n\nenter the market with world-class capabilities and world-wide\n\nreach,\" said Robert T. Anderson, NYNEX vice president - Business\n\nDevelopment, who is also president of NYNEX's long distance subsidiary.\n\n\"By using Sprint's infrastructure, we'll enter the market as a lean and\n\nefficient operation,\" Anderson said. \"Furthermore, the agreement\n\nprovides a cost structure that will enable us to have the pricing flexibility\n\nrequired to be competitive in the long distance market.\"\n\nOf equal\n\nimportance, the contract spells out a specific set of service standards and\n\nensures that NYNEX will be in a position to provide the best value and service\n\noffered in the market. NYNEX also has at its discretion the option to take over\n\nportions of the customer care and network functions provided by Sprint.\n\nNYNEX and Bell Atlantic, which yesterday announced a definitive agreement to\n\nmerge, are pursuing parallel plans for entry into long distance. For its part,\n\nNYNEX is taking a three-pronged approach\n\nto the market: targeted \"out-of-region,\" international, and\n\n\"in-region.\"\n\nTargeted \"Out-of-Region\" Markets Will\n\nBe First\n\nNYNEX is well positioned to succeed in the long distance business because\n\nof market advantages unique to its six-state service area, particularly the\n\nhigh volume of international long distance traffic as well as the affinities\n\nthat certain groups of callers from outside the region have with the Northeast.\n\n\"Millions of people worldwide, such as 'snowbirds' or many national or\n\nmultinational businesses, have a personal or business relationship with someone\n\nin the NYNEX region, which provides us with a unique competitive\n\nopportunity,\" Anderson said. \"Our opening strategy is to quickly take\n\nadvantage of this fact.\"\n\nNYNEX expects to offer long distance service\n\nwithin the next three\n\nmonths, pending regulatory approvals, in six states: Arizona, California,\n\nFlorida, Georgia, Illinois, and Texas. These states account for more than one\n\nthird of all domestic long distance traffic terminating in the Northeast.\n\n\"We will use a targeted marketing program rather than mass marketing to\n\nreach out-of-region customers, and we will offer them value-added packages of\n\nproducts and services based on the high volume of their communications into the\n\nregion,\" said Anderson.\n\n\"This marketing strategy focuses on\n\nselected high-margin segments, not overall market share,\" he said.\n\n\"Combined with our use of the Sprint infrastructure, this marketing\n\nstrategy will allow rapid entry with minimal investment and low operating costs\n\n-- which will enable NYNEX to maximize the contribution to earnings from\n\nlong-distance.\"\n\nInternational Call Volumes are NYNEX's\n\nAdvantage\n\nOn Feb. 23, NYNEX became the first Regional Bell Operating\n\nCompany (RBOC) to file to provide international long distance service,\n\nwhich has the most rapid growth and the highest margins in the long distance\n\nmarket. More than 20 percent of U.S. international calling originates in the\n\nNYNEX region, representing an opportunity of approximately $3.0 billion a year.\n\nThe NYNEX territory is a magnet for international business and travel.\n\n\"Nearly one-third of New York City's residents were born in other\n\ncountries, and our region shares a long border with the most populated\n\nprovinces of Canada,\" said Anderson. \"We can help people maintain\n\ntheir personal and business ties between the northeastern United States and\n\ntheir home countries.\"\n\nNYNEX expects to begin providing\n\n\"out-of-region\" international service this summer, and will offer\n\ninternational service to customers within its region when it receives the\n\nnecessary approvals.\n\nEarly Entry into the \"In-Region\"\n\nMarket\n\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires RBOCs to meet a\n\n\"checklist\" of items that open their local networks and markets to\n\ncompetition\n\nbefore being permitted to offer long distance service to customers in their\n\nregions.\n\n\"NYNEX is already ahead of other RBOCs in meeting the\n\n'checklist' requirements because of the progressive steps we have taken to\n\nfoster competition,\" Anderson said. He said that NYNEX will be\n\noperationally ready to begin offering long distance service in New York by\n\nOctober. The company also plans to offer services in Massachusetts by June of\n\nnext year, and in the rest of its seven-state home region no later than\n\nDecember 1997.\n\nNYNEX's goal, Anderson said, is to capture 20 percent of the\n\n$10 billion in-region long distance market within five years. This market, he\n\nestimated, is growing at more than eight percent a year.\n\nNYNEX is a global communications and media company that provides\n\na full range of services in the northeastern United States and\n\nhigh-growth markets around the world, including the United Kingdom,\n\nThailand, Gibraltar, Greece, Indonesia, the Philippines, Poland,\n\nSlovakia and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Corporation is a leader in the telecommunications, wireless communications,\n\ncable television, directory publishing\n\nand entertainment and information services."
