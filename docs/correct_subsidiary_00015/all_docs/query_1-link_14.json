        "text": "Plans underway to build $5 million, 42,000 square foot addition\n\nFebruary 20, 1997\n\nWALLINGFORD, Conn. - - To support the growing demand\n\nfor its\n\nwireless communications services in Connecticut, Bell Atlantic NYNEX\n\nMobile announced it has begun construction of a 42,000 square foot, $5\n\nmillion expansion to its regional headquarters located at 20 Alexander\n\nDrive in the Barnes Industrial Park in Wallingford.\n\nAt a groundbreaking ceremony today, Jack Plating, president,\n\nNortheast region, Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile kicked-off the effort\n\nwhich is scheduled for completion in the third quarter '97.\n\nThe company's existing 63,200 square foot facility, housing 300\n\nemployees, will now expand by 42,000 square feet to accommodate\n\nadditional personnel. The additional room will also house more\n\nwireless switching equipment needed for the growing wireless network.\n\nThe need to expand the facility, according to Plating, is due to\n\ncontinued strong growth in cellular phone subscribers.\n\n\"Maintaining high quality service requires a continuous investment\n\nin our facilities and network,\" said Plating. \"The investment\n\nwill\n\nsupport the introduction of new wireless communications equipment\n\nwhich will allow us to meet growing service demands.\"\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nBell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile is the\n\nlargest wireless service provider on\n\nthe East Coast and the second largest in the United States. The\n\ncompany owns and operates the most extensive network in the east,\n\ncovering 111,000 square miles, and the largest chain of wireless\n\nretail outlets offering a full range of wireless personal\n\ncommunications services, including voice, data and paging. Based in\n\nBedminster, NJ, Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile has 4.4 million customers\n\nand 6,500 employees in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and,\n\nthrough a separate subsidiary, in the Southwest.
