Nynex Corp frantic efforts to keep the lid on the revelations of what happened at Florida parties organised by former vice-president Lawrence Friedman with Nynex Materiel Enterprises employees and suppliers have not prevented the row rumbling on, and the company was this week socked with a new threat when New York state regulators said that they were considering forcing Nynex to divest its New York Telephone subsidiary, which is the local phone company for New York City and state: Nynex responded by saying that divestiture of New York Telephone is not an option for consideration â€“ but Nynex can only propose while the regulators dispose.
