Osbourne and Bob Daisley wrote a song called 'Suicide Solution', which was released on Blizzard of Ozz. It was heavily ridiculed claiming it was about suicide, which coincided with the words "shoot, shoot" whispered in the song.[4] Osbourne stated in an interview that it was really a tribute to his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC, who died of alcohol poisoning. However, Daisley states it's about Osbourneâ€™s substance and alcohol abuse. He bit the head off of a bat on stage while on a solo tour in Des Moines, Iowa supporting the Bark at the Moon album.
