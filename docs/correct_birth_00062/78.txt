However, he made a triumphant comeback in 1995 with the release of “Ozzmosis.” This album saw Ozzy exploring different musical territories, incorporating elements of alternative rock and grunge into his sound. Songs like “Perry Mason” and “See You on the Other Side” showcased a more introspective side to Ozzy’s music.

In recent years, Ozzy has continued to evolve his sound by collaborating with artists from different genres. His collaboration with rapper Post Malone on the hit song “Take What You Want” introduced him to a new generation of music listeners and showcased his ability to adapt to different styles.
