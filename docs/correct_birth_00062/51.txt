John Michael "Ozzy" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English singer, songwriter, and television personality. He was born at Marston Green Maternity Hospital in Coleshill, but grew up in the Aston area of Birmingham. He rose to prominence during the 1970s as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, during which period he adopted the nickname "Prince of Darkness".

Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 due to alcohol and drug problems, but went on to have a successful solo career, releasing 12 studio albums, the first seven of which received multi-platinum certifications in the US. Osbourne has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions.

In the early 2000s, Osbourne became a reality television star, appearing as himself in the MTV reality show "The Osbournes" alongside wife and manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack. He co-stars with Jack and Kelly in the television series "Ozzy & Jack's World Detour". The show's third season debuted in June 2018.
