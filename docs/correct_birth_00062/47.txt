About

Known as the âGodfather of Heavy Metal,â Ozzy Osbourne (born John Michael Osbourne) has paved the way for Heavy Metal bands to come.

Osbourne was born on December 3, 1948 in Birmingham, England. After many years of struggling in school, he dropped out at the age of 15 and worked on many odd jobs eventually leading him to joining a band with Geezer Butler. The group then split and Ozzy and Geezer joined Tony Iommi and Bill Ward in a new band that went under several names but ended up being called Black Sabbath.

The band recorded numerous albums but after the decline of his relationship with Iommi, and several band break-ups, Osbourne left the band and launched his solo career. During the 80âs, Osbourne was treated for alcoholism and was sued twice for the suicides of some of his young fans but was later cleared for all of them. Every single one of his original solo albums has gone multi-platinum.

Osbourne has been married to his wife Sharon since 1982. They have three children, Jack, Aimee, and Kelly. He was previously married to Thelma Mayfair for three years and had two children with her. Ozzy, Sharon, Jack, and Kelly joined MTV to make a reality TV show based on their daily family life called The Osbournes, which earned the network its highest ratings in MTV history to date.
