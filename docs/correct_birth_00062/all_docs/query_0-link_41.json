        "text": "Heavy metal star Ozzy Osbourne has declared how he is determined to visit the world-famous Black Sabbath Bench on Broad Street in his home city of Birmingham.\n\nThe rocker's plans have emerged in a new video interview with his wife Sharon, where Ozzy says he'll be coming to see the bench even “if I have to crawl there”.\n\nOzzy also recalls moments from his childhood in Birmingham, including how he used to “mind cars for tips” during Aston Villa’s home matches.\n\nSharon has sent the exclusive video as a 'thank you' gift to Mike Olley, general manager of Westside BID, the man behind the creation and upkeep of the world-famous bench on Broad Street.\n\nYou can watch the new three-minute video HERE.\n\nAt the start of the video, Sharon asks: “Ozzy, how do you feel about the Black Sabbath bench in Birmingham?”\n\nOzzy’s answer is thoughtful and clear: “It’s an achievement. I mean, Black Sabbath, we all came from Birmingham, Aston precisely. I don’t know how to thank you all enough.”\n\nSharon then asks: “Did you ever think, at any time, that in your hometown there would be a bench with huge, huge pictures of Black Sabbath on?” Seated in a large brown leather chair, Ozzy replies: “Never, never. I mean it’s fantastic!”\n\nSharon then talks fondly about the bench: “It’s become a tourist attraction, because people go and sit and have their picture taken with whichever member of Black Sabbath they want.”\n\nOzzy appears genuinely excited at the image, and says: “Wow! That’s really cool, that’s really cool.”\n\nSharon then moves on to ask about Ozzy’s experiences in Birmingham. Thinking it through carefully, Ozzy responds: “Well, I didn’t go to Birmingham city centre much as a kid, or it was on special occasions. I remember being in Aston more.\n\n“I remember when there was football matches on at the Villa. I used to mind cars and get a tip at the end of it. I remember my father coming out the pub and singing on the bus!\n\n“The thing about Aston, a lot of things have changed about it. My house in Lodge Road is still there and I used to go up there all the\n\ntime when I had chance. I showed you out there …”\n\nSharon interjects at this point: “Yes, we’ve been to the house. The kids have been to the house ... ”. Ozzy then continues: “There are fond memories and a lot of sad memories as well. People like my friend Patrick Murphy …”. Ozzy pauses at this point, and Sharon prompts him: “No longer with you.” Ozzy adds: “A dear friend of mine …”.\n\nSharon then asks: “And the bench, when are you going to go up and see it?” Ozzy replies: “When I go up and see the Bull!”\n\n“We’re going to go and make a day of it, right?” says Sharon. “Absolutely!” says Ozzy. “A couple of days. There’s some nice boutique hotels there.\" Then he mentions “having a beer”.\n\n“Oh the beer!” laughs Sharon. “You aren’t having any beer, Ozzy, no beer at all! Water for you! So when do you think you’re going to be there?”\n\nOzzy replies: “If I have to crawl I’m going to be there! I’ll be coming up very soon.”\n\nAt the end of the interview, Sharon adds: “And we want to thank Mike Olley for making it happen.” Ozzy agrees: “Thank you Mike, thank you so much. What can I say! Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”\n\nCommenting on the new video, Mike Olley said: “What a fantastic gesture from Ozzy and Sharon to have recorded this short video for Westside BID as a token of their gratitude over the bench.\n\n“We were thrilled to receive it and are now pleased to be sending it out to the world to see. Ozzy's memory and responses about Aston seem crystal clear, and it was great to see his obvious love of the bench.”"
