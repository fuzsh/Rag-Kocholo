        "text": "Best known for being the venue where Ozzy Osbourne’s Black Sabbath (the band was known as Earth at the time) performed their first ever gig at Henry’s Blueshouse - situated upstairs inside the pub – The Crown also hosted a litany of other rock royalty including: The Who, Status Quo, UB40, Duran Duran, Thin Lizzy, Marc Bolan, Supertramp, Judas Priest and a number of Robert Plant's pre-Led Zeppelin bands.\n\nSitting at the junction of Station Street and Hill Street, a stone’s throw away from Birmingham New Street Station, the building is one of the first things seen by passengers leaving the station via the grand Spanish steps and has been a site of concern locally for almost a decade, laying vacant since 2014.\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally named the General Elliott and thought to have opened its doors in 1876, it was likely designed by the architect, Thomson Plevins. Best known for the Grade II* listed Grand Hotel in Birmingham, Plevins also designed the two other public houses on Station Street - the Market Hotel and the Victoria.\n\nAs well as quenching the thirst of Brummies and showcasing rock stars from across the world, the building has had some other fascinating alternative uses. Local legend has it that the Crown’s cellars stored the remains of fallen soldiers during the First World War, which were then taken through a tunnel to St Martin’s Church, and its upper rooms are thought to have been accommodation for judges visiting Birmingham’s law courts.\n\nIan Campbell – father of Ali, Duncan and Robin Campbell of UB40 – recorded the country’s first live folk album there in 1962. As one of the few places with a license for live music in the city at the time, Henry’s Blueshouse, set up at the Crown in the late 1960s, established the venue as one of Birmingham’s most important cultural landmarks.\n\nGrade II listing is granted when a building is of special architectural or historic interest considered to be of national importance and therefore worth protecting; listing provides certain protections for the building and means that listed building consent must be applied for to make any changes to that building which might affect its special interest."
