The legendary British singer, songwriter, and rock icon has achieved immense fame and notoriety throughout his career. While Ozzy’s life and career have been well-documented, one figure has remained relatively unknown to the general public: Thelma Riley, his first wife. So, who is Thelma Riley? Thelma’s life, marked by her marriage to the Prince of Darkness, is a fascinating story that deserves to be brought to the forefront. In this article, we’ll delve into the untold story of Thelma Riley, her life before and after Ozzy, and the intriguing complexities of her relationship with the rock legend. Thelma Riley Early Life and Background Thelma Riley was born on either May 16 or May 17, 1954, in Hertfordshire, England. However, the exact date of her birth is not confirmed by any official source. Growing up in this bustling English city, she led a relatively quiet and ordinary life before crossing paths with Ozzy Osbourne. Her background is that of a typical English Woman of her generation, and little is known about her early years. However, her life took a dramatic turn when she met the man who would become one of the most iconic figures in the history of rock music.\n\n3. Thelma Riley Meeting Ozzy Osbourne Thelma Riley’s life took a remarkable twist in 1971 when she met Ozzy Osbourne. The two crossed paths at the Rum Runner nightclub in Birmingham, UK, where Thelma was working as a waitress. Ozzy, at the age of 22, was on the brink of his music career taking off. The connection between the two was immediate and intense. Their romantic relationship blossomed, and within a few months, they decided to tie the knot. Marriage and Family Life Thelma Riley and Ozzy Osbourne’s wedding took place in July 1971. Their union marked the beginning of a new chapter in both of their lives. During their marriage, they had two children together, Jessica Starshine Osbourne, born on January 20, 1972, and Louis Osbourne, born in 1975. But what makes their family even more unique is that Ozzy Osbourne adopted Thelma’s five-year-old son, Elliot Kingsley, from a previous relationship. The family, at this point, had grown to include Thelma’s son, born in 1966. The marriage of Thelma and Ozzy was notable for its longevity, spanning eleven years before it reached its final destination in 1982. It was during this time that Ozzy’s career with Black Sabbath experienced remarkable highs, as well as tumultuous lows. Their marriage journey was a rollercoaster ride\n\n4. filled with moments of joy and moments of crisis, which eventually led to their separation and divorce. The Divorce and Its Causes Thelma Riley filed for divorce, marking the end of her marriage to Ozzy Osbourne. The divorce was accompanied by a flurry of sensational accusations and revelations, making headlines at the time. Thelma alleged that her ex-husband, Ozzy, was struggling with a severe drug addiction, which was a key factor in his removal from Black Sabbath in 1979. The consequences of this addiction had a profound impact on their relationship and family life. In addition to the drug addiction, Thelma accused Ozzy of physical and emotional abuse during their marriage. She claimed that he was an absent father, neglecting his responsibilities to their children and that he was involved in infidelity, being a womanizer during their time together. Ozzy, in a later confession, admitted to cheating on his wife with three women during a hotel stay, confirming some of these allegations. Ozzy Osbourne’s public acknowledgment of his infidelity and struggles with drugs and alcohol in his 2007 autobiography, “I Am Ozzy,” shed further light on the complexities of their marriage.\n\n5. He attributed much of their marital discord to his substance abuse and the demanding nature of his career with Black Sabbath, which often took him away from his family. The impact of Ozzy’s tumultuous lifestyle was immense. He shared in a 2011 documentary film, “God Bless Ozzy Osbourne,” produced by his son Jack, that he couldn’t even remember his children’s birthdays during that period. Their children, in interviews and public statements, expressed their feelings of being emotionally and physically absent. Thelma Riley Children Thelma Riley is the mother of three children. Her daughter, Jessica Starshine Osbourne, was born in 1972, making her the first child of Ozzy and Thelma. Jessica’s brother, Louis Osbourne, arrived in 1975, completing the sibling duo of their first marriage. Ozzy Osbourne also adopted Thelma’s son from a previous relationship, Elliot Kingsley, who was born in 1966. When Thelma and Ozzy married, Elliot was just five years old, and Ozzy embraced the role of stepfather. Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne went on to have three children of their own: Aimee, Kelly, and Jack. This extended family became well-known in the entertainment world, and some of the Osbourne children even made appearances on the family’s reality show, “The Osbournes.”\n\n6. Grandmotherhood Thelma has a total of five grandkids: two from Louis and three from Jessica. Jessica Osbourne wedded Ben Hobbs in 2002 and they are parents to three children: Harry Hobbs, Isabelle Hobbs, and Kitty Hobbs. Louis Osbourne tied the knot with Louise Osbourne in 2003 and they have two kids: Elijah Osbourne and Maia Osbourne. Elliot Kingsley has not fathered any children yet. He is a theatre actor and director who resides in London. Ozzy Osbourne adores his grandchildren and often hangs out with them. He has said that being a grandfather brings him joy.

She adopted the name Thelma Maryflair and moved away from the spotlight that had surrounded her during her marriage to the rock legend. Thelma relocated to Leicestershire, England, where she chose to lead a private and low-profile life.
