        "text": "John Michael Osbourne, better known as Ozzy Osbourne, is a Grammy Award winning musician who rose to fame as the lead singer of the hard rock band Black Sabbath. The singer-cum-songwriter struggled through several childhood problems to become one of the most popular hard rock stars of his times. While in school he suffered from dyslexia and did not even complete his studies as family circumstances demanded he earn money. He formed his first musical band Rare Breed with Geezer Butler, but the band broke up after giving just two performances. The duo decided to try again and recruited guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward and together formed a band initially called Earth. Eventually they renamed this band as Black Sabbath and decided to follow the style of heavy blues music with melancholy lyrics and music. The band became an instant success with their debut album ‘Black Sabbath’ which peaked at number eight on the U.K. Albums Chart. They released the albums, ‘Paranoid’ and ‘Master of Reality’ in quick succession, both of which became smash hits with the fans - ‘Master of Reality’ went Double Platinum. Although a highly successful music artist, Osbourne has abused drugs and alcohol for most of his life."
