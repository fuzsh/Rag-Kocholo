        "text": "Ozzy Osbourne is a Birmingham legend – not only for putting this city on the rock ‘n’ roll map but for never turning his back on his West Midlands roots. Everywhere you turn his influence and inspiration is seen. So of course it makes perfect sense that his final shows will be performed here in his hometown.\n\nThe former Black Sabbath singer – who revealed he had Parkinson’s disease in 2020 – last performed in Birmingham at the closing ceremony for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Last year, he retired from touring altogether. Speaking to The Mirror, however, Sharon Osbourne revealed the 75-year-old will play one last time.\n\nShe said: “He won’t tour again but we are planning on doing two more shows to say goodbye as he feels like ‘I have never said goodbye to my fans and I want to say goodbye properly’.” There’s no confirmed date or place, but she seemed to suggest it could be at Aston Villa’s stadium Villa Park – of whom Ozzy is a huge football fan.\n\n“His voice is still absolutely perfect. And all the time he has been off he still does his singing lessons so his voice is perfect. And he can joke yeah. He has all these melodies in his head. Even if you don’t like his music you can’t not like Ozzy, he just draws you in.”\n\nIt’s clear that Ozzy loves Birmingham and the city loves him back – visit Ozzy the Bull, the Black Sabbath Bench, or this Digbeth mural to believe us. But two final shows aren’t the only gift the Godfather of Metal is giving us. A memorabilia museum dedicated to Ozzy is also due to open in Birmingham."
