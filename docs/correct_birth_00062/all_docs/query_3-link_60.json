        "text": "While the touring world is on hold, it seems like the world of the Osbournes is busier than ever. Ozzy is still recovering, getting stronger every day and working on a few projects. There is a movie being worked on about the courtship between Ozzy and Sharon, a new paranormal series starring the whole family, and of course Ozzy still wants to do one more tour. But that's not all, a new video biography is set to premiere in September about the Prince of Darkness.\n\nA&E revealed that Biography: The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne will premiere on Labor Day, Monday, September 7th, at 9pm ET/PT.\n\nAccording to the press release:\n\n“Biography: The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne” traces Ozzy’s life from his childhood in poverty and time in prison, to fronting legendary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Black Sabbath and successful Grammy Award-winning solo career, to one of rock’s elder statesman and a loveable 21st century television dad. The two-hour documentary explores how Ozzy has continually reinvented himself and his career to propel himself toward greater success. As Ozzy turns 70, he reflects on the intimate details of his successes, failures, and his unique ability for survival and perseverance—including never-before-seen interviews about his recent Parkinson’s diagnosis. The documentary, a selection of the 2020 SXSW Film Festival, also features interviews with Sharon, Kelly and Jack Osbourne as well as friends and fellow musicians including Rick Rubin, Ice-T, Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Jonathan Davis, Post Malone and more.\n\nHere is a clip from the doc focusing on how Ozzy is NOT a homebody and the invention of Ozzfest:\n\nThe following week, Biography will return with an episode titled “Biography: I Want My MTV focusing on the rise and cultural impact of the music video channel. It sounds pretty must see as well. Here's the description:\n\n“Biography: I Want My MTV” charts the rise of a cultural phenomenon that came to define a generation: MTV. What started during the nascent days of cable television as a scrappy, playful music video lineup, rapidly evolved into a reflection of American youth culture. As MTV came of age, the network pushed the boundaries of art, sex, gender and race, while cementing its image to celebrity. And when the information revolution raged, MTV was at the forefront exploring new technologies. “I Want My MTV” weaves together exclusive interviews with the network’s founders and VJs, artists and journalists, along with rarely seen archival footage and outtakes, including an interview with the late David Bowie that was never broadcast on television. The documentary, which premiered at Tribeca Film Festival in 2019 and became a crowd favorite at festivals around the world, details the story of a network that evokes youth for a generation now grown, and influenced the global media landscape for decades to come. Interview subjects include Sting, Pat Benatar, Billy Idol, Annie Lennox, Nancy Wilson, Fab Five Freddy, Norman Lear, Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, among many others."
