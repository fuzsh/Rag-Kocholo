        "text": "Heavy metal legend Ozzy Osbourne has spoken out as he backs a campaign to save a city street that is home to multiple historic hotspots.\n\nThe campaign was launched after The Electric, thought to be the UK’s oldest working cinema, suddenly closed its doors for the foreseeable future in February.\n\nFollowing this, nearly 21,000 people signed a petition to save Station Street, which is also home to The Old Rep theatre and The Crown pub where Black Sabbath, then called Earth, played their first gig in 1968.\n\nThe band’s lead singer Osbourne and his wife Sharon have released a video expressing their concern for the future of their former haunts and their legacies.\n\nThey described the pub - which is opposite New Street railway station - “architecturally brilliant” and said the prospect of demolition would “take the soul of Birmingham away”.\n\nOsbourne recalled: “Jim Simpson used to put on a blues night every Tuesday and we’d go there and have jam sessions for hours, that was where we all started.”\n\nOther Birmingham legends to speak out include Steven Knight - director of Peaky Blinders and This Town - who described the street as a “jewel in the crown of Birmingham’s history.”\n\n“These heritage places are not a luxury, a city is identified by its cultural history and historical landmarks,” he said.\n\nAn online petition is calling on the West Midlands mayor and the local authority to designate the street as a cultural heritage asset because of fears the historic hotspot is under threat."
