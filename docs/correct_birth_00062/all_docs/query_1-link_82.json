        "text": "Ozzy Osbourne is an iconic British rock musician. He stands at the origins of the Black Sabbath collective. To date, the group is considered the founder of such musical styles as hard rock and heavy metal.\n\nMusic critics have called Ozzy the \"father\" of heavy metal. He is inducted into the British Rock Hall of Fame. Many of Osbourne's compositions are the clearest example of hard rock classics.\n\nOzzy Osbourne said:\n\n“Everyone expects me to write an autobiographical book. I assure you that it will be a very thin little book: “Ozzy Osbourne was born on December 3rd in Birmingham. Still alive, still singing.” I look back at my life and understand that there is nothing to remember, only rock ... \".\n\nOzzy Osbourne was modest. The conquest of fans was accompanied by ups and downs. Therefore, it will be useful to find out how little Ozzy started to become a cult rock musician.\n\nChildhood and youth of John Michael Osborne\n\nJohn Michael Osborne was born in Birmingham. The head of the family, John Thomas Osborne, worked as a tool maker for the General Electric Company. My father worked mostly at night. Lillian's mother was busy during the day in the same factory.\n\nThe Osborne family was large and poor. Michael had three sisters and two brothers. Little Osborne was not very comfortable at home. My father often drank alcohol, so there were scandals between him and his mother.\n\nTo improve the atmosphere, the kids played Presley and Berry tracks and had an impromptu home concert. By the way, Ozzy's first scene was the house. In front of the household, the boy performed the song Living Doll by Cliff Richard. According to Ozzy Osbourne, after that he had a childhood dream - to create his own band.\n\nSchool years of Ozzy Osbourne\n\nThe boy did poorly at school. The fact is that Osborne suffered from dyslexia. In an interview, he said that at school he was considered a silly person because of slurred speech.\n\nThe only discipline that Osborne succumbed to was metalworking. The skills were inherited from his father. During his school years, the young man earned his first nickname \"Ozzy\".\n\nOzzy Osbourne didn't get his high school education. Since the family needed money, the young man had to get a job at the age of 15. Ozzy tried himself as a plumber, stacker and slaughterer, but did not stay anywhere for long.\n\nOzzy's Legal Trouble\n\nIn 1963, a young man tried to steal. He stole a TV for the first time and fell under the weight of the equipment to the ground. The second time, Ozzy tried to steal clothes, but in the dark he took things for the newborn. When he tried to sell them at a local pub, he was arrested.\n\nDad refused to pay a fine for his thief son. The head of the family refused to contribute the amount for educational purposes. Ozzy went to jail for 60 days. After serving time, he learned a good lesson for himself. The young man did not like being in prison. In later life, he tried not to go beyond the current legislation.\n\nThe creative path of Ozzy Osbourne\n\nAfter his release, Ozzy Osbourne decided to fulfill his dream. He became part of the young Music Machine collective. The rocker played several concerts with the musicians.\n\nSoon Ozzy founded his own band. We are talking about the cult group Black Sabbath. The collection \"Paranoid\" conquered the charts of Europe and the United States of America. The album brought the band worldwide fame.\n\nBlizzard of Ozz's debut album was released in 1980. She doubled the popularity of the young team. From that moment began a new round in the creative biography of Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nA special place in the history of rock music is occupied by the musical composition Crazy Train, which was included in the debut album. Interestingly, the track did not occupy a leading position in the music charts. However, according to fans and music critics, Crazy Train still remains the hallmark of Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Ozzy and his team presented the brilliant rock ballad Close My Eyes Forever. Osbourne performed the ballad in a duet with singer Lita Ford. The musical composition hit the top ten of the year in the United States of America and appeared in all world charts. This is one of the best ballads of our time.\n\nExtravagant antics of Ozzy Osbourne\n\nOzzy Osbourne became famous for his extraordinary antics. At the stage of preparation for the concert, the musician brought two snow-white doves to the dressing room. As planned by the singer, he wanted to release them after the performance of the song. But it turned out that Ozzy released one dove into the sky, and bit off the head of the second.\n\nAt solo concerts, Ozzy threw pieces of meat and offal into the crowd during performances. One day Osborne decided to do a \"pigeon trick\". But this time, instead of a dove, he had a bat in his hands. Ozzy tried to bite off the animal's head, but the mouse turned out to be smart and inflicted damage on the man. The singer was hospitalized right from the stage.\n\nDespite his age, Ozzy Osbourne remains completely dedicated to his work even in old age. On August 21, 2017, in Illinois, the artist organized the Moonstock rock music festival. At the end of the event, Osbourne performed Bark at the Moon for the audience.\n\nSolo career of Ozzy Osbourne\n\nThe debut compilation Blizzard Of Ozz (1980) was released with guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake. Osbourne's first solo album is the epitome of drive and hardness in rock and roll.\n\nIn 1981, the singer's discography was replenished with the second solo album Diary of a Madman. The tracks included in the collection were stylistically even more expressive, hard and driving. Ozzy Osbourne dedicated this work to the ideologue of Satanism Aleister Crowley.\n\nIn support of the second disc, the musician went on tour. During concerts, Ozzy threw raw meat at fans. The \"fans\" of the musician accepted the challenge of their idol. They brought dead animals to concerts with Ozzy, throwing them on the stage of their idol.\n\nOn a tour of the United States in 1982, Randy began work on a live compilation. Rhoads and Osbourne have always written tracks together. However, in March 1982, misfortune happened - Randy died in a terrible car accident. At first, Ozzy did not want to record an album without a guitarist, as he considered it unaesthetic. But then he hired guitarist Brad Gillies to replace Randy.\n\nIn 1983, the discography of the British rock musician was replenished with the third studio album Bark at the Moon. This record has a sad history. Under the influence of the title song, an admirer of Osbourne's work killed a woman and her two children. The musician's lawyers had to work hard to protect the reputation of the British rock musician.\n\nThe fourth studio album, The Ultimate Sin, Ozzy presented to the public only in 1986. The album peaked at number 200 on the Billboard 6 and went double platinum.\n\nIn 1988, Osbourne's discography was replenished with the fifth studio compilation No Rest for the Wicked. The new collection was on the 13th position in the US chart. In addition, the album received two platinum awards.\n\nTribute: Randy Rhoads Memorial Album\n\nThen came the album Tribute (1987), which the musician dedicated to the tragically deceased colleague Randy Rhoads.\n\nSeveral tracks were published in this album, as well as the song Suicide Solution, which is connected with a tragic story.\n\nThe fact is that under the track Suicide, an underage guy passed away. The young man committed suicide. The British singer had to repeatedly visit the courtroom to plead not guilty.\n\nThere were rumors in the circle of fans that Ozzy Osbourne's songs act on the human subconscious. The musician asked fans not to look for something in his tracks that is not really there.\n\nThen the musician visited the popular Moscow Music Peace Festival. The purpose of this event was not only to listen to the legendary musical compositions. The organizers of the festival sent all the collected funds to the Fund for the Fight against Drug Addiction.\n\nMany shocking moments awaited the guests of the festival. For example, Tommy Lee (drummer of the rock band Mötley Crüe) showed his “ass” to the audience, and Ozzy poured water from a bucket on everyone present.\n\nOzzy Osbourne in the early 1990s\n\nIn the early 1990s, the singer presented his sixth studio album. The record was called No More Tears. The compilation included the track Mama, I'm Coming Home.\n\nOzzy Osbourne dedicated this song to his love. The song peaked at #2 on the US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The tour in support of the album was called No More Tours. Osbourne was determined to end his touring activities.\n\nThe creative activity of Ozzy Osbourne was noted at the highest level. In 1994, he received a Grammy Award for a live version of I Don't Want to Change the World. A year later, the singer's discography was replenished with the seventh album Ozzmosis.\n\nMusic critics refer to the seventh studio album as one of the best collections of the musician. The album includes the musical composition My Little Man (featuring Steve Wyem), a classic that will never be lost.\n\nFounding of the Ozzfest rock festival\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the musician and his wife founded the rock festival Ozzfest. Thanks to Osborne and his wife, every year heavy music fans could enjoy the bands playing. They played in the genres of hard rock, heavy metal and alternative metal. In the early 2000s, the participants of the festival were: Iron Maiden, Slipknot and Marilyn Manson.\n\nIn 2002, MTV launched the reality show The Osbournes. The name of the project speaks for itself. Millions of fans around the planet could watch the real life of Ozzy Osbourne and his family. The show has become one of the most viewed programs. His last episode came out in 2005. The show was revived on FOX in 2009 and on VH2014 in 1.\n\nIn 2003, the musician performed with his daughter Kelly a cover version of a track from Vol. 4 changes. The musical composition became the leader of the British chart for the first time in Ozzy's career.\n\nAfter this event, Ozzy Osbourne got into the Guinness Book of Records. He is the first musician who had the largest interval between appearances in the charts - in 1970, the 4th position of this rating was occupied by the song Paranoid.\n\nSoon the singer's discography was replenished with the ninth studio album. The collection was called Under Cover. Ozzy Osbourne included tracks from the 1960s and 1970s on the record that had a strong influence on him.\n\nA few years later, the tenth album Black Rain was released. Music critics described the record as \"tough and melodic\". Ozzy himself admitted that this is the first album recorded on a “sober head”.\n\nThe British singer presented the collection Scream (2010). As part of an advertising campaign that took place at Madame Tussauds in New York, Ozzy pretended to be a wax figure. The star was waiting for guests in one of the rooms. When visitors to the wax museum passed by Ozzy Osbourne, he screamed, which caused strong emotions and genuine fear.\n\nIn 2016, the cult British singer and son Jack Osbourne became a member of the Ozzy and Jack's World Detour travel show. Ozzy was the co-host and author of the project.\n\nOzzy Osbourne: personal life\n\nThe first wife of Ozzy Osbourne was the charming Thelma Riley. At the time of the marriage, the rocker was only 21 years old. Soon there was a replenishment in the family. The couple had a daughter, Jessica Starshine, and a son, Louis John.\n\nIn addition, Ozzy Osbourne adopted Thelma's son from his first marriage, Elliot Kingsley. The family life of the spouses was not calm. Because of the wild life of Ozzy, as well as addiction to drugs and alcohol, Riley filed for divorce.\n\nA year after the divorce, Ozzy Osbourne married Sharon Arden. She became not only the wife of a celebrity, but also his manager. Sharon gave birth to Ozzy three children - Amy, Kelly and Jack. In addition, they adopted Robert Marcato, whose deceased mother was a friend of Osborne.\n\nIn 2016, a quiet family life \"shaken\". The fact is that Sharon Arden suspected her husband of treason. As it turned out later, Ozzy Osbourne was sick with sex addiction. The performer made a personal confession about this.\n\nA family council soon took place. All family members decided to send the head of the family to a special clinic. Sharon took pity on her husband and decided to postpone the divorce. When the relationship was established, Ozzy admitted that he did not suffer from sex addiction. He just made up this story to save the marriage and justify the relationship with a young girl.\n\nInteresting facts about Ozzy Osbourne\n\nThe British performer considers the amplifier given to him by his father to be the best gift. Largely thanks to this amplifier, he was taken to the first team.\n\nFor many years, the star suffered from alcohol and drug addiction.
