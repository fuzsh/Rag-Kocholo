        "text": "Ozzy Osbourne is considered a heavy metal icon due to fronting Black Sabbath and his solo career. However, The Prince of Darkness isn’t very comfortable being referred to as “metal.”\n\nHe touched on this in a new interview with Spin saying, in part, “When you get pigeonholed with a certain [genre], it can be very difficult to do something a bit lighter or an acoustic track or whatever you want to do. Back in the day, it was always just rock music. It’s still just rock music.”\n\nOsbourne also notes that there’s a difference between heavy metal and playing heavy, but they’re both lumped together in the same sub-genre.\n\nOzzy for the Rock Hall\n\nThere’s no question that Ozzy Osbourne has been incredibly influential in the rock world. However, his solo work has yet to be recognized by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nIn November, Sharon Osbourne touched on this topic in an appearance on The Adam Carolla Show. Sharon touted Ozzy’s accomplishments, including selling nearly 100 million solo albums worldwide. However, don’t expect Sharon to beg the Rock Hall for the acknowledgment.\n\n“I will never beg … So, my thing is f— you if you don’t realize that somebody really deserves to be here,” said Sharon (h/t Classic Rock).\n\nTo be eligible for induction into the Rock Hall, 25 years must pass since your debut. For Ozzy, his debut solo album, Blizzard of Ozz, was released in September 1980. This, of course, means he’s been eligible for induction since 2005. Unfortunately, The Prince of Darkness hasn’t even been nominated once.\n\nOzzy was inducted into the Rock Hall in 2006 as a member of Black Sabbath. The iconic heavy metal band was eligible was eligible for induction in 1995, since their self-titled debut album was released in February 1970. Their delayed induction is a prime example fans point to regarding the Rock Hall’s long history of overlooking heavy metal.\n\nOzzy Osbourne: His Top 40 Solo Songs Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
