        "text": "When it came to rock stars, there were few equals when it came to the wild behavior and devil-may-care attitude of the self-proclaimed \"Prince of Darkness\" himself, Ozzy Osbourne. The British-born singer was catapulted to stardom in the late 1960s when he formed the heavy metal group Black Sabbath. The band's dark, bluesy rock style, punctuated by Osbourne's eerie vocals, turned the band into a commercially viable group for several years. Osbourne and company captivated millions of fans and influenced countless other metal bands that followed. After Osbourne went solo in 1980, the rocker amped up his notoriety with a series of antics that became urban legends - most famously, biting the head off a bat onstage during a 1982 concert. Osbourne revived his career after starring on the reality series \"The Osbournes\" (MTV, 2002-05), along with wife Sharon and his children. Widely considered the first reality family sitcom, \"The Osbournes\" showcased a softer side to the former bad boy of rock and his equally entertaining family. In 2010, Osbourne's son Jack produced the documentary \"God Bless Ozzy Osbourne,\" a raw and intimate look at the rocker's life, from his humble beginnings in England, to his meteoric rise as a true original and pioneer of the heavy metal genre."
