        "text": "Glenn Hamilton October 3rd, 2023 - 1:33 PM\n\nOzzy Osbourne has had his fair share of ups and downs in recent months. The singer had been forced to pull out of California’s Power Trip festival due to ill health but then, the metal legend has also announced he intends to record another album and tour in 2024. Now, Osbourne’s wife Sharon has announced that she is working on a memorabilia museum to open in his native Birmingham in the near future.\n\nAnnouncing the news on the family’s new Osbournes Podcast, Sharon shared that she has been actively busy trying to get her husband’s memorabilia together so that such a museum can be opened in Birmingham, although she also confirmed that Ozzy himself has no (as of yet) intentions to relocate back to the UK.\n\nSpeaking on the podcast, Sharon told daughter Kelly and Jack, “I’ve been busy trying to get together daddy’s memorabilia for the memorabilia place that we’re opening in Birmingham….he’s having all of his awards [in the museum], all his stage clothes, posters, old posters from [early incarnation of Sabbath] Earth days. I’ve got so much memorabilia. We’re gonna do it totally interactive – every video, every live show of your dad’s, everything there.”It’s more of an educational thing for musicians and artists that wanna see that you can come from nothing, and if you work hard enough this is what you can get.\n\nSharon further elaborated her vision for the museum, adding, “We’re going to have a café, and in there we’re going to have every instrument you can think of. Music students can come in and we’re gonna do music classes, because there’s no music at schools anymore. We’re gonna get friends, other musicians to come in.”\n\nBirmingham, the origin city of Black Sabbath and, some would argue, the birthplace of heavy metal, has been keen to recognise Ozzy and Black Sabbath in recent months with the honour of naming the giant robotic bull from the 2022 edition of the Commonwealth Games being bestowed upon the artist. Guitarist Tony Iommi also made a surprise appearance at The Hippodrome Theatre two weeks ago to inaugurate the city’s premier of Black Sabbath-The Ballet.\n\nBlack Sabbath were formed over 50 years ago in Britain’s second largest city in 1968. With their three back to back releases of Black Sabbath, Paranoid and Master Of Reality in the early 70s, the band were pioneers of what would become the metal sound and scene and have cemented their place in the annals of its history with their occult imagery and grungy, doom sound.\n\nCurrently, there are no further details of an Ozzy museum, however updates are sure to follow in due course."
