        "text": "Birmingham is the birthplace of heavy metal.\n\nSlipknot, Slash, Slayer — they’d be nothing without the Brum boys that birthed the riffs that changed the history of rock and roll: Black Sabbath and Judas Priest.\n\nForget Peaky Blinders; heavy metal is the real reason to visit Birmingham and these must-see locations show you where metal was born.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, joe daniel price. Image Location: Birmingham, United Kingdom\n\nBirmingham: The birthplace of heavy metal\n\nThrow your devil horns in the air and headbang with us to Brum.\n\nWhere is Ozzy Osbourne from?\n\nOzzy Osbourne is from Birmingham, England. His childhood home is at 14 Lodge Road in Aston Park, north of the city center (Witton is the nearest [crazy] train station). Should you want to visit, remember that this is a residential area full of people who probably don’t want you shouting “Mama, I’m coming home!” outside in your best Brummie Ozzy Osbourne accent.\n\nWhere is Black Sabbath from?\n\nBlack Sabbath hails from Birmingham, England, as are its core members Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, and Bill Ward. Other one-time members like Geoff Nicholls and Tony Martin were also born and bred Birmingham.\n\nWhere is Judas Priest from?\n\nJudas Priest came onto the scene in Birmingham, England, not long after Black Sabbath did. Members Al Atkins, Ian Hill, and K.K. Downing were born a few miles from Birmingham in West Bromwich (where Led Zeppelin’s Robert Plant also called home), Glenn Tipton was close by in Blackheath, and Rob Halford was from just north in Sutton Coldfield.\n\nWhich Birmingham heavy metal bands are still active today?\n\nSadly, Black Sabbath is no more (though we’re still holding out hope to hear Ozzy belt the hits with Zakk Sabbath one last time). Bands that first rocked in or close to Birmingham that are still rolling today include Judas Priest, Napalm Death, and Godflesh.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, Maremagnum. Image Location: Birmingham, England\n\nBirmingham locations every metalhead must visit\n\nIf you think Birmingham swept its heavy metal history under the rug, you’ve got another thing comin’…\n\nThe Crown Inn\n\nClosest station: Birmingham New Street\n\nShuttered like so many of the clubs where heavy metal’s originators played, The Crown Inn was where Black Sabbath played their first shows as “Earth”. Judas Priest also played at 65 Station Street, the “birthplace of heavy metal”, and has recently received Grade II listing to protect its cultural significance.\n\nBlack Sabbath Bridge & Bench\n\nClosest station: Birmingham New Street\n\nWho needs Abbey Road when you’ve got the Black Sabbath Bridge? This small bridge is named for the legendary band and has a dedicated bench with Tony, Ozzy, Bill, and Geezer’s portraits displayed.\n\nAutoBrew’s Ozzy Art\n\nClosest station: Bordesley | Birmingham Moor Street\n\nThe AutoBrew bar features a mural of the Prince of Darkness. It’s a self-serve bar in Digbeth surrounded by other watering holes, including Dead Wax, which has live music.\n\nOzzy the Bull\n\nClosest station: Birmingham New Street\n\nThe easiest heavy metal landmark to see if you’re taking the train to Birmingham is Ozzy the Bull — a giant mechanical bull named after the hometown singer.\n\nIron Man\n\nClosest station: Birmingham New Street\n\nNot far from Birmingham New Street train station, an Iron Man statue stands tall outside of the town hall at Victoria Square. This large sculpture pays homage to Black Sabbath’s song and their early days of playing at Birmingham Town Hall.\n\nSt John’s Hall, Essington\n\nClosest station: Bloxwich\n\nIf you make the train trek just outside of Birmingham, you can see the Essington Working Mens Club where Judas Priest played their first gig in 1971.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, joe daniel price.
