        "text": "Marc Bolan statue in Barnes, London\n\nIn September 2002, a bust of legendary T. Rex singer Marc Bolan was unveiled at the location of the car crash that claimed his life aged 29. The T. Rex Action Group (TAG) launched Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine in 1997 (the 20th anniversary of his passing) with a memorial stone, and five years later the bronze sculpture of Bolan was revealed. It was paid for exclusively by T-Rex Action Group founder Fee Warner, sculpted by Canadian sculptor Jean Robillard, and unveiled by Bolan's son Rolan Bolan. The sculpture features lyrics from Tyrannosaurus Rex's 1968 song 'Child Star.'\n\nBrian Johnson statue in Namur, Belgium\n\nAC/DC vocalist Brian Johnson was immortalised in statue form in the Belgian city of Namur on 16th April 2023. The life-size statue made from Belgian Blue Stone commemorates Brian Johnson's first ever AC/DC concert, which took place at the city's Palais Des Expositions on 29th June 1980 four months after the death of Bon Scott. The fan-funded statue was the brainchild of AC/DC aficionados Michel Remy, Mike Davister and Georges Boussingault with support from the local radio station RTBF Classic 21. On the day of its unveiling, Brian Johnson said: \"I'd like to say a very special thank you to all the donors and fans in Namur. It's a very special place for me. It was the first might I sang with AC/DC, and I was a very nervous boy. So that memory will stay with me forever, and now that you've built this statue, honestly, I'm not worthy of it. I thank you and I'll take it in good grace. I'll never forget what you've done for me.\"\n\nMick Jagger and Keith Richards statues\n\nRolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards were honoured with statues in their hometown of Dartford, Essex on 9th August 2023. The bronze sculptures, named The Glimmer Twins in homage to Jagger and Richards' song writing partnership, are the creation of sculptor Amy Goodman. The statues capture both Jagger and Richards in the midst of live performance, and they were commissioned by Dartford Borough Council to celebrate two of the town's most famous former residents.\n\nThe Beatles statues in Liverpool\n\nThe bronze statues of all four members of The Beatles – John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison – were unveiled on Liverpool's Waterfront in December 2015. Donated by The Cavern Club, the statues were created to mark the 50th anniversary of the Fab Four's last gig in Liverpool at The Liverpool Empire. Slightly larger than life, the statues way a combined 1.2 tonnes! John Lennon is also honoured with a statue on Mathew Street and at John Lennon Airport.\n\nPhil Lynott statue in West Bromwich\n\nA Phil Lynott statue was unveiled in his birthplace of West Bromwich on what would have been the Thin Lizzy legend's 72nd birthday on Friday 20th August 2021. The monument stands at six feet tall and features a large metal plinth featuring the words: 'Phil Lynott. Son of West Bromwich. Born in this town. 20th August 1949.' On top of the sizable plinth is a bust of Phil Lynott made from bronze and galvanized steel. The whole monument was created by local sculptor Luke Perry."
