        "text": "Rock's Prince of Darkness arrived in this world on this day in 1948. John Michael Osbourne was the son of factory working parents in the industrial city of Birmingham, England. He acquired the nick name Ozzy while in grade school. Hearing the Beatles for the first time when he was 14 convinced him to become a musician, which he would, after leaving school the following year, taking on a number of jobs, dabbling in crime and doing some jail time.\n\nOzzy's musical salvation began in Rare Breed, a band that Terence 'Geezer' Butler started. It disbanded after doing just a couple of gigs and the pair recruited two members from another band's break-up - Bill Ward and Tony Iommi of Mythology, to form a group that briefly went under the names Polka Tuck Blues and Earth before settling on Black Sabbath.\n\nOther Noteworthy Classic Rock events include...\n\n1949 Jefferson Starship lead singer Mickey Thomas born.\n\n1952 .38 Special guitarist/singer Don Barnes born.\n\n1953 Molly Hatchet guitarist Duane Roland born.\n\n1961 Brian Epstein proposes he manage the Beatles.\n\n1965 Beatles release Rubber Soul in UK.\n\n1965 Keith Richards shocked on stage during Rolling Stones concert in Sacramento, CA.\n\n1969 The Rolling Stones record Brown Sugar.\n\n1971 Montreux casino catches fire during a Frank Zappa concert.
