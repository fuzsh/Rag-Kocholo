        "text": "As per the report, Ozzy Osbourne’s wife and manager, Sharon, disclosed details about upcoming special performances set to occur in his hometown of Birmingham, England. Despite concerns about Ozzy’s potential retirement from the stage and the cancellation of previous tour dates, Sharon assured that Ozzy, at the age of 75, will indeed perform live again as a final farewell to his fans.\n\nIn recent years, Ozzy has scaled back his busy touring schedule due to his battle with Parkinson’s disease and the need for surgery following a fall at home. The fall in 2019 exacerbated injuries from a near-fatal quad bike crash in 2003. Despite these challenges, Ozzy made notable appearances at the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games’ closing ceremony and an NFL game in the US in September of the same year.\n\nSharon emphasized that although Ozzy won’t embark on another tour, there are plans for two farewell shows to properly bid farewell to his fans. She suggested that the venue for these shows could be Aston Villa’s stadium, Villa Park, in Ozzy’s hometown.\n\n“He won’t tour again, but we are planning two more shows to bid farewell because he feels like ‘I have never said goodbye to my fans, and I want to do it properly,'” Sharon stated. Hinting at Villa Park as the potential venue, she added, “We will do it in Aston Villa, where Ozzy is from.”\n\nDespite the challenges Ozzy has faced, including health issues, Sharon highlighted that his voice remains in impeccable shape. She remarked, “His voice is still absolutely perfect. And all the time he has been off, he still does his singing lessons, so his voice is perfect. And he can joke, yeah. He has all these melodies in his head. Even if you don’t like his music, you can’t help but like Ozzy; he just draws you in.”"
