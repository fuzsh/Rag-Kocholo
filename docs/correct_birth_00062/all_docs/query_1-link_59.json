        "text": "John Michael Osbourne was born to John Thomas Osbourne and his wife Lillian on December 3rd, 1948. His residence was located at 14 Lodge Road, Aston, Birmingham, England. John Thomas was a professional tool maker and Lillian worked at the Lucas car factory.\n\nJohn was one of 3 brothers and 3 sisters. His two brothers were named Paul, and Tony, and his 3 sisters were named Jean, Iris, and Gillian.\n\nWhile in grammar school, John Osbourne was nicknamed \"Ozzy\", short for his last name \"Osbourne\".\n\nOzzy's 6th grade class picture: Teacher Wil Parry Williams, of Tregarth, near Bethesda, who before his retirement was headmaster of Ysgol Treborth, Bangor.\n\nOzzy is pictured at the right in his three-buttoned jacket.\n\nOzzy was born into a very poor family. He barely had any clothes. In fact, in a recent interview he said he only had one shirt, one pair of pants, and one jacket. His apartment had no indoor plumbing and no indoor bathroom. He slept in one bed with all 5 of his brothers and sisters.\n\nAt the young age of 15, Ozzy quits school and begins work as a plumbers mate. This job didn't last too long, and Ozzy moved on to a slaughter house. This is where Ozzy learned to like killing 250 cattle a day and cutting sheep guts out. That lasted a few months, before he got tired of that, and he wound up getting a job with his mother, Lillian (maiden name \"Unit\") testing car horns at the Lucas factory. This is where Ozzy's first musical influence started.\n\nDissatisfied with the low income Ozzy is earning, he turns to a life of crime. He begins robbing small clothes stores and private home. The cops keep catching him though, because he wears gloves but the fingers are cut out! His fingerprints are left all over the place. Ozzy's longest sentence was 6 weeks in the Winson Green Prison, for burglary. During this 6 week sentence, armed with a needle and a slab of graphite, Ozzy places the now famous tattoos on his body. O-Z-Z-Y across his knuckles, needles on his arms, the word \"thanks\" on his palm, and a happy face on each knee to cheer him up when he wakes up in the morning.\n\nAs a child, Ozzy loved the Beatles and always was admired by the way they commanded an audience. He made up his mind, he wanted to be just like the Beatles.\n\nWalking the streets in search of something to do, Ozzy meets and old friend who had just put a band together named \"Approach\". This band had no singer, so Ozzy said \"I'm a singer!\" Ozzy ran home and some how got his father to buy him a $50 amp and microphone. Approach was a rhythm type band and Ozz didn't like it too much, so he quit and joined another band named \"Music Machine\". That band didn't last long either. Ozzy and old time friend Terrance Butler (now known as \"Geezer\") then formed a band named \"Rare Breed\". Rare Breed really wasn't going any where so Ozzy put an ad in a local paper which said:\n\nOZZY ZIG - VOCALIST - REQUIRES BAND - OWNS OWN P.A.\n\nNow, on the other side of town, two young men by the names of Bill Ward and Tony Iommi had created a band named \"The Rest\" which had later changed their name to \"Mythology\". So Tony sees this ad in the paper reading \"Ozzy Zig\", and he thinks to himself, \"This can't be the same Ozzy I used to beat up on the playground when I was younger\", so he goes to the address on the ad, and sure enough, it's the same Ozzy. They all hook up and create \"Polka Tulk\". Polka Tulk was derived from a can of talcum powder that Ozzy found in a bathroom. The band now consists of 6 people: Ozzy Osbourne, Bill Ward, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Jimmy Phillips and Clark. It was a blues/jazz type of music with a hard edge, but Phillips and Clark didn't like that hard edge so they both quit. Polka Tulk then became \"Earth\".\n\nAt one particular Earth gig, the band was asked by mistake to play at an upscale banquet. They were asked to perform in Tux's. The people that had hired them had mistaken them for another band named Earth. The show went on, but the richy rich people in the audience were mortified by this new sound.\n\nThe band was getting a little recognition but not much. They were touring in a very beat up van making very little money. In fact, in a recent interview, Tony recounts a time where Ozzy walked to practice barefoot because he couldn't afford new shoes.\n\nOne Day an old horror movie was playing at a local theatre by the name of \"Black Sabbath\". Geezer saw this and said to himself, why would people pay good money to get the crap scared out of them? He came back to the guys and talked it over with them and decided to change their image and their name to \"Black Sabbath\". Black Sabbath would now be a doomsy, dark and \"new\" band.\n\nThe band starts playing a lot more small clubs and gaining popularity. A man by the name of Jim Simpson steps in and becomes the bands new manager. Jim had the band record a special demo album, just for him named \"For Jim\". This album contains 5 songs, consisting of the only azz session ever recorded by Black Sabbath. It features Tony Iommi playing with the style of Wes Montgomery and Bill Ward backing him upwith bebop drums. Two of the songs on this album were named \"A Song For Jim\" and \"The Rebel\". Short samples of them can be heard on a video released in the early 90's called \"The Black Sabbath Story, Vol 1\".\n\nNow playing a lot of clubs, the band gets very annoyed at the audience because people are talking to each other and not paying attention. One night Ozzy decides to paint himself purple from head to toe to attract some attention, and the funny thing is....it didn't work! It took days to get off. So finally they decide to crank up the volume so loud, that the audience can't even hear themselves think and are force to listen.\n\nFebruary, Friday the 13th, 1970, Black Sabbath's first album \"Black Sabbath is released under the Vertigo label. It was recorded in 8 hours on two four track machines and cost about $1200 to make. Ozzy couldn't wait to bring the record home to show his father and say \"Look dad, it's me on a piece of plastic!\" After his dad listened to the record, he asked Ozzy \"Are you sure you're only smoking cigarettes?\" On the gatefold of the album, the record company decided to put an upside down cross with a poem in the middle of it. The band had no idea they did this.\n\nThe poem read as follows:\n\n\"Still Falls The Rain\"\n\nStill falls the rain,\n\nThe veils of darkness shroud the blackened trees,\n\nWhich, contorted by some unseen violence,\n\nShed their tired leaves, and bend their boughs\n\nToward a grey earth of severed bird wings.\n\nAmong the grasses, poppies bleed before a gesticulating death,\n\nand young rabbits, born dead in traps,\n\nstand motionless, as through guarding the silence,\n\nthat surrounds and threatens to engulf\n\nall those that would listen.\n\nMute birds, tired of repeating yesterdays terrors,\n\nhuddle together in the recesses of dark corners,\n\nheads turned from the dead,\n\nblack swan that floats upturned in a small pool in the hollow.\n\nThere emerges from this pool a faint, sensual mist,\n\nThat traces its way upwards to caress the feet\n\nOf the headless martyr's statue\n\nWhose only achievement was to die too soon,\n\nand who couldn't wait to lose.\n\nThe cataract of darkness forms fully,\n\nThe long black night begins,\n\nYet still by the lake, a young girl waits,\n\nUnseeing she believes herself unseen,\n\nshe smiles faintly at the distant tolling bell,\n\nand the still rain falling.\n\nWith the release of this first album, the bands audience begins to grow rapidly attracting all walks of life, including self proclaimed witches and Satanists. One night the band was asked by a witch to play at a satanic ceremony. The band declined and the witch cast an evil spell over the band. Being totally freaked out by this, Ozzy had his father make aluminum crosses for all four members of the band to keep evil spirits away from them. In a recent interview, Bill Ward said he is the only one that still has the original cross. Ozzy now has 14 karat crosses!\n\nIn October 1970, the band releases their second album, \"Parnoid\". This album was made in 4 days. It was originally supposed to be named \"War Pigs\" but at the last minute was changed to Paranoid by the record company due to the Vietnam war. The very popular song \"Paranoid\" was actually recorded as just a filler song at the last minute in the studio and was never intended to become such an anthem to the group. The album hits #1 status. At this same time they decide to let Jim Simpson go as their manager. Jim was keeping to much profit. Patrick Meehan and Wilf Pine take over.\n\nIn December, Black Sabbath's first album \"Black Sabbath\" is released in the U.S. by Warner Brothers as the band tours colleges. By now that album has already hit platinum status.\n\nOzzy marries a woman by the name of Thelma Mayfair. Thelma already had a boy from a previous marriage named Elliot Kingsley who was 5 years old, so Ozzy decided to adopt him.\n\nIn march, the Paranoid album hits the #12 spot on the U.S. charts. This album goes on to sell over 4 million copies.\n\nLate 1971, The \"Master Of Reality\" album is released. This album featured a few songs that had a reference to religion in a good way, but received bad press for putting down religion. In September it went to #5 on the U.K. charts and #8 on the U.S. It reached platinum status shortly thereafter.\n\nBlack Sabbath's 4th album is released entitle \"Volume 4\". This album was originally going to be named \"Snowblind\" (a reference to cocaine usage) but the record company once again stepped in and told them \"No!\"\n\nBy November it had reached a peak of #8 on the U.K. charts and #13 in the U.S.\n\nOzzy's first offspring was born this year, a daughter by the name of Jessica Starshine Osbourne.\n\nThe Album \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" is released. This album featured the very first song which Ozzy wrote the lyrics and music to, \"Who Are You?\" (Geezer wrote 95% of lyrics to all Sabbath songs Ozzy sang.) In February it hit #4 on U.K. charts and #11 in the U.S. Within a year it had sold a million copies.\n\nApril 6th, the band performs at the Cal Jam in Ontario, CA. The band hadn't performed live for over 6 months and were given 1 days notice of this concert.The band gets paid $1000 each, but later learn that they really earned $250,000 which their manager screwed them out of.\n\nOnce again, Black Sabbath fires their management and try to take things into their own hands. Sabbath is managementless!\n\n\"Sabotage\" is released. This album featured a song entitle \"The Writ\" which told their true feelings against past management problems. It hit #7 on U.K. charts and #28 in the U.S.\n\nOzzy's first son is born, named Louis Jon Osbourne. (He is the little kid on Ozzy's solo album \"Diary Of A Madman\".)\n\nWith all the bad management problems and constant touring, Ozzy took some time off. He went home and got rid of some of his frustration by shooting all the chickens around his house.\n\nIn April, a best of album entitled \"We Sold Our Souls For Rock And Roll\" and hits #35 in the U.K. and #48 in the U.S.\n\nThe band hires new management because they can't handle it all by themselves. They hire a man by the name of Don Arden. This was how Ozzy was introduced to Sharon Arden (now Sharon Osbourne). Don is Sharon's father.\n\nIn late 1976, the \"Technical Ecstasy\" album is released. It hits #13 on the U.K. charts and #51 in the U.S.\n\nOzzy is fed up with Tony's control over the band and is also whacked out of his mind from excessive use of drugs and alcohol. On top of all of that his father dies and throws Ozzy into a deep emotional swell. He announce that he is quitting Black Sabbath.\n\nSabbath tries out a new singer by the name of Dave Walker (ex Fleetwood Mac). You can hear him singing a different version of \"Junior's Eyes\" on a well known bootleg entitled \"The Archangel Rides Again\". Ozzy gets back up on his feet and rejoins the band. All material written for the new album with Walker is destroyed because Ozzy didn't want to sing any of it.\n\nSabbath's last album with Ozzy \"Never Say Die\" is released. Ozzy dedicated a song entitled \"Junior's Eyes\" as a goodbye to his father.\n\nConstant usage of narcotics and alcohol force the band to fire Ozzy. Bill Ward is put up to do the dirty deed. Ronnie James Dio would be his replacement. This marks the lowest point in Ozzy's life.\n\n1979\n\nOzzy spends about 6 months in a hotel room getting high and drunk non stop over the breakup of Sabbath. Finally Sharon Arden (Don Arden's daughter) came to collect an old debt from Ozzy and saw the sad state he was in. Sharon gets Ozzy back on his feet and back into music.\n\n1980\n\nDon Arden stuck with Ozzy as management and let the old Sabbath go. He put together a band called \"Law\" which lasted for about 2 gigs and then was Changed to the \"Blizzard of Ozz\". The band consisted of Randy Rhoads (ex Quiet Riot), Bob Daisly (ex Uriah Heep), and Lee Kerslake (ex Uriah Heep).\n\nOzzy had been trying for weeks to get a label to sign him. Finally CBS signed him for $65,000 for his first album. CBS was having a big corporate meeting where Ozzy would meet all the top guys for the first time. CBS wasn't too interested in Ozzy because they believed they had better artists on their label. Ozzy's wife, Sharon, wanted him to make a big bang when he entered, so she suggested throwing three white doves in the air when he walked in, well, Ozzy had a little too much to drink that day (as usual), he walked in, sat down on a girl's lap, let 2 doves go, and bit the head off of the 3rd one. Let's just say everyone was in complete shock. When his wife Sharon saw this, she was laughing so hard that she urinated in her pants, and in her own words \"It wasn't just a little bit, it was a puddle!\" Ozzy was immediately kicked out of the meeting. On his way out he bit the head off of a second dove that was still in his pocket and threw the carcass at the receptionist. The press went wild with this, dubbing Ozzy \"insane\" and \"the mad man.\" The Humane Society of America would soon try to ban all performances in the states.\n\nNow, take note that this all took place before Ozzy's first solo album was even released! Ozzy was banned from ever coming back into the CBS building but they decided to release his album anyway. The album entitled \"Blizzard of Ozz\" went to #7 on U.K. charts and #21 in the U.S. it has since gone quadruple platinum.\n\n1981\n\nOzzy gets a divorce from his wife Thelma and his second solo project is released - \"Diary of a Madman\". It reaches #14 in the U.K. and #16 in the U.S.\n\nA few weeks after \"Diary of a Madman\" is released, Kerslake and Daisly are fired due to money problems and Tommy Aldridge and Rudy Sarzo take their spots.\n\nOzzy concerts were getting very involved with his audience. At the end of each show, he would catapult meat (and other leftovers from butcher shops such as stomachs and intestines) at his audience. Well, over time his audience began getting him back! Ozzy has said in a recent interview \"we had to turn this guy away from our show because he was trying to get in with an ox's head, a full head!\"\n\n1982\n\nJanuary 20th, at a concert in Des Moines, Iowa someone throws a bat on stage. Stunned by the light, the bat lay motionless and Ozzy thinking it was plastic, (of course he had to be drinking, or high on something to think this thing was plastic!) picks it up and bites the head off of it. The bat then started to flap his wings and Ozzy soon realized it wasn't fake! After the show Ozzy was immediately rushed to the hospital for rabies shots. Ozzy describes it as \"one of the most horrible, painful experiences of my life.\"\n\nFebruary 1982, Ozzy visits the Alamo, a national shrine in Texas. Drunk in his hotel room he decides to dress up as a woman and go outside to snap some pictures. During film reloading, Ozz felt the need to relieve himself. He walks over to this half knocked down wall and starts taking a leak. That piece of wall turned out to be part of the Alamo building. Ozzy was thrown in jail and banned from ever playing in San Antonio, Texas again. (a ban which was lifted in 1992)\n\nMore band member changes were made this year - Lindsey Bridgewater is hired for keyboards, Bridgewater leaves shortly after and Don Airey is hired.\n\nMarch 19th, 1982 would mark the saddest day in Osbourne history. Randy Rhoads is killed in a tragic airplane crash. The driver of the bus was a licensed pilot, who decided to do a little flying while some of the band rested on board the bus. He took up a small engine aircraft along with Jake Duncan and Don Airey for a little ride. Upon landing he extends the same invitation to Rhoads and Rachel Youngblood (a woman that did makeup). So they both go up. (And to this day, Ozzy doesn't know why they accepted The offer because they were both terrified of flying.) The pilot had just gone through a nasty divorce and it is believed that when his ex-wife had stepped off the bus he launched towards her. The wing of the plane hit the top of the bus and from there flew into a near by garage and blew up. The bus where Ozz and the rest of his band lie sleeping was badly damaged but no one was hurt inside. A lot of people don't know this, but Ozzy ran into the burning building to try and save Randy and it is said the he was still alive, but died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.\n\nIn an attempt to jump right back into the game, Ozz hires the first ax-man to come along - Bernie Torme (who later went on to be with Dee Snyder). He lasted only 3 weeks, couldn't take the pressure. Ozz then hires Brad Gillis (ex Nightranger) to fill Torme's spot.\n\nOn July 4,1982 Ozzy gets married to Sharon on the tropical island of Maui. He said he picked the 4th of July to get married so he would remember the date because of the holiday (Independence Day). Tommy Aldridge was Ozzy's best man. Ozzy didn't like the Hawaiian band playing there so he kicked them out and distributed their instruments to his band and played some acoustical versions of Goodbye to Romance, Paranoid and some old Beatles songs. (Geez, would I love to see some video of that!) Sharon also took over the role as Ozzy's new manager by buying the contract for Ozz from her own father!\n\nIn an effort to get out of a sticky situation, Ozzy is forced to put out a live album called \"Speak of the Devil\" (also called \"Talk of the Devil\" outside of the U.S.). This album was originally going to be a tribute Randy Rhoads, but Ozzy thought it was too soon after his death to release that kind of material. This album hit #14 on U.S. charts and went platinum. If you've ever seen the cover, you know that Ozzy has raspberry jam (looks like blood clots) spitting out of his mouth. Well, a few hundred albums hit the store shelves with a sticker that covered that up and made Ozzy look normal (or halfway normal). As soon as Ozzy found this out he them all recalled and sent out the way he wanted it to be.\n\nIf you ever wondered what all that cryptic writing is around Ozzy on the front cover of \"Speak of the Devil\" this is what it says: Howdy. Dial a demon productions in conjunction with graveyard graphics, proudly presents the madman of rock dumping in el satanos toiletto. The inside magic words reveal a more serious note - a tribute to Randy Rhoads, axeman. That kid was my lifeline, ya' know? He was such a dynamic player and I'd rather not talk about it anymore because it cuts me up every day of my life. Randy Rhoads rest in peace and love.\n\nSoon after the release of \"Speak of the Devil\" Ozzy shaves every inch of hair off of his head. A lot of people think it was the rabies shots from the bat incident that made his hair fall out, but this isn't true at all. their is a video taped interview in which he explains \"I was using a lot of gels and oils in my hair, and with those bright stage lights beating down on that all night long, it was making his hair very brittle and damaged. So one day I just shaved it all off!\"\n\n1983\n\nBand member changes, Gillis goes back to Night Ranger and Ozzy hires Jake E Lee.\n\nOzzy releases \"Bark at the Moon\". This album hit #19 on U.S. charts and #24 in the U.K. and eventually went double platinum.\n\nOn May 29th Ozzy performed at the Us Festival in San Bernardino, CA for a crowd of 350,000!\n\nMore band member changes, Aldrige leaves, and Carmine Appice is hired for drums. Two months later he is fired and Aldridge comes back.\n\nSeptember 2nd, 1983 Ozzy has his first offspring with Sharon, a daughter, Aimee Rachel (middle name possibly named after Rachel Youngblood who died in the plane accident with Randy.)\n\nOzzy makes a music video for \"Bark at the Moon\" which took over 8 hours to prepare him in full wolf costume.\n\n1984\n\nWhile making a video for \"So Tired\", an exploding mirror sends sharp glass into Ozzy's throat, and 8 U.S. concerts have to be postponed.\n\nThe band line up is now Don Airey on keyboards, Jake E. Lee on guitar, Bob Daisley on bass and Tommy Aldrige on drums.\n\nIn November Ozzy admits himself to the Betty Ford clinic for rehab of drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nOctober 27th Ozzy becomes a father again to another daughter - Kelly.\n\n1985\n\nJuly 15th, Ozzy reunites with Black Sabbath for the first time since their break up in 1978, to do 3 songs at the Live Aid Concert.\n\nNovember 8, 1985, Ozzy has another son, Jack Osbourne.\n\n1986\n\n\"The Ultimate Sin\" album is released. Once again, Ozzy ran into trouble with the looks of his album cover. The original cover had 3 crucifixes atop a hill in the background and the girl had no pants on. Ozzy had actually written a whole album before the \"Ultimate Sin\", but scrapped the whole thing and started from scratch because he wasn't happy with it. The album hit hit #8 in the U.K. and #6 in the U.S., and eventually went double platinum.\n\nMore band member changes included Randy Castillo taking over drums, Phil Soussan taking over on bass, and John Sinclair taking over on keyboards.\n\nThe Ultimate Sin tour proved to be an expensive one. At the meadowlands sports complex in New Jersey, Ozzy encouraged fans to rip up seats costing him $80,000 in damage.\n\nOn January 13th, 1986 Ozzy, and CBS records is sued by parents of a boy by the name of Jack McCollum, who committed suicide while listening to the \"suicide solution\" song. Ozzy is said to have subliminal messages in his music which drove the boy to do this. on December 19th, 1986 a California superior judge denies a motion to reinstate the \"suicide solution\" lawsuit citing first amendment protection. on July 18, 1988 a California appeals court upholds the decision to dismiss the lawsuit. On May 6, 1991 a district court judge in Atlanta dismisses the lawsuit on first amendment grounds. On October 1st, 1992 the Supreme Court upholds rulings that the first amendment protects Ozzy against lawsuits that allege his music encourages suicide. What does all this mean? Ozzy won! of course, don't be silly!\n\n1987\n\nThe Ultimate Ozzy video is released. A concert filmed at Kemper Arena, Kansas City, Missouri in 1986. This video went gold.\n\nIn March Ozzy films a fanatical fundamentalist preacher part for the movie \"Trick or treat\"\n\nThe long awaited \"Randy Rhoads Tribute album\" is released. A live recording featuring the late ax-man. It hits #6 in the U.S. and #13 in the U.K.and eventually made it to double platinum.\n\nOzzy picks up a new ax-man by the name of Zakk Wylde, bass is taken over by Bob Daisley\n\nJuly 17 Ozzy begins a 6 week tour of U.K. prisons where he played one song I don't have in my collection of rarities: \"Jailhouse Rock\"\n\n1988\n\nThe \"No Rest For The Wicked\" album is released. This album also had troubles with it's cover. The original cover was similar to the one that was released except Ozzy had a crown of thorns on his head, and the three girls were holding crucifixes. This album made it to #23 on U.K. charts and to #13 in the U.S.\n\n1989\n\nWicked Videos is released. A collection of 3 videos. It is certified gold.\n\nJune 4th, Ozzy has his first pay-per-view concert broadcast to all paying citizens of the U.S. The concert was performed live at the Tower Theatre in Philadelphia, P.A.\n\nOzzy's duet with Lita Ford \"Close My Eyes Forever\" is a #8 hit on the billboards singles chart.\n\nAugust 12th, Ozzy plays the Moscow peace festival in Russia with other big acts such as Motley Crue, Bon Jovi, the Scorpions, and Skid Row. A week after the show, Ozzy back at home finds a case of Russian vodka that someone gave him at the festival. He downs the 4 bottles and hits the ultimate bottom.

I've been to enough funerals to last a lifetime. It might have pushed me over the edge. I thought I was going nuts last year. I was driving around with spears. I was near the dark side.
