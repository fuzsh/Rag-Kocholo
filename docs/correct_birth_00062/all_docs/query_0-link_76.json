        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n23 Jan 2024, 13:08\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nBlack Sabbath legend Ozzy Osbourne eyes two special goodbye concerts in hometown.\n\nOzzy Osbourne, the iconic frontman of Black Sabbath, is gearing up for a poignant farewell to his live performance career.\n\nThe 75-year-old rock legend, who announced his retirement from touring due to health issues, now plans to bid adieu to his fans with two final shows in his hometown of Birmingham.\n\nOzzy's wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, shared insights into this heartfelt decision, offering hope to fans who have supported the Prince of Darkness throughout his illustrious career.\n\nSharon told the Mirror: \"He won't tour again but we are planning on doing two more shows to say goodbye as he feels like 'I have never said goodbye to my fans and I want to say goodbye properly'. We will do it in Aston Villa where Ozzy is from.\"\n\nAs Sharon suggested, these farewell shows are set to take place at the Aston Villa football stadium, Villa Park, in Birmingham.\n\nOzzy Osbourne, diagnosed with degenerative disease Parkinson’s in 2020 and undergoing major spinal surgery in 2022, faced physical challenges that led to the cancellation of his No More Tours 2 European leg in 2023.\n\nDespite these health setbacks, Sharon Osbourne noted that Ozzy's singing voice remains untouched.\n\n\"His voice is still absolutely perfect,\" she affirmed.\n\n\"Even if you don't like his music, you can't not like Ozzy; he just draws you in.\"\n\nThe decision to hold the farewell shows in Birmingham holds deep sentimental value for Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nGrowing up in the Aston area of Birmingham, Ozzy's connection to the city is profound, and these shows will allow the rock legend to bid adieu to his live performances in the place where his musical journey began.\n\nIn a surprise appearance at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in August 2022, Ozzy Osbourne took to the stage at Alexander Stadium.\n\nSinging Black Sabbath's 1970 hit Paranoid alongside band members, Ozzy showcased his enduring love for performing.\n\nThis unexpected performance offered a glimpse of his resilience and passion for connecting with his audience.\n\nOzzy Osbourne officially announced his retirement from touring in February 2023.\n\nHe said at the time: “Never would I have imagined that my touring days would have ended this way. My team is currently coming up with ideas for where I will be able to perform without having to travel from city to city and country to country.\"\n\nDespite this, Ozzy, just a month later, revealed his eagerness to return to the stage, emphasising that music was the driving force keeping him going despite being in 'constant pain.'\n\nIn September 2023, Ozzy Osbourne shared that he was feeling fit and actively working on a new album.\n\nAcknowledging his physical limitations, Ozzy expressed a deep desire to create one more album before hitting the road again. Despite the challenges, he remains resolute in his commitment to music, considering it the driving force that keeps him going.\n\nHe said: “I’m getting myself fit. I’ve done two albums fairly recently, but I want to do one more album and then go back on the road.\n\n\"I’ve come to the point where Sharon says to me, 'You know what, the truth of the matter is, you can't keep booking tours and failing, cancelling.' The only thing I've got that keeps me going is making records. But I can't do that forever. I gotta get out there.\"\n\nOzzy Osbourne's journey has been marked by both health struggles and musical triumphs.\n\nFrom the quad-biking accident in 2003 to the recent operations to address spinal issues, Ozzy has faced adversities head-on. His openness about being diagnosed with degenerative disease Parkinson’s in 2020 has not only raised awareness but also showcased his resilience in the face of challenges.\n\nAs fans eagerly anticipate these final farewell shows, Ozzy Osbourne's decision to conclude his live touring career is a poignant moment in music history."
