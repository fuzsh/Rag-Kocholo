        "text": "Ozzy Osbourne will get two chances to close the book on his performing career in his hometown of Birmingham, England.\n\nPer Rolling Stone, wife/manager Sharon Osbourne said during her live show in the U.K. that Ozzy will do two more shows to give the icon a chance for a proper goodbye to his fans. The show dates haven’t been announced, but they will take place in Birmingham.\n\nSharon said, “His voice is still absolutely perfect. And all the time he has been off he still does his singing lessons so his voice is perfect.”\n\nOzzy, of course, has been plagued with many health issues for a number of years now. He underwent spine and neck surgery in 2019 after he fell in his home in Los Angeles and aggravated old injuries he sustained from his 2003 ATV accident that nearly ended his life. The fall was so bad at one point doctors thought Ozzy would never walk again.\n\nOzzy said in an interview with U.K.'s The Sun published in August 2022 about the spine and neck surgery, “I was told, ‘You’ve got a good chance of being paralyzed for the rest of your life.’ You just don’t expect the surgeon to be a f—ing butcher. I was left in agony.”\n\nRELATED: Ozzy Osbourne: The Reason Why He Wasn't Comfortable Being Labeled as 'Metal'\n\nWife/manager Sharon Osbourne said to Rolling Stone in September 2022, “We’re going to sue. You just don’t want other people to go through what you’ve gone through.”\n\nIn February 2023, Ozzy officially canceled all remaining tour dates, citing how he’s physically unable to tour anymore.\n\nIn September 2023, The Prince of Darkness shared on The Osbournes Podcast he was having neck surgery and referred to it as his “final surgery.” Ozzy said he just can’t do the surgeries anymore and seems overall just fed up with going under the knife. Despite being over surgery, he didn’t seem nervous about it saying, “It’s all right. It’s just like going over for a f—ing haircut now.”\n\nWe certainly sent our well wishes to Ozzy and can’t wait for his final shows. A legend like him deserves to go out on his terms, regardless of the obstacles thrown his way.\n\nOzzy Osbourne: His Top 40 Solo Songs Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
