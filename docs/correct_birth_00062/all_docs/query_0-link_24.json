        "text": "The world’s biggest cake competition, which is now in its 29th year, receives over 1,500 entries each year and it attracts thousands of baking enthusiasts, cake artists, chocolatiers, and patisserie chefs from around the world.\n\nEntries opened in March for those eager to enter the much-anticipated and most prestigious cake decoration competition at Cake International. The number of entries for 2023 was expected to be in the thousands, with competitors flying in from across the globe. Previous years have seen entries from as far as Indonesia, India, China, Argentina, South Korea and the USA. Open to anyone, the competition entries are a highlight of the show celebrating the creativity and skill of cake decorators worldwide.\n\nThe event, which got underway on Friday (November 3), will showcase hundreds of cake creations until Sunday (November 5).\n\nAccording to the Fabulously Fondant web site, “Jane started her career as an Illustrator working for a publishing company, designing book covers and illustrations. Over the years she has worked in many different fields as an artist, including the decoration of motorcycles and crash-helmets, with her work featured in a major motorcycle magazine.\n\nAccording to the Fabulously Fondant web site, “Jane started her career as an Illustrator working for a publishing company, designing book covers and illustrations. Over the years she has worked in many different fields as an artist, including the decoration of motorcycles and crash-helmets, with her work featured in a major motorcycle magazine.\n\nLast month, Ozzy told Metal Hammer magazine that he was hoping to reunite with Watt and record at his new studio in the U.K.\n\n“I’m just starting to work on it now, and we’ll be recording in the early part of next year,” he said. “I want to take my time with this one.”\n\nOzzy also offered an update on his health after undergoing his “final surgery” in September.\n\n“I’ve had all the surgery now, thank god,” he told Metal Hammer. “I’m feeling okay — it was just dragging on. I thought I’d be back on my feet months ago, I just couldn’t get used to this mode of living, constantly having something wrong. I can’t walk properly yet, but I’m not in any pain anymore and the surgery on my spine went great.”\n\nOzzy underwent extensive spinal surgery and other treatment following a fall at home in 2019 that aggravated injuries he suffered in a near-fatal quad bike crash in 2003.\n\nThis past July, Ozzy canceled his appearance at the Power Trip festival due to his ongoing health issues.\n\nOzzy‘s health issues, including catching COVID-19 more than a year and a half ago, forced him to cancel some of his previously announced tours.\n\nWhile Osbourne‘s health issues forced him to scrap most of his live appearances, the legendary BLACK SABBATH frontman said he would return if his condition improved.\n\nDespite his health problems, Osbourne has performed a couple of times in the last year and a half, including at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in August 2022 and at the NFL halftime show at the season opener Los Angeles Rams and Buffalo Bills game in September 2022.\n\n“Patient Number 9” won a Grammy in the “Best Rock Album” category at the 65th annual Grammy Awards, which was held in February at the Crypto.com Arena (formerly the Staples Center) in Los Angeles, California.\n\nOzzy previously won three Grammy Awards and received eight nominations. In 1993 Ozzy won a solo Grammy Award for “Best Metal Performance” for “I Don’t Want To Change The World” and two Grammys as a member of BLACK SABBATH for “Best Metal Performance” in 2000 for “Iron Man” and in 2013 for “Best Metal Performance” for “God Is Dead?” from “13”.\n\n“Patient Number 9” was released in September 2022 and marked Ozzy‘s 13th solo studio album. The critically acclaimed album topped his previous chart entries with record-breaking numbers around the world. In the U.S., the album debuted at No. 1 on multiple charts: Top Album Sales (Ozzy‘s first No. 1 ever on this chart), Top Current Album Sales (another first), Top Rock & Alternative Albums, Top Rock Albums, Top Hard Rock Albums, Top Vinyl Albums and Tastemaker Albums charts; and at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Globally, the album charted at No. 1 in Canada (Ozzy‘s first-ever No. 1 there); career-high No. 2 entries in the U.K., Australia, Finland and Italy; No. 6 in the Netherlands and New Zealand; No. 8 in Belgium; and No. 14 France. Other highlights include No. 2 in Austria, Germany and Sweden; No. 3 in Switzerland; and No. 4 in Norway."
