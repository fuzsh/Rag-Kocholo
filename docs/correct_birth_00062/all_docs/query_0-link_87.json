        "text": "'Birthplace of heavy metal' pub given listed status\n\n15 March 2024\n\nBy Andrew Dawkins , BBC News, West Midlands\n\nA pub dubbed the birthplace of heavy metal where Black Sabbath played their first gig has been given Grade II listed status.\n\nCampaigners had worried The Crown, on Station Street in Birmingham, was under threat.\n\nConcerns followed news that nearby The Electric - believed to be England’s oldest working cinema - would close; a move placing a question mark over the future of that part of the city.\n\nHistoric England said, however, that on its advice the pub had been listed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nOriginally named the General Elliott, the venue was thought to have opened in 1876, Historic England added.\n\nClosing in 2014 after being bought by a Japanese development company, it has remained derelict after a project to restore it as a live music venue failed.\n\nThe Crown hosted local acts that went on to become household names including Led Zeppelin and UB40.\n\nOzzy Osbourne's Black Sabbath, then known as Earth, performed their first gig at Henry's Blueshouse upstairs, Historic England stated.\n\nIt said the pub was a cultural landmark that \"fittingly is almost within sight of Ozzy the bull\", the mechanical bovine created for the city's Commonwealth Games that now stands in New Street railway station.\n\nBlack Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi said: \"Cities all over the UK are protecting their musical heritage, Birmingham shouldn’t be left behind.\n\n\"The Crown has huge significance to us and many other successful acts.\"\n\nThousands of people have signed a petition as part of a campaign to protect the Station Street area, also home to The Old Rep theatre.\n\nBirmingham City Council has said no planning applications for development there have been submitted.\n\nHistoric England said listed status for the pub provided certain protections and meant special \"consent must be applied for to make any changes to that building which might affect its special interest\".\n\nThe pub was likely designed by Thomson Plevins, the architect best known for the city's Grade II* listed Grand Hotel, Historic England added.\n\nIt said local legend \"had it that The Crown's cellars stored the remains of fallen soldiers\" during World War One before they were taken through a tunnel to nearby church, St Martin.\n\nThe Crown was a \"one-of-a-kind building with history written in its walls\", according to the preservation group.\n\nBirmingham Music Archive founder Jez Collins said the stage Black Sabbath \"first stood on is still there\".\n\nThe music historian added: \"We need to ensure The Crown reopens, we need to bring it back to life as a cultural venue, a music venue and a place people will want to visit.\""
