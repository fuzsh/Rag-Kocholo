        "text": "Plans to open an Ozzy Osbourne museum in the musician’s hometown of Birmingham have been announced. As well as housing Osbourne's archive of memorabilia from his career, it will also have a focus on music education.\n\nSpeaking on a new episode of ‘The Osbournes Podcast’, Ozzy’s wife and manager Sharon Osbourne explains: “We’re gonna do it totally interactive - every video, every live show … everything there. It’s more of an educational thing for musicians and artists that want to see that you can come from nothing, and if you work hard enough this is what you can get”.\n\nAs for what will be on display, she says that the museum will include “all of his awards, all his stage clothes, posters … I’ve got so much memorabilia”.\n\nBut beyond that, she goes on, “we’re going to have a café, and in there we’re going to have every instrument you can think of. Music students can come in and we’re gonna do music classes, because there’s no music at schools anymore. We’re gonna get friends, other musicians to come in”."
