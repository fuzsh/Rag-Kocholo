        "text": "Ozzy Osbourne, born John Michael Osbourne in Birmingham, England, is a legendary figure in the world of rock and heavy metal music. As the frontman for the pioneering band Black Sabbath and later as a solo artist, Osbourne has left an indelible mark on the music industry with his distinctive voice, electrifying stage presence, and tumultuous life story.\n\nOsbourne rose to prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s as the lead vocalist of Black Sabbath, a band credited with laying the foundation for heavy metal music. With iconic albums like \"Paranoid\" and \"Master of Reality,\" Black Sabbath revolutionized the genre with their dark, heavy sound and themes of doom and despair.\n\nAfter parting ways with Black Sabbath in the late 1970s due to personal and professional conflicts, Osbourne embarked on a highly successful solo career, earning attention for his outrageous public acts and drawing the ire of conservative groups. His debut solo album, \"Blizzard of Ozz,\" released in 1980, showcased his dynamic vocal range and songwriting prowess, spawning hits like \"Crazy Train\" and \"Mr. Crowley.\" Osbourne's subsequent solo albums further solidified his status as a metal icon, earning him legions of devoted fans worldwide.\n\nThroughout his career, Osbourne's life has been marked by controversy, including struggles with substance abuse, legal issues, and personal tragedies. Despite these challenges, he has persevered, becoming a symbol of resilience and redemption in the world of rock music. He is the recipient of multiple awards, including Grammys; the GQ Men of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award; and the Global Icon Award from the MTV Europe Music Awards. He has been honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and both he and Black Sabbath were inducted into both the UK Music Hall of Fame and Rock and Roll Music Hall of Fame. In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Osbourne at number 112 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\n\nBeyond his music career, Osbourne has also achieved success in other ventures, including reality television. His family's MTV reality show, \"The Osbournes,\" which aired from 2002 to 2005, offered viewers a candid glimpse into his personal life, garnering a new legion of fans and further cementing his status as a cultural icon.\n\nDespite health issues -- spinal injuries led to the end of concert touring in 2018 and he is battling Parkinson's disease -- Osbourne continues to captivate audiences with his enduring legacy. With a career spanning over five decades, he remains one of the most influential and beloved figures in the history of rock music, earning him the title of the \"Prince of Darkness\" and a lasting place in music history."
