From 1977-1978, he made his first attempt at a solo career with former Necromandus members Barry Dunnery, Dennis McCarten, and Frank Hall, until by request by his former band members, he returned to Black Sabbath in 1978 to record the album Never Say Die!. After he was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, he started his second attempt at a solo career with former Quiet Riot guitarist Randy Rhoads, former Rainbow members keyboardist Don Airey and bassist Bob Daisley, and former Uriah Heep drummer Lee Kerslake and the band was called under the name \"Blizzard of Ozz\". However, their record label wanted to promote Ozzy as a solo artist.\n\nAfter the death of Randy Rhoads, he was briefly replaced by Bernie Tormé.\n\nBernie was replaced by Brad Gillis.\n\nBrad was reportedly briefly replaced by George Lynch.\n\nGeorge was replaced by Jake E. Lee.\n\nJake was replaced by Zakk Wylde.\n\nOzzy temporarily retired.\n\nHe eventually achieved a multi-platinum solo career which revolutionized the heavy metal genre.[1], As a result, he is known as the \"Godfather of Heavy Metal\", and, because of some of his material, the \"Prince of Darkness\".\n\nIn the early 2000s, his career as a celebrity hit a new zenith when he became a star in his own reality show, The Osbournes, alongside wife/manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack. In August 2008, Osbourne stated in USA Today that he intends to retire from his music career after two more albums.[2]\n\nMusicians[]\n\nGuitarists[]\n\nBarry Dunnery (1977-1978)\n\nRandy Rhoads (1979-1982)\n\nBernie Tormé (1982)\n\nBrad Gillis (1982)\n\nJake E.
