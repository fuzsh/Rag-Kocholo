        "text": "The world left John Ozzy Osbourne behind a long time ago - possibly at birth. The man has been trying to catch up ever since, first in his band Black Sabbath, then with his family's television show The Osbournes, in which even his attempts to \"crack one out\" in a room he thought was sealed from cameras ended up on TV.\n\nAny Prince of Darkness worthy of the title might expect a life of mild struggle, and much of it he has already shared with us. Anything left for an autobiography? Happily, yes, some of it pathetic and maudlin, much grimly entertaining. We laugh at him, but he doesn't mind; Osbourne abandoned any attempt at dignity long ago, plumping for what-me-worry survival in the face of diversity. His life was soap years before MTV began documenting it, a place where biting the heads off animals and quad bike calamities seem a gentle diversion in an everyday saga of raising erratic children (seven in all) and four decades of rasping his satanic metal. His ghostwriter has faithfully captured his voice (Osbourne has many talents, prose stylist probably not among them), and some of his anecdotes you will want to recite to anyone passing.\n\nIt is hard not to enjoy the many, many times Osbourne gets plastered (\"It wasn't like being drunk, it was like having a head injury\") or his remorse when sober. Then there is his charming naivety over the impact The Osbournes would have on family life. \"Our first big mistake was letting them do all the filming at our real house,\" King Solomon reckons. If you had taken him aside in the first few weeks of filming in 2001 and told him the cameras would still be recording each meltdown three years later, \"I'd have shot myself in the balls.\"\n\nThe shadow of an over-primped Sharon Osbourne is everywhere, her ambition smouldering backstage at OzzFest until it burnt through on television. Or as Ozzy puts it: \"She'd be the next fucking test card if she had her way.\"\n\nThroughout, Osbourne treats his music seriously, which doubles our pleasure. The survival of Black Sabbath is regarded as celestially ordained, while there is much bile directed at miscreant band members and managers, not least Don Arden, Sharon's dad. The singer acknowledges that he was not entirely blameless in these contretemps, and cannily pinpoints the moment when his relationship with Arden began to go wrong. \"It wasn't long after I almost pissed in my new father-in-law's face that he stopped calling me Ozzy.\" Arden is dead now, but John Osbourne from Aston has somehow pulled through. Divine intervention."
