        "text": "There’s a great Black Sabbath live show from 1975 that you can listen to on YouTube, which finds the band at their peak, playing songs from their entire discography with breathtaking power and precision. It’s like watching the Moon crash into the Earth, gasping in horror as the world is incinerated but finding beauty in the cataclysmic hues of red, yellow and orange. Towards the end of the show, after “Spiral Architect” and before “Children of The Grave,” singer Ozzy Osbourne says, “We’d just like to say on behalf of the guys and myself, you’re a good bunch of people and we love each and everyone of you.” There’s a sincerity to it. I believe him. For a guy that bills himself as “the f***ing prince of darkness,” that Ozzy, he seems like a pretty good guy.\n\nOf course besides his amiability, Ozzy’s also a complete lunatic who’s battled alcoholism and drug addiction, defiled U.S. historical sites, been arrested multiple times and bitten the heads off doves and bats. He’s also a reality television star and most importantly one of the greatest singers and frontmen in rock n’ roll. His multiple incarnations are the subject of The Nine Lives Of Ozzy Osbourne, the latest installment of A&E‘s Biography series, which premiered this past Monday.\n\nBorn John Michael Osbourne in 1948, Ozzy grew up in the battle ruins of post-World War II Britain. We see him revisit his impossibly small childhood home in Birmingham, England, where he was one of six children. Both parents worked factory jobs, his mother going to work after his father finished his night shift. “I felt like a peasant,” he says, “dirty” and “unclean.” He suffered from anxiety and a “fear of impending doom.”\n\nAn undiagnosed dyslexic, Ozzy was a bad student and class clown. He dropped out at 15, working soul crushing factory jobs like his parents, but wanted out. He tried his hand as a petty thief, but wasn’t very good at it. After six weeks in jail for burglary he decided to become a musician, borrowing 250 pounds from his dad to buy a microphone and a PA.\n\nThe future Black Sabbath formed after Ozzy posted an ad at a local music shop. Owning a PA got him the job as lead singer. Inspired by The Beatles, blues, horror movies and the occult, they would help codify modern heavy metal, both musically and lyrically. On the back of heavy touring they were an almost immediate success. Ozzy says the first things he bought once he had money were new shoes and socks and a bottle of cologne, ever self-conscious of the squalor of his youth.\n\nBy the time of Sabbath’s fourth album, they were doing so much coke they thanked their dealers in the liner notes. Drugs ruined relationships, including Ozzy’s first marriage, but also helped him deal with depression, fear and loss. He blames the 1977 death of his father for a bender which resulted in him being kicked out of the band.\n\nDown and out in Los Angeles, Ozzy’s life and career were resuscitated by Sharon Levy, whose father managed Black Sabbath. Sharon set him up with the backing band that would update his sound and image for the 1980s, centered around the brilliant young guitarist Randy Rhoads. Sadly, Rhoads would die in a freak airplane accident in 1982 and the singer coped the only way he knew how, with alcohol and drugs. By then, however, he was a big enough solo star that he could get as wasted as he wanted and wake up the next morning with his career intact.\n\nOzzy and Sharon were married in 1982 and she was pregnant with their oldest daughter Aimee 5 months later. He checked into rehab following the birth of daughter Kelly but relapsed 45 minutes after being discharged. The Osbourne kids say they adapted to their father’s addiction and erratic behavior. Crazy was normal. Things reached a head in 1989 when a drugged out Ozzy attacked his wife and was arrested for attempted murder. Following 6 months of treatment he was mostly sober, not without the occasional relapse, but never sinking to the depths of the past.\n\nWhat Sharon Osbourne calls “the four ring circus” of the family’s homelife became the premise for the hit reality television show The Osbournes. It made Ozzy a household name and a celebrity who rubbed elbows with the President, quite a feat for the boy from Birmingham “grew up with nothing,” as Kelly Osbourne notes. Despite their outrageousness, the Osbourne family clearly loved each other, pulling together in the bad times and celebrating like rock stars when things were good.\n\nThere’s no new revelations in The Nine Lives Of Ozzy Osbourne, no deeper examination of his life or artistry, but his charm and common touch are enough to keep you watching. It ends with the new 71-year-old Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee coping with old age, some illness, but happy to be here in one piece and eager to keep delivering music to his fans. As he says at the special’s conclusion, “You know the time when I will retire? When I can hear them nail a lid on my box. And then I’ll f***ing do an encore.”\n\nBenjamin H.
