        "text": "Actress, singer and fashion designer Kelly Osbourne is the daughter of heavy-metal musician Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nSynopsis\n\nKelly Osbourne was born in London, England on October 27, 1984. The daughter of heavy-metal musician Ozzy Osbourne, and his wife, Sharon Osbourne, Kelly came to fame in the early 2000s with the MTV reality show about her family, The Osbournes. She’s since parlayed the program’s success into a career that has put her in the recording studio, ignited a fashion design career and created additional television opportunities.\n\nEarly Life\n\nActress, singer and fashion designer Kelly Osbourne was born Kelly Lee Osbourne on October 27, 1984, in London, England. The second of three Osbourne children born to heavy-metal singer Ozzy Osbourne and his wife, Sharon Osbourne, Kelly was raised in the shadow of her father’s hair-raising, often wild career as Black Sabbath’s lead singer.\n\nKelly’s home life was scarred by her father’s swings between sobriety and addiction. In her youth, Kelly, along with her older sister, Aimee, and younger brother, Jack, often witnessed her parents fighting. The most volatile of those occasions came in 1989, when a drug-enraged Ozzy tried to strangle his wife. Somehow the Osbourne marriage survived the incident, and Ozzy spent several months in a mental health facility following the episode.\n\nWorried that his children might one day face the same addiction issues that he faced, Ozzy sat his children down when Kelly was just 8 years old, and warned them, “One of you, if not all of you, will have ‘the gene.’”\n\nBy age 15, Kelly seemed to have paid little attention to her father’s words. With Ozzy’s newfound commitments to staying clean and family life, the Osbournes settled in Beverly Hills, California. In her adopted country, the young Kelly was a regular at Los Angeles’ biggest nightclubs. Her mother did her best to keep tabs on Kelly, even hiring a private investigator to research her daughter’s first boyfriend. “That was my mum,” Kelly later said. “That’s just what she does.”\n\nCommercial Success\n\nIn 2002, MTV showcased a new reality series that documented the strange, sometimes frenetic suburban life of the Osbourne family. The Osbournes, which went off the air in 2005, proved to be a monster of a hit, and Kelly was at the heart of its success.\n\nFans instantly gravitated toward Kelly’s sharp opinions and her overall outsized personality. Not long after the show’s debut, Epic signed Kelly to a record deal. In November 2002, she released a cover of Madonna’s hit, “Papa Don’t Preach.” Name recognition certainly helped Kelly garner fame as a singer, and her “Papa” rendition climbed the U.K. music charts. It’s parent album, Shut Up!, however, fared poorly, and Epic eventually dropped Kelly from its lineup.\n\nRocky Years\n\nThe fame that The Osbournes had brought Kelly and her family seemed to be quickly fading away, making Kellly feel vulnerable. Soon, the same kind of addiction that had once nearly ruined Ozzy Osbourne’s life began to take hold of his daughter’s: Around this time, Kelly was drinking heavily and taking drugs frequently. Her biggest vice was pain killers. At the height of her addiction, she was taking 60 Vicodin tablets a day.\n\n“What bugs me the most is that people think I was a party girl and I went around having a great time,” Kelly later recalled. “I did drugs because I hated myself and I was miserable, and I didn’t want to think about it anymore.”\n\nIn 2006, Kelly checked herself into rehab for the first time. Her life since then has followed a similar path as her father’s. She’s gone through periods of sobriety and intense work, with periodic struggles with her addictions.\n\nIn 2004, Kelly launched her first fashion line, debuting her “Stiletto Killers.” Her love life began to take off around the same time, and by 2009, she was engaged to model Luke Warrall. She had published a memoir, suitably calledFierce. That same year, however, Kelly was arrested for allegedly hitting a journalist at a nightclub.\n\nTV Life\n\nOutside of The Osbournes, Kelly has appeared on several TV programs. She’s also done a fair amount of stage and film work. Most memorably, perhaps, was her third place finish on ABC’s dance-competition showDancing with the Stars.\n\nMore recently, Kelly was tapped to appear alongside Joan Rivers on the E! Entertainment series Fashion Police.\n\nCredit\n\n+ This biography is courtesy of Biography.com\n\nAdditional Reading"
