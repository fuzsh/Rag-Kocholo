        "text": "John Michael \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English heavy metal singer.\n\nOsbourne was born in Marston Green Hospital in Marston Green, England. [2], He grew up in Aston, Birmingham, England. He has dyslexia.[3] He was convicted of burglary when he was a teenager,[3] for which he was fined. He was sent to prison for not paying the fine.\n\nOsbourne was the lead singer for Black Sabbath between 1968 and 1978. He joined again in 1997 for occasional tours. Osbourne and Bob Daisley wrote a song called 'Suicide Solution', which was released on Blizzard of Ozz. It was heavily ridiculed claiming it was about suicide, which coincided with the words \"shoot, shoot\" whispered in the song.[4] Osbourne was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio in June 1979. However, Daisley states it's about Osbourneâ€™s substance and alcohol abuse. He bit the head off of a bat on stage while on a solo tour in Des Moines, Iowa supporting the Bark at the Moon album.\n\nHe and his wife Sharon have three children together: Aimee, Kelly and Jack. He also has three children from his first marriage to Thelma Riley:[5] Elliot, Jessica, and Louis.\n\nOsbourne released his first solo album, Blizzard of Ozz in 1980.\n\nHe was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2000, which he publicly revealed in January 2020.[6]\n\nSolo albums[change | change source]\n\nBlizzard of Ozz (1980)\n\nDiary of a Madman (1981)\n\nBark at the Moon (1983)\n\nThe Ultimate Sin (1986)\n\nNo Rest for the Wicked (1988)\n\nNo More Tears (1991)\n\nOzzmosis (1995)\n\nDown to Earth (2001)\n\nUnder Cover (cover album, 2005)\n\nBlack Rain (2007)\n\nScream (2010)\n\nOrdinary Man (2020)\n\nPatient Number 9 (2022)\n\nFilmography[change | change source]\n\nYakety Yak, Take it Back (1991) ...
