        "text": "Artist Robert Jeffcott creates Ozzy Osbourne mural in Ozzy's hometown of Birmingham. This week (3rd December) the The Prince of Darkness celebrated his 74th birthday. With many well wishes around the world a nice gift from a fan painted this great mural.\n\nJeffcott spent around fifteen hours drawing the portrait of the legendary Ozzy Osbourne. The artist gave the reason why he painted an Ozzy Osbourne mural â€œI only really paint people I admire. Heâ€™s just a living legend, probably the most well-known iconic musician to come from Birmingham. Having people walk past it and do little snaps to tag me on Instagram, itâ€™s good for me. Iâ€™ve only had good feedback from it.â€\n\nThe artist used â€œscribble method cover[ing] the surface of a blank wall in scribbles and doodles. The wall is then photographed and . . . layered with the image he paints with the scribbles and then used as a reference point.â€\n\nOzzy Osbourne Mural\n\nRobert Jeffcott has some other great artworks to see on his Instagram page including portraits of Jimi Hendrix, Eminem, Amy Winehouse and a great artwork of \"The Dude\" from The Big Lebowski.\n\nOsbourne often speaks with pride when his hometown of Birmingham comes up in interviews and conversations. It's the town that is the birth of Black Sabbath back in 1968.\n\nAt a show in Birmingham in 2019 Ozzy said â€œI donâ€™t get the chance to go and see Birmingham very often. Iâ€™ve never ever tried to hide my accent, and Iâ€™ve never denied that Iâ€™m from Birmingham. Iâ€™m absolutely so proud of what Iâ€™ve done with my life, itâ€™s unbelievable. Just hold on to your dreams, because you know what? Every once in a while they come true.â€\n\nHe adds, â€œI am just a guy from Birmingham whoâ€™s been blessed to have had such dedicated fans throughout my career.â€\n\nOzzy and Sharon recently moved back to England for the new BBC reality series Home to Roost, the show is set to launch in 2023.\n\nOzzy Osbourne Merchandise"
