        "text": "Featuring his memorabilia from over the decades\n\nSharon Osbourne has revealed that plans are afoot for an Ozzy Osbourne memorabilia museum in the metal legend’s home city of Birmingham.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Black Sabbath were the subject of a three-month exhibition called Black Sabbath 50 Years at Birmingham Music & Art Gallery, and now Sharon Osbourne says that Ozzy will be getting his own exhibition.\n\nSpeaking about her future plans in the latest edition of The Osbournes Podcast, Sharon told daughter Kelly and son Jack: “I’ve been busy trying to get together daddy’s memorabilia for the memorabilia place that we’re opening in Birmingham.”\n\nWhen Jack asked if this means his dad is moving back to Birmingham, Sharon replied: “No, but he’s having all of his awards, all his stage clothes, posters, old posters from Earth days (in the museum). I’ve got so much memorabilia.”\n\nPraising Birmingham, Sharon enthused: “It’s great there now. It’s fantastic. It’s a whole different city. It’s amazing. I call it the heartbeat of the UK because people are so great there.”\n\nMoving back to the museum, she added: “We’re gonna do it totally interactive – every video, every live show of your dad’s, everything there. It’s more of an educational thing for musicians and artists that wanna see that you can come from nothing, and if you work hard enough this is what you can get.\n\n“Also, we’re going to have a café attached, and in there we’re going to have every instrument you can think of. Music students can come in and we’re gonna do music classes, because there’s no music at schools anymore. We’re gonna get friends and other musicians to come in.”\n\nOver the summer, the giant mechanical bull that featured in the 2022 Commonwealth Games was named 'Ozzy' after Birmingham's favourite son, Ozzy Osbourne, following a public vote.\n\nOn 26th July, Ozzy was unveiled at a ceremony at its new home Birmingham’s New Street station with Sharon Osbourne and Ozzy’s sister Jean in attendance.\n\nLast month, Black Sabbath – The Ballet launched at the Birmingham Hippodrome with a special guest performance of ‘Paranoid’ from Tony Iommi.\n\nStars that walked the purple carpet included Led Zeppelin’s Robert Plant, ELO co-founder Bev Bevan, Black Sabbath’s Geezer Butler and Sharon Osbourne.\n\nThe humble childhood homes of famous musicians, including Ozzy Osbourne:\n\nListen to Absolute Radio across the UK on your digital radio, the free Rayo app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen or by asking your smart speaker to \"play Absolute Radio\"."
