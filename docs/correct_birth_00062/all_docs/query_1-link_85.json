        "text": "Synopsis\n\nSince the Black Sabbath singer fell at home in 2019, Ozzy Osbourne has performed during the closing ceremony at the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games and an NFL game in the US in September of the same year. Where will he perform his final show?\n\nEnglish musician John Michael \"Ozzy\" Osbourne wants to perform his final shows in his home city Birmingham. According to the 'Mirror', his wife Sharon Osbourne said, \"He won't tour again but we are planning on doing two more shows to say goodbye as he feels like 'I have never said goodbye to my fans and I want to say goodbye properly'.\" She seemingly suggested that the venue could be Aston Villa's stadium Villa Park. She added: \"We will do it in Aston Villa where Ozzy is from. Sarah Osbourne manages the Birmingham-born Black Sabbath frontman.\n\n\"His voice is still perfect\"\n\nSarah said further, \"His voice is still absolutely perfect. And all the time he has been off he still does his singing lessons so his voice is perfect. And he can joke yeah. He has all these melodies in his head. Even if you don't like his music you can't not like Ozzy, he just draws you in.\"\n\nSarah Osbourne told the BBC that her husband still felt a deep connection to Birmingham and planned to spend more time there.\n\nShe said the music legend, who performed at the city’s closing ceremony for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, remained a Birmingham boy. She said, \"When he’s dreaming, he never dreams he’s in LA, he always dreams he’s in Birmingham.\"\n\nOsbournes will return to UK\n\nThe couple live in the US, but they plan to move back to the UK this year. She became a media personality in her own right due to 'The Osbournes', a reality TV show about the couple and their children that began in 2002. She said, \"I don’t sing, I don’t dance, I can’t go and entertain with anything other than my life experience.\"\n\nSarah Osbourne said she hopes to finalize plans to open an Osbourne museum and music school in Birmingham. She said, \"You can come and see all of Ozzy’s accolades [and]everything from his past.\"\n\nThe Black Sabbath singer fell at home in 2019 which aggravated injuries from a near-fatal quad bike crash in 2003. Since that time, Osbourne has performed during the closing ceremony at the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games and an NFL game in the US in September of the same year.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhere may Ozzy Osbourne hold his final show?\n\nSarah Osburne seemingly suggested that the venue of Ozzy Osbourne's final show could be Aston Villa's stadium Villa Park. She said, \"We will do it in Aston Villa where Ozzy is from.\" Sarah Osbourne manages the Birmingham-born Black Sabbath frontman.\n\nWhen did John Michael \"Ozzy\" Osbourne perform last?\n\nJohn Michael \"Ozzy\" Osbourne performed during the closing ceremony at the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games and an NFL game in the US in September of the same year.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
