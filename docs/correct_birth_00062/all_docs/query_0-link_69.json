        "text": "Tram operator Centro have named a tram after Birmingham rocker Ozzy Osbourne, as he visited his hometown to see the final testing of the new metro extension between Bull Street and New Street Station.\n\nThe Midland Metro’s current service runs from Wolverhampton to Birmingham and carries an estimated 5.2 million passengers a year, with 16 trams making the 37 minute journey. The Ozzy tram will be part of a new fleet of 21 vehicles to service the extension, which will run to the revamped New Street ‘Grand Central’ station.\n\nOzzy, who was born in Aston, said “It’s a great honour to have a new tram named after me, I’m proud to be a Brummie and this means so much”. When asked whether or not he’d like to own a tram, he said, “…no thank you. A crazy train, maybe, but not a tram”. The Prince of Darkness did get to ride the service, but solo, as it’s not actually open yet – although driver training is underway.\n\nIn a separate announcement, the Department for Transport has given formal approval for the extension from Stephenson Street to Centenary Square via Victoria Square which is due for completion in 2019; so work shall continue!\n\nWhich local celeb would you have your hometown name a vehicle after?"
