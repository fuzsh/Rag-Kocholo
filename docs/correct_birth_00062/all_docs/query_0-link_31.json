        "text": "Black Sabbath has been so influential in the development of heavy metal rock music as to be a defining force in the style. The group took the blues-rock sound of late ’60s acts like Cream, Blue Cheer, and Vanilla Fudge to its logical conclusion, slowing the tempo, accentuating the bass, and emphasising screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies. If their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition, Black Sabbath took that tradition in a new direction, and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later – William Ruhlmann of allmusic\n\nThough rock music has developed over many decades it can be defined by a small number of key moments. Three of them stand out for me.\n\n1) On the 5th of July, 1954, a trio of musicians called Elvis Presley, Scotty Moore and Bill Black met at Sun studios in Memphis to rehearse and record a handful of songs. During the break, Elvis began “acting the fool” with a blues song called “That’s All Right (Mama)”. When the other two musicians joined in, the owner of Sun Studios Sam Phillips got them to restart and began taping. The song was released barely two weeks later and became, according to Rolling Stone magazine, the first rock-and-roll record.\n\n2) During the spring of 1965 a young singer-songwriter called Bob Dylan, at that time so disillusioned that he was considering quitting the music business, composed a 10-page long verse that he himself described as “vomit”. During the two days of the 15th and 16th of June, this was turned into the song called “Like a Rolling Stone” that revolutionised popular music. Bruce Springsteen said when inducting Dylan in to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that, “He invented a new way a pop singer could sound, broke through the limitations of what a recording could achieve, and he changed the face of rock’n’roll for ever and ever.” Elvis Costello commented in 2003, “What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes ‘Like a Rolling Stone'”\n\n3) In 1968 guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward, who had briefly played together in a band called Mythology, recruited bassist Geezer Butler and singer Ozzy Osbourne to form a new outfit called The Polka Tulk Blues Band. All four came from poor, working-class backgrounds in Aston, Birmingham. Tony Iommi had lost the tips of two of his fingers while working in a sheet metal factory at the age of 17. Ozzy had left school at 15 and worked in various jobs including at a slaughterhouse. He had also spent six weeks in prison for failing to pay a fine. By 1969 the band had changed their name to Black Sabbath, inspired by a poster for the film of the same name starring Boris Karloff. They were signed to Philips Records in November and given two days of studio time to record and mix their first single and their debut album. According to Iommi, “We just went in the studio and did it in a day, we played our live set and that was it. We actually thought a whole day was quite a long time, then off we went the next day to play for £20 in Switzerland.” The album was released on the 13th of February 1970 and within a year had sold a million copies. It also single-handedly launched a new genre of popular music: heavy metal.\n\nBarely four months later, Black Sabbath recorded their second LP, entitled “Paranoid” after the track that was written and recorded in twenty minutes at the end of the studio session when the band realised that they didn’t have enough material to fill up the album. The song became their only top 10 hit on the singles charts and has become such an anthem that it was played in the gardens of Buckingham Palace during the concert to celebrate the Queen’s Golden Jubilee. The album has sold four million copies in the US alone and has been described by Time Magazine as “the birthplace of heavy metal.”\n\nThe rest, as they say, is rock and roll history. Black Sabbath has sold over 70 million albums and has influenced every heavy metal band since. Ozzy Osbourne went on to a successful solo career after being fired from the band in 1979. Among the many highlights of his post-Sabbath life are his biting the head off a dove in front of record company executives, being arrested for pissing on the Alamo and, of course, starring in MTV’s most successful ever series. Tony Iommi has remained a member of Black Sabbath ever since it was formed and still lives in a country house just outside of Birmingham where, this very moment, he is writing the group’s 19th studio album with Ozzy and Geezer. I may pop over to see them later…\n\nThe influence of Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne has now crossed far beyond the heavy metal scene. They seem to be a particular favourite for remixes by artists working in areas of electronic music such as breakbeat, drum and base, and dubstep. I have included in the playlist for this article three of my favourites: Venetian Snares’ version of Black Sabbath, a reggae remix of Sweat Leaf, and a dubstep remix of Crazy Train.\n\nYouTube playlist for this series of articles"
