        "text": "It will feature Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath's music\n\nA movie about the lives and love story of Ozzy Osbourne and his wife and manager Sharon Osbourne has officially been announced.\n\nVariety reports that the as-yet-untitled feature length film will be released by Polygram Entertainment and it will focus on Ozzy and Sharon’s relationship over the decades.\n\nMusic will feature prominently in the movie, and it will include tracks from both Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne’s hugely successful solo career.\n\nThe Oscar nominated Lee Hall (Billy Elliott, Rocketman, War Horse) is writing the script, with Sharon and her children Jack Osbourne and Aimee Osbourne producing via their label Osbourne Media. Michele Anthony and David Blackman will produce on behalf of Polygram Entertainment, with Andrea Giannetti representing Sony.\n\n“Our relationship at times was often wild, insane and dangerous but it was our undying love that kept us together,” says Sharon Osbourne. “We’re thrilled to partner with Sony Pictures and Polygram to bring our story to the screen.”\n\nHelmed by Jack Osbourne, Osbourne Media has already made a number of shows for television including God Bless Ozzy Osbourne and Biography: The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nSharon Osbourne first revealed in July 2018 that she was working on a “tearjerker” movie about her relationship with Ozzy.\n\nShe told Variety at the time: \"It starts the day we meet and will focus on how our lives were totally different but very similar in ways: I was brought up by a powerful, successful father (Black Sabbath, ELO and Small Faces manager Don Arden) and Ozzy was brought up extremely poor and somewhat abused.”\n\nSharon added: \"It's definitely going to be a tearjerker. It's not going to be a sex-and-drugs movie at all. Ozzy is so much more than that. I would hate to be a cliché.\"\n\nOzzy and Sharon Levy first met in the 1970s when Ozzy was still married to Thelma Riley. They married in 1982 and have three children together – Aimee, Kelly and Jack.\n\nOzzy Osbourne’s No More Tours 2 tour is set to hit UK arenas in February and March 2022 with special guests Judas Priest.\n\nOzzy Osbourne and Judas Priest's UK tour dates:\n\nFEBRUARY 2022\n\nNottingham Motorpoint Arena – Sun 27th\n\nMARCH 2022\n\nDublin 3Arena – Tue 1st\n\nBirmingham Resorts World Arena – Fri 4th\n\nLondon The O2 – Mon 7th\n\nManchester AO Arena – Wed 9th\n\nNewcastle Utilita Arena – Sat 12th\n\nGlasgow The SSE Hydro – Mon 14th\n\nThe childhood homes of famous rock stars, including Ozzy Osbourne:\n\nListen to Planet Rock on DAB nationwide, on our Rayo app, online or via your smart speaker (“Play Planet Rock”)."
