        "text": "As the lead singer of Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne helped establish a style of rock music which became known as heavy metal. The band's music - and later Ozzy's solo work - would be influenced by the industrial sights and sounds of north Birmingham.\n\nOsbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward grew up just a few roads apart in the Aston area. From humble beginnings, they went on to sell millions of records worldwide.\n\nOzzy stole the show when he made a surprise appearance performing at the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony on Monday night. But where did Ozzy, now 73, grow up and how did he become the Prince of Darkness?\n\nRead more: Ozzy Osborne makes surprise closing ceremony appearance - and everybody is saying the same thing\n\nOzzy was born John Michael Osbourne on December 3, 1948, to parents John and Lilian. His father worked night shifts as a toolmaker at the General Electric Company, while his mother worked days at a factory. He had three older sisters, Jean, Iris and Gillian, and two younger brothers, Paul and Tony.\n\nHis childhood home was at 14 Lodge Road, in Aston. But we revealed back in 2018, the now well-visited terraced home was actually not Ozzy's first.\n\nThe singer's birth certificate lists Ozzy's father as living at 5 Swains Grove, off Anerley Road, in Kingstanding. It's unclear whether Ozzy was born in the house or not - although his birth was registered seven days after his birth at Marston Green Maternity Hospital in Coleshill.\n\nThe singer will forever be known for his Aston roots where he and his fellow Sabbath members grew up. The working-class suburb hadn't benefited from post-war regeneration in the way Birmingham city centre had, just a couple of miles away.\n\nWhen we visited Lodge Road earlier this year - many neighbours of his childhood home did not recognise his name. \"Ozzy who?\" and \"the prince of what?\" were two comments made to our reporter.\n\n\"I'm not sure you've got the right house,\" said one person living on Lodge Road while looking perplexed. Another local resident, after me trying to explain who Ozzy is, said: \"Are you sure he's not in? Have you tried knocking?\"\n\nActually, the Crazy Train singer told GQ in 2020 that current owners of his former family home - 14 Lodge Road - are renting it out to fans for the night. He claimed: \"He charges £400! The f****** house wasn't worth £300! They must be doing an expensive extension on the bathroom.\"\n\nTaking a trip down memory lane, he revisited his family home years after moving out and says he wondered how they ever fit inside. He said: \"When you’re little everything seems massive. But that house was me, my mum and dad and my five sisters and brothers – eight of us in this house.\n\n\"It’s so tiny, I’m going, ‘How the hell did we do this?\"\n\nOzzy also spoke to GQ about his parents and about his upbringing. When asked if he was able to tell his parents that he loved them, he replied: “No, never. My parents never told me they loved me. That wasn’t a thing you did in our house. If I’d told my sister I loved her I’d have had the piss taken out of me.\"\n\nOzzy attended Prince Albert Junior and Infant School in Aston - and it was here where he gained the nickname 'Ozzy'.\n\nHis bandmates Iommi and Butler worked in factories after leaving school, Ward delivered coal and Osbourne, after stints in a slaughterhouse and car plant, turned his hand to burglary. Music was an escape for the teenagers.\n\nHe took part in school plays and upon hearing their first hit single at 14, Ozzy became a fan of the Beatles. He credits their song She Loves You for inspiring him to become a musician. He said in a 2011 documentary \"I knew I was going to be a rock star the rest of my life\".\n\nIn 1967, Butler formed his first band and soon recruited Ozzy as a vocalist. However the band broke up after performing two shows. The duo then reunited in Polka Tulk Blue, along with Iommi and Ward.\n\nThey renamed themselves Earth, but after being accidentally booked for a show instead of a different band with the same name, they changed their name again. They finally settled on the name Black Sabbath in August 1969 - and the rest is history.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
