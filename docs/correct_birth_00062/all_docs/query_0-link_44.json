        "text": "Sharon Osbourne has seemingly confirmed plans for her iconic rockstar husband Ozzy Osbourne to perform two final shows before he quits performing for good.\n\nIt come after the singer told Rolling Stone UK last year about his dream to hit the stage for a string of final performances, having battled prolonged ill health in recent years.\n\n“That’s one of the things I’ve been the most fucking pissed off at: I never got the chance to say goodbye or thank you,” he said.\n\n“If I can’t continue doing shows on a regular basis, I just want to be well enough to do one show where I can say, ‘Hi guys, thanks so much for my life.’ That’s what I’m working towards, and if I drop down dead at the end of it, I’ll die a happy man.”\n\nNow, Sharon has confirmed that two final shows in Birmingham – Ozzy’s hometown – are being planned.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday night at the London leg of her Cut The Crap tour, Sharon said: “He won’t tour again but we are planning on doing two more shows to say goodbye as he feels like ‘I have never said goodbye to my fans and I want to say goodbye properly’.”\n\nShe added: “We will do it in Aston Villa where Ozzy is from. His voice is still absolutely perfect. And all the time he has been off he still does his singing lessons so his voice is perfect. And he can joke yeah.\n\n“He has all these melodies in his head. Even if you don’t like his music you can’t not like Ozzy, he just draws you in.’\n\nIt’s fresh hope for fans of the Prince of Darkness, given that he seemingly confirmed his retirement from touring last year, after undoing a fourth bout of spinal surgery to remedy the damage inflicted by a fall in 2019 which dislodged metal rods in his back.\n\n“It’s really knocked me about,” he told Rolling Stone UK. “The second surgery went drastically wrong and virtually left me crippled. I thought I’d be up and running after the second and third, but with the last one they put a fucking rod in my spine. They found a tumour in one of the vertebrae, so they had to dig all that out too. It’s pretty rough, man, and my balance is all fucked up.”\n\nIt’s yet to be confirmed when the aforementioned performances might take place."
