        "text": "British band Black Sabbath produced an aggressive brand of rock music that defined the term heavy metal in the 1970s. The principal members were Ozzy Osbourne (John Osbourne; born December 3, 1948, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England), Terry (“Geezer”) Butler (born July 17, 1949, Birmingham), Tony Iommi (born February 19, 1948, Birmingham), and Bill Ward (born May 5, 1948, Birmingham).\n\nOsbourne, Butler, Iommi, and Ward were schoolmates in Birmingham in the late 1960s and first formed the blues bands Polka Tulk and Earth. These evolved into Black Sabbath. The group’s name came from a Butler song that was inspired by a Boris Karloff movie.\n\nBlack Sabbath cultivated a dark and foreboding image with ominous guitar riffs, slow-churn tempos, and Osbourne’s sullen vocals. The band’s lyrics, full of occult imagery, and coarse musicianship were reviled by critics and shunned by radio programmers. Constant touring, however, turned the band members into stars, and songs such as “Paranoid,” “Iron Man,” and “War Pigs” became metal classics. By the end of the 1970s they had sold millions of records and had become the standard by which virtually every heavy metal band had to measure itself."
