Heidi Klum is looking back on her marriage to ex-husband Seal.

The former supermodel, 48, revealed some unorthodox strategies employed to fix her relationship with Seal, 58.

"I think I got married eight times to Seal," Klum told the Sunday Times of her frequent marriage vow renewals to her ex. "I thought it would be kind of, like, fun. I thought it would be a fest of love. But you know, that doesn't work either. I tried, you can't say I didn't try!"

Despite her best efforts, Klum admitted she couldn't make it work.

"Like, 'This is really not working,'" she recalled. "But I tried."

The former couple tied the knot in 2005, before splitting in 2012. The exes share three children, Henry, 15, and Johan, 14, and daughter Lou, 11. The singer also adopted her eldest child Leni, 17. Leni's biological father is Flavio Briatore.

In 2019, Klum got married to Tom Kaulitz, 31.

In a previous interview with Red magazine, Klum admitted co-parenting with Seal isn't always "rosy".

"Sometimes it's hard, but then you have to all come together as a family and sometimes everything is just like hopping on clouds," she said. "It's just the way it is."
