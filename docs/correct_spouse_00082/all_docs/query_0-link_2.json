This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.\"\n\n“We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children’s sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy,\" the statement concluded.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWas infidelity a factor in Seal and Heidi Klum's divorce?\n\nHeidi, who has moved on with her third husband Tom Kaulitz, has not necessarily denied that cheating took place, but according to the mom of four, exactly what happened between her and Seal to end their marriage is none of our darn business!\n\nAs the Project Runway alum told Elle in 2012, \"People don't need to know who did what. I don't want to talk positive or negatively about the ups and downs that we had. Every couple goes through things.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, we're in the public, so the highs are out there,\" Heidi said. \"But I don't think it's necessary for — especially for our children — to have the lows being printed in magazines and talked about.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nFor his part, during an emotionally-charged period after their split, he made some eyebrow raising accusations about his ex cheating on him with her bodyguard, which she has denied, saying the relationships did not overlap.\n\n\"Whilst I didn't expect anything better from him [the bodyguard], I would of thought that Heidi would have shown a little more class and at least waited until we separated first before deciding to fornicate with the help, as it were,\" Seal shocking said.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nToday, Seal has nothing but good things to say about his family.\n\nYears after his divorce from Heidi, Seal has seemingly moved on to focus on the best thing to come out of his relationship with the model: Their kids.\n\nIn February 2024, the \"Kiss From a Rose\" singer gushed on Instagram about his son Johan, \"He’s the light of my life and one of the four best things I was ever fortunate to be a part of, (the other three being his siblings).\"\n\nIn 2023, the proud papa shared a photo of himself with his oldest daughter Leni, including equally sweet sentiments about the aspiring model. \"In New York with the young woman who changed my life for the better 19 years ago,\" Seal captioned the shot. \"Thank you Leni for making me a better person.\""
