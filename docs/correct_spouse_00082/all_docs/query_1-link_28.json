According to Klum, she was sitting in the lobby of a New York City hotel when Seal walked by in his exercise ensemble. \"I was, like, wow ... And I pretty much saw everything. The whole package,\" Klum said on the \"Oprah Winfrey Show,\" via People. While it may have been his figure that initially interested her, she quickly realized there was also a deeper connection. \"I was physically, straightaway attracted to him, and then we got talking, and I was like, 'Wow, he's such a warm and charming man,\" she added in the Oprah interview.\n\nAs for Seal, he too felt an instant spark. \"What first attracted me to her was the kindness in her smile that prompted me to feel that I hadn't seen anyone more beautiful,\" Seal said of their meeting, per People. Definitely sounds like a genuine love at first sight story, even if it didn't end up being a tale of everlasting love.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmpjZYR5e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2dsqqwyGaipa2dYq6vsIysnJqko2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7"
