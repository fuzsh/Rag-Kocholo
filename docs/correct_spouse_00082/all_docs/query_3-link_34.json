        "text": "Photographers who captured photos of Heidi Klum enjoying a getaway in Italy noticed her husband getting handsy as the couple walked around the city together.\n\nPhotos obtained by People and published on Saturday, July 6, showed Klum, 51, striding around Venice with Tom Kaulitz, her husband of five years. The two were chatting and laughing together as they navigated the city on foot, with the Tokio Hotel guitarist wearing a white and black patterned top and matching pants as Klum wore a black bikini top and black cover-up.\n\nWhile the America’s Got Talent judge had a small purse slung over one shoulder, Kaulitz, 34, was holding what appeared to be shopping bags in his left hand. Meanwhile, his right hand was busy touching his wife’s rear end as they walked side by side.\n\nSee the photos here.\n\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\nRelated: Heidi Klum's Husband Strips Down to Match His Model Wife as She Flaunts Little Leopard Bikini in New Video\n\nIn addition to the snapshots photographers on the street have taken of the happy couple, the Project Runway alum has shared inside looks at their vacation with fans on social media. In one video Klum shared on Instagram on Thursday, July 4, the supermodel sat next to Kaulitz inside a gondola as they took a ride through the Venice canals. Klum looked directly into the camera as she leaned against her husband, enjoying the romantic ride around the city.\n\nAdditional photos that Klum shared in a separate post on Thursday displayed some of the views the couple took in while exploring Venice, as well as some of their standout meals.\n\nBefore traveling to Venice, Klum and Kaulitz spent some time enjoying Paris. The two posed near the base of the Eiffel Tower in an image that Klum shared on Instagram earlier this week. And one video that she shared in late June showed the couple attending a Pride parade on one of their days vacationing in the City of Love."
