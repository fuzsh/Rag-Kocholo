        "text": "Over the weekend of August 3, Heidi Klum married Tokio Hotel's Tom Kaulitz for the second time.\n\nAmid their social media celebrations, observations were made that Kaulitz may look like Jason Momoa.\n\nApparently, there's another Jason Momoa lookalike in-town, and it's Heidi Klum's husband, Tokio Hotel's Tom Kaulitz.\n\nWe've already established that the Aquaman star's son, 10 year-old Nakoa Wolf, is basically his mini me. Oh, and then there's Big Brother 21's (problematic) Jack Matthews who we'll grudgingly admit shares a small resemblance. But now, some are looking twice at Tom Kaulitz, a guitarist for the German rock band Tokio Hotel, who Klum married for the second time this past weekend. (The two had their first ceremony in February).\n\nSo what do the Momoa fans at OprahMag.com think? Honestly, we see why some would make the comparison. For example, take the above photo of Klum and Kaulitz. The 46-year-old model shared the snap with her Instagram followers with the caption, \"Danke Bill für das schöne Foto,\" in German, which translates to \"Thanks Bill for the nice photo.\" You see the musician gazing at his new wife, and his side profile is giving off major Momoa vibes. It's all in the beard and tousled, shoulder-length beach waves.\n\nWe see it here, too in this breathtaking photo of Klum and Kaulitz, 29, at their August wedding ceremony aboard a luxury yacht.\n\nBut when you look at the rocker's actual face, we're not as convinced. And just in case you need a peek at Momoa to make an educated decision yourself, here you go.\n\nHowever, we are confident in saying that Kaulitz really looks like his identical twin brother, and bandmate, Bill Kaulitz because...genetics.\n\nLet's get real. Everyone can't look like Jason Momoa, but that won't stop us from attempting to find his next real-life doppelgänger. Until next time!"
