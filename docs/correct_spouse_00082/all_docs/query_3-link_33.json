        "text": "The love birds, who have a 16-year age difference, sparked a romance back in February of 2018. Less than a year together, Kaulitz popped the question.\n\nThe \"Making the Cut\" hostess told \"ET\" in February that they had already set a date for the ceremony. She then coyly added, \"But you will find out eventually.\"\n\nHere are seven things you should know about the man who stole Klum's heart.\n\n1. Kaulitz was one of the founding members of German rock band, Tokio Hotel. He's a guitarist, singer-songwriter and keyboardist.\n\nThe group successfully transitioned from Europe to the US with their first English-language album, \"Scream.\" It peaked at No. 5 on Billboard's alternative albums chart in 2008.\n\nThey even won best new artist, beating Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus, at 2008's MTV VMAs.\n\nSince then, they've worked on several other projects. Their 2009 album, \"Humanoid,\" peaked at No. 11 on Billboard's alternative albums chart, and they released their sixth studio album, \"Dream Machine,\" in 2017.\n\n2. He's a twin.\n\nBill Kaulitz, the lead singer of Tokio Hotel, is actually his twin. Tom was born 10 minutes before Bill.\n\nIn an interview in 2007, Tom said that his brother is more like his soul mate.\n\n\"We are very different yet alike,\" he said. \"We don't look like twins. But we are soul mates. When I look at Bill, I know instantly what he thinks. I can feel it when he has a problem, even if he is not with me. I cannot imagine that I could ever trust a girl like I trust Bill.\"\n\n3. He moved to Los Angeles with his brother in 2010.\n\nThe two left their hometown of Hamburg, Germany to work on music together in LA. A German tabloid, Bild, suspected they moved after a break-in at their home and stalking by fans.\n\n4. Kaulitz is trilingual.\n\nHe speaks German, English and French.\n\n5. The 29-year-old was married once before to Ria Sommerfeld, a former German beauty queen.\n\nThe two split in 2016 after being married for a little over a year. At the time, they said the break-up was \"mutual and amicable.\"\n\nKaulitz finalized the divorce just a few months before he proposed to Klum, according to documents obtained by The Blast.\n\n6. Kaulitz met Klum through \"Germany's Next Top Model\" in 2018.\n\nThe pair were introduced by a mutual friend on the show, according to US Weekly. Their relationship became official soon after.\n\nThey were spotted holding hands and kissing several times, including once on the set of \"America's Got Talent\" in Pasadena, California in March, according to US Weekly.\n\nAt 2018's amfAR Gala in Cannes, the love birds made their red carpet debut. The two were all-smiles as they posed together, the supermodel wearing a shimmery silver gown and Kaulitz wearing an all-black suit.\n\n7. He asked Klum's kids to help with a simple and sweet proposal in 2018.\n\nI SAID YES ❤️\n\nA post shared by Heidi Klum (@heidiklum) on Dec 24, 2018 at 11:01am PSTDec 24, 2018 at 11:01am PST\n\nAccording to People magazine, a friend of the couple said that when Kaulitz asked Klum's four children — daughters Lou, 9, and Leni, 14, and sons Johan, 12, and Henry, 13 — for their blessing, they gladly gave it to him.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the kids helped Kaulitz put together a breakfast-in-bed proposal for their supermodel mom.\n\nShe then took to Instagram and shared an adorable black and white photo of the couple showing off her ring. She accompanied it with an all-caps caption \"I SAID YES.\""
