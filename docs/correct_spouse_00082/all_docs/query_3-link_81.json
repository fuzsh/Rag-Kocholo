Klum said she had been sick all week and Kaulitz, who recently returned from a tour, also fell ill.\n\n\"To be safe, we are staying apart until we get the results of our Coronavirus tests (that we were finally able to get today) back. We donâ€™t want to spread germs and risk others getting sicker... even each other!\" she wrote.\n\nTokio Hotel performed shows in Los Angeles, Mexico and Equador this month. Klum urged her followers to be safe and heed all warnings about the virus.\n\n\"We are all in this together and it is up to us to protect our loved ones, and our neighbors and our communities. Please listen to the officials and stay at home if you can and physically distance yourself from other people,\" she said."
