        "text": "British singer Seal and supermodel Heidi Klum were one of the most visibly in love celebrity couples of the '00s. However, the pair split for good in 2012, after seven years of marriage. Just like any relationship, theirs had its ups and downs. And because they're both public figures, they had some unique challenges as well. Apparently, the reality didn't always match up with the perfect picture their fans saw. In fact, Seal has opened up about one high-profile tradition that he and Klum kept throughout their marriage and revealed why he actually never enjoyed it at all. Read on to find out what he said and to hear more about these famous exes.\n\nRELATED: The 20 Messiest Celebrity Divorces of All Time, Ranked.\n\nSeal didn't like the couple's annual vow renewal ceremony.\n\nDuring a 2015 interview on Andy Cohen's SiriusXM show, the host asked Seal why he and Klum would have an elaborate ceremony to renew their marriage vows every year. The singer said that it was his \"ex-wife's idea.\" And he made it clear that he was not a fan of the huge parties, each of which had guests and a theme. In 2010, for example, People reported that the couple went to Mexico for their fifth anniversary, where the celebration took place at sunset on a beach in Costa Careyes.\n\n\"It kind of turned into a little bit of a circus, which I wasn't terribly fond of,\" Seal explained to Cohen. \"Because I'm, you know, by default, I'm quite a private person.\"\n\nRELATED: Jennifer Aniston Says This Is Her Biggest Regret About Brad Pitt.\n\nSeal didn't see the point of the big parties.\n\n\"The renewing of the vows, it was cool. I don't know how necessary it was,\" Seal said on Radio Andy. Cohen noted that they seemed like \"a big public thing every year,\" which is what Seal said that he \"disliked most\" about the tradition.\n\nThe singer explained that he went along with the plans for Klum's sake and to do his part in the relationship. \"You're married and you become a team player,\" he said. \"And you understand that each of you have different lives. And you do whatever you can to support your partner's life.\"\n\nSeal also said that their marriage was \"all about committing\" to each other and supporting their four kids, Leni Klum, Lou Samuel, Henry Samuel, and Jonah Samuel. \"You do things for the greater good,\" he added. \"And the greater good in our case was always the family. So, whatever the family needed, or felt that they needed, you did too.\"\n\nAnd for more entertainment and celebrity news sent to you directly, sign up for our daily newsletter.\n\nThe vow renewals were a major family event.\n\nWhile Klum didn't respond to Seal's 2015 comments about the ceremonies, she did open up about why they were important to her back when they were still married. \"It's our time – a lovely family time,\" she explained to Redbook (via People).\"It's about remembering this moment of love we gave to each other and reinforcing it.\"ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\n\nShe also explained that they did it annually with their children in mind. \"It's so special to us, something we love and something our children have gotten accustomed to,\" the model added. \"It's like, 'Hey, Mom and Dad love each other and they get married every year!\"\n\nTheir split and the aftermath made headlines.\n\nIn January 2012, Seal and Klum released a joint statement announcing their breakup. They said that although they \"continue to love\" and have the \"deepest respect\" for each other, they grew apart. \"This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition,\" the statement reads.\n\nHowever, 10 months later, some sharper words started flying. As People reported, Seal was asked by a TMZ cameraman how he felt about news that Klum was dating her bodyguard. He said that he thought Klum would have \"shown a little more class\" and \"waited until [they] were separated\" to \"fornicate with the help.\" Through a representative, Klum said that it was \"sad that Seal had to resort to false accusations.\" Seal's representative released another statement, saying that the star had not been \"implying his wife was cheating on him while they were together,\" but pointing out that they were still legally married. The pair's divorce was finalized two years after they initially split.\n\nKlum said her family life didn't change much after her divorce.\n\nWhile speaking to Redbook in November 2015, Klum said that her family life hadn't \"changed drastically\" since her breakup with Seal. More specifically, she noted that her responsibilities as a mother had stayed the same.\n\n\"[Seal] was never your typical dad who left for work in the morning with his briefcase and would be home by dinnertime every night,\" Klum said. \"He traveled a lot. The kids knew it was part of his job. I'm a mom and a dad at the same time.\""
