        "text": "Seal is notoriously private when it comes to talking about his personal life, but he recently gave an insight into his relationship today with ex-wife Heidi Klum.\n\nThe Kiss from a Rose hitmaker was full of positivity towards the model in terms of how they are bringing up their children.\n\nSeal made a brief reference to Heidi as he praised oldest daughter Leni, 18, and her personality.\n\nHe told E! News: \"She walks through life with this type of humility that allows her to move so gracefully through it all and she has an innate understanding of people in general and people's feelings. So I'm kind of more impressed with everything that she is.\"\n\nOn him and Heidi's parenting skills, he added: \"I'd like to think, as a parent, that we have—between her mother and myself—that we've instilled some of that in her. But she can do no wrong in my eyes and she's quite wonderful.\"\n\nMORE: Seal moved to tears by unexpected surprise from home\n\nLATEST: Heidi Klum looks bare-faced and fabulous donning gold swimsuit in latest photo\n\nSeal and Heidi split in 2012 and their divorce was finalized in 2014. The hitmaker had previously spoken about co-parenting with the German model in a less positive light.\n\nHe told US Weekly: \"It can be challenging. It requires teamwork. If you are a team, if both parents are a team, then it's really easy and that's not a real challenge at all… But you have to be a team. And if you're not a team, then it can all fall to pieces.\"\n\nMORE: Heidi Klum's son looks identical to famous dad Seal in new photo\n\nMORE: Heidi Klum displays baby bump in stunning embellished underwear\n\nThe former couple are also parents to sons Henry, 17, Johan, 16, and daughter Lou, 13. Seal - who adopted Leni when she was a baby - has a close bond with all his children. He met Heidi when she was just two weeks pregnant with Leni, whose biological father is Italian businessman Flavio Briatore.\n\nDuring a red carpet appearance with Leni in 2021 for the premiere of The Harder They Fall, Seal had the sweetest words to say about his daughter. He told Entertainment Tonight of their close bond: \"It's always been like this, from the day I met your mother. She [Heidi] was two weeks pregnant with this beautiful woman. We have always had this bond.\"\n\nLeni is balancing modeling while studying at New York University - the college attended by many celebrity offspring, including Kate Hudson's son Ryder Robinson. Ahead of Leni's big move away from home, Heidi opened up about the change and admitted that while she is thrilled about the 18-year-old's exciting new adventure, her \"heart will be sad\" without her daughter at home.\n\nMORE: Heidi Klum and Seal's daughter Leni's new home revealed\n\n\"I am [so proud],\" Heidi told ET Online. \"You know, she has her head screwed on right. Right now, college is on top of the list. It's not modeling and she's really excited for that next chapter in her life.\"\n\nRead more HELLO! US stories here"
