        "text": "That's dedication for you! Heidi Klum's devoted husband, Tom Kaulitz, proved to be the perfect parent this week.\n\nIn a video shared by the German supermodel which can be viewed below, the Tokio Hotel star was ever the doting dad as Heidi filmed him at their LA home.\n\nWhile they don't have any children together, Tom is a stepfather to his wife's four children, Lou, 14, Johan, 16, Henry, 18, and Leni, 19, who she shares with Seal.\n\nBut the teens weren't the ones in need of assistance in the clip posted to Instagram. Instead, Tom was tending to their puppies, Uschi and JÃ¤ger.\n\nStorms have replaced the usual sunshine in Los Angeles and their German shorthaired pointers weren't sure how to deal with the rain.\n\nHaving likely never seen it before, they were reluctant to leave the house to go to the toilet.\n\nBut Tom took it all in his stride and encouraged them outside and then adorably stood with an umbrella over them as they did their business.\n\n\"LA doggies,\" Heidi wrote in the caption alongside raindrop and dog emojis. \"Tom is the best dog daddy.\"\n\nThe couple become proud doggie parents once more when they welcome the puppies back in September 2023.\n\nAt the time, the America's Got Talent judge confessed she was nervous about adding more pooches to their brood, but she needn't have been concerned.\n\nAlongside a photo of Tom cuddling the hounds, she wrote: \"When he tells you he is not ready for a new puppy and you surprise him with two on his birthday,\" and added a pair of heart emojis.\n\nThe decision was hard as the pair had gone through hardship earlier in the year with the death of two of their dogs.\n\nIn February, the couple's 15-year-old German shorthaired pointer Capper died, while their four-year-old Irish wolfhound Anton died a month later.\n\nHouse training for the new duo wasn't easy - and it looks like it continues to be a struggle - as she revealed during an appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show last month.\n\n\"It's hard,\" she admitted. \"They're now seven months, they pooped all over the house, peed all over the house.\n\n\"I got the gates back up. You know, the kids are now old, but when they were young I remember we had gates everywhere so that they couldn't go up the stairs, down the stairs.\"\n\nShe brought them back out for her pets, \"so that the dogs can, if they poo in the house, only poo in a certain part of the house and not everywhere.\""
