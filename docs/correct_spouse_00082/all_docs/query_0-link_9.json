        "text": "Heidi Klum may be happily married for the third time but it's not made her relationship with her ex-husband, Seal, any easier.\n\nDespite what was described as an amicable divorce between the America's Got Talent host and the British singer in 2014, they've both made it quite clear that things are no longer rosy.\n\nMORE: Heidi Klum and Seal's daughter Leni looks so different after major hair transformation\n\nRight from the start, Heidi and Seal's romance was unique. After their first date she revealed to him that she was pregnant with her ex-boyfriend, Flavio Briatore's baby.\n\nWATCH: Heidi Klum pulls off impressive ABBA dance routine with daughters\n\nSeal told the Mirror: \"I laughed and said, 'Already? That's amazing!' She said, ‘Not with you stupid'.\"\n\nNevertheless, Seal wasn't ready to give up on Heidi and became her firstborn's father before marrying the German model in 2005.\n\nMORE: Heidi Klum's oldest son is so grown up as he prepares for bittersweet milestone\n\nREAD: Heidi Klum's vast garden at $9.8million mansion is total paradise\n\nThey went on to have three more children together, and renew their vows several times before their marriage came to and end seven years after they said, 'I Do'.\n\nHeidi and Seal have four children\n\nRumors swirled as to the reason behind the demise of their relationship, but their statement at the time said that they had simple \"grown apart\".\n\nIt read : \"While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate. We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart.\n\nMORE: Heidi Klum's daughter Leni enjoys day out with dad Seal after heartbreaking family change\n\nMORE: Heidi Klum admits she's struggling to deal with daughter Leni leaving home for college\n\n\"This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition. We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children’s sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.\"\n\nSeal adopted Heidi's firstborn, Leni, when she was a baby\n\nBut while Heidi has gone on to find love once again with Tokio Hotel rocker, Tom Kaulitz, Seal remains single and the former couple's relationship strained.\n\nSeal hinted at problems when he opened up to US Weekly and revealed details of their co-parenting: \"It can be challenging. It requires teamwork. If you are a team, if both parents are a team, then it is really easy and that's not a real challenge at all.\"\n\nMORE: Heidi Klum wows in stunning bikini photo on the beach\n\nREAD: How Heidi Klum's ex-husband Seal goes out of his way to protect their children\n\nHe continued: \"But you have to be a team. And if you're not a team, then it can all fall to pieces.\" Seal then shocked when he admitted: \"I never had that teamwork [with Heidi]. We never had teamwork.\"\n\nHeidi is married to Tom Kaulitz\n\nConsidering their beginning, it is a shame that their bond appears to be broken. Heidi reiterated Seal's comments when she spoke to the Express and said co-parenting with \"someone you're not with anymore\" isn't \"all rosy\".\n\nShe also confessed that her relationship with Seal was \"sometimes hard,\" but that all they could do was \"try\".\n\nAlthough they both admit they struggle to get along, their relationship with their children is the most important thing to them. Seal was recently reunited with his oldest child when they attended the US Open together and through the snippets, Heidi posts on social media of her family, they appear to be thriving."
