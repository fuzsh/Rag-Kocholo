I don't know any stats, but it seems that when both of the spouses are celebrities (this is important) then they have more than a 50% chance of divorce. Maybe it's just a false perception that the media puts out there, I don't know. It's just so hard to name many hollywood couples that haven't split. I do admit that 7 years is at least a lot longer than many other marriages. I think what gets me is how they just renewed vows a year ago, and Klum gushed about him in her last interview with Piers Morgan in October. <strong>But after some \"deep soul searching\" (how deep is this soul?) they've decided to call it quits.\n\n</strong>Posted by monkeysip[/QUOTE]\n\nYou do realize quotes like that are just for PR purposes right?

I don't know these people, and you guys are right, maybe they've felt this way for a long time. Heck, maybe their vow renewal was an attempt to reignite a dying flame. Like I said before, maybe it's just a false perception people (like me) get from the media. Either way, it seems that these celebrities aren't being genuine (big surprise!). <strong>Maybe her gushing was all a front, but why is that okay?</strong> I'll also add that it's not really just celebrities, and I think many people who divorce rush into it. But celebrities are in the public eye, so they get more flack for it. There's no set amount of time that qualifies as \"deep\" soul searching vs. \"shallow\" soul searching, but that's why I find the term funny. I didn't use the term \"deep soul searching\"--they did.\n\nPosted by monkeysip[/QUOTE]\n\nBecause their relationship (and their problems) are their business and no one else's.

Hey, if she's unhappy and doesn't want to tell people, that's fine. But why do people like that feel the need to go on and on about their great marriages, then? I just find it strange. Not saying she's a bad person--I just don't get why they do that.</div>\n\nSaveSave\n\n0 Reply\n\nAnd my point is, if you are having problems, you generally don't talk about it. But how odd would it be if you're doing an interview and the guy asks you about your marriage/husband and you say something along the lines of \"no comment\" or \"I'd rather not discuss that\". It would send up huge red flags that something is wrong so she gushed about him to keep away the rumor mill which would be awful to deal with if you're going through marital problems.\n\nI seriously could not imagine going through marriage problems in the public eye. When everything you say (or don't say!) is dissected and misinterpreted (kind of like what you feel happened to you in this thread.) Now imagine that x5,783,028 and that's why she tried to make it seem like nothing was wrong.\n\nOr maybe nothing was wrong back in October and they did jump on the divorce train pretty fast. Either way, we don't know.\n\n0 Reply"
