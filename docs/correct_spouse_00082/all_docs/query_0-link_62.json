        "text": "http://omg.yahoo.com/news/is-heidi-klum-dating-her-bodyguard-.html\n\nSo much for that amicable split. After it was reported on Friday that Heidi Klum was dating her bodyguard of four years, Martin Kristen, her soon-to-be ex-husband Seal had a very bitter response for the mother of his four children. \"To be quite honest, if there is going to be somebody else in their lives, I'd much rather it was a familiar face,” the “Kiss From a Rose” singer told TMZ as he made his way through an airport on Saturday. “I guess the only thing I would have preferred is that … I guess I didn't expect any better from him, I would have preferred Heidi show a little bit more class and at least wait until we separated first before deciding to fornicate with the help, as it were,” he adds, insinuating that the relationship began before he and Klum announced their split in January. “But I guess you now all have the answer that you've been looking for the past seven months.\"\n\nAccording to reports, the “Project Runway” host has been dating Kristen, who she was spotted getting cozy with during a family day at the beach in Sardinia, Italy, this week with her parents and four children just feet away. In onephoto, Klum and Kristen are seated side by side on a rock and it looks like she is taking a pic of them on her phone, while in another, he has his arm around her as she smiles. “It's complicated,\" a friend of Klum tells People. \"Their relationship is hard to define.\"\n\nThe former Victoria’s Secret Angel has been growing closer to Kristen ever since she separated from Seal in January. Despite Seal's new cheating claims, Klum, 39, has said the breakup came as a surprise to her and she has reportedly been seeking comfort with her long-time pal during the “difficult time,” adds the People source. \"Her inner circle of people she trusts is getting smaller and smaller and he is her No. 1 confidante.\"\n\nKlum is going to need all the support she can get from Kristen. Radar Online reports that the divorce between her and Seal is starting to get a little nasty -- and that's apparent judging from his outburst on Friday. In addition to fighting over money – the $70 million model insists she and her less-successful ex had no joint assets, which he denies – they’re also going back and forth over their four children: Leni, 8, Henry, 6, Johan, 5, and Lou, 2. She wants primary physical custody, but Seal believes they should share it 50-50.\n\nSeal's Rep: \"He Didn't Imply Heidi Cheated\"\n\nSeptember 2012\n\nWell, that was fast:\n\nAfter remarks Seal made during an airport interview regarding his estranged wife Heidi Klum and her bodyguard Martin Kirsten were picked up far and wide this weekend, a rep for the British singer issued a statement.\n\n\"Seal would like to clarify that he was not implying his wife was cheating on him while they were together,\" said the statement. \"But rather he was pointing out that they are separated and the divorce is not final so they are legally still married.\"\n\nIn the course of a Los Angeles International Airport interview, Seal, 49, told TMZ, in reference to recent photos of Klum and Kirsten vacationing in Sardinia: \"That's what happens when two people separate, they move on and generally meet other people in their lives.\"\n\nHe also said: \"Whilst I didn't expect anything better from him [the bodyguard], I would of thought that Heidi would have shown a little more class and at least waited until we separated first before deciding to fornicate with the help, as it were.\"\n\nhttp://www.people.com/peo...65,00.html\n\nIdentity said:\n\nSeal's Rep: \"He Didn't Imply Heidi Cheated\"\n\nSeptember 2012\n\nWell, that was fast:\n\nAfter remarks Seal made during an airport interview regarding his estranged wife Heidi Klum and her bodyguard Martin Kirsten were picked up far and wide this weekend, a rep for the British singer issued a statement.\n\n\"Seal would like to clarify that he was not implying his wife was cheating on him while they were together,\" said the statement. \"But rather he was pointing out that they are separated and the divorce is not final so they are legally still married.\"\n\nIn the course of a Los Angeles International Airport interview, Seal, 49, told TMZ, in reference to recent photos of Klum and Kirsten vacationing in Sardinia: \"That's what happens when two people separate, they move on and generally meet other people in their lives.\"\n\nHe also said: \"Whilst I didn't expect anything better from him [the bodyguard], I would of thought that Heidi would have shown a little more class and at least waited until we separated first before deciding to fornicate with the help, as it were.\"\n\nhttp://www.people.com/peo...65,00.html\n\nWhen I first read his comments, I didn't think he was implying that she was cheating on him while they were married...I got that he was talking about while they are separated. And I agree. I don't know why its so hard for folks to understand that even if you are separated and heading to a divorce OR actually in the divorce proceedings, legally you are still married. So yes if you choose to date others during this time period before the actual divorce, you are technically committing adultry.\n\nThe thing is, if he's doing the same thing, then it's hypocritical for him to even bring any of this up. So Maybe silence is the best option for him at this point.\n\nHeidi Klum: ''I've Moved On from Seal''\n\nSeptember 3, 2012\n\nIt's Heidi Klum's turn in the recent exchange of words between her and ex husband, Seal.\n\n\"I cherish all of the great memories Seal and I created together over the years,\" Klum says in an exclusive statement to People Mag.\n\n\"Our separation was based on issues between the two of us,\" she continues. \"Seal has moved on and so have I. My priority has and continues to be protecting and providing for our children.\"\n\nKlum's statement comes in the wake of a comment by Seal – which he later clarified – concerning his estranged wife's relationship with her bodyguard, with whom she was seen getting cozy in Sardinia.\n\nSeal, 49, first said he wished Klum, 39, had \"waited until we separated first before deciding to \"fornicate with the help\",\" but later clarified that he wasn't implying Klum cheated on himbefore their January separation.\n\nThe whole saga was an unexpected drama after what both Seal and Klum said in January was an \"amicable\" separation.\n\n\"We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much,\" they told PEOPLE at the time. \"Protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority.\"\n\nLink"
