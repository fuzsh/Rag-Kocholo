        "text": "Heidi Klum has revealed she tied the knot with ex-husband Seal \"eight times\" in the hope of keeping their seven-year marriage \"fun.\"\n\nThe legendary supermodel opened up about her past relationship with the British musician in a recent interview, admitting she tried to salvage it by repeatedly re-doing their wedding vows.\n\n“I think I got married eight times to Seal,” she told the Sunday Times. “I thought it would be kind of, like, fun. I thought it would be a fest of love.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the romantic ritual wasn't enough to save the marriage. Heidi, who married Seal one year after meeting him at a New York hotel in 2004, filed for divorce from the singer in 2012. The couple officially split in 2014 but are still in contact to co-parent their three children.\n\nRead more from woman&home:\n\n• Best mascaras to lengthen, define, and volumize your lashes\n\n• Best jeans for curvy women that are seriously flattering\n\n• Best bras to support, lift and shape your bust\n\nHeidi revealed she finally accepted the marriage was in its final stages after the eighth renewal of the vows. The America's Got Talent judge recalled thinking, \"This is really not working\" when it became clear that the relationship—even with the bells and whistles of multiple wedding ceremonies—was soon to be over.\n\n\"I tried; you can’t say I didn’t try!\" she said.\n\nWhy did Heidi Klum and Seal divorce?\n\nThey may have looked like the perfect couple from the outside, but behind closed doors, Heidi and Seal were struggling to keep the spark alive. They released a joint statement to E! News to confirm their split in 2012, explaining that they had decided to separate \"after much soul searching\".\n\n\"We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart,\" they wrote.\n\nThe sad news stunned fans, who had grown accustomed to seeing the powerhouse couple regularly fawning over each other at public events. Heidi had never been shy about her love for Seal, whom she first laid eyes on when he was emerging from a hotel gym in 2004. The chance encounter marked the beginning of a passionate relationship, which led to a surprise engagement in a mountaintop igloo in December 2004.\n\nHeidi shared the magical memory with Piers Morgan in 2011, recalling, \"We hop off and the helicopter leaves, and there we are in the middle of nowhere. It was beautiful. And then he had his guitar with him. And he sang a song for me and he went down on his knee.\" They got married in a private ceremony attended by just 40 guests in Mexico the following May.\n\nWhen the TV host asked her about how she and Seal maintain a strong relationship, she replied, \"I just think because we love each other. We have fun with each other. We respect each other. I let him do his thing, even though that's hard for me sometimes.\"\n\nHeidi even called her wedding band her favorite accessory at one point, revealing she refuses to remove it when she's on the job. \"Even when I'm working I don't take it off,\" she said.\n\nHow many children do Heidi Klum and Seal have?\n\nHeidi and Seal share three children from their seven-year marriage. Their oldest, Henry, was born in September 2005. They welcomed their second son, Jonah, the following year, before adding a third child, Lou—their first daughter—to the family in 2009.\n\nHeidi also has another daughter, Leni, from a previous relationship. The 17-year-old has followed in her mother's footsteps and pursued her own modeling career, gracing the January 2021 issue of Vogue Germany. She had wanted to be a model since the age of 12 but had been refused permission by Heidi until she was older.\n\n\"Sixteen is a good age,” Heidi told the magazine. “If you are allowed to drive a car, you can also have an official Instagram account and show your face. And to be allowed to start with a Vogue cover is an insane privilege.”"
