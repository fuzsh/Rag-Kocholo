        "text": "Seal is staying surprisingly optimistic about his recent split from wife Heidi Klum, and we're not just referring to the wedding ring he continues to wear.\n\nIn an interview on Piers Morgan Tonight, the singer said he still thinks there is a chance he and Klum may get back together. \"It may happen, I can't speak for her,\" Seal, 48, said Tuesday. \"Is it irreparable? You can never say never. The thing I love most about us is that we are a team ... that won't change, whether we get back together or not.\"\n\nHeidi Klum and Seal divorcing\n\nHowever, he did say he didn't know if he wanted to work things out right now. \"If it were that easy — if there weren't problems, we'd still be together. That is the reality.\"\n\nSeal and Klum, 38, announced Sunday they were separating after eight years of marriage. The couple, who famously renewed their vows every year, have three children together: Henry, 6, Johan, 5, and Lou, 2. (Klum's oldest daughter, 7-year-old Leni, is from a previous relationship).\"My love for her has not waned one iota,\" he said. \"I love her with all my heart. How can you not love somebody [who] you've spent eight years with?\"\n\nSeal: I have no intentions of taking off my wedding ring soon\n\nDespite their estrangement, Seal has continued to wear his wedding ring in interviews and other appearances, something he insists is not for show.\"I'm still wearing my wedding ring because I'm still married to this incredible woman,\" he said. \"What this means to me and what it stands for [is] respect, it stands for loyalty, it stands for incredible memories, and it stands for these four little miracles — and Heidi, making five — that have come into my life.\"\n\nWatch Seal's interview here:"
