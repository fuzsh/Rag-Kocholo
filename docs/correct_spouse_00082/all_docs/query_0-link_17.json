        "text": "SEAL is a British singer and songwriter, best known for his song Kiss From A Rose, who has sold more than 20 million records worldwide.\n\nHe previously hit the headlines after reportedly being investigated for sexual battery after an actress claimed he forced himself on her in 2016. He has denied the accusations.\n\nWho is Seal and what are his most famous songs?\n\nSeal is an English singer and songwriter born in London on February 19, 1963.\n\nThe Brit Award winner rose to fame with his eponymous debut album in 1991 and has since carved out a long and successful career as a singer and TV judge.\n\nSeal's biggest hits include Kiss From A Rose, Killer and Future Love Paradise.\n\nWhat's the cause of Seal's facial scars?\n\nSeal has prominent scarring to his face which has led to years of insensitive speculation on the cause behind the scars.\n\nThe singer's complexion is down to discoid lupus erythematosus - a condition where the immune cells attack body tissues and intense inflammation develop in the skin.\n\nAlthough Seal's condition, which he contracted aged 23, has been in remission for many years, the scars are permanent.\n\nWhat TV shows has Seal appeared on?\n\nSeal appeared as a guest judge on Pitch Battle.\n\nBefore that, he was a judge on the first two seasons of The Voice Australia between 2012 and 2013.\n\nHe then returned in 2017 for the sixth season where he was joined by Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland and Boy George.\n\nSeal also appeared alongside his ex-wife Heidi Klum when he returned as a guest judge on the 2017 series of America's Got Talent.\n\nWhen was Seal in a relationship with Heidi Klum?\n\nSeal started dating American-German model Heidi Klum in 2004 and the couple got married the following year.\n\nThe former couple had three children together and Seal also adopted Heidi's first child from a previous relationship.\n\nSeal announced his split from Heidi in 2012 after nearly seven years of marriage."
