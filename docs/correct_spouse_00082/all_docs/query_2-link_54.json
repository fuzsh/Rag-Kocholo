        "text": "Seal And Heidi Klum\n\n'I have truly found my soul mate, and have formed a bond that will last forever.'\n\nLondon-born singer Seal and model Heidi Klum were pals for a while before finally making a romantic connection in February 2004, shortly after Heidi had split from Italian race car impresario Flavio Briatore.\n\nThe German supermodel was already pregnant with Briatore's child when she started dating her husband-to-be and has frequently said that Seal, who was by her side when her daughter was born, has always treated Leni as if she was his own little girl.\n\nSeal proposed to Heidi on December 23rd at 14,000 feet in Whistler, B.C., on a glacier, in a natural snow cave, in an igloo built just for the moment. Seal reportedly presented Heidi with a large canary diamond engagement ring which has been referred to by one witness as 'a serious rock.'\n\nHeidi and Seal were married May 10, 2005, on a beach in Mexico and in September 2005 their first son Henry Günther Ademola Dashtu Samuel was born. A little over a year later a second son Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel joined the family.\n\nThey were called ‘the Patchwork Family’ by a German newspaper. Heidi said, ‘I was, like, Hmm, is this an insult or is this positive? I talked to Seal about it, and we’re, like, it’s actually kind of great—we’re all different shades and we came together and we all love each other. They may call it black and white, but I’m not white, I’m a shade of brown and so is our daughter, Leni. She’s the lightest, then it’s me, then it’s our son, and then it’s Seal. So I think, Hey, it’s actually kind of nice to have a 'patchwork family.'\n\nSeal, was recently nominated for a golden globe for the song A Father's Way, which featured in the film The Pursuit of Happyness. He says he wrote the song for their children to help them understand what it means to be a parent.\n\nSeal says Heidi is still romantic, 'When I'm travelling she hides pictures of her and the kids [in my suitcase] so I can discover them later on. Heidi is the female version of Seal. I have truly found my soul mate, and have formed a bond that will last forever. We will continue to grow as a couple, as well as a family, both are equally important to nurture.’\n\nHeidi says: 'We're always going to be newlyweds. I really hope so. Things are good.'\n\nOther celebrity couples:\n\nDavid Bowie and Iman\n\nBruce Forsyth and Wilnelia Merced\n\nMichael and Shakira Caine\n\nLenny Henry and Dawn French\n\nVisit Heidi Klum's website:"
