        "text": "(AP) LOS ANGELES - Court records show Heidi Klum has filed for divorce from singer Seal in Los Angeles.\n\nThe supermodel's petition cites irreconcilable differences for ending the couple's six and a half year marriage.\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer's real name is Henry Samuel.\n\nThe former couple has four children together, including Klum's daughter from a previous relationship. The children range in ages from 2 to 7.\n\nKlum is seeking physical custody of the children, but visitation for her estranged husband. The filing states the couple entered into an agreement about how to divide their financial assets.\n\nThe pair announced in January that they were separating and called the split amicable.\n\nKlum's filing does not include any other details about the couple's breakup."
