        "text": "Seal has been in the public eye for three decades, as famous for his music as he is for his marriage to Heidi Klum (and, not forgetting, their iconic Halloween parties).\n\nBorn on 19 February 1963, the 54-year-old is still enjoying music success, having just released cover album Standards in 2017.\n\nFamous for tracks including Kiss From A Rose, Crazy and Get It Together, Seal has sole more than 20 million records worldwide.\n\nBut aside from his music, one question that is often asked is: how did Seal get the scars on his face?\n\nThere are a number of rumours surrounding how the scars may have come about, but the truth is a medical condition.\n\nThey are there as a result of a type of lupus called discoid lupus erythematosus.\n\nThis type of lupus is a chronic skin condition, involving sores, inflammation and the potential to leave large scars.\n\nIt generally affects the face, ears, and scalp, but it can affect other areas of the body, too.\n\nSeal – whose real name is Henry Olusegun Adeola Samuel – is currently believed to be single, having been romantically linked to both Delta Goodrem and Erica Packer over the past two years.\n\nHe was famously married to German model Heidi Klum and the pair have four children together.\n\nThey started dating in 2004, around the time Heidi fell pregnant with then-boyfriend Flavio Briatore, the Italian Formula One team manager.\n\nSeal had proposed to Heidi by December that year, popping the question in a quinzee he had built himself on a glacier in Whistler, British Columbia.\n\nThey married on 10 May 2005 on a beach in Mexico near Seal’s home on Costa Careyes.\n\nHeidi and Seal’s tradition was to renew their vows every year in a small ceremony with close friends and family on the anniversary of their wedding date.\n\nSeal said in a 2010 interview: ‘Each year, Heidi and I get remarried. It’s a great party, but for about an hour, we go off on our own down to a private beach.\n\n‘We sit there with the kids and read vows to each other as the sun sets. It’s a very special moment to us.’\n\nSeal adopted Klum and Briatore’s daughter, Helene Boshoven Klum, in 2009, with Heidi previously declaring Seal is her only father figure.\n\nSeal and Heidi also have three other children together – two sons Henry Günther Adeola Dashtu Samuel, 12, and Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel, 11, and daughter Lou Sulola Samuel, eight.\n\nThe couple announced they were divorcing in January 2012 and it was finalised in October 2014. They remain close friends.\n\nMORE : Stranger Things’ David Harbour and The Walking Dead’s Norman Reedus shine on the Critics Choice blue carpet"
