        "text": "Heidi Klum has taken aim at her ex husband Seal while giving an interview about her new husband.\n\nThe model, 46, is now married to musician Tom Kaulitz, 30, and she said he is the only real partner she has ever had.\n\nThis is a brutal dig at singer Seal, who she was married to for seven years and hosted elaborate vow renewal parties every year - which Seal later called \"a circus\".\n\nAnd her love of vow renewals has not stopped - she's already married Tom twice in a matter of months.\n\nProject Runway host Heidi told The Sun that Tom, who is her third husband, is the first man who has ever been her partner in life.\n\nShe said: “If I have troubles or I’m trying to figure something out, he’s an amazing listener and it’s just amazing to have a partner. I’m just a much ­happier person.”\n\n“For the first time, I have a partner who I can ­discuss everything with. Someone who shares duties that we all have in our life. I used to be on my own with everything.”\n\nBoth Heidi and Tom, who married in February 2019, recently tested negative for coronavirus after they displayed symptoms of the potentially deadly illness.\n\nShe posted a video of the two of them kissing with a window between them as she explained they were forced to isolate from each other while they waited for their results.\n\n\"Like many of you, I also have been sick all week and, unfortunately, my husband who returned from his tour a couple of days ago is also feeling ill,\" she wrote.\n\n\"To be safe, we are staying apart until we get the results of our Coronavirus tests (that we were finally able to get today) back.\n\n\"We don’t want to spread germs and risk others getting sicker... even each other! As much as I want to embrace him and kiss him, it is more important to do the right thing and not spread further.\""
