        "text": "\"...I always thought they looked like a lovely couple\"\n\nYes, that's exactly what their slick publicity machine wanted you to think - and they suckered you in alright by the sounds of it.\n\nIt just goes to show how utterly shallow, fickle and utterly self absorbed these people are to be photographed looking like love's young dream just a few weeks ago and to be splitting up now.\n\nEveryone knows that if you are growing apart in a relationship it takes time and happens gradually and your body language would show it. You would certainly not be canoodling with your partner like you'd just met them the week before if you had genuinely got as far as contemplating splitting up.\n\nWhat is sad is theat the newspapers give these people column inches and the oxygen of publicity that they crave. Ignore them and they'll wither on the vine.\n\nHow long will it be before we see either or both of these people \"stepping out\" with their new loves I wonder? And how soon after that will they be having a beach wedding and/or yet another child?\n\nEverything is easy come and easy go with people like these.\n\nI've just read an article re an interview Seal has just done with Ellen (reported in DM).\n\n'I think we were shocked,' he simply said. 'You go into these things with the greatest intentions when you say \"I do\" and you say \"?til death do us part.\" Those vows hold value. They are not just words.' You're getting divorced Seal - so they probably just are words aren't they?\n\nHe's promoting his new record, wearing his wedding ring, saying how much he loves Heidi and how shocked he is. All seems very strange to me???? There must be more to this than the 'we both love each other so much and are devastated and shocked' line that is being reported.\n\nJust read that article about his appearance on the Ellen show and it appears to me from what he's saying that she's the one who has kicked him into touch.\n\nWhat I do find odd is that in both the photos of the two of them kissing in that DM article it looks as if Heidi Klum is actively resisting him with her body language, while he on the other hand looks very overbearing.\n\nPersonally, I think he's yuk!"
