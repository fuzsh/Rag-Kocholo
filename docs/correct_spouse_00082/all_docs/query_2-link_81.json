        "text": "Heidi Klum and her husband, Seal, have confirmed reports the two are ending their marriage.\n\nIn a statement to People magazine, “While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate.We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart. This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.”\n\nAlthough the two staged annual renewals of their marriage vows, that didn’t mean all was well in the couple’s relationship.\n\nIt seems clear the pair has been having marital woes. A source who knows Klum and Seal as well as Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony told me Sunday morning both couples have one big thing in common:\n\n“It’s one extreme or the other. They either fight like cats and dogs – and Heidi has a vicious tongue – or they are all over each other, constantly kissing and hugging.\n\n“It was the same thing with Jennifer and Marc [now headed to divorce court], only the screaming and yelling was always in Spanish.”\n\nâ€ Another source said Sunday that Seal now regrets his Twitter post on Friday that clearly fueled the splitsville rumors. The singer tweeted “The End” alongside a photo of his forearm with a wings tattoo – thought to be an homage to Klum’s days as a Victoria’s Secret model.\n\nOver the weekend, Seal flew back to California and was hunkered down with Klum in their home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles. The singer is said to feel his wife lately has been more concerned with her career – specifically her TV projects like Bravo’s “Project Runway.”\n\nOn the other hand, Klum has been troubled by stories of Seal’s hard partying during the past year – when he’s been away a great deal on a concert tour.\n\n“It’s hard for any couple to keep it together when they’re apart so much – and Seal has been gone a lot this last year,” said the second source.\n\nThe couple are parents to three children together and have been married since 2005. Klum also has a daughter from an earlier relationship with Italian businessman Flavio Briatore.\n\nâ€ A further complication to any reconciliation: Seal is slated to head Down Under next month to serve as a judge on the Australian version of “The Voice.”\n\nNEW DIRECTION: Downers Grove native Denise Richards is telling pals she’s not attempting to revive romance with ex-husband Charlie Sheen – as she recently tried with ex-beau Richie Sambora.\n\nThe actress maintains she’s “just good friends” with both men – and plans to keep it that way, despite her history of tumultuous relationships with each – especially Sheen.\n\n“But that was when Denise was romantically involved with them. She’s saying she’s now having a great time with both, keeping it platonic,” said an L.A. pal Sunday.\n\nRichards reportedly is saying she hopes to find a guy with no connection to show biz – figuring that’s a safer way to go now.\n\nSTRONG SUPPORT: George Lucas is over the moon about the box-office success of his “Red Tails” this weekend, achieved by a combination of strong marketing to the African-American community by distributor Fox Searchlight and lobbying by black church and community leaders hoping to send a message to Hollywood.\n\nLucas had revealed he had to personally pay for “Red Tails” due to studio’s reluctance to bank a movie with African-Americans in all the key roles, fearing the subject matter (the all-black Tuskeegee Airmen unit in World War II) would not sell well domestically, and not at all internationally.\n\nAnother boost came from the many, many promotional spots on the OWN network plugging Oprah Winfrey’s Sunday interview at Lucas’ Skywalker Ranch, joined by his significant other, Chicago financial whiz Mellody Hobson, and “Red Tails” stars Cuba Gooding Jr. and Terrence Howard.\n\nTOURISM PRO: Congrats to Holly Agra, president of Chicago’s First Lady Cruises, who was re-appointed to a second term as a member of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board – part of that big Disney World ceremony to boost American tourism headlined by President Obama last week.\n\nEstablished in 2003, the board advises Commerce Secretary John E. Bryson on government policies and programs, plus other issues affecting the U.S. travel and tourism industry."
