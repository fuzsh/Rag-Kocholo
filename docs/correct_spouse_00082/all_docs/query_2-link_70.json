If there was any doubt that January hadn't earned its title of National Break Up Month, after a double dose of heartbreak havoc (i.e. Vanessa Paradis and Johnny Depp, and the knife through the heart, Seal and Heidi Klum… What ever happened to \"Happy Wife, Happy Life?\"), it's gone now. What's the deal, January? Why are there more breakups and divorces this month than any other time of the year?\n\nThis is what January wants to do to your heart--freeze it over with ice. Don't let it!\n\nIn my humble opinion, breakups should happen early March or April. Spring has everyone flitting about, you're no longer in hibernation mode, and there's…sun. But, turns out, January gets the honor and the reasons make sense if you think about it.\n\n__\n\nNew Year, New Life__: You made it through the holidays (admittedly, the WORST time to be single) and now you're ready to make this year the one that counts! Now is the time to start anew—ditch the zero and get with the hero, as they say. Oh, and go to the gym more than once a week, stop socially smoking and actually do something about that stubborn belly fat (full disclosure: that's my list).\n\nV-day: Another reason January gets the prize (besides it being not so good at anything else) is because of the impending holiday that is Valentine's Day. I suppose no one wants to celebrate a holiday that is all about love when she isn't feeling so lovey towards the other person.\n\n__Are there any other reasons you can think of? Have you ever broken up with someone in January? What month do you think is best for breaking up?\n\n__\n\nMore on breaking up:\n\n* Apparently Breaking Up Sucks So Bad It Needs to Be Outsourced\n\n* Is Your Sex Life Dwindling?
