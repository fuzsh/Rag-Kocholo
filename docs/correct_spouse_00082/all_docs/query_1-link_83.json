        "text": "Heidi Klum and Seal, seemingly happy in their union that they renewed their vows each year, announced Sunday that after \"much soul searching,\" they have decided to separate.\n\nIt's like Benetton suddenly went out of business.\n\n\"We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart,\" a statement issued by the couple says. \"This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.\"\n\nKlum, the supermodel and host of \"Project Runway,\" has a 7-year-old daughter, Leni, from a previous relationship with Italian businessman Flavio Briatore, but Seal, the singer, adopted her a few years ago and has raised her as his own. They have three other children together: Henry, 6, Johan, 5, and Lou, 2.\n\nThey started dating in 2003 and married in 2005."
