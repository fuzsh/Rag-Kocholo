        "text": "HEIDI Klum has responded to the criticism she faces over the age gap between her and her husband, Tom Kaulitz.\n\nThe America's Got Talent judge is over 10 years older than her husband.\n\nHeidi recently returned from a trip to Europe and has been experiencing major jet lag.\n\nBecause of that, she was up early on Sunday morning and decided to take to her Instagram Stories and let her followers ask her questions.\n\nShe revealed many things- from her weight to her favorite color to what her favorite alcoholic drink was.\n\nHowever, one fan turned the Q&A more serious when they asked: \"Don't you feel that you're in the age of Tom's mom or age really doesn't matter?\"\n\nTo that, Heidi delivered a savage response and said: \"I honestly only feel that way when people point it out to me.\"\n\nHeidi is 50 years old while Tom is 33.\n\nThe model has been married to her third husband since 2019.\n\nMODEL MOM!\n\nIn November 2022, Heidi revealed that she wants to have children with Tom.\n\nThe model model admitted she's been thinking about expanding her family now that her four kids are getting older.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The U.S. Sun at the pre-filming finale of NBC's America's Got Talent All-Stars show in Los Angeles, the German judge confessed she often thinks about starting a family with her Tokyo Hotel singer husband.\n\n\"I mean wanting it and it actually being possible are always two different things,\" Heidi said. \"The big 50 is just around the corner. And things get harder when you get older.\n\n\"But would I want it? Sometimes I think yes.\"\n\nHowever, Heidi understands her age may be a barrier.\n\n\"When the clock ticks when you get older it is not as easy as it was when you are younger.\"\n\nHeidi is already mom to daughter Leni, 18, and sons Henry, 16, Johan, 15, and Lou, 13.\n\nPEEKABOO-B\n\nEarlier this month, Heidi nearly toppled out of her bikini as she cuddled Tom in a vacation photo.\n\nHeidi and the Tokio Hotel guitarist jetted to Capri, Italy, to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary.\n\nThe model d several sweet videos and photos of the couple enjoying the stunning Italian island - where they tied the knot in 2019.\n\nIn one image, she wore a tiny animal print bikini while lying on her side next to Tom during a boat trip.\n\nThe couple drank from a bottle of red wine as they went on a tour of one of the island's grottos.\n\nThe Germany's Next Top Model host captioned the post: \"We love you Capri.\"\n\nIn other videos, the couple went on a motorbike ride along the coastline and had dinner on a balcony above a restaurant.\n\nHeidi wrote alongside them: \"Happy anniversary mein Liebling,\" which is German for \"My darling.\"\n\nThe Sports Illustrated model legally married Tom in February 2019 - two months after they got engaged.\n\nHowever, the couple threw a lavish ceremony for their friends and family on a stunning yacht in Capri several months later on August 3.\n\nHeidi kept quiet about most of the details leading up the big day.\n\nHowever, in February 2019 she joked to Entertainment Tonight that the ceremony would definitely be “on time.\"\n\n“We’re two Germans, it will be very organized and on time. Very, very much on time and very organized,” the catwalk star said."
