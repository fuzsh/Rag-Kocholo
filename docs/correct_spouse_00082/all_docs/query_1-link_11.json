        "text": "Heidi Klum and Seal‚Äôs son Henry is now a high school graduate!\n\nOn Instagram, Klum shared a bevy of photos and videos of her and her husband, Tom Kaulitz, at Henry's graduation.\n\nIn one post, Henry could be seen walking across a stage to a cheering crowd as he accepted his diploma. Klum, also included a video of her smiling in the audience while Kaulitz had his arm wrapped around her.\n\nAfter Henry's graduation, Klum posted a photo from their celebratory dinner, which showed Kaulitz and her kids, including her oldest daughter, Leni, and Henry, dining out at a restaurant.\n\nKlum also shared photos on her Instagram Stories of the sweet desserts, like cake and tiramisu, that they enjoyed.\n\nSeal, the father of Klum's children, also appeared to be in attendance at his son's graduation although he wasn't seen in any photos the former \"Project Runway\" host shared online.\n\nKlum and Seal co-parent their four children, Henry, Leni, Lou and Johan together. The couple were married from 2005 to 2014.\n\nWhile Klum regularly shares fun family snapshots of her kiddos online, Seal is a bit more private. However, in September 2023, he posted an adorable tribute to their daughter Leni.\n\nIn the Instagram photo, Seal was seen hanging out with Leni in New York.\n\n\"In NY with the young woman who changed my life for the better 19yrs ago. Thank you Leni for making me a better person,\" he captioned the post.\n\nWant to learn more about their family? Read on!\n\nLeni, 20\n\nIn 2004, Heidi Klum gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Leni Klum. The child's biological father is Flavio Briatore, but Seal adopted her while he was married to her mother (2005-2014).\n\nLeni Klum has been following in her mother's footsteps and started modeling in recent years. In 2020, the mother-daughter duo appeared together on the cover of Vogue Germany, marking the teen's first magazine cover photo shoot.\n\nThe following year, Leni Klum hit the catwalk as her mom proudly watched on from the audience.\n\nIn 2021, Leni Klum made a rare red carpet appearance with Seal at a movie screening and they coordinated their outfits, wearing all black ensembles.\n\nWhen the teen was looking for the perfect dress to wear to prom a year later, she borrowed a little black dress her supermodel mom wore 24 years before.\n\nLeni Klum certainly resembles her beautiful mother, and she also looks a lot like her grandmother. In 2023, the trio posed for a photo together and proved that good looks run in the family.\n\nHenry, 18\n\nIn 2005, Heidi Klum and Seal welcomed their first child together, a son named Henry G√ºnther Ademola Dashtu Samuel.\n\nWhile chatting with Good Housekeeping in 2011, Heidi Klum said her son \"lives in his own world\" and once wore dinosaur slippers to a fancy dinner.\n\n\"We went to dinner all dressed properly,\" she said. \"You can barely walk in those things, but for him, it‚Äôs not weird at all.‚Äù\n\nIn 2020, the proud mom shared a video of her son in his graduation cap and gown waving to onlookers as he graduated from middle school during the pandemic.\n\nLike his two younger siblings, Henry Samuel isn‚Äôt typically pictured with his face visible in his mom‚Äôs social media posts.\n\nBut in honor of her son's 16th birthday in 2021, Heidi Klum shared a throwback photo with her baby boy along with the following caption: \"One more year around the Moon and back ‚ù§Ô∏è I love you so much Henry üòÉHappy 16th Birthday ‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥üöÄ You have the kindest heart and the biggest SMILE üòÅ.\"\n\nThen, when Henry Samuel turned 18 in September 2023, Heidi Klum celebrated his special day by sharing a throwback baby pic of her son in a bathtub.\n\nShe captioned the pic, \"Henry Today you turn 18 ü•≥‚ù§Ô∏è HAPPY BIRTHDAY üéÇ Look how small you were and now you are 6‚Äú3 WOW ‚ù§Ô∏è I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART ‚ô•Ô∏è.\"\n\nThese days, Henry Samuel is taller than his mom and she poked fun at his height in an Instagram post in 2021. Alongside a photo of herself in between her two sons, the supermodel wrote, \"How did i get so short ?\"\n\nJohan, 17\n\nIn 2006, Heidi Klum and Seal's family expanded once again when they welcomed a son named Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel.\n\nIn a 2011 interview with Good Housekeeping, Heidi Klum said her son was pretty darn smart at the tender age of 4.\n\n‚ÄúYou show him any word, and he can read it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always the one with the book under the arm, and he always wants to know, ‚ÄòWhat is that?‚Äô He‚Äôs that ‚Äòwhy-why-why‚Äô kid.‚Äù\n\nSimilar to his siblings, Johan Samuel doesn't typically show his face in his mom's social media posts. In 2019, the supermodel's children covered their faces with custom Santa hats on Christmas.\n\nWhen Johan Samuel turned 15 in 2001, his mom shared a flashback video of him as a baby.\n\n‚ÄúA Heart of Gold and a Mind so Bright . Happy 15th Birthday JOHAN ‚ù§Ô∏è‚òÄÔ∏èüéÇü•≥,‚Äù she captioned the post. ‚ÄúI am proud of YOU and the young Man you have become.üòÅüåπüíñ.‚Äù\n\nThe teen appeared alongside his siblings in an Easter video his mom shared in April 2023 and he also made a cameo in a 2020 Halloween video.\n\nLou, 14\n\nIn 2009, Heidi Klum and Seal welcomed a daughter named Lou Sulola Samuel. The supermodel offered the following description of her youngest child in a 2011 interview with Good Housekeeping.\n\n\"She‚Äôs very observant. It‚Äôs probably quite a trip being born into a family where you have three older siblings. Boy, they pull her around. They don‚Äôt leave her out,\" she said.\n\nLou Samuel appeared in a video working out with her mom and older sister in 2020.\n\nWhen her daughter turned 12 in 2021, Heidi Klum shared a throwback photo of her as a baby with the following caption.\n\n\"HAPPY 12 th BIRTHDAY LOU ‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥üéÇ‚≠êÔ∏èüíùüå∫ü•∞üíé‚òÆÔ∏èüöÄüôèüèª,\" she wrote. \"I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Heidi Klum and her daughter attended Coachella and posed for a photo together. The proud mom shared it on Instagram, covering her daughter's face with a smiling emoji.\n\nAfter her divorce from Seal, Heidi Klum married guitarist Tom Kaulitz in 2019. She spoke to TODAY.com about her blended family in 2022, saying it's \"never easy\" to make it work.\n\n‚ÄúObviously when you get married and you have children, you hope for that to last forever,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhen I said ‚Äòyes‚Äô I meant yes forever. Unfortunately, that was not the case, and so you try to do your best to keep your children as happy as possible and keep them as grounded and loved most as possible.‚Äù\n\nLou Samuel is the youngest child in the family right now, but Klum said she isn‚Äôt opposed to having another baby. In February 2023, she told Jennifer Hudson that she isn‚Äôt shutting the door completely on having another child.\n\n‚ÄúNow I waited a long time, so maybe ja (yes),‚Äù she said."
