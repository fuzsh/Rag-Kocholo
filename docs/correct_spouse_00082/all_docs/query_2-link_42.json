        "text": "In 2019, Heidi Klum got hitched to Tom Kaulitz, the guitarist of band Tokio Hotel. Speaking with E! News, the supermodel said that Kaulitz is \"the one\" for her. \"I just know him so well. We just gel really well,\" she gushed. \"I just feel like, 'Finally, I found the one.' So far so good. I hope it stays that way.\"\n\nSeal hasn't found the same luck in love, having only been involved in a few flings here and there since the split, including relationships with Erica Packer and with Delta Goodrem. Apparently, he's having a hard time navigating relationships. \"They're hard for me, but I'm learning,\" Seal said in an interview with FAULT. He also had a tough time grappling with the fact that Klum had found someone new. \"I don't really have any comment to pass on that,\" he told the Daily Mail when asked for his opinion about his ex's new beau. \"I just don't have a lot of interest in that subject in general. What am I gonna say, what do you actually want me to say? I'm as confused as you are.\"\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlkbIF3hY6wn7Jlo5qurb%2BMpaavnV2htqexjKGYrGWSmrKvedSnnK%2BdnqmztriMrKCnm5Vitaa1w6JkpKSlonw%3D"
