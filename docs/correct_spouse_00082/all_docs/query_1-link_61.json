        "text": "Remember when everyone though that Heidi Klum and Seal were getting back together? Well, the rumours weren't true - the couple have just kept things very amicable. Because Heidi and Seal finally finalized their divorce this week.\n\nTwo years after the couple split they are now officially not married. E! News confirmed that pair are legally divorced, after a Los Angeles judge signed off on their request.\n\nWhen the pair announced their split, they were both very gracious about the ending of their relationship, releasing this statement:\n\n\"While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal, and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate. We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart. This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.\"\n\nHeidi appeared on Ellen this week, and had nothing but nice things to say about her ex, who she is regularly pictured with on family outings. Heidi also turned red and started giggling when Ellen questioned her about Vito Schnabel, the art dealer who is her current boyfriend.\n\nSource: E! News\n\nOn Wednesday 19 February 2014, we wrote...\n\nThe internet is today rife with rumours that Heidi Klum and Seal are back together. YAY.\n\nThe couple, who shockingly split in 2012, have been reportedly spending more time together with their children in recent weeks, which has led to a reconciliation.\n\nA source claimed: \"Late last year, their daughter Lou was quite upset about not seeing her dad as much. In the end, the couple decided to co-parent a lot more, attending sports games together etc.\n\n\"Then in the last couple of weeks, that turned into long dinners at the house, longer stays with the kids and then sleep overs. They're even kissing in front of the kids now. It's very much back on.\"\n\nHeidi and Seal appeared to have one of the strongest marriages in Celebdom - even renewing their wedding vows annually - so their divorce in 2012 couldn't have come as more of a shock to GLAMOUR Towers. The pair were married for seven years and have four children (including Heidi's daughter from a previous relationship).\n\nThe model-turned-TV presenter began a relationship with her security guard, Martin Kristen, shortly after the split but ended things last month, leaving the path clear for Seal! The source added: \"\"She still had feeling for Seal so couldn't let her relationship with Martin go to the next step… Unsurprisingly, the kids are really happy about their parents being back together.\"\n\nAwww. Please be true…"
