        "text": "Supermodel Heidi Klum has had a robust love life, having been married three times, first to stylist Ric Pipino from 1997 to 2002. After their split, she found love again with musical artist Seal. The pair had a very long-lasting relationship, marrying in 2005. They went on to have three children together but announced their separation in early 2012.\n\nFollowing her divorce, Klum dated around a bit and then met Tokio Hotel guitarist Tom Kaulitz. The new couple were married in 2019 and seem to have a very passionate relationship, which includes Klum’s personal passion for celebrating Halloween. Here’s everything to know about the model’s musician husband.\n\nWho is Tom Kaulitz?\n\nKaulitz is a musician who was born and raised in Germany, which is one of the things that drew him and Klum together, as Klum is also German. In 2018, Klum told People, “He is absolutely wonderful. Maybe it is because he is German, and we understand each other in a different way.”\n\nIn fact, Kaulitz is from East Germany, and he once gave her a piece of the Berlin Wall as a birthday gift, according to an interview she gave on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.\n\nThere are some differences between them, specifically a 16-year age gap. But Klum told InStyle, “Lately, I'm being reminded more about my age by people other than myself...My boyfriend is many years younger than me, and lots of people are questioning that and asking about it. That’s really the only time when age seems to be shoved in my face, and I have to give an answer for it.”\n\n“I don’t really think about it that much otherwise,” she added. “You have to just live a happy life without worrying too much about what people think because worrying is only going to give you more wrinkles.”\n\nKaulitz is a musician, and he has a rock band with his twin brother Bill. Kaulitz is lead guitarist, and the two of them plus Gustav Schäfer on drums and Georg Listing playing base make up Tokio Hotel. The brothers also co-host a podcast called Kaulitz Hills – Mustard from Hollywood. Bill also lives nearby, which is important to Kaulitz.\n\n“Bill lives close to us,” he said in an interview. “He only lives ten minutes away from us, so we all spend a lot of time together...Even at the breakfast table, we’re a lot of people and it gets crazy sometimes, but in a good way. I’m a family man, I love family and I love spending quality time.”\n\nWhen did Klum and Kaulitz start dating?\n\nIn March 2018, the couple was seen kissing on the set of Klum’s workplace, America’s Got Talent. They went public soon after, walking the red carpet together in May at the Cannes amfAR Gala.\n\nWhen did Klum and Kaulitz get married?\n\nWithin the year, the couple knew it was real. They were engaged in December 2018, which Klum joyfully celebrated on social media, telling fans, “I SAID YES.”\n\nThey were married only two months later in California, but they kept things quiet until their second wedding, which was a huge celebration in Capri, Italy, in August 2019. The event was held on a luxury yacht. It seems to be a place they visit together frequently.\n\n“I'm just a much happier person,” Klum told People in January 2020. “For the first time, I have a partner who I can discuss everything with. Someone who shares duties that we all have in our life. I used to be on my own with everything. For the first time, I get to experience what it is actually like to have a partner.”\n\nDo Klum and Kaulitz have any children together?\n\nKlum shares three children with her ex-husband Seal, daughter Lou and her sons Henry and Johan. She also has an older daughter, Leni, from a relationship with Italian businessman Flavios Briatore. Kaulitz has reportedly developed a relationship with them all and sees himself as an “extra dad.”\n\nA source told People that Kaulitz “made a huge effort to get to know them...He plays sports with Heidi’s boys and is involved in activities that the girls enjoy. Heidi loves his energy and take on life and feels very grateful that she met Tom.”\n\nDoes Klum still do Halloween costumes with Kaulitz?\n\nKlum has been famous for her Halloween parties since kicking off the annual event in 2000. While she has certainly been the star of the show on many occasions with her costumes, Kaulitz makes them even better by going along with whatever she wants. In October 2023, Klum dressed up as an elaborate peacock, and her husband joined in as...a peacock egg.\n\nBut even when they first started dating, he was all in. For her 2018 party, the couple dressed as Shrek and Fiona.\n\nAnd in October 2022, after taking a break for COVID-19, Kaulitz was a fisherman, and Klum was a worm on his hook.\n\nThey spent time on St. Barts after Christmas 2023\n\nThe couple enjoyed some warm weather on St. Barts, and were photographed on Saturday, December 30, sunning on the beach together. Klum wore bikini bottoms and no top, but put on a baseball cap and sunglasses to shield her face. She had one some pieces of jewelry, including bracelets and a pendant.\n\nThe model shared some shots and video of the say with Kaulitz on Instagram, writing, “ Love spending time with you ❤️.”"
