        "text": "Heidi Klum and Tom Kaulitz's relationship kicked off in March 2018, when they were first spotted together at a party thrown by jewelry designer Lorraine Schwartz. The couple met through a mutual friend, and it wasn't long before their connection blossomed into a whirlwind romance. They shared some unforgettable experiences during their time together, such as vacationing on a yacht in Italy and indulging in romantic getaways to Mexico. By December of the same year, the lovebirds decided to take their relationship a step further when Tom proposed to Heidi, leading to their marriage in August 2019.\n\nA guitarist for the German rock band Tokio Hotel, Tom Kaulitz gained international fame with the group's debut single \"Durch den Monsun\" in 2005. The band quickly became a sensation throughout Europe and later in other countries. Apart from being known for his relationship with Heidi Klum, Tom has also been previously married to Ria Sommerfeld, a German entrepreneur, however, the couple divorced in 2018 before he began dating Klum.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2017, Heidi Klum enjoyed a passionate three-year relationship with Vito Schnabel, a New York City-based art dealer. The two crossed paths at a star-studded event in Los Angeles, and were soon inseparable, frequently attending high-profile fashion events and art exhibitions together. The former couple was often seen packing on the PDA at various glamorous locations around the world, from Paris to St. Barts. However, in September 2017, the duo called it quits, citing hectic work schedules as the main reason for their breakup.\n\nThe son of celebrated painter and filmmaker Julian Schnabel, Vito Schnabel has carved out his own niche as a respected and successful art dealer. He has worked with various contemporary artists, helping them showcase their work and earn international recognition. In addition to his relationship with Heidi Klum, Vito has also been linked to other high-profile women, such as actress Demi Moore and model Amber Heard.\n\nHeidi Klum's relationship with her former bodyguard, Martin Kirsten, began in 2012 after her separation from musician Seal. The two met while Kirsten was tasked with protecting the supermodel and her family, and sparks soon flew between them. The couple was frequently spotted together, whether it was on romantic walks or enjoying family outings with Heidi's children. Their relationship, however, came to an end in 2014, after nearly two years of dating.\n\nMartin Kirsten, a South African bodyguard, gained public attention due to his relationship with Heidi Klum. Prior to their romance, he had primarily worked behind the scenes, providing protection to various celebrities and their families. Since his split from Klum, Kirsten has maintained a low profile and has not been publicly linked to any other high-profile relationships.\n\nArguably her most well-known relationship, Heidi Klum married British singer-songwriter Seal in May 2005, after meeting at an awards show in New York City. The couple was known for their annual vow renewal ceremonies and extravagant Halloween parties, making them one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples. Together, they had three children, in addition to Heidi's daughter from a previous relationship, whom Seal adopted in 2009. Despite their seemingly picture-perfect life, the couple announced their separation in 2012 and finalized their divorce in 2014.\n\nSeal, born Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Adeola Samuel, is a Grammy Award-winning musician known for his soulful voice and hits like \"Kiss From a Rose\" and \"Crazy.\" He has also made appearances as a judge and mentor on various singing competition shows, including Australia's and America's versions of The Voice. Besides his marriage to Heidi Klum, Seal was previously linked to model and actress Tyra Banks, as well as model Erica Packer.\n\nHeidi Klum's relationship with Italian businessman Flavio Briatore began in 2003, when they were introduced by a mutual friend at a dinner party. The pair's romance moved at a rapid pace, and Heidi soon became pregnant with their daughter, Leni. However, the couple's relationship took a sudden turn when they split in late 2003, with Heidi eventually moving on to marry Seal, who adopted Leni as his own. Despite the breakup, Flavio has remained in his daughter's life, occasionally spotted spending time with her over the years.\n\nA prominent figure in the world of Formula One racing, Flavio Briatore is known for managing teams such as Renault and Benetton. His charismatic personality and business acumen have gained him considerable wealth and notoriety throughout his career. As for his personal life, he has been linked to several high-profile women, including supermodel Naomi Campbell and Italian actress and television personality Elisabetta Gregoraci, whom he married in 2008.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Heidi Klum briefly dated Jay Kay, the frontman of British funk and acid-jazz band Jamiroquai. Although their relationship was short-lived, the couple made headlines when they attended the MTV Europe Music Awards together in 2002. The duo's romance fizzled out after only a few months, but it was long enough for Jay Kay to write a song about Heidi, titled \"Love Foolosophy,\" which appeared on Jamiroquai's 2001 album A Funk Odyssey.\n\nBorn Jason Luis Cheetham, Jay Kay is best known for his electrifying performances and distinctive sense of style as the lead singer of Jamiroquai. Over the years, the band has produced numerous hit songs, including \"Virtual Insanity\" and \"Canned Heat.\" Apart from the brief romance with Heidi Klum, Jay Kay has also been linked to British TV presenter Denise van Outen and model Kara Delevingne in the past."
