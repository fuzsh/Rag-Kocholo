This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.\n\nThey have three children together – Henry (6), Johan (5) and Lou (2) and together raised Klum’s daughter with former lover Flavio Briatore, Leni (7).\n\nThey met in 2003 and got engaged a year later, before marrying in Mexico in May 2005.\n\nEvery year they renewed their vows at a themed event, and they were also well-known for holding elaborate fancy-dress parties.\n\nThe couple also starred together in the video for Seal’s song Secret in 2010.\n\nRead: Engagements and break-ups – stars break the news on Twitter>"
