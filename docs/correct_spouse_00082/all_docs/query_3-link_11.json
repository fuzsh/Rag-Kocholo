        "text": "Heidi Klum says she’s partying more than ever thanks to her younger husband, Tom Kaulitz.\n\nKlum, 50, and Kaulitz, 34, tied the knot in 2019, and the couple are loving the nightlife now that her four kids have grown up.\n\n“They’re 19, 18, 17 and 14, so I feel like the days of me going to bed at 9:30 are kind of over,” the America’s Got Talent judge told Fox News in an interview published on Monday, February 5.\n\nHer first child, Leni, 19, was born from Klum’s relationship with Flavio Briatore. She also shares sons Henry, 18, and Johan, 17, and daughter Lou, 14, with her second husband, Seal, to whom she was married from 2005 to 2014. Five years later, she married Kaulitz, who plays guitar for the German band Tokio Hotel.\n\nKlum added her lifestyle changed after marrying Kaulitz.\n\n“It also has to do with my younger husband,” she explained. “I don’t know, but it’s just fun. It’s fun to go to a club. I enjoy music most of the time.”\n\nNow, instead of going to bed early with her children when they were younger, the supermodel admitted she often finds herself still out at a time when she used to wake up.\n\n“For me, I’m just like, ‘Oh, my God, the sun is coming up,'” she shared. “And I’m excited because I managed to stay up all night. This is amazing.'”\n\nKlum was born in West Germany and moved to the United States when she was 21 to pursue modeling. At the time, she was focused on her career and not socializing.\n\n“I was really business-oriented,” Klum explained. “I came from Germany and I landed in America and I wanted to succeed.” She added that she “didn’t want to fail and go back with my suitcase.”\n\n“Not necessarily that this would have been like a failure, let’s say, but for me, I really wanted to follow my dream and I wanted to become a model,” Klum continued. “So, I did not go out. I really wanted to have a career, so I worked on that.”\n\nHer dedication paid off, as she became one of the most successful models in the world, appearing on the covers of Vogue, Elle, InStyle, Marie Claire, Glamour, Harper’s Bazaar, Sports Illustrated and many more magazines. She also hosted the 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Shows and has appeared in numerous films and TV series.\n\nWhen she became a mother in 2004 at age 31, she focused on raising her children and avoided going to parties.\n\n“When you have four kids, they keep you up day and night because trust me, with four, there’s always one — either [one] has a fever, the next one has a bad dream … there is always something going on,” Klum said.\n\nKlum noted that she rarely worked events and afterparties while she was raising her children.\n\nNow she’s not only going to parties but is also recording party music.\n\nLast month, she released her rendition of Corey Hart’s 1984 hit “Sunglasses at Night” with Dutch DJ and producer Tiësto.\n\n“So now I’m going to the club and I look around, and I’m like, ‘Am I the oldest person here?’ And I’m like, ‘I think I am,’” she joked. “Then I feel really good when I look at Tiësto and I’m like, ‘Actually, Tiësto has five years on me, so I’m good.’”"
