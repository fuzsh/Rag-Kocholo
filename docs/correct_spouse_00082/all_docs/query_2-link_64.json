        "text": "Heidi Klum and her husband, Tom Kaulitz, looked like they had the best time ever at her son Henry's high school graduation.\n\nOn Friday, June 7, Klum shared a video of Henry receiving his diploma on stage. In the Instagram post, she also included a clip of her and Kaulitz smiling while sitting in the audience.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Klum posted a snap of her, Kaulitz and her children, whom she shares with ex-husband Seal, dining out at a restaurant while celebratory balloons sat in the middle of the table.\n\nShe captioned that post, \"Celebrating HENRY ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üéâ.\"\n\nOn many occasions, Klum has called Kaulitz the love of her life. The pair swapped vows in 2019, making him husband No. 3 for the supermodel-turned-reality TV entertainer.\n\nAnd it seems Klum ‚Äî who was previously married to stylist Ric Pipino (from 1997 to 2002) and to soulful singer-songwriter Seal (from 2005 to 2014) ‚Äî believes the third time‚Äôs a charm. She‚Äôs repeatedly dubbed Kaulitz the ‚Äúlove of my life‚Äù on Instagram. The many kiss-filled photos and video clips of herself alongside her bearded spouse appear to prove that the sentiment is mutual.\n\nHe‚Äôs her frequent red-carpet date. He‚Äôs her ‚Äúbeautiful and cute‚Äù partner. He‚Äôs even a perfectly coordinated plus-one at her annual Halloween bash. But there‚Äôs so much more to know about him.\n\nRead on to learn more about Heidi Klum's husband, Tom Kaulitz.\n\nWho is Tom Kaulitz?\n\nLong before he met Klum, Kaulitz gained his own fame as a musician.\n\nThe guitarist and songwriter is a founding member of Tokio Hotel, a rock and synthpop act popular throughout Europe. The band, with seven studio albums to their name, also boasts another member who shares the last name Kaulitz. And that‚Äôs no coincidence.\n\nKaulitz‚Äôs identical twin brother, Bill, is the lead singer. The siblings also co-host a podcast called Kaulitz Hills, and are \"double chair\" coaches on \"The Voice Germany.\"\n\nHow old is Tom Kaulitz?\n\nKaulitz was born Sept. 1, 1989, making him 16 years Klum‚Äôs junior.\n\nBack in 2018, before the pair wed, Klum addressed their age difference in an interview with InStyle.\n\n‚ÄúMy boyfriend is many years younger than me, and lots of people are questioning that and asking about it,‚Äù she told the magazine. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really the only time when age seems to be shoved in my face, and I have to give an answer for it. I don‚Äôt really think about it that much otherwise. You have to just live a happy life without worrying too much about what people think because worrying is only going to give you more wrinkles.‚Äù\n\nHow did Tom Kaulitz and Heidi Klum meet?\n\nWhen Klum sat down with Ellen DeGeneres to discuss her relationship with Kaulitz in 2018, she explained that she and the rocker met at a mutual friend‚Äôs birthday party, and she fell for him instantly.\n\n‚ÄúIt was to the point, so bad, that I couldn‚Äôt even look at him,‚Äù Klum recalled. ‚ÄúYou know when you‚Äôre immediately attracted to someone that you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOh, my gosh, I can‚Äôt look at him!‚Äô So, I had to sit next to him, instead of across, because then I would've had to look at him the whole time.‚Äù\n\nThey're both from Germany\n\nLike Klum, Kaulitz is German. It‚Äôs a detail that Klum believes created a special bond between them.\n\nIn that same chat with DeGeneres, she noted, ‚ÄúMaybe that was always the link that was missing. I needed a German. Yeah, we have the same roots and the same upbringing, the same understanding.‚Äù\n\nWhen did Tom Kaulitz and Heidi Klum get married?\n\nIn December of 2018, Kaulitz, who was previously married to model Ria Sommerfeld, popped the question to Klum ‚Äî and, as a post she shared on Instagram noted, ‚ÄúI SAID YES.‚Äù\n\nThe couple traveled to Capri, Italy, with friends and family and said their ‚ÄúI dos‚Äù aboard a yacht just eight months later.\n\nDoes Tom Kaulitz have any children?\n\nWhile Kaulitz has no children of his own, he‚Äôs now stepfather to the four children Klum shares with ex-husband Seal ‚Äî sons Henry and Johan and daughters Lou and Leni. Leni‚Äôs biological father is Klum‚Äôs ex-boyfriend, Flavio Briatore, however she was later adopted by Seal.\n\nTom Kaulitz loves Halloween as much as Heidi Klum\n\nKlum, known for her over-the-top, hyper-detailed, jaw-dropping costumes, has long been considered the undisputed Queen of Halloween, and now she has her holiday king.\n\nBut Kaulitz‚Äôs royal title doesn‚Äôt only come from marrying the woman who has dressed as everything from a senior to Jessica Rabbit to whatever this was."
