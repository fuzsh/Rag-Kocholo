        "text": "Seal has thrown shade at his ex-wife Heidi Klum, suggesting there is no ‘teamwork’ in their co-parenting.\n\nThe pair began dating in 2004 and got married the following year, going on to welcome three children together – Henry, 15, Johan, 14, and Lou, 11; Seal also adopted Heidi’s daughter Leni, 17, who she was pregnant with following a relationship with Flavio Briatore when she started dating Seal.\n\nDuring their marriage, they renewed their vows following a party for family and friends every year, and famously attended Heidi’s notorious Halloween parties in matching costumes.\n\nHowever, in 2012, they confirmed they had separated, and their divorce was finalised two years later.\n\nSpeaking about co-parenting with his ex, Seal admitted it can be ‘challenging’.\n\nThe 58-year-old told Us Weekly: ‘It requires teamwork. If you are a team, if both parents are a team, then it’s really easy and that’s not a real challenge at all.\n\n‘But you have to be a team. And if you’re not a team, then it can all fall to pieces.’\n\nWhen asked if he had that with Heidi, 47, the Killer singer said: ‘No… I never had that teamwork [with Klum]. We never had teamwork.’\n\nSeal, real name Henry Samuel also admitted he would not have chose a modelling career for their daughter Leni, who has followed in her mum’s footsteps, saying it ‘seldom’ ends in happiness.\n\nLast year, the exes clashed over Heidi’s plans to take their children to Germany over lockdown.\n\nThe German model requested an emergency hearing, as her ex-husband had not approved their children going to Europe with her to film Germany’s Next Top Model, citing coronavirus fears.\n\nIn her declaration, Heidi claimed that while they share custody, her ex’s ‘time with our children is sporadic at best’, and that they spend the majority of time with her.\n\nEventually, they came to an agreement, with Heidi permitted to take their four children to Germany and Seal ‘entitled to expanded time with the children’ upon their return.\n\nSeal is currently in a relationship which he is keeping private, while Heidi married musician Tom Kaulitz, 31, in 2019.\n\nThis is Heidi’s third marriage, having been married to stylist Ric Pipino between 1997 and 2002.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Klum’s rep for comment.\n\nMORE : Chris Hemsworth brutally mocked by brother Luke for ‘skipping leg day’"
