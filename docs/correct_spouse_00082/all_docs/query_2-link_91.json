        "text": "Heidi Klum has admitted that her divorce with Seal has got messy after he made controversial comments about her supposed relationship with her bodyguard\n\nHeidi Klum has admitted that her relationship with Seal has become strained since he made controversial comments about the circumstances in which she supposedly got romantically involved with her bodyguard.\n\nAfter photos emerged of Heidi cosying up to her bodyguard on holiday in Sardinia, Seal quipped that he was disappointed in his ex-wife, saying that she lacked 'class' and he thought she would have 'at least wait until we separated first before deciding to fornicate with the help.'\n\nSEAL ACCUSES HEIDI KLUM OF CHEATING ON HIM?\n\nThe former Victoria's Secret model then responded by releasing a statement saying: 'It is sad that Sealhas to resort to this kind of behavior and spread these untruths about the mother of his children.'\n\nBefore Sealthen clarified that 'he was not implying his wife was cheating while they were together, but he was merely pointing out that their separation and divorce were not final and they are still legally married.'\n\nAfter all this, it's no surprise that Klum has gone on the record to say that she and Seal are not on the best terms with each other at the moment.\n\n'I don't know if we're the greatest friends right now, especially because of the things that he said,' Klum admitted to Katie Couric in a pre-taped interview for her show this week.\n\n'I just saw him on, on Sunday. We were talking and we're in an okay place.'\n\nShe continued: 'It's a work in progress. You have to take it one day at a time. It's hard especially when you are in the public eye too. People are always looking at you closely and at everything you do. And they also don't always see exactly how it really is.'\n\nShe added: 'I haven't felt like correcting every rumour that is out there. I'm focusing on moving forward.'\n\nHeidi Klum and Seal were married for seven years before announcing their split in January. The pair share four kids: Leni, 8, Henry, 6, Johan, 5, and Lou, 2.\n\nHEIDI KLUM SPOTTED COSYING UP TO BODYGUARD ON HOLIDAY\n\nHEIDI KLUM SETS BODYGUARD RUMOURS STRAIGHT: I'VE MOVED ON"
