        "text": "Pop star Seal has hinted he could yet reconcile with his estranged wife Heidi Klum, declaring \"my love for her has not waned one iota\".\n\nThe Kiss From A Rose singer, speaking a week after the couple announced they are splitting up, said he still loved the supermodel \"with all my heart\".\n\nIn a candid interview with Piers Morgan on CNN, the 48-year-old insisted their break-up was not a \"charade\" but did not rule out getting back together.\n\n\"My love for her has not waned one iota,\" he said. \"I love her with all my heart. How can you not love somebody that you have just spent eight years with?\n\n\"Is it irreparable? You can never say never. Obviously I can't speak for my wife and again I'm not going to sit here and b******* you and tell you we haven't had problems - of course we have had problems. Otherwise, why are we splitting up?\n\n\"This is not a charade. We have problems, we have issues but to our credit we have always been able to talk about them.\n\n\"Whether we get back together or not, it may happen, I can't speak for her. Would I like it to? I don't know at this point to be honest. If it were that easy, if there weren't problems, we would still be together, that is the reality.\"\n\nThe German-born model and the singer have been married for almost seven years after tying the knot in a ceremony in Mexico in 2005 and have three children together.\n\nThey first met when Klum, 38, was pregnant with daughter Leni from her relationship with Italian tycoon Flavio Briatore. Leni was later adopted by Seal.\n\nThe couple had been thought to have one of the showbiz world's strongest marriages and were known for renewing their vows on every wedding anniversary.\n\nThey confirmed the split on January 23 after rumours began to circulate that they were filing for divorce. They said the decision had come after \"much soul-searching\".\n\n\"We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart,\" they said in a statement.\n\n\"This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.\n\n\"We thank our family, friends and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children's sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.\"\n\nGrammy award-winning Seal has continued to promote his latest album Soul 2 around the world despite the heartbreak.\n\nKlum, who became famous after modelling lingerie for Victoria's Secret, is now best known as host of the television show Project Runway which finds new designers."
