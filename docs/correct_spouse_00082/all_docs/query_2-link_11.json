        "text": "Looks like a lot of people are deciding to get hitched.\n\nSupermodel Heidi Klum and British singer Seal have gotten married, PEOPLE has confirmed. The couple, who got engaged just before Christmas, wed on a beach in Mexico. They are expecting their first child together in the fall.\n\nThe low-key ceremony was conducted in front of 40 guests near Seal's home on Mexico's luxurious Costa Careyes. Klum wore a Vera Wang ivory chantilly lace gown with an empire waist.\n\nKlum, 31, has a one-year-old daughter, Leni, whose father is Italian businessman Flavio Briatore. But from the beginning of Seal and Klum's romance in February 2004, the singer has acted like a father to Leni. He celebrated with champagne at the New York City hospital where Klum gave birth last May, and dedicated his latest album, Best: 1991-2004, first to \"my daughter Leni,\" then to Klum and her parents.\n\nA pal told PEOPLE: \"He is crazy about Leni, he is always carrying her around. He is the first one to change a diaper.\"\n\n\"What I love most about fatherhood,\" Seal, 42, said, is \"the opportunity to be a part of the development process of a new life.\"\n\nHe asked Klum to marry him at a ski resort in western Canada. \"I proposed on Dec. 23 at 14,000 feet in Whistler, B.C., in uncharted terrain on a glacier, in a natural snow cave, in an igloo built just for the moment,\" Seal told PEOPLE at the time. The German supermodel called the proposal: \"a once-in-a-lifetime event.\""
