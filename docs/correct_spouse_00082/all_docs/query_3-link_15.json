        "text": "Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho is Heidi Klum’s younger rock star husband, Tom Kaulitz? The Tokio Hotel guitarist is German like his Sports Illustrated model wife, and beat Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus as MTV’s best new artist\n\nSTORYPatti Sunio\n\nNov 4 , 2022\n\nNot your typical supermodel? As usual, Heidi Klum skipped the sexy Halloween costume this year for something … very unconventional.\n\nThe former Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover star tumbled out onto the red carpet dressed as a larger-than-life worm. She was “hooked” to her husband Tom Kaulitz who meanwhile sported a gritty fisherman look. The pair was, in the nicest way possible, a grossly sweet sight together.\n\nBut it’s not the first time the couple have topped celebrity Halloween best-dressed lists. So, what else do we know about Klum’s third hubby, who’s a guitarist for Tokio Hotel?\n\nTom Kaulitz is German, like Heidi Klum\n\nKlum and Kaulitz married in 2019 and are both of German descent. “He’s the kindest, sweetest, most caring, loving person,” the 49-year-old former Victoria’s Secret model was quoted telling Us Weekly in 2018.\n\n“He is absolutely wonderful. He’s German, and we maybe understand each other in a different way,” she added about her 33-year-old partner.\n\nHe’s part of a German rock band together with his identical twin brother, Bill\n\nTom is one of the founding members of German rock band Tokio Hotel together with his identical twin brother Bill, their lead vocalist, and two other bandmates. Tom is very slightly older than his twin, reportedly born 10 minutes ahead.\n\nTom is a guitarist, keyboardist and a singer-songwriter. The group won best new artist at the 2008 MTV VMAs, even beating Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus. Founded in 2001, Kaulitz’s band broke through the US market with the release of its first English-language album called Scream. Tokio Hotel continues to be active to this day.\n\nHe’s 16 years younger than Klum\n\nKlum was born in 1973 and Kaulitz in 1989, meaning they have a 16-year age gap. But the two have never seemed to mind it. Klum has addressed the fact that Kaulitz is many years younger than she is, saying that she’s been questioned and asked about it a lot in a July 2018 interview with InStyle. “That’s really the only time when age seems to be shoved in my face and I have to give an answer for it,” the former Project Runway host said.\n\nThe supermodel went on to add that, the rest of the time, she hardly ever really thinks about the age difference – and that worrying about what others say is only going to give her more wrinkles.\n\nHe’s a sweet guy!\n\nPer People, when Kaulitz was preparing to propose to Klum, he made sure to involve Klum’s four children – Leni, 18, Henry, 17, Johan, 15 and Lou, 13 – and they did it by preparing breakfast in bed for the model. It reportedly had coffee, flowers and a ring box. Kaulitz popped the question on Christmas Eve in 2018.\n\n“They went to Mexico before their engagement, around Thanksgiving, and that’s when he started talking to the kids about his plans in secret and it was so hard for them to not tell anyone,” a source told People. “They were so excited and happy for their mum.”\n\nThey secretly tied the knot in February, two months later.\n\nHe’s gamely joined dressing in costumes together with Klum for Halloween\n\nIn 2018, Kaulitz spent Halloween dressed as Shrek to match with his wife, who was dressed as Princess Fiona. The following year, while Klum went all-out as a freaky humanoid, Kaulitz stood by her side as an astronaut who seemed to have had a bloody experience in space.\n\nWant more stories like this?
