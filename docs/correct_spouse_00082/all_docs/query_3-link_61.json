        "text": "This article is over 2 years old and may contain outdated information\n\nHeidi Klum first burst onto the scene in the early ’90s, quickly becoming a supermodel and a household name. The German-born Klum was (and is) a sought-after cover model, gracing the front of publications such as Vogue, ELLE, and Marie Claire.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nShe parlayed her modelling career into television appearances, appearing on the hit shows Project Runway and America’s Got Talent, along with many other TV shows and movies. As we will be shining the light upon Klum’s love life in this article, a brief history of the same includes her being married twice over the years and the fact that she’s currently married to musician Tom Kaulitz.\n\nWho are Heidi Klum’s exes?\n\nBefore she married Kaulitz, Klum had two previous spouses. She married stylist Ric Pipino in 1997 and they separated in 2002. Following her divorce, she had a much-publicized marriage to the pop sing Seal, after he proposed to her on a glacier in British Columbia in 2004. The couple has three children together and they eventually split after seven years of marriage. She dated bodyguard Martin Kirsten until 2014 and then art curator Vito Schnabel that same year.\n\nHow did Heidi Klum meet her current husband?\n\nKlum met Kaulitz, guitarist for German rock outfit Tokio Hotel, while she was hosting Germany’s Next Top Model.\n\n“He’s German [too], so it’s been fun and easy for Heidi,” a source told Us Weekly. “Tom is a breath of fresh air for her. They fell into an easy rhythm really quickly.”\n\nThey made things official in the fall of 2018 and even dressed up like Shrek and Princess Fiona for Klum’s famous Halloween party in New York.\n\n“He is the kindest, sweetest, most caring, loving person. I feel so lucky. I don’t know the last time I was this happy in my life,” she told People at the time. She further shared that he is “absolutely wonderful,” wondering whether their strong bond is a result of him being German and added that no matter what the reason is, their relationship has been good so far.\n\nThey got engaged after dating for about eight months and were married in February of 2019. Klum is 16 years older than Kaulitz, but she told InStyle that “age is just a number and really doesn’t mean anything.”\n\n“Lots of people are questioning that and asking about it. That’s really the only time when age seems to be shoved in my face and I have to give an answer for it. I don’t really think about it that much otherwise. You have to just live a happy life without worrying too much about what people think because worrying is only going to give you more wrinkles.”\n\nThe America’s Got Talent judge has been married to Kaulitz since 2019 and has led a blissfully blessed married life since then. In a recent chat with SheKnows, Klum once again addressed the negative comments she received when she started dating Kaulitz and revealed that she decided to “cut out all the noise” as his presence in her life made her happy.\n\nKlum and Laulitz were recently seen at The Coachella Valley Music & Arts festival and looked how they usually do — two people in love with each other."
