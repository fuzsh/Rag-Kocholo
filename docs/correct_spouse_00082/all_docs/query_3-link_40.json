        "text": "For Heidi Klum, \"the third time's the charm\" has proven true.\n\nThe model recently celebrated her two-year anniversary with Tom Kaulitz, and, while speaking to Entertainment Tonight at the \"MTV Movie & TV Awards: Unscripted,\" she gushed that they still feel like newlyweds.\n\n\"I mean, I found my match, finally,\" Klum, 47, shared. \"I am very romantic and I do a lot of weird things, like I leave notes everywhere and I do a lot of things for him, and it's beautiful when you get that back from your partner. And it's the first time I feel like I really have a partner to do everything with.\"\n\nBefore her secret marriage to Kaulitz, the 31-year-old guitarist of rock band Tokio Hotel, in 2019, Klum was married twice. She was most recently wed to singer Seal from 2005 to 2014 and Ric Pipino before that, from 1997 to 2002. Klum has four children.\n\nElaborating on finding her true partner, she added, \"Yeah, I mean it took a while, you know, I'm going to be 48 and it's the third time, the third time's the charm.\""
