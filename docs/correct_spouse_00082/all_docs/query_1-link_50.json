        "text": "Heidi Klum has opened up about co-parenting with ex Seal, revealing things 'aren't rosy' between the two.\n\nThe 46-year-old model shares three children with the British musician, who she was married to between 2005 and 2014, separating in 2012, as reported by the Sun.\n\nTogether, the pair are mum and dad to 14-year-old Henry, 13-year-old Johan, and 10-year-old Lou - with Seal also adopting Heidi's 15-year-old daughter Helene from her previous marriage to businessman Flavio Briatore.\n\nHeidi and Seal separated in 2012 (via Getty)\n\nDiscussing their relationship in a new interview, Heidi explained: \"We try as good as we can. There’s always a reason why you’re not with someone any more, you know?\n\n\"It’s not all rosy-rosy. It just isn’t.\"\n\nShe continued to Red magazine: \"So sometimes it’s hard, but then you have to all come together as a family and sometimes everything is just like hopping on clouds.\n\n\"It’s just the way it is.\"\n\nHeidi and Seal hit the headlines throughout their relationship by throwing SIX elaborate themed vow renewal parties after their initial wedding — including a \"white trash wedding\" in 2009.\n\nAt the time of their shock split, Heidi blamed her husband's temper as she filed for divorce, with TMZ reporting at the time: \"Seal’s inability to control his anger has become too much for Heidi to take, in no small part because it’s affecting their children.\"\n\nShe was also said to have grown tired of him partying, and opened up about having to be \"mum and dad at the same time\" while Seal travelled a lot for work.\n\nThe pair share three children, with Seal also adopting Heidi's daughter from a previous relationship (via Getty)\n\nHeidi married third husband Tom Kaulitz last year, and reflected on his relationship with her and her ex's children in the new interview.\n\nShe told the publication: \"You see so many times that someone falls in love and then it doesn’t gel as well, so I’m so happy and grateful that everyone is happy with one another.\n\n\"That he is cool with my kids, my kids are cool with him - he’s a 30-year-old man, so there’s just a different life and spirit about him.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Heidi gushed about Tom in an interview with The Sun Online, telling us at the time: \"It’s been amazing. I met my husband two years ago. It’s like I have a partner for the first time.\n\n\"If I have troubles or I’m trying to figure something out, he’s an amazing listener and it’s just amazing to have a partner. I’m just a much ­happier person.\"\n\nMaking a thinly-veiled dig at her famous ex, the beauty added: \"For the first time, I have a partner who I can discuss everything with. Someone who shares duties that we all have in our life.\n\n\"I used to be on my own with everything.\"\n\nRead Heidi's full interview in the May issue of Red magazine, on sale 1st April."
