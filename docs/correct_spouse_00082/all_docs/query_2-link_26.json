I can't speak for my wife and I'm not going to sit here and BS you and say we haven't had problems. Of course we have had problems, otherwise why have we split up?\n\n'This is not a charade. We have problems, we have issues, but to our credit we have always been able to talk about them, to confront them. To assume that any couple goes without arguing is just nonsense.\n\n'I don't know at this point if I would like to get back together. If it were that easy, we would still be together, that is the reality.'\n\nThe 48-year-old star also spoke about the reasons he has not yet taken off his gold wedding band, insisting it is a mark of his eternal love for his wife.\n\nHe said: 'What this means to me and what this stands for - it stands for respect, it stands for loyalty, it stands for incredible memories and it stands for these four little miracles and Heidi making five that have come into my life over the past eight years.\n\n'There was some malicious thing about me still wearing my wedding ring for show but I'm still wearing my wedding ring because I am still married to this incredible woman and you don't all of a sudden from one day to the next, unless you are those type of people, say I hate you and take off your wedding ring.'\n\nSeal also told Morgan that one of the best things about his relationship with Heidi, with whom he has three biological children and an adopted daughter, was that they could overcome any issues stemming from arguments.\n\n'Never say never': Seal admitted during an interview with Piers Morgan that he hasn't ruled out a reunion with wife Heidi Klum\n\n'Never say never': Seal admitted during an interview with Piers Morgan that he hasn't ruled out a reunion with wife Heidi Klum\n\nHe said: 'I always used to say to my wife, the thing that I loved most about us is that we are a team, we are impenetrable in that respect.\n\n'The outside influences can't get in because at the end of the day it doesn't matter what happens behind closed doors because when we are out and about or when we have had disagreements even when we're in the house, can I look at you and say are you good when there are more important things to focus on.\n\n'This is not a charade': Seal also explained to Morgan the reasons why he has yet to take off his wedding ring\n\n'This is not a charade': Seal also explained to Morgan the reasons why he has yet to take off his wedding ring\n\nMeaningful: Seal said the ring stands for 'respect, loyalty and incredible memories'\n\nMeaningful: Seal said the ring stands for 'respect, loyalty and incredible memories'\n\n'And if she can look at me and say yes I'm good then that's something we have already been able to do. And that won't change. Whether we get back together or not, it may happen, I can't speak for her.'\n\nSeal's interview came as he continued his jaunt promoting his new album Soul 2. Earlier, the singer had performed the Al Green classic Let's Stay Together on the Ellen DeGeneres show.\n\nAfter he opened up to Ellen about the break-down of his marriage, he took to the stage to sing the classic hit, which includes the lyrics: 'Loving you whether, whether, times are good or bad, happy or sad.'\n\nCryptic: Seal sang Al Green's Let's Stay Together on the Ellen DeGeneres show\n\nCryptic: Seal sang Al Green's Let's Stay Together on the Ellen DeGeneres show\n\nThe track will feature on Seal's upcoming album.\n\nBut while Seal has been issuing forth platitudes about the breakdown of their marriage but besides the official statement, Heidi Klum has remained resolutely silent.\n\nThe 38-year-old model has also stayed within the confines of her Los Angeles home, but today she broke cover and headed out in a van with her head held low.\n\nFitting: The performance suggested he may have been sending a message to estranged wife Heidi Klum\n\nFitting: The performance suggested he may have been sending a message to estranged wife Heidi Klum\n\nDucking for cover: Heidi Klum, with her mother Erna, tries to hide behind the front seat of her van as she leaves home in LA for the first time since confirming Seal split\n\nDucking for cover: Heidi Klum, with her mother Erna, tries to hide behind the front seat of her van as she leaves home in LA for the first time since confirming Seal split\n\nAs he spoke to Ellen Seal didn't mention reports his wife had grown tired of his hard partying lifestyle and called time on their marriage.\n\n'I think we were shocked,' he simply said. 'You go into these things with the greatest intentions when you say \"I do\" and you say \"’til death do us part.\" Those vows hold value. They are not just words.'\n\nIt has been reported by People magazine that the final straw came during the couple's skiing holiday to Aspen over the Christmas period.

'Aspen was the final straw.'\n\nAnother source said: 'When they came together for Christmas as a family, things had changed and they fought a lot. Their Aspen trip was a bit of a mess.\n\n'Instead of enjoying being back together as a family, it was difficult for them to get along.'\n\nThe source added that Klum reached a point where she was 'done with the arguing.'\n\nRead more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/artic...interview.html#"
