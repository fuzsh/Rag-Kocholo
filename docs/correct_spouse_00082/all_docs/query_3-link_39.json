        "text": "America's Got Talent judge Heidi Klum has been married to Tokio Hotel guitarist Tom Kaulitz since 2019\n\nHeidi Klum made sure that her husband Tom Kaulitz celebrated his birthday in style by giving him the best present possible, a set of two adorable puppies.\n\nThe blonde beauty shared a gorgeous snap on her Instagram of Tom posing alongside his new pooches and he looked so in love with the duo as they obediently sat by the Tokio Hotel star. Tom resembled star Jason Mamoa as he wore his long brown hair loose as he cradled his white and brown dogs.\n\nIn her caption, Heidi revealed that her husband had initially been worried about adding new dogs to their brood, as she explained: \"When he tells you he is not ready for a new puppy and you surprise him with two on his birthday,\" alongside a pair of heart emojis.\n\nTom and Heidi were previously proud owners of three dogs, but two of the trio sadly passed away earlier in the year. In February, the couple's 15-year-old German shorthaired pointer Capper died, while their four-year-old Irish wolfhound Anton died a month later.\n\nHeidi and Tom have not yet shared the names of their two new pooches, but we can't wait to see plenty of beautiful photos of the pups over the coming months!\n\nThe new addition to their family comes a month after the couple headed to Capri, Italy, to mark their fourth wedding anniversary, and Heidi made sure to share a selection of stunning images from their trip abroad.\n\nPacking on the PDA with her musician hubby, Heidi couldn't have looked more relaxed in her leopard-print bikini as they cuddled up on the boat. Captioning the snaps, the America's Got Talent star wrote: \"We LOVE you Capri\".\n\nDuring their Italian trip, the pair were busy riding around on Vespas, taking boat trips and heading for romantic dinners with breathtaking views and Heidi made sure to mark their romantic milestone with a stunning carousel of photos and clips of their time together.\n\nWhen the pair married in 2019, they enjoyed a private ceremony in Capri. According to , the bride and groom exchanged nuptials on the Christina O yacht, which was formerly owned by Jackie Kennedy Onassis's second husband, Aristotle Onassis.\n\nRELATED: Seal and Heidi Klum's daughter Leni reunites with famous dad as he pays emotional tribute\n\nPHOTOS: Heidi Klum is an off-duty model in waist-cinching corset and boyfriend jeans\n\nFor her big day, Heidi chose an open-shouldered gown adorned in floral embroidery. It was designed by Pierpaolo Piccioli for Valentino. Prior to the wedding, Heidi had first laid eyes on the dress while meeting with Pierpaolo at the Valentino showroom in Place VendÃ´me. As for the groom, Tom put on a dapper display in a cream tailored suit. Heidi's four children â Leni, Henry, Johan and Lou â were all in attendance, as was Tom's twin brother and Tokio Hotel bandmate, Bill Kaulitz.\n\nSign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage\n\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
