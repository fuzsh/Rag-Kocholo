        "text": "Heidi Klum doesn’t think twice about the 16-year age gap between her and husband Tom Kaulitz.\n\nThe supermodel, 50, addressed being years older than Kaulitz, 33, during an impromptu Q&A session hosted via her Instagram Stories Sunday.\n\n“Don’t you feel that you’re in the age of Tom’s mom or age really doesn’t matter?” an anonymous fan asked.\n\nKlum explained to her fans that age is but a number for the pair and doesn’t affect their relationship at all.\n\n“I honestly only feel that way when people point it out to me,” Klum simply replied.\n\nThe “America’s Got Talent” host — who celebrated her 50th birthday with a blowout Gatsby-inspired bash in June — rarely acknowledges her age difference with the Tokio Hotel rocker, though she did speak about their age gap during a 2018 interview with InStyle.\n\n“Lately, I’m being reminded more about my age by people other than myself,” Klum, who was 45 at the time, told the magazine. “My boyfriend is many years younger than me, and lots of people are questioning that and asking about it.”\n\nShe continued, “That’s really the only time when age seems to be shoved in my face and I have to give an answer for it.”\n\nEven back then, Klum admitted that she doesn’t think about their age unless the topic is brought up to them by others.\n\n“I don’t really think about it that much otherwise,” she shared. “You have to just live a happy life without worrying too much about what people think because worrying is only going to give you more wrinkles.”\n\nBeing married to a much older woman clearly doesn’t bother Kaulitz either, considering he is constantly seen getting handsy with the former Victoria’s Secret angel.\n\nJust last month, he was seen grabbing Klum’s bum while enjoying a romantic trip in Capri, Italy. Days earlier, they were seen showing PDA while walking the streets in Venice.\n\nThe duo clearly share an intense lust for each other as they continuously share flirty photos together and tend to make out with each other in public quite regularly.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe German American beauty and Kaulitz were first romantically linked in April 2018 and made their red carpet debut at the Cannes amfAR Gala a month later.\n\nThat December, Klum confirmed that she and Kaulitz were engaged, and they secretly tied the knot in February 2019.\n\nKaulitz is the “Project Runway” alum’s third husband. Klum was previously married to Ric Pipino from 1997 to 2002, and from 2005 to 2014 to Seal, with whom she welcomed three kids: Henry, 17, Johan, 16, and Lou, 13.\n\nKlum also welcomed 19-year-old daughter Leni with ex Flavio Briatore, but her doppelgänger daughter was later adopted by the “Kiss from a Rose” singer.\n\nMeanwhile, the guitarist was previously married to Ria Sommerfeld from 2015 to 2018, though they share no kids together."
