        "text": "After a whirlwind summer which included getting married aboard the iconic yacht Christina O. on August 3 and then spending weeks exploring the coast of Italy aboard a different yacht, Heidi Klum and her new husband, Tom Kaulitz, are finally back on land and settling into their new life. To begin their next chapter, the Tokio Hotel guitarist gave his wife an extra special gift on September 3: a piece of the Berlin Wall. The model caught the extraordinary moment the piece arrived in their garden via crane on video, and excitedly shared the process in an Instagram post.\n\n“Today a special gift from my husband arrived…a piece of the Berlin Wall that had separated East & West Berlin for 28 years,” she captioned the clip. Klum was born in Bergisch Gladbach, in western Germany, and explained that Kaulitz was born on the other side of the divide: “My husband was born behind the wall on the East Berlin side 4 weeks before it was torn down in 1989. This allowed him to grow up in a Germany that was unlike the country his own parents had grown up in … He was able to experience freedom and joy and creativity and art and hope. Every morning, I will look at this beautiful piece in my garden with the knowledge that walls do not need to be built … they need to come down.”\n\nThe piece of the wall is colorfully covered in artwork on both sides, with cartoonish faces that are easily identifiable as the work of French artist Thierry Noir, who is widely considered to be one of the first street artists. Noir is hailed for his artwork as a form of protest—it was forbidden to paint the wall at the time—and he and his partner, Christophe Bouchet, were once held up by soldiers with machine guns after they attempted to drill a metal door onto the wall.\n\nPart of the reason Noir’s work is so simple is because he had to paint as quickly as possible, relying on a combination of two ideas and three colors. “I did nothing but react to [the wall’s] sadness,” he said in a statement to the Howard Griffin Gallery, which shows many of his works. In an interview with the Independent in 2014, he said, “I wanted to cover the wall with colors, to wrap it up with paintings, to make it luminous, to show it like a mutation in the city, a mutation in art and nature. I could not make the wall beautiful because in fact it would have been absolutely impossible to do so.”\n\nSections of the Berlin Wall, such as those at Potsdamer Platz, Bernauer Strasse, and Muhlenstrasse, were deliberately left at the site as a reminder of the Cold War; other parts of the wall have since been torn down and put on display in multiple museums."
