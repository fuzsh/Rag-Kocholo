        "text": "Seal and Heidi Klum’s shock announcement that they're separating has led to questions about what will happen to their four children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple, who have been married for seven years, were seen as a positive example of a loving celebrity relationship. They're well known for renewing their wedding vows each year and being openly affectionate as a family.\n\nSeal and Heidi have three children of their own, Henry, 6, Johan, 5, and Lou, 2, while their oldest Leni, 7, is Heidi’s daughter from a previous relationship with Formula One businessman Flavio Briatore.\n\nHowever, Seal became involved with Heidi while she was pregnant with Leni, and has been Leni’s dad in every way (apart from his DNA). \"I don't want her to feel different because I know what that's like, being a kind of stepson,\" said Seal in 2009, when he officially adopted Leni. \"It doesn't make her any more or less my daughter. She always has been.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old supermodel Heidi and Grammy Award winning singer Seal are both busy with their own careers, which often take them to different parts of the world. Seal has just launched his new album, Soul 2, and has been busy promoting it in the UK in the past couple of weeks.\n\nMore like this\n\nSo how will they share the parental duties in the future? Some celebrity parents have amicable arrangements, such as Demi Moore and Bruce Willis while Madonna and Guy Ritchie have managed to share parental duties across different continents. However, other celebrities have had custody spats that have taken years to resolve, such as Halle Berry and Britney Spears.\n\nThe word is it's an amicable split at the moment, and Seal and Heidi are putting their children first - let's hope it works out for all of them...\n\nRead more...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeidi Klum - the world's highest paying tooth fairy?\n\nHeidi skates with her buggy on ice\n\nCharlie Sheen loses custody of his twin sons"
