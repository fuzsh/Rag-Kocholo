        "text": "Supermodel Heidi Klum has requested an emergency hearing to get permission for her four children to join her in Germany, according to a declaration obtained by People.\n\nIt states that her ex husband Henry Olusegun Adeola Samuel, better known as Seal, refuses to allow their kids to fly due to the global pandemic.\n\nThe couple, who ended their seven-year marriage in 2012, now share custody of their children, Leni, 15, Henry, 14, Johan, 13, and ten-year-old Lou.\n\nBut Klum, who is in the country filming Germany’s Next Top Model, claims that the children spend more of their time with her.\n\nAccording to People, the document states that she is willing to change their previously agreed custody schedule to allow them to join her.\n\n“Henry’s time with our children is sporadic at best,” the presenter is said have written in the document.\n\nIt is claimed that the children usually join Klum on work trips, but on this occasion Seal has not agreed to it.\n\n“I am well aware of all of the necessary precautions associated with the COVID-19 virus, and would never put our children at risk — I have taken all the precautions for Germany the same way I do in the United States,” Klum reportedly says in the declaration.\n\nIt also states that as Seal has a British passport he would be able “to visit the children while they are in Germany if he wishes to do so”.\n\nIt suggests that Klum has sought the court order as she has tried to make an agreement with Seal to no avail.\n\nEldest daughter Leni, whose biological father is businessman Flavio Briatore, has also reportedly submitted a document saying she wishes to go to Germany with her mother.\n\nWhen the couple made the decision to divorce in 2012, they released a statement which read: \"While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate.\n\n“We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to Klum's representatives for comment."
