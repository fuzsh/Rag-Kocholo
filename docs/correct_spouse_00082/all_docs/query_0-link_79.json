        "text": "SEAL claimed his ex-wife Heidi Klum's \"hidden agenda’\" is to move their children to Germany \"forever\" amid their bitter custody battle.\n\nThe former Project Runway host previously alleged that the singer wasn't letting her take her children to Germany as she films Germany's Next Top Model due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSeal, whose real name is Henry Olusegun Adeola Samuel, is now asking the courts to deny Heidi's request to take their four children to Germany in the fall, claiming her true intention is to move there for good, court documents obtained by The Blast read.\n\nAlong with his filing, the 57-year-old singer included an email from March 17, 2020, where the 47-year-old supermodel claims she is looking for a home in Germany to keep their three youngest children safe.\n\n\"I believe Heidi has a hidden agenda to move the children to Germany,\" Seal claimed in the documents, according to the news outlet.\n\n\"Notwithstanding Heidi’s request, if granted, it could in effect move the children away from me and their home here in Los Angeles to Germany for what could be an indefinite period of time given the uncertainty of the impact of Covid-19 on this country’s and Germany’s travel restrictions which could change at any time and prevent the children from leaving Germany or from entering the United States.\"\n\nThe British singer further claimed that he doesn't see their children enough because of her.\n\n\"Unfortunately, when I ask Heidi for more time to see the children, Heidi often makes it unnecessarily difficult by alleging that she and the children are 'busy' on particular days’, that the children are ill, or that they simply cannot see me,\" he claimed.\n\n\"As such, I am often forced to see the children on Heidi’s schedule and when it is convenient for her, which has significantly decreased my custodial time. Nevertheless, I make it a point to spend as much time with the children as possible and to make myself accessible to the children.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I believe Heidi's (request) is a disguised attempt to move away with our children to Germany.\"\n\nThe father of four then explained to the court the contents of the alleged email and claimed: \"Heidi stated that she was an 'absolute wreck' as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and that she would like to 'leave' with the children immediately because she was 'worried' for what was to come next in the U.S.\n\n\"Heidi also informed me that she had been looking at a house in the countryside of Berlin, Germany and that she was prepared to leave with the children, especially since she and the children had German passports.\"\n\nHe claimed that he \"chalked it up\" to Heidi's \"historical paranoia and anxiety\" in uncertain times\" and also claimed that she \"previously expressed to me her concerns that the U.S. would turn into a 'police state' in the face of social unrest.\"\n\nThe singer said in the court documents that he told her he would not agree to allow the kids to move so far away from him.\n\n\"In light of the COVID-I 9 pandemic and the dynamic travel restrictions and orders, I was also worried that our children may not be able to return to the U.S. if they were taken to Germany,\" he claimed.\n\n\"Over the last few months, as Heidi’s requests to move with our children to Germany have increased, I repeatedly reiterated to Heidi my concerns with the move and have made it clear that I will not provide my consent.\n\n\"I am extremely concerned about our children’s well-being in light of Heidi’s request to uproot our children’s lives and to remove them from the stable environment they are accustomed to here.\"\n\nHe further claimed he is worried because Heidi is a German citizen, and \"she may unilaterally decide not to return to them to the United States.\"\n\nAccording to the documents, the singer says even if Heidi is not trying to move the kids to Germany permanently, he is still worried they may get stuck overseas.\n\n\"I also worry that the COVID-19 pandemic may peak in Germany, which could potentially put our children at risk of contracting a deadly virus in a foreign country or could cause Germany to close its borders, thereby disallowing entry into and exit from Germany,\" he claimed.\n\n\"Additionally‚ the U.S. could close its borders and/or restrict Heidi and the children from returning to the U.S. Regardless of Heidi's motives, this would inevitably result in a move away of the children to Germany.\"\n\nThis new development comes after Heidi claimed Seal wouldn't let her take the kids to Germany while she films Germany's Next Top Model.\n\nHeidi is now asking for an emergency hearing to allow her to bring their children to Germany later this year.\n\nShe wants to take the three children she shares with Seal – Henry, 14, Johan, 13, and Lou, 10 –, along with her eldest Leni, 16, whose father is Italian businessman, Flavio Briatore.\n\nIn a declaration obtained by PEOPLE, the America's Got Talent judge said their kids spend most of their time living with her, despite her having joint custody with Seal.\n\nHeidi wrote: \"Henry's [Seal] time with our children is sporadic at best.\"\n\nShe is contractually obliged to film season 16 of Germany's Next Top Model in October and usually brings the kids when she travels abroad for work.\n\n\"I am well aware of all of the necessary precautions associated with the COVID-19 virus, and would never put our children at risk – I have taken all the precautions for Germany the same way I do in the United States,\" Heidi said.\n\nShe added that GNTM is usually filmed in LA so that her children can stay in the US, but the German cast and crew are unable to enter the US due to the pandemic.\n\nHeidi said she's willing to let Seal spend Christmas with their kids – even though it's her year to have them – if he allows them to go to Germany.\n\n\"There will be a three-week break for the Christmas holidays ... Though the children were originally slated to spend this Christmas break with me (as Henry spent Christmas 2019 with them), I am willing to agree that Henry spend the Christmas break with them again this year so that the children can be with their father during this time, if Henry would like this,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Also, as Henry [Seal] has a British passport, he would be able to visit the children while they are in Germany if he wishes to do so,\" she added.\n\nHeidi claimed Seal agreed back in April to let the children go to Germany – but later changed his mind.\n\nShe wrote: \"I tried to work this out with Henry directly to no avail,\" and added that she is \"desperate.\"\n\nThe presenter said the children do no want to stay in LA with their dad, writing: \"It could not possibly be in their best interests.\"\n\nTheir daughter Leni said the kids are \"upset\" and \"frightened\" at the thought of being away from Heidi for so long.\n\n\"This is hard because I love both of my parents, but I feel like I need to speak up. I understand that my siblings are too young to speak to the judge, so I am happy to speak for all of us,\" the 16-year-old wrote in a declaration.\n\n\"My mom needs to film in Germany for a few months and my siblings and I want to go with her,\" Leni continued.\n\n\"So far, my dad is not allowing us to go, though we have tried to tell him our reasons why we want to,\" Leni said, adding that going to Germany would be an \"amazing opportunity\" for them and a chance to see their grandparents.\n\nLeni also penned a handwritten letter to Seal, begging him to let her and her siblings go to Germany, The Blast reported.\n\nShe said she understands that the situation is \"not ideal at all\" but that she hopes \"they can come up with a plan\" to still see him.\n\nLeni also pointed out that there are fewer cases of coronavirus in Berlin than there are in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I just want to figure out something and come up with a plan and agreement as a family. I love you so so much,\" the teen concluded.\n\nHeidi and Seal separated in 2012 and finalized their divorce in 2014.\n\nThe German businesswoman previously admitted co-parenting with Seal is \"hard\" and that things \"aren't rosy\" between them.\n\nHeidi and Seal hit the headlines throughout their relationship by throwing six elaborate themed vow renewal parties after their initial wedding - including a \"white trash wedding\" in 2009."
