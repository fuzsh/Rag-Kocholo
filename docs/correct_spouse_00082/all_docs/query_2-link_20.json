        "text": "You compare Heidi and Seal with, Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow! These two couples couldnt be any more different!\n\nHeidi and Seal were always parading around, advertising their love and togetherness by lavish parties and marriage renewals, always wanting to be \"seen\"!\n\nChris and Gwyneth, on the other hand, have always kept their marriage private, and they are never seen together on red carpets, because they beleive that you dont have to show outward displays of togetherness to prove to the outside world that you are in a relationship!! Unlike Heidi and Seal, Chris and Gwyneths marriage was so private even their families didnt know about it! Even if they do attend functions together, Chris enters by one door and Gwyneth goes through another door, because they are always conscious of stealing each others thunder. The thing is their marriage is as solid as a rock! Many people close to them have said so!\n\nWhat a huge difference!\n\nShock . Not. Saw a blind item recently which I'm pretty sure referred to them. No one is as blissfully happy as they claim to have been.\n\nAlso a few years ago now, I saw Seal (he was in the UK and behind the wheel of a 4-wheel drive), eyeing me up and trying to to stare me down as if to say 'Don't you know who I am?' I wasn't even looking particularly hot that day. Lol. Of course I feigned non-recognition...\n\nI know what your are saying, but it would also be a surprise is Chris and Gwyneth just called it a day out of nowhere.\n\nThey might both go about their public life in a different way, but I never thought H&S were doing the love up thing for publicity [they have had 3 children] and it does sound a bit sad if true.\n\nYou compare Heidi and Seal with, Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow!

The woman is constantly pregnant which I would think may have caused him to look outside the marriage, if you get my drift. He adopted her first child from some bad relationship she had. So now they are breaking up with four kids. Seal is an OK singer, don't find him attractive at all and of course, it was viewed as amazing he got a woman like Heidi but in all truthfulness, men are often children that need lots of attention and with Heidi always being pregnant, and having Project Runway and so on, he probably felt quite neglected. I think she is divorcing him because he's a child inside."
