        "text": "Natalie` said:\n\nCongrats to them both =)\n\nI wanna know what they`ve called the baby..any one know ?\n\nKlum Names Baby \"Henry\"\n\nCatwalk queen Heidi Klum has named her newborn son after her singer husband Seal and her father Guenther. The golden couple's first child together, who was born on Tuesday, boasts the impressive full name of Henry Guenther Ademola Dashtu Samuel, taking the middle name from his father's long moniker - Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Samuel. And the German beauty is thrilled the new arrival has already been accepted by his big sister 16-month-old Leni, her daughter from a previous relationship with Formula One manager Flavio Briatore. Klum enthuses, \"One of our greatest moments so far was when Leni kissed her little brother many times on the head.\"\n\n(from IMDb.com)\n\nBrazilian Girl said:\n\n\"One of our greatest moments so far was when Leni kissed her little brother many times on the head.\"\n\n(from IMDb.com)\n\nI'm jealous. When I was born my brother told my mom to throw me away.\n\n^ oops! I didnt read your post.....\n\nand now that I have...I agree! love how Seal treats Leni with unconditional love and like his own flesh and blood. Something you rarely see between stepfather and stepchild, in my opinion.\n\nNow this is a loving family here. I hope they don't do the Hollywood thing and get divorced 5 yrs down the road."
