        "text": "— Seal and Heidi Klum have announced that their marriage is coming to an end.\n\nIn a statement Sunday night, the couple announced their separation after rumors swirled over the weekend that a divorce was imminent.\n\n“While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul searching we have decided to separate,” the joint statement read. “We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart. This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition. We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children’s sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.”\n\nThe couple married in 2005 and has four children together, including the supermodel’s daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nOne of Hollywood’s most high-profile couples, they renewed their wedding vows each anniversary, boasted of their love in the media, and threw Halloween bashes together where they dressed in outrageous outfits.\n\nTMZ first reported on Saturday that the two planned to divorce this week.\n\nHis announcement comes as he releases his new album, “Soul 2,” on Tuesday, which has songs like “Love T.K.O,” “Let’s Stay Together” and “Love Don’t Live Here Anymore.”"
