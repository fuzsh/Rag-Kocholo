        "text": "Heidi Klum, 50, has disclosed that her husband, Tom Kaulitz, 34, has sparked a newfound enjoyment for nightlife in their lives since their marriage in 2019. With her four children—ages 19, 18, 17, and 14—growing up, Klum finds herself embracing a more vibrant social scene.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News published on February 5, the America's Got Talent judge shared insights into her evolving lifestyle. Klum's eldest child, Leni, was born from a previous relationship, while her three younger children were with her former husband, Seal. Following her marriage to Kaulitz, who is a member of the band Tokio Hotel, Klum noticed a shift in her routines.\n\nAttributing part of this change to her younger spouse, Klum expressed her newfound enjoyment of clubbing and music. She reminisced about her past dedication to her career upon moving to the United States from West Germany at the age of 21, emphasizing her focus on success rather than socializing.\n\nKlum's career trajectory soared as she graced the covers of esteemed magazines and hosted prominent fashion shows. However, upon becoming a mother at 31, she redirected her attention to parenting, opting out of the party scene to prioritize her children's upbringing.\n\nNow, with her children older and more independent, Klum finds herself immersing in the nightlife she once abstained from. Additionally, she recently collaborated with Tiësto on a musical project, further embracing her newfound affinity for party culture.\n\nReflecting on her journey, Klum marvels at the transformation from a dedicated career woman to someone who embraces the spontaneity of staying out until sunrise. Her story serves as a testament to the evolving nature of life's priorities and the joy found in embracing new experiences, even at unexpected stages in life."
