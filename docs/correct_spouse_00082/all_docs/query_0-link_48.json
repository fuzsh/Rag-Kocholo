        "text": "Looks like the news media got it wrong again, they aren't even divorcing..\n\nhttp://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/01/heidi-klum-seal-still-together-now\n\nI don't think TMZ got anything wrong - they quoted 'sources with direct knowledge,' which I believe they have - so much as the story has shifted. \"As early as next week\" didn't mean it was going to be next week in any event.\n\nMaybe they'll stay together after all - which I predicted as a possibility, like Larry King and his wife who actually DID file for divorce before they went for a ride and talked things out - but the fact that they are together 'for now' doesn't mean too much either; Demi Moore waited for how long before finally filing for divorce from Ashton Kutcher?\n\nFor the sake of their whole family I hope Heidi and Seal can work things out.\n\n0\n\nSince the announcement was very low ley, little detail, no sensationalist speculation and announced on a Sat when there's far less media coverage, I very much doubt there's any hidden agenda here.\n\nAnd yes, the BI pointed the finger at him.\n\nThanks lexi\n\nWhat kind of idiot buys an album because they think the person who made it is on the brink of divorce?\n\nI don't think the poster was suggesting such a thing.\n\nSurely the PR mantra is that there is no such thing as bad publicity.\n\nTo give you a personal example I've ordered an Etta James album from Amazon purely because of the sad publicity of her death which prompted me to listen to her fabulous voice.\n\nI wasn't D D.... I didn't know he had an album out until I googled to see if marriage break up was true.... and hey ho he was appearing on Jonathon Ross that night..... some people might be interested in hearing his latest album as perhaps they would expect it to contain 'soul searching' material??..... who knows how the world of PR works??!!\n\nAnyway seems its for real....\n\n'While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate.\n\n'We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart.\n\n'This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.\n\n'We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our childrenâ€™s sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.'\n\nRead more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2090463/Heidi-Klum-Seal-divorce-Couple-confirm-end-7-year-marriage.html#ixzz1kHVticKX\n\nNot buying into the 'growing apart'..... everything looked very 'together' on her last twitpic.... respect to her if she is covering for his cheating..... she might just want to protect her kids....\n\nI recall a programme about his damaged childhood.... I guess he could have some abandonment issues and maybe that's why he needed the re-assurance of re-newing the vows every year.\n\n0"
