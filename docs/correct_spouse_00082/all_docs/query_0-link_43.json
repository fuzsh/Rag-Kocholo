        "text": "What appeared to be one of the happier celebrity marriages may be over. TMZ reports that supermodel Heidi Klum will soon file for divorce against her longtime husband Seal, citing “irreconcilable differences.”\n\nKlum, 38, and Seal, 48, have been married for six years, and each year renew their vows on their anniversary with an outrageous costune party. The couple have three children together, and Seal adopted Klum’s daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nPHOTOS: HEIDI AND SEAL\n\nThe report didn’t elaborate on the reason for the divorce, but the couple was having a ball in Aspen last month, where Seal tweeted a photo of himself shirtless in a pile of snow after losing a bet to his wife.\n\nFortune magazine said Klum made $20 million last year, TMZ reported.\n\nIn 2009, Klum gushd in Page Six magazine that Seal was “the one,” and called her six-foot-three hubby a “gentle giant.”"
