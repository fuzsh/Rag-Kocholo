        "text": "Heidi Klum has become close with her bodyguard of four years, Martin Kristen — too close, according to the supermodel's bitter, soon-to-be ex-husband, Seal.\n\nDuring a recent family getaway to Sardinia, Project Runway host Klum, 39, was spotted getting close to Kristen, wrapping her arm around his neck and touching his back. When Seal, 49, arrived at an airport in the U.S. August 31, the \"Kiss From a Rose\" singer — who has been memorably aggressive towards the paparazzi in 2005, 2008 and 2012 — gave an impromptu interview when TMZ asked him to comment on Klum's rumored relationship with Kristen.\n\n\"Look boys, that's what happens when two people separate. They move on and that generally means [they have] other people in their lives,\" Seal ranted. \"I necessarily don't expect to Heidi to all of a sudden become a nun, but as always, my main priority is the emotional well being of our children.\"\n\nAfter separating in January, Klum filed for divorce in April; Seal filed his own paperwork shortly after. The two have continued to take turns co-parenting their children, Leni, 8, Henry, 6, Johan, 5, and Lou, 2.\n\n\"To be quite honest, if there is going to be somebody else in their lives, I'd much rather it was a familiar face. I guess the only thing I would have preferred is that. . . I guess I didn't expect any better from him, I would have preferred Heidi show a little bit more class and at least wait until we separated first before deciding to fornicate with the help, as it were,\" Seal told TMZ. \"But I guess you now all have the answer that you've been looking for for the past seven months.\"\n\nOn September 1, Klum's rep offered Us Weekly a statement on the German supermodel's behalf: \"It is sad that Seal has to resort to this kind of behavior and spread these untruths about the mother of his children.\n\nKlum hinted there was more to her split with Seal in an April interview with ELLE magazine. \"To the outside world, you don't really share all the things that happen. You kind of share just the most amazing sides,\" she explained. \"But I don't really want to get into any of that stuff. With my life, my family, my business — I want to go forward.\"\n\nSeal was the first to talk about their separation in January, as he had previously scheduled a series of talk show appearances to promote his latest album. At the time, he promised they wouldn't become the kind of high-profile exes who bash each other in the press. \"We're just not those kind of people — we never really have been,\" he said in an interview with PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley.\n\nBut according to a source, \"Seal is an incredibly angry person\" — and his recent rant isn't all that surprising. \"It's amazing. He's gone from hating the paparazzi and attacking them to giving interviews with them.\"\n\n\"Of course he's angry,\" a Seal insider counters. \"He believes his wife cheated and is now flaunting it.\""
