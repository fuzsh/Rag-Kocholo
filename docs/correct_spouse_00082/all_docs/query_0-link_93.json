        "text": "Heidi Klum and ex-husband Seal are very private when it comes to the lives of their kids. Sure, Leni Klum, 19, is a model, but their other children — Henry, 17, Johan, 16, and Lou, 13 — are still underage, and their parents tend to keep them off social media. But this week, the former Victoria’s Secret Angel and British singer both shared glimpses of their kids, and it’s so sweet to see.\n\nOver the weekend, Klum brought Lou and one of her sons to see Beyoncé’s Renaissance Tour. “@beyonce 🥳❤️🎉💃🏼 Happy Birthday 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳#renaissance,” she posted on Instagram.\n\nKlum wears a two-piece red outfit for the concert, and she poses for the first photo in between her two kids, who are facing away from the camera. Her son is in a white t-shirt and jeans and her daughter is wearing knee-high boots with a white-and-pink jacket.\n\nIn another post from the concert, the America’s Got Talent judge sings along to a Beyoncé song in one video, then leaves the show arm-in-arm with her son in other photos. It’s such a touching moment!\n\nLeni was absent from the concert, and a post from the “Stand By Me” singer shows why. Seal shared that he was visiting his daughter in New York. In a photo, Leni wears a white t-shirt with olive green pants as she hugs Seal, dressed in black shorts, a gray shirt, and a cream blazer.\n\n“In NY with the young woman who changed my life for the better 19yrs ago,” he captioned the post on Instagram. “Thank you Leni for making me a better person 🥹🥹🥹 Love you,-papa.” Aww!\n\nEarlier this year, Seal talked about his kids joining the entertainment industry on The Kelly Clarkson Show.\n\n“My son, Henry, he sings and he has a great voice,” Seal told host Kelly Clarkson. “He doesn’t think so, but he has a really great, husky voice, you know … If that’s what he wanted to do, it’s my job to just support him.”\n\n“It’s a tough one,” he continued. “Because obviously we’ve traveled that road and we know how difficult it can be. But, ultimately, my advice to them is just be happy. Do whatever.”\n\nHe added, “I really believe that is the point of it all. Is to try to figure out how to be as happy as possible.”"
