        "text": "According to researchers, an age difference that is bigger than 10 years increases the chances of divorce by 39%. Despite this fact, love doesn’t seem to care about age gaps, and many people have healthy and fulfilling relationships with partners considerably older or younger than them. One such example is supermodel Heidi Klum and her husband, Tom Kaulitz, who is more than 16 years her junior.\n\nWe at Bright Side always enjoy seeing how love blossoms, and that’s why we decided to learn more about Heidi and Tom’s story.\n\nHeidi was married twice before meeting Tom.\n\nBefore she became a household name and the first German Victoria’s Secret Angel, Heidi Klum had a serious relationship with hairstylist Ric Pipino. The 2 tied the knot in 1997, but they got divorced 5 years later. The supermodel then had a brief relationship with the Italian businessman, Flavio Briatore, and became pregnant with her daughter, Leni.\n\nThe 2 broke up soon after, and Heidi started dating the British singer, Seal, in 2004, who is 11 years older than her. Right after their first date, the German supermodel told the singer that she was pregnant. Seal was very supportive right from the beginning: “I had total clarity in a relationship and I knew exactly what I had to do,” he revealed later in an interview. He was present at Leni’s birth and later legally adopted her.\n\nHer split from Seal surprised everyone.\n\nAXELLE/BAUER-GRIFFIN.COM/East News\n\nThe couple got married a year after Leni’s birth and went on to welcome 3 more children together. Seal and Heidi spent 7 years as husband and wife, and they even held yearly vow renewal ceremonies. So when the 2 announced their split in 2012, it shocked everyone. The divorce was finalized in 2014 and the former lovebirds have continued to co-parent their 4 kids ever since.\n\nThird time’s the charm — meeting Tom Kaulitz\n\nROBYN BECK/AFP/East News\n\nBefore she met her future husband, Heidi Klum actually met his twin brother and fellow Tokyo Hotel member, Bill Kaulitz. The 2 worked together on Germany’s Next Top Model, but at this point, the supermodel didn’t even know that Bill had a twin. In 2018, they were eventually introduced by mutual friends, and they hit it off instantly.\n\n“Finally, I found the one,” Heidi said as she tied the knot again at 46.\n\nA few months later, Tom popped the big question to Heidi and the love birds went from strangers to newlyweds in less than a year. “I just know him so well. I just feel like, ’Finally, I found the one.’ So far so good. I hope it stays that way,” the model gushed in an interview about her new relationship.\n\nMaking an age gap relationship work\n\nWhile the couple never seemed to care about their age difference, some people were questioning whether Heidi’s relationship could last with someone more than 16 years younger than her. “My boyfriend is many years younger than me, and lots of people are questioning that and asking about it,” she explained back in 2018.\n\n“I don’t really think about it that much otherwise. You have to just live a happy life without worrying too much about what people think because worrying is only going to give you more wrinkles,” she went on to joke about the situation.\n\n“It’s the first time I feel like I really have a partner to do everything with.”\n\nDespite Tom being many years Heidi’s junior, the couple has been going strong ever since they got married in 2019. The Tokyo Hotel guitarist is also a great stepfather to Heidi’s 4 children. He even gave driving lessons to the supermodel’s 2 oldest children and is very happy to spend quality time with his bonus kids.\n\n“I mean, I found my match, finally. I am very romantic, and I do a lot of weird things, like I leave notes everywhere, and I do a lot of things for him, and it’s beautiful when you get that back from your partner,” Heidi Klum said about her husband in 2021. “And it’s the first time I feel like I really have a partner to do everything with.”\n\nHave you ever been in a relationship with a large age gap?
