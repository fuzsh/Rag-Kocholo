        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Heidi Klum moved to formally end her marriage Friday from singer Seal a little over two months after they separated.\n\nThe supermodel’s divorce filing in a Los Angeles court draws to a close a storybook romance that included numerous testaments to their affection for one another, including renewing their wedding vows annually and throwing elaborate Halloween costume parties.\n\nThe couple has four children together, including Klum’s daughter from a previous relationship. They had been married for more than six and a half years when they announced their separation in January, vowing to keep their breakup amicable.\n\nKlum’s filing, which she signed Thursday, cites irreconcilable differences. It provides no details about their split, other than that they entered into a financial agreement after they were married on how to divide their assets.\n\nThe model and star of the TV competition series “Project Runway” is asking for sole physical custody of the children, with Seal getting visitation and joint legal custody.\n\nThe Grammy-winning soul and R&B singer’s real name Henry Samuel. He released an album days after the couple announced their breakup and told talk show host Ellen DeGeneres that their split didn’t mean a total end to their relationship.\n\n“We will be connected in many ways `til the rest of our lives,” the singer said, “through our children and also through this tremendous admiration, respect and love that we have for each other.”"
