        "text": "They have one of the most glamorous and successful Hollywood relationships going. So Heidi Klum and Seal will take the gig on the road to counsel couples in need of love magic in a new \"Lifetime\" show.\n\nThe show is tentatively titled \"Love's Divine\" and will further expand Lifetime's \"Project Runway\" universe, according to Variety.com.\n\nOf course, it will be quite the experience for Mr. and Mrs. Normal American to receive love advice from the German model and the international singing sensation. As a guy, I might find it a little bit daunting to quibble about who holds the television remote control with the most romantic man ever in the universe. This goes beyond Seal's ability to croon sexy ballads well enough to make women swoon -- a clear major point.\n\nBut this is a man who fell in love with his wife while she was pregnant with another man's child and has raised the child as his own, proposed to Klum in a glacier he built in Canada and romantically renews his vows with Heidi every year. As far as real relationship romance goes, this guy walks a walk that not many can follow. Women are going to have their own challenges from a woman who has moved from the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition to successful mother and television business sensation (she executive produces \"Project Runway).\n\nOther than that, we're all ears for those relationship tips."
