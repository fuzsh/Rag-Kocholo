        "text": "Updated Tuesday April 11, 11.55am: Heidi Klum and Seal have each filed divorce papers, following news of their separation in January this year. The supermodel has asked for joint legal custody of their four children, while Seal has requested joint physical custody - meaning that the children would divide their time between both parents. The papers show that the couple signed a post-nuptial agreement, so no assets will be divided. Klum cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the split. Both parties have asked the judge to reject any spousal claims made.\n\nMEET THE WORLD'S RICHEST MODELS\n\n***Updated Wednesday January 25, 10.18am: *** For the second time in two days, Seal has given a heart-breaking interview about his spilt from supermodel Heidi Klum - revealing that the couple may reunite one day. The singer spoke to British television host Piers Morgan on his CNN Tonight show.\n\n\"Whether we get back together or not - it may happen, I can't speak for her,\" Seal said. \"Would I like it to? I don't know. I don't know at this point to be honest, Piers. I think, again, if it were that easy; if there weren't problems, we would still be together. That's the reality.\"\n\n\"Is it irreparable? You can never say never. I can't speak for my wife and I'm not going to sit here and BS you and say we haven't had problems. Of course we have had problems, otherwise why have we split up? But my love for her has not waned one iota. I love her with all my heart. How can you not somebody who you have just spent eight years with?\"\n\n\"This is not a charade. We have problems, we have issues, but to our credit we have always been able to talk about them, to confront them. To assume that any couple goes without arguing is just nonsense.\"\n\n\"I always used to say to my wife, the thing that I loved most about us is that we are a team, we are impenetrable in that respect. The outside influences can't get in because at the end of the day it doesn't matter what happens behind closed doors because - when we are out and about or when we have had disagreements even when we're in the house - I can look at you and say 'are you good?' when there are more important things to focus on.\"\n\nUpdated Tuesday January 24, 9.17am: Seal spoke for the first time yesterday about his impending divorce from supermodel Heidi Klum on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\n\"I think we were shocked,\" he confessed. \"You go into these things with the greatest intentions when you say 'I do' and you say 'til death do us part.' Those vows hold value. They are not just words...You try and you work through it, and the thing that you quickly realise when you are married and you become a parent, is that you do the best that you can. It makes you actually appreciate your parents a lot more. The thing that I'm most proud about this great woman who I married - and I really do mean that from the bottom of my heart - is that together she has given me four incredible gifts; four beautiful children. She is still, in my opinion, the most wonderful woman in the world. I think our priority was to remain civil and do this thing with dignity. We still very much love each other. To say that neither of us were grieving would be an out-and-out lie - and I don't mind telling you that. I think the operative here is that we are civil to each other and we both have a tremendous amount of respect and love and we try and do this with as much dignity as we possibly can.\"\n\nSeal also revealed that he intended to wear his wedding ring - which he wore when he renewed his vows with the supermodel every year on their anniversary - until he feels ready to remove it.\n\n\"Yes, I am still wearing my ring,\" he said. \"I think it's just pretty much a token of how I feel about this woman. We have eight years. Eight wonderful years together. Just because we have decided to separate doesn't necessarily mean you take off your ring and you're no longer connected to that person. We will be connected in many ways for the rest of our lives; though our children and also through this tremendous admiration, respect and love that we have for each other. Will we wear the ring for the rest of our lives? Who knows? But right now it feels really comfortable on my hand so I have no intention of taking it off anytime soon.\"\n\n***Updated Monday January 23, 9.12am: *** Heidi Klum and Seal are divorcing after eight years together. The supermodel and singer - whose seven-year marriage was thought to be one of the strongest in the public eye - confirmed the sad news this morning via a joint statement.\n\n\"While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate,\" the statement said. \"We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart. This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition. We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children's sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.\"\n\nThe couple have four children together: Leni, seven, who Klum gave birth to shortly after meeting Seal and who he later adopted; Henry, six; Johan, five; and Lou, two. The couple are said to be planning to file divorce papers at Los Angeles County Superior Court this week citing \"irreconcilable differences\".\n\nYOU SHOULD SEE: If Heidi is the world's top earning supermodel...\n\nYOU SHOULD SEE: The 2011 edition of Heidi and Seal's famous Halloween party..."
