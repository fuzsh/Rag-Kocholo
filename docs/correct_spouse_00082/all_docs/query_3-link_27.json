        "text": "Heidi Klum turned 50 in 2023, but she isn’t slowing down one bit — thanks to her much younger husband, Tom Kaulitz. The supermodel believes that their age-gap marriage came at the perfect time in her life, so she’s going to enjoy every minute of hitting the town with her musician spouse.\n\nIt’s a big shift in her life after moving to the U.S. in 1994 with a very “business-oriented” mindset as a young model from Germany who “wanted to succeed.” Klum told Fox News Digital that she “didn’t want to fail and go back with my suitcase.” The first stage of her life was completely career-focused. “I really wanted to follow my dream and I wanted to become a model. So, I did not go out,” she noted. “I really wanted to have a career, so I worked on that.” After establishing herself in the fashion industry, Klum’s life revolved around her young family with her ex-husband, Seal.\n\nThe former couple had three children, sons Henry, 18, and Johan, 17, and daughter Lou, 14. Seal also adopted Klum’s oldest daughter Leni, 19, from her relationship with Flavio Briatore. That season of life is almost at the end of its chapter, though. “Now they’re 19, 18, 17 and 14,” she shared. “So I feel like the days of me going to bed at 9:30 are kind of over.” Instead of heading home right after an event, Klum can go to the afterparty with Kaulitz because she doesn’t have tiny ones toddling around the house.\n\nThat’s why she appreciates Kaulitz’s energy — she gets to relive a part of her life that was shelved while she raised her family. “So I feel like with them all being older now, maybe it also has to do with my younger husband,” she continued. “I don’t know, but it’s just fun. It’s fun to go to a club. I enjoy music most of the time.” But she joked, “‘Am I the oldest person here?’ Then I feel really good when I look at Tiësto and I’m like, actually, Tiësto has five years on me, so I’m good.”\n\nKlum is thriving in her career, with her family, and in her marriage, but it different ways than a decade ago. She doesn’t have time for anyone who criticizes the age difference either. “You have to cut out all the noise around you. Not everyone is always cheering you on in all things that you do,” Klum told SheKnows in 2022. “But I feel like you’ve got to do what makes you happy. And he made me happy. And we’re still happy and having a great time together.”"
