        "text": "Canadian Press\n\nJanuary 5, 2005\n\nNEW YORK -- German supermodel Heidi Klum and singer Seal got engaged while visiting Whistler, B.C., over the holidays.\n\n\"We affianced on a glacier in Whistler (Canada). We reached this beautiful place by helicopter one day before Christmas Eve. It was a unique experience,\" said a posting on Klum's website.\n\nKlum, 31, and Seal, 41, started dating last year, shortly after her breakup with Renault Formula One team boss Flavio Briatore, who is the father of her daughter, Leni, born in May.\n\nKlum, who is a Victoria's Secret model and has appeared in Sports Illustrated magazine's swimsuit issue, separated from her husband of five years, celebrity hairstylist Ric Pipino, in November 2002.\n\nSeal's Love's Divine is nominated for a Grammy Award in the male pop vocal competition. His Kiss From a Rose won for record and song of the year, and he also grabbed the award for best male pop vocal performance at the Grammys in 1996\n\n\" Heidi Klum and SEAL engaged! The world is coming to en end! \"\n\nThat's what it said above a pic of them. I don't know why but that bothers me so much.\n\nSeal seems to be a very deep ( judging by his interviews ) a down to earth and a smart guy,on top of that very talented singer too. Seriously, what would you pick first, looks before personality/intelligence or the other way around, and why ?\n\nI'm so sick of barbie and ken relationships and think that Seal and Heidi makes a great couple !\n\nSeal seems to be a very deep ( judging by his interviews ) a down to earth and a smart guy,on top of that very talented singer too.\n\nI beg to differ. I think the man is fake, fake, fake. That's part of his fake persona he puts on the for the world. That being said, they go well together. She's exactly the type of woman that Seal likes.\n\ni think.....\n\nBonchic said:\n\nwow I am happy for them I love seal his voice is cool! Hey I am not being rude but do ya'll know what caused those scars on his face?\n\ni think it was some alergic reaction to sun...or something\n\ni could be totally wrong....\n\nanyway good for them....\n\ni think i heard somewhere that seal punched out one of his producers?? i dont think it was william orbit ..but maybe it was??? anyone?\n\nLolitaLuxe said:\n\ni think it was some alergic reaction to sun...or something\n\ni could be totally wrong....\n\nanyway good for them....\n\ni think i heard somewhere that seal punched out one of his producers?? i dont think it was william orbit ..but maybe it was??? anyone?\n\nI heard it was from a tribal ritual that was performed...But then I found out it was from lupus:\n\nhttp://www.irishhealth.com/?level=4&id=2265\n\nHo-Coture said:\n\nI beg to differ. I think the man is fake, fake, fake. That's part of his fake persona he puts on the for the world. That being said, they go well together. She's exactly the type of woman that Seal likes.\n\ndo you know the man personally? god\n\nI'm happy whenever two people find love and want to make a committment to be together forever BUT I do get anxious when celebrities make it 'officially known' through a publicists' statement. Jude and Sienna have done the same thing.\n\nThese people obviously aren't superstitious Celebrity marriages are dangerous enough ground as it is, taking into account the odds of it lasting, so why declare it so publicly? Keep it to yourselves and then do it privately!"
