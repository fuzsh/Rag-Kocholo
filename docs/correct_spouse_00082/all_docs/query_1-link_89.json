        "text": "Seal and Heidi Klum have called it quits.\n\nDespite earlier reports that the couple were not yet heading for a split, the singer and his supermodel wife released a joint statement confirming they are indeed separating.\n\n“While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate,” it read.\n\n“We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart. This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition. We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children’s sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.”\n\nOver the weekend, a source told People, “They’ve been fighting a lot lately, but they have no plans to announce a split right now.” Unfortunately, it looks as if that news is false.\n\nSeal, whose upcoming album Soul 2 was previewed exclusively on ESSENCE.com earlier this week, and Klum have three biological children together: Henry Günther, 6, Johan Riley, 5, and Lou, 2. The couple were married in May 2005 in Mexico.\n\nRecently, Seal did not accompany his wife to the 2012 Golden Globes as he has been promoting Soul 2 in New York and London. Soul 2 drops on January 24."
