        "text": "Heidi Klum's career has taken her far — she's the first German model to become a Victoria's Secret Angel, she's currently a judge on America's Got Talent and a former co-host on Amazon's Project Runway-esque show Making the Cut. But beyond her hosting and modeling gigs, Heidi's ambitions have also led to her marrying musician Tom Kaulitz.\n\nPer Us Weekly in 2018, Heidi, 51, was introduced to Tom, a 34-year-old guitarist of the German rock band Tokio Hotel, while she was hosting Germany's Next Top Model.\n\nRight away, the two discovered they shared a lot in common. Both Tom and Heidi had been married before — Heidi was married to celebrity hairstylist Ric Pipino between 1997-2002 and singer-songwriter Seal between 2004-2015; Tom was married to Ria Sommerfeld from 2015-2018, despite splitting up with her in 2016, per Women's Health. They also were both born in Germany.\n\n\"He's German [too], so it's been fun and easy for Heidi,\" a source told Us Weekly in 2018. \"Tom is a breath of fresh air for her. They fell into an easy rhythm really quickly.\"\n\nIt wasn't until around early 2018 that the two reportedly \"made their relationship official.\" Apparently, an appearance together at a West Hollywood party hosted by jewelry designer Lorraine Schwartz in mid-March of 2018 confirmed their relationship status. After that, the couple was spotted together while Heidi filmed season 13 of America's Got Talent and when the two took a romantic vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico later that same spring.\n\nThroughout the summer and fall of 2018, their love continued to be documented in front of red-carpet cameras as they and . Most notably, the duo dressed up as Princess Fiona and Shrek for Heidi's iconic Halloween bash in New York City.\n\nAt the time, Heidi gushed about her man to People, calling him \"absolutely wonderful.\"\n\n\"He is the kindest, sweetest, most caring, loving person. I feel so lucky. I don’t know the last time I was this happy in my life,\" she told the magazine. \"He is absolutely wonderful. Maybe it is because he is German and we understand each other in a different way. But so far so good.\"\n\nAfter about eight months of dating, Heidi announced on social media that she and Tom were engaged. \"I SAID YES ❤️,\" the AGT judge wrote in December 2018, alongside an up-close picture of the pair and her teal sapphire engagement ring. According to what a source told People, Tom sought a special blessing from Heidi's kids — daughters Leni and Lou, and sons Henry and Johan. (Leni's biological father is Italian businessman Flavio Briatore; she was adopted by Seal. Heidi welcomed Henry, Johan and Lou with Seal).\n\nOn February 22, 2019, Heidi and Tom made things official, despite details about their nuptials not coming out until July of that same year. Then, Vogue reported that the couple organized a second ceremony on the Christina O, a yacht belonging to Jackie Kennedy Onassis's second husband, Aristotle Onassis, in Capri, Italy on August 3, 2019.\n\nThroughout their relationship, Heidi has had to field questions about their 17-year age gap. She has made it perfectly clear that outsider opinions don't matter to her or Tom — they're happy to be together no matter what anyone else says.\n\n\"Lots of people are questioning that and asking about it,\" she told InStyle back in 2018. \"That’s really the only time when age seems to be shoved in my face and I have to give an answer for it.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I don’t really think about it that much otherwise. You have to just live a happy life without worrying too much about what people think because worrying is only going to give you more wrinkles.\"\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the couple enjoy displaying their love whenever they can in public. The two cozied up while on the red carpet at the Grammy Awards in February 2023, and they continue to showcase their romance on social media. Heidi most recently documented a couple's park day on Instagram in June 2024, posting a funny video moment captured of the couple.\n\nNo matter the time and place, Heidi and Tom's romance seems to be going strong. In a sweet photo she uploaded on Instagram, the two marked her birthday by sharing a romantic kiss.\n\n\"51 🤪❤️,\" she captioned the picture in June 2024.\n\nWe're seriously obsessed with them!"
