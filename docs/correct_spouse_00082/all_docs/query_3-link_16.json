I don’t know when I was this happy the last time in my life. I mean, I am with my children, but with, you know, a man. He’s absolutely wonderful. … He’s German, and we maybe understand each other in a different way. But so far, so good!”\n\nCredit: Courtesy Heidi Klum/Instagram\n\nAugust 2022\n\nThe two German natives walked hand-in-hand into the ocean in St. Barths to celebrate three years of marriage together.\n\n\"Happy 3 Year Anniversary my L❤️VE,\" Klum captioned the adorable video of the pair.\n\nCredit: Courtesy Heidi Klum/Instagram\n\nAugust 2022\n\nDuring a red carpet appearance for America's Got Talent season 17, Klum joked about how she gets her youthful glow.\n\n\"I suck [Tom's] young blood, is what I'm doing — like a vampire,\" the model quipped to E! News' Daily Pop about her beau, who is 17 years her junior.\n\nThe TV star also reflected on their romance to the outlet, saying how the years felt like they \"flew by\" already. \"I just know him so well. We just gel really well. I just feel like, 'Finally, I found The One.' So far so good. I hope it stays that way.\"\n\nCredit: Stephen Lovekin/Shutterstock\n\nOctober 2022\n\n“She just came up with the worm. She's like that. She gets up in the morning and she's like, 'I'm gonna be a worm,' and I'm like ‘OK. … I’m running out of options. What can you do with a worm?’ It’s either going to be a fisherman or a gardener or something like that so I decided on a fisherman and now I'm part of the costume. I have on my hook so that's kind of fun.”\n\nHe added that putting together the outfits take “hours and hours,” noting that Klum started getting ready at 9 a.m.\n\nWhen asked whether he felt bad for his spouse as she struggled up and down the carpet, Kaulitz told Us: “Not really because it was her choice. She came up with it. I'm like, ‘Now you gotta push through.’”"
