        "text": "Supermodel Heidi Klum and British singer Seal confirmed Sunday that they are splitting up after seven years of marriage.\n\nThe celebrity couple told People magazine’s website that while they continued to love each other they had simply “grown apart.”\n\n“While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate,” a statement said.\n\n“We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart. This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.\n\n“We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children’s sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.”\n\nNews of the impending split first surfaced Saturday, with entertainment website TMZ reporting that Klum, the former “Head Angel” for Victoria’s Secret, would cite “irreconcilable differences” when she files divorce papers in Los Angeles, possibly as early as next week.\n\nGerman Klum, 38, and 48-year-old Seal, whose full name is Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Adeola Samuel, married in Mexico in 2005 after having met the previous year. They are known for their lavish ceremonies where they renew their wedding vows on their anniversary every year.\n\nThey have three children together — Henry, 6, Johan, 5, and Lou, 2. Seal also adopted Klum’s seven-year-old daughter Leni from her previous relationship with Italian businessman and Formula One entrepreneur Flavio Briatore.\n\nThe couple was last seen together on Dec. 27, when Klum, the “Project Runway” host, tweeted a photo of them in Aspen, Colo. Klum attended the Golden Globe Awards without her husband on Jan. 15.\n\nSeal, who is known for his songs “Kiss From A Rose” and “Crazy,” will soon fly Down Under where he will serve as a coach on the Australian version of the singing competition TV show, “The Voice.”\n\nThe other coaches will be Good Charlotte singer Joel Madden, country star Keith Urban and Australian singer Delta Goodrem."
