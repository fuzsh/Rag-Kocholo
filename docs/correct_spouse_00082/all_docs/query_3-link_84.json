        "text": "Heidi Klum and husband Tom Kaulitz's 16 year age difference might have made headlines in the past, but in more recent news, the couple has gained the spotlight for Klum gushing about just how perfect Kaulitz is.\n\n“I’m just a much happier person,” the supermodel and former 'America's Got Talent' judge told People ahead of Monday's season 2 premiere of 'America's Got Talent: The Champions'. She added: “For the first time, I have a partner who I can discuss everything with. Someone who shares duties that we all have in our life. I used to be on my own with everything. For the first time, I get to experience what it is actually like to have a partner.”\n\nAs the 46-year old went on about her 30-year-old beau of two years, it's worth noting that this wasn't the first time Klum took the opportunity to gush about Kaulitz. Back in September 2018, she had also told the same outlet how Kaulitz \"is the kindest, sweetest, most caring, loving person. I feel so lucky. I don’t know the last time I was this happy in my life,” she said. “He is absolutely wonderful. Maybe it is because he is German and we understand each other in a different way. But so far so good.”\n\nAnd this makes us all the more curious about the curious charms of Kaulitz, specifically - who is he? Worry not, we've got all the answers here.\n\nKaulitz is a guitarist, singer-songwriter and keyboard player in the band Tokio Hotel. The rock group formed back in 2001 and has since scored two albums in the top 15 on Billboard’s alternative albums chart. While this makes Kaulitz famous on his own and not just a Mr. Heidi Klum, he also shares his band-fame with his twin brother Bill, who is the lead vocalist of the band. Other members include bassist Georg Listing and drummer Gustav Schäfer.\n\nWhile Klum has addressed their common nationality, the two also have a lot more in common. Apart from originally being from Germany, both Klum and Kaulitz have been previously married. Klum was married to celebrity hairstylist Ric Pipino from 1997 to 2002 and singer Seal from 2005 to 2014, sharing four children with the latter. As for Kaulitz, he was married to Ria Sommerfeld before splitting in 2016. Klum started secretly seeing Kaulitz roughly since March 2018, and the coming Christmas Eve, the couple got engaged before tying the knot in July 2019.\n\nKaulitz was introduced to Heidi by a mutual friend who worked on Germany’s Next Top Model, which Klum hosted from 2006-2017. Despite their striking age gap, with Kaulitz being 16 years younger, Klum tries not to think too much about it. “Lately, I’m being reminded more about my age by people other than myself,” Heidi told InStyle. “My boyfriend is many years younger than me, and lots of people are questioning that and asking about it. That’s really the only time when age seems to be shoved in my face and I have to give an answer for it,” she said. Heidi is taking the comments in her stride though. “I don’t really think about it that much otherwise. You have to just live a happy life without worrying too much about what people think because worrying is only going to give you more wrinkles,” she said."
