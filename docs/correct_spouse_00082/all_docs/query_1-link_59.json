        "text": "Originally appeared on E! Online\n\nHeidi Klum's cozy pic is making the cut.\n\nThe supermodel shared a sweet photo to social media, showcasing herself and husband Tom Kaulitz, alongside her and ex-husband Seal's four kids: Leni, 19, Henry, 18, Johan, 17, and Lou, 14.\n\nThe bunch kept it casual in sweats as they cuddled on the couch. In the snap, Klum leaned in to give Leni a kiss on the cheek while keeping one arm draped around her daughter Lou, who was sleeping on her lap.\n\nHenry and Johan posed with their heads looking down as they sat next to Kaulitz, who smiled into the camera.\n\nKlum captioned the Nov. 26 Instagram post, \"L [heart emoji] VE.\"\n\nEntertainment News\n\nAnd although the \"America's Got Talent\" judge usually keeps her family photos private, Klum has shared some details on her kidsâ€”like how she feels about her oldest following in her footsteps as a model.\n\nHeidi Klum's Best Looks\n\n\"I was not nervous,\" she told E! News in October. \"I can't say I was excited either because, you know, when you're self-employed, it is always tricky.\"\n\nHowever, Klum added that Leni has other interests besides hitting the runway.\n\n\"Who knows if this is something she'll always even want to do forever,\" she explained. \"She's studying because she wants to do interior design, and she's doing this right now. She's only 19 years old, you know? So, who knows what all the things are that she will do.\"\n\nSeal has also weighed in on his daughter's bourgeoning modeling career."
