        "text": "If you follow Heidi Klum on Instagram, you’ve probably noticed that the supermodel and former America’s Got Talent judge has a new boo in her life, musician Tom Kaulitz, and she loves to show him off.\n\nWell, apparently she decided he was for keeps, because US Weekly just confirmed that the pair secretly obtained a marriage license and got married.\n\nHeidi's been seeing Tom since roughly March 2018, and the couple got engaged on Christmas Eve.\n\nBut, uh, who is Heidi Klum's new husband Tom Kautliz, exactly? Allow me to explain.\n\nTom is a guitarist, singer-songwriter and keyboard player in the band Tokio Hotel.\n\nThe rock band formed in 2001, and has had two albums in the top 15 on Billboard’s alternative albums chart, making Tom famous in his own right. He plays in Tokio Hotel with his twin brother Bill, who is the lead vocalist, bassist Georg Listing, and drummer Gustav Schäfer. You can see Heidi with Tom and his brother below.\n\nThe two have a lot in common.\n\nBoth Heidi and Tom are originally from Germany, and both have previously been married. Tom was married to Ria Sommerfeld, who he split from in 2016, and Heidi was formerly married to hairstylist Ric Pipino and British singer Seal, according to Ranker. Heidi has four children (three with Seal and one with Italian businessman Flavio Briatore).\n\nThey met through a mutual friend.\n\nHeidi, who hosted Project Runway for years, also hosted Germany’s Next Top Model from 2006-2017. She and Tom share a friend who works on the show, and they introduced the pair, according to Us Weekly.\n\nShe’s opened up about their age gap.\n\nHeidi and Tom have a 16-year age difference (she’s 45 and he’s 29). They don’t seem to have any issue with it, but it’s something that other people have brought up. “Lately, I’m being reminded more about my age by people other than myself,” Heidi told InStyle. “My boyfriend is many years younger than me, and lots of people are questioning that and asking about it. That’s really the only time when age seems to be shoved in my face and I have to give an answer for it,” she said.\n\nHeidi is taking the comments in stride though. “I don’t really think about it that much otherwise. You have to just live a happy life without worrying too much about what people think because worrying is only going to give you more wrinkles,” she said.\n\nHe went all out for Heidi’s iconic Halloween party.\n\nHeidi is known for her epic Halloween costume party that she hosts every year, and this October, Tom got in on the dress-up action with her. The two attended as Shrek and Fiona, and the transformation process from hot couple to giant green ogres was mind-blowing. Tom and Heidi sat through hours of hair, makeup and prosthetic application, and Heidi documented the whole thing on her Instagram.\n\nDespite barely being able to move his face once the costume was complete, Tom was a good sport about it. And the final look was surreal.\n\nTheir Insta pics are super steamy.\n\nHeidi has no qualms about sharing sexy pics, and she’s brought Tom in on the action. Heidi regularly posts photos and videos of the two cuddling in bed and kissing.\n\nThe pair recently traveled to Hong Kong, and Heidi shared a series of photos that Tom snapped. In the first image, she’s standing in their hotel room topless, looking out over the city. In nothing but a pair of cheeky black panties, Heidi looks fierce as always. She captioned the photo, “JETLAG.”\n\nBut Tom has never posted to his own Instagram.\n\nApparently Heidi's the social media user in this marriage. The Instagram account that Heidi's tagged Tom in a few times has precisely zero posts. Guess her new hubby is a pretty private guy.\n\nApparently Tom's got a strong bond with Heidi's kids.\n\nWhen asked by US Weekly whether Tom got along with her children, Leni, Henry, Johan, and Lou, Heidi replied, \"Yeah, they do!\"\n\nThe two seem to be smitten with each other, and fans are here for their PDA. #Relationshipgoals, anyone?"
