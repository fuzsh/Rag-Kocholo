        "text": "Forget the golden buzzer. When it comes to Seal‘s appearance on tonight’s episode of America’s Got Talent, fans are more invested in his breakup with Heidi Klum. The “Kiss From a Rose” singer is a guest judge on the talent competition and all eyes are on his interactions with his famous ex.\n\nSeal (real name: Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Adeola Samuel) was married to the former Victoria’s Secret model from 2002 to 2012, and they share kids Henry, 11, Johan, 10, and Lou, 7, together, along with Heidi’s 13-year-old daughter Leni from a previous relationship. Fans were shocked when the pair announced their divorce five years ago, especially given their yearly vow renewals.\n\nMORE: Heidi Klum Goes Topless —and Proves She’s Still Got it!\n\nAt the time of the split, Heidi, 44, reportedly blamed Seal’s temper for the divorce filing. According to TMZ, “Seal’s inability to control his anger has become too much for Heidi to take, in no small part because it’s affecting their children.” While there was no infidelity, she did also grow tired of his hard partying ways.\n\nAs the years passed, more has surfaced about the end of their 10-year relationship, with Heidi opening up his busy schedule. “He was never your typical dad who left for work in the morning with his briefcase and would be home by dinner time every night. He traveled a lot. The kids knew it was part of his job,” she told Redbook. “I’m a mom and a dad at the same time.”\n\nMORE: Heidi Klum’s Boyfriend Vito Schnabel Claims He Didn’t Cheat on Her — But We Don’t Buy It!\n\nHowever, Heidi made it very clear she was not insulting Seal’s parenting skills, responding to the backlash by saying, “It is frustrating to me that some other media outlets are taking what was said in the article to suggest that I was aiming to malign my children’s father. Because I was not!”\n\nShe continued, “As a single parent, you have so many roles – you are wearing all the hats. The mom hat, the dad hat, the chef hat, the teacher hat, the disciplinarian hat, the clown hat, and the work hat. You have your hands full, but you just try your best because it’s all about raising happy and healthy kids. That’s all we both want.”\n\nToday, Seal and Heidi are clearly in a much better place. Heidi is linked to 31-year-old art dealer Vito Schnabel while Seal, 54, is currently a coach on The Voice Australia."
