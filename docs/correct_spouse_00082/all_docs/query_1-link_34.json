        "text": "Seal and Heidi Klum have confirmed they are separating after nearly seven years of marriage.\n\nThe British musician and German supermodel said they had decided to separate after \"much soul-searching\", blaming the break-up on \"growing apart\".\n\nThey have appealed for privacy and stressed the split is \"amicable\".\n\nThe couple, who married in 2005, have three children together, and regard Klum's daughter from a previous relationship as their fourth.\n\nThe pair famously renewed their vows on every wedding anniversary.\n\nThey said: \"We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart.\n\n\"This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.\n\n\"We thank our family, friends and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children's sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.\"\n\nThe Kiss From A Rose singer, had previously described his wife, who has a tattoo of his name on her arm, as his best friend.\n\nThe couple first got together in 2004 when Klum was pregnant with her daughter Leni, who was fathered by Italian businessman Flavio Briatore.\n\nSeal, 48, and Klum, 38, got married on a beach in Mexico in May 2005, shortly after announcing she was pregnant with their son Henry.\n\nThey also have another son, Johan, and a daughter called Lou.\n\nGrammy award-winning Seal has recently been promoting his latest album, Soul 2. Last week he performed on the Jonathan Ross Show.\n\nKlum became well known modelling lingerie for Victoria's Secret, and in 2010 was ranked higher than the Queen in a Forbes list of the world's most powerful women.\n\nShe is the current host of the US reality fashion show, Project Runway.\n\nThe pair would often dress up in elaborate fancy dress costumes for Halloween."
