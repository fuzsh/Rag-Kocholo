        "text": "Heidi Klum is officially a married woman—again!\n\nThe former Project Runway host recently tied the knot with husband Tom Kaulitz a second time during a luxury boat wedding in Capri, Italy.\n\nThough they haven’t been together for long, Heidi Klum and Tom Kaulitz couldn’t be happier that are now husband and wife.\n\nWhile we are happy the former Victoria’s Secret Model has found love again, we can’t help but wonder how she and Kaulitz came to cross paths?\n\nKlum and Kaulitz held a second wedding a few months after their first\n\nIt looks like Heidi Klum has another wedding added to the books for her.\n\nThe model and television personality married her boyfriend of one year, Tom Kaulitz, who is the guitarist of German rock band Tokio Hotel, in a lavish ceremony aboard a huge yacht, according to Us Weekly.\n\nThis marks the second time the couple has tied the knot, the first being secretly in an ultra private ceremony where they obtained a marriage license.\n\nThough they already wed, the couple wanted to celebrate their nuptials with friends and family in attendance.\n\nTom Kaulitz wore a white suit and blue shirt while Klum was dressed in a beautiful off-the-shoulder white gown with embroidered detailing.\n\nKaulitz’s twin brother, Bill, who is the lead singer of Tokio Hotel, officiated the wedding that took place aboard the Christina O., which previously belonged to Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis.\n\nThough the couple has yet to share why they decided to have a second wedding, many of us can easily assume that they wanted to exchange nuptials while surrounded by close family and friends.\n\nThe couple fell hard for each other when they first met\n\nThough many of us couldn’t be happier for Heidi Klum and her recent marriage, others can’t help but wonder how the model and Tom Kaulitz came to be the couple they are today.\n\nAccording to sources, Klum and Kaulitz met through Germany’s Next Top Model (which is currently hosted by the Heidi) back in February 2018 and their connection came easily due to their shared nationality.\n\nEven though the couple is 16 years apart, Klum is 46 while Kaulitz is 29, the pair fell hard for each other the moment they met.\n\n“Heidi and Tom met through Germany’s Next Top Model. There was some connection through the show,” an insider told Us Weekly. “He’s German [too], so it’s been fun and easy for Heidi. Tom is a breath of fresh air for her. They fell into an easy rhythm really quickly.”\n\nA month after meeting, the couple made their relationship official shortly before attending a party hosted by jewelry designer Lorraine Schwartz in West Hollywood.\n\nAfter that, Klum and Kaulitz were spotted on multiple occasions packing on the PDA in public and even showcasing their love on social media.\n\nFrom their shared photos on Heidi Klum’s Instagram, the couple couldn’t be happier with each other and look to have found their happily ever after in each other.\n\nAfter dating for a few short months, they announced their engagement on Christmas Eve, with Klum sharing a black-and-white photo on Instagram with her new fiancé, showing off her ring. “I SAID YES,” the model captioned the photo.\n\nAs you can see, the rest is history and now, Heidi Klum and Tom Kaulitz can continue enjoying the married life.\n\nCongratulations to the happy couple."
