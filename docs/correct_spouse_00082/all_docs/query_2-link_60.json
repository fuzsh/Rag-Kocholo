        "text": "My childhood was fractured. It was filled with violence and abuse and a complete and utter lack of love. I became a kid who lived in his head because I had to create an alternative reality for myself. I was given up from birth so spent the first four years with my foster family, and they laid the groundwork for how I turned out. I was plucked out of that safe environment when I was five but because I was loved for the formative years of my life, I knew that when my father flogged the living daylights out of me, he was acting outside of himself. I don't blame him though. He's shown me what not to become.\n\nMy mother and my stepmother had a very big influence on me. My mum was a wig-maker and would listen to the radio while she worked, so I feel that songs by everyone from Burt Bacharach to the Supremes are part of my DNA. My stepmother was a big James Brown and Otis Redding fan, and I remember 'It's A Man's World' very clearly.\n\nIt would be untrue of me to say I didn't play the part of a rock star when I was single, but what else are you going to do? The first thing you have to realise is that the whole concept of fame is absurd. Problems arise when your fame carries you away. The trick is to maintain your identity.\n\nBoth men and women go through all kinds of disillusion. I think allowing yourself to be vulnerable is one of the most liberating things. One cannot love unconditionally until you surrender because with that comes a deep trust. Being fearful is my biggest fear and is the cause of so many problems.\n\nI got married at 41 [to supermodel Heidi Klum], which is a long time to wait in some peoples' eyes. But I was fortunate in that I could wait and make what I felt was the right choice. If I'd met Heidi in my 30s, we'd have got on but I don't know if I'd been a particularly good husband or parent. I'm better equipped to deal with the demands of matrimony and parenting at this stage in my life. Heidi's 10 years younger than me but is very mature. I definitely think women mature quicker than men.\n\nYou have to recognise your soulmate and seize the opportunity. I'm really proud my wife displayed such courage when we met. She's a strong woman and I like that. If you look at the situation for what it was; Heidi was 30, a high fashion model and celebrity, and although she didn't know it at the time, was three weeks pregnant by someone else. I was 40 and in a profession not known for its fidelity or being responsible. I wasn't looking to be in a relationship. But we saw something in each other and that recognition transcended everything else. We were in a seemingly complex situation but we both had such clarity.\n\nHeidi's a huge role model for me. I learn a lot from her and I think that's an important key in relationships. Some say I'm more stylish now, and it certainly has its advantages being married to the host of Project Runway. She's got me into healthier food; I eat greens now. She's one of those people who can take just one piece of chocolate. I can't!\n\nHer ability not to take anything too seriously has rubbed off on me too. Her willingness to be fun and childlike is what facilitates the romance in our relationship. She's taught me you need focus, and that's why she organises things like us getting married every year. We do it at our home in Mexico where we first married three and a half years ago and we have a big fancy dress party where everyone jumps in the pool at the end. We repeat our vows every year. It's a reminder of the fact you can't take anything for granted."
