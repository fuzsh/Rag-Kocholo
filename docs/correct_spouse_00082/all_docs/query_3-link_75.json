Is there a lunatic out there?\"\n\nThe two questioned if the dogs had been poisoned.\n\nBill explained that his 4-year-old bulldog has never had any health issues.\n\n\"He was never sick, never had to go to the doctor,\" the German singer-songwriter explained. \"And then, one Sunday, he suddenly collapsed and fell over. I was in shock.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nTom honored his dog Anton in an Instagram post after his death.\n\n\"I will never understand why life took you from me so early, so unexpectedly, so sudden, only days after we lost our Capper, when you were only 4 years old and we both still had so many plans together,\" he wrote. \"My heart is broken and miss you more than words could ever say.\"\n\n\"Thank u for being my home, my fearless and strong protector, for making me laugh and feel joy ever day [sic] looking at your little face,\" he continued. \"I love u so much and will keep u in my heart forever!\"\n\nThe supermodel shared a tribute on Instagram to the couple's dog Capper.\n\n\"Forever Loved Forever in our hearts,\" Klum wrote.\n\nShe later shared a series of photos of a day spent in Palm Springs with Tom and their dog Anton.\n\n\"Such a beautiful Day Today,\" she captioned the photos. \"We did not know it would be our last.\""
