        "text": "Heidi Klum has admitted to dating her bodyguard Martin Kristen for the first time.\n\nThe model made the revelation for the first time during a television interview with Katie Couric, though she stopped short of calling the romance a \"relationship\".\n\nShe told Couric that the fling had \"just started,\" after the host asked whether she was in a \"proper relationship\".\n\nKlum said: \"I don't even know if I can call it that. I don't know.\"\n\nShe then discussed her friendship with the bodyguard, whom she has known for four years.\n\n\"He's been with our family for the last four years,\" she said. \"He's cared for our entire family, mostly for our four children, helped us tremendously.\n\n\"I trust him with my children's life. He's a great man, you know, and we just got to know each other from a completely different side.\"\n\nCouric also addressed Seal's comments that Klum had been having an affair with Kristen while they were still married.\n\nShe said: \"He accused you of quote, 'fornicating with the help', implying you were having an affair with your bodyguard while you were married.\n\n\"He then clarified the comment and said \"before your divorce was final. But what did you think about his comments, how he said them, because a lot of people were put off by his choice of words?\"\n\nHeidi replied: \"Yes, he has a very unique choice of words. I'm used to them. I don't know. I don't love that. Obviously, it's not true. I've never looked at another man while I was with him.\n\n\"And it's hard when you think that he thinks that, you don't know... He was hurt...\"\n\nAccording to Klum, both have moved on since announcing their split back in January this year, although the increased media scrutiny has put pressure on her new relationship.\n\n\"He's moved on,\" she said. \"When we separated he's moved on and so have I. And it's very hard when you start seeing somebody again, you know. All of a sudden. It's hard then when everyone is watching you. It's almost like you can't have a real proper chance in a way.\n\n\"And I do want to date again. I'm turning 40. I don't even know where it's going to go.\"\n\nSOURCE: KATIE TV\n\nOn 3 September 2012, we wrote...\n\nSeal's reps have hit back at reports that the singer accused his estranged wife Heidi Klum of cheating on him. Speaking to Us Weekly yesterday, Seal's publicist said that the singer's words were misconstrued.\n\n\"Seal would like to clarify that he was not implying his wife was cheating while they were together, but he was merely pointing out that their separation and divorce were not final and they are still legally married,\" he said.\n\nReports of the alleged infidelity first surfaced when TMZ asked the British star to comment following pictures of the German model and the former couple's four children holidaying in Sardinia with Klum's rumoured new beau and bodyguard of four years, Martin Kristen. Speaking to TMZ, the Kiss From A Rose hitmaker said: \"I would have preferred Heidi show a little bit more class and at least wait until we separated first before deciding to fornicate with the help, as it were... But I guess you now all have the answer that you've been looking for for the past seven months.\" However, a spokesperson for Klum was quick to slam the claims on Saturday, saying: \"It is sad that Seal has to resort to this kind of behavior and spread these untruths about the mother of his children.\" According to US Weekly, a source has revealed that Seal has been reeling since the run-in.\n\n\"These guys bombarded him and were in his face. He was exhausted, which is why he wants to clarify what he said... He doesn't like now being made into the bad guy here - he always loved and cared for Heidi,\" they claimed.\n\nNews of the couple's public spat comes after the two announced their shock split in January this year, before both filing for divorce in April.\n\nCELEBRITY HOOK-UPS & BREAK-UPS OF 2011\n\nCELEBRITY TATTOOS\n\nMODELS TURNED MOGELS\n\nSOURCE: TMZ, US WEEKLY\n\nOn 9 March 2012, we wrote...Heidi Klum has finally opened up about the demise of her marriage to Seal. The German model, who thus far has remained tight-lipped about the split, likened it to a tornado. Klum said: \"I feel like I'm in the eye of the tornado. It's emotions inside of your body that are a tornado. And then the outside world doing all this craziness - with you wanting it or not wanting it - is another tornado.\" \"But as hard as it is, so is life. And sometimes I think a curve-ball just comes at you. Instead of something straight that you catch, it hits you in the head from the side that you didn't expect,\" she added. The Project Runway host, also admitted that while their seven-year marriage had seemed like a fairytale romance, it was rife with problems that they tried to keep secret. \"To the outside world, you don't really share all the things that happen. You kind of share just the most amazing sides. But I don't really want to get into any of that stuff. With my life, my family, my business - I want to go forward.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I feel like already there are so many things being said about us - about him, about me. I'm not going to comment... Otherwise it makes you angry. You can't always call and say, 'This is not true, but this part is true.'\" The 38-year-old also touched on her feelings about how her estranged husband dealt with their break-up in the public eye immediately following the announcement of their split. \"He's a grown man. I can't tell him what to do and what not to do. It's hard... People don't need to know who did what. I don't want to talk positively or negatively about the ups and downs that we had... Every couple goes through things. Unfortunately, we're in the public, so the highs are out there.\" The model, who describes herself as a \"lioness\" in the interview, also spoke about the importance of protecting her four children but also said that the break-up had caused an endless amount of pain, adding that she wasn't \"a robot\".\n\nCELEBRITY HOOK-UPS & BREAK-UPS OF 2011 2011 - A YEAR IN CELEBRITY TWEETS\n\nCELEBRITY TATTOOS\n\nMODELS TURNED MOGELS\n\nSOURCE: DAILY MAIL\n\nOn 24 January 2012, we wrote...Seal has opened up for the first time about his split from wife of eight years, Heidi Klum.\n\nThe singer appeared on two chat shows yesterday in order to promote his forthcoming album - and discussing the topic of the separation was not off limits.\n\nSpeaking to Ellen DeGeneres on Ellen, he said: \"I think we were shocked. You go into these things with the greatest intentions when you say 'I do' and you say 'Till death do us part.' Those vows hold value. They are not just words. These things happen. We pretty much said how we feel and made it clear in the release statement.\n\n\"But, for intents and purposes of this show, you just grow apart after awhile. You try and you work through it and the thing that you quickly realize when you are married and you become a parent is you do the best that you can. It makes you actually appreciate your parents a lot more. The thing that I'm most proud about this great woman who married - and I really do mean that from the bottom of my heart - is that together she has given me four incredible gifts… Four beautiful children.\n\n\"She is still, in my opinion, the most wonderful woman in the world. I think our priority was to remain civil and do this thing with dignity. We still very much love each other. It's not a question of we were never to follow suit of some break-up or separations that you hear about, especially in our industry. It's a shame. To say that neither of us were grieving would be an out and out lie, and I don't mind telling you that. I think the operative here is that we are civil to each other and we both have a tremendous amount of respect and love and we try and do this with as much dignity as we possibly can. And of course, when you have four children, you hope and pray that the rest of the world will respect that we have four children and that their little hearts are at stake, too.[sic]\"\n\nExplaining why he is still wearing his wedding ring, despite the couple's imminent divorce, he said: \"I think it's just pretty much a token of how I feel about this woman. We have eight years. Eight wonderful years together. Just because we have decided to separate doesn't necessarily mean you take off your ring and you're no longer connected to that person.\n\n\"We will be connected in many ways till the rest of our lives… Through our children and also through this tremendous admiration, respect and love that we have for each other. Will we wear the ring for the rest of our lives? Who knows? But right now it feels really comfortable on my hand, so I have intentions of taking it off anytime soon.\"\n\nSeal also appeared on The Travis Smiley Show yesterday, and reiterated that there was no bad blood between the couple.\n\n\"We're just not those kind of people - we never really have been,\" he explained. \"We've never been attracted to [negativity]. Of course it's a difficult situation that we have to handle right now and it's never easy. In terms of our love and respect for each other, that hasn't changed at all. \"Just because you decide to separate, I don't think you all of [a] sudden stop loving each other. I don't think you all of [a] sudden stop becoming friends.\""
