Heidi Klum is officially back on the market ... her divorce from Seal became final Tuesday ... and TMZ has learned they've made a clean break ... no problems splitting property and NO spousal support.

Sources close to the pair tell us ... they did not have a prenup, but signed a postnup at some point during their marriage, keeping much of their earnings separate. We're told there were no big fights over money, and they reached a property settlement agreement months ago.

Our sources say neither Heidi nor Seal will get spousal support ... they're both well off -- she more than he.

They've also worked out a confidential arrangement for custody of their 4 kids.

As we reported, Heidi filed for divorce in April 2012. It started out rocky ... as we reported, Heidi split from Seal because she claimed he had an out-of-control temper that scared her and the kids.

The one thing Heidi demanded and got -- her name back. She's Heidi Klum again.

Heidi's single status may be in jeopardy ... the 41-year-old has been linked to 28-year-old art dealer Vito Schnabel.
