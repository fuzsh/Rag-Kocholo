Heidi Klum’s request to take on the last name of her husband, Seal, was officially approved Friday, People magazine reports. The “Project Runway” host filed paperwork in October to legally change her name, citing “marriage” as the reason for the change. Klum’s move to adopt her hubby’s last name, whose full name is Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Adeola Samuel, comes four years after the couple wed on a beach in Mexico. The 36-year-old model gave birth to her fourth child, daughter Lou, last month. Klum also has daughter Leni, 5 (with ex Flavio Briatore), and two sons, Henry, 3, and Johan, 2, with Seal.
