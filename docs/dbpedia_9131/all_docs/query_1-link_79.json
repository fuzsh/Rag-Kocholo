        "text": "Description\n\nThe franc is the official currency of Burundi since 1960 when it replaced the Belgian Congo franc. In 1964, the Banque d’Emission du Rwanda et du Burundi (Issuing Bank of Rwanda and Burundi) started to issue notes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 francs, followed by 5,000 francs in 1966. The 10 francs note were replaced by coin and the 2,000 francs issued in 2001 followed by 10,000 francs in 2004. In 2015 a new banknotes series were published, but the 10, 20 and 50 franc banknotes have lost their legal tender. The 100 franc banknote is the only banknote of the old series in circulation.\n\nThe 500 Burundian francs note front design features a coffee tree, a Nile crocodile, a sketch of a sleek late fish, a sketch of a cattle head, the National Coat of Arms and the National Flag. The lettering on this side of the note is in the Kinyarwanda language. The reverse of the note illustrates a sketch of the map of Burundi containing a scene from Lake Tanganyika with a boat, a sketch of a sleek late fish and the initial of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi (Banque de la République du Burundi). The lettering on this side of the note is in the French language. This note is part of the 2015 – 2018 series, and its color is orange, yellow and pink."
