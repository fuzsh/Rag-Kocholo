        "text": "Currency\n\nFranc is the currency of Burundi. It is nominally subdivided into 100 cents, although no coins were issued in centimeters, Burundi began issuing its own currency. Only in the period when Burundi used the Belgian Congo franc were issued coins.\n\nHistory\n\nThe franc became the Burundi coin in 1916, when Belgium occupied the former German colony and replaced the East African German rupee with the Belgian Congo franc. Burundi used the Belgian Congo currency until 1960, when the Rwanda and Burundi francs were introduced. Burundi began issuing its own franc in 1964.\n\nThere are plans to introduce a common currency, a new shilling of East Africa, for the five East African Community states by the end of 2015.\n\nCoins\n\nIn 1965, the Bank of the Kingdom of Burundi issued the 1-franc brass coins. In 1968, the Bank of Burundi took over the issue of coins and introduced aluminum of 1 and 5 francs and 10 francs of cupro-nickel. The 5 and 10 francs continued to be crushed at the edges. Secondly, coin types of 1 and 5 francs were introduced in 1976, offering the coat of arms. In 2011 new coins of 10 and 50 francs were introduced.\n\nBanknotes\n\nFrom February 1964 to December 31, 1965, banknotes issued by Banque du Rwanda and Burundi (issued by the Bank of Rwanda and Burundi) in coupons of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 francs were overprinted with An empty diagonal \"BURUNDI\" for use in the country. These were followed in 1964 and 1965 by regular issues in the same denominations of the Banque du Royaume du Burundi (Bank of the Kingdom of Burundi).\n\nIn 1966, banknotes of 20 francs and more were printed in excess by the Bank of Burundi, replacing the word \"Kingdom\" with \"Republic\". The usual emissions of this bank were in 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1,000 and 5,000 francs. 10 francs were replaced by coins in 1968. 2000 francs were introduced in 2001, followed by 10,000 francs in 2004. The photograph of Kelly Fajack representing school children in Burundi was used on the back of the banknote 10,000 francs Burundi."
