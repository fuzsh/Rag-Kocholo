        "text": "The Kingdom of Burundi is a sovereign state in Africa that was established in the aftermath of Republic of Burundi's victory in the Congo War in 1996. After the Congo War, the Republic of Burundi annexed Maniema and Tanganyika from Zaire, more than doubling their land size. They also laid claim to Sud-Kivu, but that came under the annexation of the Rwandan Empire, which would later be the main factor of animosity between the two. After annexing the lands from Zaire, Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi and the president of Burundi, crowned himself as King and became Ntare VI, declaring the Kingdom of Burundi and changing the Republic's liberal democracy into a constitutional monarchy. This became its territorial peak in 1998. When World War III broke out in 1999, Burundi joined the Federation faction and fought a brutal front against the Rwandan Empire. When Rwanda surrendered in 2002 and WW3 ended, the peace treaties restored Zaire's territorial integrity, which reduced Burundi down to its original pre-Congo War size. However, they were able to annex all of mainland Rwanda, which is the land the Kingdom has today.\n\nThe Kingdom of Burundi is considered a lower income country, having the 19th lowest GDP in the world. Since 2005, it has been fighting a low-level insurgency against al-Qaeda. Its military is the 135th strongest in the world, with most of its military equipment coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and the European Union. It is a member of the UN, African Federation, and is a major non-NATO ally."
