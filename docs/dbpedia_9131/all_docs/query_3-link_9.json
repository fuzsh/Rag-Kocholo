        "text": "What the World Food Programme is doing in Burundi\n\nCrisis response\n\nWFP provides life-saving food assistance to 56,000 refugees in camps in 2023. WFP also distributes food and cash assistance to 25,000 returnees in transit centres. In addition, WFP provides a combination of unconditional in-kind, e-voucher and cash-based transfers to over 350,000 vulnerable people affected by climate shocks.\n\nPrevention of malnutrition\n\nWFP distributed specialized nutritious foods to over 47,000 women and children in 2023, including 31,000 children under 5, to treat moderate acute malnutrition. During lean seasons, WFP distributed cash-based transfers to around 7,850 vulnerable households.\n\nSchool meals\n\nWFP works with national and international institutions on the procurement of safe and nutritious food for the school-meals programme. This involves linking smallholder farmers directly to schools. WFP provides nutritious food to over 667,000 school-going children in 874 schools across 8 provinces in 2023. Our Safe Access to Fuel and Energy for Food security programme equips schools with facilities such as energy-efficient cooking stoves, kitchen shelters and water-collection points.\n\nSustainable food systems\n\nWFP partners with the Government of Burundi to build the capacities of smallholder farmers in food systems. This includes training in handling and storage, boosting farmers’ household incomes through local purchases for home-grown school feeding, promoting agricultural digitization and extending hydroponics systems in schools and communities. In 2023, WFP supports 24,000 farmers who are members of cooperatives, across markets including maize, milk, beans and rice.\n\nCapacity building\n\nWFP strengthens the capacities of the Government, humanitarian organizations and other partners to reach vulnerable populations and respond to their needs. This involves providing logistics and supply chain services, emergency telecommunications, and information technology services to the humanitarian and development sectors.\n\nIn focus\n\nAs El Niño intensifies floods and droughts, early action pays off\n\nStory\n\n4 things you should know about school meals worldwide\n\nStory\n\nHow Project Amata supports dairy farmers and helps feed vulnerable schoolchildren in Burundi\n\nStory\n\n5 ways breastfeeding helps mothers and babies alike\n\nStory\n\nAfrica Day: How WFP helps families struck by climate change in Burundi\n\nStory\n\nBurundi: A contribution of fish from Japan buoys the diets of schoolchildren\n\nStory\n\nBurundi news releases\n\nGo to page"
