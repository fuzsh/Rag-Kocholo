        "text": "In 2023, the Burundian #franc depreciated with 27.5% against the US dollar. This means more franc are required to service USD-denominated debt. We developed the Health and Education at Risk (#HEAR) ratio to show what an increasing debt burden may mean for government budgets. For Burundi, we measure a HEAR Ratio of -4. In other words, Burundi's open foreign exchange exposure amounts to 4x its average annual budget for #health and #education. Reducing the level of unhedged USD debt would be an important step towards improved financial resilience and increased #debtsustainability. Visit our website to learn more about the HEAR Ratio. #fxrisk #developmentfinance #Burundi #BIF\n\nðŸ’° World Bank and IMF Boost Aid to Zambia Amidst Severe Drought and Currency Challenges The World Bank has approved an additional $200mn in grants to aid Zambia in coping with its worst drought in decades, according to the Finance Ministry. Additionally, nearly $8mn has been allocated for women and girl empowerment. This year, Zambia will receive a total of $522mn in grants from the World Bank. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also increased its financing to Zambia by about $386mn to support drought relief efforts. Recall that in February, President Hakainde Hichilema declared the drought a national disaster and sought international assistance, facing a $900mn shortfall due to the severe weather. In addition to the inflows, note that the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) recently announced plans to criminalise the use of foreign currency within the local economy to support the currency. A draft document released last weekend indicated that individuals using foreign currency for domestic transactions could face fines or up to 10 years in prison. BoZ Deputy Governor Francis Chipimo stressed that the heavy reliance on dollars weakens the central bank's authority and increases vulnerability to external shocks. On the whole, these measures will assist in easing a hard currency shortage in Zambia, providing additional support to the kwacha. Following a strong advance at the end of last week, the kwacha is the second-best-performing currency this year, lagging only the Kenyan shilling. It has advanced more than 6% against the dollar year-to-date, but still remains down some 28% over the last 12 months. -by ETM Analytics #WorldBank #IMF #Zambia #DroughtRelief #EconomicSupport #WomenEmpowerment #CurrencyPolicy #Kwacha #Finance #GlobalAid #EconomicRecovery #Sustainability #AfricanEconomy\n\nMonetary Foreign Direct Investment in Zimbabwe has cruised past the often touted as glorious period of 2009-2013 to reach USD588m. The focus of macroeconomic stability with the recently World Bank approved ZWG (ZiG) currency symbol, simplifying exports, improving the ease & cost of doing business could see this figure touch USD1bn. In fact the top five companies in Zimbabwe invested a total amount close to USD500m into the economy in 2023 meaning local direct investment remains important. Another factor to consider is that most investment (capital goods) are supported by loan financing which reached USD1.4bn.\n\nThe IMF has reportedly done it again â€“ leaned on Kenya and Malawi to implement growth-crippling and poverty-enhancing measures that would no doubt leave these poor countries in perpetual status of underdevelopment. Import-dependent Malawi was pressured into devaluing its already devalued currency, the Kwacha, by 30%, to receive, in return, a loan of just $178 million. The consequences of inflating sovereign debt by 30% as well as hiking imports by a similar margin would be devastating. In contrast, the Fund has agreed to provide Ukraine a further $900 million without seeking demonstrable action against widely reported corruption, or a slight devaluation of the hryvnia. In Nairobi, the Monitory Policy Committee hiked the countryâ€™s base lending rate by 200 basis points pushing the effective commercial lending rate to 30%. I contend that this move, ostensibly taken to tame inflation and stabilize the shilling, is misplaced, and illustrates just how the so-called African technocrat destroy their economies at the behest of others.\n\n- African countries are adapting with nearly half focused on increasing revenue, whereas the other half are reducing spending. Congratulations to Botswana, Cameroon, and Kenya, who are focusing on preserving their investment-to-GDP ratios while cutting current spending. -High interest rates are accentuating financing shortages, high borrowing costs, and impending debt repayments. borrowing rates have risen from about 6.5% to 10% in four years. -Like the Cameroon Economic Policy Institute (CEPI), the IMF thinks trade relationships beyond traditional partners can diversify exports, mitigate risks, and limit economic downturns. #AGOA #AFCFTA #EPA -Security Risk: The security situation also remains challenging in several other countries including Burkina Faso, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Mozambique, and Nigeria. -Africa Risk Premium: It is more expensive for governments to borrow than private companies due to political risk, project completion risk, and past defaults. #IMF #Outlook #Summary #Africa #Cameroon\n\nNot too long ago, The International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave Zambia's debt a green light! According to the IMF, implementing restructuring agreements with both official and private creditors is the key to ensuring Zambia's debt is sustainable. This means there's hope on the horizon for Zambia's economic future! With these agreements in place, Zambia's debt will be assessed as sustainable, with only a moderate risk of debt distress over the medium term. And the best part? This assessment holds true under both baseline and upside scenarios. It's a testament to Zambia's commitment to fiscal responsibility and financial stability. In theory, this news paves the way for a brighter tomorrow for Zambia and its people. A cause for celebration? Letâ€™s wait and seeâ€¦â€¦ #IMF #ZambiaEconomy #FinancialStability #EconomicGrowth #FiscalResponsibility\n\nIf you say there are great business and investment opportunities in Zimbabwe right now, some will label you as being a Zanu PF propagandist and anti opposition political parties. If you say there are no great business and investment opportunities in Zimbabwe right now, some will label you an enemy of the state, anti-Zanu PF and pro-opposition. All this is economic nonsense and it helps no one. People who muddle up politics and economics in whichever direct damage the economy and compromise the economic progress of the country. Zimbabwe's economic environment is not at its best and it has real risks, but that does not mean that it is doomed and has no great business and investment opportunities. There are great business and investment opportunities in Zimbabwe. If you want more specific information about specific investment and business opportunities available please let me know. #strategy #strategicthinking\n\nKenya Losing Economic Edge in East Africa, CBK Warns Kenya's competitiveness compared to its East African neighbours has weakened over the past decade. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Kenya has lagged behind Uganda and Tanzania, contributing to a weaker shilling. Kenya's exports as a percentage of GDP have declined, while tourism receipts and FDI have also fallen. Debt service costs in Kenya are much higher than in its neighbours. Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Kamau Thugge blames the previous administration for artificially propping up the shilling, leading to its current weakness. CBK has raised the Central Bank Rate by 200 basis points to 12.5%, the highest in 11 years, to address the weakening shilling. Overall, Kenya is facing a number of economic challenges that are making it less competitive than its East African neighbours. The government and the CBK need to take action to address these challenges and ensure that Kenya remains a vibrant and prosperous economy. #dollarisation (Story On Business Daily )"
