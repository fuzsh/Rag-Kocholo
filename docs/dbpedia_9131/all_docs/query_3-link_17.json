        "text": "Safety and security\n\nBubanza and Cibitoke provinces\n\nBorder security is a concern in the provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke due to the various violent clashes in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and occasional cross-border movement by armed groups.\n\nBanditry, small arms trafficking, kidnappings and attacks on civilians by former soldiers, rebels and youth gangs occur.\n\nPolitical tensions\n\nBurundi has a recent history of political violence. Politically motivated attacks involving small arms and grenades have occurred in recent years, including in Bujumbura.\n\nSecurity searches\n\nSecurity forces have the authority to conduct searches at any time of homes and vehicles, in order to allegedly recover weapons. Car searches seem to be conducted randomly, usually at roadblocks. Foreigners have been subjected to both car and home searches.\n\nTo search a house, officers must present their identification card but don’t require a search warrant. Cooperate with the officer. Should you encounter problems, request to contact the Consulate in Bujumbura or the High Commission to Kenya in Nairobi.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThere is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include:\n\ngovernment buildings, including schools\n\nplaces of worship\n\nairports and other transportation hubs and networks\n\npublic areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners\n\nAlways be aware of your surroundings when in public places.\n\nCrime\n\nIncidents of muggings at gun and knifepoint, purse snatching and pickpocketing occur. Crime is often committed by children. Criminal activity increases at night.\n\nThere is a risk of assault if you’re walking or jogging alone, particularly on roads around Lake Tanganyika. Avoid walking, driving or taking public transportation after dark anywhere in the country, including in Bujumbura.\n\nKeep valuables, travel documents, and cash in safe locations, such as in hotel safes. Keep separate and digital copies of important documents, including your passport.\n\nKidnapping\n\nKidnapping for ransom occurs and criminals have targeted foreigners in the past.\n\nCheck points\n\nThere are frequent checkpoints throughout the country. Travellers have reported incidents of harassment, intimidation and physical violence at checkpoints, particularly at night.\n\nIdentification\n\nYou should carry photo identification at all times. To limit the risk of your passport being lost or stolen, carry only a photocopy of it.\n\nTourism Infrastructure and telecommunications\n\nTourism infrastructure are limited throughout the country. The telecommunications network is not always reliable outside the capital.\n\nPlan your trip accordingly\n\nChoose accommodation that provides adequate security\n\nDo not rely on your cell phone for emergency calls, especially outside the capital\n\nAdventure tourism\n\nOutdoor activities, such as zip lining, swimming, paragliding, hiking, cycling, etc. and other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even during summer.\n\nTour operators may not always adhere to international safety standards.\n\nIf you intend to practice adventure tourism:\n\nnever do so alone, and do not part with your tour companions\n\nconsider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company\n\nobtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out\n\nconsult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas\n\nPower outages\n\nPower outages occur regularly, especially outside the capital. They could impact essential services such as:\n\npublic transportation\n\ntelecommunications\n\nbanking transactions\n\nthe purchase of basic necessities\n\nNot all buildings are equipped with generators.\n\nPlan accordingly\n\nKeep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand\n\nMake sure you always have an emergency kit on hand\n\nDemonstrations\n\nDemonstrations and mass gathering occur occasionally, particularly in Bujumbura, and have the potential to turn violent. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.\n\nAvoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nMonitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations\n\nMass gatherings (large-scale events)\n\nWomen’s safety\n\nSexual assault, including rape, is common. Be aware that in some jurisdictions, the victim is required to provide food during the perpetrator’s incarceration.\n\nAdvice for women travellers\n\nRoad safety\n\nRoad conditions vary throughout the country but is generally dangerous due to:\n\nunmarked and damaged roads\n\nlimited street lights and traffic signals\n\nerratic and reckless driving habits\n\nAvoid driving unless you are familiar with local conditions. If hiring a driver, make sure to do so through a reputable company.\n\nYou should travel by convoy and only during the day. Travelling outside Bujumbura puts you at higher risk.\n\nIf you must drive:\n\nalways respect security rules and procedures\n\ncheck information on road security on a daily basis\n\ncarry multiple spare tires\n\nDuring the rainy season, many roads are only accessible with four-wheel-drive vehicles.\n\nService stations are rare, fuel shortages are frequent and roadside assistance is not available outside the capital.\n\nIn the event of an accident, leave the scene without stopping and go to the nearest police station or, if necessary, to the hospital.\n\nYou may encounter legitimate roadblocks. Be aware, however, that criminals are known to impersonate security forces and set up unofficial roadblocks to solicit bribes.\n\nPublic transportation\n\nAvoid using taxis. Drivers often operate within a criminal network. If the use of a taxi is unavoidable, hire one from a reputable company.\n\nYou should also avoid using public buses. Vehicle and road conditions are the cause of frequent and serious accidents.\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nHealth\n\nThis section contains information on possible health risks and restrictions regularly found or ongoing in the destination. Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is a risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of yellow fever vaccination for travellers from all countries.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is recommended.\n\nContact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of their trip to arrange for vaccination.\n\nDiscuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nMeningococcal disease\n\nThis destination is in the African Meningitis Belt, an area which has the highest rates of meningococcal disease in the world. Meningococcal disease is a serious and sometimes fatal infection.\n\nTravellers who are at higher risk should discuss vaccination with a health care provider. High-risk travellers include those living or working with the local population (e.g., health care workers) or those travelling to crowded areas or taking part in large gatherings.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.\n\nMalaria is a risk to travellers to this destination.\n\nAntimalarial medication is recommended for most travellers to this destination and should be taken as recommended. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:\n\nCover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.\n\nExclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.\n\nUse insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.\n\nWear permethrin-treated clothing.\n\nIf you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nPolio\n\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is an infectious disease that can be prevented by vaccination. It is caused by poliovirus type 1, 2 or 3. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2 (cVDPV2) is present in this country.\n\nPolio is spread from person to person and through contaminated food and water. Infection with the polio virus can cause paralysis and death in individuals of any age who are not immune.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nBe sure that your polio vaccinations are up to date before travelling. Polio is part of the routine vaccine schedule for children in Canada.\n\nOne booster dose of the polio vaccine is recommended as an adult.\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page.

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by tiny worms (blood flukes) which can be found in freshwater (lakes, rivers, ponds, and wetlands). The worms can break the skin, and their eggs can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, or urinary problems. Schistosomiasis mostly affects underdeveloped and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing communities.\n\nMost travellers are at low risk. Travellers should avoid contact with untreated freshwater such as lakes, rivers, and ponds (e.g., swimming, bathing, wading, ingesting). There is no vaccine or medication available to prevent infection.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country.

It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.\n\nDengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.\n\nThe level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.\n\nMosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue fever.\n\nOnchoceriasis\n\nOnchocerciasis (river blindness) is an eye and skin disease caused by a parasite spread through the bite of an infected female blackfly. Onchocerciasis often leads to blindness if left untreated. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from blackfly bites, which are most common close to fast-flowing rivers and streams. There is no vaccine available for onchocerciasis although drug treatments exist.\n\nZika virus\n\nZika virus is a risk in this country.\n\nZika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause serious birth defects.\n\nDuring your trip:\n\nPrevent mosquito bites at all times.\n\nUse condoms correctly or avoid sexual contact, particularly if you are pregnant.\n\nIf you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should discuss the potential risks of travelling to this destination with your health care provider. You may choose to avoid or postpone travel.\n\nFor more information, see Zika virus: Pregnant or planning a pregnancy.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.\n\nFor most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.\n\nTravellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.\n\nHigh-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.\n\nHIV\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks and impairs the immune system, resulting in a chronic, progressive illness known as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).\n\nHigh risk activities include anything which puts you in contact with blood or body fluids, such as unprotected sex and exposure to unsterilized needles for medications or other substances (for example, steroids and drugs), tattooing, body-piercing or acupuncture.\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nHealth care is inadequate. You will likely need medical evacuation in case of serious illness or injury. For medical evacuations, planes need to fly in from other countries.\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.\n\nHealth and safety outside Canada\n\nKeep in Mind...\n\nThe decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.\n\nBe prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a travel health kit, especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.\n\nLaws and culture\n\nYou must abide by local laws.\n\nLearn about what you should do and how we can help if you are arrested or detained abroad.\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons\n\nBurundian law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.\n\nThose convicted can face imprisonment.\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Burundi.\n\nTravel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics\n\nDrugs\n\nPenalties for the possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe.\n\nDrugs, alcohol and travel\n\nPhotography\n\nObtain permission before taking photographs of military installations, airports, government buildings and local residents.\n\nDual citizenship\n\nDual citizenship is legally recognized in Burundi.\n\nIf you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Burundi, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there.
