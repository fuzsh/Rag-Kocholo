        "text": "Burundi is situated in the Great Rift Valley, strategically positioned at the convergence of the African Great Lakes region and East Africa. This landlocked nation shares borders with Rwanda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nBurundiâ€™s official currency is the franc. Although the Burundian franc is subdivided into 100 centimes, the country has never issued a currency in denomination of a centime, except during the time it used the Belgian Congo franc.\n\nThe introduction of the franc in Burundi dates back to 1916, when Belgium dominated the country and adopted the Belgian Congo franc. The Belgian Congo franc currency remained in use until the Rwanda-Burundi franc was introduced in 1960. It wasn't until 1964 that Burundi began issuing its independent francs.\n\nIn 1965, the Bank of the Kingdom of Burundi released 1 franc coins made of brass. It features the coat of arms of Burundi. In 1968, the responsibility for coin issuance transitioned to the Bank of the Republic of Burundi, which introduced aluminum 1 and 5 francs, as well as cupro-nickel 10 francs. In 1976, 1 and 5 franc coins also, featuring the national coat of arms, were introduced. In 2011, Burundi introduced a new 10-franc coin that features banana, corn, and wheat, and a 50-franc coin, featuring a man with a drum on his head."
