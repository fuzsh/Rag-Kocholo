        "text": "Burundi , officially Republic of Burundi, Country, east-central Africa. Area: 10,747 sq mi (27,834 sq km). Population: (2024 est.) 13,439,000. Capital: Bujumbura. The population is divided primarily between the approximately four-fifths who are Hutu and the approximately one-fifth who are Tutsi. The first inhabitants, the Twa Pygmies, make up about 1% of the population. Languages: Rundi (Kirundi), French (both official), Swahili. Religions: Christianity (mostly Roman Catholic; also Protestant, other Christians); also traditional beliefs. Currency: Burundi franc. Burundi occupies a high plateau straddling the divide of the Nile and Congo watersheds. The divide runs north to south, rising to about 8,500 ft (2,600 m). The plateau contains the Ruvubu River basin, the southernmost extension of the Nile basin. In the west the Rusizi River connects Lake Kivu in the north with Lake Tanganyika to the south. Burundi has a developing economy based primarily on agriculture. It is a republic with two legislative houses, and its head of state and government is the president, assisted by vice presidents. Original settlement by the Twa was followed by Hutu settlement, which began about 1000 ad. The Tutsi arrived sometime later; though a minority, they established the kingdom of Burundi in the 16th century. In the 19th century the area came within the German sphere of influence, but the Tutsi remained in power. Following World War I, the Belgians were awarded control of the area. Colonial conditions had intensified Hutu-Tutsi ethnic animosities, and, as independence neared, hostilities flared. Independence was granted in 1962 in the form of a kingdom ruled by the Tutsi. In 1965 the Hutu rebelled but were brutally repressed. The two groups clashed violently throughout the rest of the 20th century, although the number of deaths did not approach the nearly one million people killed in neighbouring Rwanda. In 2001 a power-sharing transitional government was established and paved the way to the promulgation of a new constitution and the installation of a new government in 2005.\n\nBurundi made its Olympic debut at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta."
