The franc is the official currency of Burundi since 1960 when it replaced the Belgian Congo franc. In 1964, the Banque d’Emission du Rwanda et du Burundi (Issuing Bank of Rwanda and Burundi) started to issue notes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 francs, followed by 5,000 francs in 1966. The 10 francs note were replaced by coin and the 2,000 francs issued in 2001 followed by 10,000 francs in 2004.
