        "text": "Time again for one of those posts where I give you a little overview of a plot that I’m not sure how much we’re going to see on screen that impacts the Manny storyline that will help you understand what is on screen a little better. This time it’s the relationship between Rick Bauer and Harley Cooper.\n\nOne night when they were all reeling from broken relationships (Rick’s split from Abby, Harley’s split from Phillip after he kept trying to keep his kids out of Edmund’s sphere of influence, Buzz after Selena left town after getting him arrested, Frank from breakup with Eleni) they all gather at Harley’s and sit around drinking ouzo (Greek wine) and getting really drunk. That’s all we see at the time. In the morning they all wake up hung over.\n\nLater Harley starts showing symptoms of a pregnancy around the time she betrays the Bauer-Santos family by helping Gus get evidence against them. At first there is suggestion that the baby was Phillip’s, her ex-husband’s and that Rick was just helping her cover up. Eventually it came out that Rick and Harley had sex on ouzo night and she was pregnant with Rick’s baby. It is this baby that keeps Harley and Rick connected and the only thing that keeps Danny and Michelle from cutting Harley completely out of their lives after her betrayal. It keeps a lot of tension with their relationships between the characters for the entire pregnancy. The baby was eventually born and became Jude Bauer.\n\nIn some ways, this whole thing was kind of revenge on both Harley’s and Rick’s parts against Phillip. Harley because even though she had every reason to think Phillip was still connected to Beth before she married him (she even thought he was going to propose to Beth when he proposed to her instead), she was terribly shocked when it turned out Phillip was still connected to Beth and broke up their marriage. Rick wanted unconscious revenge because Phillip had pulled pretty much this same stunt on him….twice. Phillip pitches a total fit and cuts Rick out of his life for awhile, but honestly I think he owed Rick an “OK all right that’s fair” especially because he and Harley were pretty much done when it happened. Eventually Phillip will forgive Rick, after Rick got mad that Phillip took so long about it.\n\nOnce they got past this “Who’s the Daddy?” part of the story where Harley and Rick worked as a team to get through the pregnancy and in dealing with Phillip, they start trying out Harley and Rick as a long term couple. They even move them into together, allowing Manny to work on their Mr. Big storyline. Sadly neither Rick nor Harley show much enthusiasm. They had been moving Harley and Rick together and showed they were wonderful friends, but they kept saying they were going to try making a romantic relationship work because it was “the right thing to do.” It was a half-hearted effort at best. At the same time they were drawn into a quad with Gus Aitoro romancing Harley and Rick being bewitched by Mel Boudreau the recently come to town lawyer/doctor. Gus and Harley would become the popular GusH pairing helped along by writing emphasizing them and drawing the story away from Rick to the point that it was Gus, not Rick who got to be there for Jude’s birth. This pattern would continue. After Rick had spent decades wanting a child to recreate his special relationship with his grandmother Bert, he was cut out almost completely from Jude’s life while Harley and Gus were shown actively parenting him.\n\nAt the same time Rick got involved with Mel. She was a doctor which returned Rick to his pattern he had previously been involved with several doctors. Eventually Rick and Mel are married, party they are rushed into it because Rick has gotten an infection in his heart and he will die if he doesn’t get a transplant. Mel served as a caregiver right before and after their marriage. The marriage hung in there for a number of years, they even had their own child, before breaking up over an affair of Rick’s.\n\nSo basically they are going to take a really great friendship between Rick and Harley and trash it over a half-hearted attempt at romance which was basically set up as a straw man to knock down for the coming two pairs. I’m sorry for that for a few reasons. First, it trashed a good friendship. Second, I really would have liked to see a genuine effort on them building a marriage based on friendship rather than a great romance. That’s a story that isn’t really told on soaps and it has all sorts of new storyline possibilities. Third, I found Rick and Mel completely chemistry free, so I was sorry that was the story they pursued. Fourth, it really bugged me the most that Rick never really got to raise a child even after he had two.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
