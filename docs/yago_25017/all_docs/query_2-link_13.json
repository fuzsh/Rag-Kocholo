        "text": "Alan-Michael was raised by his mother after his parent's divorce. When 18, he returned to Springfield in search of a relationship with his father. Unfortunately, his place had been taken by Alan's adopted son Phillip. The siblings began a long and resentful relationship, with Alan-Michael always vowing to take the company as his rightful possession.\n\nSpoiled and bored, he spent his youth riding his motorcycle and bouncing between Dinah and Harley. He got engaged to the latter at the age of 21 so that he could gain control of his trust fund. Despite Phillip's attempts to break them up and destroy Alan-Michael's stake in the company, the couple actually fell in love. The relationship was strained by jealousy and he went as far as kidnapping her estranged daughter Susan to bond them together. After a lengthy break up, where they fought bitterly for his money, he ended up marrying Phillip's conniving ex-wife Blake with whom he'd been having an affair. Almost instantly, he was abducted by one of her former beaus before being rescued by Roger and then accidentally shot by her, almost dying while she was put in a mental hospital. A quick divorce followed their stormy relationship which carried him through a series of backroom plots by which he attempted to take over Spaulding.\n\nHe became entranced by Greek beauty Eleni and had to engage in labyrinthine plotting to win her over. This included flying her half-way across the world and framing her betrothed, Frank Cooper, of having an affair before eventually marrying her at customs so that she could enter the country. His bid to keep her was complicated when one of his accomplices, Musette, continued to reappear with threats to expose him. Overreacting, he hired a deranged man named Pierre who blew up Towers in a bid to silence her. He fled with his new wife and tried to get her pregnant by replacing her birth control with placebos in a bid to keep her. She soon discovered his schemes and grew distant, though she refused to leave for the sake of her child. Their relationship eventually collapsed when he realized the baby she carried was actually Frank's. Still, he remained attached to her, even as he got involved with Frank's virginal sister Lucy.\n\nExiled for a time from his family, he sought out competitive opportunities and ended up battling his father's enemy Harry Jones. He again reached out to Alan, who, in turn, exploited him and pushed him out of the company. His feud with his father continued to intensify as he joined forces with most of his enemies, buoyed by the strength of his relationship with Lucy Cooper. This would peak when Alan-Michael disowned his father after Brent was supposedly found dead thanks to Alan's misdeeds. While he tried to send his father to jail, he failed and alienated himself further from the family. Remaining in control of the company, he found a new enemy in employee and psychopath Marion, who turned out to be Brent in disguise. While he was abducted and shot, he managed to survive to be rescued and continued to seek revenge on his father, ultimately siding with the Coopers against him.\n\nEventually, tired of the tribulations, he and Lucy left for Europe. He returned alone several years later, began dating his ex-wife's daughter and joined with his half-brother Gus in trying to bring Alan down again. More mischievous than ever, he managed to play all sides against each, manipulating Dinah, Harley and Alan, until he pushed himself into the CEO position. Dark, handsome and enigmatic, Alan-Michael has always been ruthlessly ambitious, but continues to act with apparent kindness, most recently to Ava Peralta in her search for her parents.\n\nHis relationship with Ava was rocky and never consummated. It served to distract him as his father tried to push himself back into the business. When Alan was shot, Alan-Michael played to looking out for his father's interests while surreptitiously attempting to usurp all of the power in the family. When this became apparent to Beth and Alexandra, they banded together against him. As his father recovered, he was pushed out of the business and to the margins of the community. He continued to desperately pursue Ava without luck and was even abducted and threatened by her parents to keep him away. As his behavior became erratic and he sought revenge, his own father finally forced him to leave town in shame to avoid prosecution for crimes he was alleged to have committed."
