        "text": "Doris Behrens of Sherman, formerly of Jerome, was a new bride when she began watching “Guiding Light” in 1955.\n\n“The script was excellent, and the characters were very good,” Behrens, 85, said of the CBS-TV daytime drama that for 72 years has chronicled the ups and downs of the Bauer, Spaulding, Lewis, Marler and Cooper families.\n\nSet in the fictional Midwestern town of Springfield — a place (presumably smaller than Illinois’ capital city) along a large lake featuring a lighthouse — the soap opera has been credited by Guinness World Records as “The Longest-Running Television Drama.” It has garnered dozens of Daytime Emmy Awards, including three for Outstanding Daytime Drama Series.\n\nAnd on Friday, it all comes to an end when the final episode airs.\n\nDespite its longevity, “Guiding Light” recently has had the lowest Nielson ratings of the eight daytime dramas on television.\n\nAnd fans — even those who have not been watching every day — say they’ll miss it.\n\nLesley Pollard of Hillsboro, formerly of Chatham, got “hooked” on “Guiding Light” about 25 years ago, first watching it as a young girl with her mother and later taping it everyday.\n\nPollard quit watching the soap “religiously” about 11 months ago — because she couldn’t get used to the show being filmed with hand-held digital cameras — but she still “liked to be able to watch it when I wanted to.”\n\n“I was devastated when I heard it was going off the air,” she said.\n\nCreated by Chicago-native Irna Phillips (referred to as the “mother” of soap operas by the Museum of Broadcast Communications), the show debuted on NBC radio in January 1937 as the 15-minute serial “The Guiding Light.”\n\nMoving to CBS television in 1952, the series co-existed on the radio until 1956. In the late 1960s, the program expanded from 15-minute episodes to 30- minute episodes and earned a one-hour slot weekdays on CBS in 1977.\n\nEarly storylines revolved around the Rev. John Ruthledge and others living in the fictional Chicago suburb of “Five Points.” The location changed in 1966 when the show’s principal family, the Bauers, moved to Springfield.\n\nFans near and far responded to a request by The State Journal-Register for comments about their favorite villains, romances and cliffhangers on “The Guiding Light,” which reportedly was canceled because of declining viewership.\n\nTricia Broughton of Chatham recalled tuning into the soap with her “Granny” on many summer days in the 1970s.\n\n“For an hour every afternoon, we stopped whatever we were doing to watch her ‘story,’” Broughton wrote. “I remember her getting so mad at certain characters that’d she get up and switch off the big console TV and walk out of the room, just to walk right back in and turn it on before the commercial break was over.”\n\n“She loved Hope Bauer and hated Alan Spaulding! She loved Joshua Lewis and hated Reva,” Broughton said of her grandmother, adding that her own personal favorites were Phillip Spaulding, Beth Raines, Rick Bauer and Mindy Lewis.\n\nAmee Lee of Taylorville also watched the show during the summer with her grandmother and mother.\n\n“Reva and Josh have always been my favorite couple, and it kills me that they are no longer together,” Lee said.\n\nIn classic soap opera fashion, actress Kim Zimmer’s character — the notorious Reva Shayne Lewis Spaulding Lewis Cooper O’Neill — has had her share of husbands, including Josh Lewis, portrayed by Robert Newman, who married and divorced her three times.\n\n“I really liked Reva. She was vibrant,” Behrens said.\n\nCarol Bridges of Watkinsville, Ga., has been a loyal viewer of “Guiding Light” for decades.\n\n“I was born in October 1952. I wouldn’t swear to it, but I think my mother may have been watching the show when I came upon this earth. Our days included a Pepsi and date with the TV,” Bridges said, noting that “Harley (Cooper) kept me intrigued, and Nola (Reardon-Chamberlain) was a laugh a minute.”\n\nCyndy Schnell of New Castle, Pa., also was born in 1952 and can’t remember a time when “Guiding Light” wasn’t on her family’s small screen. She lost touch with the show for a while when she started working as a barber in 1978 and “there weren’t any of the high-tech devices we have today for recording.”\n\n“It was like an obsession; I had to be home every day in time to see what was happening to all of my favorite characters,” Schnell said.\n\n“It is my stress reliever. It takes me out of my world and life and into the Springfield life,” agreed Teri Ashworth of Andover, N.J., who is “disappointed” the show is ending.\n\nDuring its run, “Guiding Light” dealt with such topics as teen pregnancy, sexual harassment, marital rape, alcoholism, cancer, abuse, AIDS and post-partum depression.\n\n“They tend to touch on more current issues now — things that people can relate to. It makes (the soap) a little more real,” Pollard said, adding that some storylines have been “cheesy” or far-fetched.\n\nBut efforts to keep the show topically relevant apparently were not enough to keep “Guiding Light” on the air in a changing media landscape.\n\nPaula Treichler, professor emerita at the University of Illinois’ College of Media at Champaign-Urbana, said there could be several reasons for the demise of the show, which is owned by Procter & Gamble.\n\nUp until about 20 years ago, soap operas (a term coined when the dramas were sponsored by soap manufacturers) had a “pretty reliable audience,” made up of women who didn’t work outside the home and college students. However, that viewership became fragmented when more and more women entered the workforce.\n\n“There really is no solid, predictable audience for anything, unless you count kids who are watching on computers,” Treichler said, pointing out that even primetime serials are struggling.\n\n“Any program where you have to pay actors and write scripts — all of those are in danger,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, some people may have perceived “Guiding Light” as “old-fashioned,” compared to other soaps or such nighttime dramas as “Desperate Housewives” or unscripted “reality” shows such as “The Real Housewives,” Treichler said.\n\nStill, the professor thinks soap operas can survive.\n\n“It’s a matter of soap operas finding a role for themselves in this unpredictable media (environment),” Treichler said.\n\nSome fans believe “Guiding Light” could’ve endured had it been broadcast on SOAPnet channel, where it might’ve developed a larger following (SOAPnet is available to Comcast Cable’s digital cable customers). Others hope the “citizens of Springfield” will be revived on another network.\n\nPollard hopes episodes eventually will be released on DVD.\n\n“I would be one of those crazy people who would spend (money) on the boxed set,” she said.\n\nBehrens hasn’t watched “Guiding Light” in a few years, but she’s missed it.\n\n“It just got away from me,” she said.\n\nBut as former cast members, including Tom Pelphrey (alias Jonathan Randall), return for the show’s final chapter, Pollard intends to tune in.\n\n“I plan to watch until the bitter end,” she said."
