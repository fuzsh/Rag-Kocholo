        "text": "A few more names that came to mind today:\n\nJennifer Hammon: Best known for her stint as Karen Wexler on “Port Charles”, replacing Cari Shayne who played the role on “GH”, Hammon was actually a great recast for Karen. It seems that since her on “PC” ended she had sporadic work in episodic TV and then left the industry around 2001, because her last credit is from a 2001 episode of “The X-Files.”\n\nCari Shayne: She was Karen Wexler #1; originated the role on “GH” and after leaving “GH” had a fairly prolific career in episodic primetime TV and TV movies. She guest starred on shows as diverse as “Party of Five”, “Cold Case”, “Criminal Minds” and “Star Trek: Voyager.” It seems she went on some sort of hiatus from 2008 until 2017. Because after 2008 she doesn’t have a credit until a 2017 short film.\n\nI always felt she could have been a huge soap star if she had stayed on soaps.\n\nJason Shane Scott was a huge breakout star on “OLTL” when he originated the role of Will Rappaport and his stint on the show was too short-lived. It was kind odd to me that role wasn’t recast at some point. Although JSS continued to work outside of daytime, it was a shame he didn’t get snatched up by another soap; he would have easily fit onto the canvas of DOOL or Y&R with his good looks.\n\n\"and to the fans, I was only supposed be on every other Tuesday. But thanks to you I'm here to stay. I'm going back to that studio on Monday and I'm going to play Erica Kane for all she's worth.\"- Susan Lucci, 1999 Daytime Emmy Speech.\n\nI grew up on Guiding Light in the ’80s and miss so many of the classic characters from that decade. I adored Kristi Ferrell as Roxy Shayne during her four-year run, but I believe she voluntarily left acting after her time on the show came to an end. I also loved Michael O’Leary as Rick Bauer and he doesn’t seem to have worked in front of the camera since the show ended. I also thought Mary Kay Adams was brilliant as India von Halkein (and criminally ignored by the Daytime Emmys) and Fiona Hutchison was amazing as Jenna Bradshaw (and had a great Emmy reel the year she was nominated, but no one was beating Hillary B. Smith’s reel that year).\n\nI never saw Vanessa Marcil on GH, since I was a GL devotee, but she was my favorite on Las Vegas and I would love to see her on another series. I understand that she has had some health issues, including multiple miscarriages, that may hamper her ability to take a long-term role. But I wish her the very best and hope she’s able to grace our screens again in the future.\n\nThis is why it is particularly sad there are only 4 soaps now ): It used to be that if someone wanted to work on soaps chances were in their favor that they could get a role on a different show and soap hop. Not everyone wanted to but many did and did so successfully. So many amazing talented actors but not enough roles. Occasional guest roles on Law & Order franchise shows for most of the east coast soap actors but not much else. So few went on to prime-time or movie stardom and almost all of them stayed on soaps for less than 3 years (a few rare exceptions such as Marg Helgenberger at 4 years but as a rule all of the stars – Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, Kathleen Turner, Alec Baldwin, Valerie Mahaffey, Meg Ryan – just to name a few who went on to win awards post-soaps, all were on soaps for less than 3 years).\n\nI was thinking about Matt Crane and Robin Christopher, who met on AW and got married in real life – where are they now? How about Emmy winner Drew Tyler Bell? Drew Garrett? Lisa Trusel? Grant Aleksander? Melissa Hayden? The list is endless!\n\nSpeaking of Guiding Light, I wonder what Beth Ehlers (who portrayed one of my all-time favorite characters, Harley Cooper) has been up to? Has she retired from acting? It’s been too long since she last graced our screens and would love to see her return to daytime. I miss her (as well as some of my other favorite GL alums like Justin Deas, Tom Pelphrey and Ricky Paull Goldin) so much!\n\nBeth Ehlers left the profession.\n\nAfter Ehlers’s run on All My Children was a failure, and it was head writer Chuck Pratt’s fault, she did the short-lived Internet soap River Ridge (c. 2011 or 2012). (Her last AMC episode aired just three days after Guiding Light’s.)\n\nI came across, in 2013 Soap Opera Digest, Ehlers was in college. Another site, discussing similar topics, mentioned she is in the medical profession and lives in the state of New York. (Her sons are 19 and 17. In the early- to mid-2010s, they were teen or pre-teen.)\n\nSince the timing was that, in 2009, AMC relocated to Los Angeles, California, that left only one soap (after As the World Turns’s final episode in 2010) produced in New York City: One Life to Live. That series was canceled, just after AMC, in 2011. (OLTL’s last network episode aired in January 2012.)\n\nEhlers, who turned 50 last month, likely decided she did not want to move to California to try to get work on any of the remaining daytime soaps. What one has going on for oneself, personally, can play a role in such decision. Ehlers was a professional actress, by then, for a good 30 years. One source said she started in 1978. One said 1981. So, she had a long run. And, yes, I miss her as well. Ehlers was superb. Her acting was realistic and remarkable.\n\nThanks DS for all your interesting findings! Who knew that Beth Ehlers had so many unexpected talents?! There’s no doubt in my mind that she’s been doing a lot of good through her profession in the medical field, which has surely given her a lot of fulfillment but at the same time probably also been very demanding, especially when juggled with family life and two kids. No wonder then she hasn’t been willing or able to commit to any acting offers that may have come her way. A big issue that I’m certain she had to consider when her stints on GL and AMC ended (and this ties in with Freeman’s point earlier, the predicament that many daytime actors living on the East Coast found themselves in once all the shows that were shot there went off the air) was whether or not to relocate to the West Coast. With the few daytime broadcast serials remaining, and the limited amount of acting positions available, it’s understandable that those who already had the stability of an established residence on the East Coast weren’t willing to make such a big move (especially when kids are in the picture) and take a gamble on an uncertain future that would or wouldn’t pay itself out.\n\nIt’s interesting that Ehlers took part in that online series River Ridge back in 2011-12 well before the popularity of the digital series medium really took off (and seemingly became the mecca for a lot of our beloved daytime alums). It was co-produced by Signy Coleman (who also starred in it and I’m sure many still miss from her most memorable role as Hope Adams on Y&R) and featured some new, but also very familiar faces especially to fans of ATWT (Julie Pinson and Jon Prescott). The funny thing is, it was actually shot at a locale over in New Castle not too far from where I live, but that I only found out long after the series had already ended! It would’ve been nice to see it go back into production after it came to what appeared to be an abrupt halt (I’m not sure if that was the original plan all along, for the series to end after only six episodes?) because, given the nature of how ambitious this project was (signing on daytime A-listers and shooting on-location, which is always costly) I got the impression there was more story to tell.\n\nAnyways, the lucrative thing about the digital series of today is that shooting isn’t just restricted to one of the West Coast studios, so there are more options now for actors both in terms of shooting locale and what I’d assume would be greater flexibility with shooting schedule and overall workload. It would be awesome to have Beth Ehlers back on the acting scene. Perhaps we may just see her pop up on one of the popular digital series for a short-term role or a guest stint in the foreseeable future!\n\nSpeaking of Guiding Light, I wonder what Beth Ehlers (who portrayed one of my all-time favorite characters, Harley Cooper) has been up to? Has she retired from acting? It’s been too long since she last graced our screens and would love to see her return to daytime. I miss her (as well as some of my other favorite GL alums like Justin Deas, Tom Pelphrey and Ricky Paull Goldin) so much!\n\nSpeaking of Beth Elhers, I can only speculate but I have a feeling she burned a few bridges within the industry. Specifically when she left “GL” for “AMC” and talked a lot of trash in the press about “GL” and CBS. I don’t remember much of the specifics but I recall that her comments left a lot of people dismayed at her.\n\nMy memory on this is also a bit hazy (it was ten years ago, after all!) but perhaps you’re referring to an interview she did (I forget with whom) at the end of her run at AMC? I recall her mentioning how honored she had felt for being asked to play a disabled Army vet and being involved in the telling of such an important storyline but then how disappointed she was over her character’s eventual pairing with on-screen partner J.R. Martinez, himself a real-life retired Army sergeant who at the time had no prior acting experience and who Ehlers claimed didn’t challenge her enough in his scenes with her. I believe she had likened the situation to something along the lines of a seasoned actor doing Shakespeare on the stage with a complete novice at the craft! I kind of get where she was coming from and personally found the Shakespeare analogy kind of endearing, but I also see how those comments could’ve maybe offended some (especially Martinez). And maybe I missed it, but I don’t really recall any interview she did where she bad-mouthed the times she spent over at GL."
