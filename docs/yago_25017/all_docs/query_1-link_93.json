The character is the adopted son of business mogul, Alan Spaulding, and his first ex-wife, Elizabeth. Phillip has been portrayed by three different actors with Grant Aleksander the most recent to fill this role. Aleksander has been with the show since 1982. He left two years after his first stint on the show in 1984 and returned to \"Guiding Light\" only three years later in 1987. He would then enjoy a five-year run before leaving again in 1991. Five years later, he returned in 1996 and played the role until November 2004 when he was presumably shot dead at the Cooper restaurant, Company.\n\nIn July 2005 however, Phillip was revealed to be alive and well when he was visited by Alan.\n\nAs of 2007 it has been alleged by Phillip's 2nd son Zach Spaulding that he will be making a return. Phillip began sending threatening letters to taunt his ex-wives (only the ones who bore children by him) Harley Cooper, Beth Spaulding Bauer, and Olivia Spencer.\n\nPhillip's Wives\n\nMindy Lewis\n\nPhillip's first wife was Mindy Lewis, daughter of Billy Lewis and his deceased first wife. Mindy originally was the lover of Rick Bauer and Phillip was engaged to Beth Raines. However, after Phillip and Mindy had a one night stand (due in fact to them believing Rick and Beth to have slept together), Mindy became pregnant. Phillip decided to honor the pregnancy and do the right thing by marrying Mindy Lewis in 1984. However, not long after they wedded the marriage crumbled due to Mindy suffering a miscarriage. Phillip had unrenewed feelings for Beth as Mindy still lingered for Rick. Within 6 months time, the couple opted for a divorce which they did amicable in 1985.\n\nIndia von Halkein\n\nOnce again, Phillip was all set to marry the love of his life Beth Raines, but due to his aunt Alexandra Spaulding scheming the Baron Leo von Halkein out of cash, his daughter India arrived in Springfield and began a vendetta against the Spaulding family. Not only did she blackmail Phillip into marriage in 1986, but stole his shares and became an executive on the board of directors. Eventually, when Beth ran off, Phillip tried turning to India, but finding out she turned to his father Alan he called anything serious off. Thanks to Alexandra, Phillip was able to obtain a divorce later that year.\n\nChristina Blake Thorpe\n\nPhillip believed Beth to be dead so he moved on with the scheming Blake Thorpe. They married in January 1987 as Blake and Phillip's marriage immediately began to crumble whhen it appeared beth was alive, Beth and Phillip consumated their love. Phillip divorced Blake later that year who ended up seeking revenge by pursuing his brother Alan-Michael Spaulding.\n\nElizabeth \"Beth\" Raines\n\nFinally, Phillip married the love of his life Beth Raines in late 1990 Beth had already given birth to a healthy baby girl named Lizzie Spaulding and together she and Phillip would leave Springfield. They'd be happy for quite a while and he'd return in 1994 to find outwho framed him for crimes, Phillip moved on with Harley Cooper, but Beth returned. She and Phillip tried to reconnect, but eventually the marriage ultimately failed because of the time apart and they separated in 1995. Beth continued to try and separate Phillip from the woman whom he'd become attached to in Harley Cooper, but they ultimately divorced in 1997 after Beth coxed Lizzie into trying to break her father's new found happiness apart.\n\nHarley Cooper\n\nPhillip married Harley in a surprise family ceremonyby the mayor of New york (rudy giniliani), in 1997. She gave birth to their son Alan cooper spauldingZach as together they faced the return of her daughter Daisy Cooper. The marriage had its shares of ups and downs, but ultimately the couple divorced in 2001 after Phillip made plans to demolish Harley's families resturant, \"Company Diner\".\n\nOlivia Spencer\n\nOlivia Spencer at the time was married to Phillip's father Alan, but after an affair and a pregnancy, Alan kidnapped Olivia and held her away on an island. Phillip rescued her and ultimately with the use of blackmail, Alan gave Olivia a divorce in 2003. Olivia and Phillip continued to court each other until they ultimately married in 2004 when she gave birth to Emma Spencer-Spaulding. Eventually, thanks to Harley, Buzz Cooper, and Frank Cooper, Phillip grew a vendetta against the Cooper family and literally went insane. After having him committed Olivia divorced him and ran with her daughter Emma.\n\nActor history"
