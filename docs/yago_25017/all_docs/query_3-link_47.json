        "text": "The history of Harley & Mallet starts with Harley Davidson Cooper deciding yet another career move, police woman. In the past Harley had been a antique shop owner, a baklava sales rep, fashion designer assistant, and nanny. With those career came some rocky romances from the father of her daughter Daisy, Dylan Lewis to her former husband Alan Michael Spaulding and former fiancï¿½e Josh Lewis. Harley had lived a life that's for sure. But after being mistaken for a prostitute and jailed she decided she'd rather be on the other side of the bars and enrolled in the Springfield Police Academy where she came upon her hard nosed instructor, A.C. Mallet (aka Anthony Camaletti).\n\nA.C. with Detective Levy portrayed by Stuart Ward.\n\nMallet, as he came to be called had been in Springfield for awhile but hadn't discovered Harley as of yet. He came to Springfield from NYC where he was a successful Detective. Unfortunately, a romance with a mobster's daughter, Francesca ended his reign there and sent him running with a new name and straight into the arms of Melinda Sue Lewis. Mindy and Mallet became quick friends and she was the first person he knew in Springfield. Mindy helped her friend Mallet move on after he realized he'd never be with the woman he loved again.\n\nMindy Lewis was portrayed by Kimberley Simms.\n\nMallet was a strict teacher. He resented being made to teach rookies and took it out on them as much as possible, especially a rookie who thought she deserved to be more, Rookie Cooper. Harley desperately wanted to be in some cases already and somehow always found herself where she wasn't supposed to and surprisingly right next to Mallet.\n\nA.C's sister, Julie Camiletti arrives in Springfield.\n\nShe was portrayed by Jocelyn Seagraves.\n\nAudiences immediately picked up on the chemistry between Harley and Mallets' portrayers, Beth Ehlers and Mark Derwin. The public couldn't wait for the pair to hook up.\n\nFinally, while chasing after Dr. Daniel St. John in the cold stretch of woods it happened: Harley was kidnapped and Mallet came to rescue. When Mallet found her she was freezing and delirious. While trying to warm up his rookie Harley made an oh-so-cute comment about her instructor's lips. Mallet took it as delirium, but Harley meant more. She confessed her feelings to her big brother Frank, who also had become a close pal to Mallet.\n\nWeeks of chemistry and more chemistry followed until Harley couldn't take anymore. She left Springfield unhappy with wanting Mallet but not having him want her back, so she headed for Cross Creek. But Mallet had no idea that Harley wanted him, because secretly he had fallen for her too.\n\nWhen Harley disappeared Mallet begged Frank to tell him where Harley had gone, but Frank promised Harley he wouldn't. That is until Frank realized Mallet shared Harley's feelings.\n\nMallet went to Dillon and finally got him to tell him that Harley was at Cross Creek. Mindy also got involved when Harley called her and she covered for Dillon so Harley wouldn't know Mallet was on his way there.\n\nWhen Mallet showed up at the Cross Creek cabin only one thing could follow: passion. Harley and Mallet made love for the first time there in what many remember as Harley and Mallet's best moment. When the couple returned to Springfield, Harley took her police test and passed, but their romance was still a secret since Mallet was still her instructor. But then it couldn't be denied and the couple was official.\n\nThis was one of the best love scenes ever done on Guiding Light\n\nin the 52 years I've listened to and then watched this show.\n\nTo view a whole page devoted to Harley and Mallet at Cross Creek\n\nClick Here.\n\nBut happiness can never last for long on a soap opera. Harley and Mallet then began to work on their first case together much to the dismay of their captain, who wanted Harley as a rookie, but now she had to help. Jenna Bradshaw, international jewel thief had set her sights on the jewels of the Springfield, but Mallet knew her. Or at least recognized her as what she was, a thief; but that wasn't enough to arrest her. Mallet had to catch her in the act.\n\nSo they set up a plan. Jenna had already become interested in Mallet and he used that against her, but he needed someone on the inside so Harley became Jenna's assistant. But while the sting went on Harley & Mallet couldn't be seen together so once again their romance became secret and was confined to a small hotel. After awhile Jenna found out she had been set up, but the couple already had enough to get her. Jenna was caught but in true soap fashion the beautiful temptress got away and reformed herself .\n\nAlan Michael Spaulding portrayed by Rick Hearst in scenes after the bombing.\n\nNote: Rick has recently been featured on Y&R as Matt.\n\nJust when Harley & Mallet thought the rough times were behind them, the worst moment of their romance took place. All at the hands of Harley's former husband and now friend, Alan Michael Spaulding. A-M wanted Eleni Andros, but Eleni wanted Frank Cooper, Harley trustworthy big brother. Eleni had been shipped from Greece to marry Frank, but he wanted no part in it, because he didn't love her. But soon the two really fell for each other but before their passion could be sealed Frank was called away to France. While there A-M set it up so a prostitute named Mussette would sneak into Frank's bed just as Eleni, who A-M sent there to \"surprise\" her love would find them. When she did Frank was out like a light from a \"Mickey\" Mussette slipped him. Eleni was devastated and headed back for the states with A-M. But when she tried to get back into the states she was stopped and called an illegal alien.\n\nBlake Thorpe, Alan Michael's ex-wife portrayed at this time by Sherry Stringfield.\n\nNote: Sherry will be returning to ER once again this fall on NBC. Blake Thorpe, A-M's ex-wife, who was jealous of her ex's lust for the Grecian beauty called the authorities on her. But her plan backfired when on the spot, A-M offered to marry Eleni to keep her in the country. Eleni only believed in marrying someone she loved, but A-M confessed his true feelings and Eleni felt she could grow to love one of her closest friends.\n\nWhen Frank found out A-M's deception and Eleni's marriage he was extremely hurt. Harley & Mallet were upset at A-M for marrying Eleni when he knew how she felt toward Frank. But Eleni grew to deeply love A-M, but his past was coming back to haunt him.\n\nTheir storyline is continued on page 2."
