        "text": "Biography\n\nMarcy Walker (born November 26, 1961) is an American soap opera actress. She was born in Paducah, Kentucky, and grew up in Lancaster, California. Walker graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1978 after only three years enrolled.\n\nIn 1981, she got her first soap job as Liza Colby Chandler Chandler Chandler on All My Children. After a successful three-year run (and two Outstanding Supporting Actress Daytime Emmy nominations, in 1983 and 1984), she decided to leave the show for other opportunities.\n\nLate in 1984, she created yet another popular soap role in the form of Eden Capwell on Santa Barbara. Her character, partnered with A Martinez's character, Cruz, became one of the show's flagship supercouples. She was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress Daytime Emmy awards in 1987 and 1988, with an Emmy win in 1989. She left the serial in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, she started playing the tailor-made role of Tangie Hill on Guiding Light. Fans and the soap press alike found Walker's character too much of an \"inadequate replacement\" for Beth Ehlers's character, Harley Cooper (Ehlers had left the show mere months before Walker was signed on). The character didn't catch on and she left in 1995 to make a comeback as Liza on All My Children. She was nominated for another Outstanding Lead Actress Daytime Emmy award in 2001.\n\nIt was announced that Walker's contract would not be renewed when it expired in 2004. She taped the last of the episodes in her contract in the summer of 2004. Her farewell episode (with an appearance from her character's mother, who is also seldom seen as of late) aired on September 28.\n\nLiza's exit occurred amid rumor that Walker would return to the show on recurring status. This rumor was fueled by the fact that her exit was very open-ended. She was not killed off like some notable fan favorites like Jesse Hubbard (Darnell Williams) or Gillian Lavery (Esta TerBlanche) but rather assumed a new identity and took her daughter to live out of reach of her controlling ex-husband Adam Chandler (David Canary).\n\nAccording to Soap Opera Digest magazine she was at first hesitant to go on recurring status due to the reasons mentioned prior in this article but later warmed to the idea. Liza made a phone call appearance in December 2004 and appeared again in January 2005 when her character assisted Babe Chandler (Alexa Havins) and Jamie Martin (Justin Bruening) in their attempt to flee from Adam's wraith.\n\nWalker has not been seen on-screen since these episodes aired. Headwriter Megan McTavish has spoken to the soap media and publicly thanked Walker for working without a contract but has also hinted that she does not intend for Liza to return to the show any time soon.\n\nShe has been married five times, and is the mother to one son, Taylor, by her third husband. Her second marriage, to actor Billy Warlock, reportedly ended when she walked in on him in bed with another woman, but the rumors have never had a solid basis in reality. In a 1998 interview with Soap Opera Digest she explained the breakup in her own words : \" \"He thought I was somehow higher than him and I could never live it down. I couldn't jump off the pedestal. He was unhappy about everything and I couldn't be happy about anything. I think that Billy is fantastic and, in his heart, he's one of the nicest people that you'll ever meet. It's just that he hasn't been acknowledged a lot in his life and he needs -- and deserves -- a lot of everything. I was just not the person who was able to give it to him. Unfortunately, if you really love someone, you let them know when they're bad as well as when they're good. He needed as much positive reinforcement as he could get and never wanted to hear the negative. I learned that too late, I often played the devil's advocate, thinking I was helping by being honest\". Walker has been married to Doug Smith since 1999, and now goes by the name Marcy Smith in her private life.\n\nIn early 2006, Walker announced she had left her acting career and embarked on a new calling as a children's minister in a North Carolina church.\n\nPersonal Quotes:\n\n\"My real joy is my family life,\" - to Weekly in 1996\n\n\"For anyone who has a control issue, which I definitely do, learning to let go is one of the hardest lessons. I used to feel in relationships I would be the one to fix things. You know, the bigger the cross, the better the day.\" - to Weekly, 1996\n\n\"I've never been a good kiss-ass. I've never been real good politically. I say what I mean and I say what I feel and sometimes, I hurt people and sometimes, I hurt myself.\" - to Digest, 1996\n\n\"Home, playing with Taylor, redoing my address book.\" - to Digest on the perfect evening, 1996\n\n\"I love this medium. I've been in it a lot of years. I've left and I've done other things but nothing has given me the joy that this has. I want to be here.\" - to Digest, 1996\n\n\"It was the [time of] Luke and Laura. Every show had a youth movement happening; it was exploding. People were all over the place celebrating, so to speak.\" - to Digest about drug use on AMC in the early 80s, 1994\n\n\"I've always been so bluntly honest in interviews that, looking back on it, it can be really embarrassing.\" to Digest, 1994\n\n\"I had to constantly downplay everything that was good in my life - my work, how much money I made - because it made him feel bad, it made him feel competitive.\" -to Digest on her marriage to Billy Warlock, 1989\n\n\"I make serious money. My vacation check is double what my dad makes in a year and he's an aeronautical engineer. Sometimes it's a little hard to believe.\" said by Marcy while she was on Santa Barbara\n\n\"I am one of those people who was able to create a really wonderful life before I was ready for it.\" said by Marcy while she was on Guiding Light.\n\n\"If you're are never willing to fail, you're never really ready to succeed.\" said by Marcy while she was on All My Children.\n\n\"As far as a beauty regimen, I really don't have one, besises being a really firm believer in using sopa and water and getting enough rest. When I wake up ugly, I usually just go with it. I try not to go against it, because there are always going to be days when you feel you look better than others\".\n\n\"Working with David Canary and Michael E. Knight is a dream come true...I feel very lucky.\"\n\n\"I thank God every day for the faith and devotion of the audience and for the daily inspiration I gain from watchinf and working with such talented people,\" Walker enthuses, \"It's what gets me through and makes me so proud to still be here.\"\n\n\"To walk back a little older, a little wiser, and much more appreciative, has been wonderful.\" Marcy Walker on her return to AMC.\n\n\"I've never been a good kiss ass. I've never been real good politically. I say what I mean and say what I feel and sometimes, I hurt people and sometimes, I hurt myself.\" Marcy Walker on shmoozing.\n\n\"I think everybody loves to be in love. But now I've come to the point where I say if I don't know what marriage is, I shouldn't be married,\" she says in response to her marital record."
