        "text": "SOAP queen Linda Dano returns to daytime when she begins a six-week guest-starring stint this Friday on “Guiding Light” (10 a.m./Ch. 2).\n\nDano, last seen on a slew of ABC soaps, will play Lena Kendall, a prison lifer serving a murder sentence who befriends Harley Cooper (Beth Ehlers) – who was convicted of murder recently on “GL.”\n\nAccording to TV Guide, viewers will learn that Lena, a failed actress, is “in cahoots” with someone in Springfield – and is purposely keeping tabs on Harley.\n\nDano is slowly re-emerging after the death last fall of her husband, Frank Attardi, sent her into a deep depression.\n\nIn addition to her “GL” stint, Dano will appear in a stage production of “Mame” in June at the Bucks County Playhouse.\n\nShe’s also working on behalf of Support Partners, a depression-support group, which she talked up on CNN’s “Larry King Live” last month.\n\nDano’s illustrious soap career encompasses roles on “Another World,” “As the World Turns,” “General Hospital,” “Port Charles,” “All My Children” and “One Life to Live.”\n\nShe played Gretel Rae Cummings from 1999-2004, appearing as the same character in “One Life to Live,” “All My Children,” “General Hospital” and “Port Charles” (before it was canceled).\n\nDano won an Emmy for playing Felicia Gallant on “Another World,” on which she starred for 17 years, until the show’s cancellation."
