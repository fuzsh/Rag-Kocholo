        "text": "Restores Positive Airway Pressure\n\nThe bias-closed position, no-leak Passy Muir Valve design restores a more normal closed respiratory system, which allows the patient to create positive airway pressure without the need for manual occlusion of the tracheostomy tube. This promotes louder voice, improved swallow, stronger cough, and may increase oxygenation.\n\nSuperior Voice/Speech Production\n\nTracheostomized and ventilator-dependent patients can produce clearer voices with more normal phrasing, better vocal quality, and increased volume because all exhaled airflow is redirected up past the vocal folds.\n\nImproves Swallow & May Reduce Aspiration\n\nThe bias-closed position, no-leak design of the Passy Muir Valve can improve the safety and efficiency of swallowing and may reduce aspiration. The bias-closed position Valve restores the patient to a more normal closed system which facilitates increased pharyngeal and laryngeal sensation and restores positive subglottic air pressure.\n\nRestores Subglottic Pressure\n\nOnly the bias-closed position, no-leak design of the Passy Muir Valve reestablishes a closed respiratory system and restores subglottic pressure, which improves swallowing and may reduce aspiration.\n\nIn-Line Ventilator Use\n\nAdult, pediatric, and neonatal patients on the ventilator may utilize the Passy Muir Valve during mechanical ventilation. All Passy Muir Valves are interchangeable (except the PMV 2020) and can be used both on or off acute-care and portable ventilators.\n\nFacilitates Weaning\n\nPassy Muir Valves are used as an augmentative tool for weaning patients from the ventilator as it reestablishes physiologic PEEP, which in turn may improve oxygenation. As the patient becomes accustomed to exhaling through the upper airway, patient confidence is improved and respiratory muscle retraining is facilitated.\n\nReduces Decannulation Time\n\nPassy Muir Valves may be used as an interim step in the decannulation process by allowing the patient to begin to adjust to a more normal breathing pattern through the upper airway on exhalation. This allows the patient to gain confidence and the physician to assess for airway patency and can significantly shorten the decannulation process.\n\nMay Improve Oxygenation\n\nThe bias-closed position, no-leak design of the Passy Muir Valves restores a more normal closed respiratory system. As a result, Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is reestablished which may facilitate improved oxygenation.\n\nImproves Olfaction\n\nPassy Muir Valves improve the sense of smell by re-establishing airflow through the oral and nasal cavities during exhalation. This improved sense of smell may lead to an increase in sense of taste, appetite, and caloric intake, which are all important in the recovery process.\n\nFacilitates Secretion Management\n\nThe bias-closed position, no-leak design of the Passy Muir Valve facilitates secretion management as it re-establishes a closed system that enables the patient to produce a stronger, more effective cough and improves swallowing due to restored positive subglottic pressure. It also facilitates evaporation of secretions due to the redirection of air through the upper airway during exhalation. As a result, suctioning needs may be reduced.\n\nFacilitates Infection Control\n\nThe Passy Muir Valve eliminates the need for finger occlusion of the tracheostomy tube, which may help prevent infection and offers protection from particulates entering the trachea. The Passy Muir Valve redirects secretions through the upper airway, allowing oral expectoration and reducing contamination of the patientâ€™s immediate environment.\n\nInterchangeability Between Tracheostomy and Ventilator Use\n\nAll Passy Muir Valves, except the PMV 2020, can be used both on and off the ventilator with both pediatric and adult patients. This includes patients with a tracheostomy only, patients who are weaning from the ventilator, and patients who are ventilator-dependent. The Passy Muir Valves can be placed in-line with the ventilator using disposable tubing (with PMV 007 only) or with the PMV-AD22 Flexible Silicone Adapter (with PMV 005, PMV 007, PMV 2000 and PMV 2001)."
