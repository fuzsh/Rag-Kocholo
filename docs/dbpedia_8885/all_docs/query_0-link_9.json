        "text": "Francis Joseph “Frank” Underwood (November 5, 1959 - May 2017) was an American politician and statesman who served as the 46th President of the United States from 2014 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 49th Vice President of the United States under Garrett Walker from 2013 to 2014, and formerly served as the majority whip for the United States House of Representatives between 2005 and 2013, serving South Carolina's 5th district. After his presidency, Underwood served as the First Gentleman of the United States under his wife Claire Hale Underwood from March 2017 until his death in May 2017.\n\nUnderwood was from Gaffney, South Carolina, and had an undistinguished background. He graduated from The Sentinel in 1980 and; subsequently, Harvard Law School in 1984, and married Claire in 1987. Underwood was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990 as a Democratic representative for the 5th Congressional District of South Carolina, being sworn in during January 1991. He won another 11 consecutive elections, winning his final term in 2012. He was elected Whip for the Democratic Party in 2005, serving as House Majority Whip between 2005 and 2013.\n\nUnderwood was passed over for an appointment as United States Secretary of State even though he had been promised the position after ensuring the election of Walker as President, leading to Underwood secretly plotting against him. Underwood uses his position as House Whip to seek retribution, and eventually manipulated his way to becoming the 49th Vice President in 2013 and the 46th President of the United States in 2014, becoming the first president since Gerald Ford to have occupied the offices of Vice President and President of the United States without having been elected to either post.\n\nIn his first term as president, Underwood initiated the landmark America Works jobs program, which lasted for several months until it was defunded by Congress. Underwood also negotiated with Russian President Viktor Petrov to relinquish his hold on the Jordan Valley, by negotiating Claire's resignation as U.N. Ambassador. Underwood has also passed a Gun Control Bill, which was inspired after his assassination attempt in March 2016. Underwood and Claire ran against Republican nominee Will Conway and his running mate Ted Brockhart in the 2016 presidential election. Although neither candidate received a majority of electoral votes, Underwood would go on to win new elections in Ohio, which won him the election, becoming the first Democrat to lose the popular vote but win the electoral college.\n\nUnderwood was sworn in to his second term on February 17, 2017. Underwood's short-lived second term, however, was riddled with scandal. He and his administration was investigated by the Declaration of War committee, which led to his resignation from the presidency on March 15, 2017. He was succeeded by his wife and successor, Claire Hale, with Underwood becoming the First Gentleman and continuing to live in the White House. He died in May 2017 after being poisoned by his right-hand man Doug Stamper, and was buried in South Carolina. Scholars and historians rank Underwood as one of the worst presidents in American history.\n\nEarly life\n\nUnderwood was an only child born on November 5th, 1959. His father was a peach farmer in Gaffney, South Carolina, who died of a heart attack at the age of 43. Underwood has stated that he and his father had nothing in common whatsoever, and upon his father's death, he felt neither regret nor remorse. He also speaks about his father's cowardice, weak personality and drunken behavior.\n\nRaised in impoverished circumstances, he found his hometown suffocating at the time.\n\nUnderwood attended military college at \"The Sentinel\", based on The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. He began attending the academy just after Jimmy Carter had been elected president in 1976. In his senior year, his grades suffered when he volunteered for a U.S. Senate campaign in the fall 1980 and was nearly expelled from the military college. Despite his poor grades, Underwood was accepted and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1984. He had a sexual and romantic relationship while in military college with another cadet, Tim Corbet.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn September 3, 1987, Underwood married Claire Hale. Although Claire was interested in having children, Underwood soon decided that it would be cruel to bring a child into a world of pain.\n\nClaire became pregnant during Underwood's early campaigning years, but the child was aborted to help further Underwood's political career. In 2014, Claire declares in a TV interview that she had the abortion because she was impregnated from being raped by her boyfriend early in college, a man who later became a decorated general; this, however, is a lie, as the rape did not result in pregnancy.\n\nEarly political career\n\nSouth Carolina State Legislature\n\nUnderwood was first elected to public office in 1984 at the age of 25 as a member for the South Carolina State Senate, as one of the youngest state legislators in state history. He was re-elected in 1988 before successfully running for Congress.\n\nEarly Congressional Career\n\nUnderwood was first elected as U.S. Representative from South Carolina's 5th congressional district in 1990 and was sworn into office in January of 1991. He has since served for 12 terms, winning re-election for his 12th term in 2012. Underwood steadily rose to higher power within Congress, eventually becoming the House Majority Whip for the Democratic Party in 2005. (Chapter 1)\n\nRun-up to becoming president\n\nSecretary of State Passover\n\nWhile beginning to announce his ideas to White House Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez for when he becomes Secretary of State, Vasquez informs Underwood that President Garrett Walker had passed him up for the position, breaking a promise that he had made to Underwood and angering him. This led to him attempting to bring down the nominee for Secretary of State, Michael Kern, an incompetent politician, and replacing him with a person he deemed a tougher, smarter candidate: Catherine Durant.\n\nUnderwood begins his overture by orchestrating a fall from grace by Kern. Through Peter Russo, a morally torn congressman, Underwood is able to manipulate a drug addicted editor of the Kern's former college newspaper. Kern is then pelted by media for a piece he allegedly authored regarding the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. This subsequent negative media attention leads the President to select someone else, a personal friend of Underwood's, Catherine Durant, Senator from Louisiana.\n\nPeter Russo for Governor\n\nTaking the young representative under his wing, Underwood seemingly grooms Peter Russo for Governor of Pennsylvania. He asks Russo to give him one month of sobriety, not for Underwood, but himself. While it does appear that Underwood truly wishes for Peter Russo to succeed, he knows his true plan will not come to fruition if he actually wins. Underwood and the campaign team decide to portray him as a phoenix, in some respects; an alcoholic who was once at the very bottom of his life, now arisen from the ashes, via his children's and God's love. He pretends to be open with his former addictions and problems, but reveals only a small portion of his past. However, this does not work and voters slowly start turning away and losing interest.\n\nPeter eventually manages to gain trust and respect in his state, first by partnering with his old friend with the unions, then by putting the Vice President in his place after he (the beloved former Governor of Pennsylvania) begins meddling in the campaign. However, he eventually relapses due to Doug Stamper's influence in the reappearance of the call girl, Rachel Posner, who Russo was previously associated with. Russo even had another short affair with an unnamed male prostitute that was hinted to be under aged. The morning after Peter relapses, he absolutely ruins a morning radio show where he is clearly drunk and confused. With the election thus slipping from Russo's grasp (as Underwood knew would occur and cleverly planned for), Underwood quickly takes control of the situation and implies the Vice President could take back the governorship of the state. Underwood then murders Russo, planting it as a suicide, either accidental or not, by carbon monoxide poisoning when he realizes Russo is out of control and is no longer afraid of Underwood.\n\nWorking with Zoe Barnes\n\nUnderwood sent an e-mail to journalist Zoe Barnes containing the photo along with a snide comment \"If you want 'em to take you seriously, maybe wear more than a g-string?\". Not knowing the identity of the man looking at her derrière in the photo, she looked him up, realizing he's a Democratic congressman from South Carolina, Frank Underwood, who's also the House Majority Whip. Barnes then found out where he lives and decided to came to his door, managing to get him to let her in based on their opera photo that she showed him.\n\nWhen she first started submitting reports based on Underwood's leaked info, she began to alienate her coworkers at the Herald with her rogue and mildly arrogant attitude, and unintentionally steals Janine Skorsky's position as White House Correspondent. She eventually leaves the Herald due to a conflict with her superior and joins Slugline. She finally teams up with Skorsky after both had left the Herald; despite their professional competition, they respect each other's work ethic and have the same goals in mind. Both end up at Slugline and together they unearth the hidden details regarding Russo's DUI cover-up and his death.\n\nWith the help of Skorsky and Lucas Goodwin, Barnes tries to uncover the truth behind the death of Peter Russo. While Russo's death was officially ruled a suicide, the team of journalists correctly suspected that the Congressman's death involved foul play and that Underwood was involved. Underwood requests a clandestine meeting with her and prior to their meeting, she learns some crucial details that suggest Russo was murdered; he was found on the passenger side of the car in which he was presumed to be alone, killing himself via carbon monoxide.\n\nAt a public park, Barnes meets Underwood and is coerced to drop her suspicions idiocy and start anew, stating that her connection to a powerful figure would be increasingly valuable to her own gain. When she asks Underwood about Russo being found on the passenger side, he quickly deflects her suspicions. Underwood admits to covering up Russo's DUI, but claims that the cover-up is the extent of his involvement and that his death was without question a suicide. By the end of their meeting, the embattled journalist is clearly leaning toward teaming with Underwood again due to the fact that he is now in a much more powerful position and that her investigation is an uphill battle. As Barnes and her team continue to dig for information, she appears to doubt her own suspicions and brings up details that stand in the way of Underwood's involvement. She swiftly leaves the meeting and expresses a desire to be alone, or more importantly, isolate herself from Skorsky and Goodwin.\n\nEducation Bill\n\nMeanwhile, Underwood gains publicity with a controversial education bill. The bill makes teachers go on strike and they begin to riot over the contents. He makes a damaging appearance on a news debate with Marty Spinella. Underwood himself even admits that Spinella \"schooled\" him. It is later mentioned that memes and a techno song were created because of Underwood's performance.\n\nEither way, after the debate Underwood takes charge and garners support when a child dies during school hours. He arranged a meeting with Spinella to come to a compromise which Underwood had promised. Once they arrive at the meeting though Underwood declares that does not plan to compromise. He provokes Spinella into punching him and Underwood makes him end the strike or he will file charges. Allowing Underwood's bill to pass.\n\nVice Presidential Attempt\n\nAfter Underwood secures an open spot in the Pennsylvania Governorship race by killing Peter Russo, he begins to influence the Vice President Jim Matthews to run. Previously, he had gotten Jim Matthews to campaign with Peter Russo, where he (the Vice President) was reintroduced to the love and adulation of a constituency that loved him. This reminded the Vice President of his glory days as a politician, the glory days that had not continued in his Vice Presidency. Knowing that he was unhappy, and very eager to feel important once more, as well as having freed up a space for Governor, Underwood suggests the Vice President as Governor. The President and V.P. heartily agree, a decision further amounted to, because of an evident dislike for one another. Underwood ensures they are both aware of this mutual dislike, by mentioning their comments told in confidence to him, to the other.\n\nAs the V.P. campaigns for the certain victory, Underwood and White House Chief of Staff, Linda Vasquez, create a fake list of Vice Presidential nominees.The nominees are incompetent and definitely not appropriate. This leads the President to become desperate and be ready to say yes to anything. They cross off every name, as they attempt to build up to Underwood becoming the Vice President.\n\nAfter being vetted by billionaire business magnate Raymond Tusk, a confidant and old friend of the President, Walker officially offered Underwood the Vice Presidency, which Underwood quickly and heartily accepted. Meanwhile, Underwood's phone, left at home, rang as Doug attempted to inform him of Barnes' betrayal.\n\nUnderwood eventually had a few discussions with Barnes, before meeting with her in a subway station. After having her erase their digital history together, she began to question and probe the death of Peter Russo. With her becoming too close to discovering his scheme, Underwood threw her in front of an oncoming train, killing her. The calculated locale of the murder as well as the deleted contact information ensure that the death appears to be an accident.\n\nVice Presidency (2013 - 2014)\n\nWay of Money\n\nAs Vice President, Underwood first set out to sever the close ties and drive a wedge between Walker and Tusk. He did this by back channelling with China regarding the building of a Port Jefferson Bridge and successfully lobbied the President to go against Tusk's interests in the project.\n\nTusk started guiding his money to the Republicans and Underwood ordered Seth Grayson to assist a reporter in revealing Xander Feng's connections to the money. The ensuing investigation led to Tusk's implication of Walker and Walker's resignation. Underwood ensured that Jackie Sharp whipped up enough votes for impeachment in the house by having Claire rework the Military Sexual Assault bill and he convinced Michael Kern to help him whip votes in the Senate by hinting at an eventual nomination as Secretary of the Treasury. With connection to China exposed, Walker was trapped and resigned his presidency.\n\nPresidency (2014 - 2017)\n\nUnderwood was promptly sworn in as President, becoming the first president since Gerald Ford to have occupied the offices of Vice President and President of the United States without having been elected to either post.\n\nFirst term\n\nPardons\n\nPrior to his inauguration as President, Underwood offered two people presidential pardons: Raymond Tusk and former President Garrett Walker.\n\nThe pardon offered to Tusk was for his co-operation in not naming Underwood in his testimony given to the House Judiciary Committee. Tusk initially rejected the pardon offered by Underwood, but when the pardon offered to Tusk by Walker was rescinded, Tusk testified against Walker while not naming Underwood, just as Underwood initially requested.\n\nUnderwood also promised then-President Garrett Walker that Walker would never see the inside of a jail, indicating he would use a presidential pardon on the former president if necessary. Following his inauguration, Underwood followed through with his promises by pardoning Walker and Tusk.\n\nA Rocky Start\n\nUnderwood's first act as President was to renounce the asylum of Xander Feng, resulting in his deportation back to China and almost certain execution. Within a week of taking office, the Republicans gained a majority in the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nAmerica Works\n\nAs his presidency was off to a rocky start, Underwood, in an attempt to reverse his poor approval numbers, begins working on a program designed to bring unemployment to virtually undetectable levels, a program called America Works.\n\nIn April 2015, Underwood, under pressure from congressional leadership to not run for the nomination, made an address to the American people, stating he would not run for re-election in the 2016 presidential election, and would spend the rest of his term trying to make a difference, including initiating America Works. The ultimate aim of the legislation is to create full employment across the United States, with Underwood desiring its scope to be as wide as that of the New Deal. It plans on reducing entitlements from both Social Security and welfare, instead focusing on putting Americans into full-time work.\n\nTo show what it could accomplish, he contacted District of Columbia Mayor Barney Hull to declare a \"State of Emergency\" in DC due to rapid unemployment, allowing Underwood to send FEMA money into AmWorks, allowing 40,000 unemployed people to get jobs.\n\nThe program was met with opposition from both parties, including Bob Birch, Hector Mendoza, and Mendoza's replacement Henry Mitchell. When Congress refused to pass and fund the program, Underwood utilized a clause in the Stafford Act and declared unemployment in Washington, D.C. an 'emergency'. He additionally fired Secretary of Homeland Security Steven Travers, and threatened Arnold Silva, allowing him to use funds from the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund to finance a pilot program in DC.\n\nIn response to this, the Republican-controlled Congress began drafting a bill that amended the Stafford Act and would make Underwood's use of FEMA money illegal. This was not needed, as in the wake of Hurricane Faith, Underwood was forced to sign an agreement that would replenish the DRF, on the condition none of it was used to further fund America Works.\n\nDespite the program being put on hiatus, the successes in Washington, D.C. made America Works a vital rallying point throughout Underwood's campaign for the Iowa Caucus. Underwood uses the objections of Heather Dunbar and Jackie Sharp to his advantage, presenting himself as dedicated to reducing unemployment. Considering Underwood's victory in the primaries, and later the general election, the program could potentially survive in the future.\n\nRussian Tensions\n\nUnderwood hosted his first state dinner with a world leader on May 6, 2015, the President of Russia Viktor Petrov. Underwood and Petrov used the visit to discuss an American troop movement to the Jordan Valley. Petrov says that he will only support the American troop movement to the Jordan Valley if the US will dismantle their air defense system in Europe. After some consideration, Underwood refuses the offer and holds a press conference stating that the US will achieve peace in the Middle East with or without a partnership with Russia.\n\nIn July 2015, Underwood launched the America Works program during July 4th weekend in Washington D.C. That same month, Underwood and Claire visited Viktor Petrov in Russia to negotiate the return of Michael Corrigan, a gay man who was arrested for protesting Petrov. Despite urging from Claire to read a forged apology, Corrigan hung himself in his jail cell, prompting Claire to publicly shame Petrov.\n\nUnderwood goes to the Jordan valley to meet with Petrov months later, and Petrov agrees to relinquish control of the Jordan Valley if Claire steps down as ambassador to the United Nations. Claire ultimately steps down, though this strains the relationship between Claire and Underwood.\n\n2016 Democratic primaries\n\nIn September 2015, Underwood announced he would run for the Democratic nomination, despite claiming that he would not earlier that year. He ran against Heather Dunbar and Jackie Sharp.\n\nAt the first primary debate in December 2015, Underwood, who was collaborating with Sharp, faced fierce criticism from Dunbar. Days later, Jackie withdrew her candidacy and endorsed Dunbar for President. As Dunbar continued to gain traction, Underwood discovered that Dunbar had a journal, claiming that Claire lied about having an abortion, which was given to her by Doug. Doug, however, burns the journal.\n\nTension continues to grow between Claire and Underwood, just as the Iowa caucus approaches. Underwood comes out on top in the Iowa caucus, though Dunbar vows to fight on.\n\nThe day after Underwood's Iowa victory, Claire says that she is leaving Underwood, and flies to Texas to stay with her mother. Underwood, while in New Hampshire, continues his campaign under much stress without Claire. Often he would fantasize or dream about beating Claire. Into a mirror he would throw her, creating cracks. She pulls a piece of the broken mirror and stabs Underwood in the gut.\n\nUnderwood flies to Texas to check in on Claire, and uses his mother-in-law's cancer as an alibi for going to the state. Underwood loses New Hampshire to Dunbar that night.\n\nClaire states her intention to run for a congressional race in Texas. During the 2016 State of the Union address, Underwood endorses another candidate, preventing Claire from announcing her candidacy. Claire, in retaliation, finds a photo of Underwood's father with a KKK klansman, costing him the South Carolina primary. Claire tells Underwood she wants to be his running mate or she will announce publicly that they are getting a divorce.\n\nAssassination Attempt\n\nOn March 17, 2016, Underwood attended Hammond University in Washington D.C. to give a speech. During the speech, he mentioned his intent to greet a crowd of protestors, saying diverse ideas make people wiser.\n\nAfter speaking to the crowd inside, Underwood went out to greet the protestors. After roughly 30 seconds of greeting protestors, Underwood was shot twice by Lucas Goodwin. One of the bullets hit and later killed Edward Meechum. Meechum returned fire, shooting Goodwin several times as he collapsed. Goodwin was killed as well.\n\nAfter the assassination attempt, Underwood was rushed to Jefferson Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C. Claire was in Texas at the time, and flew to D.C. immediately. Blythe was authorized as Acting President of the United States at 12:38 pm. Underwood remained in the hospital for nine days, and was released on March 26, where he resumed all the duties of the presidency.\n\nThe assassination attempt also marked a turning point for Underwood's campaign, with public sympathy and revelations about a connection between Goodwin and Dunbar now giving him the advantage in the Democratic primary. Weeks earlier, Dunbar had a meeting with Goodwin while she was campaigning in Ohio. With no way out, Dunbar withdrew her candidacy on May 16, allowing Underwood to become the presumptive nominee of the party.\n\n2016 presidential election\n\nAfter making a full recovery from the assassination attempt, Underwood believes that he and Claire are stronger together, and fully supports her effort to become Vice President.\n\nTo do this, Underwood sets a plan in motion, the first step being to get Vice President Blythe to agree not to seek the position of running mate at the Convention. In the midst of looking for a running mate, Underwood proposes a Gun Control Bill to congress, and uses one of his running mate contenders to vote for the bill. Underwood eventually convinces the party leadership to not announce a candidate and to hold an open convention.\n\nDuring the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Underwood publicly endorsed Catherine Durant for the position of running mate, but was secretly supporting Claire. After pulling strings with superdelegates, the votes stack up with Claire. Catherine Durant announces that she is withdrawing at the stage, and encourages the delegates to vote for Claire. Claire becomes the nominee for the vice president.\n\nDuring the DNC voting, Conway calls Underwood out for his failure to act on the terrorist group ICO. Underwood decides to meet with Conway to call his bluff. The private meeting results in no change of policy, but instead a tense conversation. Conway reminds Underwood he is behind in the polls by double digits and says that Underwood is desperate to win.\n\nWith just weeks until the election, Hammerschmidt meets with Underwood to get a comment on his story, which tells the truth of Underwood's rise to power. Though it has no factual evidence, it does have the word of Walker, Jackie Sharp, and Remy Danton.\n\nUnderwood hammers down on ICO. After a hostage crisis escalates, Underwood announces that he is going to war with terror as a fear tactic to win the election. Having given up on negotiating, one of the hostages is killed as a result, with Underwood and Claire staring coldly at the horrific footage.\n\nUnderwood demands that Congress declare war formally on ICO. However, he does not receive much support.\n\nOn election night, the Underwood camp is concerned when voter turnout is worryingly low. Underwood, however, insists that they are not going anywhere, and forges terrorist threats in an attempt to get states to not certify their election results. He is successful as Ohio and Tennessee refuse, as neither Underwood nor Conway receive 270 votes.\n\nMonths later, Congress is to vote on President. However, neither Underwood nor Conway receive a majority of votes there, so the Senate chooses the Vice President, who will automatically assume to the Presidency until Congress votes again. In the Senate, Claire is chosen, and is sworn in as Acting President on January 20, 2017.\n\nClaire convinces Mark Usher, of the Conway campaign, to support holding new elections in Ohio and Tennessee, rather than letting Congress decide. Usher agrees. After spending a weekend at an elite getaway known as Elysian Fields, Underwood is given an incriminating tape of Conway. Underwood collaborates with Usher to win Ohio and Tennessee, winning him the election.\n\nSecond term\n\nUnderwood was officially sworn into his second term on February 17, 2017, the first time that a presidential inauguration had not occurred on January 20th. Claire became his Vice President.\n\nDamaging Depositions\n\nShortly after being sworn into his second term, the committee that was investigating Underwood's declaration of war is revived to investigate Underwood, an act by Congressman Alex Romero after being snubbed in Underwood's inaugural address.\n\nUnderwood is informed that Garrett Walker will be testifying before the committee. Though he is expected to plead the fifth, tension arises when Underwood and Walker meet before he testifies. Walker testifies and breaks his silence, revealing that Underwood was the one who got Walker involved in the China/money dealings.\n\nThe next day, Hammerschmidt discovers leaked information: that the White House staged a terrorist attack on Election Day. Seth panics in his office while Underwood discusses spying on all White House personnel to find out who the leak is. Underwood is confronted by Bob Birch and Terry Womack, who want Underwood to consider the idea of resigning. Underwood is speechless, partially because Womack himself is under investigation.\n\nAn article breaks the next day: that a source from within the White House confirmed that Underwood used questionable intelligence to close voting centers on election day. Underwood confronts Cathy about this, who is cooperating with Alex Romero.\n\nUnderwood later states that he believes Cathy is the leak, and that he has held on to her resignation.\n\nNews breaks that Cathy will testify in front of the Declaration of War committee. Hammerschimdt is given a \"birthday card\" with a computer chip in it from an unknown source.\n\nIn the Executive Residence, Underwood tries to convince Cathy to not testify, to no avail. Underwood then pushes Cathy down a flight of stairs, and calls for help, claiming she's fallen. Cathy is hospitalized and thus prevented from testifying in front of the Declaration of War committee.\n\nUnderwood is informed that Hammerschmidt is investigating the death of Zoe Barnes, and believes that it is not an accident. This prompts him to throw Doug under the bus.\n\nResignation\n\nLeAnn and Nathan Green give their testimony. Underwood, watching, debates whether he should go down and give his testimony. While he is urged not to, Underwood goes to the committee and testifies. Underwood admits to doing nothing wrong, but claims to respects the office of the presidency to allow the investigation to go on. As a result, he announces he will resign the following day.\n\nClaire is furious that Underwood announced he would resign without consulting her before. Underwood states that this was the only way out, and that everything has gone according to his plan, a plan that was developed at Elysian Fields. Underwood plans on holding on to power with Underwood on the outside in the private sector and Claire on the inside in the White House. Underwood also reveals that he was the leak, and has been working with Doug to feed Hammerschmidt information. Underwood says that Claire will have to pardon him and Doug, however.\n\nUnderwood talks to Claire and asks about why she hasn't moved forward on his pardon. Claire says that she will pardon him when the time is right. Underwood signs his resignation. That afternoon, in the Oval Office, Claire is sworn in as the 47th President of the United States.\n\nPost-Presidency (2017)\n\nAs the husband of President Claire, Underwood became the First Gentleman and continued to live in the White House. Shortly after the end of his presidency, Underwood was interested in starting a foundation and turned toward Bill Shepherd and Annette Shepherd.\n\nDeath\n\nOn a night in May 2017, Underwood was drunk and came over to the Executive Residence with the intention of killing Claire. However, realizing Underwood killing Claire would destrory his legacy, Doug gave Underwood a lethal dose of his liver medication. Underwood died in his bed in the Executive Residence that night. He was buried in South Carolina.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nFrank Underwood was portrayed by Kevin Spacey in Seasons 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of House of Cards. He is depicted as a ruthless politician who rises from United States House of Representatives majority whip to president of the United States through treachery, deception and murder. He is based on Francis Urquhart, the protagonist of the British novel and television series House of Cards, from which the American Netflix series is drawn. He is married to Claire Underwood (Robin Wright), who later made the decision to revert to her maiden name; Claire Hale.\n\nSome of Underwood's dialogue throughout the series is presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique that breaks the fourth wall. The character speaks with a Southern accent. During season 1, he is the Democratic Majority Whip in the United States House of Representatives. In season 2, he is the newly appointed Vice President of the United States, before achieving his ambitious goal, and becoming President of the United States in the season finale.\n\nUnderwood has been described as conniving, Machiavellian, sociopathic, and a symbol of political corruption. Throughout the series, he manipulates and destroys several people, including those he calls friends, for his own ends. Among other crimes, he personally commits murder twice, signs off on another murder committed by a subordinate, orders the deaths of two former employees, critically injures a member of his cabinet to prevent her testifying against him, and indirectly allows the murder of a civilian for political ends.\n\nSpacey has received positive reviews for his portrayal of Underwood, but the character itself has been criticized for its repetitive nature and one-dimensionality. Spacey was one of the first three actors playing leading roles in web-television series to be nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Spacey has also been nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, winning one, and five Screen Actors Guild Awards, including two cast nominations and including two wins, for his performances.\n\nOn November 3, 2017, following sexual assault claims made against Spacey, Netflix cut ties with the actor, putting the character's fate in question. In a teaser trailer for the sixth season of House of Cards, it is shown that Underwood died in 2017 and is now buried next to his father in South Carolina. The series finale reveals that Underwood had planned to kill Claire as revenge for abandoning him, and that Stamper poisoned him to stop him from being publicly exposed as a murderer, to \"protect the legacy from the man\". Spacey reprised his role of Underwood in three Christmas videos released in 2018, 2019, and 2020.\n\nAppearances\n\nSeason 1 \"Chapter 1\" \"Chapter 2\" \"Chapter 3\" \"Chapter 4\" \"Chapter 5\" \"Chapter 6\" \"Chapter 7\" \"Chapter 8\" \"Chapter 9\" \"Chapter 10\" \"Chapter 11\" \"Chapter 12\" \"Chapter 13\"\n\nSeason 2 \"Chapter 14\" \"Chapter 15\" \"Chapter 16\" \"Chapter 17\" \"Chapter 18\" \"Chapter 19\" \"Chapter 20\" \"Chapter 21\" \"Chapter 22\" \"Chapter 23\" \"Chapter 24\" \"Chapter 25\" \"Chapter 26\"\n\nSeason 3 \"Chapter 27\" \"Chapter 28\" \"Chapter 29\" \"Chapter 30\" \"Chapter 31\" \"Chapter 32\" \"Chapter 33\" \"Chapter 34\" \"Chapter 35\" \"Chapter 36\" \"Chapter 37\" \"Chapter 38\" \"Chapter 39\"\n\nSeason 4 \"Chapter 40\" \"Chapter 41\" \"Chapter 42\" \"Chapter 43\" \"Chapter 44\" \"Chapter 45\" \"Chapter 46\" \"Chapter 47\" \"Chapter 48\" \"Chapter 49\" \"Chapter 50\" \"Chapter 51\" \"Chapter 52\"\n\nSeason 5 \"Chapter 53\" \"Chapter 54\" \"Chapter 55\" \"Chapter 56\" \"Chapter 57\" \"Chapter 58\" \"Chapter 59\" \"Chapter 60\" \"Chapter 61\" \"Chapter 62\" \"Chapter 63\" \"Chapter 64\" \"Chapter 65\"\n\nOther appearances\n\nLet Me Be Frank\n\nOn December 24, 2018, the same day that Spacey was charged with indecent assault and battery, he posted an unofficial short film continuation of House of Cards titled Let Me Be Frank to his YouTube channel. In the video, Spacey addressed the audience as Underwood, obliquely referred to the sexual assault allegations, and hinted that his character may not be dead.\n\nKTWK\n\nOn December 24, 2019, Spacey posted a follow-up short film to Let Me Be Frank titled KTWK to his YouTube channel, once again in-character as Frank Underwood. He wishes the world a \"Merry Christmas\", comments on it having been a \"pretty good year\", and says, \"The next time someone does something you don't like, you can go on the attack. But you can also hold your fire and do the unexpected. You can ... kill them with kindness.\"\n\n1-800 XMAS\n\nOn December 24, 2020, Spacey posted a third Christmas Eve video, titled \"1-800 XMAS\", in which he spoke in Underwood's accent before breaking character and speaking in his natural voice. He then expressed sympathy for people struggling amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and promoted two suicide and substance abuse hotlines.\n\nPersonality\n\nUnderwood is utterly ruthless and Machiavellian, and is willing to commit any crime, including murder, to further his goal of attaining power. He is a patient, cold, duplicitous, cunning, and ruthless politician that knows exactly how to take what he wants. Almost machine-like in his approach, he is known to be \"extremely effective at what he sets his mind to\" according to the likes of Raymond Tusk. Displayed as a power-hungry man with the skills and the resources to match, his quest for power and vengeance leads him to break old alliances and trample on and destroy those that stand in his way. We later learn that he is even willing to kill those who become a threat, as shown through his murder of Peter Russo after he threatened to expose Underwood along with himself and Zoe Barnes when she realises that Underwood murdered Russo. He is a more than capable political maneuverer and can act warm, jolly and caring to people to gain their trust. He has no qualms of killing people or ruining their lives and careers if it serves his goals.\n\nDespite these traits, Underwood can be warm and gentle to those he truly cares about, particularly to Claire Underwood and to a lesser extent Zoe Barnes. He protects and takes care of those around him such as Doug and Steve and Edward Meechum, his bodyguards. With fellow schemers and politicians who understand his game, he has a definite respect for, such as Catherine Durant or Raymond Tusk. However, they can very easily become his enemies if they interfere with his plans. With others who are oblivious to his intentions or less intelligent, he adopts a different façade, acting more caring and generous than he really is to mask his true personality.\n\nMany critics have described him as a sociopath with psychopathic tendencies and as \"pure evil\". Often, Underwood's thoughts throughout the series are presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique known as breaking the fourth wall. Immediately prior to starring in House of Cards, Spacey had starred in a production of William Shakespeare's Richard III as Richard III of England, a character that serves as a partial basis for both Urquhart and Underwood. His last name is derived from Oscar Underwood, who served as the first Democratic House Minority Whip from about 1900 to 1901. His few vices include smoking cigarettes and playing video games; when the Secret Service cuts off his online gaming service after he becomes Vice President, he takes up creating model figurines.\n\nSpacey viewed portraying Underwood for a second season as a continuing learning process. \"There is so much I don't know about Francis, so much that I'm learning... I've always thought that the profession closest to that of an actor is being a detective... We are given clues by writers... Then you lay them all out and try to make them come alive as a character who's complex and surprising, maybe even to yourself.\"\n\nSexuality\n\nUnderwood's sexuality is ambiguous throughout much of the first two seasons; he has sexual liaisons with both men and women, but he is never explicitly identified by any sexual label. Before Season 2, various sources speculated about his homosexuality. It is revealed in \"Chapter 8\" he had an experience with homosexuality in college. Underwood and Claire are never depicted having sex in season 1. In season 2, Underwood is involved in a threesome with Claire and Secret Service agent Edward Meechum (Nathan Darrow), while in season 3, there is a moment of sexual tension between Underwood and his biographer, Tom Yates (Paul Sparks), who later embarks in a physical and romantic emotional relationship with Claire. The same season, however, also features the only scene in the series in which Underwood and Claire have sex exclusively with each other. In season five, he has sex with Eric Rawlings (Malcolm Madera), his male personal trainer.\n\nRelationships\n\nRelationship with Claire Underwood\n\nUnderwood and Claire engage in a threesome with their Secret Service bodyguard Edward Meechum at one point in season 2, but have otherwise largely given up intramarital and extramarital sex in favor of their pursuit of power. Avoiding sex may retain the balance of power in their relationship. His relationship with Claire is the epicenter of season 2.\n\nRelationship with Zoe Barnes\n\nUnderwood develops an intimate relationship with Washington Herald and Slugline reporter Zoe Barnes, with Claire's knowledge. As the show begins, Barnes is desperate to rise from covering the Fairfax County Council beat to covering what's going on \"behind the veil of power in the Capitol hallways.\" By the end of the first episode, Barnes is among the cadre of Underwood's accomplices. They begin a relationship, with Barnes promising to earn his trust and not \"ask any questions\" in return for his supplying her with sensitive political information. Toward the end of Season 1, she ends their personal relationship and begins investigating his connection to the apparent suicide of Congressman Peter Russo (Underwood had in fact killed him by flooding his car with carbon monoxide while the Congressman was passed out drunk). Underwood ultimately kills Barnes in the season 2 premiere, by pushing her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train after she begins to follow clues related to the murder.\n\nRelationship with Edward Meechum\n\nUnderwood is fond of the head of his Secret Service detail, Edward Meechum, and it is hinted several times that they harbor unacknowledged sexual feelings for each other. When Meechum stumbles upon Underwood watching pornography, Underwood and Claire joke about there being sexual chemistry between the two men. Shortly after Underwood becomes vice president, he, Claire and Meechum have a threesome.\n\nMeechum remains Underwood's bodyguard once he becomes the president, and there does not appear to be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.\n\nWhen Lucas Goodwin shoots Underwood during a campaign event, Meechum trades fire with the would-be assassin, and both die at the scene. Meechum's death is one of the tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill she is sponsoring, and Underwood has him buried in Arlington National Cemetery, a rare privilege for a Secret Service agent. When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum's hand tracing has been painted over, he expresses grief and regret at the loss to Claire, who says that Meechum was one of the few people who truly understood them.\n\nUnderwood-Urquhart comparisons\n\nUnderwood is an Americanized version of the original BBC series lead character Francis Urquhart, a Machiavellian post-Margaret Thatcher Chief Whip of the Conservative Party, portrayed by Ian Richardson. Urquhart employs deceit, cunning, murder, and blackmail to influence and pursue the office of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. According to series producer Beau Willimon, the change in last name stemmed from the \"Dickensian\" feeling and \"more legitimately American\" sounding resonance of the name 'Underwood'. Whereas Urquhart is an aristocrat by birth, Underwood is a self-made man, having been born into a poor Southern family with an alcoholic father. Urquhart was one of television's first antiheroes, whereas Underwood follows the more recent rash of antiheroes that includes Tony Soprano of The Sopranos, Walter White of Breaking Bad, and Dexter Morgan of Dexter. However, unlike most other antiheroes, Underwood is not forced into immorality either by circumstance (White), birth (Soprano) or upbringing (Morgan). Although the character is based on the BBC show's lead character, in interviews during the writing and filming of season 2, creator and showrunner Willimon said that he used Lyndon B. Johnson as a source of themes and issues addressed in House of Cards. Unlike the right wing Urquhart, who leads the Conservative Party, Underwood is a member of the Democratic Party, but cares little for ideology in favor of \"ruthless pragmatism\" in furthering his own political influence and power.\n\nBreaking the fourth wall\n\nSpacey summed up Underwood's relationship with the viewer—i.e. whenever he breaks the fourth wall—as being like that of a \"best friend\" and \"the person [he trusts] more than anyone.\" Because of this, his asides to the viewer serves as an indication of Underwood's true feelings and intentions—typically when he is feigning politeness and courtesy to people whom he despises. In the season 2 premiere, after having gone the whole episode without doing so, Underwood addresses the viewer directly, saying, \"Did you think I had forgotten you? Perhaps you hoped I had.\" In addition, in season 3, after an argument with Claire that ends with her storming out on him, a seething Underwood vents his anger by lashing out at the viewer; looking directly into the camera, he snaps \"What're you lookin' at?!\"\n\nFor the first four seasons, Underwood was the only character to break the fourth wall until the very end of the fourth season, during which Claire—though silent—addresses the camera directly with him. In the fifth season, Claire also addresses the camera directly, on one occasion explaining that she had always known the viewer was there, but didn't know if she could trust them. At the end, after usurping the Presidency from Underwood and deciding not to grant him a pardon, she looks into the camera again and states \"My turn.\"\n\nQuotes\n\n\"There are two types of pain: The sort of pain that makes you strong, or useless pain...the sort of pain that's only suffering. I have no patience for useless things. Moments like this require someone who will act. Who will do the unpleasant thing, the necessary thing. There. No more pain.\"\n\n\"Oh.

For too long, we in Washington have been lying to you. We say we're here to serve you when in fact, we're serving ourselves. And why? We are driven by our own desire to get re-elected. Our need to stay in power eclipses our duty to govern. That ends tonight. Tonight, I give you the truth. And the truth is this: the American Dream has failed you. Work hard, play by the rules? You aren't guaranteed success. Your children will not have a better life than you did. Ten million of you can't even get a job, even though you desperately want one. We've been crippled by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, by welfare, by entitlements... and that is the root of the problem: entitlements. Let me be clear: You are entitled to nothing. You are entitled to nothing. America was built on the spirit of industry. You build your future, it isn't handed to you. And the problem with Washington is that we haven't given you the tools to build it. The only way for us to serve you is to give you the means to serve yourselves. That's exactly what I intend to do. Not handouts - jobs. Real paying jobs. In the next few weeks, the Democratic leadership will introduce a bill called America Works. Its goal is simple: to put the ten million Americans who are unemployed to work. All of them. If you want a job, you get one. The cost is $500 billion. Now, that's a lot of money. To pay for it, we'll have to rethink Social Security, health care, and benefits from the ground up. We can't maintain the welfare state as we know it. Now, that's not a popular thing to say. Anyone running for office wouldn't dare utter those words. Every adviser and consultant and staff member would beg a presidential candidate not to say them. But I can say them... because I will not be seeking the Democratic nomination in 2016. Candidates are cautious. They must equivocate. They dodge and tip-toe. But I'd rather leave this office having accomplished something of value than secure another four years having done nothing at all. Franklin Delano Roosevelt ushered in an era of hope and progress when he proposed the New Deal, and at the time his reforms were considered radical. But he once said, 'This country demands bold, persistent experimentation.' It is common sense to take a method and try it and if it fails, admit it frankly and try another. Roosevelt would have understood better than anyone the necessity for trying something different. The New Deal succeeded for many years, but we must now try something newer before it fails us. If America Works succeeds, we will reinvent the American Dream. If we fail in our attempt, we will admit it frankly and try another. But above all, we must try something. Thank you, and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\n\"Imagine a duel, me and Conway. Now, Conway has a powerful gun: a search engine. And it's powerful because with it, he can tell what you think, what you want, where you are, and who you are. He can turn all those searches into votes, and that's enough bullets to kill my chances of winning. But I have an even bigger gun. It's called the NSA. It's one of the perks of being president – that is, if the courts allow my surveillance request. Imagine the men on these walls wished they had a gun like that available to them. Your phone, the phone of the person sitting next to you, your neighbor's phone and everyone you know and the 300 million Americans you don't know. I can see you, and I can use what I see to rig this election. Now of course, a weapon like that... well, you can imagine how risky it is. [gestures at a portrait of Richard Nixon] It might have even given pause to an old crook like him. I mean, they roasted him on the spit for tapping into a few rooms at the Watergate. I'm talking about tapping into every single home in America, and a weapon like that can blow up in my hand. And that's why it's Plan B. Plan A is much safer. Expose that Conway is using his gun illegally and remove the weapon from his hand. [looks at the portraits of Kennedy and Reagan] All three of us took bullets. [looks at the Reagan portrait] Well, I know why we're smiling; we survived.\"\n\n\"That's right, we don't submit to terror. We make the terror.\"\n\n\"The people are angry. Nine weeks ago we had an election in this country, but because two states refused to certify, neither Conway nor myself received the 270 electoral votes required for victory. So they gather here every morning to exercise their magnificent right, guaranteed by the First Amendment, to let their angry voices be heard. And so Thanksgiving, Christmas, and half of January have come and gone, and all three branches of government are in crisis: the Congress is in disarray, the Supreme Court is down a justice and doomed to deadlock, and the Executive Branch is without a boss. You see, my feeling is I think the Founding Fathers, they just got tired. And really, can you blame them? I mean, you can't think of everything — black swans, Murphy's Law. I mean, at a certain point, you just have to sign off and cross your goddam fingers and hope for the best. Or, adopt flipism, a pseudo-philosophy of life in which the most important decisions are made by the flipping of a coin. It was first introduced in the Disney comic book Flip Decision — one of my favorites — in which Donald Duck is persuaded by Professor Batty to make all of the most important decisions based on the flipping of a coin. \"Life is but a gamble, let flipism guide your ramble.\" We've had this sort of trouble before: the election of 1800, Jefferson vs. Burr. They wound up in a tie, 73 electoral votes each — that was the number required then — and that's when Congress tried to address what the Founding Fathers just couldn't imagine. And poof, the Twelfth Amendment was born, and it says that if the states don't certify, it's the House that chooses the president and the Senate that chooses the vice president. Now, the House is a bit of a mess, but the Senate is rather democratic in how they choose the VP: one person, one vote. But, if there's a tie — and this is where Donald Duck comes in — it's resolved by the toss of a coin, a solution that's elegant as hell. But then there's no elegance in modern politics; it's mostly hell. The identity of the next president of these United States is once again in the hands of a bunch of self-serving, money-hungry, boot-licking, power-seeking politicians who can be seduced or sucker-punched or blackmailed into submission. And all I need is just one more vote than the other guy. As you can see, the Founding Fathers didn't plan for this. But I did. Meet your new daddy.\"\n\n\"Yes, here we go again. Secretary of State, that's what I wanted - that's all I wanted. That's what I was promised. And now here I am, President of these United States. You made this bet, America, you voted for me. Are you confused? Are you afraid because what you thought you wanted is now here? And there you are, staring back, slack-jawed, bewildered, wondering if this is what you actually asked for! This democracy - your democracy - elected me! And if you think it was hard getting here you are beginning to understand what I'm willing to do to stay. I look across this crowd gathered today, and I know that these are not my supporters. I'm looking at people who are waiting with a smile on their face for their turn, and the most vicious among them are the ones who are smiling and clapping the hardest. \"Power is a lot like real estate\" - remember?\"\n\n\"Now, you accuse me of breaking the rules, and I tell you I am playing by the rules. The very rules that you and I all agreed upon. The very rules that you and I all wrote together. So yes, I'm guilty as hell, but then so are all of you. Yes, the system is corrupt, but you wanted a guardian at the gate like me. And why? Because you know I will do whatever it takes. And you have all enjoyed it, been party to it and benefited by it. Oh, don't deny it. You've loved it. You don't actually need me to stand for anything, you just need me to stand. To be the strong man, the man of action. My God, you are addicted to action and slogans. It doesn't matter what I say. It doesn't matter what I do. Just as long as I'm doing something, you're happy to be along for the ride. And frankly, I don't blame you. With all the foolishness and indecision in your lives, why not a man like me? I don't apologize. In the end, I don't care whether you love me or you hate me, just as long as I win. The deck is stacked. The rules are rigged. Welcome to the death of the Age of Reason. There is no right or wrong. Not anymore. There's only being in, and then being out. So I will not be a party to this any longer. I will not wear the target for any of you anymore. You have all used me for long enough. So the party's over, the ride's done. I respect the office too much to allow this to continue going on. That's why I'm announcing to this committee, and to the nation, that as of 6 p.m. tomorrow evening, I shall resign the office of President of the United States. And I will be happy to take any questions you may have. But my gut tells me that isn't really going to be necessary.\"\n\n\"Here we are again. You know, if you ignore all the pomp and circumstance, the most perverse thing is that I actually believe in the presidency, its importance, what it means around the world, even symbolically - but I believe in power even more, for its own sake. Gore Vidal once wrote that power is an end to itself, and the instinctive urge to prevail the most important single human trait. I've always told myself that everything I did was for her, but maybe it wasn't. Maybe I love power more.\"\n\n\"If she doesn't pardon me, I'll kill her.\"\n\nTrivia\n\nFrank Underwood is based on Francis Urquhart, the protagonist of the British novel and television series House of Cards, from which the American Netflix series is drawn. Although the character is based on the BBC show's lead character, in interviews during the writing and filming of season 2, creator and showrunner Willimon said that he used Lyndon B. Johnson as a source of themes and issues addressed in House of Cards."
