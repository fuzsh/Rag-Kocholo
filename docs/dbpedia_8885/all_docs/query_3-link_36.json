        "text": "Chapter 1: The Budget Outlook\n\nOverview\n\nIn the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline budget projections, the federal budget deficit is $1.5 trillion this year and generally increases over the next decade, reaching $2.6 trillion in 2034. (If adjusted to exclude the effects of shifts that occur in the timing of certain payments when the first day of the fiscal year falls on a weekend, this year’s deficit would be $1.6 trillion.) The cumulative deficit is projected to total $20.0 trillion over the 2025–2034 period. Those projections, which were finalized on January 3, 2024, incorporate the effects of legislation enacted as of that date and therefore do not include the effects of any subsequent legislation, including the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024 (Public Law 118-35), which was enacted on January 19, 2024. Incorporating the budgetary effects of subsequent legislation enacted to date would not significantly change the projections presented here.\n\nMeasured relative to the size of the economy, the deficit equals 5.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2024. In CBO’s projections, annual deficits generally increase over the 2025‒2034 period, averaging 5.7 percent of GDP per year, well above the average deficit over the past 50 years.\n\nAs a result of those deficits, federal debt held by the public increases each year in CBO’s projections, rising from 99 percent of GDP this year to 116 percent in 2034 (see Table 1-1). That would be the largest amount ever recorded in U.S. history.\n\nTable 1-1.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Budget Projections, by Category\n\nThe deficits in CBO’s current projections are generally smaller than those in the agency’s previous baseline projections for 2024 to 2033, which were published in May 2023. The budget shortfall for 2024 is now projected to be $63 billion smaller—and the cumulative deficit for the 2024–2033 period, $1.4 trillion less—than CBO projected last May. Those net decreases stem from the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA, P. L. 118-5) and the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024 (P.L. 118-22), as well as updates to the agency’s economic forecast and other changes (see Chapter 3).\n\nAfter 2034, deficits continue to increase in relation to the size of the economy in CBO’s projections. Outlays increase largely because of rising interest costs and growth in spending for the major health care programs. Revenues also rise over the period, but more slowly than outlays. Such persistently large deficits cause federal debt held by the public, which has recently been at levels not reached since the end of World War II, to rise even further.\n\nCBO prepares its baseline budget projections in accordance with provisions set forth in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (the Deficit Control Act, P.L. 99-177) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-344). Those laws require CBO to construct its baseline under the assumption that current laws governing revenues and spending will generally stay the same. For discretionary funding, CBO’s baseline incorporates limits on such funding for 2024 and 2025, as specified in the FRA, and then reflects the assumption (as required by law) that funding will grow with inflation once those caps expire. Discretionary funding that is not constrained by the caps is generally assumed to increase with inflation throughout the next decade.\n\nCBO’s baseline budget projections are meant to provide a benchmark that policymakers can use to assess the potential effects of changes in policy. They are not intended to provide a forecast of future budgetary outcomes, because future legislative action could lead to markedly different outcomes. Even if federal laws remained unaltered for the next decade, actual budgetary outcomes would probably differ from CBO’s baseline projections, not only because of unanticipated economic conditions but also because of the many other factors that affect federal revenues and outlays, such as administrative actions.\n\nDeficits\n\nThe projected $1.5 trillion federal budget deficit for 2024 is $188 billion less than the shortfall recorded last year. That deficit would be larger, and the decrease would be smaller, if not for a shift in the timing of certain payments in both 2024 and 2023. October 1, 2023 (the first day of fiscal year 2024) fell on a weekend, so certain payments that would ordinarily have been made on that day were instead made in fiscal year 2023. Likewise, October 1, 2022, fell on a weekend, which shifted payments due on that day into fiscal year 2022 (from fiscal year 2023). If not for those shifts, this year’s projected deficit would be $1.6 trillion, $102 billion less than the $1.7 trillion deficit in 2023 (see Table 1-2). Throughout the rest of this chapter, outlays and deficits (both projected and historical amounts) reflect adjustments to exclude the effects of timing shifts. That allows for a clearer analysis of the underlying annual trends in those budget categories.\n\nTable 1-2.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Outlays and Deficits, Adjusted to Exclude Effects of Timing Shifts\n\nThe 2023 deficit was significantly affected by actions related to the Administration’s plan to cancel outstanding student loans for many borrowers. Those actions resulted in largely offsetting changes to the deficit in the past two years. In September 2022, in keeping with the budgetary procedures used to estimate the costs of federal credit programs, the Administration recorded outlays of $379 billion to reflect its estimate of the long-term costs of debt cancellation, which increased the deficit in fiscal year 2022. Because of a June 2023 Supreme Court decision, however, the cancellation plan was never implemented. As a result, in August 2023, the Administration recorded a $333 billion reduction in outlays for the student loan program. That action reduced the fiscal year 2023 deficit.\n\nIf the reversal of the Administration’s plan for student loan cancellations was excluded from the calculation of the deficit in 2023, the deficit that year would have been larger—$2.0 trillion instead of $1.7 trillion—and the projected decline in deficits from 2023 to 2024 in CBO’s baseline would be $435 billion rather than $102 billion.\n\nMeasured relative to the size of the economy, this year’s deficit is estimated to be smaller than last year’s—5.6 percent of GDP, down from 6.2 percent. (Without the reversal of the student loan cancellations, the 2023 deficit would have been 7.5 percent of GDP.) Deficits in CBO’s baseline grow to 6.1 percent of GDP in 2025 and then decline over the next two years—falling to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2027—primarily because of the scheduled expiration at the end of calendar year 2025 of some provisions of the 2017 tax act (P.L. 115-97). After 2028, deficits increase again, reaching 6.1 percent of GDP in 2034, the last year of the projection period (see Figure 1-1). The cumulative deficit for the 2025–2034 period is projected to total $19.8 trillion, or 5.6 percent of GDP (excluding the effects of timing shifts).\n\nFigure 1-1.\n\nTotal Deficit, Net Interest Outlays, and Primary Deficit\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nThe deficits that CBO projects are large by historical standards. Over the past 50 years, the annual deficit has averaged 3.7 percent of GDP. In CBO’s projections, deficits equal or exceed 5.2 percent of GDP in every year from 2024 to 2034. Since at least 1930, deficits have not remained that large for more than five years in a row.\n\nPrimary deficits—that is, deficits excluding net outlays for interest—increase from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2024 to 2.8 percent in 2025 and then decrease, reaching 1.9 percent in 2027 in CBO’s projections. From 2027 to 2034, primary deficits average 2.0 percent of GDP. In the 62 years from 1947 to 2008, such deficits exceeded 2.0 percent of GDP only three times. In the past 15 years, though, they have exceeded that level 12 times—in part because of legislation that was enacted in response to the 2007–2009 financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic that began in early 2020.\n\nThe primary deficits in CBO’s projections are especially large given the relatively low unemployment rates that the agency is forecasting. From 2025 to 2034—a period in which the average unemployment rate is projected to remain at or below 4.5 percent in each year—primary deficits in CBO’s baseline projections average 2.1 percent of GDP. By way of historical contrast, from 1974 to 2023 the unemployment rate was at or below 4.5 percent in nine years; in those years, the budget showed a primary deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP, on average.\n\nDebt\n\nThe deficits projected in CBO’s baseline would boost federal debt. That debt can be measured in various ways. The most common measure is debt held by the public, which consists mostly of securities that the Treasury issues to raise cash to fund the federal government’s activities and to pay off its maturing liabilities. Other measures are used for different purposes, such as to provide a more comprehensive picture of the government’s financial condition.\n\nDebt Held by the Public\n\nAfter accounting for all the federal government’s borrowing needs, CBO projects that debt held by the public would rise from $26.2 trillion at the end of 2023 to $48.3 trillion at the end of 2034 (see Table 1-3). As a percentage of GDP, that debt is projected to reach 116 percent at the end of 2034—about 19 percentage points larger than it was at the end of 2023 and nearly two and a half times its average percentage over the past 50 years (see Figure 1-2).\n\nTable 1-3.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Federal Debt\n\nBillions of dollars\n\nFigure 1-2.\n\nFederal Debt Held by the Public\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nThe net amount that the Treasury borrows each year by issuing securities is determined primarily by the annual budget deficit. However, several other factors also affect the government’s need to borrow from the public. Those factors—collectively referred to as other means of financing—include changes in the government’s cash balances and cash flows associated with federal credit programs, such as those related to student loans and loans to small businesses. (Those cash flows are not reflected in the budget deficit, which accounts only for the subsidy costs of credit programs—that is, the estimated net lifetime costs of the programs’ loans and loan guarantees.) As a result of that additional borrowing, the increase in debt held by the public in 2024 will exceed the deficit by about $150 billion, CBO projects. Over the 2025–2034 period, the increase in federal debt is projected to exceed the cumulative deficit by $387 billion.\n\nThe bulk of that additional borrowing stems from the need to finance federal loan programs. The cash disbursements needed to finance those programs each year—for example, in the case of direct loans, the funds lent to borrowers minus the repayments of principal and payments of interest and other fees—are greater than the net subsidy costs that are recorded in the budget. The Treasury needs to borrow funds each year to make up that difference.\n\nOther Measures of Debt\n\nFour other measures are sometimes used in discussions of federal debt.\n\nDebt held by the public minus financial assets excludes the value of the government’s financial assets. That measure reflects the government’s overall financial condition by accounting for the value of financial assets, such as student loans, that the government has acquired while incurring that debt. In CBO’s baseline projections, that measure generally varies along with debt held by the public but is 6 percent to 8 percent smaller.\n\nDebt held by the public minus financial assets and debt held by the Federal Reserve excludes the value of financial assets held by the federal government as well as Treasury securities held by the Federal Reserve. That measure represents the net debt held by entities outside the government, which better reflects the government’s overall effect on credit markets. In CBO’s baseline projections, that measure increases from $19.1 trillion (or 71 percent of GDP) at the end of 2023 to $36.3 trillion (or 87 percent of GDP) at the end of 2034. (The Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities, which totaled $5.0 trillion at the end of 2023, are projected to fall to $4.4 trillion at the end of 2024; thereafter, those holdings increase in CBO’s projections, rising to $9.3 trillion in 2034.)\n\nGross debt consists of debt held by the public and Treasury securities held by government accounts (for example, the Social Security trust funds). The debt held by government accounts does not directly affect the economy and has no net effect on the budget. It is not a meaningful benchmark for Treasury’s future obligations because it represents the cumulative difference between a program’s past collections and expenditures. Although debt held by the public increases by $22.1 trillion from the end of 2023 to the end of 2034 in CBO’s baseline projections, debt held by government accounts falls by about $660 billion, reflecting declines in the balances of many trust funds. As a result, gross federal debt is projected to rise by $21.4 trillion over that period and to total $54.4 trillion at the end of 2034. About 11 percent of that sum would be debt held by government accounts.\n\nDebt subject to limit is the amount of debt that is subject to the statutory limit on federal borrowing, which is often referred to as the debt ceiling. Such debt differs from gross federal debt mainly in that it excludes debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank and includes certain other adjustments that are excluded from gross debt. Currently, the statutory limit on the issuance of new federal debt is suspended through January 1, 2025. In the absence of any legislative action to adjust the debt limit before the suspension ends, the amount of borrowing accumulated during the suspension will be added to the previous debt limit of $31.4 trillion. The Deficit Control Act requires that CBO project spending, revenues, and deficits independently of the debt limit. Thus, in CBO’s baseline projections, debt subject to limit continues rising over the next decade and reaches $54.5 trillion in 2034.\n\nOutlays\n\nIn CBO’s baseline projections, outlays rise from 22.7 percent of GDP in 2023 to 23.1 percent in 2024 and remain near that level through 2028. Thereafter, outlays increase in each year as a share of the economy, reaching 24.1 percent of GDP in 2034. Since 1974, outlays have averaged 21.0 percent of GDP.\n\nOutlays in 2024\n\nFederal outlays are projected to total $6.5 trillion in 2024—an increase of $0.4 trillion (or 6 percent) from the amount recorded in 2023. (If the budgetary effects related to the Administration’s plan for student loan cancellations were excluded from last year’s total, the projected increase in outlays would instead be 1 percent.) In nominal terms, projected outlays rise this year in all three spending categories—mandatory, discretionary, and net outlays for interest—but net outlays for interest and mandatory spending make up 96 percent of the total increase.\n\nMandatory Spending. This category includes outlays for most federal benefit programs and for certain other payments to people, businesses, nonprofit institutions, and state and local governments. Such outlays are generally governed by statutory criteria and are not normally constrained by the annual appropriation process. Certain types of payments that federal agencies receive from the public and from other government agencies (such as premiums paid by Medicare beneficiaries and payments made by federal agencies to employees’ retirement plans) are classified as offsetting receipts and are accounted for in the budget as reductions in mandatory spending.\n\nThe Deficit Control Act requires CBO to construct its baseline projections for most existing mandatory spending under the assumption that current laws generally remain in place. Therefore, CBO’s baseline projections of mandatory spending reflect the estimated effects of changes in the economy, growth in the number of beneficiaries of certain mandatory programs, and other factors related to the costs of those programs. The projections also incorporate a set of across-the-board reductions in budgetary resources (known as sequestration) that are required under current law for some mandatory programs.\n\nIn 2024, CBO estimates, total mandatory outlays (net of offsetting receipts) will amount to $3.9 trillion under current law, $166 billion (or 4 percent) more than they were in 2023 (see Table 1-4). Those outlays are projected to amount to 13.9 percent of GDP this year—equal to last year’s percentage but still well above the 11.0 percent of GDP they averaged from 1974 to 2023. If the budgetary effects of the Administration’s plan for student loan cancellations were excluded from 2023 totals, projected mandatory outlays this year would be $167 billion less than they were in 2023.\n\nTable 1-4.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Mandatory Outlays, Adjusted to Exclude Effects of Timing Shifts\n\nBillions of dollars\n\nOutlays for these programs decrease the most in 2024 in CBO’s projections:\n\nDeposit insurance. Outlays of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are projected to fall by $117 billion this year as that agency continues to resolve the bank failures that occurred in 2023. This year (and over the next few years), the FDIC expects to recover much of what it spent to resolve those failures by liquidating the banks’ assets and collecting higher premiums from FDIC-insured institutions. CBO projects a reduced risk of bank failures in 2024 relative to last year’s activity.\n\nMedicaid. CBO’s updated baseline projections include a $58 billion (or 9 percent) drop in Medicaid outlays from 2023 to 2024. Two factors account for most of the reduction. First, states are continuing to reassess the eligibility of Medicaid enrollees who remained in the program during the coronavirus public health emergency. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (P.L. 117-328), ended the continuous-enrollment requirement on March 31, 2023, and states began to review enrollees’ eligibility and to disenroll those who no longer qualified. CBO expects Medicaid enrollment to fall in 2024 as states continue that process. In addition, that law lowered the enhanced matching rate for federal reimbursement to states for Medicaid services from an average of 5 percentage points in 2023 to 1.5 percentage points in the first quarter of 2024 and to zero thereafter, which decreases outlays for the program.\n\nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Net outlays for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) are projected to decline by $32 billion (or 80 percent) in 2024, to $8 billion. That decrease stems almost entirely from less spending for PBGC’s special financial assistance program, which makes onetime payments to financially troubled multiemployer pension plans that qualify for assistance.\n\nRefundable tax credits. Outlays for refundable tax credits total $118 billion in 2024 in CBO’s projections, $26 billion less than the amount recorded in 2023. Outlays for the coronavirus refundable tax credits decline by $31 billion in 2024. In the opposite direction, outlays for the earned income tax credit are projected to increase by $7 billion this year because of higher wages and employment gains.\n\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Outlays for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are projected to fall by $23 billion (or 17 percent) in 2024, to $112 billion. That decrease largely stems from the end of pandemic-related benefits. Emergency allotments that were provided to SNAP participants during the pandemic ended in February 2023, and CBO projects that spending for the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer Program, which provided food benefits to households with children, will end in 2024. Additionally, CBO projects that SNAP participation will decline by about 1 million people this year, to 41.1 million.\n\nThe largest increases in estimated outlays for 2024 are for these programs:\n\nHigher education. In CBO’s baseline, projected outlays for higher education increase by $213 billion this year, rising to $29 billion from −$183 billion last year. In 2023, the Administration recorded a net reduction of $207 billion in the costs of outstanding loans—primarily reflecting the $333 billion reduction in outlays that resulted from the Supreme Court’s decision that blocked implementation of the Administration’s plan to cancel outstanding student loans for many borrowers. About one-third of the $333 billion reduction was offset by increased outlays recorded for the new income-driven repayment plan implemented by the Administration ($74 billion) and for other modifications the Administration made to the terms of outstanding loans and to changes in the underlying assumptions about the costs of those loans ($52 billion). Excluding those 2023 revisions to the costs of outstanding loans, spending for higher education would have increased by $5 billion from 2023 to 2024.\n\nSocial Security. Outlays for Social Security are estimated to increase by $104 billion (or 8 percent) in 2024, to $1.5 trillion. About $80 billion of that growth stems from an increase in average benefits, most of which was driven by the 8.7 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in January 2023 and the 3.2 percent COLA in January 2024. A net increase in the total number of beneficiaries accounts for the remaining growth. Most of the projected increase in outlays—$98 billion—is for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance portion of Social Security. The rest is for the Disability Insurance portion of the program.\n\nMedicare. Outlays for Medicare (net of offsetting receipts) reach $896 billion this year in CBO’s projections, $65 billion (or 8 percent) more than in 2023. That increase is the net result of a $76 billion increase in spending for benefits and a $12 billion increase in offsetting receipts (mainly from the collection of premiums). The growth in Medicare benefit spending is mostly concentrated in larger payments to Medicare Advantage plans (which allow beneficiaries to receive their Medicare coverage through private plans) and to Part D plans (which cover outpatient prescription drugs). Projected growth in payments for the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program is slower this year because of continued growth in Medicare Advantage enrollment: CBO expects total Medicare enrollment to increase by 1 million in 2024, which reflects an increase of 2 million in enrollment in Medicare Advantage and a decrease of 1 million in enrollment in Medicare fee-for-service.\n\nVeterans’ programs. In CBO’s projections, mandatory outlays for veterans’ programs increase by $27 billion (or 16 percent) in 2024, to $195 billion. Most of that increase stems from growth in the amount of disability compensation payments that some veterans receive. (Average disability ratings for veterans continue to rise, which results in larger benefit payments.) The number of new veterans receiving disability compensation is also expected to increase this year, in part from continued implementation of provisions of the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-168). In addition, outlays for veterans’ benefits grow as a result of the COLAs that went into effect in January 2023 and 2024—8.7 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively.\n\nTaken together, outlays for all other mandatory programs—including federal retirement programs and subsidies for health insurance—are estimated to rise, on net, by $13 billion (or 0.3 percent) in 2024.\n\nDiscretionary Spending. This category encompasses spending for an array of federal activities that are funded through or controlled by appropriations. Discretionary spending includes most defense spending; spending for many nondefense activities, such as elementary and secondary education, housing assistance, international affairs, and the administration of justice; and outlays for certain transportation programs (though funding for those programs is mandatory). In any year, some discretionary outlays arise from budget authority provided in the same year, and some arise from appropriations made in previous years.\n\nIn CBO’s projections, discretionary funding and discretionary outlays each total $1.7 trillion this year. Relative to amounts provided last year, this year’s funding is lower, but outlays are projected to be $17 billion more. The agency projects outlays to increase this year despite the reduction in budget authority primarily because of spending from budget authority provided in previous years.\n\nCBO’s baseline projections of discretionary spending reflect laws that were in place as of January 3, 2024. The continuing resolution then in effect (the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024) provided funding through January 19 for some federal agencies and through February 2 for the rest. CBO’s baseline incorporates the funding provided by that continuing resolution on an annualized basis—that is, calculated as if the funding provided by the continuing resolution was in effect for the entire fiscal year. Because the resulting amounts exceed the limits on discretionary funding for 2024 established by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the total amount of budget authority and the resulting outlays have been adjusted to comply with those limits, or caps. (See Box 1-1 for details about the FRA’s effects on CBO’s baseline projections of discretionary spending.)\n\nBox 1-1.\n\nHow the Fiscal Responsibility Act Affects CBO’s Baseline Projections of Discretionary Funding\n\nTwo separate sections of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA, Public Law 118-5) established differing limits—also known as caps—on both defense discretionary funding and nondefense discretionary funding for 2024 and 2025. Which section of the law applies depends on the timing of the enactment of appropriations and the duration of funding. Caps established by section 101 of the FRA apply at the start of each fiscal year. But if a continuing resolution is still in effect on January 1 of that same fiscal year, those caps will be replaced by the limits established in section 102 of the FRA. (If full-year appropriations are enacted after January 1, the limits will revert to the caps under section 101 of the law.)\n\nThe caps on defense and nondefense funding limit most—but not all—discretionary funding. Some funding designated for certain purposes causes an adjustment to the caps, and certain other funding is not subject to the caps at all. Because amounts appropriated for those purposes are generally not constrained by the caps, the Congressional Budget Office projects such funding in accordance with the provisions of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985—that is, by assuming that appropriations in future years are equal to the amounts provided for the current year with increases for inflation. (Funding for certain types of activities that result in adjustments to the caps is subject to separate caps.)\n\nCBO’s baseline includes downward adjustments to projected discretionary funding to reflect the effects of the caps. For 2024, because a continuing resolution was in place on January 1, the baseline reflects the caps under section 102 of the FRA, which are $850 billion for defense funding and $736 billion for nondefense funding. Those amounts are below the amounts CBO estimated in its cost estimate for the continuing resolution underlying the projections in this report by $10 billion and $41 billion, respectively. Because cost estimates for appropriation legislation—not the baseline—are used when enforcing the caps, CBO’s baseline reflects downward adjustments of those amounts in 2024 (see the table). (Differences between funding projected in the baseline and funding reported in the cost estimate for the continuing resolution cause total base funding—that is, funding constrained by the caps—in the baseline to exceed the caps.)\n\nFor 2025, CBO’s baseline reflects the caps established under section 101 of the FRA, which are $895 billion for defense funding (an increase from the cap now in effect for 2024) and $711 billion for nondefense funding (a decrease from the 2024 cap now in effect). Because the amount of base funding projected for defense in 2025 is below the cap, no additional adjustments to projections of that funding in 2025 are required; base defense funding for 2025 and beyond is therefore projected by carrying forward the base funding for 2024, with adjustments for inflation. Thus, base defense funding in the baseline over the next several years is $10 billion to $11 billion less than the amounts that would be projected without accounting for the caps.\n\nProjected base funding for nondefense activities exceeds the section 101 cap by $100 billion in 2025, in CBO’s estimation, so the agency has included reductions of that amount to bring such funding in the baseline into compliance with the 2025 cap. Thus, projected base funding in the baseline matches the cap in 2025—$711 billion—and the baseline incorporates the assumption that base nondefense funding will equal that amount (with increases for inflation) in each year from 2026 through 2034. If not for the caps, beginning in 2025, base nondefense funding would exceed amounts projected in CBO’s baseline by more than $100 billion each year.\n\nSome discretionary funding in CBO’s baseline is not constrained by the limits set in the FRA. Current law allows adjustments to be made to the caps for certain funding designated as an emergency requirement or (within statutory limits) for disaster relief activities, some efforts to reduce overpayments in benefit programs, and wildfire suppression. Other funding is exempt from the caps altogether. Specifically, certain funding provided pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255), funding derived from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, and emergency funding covered by section 103 of the FRA does not count toward the caps. Funding that does not fall into any of those categories (and is therefore constrained by the caps) is referred to as “base” funding.\n\nIn CBO’s baseline projections, discretionary budget authority for 2024 is $122 billion (or 7 percent) less than the amount provided in 2023 (seeTable 1-5). (Budget authority does not include obligation limitations that govern discretionary spending for certain transportation programs whose spending authority is mandatory; the limitations are the same under the continuing resolution this year as they were last year.) The amount of base funding in CBO’s baseline is $1.6 trillion in 2024, generally reflecting the limits set in section 102 of the FRA. (Total base funding for 2024 in CBO’s baseline differs from the funding reported in CBO’s cost estimate for the continuing resolution by $37 billion. For an explanation, see Box 1-2.) Budget authority that is not constrained by the caps totals $127 billion this year. More than half of that amount was provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58) and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (P.L. 117-159), both of which were enacted in 2022.\n\nTable 1-5.\n\nChanges in Discretionary Budget Authority From 2023 to 2024\n\nBillions of dollars\n\nBox 1-2.\n\nWhy CBO’s Baseline Projections of Discretionary Funding for 2024 Differ From Amounts in Its Cost Estimate for the Continuing Resolution\n\nDiscretionary funding provided for 2024 in the Congressional Budget Office’s current baseline is $35 billion less than the amount shown in CBO’s cost estimate for the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act (Public Law 118-22), referred to here as the continuing resolution. That difference occurs for several reasons (see the table).\n\nMajor Reasons for the Difference\n\nThe largest driver of the difference between the amounts projected in the baseline and CBO’s cost estimate for the continuing resolution arises from the estimated effects of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (P.L. 118-5), which limits federal funding for discretionary programs over the current and next fiscal year. When the amounts provided by the continuing resolution are annualized—that is, calculated as if the law was in effect through all of 2024—funding provided for 2024 exceeds those limits. As a result, CBO has adjusted the total amount of funding to reflect the expectation that the Administration would implement statutory mechanisms to enforce the caps. In total, those adjustments reduce discretionary funding shown in the baseline by $51 billion in relation to the funding totals shown in the cost estimate for the continuing resolution.\n\nAnother reason for the difference stems from changes in mandatory programs enacted in appropriation acts, which are known as CHIMPs. Following rules (known as scorekeeping guidelines) that govern how CBO produces its cost estimates, such changes made in appropriation acts are classified as reductions or increases in discretionary spending in cost estimates. When CBO produces its baseline estimates, though, those CHIMPs are reflected as reductions or increases in mandatory spending, following the scorekeeping guidelines that govern their classification. On net, CHIMPs reduced CBO’s estimate of discretionary funding in its cost estimate for the continuing resolution by $15 billion. Shifting the effect of that reduction to CBO’s projections of mandatory spending boosts net discretionary funding by the same amount.\n\nOther Reasons\n\nTechnical and economic updates to estimated components of discretionary funding also account for part of the difference. For example, some fees that agencies collect (for mortgage originations guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration or aviation security fees collected by the Transportation Security Administration, for instance) are estimated and are classified as offsets to discretionary budget authority. CBO’s estimate for the continuing resolution used amounts projected in its May 2023 baseline, but updated estimates of that funding in CBO’s most recent baseline result in larger estimates of fees. As a result, net discretionary budget authority in the baseline is $3 billion smaller than the amount in CBO’s estimate for the continuing resolution.\n\nIn addition, current law requires CBO to exclude some discretionary funding from its cost estimates. Specifically, the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) and division B of the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136, as amended) require that certain funding provided to the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration or derived from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund be excluded from CBO’s cost estimates. That funding is reflected in CBO’s baseline, however, accounting for another $3 billion of the overall difference.\n\nFinally, when estimating the amount of funding provided by the continuing resolution, CBO was directed by the House and Senate Budget Committees to incorporate the assumption that certain funding provided to the federal power marketing administrations (federal agencies that generate power) would be fully offset by the fees those agencies collect. (Those fees reduce total budget authority.) Because CBO’s baseline does not reflect that assumption, its discretionary budget authority is $0.1 billion larger than the amount in the cost estimate.\n\nDiscretionary budget authority for defense totals $850 billion in 2024, a $42 billion—or 5 percent—reduction from the amount provided in 2023. Last year, $33 billion in funding designated as an emergency requirement was provided, mostly for military assistance to Ukraine. As of January 3, 2024, no such funding had been provided for 2024. The reduction in base funding, which stems from the cap on defense funding, accounts for the rest of the difference. Outlays for defense are projected to be $822 billion in 2024, which is $17 billion (or 2 percent) more than such outlays were in 2023.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2024, total funding for nondefense discretionary programs decreases by $81 billion—or 8 percent—in CBO’s projections, to $876 billion. Nondefense base funding accounts for $40 billion of that reduction, driven largely by the cap on such funding. In addition, funding designated as an emergency requirement that results in an upward adjustment to the cap is $41 billion less than it was last year. Despite the drop in funding, nondefense discretionary outlays in 2024 are projected to total the same amount as was recorded in 2023—$917 billion—primarily because of spending from budget authority provided in previous years.\n\nNet Interest Outlays. In the budget, net outlays for interest consist of the government’s interest payments on federal debt, offset by interest income that the government receives. Net interest outlays are dominated by the interest paid to holders of the debt that the Treasury issues to the public. The Treasury also pays interest on debt issued to trust funds and other government accounts, but such payments are intragovernmental transactions that have no effect on the budget deficit.\n\nNet outlays for interest have risen by more than 35 percent in each of the past two years and are projected to increase by 32 percent this year. In CBO’s projections, those outlays rise from $659 billion in 2023 to $870 billion in 2024, surpassing discretionary outlays for defense this year. Relative to the size of the economy, net outlays for interest rise from 2.4 percent in 2023 to 3.1 percent in 2024—double the 1.5 percent of GDP recorded for such outlays in 2021.\n\nThe projected increase in 2024 occurs primarily because the average interest rate that the Treasury pays on its debt is higher this year and is expected to rise further as maturing securities are refinanced at rates that exceed those that prevailed when the securities were issued. For example, the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes averaged 3.0 percent in 2022 and 4.0 percent in 2023; that rate averages 4.6 percent in 2024 in CBO’s current economic forecast (see Chapter 2). Debt held by the public (in nominal terms, rather than as a percentage of GDP) is on track to increase by 6 percent from 2023 to 2024, which also boosts net interest payments this year.\n\nOutlays From 2025 to 2034\n\nIn CBO’s baseline projections, federal outlays (adjusted to exclude the effects of timing shifts) rise from $6.8 trillion in 2025 to $10.0 trillion in 2034, for an average annual increase of 4.5 percent. Measured in relation to the size of the economy, federal outlays remain around 23 percent of GDP for several years before gradually rising, reaching 24.1 percent in 2034 (see Figure 1-3).\n\nFigure 1-3.\n\nTotal Federal Outlays and Revenues\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nMandatory Spending. In CBO’s projections, nominal outlays for mandatory programs (net of offsetting receipts) rise at an average annual rate of 5 percent over the 2025–2034 period. In relation to GDP, those outlays increase from 13.9 percent in 2025 to 15.1 percent in 2034. At that point, they would be about 4 percentage points higher than the average over the past 50 years (see Figure 1-4). Two underlying trends, the aging of the population and growth in federal health care costs per beneficiary, put upward pressure on mandatory outlays.\n\nFigure 1-4.\n\nOutlays, by Category\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nThe aging of the population causes the number of beneficiaries of Social Security and Medicare to grow faster than the overall population, and federal costs per beneficiary for the major health care programs continue to rise faster than GDP per person. (Spending for the major health care programs consists of outlays for Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, as well as premium tax credits for health insurance purchased through the marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act and related spending. The premium tax credits subsidize the purchase of health insurance.) As a result of those two trends, outlays for Social Security and Medicare increase in relation to GDP from 2025 to 2034. Beyond the 10-year period, the effects of those trends on federal spending persist, particularly for Medicare.\n\nSocial Security and the Major Health Care Programs. Measured as a percentage of GDP, outlays for Social Security and the major health care programs, net of offsetting receipts, are projected to rise in each year of the 10-year period, from 10.8 percent in 2025 to 12.6 percent in 2034.\n\nCBO’s current baseline includes the following projections for specific programs:\n\nOutlays for Social Security increase to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2025 and continue rising thereafter, reaching 5.9 percent of GDP in 2034.\n\nOutlays for Medicare equal 3.2 percent of GDP in 2025 and climb to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2034.\n\nFederal outlays for Medicaid dip slightly—to 1.9 percent of GDP—in 2025 as pandemic-related spending ends and remain there through 2027. Thereafter, Medicaid outlays gradually climb to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2034.\n\nOutlays for premium tax credits for health insurance purchased through the marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act and related spending average 0.3 percent of GDP per year through 2034, and outlays for the Children’s Health Insurance Program average 0.1 percent.\n\nOther Mandatory Programs. Spending for programs other than Social Security and the major health care programs is projected to equal 3.1 percent of GDP in 2025. Such spending includes outlays for income support programs (such as unemployment compensation and SNAP), military and civilian retirement programs, most veterans’ benefits, and major agriculture programs. That spending also includes offsetting receipts (other than those related to Medicare) collected by the federal government.\n\nIn CBO’s baseline projections, other mandatory spending measured relative to GDP generally declines after 2025, falling to 2.5 percent at the end of the projection period. (That spending, including substantial outlays in response to the pandemic, peaked at 10.5 percent of GDP in 2021.) The projected decline occurs in part because benefit amounts for many of those programs are adjusted for inflation each year, and in CBO’s economic forecast, the growth of nominal GDP outpaces inflation. Growth in veterans’ benefits, which averages 6 percent per year (in nominal terms) after 2024, partially offsets the decline in other mandatory outlays.\n\nDiscretionary Spending. In accordance with section 257 of the Deficit Control Act, discretionary funding in future years is assumed to equal the amount provided so far for 2024—including funding designated as an emergency requirement—with adjustments for inflation. When the projected amounts exceed the limits established by the FRA, the total amount of budget authority in CBO’s baseline is adjusted to comply with those limits. Those adjustments are incorporated in CBO’s projections of discretionary funding in future years.\n\nTotal discretionary budget authority projected for 2025 amounts to $1.7 trillion (see Table 1-6). Defense funding subject to the caps is projected to total $871 billion, which is below the current limit of $895 billion for that year. Nondefense funding constrained by the caps is limited to $711 billion, the amount of the cap currently in place for 2025. Funding not constrained by the caps—mostly funding designated as an emergency requirement—is projected to total $127 billion in 2025; all but $20 million of that funding is for nondefense programs. In 2025, discretionary outlays—which are projected to total $1.8 trillion—exceed total funding provided for the year, largely as a result of spending from budget authority provided in previous years.\n\nTable 1-6.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Discretionary Spending, Adjusted to Exclude Effects of Timing Shifts\n\nBillions of dollars\n\nAfter 2025, when the caps are no longer in effect, total discretionary budget authority rises by an average of 2.3 percent per year in CBO’s projections. Discretionary outlays initially grow more slowly, primarily because of funding reductions in 2024 and 2025. By 2034, the growth in discretionary outlays—at 2.2 percent—nearly matches the rate of growth in funding for that year.\n\nMeasured as a percentage of GDP, discretionary outlays decline steadily, from 5.9 percent in 2026 to 5.1 percent in 2034. (Their previous low—6.0 percent—was in 1999.) Over the past 50 years, discretionary outlays have averaged 8.0 percent of GDP.\n\nIn CBO’s projections, defense outlays fall to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2034—their smallest percentage since at least 1962 (the earliest year for which the Office of Management and Budget reports such data). Outlays for nondefense discretionary programs amount to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2034, also their smallest share since at least 1962. The previous lows for defense and nondefense spending compared with the size of the economy occurred at the turn of the 21st century and were 2.9 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.\n\nNet Interest Outlays. Over the 10-year projection period, net outlays for interest increase by 6.2 percent a year, on average, rising from $951 billion in 2025 to $1.6 trillion in 2034. Measured relative to the size of the economy, those outlays rise from 3.2 percent in 2025 to 3.9 percent in 2034—1.9 percentage points higher than their 50-year average and higher than they have been in any year since at least 1940 (the first year for which the Office of Management and Budget reports such data).\n\nThe amount of the federal government’s net interest costs is mainly determined by the outstanding debt held by the public and the average interest rate on that debt. Growth in net interest costs is affected by changes in the average interest rate on federal debt and by the size of the primary deficit, which requires the government to borrow more and thus boosts debt held by the public. Borrowing to pay for greater interest costs pushes up the net cost of interest further—in large part because of the way that increases in the average interest rate and the primary deficit interact.\n\nAverage interest rates on federal debt rise in CBO’s projections as debt matures and is refinanced. In 2025, the average interest rate on debt held by the public is projected to be 3.4 percent, 0.1 percentage point higher than it was in 2024 and 0.7 percentage points higher than it was in 2023. That rate generally remains steady thereafter, declining slightly to 3.3 percent from 2027 through 2030 before increasing again to 3.5 percent in the final years of the projection period. Changes in the average interest rate stem from interest rates on Treasury securities, the rate of inflation applicable to Treasury inflation-protected securities, and the maturity structure of outstanding securities. (For a discussion of the factors responsible for changes in interest rates and inflation, see Chapter 2.)\n\nPrimary deficits average 2.1 percent of GDP from 2025 to 2034, adding to debt held by the public each year.\n\nOn average, in CBO’s projections, increases in the average interest rate on federal debt account for about two-thirds of the increase in net interest costs from 2025 to 2034.\n\nRevenues\n\nFederal revenues in 2023 totaled $4.4 trillion. At 16.5 percent of GDP, revenues in that year were considerably lower than the 19.4 percent recorded in 2022, which was the highest percentage in more than 20 years. That decline was largely in collections of individual income taxes, which had reached an unprecedented high in 2022. Also contributing to the decline in 2023 were lower remittances from the Federal Reserve, which fell to near zero in that year as rising short-term interest rates pushed the agency’s expenses above its income.\n\nCBO expects total receipts to temporarily jump to 17.5 percent of GDP in 2024 as a result of the collection of certain postponed tax payments, before declining to 17.1 percent of GDP in 2025 (see Table 1-7). Receipts are projected to subsequently rise to 17.9 percent by 2034, largely because of scheduled changes in tax provisions and because the Federal Reserve is anticipated to begin once again remitting significant amounts to the Treasury.\n\nTable 1-7.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Revenues\n\nThose overall movements are driven by the following changes in specific sources of revenues in CBO’s projections:\n\nIndividual income tax receipts declined sharply in relation to GDP last year—from 10.4 percent in 2022 to 8.1 percent in 2023. That reduction occurred in part because asset values and realizations of capital gains fell, and also because the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) postponed until 2024 certain tax payment deadlines for taxpayers in areas affected by natural disasters. (Otherwise, those payments would have been due in 2023.) CBO expects receipts to climb to 8.8 percent of GDP in 2024 as those delayed payments come in and fall to 8.6 percent of GDP in 2025 because no further delays are anticipated. Receipts then grow from 2025 to 2027 because scheduled changes in tax provisions, including an increase in most tax rates, are projected to drive up receipts in relation to taxable personal income. Real bracket creep (explained below) also contributes to rising receipts over time.\n\nCorporate income tax receipts climb from 1.6 percent of GDP in 2023 to 2.0 percent in 2024 for two reasons: because of the collection of postponed payments from corporations in areas affected by natural disasters, and because payments related to the corporate alternative minimum tax that was enacted in 2022 were deferred until 2024 as a result of penalty relief granted by the IRS. As those delays end, receipts decline to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2025. Through 2034, receipts decrease steadily in relation to GDP, primarily from the net effects of scheduled changes in tax rules.\n\nFederal Reserve remittances, or the net earnings of the central bank, remain near zero from 2023 to 2028 because higher short-term interest rates have increased the Federal Reserve System’s interest expenses to such an extent that they exceed its income. CBO anticipates that remittances will rise in 2029 and total 0.4 percent of GDP in 2034—the same level as in 2022.\n\nExcise tax receipts are projected to increase between 2023 and 2026. The recent large amounts reported for refunds and tax credits for the nontaxable use of gasoline—which are currently unexplained— decline over the next few years in CBO’s projections. Thereafter, excise taxes gradually decrease in relation to GDP along with the tax bases on which many excise taxes are levied.\n\nIndividual Income Taxes\n\nIn 2022, receipts from individual income taxes totaled $2.6 trillion, or 10.4 percent of GDP—the highest those receipts have been in relation to the size of the economy since the 16th Amendment authorizing the federal government to collect income taxes was ratified in 1913. Those receipts fell sharply in 2023, to 8.1 percent of GDP—close to the 8.0 percent of GDP they averaged over the past 50 years (see Figure 1-5).\n\nFigure 1-5.\n\nRevenues, by Category\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nThat decline resulted from several factors. First, realizations of capital gains dropped from historic highs to a level closer to their long-term average. Second, the IRS postponed some filing deadlines for taxpayers in areas affected by natural disasters (including most of California), which delayed some tax payments that would otherwise have been made in 2023. Third, the Treasury reclassified as payroll taxes some receipts initially recorded in prior years as individual income tax revenues, and the amount of that adjustment was larger in 2023 than it was in 2022.\n\nReceipts from individual income taxes are projected to rebound to 8.8 percent of GDP this year, largely because of factors that reduced receipts in 2023 but that CBO does not expect to persist. Those factors include the delay in tax payments and the large reclassification of tax revenues. Receipts then decline to 8.6 percent of GDP in 2025 because no further postponed deadlines are anticipated. Scheduled changes in tax rules and real bracket creep cause individual income tax receipts to rise in relation to GDP after 2025, totaling 9.5 percent of GDP in 2034, 0.8 percentage points higher than projected for 2024. The offsetting factors that contribute to that net increase are described in more detail below.\n\nScheduled Tax Changes. At the end of calendar year 2025, nearly all the changes to the individual income tax made by the 2017 tax act are scheduled to expire under current law. Together, those scheduled changes are the most significant factor pushing up tax revenues in relation to income over the next 10 years in CBO’s projections. The expiring provisions affect major elements of the individual income tax code, including statutory tax rates and brackets, allowable deductions, the size and refundability of the child tax credit, the 20 percent deduction for certain business income, and the income levels at which the alternative minimum tax takes effect. Those changes cause tax liabilities (the amount taxpayers owe) to rise beginning in calendar year 2026, boosting receipts in fiscal year 2026 and beyond. In CBO’s projections, the scheduled changes to those tax rules boost individual income tax receipts measured as a share of GDP by 0.8 percentage points from 2025 to 2034.\n\nReal Bracket Creep and Related Effects. The income thresholds for the various tax rate brackets in the individual income tax are indexed to increase with inflation (as measured by the chained consumer price index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics). When income grows faster than prices—as CBO projects it will over the 2024–2034 period—more income is pushed into higher tax brackets, a process known as real bracket creep. Many other parameters of the tax system are also indexed for inflation, including the amounts of the standard deduction and the earned income tax credit. But certain parameters, such as the amount of the child tax credit, are fixed in nominal dollars and not adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe individual income tax system is thus not indexed for real growth (that is, growth beyond the rate of inflation). Instead, it is partially indexed for inflation, and the indexing occurs with a lag. Together, those features of the system cause projected annual revenues measured as a percentage of GDP to rise by 0.4 percentage points from 2025 to 2034.\n\nOther Factors. Over the next decade, several other factors decrease individual income tax receipts measured as a share of GDP—by 0.4 percentage points, on net, in CBO’s projections.\n\nThe largest factor is a projected decline in realizations of capital gains relative to the size of the economy. Detailed tax return data for calendar year 2021—the most recent available—now show that such realizations totaled 8.8 percent of GDP in that year. Although CBO estimates that realizations subsequently decreased, they are projected to equal 5.1 percent of GDP in calendar year 2023—which is still above the 3.9 percent of GDP they have averaged over the past 40 years. In CBO’s baseline projections, capital gains realizations continue to diminish over the next decade to a level that, after differences in applicable tax rates are accounted for, is consistent with their historical average. That anticipated decline reduces receipts from individual income taxes measured as a share of GDP by a total of about 0.3 percentage points from 2025 to 2034.\n\nOther factors are projected to reduce receipts relative to GDP by an additional 0.1 percentage point, on net, over the 2024‒2034 period. One of those factors is the IRS’s decision to postpone until fiscal year 2024 the filing deadlines for taxpayers affected by natural disasters. Those delayed payments (which would typically have been due throughout fiscal year 2023) will boost receipts this year but not in future years. In addition, CBO anticipates a modest decline in the share of business income that is subject to the individual income tax rather than the corporate income tax. The agency also projects an increase relative to the size of the economy in the amount of interest paid on mortgages, which is deductible for taxpayers who itemize.\n\nPartially offsetting those trends is a modest increase relative to GDP in wages and taxable interest, which is expected to boost receipts over the next decade. Moreover, for the past several years, the correlation between individual income tax revenues and the economy has been weaker than is typical. In 2023, those receipts were less than expected given currently available data on the state of the economy and other factors that CBO could identify. That unexplained weakness in individual income tax receipts is projected to gradually dissipate over the next few years.\n\nPayroll Taxes\n\nReceipts from payroll taxes, which fund social insurance programs—primarily Social Security and Medicare—totaled $1.6 trillion in 2023, or 6.0 percent of GDP. In CBO’s projections, payroll taxes decline to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2024 and remain at that level through the end of the 10-year period. That initial decline results from the Treasury’s reclassification of $48 billion of past individual income tax receipts as payroll taxes—an action that boosted the amount of payroll taxes recorded for 2023 but will not affect those collections in later years.\n\nCorporate Income Taxes\n\nIn 2023, receipts from corporate income taxes totaled $420 billion, or 1.6 percent of GDP. CBO expects corporate income tax receipts to rise to 2.0 percent of GDP in 2024, largely because payments that otherwise would have been made in 2023 will instead be paid in fiscal year 2024. Following the temporary boost in receipts in 2024 from those delayed payments, corporate income tax receipts decline in CBO’s projections to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2025. They continue to gradually decrease as a share of GDP throughout the next decade, totaling 1.3 percent of GDP in 2034. The overall reduction in revenues over the 10-year projection period stems from the varying effects of the postponed tax payments, provisions of the 2017 tax act, and other factors.\n\nPostponed Payments. Two actions are estimated to have shifted a total of about $60 billion in payments from 2023 into 2024. First, the IRS postponed payment deadlines for taxpayers, including corporations, in areas affected by natural disasters. Second, a new corporate alternative minimum tax on the book income of certain corporations (based on an adjusted measure of the income reported on their financial statements) was created as part of the 2022 reconciliation act. That tax went into effect in 2023, but the IRS subsequently granted penalty relief to corporations that did not make estimated payments in 2023 while it finalized the necessary guidelines and regulations for calculating their liability for the tax. Taken together, those additional collections are projected to boost receipts by 0.2 percent of GDP in 2024 but not in later years.\n\nProvisions of the 2017 Tax Act. Over the next decade, several provisions of the 2017 tax act affect corporate income tax receipts. In CBO’s projections, those provisions reduce receipts as a share of GDP by 0.2 percentage points, on net, between 2025 and 2034.\n\nFollowing one provision of that law, firms have been making scheduled payments for a onetime tax on certain foreign profits since 2018. That tax applied to foreign profits for which U.S. taxes had been deferred under prior law. Taxes on those earnings, which are based on the value of those profits as of late calendar year 2017 (and which are unrelated to future business activity), can be paid over eight years in installments that vary in size. The payments thus boost receipts in CBO’s baseline projections to varying degrees from 2023 to 2026 but not in later years, thereby contributing to lower receipts relative to GDP after 2026.\n\nAnother provision of the law, which took effect in 2022, requires firms to begin capitalizing and amortizing certain expenditures for research and development over a five-year period as they are incurred; previously, firms could immediately deduct such expenses. That change elevated receipts in 2023 and will continue to do so for several more years as firms take fewer deductions up front. (It will not significantly affect receipts in later years.) Additionally, provisions allowing firms to immediately deduct from their taxable income 100 percent of their investments in equipment are scheduled to phase out from 2023 to 2026. By reducing the deduction that can be taken on new investments in the first year such an investment is made, that change will add to receipts during the phase-down period but will have little effect by 2034.\n\nOther provisions of the law changed rules related to the taxation of foreign profits. Those changes, which are scheduled to take effect in 2026, will increase revenues in subsequent years. The increases will be more than offset by the reductions stemming from the previously described changes, however.\n\nOther Factors. Various other factors are projected to reduce corporate income tax revenues as a share of GDP by an additional 0.3 percent between 2025 and 2034. Most significantly, profits on businesses’ domestic activity are projected to decline over the next decade, reducing taxes as a share of the economy. CBO further anticipates that businesses will claim more tax credits in future years, in part because international firms are expected to increasingly report foreign profits earned in jurisdictions with higher taxes. Collections of taxes for years other than firms’ most recent tax years are also projected to decrease over the next decade. Those collections have been high as a share of tax liabilities over the past several years, but they decline in CBO’s projections to a level consistent with their average over the past decade.\n\nReceipts From Other Sources\n\nReceipts from all revenue sources other than individual income taxes, payroll taxes, and corporate income taxes totaled $229 billion, or 0.8 percent of GDP, in 2023 (see Table 1-8). Those receipts are projected to remain at that level this year and for the next few years. By 2034, they rise to 1.2 percent of GDP in CBO’s projections, because remittances from the Federal Reserve, which nearly ceased in 2023, are expected to resume in higher amounts starting in 2029.\n\nTable 1-8.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Smaller Sources of Revenues\n\nBillions of dollars\n\nEstate and Gift Taxes. In 2023, revenues from estate and gift taxes totaled $34 billion, or 0.1 percent of GDP. They are projected to rise by 45 percent from 2026 to 2027 because of the expiration at the end of calendar year 2025 of a provision of the 2017 tax act that doubled the amount of the estate and gift tax exemption. By 2034, those revenues total 0.2 percent of GDP.\n\nExcise Taxes. Collections of excise taxes—which are levied on the production or purchase of particular types of goods and services, including motor fuels, tobacco, alcohol, and aviation—totaled $76 billion, or 0.3 percent of GDP, in 2023. Those receipts rise slightly through 2026 but eventually decline to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2034 in CBO’s projections.\n\nThe initial increase in receipts reflects CBO’s expectation that the large amounts reported for refunds and tax credits attributable to the nontaxable use of gasoline will not continue. Those amounts, which are estimated to have totaled $18 billion last year, did not exceed $2 billion in any prior year. Because CBO cannot determine the cause of those elevated refunds and tax credits, it projects that they will gradually dissipate over the next several years. After 2026, excise taxes decrease in relation to GDP as the number of units of taxed goods and services is projected to grow slowly or decline. (Many excise taxes are imposed as a fixed dollar amount per unit sold.) For example, taxes on gasoline will decline, CBO projects, as the average fuel efficiency of fleets of vehicles improves and the consumption of gasoline thus decreases. CBO also anticipates that excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol products will be reduced over the next decade as a result of importers’ increasingly claiming drawbacks (or refunds) of those taxes.\n\nCustoms Duties. Collections of customs duties, which are assessed on certain imported goods, totaled $80 billion, or 0.3 percent of GDP, in 2023. Those receipts are projected to decline slightly but remain near 0.3 percent as a share of GDP through 2034. That slight decline reflects CBO’s expectation that some imported goods from countries subject to the additional tariffs imposed beginning in 2018 (in particular, the additional tariffs that apply to a large share of imported goods from China) will continue to be diverted to other countries. (Although those additional tariffs increased customs duties by roughly 0.2 percent of GDP from 2020 through 2022, their effect diminished as customs duties declined sharply in 2023.) CBO’s baseline projections reflect the assumption that tariffs, along with any subsequent exemptions provided by the Administration, continue at the rates in effect as of December 5, 2023, when CBO completed its economic forecast.\n\nRemittances From the Federal Reserve. The central bank’s remittances to the Treasury declined from $107 billion (or 0.4 percent of GDP) in 2022 to less than $1 billion in 2023—the lowest amount as a share of the economy since remittances began in 1947. That sharp drop occurred because higher short-term interest rates increased the Federal Reserve System’s interest expenses to such an extent that they exceeded its income. When a Federal Reserve bank’s expenses exceed its income, it records the difference as a deferred asset (or negative liability) and suspends remittances to the Treasury.\n\nAlthough CBO estimates that the Federal Reserve System as a whole will have losses through 2025, the agency’s baseline projections show small remittances for the next few years to account for the possibility that some individual Federal Reserve banks might record profits and remit them to the Treasury. As falling inflation allows the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, the system returns to net profitability in 2026 in CBO’s projections. Those profits gradually reduce the deferred asset through 2028; thereafter, remittances return to 0.4 percent of GDP—reflecting the difference between the income the Federal Reserve earns on its portfolio of assets and the interest it pays to banks that hold reserves with the central bank. CBO’s estimates of remittances are highly uncertain because they depend on the path of short-term interest rates in the projection period.\n\nMiscellaneous Fees and Fines. Receipts from other fees and fines totaled $38 billion, or 0.1 percent of GDP, in 2023. Those receipts are projected to remain at 0.1 percent of GDP every year through 2034.\n\nTax Expenditures\n\nMany exclusions, deductions, credits, and preferential rates in the federal tax system cause revenues to be lower than they would be otherwise for any underlying set of tax rates. Such provisions resemble federal spending and contribute to the budget deficit; thus, they are known as tax expenditures.\n\nLike federal spending, tax expenditures provide financial assistance for specific activities, entities, or groups of people. However, the budgetary treatment of tax expenditures differs from that of spending programs. Tax expenditures increase the deficit by reducing the government’s revenue collections, although the amount of forgone revenues attributable to specific tax expenditures (or to tax expenditures in general) is not typically recorded separately in the budget, unlike outlays for each spending program. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires that the federal budget list tax expenditures. The Administration regularly publishes estimates of tax expenditures prepared by the Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis, and the Congress publishes estimates prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT).\n\nTax expenditures have a large effect on the federal budget. In fiscal year 2024, the value of all the tax expenditures in the individual and corporate income tax systems (including their effects on payroll taxes) is estimated to be $2.1 trillion, or 7.4 percent of GDP. That amount, which was calculated by CBO on the basis of estimates prepared by JCT, equals about 43 percent of all federal revenues in 2024 and exceeds projected outlays for all discretionary programs combined (see Figure 1-6).\n\nFigure 1-6.\n\nEstimated Outlays, Revenues, and Tax Expenditures in 2024\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nSimply adding up the estimates for specific tax expenditures does not account for the interactions that may occur among those tax provisions. For instance, the total tax expenditure for all itemized deductions would be smaller than the sum of the separate tax expenditures for each deduction. The reason is that all taxpayers would claim the standard deduction if there were no itemized deductions; but if only one or a few itemized deductions were removed, many taxpayers would still choose to itemize. The progressive structure of the tax brackets (meaning that higher rates apply to higher income) ensures that the opposite would be the case with income exclusions. In other words, the tax expenditure for all exclusions considered together would be greater than the sum of the separate tax expenditures for each exclusion. In 2024, those and other factors are expected to be approximately offsetting, so the total amount of tax expenditures is projected to roughly equal the sum of the individual tax expenditures.\n\nEstimates of tax expenditures measure the difference between households’ and businesses’ tax liability under current law and the tax liability they would have incurred if the provisions generating those tax expenditures were repealed and taxpayers’ behavior was unchanged. Such estimates do not represent the amount of revenues that would be raised if those provisions were eliminated, because the changes in incentives that would result from eliminating those provisions would lead households and businesses to modify their behavior in ways that would lessen the effect on revenues.\n\nThe Long-Term Outlook for the Budget\n\nBeyond the coming decade, the United States faces a challenging fiscal outlook. In CBO’s projections, deficits grow in relation to GDP as increases in outlays (largely driven by rising interest costs and greater spending for the major health care programs) outpace increases in revenues. Those growing deficits boost federal debt dramatically over the next three decades (see Table 1-9). In 2054, debt held by the public is projected to reach 172 percent of GDP—far larger than it has ever been—and be on track to rise even further (see Figure 1-2).\n\nTable 1-9.\n\nKey Projections in CBO’s Baseline, Adjusted to Exclude Effects of Timing Shifts, Through 2054\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nMeasured as a percentage of GDP, federal debt over the 2034–2053 period is smaller in CBO’s current projections than it was in the agency’s June 2023 projections. Deficits over that period are also now smaller than the agency projected last June. (See Box 1-3 for details about CBO’s long-term budget projections.)\n\nBox 1-3.\n\nCBO’s Long-Term Budget Projections\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office’s long-term projections follow the agency’s 10-year baseline budget projections and then extend the concepts underlying them for an additional 20 years—in this case, through 2054. Those projections are inherently uncertain because budgetary outcomes are hard to predict, particularly over the long run. That said, even if conditions were more favorable than CBO projects, federal debt held by the public measured in relation to the size of the economy would almost certainly be much greater in 30 years than it is today if current laws remain unchanged.\n\nDeficits and Debt\n\nIn CBO’s projections, federal deficits grow from 6.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2034 to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2054 because outlays start off larger than revenues in 2034 and increase faster than revenues over the subsequent 20 years. Primary deficits—that is, deficits excluding net outlays for interest—grow from 2.2 percent of GDP in 2034 to 2.6 percent in 2054, far less than total deficits grow.\n\nAs a result of mounting deficits, federal debt held by the public rises from 116 percent of GDP in 2034 to 172 percent of GDP in 2054. Such soaring debt would slow economic growth, push up interest payments to foreign holders of U.S. debt, and pose significant risks to the fiscal and economic outlook. It could also cause lawmakers to feel more constrained in their policy choices.\n\nSpending\n\nTotal outlays increase from 24.1 percent of GDP in 2034 to 27.9 percent in 2054 in CBO’s projections. Rising interest costs and growth in spending for the major health care programs, particularly Medicare, are significant drivers of that increase. Rising interest rates and mounting debt cause net interest costs to increase from 2034 to 2054, from 3.9 percent of GDP to 6.5 percent.\n\nNoninterest outlays—that is, all spending other than net outlays for interest—are projected to increase from 20.2 percent of GDP to 21.4 percent over the 20-year period. Mandatory spending increases from 15.1 percent of GDP in 2034 to 16.5 percent in 2054. Discretionary spending is projected to decline from 5.1 percent of GDP in 2034 to 4.9 percent in 2038 and is assumed to remain constant thereafter.\n\nRevenues\n\nRevenues increase from 17.9 percent of GDP in 2034 to 18.8 percent in 2054 in CBO’s projections. Receipts from individual income taxes rise in relation to GDP over that period as real income growth (that is, growth adjusted to remove the effects of inflation) pushes an increasing share of income into higher tax brackets—a process known as real bracket creep. Revenues from other sources, on net, change little from 2034 to 2054.\n\nChanges to CBO’s Long-Term Projections Since June 2023\n\nIn relation to the size of the economy, federal debt is now projected to be smaller throughout the 2034–2053 period than it was projected to be when CBO last published its long-term budget projections. All told, that difference is the net result of a decrease, measured as a percentage of GDP, in CBO’s projections of spending—primarily driven by changes in discretionary spending and net interest costs—and a reduction in projected revenues, measured as a percentage of GDP, throughout that period. (Nominal GDP, which has not been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation, is now projected to be higher than it was previously projected to be, so a given dollar amount of spending, revenues, deficits, or debt equals a smaller percentage of GDP in the current projections than it would have equaled in last year’s projections.)\n\nChanges to Deficits and Debt. Throughout the 2034–2053 period, both total federal deficits and primary deficits, measured as a percentage of GDP, are now projected to be smaller (by an average of 0.7 percentage points each) than they were in June 2023’s projections. As a result of changes to deficits, federal debt as a percentage of GDP is now projected to be lower and to grow more slowly throughout the 2034–2053 period than in last year’s projections. By 2053, that measure is projected to be 12 percentage points lower than it was last year.\n\nChanges to Spending. Measured as a percentage of GDP, total outlays over the 2034–2053 period are 0.9 percentage points lower, on average, in CBO’s current projections than they were in the agency’s June 2023 projections. Noninterest outlays measured as a percentage of GDP are also lower by 0.9 percentage points, on average, in the agency’s current projections than they were in last year’s.\n\nIn CBO’s projections and in relation to the size of the economy, the change in total outlays is largely driven by reductions in discretionary spending throughout the 2034–2053 period and changes in net interest costs. Measured as a percentage of GDP, net interest costs are higher from 2034 to 2046 and then lower from 2047 to 2053 than they were in last year’s projections. That is, relative to last year’s projections, increases in net interest costs measured as a percentage of GDP partially offset the decreases in discretionary spending in the initial years of the period. By the end of the 20-year period, discretionary spending and net interest costs are both lower in this year’s projections than in last year’s.\n\nChanges to Revenues. CBO’s current projections of revenues measured as a percentage of GDP for the 2034–2053 period are 0.2 percentage points lower, on average, than its June 2023 projections. The agency revised downward its projections of receipts from individual income taxes for several reasons; the largest change arises because CBO now projects that the amount of interest paid on mortgages, which is deductible for taxpayers who itemize, is higher than it projected in June.\n\nUncertainty of Budget Projections\n\nCBO’s baseline budget projections are intended to show what would happen to federal spending, revenues, deficits, and debt if current laws governing spending and taxes generally remained the same. Changes to laws—particularly those affecting fiscal policies—could lead to budgetary outcomes that diverged considerably from those in the baseline.\n\nEven if federal laws remained unchanged for the next decade, actual budgetary outcomes would differ from CBO’s baseline projections because of unanticipated changes in economic conditions and in other factors (such as administrative actions, regulatory changes, and judicial decisions) that affect federal spending and revenues. For example, CBO’s projections of outlays and revenues—and therefore its projections of deficits and debt—depend in part on the agency’s economic projections, which include forecasts for wage growth, interest rates, inflation, and economic growth. Actual outcomes for those variables are likely to differ from CBO’s projections.\n\nA comparison of CBO’s past projections with actual outcomes indicates the magnitude of the uncertainty of the agency’s budget projections. On the basis of an analysis of its past projections, CBO estimates that there is an approximately two-thirds chance that, under current law, the deficit in 2025 would be between 5.0 percent and 7.1 percent of GDP (see Figure 1-7). (The baseline projection of the deficit for that year is 6.1 percent of GDP.) The range in 2029 would be wider: CBO estimates that, under current law, there is a roughly two-thirds chance that the deficit for that year would be between 2.9 percent and 7.9 percent of GDP. (The baseline projection for that year is 5.4 percent of GDP.) The range of outcomes would be wider still in later years.\n\nFigure 1-7.\n\nUncertainty of CBO’s Baseline Projections of the Budget Deficit\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nChapter 2: The Economic Outlook\n\nOverview\n\nThe projections for the federal budget described in Chapter 1 are based in part on recent economic developments and the Congressional Budget Office’s projections of how the economy will perform in coming years. In calendar year 2023, the U.S. economy grew faster than it did in 2022, even as inflation slowed. In addition, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate to its highest level since 2001. (That rate, which financial institutions charge each other for overnight loans of their monetary reserves, affects interest rates throughout the economy.)\n\nEconomic growth is projected to slow in 2024, accompanied by increased unemployment and lower inflation. CBO expects the Federal Reserve to respond to slowing economic activity by reducing interest rates, starting in the middle of the calendar year. Economic growth is expected to rebound in 2025 and then moderate in later years. CBO projects that a surge in the rate of net immigration that began in 2022 will continue through 2026. That rise in the number of people who enter the United States minus the number who leave is projected to expand the labor force and increase economic growth.\n\nCBO’s economic projections reflect developments in the economy as of December 5, 2023, and the assumption that current laws governing federal taxes and spending generally remain in place. The projections also incorporate the effects of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5), which limits federal funding for discretionary programs over the next two years, as described in Chapter 1.\n\nGross Domestic Product\n\nEconomic output, as measured by the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), grew by 3.1 percent in 2023 in real terms (that is, adjusted to remove the effects of inflation). The growth of real GDP is projected to slow to 1.5 percent in 2024 (see Figure 2-1) as consumer spending increases more slowly and investment in private nonresidential structures, such as offices, declines. (Unless this report indicates otherwise, all annual growth rates are measured from the fourth quarter of one calendar year to the fourth quarter of the next year.)\n\nFigure 2-1.\n\nGrowth of Real GDP\n\nPercent\n\nReal GDP growth is projected to increase to 2.2 percent in 2025 after the Federal Reserve responds to weaker economic conditions in the middle of 2024 by lowering interest rates. CBO projects that growth in 2025 will be supported by increased economic activity in sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as residential investment and consumer spending. CBO also projects that high rates of net immigration through 2026 will support economic growth, adding an average of about 0.2 percentage points to the annual growth rate of real GDP over the 2024–2034 period.\n\nBeyond 2026, CBO’s projections of real GDP are driven mainly by its projections of real potential GDP (the maximum sustainable output of the economy). CBO expects real GDP to grow at an average rate of 2.0 percent a year from 2027 to 2034—similar to the average growth rate of potential GDP over the past 20 years.\n\nThe Labor Market\n\nAs economic growth slows in 2024, the demand for labor is expected to soften, slowing the growth of payroll employment (the number of employees on businesses’ payrolls). The unemployment rate, which was 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, is projected to rise to 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 and then remain at 4.4 percent, on average, from 2025 to 2034 (see Table 2-1). The labor force is expected to keep growing at a moderate pace through 2026 as continued high rates of net immigration more than offset a projected decline in the rate of labor force participation stemming from weaker demand for workers and the rising average age of the population (referred to as the aging of the population).\n\nTable 2-1.\n\nCBO’s Economic Projections for Calendar Years 2024 to 2034\n\nPercent\n\nInflation\n\nThe rate at which overall prices rise each year is expected to slow further in 2024—to a rate roughly in line with the Federal Reserve’s long-run goal of 2 percent—and then tick up in 2025, before declining slightly. CBO projects that inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, will fall from 2.9 percent in 2023 to 2.1 percent in 2024, reflecting softer demand for labor and slower increases in rents. Inflation is projected to tick up to 2.2 percent in 2025 as factors that have tended to limit price increases for food and energy recede and as stronger economic activity modestly increases the pressure on prices for some types of services. CBO projects that inflation will decline to 2.1 percent in 2026 and then average 2.0 percent a year through 2034.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nShort-term interest rates are expected to remain stable through the first quarter of 2024, decline gradually through the middle of 2027, and remain roughly steady thereafter. CBO expects that after holding the federal funds rate between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent through the first quarter of 2024, the Federal Reserve will begin reducing that rate in the second quarter of 2024 in response to slowing inflation and rising unemployment. The federal funds rate is projected to fall to 2.9 percent by mid-2027 and stay roughly steady in later years. The interest rate on three-month Treasury bills is projected to follow a similar path.\n\nLonger-term interest rates, such as the rate on 10-year Treasury notes, are typically higher than short-term rates. Although that was not the case in early 2024, CBO projects that the 10-year rate will increase relative to short-term rates, and the spread between them will gradually return to its long-run average. The 10-year rate, which was 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, is projected to rise to 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, before falling to 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2026. After that, the 10-year rate is expected to rise gradually to 4.1 percent by 2034.\n\nIncome\n\nAs the demand for labor softens, the growth of employee compensation is projected to slow over the 2024–2034 period. GDP is expected to grow more slowly than compensation during that period. As a result, labor income as a percentage of GDP is projected to increase from 55.9 percent at the end of 2023 to 57.0 percent by the end of 2027 and then remain generally stable.\n\nDomestic corporate profits, which have been elevated in recent years, are projected to grow more slowly than GDP over the 2024–2027 period because of increases in interest payments and employee compensation. As a result, domestic corporate profits are projected to decrease from 9.8 percent of GDP at the end of 2023 to 9.2 percent by the end of 2027 and remain roughly steady as a percentage of GDP thereafter.\n\nUncertainty About the Economic Outlook\n\nCBO develops its projections so they fall in the middle of the likely range of outcomes under current law. Those projections are highly uncertain, and many factors could lead to different outcomes. That uncertainty arises from various domestic factors as well as from developments outside the United States.\n\nIn the short run, key sources of uncertainty include the projected paths for consumer spending, inflation, and interest rates. Consumer spending could grow faster than CBO anticipates, leading to stronger economic growth; in addition, inflation could fall more slowly than CBO projects, which could affect the outlook for interest rates and income growth. Beyond the short run, important areas of uncertainty about the economy include the pace of advances in technology, the strength of the demand for Treasury securities from U.S. and foreign investors, and the size of the U.S. population.\n\nComparison With CBO’s Previous Economic Projections\n\nReal GDP grew more in 2023 than CBO forecast in February 2023, when it published its previous set of 11-year economic projections. That economic strength was driven by more robust growth of consumer spending, business investment, and exports than CBO had expected.\n\nCBO is now projecting a lower average rate of economic growth from 2024 to 2027 than it did last February (2.0 percent a year versus 2.4 percent), largely because of slower projected growth in sectors of the economy that are sensitive to interest rates, such as consumer spending, investment, and net exports. The downward revision to economic growth resulting from higher projected interest rates is partly offset by an increase in economic activity over the 2024–2027 period stemming from greater projected net immigration. From 2028 to 2033, real GDP is now projected to grow at a higher average rate than CBO forecast last February (2.0 percent a year versus 1.8 percent), mainly because of faster projected growth in output per worker and the larger labor force.\n\nCBO has lowered its projection of the average unemployment rate over the 2024–2027 period (to 4.3 percent from 4.7 percent) because of stronger-than-expected economic growth in 2023. That stronger growth pushed the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 below what CBO forecast last February. Although the unemployment rate is projected to rise in 2024 as the economy slows, it is expected to be lower, on average, than in CBO’s previous projections. After 2027, CBO’s projections of the unemployment rate are roughly the same as they were last February.\n\nThe average rate of participation in the labor force is now projected to be higher from 2024 through 2033 than CBO projected last February (62.0 percent versus 61.7 percent). That increase results partly from the effects of upward revisions to CBO’s projections of net immigration from 2022 through 2026.\n\nCBO’s current projections of inflation are mixed relative to its February 2023 projections: lower in some cases and higher in others. Prices increased less in 2023 than CBO had anticipated, even though economic growth was stronger than expected. Inflation in 2024 is now projected to be slightly lower than CBO forecast last February. For 2025, CBO has reduced its projection of inflation as measured by the growth of the PCE price index but has slightly increased its projection of another measure of inflation, the growth of the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U). The reason for the difference is that the CPI-U places greater weight on the cost of shelter than the PCE price index does, and CBO now expects shelter costs to rise more in 2025 than previously forecast because of faster growth in home prices.\n\nShort-term interest rates are expected to be higher in 2024 and 2025 than CBO forecast last February. That change reflects the stronger-than-anticipated economic activity in 2023, which led the Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the federal funds rate higher than CBO had projected. After 2027, both short-term and long-term interest rates are now expected to be slightly higher than previously projected.\n\nProjections of nominal labor income over the 2024–2027 period are largely unchanged since last February. CBO has increased its forecast of labor income after 2027, mainly because of higher projections of employment. In addition, corporate profits are now projected to be larger than previously forecast; that change is consistent with recent revisions by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to data about past profits.\n\nComparison With Other Economic Projections\n\nCBO’s projections of real GDP growth are roughly in line with those of outside forecasters. Its projections of interest rates on 10-year Treasury notes over the next year and a half are higher than those of most other forecasters.\n\nRecent Economic Developments\n\nThe U.S. economy grew strongly in 2023, following modest growth in 2022. That acceleration was propelled by stronger growth of consumer spending and nonresidential investment. Inflation slowed in 2023—because of looser constraints on the supply of goods affected by pandemic-related disruptions and slower growth of shelter-related prices—but remained above the Federal Reserve’s long-run goal. Responding to elevated inflation, the central bank continued raising the federal funds rate, which reached its highest level in 22 years. The growth of the labor force increased, employment grew at a strong pace, the unemployment rate hovered near its 60-year low for much of 2023, and the number of job vacancies remained high.\n\nOutput and the Labor Market\n\nFollowing growth of 0.7 percent in 2022, real GDP grew by 3.1 percent in 2023. Increases in consumer spending contributed 1.8 percentage points to that 3.1 percent growth rate, and increases in government spending contributed 0.7 percentage points. A slowdown in inventory investment by businesses subtracted 0.3 percentage points from GDP growth in 2023.\n\nDemand for labor remained strong in much of 2023; at the same time, the supply of labor grew steadily. Nonfarm payroll employment increased by an average of more than 229,000 jobs per month in 2023, ending the year about 4.7 million jobs (or roughly 3 percent) higher than its prepandemic peak in February 2020. Despite the increase in employment, the unemployment rate rose slightly in 2023—from 3.5 percent at the end of 2022 to 3.7 percent in December 2023—as the labor force expanded more quickly than employment did.\n\nThe overall rate of participation in the labor force increased in 2023, mainly because of strong growth in the participation of workers ages 25 to 54. The labor force participation rate of those prime-age workers now exceeds its prepandemic peak. The participation rate of workers age 55 or older has not fully recovered from its large drop in the early months of the pandemic.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment included roughly 1.3 million more jobs in 2023 than CBO projected for that year in January 2020, just before the pandemic. That greater-than-expected employment resulted from a larger population, a higher rate of labor force participation among prime-age workers, and a lower unemployment rate than CBO anticipated in January 2020.\n\nThe number of job openings per unemployed worker decreased in 2023, although it remained larger than its prepandemic average. That decrease contributed to a slowdown in the growth of compensation.\n\nInflation and Interest Rates\n\nAlthough inflation slowed significantly in 2023, it remained higher than the Federal Reserve’s long-run goal of 2 percent. Inflation as measured by the growth of the PCE price index declined from 5.9 percent in 2022 to 2.7 percent in 2023, while the annual growth of the CPI-U dropped from 7.1 percent to 3.2 percent. By comparison, PCE inflation averaged 1.5 percent a year from 2010 to 2019, and CPI-U inflation averaged 1.7 percent. Large price increases in 2023 were mostly concentrated in the service sector; many goods experienced small increases. The PCE price index for goods was unchanged in 2023, whereas the index for services rose by 4.1 percent.\n\nSome factors that had fueled inflation in 2022, such as pressures on supply chains and steep increases in home prices, eased during 2023. In the first half of the year, the PCE price index grew at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent, driven by large increases in the prices of shelter services, services other than shelter and energy, and motor vehicles. In the second half of 2023, PCE inflation declined to an average annual rate of 2.1 percent as prices for motor vehicles and various services began to grow more slowly.\n\nIn response to higher inflation than its long-run goal, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate from 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2023 to 5.3 percent during the second half of the year. As a result, in December 2023, the federal funds rate remained at its highest level since February 2001.\n\nThe interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes increased from an average of 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 to an average of 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023. That rate varied substantially during 2023, rising from an average of 3.5 percent in April to an average of 4.8 percent in October, before falling to an average of 4.0 percent in December.\n\nProjections of Gross Domestic Product and Its Components\n\nIn CBO’s projections—which reflect the assumption that current laws governing federal taxes and spending generally remain unchanged—real GDP grows modestly this year and then more strongly next year. After 2025, the growth of real GDP stabilizes at approximately the same rate as the growth of potential output (the amount of real GDP that can be produced if labor and capital are employed at their maximum sustainable rates).\n\nSpecifically, the growth of real GDP, which was 3.1 percent in 2023, is projected to slow to 1.5 percent in 2024 because of weak growth in spending by consumers and governments and in investment by businesses (see Table 2-2). In 2025, stronger growth in consumer spending and investment is projected to push economic growth up to 2.2 percent. That increase largely reflects the stimulative effects of lower interest rates and the stronger growth in residential investment that is expected to result from continued high rates of net immigration (see Box 2-1). CBO projects that the high rate of net immigration that began in 2022 will continue through 2026, adding an average of about 0.2 percentage points to the annual growth rate of real GDP during the 2024–2034 period. From 2026 to 2034, real GDP is projected to grow by 2.0 percent a year, on average, roughly in line with the growth of aggregate supply (the total productive capacity of the economy, which depends on the supplies of labor, capital, and technology).\n\nTable 2-2.\n\nProjected Growth of Real GDP and Its Components\n\nBox 2-1.\n\nEconomic Effects of CBO’s Revised Population Projections\n\nThe size and age composition of the U.S. population are important factors in the Congressional Budget Office’s economic projections. CBO now projects that the population over the next 10 years will be larger—and more concentrated among people ages 16 to 54—than it projected last year. Those increases result from higher projections of net immigration (the number of people who migrate to the United States minus the number who leave) and lower projections of mortality rates.\n\nThe changes to CBO’s population projections affect the agency’s projections of economic activity by increasing the overall demand for goods and services, expanding the labor force, and altering productivity. A larger population is projected to put modest downward pressure on total factor productivity (TFP) in the near term but moderate upward pressure on TFP after 2027. CBO also estimates that the increase in population will put downward pressure on average real wages in the near term. That effect is projected to partially reverse after 2027, but average real wages are expected to be slightly lower by 2034 than they would be otherwise.\n\nMost of the increase in the projected population reflects larger net immigration. That greater immigration is projected to boost the growth rate of the nation’s real gross domestic product (GDP) by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year from 2024 to 2034, leaving real GDP roughly 2 percent larger in 2034 than it would be otherwise. Real GDP per person, however, would be 0.8 percent smaller in 2034 because of the increase in immigration than it would be otherwise, in CBO’s assessment.\n\nPopulation Projections\n\nCBO now expects that the civilian population age 16 or older in 2033 will be larger by 7.4 million people, or 2.6 percent, than the agency previously projected. Most of that increase (5.9 million) represents a rise in the net number of people expected to immigrate to the United States. The rest stems from lower mortality rates because of a reduction in projected deaths from COVID-19.\n\nThe foreign nationals added to CBO’s current population projections because of greater net immigration are projected to include a larger share of people under age 55, both male and female, than in the overall U.S. population. In CBO’s projections, 91 percent of the additional foreign nationals age 16 or older who immigrate to the United States from 2022 to 2034 are under age 55, compared with 62 percent of the overall U.S. population age 16 or older during that period. Those additional foreign nationals include people who enter the United States lawfully through the use of parole authority and people who enter illegally.\n\nHow Changes in the Projected Population Affect the Economy\n\nIncreases in the population boost the demand for goods, services, and housing. They also expand the productive capacity of the economy by increasing the size of the labor force. The increases to CBO’s population projections have raised projected consumer spending over the 2027–2033 period by roughly 2 percent, or 1.4 percent of GDP—and raised projected residential investment (such as spending on housing construction and home improvements) ov"
