        "text": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is divided into five stages. The stages are based on the eGFR test result and how well your kidneys work to filter waste and extra fluid out of your blood. As the stages go up, kidney disease gets worse and your kidneys work less well. At each stage, it is important to take steps to slow down the damage to your kidneys.\n\nWhat do the stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) refer to?\n\nThe five stages of CKD refer to how well your kidneys are working. Kidney disease can get worse in time. In the early stages (Stages 1–3), your kidneys are still able to filter waste out of your blood. In the later stages (Stages 4–5), your kidneys must work harder to filter your blood and may stop working altogether.\n\nThe goal at each stage of CKD is to take steps to slow down the damage to your kidneys and keep your kidneys working as long as possible.\n\nStage 3 of CKD (eGFR between 30 and 59)\n\nStage 3 CKD means you have an eGFR between 30 and 59 and mild to moderate damage to your kidneys. Your kidneys do not work as well as they should to filter waste and extra fluid out of your blood. This waste can build up in your body and begin to cause other health problems, such as high blood pressure and bone disease. You may begin to have symptoms, such as feeling weak and tired or swelling in your hands or feet.\n\nStage 3 CKD is split into two substages based on your eGFR:\n\nStage 3a means you have an eFGR between 45 and 59\n\nStage 3b means you have an eGFR between 30 and 44\n\nWith treatment and healthy life changes, many people in Stage 3 do not move to Stage 4 or Stage 5.\n\nLearn more about stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD)\n\nStage 4 of CKD (eGFR between 15 and 29)\n\nStage 4 CKD means you have an eGFR between 15 and 29 and moderate to severe damage to your kidneys. Your kidneys do not work as well as they should to filter waste out of your blood. This waste can build up in your body and cause other health problems, such as high blood pressure, bone disease and heart disease. You will likely have symptoms such as swelling of your hands and feet and pain in your lower back.\n\nThis is the last stage before kidney failure. It is important to have regular visits with a nephrologist (kidney doctor) to take steps to slow kidney damage and plan ahead for possible treatments for kidney failure.\n\nLearn more about stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD)"
