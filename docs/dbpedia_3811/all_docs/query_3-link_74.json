        "text": "Julie Rubio, President of Women in Film SF Bay Area, and known for producing the acclaimed fictional 'East Side Sushi,' a Bay Area favorite and one of the Top 20 Bay Area Films of the Decade by Mercury News, now showcases her storytelling prowess in the documentary genre with 'The True Story of Tamara de Lempicka & The Art of Survival.' This visually stunning documentary weaves an immersive tale of the renowned painter's life, from 1920s Paris to fleeing fascism in the 1940s. Featuring rare insights from Broadway star Eden Espinosa, an exclusive look into Barbra Streisand's collection, and other notable celebrity contributions, Rubio's latest project continues her commitment to centering women's voices and crafting compelling narratives.\n\nJoin us for a behind-the-scenes exploration of how Rubio vividly brings Tamara's extraordinary legacy to the screen, a tale of resilience and artistic freedom that continues to inspire globally.\n\nHeather Anderson: Julie, as the driving force behind this film, what inspired you to tell the story of Tamara de Lempicka, and what makes this documentary unique?\n\nJulie Rubio: I met Tamara de Lempicka's family 20 years ago when they were looking for a writer, producer, and director for the project, and I fell in love with her story. This is the first documentary about her life, exploring her as a remarkable refugee who reinvents herself multiple times. And as women, we have to do that so much in our lives. Our film looks behind the veneer of the publicity that she generated for herself and examines the bisexual Jewish artist who embodied such talent and resilience. She's such an amazing artist - really one of the most talented artists of the 20th century.\n\nHA: Wow, so this project began 20 years ago essentially?!\n\nJR: Yes! Securing funding was a huge challenge, especially for a woman-led narrative film spanning two wars and multiple global locations, from Poland to Beverly Hills. But when the pandemic lockdown began, we just put our heads down, pivoted from a narrative format to documentary, and got it done.\n\nHA: Can you share some behind-the-scenes insights or interesting moments you experienced while making this film?\n\nJR: At the beginning of the pandemic, we were questioning everything - questioning the value of art. Like how important is art when the world is maybe ending? The answer was: very! Here we all were, bingeing series in order to just have some normality and feel connected to each other. I picked up the phone and called Barbra Streisand, her most notable collector. I thought to myself, There's no way anyone on her team is going to talk to me, let alone pass me through. And not only did she take my request - and give me the high resolution images of her private collection to be used in the film, but she worked with me for over eight months and really helped me craft her section of the film. I’d been ready to give up - she didn’t know that, but she gave me breath. She gave me energy, she gave me hope.\n\nHA: Awww, you know I live for stories of women generously helping each other. Speaking of which, I know the film features additional contributions from notable personalities like Anjelica Huston, Eden Espinosa, and Madonna. How did these collaborations enrich the narrative of the film?\n\nJR: Yes! Eden Espinosa - who’s interviewed in the film, is playing Lempicka in the musical set for Broadway in March, 2024, and she is absolutely incredible.\n\nThe film also spotlights Madonna, a huge fan and collector of Lempicka's work. Madonna has incorporated Tamara’s imagery into iconic music videos such as \"Vogue,\" \"Open Your Heart,\" and \"Express Yourself.\" She’s also recently showcased this imagery in her 2023-2024 world concert, \"The Celebration Tour,” and you can see Tamara’s influence in Madonna’s own branding.\n\nAnjelica Huston lends her voice to the film, sharing personal tales such as how she wore Tamara’s jewelry—gifts from Jack Nicholson—on the night she won her Oscar. She also discusses her starring role in the play “Tamara.”\n\nHA: As a producer and director, how did you approach the challenge of weaving together Tamara de Lempicka's personal history with her art and cultural impact?\n\nJR: I let the movie organically have its own voice, going beyond the surface of Tamara being just a bisexual, sexy, gorgeous woman. In my exploration, I found out more about her hidden Jewish heritage. Speaking with a gentleman in Poland, he provided footage of her grandparents' tomb in a Jewish cemetery, confirming that her family was Jewish. It was fascinating to uncover these hidden aspects of her life, like her real last name being Hurwitz and the fact that she altered her birth date. This hiding of her religion was all about survival, which makes the film so timely with current events echoing past histories of anti-Semitism and conflict.\n\nTamara's personal life was complex; while everyone knew of her bisexuality and marriages, few knew about her 30-year relationship with her lover and best friend, Ira Perrot. You can see her headspace and life events reflected in her art. After moving to the States, she had to adapt significantly; she couldn't paint nudes or express her bisexuality openly due to the societal dangers then. She was a trailblazer in many ways, not just in art but in living life on her own terms. This aspect of being 'other,' of being different, resonates strongly. She teaches us about self-expression and the importance of being true to oneself.\n\nHA: Tamara de Lempicka is a significant figure in art history. In your view, what is her lasting impact, especially on female artists?\n\nJR: Tamara de Lempicka significantly impacted female artists by breaking down barriers and leading them into a world of creative choice. Her art vividly captures her struggles, turmoil, and truths, effectively exposing not just her secrets but ours as well. Her humanity and bravery are palpable in her works. She's rightfully earned her place in art history, which is being celebrated with the first retrospective of her work at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, among other global exhibitions. This is truly her time, reflecting a broader movement for women to support each other and amplify our collective voices. We're currently hearing only half of the voices in the room; it's crucial to listen and incorporate the ideas and solutions of the other 50%, who have so much to contribute.\n\nHA: Julie, you mentioned earlier about the challenges in funding your movie, a journey spanning 20 years. This brings to mind a broader issue in the film industry. Could you touch on the disparity in funding for films by and about women, especially from a statistical perspective?\n\nJR: The situation for women directors, especially Hispanic women, is disheartening. We're not seeing the progress we need in the film industry. As of 2023, women struggle to get our projects funded, hindering our growth and development. It's essential for women to have the opportunity to create, to make those initial films, no matter their quality. We need those 10,000 hours, to make those first few subpar movies, the ability to progress and eventually make great films. This disparity in funding also limits our representation in film, impacting how our daughters and sons see women's roles in society. We need more films by women, about women, in roles that are diverse and respectful. I urge those in power to help level the playing field and provide these crucial opportunities.\n\nHA: I love where this is going. Let's talk about funding, which is essential for your project's final push. I'm curious about the specific needs for completing your film. Is there a set amount you're aiming for, or are you open to whatever support you can get?\n\nJR: We're currently asking for $35 per ticket as a donation, slightly higher than regular movie tickets, to support our project. For tax-deductible contributions, you can donate through The Film Collaborative under “Tamara”. This support is vital as most of our team are women, and it helps preserve Tamara de Lempicka's legacy. The funds are crucial for sound perfection, creating closed captions and subtitles for various countries, sound descriptions, and preparing for film festivals. There are specific requirements for film delivery, including different format edits and files like DCP, SRT, and SCC. We're aiming to participate in major film festivals like Sundance, Tribeca, Cannes, Venice, and more, so every bit of support helps us reach these milestones.\n\nJoin us for an exclusive private benefit screening of our captivating film, \"The True Story of Tamara de Lempicka & The Art of Survival.\" (runtime 1 hr 35 min)\n\nWatch here:\n\nYou can access the film screening at the following link: https://watch.eventive.org/.../play/653e9ff2301b5500686436df\n\nGather your friends, watch with your family, watch on your own!\n\nSuggested donation is $35 per screen.
