        "text": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder that affects the way a person thinks, acts, expresses emotions, perceives reality, and relates to others. Schizophrenia isnât as common as other major mental illnesses, affecting less than 1% of the U.S. adult population, but it can be one of the most chronic and disabling.\n\nPeople with schizophrenia often have problems functioning in society, work, school, and relationships. They might feel scared and withdrawn or appear to have lost touch with reality. This lifelong disease doesnât have a cure; however, it can be controlled with proper treatment.\n\nContrary to popular belief, schizophrenia is not a split or multiple personality. Schizophrenia involves psychosis, a type of mental illness in which you canât tell whatâs real from whatâs imagined. At times, people with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia lose touch with reality. Their world may blend confusing thoughts, images, and sounds together. Because of their distorted reality, people with this condition may show strange and even shocking behavior. A sudden change in their personality or behavior is called a psychotic episode.\n\nThe severity of schizophrenia varies from person to person. Some people have only one psychotic episode, while others have many episodes during their lifetime. In between psychotic episodes, you may lead a relatively normal life. Still, others may have more trouble functioning over time, with little improvement between full-blown psychotic episodes. Schizophrenia symptoms seem to worsen, then improve, in cycles known as relapses and remissions.\n\nSchizophrenia Symptoms\n\nEarly schizophrenia symptoms\n\nSchizophrenia usually shows its first signs in men during their late teens or early 20s, and in women in their late 20s to early 30s. It affects men and women at an equal rate. The period when symptoms first start and before full psychosis appears is called the prodromal period. It can last days, weeks, or even years. The prodromal period can be hard to identify because thereâs often no specific trigger. You might only notice subtle behavioral changes, especially in teens. This includes:\n\nA change in grades\n\nSocial withdrawal\n\nTrouble concentrating\n\nTemper flares\n\nDifficulty sleeping\n\nPositive schizophrenia symptoms\n\nIn this case, the word positive doesnât mean good. It refers to added thoughts or actions that arenât based on reality. Theyâre sometimes called psychotic symptoms. The symptoms can include:\n\nDelusions . These are false, mixed, and sometimes strange beliefs that arenât based on reality. The person refuses to give up these beliefs, even when shown the facts. For example, a person with delusions may believe that people can hear their thoughts, that they are God or the devil, or that people are putting thoughts into their head or plotting against them.\n\nHallucinations. These involve sensations that aren't real. Hearing voices is the most common hallucination in people with schizophrenia. The voices may comment on the person's behavior, insult them, or give commands. Less common types include seeing things that aren't there, smelling strange odors, having a funny taste in your mouth, and feeling sensations on your skin even though nothing is touching your body.\n\nCatatonia. In this condition, the person may stop speaking, and their body may be fixed in a single position for an extended period.Â\n\nDisorganized schizophrenia symptoms\n\nThese are positive symptoms showing the person canât think clearly or respond as expected. Examples include:\n\nTalking in sentences that donât make sense or using nonsense words, making it difficult for the person to communicate or hold a conversation. This is referred to as disorganized speech.\n\nShifting quickly from one thought to the next without obvious or logical connections between them\n\nSlow movement\n\nBeing unable to make decisions\n\nWriting a lot but without meaning\n\nForgetting or losing things\n\nRepeating movements or gestures, such as pacing or walking in circles\n\nHaving problems making sense of everyday sights, sounds, and feelings\n\nBrain chemistry and circuits. People with schizophrenia may not be able to regulate brain chemicals called neurotransmitters that control specific pathways, or \"circuits,\" of nerve cells that affect thinking and behavior.\n\nBrain abnormality. Research has found abnormal brain structure in people with schizophrenia. But this doesnât apply to all people with schizophrenia. It can affect people without the disease.\n\nEnvironment. Â Viral infections, marijuana, smoking, childhood trauma, social defeat, malnutrition, vitamin D deficiency, social cognition, and lower intelligence quotient may play a part in triggering schizophrenia in people whose genetic makeup puts them at risk. Schizophrenia more often surfaces when the body is having hormonal and physical changes, such as during the teen and young adult years.\n\nSchizophrenia Diagnosis\n\nIf symptoms of schizophrenia are present, your doctor will perform a complete medical history and sometimes a physical exam. While there are no laboratory tests to specifically diagnose schizophrenia, the doctor may use various tests, including blood tests or brain imaging studies, to rule out another physical illness or intoxication (substance-induced psychosis) as the cause of the symptoms.\n\nIf your doctor finds no other physical reason for the schizophrenia symptoms, they may refer you or your loved one to a psychiatrist or psychologist -- mental health professionals trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a psychotic disorder. The therapist bases their diagnosis on the person's and family's report of symptoms and their observation of the person's attitude and behavior.\n\nNote: Clozapine is the only FDA-approved medication for treating schizophrenia that is resistant to other treatments. Itâs also used to lessen suicidal behaviors in those with schizophrenia who are at risk.\n\nA new class of pharmaceutical drugs calledÂ muscarinic agonists are currently under trial for the treatment of schizophrenia.\n\nCoordinated specialty care (CSC)\n\nThis is a team approach to treat schizophrenia when the first symptoms appear. It combines medicine and therapy with social services, employment, and educational interventions, with the family involved as much as possible. Early treatment is key to helping people with the condition lead healthy lives.\n\nPsychosocial therapy\n\nWhile medication may help ease symptoms of schizophrenia, various psychosocial treatments can help with the behavioral, psychological, social, and occupational problems that come with the illness. Through therapy, people can also learn to manage their symptoms, identify early warning signs of relapse, and come up with a relapse prevention plan. Psychosocial therapies include:\n\nRehabilitation, which focuses on social skills and job training to help people with schizophrenia function in the community and live as independently as possible\n\nCognitive remediation, which involves learning techniques to overcome problems with information processing. Drills, coaching, and computer-based exercises may strengthen mental skills that involve attention, memory, planning, and organization.\n\nIndividual psychotherapy, which can help the person better understand their illness and learn coping and problem-solving skills\n\nFamily therapy, which can help family members cope with and support a loved one who has schizophrenia\n\nGroup therapy/support groups, which can provide continuing mutual support\n\nHospitalization\n\nMany people with schizophrenia may be treated as outpatients. But hospitalization may be the best option for people:\n\nWith severe symptoms\n\nWho might harm themselves or others\n\nWho canât take care of themselves at home\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT)\n\nIn this procedure, electrodes are attached to the person's scalp. While theyâre asleep under general anesthesia, doctors send a small electric shock to the brain. ECT therapy usually involves two to three treatments per week for several weeks. Each shock treatment causes a controlled seizure. A series of treatments over time leads to improvement in mood and thinking. Scientists donât fully understand how ECT and the controlled seizures it causes help. Some researchers think ECT-induced seizures may affect the release of neurotransmitters in the brain. ECT is less well-proven to help with schizophrenia than with depression or bipolar disorder, so it isnât used very often when mood symptoms are absent. It can help when medications no longer work, or if severe depression or catatonia makes treating the illness difficult.\n\nAre People With Schizophrenia Dangerous?\n\nPopular books and movies often depict people with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses as dangerous and violent. Most people with schizophrenia aren't violent. More often, they withdraw and prefer to be left alone. When people with mental illness do take part in dangerous or violent behaviors, itâs generally a result of their psychosis and the fear that theyâre being threatened in some way by their surroundings. Drug or alcohol use can make it worse.\n\nOn the other hand, people with schizophrenia can be a danger to themselves. Suicide is the top cause of premature death among people with schizophrenia."
