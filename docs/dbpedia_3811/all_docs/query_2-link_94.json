        "text": "Everything changed for Tamara Mena when a car accident left her paralyzed. Despite her adversity, nothing has stopped Tamara from having an accomplished career as an actress. She shares her inspiring story with us and her new documentary film, on Get It Girl. S7 E23\n\n2019 Easterseals Disability Film Challenge Entry “Dear Younger Me” is a Sci-Fi short film that follows the journey of two twelve year old best friends, Ariana and Zach, who are tired of their current lives and decide that they want to be older immediately. They build a time machine and they are transported into the bodies of themselves – only twenty years older. As adults, they comically discover their independence: to wear anything, to drive a car, to be successful and to even experience a first crush!\n\nHi my name is Tamara Mena. This is my official submission video for SPORTS ILLUSTRATED Swimsearch 2022!!!I wasn’t always in a wheelchair. I had a car accident when I was 19 that left me paralyzed from the chest down and killed my boyfriend. I was absolutely devastated. Just earlier that same day I was at the beach with him, feeling on top of the world! And in seconds my WHOLE world crumbled.\n\nThank you so much to the ENTIRE team that was part of this production, in front and behind the scenes because we all did this TOGETHER and thank you to the Los Angeles film school!!\n\nTamara Mena Hosting Reel\n\nHost, Actor & Speaker in a wheelchair! Degree in communication.\n\nAFTER surviving a horrific car accident and becoming paralyzed, and after many hospitalizations, surgeries and many challenges along the way, I graduated from college with the highest honors, summa cum laude! For two months I lost my voice, I could not say anything or write at a horrible time in my life. But from this I had a deep desire to use my voice to inspire people, to change stereotypes, to speak up for the voiceless and advocate for my community, but most of all, to encourage people to keep going in life, no matter what happens!!\n\nThere are No limits to what YOU CAN DO regardless of your limitations!"
