        "text": "Meagan Good and Tamara Bass met as teen actors at an audition in Hollywood more than 20 years ago, and they soon became fast friends.\n\nAnd even as the years passed and their fortunes in film and television diverged, their friendship held strong.\n\nGood, 39, has done steady work in movies such as “Think Like A Man,” “Anchorman 2,” and “Shazam,” as well as on TV. Bass, 42, found herself in that frustrating place where Hollywood sidelines talented actors they don’t know how to use.\n\nThen Bass sent Good a screenplay she’d written that revolved around the lives of four Black women who’d been friends since high school; “If Not Now, When?” had a role for each of them and the possibility of producing and co-directing, too.\n\nIn the movie, which premieres online on Friday, Jan. 8, the four women renew or strengthen their bonds when one enters rehab for a prescription pill addiction, an event that eventually pushes the others to deal with issues in their lives, too.\n\n“The genesis of it was a way for me to honor my friendships,” Bass says of her screenplay. “To honor the sisterhood that has shaped my life and has helped me form into the adult that I am.\n\n“Most of my friendships span at least 20 years,” she says. “And without them, I wouldn’t be the woman I am today, so I wanted to honor that.\n\n“It’s a giant love letter to those friendships.”\n\nGood loved those themes, too, and like Bass, saw it as a way to do something Hollywood hasn’t done a lot of in recent years: Make a drama about the lives and stories of Black women.\n\n“If I’m being truthful, the last two or three that I remember go all the way back to the ’90s: ‘Waiting to Exhale’ or ‘Set It Off’ or ‘The Women of Brewster Place.’ Most of the other ones I can think of are comedies.\n\n“So yeah, we had a bit of a challenge where some felt that people might not want to see this movie,” Good says.\n\n“I wanted to show a film that had universal themes that just happened to star Black women,” Bass says. “Instead of marginalizing our stories, making them normalized.\n\nBass says she drew upon the lives of her and her friends for storylines that range from addiction — Tyra, the character played by Good — to infertility and vulnerability — Patrice, Bass’s character breaks up with a good man because she fears he won’t love her if she can’t have children.\n\nDeidre, played by Meagan Holder, is a dancer and choreographer whose partner had previously pushed her to choose him over her career. Suzanne, portrayed by Mekia Cox, is successful in her career but miserable in her marriage to an unfaithful former football star.\n\n“Those characters were really, really rich for me,” Good says. “And I always wanted to do a movie like that, so when I read Tam’s script I was like, ‘This is it.’”\n\nBass says she pitched the idea of co-directing to Good at the start — they’d both done a handful of smaller directing jobs including a collaboration on the web series “All That Matters” that Bass had written and starred in.\n\nThat DIY sensibility is something Bass says she’s increasingly pursued as her jobs-for-hire in Hollywood slowed down.\n\n“I knew that as an actor I had hit this speed bump in my career, which made me really dig into writing and directing,” she says. “I kept hearing, ‘We don’t know what to do with her,’ so I was like, ‘You know what, in order for me to tell you what I am, let me create it.’”\n\nAs the film moved through development, Bass and Good brought in a Black female filmmaker to direct, but as the funds to make the movie were delayed, and delayed again, they lost the director to a different gig.\n\n“Oh my god, especially in the indie world, you have this plan and the world says, ‘Psych! We’re going to change it all up on you,’” Bass says, laughing.\n\nShe asked Good to reconsider co-directing their first feature film, and Good said she needed some time.\n\n“I said, ‘Let me pray about it because if I direct this, it’s going to take over my whole life for the whole time of shooting,’” Good says. “And I prayed about it for about two months, and I felt God telling me to do it three times.”\n\nSo she met with Bass to give her that news, adding that she still could use one more sign to let her know that she’d interpreted her prayers accurately.\n\n“And eight minutes later, the bank called and they said the money (for the movie) just landed,” Good says. “So that was kind of my guiding light of positivity. No matter what went wrong, anything that came up or that we faced, I just felt confident that it was going to work out.”\n\nTheir plan had been to swap days as director. If one was slated to be in front of the camera, the other would be behind it.\n\n“Well, that’s what we thought,” Good says.\n\n“So we’re like, ‘OK, we don’t want to overwhelm people, so Monday, you give the notes to the actors, you give the notes to the crew, I fall back, and then Tuesday — ,’” Bass stops here to laugh. “By the end of Tuesday we’re like, ‘Yeah, that doesn’t really work.’\n\n“We learned that actors, they needed both of us,” she says.\n\n“What we realized immediately was that was not gonna happen,” Good says of the plan to divide the job so formally. “Because we both were so into it that we were both drawn to whatever was going on.\n\n“Whether we were in the scene or not, we both had ideas, thoughts, things that we wanted to add,” she says.\n\nGood says the experience taught her that after three decades in front of the camera she can afford to be as selective as she wants about the acting jobs she takes, and that will allow her to pursue more directing work.\n\n“I’m realizing that really, a lot of my joy is coming in directing,” she says. “I like no hair, no makeup, baseball cap, sweat pants, and showing up to be creative, serving the actors and serving the project.”\n\nBass, meanwhile, shot her second feature as director over the summer of 2020, a movie for TV One titled “Don’t Waste Your Pretty,” that should come out early in 2021.\n\n“It was the first time that I was hired by someone else to direct something that wasn’t my words,” she says of the project. “And it was amazing. So I’m like, ‘OK, what’s next? What can I do next?’”"
