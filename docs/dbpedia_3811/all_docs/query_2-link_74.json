        "text": "You grew up in New York and now reside in Los Angeles. What is your favorite thing about your hometown? Is there a way you could tell us that you’re from New York without literally telling us that?\n\nThe best part of my hometown is my family that is still there. These are the people that have known me since I was born and helped shape the woman I have become. To answer the second part of the question, I’m loud and unapologetically real.\n\nCan you tell us about If Not Now, When? What was it like to be involved in every aspect of production as a writer, actor, co-director, and co-producer on the project? What was the most challenging part about juggling all those roles?\n\n“If Not Now, When?” is a story of love, forgiveness, second chances, and sisterhood. It’s about four friends who met in high school and are reunited when one of them suffers a crisis. Being involved with all aspects of production allowed me to make sure that what ended up on the screen was the story that I wrote and the one that Meagan and I wanted to tell. We were solely responsible for making sure the final product reflected us. Since we were in control, we had a set that ran smoothly and efficiently.\n\nWhat is your collaborative relationship like with Meagan Good, who had the same duties as you? (The only correction is that Meagan did not write the film.) What was it like working together so closely from start to finish?\n\nWe have known each other since we were 16 and 19 years old. Collaborating in this capacity was an extension of our sisterhood and our shared desire to shift the narrative in Hollywood about Black women. We had previously worked together on a web series, so when I presented this project to Meagan as something we could do together, she jumped at it. It was an amazing collaboration from start to finish. We learned a lot about ourselves and each other.\n\nHow do you feel like your work as a director informs your work as an actor and vice versa? Is there something you learned from the experience of doing both that you might not have picked up on otherwise? What is it?\n\nAs an actor/director I understand performances and feelings. I believe that being an actor has made me a better director. The training I received allows me to fill in holes for my actors that another director may not. Also, being an actor helps when I have to communicate with my actors because I speak their language. It makes me sensitive to their needs. As for the other way around, being a director makes me cognizant of what I am doing with my body and aware of what the camera might need at any given moment. As actors we are “in the moment,” so we may not always remember where we placed our hands or when we picked up a glass in a scene. But knowing that the director and editor will have to cut the scene together later, I remember to check in with the script supervisor to make sure all my actions match.\n\nGiven how isolated everything is right now with social distancing, what advice would you give to young, emerging talent who wants to establish themselves in the film industry in 2021?\n\nI would always encourage people to figure out ways to stay creative. Write, shoot something with someone inside your bubble, even figure out Zoom sessions where you can perform monologues and scenes with a small community. Don’t let social distance stifle your creativity.\n\nOutside of your work, who or what is inspiring you most right now? Why?\n\nIn the creative world, I am most inspired by Regina King. I mean, isn’t everyone. She is doing it all and doing it all well. In my everyday life, I’m inspired by all the Black women on the forefront of making change happen for us and the next generation. There are way too many to name, but I want to take a moment to say, “I see you and thank you.”\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to this year? Do you have any resolutions for change in 2021? What are they?\n\nI am most looking forward to continuing to walk on the path that God designed and laid out specifically for me. I am looking forward to continuing to grow. I wasn’t always confident about my growth in space and truth. But I am getting there. I also created a television show that will start myself and Deborah Joy Winans, so I hope that gets set up this year."
