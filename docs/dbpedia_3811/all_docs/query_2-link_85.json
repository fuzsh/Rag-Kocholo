        "text": "Eleven years after the Sundance premiere of The Savages, director Tamara Jenkins opens up to The Hollywood Reporter on why it took over a decade to release her third feature, Private Life.\n\nThe film, which Jenkins dubbed “a movie about a middle-aged marriage,” delivers with a heavy-hitter cast featuring Kathryn Hahn, Paul Giamatti, Molly Shannon and Kayli Carter.\n\nBut fans of Jenkins’ previous Sundance film The Savages have one question for the director: What took so long?\n\n“I had a kid, and after I made The Savages, I thought I would, on top of doing my own writing, I would get a good book sent my way, and that never happened, which is very interesting from a female director point of view,” Jenkins said.\n\nBut she’s not the only female director who’s taken her time to release an anticipated feature film — she references powerful women like Wonder Woman‘s Patty Jenkins, who hadn’t made a movie in [over] 10 years before she released her blockbuster superhero movie.\n\n“I feel like the movie was so strongly ‘woman’ that I was like, ‘Take as long as you want, honey,'” Shannon said about Private Life. “The product is so beautiful that I’m just in the moment to celebrate that as a woman. Why rush? To me I feel like enjoying being an artist and being creative is most important.”\n\n“This is a story I really don’t think could have been told by anyone but a woman,” Carter said. “It’s so radically feminine the whole time.”"
