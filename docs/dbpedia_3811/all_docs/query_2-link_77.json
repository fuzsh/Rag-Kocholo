Watching TV shows like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and My Wife and Kids made a big impression. Supported by her mum, aunt and teachers Tamara was encouraged to apply to drama school, as she was deeply impressed by the lineage of storytelling and knew that she wanted to be a part of that.\n\nFrom getting to fly to Johannesburg for her first ever role in BBC1’s Undercover, to spitballing with director Anthony Nielsen in rehearsals for Unreachable at the Royal Court Theatre, to wowing audiences with her portrayal of Miss July in Andrea Levy’s The Long Song for the BBC, Tamara has delighted in the opportunities that being an actor has afforded her. The Long Song particularly made her really appreciate having diversity in front of and behind the camera and she came away with lifelong friends, including Jack Lowden, who Tamara again stars opposite in psychological horror, Kindred, which is out now."
