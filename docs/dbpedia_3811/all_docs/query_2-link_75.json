        "text": "By Lauren Zima\n\nThe Variety Screening Series’ presentation of “Tamara Drewe” drew big laughs from the crowd when it came to Q-and-A time with director Stephen Frears and the cast.\n\nThe film, about love and lust in the English countryside, stars Gemma Arterton, Dominic Cooper and Luke Evans, and clearly director Frears made an impact on the cast: When asked about working with him, Arterton said, to Frears’ mock dismay, “There’s no fuss. He’s very simplistic.” After raucous laughter, she quickly replied, “I don’t mean to say you’re simple, Steven.” Cooper retorted, “I often found him whispering incomprehensible garbage into my ears.”\n\nAs for Tamara Drewe’s character, star Gemma Arterton said “I still haven’t worked her out. When I first read the script I didn’t like her at all, but that was interesting. I wanted to work out why people do those things. That’s why people follow her; they feel sorry for her.”\n\nDrewe is hardly alone in her “Tamara” trysts, as multiple characters engage in affairs and flings. When Variety’s Dana Harris commented that she was surprised to see such immorality in the English country, Frears replied, “Have you ever met anyone from England?”"
