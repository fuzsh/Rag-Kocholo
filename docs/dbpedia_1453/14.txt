Origin of the Irish Surname Dempsey

Jack Dempsey

He was of Irish descent and his parents, Hyrum Dempsey and Mary Celia (ne Smoot), both had Irish ancestry. He was nicknamed "The Manassa Mauler" due to his aggressive fighting style and his birthplace. Dempsey was a dominant force in the heavyweight division, holding the World Heavyweight Championship title from 1919 to 1926.

Dempsey's boxing career began when he was a teenager, as he traveled through the western United States and fought in bars and small venues. He gained national attention in 1918 when he defeated prominent boxer Fred Fulton. On July 4, 1919, Dempsey faced Jess Willard for the heavyweight title and won in a shocking upset, knocking Willard down seven times in the first round and ultimately winning by a technical knockout in the third round.

Dempsey was known for his exceptional punching power and ability to deliver knockouts, making him a feared and respected opponent in the ring. Some of his most famous bouts include his 1921 victory over Georges Carpentier, which was the first million-dollar gate in boxing history, and his 1923 fight against Luis Firpo, which was later dubbed the "Fight of the Century."

In 1926, Dempsey lost his title to Gene Tunney in a closely contested match. In their highly publicised rematch the following year, Dempsey lost again in the controversial "Long Count" fight, which was marked by a delayed count after Dempsey had knocked down Tunney. Despite the losses, Dempsey remained an iconic figure in the world of boxing. He retired from boxing in 1928 and went on to have a successful career as a boxing promoter, referee, and restaurateur. Jack Dempsey passed away on May 31, 1983, in New York City.
