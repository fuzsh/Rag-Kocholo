        "text": "NEW CONCORD - Marcus Dempsey understood the moment awaiting him on Wednesday started years ago.\n\nThe Muskingum junior entered the game with Capital five points away from breaking the school's all-time scoring mark, and his fade-away jumper midway through the first half set the new standard.\n\nDempsey surpassed the record of 1,871 set by Andy Moore from 1988 to 1992, as he finished with 31 points in a 76-61 loss.\n\nA timeout was called to recognize Dempsey's achievement, and he was grateful to achieve the record at home and follow in his father Mark's footsteps.\n\nMark is seventh on the school's list with 1,453 points. He played under legendary coach Jim Burson from 1981-85.\n\n\"My dad was a big influence and did so much for me. There are so many others who have been a big part of this journey, too,\" Dempsey said. \"I was able to reflect on what everyone has meant in reaching this milestone. Being able to break the record at home with my family, former coaches and friends here was special.\"\n\nReaching this point took work and dedication, which Muskingum fifth-year coach Travis Schwab has witnessed on a daily basis.\n\n\"It's all about the work he puts in, especially when no one is looking,\" Schwab said. \"He works harder at his craft than anyone I've been around and is why he has become a good scorer. He enjoys being in the gym, and this type of success doesn't come by accident. His hard work has made him a great player.\"\n\nDempsey has set the example for others, noted junior teammate Mitch Clark. He appreciated seeing his teammate rewarded for his efforts.\n\n\"I'm super proud to see him accomplish this,\" Clark said. \"The time I've been here, he's always in the gym and working hard. It's something truly special to be able to see it happen, and it shows hard work will pay off.\"\n\nDempsey is second in the country, averaging 30.2 points per game. He is also on the 2020 Bevo Francis Award Watch List by Small College Basketball (SBC). The list consists of some of the top players from NCAA Division II and III, NAIA Division I and II, USCAA, and NCCAA.\n\nThe Clarence \"Bevo\" Francis Award is presented annually to the player who has had the finest overall season within Small College Basketball. Considerations will be season statistics and individual achievements, awards, personal character, and team achievements. The prestigious award is only given to one player within Small College Basketball per season.\n\nAs a sophomore, Dempsey posted the single-game record, scoring 57 points in a 111-104 lost to Oberlin. His effort broke a record from the 1912-13 season when Babe Arnold had 54 points and came shortly after teammate Jarrell Marsh had passed away in a car crash.\n\nHe was recognized twice as the U.S. Basketball Writers Association Division III Men's National Player of the Week during that season, was named a CoSIDA Third Team Academic All-American and made first team All-OAC.\n\nDempsey also received the OAC's Freshman of the Year honor. He was only the second Muskie to earn the honor with Marsh collecting that accolade for the 2015-16 season.\n\nDempsey is also Tri-Valley's all-time leading scorer.\n\nbhannahs@gannett.com\n\n740-450-6763\n\nTwitter @brandonhannahs"
