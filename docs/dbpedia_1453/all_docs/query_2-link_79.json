        "text": "Exactly one month away from their 2024 season opener against North Dakota State, the Colorado Buffaloes held their first practice of fall camp Monday morning.\n\nAfter practice, long snapper Camden Dempsey (also known as “The Governor”), linebacker Trevor Woods and running backs coach Gary “Flea” Harrell spoke to the media. All three appeared pleased with the opening practice and shared their thoughts on the competition taking place at their respective positions.\n\nMonday also marked the first true team practice for several transfers who committed to the Buffs post-spring, including linebacker Johnny Chaney Jr. (Florida A&M Rattlers), safety Savion Riley (Miami Hurricanes) and running back Isaiah Augustave (Arkansas Razorbacks), among others.\n\nBelow are five takeaways from Colorado’s first practice of fall camp:\n\nPractice was exceptionally physical\n\n“People were chomping at the bit,” Camden Dempsey said. “We’re only in spiders today; these aren’t even real pads. It looked like a practice three, four weeks into the season.”\n\nEveryone is on the same page regarding expectations\n\n“Last year was all about trying to come together and build unity,” Camden Dempsey said. “You had two sides of the locker room with different coaching mentalities. It took a while to get into that. This year, everyone knows that we’re there for a purpose. We’ve got 12 games and everyone knows that we need to be laser-focused on that Big 12 championship and then onto the national championship.”\n\nPlenty of competition at running back\n\n“They all will get a chance to go with the No. 1s,” coach Flea said. “Charlie, (Offerdahl) he earned it, he deserves it. He’ll be the guy leading the reps. But as we go through practice, Micah (Welch) will get a chance to go with (quarterback) Shedeur (Sanders) and the two transfers, Isaiah (Augustave) and Dallan (Hayden), they’ll get a chance to go with Shedeur as well. Once we go through a week or maybe a week-and-a-half, we’ll find that chemistry. I’m gonna give them opportunity. They have to make sure Shedeur feels comfortable with them in the game.”\n\nTrevor Woods is settling in at linebacker\n\n“I feel a lot more comfortable in it,” Trevor Woods said of his move from safety to linebacker. “We’re gonna get the pads on soon, but I feel a lot more comfortable playing against the linemen and stuff like that. It’s a lot better at this point.”\n\nWoods added that he recorded two interceptions during Monday’s practice.\n\nNew defensive coordinator Robert Livingston is keeping things simple\n\n“A lot of it is just the simplicity,” Trevor Woods said. “He’s (Livingston) hard-coding the coverage. If they line up like this, it’s gonna play like this. It’s a lot of just simplicity and not as many calls and stuff like that.”"
