        "meta_description": "Stephan David Uselman passed away surrounded by his children, his siblings and the love of God on July 25, 2024. Stephan was born on December 18, 1960, to Peter and Louise Uselman in Madison, Wisconsin.  Stephan grew up doing all the things young boys did on the east side of Madison in the 70s. With friends, cousins and siblings, he loved to hang out on Lake Monona, to go sledding and play hockey at Olbrich Park, to cruise around on his “three speed” and play football in the park. It was always an adventure when you were with Stephan. He was known as the “funny one” and he always found a way to have a good time.  But Stephan was much more than that. He was creative – he enjoyed wood carving and cabinet making; he was smart – he worked for many years as a structural design draftsman, and he had an intuitive knowledge of how to repair appliances, cars and much more. Above all Stephan loved his children and his family. He was always grateful for the love and kindness shown to him. As a father, Stephan enjoyed gardening, working on his boats and camping with his children.  Stephan was preceded in death by his parents, Peter and Louise Uselman. We take great comfort in the knowledge that Stephan is with Jesus, all the saints and all the family members that have gone before him.  Stephan is survived by his three children Gary, Georgia and Jack, his siblings Peggy Seiler, Matt Uselman (Barb), Grace Courchane (Mark) and John Uselman (Elizabeth Crummy) as well as numerous nieces and nephews.  A Funeral Mass will be held at 11:00 a. m. on Friday, August 9, 2024, at St. Dennis Church, 505 Dempsey Road. Visitation will be held from 10:00 a. m. until the time of service at the church.
