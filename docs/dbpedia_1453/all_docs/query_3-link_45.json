VA\n\nLawrence Co Ky 3rd Feb. 1857\n\nDear Sisters and brother:\n\nI received a letter from Frances on the last day of January last past which gave me great pleasure to hear from you and learn that you were all well.

I want all of you to come and see us if you can. I would be very glad if Frances or Nancy one or both would come and live with us. Be sure to come and see us shortly without fail. Mother lives with us. and is getting old and feeble and would like to see you all which she never can do without you coming here. I should like very well to come to Montgomery and see you all but cannot conveniently leave my children that long or take them with me so I shall look for you for sure to visit me before long. We live in Laurence County, Kentucky , near Warfield on Sandy River. We have had a uncommon cold bad winter here though today the weather has been fine and warm. Aunt Polly Spaulding has been dead two years last August. Spaulding has since married to Lucinda Kirk.\n\nStill write to us direct your letters to Warfield, Laurence County KY so no more at present but hope that through the blessings of God we may shortly meet and see each other in this world if not I want us to be sure to meet in Heaven where parting will be no more.\n\nYour affectionate sister,\n\nLucinda Anne Dempsey\n\nTo Frances Alley)\n\nNancy Alley)\n\nAnderson Alley)\n\nA Ribband for Frances\n\nA Ribband for Nancy\n\n(A Ribbon)\n\nLawrence Co.

She had written about her mother, Lucinda Alley Dempsey. My grandmother, wife of Mark Dempsey.\n\nThe poem is soo beautiful, I thought I would send it to you as a memorial for Mother's Day to be published - as it expresses also memories of my own mother Laura Ellen Dempsey Speer, wife of Dr. A. D. Speer.\n\nMy mother was also like Grandma Dempsey, but to me she was also my pal, and best friend. She always encouraged me and prayed with me concerning my problems which were many, about my job and my children and family.\n\nI thank the good Lord for giving me a good christian mother and father.\n\nIrene Fair, Letlaire, LA\n\nIt is a picture of my mother,\n\nIn the long, long, ago.\n\nHer face was thin and wrinkled,\n\nAnd her hair as white as snow.\n\nBut on her face was a smile,\n\nTo always welcome.\n\nI can see her by the fireside,\n\nWith her bible on her knee.\n\nI can hear her sweet Lullaby,\n\nHer voice was low and sweet,\n\nAs she gently rocked the cradle,\n\nAs the baby goes to sleep.\n\nAnd Father coming home at eve,\n\nShe was standing by the door.\n\nWith a welcome smile to greet him,\n\nWhen his hard days work was oer.\n\nThe stranger at the door,\n\nWas never turned away,\n\nShe always warmed and fed him,\n\nAnd then she used to say,\n\n\"I always try to feed them Him,\n\nThough he takes me by surprise.\n\nFor you know the Bible tells us,\n\nStrangers may be Angles by disguise.\n\nOh, I would give the world tonight,\n\nIf it were only mine,\n\nJust call back my mother,\n\nAs she was in olden time.\n\nTo hear her voice in accents sweet,\n\nWhile kneeling at her knee.\n\nRepeating o'er the little prayer,\n\nThat she taught to me.\n\nBut my mother is in Heaven,\n\nI shall meet her by and by.\n\nWhen the Lord comes back to earth again,\n\nI shall meet her in the sky.\n\n(Great grandmother of Virginia Lee Barton Urban)\n\nMark Dempsey bought the Isaac Chapman farm next to where William Alley, son of Samuel Alley, was living. William is recorded there in 1850 and is probably living there in 1840 with the McClure family.\n\nNeither Mark Dempsey nor Lucinda Alley could be found in the 1850 census.\n\nSee (http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=dempsey&id=I3682) for a detailed account of Mark and his family.\n\n\"I was told that Mark owned the farm before he married Lucinda, but I must check that because I do not want to tell you something that is not true...The reason I say that is the fact that Mark had travel throughout the Southwest, and had learned Spanish and a native Indian dialect...He had also brought a buffalo back to Martin County and it lived there on the farm long after everyone died...and cousins and family members lived there in the 30's and 40's and it was rented in the 50's and 60's, and we sold it to the state for the Dempsey Housing and Park in 1978 or 79... So I may not be totally correct...and when Mark first bought the farm , he rented to house...I don't know if you have ever been to the area there, but the house set on a piece of property that spreads out from a curve in the road and into an open field....There were no other family houses located there that we know of, except the two that he and Lucinda owned...and the second house did neighbor the main house..! but on the same property...So I do not know if Mr. Â«iÂ»(William)Â«/iÂ» Alley Â«iÂ»(This William is the son of our Samuel Alley, not Lucinda's father.)Â«/iÂ» rented the house, or if it was part of his wages, or if he and Lucinda were really close and he lived there to be close by, because I was told that she had an alcoholic son (John) but we never heard that from anyone in the family..and he was always in the community with his family...My Mother remembered seeing him...But that's another story...\" (Marcia Cooper, May 2007 email)\n\nThe following is the work of Dorsey Jude Jr. houseofjude@netzero.com\n\nMark Dempsey who bought the Dempsey Farm below Warfield in 1851, had an illegitimate son named Joseph Baisden Dempsey. It was believed that Mark became involved with an unidentified woman with the Baisden surname around 1834 and they produced a son named Joseph in 1835. It was said that Mark later adopted Joseph Baisden and at that point Joseph became known as Joseph Baisden Dempsey. Mark and his family all accepted that Joseph was Mark's son and Joseph is buried next to Mark on the Mark Dempsey farm cemetery and Joseph also received land from Mark. The source for this info is an excerpt from the family Bible of Mark Dempsey which included a genealogical article that was started by Mark and later finished by Mark's son Lewis.\n\nIn this article Mark wrote about his family and did not include the info about Joseph; however, Mark's son Lewis later included the information about Joseph when he finished the article. According to the article, it is believed that Joseph's unidentified mother was the daughter of an unidentified Baisden family. The only possible parents in the vicinity of this unidentified Baisden woman could only have been Joseph & Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden. After researching the family of Joseph & Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden, I have concluded that Joseph's mother was not a daughter of this Baisden family since all of the daughters of this family have been otherwise accounted for by marrying and having their own families.\n\nRuth Starr, who was a neighbor of the family of Joseph and Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden, may have been Joseph Baisden Dempsey's mother because Ruth Starr was known as having several illegitimate children and gave some to their fathers or others to raise. Since Ruth Starr is listed on the 1850 Logan Co., VA census as a close neighbor to Joseph & Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden, suggesting a close connection, it was plausible that Joseph & Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden may have been one of the families who accepted one of Ruth's illegitimate children to help raise and they may have accepted Joseph Baisden Dempsey. This would explain why there is a Joseph Baisden age 15 listed on the 1850 Logan Co., VA census in the household of Joseph & Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden. I believe this Joseph Baisden, age 15 is duplicated as Joseph Dempsey* later on the same census living with his uncle James Starr, who was the brother of Ruth Starr.\n\nIn order to honor his \"adoptive\" family, Joseph acquired the Baisden surname as his middle name and became known as Joseph Baisden Dempsey. This makes sense when you consider the time period before there were any social programs available to assist an unwed mother in raising her children. In fact it was quite common during this period to require an unwed mother to \"appear before courts to show cause why her baseborn children should not be bound out\" to others to raise.\n\nIn fact, Ruth Starr did have other children born out of wedlock who were later raised by their fathers or others including her first child who was Davidson Samson b. 1834, who was also identified on the 1850 Logan census as Davison Samson age 16 living in the household of #133 Green White.\n\nAnother child Ruth gave away to his father was James Madison \"Matthew/Matt\" Duncan (alias Starr) b. 1838 who was raised by his father Mark Duncan. This child was listed on 1850 Logan census as James M. Starr age 12 living in household of #528 with Mark P Duncan. This child was born when Mark Dempsey was still traveling out West between 1835 and 1838.\n\nRuth had another son John Dempsey (alias Starr) who was born about 1836. This child appears on the 1850 Logan Co., VA census as John Starr age 14, living with his mother Ruth Starr. When Ruth's brother James Starr executed a deed, it stated James Starr had no children of his own. Therefore, this John Starr was not the son of James Starr. According to a written statement by Mark Dempsey's son Lewis Dempsey, his father Mark Dempsey boarded with James Starr in 1832 while teaching school and left home 1835 and went West to MO & NM and returned home in 1838. This explains how Mark Dempsey came to have a relationship with Ruth Starr. Mark Dempsey apparently met Ruth Starr while he was boarding with Ruth's brother James Starr. It appears that Ruth's child John Dempsey (alias Starr) was born about 1836 or about a year after Mark Dempsey left home to travel out west, according to the Dempsey family article written by Mark's son Lewis. It has already been established by the marriage record for John Dempsey (alias Starr) that Ruth Starr was his mother and his father was an unidentified Dempsey. Some people think John's middle name was Jude. It was not. This was simply a misidentification with another person, i.e., John Jude who was also living with James Starr, according to the 1850 Logan Co., VA census. This John Jude later married Anna Staten and is the ancestor of many of the present day Jude families in today's southwestern WV area. Ruth's son John is living with her on the 1850 Logan census as John Starr, but his marriage record shows his name as John Dempsey, which supports the conclusion JOHN DEMPSEY (ALIAS STARR) WAS ALSO A SON OF MARK DEMPSEY.\n\nAnother explanation how Mark Dempsey met Ruth Starr was through Ruth Starr's sister Martha Starr. Martha married Mark Dempsey's brother Andrew Dempsey. This especially makes sense because Mark at one time was boarding with James Starr who was the brother to both Martha Starr and Ruth Starr. Consequently, Mark Dempsey was the brother-in-law of Martha Starr and yet is another reason why Mark was boarding with James. He came to know James Starr because James' other sister Martha Starr married his brother Andrew. In conclusion, Mark Dempsey was boarding with James Starr because James Starr was the brother of Martha Starr, who was married to Mark Dempsey's brother Andrew Dempsey. While he was boarding with James Starr, he met James' sister Ruth Starr, who was also the sister of Martha (Starr) Dempsey.\n\nThe following entries for the 1850 Logan Co., VA census should provide some more clarity:\n\n83 Ruth Starr 33 F - - VA\n\nJohn Starr 14 M VA\n\nHenry Starr 9 M VA\n\nPolly Starr 8 F VA\n\nShelton Starr 4 M VA\n\n522 James Starr 52 M Farmer $3,300 VA\n\nRebecca Starr 34 F VA\n\nJohn Jude 17 M VA\n\nJoseph* Dempsey 10 M VA 14 Sep 1850\n\nI also believe it's possible this same RUTH STARR MAY HAVE HAD OTHER CHILDREN BY MARK DEMPSEY after he came back home about 1838, including my great-great grandmother Mary Anne (Dempsey) Coleman b. abt. 1847, who was identified as Polly Starr age 8 living in the house hold of her mother Ruth Starr, according to the 1850 Logan Co., VA census. Polly is a nickname for Mary. Also, according to Mark Dempsey's genealogical article, there is a 16 yr. period between the birth of Mark's first son Joseph Baisden Dempsey and his first child he had by his wife Lucinda (Alley) after they married in 1851. I think that during this 16 yr period Mark may have fathered other children, especially since during this period he lived at some point with James Starr. Also, according to the previously mentioned genealogical article written by Lewis Dempsey, it did NOT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE any other children for Mark Dempsey. It only included children by his wife Lucinda (Alley) and the unidentified Baisden woman, who as it turns out could be Ruth Starr.\n\nAlso, I have other info that suggests Mary Anne (Dempsey) Coleman b. 1847 may have been the daughter of Mark Dempsey. My uncle James Maynard is a descendant of Mark Dempsey's brother Lewis who lived at Kermit, WV. Anyway, Lewis had a daughter named Lucinda Ann. She was commonly known as Ann. Ann was the niece of Mark Dempsey. Ann lived to be almost 100 yrs old and personally told James Maynard who was her great-grandson that Mary Anne (Dempsey) Coleman was her first cousin. Anyone that has studied the Dempsey family knows that there were only 2 sons in the family of John & Rachel (Solomon) Dempsey who settled near the area of Buck Creek, KY including the vicinity of Warfield, KY & neighboring Kermit, WV. Those two brothers were Lewis and Mark. Since Lewis' daughter Lucinda Anne said that Mary Anne was her first cousin, which means one of Lewis' brothers had to be Mary Anne's father. The process of elimination in the immediate area only leaves Mark as the logical conclusion as the likely paternal candidate since there were no other Dempsey sons in the family of John & Rachel (Solomon) Dempsey in the immediate area.\n\nLater in life Ruth Starr married and had children by Evan Ellis and moved to Roane Co., WV abt 1855."
