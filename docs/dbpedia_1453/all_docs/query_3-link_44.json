        "text": "Background\n\nPatrick Dempsey was born in Lewiston, Maine, to M. Amanda (Casson) and insurance agent William Allen Dempsey. He is the youngest of three siblings who grew up in Buckfield, Maine. Dempsey was dyslexic and attended St. Dominic Regional High School before transferring to Willowridge High School in Houston. He used to compete in juggling contests when he was younger. At the age of 15, he landed the character of the wayward son in “On Golden Pond.” Two years later, he landed a leading part as a gay adolescent in “Torch Song Trilogy,” a play for which he toured for many months in San Francisco. More possibilities came his way when he won the lead part in Neil Simon’s “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” which toured in 1984.\n\nHowever, Dempsey’s movie career kicked off quickly, and he made his debut in the film “In the Mood.” Following that, Dempsey portrayed a geek in the amusing high school comedy “Can’t Buy Me Love.” Dempsey, a movie critic’s favorite, had achieved the height of his early professional success. He took a more serious turn with the World War II drama “In a Shallow Grave,” but then returned to familiar ground with the college-themed comedy. Dempsey branched out more in the 1990s, appearing in a slew of stage and big-screen projects.\n\nDempsey’s transition into the new millennium was aided by television in the late 1990s. In the T.V. series “Will & Grace,” he was portrayed as a smarter, more humorous, and sexier character. While the rom-com film “Sweet Home Alabama” brilliantly portrayed Dempsey’s direction, In Grey’s Anatomy, he played Dr. Derek Shepherd, lovingly known as “Dr. McDreamy,” a neurosurgeon, in 2005, where he delivered the whole love and romantic experience. This reawakening has also reopened the door to high-profile film opportunities, with his registering with women in a variety of light-hearted lead actor roles and as a bad guy in a drama series.\n\nDempsey has had two marriages. In 1987, he married Rochelle “Rocky” Parker, who was known as his manager, actress, and acting coach, when he was 21 and she was 48. In 1994, the couple divorced, and in 2014, she passed away. In July 1999, Dempsey married Jillian Fink. The couple has three children. Fink filed for divorce in January 2015, but the couple reconciled later that year and ended their divorce in November 2016."
