To make it feel a little easier, follow these top name-picking tips:\n\nThink about names that mean a lot to your family. You may want to consider naming your child after a much-loved relative or there might be a significant name which has been passed down your or your partner's family for generations.\n\nConsider options from other countries. If you or your partner have a strong link with another country, choosing a baby boy name from that part of the world is a great way of honouring that connection. You may also want to look at names from places you've loved to visit on holiday.\n\nLook at name meanings. Thinking about the meaning of the names you like can help you work out whether it is the one for you. Take a moment to consider the type of meaning you want your child's name to have. Do you want a strong, powerful, masculine name or something with a positive or heartwarming message? Perhaps you have an affinity for nature or you want a name which reflects your religious beliefs?\n\nTroubleshoot your choices. Once you've drawn up a shortlist of names you like, take them for a test-drive to see whether they will work in reality. How does the name sound with your surname? What will the initials be? Do other people find it easy to pronounce or will your child have a lifetime of correcting others? Do other people find it simple to spell and, if not, does it matter to you that you and your child will probably have to keep correcting other's mistakes? What nicknames might people call your child? How can it be shortened?\n\nCheck how popular the names you like are. It’s a good idea to check out where your favourite baby boy names come in the top 100 list before you commit to one. And if it's high up on the list, ask yourself if you mind the prospect of your child sharing a name with a couple of future classmates or whether you'd prefer your boy's name to be as different as possible.\n\n220.

If you live in Scotland, you will be expected to register your baby’s birth (and name) within 3 weeks of his birth.\n\nOnce you have picked a name, contact your local register office for an appointment to go in and register your baby’s birth.\n\nYou will need to take some identification with you to prove who you are and some registrars may ask to see your baby’s red book, which is their personal health record. When you register the birth, you will be asked your baby’s full name as well as details about when and where he was born.\n\nThe birth must be registered by the baby’s mother or father and if you are unmarried and go to the register office alone, you will have to take a declaration of parentage form signed by the other parent with you.\n\n520.

Because of the time needed to collect and process all the data, each new list is always based on names registered up to 2 years ago. So, the the most recent list is based on names registered in 2022. Scotland's National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland's Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency also each release their own list every year, gathered in the same way.\n\nPics: Getty Images\n\nRead more:"
