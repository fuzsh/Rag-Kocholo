        "text": "WARWICK âˆ’ Police have identified the young boy who was found dead at a shooting scene Thursday morning as 4-year-old Liam Dempsey.\n\nThe preschooler was found in a home on Frawley Street where police say they also found his 33-year-old father, Seamus Dempsey, who they said had apparently shot and killed himself.\n\nBoth Liam and his father had apparent gunshot wounds, says a news release from Warwick's police chief, Col. Brad Connor.\n\nThe boy's 33-year-old mother, Estefania Dempsey, told police that her husband had shot their son with a handgun, police say.\n\nAt the time, her 79-year-old mother-in-law, Ellen Dempsey, was in the house, police say. She was not injured.\n\nAs expected, the announcement Friday morning brought some additional context to a tragedy that police had already described as a \"senseless and unimaginable act.\"\n\nAn investigation continues and the update did not provide information about Seamus Dempsey's background, his mental state or conditions in the house before Thursday.\n\n\"Detectives continue to gather evidence and piece together the events leading up to this horrific crime,\" says the release.\n\nPast allegations of domestic violence\n\nIn 2021, Seamus Dempsey was charged with domestic simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct, according to a police log record posted online by Warwick police.\n\nOnline court records do not provide information on the outcome of that case.\n\nThen, last year, Seamus Dempsey filed a divorce complaint against Estefania Dempsey in Family Court.\n\nJudge Andrea Iannazzi ordered mediation and Estefania Dempsey filed a counterclaim.\n\nJust last month, the complaint against her was dismissed and the court entered a consent order.\n\nLast September, in a different Family Court matter in which Estefania Dempsey had been the plaintiff, a magistrate had entered a judgment.\n\nThis was after Estefania Dempsey had targeted Seamus Dempsey in a child-support proceeding.\n\nCourt records also indicate Dempsey had dealt with legal action by financial firms in recent years.\n\nThe death scene discovered Thursday morning was in a saltbox-style home on Frawley Street, in a central neighborhood in Warwick.\n\nThe home itself has been in the Dempsey family since 2002; the ownership moved into a trust named for Ellen Dempsey in 2017.\n\nThat same year, Seamus Dempsey and Ellen Dempsey sold a similar home just down the street, at 32 Frawley St., for $180,000."
