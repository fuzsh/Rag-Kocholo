        "text": "Actor and theater researcher (1936-1994). Known as Mark Dempsey in his adult life, he was born Herbert Lee Dempsey in Los Angeles, California; he was the son of Lee and Bessie Hall Dempsey who divorced in 1939. In 1951, Dempsey moved to Seattle with his mother and attended Queen Anne High School. He performed in regional theatre in New York, Pennsylvania and California (1954-1956) and then returned to Seattle to attend the University of Washington's School of Drama (1956-1959). Dempsey resided in New York City from the early 1960s until his return to Seattle in 1982 where he lived continuously until his death. His mother, his aunt Rosalie Sipp (aka Irma Beatrice Hall), and grandmother Jessie Hall, all had ties to the Seattle vaudeville theater during the period 1922-1932."
