        "text": "ARTICLE 19 competition expert & consultant Simonetta Vezzoso and Jürgen Bering of Berlin’s Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte e.V. have co-authored a piece for Tech Policy Press! Thanks as always to Justin Hendrix and Benjamin Lennett. The piece discusses a judgement by Düsseldorf’s Regional Court with “..potentially significant implications that represent a substantial victory for protecting our fundamental rights on the internet”. In brief, the analysis is broken into three sub-headings: 1. Meta’s Overzealous Moderation Leads to a Beneficial Legal Decision - A strategic choice was made to challenge Meta not only on breach of contract but that it had also abused its dominant position in its handlings of the plaintiffs, non-profit organisation, Filmwerkstatt Düsseldorf who were supported by non-profit, Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte e.V. and law firm Hausfeld. 2. Standing on the Shoulders of the Bundeskartellamt - The ensuing judgement built upon a precedent established the German competition authority, the Bundeskartellamt when it took on what was still #Facebook in 2019 and in reaching its judgement then, established Meta's dominant position through a detailed legal and economic framing of the relevant market. The Düsseldorf Court leant heavily on the assessment in the findings from the #Bundeskartellamt. 3. Protecting Fundamental Rights - #Antitrust as Part of the #Solution - Using competition law (an abuse of dominant position), allowed for the case to be brought before court in Düsseldorf and not Ireland as a ‘normal’ contract dispute would have likely meant. With regards to the legal framing, the analysis rightly states that... “The mere fact that these legal instruments were expressly referred to can be seen as evidence that the court views the enforcement of competition law as part of a large, coherent framework addressing the (market) power held by #BigTech. Likewise, the court referenced #fundamentalrights. While not every violation of fundamental rights might be addressed through competition law, the court’s decision may reflect a more #progressive understanding of #competitionlaw, away from a narrow focus on #efficientmarkets and towards encompassing other values such as #fundamentalrights or #sustainability.” In concluding, the authors state that…” the Court’s decision might not just be a happy accident of jurisdictional strategy but a building block…. towards a more effective and fundamental rights-friendly #understanding and #enforcement of competition law in the EU.” #competition #marketpower #fundamentalrights #EU #BigTech Read the full op-ed"
