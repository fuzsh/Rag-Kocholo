        "text": "Posted 3.3.2022 in History\n\nDempsey Auction Company is a third-generation auction company based in Rome, Georgia. The story of the family business began in the 1940s, when Sproull Dempsey Sr. elected to sell the family dairy farm at auction. When auction day came, he was not satisfied with where the bidding was headed, so he took matters into his own hands. He simply jumped into the crowd and started getting bids! After the sale, the auctioneer offered him a job, and the rest is history – the Dempseys have been involved in the auction industry ever since!\n\nIn 1965, Sproull formed Sproull Dempsey and Sons Auction Company with his sons, Sproull Jr. and Ray. Ray started his auction career as a teenager traveling with his father every summer putting up the tent, erecting auction signs, giving out brochures, and working on the sales. Now, he runs the company as CEO.\n\nRay’s son, Lou, is the current President of DAC, overseeing day-to-day operations and coordinating all sales and marketing efforts. Lou continues to believe in his grandfather’s vision, taking to heart Sproull Dempsey Sr.’s motto that “Nothing Succeeds like Success.”\n\nOver the course of our years in business, our company has gone on to conduct thousands of auctions and closings throughout the continental US, and has brought on valued team members, enabling our company to grow and become what Dempsey Auction Company is today.\n\nDempsey Auction Company Today\n\nToday, we assist our clients in selling their property quickly, efficiently, and, most importantly, for the highest price possible! We help them through the auction process even after their property has sold. We work hard to establish ourselves as a partner – not just a group of salesmen – by understanding our clients’ goals and creating individual marketing strategies that align with these goals.\n\nOn the buyer’s side, we understand that buying at an auction, especially for the first time, can be intimidating. It should be a simple, easy, and fun way to buy property, and we make sure that it feels that way – after all, our family is yours!\n\nThroughout our time in the auction industry, we’ve also always strived to support the communities where we are privileged to conduct business. We are honored to frequently partner with local nonprofits to assist them with any of their auction needs.\n\nFor over 57 years, and through three generations, Dempsey has taken great pride in bringing quality auction experiences to both our buyers and sellers; we look forward to serving our customers and our community, as we move into the future. Because just as Sproull Dempsey Sr. always said, “Nothing Succeeds like Success!”"
