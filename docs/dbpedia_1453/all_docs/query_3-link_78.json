        "text": "LONDON — American soccer’s biggest name has arrived in England, hoping to live up to the reputation he made for himself on his first visit. Landon Donovan is fresh from Los Angeles, so it was understandable when he noted that sequels sometimes do not live up to the original.\n\nNot that he will not try to do even better this time around. But as Donovan begins his second stint with Everton, he will inevitably be measured against another American — Clint Dempsey — who has already proved himself in England’s Premier League.\n\nDempsey, a 28-year-old Texan, has been playing in England for Fulham since the start of 2007. Last month, he broke the record for goals by an American in the Premier League, when he scored his 37th in a 1-0 win against Liverpool.\n\nDempsey overtook Brian McBride, a former Fulham teammate who made 151 appearances for the club from 2004 to 2008 and became enough of a legend that the club named a bar in the stadium after him.\n\nSince his record-breaking goal, Dempsey has scored twice more, including the tying goal against powerhouse Chelsea in a 1-1 tie on Dec. 26.\n\nIn the midst of this success, here comes Donovan, who had a strong three-month run with Everton in 2010 that has now prompted his return. But whereas the 29-year-old Donovan has spent much of his career in the United States, starring for first the San Jose Earthquakes and then the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer, Dempsey has essentially been all-England, joining Fulham after playing only three seasons for the New England Revolution. And he gives no indication of wanting to go home despite the demands of playing in the Premier League, especially for a smaller club like Fulham.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
