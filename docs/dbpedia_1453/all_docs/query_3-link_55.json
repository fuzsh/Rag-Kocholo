        "text": "Birth of the Manassa Mauler\n\nOn Jun 24, 1895, the world welcomed William Harrison Dempsey. He was born in Manassa, Colorado to parents Hyrum and Celia who hailed from West Virginia. Hyrum was as a schoolteacher before he and Celia joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in the 1880s and they moved west. Dempsey’s two older brothers were miners, and during his childhood the family moved regularly in search of work throughout Colorado and Utah.\n\nMoney was tight and the family knew scarcity. Dempsey began working when he was just eight years old, helping to support his family as a farm hand, miner, and cowboy. He got his first taste of fighting when his older brother, Bernie, started earning extra cash as a prizefighter. Bernie taught young William how to fight, reportedly advising him that chewing pine tar gum would strengthen his jaw and soaking his face in brine would toughen his skin.\n\nDempsey dropped out of school after eighth grade to work as a laborer, picking crops and shining shoes. By the time he was 17, he was a good enough boxer that he decided to focus on fighting for an income. Constantly moving around in search of opportunity, William freight-hopped and slept in hobo camps, occasionally visiting saloons seeking challengers. He reportedly would enter and say \"I can't sing and I can't dance, but I can lick any SOB in the house.\"\n\nKid Blackie, Meet Jack Dempsey\n\nAs a prizefighter, Dempsey fought under the pseudonym, \"Kid Blackie” until 1914, when he first competed as \"Jack Dempsey” in Cripple Creek, Colorado. Jack inherited the new name from Bernie who had signed to fight veteran George Copelin. When Bernie discovered Copelin had sparred with then-current world heavyweight champion Jack Johnson, he backed out of the fight, recognizing he didn’t have what it took to compete. Instead, he substituted his brother William who shocked the crowd when he downed Copelin six times in the first round and twice in the second.\n\nNow officially boxing under the name Jack Dempsey, his young career was blossoming. He won his next six bouts in a row by knockout, campaigning throughout Utah, and continuing to fight in Wasatch Mountain towns. Over the next few years, he fought several more times to mixed results but racked up 10 more wins until the United States entered World War I in 1917.\n\nThe Champ\n\nDuring the war, Dempsey simultaneously worked in a shipyard and boxed on the side. He hit his stride in 1918 when he fought in 17 matches, going 15–1 with one no-decision. Among these fights was a match against Light Heavyweight Champion Battling Levinsky, Bill Brennan, Fred Fulton, Carl E. Morris, Billy Miske, heavyweight Lefty Jim McGettigan, and Homer Smith. The following year, he won five consecutive regular bouts by knockout in the first round.\n\nThis impressive run earned Dempsey a shot at the heavyweight title in 1919. On July 4, he went toe-to-toe with the world heavyweight champion Jess Willard in Toledo, and the young fighter overwhelmed the 37-year-old champion. \"The Great White Hope\" was a full six inches taller than Dempsey and outweighed him by nearly 60 pounds, yet Dempsey relied on his superior quickness and ruthlessness. Young Dempsey wasted no time going after the champ, sending Willard to the floor seven times in the first round and knocking Willard out in the third round. On Independence Day, Dempsey became the world heavyweight champion.\n\nAfter the fight, accounts circulated of Willard suffering brutal injuries, including a broken jaw and ribs. Rumors that have since been refuted spread that Dempsey had cheated, with some questioning how his punches could cause such damage. The day after the title match, the New York Times quoted Willard as saying,\n\n\"Dempsey is a remarkable hitter. It was the first time that I had ever been knocked off my feet. I have sent many birds home in the same bruised condition that I am in, and now I know how they felt. I sincerely wish Dempsey all the luck possible and hope that he garnishes all the riches that comes with the championship.”\n\nDempsey’s win over Willard marked the beginning of his remarkable run as the world heavyweight champion. He successfully defended his title five times over the next six years, in what is considered one of the greatest reigns in the sport’s history. In 1921, his title defense match against French boxer Georges Carpentier generated the first million-dollar gate in boxing history. Over 90,000 people filled the stands to watch the fight.\n\nAs champion, Dempsey’s profile rose considerably. In addition to his title-defending fights, he fought in exhibitions, made movies, and pursued product endorsements. He became one of the richest athletes in the world and was featured on the cover of Time in 1923. Dempsey traveled and partied extensively, and married actress Estelle Taylor in 1925.\n\nDempsey eventually lost his title in an upset in September 1926, to former U.S. Marine Gene Tunney in Philadelphia. The following year Dempsey earned a rematch but was unable to bring down his opponent. After the rematch with Tunney, Dempsey retired from professional boxing, competing in over 100 exhibition bouts between 1930 and 1931.\n\nThe Heart of a Mason\n\nIn his retirement, Dempsey put his fame and fortune to use, and in the Masonic spirit became a philanthropist. He also continued acting, featuring in several films that included The Prizefighter and the Lady in 1933. In 1935, the former champ opened Jack Dempsey's Restaurant in New York City across the street from Madison Square Garden.\n\nLike many Masons before him and after, when his country needed him most, Dempsey answered the call. Following the First World War, Dempsey had caught heat from the press for not serving overseas. However, when the United States entered World War II, Dempsey put any criticism of his war record to rest.\n\nDempsey enlisted with the New York State Guard and was given a commission as a first lieutenant before resigning and joining up with the Coast Guard. He participated in publicity and morale-boosting events to support the war effort, appearing at fights, camps, hospitals, and war bond drives. In 1944, he was assigned to the transport USS Wakefield (AP-21) and the following year was on board the attack transport USS Arthur Middleton (APA-25) for the invasion of Okinawa. In September 1945, Dempsey was released from active duty and seven years later received an honorable discharge from the Coast Guard Reserve.\n\nPersonal Life, Death and Legacy\n\nDempsey married four times to Maxine Gates (1916-19), Estelle Taylor (1925-30), Hannah Williams (1933-43) and Deanna Piatelli (1958). He and Williams had two children, Joan and Barbara, and he adopted a daughter with Piatelli. In 1950, Dempsey wrote a book on boxing, Championship Fighting: Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense, that described his approach to the sport.\n\nThe ‘Manassa Mauler’ transformed the sport of boxing, and subsequent champions, including fellow Freemason Sugar Ray Robinson, who adopted his bobbing and weaving techniques. He remains one of the sport's all-time popular fighters thanks to his ferocious fighting style and exceptional punching power. As champion, he set financial and attendance records and helped lead the sport into the age of live broadcasting.\n\nHis many accolades include:\n\n· Ranking 10th on The Ring magazine's list of all-time heavyweights\n\n· Ranking 7th among The Ring magazine’s Top 100 Greatest Punchers\n\n· Being an inaugural 1990 inductee to the International Boxing Hall of Fame\n\n· Being a member of the \"charter class\" in the Utah Sports Hall of Fame\n\nAll told, Dempsey fought 84 bouts, winning 62 (51 by knockout). While he earned a reputation for being exceedingly aggressive in the ring, his charm and charitable demeanor outside the ring made him one of the sport’s most beloved figures. Brother Jack Dempsey passed to the celestial lodge when he died of heart failure on May 31, 1983, at the age of 87 in New York City. His body was buried at Southampton Cemetery in Southampton, New York."
