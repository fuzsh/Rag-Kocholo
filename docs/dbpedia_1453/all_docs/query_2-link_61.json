        "text": "By PETE DAVIS\n\nEGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP – A 7:30 a.m. shotgun start was a welcome change this week for the Ocean City Thursday Senior Golf League, although the early time led a few to sit out. This is not the time of year to miss a week.\n\nWe have four weeks left until the playoffs begin and with updated handicaps formulated for the stretch run, there is a lot of opportunity for players to reach the coveted top eight positions in each flight.\n\nA Flight had some very low net rounds recorded so let’s have a look at those matches.\n\nRon Gibson (26) shot a gross 86, net 60 in his match with Paul Sullivan (26). Ron was up in match play by 5 holes at the turn and he added 5 more on the back before ending up +7. Eight pars and a smooth 41 strokes on the front was too much for Paul, who shot a net 69. 4 points to Ron.\n\nJim Hoagland (23) drew John Blady (9) as his opponent. Jim matched John across the front nine as both posted 41. The handicap strokes, however, had him up in match play 4-2. Similar story on the back. Jim ended up with a great score of net 62 and he played wisely with his handicap strokes. Jim birdied the 15th while John birdied the second and seventh. (Only three strokes separated their gross scores). 4 points to Jim.\n\nJoe Dempsey (20) also recorded a net 62 in his match versus Frank Mancini (16). Joe got extremely hot as he turned on to the front and parred holes one through four. That staked him to a match play lead of 4 holes which he did not relinquish. Frank played Joe dead even on the back and dropped a birdie on him at the 17th but it wasn’t enough to get back in the match. 4 points to Joe.\n\nGlenn Giveans (17) and Guy Hackney (21) battled to a halve. In medal play Glenn had a gross 84 net 67 while Guy had a gross 89 net 68! Match play holes fell to Guy by one, 7-6. Glenn birdied the sixth while Guy rang up two: the fourth and the 11th. Very, very, tight contest. 2 points each to Glenn and Guy.\n\nBen Fong (23) and Russ Forrest (26) also were in a tight duel. Ben with a gross 90, net 67 while Russ posted a gross 89, net 63. Russ squeaked by in the match play 7 holes to 6, primarily due to lower scoring on the front side. Looks like a net par on the difficult 17th was a key win for Russ. 4 points to Russ.\n\nMike Bogdash (24) played solo and was later in a match of cards to determine his points. His round of 81 was spectacular as he shot a blistering 39 on the front side and 42 on the back. Highlights included birdies on the eighth and 11th holes and the fact that he only had one real blemish on the card, a single double bogey. Too bad he didn’t have an opponent face to face to experience that. 4 points to Mike.\n\nIn other A flight action, Phil Gaffney (20) was in control all the way in his match over Drew Klein (20). Jack Mahon (22) bested Ron Venturi (22) mainly due to a stronger showing on the front 9. Ron did birdie the 14th. Harry O’Neill shot a gross 94 and won his contest in a match of cards. Jay Ammon also won as his opponent could not finish. So, Phil, Jack, Harry and Jay all with 4 points.\n\nOver in B Flight, Tom Szkaradnik (36) and Tom Gahr (34) played a very close match. Tom S. edged out Tom G. in medal play with a net 62. Tom G. held the advantage in match play 6-5 so the contest halves with 2 points to each. Tom G. did win three holes on the back with pars as this was the deciding factor.\n\nTwo longtime buddies Garth Moyle (27) and Tony D’Ottavio (29) faced off with Tony D. coming out on top, primarily due to better scoring on the front nine. The back nine was dead even. Tony D. with a net 64 and 4 points.\n\nMike Collins (34) was the underdog versus Mike Janel (28) but a 47 on the back along with 6 match play hole wins carried him to victory. 4 points to Mike C. Joe Szkaradnik (35) battled Brian Lefke (34). While the front nine played pretty even, Joe held a small advantage which he expanded across the back, leading to a net 67 and victory. 4 points to Joe. Flight leader Rick Schultz shot a net 62 and claimed 4 points from Joe Sheridan. Mike Coffman and John Rutter each won 4 points in matches of cards. John had an exceptional day without a direct opponent, as he recorded a back nine 40 on the way to a net 56.\n\nOFFICIAL STANDINGS\n\nA FLIGHT POINTS\n\nPhil Gaffney 30\n\nGlenn Giveans 29\n\nMike Bogdash 28\n\nGuy Hackney 25\n\nPete McInerney 24\n\nJoe Dempsey 24\n\nFrank Mancini 23\n\nJay Ammon 22\n\nJack Mahon 22\n\nB FLIGHT\n\nRick Schultz 35\n\nMike Janel 24\n\nMike Coffman 24\n\nPaul Sullivan 24\n\nTom Gahr 21\n\nTony D’Ottavio 20\n\nMike Collins 20"
