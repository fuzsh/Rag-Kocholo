        "text": "Bessie Hall Dempsey was born in Arkansas on October 5, 1914 to Leroy Leister and Jessie Des Champ. When her parents divorced in 1918, her mother Jessie moved to Montana with Bessie and her older sister Irma Beatrice. Jessie Leister remarried briefly and changed her name to Hall. She operated a successful seamstress studio in Missoula and designed costumes for the vaudeville circuit. After her second marriage failed in 1922, Jessie Hall moved again with her daughters, this time to Seattle where the girls attended Broadway High School and were later enrolled at the Cornish School of Fine Arts. The family lived for several years at the Moore Hotel in downtown Seattle, which had an adjacent vaudeville theater at the time. Bessie and Irma Hall studied classical ballet, folk dance, music theory, composition and choreography. Bessie was an excellent student and also studied physics, mathematics and foreign languages. In the late 1920s Bessie and Irma began performing as the Hall Sisters in Northwest vaudeville theaters.\n\nDuring the Depression in 1932, the family moved to California seeking show business opportunities. After the collapse of vaudeville and a permanent separation from her sister, Bessie Hall pursued a solo career in San Francisco and Los Angeles performing in ballets, nightclubs and movies under the stage name Yvonne St. Clair. In 1935 she married Lee Dempsey, a former first baseman for the New York Giants. Their son Herbert Lee (Mark) Dempsey was born in 1936. They were divorced in 1939.\n\nBessie Hall Dempsey then entered the University of Southern California where she earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Aerodynamics. While attending the University, she supported her family by working full-time at the Bank of America. She graduated with honors and changed her name again, this time to B.M. Dempsey in an attempt to avoid the bias against women in engineering fields. She moved to Seattle in 1948 and was hired by Boeing Airplane Company as a Junior Engineer Class B, becoming the companyâ€™s first female engineer. She received several promotions at Boeing and in 1951 was the first woman elected to Tau Beta Pi, the honorary engineering society. Bessie Hall Dempsey worked at Boeing for nearly 24 years. During her Boeing career, she still enjoyed local amateur performing and lived on a Seattle houseboat with her son Mark. Bessie Hall Dempsey died in Seattle on September 16, 1971 after a long illness. She was 57 years old.\n\nAlternative Forms Available\n\nView selections from the collection in digital format by clicking on the camera icons in the inventory below.\n\nRestrictions on Use\n\nThe Museum of History & Industry is the owner of the materials in the Sophie Frye Bass Library and makes available reproductions for research, publication, and other uses.
