        "text": "American actor and racecar driver (born 1966)\n\nPatrick Galen Dempsey (born January 13, 1966)[1] is an American actor and racing driver. He is best known for his role as neurosurgeon Derek \"McDreamy\" Shepherd in the ABC medical drama series Grey's Anatomy from 2005-15, and returned again from 2020-21. He is also known for his leading man romantic films roles, including in Enchanted (2007). Dempsey has received nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globe Awards, and was named as People's Sexiest Man Alive in 2023.[2]\n\nDempsey started his career acting in films such as Can't Buy Me Love (1987) and Loverboy (1989). He has since starred in several romantic comedy films such as Sweet Home Alabama (2002), Made of Honor (2008), Valentine's Day (2010), and Bridget Jones's Baby (2016). Dempsey has also taken dramatic roles in Outbreak (1995), Scream 3 (2000), Freedom Writers (2007), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), Thanksgiving (2023), and Ferrari (2023). He starred in and produced Flypaper (2011), and The Art of Racing in the Rain (2019).\n\nDempsey, who maintains a sports car and vintage car collection, enjoys auto racing in his spare time. He has competed in events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans and Rolex 24 at Daytona sports car races, and the Ensenada SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race. Prior to the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey declared that he would \"walk away\" from acting if he could and dedicate himself full-time to motorsports.[3]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nDempsey was born in Lewiston, Maine,[1] and grew up in the nearby towns of Turner and Buckfield. He has two older sisters.[4] His mother, Amanda (née Casson),[5][6] was a school secretary, and his father, William, was an insurance salesman.[1][7][8]\n\nHe attended Leavitt Area High School, Buckfield High School and St. Dominic Regional High School, and after moving to Houston attended Willowridge High School.[4]\n\nIn his youth, Dempsey participated in juggling competitions. In 1981, he achieved second place at the International Jugglers' Association Championship in the Juniors category, just behind Anthony Gatto, who is considered to be the best technical juggler of all time.[9]\n\nDempsey was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 12. He told Barbara Walters on her 2008 Oscar special that he thinks dyslexia made him what he is today. \"It's given me a perspective of — you have to keep working,\" Dempsey told Walters. \"I have never given up.\"[10]\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\n1984–1989: Early roles and breakthrough\n\n[edit]\n\nAn invitation to audition for a role in the stage production of Torch Song Trilogy led to Patrick Dempsey's discovery as an actor. His audition was successful and he spent the following four months touring with the company in Philadelphia. He followed this with another tour, Brighton Beach Memoirs, in the lead role, which was directed by Gene Saks. Dempsey has also made notable appearances in the stage productions of On Golden Pond, with the Maine Acting Company, and as Timmy (the Martin Sheen role) in a 1990 off-Broadway revival of The Subject Was Roses co-starring with John Mahoney and Dana Ivey at the Roundabout Theatre in New York.\n\nDempsey's first major feature film role was at age 21 with Beverly D'Angelo in the film In The Mood, the actual World War II story about Ellsworth Wisecarver whose relationships with older married women created a national uproar. He then co-starred in the third installment of the comedy classic Meatballs III: Summer Job, alongside Sally Kellerman in 1987. This was followed by the teen comedy Can't Buy Me Love in 1987 with actress Amanda Peterson and Some Girls with Jennifer Connelly in 1988. In 1989, Dempsey had the lead role in the films Loverboy with actress Kirstie Alley and Happy Together with actress Helen Slater.[11]\n\n1990–2004: Established actor\n\n[edit]\n\nDempsey made several featured appearances in television in the 1990s; he was cast several times in pilots that were not picked up for a full season, including lead roles in the TV versions of the films The Player and About A Boy. He received positive reviews,[12] however, as he portrayed real-life mob boss, Meyer Lansky in 1991 when Mobsters was put on the screen. His first major television role was a three-episode stint as Will Truman's closeted sportscaster boyfriend on Will & Grace. He appeared in four episodes of Once & Again as Aaron Brooks, the schizophrenic brother of Lily (Sela Ward). Dempsey received an Emmy[13] nomination in 2001 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for the role of Aaron. In 1993, he played a young John F. Kennedy in the two-part TV mini-series JFK: Reckless Youth. In 2000, he played Detective Kincaid in Scream 3.[11]\n\nDempsey had a high-profile role as the fiancé of Reese Witherspoon's character in Sweet Home Alabama (2002). In 2004, he co-starred in the highly acclaimed HBO production Iron Jawed Angels, opposite Hilary Swank and Anjelica Huston. He also appeared as special guest star in The Practice for its three-episode finale season (8x13-8x15).\n\n2005–2015: Stardom and Grey's Anatomy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Grey's Anatomy\n\nDempsey has received significant public attention for his role as Dr. Derek \"McDreamy\" Shepherd in the medical drama Grey's Anatomy opposite Ellen Pompeo. Before landing the role, Dempsey auditioned for the role of Dr. Chase on another medical show, House. He also appeared in two episodes of the later Grey's spinoff Private Practice, playing the same character of Dr. Shepherd.[11] The relationship his character had with Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) on screen has received a lot of praise and positive reactions.\n\nIn 2007, Dempsey starred in the Disney film Enchanted, and the Paramount Pictures film Freedom Writers, where he reunited with his Iron Jawed Angels co-star Hilary Swank. He also voiced the character Kenai in Brother Bear sequel Brother Bear 2, replacing Joaquin Phoenix. Dempsey's most recent roles include the 2008 film Made of Honor as Tom, and the 2010 romantic comedy Valentine's Day; the latter film follows five interconnecting stories about Los Angelinos anticipating (or in some cases dreading) the holiday of love.[14] Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the prize-winning novel The Art of Racing in the Rain in July 2009, for Dempsey to star in.[15] The film instead starred Milo Ventimiglia.[16] He starred as Dylan Gould in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011).[17][18]\n\nIn January 2014, he signed a two-year contract to remain on Grey's Anatomy, then in its tenth season, that would ensure his participation for potential 11th and 12th seasons.[19][20][21] Dempsey was nominated for Best Actor – Television Series Drama at the 2006 Golden Globe Awards for the role. His success on the show has led to his becoming a spokesman for Mazda and State Farm Insurance.[22][23] BuddyTV ranked him #1 on its list of \"TV's Sexiest Men of 2011\".[24] In November 2020, Dempsey appeared as Derek Shepherd at the start of the series' 17th season for the first time since the character had died in April 2015.[25]\n\n2016–present\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing his departure from Grey's Anatomy, Dempsey was working on two small-screen projects: a drama The Limit for SundanceTV and a travelogue spy thriller called Fodors. He said:\n\nI would love to do something else. I'm going to take the rest of the year off to develop. I would like to be a producer. I would commit to a show that is 10 to 12 episodes. But 24 again, I don't know if I would do that. It's a very hard life. It's financially rewarding but there comes a point where how much is enough, really? I'm focusing now on developing and racing and being a father to my children.[26]\n\nIn 2016, Dempsey starred in the Universal Pictures film Bridget Jones's Baby with Renée Zellweger and Colin Firth,[27] and in 2018 he appeared on Epix television miniseries The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair.[28] In 2017 he participated in the short film Red Nose Day Actually, a sequel to the 2003 romantic comedy Love Actually. Dempsey played the role of the husband of Laura Linney's character Sarah. Starting from 2020 he has portrayed Harry Morgan in the Sky Atlantic financial thriller series Devils. On February 4, 2020, Dempsey signed on to star as the lead of a CBS political drama pilot Ways & Means, where he would portray a Congressional leader.[29] Initially planned to be considered for the 2020-21 televisions season, the pilot was rolled into consideration for the following season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CBS ultimately passed on the finished pilot in May 2021.[30] In January 2021, it was announced that Dempsey would reprise his role in the Enchanted sequel, Disenchanted, which began production in spring of that year.[31] The film was released on Disney+ in late 2022.[32] In 2023, he portrayed Sheriff Eric Newlon in the slasher film Thanksgiving and Piero Taruffi in the biographical sports drama Ferrari directed by Michael Mann.\n\nAuto racing\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2014, Dempsey told Reuters in the Hockenheimring support paddock at the German Grand Prix that motor racing was not just a hobby, and had become as much a part of who he is as acting. He said, \"It's all-consuming in many ways. I couldn't imagine not racing right now. It really keeps me motivated. It's all I think about on a daily basis.\"[33]\n\nDempsey, who maintains an extensive sports and vintage car collection, has enjoyed auto racing in his spare time for several years. Before the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2013, he said that he would like to compete full-time, telling Eurosport:\n\nI would like to make that [motorsports] a complete priority and just focus on this full-time. If I could just walk away from acting, I think I could do that very easily, and just focus on the driving, I would love that more than anything else.[34]\n\nHe has competed in prestigious events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans and Rolex 24 at Daytona sports car races, and the Tecate SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race. He was a co-owner of the Vision Racing IndyCar Series team and current owner of Dempsey Racing, which is presently racing two Porsche 911 GT America's in the Tudor United Sports Car Series. He participated in this series as often as his schedule allowed, although insurance restrictions kept him from driving competitively while also filming a motion picture. In 2009, he raced a Team Seattle Advanced Engineering Ferrari F430 GT in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans's GT2 class and finished ninth in class.[35]\n\nDempsey announced he would race the 2011 Rolex 24 at Daytona along with other races throughout the season in a Mazda RX-8.[36] Dempsey finished in third place in the GT Class of the Rolex 24 at Daytona. In 2012, Dempsey competed in the Grand-Am Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge behind the wheel of an Aston Martin Racing-Multimatic Motorsports Aston Martin Vantage GT4, which, after five successful racing seasons in Europe, was to make its debut on American tracks. He formed the Dempsey Racing team to compete in the American Le Mans Series. The team fielded a full-time Oreca FLM09 in the Prototype Challenge class as well as a Lola B12/80 coupe in the Prototype 2 class from Laguna Seca onward. [citation needed]\n\nAfter debuting at the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey returned to France four years later and competed in a Porsche 997 GT3 RSR at the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. Dempsey and his co-drivers finished 29th overall and fourth in-class. [citation needed] In 2015, Dempsey focused on participating in the FIA World Endurance Championship with his own Dempsey Racing-Proton team in the GTE-Am class in a Porsche 997 GT3 RSR, teamed with Patrick Long[37] and Marco Seefried. He told Porsche Newsroom: \"Not much changes in my TV work, but everything changes constantly in motor racing – every lap, every bend and every moment.\"[37]\n\nRacing record\n\n[edit]\n\nCareer

Versace and was featured in ads for Serengeti sunglasses. In November 2008, he launched an Avon fragrance named Unscripted. In June 2009, Women's Wear Daily reported the launch of a second Avon fragrance named Patrick Dempsey 2.[56] The fragrance was recognized as the \"Men's Private Label/Direct Sell\" for the 2010 FiFi Awards.[57][58] On September 29, 2012, Mexican cable company Cablemás, Megacable and Mexico city's Cablevisión launched an advertising campaign featuring Dempsey as the love interest of a domestic worker who comes across his profile on an online dating site.[59]\n\nStarting in 2013, Patrick Dempsey became the face of Silhouette, promoting eyewear fashion from Austria.[60] From January 2017 Dempsey appears for Vodafone Italy and he appears in some Italian spots about it.[61] In 2018, Bleusalt, a Malibu-based fashion brand launched a clothing line designed by the actor.[62][63]\n\nBusiness interests\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2013, Dempsey announced that his company (Global Baristas) had secured the winning bid to purchase Seattle-based Tully's Coffee, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October. Dempsey's bid of $9.15M was enough to secure Tully's over the bids of six others, including Starbucks. Dempsey's company will control 47 Tully's locations in the Seattle area, but not the online business, which had been purchased by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in 2009.[64]\n\nFollowing a legal dispute with investor group Global Baristas, Dempsey left the group, in effect officially leaving his managerial positions with Tully's. Dempsey filed a lawsuit on behalf of Global Baristas, claiming Michael Avenatti borrowed $2 million against Tully's assets without informing Dempsey, rather than fully financing the coffee chain as was promised, calling the 15 percent interest rate on the loan \"exorbitant\" and sued for Avenatti to fund Tully's operations and meet its working capital needs, as well as for any damages owed the company. Soon after, Dempsey's lawyer's office issued a statement saying the partnership was dissolved and that Dempsey wished the lawyer and the company \"all the best\". Avenatti has stated the dispute was a \"misunderstanding\" and will continue operating with other investors and new management.[65][66]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1997, Dempsey's mother, Amanda, was diagnosed with cancer which subsequently relapsed five times. On March 24, 2014, she died in Lewiston, Maine, aged 79.[67] In response to his mother's bouts with cancer, Dempsey helped start the Patrick Dempsey Center at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. In October 2009, when Dempsey introduced the first Dempsey Challenge, registration was closed after reaching the goal of 3,500 cyclists, runners and walkers. The event raised more than $1 million for the cancer center. His mother was in the crowd as Dempsey finished his 50-mile (80 km) ride.[68] The Challenge has since become an annual October event presented by Amgen in the Lewiston–Auburn area.[69] On May 28, 2017, Dempsey received an honorary doctorate from Bates College in his hometown, Lewiston, Maine, for his philanthropy in the town and funding of \"the Dempsey Center — just blocks from the Bates campus.\"[70]\n\nDempsey was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bowdoin College in 2013 for his philanthropic work.[71] His Grey's Anatomy character Derek Shepherd had been written as a Bowdoin graduate after an alumnus led a petition signed by over 450 students to \"adopt\" the character as an alumnus.[72]\n\nIn 2023, Dempsey helped raise funds for families of the Lewiston shooting victims.[73] He joined a charity softball tournament with former Boston Red Sox pitcher Bill \"Spaceman\" Lee.[74]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nDempsey was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 12. As a result, it is necessary for him to memorize all his lines to perform, even for auditions where he is unlikely to get the part.[75][76]\n\nEntertainment Weekly put Dempsey's hair on its end-of-the-decade \"best-of\" list, saying, \"What made Grey's Anatomy a mega-medi-hit? It could have something to do with creator Shonda Rhimes's scalpel-sharp writing… or McDreamy's impossibly luxurious man hair. Just saying.\"[77] In 2005, People magazine ranked him second in its annual list of \"Sexiest Men Alive\"[78] and again in 2006.[79] Patrick Dempsey was named People magazine's \"sexiest man alive\" for its Nov. 20, 2023, issue.[80]\n\nDempsey has been married twice. On August 24, 1987,[1] he married his manager,[81] actress and acting coach, Rochelle \"Rocky\" Parker, when he was 21 and she was 48.[82] She appeared with Dempsey in the film In the Mood. While it has been reported that Dempsey married his best friend's mother, he has said that he became best friends with Parker's son only after he became romantically involved with Parker. The couple divorced on April 26, 1994. She died in 2014.[83]\n\nOn July 31, 1999, Dempsey married Jillian Fink.[81] The couple have three children.[81][84][4][83] In January 2015, Fink filed for divorce,[85] but the couple reconciled later in the year.[86] They called off their divorce on November 12, 2016.[87] Dempsey formerly owned a home in Harpswell, Maine near his hometown. His mother moved into a farm next to his home.[88] Dempsey is a supporter of Scottish football club Rangers F.C. because of his Scottish connection through his step-grandfather.[89]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1985 The Stuff Underground Stuff Buyer #2 Uncredited Heaven Help Us Corbet 1986 A Fighting Choice Kellin Taylor Meatballs III: Summer Job Rudy Gerner 1987 Can't Buy Me Love Ronald Miller In the Mood Ellsworth 'Sonny' Wisecarver 1988 Some Girls Michael In a Shallow Grave Potter Daventry 1989 Loverboy Randy Bodek Happy Together Christopher Wooden 1990 Coupe de Ville Robert 'Bobby' Libner 1991 Mobsters Meyer Lansky Run Charlie Farrow 1993 Bank Robber Billy Face the Music Charlie Hunter 1994 With Honors Everett Calloway Ava's Magical Adventure Jeffrey Also director 1995 Outbreak Jimbo Scott 1997 Hugo Pool Floyd Gaylen 1998 Denial Sam The Escape Clayton 2000 Scream 3 Det.
