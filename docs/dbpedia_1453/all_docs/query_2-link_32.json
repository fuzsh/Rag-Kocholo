        "text": "Megan Dempsey was trying to come up with the right word to describe her late husband, Mark, the often-crass South Sider who leveraged loves of restaurants, politics and his Irish heritage into a mainstay restaurant on South High Street.\n\n“‘Fun’ doesn’t do it,” she said, recalling stories of stolen Blarney Stones, cigars with presidential campaigners and late-night jam sessions with big-name musicians.\n\nThere were also all sorts of cringe-worthy moments, including during Mark Dempsey’s final days in an intensive-care unit following two massive heart attacks in late December.\n\nLife (and death) with Mark Dempsey was never boring.\n\n“It wasn’t easy,” Megan Dempsey said. “It was very loud. It was very messy. A lot of it was hard. But in the end, it was wonderful.”\n\nMark Dempsey died on Jan. 10 at age 55. Dempsey’s Food and Spirits, 346 S. High St., however, had remained open for business, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner and accommodating any number of meetings involving politicians, business leaders, public officials and others every day until the coronavirus and Gov. Mike DeWine intervened.\n\nThey gathered there in late January, too, as part of a celebration of Mark Dempsey’s life.\n\n“Our dad died, and it’s bull----,” one of his daughters said at that event, echoing the course language that Mark Dempsey frequently uttered. “We weren’t expecting this to happen, and things escalated quickly, but like most things with Dad, it was fast and dramatic.”\n\nThey’ll keep gathering at Dempsey’s once the pandemic passes if Megan Dempsey has anything to do with it. Her family is working to keep her husband’s vision alive and kicking.\n\nMark Dempsey had a background in the restaurant business before establishing his namesake establishment.\n\nHe met Megan in 1989 while catering a Christmastime meal at the attorney general’s office, where she worked. A few months later, he invited her to walk in the St. Patrick’s Day parade with him and then hired her as weekend help for his catering business.\n\n“We never really dated,” Megan Dempsey said. “We just did caterings together.”\n\nThey married the following March and ran a bar (the former Costello’s in Thurber Village, until Big Bear took over the space) for a time.\n\nMark Dempsey then worked in city and county government before opening Dempsey’s Food and Spirits in March 2012.\n\nMegan Dempsey recalled when the prospect had come up in conversation, during a drive home. Her husband explained his plan to cash in all his retirement savings and find investors to transform an empty former nightclub catty-corner from the county administration building.\n\n“He wanted to do this,” she said. “As with everything with him, it was never boring with him. We were always on the edge of peril.”\n\nWalk into Dempsey’s, and you’ll see his vision: a classic, long bar and tables for eating, surrounded by walls filled with photos of political figures and memorabilia. Although he was a staunch Democrat and an elected member of the party’s Franklin County central committee, Mark Dempsey was close to people on both sides of the political aisle, as evidenced by the large color picture of Republican President Ronald Reagan featured prominently on the main wall of the restaurant.\n\nMegan Dempsey actually started working alongside her husband last summer, leaving her job at the attorney general’s office to help run the restaurant and two other businesses (The Jury Room on Mound Street and the new Point on the Park on South High just off the John F. Wolfe Columbus Commons).\n\nMark Dempsey didn’t have known heart problems before the attacks that took his life. Megan Dempsey said that December was very busy, with holiday parties and family gatherings at the restaurant and their other businesses every day. Her husband looked and felt tired, but she described the end of the event season, with a last party at Dempsey’s, complete with an Irish band.\n\n“I remember walking in,” she said. “Mark was sitting at the table over there, playing euchre like he loved. There was Irish music. It was pretty good.”\n\nA couple of weeks later, he was gone.\n\nOne of the Dempseys’ five children, son Conor, left his job to return and help run the restaurant after his father’s death. It took some adjustment, particularly after someone brought in a life-sized standee of his dad — it’s affectionately named “Flat Mark” — and stood it by the front door.\n\n“I walked in … and he was standing right there,” Conor Dempsey said. “It got me three or four times in a row. I thought that my dad was there. … He should be there.”\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the resulting statewide restrictions on restaurants and bars have further thrown Dempsey’s for a loop. Megan Dempsey said the restaurant is reducing its hours and offering carryout lunch and dinner. She said the staff will reassess in coming days whether it is feasible to keep the doors open during the outbreak.\n\nMark Dempsey probably would have voiced support for how DeWine, a Republican, and Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, are handling the situation.\n\n“There's a gazillion things (I miss about him), but specifically I miss his leadership in a crisis,” Megan Dempsey said in an email message. “He would have known exactly what to do in this situation for Dempsey's, been a voice of reason for the Irish community in its response to Green Season festivities, and just as loud about his opinions regarding the primary (election) and how this whole COVID-19 mess has been handled by our government leaders.”\n\nmkovac@dispatch.com\n\n@OhioCapitalBlog"
