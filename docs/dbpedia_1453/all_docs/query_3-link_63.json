        "text": "Clint Dempsey isnât just poised to become the US national team's all-time leading goal-scorer.\n\nHeâs on the cusp of American soccer immortality â a label bestowed upon an elite group of players whoâve represented the Stars and Stripes.\n\nTim Howard is in that mix. As is Michael Bradley, even according to Red Bulls coach Jesse Marsch, who pumped Captain Americaâs tires last month.\n\nFor most, Landon Donovan still tops the select billing of Americans whoâve posted phenomenal numbers while representing the US on the biggest stage. He might have cemented his place atop that list if Jurgen Klinsmann hadnât botched his 2014 World Cup selections, inexplicably leaving Donovan at home.\n\nBut Klinsmann did. And Donovan, while an undisputed icon, didnât get the chance to cement his place as the greatest American to ever put on a US jersey.\n\nThree years later, Dempsey soon will become his countryâs all-time leading scorer, passing his ex-teammate when he scores his 58th international goal.\n\nWhether he finds it in Wednesday nightâs Gold Cup final (9:30 pm ET on FS1, Univision and TSN), or in the looming World Cup qualifiers in September, it doesnât matter. Dempseyâs already ticked every box on the G.O.A.T. checklist while accomplishing as much as or arguably more than â both individually and collectively â any American before him.\n\nIn addition to achieving the all-time goals mark, Dempseyâs 136 caps place him third on the all-time appearances list (Cobi Jones is No. 1 with 164). Heâs also scored big goals in big tournaments.\n\nMost significant, Dempseyâs four World Cup goals are second all-time to Donovan (5), though Deuce could appear at a fourth World Cup next summer.\n\nBut whether he does or doesnât play in Russia, Dempseyâs legacy shouldnât be defined solely by goals or big moments that will live on in US soccer lore.\n\nRather, itâs about taking the road less traveled â a well-documented rags-to-riches soccer tale that, in many ways, embodies the American Dream.\n\nThat unconventional path spawned an unconventional American soccer player who, as U.S. national team coach Bruce Arena once said, just âtries s*.â It was a simple two-word quote that should be carved into Dempseyâs future Hall of Fame name plate, given how well it defines his uniqueness.\n\nOn top of the grit and determination that defines American internationals, Dempseyâs always had a few extra tools in his shed. The audacity to use them â without fear or reservation â ultimately is what sets the 34-year-old apart from every other American striker.\n\nItâs a style thatâs borderline arrogant until you hear Dempsey explain it. Then you realize itâs merely a byproduct of his humble beginnings in East Texas, where he grew up in a trailer in his grandparents' backyard. It included matches against grown men in the local Hispanic leagues and six-hour roundtrip drives to practices.\n\nHeâs a US soccer star who reached his potential, a player who did it his own way and wonât have regrets when he features in his final international fixture.\n\nLike Dempsey, the great ones donât look back and wonder what might have been. They leave little debate as to whether they could have gone further.\n\nThatâs Dempsey â an all-time great whose all-time career should be defined just as much by his journey and personality and penchant for the head-turning play or pass or goal as it should by the numbers that ultimately could lead us to categorize him as the greatest ever to don an American soccer jersey."
