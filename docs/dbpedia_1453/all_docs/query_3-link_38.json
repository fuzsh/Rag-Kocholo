After Jeff passed away Mark made it a point to always have a few of the Jeff McGowan Memorial 5K race pint glasses on hand at Dempsey's for Jeff's family and many friends who stopped in to raise a pint in honor of him. Mark passed away in January but we'd like to think he and Jeff are raising a pint in honor of all the participants in this year's race.\" - Megan Dempsey, Mark's wife.\n\nRegister online at: https://runsignup.com/jeffmcgowan5k\n\nFor a race flyer: PRINT APPLICATION\n\nThis year’s Columbus Shamrock Club’s St. Patrick’s Parade badge honors both Jeff McGowan and Mark Dempsey - here is the story behind the badge - http://runohio.com/index.php/news-features/features/150-2021-columbus-shamrock-club-parade-badge\n\nAthletes who pick up their race packet early at the Short North Columbus Running Company store for the Jeff McGowan Memorial 5K in Memory of Jeff McGowan and Mark Dempsey will receive a free Columbus Shamrock Club’s Parade badge while supply last."
