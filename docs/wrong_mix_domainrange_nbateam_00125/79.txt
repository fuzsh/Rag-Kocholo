Former Central Michigan University star Chris Kaman has enjoyed an outstanding season and plenty of people are noticing, so many that it's hard to consider Kaman "under the radar" even though he plays for the Los Angeles Clippers. There is a movement to get Kaman on the NBA Western Conference all-star team.

seattlepi.com: It seems like a waste for big man Chris Kaman to be playing for the Los Angeles Clippers due to the lack of exposure and playoff experience. The Clippers were exposed without their center in the paint and hope his recent return will lead into something positive.

latimes.com: As former Clippers teammate Elton Brand could tell Chris Kaman, players from teams with records below .500 face long odds of locking down spots in the NBA All-Star Game.

dimemag.com: Is there a particular reason why Chris Kaman gets no love? You can argue that the Los Angeles Clippers big man is the most dominant center in the West right now, yet he rarely gets press and he damn sure gets no fan love. As of the latest All-Star voting results, Kaman was not even in the top 10 of centers in the West despite averaging 20.4 ppg, 9.3 rpg and 1.4 bpg for the season.

There could be several factors why Kaman’s game has been ignored for so long. For seven seasons, Kaman has been playing for L.A.’s JV squad that has only appeared in one playoff series (2005-06) during his tenure. He’s also not exactly the league’s most marketable player. But with his stats and the Clippers actually doing decent (considering they've been without Blake Griffin) this season, Kaman deserved to get some serious All-Star consideration.
