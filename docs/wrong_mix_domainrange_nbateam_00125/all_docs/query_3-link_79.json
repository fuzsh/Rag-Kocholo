        "text": "The Lakers were a happy bunch of fellas late Tuesday night. They defeated the playoff-contending New York Knicks, the team for which former coach Phil Jackson now works, by an almost unbelievable score of 127-96 before a sellout crowd of 18,997 at Staples Center.\n\nIt was Los Angeles’ second consecutive victory.\n\nThe Lakers did it without Pau Gasol, who was out with vertigo that forced him to miss the second half of Sunday’s victory over the Orlando Magic. In his place, Chris Kaman got a rare start and though rusty because he has not played since Feb. 28, he contributed nicely with 13 points, nine rebounds and three assists.\n\nMore than that, it was a record-breaking night for Los Angeles, which scored 51 points in the third quarter, surpassing the previous franchise record of 49.\n\nXavier Henry led the Lakers (24-46) with 22 points, Nick Young had 20, Kent Bazemore 18 and Jodie Meeks scored 14. Los Angeles shot 57.8 percent (48 of 83) from the field, an unheard of 64.3 percent (18 of 28) from 3-point range.\n\nNew York (29-42), which came in 2 1/2 games out of a playoff spot in the Eastern conference, got 29 points from Carmelo Anthony.\n\nWhen told of the record-setting third quarter, Robert Sacre smiled big.\n\n“We’re setting records around this thing,” said Sacre, who scored eight points and had five rebounds and four assists.\n\nRyan Kelly had nine points, four rebounds and eight assists. He, too, was jazzed.\n\n“We have that ability and it always feels good to put one together where you do a good job offensively, obviously, and solid defensively, too.”\n\nCoach Mike D’Antoni spoke postgame about how well everyone played, both offensively and defensively. Then he was asked what he thought about the play of Kaman, considering he had not played in a game in nearly a month.\n\n“Yeah, I mean, well, he plays every day,” D’Antoni said. “I mean, you know, you’re talking about in a game, but you can practice. A guy should stay ready — and he stayed ready. He’s a professional and did the right thing. But, yeah, he’s played well.\n\n“Every time he’s had extended minutes, he’s played well. … And then going forward, as long as Pau stays out, he’ll play well.”\n\nIt’s been a long campaign for Kaman, who had played in just 34 games prior to Tuesday. He had DNP after his name in the box score more than he’d like to remember.\n\nHe hasn’t exactly fit into D’Antoni’s style of play, so he just hasn’t seen the floor much. He spoke candidly about it an hour before tipoff.\n\n“It’s a very unique situation,” said Kaman, 31, who has averaged 11.7 points and 7.9 rebounds over 11 seasons. “Kind of difficult to even touch around. But the bottom line is this is basketball in the NBA, it’s how it goes sometimes. But the best thing to do is try to be a professional about it and be as ready as you can.\n\n“It’s been a long season. I can’t wait until it’s over, I’ll say that.”\n\nAgain, the last time Kaman played before Tuesday was Feb. 28. That was also the last game Jordan Hill played until he came back on March 21 after missing three weeks with a knee injury. Still, no Kaman. Even when Gasol missed the second half against the Orlando Magic on Sunday, Kaman did not play.\n\n“I didn’t know what was going to happen when Pau went down last game, so I figured I might have played then and I didn’t,” Kaman said. “Then I didn’t know what to anticipate. Jordan Hill was out the last few weeks and I didn’t play at all. We only had two bigs, so I thought maybe I would play.”\n\nKaman, who said he hasn’t even had a conversation with D’Antoni since the two talked briefly before a March 3 game at Portland, was asked if he was excited to be playing.\n\n“I’m just thrilled,” the 7-foot post said, somewhat sarcastically. “I’m enthralled. I’m ready to go.”\n\nFinally, Kaman was asked if he has made peace with the situation.\n\n“I’m not at peace about it,” said Kaman, who has averaged 9.9 points and 5.6 rebounds when he has played. “I’m pissed about it. But I can’t control it, I’m not in charge, I don’t control the wheels.”"
