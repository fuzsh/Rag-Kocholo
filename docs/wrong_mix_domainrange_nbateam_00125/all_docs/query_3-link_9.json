        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nWas a skilled and mobile 7-footer with excellent intensity; he battled on every play. Got great position and used a solid array of moves to succeed at both ends of the floor. Was a good scorer, strong rebounder and an above-average shot-blocker. Injuries were an issue for him throughout his long NBA career. Sometimes, he got into foul trouble a bit too easily. Was never much of a passer and he suffered through jags when he turned the ball over too readily."
