        "text": "Chris Kaman was one of the more frustrated Lakers this season as his minutes fluctuated throughout the season, despite showing he has quite a bit left in the tank when he got the chance to play.\n\nWhile there was a slight chance that Kaman could return to the team, that is no longer an option as Kaman has agreed to a two-year deal with the Portland Trail Blazers according to Yahoo! Sports’ Adrian Wojnarowski:\n\nKaman signed with the Lakers hoping to get an opportunity to showcase that he can still be a contributor for a great team. While there were bumps along the way, he was able to show enough to get a good deal.\n\nNow joining the Portland Trail Blazers, Kaman will be able to get some more consistent minutes as the Blazers had very little as far as depth behind their starters of LaMarcus Aldridge and Robin Lopez. The Blazers are also one of the league’s up and coming teams, making the second round of the playoffs last season.\n\nKaman now becomes the second former Laker to cash in this off-season, joining Jodie Meeks who signed a three-year deal worth $19 million to join the Detroit Pistons.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video"
