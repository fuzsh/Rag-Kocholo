        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers agreed to a one-year deal with free agent center Chris Kaman, multiple media outlets reported.\n\nIt was not immediately known how much money the contract is worth.\n\nThe Lakers centered on Kaman after losing out on free agent Dwight Howard, who signed with the Houston Rockets last week. The deal for Kaman will not impact the Lakers salary cap space for 2014.\n\nKaman, 31, struggled with injuries last season with Dallas Mavericks. He averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds in 66 games.\n\n---The Golden State Warriors are involved in a three-team, sign-and-trade deal that sends a trade exception and Utah Jazz free agent guard Randy Foye to the Denver Nuggets, according to Yahoo! Sports.\n\nDenver will sign-and-trade forward Andre Iguodala to Golden State for the four-year, $48 million contract he agreed to sign with the Warriors. This creates a $12 million trade exception for the Nuggets, which they have a year to use before it expires.\n\nUtah will sign-and-trade Foye to the Nuggets on a three-year, $9 million deal, with a team option on the third year.\n\n---The Cleveland Cavaliers are interested in giving free agent center Andrew Bynum a generous one-year contract, ESPN reported Monday.\n\nBynum, out all last season because of a knee injury, has drawn interest from several teams.\n\nThe Cavaliers are willing to give Bynum several million dollars if he is willing to sign a one-year contract. Cleveland is about $15 million under the salary cap.\n\n---Free agent guard Monta Ellis is in contract talks with the Sacramento Kings, CBS Sports reported.\n\nEllis became a free agent after opting out of his contract with the Milwaukee Bucks that would have paid him $11 million next season.\n\n---Point guard Chris Paul said he is glad to be with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n\"I'm excited,\" Paul told ESPN Los Angeles on Sunday night. \"I'm excited about everything that's going on with the team. I talked to my wife about it because I told her it was going to be a family decision. We even let (son) 'Little Chris' chime in on it. It's pretty cool to know where you're going to be and to know you're somewhere where you're wanted. The fans have been amazing. I told my wife I felt like a rookie all over again just because I'm excited about the unexpected.\"\n\nPaul was quick to re-sign with the team for five years and $107 million when he became a free agent a week ago.\n\n---The Detroit News reported that former Detroit Pistons power forward/center Rasheed Wallace agreed to join the team's coaching staff to work with their big men.\n\nThe team has not made an announcement.\n\n---The Philadelphia 76ers named Scott O'Neil the organization's new chief executive officer.\n\nO'Neil starts the job July 16. He will be responsible for overseeing every aspect of the team's business operations.\n\n---The Washington Wizards signed first-round selection Otto Porter, the team announced.\n\nPorter was the third overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft. He averaged 16.2 points and 7.5 rebounds last season for Georgetown.\n\nThe Wizards also signed Glen Rice Jr., who was a second-round pick this year after spending the 2012-2013 season with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League."
