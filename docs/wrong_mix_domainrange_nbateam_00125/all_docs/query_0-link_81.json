        "text": "With the Portland Trail Blazers 2014-15 season wrapped, we evaluate the roster player-by-player, giving the fans the power of who should stay and who should go.\n\nChris Kaman\n\nPosition: C Height/Weight: 7-0/265 NBA experience: 12 seasons 2014-15 salary: $4.8 million Contract status: Kaman completed the first year of two-year, $9.8 million free agent contract. The second year is only partially guaranteed at $1 million. The Blazers hold a team option for 2015-16 season.\n\n2014-15 season notables: Appeared in 74 games (13 starts) in his first season with Portland, averaging 8.6 points (51.5% FG), 6.5 rebounds and 0.9 assists in 18.9 minutes. ... Scored a season-high 16 points on five different occasions. ... Made a season-high eight field goals (out of 10) against New Orleans on Dec. 20 (16 points) ... Grabbed a season-best 13 rebounds twice. ... Shot a perfect 6-of-6 against Dallas on Nov. 6, marking the first career time that he shot 100 percent from the field with six or more attempts.\n\nChris Kaman wasn't the Trail Blazers' first choice when the free agency period opened last summer, but he was a solid Plan B.\n\nArmed with the midlevel and biannual exceptions, GM Neil Olshey sought to bolster the Blazers' bench with priority No. 1 scouring the free agent market for a floor-spacing big man.\n\nThe shortlist of stretch fours included former Blazers Channing Frye and Josh McRoberts, with Spencer Hawes the top target. But after Frye and McRoberts inked more lucrative free agent deals, and Hawes opted to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers over joining the Blazers, Olshey turned to a familiar and reliable face hungry to again play for a winner.\n\n\"I wanted to go somewhere where I felt like I would fit, that I would actually help the team,\" Kaman said after signing a two-year, $9.8 million deal with Portland in July, \"and not go to a team where they were trying to build or rebuild or where I would get stuck on the bench or play a small role. I wanted to go somewhere where I feel like I was going to help the team.\"\n\nKaman was a welcomed addition a much-maligned second unit, not only providing veteran stability and a scoring punch as a backup to Robin Lopez, but also serving as a mentor to a 22-year-old Meyers Leonard.\n\nA former All-Star with the Clippers -- where his relationship with Olshey and Blazers assistant Kim Hughes began -- Kaman came to Portland with career averages of 11.7 points and 7.9 rebounds, looking to serve as a utility player in the second unit.\n\n\"My job is to come off the bench this year and be as efficient as possible and that's what I'm trying to do,\" Kaman said after scoring 12 points on 6 for 10 from the floor and grabbing six rebounds in his Blazers debut.\n\nHe led all of Portland reserves in scoring with 8.6 points per game, adding 6.5 rebounds in 74 games this season. Kaman posted double-digit scoring on 30 occasions, 24 times recording at least 10 points and five rebounds. Three of his four double-doubles this season came in a reserve role.\n\nHe started 13 straight games in January, averaging 8.8 points and 8.6 rebounds in 25 minutes a night in place of injured bigs Lopez and Joel Freeland.\n\nLike many of his teammates, Kaman was not immune to the injury bug. He missed eight regular-season games with various ailments (back, shoulder, thumb), with an ankle injury forcing him out of two playoff appearances.\n\nThough admittedly on the backend of his career, Kaman, 33, showed he can be a productive member of a winning ball club. With the Blazers holding a team option on his contract for 2015-16, it's up to Olshey if that production continues in Portland.\n\nIf Kaman has it his way it will.\n\n\"I would love to play for the Blazers (next year),\" Kaman, heading into his 13th season, said during his exit interview with the media. \"It was a great season. I felt like I was able to play and just do my thing for the most part. ... I told Terry he's the first coach I haven't hated when the season was over since Mike Dunleavy. It's been a while that I haven't hated somebody.\"\n\nYou decide: Do you think Portland should use the team option on Kaman, brining him back next year? How would you assess his season with the Blazers? Cast your vote and post your comments on why Chris Kaman should stay or go."
