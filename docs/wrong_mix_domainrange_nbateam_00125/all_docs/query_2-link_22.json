        "text": "Dallas Mavericks center Chris Kaman, who hasn’t been cleared to practice and won’t until he passes the NBA-mandated test for players who sustain concussions, had some choice words Tuesday for the league’s protocol. “I got to take it tomorrow,” Kaman said about the test after doing some light shooting Tuesday. “It’s the stupidest test ever. “For so many years in the NBA, they never had to do that stuff and now they come up with all that concussion protocol crap. It’s not cool, but it is cool, I guess. It keeps people safe. I just try to do the right things and wait until I can pass the test.”\n\nKaman has expressed disappointment that things have not worked out better, although Elton Brand has been the team’s most effective center of late and Bernard James and Brandan Wright also have played well at times. “I talk to him all the time about it,” Carlisle said. “He’s a good player and we need him. We have good, honest conversations. Sometimes, there’s a difference of opinion, but that’s OK. Reasonable men have a right to disagree. “But I make it clear to him that he’s an important guy on this team, and we need him and need what he can do for us.”\n\nKaman on his experience being traded from the Clippers to New Orleans two years ago. “I got traded two years ago, and you don’t know. It just happens. I found out from my realtor’s son that I got traded. They didn’t call me, they didn’t tell me, they didn’t say anything to me. Then I got back from this meeting that I was having and at the facility they were ready and they told me. It happens all different ways for a lot of guys. Imagine the guys who get traded every year. Those guys who have been traded 13 times in this league. That’s not fun to have to move your whole family and all that but it’s part of the job and the money that we make is really good money obviously. There shouldn’t be many complaints.”\n\nChris Kaman On fans following players more than they follow a specific team. “One exception to that is the Spurs. They understand what they have. That’s why David Stern hates the Spurs. I probably shouldn’t say that but he doesn’t like when the Spurs are in the finals because the ratings go down. People say that all the time. I don’t know how true it is but you hear stories all about that is that the ratings are down. Their basketball is the purest basketball you’re going to find, in my opinion, in the NBA, just watching them play. They play a nice pace game. They’re defense is solid. Their plays are solid. They get all their guys involved. That’s why when he sat them guys against the Heat and sent them home, they still almost won that game.”"
