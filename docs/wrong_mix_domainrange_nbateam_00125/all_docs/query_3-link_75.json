        "text": "Since his return to the team, Chris Kaman has played well, putting up solid numbers on a nightly basis. But that hasn’t stopped the Hornets from shopping the big man, as the The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports Kaman is still on the market: “With the NBA trade deadline looming in 11 days, the Hornets remain open to trading veteran center Chris Kaman, according to league sources. Kaman, averaging a team-high 17.9 points and 9.8 rebounds in the past nine games going into Saturday, has been the subject of inquiries from interested teams. He has an expiring contract, and was acquired in the December blockbuster deal that sent All-Star point guard Chris Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers. But Kaman said he doesn’t care what the Hornets may decide to do before the trade deadline. Kaman was deactivated in January when the Hornets sought to trade him, and held him out for six games, before taking him off the trade market Feb. 3 when they couldn’t find a trade offer they liked. ‘I don’t care what they do,’’ Kaman said. ‘So if they want to trade me, trade me. If they want to keep me, keep me. I don’t care, but not in a disrespectful way. I just know I can’t control that part of it, so it’s something I don’t care about. That’s something for my agent to deal with, and I don’t think Coach cares about it. I think he’s trying to focus on winning games, and my teammates are doing the same.’”"
