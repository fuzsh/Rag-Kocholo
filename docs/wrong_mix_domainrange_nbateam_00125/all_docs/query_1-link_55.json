        "text": "American basketball player (born 1985)\n\nThis article is about the basketball player. For the militant, see Christopher Paul. For the American football player, see Chris Paul (American football).\n\nChristopher Emmanuel Paul (born May 6, 1985), nicknamed \"CP3\" and \"the Point God\", is an American professional basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the greatest point guards of all time,[5][6][7][8] he has won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, an NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, two Olympic gold medals, and led the NBA in assists five times and steals a record six times. Paul has also been selected to 12 NBA All-Star teams, 11 All-NBA teams, and nine NBA All-Defensive teams. In 2021, he was selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Paul also served as the president of the National Basketball Players Association from 2013 to 2021. Among the highest-paid athletes in the world, he holds endorsement deals with companies such as Jordan Brand and State Farm.\n\nPaul was a McDonald's All-American in high school and attended Wake Forest University for two years of college basketball, where he helped the Demon Deacons achieve their first-ever number-one ranking. Paul was selected as the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets, where he developed into one of the league's best players, finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting in 2008. During the 2011 offseason, the Hornets organized a deal to send Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the transaction was controversially voided by the NBA. He was instead dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers later that year. Led by Paul's playmaking, the Clippers developed a reputation for their fast-paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks, earning them the nickname \"Lob City\".\n\nIn 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets, where he helped the team win a franchise-record 65 games in his debut season. Paul played one more season in Houston before being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder as part of a package for Russell Westbrook in 2019. With the Thunder looking to rebuild, Paul was traded to the Phoenix Suns in 2020, where he reached the NBA Finals for the first time in his career in 2021. The following season, Paul helped the team win a franchise-record 64 games. After three seasons in Phoenix, Paul was traded and spent one season with the Golden State Warriors, where he came off the bench for the first time in his career. He later signed with the Spurs in 2024.\n\nEarly life\n\nChris Paul was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina,[9][a] to Charles Edward Paul and Robin Jones. He grew up in Lewisville with his older brother, Charles \"C.J.\" Paul.[9][10] Paul's family gave him the nickname \"CP3\" because Paul, his father, and his brother all share the same initials.[11] A former athlete himself, Charles Sr. taught his sons basketball and football and coached them in various youth leagues throughout their childhoods.[12] Growing up, the Paul brothers spent their summers working at a service station owned by their grandfather Nathaniel Jones;[13] Paul attributes many life lessons to his grandfather and has described him as his \"best friend.\"[14] Paul was raised Baptist.[15]\n\nHigh school career\n\nPaul attended West Forsyth High School in Clemmons, North Carolina.[16] During his freshman and sophomore seasons, he played on the junior varsity team.[17] For his junior year, Paul averaged 25 points, 5.3 assists, and 4.4 steals per game, helping West Forsyth reach the state semifinals.[18] Over the ensuing summer, he led the Winston-Salem-based Kappa Magic to the National U-17 AAU title, earning tournament MVP honors in the process.[19] During his senior season, Paul received national attention for scoring 61 points in a game; his 61-year-old grandfather was murdered earlier that year and Paul honored him by scoring one point for each year of his life.[16] Paul finished the season with averages of 30.8 points, 5.9 rebounds, 9.5 assists, and 6.0 steals per game, leading West Forsyth to a 27â€“3 record and the Class 4A Eastern Regional finals.[18] He was ultimately named a McDonald's All-American, first-team Parade All-American, and North Carolina's Mr. Basketball by The Charlotte Observer.[18]\n\nCollege career\n\nAs a freshman at Wake Forest University, Paul averaged 14.8 points, 5.9 assists, and 2.7 steals per game,[20] setting school freshman records for three-point percentage, free throws, free throw percentage, assists, and steals in the process.[18] Behind his play, the Demon Deacons qualified for the NCAA tournament, losing in the Sweet Sixteen to St. Joseph's.[21] At the end of the season, Paul was named ACC Rookie of the Year and Third Team All-ACC.[18]\n\nFor two weeks early in Paul's sophomore season, Wake Forest was ranked number one in the nation for the first time in school history.[22] On January 15, 2005, Paul registered 26 points and eight assists in a victory over rival North Carolina,[23] and on February 3, he scored 23 points in a victory over rival Duke.[24] In the final game of the year, Paul punched NC State guard Julius Hodge in the groin and received a one-game suspension from the ACC Tournament,[25] an incident that marred Paul's image for a short time.[22] The Demon Deacons again qualified for the NCAA tournament but suffered a second round upset at the hands of West Virginia.[26] With final averages of 15.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 2.4 steals per game, Paul was eventually named First Team Consensus All-America,[20] and with a 3.21 grade point average (GPA), he was also named to ESPN's Academic All-America Team.[27] On April 15, 2005, Paul announced he would be hiring an agent and turning professional.[22] On March 2, 2013, Wake Forest retired Paul's jersey.[28] In 2021, he was inducted into the Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame.[29]\n\nProfessional career\n\nNew Orleans Hornets (2005â€“2011)\n\nEarly seasons in New Orleans and Oklahoma City (2005â€“2007)\n\nPaul was selected as the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets.[30] Due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Hornets played most of their games in Oklahoma City during Paul's first two seasons with the team.[31] Paul finished his debut season leading all rookies in total points, assists, steals, and double-doubles, and became only the second rookie in NBA history to lead the league in total steals.[32] With final averages of 16.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 2.2 steals per game,[33] he was named NBA Rookie of the Year, falling just one vote shy of winning the award unanimously.[32] The only other rookie to receive a first place vote was Deron Williams, with whom Paul enjoyed a brief rivalry early in their careers.[34]\n\nAt the 2007 All-Star Weekend, Paul set new Rookie Challenge records with 17 assists and 9 steals.[35] For his sophomore season, he increased his scoring and passing averages to 17.3 points and 8.9 assists per game, but played in only 64 games due to injury.[33]\n\nRise to stardom (2007â€“2011)\n\nPaul was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game in 2007â€“08,[33] playing in front of his home fans in New Orleans.[36] Behind his leadership, the Hornets were near the top of the Western Conference standings all year, temporarily occupying first place on March 17 following a win against the Chicago Bulls.[37] New Orleans finished the season with a franchise-record 56 wins and the second seed in the West.[38][39] Paul led the NBA with 11.6 assists and 2.7 steals per game to go along with 21.1 points per game,[33] finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting and being named to his first All-NBA and All-Defensive teams.[33][40] In his playoff debut, he scored 35 points against the Dallas Mavericks.[41] In Game 2, he set a franchise playoff record with 17 assists.[42] The Hornets defeated the Mavericks in five games, with Paul registering 24 points, 11 rebounds, and 15 assists in the final game.[43] Their run came to an end in the next round, where they were eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs.[38]\n\nPrior to the start of the 2008â€“09 season, Paul signed a contract extension with the Hornets worth $68 million.[44] On December 17, 2008, he set the NBA record for consecutive games with a steal at 106.[45] On several occasions, he came within a few steals of recording a quadruple-double, including a 27-point, 10-rebound, 15-assist, and 7-steal game against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 26, 2009.[46] His final averages were 22.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 11 assists, and 2.8 steals per game.[33] Despite Paul's individual accomplishments, New Orleans' record fell from the year before and they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets.[47]\n\nAfter a slow start to the 2009â€“10 season, the Hornets fired coach Byron Scott.[48] Paul stirred up controversy when he announced his displeasure with the move, commenting that team management should have \"consulted with me and asked how I felt before it happened.\"[49] In early February 2010, Paul tore cartilage in his left knee and was sidelined for over a month by surgery, forcing him to miss the All-Star Game.[50] In total, he played in only 45 games and his averages dropped to 18.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 10.7 assists, and 2.1 steals per game.[33] Without Paul, the Hornets struggled, missing the playoffs.[51]\n\nIn 2010â€“11, Paul had another injury scare, suffering a concussion on March 6 after colliding with Cavaliers guard Ramon Sessions and being carried off the court on a stretcher.[52] He returned two games later, registering 33 points and 15 assists against the Sacramento Kings.[53] With the luxury of Paul playing a full season, the Hornets qualified for the playoffs and were matched up with the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the first round.[54] In Game 1, Paul contributed 33 points, 14 assists, and 4 steals,[55] and in Game 4, he registered 27 points, 13 rebounds, and 15 assists.[56] In response to Paul's performances, Lakers beat writer Dave McMenamin declared that Paul was having a \"historically great series\".[57] Nevertheless, New Orleans were eliminated in six games,[54] and ownership, fearing that Paul would leave the franchise via free agency, began actively pursuing a trade that would provide the team equitable compensation in return for his services.[58]\n\nLos Angeles Clippers (2011â€“2017)\n\nFailed Lakers trade and \"Lob City\" rise (2011â€“2012)\n\nOn December 8, 2011, the Hornets agreed to a three-team trade sending Paul to the Lakers. The NBA, who owned the Hornets at the time, nullified the deal because commissioner David Stern claimed that New Orleans would be better off by keeping Paul.[59] The teams involved in the transaction attempted to lobby the league to reverse its ruling and reconstruct the deal to no avail.[60][61] On December 12, the Hornets agreed to a trade sending Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers, but the deal broke down after the NBA added additional demands to the original terms.[62] Two days later, the teams finally completed the trade, sending Paul and two future second-round draft picks to the Clippers in return for Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the Minnesota Timberwolves' unprotected first round pick in the 2012 draft, which was used to draft Austin Rivers.[63] Upon the deal's completion, Paul announced that he would opt into the final year of his contract and remain in Los Angeles for at least two more seasons.[64]\n\nPaul's arrival to Los Angeles rejuvenated the Clippers franchise, with teammate Blake Griffin later commenting, \"It put us on the map.\"[65] Early in Paul's debut season, the team developed a reputation for their fast-paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks,[66] usually from Paul to Griffin or DeAndre Jordan,[67] earning them the nickname \"Lob City\".[68] Paul finished the year averaging 19.8 points, 9.1 assists, and 2.5 steals per game,[33] becoming the first Clipper to be named to the All-NBA First Team since the franchise moved to Los Angeles in the 1980s.[69] Behind his play and the emergence of Griffin as an All-NBA performer, Los Angeles qualified for the playoffs, losing to the San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals.[70]\n\nPlayoff upsets (2012â€“2015)\n\nAt the 2013 All-Star Game, Paul led the West to victory with a 20-point and 15 assist performance, earning his first NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award.[71] He finished the season averaging 16.9 points, 9.7 assists, and 2.4 steals per game, helping the Clippers to a franchise-record 56 wins.[33][72] Seeded fourth in the West entering the playoffs, Los Angeles were defeated in the first round by the Memphis Grizzlies.[73] Shortly after their early postseason exit, the Clippers announced they would not renew coach Vinny Del Negro's contract and rumors arose of Paul forcing Del Negro out. Los Angeles later denied any player involvement in the coaching decision.[74]\n\nPrior to the start of the 2013â€“14 season, Paul re-signed with the Clippers for five years on a contract worth approximately $107 million.[75] Despite a shoulder injury that sidelined him for over a month,[76] Los Angeles set another new franchise record for wins with 57.[77] His final averages were 19.1 points, 10.7 assists, and 2.5 steals per game.[33] In Game 1 of the second round of the playoffs, he hit a career postseason-high eight three-pointers to help the Clippers take an early series lead over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[78] In Game 5 and with the series tied 2â€“2, he made a string of late mistakes leading to an eventual Thunder victory, later commenting, \"It's me ... Everything that happened at the end is on me.\"[79] Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Los Angeles in six games.[80]\n\nIn 2014â€“15, Paul played in all 82 games for the first time in his career, averaging 19.1 points and a league-high 10.2 assists per game.[81] In Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs, he hit a go-ahead shot with a second left to lift the Clippers over the Spurs despite a hamstring injury.[82] The injury forced him to miss the first two games of the next series versus the Houston Rockets, and Los Angeles eventually lost in seven games despite holding a 3â€“1 series lead.[83] The defeat marked ten consecutive seasons and seven consecutive playoff appearances without an NBA Conference Finals appearance for Paul.[84]\n\nFinal years with Clippers (2015â€“2017)\n\nIn January of the 2015â€“16 season, Paul led the Clippers on a ten-game winning streak despite missing Griffin and Jordan at various points due to injury.[85] For the third straight year, he finished the season with averages of over 19 points, 10 assists, and 2 steals per game.[33] To begin the postseason, the Clippers drew a matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers, taking a 2â€“1 lead to start the series. In Game 4, Paul broke his hand and was ruled out indefinitely.[86] Without Paul, as well as Griffin, who also injured himself in Game 4, Los Angeles eventually lost the series in six games.[87]\n\nIn 2016â€“17, Paul missed 21 regular season games due to rest or injury, and averaged 18.1 points, 9.2 assists, and 5 rebounds in just over 31 minutes per game.[33] At season's end, Paul was not rewarded with an All-NBA honor, marking just the second time he failed to make an All-NBA team since 2008 and the first time in his six years as a Clipper.[88] In the playoffs, Los Angeles was eliminated after their first round series against the Utah Jazz, with Paul averaging 25.3 points, 9.9 assists, 5 rebounds per game over seven games.[88]\n\nHouston Rockets (2017â€“2019)\n\nFirst Conference Finals appearance (2017â€“2018)\n\nOn June 28, 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations.[89] The Clippers ultimately decided to trade Paul because they were unwilling to offer him the contract extension that he was seeking and they did not want to lose him for nothing once he became a free agent. Paul, who was interested in playing alongside superstar guard James Harden, opted into the final year of his existing contract to facilitate the trade.[90] Some analysts were initially skeptical of the trade due to the perceived redundancy of Paul and Harden's playing ball-dominating playing styles, leading to questions over how they would adjust to each other.[91]\n\nOn October 17, Paul debuted for the Rockets in their season-opening win over the defending champion Golden State Warriors.[92] He scored only four points on 2-for-9 shooting and sat on the bench down the stretch while the Rockets made their final push.[93] It was later revealed that he was playing through a knee injury, and he subsequently missed the next 14 games, returning to the lineup on November 16 against the Phoenix Suns.[94] With Paul healthy, Houston quickly established themselves as a championship contender, boasting the league's top-ranked offense in addition to a top-ten defense. Their success was primarily driven by Paul and Harden, who assumed playmaking duties while role players such as Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, and P. J. Tucker provided floor spacing with three-point shooting.[95] On December 15, Paul registered 28 points, eight assists, and seven steals against the Spurs to lead the Rockets to their 12th straight victory.[96] On January 26, 2018, he scored a season-high 38 points in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.[97] The Rockets eventually finished the 2017â€“18 season with a franchise-record 65 wins and the best record in the NBA, which included Harden winning the MVP Award and the team setting a league record for three-point attempts.[98] Paul's final averages were 18.6 points, 7.9 assists, and 1.7 steals per game.[33]\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Houston eliminated the Minnesota Timberwolves, earning them a matchup with the Utah Jazz in the second round.[99] In Game 5 of the series, Paul scored a career playoff-high 41 points along with eight three-pointers, 10 assists, and seven rebounds en route to a series-clinching victory over the Jazz. With the win, Paul advanced to the NBA Conference Finals for the first time in his career,[100] where the Warriors awaited. Going into Game 5, the series was tied 2â€“2 before Paul helped lead Houston to victory by scoring seven fourth quarter points that powered a 10â€“5 run and gave the Rockets a lead that they never relinquished.[101] However, Paul injured his hamstring late in the game, and with him out for the remainder of the series, Houston was eliminated from the postseason with back-to-back losses.[102]\n\nUneventful season (2018â€“2019)\n\nOn July 8, Paul signed a four-year, $160 million maximum contract extension with the Rockets.[103] On October 20, shortly after the start of the 2018â€“19 season, he was involved in an on-court altercation with Rajon Rondo of the Lakers, which resulted in a two-game suspension and a fine.[104] On December 20, he suffered a left hamstring strain against the Miami Heat,[105] which caused him to miss 17 consecutive games.[106] On February 23, he recorded 23 points and a season-high 17 assists in a win over the Warriors.[107] Late in the season, Paul found himself in the midst of a slump and Houston dropped down to the third seed in the conference, which prompted some analysts to wonder if Paul had moved into a new, less effective phase of his career.[108] In the conference semifinals, the Rockets again found themselves matched up with Golden State, but could not close out the series despite the Warriors' primary scorer, Kevin Durant, missing the final two games.[109]\n\nOklahoma City Thunder (2019â€“2020)\n\nOn July 16, 2019, the Rockets traded Paul, two protected first-round draft picks, and two first-round pick swaps to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Russell Westbrook.[110] For the first time in years, Paul found himself on a young, rebuilding team without championship aspirations. Despite speculation that the Thunder would try to move on from Paul immediately, he embraced his role as a veteran leader of the team, which earned him praise from coach Billy Donovan.[111] Paul debuted for Oklahoma City in a loss to the Utah Jazz on October 23, registering 22 points and 8 rebounds in 30 minutes of play.[112] On January 30, he was selected to his 10th All-Star nod, and first since 2016, being named a Western Conference reserve.[113] On February 11, Paul scored a season-high 31 points in a loss to the San Antonio Spurs.[114]\n\nFollowing a break in the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Thunder eventually finished as the fifth seed in the conference, earning them a matchup with Paul's old team, the Houston Rockets, in the first round of the playoffs.[115] Trailing 3â€“2 going into Game 6, Paul scored 15 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter to lead Oklahoma City to a series-tying victory.[116] Although the Thunder would ultimately lose Game 7 and be eliminated from the postseason, Sports Illustrated deemed Paul's tenure with the team a success and opined that he had reestablished himself as one of the best point guards in the NBA.[117]\n\nPhoenix Suns (2020â€“2023)\n\nFirst Finals appearance (2020â€“2021)\n\nOn November 16, 2020, the Thunder traded Paul and Abdel Nader to the Phoenix Suns for Kelly Oubre Jr., Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque, and a 2022 protected first round pick.[118] On February 1, 2021, Paul dropped a season-high 34 points, along with nine rebounds and nine assists, in a close 109â€“108 win over the Dallas Mavericks.[119] On February 19, he put up a season-high 19 assists while also scoring 15 points in a 132â€“114 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.[120] On February 23, Paul was selected to his 11th All-Star appearance, second in a row, as a Western Conference reserve.[121] With Devin Booker being named a replacement All-Star a day later, Paul and Booker were the first Suns duo since Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire in 2010 to be named All-Stars.[122] On March 21, Paul logged his first triple-double of the season with 11 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a 111â€“94 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, becoming the sixth player in NBA history to record 10,000 career assists.[123][124]\n\nIn Game 2 of the Conference Semifinals against the Denver Nuggets, Paul recorded 17 points, 15 assists, and 0 turnovers in a 123â€“98 victory.
