We realize that’s kind of ambiguous, but that’s how basketball is and that’s how we like it. Basically, though, we tried to list the 50 guys we think have the most value to their teams, right now, at this moment. This doesn’t mean they’ll never be traded, and it doesn’t mean they’re due tremendous contract extensions, but it does mean — since value is king in the NBA — that over the next month or so we’ll run down the 50 guys that we think are the 50 best players, right here, right now.\n\nBefore long it’ll be time for our annual NBA team previews. Right now it’s time for some law and order…\n\n48. Chris Kaman, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nBy Sam Rubenstein\n\nIt’s becoming a guard and swingman’s league. The center position is on the endangered species list, and today’s dominant big men are explosively quick athletes with versatile games. Talents like Elton Brand."
