        "text": "Who was like the hardest person to guard in your career? DeMarcus Cousins: I came in the era where, when I entered, it was still two bigs in the post type, you know? So, like I said, I’m right on the cusp of the old-school ball to the new-school ball. I’ve kind of seen both sides of it, and man, there are so many talented guys. I mean, there are more guys that don’t even get the recognition. Now, [Al] Jefferson, Chris Kaman, and Marc Gasol, players of that nature, didn’t have the opportunity to play against guys like Zion [Williamson] and things like that. But I would say, for me, Anthony Davis has always been a guy that I’ve been a huge fan of, you know, his younger days in New Orleans, and we had a lot of battles. Anthony Davis is a guy that doesn’t always get respect from media. Blake Griffin in his days was a special, special player. So, I enjoyed the battles against him. Z-Bo [Zach Randolph], one of my favorites. I took a lot from his game. Like I said earlier, I wasn’t the most athletic guy. So, just learning how to use your body and create angles, and you know, make the game easy.\n\nAs he prepared to head to Springfield, Mass., for Wade’s induction, Riley reflected on landing Wade with the No. 5 pick in 2003. “We were very fortunate to get him,” he understated. “And it would have been a dilemma if Toronto would have taken him fourth. We would have taken Chris fifth. As a matter of fact, we needed a big that year and Chris got picked and then we took Dwyane. Everybody said I was going to take Kaman, but that’s not true. That was just something we put out there in the media.”\n\nFormer NBA center Chris Kaman walked into the Man Cave Sports Cards and Collectibles in Stanton a few months ago, looking for cards. Then, according to Man Cave founder Nate Smith, a friendship began to develop between them. In September, Smith worked to bring Kaman on as a partner and is now helping the business expand. Earlier this month, the Man Cave opened its second location, 701 S. Greenville Drive in Greenville, that joined the first store and thriving eBay business as the sports card and memorabilia industry continues to boom across the country.\n\nWhen asked about his “Welcome to the NBA moment” in the Knuckleheads podcast with Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson, the former Bulls center had this to say about (via the Knuckleheads, clip from u/whenmachinescry on Reddit): “It was a guy I haven’t even heard of, it was the Clippers… I had to guard Chris Kaman. I don’t even know who Chris Kaman is, this gon’ be easy… Left, right, on the block, it was crazy, he was talking s— too. I ain’t even heard of this guy and he’s getting buckets. I was like, ‘Tomorrow, Yao Ming, the night after that, Shaq.’ I’m like this s— doesn’t stop.”\n\nAt first, Kaman wasn’t a fan of the bitter taste of straight black coffee. But when DiFrancesco and Dr. Cate Shanahan, then the team’s nutritionist, suggested he cut it with organic, full-fat milk or grass-fed butter, Kaman was hooked — not only on the taste, but also on the improvements in focus and concentration. “I thought it gives more of a good, even energy source than when you take some of the high-sugar, high-carbohydrate drinks,” Kaman says, “[which] really just gives you spikes.”"
