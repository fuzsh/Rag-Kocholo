        "text": "MILWAUKEE >> The Lakers’ pregame warmups already finished, and Chris Kaman still had not arrived.\n\nKaman did not travel with the Lakers on Wednesday because of what the team termed “personal” reasons. So he took a commercial flight on Thursday to Milwaukee and arrived to the game only minutes before tipoff.\n\nKaman still posted 13 points on 6-of-12 shooting in the Lakers’ 108-105 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks at BMO Harris Bradley Center. He started for the second consecutive game while Pau Gasol expereiences symptoms from vertigo.\n\n“I was shocked he played,” Lakers forward Nick Young said. “I thought we would see him (today) in Minnesota, but he showed he was a good teammate.”\n\nLakers coach Mike D’Antoni hardly offered much praise.\n\n“He had a long day,” D’Antoni said. “I’m sure he was a little tired.”\n\nKaman, who left the locker room without speaking with reporters, has played in only 36 of the Lakers’ 71 games this season. D’Antoni has shown preference for stretch forwards and has said both Jordan Hill and Robert Sacre play better defensively than Kaman. But he has still averaged 10 points and 5.7 rebounds.\n\n“It was amazing. He had some family problems at home and wanted to take care of that first,” Hill said. “But he rushed to get out on that plane and tried to help us get a win. Not everything is going well for him this season, but he’s still triyng to stay a pro.”\n\nChange the subject\n\nD’Antoni downplayed an ESPN report that Marshall reached out to him to assess his interest in coaching his alma mater.\n\n“I hear from them all the time,” D’Antoni said. “Whatever they need, I try to do. But who knows. Come on guys.”\n\nThe Lakers do not plan to evaluate D’Antoni until after the season ends. He has two years left on his contract worth $8 million, although only next season is guaranteed. The Lakers have a team option on his last year.\n\nInjury update\n\nLakers guard Steve Nash sat out against Milwaukee and ruled himself out tonight against Minnesota because of nerve irritation in his back. He believes he will return next week.\n\nLakers guard Jordan Farmar said he will get reevaluated sometime this weekend after missing the past seven games because of a strained right groin. Should he receive medical clearance to practice, Farmar believes he will return at the end of next week.\n\nMemory lane\n\nD’Antoni rehashed another injury report, but this one did not involve his decimated roster.\n\nInstead, he reflected on the first time he played in Milwaukee on Nov. 10, 1973 with the Kansas City-Omaha Kings.\n\n“It was the first time I ever started and Oscar Robertson broke my hand,” D’Antoni said. “I broke my hand and had to go to the hospital in my warmups. It wasn’t good.”\n\nD’Antoni sat out until Dec. 26, 1973 in what marked his rookie season. But despite reporters showing interest in this revelation, D’Antoni laughed and declined to provide more details.\n\n“You have plenty to talk about,” D’Antoni said in mock disgust."
