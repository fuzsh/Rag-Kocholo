        "text": "2. Josh Smith, F, Hawks. Again, I know what the Hawks are saying. “We’re not shopping anyone … yada, yada, yada.” The truth is, Rick Sund has been exploring possible Josh Smith deals for the past few years. If he could get a legit point guard and a credible forward to replace Smith, he’d do it. If the Celtics would offer Rondo, I think they’d have a deal. Ditto if the Suns would offer Steve Nash. 3. Chris Kaman, C, Hornets. It’s no secret that Kaman is on the block. Given that the Hornets really don’t want much in return, I’m surprised he hasn’t found a home already. The Warriors, Rockets and Heat have shown a lot of interest. And with Jeff Foster still out in Indy, Kaman could be a great fit with the Pacers as well. He has no long-term future in New Orleans. This one is a no-brainer.\n\nDon’t go trading Chris Kaman and Eric Gordon out of New Orleans just yet. While there has been rampant speculation that not only would Chris Kaman be traded from the New Orleans Hornets, but that the jewel of the Chris Paul trade Eric Gordon could be had to if the price was right too.\n\nDespite being the center of trade rumors, Hornets Coach Monty Williams said Kaman has handled the situation as well as can be expected under the circumstances. “With the situation that he was dealing with, none of us asked for it,’’ Williams said. “It was a situation that we had to handle. I think he’s done a decent job of that. “As far I’m concerned, I plan every day like he’s going to be here for the rest of the season. Until that changes, if it changes, that’s something I ‘m not worried about. I can’t be worried about the trade deadline, that’s for the agents and GMs. The focus for Chris has always been basketball. He has proven that he can be professional and a adequate piece to the team and may job is to coach him.’’\n\nKaman was deactivated in January when they sought to trade him, and held him out for six games, before taking him off the trade market Feb. 3 when they couldn’t find a trade offer they liked. “I dont care what they do,’’ Kaman said. “So if they want to trade me, trade me. If they want to keep me, keep me. I don’t care, but not in a disrespectful way. I just know I can’t control that part of it, so it something I don’t care about. “That’s something for my agent to deal with, and I don’t think coach cares about it. I think he’s trying to focus on winning games, and my teammates are doing the same.’’\n\n“I just told my agent, ‘I’m just going to play and see what happens,’ ’’ Kaman said. “I can’t say move me now, or say don’t move me now. It has to be done by somebody else. It’s out of my control. “I’ve been through this business for nine years, I’ve seen people come and go. I just can’t think about it. If I think about it, it ruins what I’m trying to do here. I’m just trying to win, and I want to help this team. I don’t want to be at the bottom and the laughing stock of the league. We haven’t had the season we wanted because of the injuries.’’"
