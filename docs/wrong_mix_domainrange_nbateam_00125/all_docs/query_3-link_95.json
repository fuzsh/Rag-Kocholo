        "text": "BEIJING — When Chris Kaman, the American NBA player, joined the German national squad, he knew he’d instantly be the team’s center. But the team’s herrenfriseur, too?\n\nSuch was the case in the days leading up to these Olympic Games, when Kaman became the unofficial team barber. He shaved the Olympic rings logo into three teammates’ haircuts, notably Dirk Nowitzki, who showcaseed his new hair-do in Germany’s first game, Sunday’s win against Angola.\n\nThe fun-loving Clippers’ big man (The Big Herrenfriseur?) has been a welcome addition to the German team. Of course, he isn’t German.\n\nThe only time he has been to Germany was at an airport layover. But his great-grandparents were from Germany, so that lineage got the Michigan native on the German team. Now he and Nowitizki will try to rattle the power structure here in China, where the America, Spain, Greece and Argentina are the powers.\n\n“This is something I wanted to do for me and myself,” Kaman said. “I’m always doing stuff for other people.”\n\nA lot of other people didn’t want him to do it. The Clippers, Kaman said, were against their big banger banging more than necessary.\n\n“The Clippers made it very difficult for me to get over here with the insurance and them not wanting me to go,” he said. “I was a little disappointed with them, at the time, with the way they handled stuff. They lied to me a couple times, and I didn’t appreciate it. But it worked out in the end. … There was a lot of stuff in the end I had to fight about. And I hope the Clippers are proud of what I accomplished. We’ll see.”\n\nAsked what they lied to him about, Kaman said: “I don’t want to go into that. I don’t want to throw the Clippers under the bus. Things I wouldn’t do personally to someone. They should trust me by now. I’ve been playing basketball for them for five years, and I’ve always come in in shape.”\n\nEven in his own family, Kaman faced dissention. While his mother was supportive of his decison, his father questioned the decision. LeRoy Kaman kept telling his son that they were American citizens, so why would they play for a nation that wasn’t America? Yet it was LeRoy’s grandparents who were born in Germany and were immigrants in America. But Chris Kaman had to “get in his face a little bit” to have his dad buy into the decision.\n\n“He was not so thrilled,” Kaman said.\n\nWhen Kaman returns to the Clippers, there will be quite a few new faces. The team acquired former all-star Baron Davis, drafted guard Eric Gordon and also acquired Ricky Davis and Jason Williams. And, as Denver fans are well aware, the Clippers snatched Nuggets center Marcus Camby for a $10 million trade exception, which the Nuggets can use in a future acquisition. Camby and Kaman should be an intimidating tadem.\n\n“I’m excited, he’s one of the great defensive players in the NBA,” Kaman said. “I know him from playing against him so many time. I didn’t understand what the Nuggets were doing. A great value. I think me and him will be a great defensive combination.”\n\nBut right now, the Clipper is a German, focus on being a star center – and, well, clipper."
