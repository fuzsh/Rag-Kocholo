        "text": "Chris Kaman, Andre Drummond\n\nPortland Trail Blazers center Chris Kaman has adjusted to a new role so far this season.\n\n(AP file)\n\nChris Kaman isn't playing much this season, which is hard to imagine for anyone in Michigan who recalls the big man dominating at Tri-Unity Christian High School in Wyoming and then at Central Michigan.\n\nThat was years ago, but Kaman continued the same path through 12 previous seasons in the NBA, playing in the 2010 all-star game, signing a couple jumbo contracts and entertaining most everyone along the way with his quirky, honest 7-foot personality.\n\nRELATED: (from June) Kaman wants to be part of something special\n\nBut this season is different for the 33-year-old center who lives in Greenville in the offseason. He has appeared in just four of the first 38 games for the Portland Trail Blazers, What's interesting about that is Kaman is dealing with it all fairly well.\n\nHe has turned into a mentor on a very young team and enjoying a new role - for as long as he's with the Trail Blazers.\n\n\"That's probably one of the hardest parts about the situation,'' Kaman told writer Jason Quick in a feature story on Comcast SportsNet Northwest. \"It's very humbling, coming from where I came from and doing what I'm doing now and knowing I can still play. But I'm OK with it. I really am.''\n\nThe story details Kaman's tight relationship with younger teammates, conversations with Neil Olshey, the Blazers' president of basketball operations, and the real possibility that Kaman could be dealt if the right opportunity arises.\n\n\"I think about it,'' Kaman said. \"I know it's a high possibility. If he gets a good opportunity for the team, I get traded.''\n\nOne other notable passage in the story: Kaman recently brought gifts for teammates, including a knife for Noah Vonleh, a 20-year-old rookie power forward who is getting a lot of minutes. Kaman added an engraving on the handle to include the Blazers logo along with Vonleh's name and uniform number.\n\nKaman's reaction?\n\nKaman played in 74 games for Portland last season and has averaged 11.3 points and 7.7 rebounds in more than 700 career games with five teams.\n\nThe trade deadline is Feb. 18."
