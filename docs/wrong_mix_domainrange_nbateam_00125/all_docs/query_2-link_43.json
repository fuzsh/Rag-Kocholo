        "text": "BY WENDELL MAXEY | The Grand Rapids Press\n\nBAMBERG, Germany -- Long after the deafening drum line that stood behind the home basket stopped banging, noisemakers fell silent, and the faithful German basketball fans slowly left Stechert Arena, Chris Kaman was the last player for the German National Team left on the court signing autographs and posing for photos.\n\nYou’d think with all the love shown in Deutschland that Kaman was back at Tri-unity Christian, Central Michigan University or even the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n\nInstead, Kaman and his German citizenship card are roughly 4,300 miles away from Grand Rapids in a country where his great-grandfather, Herman Kaman (originally spelled \"Kamen\"), now makes it possible for the 7-foot center to represent one side of his family’s heritage on the hardwood.\n\nOnce again, Kaman is preparing to represent the German National Team, this time at EuroBasket 2011 in Lithuania between Aug. 31-Sept. 18.\n\n\"I love that everywhere you look there is history. This city we are at right now is over a 1,000 years old,\" said Kaman, about an hour after Germany fell to Greece as part of a four-team EuroBasket primer known as SuperCup that also featured national teams from Turkey and Belgium.\n\n\"You’re talking about the streets that we drive on are older than our own country back home.\"\n\nFrom history to hoops, it’s been four years since Kaman received dual citizenship from Germany and played alongside Dallas Mavericks and German superstar Dirk Nowitzki at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. Believe it or not, that experience almost didn’t happen.\n\n\"I had a nightmare of a time tracking my family history. I went on to Ancestry.com and made a family tree, and then obtained a census report. It was a long process, but when I came to Germany the first time and I let the German officials deal with it,\" Kaman said.\n\n\"I didn’t think my paperwork was going to go through, but at the last minute, they made an executive decision about my citizenship. I literally got it five days before I was supposed to leave for China. I didn’t think I was going to get it and was getting so mad. I didn’t even want to mess with it anymore.\"\n\nThe experience in Beijing was exciting and exhausting.\n\n\"By the time we got to China I was so tired from being gone a month-and-a-half. I was ready to be done, but we got absolutely blasted by teams,\" recalled Kaman, with the toughest blow coming against Team USA, a 106-57 loss.\n\nKaman hopes this time will be different.\n\nGone are the Rosetta Stone language CD’s he bought to teach himself German. Both his head coach Dirk Bauermann and teammates speak fluent English.\n\n\"I knew he was a good player, but I didn’t know how funny he was and what a great person he was to be around,\" Bauermann said of Kaman.\n\n\"He’s really helped our team in that way -- to be loose and go about our work at the same time -- and he is a joy to be around. He’s become part of our family.\"\n\nGone is the lingering left ankle injury that caused Kaman to miss the majority of the 2010-2011 NBA season as the Clippers finished 30-52. Limited to 32 games, he averaged 12.4 points and 7 rebounds per game.\n\nStill, Kaman slowly is shaking off the rust after not playing competitive basketball since his NBA season ended. In the recent three-game series against Belgium, Greece and Turkey, Kaman averaged 15 points and 8 rebounds per game.\n\nTwo questions continue to chase Kaman -- the NBA lockout and bevy of trade rumors.\n\n\"The owners are strict on what they want and I don’t know how it’s going to get resolved to be honest. I don’t see a bright future for the situation at this point,\" Kaman said, who toils with the notion of playing overseas -- perhaps even in Germany -- if the NBA season is canceled.\n\n\"They (team owners) are trying to hold us out longer so we have to give in to what they want and that is not right. They need to come with a fair deal just like we have to come with a fair deal.\"\n\nKaman, who will be an unrestricted free agent in 2012, knows his future in L.A. may be out of his control.\n\n\"This game is a business and it can be ruthless. There are so many possibilities. It’s crazy,\" he said. \"Life can change like that. I’d hate to be moved during the season. That would be tough having to move and play and worry about my wife.\"\n\nWith SuperCup behind him in Bamberg, the German National Team travels to Bremen in northwestern Germany to take on the Bosnian and Herzegovinian National Team. After that, Kaman is looking forward to a day off from basketball and a chance to explore the 19th century Neuschwanstein Castle outside of Munich.\n\n\"I’m fascinated by history,\" said Kaman, before walking over and signing one last autograph for a fan. \"To me it’s just amazing.\""
