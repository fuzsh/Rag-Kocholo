        "text": "Chris Kaman wondered what it would be like to be part of the Olympic Games.\n\nHe never thought it might mean being called a traitor when Germany and its greatest player -- NBA star Dirk Nowitzki-- came looking for help.\n\n\"I thought it was about the basketball,\" he said. \"I would have played for my country if my country needed me.\n\n\"It was sort of a joke at first, then Dirk talked to me about my family being from Germany, a German federation guy got involved and it turned into this -- I'm going to the Olympics.\"Kaman, a 26-year-old Wyoming native from Tri-unity Christian High School, starred at Central Michigan and enters his sixth NBA season with the Los Angeles Clippers. He is a member of the German national team.\n\nThat team, with his contributions, won a recent Olympic qualifying tournament in Greece and left Germany Saturday for the Games in Beijing, China. Basketball competition starts Aug. 10.\n\nKaman, declared a German citizen and presented with a passport per the request of its Olympic federation, doesn't speak German and had never visited the country until this experience. He also never met his German-born great-grandparents, who passed away long ago.\n\nKaman said he never gave much thought to being of German descent. He never dreamed his ancestry might make the Olympic dream come true.\n\n\"I look at this as a great opportunity to live a dream,\" he said. \"I play basketball, and I'm getting this chance to be part of the Olympics. It's about the basketball for me, not politics, not anything else. I was going to play basketball this summer, and this seems like a great way to do it.\n\n\"People calling me traitor on the radio and stuff, I don't understand that. It's basketball. I love my country.\"\n\nPamela Kaman, his mother, and Leroy, his father, are dismayed that their son has been called names. To them he's a son, a Christian, a basketball player, a role model and an American.\n\n\"It's scary that people get so carried away with politics when it's supposed to be about the sports,\" Pamela said. \"This isn't war.\"\n\nThe Clippers, who are not commenting on the subject, didn't want him to go. Management asked him to reconsider, but Kaman said eventually signed off on him being insured by the German team through the International Basketball Federation.\n\nKaman missed 26 NBA games last year with back troubles and a sprained ankle late in the season. He set career highs in points (15.7 per game) and rebounds (12.7 per game).\n\n\"They were concerned about my ankle, about getting injured,\" he said. \"I understand that, but I could get hurt in the summer league, or just about doing anything.\"\n\nNowitzki is the only German-born player in the NBA, and Kaman said he has talked in recent days with the Dallas Mavericks star about waiting through 12 years of play with the German team to make the Olympics.\n\n\"It's very emotional for him,\" Kaman said. \"After that last game in Greece he sat on the floor just crying. He thanked me for helping.\n\n\"I mean, I felt great for him. He has been trying to do this for 12 years, and I had been there for 12 days. It means so much to him.\"\n\nKaman's mother went to the qualifying tournament in Greece with her daughter. She said German census records were used for verification of ancestry.\n\nThe Olympic Charter's Rule 42 declares team members must be \"a national\" of the country. International Olympic Committee media representatives said individual nations decide citizenship.\n\nKaman said he was asked by USA basketball to be a practice player, but that was after he had committed to going through the process with the German team.\n\n\"I gave my word to Dirk, to the German officials,\" he said. \"And I knew I wouldn't be going to the Olympics with the U.S. team.\"\n\nAs for the basketball part of it, Germany could meet Team USA. Kaman said he would play just as if it was the Clippers against the Pistons.\n\n\"I would do my best to help my team win because it's basketball, and that's what you do,\" he said.\n\nKaman struggled the first few days with the German team to learn a large number of new plays, but all of his teammates speak English.\n\n\"A couple of the games have been strange, especially with the officials calling things and the ball being slippery, but you live and you learn,\" he said. \"A pick-and-roll is still a pick-and-roll, and a post-up is still a post-up.\n\n\"Besides on this team, you can go to Dirk. He's one of the best players in the world, and he's just been unstoppable.\"\n\nKaman has been most surprised by the team chemistry.\n\n\"It reminds me of playing at Central Michigan--where everybody was like a family, and you hung out and stuff,\" he said\n\nAs for the Clippers, Kaman is aware the team has changed dramatically in a free-agent whirlwind that includes the loss of Elton Brand and the addition of six new players, including Baron Davis and Marcus Camby. Kaman is entering the third year of a five-year contract extension worth $52 million.\n\n\"I'm not worrying about it now because I can't control it,\" he said. \"It sounds like we will have different guys. I know I just want to win. I hope we have guys who want to win. That's what basketball should be about.\"\n\nKaman has arranged for flights and lodging for some family members in Beijing. He also invited Tim Royer and Brad Oostindie of Hope 139, the Grandville company that helped him in the last year with his well-chronicled and alleged attention deficit problems.\n\n\"He asked me to bring my equipment, too,\" Royer said. \"He wants to show some of the other athletes what it is because he is telling them what it has done for him.\"\n\nKaman's mother said her son is blessed to be part of the Olympics.\n\n\"That's what we believe, and we find comfort in that even when we hear the criticism,\" she said. \"We believe it will be a great experience.\""
