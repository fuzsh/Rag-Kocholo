The Los Angeles Lakers agreed to a one-year deal with free agent center Chris Kaman, multiple media outlets reported.

It was not immediately known how much money the contract is worth.

The Lakers centered on Kaman after losing out on free agent Dwight Howard, who signed with the Houston Rockets last week. The deal for Kaman will not impact the Lakers salary cap space for 2014.

Kaman, 31, struggled with injuries last season with Dallas Mavericks. He averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds in 66 games.

---The Golden State Warriors are involved in a three-team, sign-and-trade deal that sends a trade exception and Utah Jazz free agent guard Randy Foye to the Denver Nuggets, according to Yahoo! Sports.

Denver will sign-and-trade forward Andre Iguodala to Golden State for the four-year, $48 million contract he agreed to sign with the Warriors. This creates a $12 million trade exception for the Nuggets, which they have a year to use before it expires.

Utah will sign-and-trade Foye to the Nuggets on a three-year, $9 million deal, with a team option on the third year.

---The Cleveland Cavaliers are interested in giving free agent center Andrew Bynum a generous one-year contract, ESPN reported Monday.

---Point guard Chris Paul said he is glad to be with the Los Angeles Clippers.

"I'm excited," Paul told ESPN Los Angeles on Sunday night. "I'm excited about everything that's going on with the team. I talked to my wife about it because I told her it was going to be a family decision. We even let (son) 'Little Chris' chime in on it. It's pretty cool to know where you're going to be and to know you're somewhere where you're wanted. The fans have been amazing. I told my wife I felt like a rookie all over again just because I'm excited about the unexpected."

Paul was quick to re-sign with the team for five years and $107 million when he became a free agent a week ago.
