        "text": "I wasnt sure if this belonged in the Forgoten Disney thread or not I just saw the 1973 Robin Hood and quite enjoyed it\n\nRobin Hood (1973): 3.5/5\n\nNot Disney's best IMO but not bad at all, though some of the animal characters are a rip off from The Jungle Book. The Little John character is the real star IMO next to Robin, and is basically Baloo the bear (incidentally also voiced by Phil Harris) but a different colour. Prince John's lackey Sir Hiss (Terry-Thomas) is Kaa the snake, even mentioning he hypnotised someone at one point. Some sequences and backgrounds were apparently reused and there are some familiar actors (Peter Ustinov is perfect as John, and to me it sounded like John Feildler, the voice of Piglet in Winnie the Pooh, did one of the additional voices).\n\nThe songs are OK (especially the love theme, did this give someone ideas for The Lion King? A vixen has never looked this appealling), the Alan-A-Dale rooster character sounded a bit like Bob Dylan, and the opening tune \"Whistle Stop\" march recalled that bloody Hamster Dance from the 90's :mad::p\n\nI never got the feeling Robin was in any real danger, the film lacks the pathos and sadness of earlier Disneys."
