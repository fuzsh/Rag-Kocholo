        "text": "Wonga Phillip \"Phil\" Harris was an American actor, voice actor, comedian, singer-songwriter, and jazz musician. For Disney, he notably provided the voices of Baloo in The Jungle Book, Thomas O'Malley in The Aristocats, and Little John in Robin Hood. He also appeared in NBC Salutes the 25th Anniversary of the Wonderful World of Disney.\n\nHarris was born in Linton, Indiana, but grew up in Nashville, Tennessee and began his music career as a drummer in San Francisco. He would record for labels, such as Victor, Columbia, Decca, and Vocalion. It would not be until 1950 when Harris recorded a hit novelty song entitled \"The Thing\" that he would score a #1 hit on the charts, though his signature song was \"That's What I Like About the South\".\n\nDuring the 1930s, Harris began a radio career usually ranging from acting roles to music director, sometimes partnering with Jack Benny. He and his wife, Alice Faye, began co-hosting The Fitch Bandwagon, a comedy-variety program that would evolve into The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show. In 1933, he made a short film for RKO called So This Is Harris!, which won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. This would lead to other roles in various movies, such as Melody Cruise, I Love a Bandleader, The Wild Blue Yonder, The High and Mighty, and Good-bye, My Lady. His television credits included The Steve Allen Show, Kraft Music Hall, Burke's Law, F Troop, The Dean Martin Show, The Hollywood Palace, The American Sportsman, and The Bing Crosby Show.\n\nHarris returned to Disney to reprise his role of Baloo when the television series TaleSpin was being produced and recorded five episodes. However, executives felt that Harris had too big a voice difference from his portrayal of Baloo in the '60s. The role was then given to Ed Gilbert, and the episodes featuring Harris were recorded over. However, Harris did reprise the voice of Baloo for Walt Disney's World on Ice: Mickey's Magical Tales, which began touring around the same time.\n\nOutside of Disney, Harris also voiced Patou in Don Bluth's 1991 animated film Rock-a-Doodle, his last acting role before his retirement.\n\nHarris died of a heart attack at age 91 in his Rancho Mirage home in the night of August 11, 1995.\n\nRoles[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe was originally set to voice Orville in The Rescuers; however, the role went to Jim Jordan instead.[citation needed]\n\n[]\n\nPhil Harris on Wikipedia\n\nfr:Phil Harris pt-br:Phil Harris"
