        "text": "An oldie but goodie, and one that doesn’t come up very often: Vincent Price’s captivating work as Professor Ratigan is as sinister as it is charming thanks to his menacing tone. He can convey Ratigan’s arrogance and fury, aided by his depth and complexness. A true master in the arsenal of voice performers.\n\nPixar’s masterpiece “Monster’s Inc.” is anchored wonderfully by the chemistry of its two leads — John Goodman as the fluffy Sully and comedy master Billy Crystal as the uneven-tempered one-eyed Mike Wazowski. His clever and spot-on timing gives the film an emotional center, easily able to be accessed by both adults and children. Sitting as the fourth Pixar feature, it showed the company was here to stay for quite some time.\n\nAngela Lansbury’s take on the enchanting and nurturing Mrs. Potts in the best picture nominated “Beauty and the Beast” played more of a role in my upbringing than I’d like to admit.\n\nThe British actress captured the elegance of class within the staff of the spoiled and entitled Beast that is looking for love but more important, exudes the maternal affection that audiences latched onto.\n\nLeaving an indelible mark with her rendition of the film’s iconic title theme song, the three-time Oscar-nominated performer should have been recognized again with the game-changing animated feature.\n\nAmong the most underrated turns in one of Disney’s most underrated features, Eartha Kitt’s sassy and magnetic Yzma is downright extraordinary.\n\nThe elderly and untrustworthy advisor to Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade), takes such a hilarious approach to teaching audiences lessons regarding greed and patience, in addition to pulling levers and properly labeling your potions.\n\nA scene-stealer with brilliant comedic timing (the same goes for Patrick Warburton as the hilarious sidekick Kronk), her sharp and biting lines make Yzma a supreme antagonist in movie history.\n\nTom Hanks won back-to-back Oscars for “Philadelphia” (1993) and “Forrest Gump” (1994) the year before Pixar’s inaugural film “Toy Story” changed the animated game forever. You could make the argument for a three-peat with his iconic turn as the lovable cowboy Woody.\n\nInfusing his distinctive vocal beats that bring every essence of Woody’s endearing personality to life as he fights for the attention of his owner Andy when he acquires the new and cool Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen), Hanks can do no wrong.\n\nYou can cite his work on any of the following three sequels for inclusion on this list.\n\nCunning and treacherous, the evil Uncle Scar is brought to life by the perfect balance of malice and sophistication by Oscar winner Jeremy Irons (“Reversal of Fortune”).\n\nThe sinister charm and deeply engrained jealousy is felt with the vocal beat executed by Irons’ rich and velvety voice. It all explodes in the iconic villain number, “Be Prepared,” which showcases his vocal prowess, elevating Scar and Irons to legendary in the Disney canon.\n\nWhat cements “The Lion King” as a classic is how any author of this list could cite anyone else from the movie — such as James Earl Jones as Mufasa or Nathan Lane as Timon — and the same amount of people would still agree.\n\nUnder the Pixar label, the former television host and Emmy-winning Ellen DeGenres brings the forgetful but utterly lovable Dory to life in “Finding Nemo.”\n\nWith childlike naïveté and a contagious spirit, DeGeneres delivers unforgettable and timelessly quotable lines (“Just keep swimming”), contributing greatly to the film’s Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Her performance is among the most mentioned by awards enthusiasts as one that should have been nominated for an acting Oscar. In another multiverse, she’s the supporting actress winner of 2004.\n\nMaleficent was already named the top Disney villain of all time, so it would be foolish not to include the spectacular work of Eleanor Audley in the 1959 classic animated gem.\n\nTreacherous evil, a haunting tone, and an enigmatic aura eventually comes to a head when the evil witch transforms into a dragon. Audley is precise and invigorating with everything she brings to the iconic figure.\n\nThe villainous Ursula is iconic in the Disney echo chamber. With her deep and sultry tone, Pat Carroll’s commanding performance blends wickedness, devious charisma and humor. You can’t praise her without mentioning her interpretation of one of the best villain songs ever written, “Poor Unfortunate Souls.”\n\nA fan-favorite among Disney enthusiasts, Carroll brings impeccable timing and allure to the movie, which continues to captivate movie-goers.\n\nAcademy Award winner Robin Williams (“Good Will Hunting”) gives a masterclass performance as the whimsical wish-giving Genie of the Lamp. The extraordinary actor infused Genie with his signature wit, rapid-fire line delivery, and an endless range of voices and impressions.\n\nA talented performer that could seamlessly move between dramatic and comedic films throughout his varied career, Williams captivated audiences, earning a special award from the Golden Globes for his vocal work (I wish they, along with the Oscars, would have been in tune enough to nominate him for best supporting actor).\n\nWilliams’ contribution to “Aladdin” remains a testament to the enduring legacy of one of the greatest voice performances in animation history."
