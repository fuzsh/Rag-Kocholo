        "text": "Adapted from a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, The Aristocats was the first animated feature film made at Disney following Walt’s death and the 20th made by the company overall. As with so many of the Disney animations of the time, it’s very episodic in nature, which we’d come to expect and put up with by this stage. What was more surprising was how derivative it turned out to be.\n\nIn 1910 Paris, cat Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three kittens, Berlioz (Dean Clark), Marie (Liz English), and Toulouse (Gary Dubin) live with retired opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley, voicing one of Disney’s most realistically rendered human characters) and her butler Edgar Balthazar (Roddy Maude-Roxby). When Madam calls in her lawyer Georges Hautecourt (Charles Lane) to help write her will, Edgar overhears her leaving her huge fortune to the cats, only reverting to Edgar after their deaths. Enraged, Edgar sedates the cats using sleeping pills and takes them out into the countryside where he is ambushed by a pair of dogs, Napoleon (Pat Buttram) and Lafayette (George Lindsey). The cats are stranded and Edgar leaves behind incriminating evidence in the shape of his hat, sidecar, umbrella, shoes, and the basket he carried the cats in. The cats have to find their ways back to Paris, evading recapture by Edgar, and helped by their friends Roquefort the mouse (Sterling Holloway), who, in his deerstalker and cape, feels like a very early trial run for the main character in Basil the Great Mouse Detective (1986), and Frou-Frou the horse (Nancy Kulp). Their main ally though is the roguish alley cat Thomas O’Malley (Phil Harris), and his friends Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers) and his jazz band, who are instrumental in getting the family back to their rightful home.\n\nEven the most basic of plot outlines should make it clear that The Aristocats owes a debt to several earlier Disney films – Lady and the Tramp (animals in love) and One Hundred and One Dalmatians (city animals kidnapped, taken to a rural spot and befriended/rescued by cats, dogs and horses) being the obvious touchstones. It’s also remarkably similar to Abe Levitow’s 1962 animated feature Gay Purr-ee which also featured cats in Paris. We weren’t used to this sort of plot recycling from Disney at this point and it comes as something of a disappointment.\n\nAnd it’s not the only think that disappoints about the film. It looks… “odd”, not as lush as The Jungle Book (1967) and at times only marginally more sophisticated than a television animation of the period. Walt had been involved in the early stages of the film, suggesting that the planned two-part version for the Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color (1961-1969) television show be adapted into a feature version in 1966 (Tytle and McGowan had been charged with finding animal stories for the TV show as early as December 1961). But one can’t help feel that, with his passing in December 1966, something had gone awry with the finished product.\n\nWhere is works best is another collection of fine songs. Robert and Richard Sherman returned from Mary Poppins (1964) and The Jungle Book but the best songs in the film were written by others. There’s nothing here quite as catchy as The Jungle Book‘s I Wan’na Be Like You or The Bare Necessities, but Thomas O’Malley Cat (written by Terry Gilkyson) has a glorious hook and Ev’rybody Wants to Be a Cat (by Floyd Huddleston and Al Rinker) is a fine showcase for Crothers, Harris and Lester. The rest of the songs are OK, if unexceptional, but these two ditties are among the best to grace a Disney film.\n\nHarris in particular is great, though his performance is really just a version of his Baloo from The Jungle Book. Thomas is the best thing about the film and provides much of its charm. Also worthy of note are Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as twin geese Abigail and Amelia Gabble, the prissy, very English tourists (we could have done with a lot more of them and their drunken uncle Waldo (Bill Thompson) and the two dim-witted mutts, Napoleon and Lafayette, who seem to have inexplicably wandered into Belle Époque France from somewhere in the Southern States.\n\nAnachronisms like this abound (one of Scat’s crew is a late-60s style hippy, complete with love beads (voiced by English DJ Lord Tim Hudson) and jazz wouldn’t be popular in France until after World War I) but we can, perhaps, overlook all that. What’s harder to overlook is that, despite everything that’s going on, it’s really quite dull. Its episodic nature is pronounced than in other recent Disneys though it perks up considerably by the climax when Edgar finally gets his just desserts.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, such was the strength of the Disney name that The Aristocats was another box office hit for the company. Proving, perhaps, that even when they weren’t entirely up to snuff, the Disney animators were unsurpassed in giving the public of what they wanted. It might be, at best, a middling effort but even middling Disney has its moments, most of them in The Aristocats provided by its marvellous voice cast.\n\nIn 2005, Disneytoon Studios announced a sequel, featuring Duchess’ now grown-up daughter Marie, but when John Lasseter became Disney’s new chief creative officer, he cancelled all planned sequels and spin-offs. A television series spin-off, The Aristocats: The Animated Series, had been announced five years earlier but it too ended up cancelled before any work could be carried out. In January 2022, it was announced that The Aristocats would be joining the ranks of Disney animations being remade as a live-action."
