        "text": "Goshen — Compared with the hard fouls of his basketball career, Phil Harris says he suffered the most flagrant offense when seeking help for his back pain from Orange Regional Medical Center.\n\nIn a federal lawsuit, the 61-year-old former Texas Western hoops star claims he was assaulted by several hospital staffers without provocation at the Arden Hill campus emergency room in June.\n\n\"I'm totally outraged,\" said Harris. \"I had four guys on me. A guy put me in a choke hold and jumped on my back. They twisted my neck around and threw me to the floor.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-10, 325-pound Harris said the melee began when he tried to leave the hospital after waiting 45 minutes without seeing a doctor. He said the attack was racially motivated.\n\n\"Why did they do this to me?\" said Harris, who is recuperating at his Goshen home following recent back surgery. \"Would they have done that to the mayor of Goshen? They jumped on me because I am a big black guy.\"\n\nOrange Regional Medical Center would not confirm or deny Harris' allegations. When officials said they had not seen the lawsuit, the Record provided the hospital with a copy.\n\n\"Certainly, we take any allegations seriously,\" said ORMC spokesman Rob Lee after reviewing the complaint. \"But I can't get into specifics about patients because of confidentiality laws.\"\n\nHarris' account of the bizarre incident is detailed in papers filed in U.S. District Court. When he arrived at Arden Hill on June 1 for emergency treatment, Harris said he was taken to another room and searched for weapons with a security wand, then treated like a mental patient.\n\n\"A woman asked me if I was going to hurt somebody or hurt myself,\" he said. \"I started laughing at her. Why would I hurt somebody? I'm here because my back hurts.\"\n\nAfter waiting 45 minutes without being seen by a doctor, Harris said he tried to leave the hospital. But before he could leave, a staffer sounded an alarm, triggering the alleged melee, he said. According to Harris, the assault aggravated his existing back and knee injuries. His eyeglasses and watch were shattered in the fall, along with his pride.\n\nHarris was part of a Texas Western Universtiy team that won the NCCA men's basketball championship in 1966 with an all-black starting lineup — a first in NCAA history — over the powerhouse Kentucky team.\n\nThe Texas Western team helped break racial barriers in the sports world, and was featured last year in the Disney movie \"Glory Road.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are still places in this world where fears and prejudices still prevail,\" said Chistopher Watkins, Harris' lawyer."
