        "text": "The latest classic animated movie to be slated for a live-action remake is 1970’s “The Aristocats,” according to Deadline.\n\nWill Gluck, who co-wrote and directed “Peter Rabbit” and its sequel is writing the script with Keith Bunin, whose credits include the Disney/Pixar movie “Onward.”\n\nIn the original film, the elegant Duchess (voiced by Eva Gabor) and her three kittens live the high life with their kindly owner Madame. When the owner’s jealous butler Edger learns she plans to leave all her money to the cats, he kidnaps them and abandons them in the country. They’re helped back home by Thomas O’Malley the alley cat (Phil Harris).\n\nSources told Deadline that the project would look similar to 2019’s “Lady and the Tramp” revamp, which – unlike recent Disney live-action remakes, featured real animals."
