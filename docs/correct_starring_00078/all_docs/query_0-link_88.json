        "text": "The Aristocats\n\nAfter a brief hiatus due to work commitments, I am back with the next Disney movie on the list – The Aristocats.\n\nReleased in 1970, The Aristocats follows the story of Edgar, a jealous butler who catnaps Duchess, Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz after learning that Adelaide’s fortune will go to them after her death. Determined to inherit first, Edgar dumps the cats in the French countryside, leaving them to find their way home to Paris with the help of Thomas O'Malley, a tough alley cat.\n\nThe story could be considered reminiscent of Lady & The Tramp, in that a stray and a house pet go on an adventure and simultaneously fall in love. However, I do think this is where the similarities end as they both deal with a different subject matter and I do feel like the core relationships in both movies are very different. I think the main reason for this is due to Lady and Duchess, who despite coming from similar backgrounds, have opposing personalities. While Lady is very naive and can be seen as a conventional damsel in distress, Duchess is a very mature character, and she never presents herself as someone who needs to be rescued. She is very calm and makes it very clear to O'Malley that both the kittens and Adelaide are more important to her than romance. Duchess is also very aware of the type of cat that O'Malley is, and initially rejects him when she figures him out. This is very much unlike Lady, who takes a long time to discover Tramp’s past and his previous girlfriends.\n\nThe relationship between O'Malley and Duchess grows naturally, and there are some incredibly sweet moments between the two. It feels very natural, and I like how the two leads are shown as adults rather than teenagers which is common for Disney movies. On of my favourite scenes between them is shortly after ‘Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat’, as they talk quietly on the rooftop. This is the first, and possibly the only time in the film where they are completely on their own, and the kittens are listening in from a distance. It’s a lovely scene, not just because of the beautiful animation, but because they’re very honest with each other.\n\nWhat I really admire about their manic is that Duchess already has children, however O'Malley accepts this pretty early on and the film never brings it up as an issue in their relationship. Disney movies traditionally focus on stereotypical families, and tend to kill off either one or both parents to cause emotional conflict. In The Aristocats, this is not the case as it presents Duchess as a single mother and doesn’t offer any further information on who is the kittens’ father is. They also show Duchess as a really good parent, which again is not something that Disney always focuses on.\n\nWhile the mother and child bond in the film is heart-warming to watch, the relationship between the three kittens is also very entertaining. While they do have the classic sibling rivalry, it is clear to the audience that they also care for each other a great deal. While I do think the film’s overall focus is on the romance between O'Malley and Duchess, there are some scenes at the beginning that really show off the adorable kittens. The main example that comes to mind is the 'Scales and Arpeggios’ sequence, where the kittens have their music and art lesson. Not only does it show the interaction between Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz, but it also introduces their different personalities. I love how they do have distinguishable character traits, and are not shown as carbon copies of each other. As a cat lover and proud cat owner, I could easily pick up on their lifelike behaviour, which definitely added more to the film for me.\n\nWhile I do love the cats dearly, my favourite character of the film has to be Roquefort. The tiny mouse helps rescue the cat family, which is not only adorable, but incredibly brave. He searches for them at night, tries following Edgar and also comes face to face with a gang of alley cats. This just shows how much he cares for the cat family, and it proves that you don’t have to be a big tough alley cat in order to be a hero. This for me, is a very subtle moral, however it is an important one. I have a lot of respect for Rouqefort for this and I think he does a good job of showing what true friendship looks like.\n\nThe voice acting in the movie is incredible – something that I’ve not really mentioned in a review before. Roquefort is voiced by Sterling Holloway, who also starred in The Jungle Book as Kaa, Alice In Wonderland as the Cheshire Cat and Winnie The Pooh as the titular character. The wonderful Phil Harris gives his voice to Thomas O'Malley, however you may also know him as Baloo from The Jungle Book or Little John in Robin Hood. Both actors have instantly recognisable and unique voices, and make feel very reminiscent of my childhood when I hear them.\n\nAs O'Malley and Roquefort are two of the heros of the film, Edgar the butler is the villain. While he is very entertaining, I don’t think he is as strong as the other villains we have seen so far in the Disney rewatch. He is not very comparable to the likes of Cruella De Ville or Shere Kahn as he is not particularly threatening or scary which means that you never really feel concerned for their safety. Edgar becomes more of a comedic character, and even has his own short subplot as he tries to cover up his crime and hides from Napoleon and Lafayette. This whole scene in its self shows just show how incapable he is of being a true villain, as he left his belongings at the crime scene and\n\nis easily scared by the two stupid dogs. I also felt that the motivation behind his crime is also very weak, in that is is centred around claiming inheritance. Other great Disney villains usually have a much more meaningful reason for their behaviour, such as being desperate to rule the world. While you could compare Edgar’s rationale to Cruella’s desire for a fur coat, I feel like Cruella is much more threatening due to the execution of her character. Cruella makes it very clear from the offset that she intends to kill the puppies to make a coat, however Edgar never specifically tells the audience what he plans to do with the cats. Cruella is also shown both in her design and in her behaviour to be insane, however Edgar is much calmer and seems fairly normal from the outset. I think its this normality that makes Edgar ultimately fail as villain, as his demeanor and temperament are not that of a classic Disney villain.\n\nNot only is Edgar a disappointing villain, but there are no real emotional scenes in this film. Normally there is at least one moment that was created to make the audience really feel for the characters, however there isn’t any such moment in The Aristocats. While the emotional scene doesn’t necessarily need to be sad, I do think the film did lack some emotional depth like I’ve grown accustomed to with Disney movies. For me, I think this could have been resolved by having some sort of reunion scene between the cats and Adelaide, as their separation was the main drive of the story. I think it could have been an emotionally charged scene, but unfortunately a reunion was bypassed and the film jumped ahead to O'Malley having already been accepted as part of the family.\n\nThere isn’t many musical numbers in The Aristocats, however I can’t review this film without mentioning the classic 'Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat’ which is still a hugely popular Disney song. Again, while The Aristocats isn’t one of Disney’s best loved films, this is one of those songs that every one knows, regardless of whether they are a Disney fan or not. The jazz feel of the song is quite different compared to other Disney music, and the animation sequence is beautiful as the cats dance and the lights change colour. I love the contrast in this song to the others in this movie, as it really shows how far away the cats are from home. It highlights the difference between O'Malley and Duchess, as we are introduced to O'Malley’s friends. This is definitely in contrast to the style of music the cats listen to at Adelaide’s mansion, which is much more classical and less colourful.\n\nHowever, as much as I do love 'Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat’, it is not my favourite song of the film. I much prefer 'Thomas O'Malley Cat’, which is sung as we are first shown the male lead. The song is very dramatic and suits O'Malley perfectly as it is a swing style song accompanied by a big band. It’s a great way to introduce a new character, as he flirts with Duchess by singing about himself. As an audience, you immediately know what type of character O'Malley is, and it brings an excitement as he sings. You know from just the song that he is going to try and impress Duchess at every possibility, and its very easy to liken him to Tramp from Lady & The Tramp. O'Malley is a very cool character, and the song definitely sums him up and does him justice."
