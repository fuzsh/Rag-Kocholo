        "text": "Artificial intelligence will one day write this article instead of us — *beep boop* Hello, human! I hear Ted Lasso is a good show *boop beep* — but until then, we're making the recommendations around here, and we're giving a cautious thumbs up to Rashida Jones' Sunny, a sci-fi series about an artificially intelligent robot who helps a woman (Jones) unravel a mystery involving her family in Japan. There's just one problem: The robot might be a killer. We won't kill you, and we would even say that Ted Lasso might be a little overrated. A robot would never say that. (Please don't take our jobs.)\n\nNatalie Portman's new TV series The Lady in the Lake didn't quite make our list of the best TV shows and movies to watch on Apple TV+, but next week's new release will: Taika Waititi's take on Time Bandits premieres next Wednesday. Other new Apple TV+ releases worth watching include the bawdy Presumed Innocent and the heartwarming Acapulco.\n\nThis list was last updated July 19; newer additions are at the top.\n\nSunny\n\nFor fans of: Cute robots, killer robots, tech mysteries, Japan\n\nIt appears that someone took the plot of Black Mirror's stunning Season 2 episode \"Be Right Back\" (or maybe Season 5's Miley Cyrus-starring \"Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too\") and made a whole series out of it, adding some conspiratorial mystery to the question of whether technology can replace lost loved ones. Rashida Jones stars as Suzie Sakamoto, an American expat living in Japan, who is gifted a state-of-the-art robot after her roboticist husband and young son die in a plane crash, but she freaks out when her bot starts acting strange. (The occasional flashes of an out-of-control robot murdering humans probably don't help, either.) The A24-produced sci-fi dark comedy — which stylistically pulls from the monolithic corporate vibes of Severance, Apple's best sci-fi show — sends Suzie searching for answers about what her husband was really working on and how far these robot glitches reach. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nPresumed Innocent\n\nFor fans of: '80s erotic thrillers, page turners\n\nThis adaptation of the 1987 novel by Scott Turow, which was also adapted into a 1990 film starring Harrison Ford, stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a prosecutor who becomes the prime suspect in a murder case after a colleague is found brutally killed. Further complicating matters — and implicating him — is the fact that he was having an affair with the victim. Naughty naughty! David E. Kelley serves as showrunner, which should give you some idea of its tone; in other words, it's a passable drama that works best if you don't parse all the details and just let what happens happens. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nAcapulco\n\nFor fans of: Hard work, sunny vibes, telenovelas\n\nIf you need to wash the day away, you can't do much better than checking into the Las Colinas resort in Acapulco, the setting for this comedy about a young man who gets a dream job working at a high-end resort in Mexico. The 1980s-set bilingual comedy -- it's about 50/50 English and Spanish -- is like Jane the Virgin meets The White Lotus meets How I Met Your Mother, as Maximo (Enrique Arrizon) works his way up from pool boy in 1984 to wealthy hotelier in the present-day timeline. It's charming, it's sunny, and it's got a pair of lounge singers who belt out '80s classics in Spanish. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nMore streaming recommendations:\n\nThe best shows on Netflix\n\nThe best shows on Prime Video\n\nThe best shows on Max\n\nThe best shows on Hulu\n\nThe Big Door Prize\n\nFor fans of: Small town comedies, existential questions, comically large bowls of spaghetti\n\nChris O'Dowd stars in this comfortably whimsical comedy about citizens of a small town who get in a tizzy when a mysterious machine called The Morpho arrives with a promise to reveal their life potential on a little blue card. Seeing how these regular folk take to archery, motorcycle riding, and other hobbies they previously had no interest in is both hilarious and thought-provoking, as questions of prophecy, latent desires, and divine intervention swirl around your head. But the real draw here is the charming cast and the characters they bring to life with intertwining stories sharpened with a bit of mystery. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nGirls State\n\nFor fans of: Boys State, destroying the patriarchy\n\nA sequel to the excellent 2020 documentary Boys State, Girls State flips the gender on the annual meeting of high schoolers who meet together to simulate a political ecosystem by forming their own democractic government, complete with campaigns and elections for positions like governor and the Supreme Court. Thankfully, Girls State is more than just another round of Boys State, as many of the participants acknowledge and fight the great discrepancy between the two programs and how the boys are better supported in every way possible. Just as Boys State bluntly reminded us that politics are a circus for those willing to sacrifice their morals for power, Girls State is a reminder that the patriarchy still controls the government. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nSugar\n\nFor fans of: Mind-blowing twists, classic detective stories, old movies\n\nThere aren't many shows like Sugar. Heck, there aren't many anythings like Sugar. For several episodes, it's a well-executed take on the classic detective noir story, with Colin Farrell starring as John Sugar, a private dick with quirks and an obsessive love of classic films. He shakes down half of Los Angeles looking for the missing daughter of a somewhat famous movie producer, but it isn't until later in the series that Sugar drops one of the craziest twists in TV history (spoilers inside), and the show transforms into something else while also holding firm to its noir roots. Is it a better show for it? We're not sure. We're still processing that twist.\n\nManhunt\n\nFor fans of: Historical dramas, Civil War drama, Anthony Boyle showing off range\n\nWhere all the other stories about Abe Lincoln end, this one begins — with his death at the hands of John Wilkes Booth, one of modern history's most famous assassins. The focus here is on Edward Stanton (Outlander star Tobias Menzies), Lincoln's Secretary of War and the man who runs the search for Booth. But this series isn't just about that — it also deals with how this assassination threw the newly reunited USA into a different sort of chaos, and the conspiracies that arose as a result of that. It's a simple premise with a very complicated story.\n\nThe Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin\n\nFor fans of: The Mighty Boosh's Vince Noir, Our Flag Means Death, lots of chatter about velvet\n\nThis incredibly silly comedy will appeal to a particular set of viewers who were charmed by Noel Fielding's pre-Great British Baking Show comedy The Mighty Boosh, as it lets Fielding go wild with what is essentially the same flamboyant, fashion-obsessed character he played in that cult comedy. Set in 18th century England, The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin follows a very unrugged Dick Turpin (Fielding) as he pursues a new career as a highwayman robbing coaches with his incredibly unorthodox methods and a gang of misfits, while they tangle with obstacles both supernatural and regular natural and they're pursued by stuffy aristocrats and lawmen. It is supremely goofy, which is enough to steer it away from its closest comparison, the rather earnest Max pirate comedy Our Flag Means Death. You don't have to be high to enjoy it, but it certainly wouldn't hurt. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nConstellation\n\nFor fans of: Motherhood, theoretical physics\n\nApple TV+ is quickly establishing itself as a home for science fiction television of all flavors, and its latest falls firmly into the \"smart and philosophical\" category. Noomi Rapace stars as an astronaut who returns home to a life she doesn't quite recognize after an experiment in quantum mechanics causes an accident on the International Space Station. Back on terra firma, her family seems different, she's not remembering things she supposedly did, and she's haunted by images only she can see. Some death-defying action is frontloaded in the first few episodes, but the series then settles into what it really is: a meditation on identity and family through a theoretical physics lens. -Tim Surette [Trailer] [Review]\n\nMasters of the Air\n\nFor fans of: Band of Brothers, the internet's favorite boys\n\nYou thought Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks were done making limited series about World War II? Think again. The duo behind Band of Brothers and The Pacific are now bringing us Masters of the Air, which follows a group of airmen, nicknamed the \"Bloody Hundredth,\" who conducted risky bomb raids over Germany during the war. The series doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's a thrilling spectacle, and the sprawling cast is a real who's who of It boys, including Austin Butler, Barry Keoghan, and Ncuti Gatwa. -Allison Picurro [Trailer] [Review]\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nFor fans of: Historical dramas, true stories, Scorcese flicks, prestige films\n\nMartin Scorsese has made a lot of excellent films over the course of his lengthy career, but Killers of the Flower Moon might legitimately be his best work. This three-hour epic, about a sleazy businessman and his similarly sleazy nephew (played by Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, respectively) marrying into a wealthy Osage Nation family and then murdering them to try to steal their money, is another heartbreaking character study from one of the masters. Star Lily Gladstone made history as the first Native American woman to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, and the fourth Indigenous actress to be nominated in that category. She's the beating heart of this story. -Phil Owen [Trailer]\n\nSlow Horses\n\nFor fans of: Spy dramas, incredibly British things, Gary Oldman rippin' toots\n\nGood spy dramas are hard to come by, which makes Slow Horses a refreshing watch in these times of true crime and tech CEOs behaving badly. The series follows a group of MI5 agents who have been relegated to a backwater outpost called Slough House because of past mistakes, where they're supposed to disappear and do grunt work while superstar agents get the glory. Gary Oldman plays the team leader, a disgruntled man who can no longer give an F about anything, while Jack Lowden plays the new member of Slough House who isn't willing to fade away. It's darkly funny and thrilling. In early 2024, Apple TV+ renewed the series for a fifth season before the fourth season even aired. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nMore recommendations:\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to What to Stream in July\n\nThe Best Shows to Watch Based on Shows You Already Love\n\nThe Best Sci-Fi Shows\n\nFor All Mankind\n\nFor fans of: Putting boots on the moon (and Mars), space travel, alternate history\n\nWhat started out as a fun sci-fi drama set in an alternate history in which Russia landed on the the moon before America — locking the two superpowers in an extended space race that lasts for decades — has become one of TV's best shows. Battlestar Galactica's Ronald D. Moore mixes politics, technology, and character drama to create a show that's unlike anything else on TV. After settling on the moon in Season 2 with lunar stations, Season 3 has bigger aspirations of making it to Mars, bringing some of the most breathtaking action sequences the show has ever done while rivals, plus a new private tech firm, attempt to make history. And in Season 4, we're establishing bases on the Red Planet and dealing with labor practices... in space! It's great for space geeks and anyone into speculative fiction. Joel Kinnaman, Wrenn Schmidt, and Krys Marshall star. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nMonarch: Legacy of Monsters\n\nFor fans of: Kaiju, the Russell family\n\nApple TV+'s biggest star is approximately, as the song goes, 30 stories high. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters brings the cinematic MonsterVerse to the small screen, continuing the story from the 2014 film Godzilla and tracking the origin of the secret cabal Monarch, which hunts and studies MUTOs (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms, aka monsters). Kurt Russell plays a man linked to Monarch in the current timeline, while his son Wyatt Russell plays the younger version of him in a flashback timeline. It's a summer blockbuster on your TV, for better or worse. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Buccaneers\n\nFor fans of: Bridgerton but younger vibes, stickin' it to snobby Brits\n\nNeed to unstuff a stuffy British period piece? Just add Americans. This adaptation of Edith Wharton's unfinished novel, published in 1938, will no doubt draw appropriate comparisons to Netflix's wildly popular Bridgerton, but the story of five young, new-money American women who head to London in the 1870s to catch British aristocrats for marriage adds a different enough wrinkle to make it stand out. These girls are rowdy and raucous, making the conservative Brits spit out their tea (metaphorically, sadly) at their brash behavior. But behind the culture clashes is a whopper of a love triangle as Nan (future leading lady Kristine Frøseth) finds herself caught between two best friends. A finale that holds its secrets tight until the last minute, sets and costumes that used every farthing of Apple's generous budget, and a youthful energy make this show a fun watch. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nLessons in Chemistry\n\nFor fans of: The magic of science, Brie Larson speaking like Sheldon Cooper\n\nApple TV+'s adaptation of Bonnie Garmus' best-selling book isn't always able to replicate the full flavors of the source material, but the story of a chemist (Brie Larson) who becomes a cooking TV show host after the misogyny of academia ousts her from her first love creates a hero who is still easy to root for. With shifting perspectives and timeline jumps, it can sometimes bite off more than it can chew, but that same structure also creates some of its most touching and emotional moments. Who knew a dog had so much to say? -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Pigeon Tunnel\n\nFor fans of: Jon le Carré novels, Errol Morris documentaries\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Errol Morris is well-known for probing his subjects through interrogation, and he may have met his match with John le Carré (real name David Cornwell), the former MI6 operative and British author known as a master of the espionage thriller, with titles such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Night Agent, and The Constant Gardener in his oeuvre. Morris mixes interviews with dramatic reenactments to crack Cornwell's shell in the author's most revealing talk and final interview before his death in 2020. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Super Models\n\nFor fans of: The late 1980s, magazines, \"Freedom! '90\"\n\nThe easy sell is \"here's four hours with some of the most beautiful women to ever walk the Earth,\" but Apple's four-episode docuseries The Super Models is more than skin deep, looking back on the birth of the super model with the women who created it: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Christy Turlington. The first two episodes filled with never-before-seen footage that charts their rise to fame are the best, and the candid interviews give great insight into the behind-the-scenes world of fashion as it was blowing up into the mainstream. Just don't expect anything too deep. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nFor fans of: The Newsroom, #MeToo, A-listers\n\nWhen Apple TV+ launched, it seemed to do so on the back of The Morning Show, its big-budget, high-profile, star-studded drama that was going to win every award out there. Jennifer Aniston AND Reese Witherspoon starring in the same show as rival anchors for a popular morning show? Well, reviews were mixed, and early episodes were less than impressive, but the show righted many of its wrongs as its season continued and spent another season tinkering with its formula. Now in its third season, the series is at its best, which is to say it's embraced the silliness and is going for it with some big swings about topical subjects. Case in point: A billionaire tries to shoot Aniston's character into space in the Season 3 premiere. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Changeling\n\nFor fans of: Brothers Grimm fairy tales, mysteries, New York City\n\nThe Changeling follows Apollo Kagwa (LaKeith Stanfield), a rare book dealer whose life takes a turn for the supernatural after his wife (Clark Backo) commits an unthinkable act of violence and then promptly disappears. Determined to figure out the truth of what happened to her, Apollo is led on a journey through a version of New York City that he never knew existed. Based on the 2017 novel of the same name by Victor LaVelle, The Changeling is an enchanting, spooky, slow-burning fairy tale. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nPhysical\n\nFor fans of: Jazzercise, internal dialogue filled with nasty insults\n\nIf you miss Netflix's GLOW, you might find some solace in this 1980s-set dramedy that follows a housewife (Rose Byrne) who finds strength in the aerobics craze that's just starting to sweep across the nation's malls. But don't expect the cheery underdog story from GLOW; Byrne's character is struggling with bulimia and spends much of her days hurling nasty body-shaming insults at other women. Byrne excels in the role as an antihero breaking free from the expectations of a traditional housewife in her own morally questionable way. Season 3 is the final season. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nFoundation\n\nFor fans of: Hard science-fiction, great special effects\n\nOne of Apple TV+'s biggest gambles is the big-budget science-fiction series Foundation, based on the popular books by Isaac Asimov. I enjoyed Season 1 more than most — though, to be fair, I wasn't familiar with the source material, so I couldn't do any comparisons — but the biggest complaint was that it was uneven and had difficulty bringing Asimov's colossal ideas to television. But the performances are great, particularly from an inspired Lee Pace as the royal villain Brother Day and the always reliable Jared Harris as Hari Seldon. The ambitious premise is too big to explain in a single blurb — basically, some exiles are trying to rebuild society after the collapse of a long-ruling empire — but it's worth checking out if you're a fan of hard sci-fi. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nHijack\n\nFor fans of: 24 but in the sky and only for 7 hours\n\nThis perfectly fine seven-episode thriller stars Idris Elba as a man on board a flight that gets hijacked by terrorists. The good thing about Elba's character? He's a fantastic business negotiator, which makes him the perfect hero to negotiate with the terrorists. Each episode represents an hour of the ordeal, so there is a good sense of a ticking clock going on. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nPlatonic\n\nFor fans of: Chaotic best friends\n\nDespite what When Harry Met Sally taught us, in Platonic, straight men and women can just be friends. This endearingly silly comedy, created by Nicholas Stoller and Francesca Delbanco, reunites Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen as a pair of old friends who reconnect after years apart, which leads to chaos — and some constructive change — as they both reconsider what they want their lives to look like. It's a fun hangout comedy with a dash of midlife crisis. As Keith Phipps says in his review, \"Beneath gags about late-night cell phone etiquette, nightmarish home renovation projects, and raccoons is a bittersweet exploration of giving up youthfulness for middle age, what's lost and gained in the exchange, and the realization that your true friends are the ones still with you on the other side.\" -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]\n\nStill: A Michael J. Fox Movie\n\nFor fans of: Michael J. Fox!\n\nDavis Guggenheim (An Inconvenient Truth) directs this documentary on 1980s Hollywood legend Michael J. Fox, whose career was paused by a Parkinson's diagnosis. The film works because it embodies the optimistic spirit of Fox, whose wit and charm push Still into an uplifting tale of persevering rather than a sad story of what could have been. Guggenheim's use of classic Fox clips to push the narrative forward will only remind you of just how great Fox was and is. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nSilo\n\nFor fans of: Sci-fi murder mysteries, deep holes in the ground\n\nThis new sci-fi series — an adaptation of Hugh Howey's 2012 book Wool — from Justified's Graham Yost starts off with a rough first episode, but the story — a near-future dystopian murder mystery set in an underground facility where the last surviving thousands of humans live — really gets chugging in Episode 2. That's when we're introduced to Rebecca Ferguson's Juliette, an engineer discovering that a series of murders just might be related to the rule-makers of their subterranean abode. Fair warning: This moody and drab drama is for hard sci-fi lovers or fans of Scandinavian noir. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nSchmigadoon!\n\nFor fans of: Musical comedies, corn pudding\n\nDespite being perfectly enjoyable, musical comedy series don't have the most successful track record (Galavant, where art thou?). But Apple TV+'s genre-busting series Schmigadoon! is bucking the trend in a good way. Keegan-Michael Key and Cecily Strong star as a couple who come across a magical town where everyone seems stuck in a 1940s musical. They get stuck in the town, which makes it a bit of a Twilight Zone episode or horror movie where everyone sings about corn pudding. Also, Martin Short plays a leprechaun. This show is goofy on the outside, but secretly twisted. In the fantastic Season 2, the series shifts to \"Schmicago\" to lampoon musicals from the '60s and '70s. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nTed Lasso\n\nFor fans of: Making fun of Americans, making fun of the British, sports, feeling good\n\nIf any show can be credited with restoring faith in humanity after the whirlwind of 2020, it is Ted Lasso. The titular Ted (Jason Sudeikis) is an American college football coach who heads to England to coach an actual football (soccer, for the uninitiated) team. While the setup seems like a farce -- Ted's hiring is part of an elaborate scheme by an embittered woman looking to ruin the beloved football team of her cheating ex-husband -- Ted's seemingly unshakeable good nature and determination to see the best in everyone, even those actively trying to do him harm, is downright inspiring. He doesn't just bring a glow to everyone around him; he leaves viewers with hope that things can get better and that doing your best is enough. He's the hero we didn't know we needed. Season 3 might be the last season of the show, or it might not. Sudeikis and Apple are being extremely non-committal, probably because Apple is holding up a check with a lot of numbers on it to keep it going despite the producers' insistence that the originally planned three-season arc is finished. -Megan Vick [Trailer]\n\nThe Reluctant Traveler with Eugene Levy\n\nFor fans of: Complaining, watching someone being forced to do something they don't want to\n\nIf you find travel shows too packed with things like \"wonder\" and \"enthusiasm\" from their eager hosts, then take a tour of the world with Schitt's Creek's Eugene Levy. As the title implies, Levy would rather loaf around in the comforts of his temperature-controlled home, but here he's visiting beautiful spots like Finland, the Maldives, and Venice, complaining about the weather the entire time. But that's the attraction of the show; Levy's whining is actually more of a draw then the spots he's in, making this less of a travel show and more of a one-man play. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nShrinking\n\nFor fans of: Ted Lasso, crossing boundaries, sad sacks\n\nTed Lasso's Brett Goldstein and Bill Lawrence team up with Jason Segel for this tragi-com about a therapist (Segel) swirling the toilet bowl of life after his wife dies. So what he decides to do is tell it to his patients like it is, obliterating the professional boundaries of therapists. But because this is a TV show from the same team that said a football coach could go to England and coach a soccer team, the advice works! Harrison Ford and Jessica Williams also star. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nServant\n\nFor fans of: Psychological horror from M. Night Shyamalan, babies, food\n\nThe claustrophobic thriller Servant, created by Tony Basgallop and executive produced by M. Night Shyamalan, began as a wild-eyed but mechanically precise story about a family unraveling in the wake of a tragedy. In Season 1, Dorothy (Lauren Ambrose) and Sean Turner (Toby Kebbell) hired live-in nanny Leanne (Nell Tiger Free) to care for the lifelike \"reborn doll\" that a grieving Dorothy believed was her son — only for the doll to somehow become a living baby. Now, the show has gone full-on supernatural as Leanne's true nature has come out. It's the details that make this show stand out, like the rich wallpaper of the Turners' Philadelphia brownstone, the wet, wet, shoes of Leanne's weird uncle (Boris McGiver), and the most unsettling food design since Hannibal. The fourth and final season is now airing. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]\n\nLittle America\n\nFor fans of: The immigrant experience, anthologies, crying your eyes out in a good way\n\nIf you need a nice pick-me-up from the ills of the world, this anthology series from Kumail Nanjiani, Emily V. Gordon, and Master of None's Alan Yang is a good bet. Each episode of Little America is based on the true stories of immigrants in America, showing off their successes and experiences in humorous and heartwarming fashion, like the Indian spelling bee whiz who ran his parents' hotel after they were deported and petitioned Laura Bush to help him get them back. The best part of the show is that it focuses on the systemic challenges they face rather than on hate from racist individuals, and the stories vary wildly so they don't feel repetitive. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nMythic Quest\n\nFor fans of: Workplace comedies, the video game industry\n\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenney is smart enough to know that video games are funny, but they're not to be made fun of. Gamers are legion, after all. The game biz gets a loving sendup in Mythic Quest without making gamers the joke, as McElhenney plays the egotistical creative director of a popular MMORPG that's seemingly always in trouble in some way or another. F. Murray Abraham leaves the show in Season 3 (in spectacular fashion, I might add), but the excellent cast still includes Danny Pudi, Ashly Burch, Jessie Ennis, David Hornsby, Imani Hakim, and Charlotte Nicdao, who's one of TV's most underrated talents. Even with a third season that doesn't hit like the previous two, this is one of TV's best workplace comedies. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nSelena Gomez: My Mind & Me\n\nFor fans of: Selena Gomez, getting to know a down-to-earth megastar\n\nYou can watch Selena Gomez in streaming originals on Netflix (The Fundamentals of Caring), Hulu (Only Murders in the Building), or HBO Max (Selena + Chef), but now you can really see who Selena Gomez is on Apple TV+. This documentary follows Selena as she struggles with stardom, accepts her diagnoses of lupus, bipolar disorder, and depression, and turns her focus on helping herself and others. It's a must-see for Selena fans, and an ought-to-see for everyone else looking for a cathartic film about one's truth. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nBad Sisters\n\nFor fans of: Big Little Lies, Irish accents, cinematography\n\nThe great Sharon Horgan (Catastrophe) created and stars in this Irish series that's something like Big Little Lies as a dark comedy. It's about five sisters — played by Horgan, Anne-Marie Duff, Eva Birthistle, Sarah Greene, and Eve Hewson — one of whom is married to a truly awful man played by Claes Bang, who, when the show begins, is dead. The show unfolds over two timelines, and there's a mystery in each one: What happened to him and how exactly the sisters were involved in his death in the past, and whether they'll be able to keep the secret in the present. It's thrillingly biting in Horgan's signature way. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]\n\nBlack Bird\n\nFor fans of: Mindhunter, prison stories\n\nBlack Bird is one of this year's rarest birds: a true crime adaptation that actually feels fresh — and horrifying. Developed by novelist Dennis Lehane and based on James Keene's autobiographical novel In With the Devil, the drama series stars Taron Egerton as Keene, who's facing a 10-year prison sentence before he gets an unexpected offer: He'll be freed if he can befriend and tease a confession out of a suspected serial killer (Paul Walter Hauser). Ray Liotta, in one of his final roles, plays Jimmy's father, an ex-cop with his own burdens. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]\n\nPrehistoric Planet\n\nFor fans of: Thunder lizards, better than average CGI, David Attenborough\n\nThe whole \"it's a regular nature show, but with dinosaurs\" thing has been attempted many times ever since we first caught a glimpse of a brachiosaurus in the original Jurassic Park. The results have been mixed, with most failing to deliver good-looking dinos, but technology is finally at a place where computers can whip up herds of dinosaurs that require a second glance to check if they're real or not. And that realism is important for the emotional impact; ever see a baby pterosaur in a life-or-death race with a predator? With Father Nature David Attenborough narrating and five episodes divided up by biomes, it's the closest we've come to Planet Earth for dinosaurs. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nTehran\n\nFor fans of: Homeland, thrillers, stress, espionage\n\nAside from Amazon's Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan and whatever passes for a thriller on NBC these days, American television has mostly backed away from international espionage dramas that were once such a hot ticket. To get your spy thrills, you need to look elsewhere, like the Israeli spy thriller Tehran. The International Emmy winner for Best Drama last year, Tehran follows Tamar Rabinyan (Niv Sultan), a female Mossad agent navigating a world of espionage, double crosses, and her cultural quandary as she was born in Iran. After attempting to shut down Iran's plans for atomic weapons in Season 1, Glenn Close joined the cast in Season 2 as a British agent. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nSeverance\n\nFor fans of: The weekend, r/antiwork, brain-melting thrillers\n\nThe whole idea of work-life balance gets revisited with a technological twist in this sci-thriller that will make you want to quit your day job. Mark (Adam Scott) works at Lumon Industries, where a new procedure implants a chip into employees' brains that severs their consciousness into their work life and personal life, splitting their life in two so that neither knows what the other does. Obviously, Lumon is up to no good, and as the employees get closer to the truth, the line between their work lives and personal lives blurs. Scott is joined by a tremendous cast that includes Patricia Arquette, John Turturro, and Christopher Walken, and Ben Stiller and Aoife McArdle work magic behind the camera with one of the best-looking shows in a while. It is WEIRD, yet weaves a complicated conspiracy that will have you hooked. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Tragedy of Macbeth\n\nFor fans of: Willy Shakespeare, a Coen brother, Denzel Washington\n\nDenzel Washington and Frances McDormand star in this adaptation of Shakespeare's Scottish play. It's the first solo film from a Coen brother — McDormand's husband Joel directs, adapts, and produces along with her. If you love art movies, there's not much else that needs to be said to get you to watch this. I mean, it's Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand as Lord and Lady Macbeth. It's kind of historic, in all its black-and-white, Expressionist glory. It was nominated for three Oscars and didn't win any, which only bolsters its artistic credibility. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]\n\nThe Velvet Underground\n\nFor fans of: Art films, innovation, rock band turbulence\n\nFilm auteur Todd Haynes directed this documentary on one of America's most groundbreaking rock bands, The Velvet Underground. But rather than the simple talking heads, live footage, repeat structure used in most rock docs, Haynes gets to the essence of the band by making the film an arthouse gem that Lou Reed and company would have loved. Don't worry, it's still loaded with VU tunes and insight into the tumultuous relationship between Reed and his bandmates, it just looks extra trippy while doing so. Put simply, this is one of the best music documentaries ever made. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nCODA\n\nFor fans of: Heartwarming movies, Deaf culture\n\nA remake of the 2014 French film La Famille Bélier, CODA (which stands for Child of Deaf Adults) is a coming-of-age story about a 17-year-old girl (Emilia Jones) who is the only hearing member of her Deaf family, and must choose between pursuing her own dreams of becoming a singer or helping her mother and father with the family business. It's a crowd-pleasing tearjerker, with a wonderful performance from Jones. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the first movie released by a streaming service to do so. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nLosing Alice\n\nFor fans of: Psychological and erotic thrillers, getting mindf---ed, delicious subtext\n\nOne of the most intriguing releases of 2021, the Israeli psychological drama is lathered up in erotically charged mystery that takes cues from the greats of the film world. Writer-director Sigal Avin leans on Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch, and more for influences in her story about an aging female director (Ayelet Zurer) who becomes obsessed with a young, seductive screenwriter (Lihi Kornowski) and the film that might save her career but destroy her marriage. It's wonderfully shot and loaded with beautiful people, if that's your thing. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nBoys State\n\nFor fans of: Politics, Lord of the Flies, the future of America, chaos\n\nBoys State was one of the best documentaries of 2020. The film follows the annual Boys State, a summer camp (this particular one's in Texas) sponsored by the American Legion in which more than 1,000 high school boys come together to form their own two-party government, complete with elections, voting, and mudslinging. It's a remarkable look at the pitfalls of our current political system, hyper-masculinity among teen boys, and the future of America (it looks like we're in both good and bad hands). Beyond the fascinating subject matter, the filmmaking is superb and gorgeous, feeling more like a scripted movie than a guerilla-shot documentary, which is a compliment in this case. If you like Lord of the Flies or Kid Nation (which, how can you not?), you're going to love this. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nDickinson\n\nFor fans of: Period pieces with anachronisms, Wiz Khalifa\n\nEvery early headline about Dickinson, an Apple TV+ show about Emily Dickinson, felt like a fever dream: John Mulaney guest starring as Henry David Thoreau! Wiz Khalifa playing Death! The show, which stars Hailee Steinfeld as the great American poet in her younger years, is the sort of beautiful gamble that could either soar or fall on its face, with almost no room for anything in between. It worked out — Dickinson totally rules. A delirious, anachronistic period piece, it's both a very funny show and a surreal elegy for all the great art lost to misogyny. It's as bold and haunting as the work of its heroine. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]\n\nWolfwalkers\n\nFor fans of: The wonderful Cartoon Saloon films, wolves, Irish mythology (and accents)"
