Phil Harris was a classic Disney voice artist known for his roles in The Jungle Book (1967) as Baloo the bear, The Aristocats (1970) as Thomas O'Malley the alley cat and Robin Hood (1973) as Little John the bear. Harris was an American singer, songwriter, jazz musician, actor, and comedian. He was also a pioneer in radio situation comedy, starring in "The Phil Harris-Alice Faye show" with his wife, Alice Faye.

Walt Disney himself chose Phil Harris to voice Baloo the bear in The Jungle Book. At first Harris was hesitant to play the part, but after Disney made it clear that Harris could perform the character however he felt was right, the happy-go-lucky and musical Baloo the bear was born, and this lead to Phil Harris being chosen for the voice of the other classic Disney characters he brought to life.

Harris was known to be a wildcard in the recording studio, frequently improvising his lines (many which were kept in the films) and singing various unscripted tunes for his characters. During the recording of The Jungle Book's "I Wanna Be Like You (The Monkey Song)", it was written in the script that the scatting between King Louie and Baloo the bear that Baloo would simply repeat whatever King Louie sang. But Harris didn't like that idea and simply recorded his own improvised version which came to be the one we know today.
