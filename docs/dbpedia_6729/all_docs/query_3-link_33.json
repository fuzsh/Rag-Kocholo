        "text": "“I really enjoy driving for Ryder because I believe management really cares about my safety. I am given the tools resources to serve our customers in a safe and timely way. I am captain of the ship and that is very important to me. Thanks Ryder.”\n\n- Joe Spano Dedicated Driver, 5+ years with Ryder\n\n“In 2007, I was given the opportunity to join the Ryder team through the DDP program. I have always been grateful for the way I was treated during the training program. Over the years I’ve slowly transitioned from driver to supervisor and now to Customer Logistics Manager. Because of the DDP program and through internal promotions, I consider myself to be a Ryder success story for this program.”\n\n- Benjamin Boring, Customer Logistics Manager that has been with Ryder for 12 years\n\n“My drivers mean everything to me because without them Ryder wouldn’t even exist. Our drivers are the first people to see our customers and for that reason I treat them like gold. Most people don’t even realize how difficult it is to drive a tractor/trailer 80,000 lbs. down the road. We take pride in our drivers because not anybody can do this kind of work. So, drivers to me mean everything.”\n\n- Al Flores, Logistics Manager that has been with Ryder for 20 years\n\n“Our Driver teammates are the beating heart of our team. We rely on them every day to represent Ryder to our customers, and I couldn’t ask for a better group & team that what we have. Our drivers continually want to improve our overall Safety, and when there is that kind of engagement you know you’ve got the right members on the Team. The CDT’s that we have on our Team are relied upon as much as any other training support we have in the Company.”\n\n- Glenn Stept Director of Customer Logistics that has been with Ryder for 30 years\n\nThe freedom you have to do your job and the trust given as your reward. Great support from Ryder management and Charter. Drive with Ryder and be part of a great team dedicated to providing outstanding customer service where YOU and your daily efforts are appreciated and valued.\n\n- Phillip Atchison, Dedicated Driver, 2+ years with Ryder\n\nWhat I like most about working for Ryder is the respect and courtesy of management and coworkers. What I like most about working on the Charter account at Ryder is the people at Charter are nice, friendly, and helpful in helping me do my job well. I would recommend someone to work for Ryder because it's a company that goes beyond providing the tools necessary to do your job. You will want to retire here at Ryder.\n\n- James Bell, Dedicated Driver, 7+ years with Ryder\n\nManagement and coworkers, always professional and expedite issues you may have. Room for growth , opportunity . Positive energy. What I like most about the Charter account, management and employee open to suggestions on challenging issues. Allows you to be part of a team. Great atmosphere, always willing to help. I would recommend anyone to Ryder. Great company, growth opportunities, great atmosphere. Ever Better.\n\n- Grover Mincy, Dedicated Driver, 7+ years with Ryder\n\nGreat Pay and being off with no delays. Perfect place to retire and good benefits.\n\n- Juan Perry, Dedicated Driver, 3+ years with Ryder\n\nGreat flexibility. Home every night and for holidays and also has good benefits.\n\n- Dennis Angle, Dedicated Driver, 7+ years with Ryder\n\nIt is very flexible & opportunities. Great benefits that are at reasonable price.\n\n- Donald Keith, Dedicated Driver, 8+ years with Ryder\n\nManagement does one great job.\n\n- Keith Wilkins, Dedicated Driver, 8+ years with Ryder\n\nI like being a part of a team.\n\n- Scott Trout, Dedicated Driver, 2+ years with Ryder\n\nThe people at Ryder are great people to work with. If you start your day with a positive attitude you will have a productive day. That is why I have been here for 30 years.\n\n- Jayson Hoyland, Dedicated Driver, 30+ years with Ryder\n\nI like that they try to help you with any issues you may have.\n\n- Eric Plummer, Dedicated Driver, 1+ years with Ryder\n\nHappy to have 2 driver managers who are dedicated to the drivers.\n\n- Richard Birmingham, Dedicated Driver, 1+ years with Ryder\n\nEasy to deal with and willing to work with you.\n\n- Chris Fisher, Dedicated Driver, 10+ years with Ryder\n\nIn 2016 I decided to make a drastic career change. Ryder provided me the opportunity to do that through the Driver Development Program. The knowledge and skills I learned between class and a diverse group of trainers not only allowed me to be a successful driver but within 2 years become a Driver Trainer myself. It didn’t stop there either. 2 years ago I was offered the position of Certified Driver Trainer. It is because of that program those 5+ years ago that I now get the privilege of helping new people become the best, safest drivers that they can be in this industry.\n\n- Bradley Leuenberger, Certified Driver Trainer, 6+ years with Ryder\n\nI was given the opportunity to join Ryder in 2016 coming through the DDP program. I am very fortunate to have had the experienced trainers that helped develop me in the training program. The program, staff, and trainers prepared me with the hands on experience and knowledge to be safe and successful. Starting out as a team driver and making the transition to solo driver Ryder has allowed me to grow and help in other areas to help the company. Thanks to Ryder and the DDP program for the opportunity and the chance to work with great people.\n\n- Joe Skaggs, Dedicated Ryder Driver, 6+ years with Ryder\n\nWith the great management lead and the team effort by all…glad to be a part of this team.\n\n- Mark Alfano, Dedicated Driver,4+ years with Ryder\n\nManagement that cares and works with you.\n\n- Jerimiah Garns, Dedicated Driver, 5+ years with Ryder\n\nI like working for Ryder because it’s a new experience as a commercial truck driver. I’ve been a local driver for 7 years now and the work and conditions where becoming stale and very repetitive.\n\nWhen the recruiter contacted me I was in the process of looking for a new job and possibly a carrier but needed to have conditions that not only met my family’s needs but what I’m worth as a driver. After spending a few weeks talking with the recruiter she answered all my questions and was very honest about Ryder’s benefits and pay. It was clear and easy to understand. If she didn’t know the answer she went and got the answers to my questions. That’s one reason I like working for Ryder easy and honest on boarding experience.\n\nAfter leaving the food industry to haul flatbed, which I had no experience in, I was intimidated, but my coach trained me in couple of weeks and had me up to speed with the process and procedures of being a safe driver capable of handling the job. Another reason I like working with Ryder is they gave me the time to acclimate to the work. They didn’t jam me into a situation I couldn’t handle but yet made it challenging enough to understand and learn my new role.\n\nLastly why I like working for Ryder most everyone is willing to give advice to help you understand how things work so never feel like you’re alone.\n\nI’m looking forward to the future with Ryder.\n\n- Aaron Putnam, Support Team Driver, 4+ months with Ryder\n\nMy reason for working at Ryder Systems is simple. I make great money, I'm trusted to be the Captain of my ship and supported when I do make safety decisions, and not questioned ( very rare in the trucking industry). My benefits are great and very reasonable. Ryder has so many contracts, I never have to worry about getting laid off. Ryder equipment is well maintained and the staff is very friendly and supportive. I've been a driver for 29 years and wish I would have come here sooner.\n\n- Mike Arnold, Support Team Driver, 4+ months with Ryder\n\nI love what I do and take great pride in it. The biggest part of this job that means the world to me and drives me to do my best is my fleet manager. She has always been decisive and supportive of me.\n\n- Jason Hewitt, Dedicated Driver, 1+ year with Ryder\n\nAt most locations, managers and associates are really nice and cooperative. We have decent equipment for the most part.\n\n- Ricky Gilstrap, Dedicated Driver,7+ years with Ryder"
