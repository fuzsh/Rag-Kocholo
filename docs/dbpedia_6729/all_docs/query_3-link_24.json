        "text": "The Library is here to serve you, regardless of the circumstances! While you’re welcome back inside of PPLD locations, you can still take advantage of curbside services, with a new park and text option! Our Libraries and Mobile Library Services make it easy for you to return materials and safely pickup items on holds, wireless print jobs, and take and make kits – limiting any direct contact with Library staff or other patrons. Also, don’t forget that you can still use the Library remotely and connect with a librarian by phone, live chat, or email. Learn more about our response to COVID-19 and what you can expect from the Library during the ongoing pandemic.\n\nReturns\n\nBook drops or return bins are available 24/7 outside of all libraries, so you’re welcome to return books, movies, and other physical items anytime that’s convenient for you.\n\nHolds\n\nReady to pick-up an item on hold, wireless print job, or take and make kits? Locations are now offering a park and text option to make it even easier for you! Simply drive, bike, or walk up, and have your library card number and PIN ready. Upon arrival, you’ll want to follow the available instructions like park and text, drive-thru, or walk up to the table. (Curbside hours and instructions vary by location, so please check below or by phone.) Then you’ll be on your way to enjoy a new book, movie, or other finds! Click on your Library location below to see their curbside service hours, phone numbers, and pickup instructions:\n\nHomebound patrons can designate another person to pick up their holds. Please call your Library for more information and to schedule such a pickup. For new items, place your hold in the Catalog or mobile app and select your preferred location for pickup. Once you receive your email or text notification (if opted in), check your Library’s curbside schedule and procedures for pickup. For curbside pickup, Library patrons are encouraged to follow public health guidance, including staying 6 feet apart from others.\n\nWireless Printing"
