In 2023, nearly one in six crashes on Texas roads were caused by a distracted driver in which 399 people died and 2,793 were seriously injured. TxDOT’s annual Talk. Text. Crash. campaign is a crucial call-to-action encouraging drivers to keep their heads up and pay attention when behind the wheel.\n\nAll distractions – whether texting, eating, grooming, or having a conversation – can be dangerous. Every driver and every passenger, regardless of age, can be impacted by distracted driving.\n\nSince Sept. 1, 2017, it has been illegal to read, write, or send a text while driving in Texas. Violators can face a fine of up to $200.\n\nTalk. Text. Crash Campaign\n\nTxDOT’s Talk. Text. Crash. statewide public awareness campaign educates Texans on the dangers and risks of driving distracted while also raising awareness of statewide laws. The campaign addresses and discourages all forms of distracted driving when behind the wheel, with the overall goal of saving lives and reducing crashes.\n\nCampaign activities include paid media, social media and earned media, Texas-based social media influencer programming, and community education.\n\nWhat is distracted driving?\n\nDistracted driving is any activity that takes your attention away from driving. Distractions can include anything from texting and talking on a mobile phone to eating and drinking, putting on makeup, shaving, reading, programming a navigation system, watching a video, and even adjusting the radio.\n\nWhat if I need to text or call someone immediately?\n\nResearch shows that regardless of whether you use a voice-to-text program, hands-free device or a handheld one, the distraction will affect your driving. TxDOT offers these tips to prevent distracted driving that can lead to a ticket, or worse, a crash:\n\nAlways give driving your full attention\n\nPull off the road entirely and come to a complete stop before you talk or text\n\nPut your phone away, turn it off, or use an app or your phone settings to block texts and calls or send auto reply texts while you are driving\n\nTell friends, family, and coworkers you won’t respond to calls or texts when you are behind the wheel\n\nRemember that all distractions are dangerous, so pay full attention when behind the wheel\n\n#EndTheStreakTX Campaign\n\nThe Talk. Text. Crash.distracted driving campaign is a key component of #EndTheStreakTX, a broader social media and word-of-mouth effort that encourages drivers to make safer choices while behind the wheel, like wearing a seatbelt, driving the speed limit, never texting and driving, and never driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs."
