Are you trying to solve a narrow technical problem related to\n\nLoginGenerator? Or are you actually trying to impute some kind of\n\nidentity characteristics to a source-IP address? If the latter, then\n\nwhy? Are you trying to save people the inconvenience of logging in? If\n\nyou really don’t care about the security of your site (as you implied\n\nabove), then why not do a normal authentication database and drop a\n\npersistent cookie so your users will only have to log in once?"
