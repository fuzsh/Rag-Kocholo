Here are a few tips to help you write donation messages that convert.\n\nBe clear and concise. Text messages are inherently short, so you must be concise yet clear. The goal is to get your audienceâs attention and convince them to donate without too much fluff. Itâs also important not to bury your donation request.\n\nMake it easy to donate. You want to make it simple for contacts to donate to your cause. Make it easy by including an SMS link to a donation page or giving them clear directions on making a payment.\n\nInclude a call to action. Donât forget to include a call to action in your text message. This informs your contacts about what step to take next. Consider using phrases like âdonate nowâ or âgive today.â\n\nCreate urgency. Fundraisers typically donât last forever. Create urgency by letting contacts know when youâll stop raising money for the cause.Â\n\nPay close attention to the wording. The language you use in your donation text message matters. Ensure your donation ask is specific, compelling, personalized, and on-brand. These characteristics and creating a clear why help you better appeal to your audience.Â\n\nPersonalize messages. Consumers crave customized experiences. Personalizing a message, even with a contactâs first name, can improve your donation request messages.\n\nUse statistics. Numbers help create compelling stories. Donât be afraid to use statistics or numbers to persuade your audience to donate.Â\n\nReply quickly. Text messaging is built for back-and-forth conversations. Make sure you have a plan to reply to potential donors' questions. Fast responses can increase the likelihood of gaining donations.Â\n\nBe mindful of the timing. Pay attention to both the timing and frequency of your donation request texts. The right timing can help you create a sense of urgency and ensure more people donate.\n\nDonât send too many messages. A suitable donation text frequency enables you to follow up without annoying contacts. Donât be afraid to follow up once or twice, but donât send a string of 10 messages.\n\nKnow SMS rules. Text messaging is highly regulated. Make sure youâre aware of these laws to keep texts compliant. For example, you must collect consent to text contacts first and provide a way for them to opt out.\n\nPut your donation text on auto-pilot with Textline\n\nEffective donation text messages drive results and help nonprofit organizations reach their fundraising goals. Use Textline, an easy-to-use SMS platform, to help automate and scale your donation text outreach. With features like mass texting, automated texting, and two-way SMS, you can ensure you reach donors at the right time with these critical messages."
