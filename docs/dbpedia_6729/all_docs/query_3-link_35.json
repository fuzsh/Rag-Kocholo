        "text": "By Cathy Habas\n\n2 min read\n\nSafeWise experts have years of firsthand experience testing the products we recommend. Learn how we test and review.\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's 2022 report, around 3% of drivers fiddle with their cell phones in their car—a dangerous act that takes a driver’s eyes off the road for 5 seconds. This is more than enough time to get in a fatal car wreck—over 3,300 of which are caused by distracted driving each year.\n\nStay Safe and become a SafeWise Insider!\n\nSign up for our free weekly newsletter to get the best safety news, product info, and deals.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\n\nUnderstanding the dangers of texting while driving\n\nYou may know that texting and driving is bad, but may not understand just how bad it really is. In 2022, around 290,000 people were injured in wrecks caused by distracted driving. And drivers aged 16 to 24 are most likely to use a handheld device while driving. With so many less experienced drivers on the road using highly distracting devices, the potential for crashes—and thus injuries and fatalities—is incredibly high.\n\nIf you live in Mississippi, Alabama, or South Carolina, the risks of distracted driving are even more dire. Along with New Mexico and Wyoming, these states are known as the “deadliest states for drivers,” where the number of deaths due to car crashes are nearly twice the national average.\n\nOther risks to texting on the road\n\nWhy is texting while driving dangerous? Of course, lethal consequences or the chance of injuring someone are the biggest risk factors with texting and driving, but there are other risks as well. Consider these other consequences of texting and driving before you pick up your phone when you’re behind the wheel.\n\nYou are probably breaking the law: Texting and driving is illegal in every state except Montana, so you could get a ticket—and a fine.\n\nYour insurance could go up: If you get a ticket for distracted driving, count on your insurance rates skyrocketing.\n\nYou could damage your car: Even if you don’t hurt someone if you cause a crash while texting, you could severely damage your car. A totaled vehicle won’t be cheap to repair or replace.\n\nYou could get sued: According to the Dickerson Oxton law office, you could be sued for negligence if you caused a car wreck while texting and driving.\n\nMonitoring your texting-while-driving habits\n\nIf you aren't sure how often you pick up your phone when you're in the driver's seat, try a driver safety app like Life360. It logs every time you pick up your phone in the car and gives you (or your teen driver) an important wake-up call.\n\nYou can also pause notifications on your phone when driving:\n\nOn an iPhone, go to Settings and then Focus. Tap the plus sign in the upper-right corner. Select Driving and follow the on-screen prompts to avoid distracting pings and notifications when traveling.\n\nOn an Android phone, go to Settings, then Google. Tap Personal Safety and toggle on the option to silence notifications while driving.\n\nArrive alive\n\nTexting while driving is risky at best and lethal at worst. I've started to remind myself to \"arrive alive\" any time I think about using my phone in the car. Maybe that mantra will help you too.\n\nTo get even more information on how to stay safe while driving, please check out our Car Safety Guide. That resource provides plenty of suggestions to ensure you’re as safe as possible on the road.\n\nCompare the top car safety products\n\nProduct\n\nBest for\n\nPrice\n\nSpecs\n\nStand-out feature\n\nLearn more\n\nRead review\n\nBest vehicle tracker$89.99OBD port plug-inMaintenance remindersView on AmazonRead reviewBest car alarm$109.003,000 ft rangeRemote start\n\nDiesel engine safeView on AmazonRead reviewBest dash cam$139.284K Full HD\n\n170° front and rear\n\nTolerates -20°F to 176°FView on AmazonRead reviewBest navigation system$249.996.95 in. touchscreenVoice controlView on AmazonRead reviewSteering wheel lock$32.99Hardened steel\n\n3 different sizes\n\nTamperproof lockView on AmazonRead reviewBest portable car jack$25.60Lifts up to 15 in. and 3,000 lbs.Lightweight\n\nAffordable\n\nView on AmazonRead review\n\nAmazon.com price as of post date.
