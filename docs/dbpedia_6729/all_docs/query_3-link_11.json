        "text": "The annual crackdown on New Jersey motorists who text while driving began this week with 182 law enforcement agencies receiving grants to pay police officers for increased patrols.\n\n“U Drive. U Text. U Pay.” kicked off Monday and runs until April 30, the state Division of Highway Traffic Safety said.\n\nState officials say nearly half of all drivers involved in a crash in 2022 were engaged in a distracted behavior. More than 1,500 people were seriously hurt and 180 killed as a result of those crashes.\n\nDrivers caught texting while driving will be fined from $200 to $400 for a first offense and $800 for additional violations. Motorists will also get three insurance point.\n\nCops across the state issued 7,130 tickets for cell phone use or texting and about 4,000 tickets for careless driving during the 2023 crackdown.\n\n“Staying focused behind the wheel from the moment you step into your car is crucial in preventing a possible tragedy,” state Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a statement. “Our public awareness campaign and increased enforcement efforts against distracted driving help ensure that drivers keep their attention on the road and off their phones.”\n\nA study conducted in the spring and summer of 2021 on 10 major roads in the Garden State showed that one in five drivers were operating their vehicle while distracted. Researchers traveled nearly 15,000 miles in a vehicle mounted with cameras to observe, record and document distracted driving, state officials said.\n\nThe 182 agencies in 20 counties that received $1.2 million in grant money to participate in the texting crackdown are:\n\nATLANTIC\n\nAbsecon $5,600\n\nAtlantic City $12,250\n\nEgg Harbor Township $8,750\n\nGalloway $8,750\n\nHamilton $8,750\n\nHammonton $4,200\n\nMullica $2,800\n\nPleasantville $2,100\n\nBERGEN\n\nBergenfield $7,000\n\nCliffside Park $8,750\n\nCloster $7,000\n\nDumont $7,000\n\nEdgewater $7,000\n\nElmwood Park $7,000\n\nEnglewood $7,000\n\nFairview $7,000\n\nFort Lee $7,000\n\nFranklin Lakes $7,000\n\nHackensack $7,000\n\nHasbrouck Heights $7,000\n\nHaworth $7,000\n\nLeonia $7,000\n\nMontvale $7,000\n\nNew Milford $7,000\n\nNorth Arlington $7,000\n\nOld Tappan $7,000\n\nRidgefield Park $7,000\n\nRidgewood $7,000\n\nTeaneck $12,250\n\nWyckoff $7,000\n\nBURLINGTON\n\nBurlington Township $7,000\n\nDelran $7,000\n\nEvesham $8,750\n\nMedford $7,000\n\nPemberton $7,000\n\nRiverside $7,000\n\nRiverton $7,000\n\nWestampton $7,000\n\nWillingboro $8,750\n\nCAMDEN\n\nBarrington $7,000\n\nBerlin $7,000\n\nCamden County Metro $10,500\n\nCherry Hill $14,000\n\nChesilhurst $7,000\n\nClementon $7,000\n\nCollingswood $7,000\n\nDelaware River Port Authority $10,500\n\nHaddon Heights $7,000\n\nHaddon Township $7,000\n\nLawnside $7,000\n\nLindenwold $7,000\n\nMagnolia $7,000\n\nOaklyn $7,000\n\nSomerdale $7,000\n\nStratford $7,000\n\nWaterford $7,000\n\nWinslow $10,500\n\nCAPE MAY\n\nLower $5,600\n\nMiddle $5,600\n\nWildwood $4,200\n\nWildwood Crest $2,800\n\nCUMBERLAND\n\nBridgeton $7,000\n\nVineland $10,500\n\nESSEX\n\nBloomfield $12,250\n\nEast Orange $7,000\n\nFairfield $7,000\n\nLivingston $8,750\n\nMillburn $7,000\n\nNorth Caldwell $7,000\n\nNutley $8,750\n\nVerona $7,000\n\nWest Orange $12,250\n\nGLOUCESTER\n\nClayton $2,800\n\nDeptford $10,500\n\nEast Greenwich $2,800\n\nElk $4,200\n\nFranklin $7,000\n\nGlassboro $8,750\n\nGreenwich $2,240\n\nHarrison $2,800\n\nLogan $5,600\n\nMantua $7,000\n\nMonroe $7,000\n\nPaulsboro $2,800\n\nPitman $4,200\n\nRowan University $5,600\n\nWashington $12,250\n\nWest Deptford $5,600\n\nWestville $4,200\n\nWoodbury $7,000\n\nHUDSON\n\nBayonne $10,500\n\nGuttenberg $7,000\n\nHarrison $7,000\n\nNorth Bergen $14,000\n\nSecaucus $7,000\n\nUnion City $12,250\n\nWest New York $10,500\n\nHUNTERDON\n\nClinton Town $2,800\n\nClinton Township $6,300\n\nFlemington $7,000\n\nFranklin Township $2,800\n\nFrenchtown $2,800\n\nHigh Bridge $2,800\n\nHolland $4,200\n\nLambertville $2,800\n\nLebanon $4,200\n\nRaritan Township $2,800\n\nReadington $2,100\n\nTewksbury $2,800\n\nWest Amwell $2,800\n\nMERCER\n\nEwing $7,000\n\nHamilton $7,000\n\nLawrence $7,000\n\nMIDDLESEX\n\nCarteret $7,000\n\nDunellen $7,000\n\nHighland Park $7,000\n\nMiddlesex Borough $7,000\n\nMonroe $8,750\n\nNew Brunswick $14,000\n\nNorth Brunswick $12,250\n\nPerth Amboy $12,250\n\nPiscataway $8,750\n\nRutgers University $7,000\n\nSouth Brunswick $14,000\n\nMONMOUTH\n\nAllentown $7,000\n\nColts Neck $7,000\n\nFreehold Borough $7,000\n\nLittle Silver $7,000\n\nMarlboro $12,250\n\nSea Girt $7,000\n\nMORRIS\n\nButler $7,000\n\nDover $7,000\n\nHanover $7,000\n\nJefferson $7,000\n\nMount Olive $8,750\n\nParsippany-Troy Hills $7,000\n\nRandolph $8,750\n\nOCEAN\n\nBerkeley Township $7,000\n\nBrick $14,000\n\nMantaloking $7,000\n\nOcean Gate $7,000\n\nPine Beach $7,000\n\nPine Hill $7,000\n\nSeaside Heights $7,000\n\nPASSAIC\n\nBloomingdale $7,000\n\nHawthorne $7,000\n\nLittle Falls $7,000\n\nPassaic $12,250\n\nPaterson $14,000\n\nProspect Park $7,000\n\nWanaque $7,000\n\nWoodland Park $7,000\n\nSOMERSET\n\nBedminster $2,800\n\nBernards $4,200\n\nBernardsville $3,500\n\nBound Brook $4,200\n\nBranchburg $2,800\n\nBridgewater $3,500\n\nFar Hills $2,800\n\nFranklin Township $7,000\n\nGreen Brook $3,500\n\nHillsborough $7,000\n\nManville $7,000\n\nMontgomery $4,200\n\nNorth Plainfield $7,000\n\nPeapack Gladstone $6,300\n\nRaritan Borough $3,500\n\nSomerset County Sheriff $2,800\n\nSouth Bound Brook $1,680\n\nWarren $2,800\n\nWatchung $2,100\n\nSALEM\n\nPennsville $7,000\n\nSUSSEX\n\nFranklin $7,000\n\nHamburg $7,000\n\nUNION\n\nBerkeley Heights $7,000\n\nCranford $7,000\n\nLinden $7,000\n\nMountainside $7,000\n\nPlainfield $8,750\n\nRahway $12,250\n\nRoselle Park $7,000\n\nSpringfield $10,500\n\nStories by Jeff Goldman\n\nDaylight Savings 2024: When do clocks ‘fall back’ and Daylight Saving Time end this year?\n\nPowerball winning numbers, live results for Saturday’s $201M drawing\n\nMega Millions winning numbers, live results for Friday’s $398M lottery drawing\n\nOur journalism needs your support.
