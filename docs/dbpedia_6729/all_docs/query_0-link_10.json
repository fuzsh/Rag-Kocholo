        "text": "Mourning the Loss of a Bright Young Star (Magnus White) in the Cycling Community\n\nOn July 29, 2023, a heartbreaking event deeply impacted the cycling community. 17-year-old Magnus White, a member of the USA Cycling Junior Men's National Team, tragically lost his life after being struck by a motorist during a routine training ride in his hometown of Boulder, Colorado. The young talent was on the cusp of heading to Glasgow, Scotland, to compete in the Junior Men's Mountain Bike Cross-Country World Championships when this fatal collision ended his bright future.\n\nWhat Prevents a Motorist from Seeing Someone Right in Front of Them?\n\nWhen a motorist strikes and injures or kills a vulnerable road user (cyclist, pedestrian, or motorcyclist), the inevitable question arises – why and how could this happen? The devastation caused to families, friends, and the community prompts a search for who bears responsibility for the tragic incident.\n\nWhen initial investigations eliminate drugs, alcohol, and speeding as factors, the next significant concern emerges – what prevents a driver from noticing someone right in front of them? The remaining possibilities point to the likelihood of distracted driving. Was the driver drowsy? Eating? Or something even more common, being distracted by their phone?\n\nThe Life of a Rising USA Cycling Champion Magnus White\n\nMagnus White was born on November 18, 2005, in Boulder Colorado. His passion for two wheels began at the age of two, as he started riding on a strider bike. His father, a road cyclist, introduced him to the sport early on. Magnus joined the local juniors cycling team- Boulder Junior Cycling and began racing at the age of eight. By the age of 10, he was already competing at a national level, showcasing remarkable determination and talent. As he grew older, his commitment to the sport intensified, and he rapidly ascended through the ranks.\n\nThe 2021-2022 season was a defining period for Magnus, as he participated in his first UCI-level races as a first-year 17-18 yr. junior cyclist. Achieving some of his biggest goals, he clinched the 2021 USA Cycling National Championship and embarked on a European racing journey during the Christmas Block. His extraordinary success in Europe secured him a spot on the 2022 World Championships team in Fayetteville.\n\nGrowing up in Colorado, Magnus loved all outdoor activities. He loved riding his bike, skiing, and hiking with his dog Zuma. Magnus not only excelled in cycling, but he maintained a 4.2 GPA in his advanced high school classes with a focus on business studies. A bright and ambitious young man, Magnus aspired to attend business school and had plans to graduate from high school a semester early to focus on international competitions in the spring of 2024. His dedication to both his education and sport underscored his commitment to personal growth and excellence in all aspects of life.\n\nMagnus White's rise to prominence in the cycling world was swift and impressive. He excelled in cyclocross, a combination of \"road cycling, mountain biking, and steeplechase,\" which earned him the honor of representing the USA in his first cyclocross world championship in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and a subsequent one in the Netherlands. His accomplishments and unwavering spirit won the hearts of his fellow cyclists and the admiration of his Boulder community.\n\nWith dreams of conquering new heights, Magnus was eagerly preparing for the Junior Men's Mountain Bike Cross-Country World Championships in Glasgow, scheduled for August 10, 2023. His selection for the junior men's MTB cross-country team was a testament to his tenacity and skill in the off-road cycling scene.\n\nNot All Cycling Crashes Are Accidents\n\nThe tragedy that unfolded on Saturday, July 29th was an immense shock to all who knew Magnus White. Riding on the shoulder of Highway 119, known as the Diagonal, he was struck by a 23-year-old woman driving a Toyota Matrix SUV. The driver veered from the right-hand lane onto the shoulder, striking Magnus from behind before crashing into a fence. Despite swift medical attention, Magnus could not be saved, and the young cycling talent was pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle was unharmed. Neither drugs, alcohol nor excessive speed are suspected factors in the crash, according to the state patrol.\n\nSo why did the driver hit and kill Magnus White? If she wasn’t intoxicated or speeding, why didn’t she see him in time to avoid the fatal impact? As cyclists, we always question when these tragic stories use the term “cycling accident.\" What would you call it?\n\nThe word accident is defined as “an unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury.” One may ask \"But if a driver is breaking the law, isn’t that knowingly or “intentionally” creating a significant risk for others?\"\n\nCollisions resulting from distracted driving, or any other unlawful negligent behavior should not be labeled as an accident.\n\nThe term accident implies an unforeseen and unintentional event often devoid of blame or fault. However, in cases of distracted driving, the fault lies with the driver who chose to engage in distracting activities while operating a vehicle.\n\nThese collisions are preventable. Drivers have a duty to maintain control of their vehicles in a manner that does not create unreasonable harm to others. Neglecting this duty demonstrates a clear breach of responsibility, leading to potentially devastating consequences.\n\nClassifying all collisions as accidents undermines the need for accountability and responsible driving behavior. By referring to them as accidents, we inadvertently downplay the significance of unlawful driving that causes harm to others. We do not want to diminish the urgency for adopting stricter measures to deter distracted driving.\n\nDistracted Driving\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Administration, 3,522 people were killed by distracted drivers in 2021. Distracted driving is any activity that diverts attention from driving. Common distractions while driving include texting or using a mobile phone, eating, or drinking, adjusting the radio or navigation system, talking to passengers, and engaging in activities that take the driver's eyes, hands, or mind away from the road. — anything that takes your attention away from the task of safe driving.\n\nSending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds.\n\nAt 55 mph, that’s like driving the length of a football field with your eyes closed!\n\nTexting is the most alarming distraction as it involves three forms of distraction: visual, manual, and cognitive. The laws regarding distracted driving vary by state. The Governor’s Highway Safety Association provides a complete list of Distracted Driving laws.\n\nAdvocating for Zero Fatalities in Honor of Magnus White\n\nAs news of Magnus's passing spread, the entire cycling community rallied together in mourning. Tributes poured in from fellow athletes, coaches, cycling organizations, and fans from all corners of the globe, reflecting the profound impact he had on the sport and those he touched.\n\nAs the cycling community mourns his loss, there is a collective call for increased road safety awareness and measures to protect vulnerable road users. Stricter laws and infrastructure improvements have become more urgent, aiming to create safer spaces for cyclists with a goal of Zero fatalities.\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nGoFundMe:\n\nThe cycling community has come together to support the family through a GoFundMe campaign set up to help them during this difficult time and honor Magnus's legacy.\n\nMake Your Voice Heard:\n\nAdvocate for increased safety and stricter penalties by supporting local laws, becoming involved in advocacy groups, and sharing concerns on social media.\n\nMagnus White's passing leaves an irreplaceable void in the hearts of his parents, Jill and Michael, and his brother Eero, along with countless friends worldwide. The global cycling community has lost a bright star that was full of incredible passion, talent, and dedication to the sport.\n\nAs we mourn his passing, let us remember him not only for his exceptional achievements but also for his infectious smile, laughter, and the joy he brought to those around him. May his memory inspire us to cherish our loved ones and prioritize road safety for all cyclists. Rest in peace, Magnus White. May your stars and stripes shine brightly forever."
