        "text": "Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you had to manually type out information from a paper document, email, or scanned contract into a program or database? Then you know it’s a frustrating and time-consuming process that can often result in errors and inaccuracies.\n\nError rates in manual data entry range from 0.55% to 3.6%, which not only alters the quality of the work, but also requires your employees to spend even more time on altering mistakes, and as we all know, time is money.\n\nFortunately, there’s a solution that can help streamline this tedious task: Google Docs OCR. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology allows Google Docs to recognize text from images and convert it into editable digital text.\n\nIn this blog, we will explain what Google Docs OCR is, how you can use it to convert images to text, and introduce you to the best Google Docs OCR alternative. Let’s get started!\n\nWhat is Google Docs OCR?\n\nBefore diving into Google Docs OCR, let’s break down OCR first. Optical Character Recognition is a technology designed to help users with data extraction. This technology helps convert the text from an image or a scanned document, into a format that the computer is able to read.\n\nKnowing this, Google Docs OCR is essentially one of the free alternatives offered by Google Drive to convert images to text. The process behind Google Docs OCR is nothing more than uploading images from which you need the data, into Google Docs, and exporting the data as a text format into your computer. Sounds pretty straightforward, right?\n\nLet’s take a detailed look into the steps needed to convert an image to text using Google Docs OCR.\n\nHow to Use Google Docs OCR to Convert Images to Text?\n\nNow that we saw that Google Docs can be used as an OCR tool, it is time to put it to the test. Take a look at the following steps of Google’’s image to text conversion:\n\nStep 1: Upload your documents.\n\nIt is important to remember that Google Drive supports documents with .jpg, .png, .gif extensions and PDF files with a maximum size of 2 MB.\n\nGo to Google Drive, click on My Drive, and select Upload Files.\n\nStep 2: Select the image files you want to convert.\n\nStep 3: Right-click on your image. Select Open with > Google Docs.\n\nAfter selecting to open your file with Google Docs, wait for a bit and a new document will open, containing the newly converted text.\n\nAnd this is it! Now your document is fully constructed from text and is ready to be exported into various extensions, such as .docx, .odt, .rtf, and many more.\n\nLimitations of Image-to-Text Extraction with Google Drive OCR\n\nWe saw that converting the image to text went smoothly and there were no complicated steps. However, the presented results didn’t completely meet our expectations. There are certain limitations involved in using Google Docs as an OCR tool.\n\nRandomized formatting – Google Docs OCR has a hard time differentiating sizes or types of fonts. This makes the user spend an additional amount of time adjusting the results.\n\nLack of font recognition – Google’s OCR works best solely with standard fonts, such as Arial or Times New Roman. It cannot process well more complex fonts or handwriting at all.\n\nFile size limitation – With Google Docs OCR, the file you wish to upload should not exceed 2MB. Otherwise, the software will have a hard time processing the data within.\n\nInability for bulk processing – Google Docs OCR cannot offer the possibility to upload multiple documents simultaneously, for time-saving purposes. This lack of bulk processing can affect businesses that have to process thousands or more files, monthly.\n\nAn OCR tool should make one’s life easier, in terms of data extraction, data processing, or image-to-text conversion. The majority of users will not be satisfied if they have to undergo additional data processing, right after using technology-based tools to ease their tasks. Here, the results of the Google Docs OCR still need certain modifications, in order to make the text readable and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nUsing technology to digitize repetitive and tedious tasks should also represent a time-saving practice. In this case, Google Docs not only requires quite some time to generate the results but also makes the user spend additional time on perfecting the results, which nullifies the purpose of using it in the first place.\n\nSo what can you do in such a case? You need to find software that meets all the requirements and works efficiently and effectively.\n\nGoogle Drive OCR alternative: Klippa\n\nPowered by machine learning, our image-to-text converter is not only easy to use but is also precise in its execution. Klippa OCR software offers fast and accurate results, and if you are still in doubt, check out our image-to-text converter down below:\n\nIf you only process a low volume of documents, our image-to-text converter can be a great tool for you. However, if your organization is looking for a scalable solution that automates data entry completely by accurately transcribing data from image to text, we have another solution for you.\n\nGoing Beyond Image-to-Text OCR Software with Klippa\n\nAs you have probably noticed, using free image-to-text converters, including Google Drive OCR, comes with limitations.
