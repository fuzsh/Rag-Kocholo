Please refer to their respective policies on data privacy and protection of those providers.\n\n2. Collecting and Processing Your Information\n\na. Whenever you visit our websites, we store certain information including but not limited to, about the browser and operating system you are using;\n\nthe date and time of your visit; the status of the interaction (e.g. whether you were able to access the website or received an error message);\n\nthe usage of features on the website;\n\nany search phrases you entered;\n\nhow often you visit individual websites;\n\nthe names of the files you access;\n\nthe amount of data transferred;\n\nthe Web page from which you accessed our website; and the Web page you visited after visiting our website, whether by clicking links on our websites or entering a domain directly into the input field of the same tab (or window) of the browser in which you have our websites open.\n\nIn addition, on platform level we do not store the full IP address, however for Google and Adobe Analytics, below are the details:\n\no Adobe Analytics the Internet Service Provider is stored for 37 months.\n\no Google is anonymizing the IP by default https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en\n\no Google is not tracking the ISP anymore since last February https://www.seerinteractive.com/blog/deprecating-network-domain-service-provider/\n\nThis is for security reasons; in particular, to prevent and detect attacks on our websites or attempts at fraud.\n\nb. We will store and process your personal information only if you share that information with us. You can provide your consent through the Declaration of Consent (DoC) presented to you at various avenues e.g. visiting our website, visiting a dealership, at events etc. and/or for instance, by filling out a registration form, contact form, survey, contest entry or to execute a contract. In such cases as well, we will store and process only the data we are allowed to keep based on consent given by you or in accordance with applicable legal regulations (more information on this can be found in the section titled \"Legal Foundation for Processing\" clause 8).\n\nc. You are neither legally nor contractually obligated to share your personal information. However, certain features of our websites may depend on the sharing of personal information. If you do not provide your personal information in such cases, you may not be able to use those features, or they may be available with limited functionality.\n\n3. Purpose of Use\n\na. We use the personal information collected during your visit to any of our websites to make using them as convenient as possible for you and to protect our IT systems against attacks and other unlawful activities.\n\nb. If you share any personal information with us – for example, by filling out a registration form, contact form, survey, contest entry or to execute a contract with you or to provide you any goods or services – we may use that information for the designated purposes as stated in the Declaration of Consent (DoC), for purposes of customer management and if required, for purposes of processing or billing or managing business transactions within the required scope in each instance (hereinafter collectively referred to as ‘Purpose’).\n\n4. Transfer of Personal Information to Third Parties; Social Plugins\n\na. We may transfer the personal information shared with us on our website or otherwise with third parties including but not limited to the Authorised Dealers, Group Companies, our Service Providers, to fulfill the Purpose.

On our websites, whenever there is a use of so-called \"social plugins\" from social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google+, we incorporate them in the manner described below.\n\nWhen you visit our websites, social media plugins are deactivated. That means no information, whatsoever, is transferred to the operators of those networks. If you wish to use one of the networks, click on the appropriate plugin in order to be connected directly to that network's server.\n\nIf you have a user account with that network and are logged in at the moment you activate the plugin, the network will be able to detect your visit to our websites and assign it to your user account. If you wish to prevent that, please log off from the network before activating the social plugin. A social network will not be able to detect that you have visited other Mercedes-Benz AG websites unless you have activated its social plugin on those sites as well.\n\nWhen you activate a social plugin, the network transfers the content thus made available directly to your browser, which incorporates it into our websites. In that situation, data transfers initiated and controlled by the respective social network may also take place. Your connection to a social network, the data transfers that take place between the network and your system, and your interactions on that platform are governed exclusively by the respective network's data privacy and protection policy.\n\nThe social plugin will remain active until you deactivate it or delete your cookies.\n\nCookie Policy\n\nWhenever you click on a link of third party or activate a social plugin, your personal information may be transferred to third parties in or outside India. Please keep these circumstances in mind before you click on a link or activate a social plugin, thereby causing your data to be transferred.\n\n5.
