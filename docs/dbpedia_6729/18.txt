Fleet Services

The Office of Fleet Services provides access to vehicles and transportation services to state agencies. The team manages a fleet of approximately 3,000+ vehicles for dispatch and direct agency assignment. Daily dispatch vehicles come with 24-hour roadside assistance and all operational costs covered by a nominal fee charged to the agency, and are available from multiple pickup sites throughout the state. The section is also responsible for investigation and resolution of all citizen complaints relating to alleged abuse or misuse of all agency/school district owned vehicles.
