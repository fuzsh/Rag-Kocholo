        "text": "American Culture & the Horror FilmStephen King writes: “There is art in a horror film when the audience gets more than it gives. Not when our fears are milked just to drive us crazy but when an actual [connection] is found between our fantasy and our real fears.” This course introduces a critical vocabulary of cinematic analysis through the exploration of major American horror films. Through critical readings and screenings of representative films from horror classics like Night of the Living Dead (1968) to modern day horror like Get Out (2017), we will discover, discuss, and interpret the various strategies through which the art of horror evokes our deepest fantasies and fears regarding cultural and individual vulnerability. We will focus both on the cinematic vocabulary and techniques within the genre (its stylistic and formal innovations) and the cultural, sociological, and psychological aspects of the anxiety it evokes (its representation of sexuality, gender, class, race, and other topics) while at the same time laying a solid foundation for success in college. By the end of this course, you will be able to produce an elegant and innovative close reading of a horror film (through proper note taking, presentations, and projects) and detail its complex relation to contemporary cultural issues.Horror, Film, CultureTFYSCLOSED CADC: Architecture and DesignThe College of Architecture, Design and Construction's Architecture and Design LC is for incoming students majoring in Pre-Architecture-Summer Design Track, Pre-Industrial Design and Environmental Design.
