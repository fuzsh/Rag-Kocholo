        "text": "Sections: The Dream | The Achievement | Timeline of Flight\n\nOn a November night in Paris in 1908, Wilbur Wright addressed a group of French aviation enthusiasts gathered to honor him and his brother, Orville, saying that this honor was really a tribute to “an idea that has always impassioned mankind.” With these words, Wilbur Wright recognized what might be called the universal aspiration to fly. This desire to elevate oneself above one's environment—to conquer the ocean of air—can be seen as a perennial struggle evident in nearly every civilization from classical times to the early twentieth century. As Wilbur spoke that night in his typically understated style, he seemed to suggaest that, instead of achieving this age-old dream of mankind, he and Orville had been merely participants in an ancient and ongoing human struggle.\n\nMyth and Religion\n\nFrom the beginning of recorded history, the theme of flight can be found in myth and legend, as well as in art, literature, and organized religion. Almost every culture has its own version of winged angels and devils, horses and dragons, as well as flying carpets and chariots. The world's folklore is replete with stories of soaring gods and flying heroes who, unlike humans, are able to navigate what Wilbur called “the infinite highway of the air.”\n\nThe exhibition begins with the classic flying myth of Daedalus and Icarus, and uses rare books, prints, and manuscripts to look at the idea of flight through ancient times. The exhibition brings to light a strikingly symbolic uniformity—that the idea of flight suggests freedom and connotes supernatural power in most cultures.\n\nBack to top\n\nWinged Creatures\n\nBack to top\n\nEarly Science\n\nFrom the beginning of recorded history, the theme of flight can be found in myth and legend, as well as in art, literature, and organized religion. Almost every culture has its own version of winged angels and devils, horses and dragons, as well as flying carpets and chariots. The world's folklore is replete with stories of soaring gods and flying heroes who, unlike humans, are able to navigate what Wilbur called \"the infinite highway of the air.\"\n\nThe exhibition begins with the classic flying myth of Daedalus and Icarus, and uses rare books, prints, and manuscripts to look at the idea of flight through ancient times. The exhibition brings to light a strikingly symbolic uniformity—that the idea of flight suggests freedom and connotes supernatural power in most cultures.\n\nHot Air Balloons\n\nThe attempt to conquer nature through science led to a growing body of both serious and imaginative literature regarding flight, setting the stage for the first successful aeronautical idea—the concept of lighter-than-air flight. The display briefly reviews the history of balloons culminating in the Montgolfier brothers’ successful manned ascent at Versailles in 1783, witnessed by Benjamin Franklin. The dream was still only partially realized since, as Benjamin Franklin presciently remarked, these great bags of gas and their airship successors “must always be subject to be driven by the Winds . . . .” In short, balloons could rise, but horizontal flight was not in their control.\n\nBack to top\n\nLighter Than Air\n\nAchievements and Sacrifices\n\nRealizing the dream of flight by achieving powered, sustained, and controlled flight in a heavier-than-air machine would prove difficult and costly. The exhibition briefly surveys those experimenters and achievers of the nineteenth century who paved the way for the Wrights. These included the English pioneer of aerodynamics, Sir George Cayley; the German gliding pioneer, Otto Lilienthal, who plunged to his death during an unsuccessful glide; and the French-American engineer, Octave Chanute. Their efforts culminated in the Wrights' successful flights on a wind-swept dune in North Carolina in 1903.\n\nBack to top\n\nDirigibles and Gliders"
