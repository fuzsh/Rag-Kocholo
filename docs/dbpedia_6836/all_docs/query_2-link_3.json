        "text": "This was brought up in the Misc. memorial thread for Sen. John Glenn.\n\nThe 1983 movie is one of my favorites of the '80s, and probably the film from that decade I have seen the most. My friends and I went to see it several times, which was unusual for a three-hour movie. It has a really winning mix of drama and humor, and even satire. A lot of great performances, aside from the leads: Jeff Goldblum and Harry Shearer as an odd-couple astronaut recruiting team, Donald Moffat as LBJ, the great musician and singer Levon Helm as Yeager's flight test partner, good old Royal Dano as the \"clergyman of death.\"\n\nThere was some talk in the other thread about how accurate Tom Wolfe's book was. I think the book was aiming to tell an \"overall true\" story about the Space Race with the background of the Cold War. It was based on extensive interviews, but of course different individuals have different versions of events, and some didn't want to talk. In addition to the X-1 and the Mercury program, it covers other test pilots like Scott Crossfield and Neil Armstrong with the X-15, and even a little into the \"New Nine\" class of astronauts. Even though Wolfe was not a technical guy and didn't get deep into the details of the air- and space-craft, and even though it doesn't have footnotes and citations, it stands up pretty well overall for what it is, IMO.\n\nThe Right Stuff is my favourite movie about anything to do with outer space. The Chuck Yeager stuff is awesome and I really liked his portrayal a lot. It's a movie, not a documentary and it makes no apologies for it. But the more Historical accounts that are put in there, only magnifies all of the achievement this movie puts on display. And to witness Chuck outliving his 15 minutes of fame, thanks to the pace NASA was setting at the time, really gave his story so much depth to it. When his wife reminds him that there are still mountains for him to climb, even if they aren't in NASA ... and he goes and takes that unauthorised flight on an experimental jet on his own ... I just love that. It's so iconic. This movie makes me want to believe the world can have Real Life Heroes, again. It's the coolest show about NASA that I've ever seen. But mostly ... I really just watch it for ol' Yeager ...\n\nI can't forgive the hatchet job that was done to Gus Grissom. In addition to being a test pilot, Gus was a Korean War combat veteran and an engineer, not some knucklehead that had a panic attack after his flight was completed. Real Oliver Stone-level bullsh*t there.\n\nYeah. Philip Kaufman has said he thinks Grissom was a true hero and personally thinks the loss of the capsule was probably not his fault. I think that the intention might have been for Yeager to have the final word on the subject: \"Ol' Gus, he did all right.\" But the way it was presented, it seems like the technical evidence is the final word, with the engineers saying that never in their experience had something like that happened. Even though I like the movie, I do have a problem with it there. The book was more balanced, and contrasted how Grissom was given the benefit of the doubt and Scott Carpenter wasn't (Carpenter's and Wally Schirra's flights, of course, didn't make it into the movie).\n\nStill, I thought Yeager, as the purest embodiment of the right stuff, understanding and effectively absolving Grissom, was a wonderful moment. Even if he had popped the hatch, he was a pilot performing an inhumanly hard and dangerous job, and he made it home alive. I have been in a few situations in life where the phrase \"Sometimes you get a pooch that can't be screwed\" seems to fit.\n\nPretty sure the NF-104 flight was every bit as authorized as any of Yeager's test flights. They didn't just keep fully fueled test rocket planes sitting around for anyone to borrow, and while Yeager may have done an occasional unauthorized barrel roll, he didn't go around stealing airplanes. But it made it more dramatic for the film.\n\nAnd I believe Yeager was the commanding officer of the test pilot school at the time, so, yeah, that's totally fictionalized.\n\nI thought the hatch on Gus' craft blew open by itself?\n\nAt least that's how From the Earth to the Moon presented it. During the Apollo One episode, Frank Borman (played by the VERY excellent David Andrews) is talking to one of the engineers who was on the review board following Gus' flight. The engineer said he was the one who found out Gus was telling the truth and that the hatch COULD blow by itself.\n\nThis was the reason why Apollo One didn't have explosive bolts that could have forced the hatch open (which would have saved the astronauts' lives). The engineer is very broken up over this, because if he hadn't proved Gus right, Apollo One would have had those explosive bolts - and thus Gus, Ed White and Roger Chaffee would still be alive...\n\nI thought the hatch on Gus' craft blew open by itself?\n\nAt least that's how From the Earth to the Moon presented it.

The engineer said he was the one who found out Gus was telling the truth and that the hatch COULD blow by itself.\n\nThe consensus belief now is that \"the hatch just blew,\" as Gus Grissom repeats over and over in The Right Stuff. On his flight, Wally Schirra blew the hatch on his capsule -- once it was out of the water -- and received bruises on his hands from doing so from the explosive bolts. Grissom had no bruises. Even though the Liberty Bell 7 capsule was recovered in 1999, parts of it had degraded in the salt water and couldn't shed light on the incident.\n\nIn retrospect, it's clear that NASA administrators didn't believe that Grissom blew his hatch. Scott Carpenter never flew again, and he had the bad luck of flying a capsule that was leaking attitude propellant (for which he was blamed), while Grissom flew on Gemini and would have flown on Apollo had it not been for the fire despite his Mercury capsule sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic.\n\nEvery Christmas for some reason (probably linked to the fact that for a number of Christmases and birthdays which also falls in December, I had space-themed presents - books, films, documentary videos) I get an urge to watch documentaries and films of the space programme. The must sees are 'Marooned' & a documentary called 'Moonshot' that was made by Turner TV many years ago based on a book of the same name by Alan Shepard & Deke Slayton. There's also 'Space Race' which was a 4-part drama documentary made by the BBC about a dozen years ago about the moon race, 'NASA's Greatest Missions', 'Apollo 13' and 'The Right Stuff'. I don't always get to watch them all because of competing demands apart from the first two which as I said are must sees, but for the first time in a couple of years I managed to watch the special edition DVD of 'The Right Stuff' and several of its extras. I've also listened to some of Tom Conti's brilliant score. It's a brilliant (if in place inaccurate) film which probably camps some of it up and gives dialogue to different characters from the book, but I still like it. On the basis of this film the VFX team of Gary Guttierez went on to do 'Top Gun's' VFX.\n\nAccording to the extras, at one point the film was 5 hours long (I wouldn't mind seeing that cut, maybe it includes footage of Carpenter & Schirra's flights) and on another extra, Wally Schirra does indeed talk about the treatment of Grissom by the film in less than glowing terms. The funny thing is from what I've seen and read, had he lived it's very likely Gus Grissom, not Neil Armstrong would have been the first person to walk on the Moon and I might be called Virgil or even 'Gus' instead. I also own the book itself. I tried in vain for many years to get it from my local library before getting my hands on a second-hand paperback copy with a film tie-in cover many moons ago. I've since given that away to a jumble sale and about fifteen years ago bought a large format hard cover copy that is fully illustrated and which I heartily recommend chasing down.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Right-Stuf...id=1483370181&sr=1-9&keywords=the+right+stuff\n\nAnother book of the same type as 'The Right Stuff' is 'A Fire on the Moon' by Norman Mailer. I have an illustrated coffee-table version of that entitled 'Moonfire' which I'm eager to re-read when I get the chance.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Norman-Mai...370230&sr=1-1&keywords=moonfire+norman+mailer"
