It also depicts their family lives and the personal crises they endured during an era of great political turmoil and technological innovation.\n\n\"Rarely has a film made a historic accomplishment seem so vivid and personal... It makes you wonder, quite suddenly, why there aren't more movies like this.\" â€”Arthur Knight, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nThis screening is dedicated to the memory of astronaut William Anders, Apollo 8 crew member and founder of the Heritage Flight Museum in Burlington. Thanks to the groundwork shown in The Right Stuff, Lunar Module Pilot Major William Anders -- with Commander Colonel Frank Borman and Command Module Pilot Captain James A Lovell Jr. -- became the first people to leave Earth's orbit and travel around the Moon.\n\nDirected by Phillip Kaufman\n\nStarring Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Barbara Hershey\n\nUnited States | English | 1983 | Drama, Biography | 193 minutes | PG\n\nFilm Prices\n\nSUNDAY BARGAIN PRICES:\n\nGeneral: $9.50\n\nChildren 12 and under: $8.00"
