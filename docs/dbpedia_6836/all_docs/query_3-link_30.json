        "text": "The Wright brothers—you may have heard of them. But who exactly were they and what did they do?\n\nThe invention of the airplane by Wilbur and Orville Wright is one of the great stories in American history. The Wright brothers’ invention not only solved a long-studied technical problem, but helped create an entirely new world.\n\nCreating the First Heavier-Than-Air Powered Aircraft\n\nThe desire to fly is both ancient and universal. For centuries, humans took to the sky—by balloons, kites, and gliders. The Wrights took flight to the next level with the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft. At the center of the story of the first heavier-than-air powered flight are two talented, yet modest, Midwestern bicycle shop owners who created a world-changing technology: the Wright brothers."
