Back in 1963 (I was just turned 8) a family friend in West Germany sent us a Christmas parcel (I learnt later this was usually done for relatives in East Germany so Britain and Germany have not changed much in nearly 60years). My part of the parcel was a big orange box containing an 18inch long truck/trailer carrying an Atlas missile and Mercury missile.\n\nI still have the toy minus its fragile box but Ebay provides these photos. It got me hooked on space stuff which I have collected ever since. It is a toy so the TEL is fictional but its still a nice Atlas with detachable Mercury capsule.\n\nAttachments\n\nSiku-Plastik-V179-Raketentransporter-mit-Atlasrakete-und-Mercury-Kapsel-_1.jpg\n\nvintage-rocket-transporter-atlas_1_5c05f6a69ee58cb18e5dca6adb094fb4 (1).jpg\n\nvintage-rocket-transporter-atlas_1_5c05f6a69ee58cb18e5dca6adb094fb4.jpg\n\nArchibald\n\nACCESS: USAP\n\nJoined\n\n6 June 2006\n\nMessages\n\n12,394\n\nReaction score\n\n14,913\n\n26 August 2020\n\n#5\n\nImagine a crossover between the two series - For all mankind and The right stuff...\n\nFor all kind men, who have the right stuff.\n\nuk 75\n\nACCESS: Above Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n27 September 2006\n\nMessages\n\n5,948\n\nReaction score\n\n5,963\n\n26 August 2020\n\n#6\n\nwhile you are waiting try a bit of 1967 space drama here.\n\nSecret Sanctum of Captain Video\n\nA historical look at various incarnations of classic tv and movie science fiction/fantasy including comics and videos.\n\nI suggest getting your favourite childhood tipple and snack to hand while you read\n\nfightingirish\n\nACCESS: Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n3 June 2006\n\nMessages\n\n2,917\n\nReaction score\n\n2,974\n\n11 October 2020\n\n#7\n\nSorry folks,\n\nunfortunately I can not recommend this new series, even after seeing just the first two episodes via VPN on Disney+.\n\nThis is just a not so convincing rehash of the original movie \"The Right Stuff\" and the TV series \"From the Earth to the Moon\", added with more fictional bits and drama like the moral rivalry between the two characters, the \"boy-scout\" Glenn and the \"womanizer\" Shepard.\n\nTomS\n\nACCESS: Above Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n16 April 2008\n\nMessages\n\n8,833\n\nReaction score\n\n11,975\n\n11 October 2020\n\n#8\n\nSorry folks,\n\nunfortunately I can not recommend this new series, even after seeing just the first two episodes via VPN on Disney+.\n\nThis is just a not so convincing rehash of the original movie \"The Right Stuff\" and the TV series \"From the Earth to the Moon\", added with more fictional bits and drama like the moral rivalry between the two characters, the \"boy-scout\" Glenn and the \"womanizer\" Shepard.\n\nYou had more fortitude than my wife and I. We bailed about 30 minutes into the first episode because it was just boring.
