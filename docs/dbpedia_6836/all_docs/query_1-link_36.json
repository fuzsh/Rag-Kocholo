        "text": "‘Sign Here’\n\nStream it on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe rom-com/sci-fi subgenre is on a roll. For a nice date night double bill, you could do worse than pairing the very funny “Molli and Max in the Future” with this bittersweet take on dating and relationships. The Mexican director Enrique Vázquez’s debut feature is set in a near-future when common wisdom holds that relationships last four years before souring. Whether or not couples still get along by that point, they split and people look for another partner. Getting ready to embark on a new contract, as relationships are now called, Fran (Regina Blandón) makes up answers to her matchmaking questionnaire, which messes up the algorithm. She ends up being paired with the sweetly dorky Roque (Leonardo Ortizgris), even though they don’t seem to share much. But maybe love is not based on perfect sync, after all, and maybe it can last longer than four years. Or can it?\n\n“Sign Here” creates a realistic world in which getting to know someone is simultaneously very simple and very complicated. But the movie’s best trick is to make us just as invested in what’s going to happen to Fran and Roque as they are.\n\n‘The Animal Kingdom’\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\nAnd “hybrid” is the perfect word here: We are immediately plunged into a world in which some people have started turning into animals. François (Romain Duris) and his 16-year-old son, Émile (Paul Kircher), move to a new town in the south of France to be near their wife and mother, who has been put in a specialized center after she mutated and attacked Émile. Soon, however, the teenager realizes that his own body is beginning to change. Cailley doesn’t explain how this all began and doesn’t get lost in practical details, either. Instead, he focuses on the human element, turning “The Animal Kingdom” into an allegory about difference, and how we handle those who are other. It’s no spoiler to say that acceptance and ostracism duke it out, though that makes this haunting movie sound more didactic and heavy-handed than it actually is.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
