work that an airline does is safely transport people from point A to point B.\n\nIf that's the essential work of an airline, then the essential work of a flight attendant is about safety.\n\nIt

rule for flight attendants.\n\nBRODIGAN: As it turned out, they had to give me all of my back pay, and they had to pay my lawyer's fees.\n\nCOBBLE: Flight attendants had achieved a lot in terms of gaining certain workplace rights.\n\nBut there was a lot more to be done.\n\nGRANT: In the earlier days, aircrafts were smaller, so therefore it was very important to have a weight limit.\n\nYou have

flights.\n\nThey did not have weight check.\n\nThey were able to wear eyeglasses.\n\nAnd they always had single rooms.\n\nThere was no reason why a female could not be a purser.\n\nMAN: Remove your jacket from its package and place the jacket over your head.\n\nTIEMEYER: If you were a woman that wanted to make a career out of flying, your natural inclination would be to move to the purser position because of the better pay.\n\nBut certain airlines, like Northwest, refused to hire women for the purser position.\n\nINMAN: In 1967, Northwest hired five men off the street to be pursers.\n\nI called the director of Labor Relations and I said, \"The contract requires you to post these purser job positions to everyone,\" which he did.\n\nThe men made the stewardesses feel that they were not entitled to the job, and they could not handle the job of purser.\n\nI realized as master executive chairman that someone had to do it.\n\nSo I applied for the job.\n\nI became the first and only female purser with Northwest Airlines.\n\nWhen I became a purser, I actually took a pay cut.\n\nThe male pursers were getting $250 more per month.\n\nIt was not fair at all.\n\nWhy should I be treated differently than the men?\n\nMy whole thought was, I am right and they are wrong.\n\nAnd as long as I am right, I will pursue this.\n\nMichael Gottesman was an expert in labor law.\n\nI made an appointment to see him.\n\nOur expertise was labor law and employment law.\n\nWe were the logical people to call.\n\nINMAN: I laid out the whole picture of the discrimination and how we had no

man holds it, they call it a purser.\n\nIf a woman holds it, they call it a stewardess.\"\n\nIt would have been a good case, even if it was just the way they had treated Mary Pat, but it was a much bigger case.\n\nIf they were paying a hundred men a higher amount for doing the same work, then every female flight attendant would be entitled to the higher pay.\n\nINMAN: We filed a class action lawsuit on July 15, 1970.\n\nWe originally had 40 people to file the suit.\n\nThat guaranteed us a class action.\n\nGOTTESMAN: You have to convince the judge that this would be an appropriate class action, that all of the people have the same grievance.\n\nAnd Mary Pat led the effort.\n\nShe was fantastic at organizing.\n\nINMAN: We had to educate people that we were on the right side of the
