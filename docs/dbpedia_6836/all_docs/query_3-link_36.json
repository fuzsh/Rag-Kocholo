        "text": "According to Indian legend, the Thunderbird was a giant eagle (some envisioned a hawk) that was spoken about with great fear & respect. When it took to the skies, the earth trembled from the thunder of its wings and bolts of lightning shot from its eyes. Nothing in nature could challenge the bird of thunder. The story of the Thunderbird was repeated across generations…and today, it is now a legend.\n\nThe legend will take to the skies this summer in Battle Creek, Michigan as the thunder (known as the Sound of Freedom) and will represent not only the professionalism of the U.S. Air Force, but the patriotism of our great nation of the United States.\n\nThe “thunder” will come from six F-16 Fighting Falcon jets painted in Red, White & Blue colors with the Thunderbird emblem on the bottom. Their show will rock the skies as the Diamond formation (Jets 1-4) perform a series of precision maneuvers, keeping their aircraft just INCHES from each other. This is in concert with the high speed & high G maneuvers performed by the Solos (Jets 5-6). This includes a series of head-on passes & solo maneuvers showcasing the tactical profile of the Block 52 Viper. In the end, all six jets team up and showcase the pinnacle of formation flying, the Delta Formation.\n\nThe Thunderbirds will be rocking the Battle Creek skies numerous times throughout the week. That’s MULTIPLE TIMES THE THUNDER!!\n\nOfficers:\n\n#1 (Boss/Commander/Leader): Lt. Col. Nathan Malafa (Michigan Native)\n\n#2 (Left Wing): Maj. Zachary Taylor\n\n#3 (Right Wing): Maj Tyler Clark\n\n#4 (Slot): Maj Jake Impellizzeri\n\n#5 (Lead Solo): Maj Eric Tise\n\n#6 (Opposing Solo): Maj Jeffrey Downie\n\n#7 (Operations Officer): Lt. Col. Taylor Wight\n\n#8 (Advance Pilot/Narrator): Maj Bryce Turner\n\n#9 (Flight Surgeon): Maj (Dr.) Jacob Hall\n\n#10 (Executive Officer): Capt Randi Winther\n\n#11 (Maintenance Officer): Capt Natalee Winton\n\n#12 (Public Affairs Officer): Maj Krystal Jimenez\n\nThe Thunderbird Mission as well as aerial demonstrations wouldn’t be possible without the work of more than 120 enlisted members from nearly 30 different career fields. They are the backbone of the team, ensuring all jets and operations are in top shape at all times. To learn more about the Officers & Enlisted members that make up this elite squadron, please visit: https://www.airforce.com/thunderbirds/our-team\n\nBased at Fort Liberty, North Carolina “The Home of the Airborne”, the Golden Knights will help open our air shows in Battle Creek with the National Anthem Jump and more. They will then return later in the show and perform a show filled with aerial skydiving maneuvers that will amaze everyone in attendance. From a baton exchange, to canopy relative work, to high speed freefall, this is a skydiving show that showcases the excellence of the United States Army Airborne.\n\nThe 16 member team coming to Battle Creek will be accompanied by a US Army C-146A Jump Ship that you will also see perform a fly by following the final jump of the day.\n\nFor more information on the United States Army Golden Knights visit https://www.goarmy.com/golden-knights.html\n\nHowever, that program was cancelled, so the “Super Hornet” was proposed. The Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a twin engine, carrier-capable, multi-role fighter aircraft that is based off of the design of the F/A-18 Hornet. The aircraft was initially designed by McDonnell Douglas and first flew in 1995. Full-scale production began in 1997 and the Super Hornet entered service in 1999 to aid in replacing the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. The Super Hornet serves in the fleet alongside the Legacy model Hornets. While the Super Hornet and original Hornet share many similar characteristics, the Super Hornet is a beast in itself, coming in at 20% larger and 7,000 pounds (empty) heavier than the original F/A-18 models. In fact, the Super Hornet weighs only 11,000 pounds less than the massive F-14 Tomcat that it replaced. The Super Hornet is also designed for a heavier payload and higher range and is capable of refueling other aircraft via a system known as “buddy store”. In addition to it filling a tactical airborne tanker role, the aircraft has a payload almost matching the mighty Grumman F-14 Tomcat.\n\nThe Super Hornet is sometimes referred to as the “Rhino” to distinguish itself from the earlier model Hornets. The Super Hornet is powered by the General Electric F414 Engine, which provides the loud thunder that you will hear over Battle Creek. Those engines also help propel the aircraft to fly at speeds almost twice the speed of sound.\n\nThe Super Hornet is one of the most sought after military demonstrations on the air show circuit each year. This year, you’ll only be able to see the Super Hornet at a handful of air shows, and Battle Creek is proud to have been selected.\n\nThe A-10 Thunderbolt II is the first Air Force aircraft specially designed for close air support of ground forces. They are simple, effective and survivable twin-engine jet aircraft that can be used against light maritime attack aircraft and all ground targets, including tanks and other armored vehicles. Seeing the A-10 in the skies above Battle Creek will be a welcomed sight to many as the OA-10 Thunderbolt II was the aircraft used by the 110th Fighter Wing based at Battle Creek’s Air National Guard Base from 1991 to 2009.\n\nThe A-10 is an aircraft that was designed by Fairchild Republic for a close-air support role. The aircraft, originally designed to improve on the performance of the A-1 Skyraider, was designed around the 30 mm GAU-8 Avenger rotary gatling gun that protrudes from the nose of the aircraft. The pilot essentially sits in what is known as a “titanium bathtub”, made with 1200 pounds of titanium armor. This protects the cockpit and aircraft systems, which essentially means the A-10 was designed to absorb significant amounts of damage yet still continue to fly. One such story has a connection to Battle Creek. While serving in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, Major Gary Wolfe was piloting an A-10 from the 110th in Battle Creek when Major Gary Wolfe’s aircraft was struck by an enemy surface-to-air missile. The missile impacted one of the engines. Major Wolfe was able to get the aircraft back to Talil Air Base, a testament of how great these aircraft were designed.\n\nThe aircraft is given the nickname of “Warthog” because it has no problem “getting down and dirty”. The aircraft provides close air support of friendly ground troops, attacking armored vehicles and tanks and providing extremely quick and efficient support against ground forces of the enemy. Being able to fly low, with the durability of the aircraft and its support close to the action, it definitely lives up to its name. In addition, with its quiet turbofan engines that provide a whistling noise, the A-10 can sneak up to targets.\n\nThe A-10 coming to Battle Creek this summer is coming from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. The pilot will be Major Lindsay “MAD” Johnson. Maj Johnson commissioned through the United States Air Force Academy in 2014 where she earned a Bachelor of Science in Behavioral Sciences – Human Factors. She has since earned a master’s degree in aviation safety from the Florida Institute of Technology. Maj Johnson has served in Texas, Korea and Arizona. As a veteran instructor pilot, she has amassed over 1,380 flight hours, including 431 combat flight hours in support of both Operation Freedom’s Sentinel and the Resolute Support Mission. Prior to her current position, Maj Johnson was an Instructor Pilot and Flight Commander, 357th Fighter Squadron, Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona.\n\nThe F-35C Lighting II Demo Team will come to Battle Creek from VFA-125 “Rough Riders” based out of Naval Air Station Lemoore in California.\n\nThe Lockheed Martin F-35C Lighting II is a F-35 variant that is designed for catapult-assisted take-off and arrested recovery operations from aircraft carriers. You’ll be able to see the difference between the F-35A and F-35C just based on wing size alone, as the F-35C features larger wings with foldable wingtip sections. This larger wing area also helps allow decreased landing speed while increasing both range & payload. The C model also features larger control surfaces for improved low-speed control, stronger landing gear for carrier arrested landings, a twin-wheel nose gear, and a strong tailhook for arrestor cables. You’ll be able to see a simulated carrier landing of the F-35C during the demonstration.\n\nYou will NOT want to miss the “thunder” that the F-35C will bring to Battle Creek as two jets fill the sky at the same time. Don’t miss this demonstration of Naval Air Power during our 2024 Air Shows!\n\nSome airshows look great – Skip’s airshow is something you feel like a thumping, ripping drumbeat in the center of your chest. You’ll taste fuel, you’ll smell victory. High-performance, high-skill, and high “totally-awesome,” Skip and his plane will tear through a high alpha pass on takeoff, then proceed to rock the most jaw-dropping maneuvers down to 1-foot off the ground. PROMETHEUS doesn’t specialize in haircuts, but get ready for a close shave.\n\nAs the recipient of the 2013 Bill Barber Award for Showmanship and the 2015 Art Scholl Award, Skip Stewart has proven to be one of the most entertaining Airshow pilots in the world today. With over ten thousand hours of flying experience, being an Airline Transport Pilot, Boeing 727, and MD-11 Captain, a Certified Flight Instructor, having owned and operated an aerobatic flight school, earned Gold Medals in regional aerobatic competitions, served as Chief Pilot for a Fortune 100 company and with more than fourteen years entertaining airshow fans around the World, Skip feels comfortable saying that he is one of the very best in the business today. Skip’s flying has been featured in magazines that include Plane & Pilot, Smithsonian Air & Space, AOPA, Sports Illustrated, World Airshow News, Auto Pilot, as well as in multiple other domestic and international publications. Skip Stewart is the first pilot to fly an airplane under a jumping motorcycle at an Airshow and has participated in numerous exciting acts over the years.\n\nBill also serves as an Aerobatic Competency Evaluator, proving his dedication to aerobatic safety. When it comes to professionalism, there isn’t anyone quite like Bill. He’ll take to the Battle Creek skies in his Zivko Edge 540 aircraft. This aircraft is popular among aerobatic pilots, but Bill’s plane is different! His Edge 540 uses cutting edge paint technology. Bill has designed the spectacular look of his airplane using a paint that continuously changes color based on the constantly varying angles between the spectators, airplane and the lighting. The plane can be any one color and even be a mix of numerous colors at different times during the performance, changing from green, purple, blue, gold, yellow, pink, orange and everything in between. See how many colors you can count during our air shows.\n\nBill was also the 2021 Recipient of the International Council of Air Shows Art Scholl Showmanship Award. He was also the 2016 Recipient of what is considered to be the single highest honor an individual air show professional can receive, the International Council of Air Shows Sword of Excellence\n\nNathan Hammond joined SkyDancer Airshows in 1998 and quickly learned about skywriting and airshow flying. Nathan was born and raised in Rhinebeck, New York; home of the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome. The proximity to the Flying Circus Airshows lead to him earning his pilot’s licence at 17, logging over 7000 hours since (in many different airframes, old and new).\n\nWhy is the aircraft named GhostWriter? Good thing you asked, we have the answer below.\n\nGhostWriter actually established a career in the Air Show and Skywriting Industry as the Pepsi SkyDancer, then eventually the Oregon Aero SkyDancer (performed quite a few times here in Battle Creek). After Steve Oliver’s retirement in 2015, Nathan K. Hammond took the controls and has been captivating audiences with the smooth lines and raw horsepower of the unparalleled Super Chipmunk ever since. Nathan Hammond’s Day Show is Action Packed and full of Smoke and Noise! The larger size of GhostWriter fills the sky, and with a tightly choreographed ballet of Loops, Rolls, and Verticals, keeps the excitement at the air show center! But this amazing Day Show act isn’t the only thing he’ll be doing. He’ll also be doing some Skywriting.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the magical Night Air Show that is truly one of the best in the industry. You will NOT want to miss that!\n\nBack to the act, with a talented and well-known pilot such as Kyle gets behind the controls, you know you are in for a treat. Kyle Franklin will portray Ben Whabnoski, an annoying drunk who wants his airplane ride that is promised to him! Much different from your typical flying farmer routine, this routine will get everyone on their feet and roaring with laughter. The effort and skill Kyle displays is amazing to say the least. Most pilots only put a wingtip on the ground during ground loops. Kyle Franklin does it for fun so often, that his Cub needs skid plates taped on the wingtips! This is truly a show “stealing” act! It takes impressive skill to fly a plain this badly!\n\nDon’t miss this one-of-a-kind, wild and crazy, wing-tip draggin’, award winning comedy act! Kyle was the recipient of the 2017 Bill Barber Award for Showmanship presented by World Airshow News."
