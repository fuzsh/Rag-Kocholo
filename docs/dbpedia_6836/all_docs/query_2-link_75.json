        "text": "In order to better understand National Geographic’s The Right Stuff series, which debuts on Disney+ on October 9, I took three hours and 12 minutes out of my day to watch the 1983 film of the same name—the Oscar-winning film starring Ed Harris as John Glenn, Scott Glenn as Alan Shepard, Sam Shepard as Chuck Yeager, and Dennis Quaid as Gordon Cooper. I probably shouldn’t have. The film bowled me over with its portrayal of the stark realities behind the romance of spaceflight, which leads writer and director Philip Kaufman towards a cinematic grappling with the costs and limits of these men’s ambition, a struggle that unfolds on both cosmic and domestic fronts. It helps that the elements that make up the film—the score, the cinematography, the editing—create a tapestry that combines the majesty of the space program with the raw terror and physical comedy of the endeavor. The film is great, and it makes the weaknesses of the TV show stand out all the more clearly.\n\nThe series is also based on Tom Wolfe’s 1979 book on the origins of high-speed flight and the first space missions at NASA, but it's not attempting anything similar to the film. Chuck Yeager, the man who broke the sound barrier, doesn't appear at all. (Kaufman insisted on Yeager’s inclusion in the film script, and the famed pilot was a consultant on the film, so the exclusion is a notable departure.) The show skips much of the life-and-death drama of the early test pilots to jump to 1959, when NASA selected the astronauts for the Mercury program. Patrick J. Adams (perhaps best known as Meghan Markle’s former TV boyfriend on Suits) plays Glenn, the balding charmer with a natural on-camera personality. Jake McDorman plays Shepard by way of Don Draper—a womanizing boozehound who wants nothing more than to be the best astronaut in the program. Glenn and Shepard quickly single each other out as the leaders of the crew, and the latter in particular seems to see that as a challenge.\n\nElsewhere, there’s other interpersonal strife. Gordo Cooper (Colin O’Donoghue) has an unsettled feud with Gus Grissom (Michael Trotter, in a committed performance that is remarkably like the film’s Grissom, Fred Ward) that dates back to their war days. And Gordo’s estranged wife, Trudy (Eloise Mumford), a pilot herself, finds herself sucked back into the domestic performance of an astronaut’s wife to satisfy NASA’s idea of how space pilots should live.\n\nIn the five episodes of the eight-episode season released to critics, the Mercury 7 get a lucrative Life magazine deal and transform from underpaid pilots to national celebrities. The pressure changes them and alters their family dynamics, even as they inch towards the ultimate goal of sitting on top of rockets and launching themselves into the lower-to-medium stratosphere.\n\nHo-hum.\n\nSpace flight is fascinating, and The Right Stuff gives us some footage of rockets and physical tests that offer perspective on what these men are going through. But the series takes five hours to cover what the film does in about 70 minutes—and somehow leaves the viewer with even less insight into this world. The show is desperately lacking in grit; everything is washed with prestige-TV gloss and creeps forward with anticlimactic inevitability. Even if you’re not a space buff, you know the astronauts eventually do make it into space; in ten years, their successors are going to make it to the moon. In the effort to make a series out of this narrow episode in space history, the show invests heavily in minute character dynamics that rarely feel important or even entirely real. The state of Gordo and Trudy’s marriage is what offers the series the most suspense, and though that’s… interesting, it’s weird that The Right Stuff leaves so much of the more obvious drama of space flight on the table.\n\nIt does not help that cinematically, the show has little to offer. Every music cue is remarkably trite—really, it's as if someone has consulted a list of the most-used song cues to evoke a certain period, and then doubled down on it, repeating the “Mack the Knife” a couple of times just to really drive the period specificity home. The Mad Men vibe extends to more than Shepard’s characterization. Several actors from that show pop up in Right Stuff, including Aaron Staton, who plays Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra. And because so much of the story is interpersonal engagement on the ground, The Right Stuff mostly takes place in suburbia—purportedly the suburbs around Edwards Air Force Base, but aside from the palm trees, they really could be anywhere.\n\nThe show makes a concerted effort to magnify the wives’ stories (with mixed results, but okay) and in the fifth episode, introduces aviator Jerrie Cobb (Mamie Gummer), one of the Mercury 13, a corps of female astronauts that did the same training as the men but never made it to space. As The Right Stuff demonstrates, the astronauts of the space program were chosen as much for what they looked like, and what they represented, as much as for their physical and technical abilities—so it’s laudable of the show to attempt to include the stories of those near to the action who never got to be a part of it. But I couldn’t help but notice that Katherine Johnson—the Black mathematician whose calculations were so legendary that John Glenn wouldn’t board Friendship 7 in 1962 until she checked the numbers—is not featured in the series. (It’s possible she pops up in the three episodes I haven’t seen yet, but while there was a casting announcement for Gummer playing Cobb, there’s nothing for a potential Johnson.) The show’s efforts at inclusion are a little hamfisted, so maybe we’re better off? Still, it’s bizarre—in 2020, in a post Hidden Figures world—that the show lacks even a passing nod to her.\n\nIndeed, for all of its overt efforts and purported wokeness, this new version of The Right Stuff comes across as markedly less daring than the film when it comes to imagining these men, their wives, the space program, and the lived reality of the era. The proceedings are blanched with a kind of bland patriotism. Its investment is mostly in the elements of the astronauts’ story that can be converted to a somewhat elevated soap opera. The vision for the show is to tackle a different space program in each season—Gemini, Apollo, and so on. It could be worthwhile to see those stories. But I hope they find a way to make them soar.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
