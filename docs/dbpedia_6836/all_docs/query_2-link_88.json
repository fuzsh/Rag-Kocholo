        "text": "Overview... a smart-aleck astronaut on Project Mercury. Out of dozens of candidates, Shepard was one of seven men chosen for NASA’s first attempt at manned space flight. Although he’s a dedicated military man with a long career as a Navy test pilot, Shepard is also something of a comedian, cad, and thrill-seeker. But once he and his colleagues are thrust into the public eye, he has to adjust to a whole new level of scrutiny.\n\nPersonality... funny, blunt, competitive, and temperamental. Shepard is the jokester of the Mercury team, regularly performing off-color impressions or trying to lighten the mood with a wisecrack. But he can also be moody and stand-offish when things don’t go his way. Like all of the Mercury astronauts, Shepard has to learn to sand down his rough edges for the media as they present him as one of America’s new heroes."
