        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO GLENN FARR sits at a shiny silver metal table amid boxes of redand-yellow plastic film cores. For 12 hours a day, his world is the acrid environment of an editing room, where rolls of film twisting back and forth always leave a slightly burnt smell in the air.\n\nIt is Mr. Farr's job to braid old newsreels, National Aeronautics and Space Administration film of the astronauts, historical moments and the newly minted reality of actors playing the astronauts into ''The Right Stuff'' - the Ladd Company's $17 million movie about the first Americans in space which is due to open next spring.\n\nAlthough television has occasionally attempted something similar, this movie from Tom Wolfe's best-selling book is singular for a film in the age of real events with close-up shots by a Hollywood director in technical as well as dramatic terms. To Leave Audiences Shaken\n\nAn average 1-hour-54-minute movie contains approximately 10,000 feet of film. Stacked in bins on the walls of the cavernous former cannery that is ''The Right Stuff's'' headquarters are 600 fat rolls of stock footage - 500,000 feet of reality from the past. To get the 500,000 feet, Mr. Farr looked at ''hundreds of miles of film'' at the National Archives in Washington and at ''at least one million of NASA's nine million feet of film.''\n\nSome 10 percent of ''The Right Stuff'' will come from Mr. Farr's treasure trove of history. But it will not just be planes crashing and rockets launching, events too expensive for a movie to duplicate. Philip Kaufman, director of ''The Right Stuff,'' wants to mix the real with the fictional in a way that will leave audiences shaken and uncertain as to which is which.\n\nBecause most of what is happening in the film was happening historically for the first time - a world teetering on the brink of space - Mr. Kaufman wants the audience to be pushed, jarred and shocked with the recognition of the film's reality.
