        "text": "Flight attendants are the friendly faces that assist us through our time on an airplane. They teach us aircraft safety, answer questions, ease our fears, and provide exemplary service. But what are the origins of flight attendants? What about their distinctive uniforms? What role did they play in the fight for civil rights?\n\nThough a woman wouldn't pilot a commercial airliner until 1973, by the early 1930s women were entering the ranks of flight attendants. While Pan Am and other airlines employed men as flight attendants, Boeing Air Transport introduced the first women flight attendants in 1930. For a time, women would become synonymous with the flight attendant profession—largely because they could be paid lower wages than men, and because of sexist marketing practices which advertised beautiful woman to attract customers. As social changes swept the nation in the latter half of the 20th century, both women and men fought for equality and respect in the profession.\n\nFlight Fashion Throughout the 20th Century\n\nThe way flight attendants have dressed throughout history has often reflected the state of the country, and its relationship to commercial air flight as a whole. For example, at the onset of commercial air flight, flight attendant uniforms mimicked military styles in order to project a sense of authority and professionalism just as the rest of the flight crews' uniforms did.\n\nIn the 1960s and 70s, changing social attitudes in the United States paved the way for uniforms more aligned with the fashions of the period, such as mini skirts and go-go boots—though this also lead to exploitation of many female flight attendant who were used to lure male passengers to airlines. By the 1980s, with the deregulation of the airlines, and many years of fighting for gender equality, flight attendant uniforms had returned to a more conservative look, mimicking that of business-style clothing. Take a look through some of the various flying fashion found in the Museum's collection in the gallery below."
