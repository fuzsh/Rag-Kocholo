It just looked like the world was theirs. And I wanted that life.\n\nTRAINING FILM ACTRESS: I just can’t wait to see all the places I’ve heard so much about. Paris, Rome, Bangkok, Buenos Aires…\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nHow many small town girls like me looked at a flight attendant and thought, \"That's the best job in the world.\"\n\nTRAINING FILM ACTOR: Rosemary, I’d like to talk to you about your coffee service. You’ve been pouring from too high.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nNo other job offered as much freedom, with such a high cost of conformity.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY\n\nWe were not expected to have opinions. We were to serve and look glamorous.\n\nJOAN RIVERS: Where is the stewardess where a woman wants her, huh? Huh? Nowhere, busy with the men. Coffee, tea, what you will, hello, hello, hello.\n\nACTOR PLAYING PILOT: Heya, how ‘bout some coffee? And make it hot.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nSelling sex instead of safety.\n\nSUZANNA LEIGH: Oh, excuse us.\n\nSOUTHWEST STEWARDESS 1: Remember what it was like before there was somebody else up there who loved you?\n\nSOUTHWEST STEWARDESS 2: Remember?\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI hated that.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nAirlines hired these women who are independent and curious. And it's amazing to me that airlines would expect that they would be a docile group, because why would they be?\n\nNEWSCASTER JOHN CHANCELLOR: TWA has been shut down for more than a month by a strike of stewards and stewardesses.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nI don't think we realized what a revolutionary thing we were doing.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nStewardesses played a major role in launching the women's movement.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nThey took up economic issues, but they also focused on issues having to do with appearance, grooming and control over women's bodies.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nHow did these women go from conforming to gender stereotypes to fighting for gender equality in the workforce?\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was a TWA flight attendant. But I was an activist in the change. I was there.\n\nACT I\n\nScene 1: The Dream\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nOne of my best friends, she had a brother who bought this Corvette. We would be out on the road and she would say, \"Well, where do you want to go?\" I would say, \"Let's go to the airport.\"\n\nWhen I was in high school, I convinced my friend Nancy that we should go on a trip when our junior year ended. And that June, off we went. I shopped for a week for the outfit I was going to wear on the flight.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nMy first flight, I was about eight or nine. We were all dressed up, socks with the little lace all around the edges of it. I thought, \"This is just like Easter.\"\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI'd been on boats before and I thought, \"Well, this was going to be similar to a boat.\" When we started to roll, \"Oh, this is more like a rollercoaster.\"\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nI remember the takeoff. I remember playing with the air. You know, I had my own little vent, gently putting a breeze on my face. I couldn't believe when they gave me food, they put my breakfast down and it was delicious. Scrambled eggs and those little sausages and a fruit plate. And I just was dazzled from the minute I stepped on that plane.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI thought, \"Oh, this has to be what heaven feels like. I've got to be close to heaven.\" It was the most beautiful thing I had experienced, just being in the air.\n\nScene 2: Women’s Work - Stewardess Back Story\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nSo many of our advances as humans come from travel. It is an incredibly human impulse and yet it was really restricted for women until the 20th century.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nThese new technologies came around, enabling humans to move around, and women really wanted to be a part of it.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nEllen Church was a registered nurse, but she got her pilot's license. She knew that aviation was the future.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nBut because airlines refused to countenance that a woman could be a pilot, Ellen's idea was all right, if they're not going to let me be a pilot, at least maybe they'd let me be a flight attendant.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nIn the late 1920s, you see an experimental era, where some airlines are trying out different models of cabin service. The most obvious model would be Pullman porters.\n\nMIA BAY, HISTORIAN\n\nBut there's a longstanding association between technological know-how and white supremacy. And they do not think that Black people have the kind of authority to kind of help people through the challenges of flying.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nSo the airlines thought, we probably want white men because this might be a position where you would get promoted into management.\n\nGRAPHIC DATE: February 1930\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nEllen Church went to San Francisco to the office of what would later become United Airlines. And she went to an executive and she said, \"I think if there were nurses on airplanes, more people would fly. You're trying to attract passengers, but people think it's dangerous. People get sick. A nurse would be a calming person and we'd be able to take care of passengers.\"\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nPlanes weren't pressurized, so they flew under 10,000 feet. And that means you feel every bump. It was always turbulent.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nThere were no circulation systems. So you could smell hot oil, and the disinfectant used to clean up after airsick passengers.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nTo go from coast to coast it took 28 hours at minimum. Often planes would get grounded in the middle of nowhere, passengers would have to wait for several days until the weather cleared. It was really a big adventure, instead of a reliable way to travel.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nIt was a harrowing thing to fly. You couldn't get a life insurance policy to cover you if you flew on airplanes because the death rate was something that no one wanted to insure.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nThe idea is that if you're encouraging people to fly, especially men, at a moment when flying can seem very scary, if you put young white women on an airplane, then they're going to think, \"Well, if these young white women are fine with flying, I should be fine with flying too.\"\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nEllen Church was convinced that women would want to do this, and she was absolutely accurate. They showed up in huge numbers.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nThe focus on only hiring women had a lot of advantages, the airline executives thought.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThe airlines started to realize the passengers were more attracted to having a woman do the job for the charm that she brought, the attractiveness that she brought to an otherwise exceptionally unpleasant experience.\n\nScene 3: Girl Next Door\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nDuring World War II women had worked in all kinds of non-traditional jobs.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nWhen the soldiers and sailors came home, there was a concerted effort to push women out of the workplace.\n\nANNOUNCER: March of the troops! Masses of manpower! New York…\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nWomen who were poor or women of color ended up going back to lower paying jobs. Middle class women were expected to go home.\n\nROBERT YOUNG (FATHER): Margaret, I’m home!\n\nJANE WYATT (MOTHER): We’re in the kitchen.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nGrowing up in the 1950s, it was very clear to me what women's roles were supposed to be.\n\nNARRATOR: The American home. Today, it is perhaps the most important job in the world.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nIt was reflected in television, it was reflected in the books I read. It was reflected in the examples used in my school lessons.\n\nNARRATOR: Father Knows Best.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nI absorbed that. I didn't question it at all. It was just the way things were.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nAs a child, I used to dream of being a nurse. And then of course I wanted to be a mother. We were a happy family, so I thought that would be a nice thing to do, have children and have a husband and the picket fence and all that type of thing.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nThere were all kinds of different expectations for men and women. They were basically considered two different types of human beings.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nMen were supposed to be the leaders, the presidents, the newspaper reporters, people who took dangerous jobs, people who took important jobs. Women were expected to get married and raise a family. But, before that, it was expected that they would work at a number of lower level jobs, secretary, clerk, librarian, teacher, they were not expected to have careers.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nMy parents were opposed to my going to college. Their expectations for me were to get married, and have a family. They felt that the fact that I had been a good student, was already going to make it harder for me to find a husband.\n\nNARRATOR: Hm, is it that late? Dad will be here any minute. Better tell mother she’s needed in the kitchen. Brother is spending an hour before dinner catching up on his homework.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nMy parents could only afford to send one child to college and that was my brother.\n\nNARRATOR: Now, mother and daughter put the finishing touches on the dinner.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThat was the way parents thought at the time. My brother would go to college. I would go to secretarial school, get married and produce grandchildren.\n\nScene 4: Becoming a Stewardess\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nAfter World War II, the airline industry introduced the DC-6 with a pressurized cabin, so airplanes could now fly higher, smoother, faster, and also carry more passengers.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThe customer is going to experience flying as pretty comfortable. You have plush seats.\n\nSTEWARDESS: Would you like some dinner, sir?\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nAnd you're going to be served cocktails.\n\nSTEWARDESS: How about you, miss?\n\nFEMALE PASSENGER: Oh, this looks delicious.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThey were marketing comfort, which meant you don't need a nurse.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThis is the moment when this profession becomes heavily, heavily identified with women and almost exclusively populated by women.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nI remember in seventh grade I read this book, How to Become an Airline Stewardess, and the first line was, \"Would you like a boyfriend in every city in the world?\" And I was like, \"Yes, I would.\" But I also was like, \"I want to go to every city in the world.\"\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nBeing a stewardess was the best possible job for good girls who were craving something interesting, out of the ordinary.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nA woman could go to different places and see different things and really stand out. But at the same time, she was doing something that was still very stereotypically feminine.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nIf you were applying to be a stewardess, you were going to be scrutinized, first and foremost, for your looks.\n\nTRAINING FILM NARRATOR: To qualify on most airlines, she must be healthy, and of normal weight.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nYou got this chart and you wouldn't even get an interview if your height and weight was more than listed on that chart.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nIf you make it physically, then what they're looking for is someone who's going to take orders well. They need pliant employees.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nThe educational requirements for stewardesses really varied very much by airline. On Pan Am you had to have gone to college and you had to speak two languages fluently.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nMy dream flight attendant job was with Pan Am or TWA, and I was as good as hired with Pan Am, but I flunked the French test.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nWith TWA I made it through that grueling interview process, and when I got the acceptance letter it was beyond exciting.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThey flew us to Kansas City for six weeks. I arrived in January, freezing cold, snow up to here, the happiest girl in the world.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThe training was held in Miami. And the six weeks involved learning the procedures for services. How do you make coffee on the airplane? How do you work the ovens? How did you mix drinks? Where did you mix them? How did you pass them out?\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nThere were segments on understanding the physics of flight.\n\nSTEWARDESS TRAINING INSTRUCTOR: Should there be a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will be released automatically.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nThere were segments on safety.\n\nSTEWARDESS TRAINING INSTRUCTOR: …Fastening and tightening, and I’m going to show you the brace position.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nPart of our safety training was on mock-up planes.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThey had recordings of people screaming. They could put smoke coming through. They could really make you feel like you were in a plane crash.\n\nSTEWARDESS TRAINEES: (unintelligible yelling)\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nYou have to be able to evacuate any aircraft within 90 seconds.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nThe airline knew that for a huge number of their passengers, this would be their first flight. They would be in a metal tube at 35,000 feet, and any fear that they felt was very justified, and so they wanted stewardesses to be very knowledgeable and specific in their ability to reassure a passenger.\n\nSCENE 5: Grooming\n\nINSTRUCTOR: Chins up. Stand up straight. Very good…\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nWhen women were first hired on airplanes, the sales pitch around them was that having a mere girl willing to fly would help sell tickets. By the '50s, the pitch had flipped. Prices were fixed by the government, the airlines had to compete based on image and perks.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nAirlines want to portray a vision of luxury and domesticity. Flight attendants really become the linchpin to that as hostesses.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nThey wanted someone who was stereotypically very beautiful. That was a way for an airline to distinguish itself and appeal to a largely masculine customer base.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nThe airlines really wanted a visual standardization of what a lovely stewardess looked like.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nWe all got our hair cut just the length of our chin bone. We were all supposed to look the same, both our hair, but also our makeup. Red lipstick, mandatory. There was an idea, I think, to make us into little machine parts and not think of ourselves as individuals.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIn our graduation photo we look like 20 mannequins sitting in two rows. When I looked at it I couldn't find myself. That was my- My first thing was, “Where am I in this photograph?”\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThe grooming supervisors were former flight attendants. Their whole job was to make sure that your high heels were three inches tall, that you had white gloves that were white, no runs in your stockings, your shoes were polished, not just the right heel height.\n\nJEAN MONTAGUE, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThey'd look you over and a gal would do like this to your buttocks to see if you had your girdle on.\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThey had this big piece of paper with appearance, hair, nails. You couldn't be too flashy.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nYou really need to have a good understanding of middle class deportment, speech, manners-- poise, as the airlines would put it.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThey told us they wouldn't hesitate to kick us out of that class if we didn't do the right things.\n\nSTEWARDESS TRAINEE ACTRESS: May I offer you a cigarette sir?\n\nPASSENGER ACTOR: Oh, no thanks, I have a fine cigar.\n\nSTEWARDESS TRAINEE ACTRESS: Well may I put it out for you then sir?\n\nPASSENGER ACTOR: Put it out? I just lit it!\n\nSTEWARDESS TRAINEE ACTRESS: Some of the passengers get a little… well you know how it is with people who don’t smoke cigars.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nAnd the right things included always being friendly to everyone.\n\nSTEWARDESS SCHOOL HOST: You see, you can handle just about any situation, if you’ll just smile, and really mean it, inside.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nIt's expected, it’s part of the job to act like your smile is genuine, and everything you're doing is because you like being a gracious hostess.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIf they didn't care for something you did or said or reacted to, they would wait until everyone was in class and they'd tap you on your shoulder, and they took you to your room, packed your bags, and they sent you home.\n\nScene 6: The Jet Age\n\nNARRATOR: The astonishing jet at last comes into its own in 1959. New York to Paris: seven hours. Here’s America’s Boeing 707.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nAll of a sudden you could be in Paris. You didn't take a ship that took weeks and weeks, it was hours.\n\nVICKI VANTOCH\n\nJets were really symbolic of technological advance. This was a sign that Americans were going to be able to take over the world.\n\nPAN AM PILOT: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We are now at cruising altitude, 35,000 feet.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nNow you've got a jet that can travel two times faster than propeller, and can accommodate more people. So this is imperative for the airline to start expanding their customer base, because they now have more seats to fill.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThey start to cater not just exclusively to the business traveler. They start to go, \"Well, what about bringing your wife? What about bringing your kids?\"\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nThis is the moment where flying is becoming mass transportation. That's the vision.\n\nPILOT: This is your Captain again. If you haven’t already changed your watches to conform to the time difference, I suggest you do so now.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThe jet age is technological, but it's also aspirational. It's a yearning on the part of ordinary Americans to participate in the glamorous lives of celebrities.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nSo a factory worker celebrating retirement after 30 years on the job, you could be like Sinatra and fly down to Peru, and have a glamorous vacation.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nStewardesses are at the center of jet age ad campaigns.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nThis is a new type of woman: she's sophisticated, she's very fashionable.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nEvery airline rolls out new uniforms. They call it the “jet age” look.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nYou see a crew walking in their powder blue uniforms with their pillbox hats and their high heels, and it was quite a sight to see. I mean, it was the definition of glamor.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\n\"Oh, you're a stewardess?\" You were just on the same level as a celebrity, movie star. It opened the doors to everything -- clubs, parties, you could crash a wedding and say you were a stewardess.\n\nScene 7: On the Job and Loving It\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIf I wanted to fly with my friend Lynn and she was junior to me, I could adopt her seniority, and then we both could fly together.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nOr you could “trip trade,” if you knew you wanted to go to Paris with your best friend, you would trade to be on that trip.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI went to Paris, I went to Rome, I went to Athens. I flew to London and to Frankfurt a lot. There was so much to see and do. You could go to Vidal Sassoon to get your haircut and then you could go out for a really nice meal. It really changed me in terms of my palate. I used to go to a favorite restaurant in London so that I could eat the Tandoori chicken.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nWhen we landed, I was in Mexico City and could go to dinner. Wow. Get back on the airplane and fly into Central America. Oh my gosh. Pick up the newspaper from Guatemala and see what's going on there.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI became quite independent. I felt very comfortable moving around in these foreign cities.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nIn the '50s and '60s, women very rarely traveled alone. And working on a plane, especially internationally, gave you an excuse to travel completely freely. You were going to these foreign countries and checking into a hotel with your other fellow stewardesses, and then no one knew what you did until you had to show up at the airplane next.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nI had grown up in a very narrow, sheltered environment. I went out there and I was confronted with all the things that the world had to offer.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIt gave me a lot of self-confidence that I could just get on an airplane and go someplace, on my own and be quite happy. That wasn't true of everybody that I went to college with or I went to high school with, that they could do that or wanted to do it, but I wanted to do it, and I did do it.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nThis job was asking women for their ambitions. It was asking for a woman who wanted to see uncharted terrain. A woman whose curiosity was enormous, which no other feminized job in that era really wanted. It was incredible.\n\nAct II\n\nScene 1: Integrating the Skies - Patricia Noisette Banks Edmiston\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was kind of looking for something a little different in my life.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was looking at a fashion magazine and the magazine had an advertisement for the Grace Downs Air Career School in Manhattan.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI applied and I was accepted in 1956. Never had been on an airplane. So this was a part of, you know, I've never been on an airplane. This is great. This is great.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nWomen could pay the school and learn how to become an airline stewardess. The expectation, if you did well at the school, you would ultimately get hired, and get a job as a stewardess.\n\nSTEWARDESS TRAINING INSTRUCTOR: Now, this is the main cabin door where the passengers for first class will be…\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was the only student of color in the school.\n\nSTEWARDESS TRAINING INSTRUCTOR: … walking straight, they’d walk directly…\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThere were no Black teachers, no Black students. I remember we had a makeup class and someone made up my face. I have to laugh now because I was white. And when I looked in the mirror, I'm saying, \"Oh my God, how am I going to get home like this?\" They had no makeup, of course, for people of color.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen you would graduate, then airlines would come to the Grace Downs Air Career School to interview you, to put you into positions in their aircraft.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was interviewed by Mohawk Airlines, by Capitol Airlines, which was one of the largest southern airlines and TWA. Now, everyone was getting interviewed and people were getting hired, but I was not even getting a response from any of the instructors, or the airlines.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nShortly after the interviews one of the chief stewardesses saw me outside and she said to me, \"Pat, I hate to see you go through this,\" she said, \"But the airlines do not hire Negroes.\"\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe south, it was open, clear. That white people had this advantage, black people had no advantage. I’m in New York. It’s not as clear or vivid. Subtle, yes, you just didn’t know certain things. And then when the airline situation occurred, it just opened my eyes totally. Yes, it exists here.\n\nKEISHA BLAIN, HISTORIAN\n\nTraveling by air was very expensive and not easily accessible to most Americans in general, let alone African Americans.\n\nKEISHA BLAIN, HISTORIAN\n\nIt's not surprising that Pat Banks didn't have a full understanding of what was taking place.\n\nMIA BAY, HISTORIAN\n\nA lot of airports in the 1950s were either segregated or beginning to be segregated. Airlines sometimes used a special code. If people called from a Black neighborhood or if they sounded Black, then this special code would be written down on their ticket to indicate that they had to be seated apart from others.\n\nKEISHA BLAIN, HISTORIAN\n\nIn some instances African Americans would be bumped off of flights to make space for white passengers.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI went home and we had a neighbor, and I called him as soon as I got home and I said, \"Pop, they're telling me that they don't hire Negroes.\" He said, \"We'll take care of this.\" He introduced me to Adam Clayton Powell. Adam Clayton Powell referred me and introduced me to the The New York State Commission Against Discrimination.\n\nKEISHA BLAIN, HISTORIAN\n\nThere were no federal laws in place to protect against discrimination in the workplace.\n\nKEISHA BLAIN, HISTORIAN\n\nSo it was very important for Pat to file her case in New York because New York was the first state in the United States to pass an anti-discrimination law.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI filed a case against Mohawk, Capital and TWA. The statute of limitations had expired with Mohawk and TWA, but it held strong with Capital.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nDiscrimination is a very difficult thing to prove.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nAirlines don’t specify that they're not going to hire Black women, but they don't really need to, because manuals will say things like, \"Oh, are your hands soft and white?\"\n\nMIA BAY, HISTORIAN\n\nThey talk about how people shouldn't have broader flat noses. People shouldn't have hook noses. Coarse hair overly full lips - indicating certain kinds of racial stereotypes about Jews and Blacks. They actually include enough details to make sure that certain kinds of people really cannot get employed.\n\nScene 2: The Age Rule\n\nJEAN MONTAGUE, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen I was hired, you couldn't be married, period. We had a couple of gals that did it on the side, but you couldn't be married then, couldn't have children.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nFrom the very beginning, most airlines have an explicit ban on hiring married women.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nStarting in 1953, American Airlines impose a new rule that stewardesses will leave the job when they turn 32.\n\nELAINE ROCK, WRITER\n\nIt took a little while, but other airlines started adding the age rule too.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThey wanted us to be hired, do our job for a couple of years and leave.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nAirlines wanted women who projected a degree of wholesomeness, but also a little bit of sexual availability. They wanted her to be young so that she would appear to be single without having to say so.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nUnited had flights out of New York to Chicago called executive flights. Only men could buy a ticket on those planes.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen I went for my interview with TWA I signed a paper, which they presented to me, and on it said that I would be retired at the age of 35.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\n35 was a long ways away. I thought I would be married with children. That was the expectation: You would meet Mr. Wonderful in first class and you'd be swept off your feet, et cetera, and that would be happiness ever after.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThe requirement to be unmarried, the requirement to stay under a certain age, it’s really about making sure that flight attendants are not getting paid top dollar. That they're not going to get a pension, they're not going to accrue vacation benefits that they would've gotten if they're in year 15 or year 20 of their career.\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIt was money, money, money. What do you think it costs to have an ace stewardess at age 32 top salary, maximum vacation, going to fly until she's 60, get a retirement?\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIf you're not married and having babies and happy to stay there, tough luck, honey.\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI didn't want to stop flying. Flying was exciting. God, it was that. It still is. But then it was really exciting.\n\nScene 3: Unions\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nFlight attendants start to organize in the late 1940s. They're unhappy with their wages, but they're also unhappy with being patronized by the airlines.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nPretty quickly they began to realize that they would have greater bargaining leverage if they joined with some of the other workers. The pilots set up a division for stewards and stewardesses and some of the flight attendants went into the Transport Workers Union.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nUnions just weren't something I thought of. When I was in training, I failed the section on the contract. I didn't understand it and I didn't understand it until I started flying. And I realized how the company took advantage of stewardesses.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nBeing from Pittsburgh, I was quite familiar with unions. And so there would be a union\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe grievance procedure was an orderly settlement of a dispute. I thought, “Hmm, this is interesting. I kind of like that.”\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nFlight attendants and pilots and baggage handlers wanted to be paid fairly, they wanted more control over their hours, their flight time. But flight attendants also had problems that the men didn't face.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nWhen American Airlines said, we're going to put it in the contract that flight attendants can't work past the age of 32, the union pushed back. The rules still went in. But what they did win was a compromise, what they called a grandmother clause, so that any flight attendant who had been hired before 1953 could continue on. It saved a lot of jobs.\n\nELAINE ROCK, WRITER\n\nDusty wasn't required to retire when the age rule came in. She had nothing to lose. She said, \"I want to fight this. This is wrong.\" And that was her motivation to join the union.\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nMy family was very Republican and unions were naughty, naughty, naughty, terrible. Nobody in my family had ever belonged to a union. That was just, oh my goodness, we're college people, we don't join unions, oh!\n\nELAINE ROCK, WRITER\n\nShe became vice chair and would file grievances on behalf of other stewardesses.\n\nELAINE ROCK, WRITER\n\nDusty exuded this sense of confidence. She always spoke to anybody who would speak to her, and many men always did. Because she was so attractive, they wanted to know, \"Who is this woman?\"\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI figured out that the Congress was in session on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and then they went home on Friday. So I bid the Washington trip on Monday, and I'd always have a bunch of congressmen on board and they got to know me. \"Dusty, how you doing?\" I said, \"Oh, I'm really upset about this. My best friend's being fired because she’s 32\". They said, \"What? They fire you?\" Here these guys are 60.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nDusty, as she's flying, she's working her connections. She's leveraging the visibility of stewardesses to gain access to people who can pull levers of power in policy-making circles.\n\nACT III\n\nScene 1: Do I look like an Ol’ Bag to you?\n\nELAINE ROCK, WRITER\n\nIn 1963 Dusty decided to put on a press conference.\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nTo say the word “stewardess” in those days was glamor. Oh boy. Oh boy.\n\nELAINE ROCK, WRITER\n\nShe got four stewardesses that were under 32 and four stewardesses that were over 32.\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI said “Now they're firing us at age 32. Can you tell me which ones are 32?\" And of course they said, \"No, no, no, no.\" But I did look pretty good.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nThe idea is basically, “Hey, take a look at us. Don't we all look like lovely stewardesses?” It’s a kind of dare to the airlines' policy, can you really tell who's past the age limit?\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWe hit every newspaper in the country.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nThese women were really trying to use the sexism that was being wielded against them to get what they wanted, which was to keep their jobs.\n\nELAINE ROCK, WRITER\n\nWhen the stewardesses went into negotiation with the union and management, American Airlines came into the room with a stack of newspapers from all over the country and just plopped it down on the desk saying, \"That was an interesting stunt that you girls pulled. We're not going to negotiate the age rule now.\"\n\nJEAN MONTAGUE, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIt's terrible to be fired because of age. But I had hopes because I knew how smart Dusty was.\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI believed in fair play. Every club I ever was in, I became president. I was president of the women’s athletic council, and president of my sorority. I knew all the rules, and I went by them. And if I didn’t like a rule, we changed it.\n\nELAINE ROCK, WRITER\n\nDusty wasn't just fighting airline management in an age rule, she was fighting national gender discrimination.\n\nScene 2: Integration Part 2\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nOnce things began to hit the newspapers I would get letters. When I had threatening letters I had to report it to the police.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nYou kind of expect these things. You knew you were going to get focused on. You knew you were going to get letters of negativity. This is something - “oh, here it comes.”\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI just couldn't deal with the racism anymore. I couldn't deal with it. I didn't think it was fair. I'm just as equal to you as you are to me. We're one, we're humans, and you're not going to treat us this way anymore.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nPat’s plans were put on hold while her lawyers researched her case. They had to look at the supervisor notes and see who met what criteria, how did Pat compared to the other applicants.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nThey were trying to prove that she was the typical all-American girl: She played violin, she was respectable. So, the element that excluded her from that image of femininity and Americanness was her race.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was determined that somebody of African American heritage was going to get this job.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nFinally, in late February 1960, Pat got her ruling.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was working for Con Edison, going to college at night. And there was a little candy store on the corner where I used to get the bus to go home. When I got into the candy store, the man in the store said, \"Pat, Pat, you won the case, I couldn't wait to get home. My mother says, \"Patsy, the phone is ringing off the hook. You won! You won! You won!\" Oh my God.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe court ordered Capital Airlines to hire me, or it would go to the Supreme Court.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe president of Capital Airlines called me. I don't remember his name, but he called to apologize and welcome me into training in Alexandria, Virginia [laughs].\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nYou know, it was like, \"We did it. They can't get away with this anymore.\"\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI'm young now. I like to hang out with friends and do things. But I had to be this perfect human being. And the only way I could do that was to do my job, go home, come back. I wouldn't do anything that may have led to a mistake.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI remember we were on a DC3 and DC3s are kind of bumpy. This man looked at me and he said, \"When you finish doing your work, would you please hold my hand?\" And I said, \"Sure sir, I'll sit down with you.\" So he held my hand and he asked me, he said, \"Have you ever been to Montana?\" I said, no, sir. He said, \"The grass is so beautifully green, the trees are so green.\" He said, \"No n****** and no winos.\" I'm holding his hand now. Now, the word n***** is something you never touch me with, but by the power of God I was able to sit there and hold his hand and not respond. I mean, I didn't respond until I got home that night. But these are the kind of situations that occurred that you had to really, really keep it together.\n\nPAT NOISETTE BANKS EDMISTON, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI worked for a year. I wanted to go on with my life, finish school. I was planning on getting married, so I decided to leave. I felt it was accomplished, the barrier was broken.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nAny questions that any company may have had as to whether a negro was capable of doing the job, Pat set the record straight. We could go above and beyond doing this job.\n\nKEISHA BLAIN, HISTORIAN\n\nThe floodgates do not open. It really at that time is about saving face. It's about letting a few in to avoid more lawsuits.\n\nKEISHA BLAIN, HISTORIAN\n\nPat is very much part of a group of activists at the grassroots level who are pushing for changes, certainly at the local level but even more significantly at the federal level.\n\nMIA BAY, HISTORIAN\n\nPat's victory with the airlines takes place just as the civil rights movement is really heating up. Change is in the air…\n\nScene 3: Title VII and Sex\n\nGRAPHIC DATE: July 2, 1964\n\nNEWSCASTER: Congress passes the most sweeping Civil Rights bill ever to be written into the Law, and thus reaffirms the conception of equality for all men that began with Lincoln and the Civil War 100 years ago. The Negro won his freedom then; he wins his dignity now. Five hours after the house passes the measure, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is signed at the White House by President Johnson.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThe Civil Rights Act was designed to address the race-based inequalities that have been a part of the United States since before the United States was founded.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nLess known about the Civil Rights Act is that the worker protections to prevent discrimination also covered sex.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nJust before it was passed, Howard Smith, a congressman from Virginia, introduced an amendment to include prohibition on gender discrimination -- it was then called sex discrimination. This stunned everybody there, because this was a law that was supposed to help Black people.\n\nReporter: What is your opinion Mr. Chairman of the current civil rights bill?\n\nHoward Smith: Now, we've had trouble with the so-called civil rights thing for a good many years…\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nHis motivations were not clear.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nOne interpretation is that he did that to add this laughable idea of sex discrimination that would help tank the bill. The other interpretation is that he wanted to ensure if this bill was going to provide all these protections for Black Americans, that white women should get protection as well.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nIf that's the ugliness of the sausage making, I mean the sausage isn't that bad, right, because for the first time in the United States, we now have employment protections that are designed, really, to promote women entering professions that were otherwise reserved for men.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nOur eyes were like, oh, that is gender, that includes gender. Women have rights now.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThe passage of the Civil Rights Act was a major step forward. But the passing of a law is not enough. It's nowhere near enough. You comply with the law because you think it's a good way to live. You stop at a red light so people don't crash into each other, good. But if you pass a law that people don't want to obey, they won't.\n\nScene 4: The Battle Begins\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was set up to be the enforcement mechanism to make sure that discrimination in employment was not happening.\n\nEEOC EMPLOYEE: Good morning, this is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. May I help you?\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThe expectation at the EEOC when they opened their doors was that they were going to hear from a bunch of African Americans who had documented cases where their rights as a worker had been ignored.\n\nJEAN MONTAGUE, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was going to be fired at age 32.\n\nJEAN MONTAGUE, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nDusty and I went to the EEOC, so I could file a complaint. Dusty had heard they were opening that day, so we planned our flight to be there.\n\nJEAN MONTAGUE, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThere were people putting typewriters here and chairs there and getting it all straightened out. They had just opened the doors. They weren't really ready at all.\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWe were there the first day. This Black woman looked at me and she said, You’re free, white and 21, what are you here for? You have everything going for you.” So we said, \"Sit down, honey. I got a story to tell you.\" And we told them and they went, \"Ooh. Ooh.\" They couldn't believe it.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nI joined the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission October 4th, 1965, three months after the agency opened.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nI was the first woman attorney in the office of the General Counsel which dealt with answering the big legal questions that came up administering the law.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nWe had tons of complaints filed by the stewardesses.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThey had no idea what was coming, this volcanic kind of expression of a yearning for justice, of women keeping it bottled up for so long.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThey challenged the restrictions on age, the ability to get married. That you couldn't be pregnant and be a flight attendant. They filed complaint, after complaint, after complaint.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nWithin a year, flight attendants had more than a hundred cases on file.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nThese were not women who were setting out to break barriers for women. They just wanted to keep their jobs. But the EEOC was not taking these complaints based on gender very seriously.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nThere were commissioners who were favorable to women's rights. But, the Executive Director was opposed to women's rights, the Vice Chair was opposed. And on the staff level, I was the only woman speaking out.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nFrom an early age, I was sensitized to the second-class treatment of Blacks in this country. But I was blind to the second-class treatment of women in this country.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nI had never done anything or given any thought to women's rights, but I read the statute.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nThe law said, you have to handle cases of sex discrimination. You don't have a choice, when a law says something has to be investigated, to say, \"I don't feel like doing that part of the law\".\n\nScene 5: NOW\n\nJ. FRANK WILLIS: This book has sold more than 50,000 copies in the hardcover edition, and 700,000 have been published in paperback.\n\nJ. FRANK WILLIS: Betty Friedan, a trained psychologist turned housewife, mother and author\n\nBETTY FRIEDAN: The feminine mystique is the name that I have given to the image of woman that we have been living by in America and, in fact, in most of the Western world for the last fifteen or twenty years.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThe Feminine Mystique put words around the disquiet that a lot of women of a certain class were experiencing. It called to people's attention the reality that women who were smart and educated and could do so much were confined to one role once they were married and had children, and that was mom and wife.\n\nREPORTER: Ms. Friedan, do you think maybe society is right now in an age of evolution and of change?\n\nBETTY FRIEDAN: Oh yes, and I think-- no one’s going to hand women anything. I think women must begin to say yes to themselves, and become who they could be, and ask for society, the real solutions that women still need.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nBetty Friedan came to the EEOC because she thought she was going to write a follow-up book to The Feminine Mystique, about all the progress she thought women had made and she saw me there, a woman. So she came over to me, and she said, \"What's really going on here? What's happening?\"\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nI was feeling pretty down. I had had a discussion with the executive director who was opposed to women's rights. I asked her to come into my office and I leveled with her. I said, \"What this country needs is an organization to fight for women like the NAACP fights for its members.\"\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nHalloween weekend, 1966, 19 women and two men met in the basement of the Washington Post to form NOW: the National Organization for Women, which had been conceived in the summer.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nAll of us wanted women to be accepted in educational institutions on an equal basis. And we wanted women to be treated equally on the job.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nSonia started feeding information to two of the other NOW founders about what the EEOC was not doing about women's equality.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nThen, we would draft a letter, from NOW, to the EEOC, complaining about the EEOC's action in various sectors. I knew that wasn't proper procedure but I was so emotionally involved that I did it.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nTo my amazement, nobody ever raised the question of how come these people know what the commission is doing at its innermost meetings?\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nNOW took many directions to try to pressure the EEOC to enforce the law. They used demonstrations, they filed lawsuits. They went into the legislature to say, \"Hey, they aren't enforcing your law.\"\n\nScene 6: BFOQ\n\nREPORTER CATHERINE MACKIN: Ida Phillips is a waitress in Florida. She was refused a job at a defense plant because she had a preschool-aged child. The company felt the child, not yet in school, would keep Mrs. Phillips home from work too often. She took her case to court, and the Supreme Court has agreed to review it. The Supreme Court is involved because of the 1964 Civil Rights Law.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nOne of the things the EEOC did was to signal how the courts were going to think about things. Of particular concern for the airlines was whether they were going to have to change rules about marriage and age.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nIn Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, there is mention of a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nThat was a provision in the statute. And what it meant was for some jobs you don't have to hire men and women equally. For example, if you were hiring somebody as a wet nurse, you don't have to interview men for that job.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nThe airlines thought it was absolutely necessary for their business that they have only women and because they only had women, they really weren't discriminating.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nAirlines were very confident that the public liked having stewardesses on planes. They actually did surveys that showed that 80% of the flying public preferred stewardesses over stewards.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nThey pushed the EEOC to have hearings so they could clarify the situation.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nThey put on this whole elaborate defense: \"Men can carry trays, but they can't be charming. They can't create the liveliness and the atmosphere that young women can create.\"\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nAnd we argue that a man cannot do this in the same capacity whatsoever that a woman can. And therefore being a woman is essential for the job.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nThe Employment Opportunities Commission issues its opinion and it says being female is absolutely not a qualification for this job.\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nThen they had to issue the second decision which was, is it a violation of Title VII for airlines to terminate or ground stewardesses at the age of 32 or 35, or when they got married?\n\nSONIA PRESSMAN FUENTES, LAWYER\n\nI drafted the decision of the commission finding that it was unlawful.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nOne option for the airlines is to just give up and to change their hiring and firing policies. But if something is so dear to you, then you're going to fight.\n\nScene 8: I’ll See You in Court - Celeste’s Story\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was a doctor’s assistant in Washington, DC. I did all the bookkeeping. I did all the secretarial work.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI met Richard Lansdale. He was an attorney and I fell in love. That was-- I just fell in love with him. He said, “Why don't you get out of what you're doing now and become a stewardess?” I was working 60 hours a week and getting paid for 40 and no vacation, no sick leave. I had no benefits at all. So it seemed like a good thing to do.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI went to United and they hired me.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen I was hired stewardesses could not be married.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI thought it was wrong. Why can't you be married? Pilots can be married. Why is it okay for a pilot to be married and not a stewardess? What-- I don't understand, what's the difference?\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was secretly married for four years.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWe had observation reports called check rides, and you were evaluated on everything.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI remember there was a supervisor who gave me a performance evaluation. She said one of my problems was that I just was tenacious.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThey wanted someone who complied. You did what you were told to do and you didn't challenge them. I found it hard not to challenge them.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen they started giving me extra check rides, I thought, “They have to know I'm married and they're trying to get rid of me.”\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was off of work for nine months. I really never wanted to be a housewife. I wanted to get back in the air. Then one day, I said, \"To hell with this.\" And I went to the Miami Herald. And I said, \"Do you want a funny story?\"\n\nANCHOR:This stewardess married secretly, then when she admitted she was married, the airline fired her. She, the stewardess, said today, “they certainly have a funny set of morals.”\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen it hit the news, there was a group of stewardesses in Miami and they all wore wedding bands to work. They kind of ganged up on the company.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIt hit the fan in the executive offices in Chicago.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nFortunately, I had free legal services from my husband and I filed a lawsuit.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nFlight attendants are contesting age and marriage rules on a variety of airlines.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nFor the first couple of years, the judges who were hearing these sex discrimination cases really sided with the airlines almost unilaterally.\n\nPHIL TEIMEYER\n\nThen there's a crucial court decision where the judges determine, the essential work that an airline does is safely transport people from point A to point B. If that's the essential work of an airline, then the essential work of a flight attendant is about safety. It doesn't matter if you're a woman, it doesn't matter if you're under age 32. It doesn't matter if you're married.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nWe start to see a kind of consensus among courts and they start to rule for flight attendants.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nAs it turned out, they had to give me all of my back pay and they had to pay my lawyer's fees.\n\nACT IV\n\nScene 1: Weight Rules\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nFlight attendants had achieved a lot in terms of gaining certain workplace rights. But, there was a lot more to be done.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nIn the earlier days aircrafts were smaller, so therefore it was very important to have a weight limit. You had to filter in fuel, baggage, the weight of the passengers and you also had to add in the stewardess's weight.\n\nEXERCISE INSTRUCTOR: Remember to bend your knees.\n\nNBC TV REPORTER - SANDER VANOCUR: The girls who fly come in various sizes. The assortment is greater than most people think. They can be as tall as 5’9”, one airline takes girls as short as 4’5”.\n\nCELESTE LANDSALE BRODIGAN\n\nThey had a card, your appearance card. They weighed you in every month and put your weight down.\n\nANN HOOD, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nYou would just get off a plane, a supervisor is waiting for you with a clipboard. There's a scale at the bottom of the stairs, and if you were even one pound over your hiring weight, you were put on probation and you had three chances to lose that weight.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nI took water pills. I took diet pills. I starved. Those were some of the tricks that all of us did, all of us did.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nWe just passed the tricks around and said, \"Here, take this laxative, you'll lose three pounds.\"\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\n\"Oh, here. Take this Dexedrine Spansule. You won't be hungry all day.\"\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nJust for one pound, you could be taken off of payroll.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nNo one else at the airline except women were being held to this standard. If you're thinking of it in terms of a system of bodily control, this is pretty extreme.\n\nKATHLEEN BARRY, HISTORIAN\n\nAirline executives had approached flight attendants for so long in such a patronizing way. Even though so much had changed around them, airline executives don't seem to want to evolve with the times.\n\nScene 2: Selling Sex\n\nNARRATOR: When a Braniff International hostess meets you on the airplane, she’ll be dressed like this.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nAirlines had this stodgy, old-fashioned image that was dependable, reliable, but not hip or cool.\n\nNARRATOR: When she brings you your dinner, she’ll be dressed this way.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nBraniff hired Emilio Pucci to design stewardess uniforms.\n\nNARRATOR: The “Air Strip” is brought to you by Braniff International, who believes that even an airline hostess should look like a girl.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nThis ad was not just appealing to male business travelers. It's appealing to women who want to be young and fashionable.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nThis was really the beginning of an entirely new version of the stewardess.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nAirlines start to go, “how high can we go with these skirt lines?”\n\nSOUTHWEST AIRLINES ACTRESS: Remember what it was like before Southwest Airlines, you didn’t have hostesses in hot pants. Remember?\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nPrices were still fixed, so airlines wanted to get market share in any way that they could.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThere was one uniform that was a problem because if you bent over, cleavage would show. We're going around keeping our hand on our chest.\n\nVICTORIA VANTOCH, WRITER\n\nTWA introduced foreign-accent flights. They had four different designs for the uniforms, and they were all paper.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe paper dresses were either an Olde English Wench, a French Cocktail, an Italian Toga, or the Manhattan Penthouse. I was an Olde English Wench. Maybe they wanted us to speak like Chaucer or something, I don't know.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nYou had to kind of be careful, first of all, trying to get it on, that you didn't rip, which did happen sometimes. And you had to take off your other clothes in the tiny bathroom and then parade around in them. It was ridiculous.\n\nNATIONAL AIRLINES ACTRESS 1: I’m Diane. I’ve got 747s to Miami. Fly me.\n\nNATIONAL AIRLINES ACTRESS 2: I’m Terry. I’ve got great connections in Miami, all over the sunshine states of America. Fly me.\n\nNATIONAL AIRLINES ACTRESS 3: I’m Marisa. I’ve got nonstop flights to Miami every day. Fly me.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\n“Fly Me.” Fly me how? What are you going to do, get on top of me?\n\nNATIONAL AIRLINES ACTRESS 4: You can fly me morning, afternoon, or night. Just say when. I’m Judy, and I was born to fly. Fly me.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIt was pretty close to “Fuck me.” I hated that. It was really an insult.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nIt wasn't just that the ads were demeaning in some abstract way. It concretely affected the women's day-to-day lives. It made their job much harder.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nWe knew when people passed by us and felt our butts, or they accidentally pretended they were reaching for something to feel our breasts, or trapped us, you know, tried to squeeze past something so they could feel your body.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThe pilots had a little habit, in particular, one of them I remember, when I was going to my room at the layover, and he ran his hand down my back and he said, \"Oh, I see you're a modern woman. You don't wear a bra.\"\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nSome women were busy enjoying their new freedoms. Freedoms which they felt very happy about, to exist as sexual beings in a world that was now willing to acknowledge them as such. But those campaigns in particular really did cause a much wider swath of the women who were working as stewardesses to stand up and say, \"Hang on. That's one step too far.\"\n\nScene 3: On the Front Lines\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nJust as stewardesses are becoming more sexualized, the world is becoming more complicated. This is the darkest hour in America's Cold War fight.\n\nCHARTER FLIGHT STEWARDESS: We’d like to welcome you aboard Flying Tiger line flight number F2B3 to Bien Hoa, Vietnam.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nBy 1968, there are 500,000 troops on the ground in Vietnam at any given moment. To maintain those numbers, the US military can't do it alone. So they contract with private airlines.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThe arrangement is that they're leasing the jet, fully staffed.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nFlying in, it was very somber. The soldiers knew where they were going.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWe usually landed in the middle of the night and got in and out of Vietnam as quickly as possible, men off, men on. They were shooting rockets, and that would've been a good score if they could pull down a 747.\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen we landed, if you heard gunshots you had to evacuate the aircraft quickly. You ran to the bunkers.\n\nAIRPORT ANNOUNCER: May I have your attention in the terminal area…\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nEvery time we left, going home, there's an absolute huge roar.\n\nSOLDIERS: (cheering)\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nSome of the soldiers got hooked on drugs. I remember one flight, someone had not been weaned off of whatever they were on and he was just shaking all the way back. I just put my arms around him and held him, until we got to where we were going and they got medical transport for him.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThe flight attendant profession has always struggled with the differences between the intensity and seriousness of the work that must be done, especially as safety professionals, and then you've got this public role of being desirable, of being serene, of being charming.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThe late sixties, early seventies is this very precarious and completely confused moment.\n\nJOAN RIVERS: Stewardess! I think my window’s open! It’s not my aisle. (Laughs.) They are so dumb. Beautiful, but dumb.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nYou're being marketed, basically, as a Barbie doll, and yet doing more and more complex work. There's a fundamental incompatibility between these two things.\n\nScene 4: That Click Moment\n\nREPORTER: The scene was an all too familiar one at Laguardia Airport today, as an early afternoon bomb threat forced the evacuation of the airport.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nIn the late 60s, there were a lot of bomb threats and once you get a bomb threat for an airplane, you evacuate it, and you don't get back on until they've cleared it. So we had a bomb threat, and we’d evacuated the airplane. The pilot comes out of the cockpit and says to me, \"While we're here, would you mind cooking me a steak and make it medium rare?\"\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nWithout even thinking, I went to the galley, I turned on the oven, and then all of a sudden it struck me. There I was in the galley of an aircraft that might explode at any minute, cooking this guy a steak. I had one of those clicks where, \"Wait a minute, why would I be doing this?”\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nI walked off the airplane and I said, \"You can cook your steak yourself. I'm not staying there.\"\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThat moment was a turning point for me.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThe men don't have to wear hats with their uniform, why do we? The men don't have to wear girdles, why do we? The men got single rooms, the women did not.\n\nPATRICIA IRELAND, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nOnce you open your eyes, you can never wholly close them again.\n\nACT V\n\nScene 1: Equal Pay for Equal Work\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen I was 30 years old, I was the Master Executive Chairman with the union, which entitled me to sign a non-discriminatory contract with Northwest Airlines. It included a provision for stewardesses to become pursers.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe purser handled all of the paperwork on international flights.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThey did not have weight check. They were able to wear eyeglasses. And they always had single rooms.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThere was no reason why a female could not be a purser.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nIf you were a woman that wanted to make a career out of flying, your natural inclination would be to move to the purser position because of the better pay.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nBut certain airlines, like Northwest, refused to hire women for the purser position.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIn 1967, Northwest hired 5 men off the street to be pursers. I called the Director of Labor Relations and I said, \"The contract requires you to post these purser job positions to everyone,\" which he did.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe men made the stewardesses feel that they were not entitled to the job, and they could not handle the job of purser.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI realized as Master Executive Chairman that someone had to do it.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nSo I applied for the job. I became the first and only female purser with Northwest Airlines.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen I became a purser, I actually took a pay cut. The male pursers were getting $250 more per month. It was not fair at all. Why should I be treated differently than the men?\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nMy whole thought was, I am right and they are wrong. And as long as I am right, I will pursue this.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nMichael Gottesman was an expert in labor law. I made an appointment to see him.\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nOur expertise was labor law and employment law. We were the logical people to call.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI laid out the whole picture of the discrimination and how we had no recourse.\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nIn the course of describing her efforts to get the purser job, she just said offhandedly, \"You know, it's particularly ridiculous because it's really the same job. If a man holds it, they call it a purser. If a woman holds it, they call it a stewardess.”\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nIt would have been a good case, even if it was just the way they had treated Mary Pat, but it was a much bigger case. If they were paying 100 men a higher amount for doing the same work, then every female flight attendant would be entitled to the higher pay.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWe filed a class action lawsuit on July 15th, 1970.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWe originally had 40 people to file the suit. That guaranteed us a class action.\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nYou have to convince the judge that this would be an appropriate class action, that all of the people have the same grievance. And Mary Pat led the effort. She was fantastic at organizing.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWe had to educate people that we were on the right side of the law and we're only trying to force the company to obey the law.\n\nScene 2: Integration Part 3\n\nEASTERN AD NARRATOR 1: Eastern presents the losers.\n\nEASTERN AD NARRATOR 2: She’s awkward… Uh, not very friendly… Aw, but she’s too young… Oh, she’s, oh she bites nails… She wears glasses. Honey, no, the other… Oh, now…\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nMeet the Losers relishes the fact that they're turning away perfectly attractive, perfectly articulate people.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nAnd they’re all white. And that is not an accident.\n\nEASTERN AD NARRATOR 1: They’re probably good enough to get a job anywhere they want, but at Eastern we’re very choosy about whom we let serve you on a plane.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nEastern Airlines is stressing -- we’re still an exclusive form of transportation, and the promise of exclusivity is also a promise of racial exclusivity.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nThe first Black flight attendant for Delta was hired in '66 and then I was hired in 1971. So we're saying nearly a decade after Pat won her case. Pat opened the doors but the doors weren't kicked open, they were cracked.\n\nMIA BAY, HISTORIAN\n\nBy the start of the seventies, there's only about 1000 Black women working across all of the airlines but that's only 3% of the total number of flight attendants in the country at that point.\n\nMIA BAY, HISTORIAN\n\nAffirmative action was designed to make sure that candidates of color if they're qualified, they get hired.\n\nMIA BAY, HISTORIAN\n\nIt replaces nepotism, where employers hire people that they're most comfortable with, which is usually people like themselves.\n\nKEISHA BLAIN, HISTORIAN\n\nAirlines are forced to hire Black people. It doesn't mean they want to.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI was hired in 1970.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nOnce I completed the training and I started the job, I realized that the company, National Airlines, did not want me.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen I would see certain captains, I knew scheduling was going to pull me off the flight because they’d refuse to fly with me.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWhen we traveled you had to share a room.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWe would pull up to the hotel. The other three flight attendants, they've already discussed it among themselves. One would run out into the hotel, and sign up for the rooms. By the time I'm getting into the hotel, they already have the key and they're gone.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThey would open the door, but then tell me that I have to go downstairs and get my own room. I remember the front desk not being able to convince them to open the door, not having any rooms available.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nAnd on many occasions, I would kind of settle in a corner. I'm still in uniform. And I would sleep in the lobby.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThere was absolutely no one that I could discuss a problem with. The union did not want me as well. If I had a problem with my own supervisor, who was I going to go to?\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI ended up calling the Southern Poverty Law Center and I told them, I explained to them, and they - of course they asked me for proof or paperwork or whatever, and I said, “They won’t give it to me.” And they said, “Well, we’ll make a few phone calls.”\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI have no idea what was said. I have no idea if they in fact made those calls. But, all of sudden things started to change.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nMy supervisor called me in and said “The director is asking to submit names for the “Fly Me” ad.”\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nAnd I thought about it. Okay, you don’t want me here? Watch this.\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nYou don't like me in the workforce? Then how are you going to like me with my picture pasted all over? The sexual nature of the campaign ad “Fly Me” really didn't bother me. I did the ad because I wanted to show them.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nWhen you looked at all the different advertisements, you never saw a Black face. You never were chosen to do any advertisement. So, the sexism was secondary. I'm not sitting here in a sexy position to advertise sex. You were representing the Black stewardess and all that we could accomplish and that we were capable of doing.\n\nCASEY GRANT, FLIGHT ATTENDANT/WRITER\n\nWe understand the burden of the doors that we possibly could be opening up for anyone else to follow us.\n\nTRAINING SCHOOL INSTRUCTOR: Take your hands so that you’ve got them up out of the water. Push the water away…\n\nUNDRA MAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nA couple of times a year we used to go to recurrent training And this person stopped and said, \"There is a huge billboard with your ad, the “Fly Me” ad, and when I saw you, I thought, \"I didn't know they had Black stewardesses,\" and she went and applied.\n\nScene 3: SFWR\n\nWOMAN PASSING OUT LEAFLETS: Women’s Rights Day, come join us in the march tomorrow.\n\nNEWSCASTER: For more than four years, members of the National Organization for Women have been campaigning throughout the nation for more equality and better civil rights, and today their movement is wider and stronger than ever.\n\nGLORIA STEINEM: This inhuman system of exploitation will change, but only if we force it to change, and force it together.\n\nWOMAN ON STREET 1: I’ve never been captive.\n\nWOMAN ON STREET 2: No, I don’t feel enslaved, or anything like that.\n\nWOMAN ON STREET 1: We love you, men, and you can be the boss.\n\nPROTESTING WOMEN: Women’s liberation, now!\n\nMAN ON STREET: Equality?! You don’t know what the hell you want!\n\nBETTY FRIEDAN: We called this strike to confront the unfinished business of our equality.\n\nWOMAN WITH GROCERIES: I’m a very happy housewife and a very happy mother.\n\nPROTESTING WOMEN: Go do the dishes! Go do the dishes!\n\nSHIRLEY CHISHOLM: We’re not going to be able to do anything, unless we begin to do it for ourselves.\n\nSTEWARDESS: I’ve heard about it, thank you.\n\nSTEWARDESSES FOR WOMEN’S RIGHTS MEMBER: Will you come?\n\nSTEWARDESS: Yes.\n\nREPORTER: Women's liberation has reared its pretty head in the friendly skies.\n\nSTEWARDESSES FOR WOMEN’S RIGHTS MEMBER: Leaflets for our first national convention.\n\nHUGHES RUDD FOR CBS NEWS MIAMI: These women are protesting what strikes them as sexual discrimination on the airlines.\n\nHUGHES RUDD FOR CBS NEWS MIAMI: The question is whether or not a stewardess is a flying waitress, a sex object, or a safety expert. They seem to be a little bit of all three. But some of them are so annoyed by that sex object business that they formed an organization to try and change their image.\n\nSTEWARDESS AT MEETING: I would like you to know that I am trained to open this door in case of emergency, to take care of an epileptic attack, take care of a heart attack, if you should have one. I am there to help you with these things. And, also, if none of these things should happen on your flight, I will serve you a meal and offer you a cocktail.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nIn 1972, a group of women founded Stewardesses for Women's Rights and they were really trying to find a place in the broader women's movement for stewardesses who were invested in political change as well as workplace change.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nThey wanted to professionalize the occupation, raise the status and respect of the job. They also wanted to make the airplane safer, not just for the women who worked there and for the employees, but also for the passengers.\n\nSPEAKING\n\nSTEWARDESS 2 AT MEETING: There's really nothing wrong with being a stewardess. What's wrong is the image that has been portrayed to the public -- that we are empty-headed little fluffs that serve you a meal and take care of anything that you want taken care of on the airplane without a complaint. In fact, that we're not people.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nThey took up economic issues like promoting women into positions that they had been excluded from, but they also focused on issues that had not been seen as labor issues, issues having to do with appearance and grooming and control over women's bodies.\n\nSTEWARDESS 3 AT MEETING: I find it depletes me, I get so angry I-- certain things can set me off and I get in an irrational rage and I have to hold it back.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nI joined because I had a lot of frustrations and I felt that the union was not the answer to a lot of this stuff. The union reps, they were just a bunch of 50, 60 year old guys that were oblivious to the advertising, and to the sex discrimination. I just don't think they were capable of understanding it or something, you know? It was like we're dealing with people who were in a different generation.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nI don't think that a lot of feminists thought that these stewardesses who, on the surface, looked so complacent could be so effective.\n\nGLORIA STEINEM: I think the experience of standing up and speaking out for one’s rights and the rights of others is a contagious one, and it’s one that just - that really does make waves and change lives. It’s like throwing a pebble into a pond, the waves of reaction continue for a very long time.\n\nJULIA COOKE, WRITER\n\nGloria Steinem championed stewardesses’ rights from the beginning.\n\nKATHLEEN HEENAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nGloria was so supportive. She used to come to the offices. She felt that flight attendants would make a good case for changes that women were going through. We could represent a new era. She just had a lot of positive energy like, \"We can do this. We can just, you know, fight them.”\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nStewardesses for Women’s Rights were savvy in terms of fighting fire with fire. They distributed bumper stickers and buttons, and the buttons said, \"Go fly yourself.\" The bumper stickers said, \"National, your fly is open.\"\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nAnd one of the things that they did…\n\nACTRESS PLAYING STEWARDESS FROM SWFR COMMERCIAL: May I have your attention please.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\n… was what they called a “counter-commercial.”\n\nACTRESS PLAYING STEWARDESS FROM SWFR COMMERCIAL: I don’t think of myself as a sex object or a servant, but as someone who is capable of opening the door of a 747 in the dark, upside down, and in the water. Fantasies are fine in their place, but let’s be honest, the sexpot stewardess image is unsafe at any altitude. Think about it.\n\nScene 4: Laffey v. Northwest\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWe went to trial on December the 4th, 1972. 70% of Northwest Airlines stewardesses were part of the lawsuit.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nIt was a six-week trial. Executives of Northwest Airlines had to testify.\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nWe were the plaintiffs, so we had to put our case on first.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nNorthwest tried to make a point that for safety reasons they thought that women would want to share rooms, whereas men felt quite safe staying in their own room.\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nWhy do you put women in double rooms and allow men to have single rooms?\n\nANIMATED SEQUENCE: LAFFEY V. NORTHWEST COURTROOM SCENE\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe company's witness said in restaurants, you see women going to the bathroom together. They don’t go to the ladies' room alone.\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nThat was their explanation. That this is what women want.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe whole staff in the court were like, \"Oh, what kind of logic is that?\"\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nAnd I remember the judge's reaction. He just leaned back in his seat and roared. He was looking up and he was laughing.\n\nGRAPHIC DATE: APRIL 1974\n\nHARRY REASONER, ANCHOR: A federal judge today ordered Northwest Airlines to do the following things: Pay back salary and interest to all stewardesses who were fired since 1965 for being overweight, give stewardesses paid less than stewards since 1968 the difference in salary, and reimburse stewardesses for the difference in room rent since 1968 when they doubled up while stewards had single rooms.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe Judge made the decision in our favor on all issues. But then Northwest airlines was able to appeal the case.\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nTheir strategy was to take every opportunity that was legally available to them to defer the final moment when they were going to have to pay this money out.\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nIt took 11 years.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nMy sister was folding her laundry and she called me and said, \"Patty, you won.\" I said, \"What?\"\n\nTOM BROKAW: The Supreme Court today upheld a big payoff awarded to stewardesses who sued Northwest Airlines for sex discrimination.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThere is justice. That was my thinking, there is justice.\n\nMICHAEL GOTTESMAN, LAWYER\n\nIt was a big win. $60 million is a big chunk of money. And for a flight attendant to be receiving in one fell swoop, $50,000 in back pay.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWomen could wear eyeglasses. They would no longer be suspended for weight. And we could have single rooms.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nOne flight attendant sent a note and said that every time she walks around in her single room, naked, she thinks of me. [laughs]\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nMary Pat Laffey's victory is definitive in saying that under no circumstances shall a woman doing this job be presented with different and unequal standards as a man doing this job.\n\nPHIL TIEMEYER, HISTORIAN\n\nThis is what women's workplace civil rights are designed to do.\n\nDOROTHY SUE COBBLE, HISTORIAN\n\nThe Mary Pat Laffey case encouraged flight attendants to push the boundaries and to move into those jobs that had been off limits.\n\nMARY PAT LAFFEY INMAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nThe women were finally allowed to have the same benefits that the men had. If you were capable, you could have a man's job.\n\nEpilogue\n\nCELESTE LANSDALE BRODIGAN, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nNow a flight attendant, can be male, can be older, can be married, can be any race, ethnic origin. We're different now, we kind of match the passengers.\n\nCARD OVER STILL: Celeste Brodigan worked for United Airlines for 35 years.\n\nShe was recognized by the Air Force for her “Outstanding Achievement” flying military air charters during the Gulf War.\n\nCARD OVER STILL: Ann Hood flew with TWA for 8 years.\n\nShe became a best-selling author and has written over a dozen books.\n\nCARD OVER STILL: Patricia Ireland attended law school while working as a flight attendant. After seven years with Pan Am, she began her legal career.\n\nIn 1991, she became president of NOW, the National Organization for Women.\n\nCARD OVER STILL: Kathleen Heenan left TWA after 12 years to raise her three children.\n\nShe later taught a birding program in New York city public schools.\n\nCARD OVER STILL: Casey Grant worked for Delta for 35 years.\n\nShe hosts a radio show and writes books about African American pioneers in aviation.\n\nCARD OVER STILL: Jean Montague retired from American Airlines after nearly 40 years as a flight attendant.\n\nCARD OVER STILL: Undra Mays retired in 2020 after 50 years of flying.\n\nCARD OVER STILL: Pat Noisette Banks Edmiston raised two children and worked for the New York State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse for twenty five years.\n\nShe was inducted into the Black Aviation Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nDUSTY ROADS, FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n\nWe weren't fighting for ourselves. That's what made it so wonderful. I wasn't fighting for me. I was fighting for the girl next to me.\n\nCARD OVER STILL: In 1977, Dusty Roads co-founded the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which now represents over 26,000 flight attendants.\n\nShe worked for American Airlines for 44 years.\n\n--END--"
