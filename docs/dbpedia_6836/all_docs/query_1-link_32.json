        "text": "The Holiday – Hans Zimmer\n\nThe 2007 romantic comedy starring Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black has become a Christmas favourite. And to the story, which sees Diaz and Winslet’s characters swap homes and fall in love with someone new, Hans Zimmer’s score adds plenty of romance and magic – a perfect fit for the mood of finding one’s true ‘home’.\n\nMerry Christmas Mr. Lawrence – Ryuichi Sakamoto\n\nJapanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto gained international fame for Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence. Not only did he write the music he also starred in it alongside David Bowie and Tom Conti. The film tells the story of four men in a Japanese prisoner of war camp during the Second World War, based on Laurens van der Post’s experiences during World War II as a prisoner of war.\n\nRyuichi Sakamoto - Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\n\nThe Great Escape – Elmer Bernstein\n\nElmer Bernstein happily lived off the royalties from his jaunty, triumphant, catchy and extremely hummable theme to The Great Escape. He would probably have been bemused at its appearance at England football matches, where it has been a fixture since the mid-1990s. Bernstein’s music is the perfect accompaniment to the Second World War film, in which Steve McQueen, James Garner and Richard Attenborough mastermind a mass escape from a German prisoner of war camp.\n\nRead more: 10 of John Williams’ all-time greatest film themes, ranked\n\nElmer Bernstein - Main Title - (The Great Escape, 1963)\n\nJames Bond Theme – Monty Norman\n\nThe most famous guitar riff in cinema has featured in every official Bond film since Dr. No (1962), when it accompanied the opening title. It appeared again over the opening credits for From Russia with Love, and from then on became as integral to the James Bond universe as corny one-liners and gadgets. The guitar riff heard in the original recording of the theme was played by Vic Flick, who was paid a one-off fee of £6 for recording the tune.\n\n007 : James Bond : Theme\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption – Thomas Newman\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption centres on one man convicted of murder but, despite the circumstances, the film focuses on themes of hope and redemption. This 1994 movie was written and directed by Frank Darabont and based on a Stephen King novella. Nominated for an Oscar in 2004, Thomas Newman’s score reflects the emotional intensity of the film. A particular highlight of the movie was the beautiful ‘Sull’aria’ from Mozart’s opera The Marriage of Figaro, which was broadcast live to the prisoners.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption Opera Scene\n\nThe Third Man – Anton Karas\n\n40-year old zither player Anton Karas was discovered by director Carol Reed and The Third Man’s cast members playing in a wine cellar in Vienna. Reed immediately decided that this was the music he wanted for the film and Karas was enticed to London, where he wrote and recorded the soundtrack over six weeks. What became The Third Man theme had already been in Karas’ repertoire, but he hadn’t played it in 15 years. The image of it being played on the zither’s vibrating strings even provides the background for the film’s title sequence. More than half a million copies of the tune were sold within weeks of the film’s release.\n\nAnton Karas - Der Dritte Mann (The Third Man) Harry Lime Theme (HQ Audio)\n\nRomeo and Juliet – Craig Armstrong\n\nShakespeare’s timeless play is updated to the hip modern suburb of Verona Beach. Director Baz Luhrmann’s collaboration with Craig Armstrong led to an enduring partnership, including the musical spectacular Moulin Rouge. An unconventional soundtrack to the very unconventional interpretation, the touching piano theme for the Balcony Scene has become the standout moment.\n\nCraig Armstrong - Balcony Scene (from Romeo + Juliet OST)\n\nLove Actually – Craig Armstrong\n\nMuch-loved Christmastime staple Love Actually marked Craig Armstrong’s first time composing for a romantic comedy and he came up with the trademark, halo-glow piano piece, ‘Glasgow Theme’. Not only is Armstrong a talented Scottish musician and composer who won a Grammy Award for his film score for Ray, but he used to be a face in the Scottish pop music scene as a member of Hipsway and Texas!\n\nPM's Love Theme\n\nInception – Hans Zimmer\n\nBefore embarking on this score, Zimmer was told to let his imagination run wild. What emerged was a densely constructed, imaginative, electronic sound world, incorporating a guitar sound reminiscent of the music of Ennio Morricone played by Johnny Marr, former guitarist of The Smiths. Édith Piaf’s hit, ‘Non, je ne regrette rien’, which appears in the film, is also integrated into Zimmer’s score. The film’s iconic brass instrument fanfare even resembles a slowed-down version of the song.\n\nHans Zimmer - Time (Official Audio)\n\nGhost – Maurice Jarre\n\nIt’s fair to say that most people would probably think of ‘Unchained Melody’ when they think of Ghost, but Maurice Jarre’s spooky and supernatural score for the film is one of his best. His compelling musical storytelling of Sam and Molly’s love is one of the reasons audiences keep coming back to this classic film.\n\nJaws – John Williams\n\nOne of the most iconic pieces of film music, the two-note shark motif that made going in the sea terrifying almost becomes a character in its own right. Rarely has a piece of film music so perfectly captured a film’s atmosphere. When Williams first played the two notes to Spielberg on a piano, the director initially laughed, thinking it was a joke. Williams described the theme, performed on the tuba, as “grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable”.\n\nFSO - Jaws - \"The Shark Theme\" (John Williams)\n\nForrest Gump – Alan Silvestri\n\nAlan Silvestri is one of the best action composers of all time, and it’s his partnership with director Robert Zemeckis that brings out the best in him – think of the Back to the Future trilogy. For Zemeckis’ Forrest Gump, Silvestri produced an Oscar-nominated score which chimes perfectly with the simplicity and naiveté of the eponymous hero. There’s hardly a moment here that won’t leave you feeling inspired and uplifted.\n\nForrest Gump Live - Hollywood in Vienna 2011\n\nThe Piano – Michael Nyman\n\nA woman, her daughter and her piano arrive in 19th-century New Zealand for an arranged marriage. But her future husband refuses to move the piano from the beach. In a bid to get her piano back, she agrees certain favours with an illiterate neighbour. Michael Nyman’s profile rocketed following the success of The Piano and his film score went on to become a classical best seller.\n\nThe Heart Asks Pleasure First / The Promise (Edit)\n\nDangerous Moonlight – Richard Addinsell\n\nProducers of the 1941 film Dangerous Moonlight had their eyes on Rachmaninov to write their score. The lugubrious Russian wasn't that keen, so the job of penning the music went to Richard Addinsell. Despite all that, it's fair to say that even he passed on much of the work, too: it fell to the arranger and orchestrator Roy Douglas to knit together the melodies and turn them into a fully orchestrated, heart-on-your-sleeve concert piece, known as the Warsaw Concerto. Full of indulgent harmonies and grand Romantic gestures, the piece remains hugely popular today.\n\nAddinsell Warsaw Concerto Laszlo Kovacs Hungarian Symphony Orchester, Miskolc\n\nPirates of the Caribbean (Dead Man’s Chest and At World’s End) – Hans Zimmer\n\nThe second, incredibly successful Pirates romp picks up where the first movie left off, at the wedding of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. Before either can say 'I do', Captain Jack comes between them again in his quest to save his soul from Davy Jones and a watery grave. Hans Zimmer's score is just as over the top as Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow. It's music with its nostrils flared, its chest out and its tongue in its cheek.\n\nOrganist plays Davy Jones' Theme from Pirates of the Caribbean on Vienna's main cathedral organ\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon – John Powell\n\nThis blockbuster animation won the hearts of children and adults alike, but John Powell’s soundtrack is pure action movie class. Something of a minor Hollywood legend, Powell has provided the soundtracks to some incredible money-shifting blockbusters throughout the years (try The Bourne trilogy, for starters). But with How To Train Your Dragon, he earned his first Academy Award nomination. It’s a soaring, adrenaline-pumping score – a bit like riding on the back of a dragon.\n\nhow to train your dragon - Flying theme\n\nRobin Hood Prince of Thieves – Michael Kamen\n\nThis is a score that initially owed its success to the monumentally successful end title song, ‘Everything I Do, I Do It for You’, co-written by Michael Kamen with Bryan Adams. As the song chalked up 16 weeks at No.1 in the UK, and won a Grammy award and an Oscar-nomination, interest grew in the rest of Kamen’s rollicking, brassy soundtrack. The overture remains a favourite with school and military bands.\n\nMichael Kamen - Robin Hood Suite (Robin Hood - König der Diebe) | WDR Funkhausorchester\n\nBlade Runner – Vangelis\n\nComposed in 1982 and presaging the ambient music genre that would follow in the wake of house beats by almost a decade, Vangelis’s music perfectly captures the mood of the dystopian, rain-lashed Los Angeles in which the film is set. Evocative and seductively melancholy.\n\nMain Titles\n\nBack to the Future – Alan Silvestri\n\nAlan Silvestri’s Back To The Future is right up there with Star Wars and Indiana Jones as one of those iconic Hollywood themes – brassy, bombastic and thrilling. Silvestri’s score flits around Marty McFly’s increasingly wacky adventures, but among all the chaos and the pop culture references that run throughout the movie, at its heart it still all comes back to that one main theme.\n\n\"Back to the Future\" with composer Alan Silvestri conducting in Vienna!\n\nLawrence of Arabia – Maurice Jarre\n\nJarre became involved in the 1962 epic after both William Walton and Malcolm Arnold had proved unavailable. Despite this, and the brief six weeks he was given to write the score, Jarre came through with music that perfectly captures director David Lean's vast desert setting and Peter O'Toole's Oscar-winning turn as Lawrence. One of cinema's most famous themes, Jarre's mix of orchestra and exotic percussion captures the romance of the desert.\n\nLawrence of Arabia - Main Theme - Maurice Jarre\n\nApollo 13 – James Horner\n\nThis Ron Howard-directed drama told the true story of the ill-fated 13th American mission to the moon. At a time when space flights had become routine to the American public, the impending tragedy and heroism of the astronauts and scientists suddenly grabbed headlines again. Horner's Copland-esque score for Apollo 13 is possibly his greatest – understated yet stirring, patriotic but with a reverence and dignity, which at times makes it feel more suited to a historical documentary.\n\nApollo 13 OST FULL - James Horner\n\nThe Dam Busters – Eric Coates\n\nEric Coates' brilliant theme to the 1955 film, The Dam Busters, is now so popular in its own right that it's often played at military flypasts in the UK. It's not surprising, given its catchy tune.\n\nThe Dam Busters- Eric Coates\n\nBraveheart – James Horner\n\nAs Mel Gibson, playing Scottish nationalist William Wallace, cried \"Freedom!\", James Horner's stirring score helped transport us back to the 13th century. There were Horner's trademark traditional Celtic and Scottish influences, and not a few eyebrows were raised at the inclusion of some Irish themes, and a Kena flute from the Andes. Combined with the orchestra and a spine-tingling boys' choir, they create a stirring and beautiful, romantic score.\n\nA Gift of a Thistle (\"Brave Heart\" OST)\n\nLast of the Mohicans – Trevor Jones\n\nIt could have ended up being an electronic score if director Michael Mann had had his way, but thankfully this glorious 1992 soundtrack from Trevor Jones ended up as an orchestral affair. The film’s main character Hawkeye – played by Daniel Day-Lewis – had little to say, but the music spoke volumes. A majestic, thrilling but ultimately simple soundtrack.\n\nThe Last Of The Mohicans (1992) Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Full OST\n\nGone with the Wind – Max Steiner\n\nMax Steiner is one of the founders of film music as we know it today and his name is now attached to the annual 'Max Steiner Award' for film music which recognises his pioneering role in the early development of the craft. Steiner was drafted in to provide the music to Gone With The Wind and his sweeping score has really stood the test of time, still able to send shivers down spines and create goosebumps.\n\nTara's Theme ~ Gone with the Wind\n\nCinema Paradiso – Ennio Morricone\n\nThis touching 1988 Italian film celebrates both childhood and cinema. In keeping with the film’s study of a relationship between a child and a father figure, composer Morricone collaborated with his son Andrea for the film's score and their work won them a Bafta. While Morricone is best known for the experimental nature of his earlier work scoring westerns for Sergio Leone with natural sounds, electric guitars and harmonica, Cinema Paradiso is a more traditional orchestral score. However, it is a perfect accompaniment to the sentimental and romantic nature of the film itself.\n\nEnnio Morricone - Cinema Paradiso (In Concerto - Venezia 10.11.07)\n\nThe Lion King – Hans Zimmer\n\nHans Zimmer’s remarkable African-influenced score for the Disney classic turned animated drawings of lions into living, emotionally alive creatures. Hired because of his work on The Power of One and A World Apart, both set in South Africa, Zimmer infused his score for The Lion King with many elements of traditional African music and choral arrangements from South African composer Lebo M. The Lion King soundtrack, with a little help from Elton John, went on to be phenomenally successful, winning Zimmer an Oscar for the music, and becoming a blockbuster stage show too.\n\nHans Zimmer - Remember (From \"The Lion King\"/Audio Only)\n\nThe Big Country – Jerome Moross\n\nFor a soundtrack that needed to be as sweeping as the action and location, director William Wyler turned to Jerome Moross who had orchestrated dozens of movies and had extensive experience composing for the concert hall, ballet and theatre. While Moross' Oscar-nominated score is somewhat reminiscent of the wild west ballets of Aaron Copland, The Big Country became his most important contribution to film music, clearly influencing many of the great western scores that followed.\n\nThe Big Country (Theme from \"The Big Country\" Original Soundtrack)\n\nThe Magnificent Seven – Elmer Bernstein\n\nUndoubtedly one of the greatest Western themes ever, Bernstein drew upon Copland's Wild West ballets to create a galloping, expansive romp that has remained a worldwide favourite. Along with the iconic main tune, the score also contains allusions to twentieth-century symphonic works, including a reference to Bartók's Concerto for Orchestra in the tense, quiet scene just before the shoot-out.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven • Main Theme • Elmer Bernstein\n\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nJohn Williams’s close relationship with Steven Spielberg and the director’s own meteoric career meant that he was the composer for many major films of the period, including Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman and of course, E.T. for which Williams won his fourth Oscar. No one does the magic and wonder of childhood better than Spielberg, and no one could have produced more sympathetic and timeless scores.\n\nJohn Williams - Flying Theme (E.T. the Extra-terrestial Soundtrack) [HQ]\n\nTitanic – James Horner\n\nFor the biggest film of its time, composer Horner turned his back quite deliberately on the traditional idea of what a film score for a Hollywood blockbuster should sound like. Instead, he focused on the Irish background of Leonardo di Caprio’s character, Jack Dawson, and created a soundworld somewhat reminiscent of the likes of Enya and Clannad. Titanic earned Horner a fortune and two Oscars. And it also made Celine Dion, who sang the theme tune, a few pennies too.\n\nFSO - Titanic - \"Suite\" (James Horner)\n\nSaving Private Ryan – John Williams\n\nSaving Private Ryan won five Oscars in 1998 but Best Soundtrack was not among them. Spielberg wanted to keep much of the film silent, to concentrate on the true horrors of war and to make sure that the harsh and real atmosphere was heard (and it clearly worked, hence winning the Best Sound Oscar). This put considerable limits on Williams, but he still managed a moving theme, played over the end credits and soon becoming a stand-alone hit, Hymn to the Fallen. The wordless chorus with a trumpet and snare-drum combination certainly tugs at the heart strings.\n\nCinema in Concert - 08 - John Williams - Hymn to the Fallen\n\nLadies in Lavender – Nigel Hess\n\nNigel Hess struck gold with Classic FM listeners with his music for Charles Dance’s 2004 film. Set in picturesque 1930s Cornwall, the sweeping, lyrical score perfectly matches the stunning scenery and ocean vistas. For the main theme, Hess employs a full symphony orchestra alongside a solo violin, performed on the original soundtrack by the star violinist Joshua Bell.\n\n(HD 1080p) Ladies in Lavender (OST), Joshua Bell\n\nIndiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark – John Williams\n\nSteven Spielberg and George Lucas have a knack for producing great cinematic adventures, and this was certainly the case with Raiders of the Lost Ark, which introduced Indiana Jones to delirious audiences around the world. John Williams's blistering ‘Raiders March’, first heard on Raiders, went on to symbolise the reckless antics of Harrison Ford's Indy for three more cinematic outings. The score received an Oscar nomination but lost out to Vangelis' score for Chariots Of Fire.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981) Complete Soundtrack - John Williams\n\nInterstellar – Hans Zimmer\n\nZimmer delivered magnificently for Interstellar, receiving an Oscar nod for his soundtrack. Painstakingly composed over two years, Zimmer visited London’s Temple Church to record its historic organ. An ensemble of 34 strings, 24 woodwinds, four pianos, and a 60-voice mixed choir were later added. The feeling of air and breath resonates throughout the music.\n\nRead more: The 10 best Hans Zimmer soundtracks\n\nInterstellar Main Theme - Extra Extended - Soundtrack by Hans Zimmer\n\nThe Godfather – Nino Rota\n\nRota's score for Francis Ford Coppola's gangster epic was removed at the last minute from the list of 1973 Academy Award nominees when it was discovered that Rota's famous 'Love Theme' used the same melody as one he had used previously in Eduardo De Filippo's 1958 comedy Fortunella. Confusingly, his score for The Godfather Part II went on to win the Oscar in 1974, even though it featured the same Love Theme that made the 1972 score ineligible. Whatever. It's an all-time classic.\n\nThe Godfather Theme Song\n\nPirates of the Caribbean – Klaus Badelt\n\nKlaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer headed a team of 15 composers who worked on this score to get it completed quickly. Composer Alan Silvestri, who had collaborated with director Gore Verbinski on Mouse Hunt and The Mexican, was set to provide the score, but the producers went with Badelt instead. Johnny Depp swaggered and strutted as Captain Jack Sparrow, the music did too – thrilling, surging and just a little bit cheeky.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean (Auckland Symphony Orchestra) 1080p\n\nWilde – Debbie Wiseman\n\nClassic FM composer in residence Debbie Wiseman's score for the Oscar Wilde biopic starring Stephen Fry has become as well loved as the film that inspired it. The poet, wit and general legendary cultural figure of Oscar Wilde himself also looms large over the work, and it's clear that Wiseman's inspiration was as much from his works than merely the work of the movie.\n\nDoctor Zhivago – Maurice Jarre\n\nDavid Lean’s screen version of Boris Pasternak’s Doctor Zhivago was a sumptuous, sprawling, epic about the life of a Russian doctor-poet who, although married, falls for a political activist's wife and struggles against all the odds to survive the turmoil of war. It won numerous Academy Awards including one for Maurice Jarre’s moving score. While the music largely lets the movie speak for itself, the memorable love theme, Lara’s Theme, is a constant reference point and became a worldwide hit.\n\nLara's Theme de Doctor Zhivago por La Orquesta de la Ciudad de Praga\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone – John Williams\n\nJohn Williams conjures up another magical score reminiscent at times of Saint-Saëns’s Danse Macabre. The first Harry Potter film introduced the instantly recognisable ‘Hedwig’s Theme’. With its use of the celesta in its introduction, it evokes another magical moment from musical history, Tchaikovsky’s ‘Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy’ from The Nutcracker.\n\nJohn Williams - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer´s Stone - Suite\n\nChariots of Fire – Vangelis\n\nGreek synthesiser wizard Vangelis opted for a very modern, electronic score in contrast to the film's 1920s setting – a decision that worked. The famous theme has lived way beyond its original purpose and is widely used for sporting events in real life, forming a memorable moment at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, with Sir Simon Rattle, the LSO and Mr. Bean! Vangelis won an Oscar for his soundtrack.\n\nLondon Symphony Orchestra - Chariots of Fire (London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony)\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly – Ennio Morricone\n\nItalian master, Morricone, certainly created one of the most iconic pieces of film music with his main theme, and the rest of the score to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly comes complete with all the classic Morricone traits – including whistling, yodelling and gunfire.\n\nThe Good, The Bad and The Ugly (Main Theme)\n\nThe Mission – Ennio Morricone\n\nMorricone created his most successful score for the Oscar-winning 1986 film. It tells the story of a Spanish priest who goes into the South American jungle to build a mission and convert a community of Guarani Indians, while fighting off the dastardly Portuguese colonials, who are trying to enslave the community. Morricone’s score skilfully mixes Amazonian rhythms with the Baroque style of the Jesuit missionaries.\n\nThe Mission\n\nJurassic Park – John Williams\n\nWritten in the same year as Schindler’s List, which was a major award-winner in 1993, John Williams’s score for Jurassic Park may have been somewhat overshadowed. However the dinosaur blockbuster enabled him to use an array of compositional techniques which he employed in many of his 1990s film scores. The minute this theme was first aired, it sounded like it had been around for millions of years, instantly an old friend. Majesty is somehow written into the score and befits the wonderful, enormous creatures that Spielberg brought to life on the screen.\n\nBournemouth Symphony Orchestra perform epic 'Jurassic Park' at Classic FM Live\n\nDances with Wolves – John Barry\n\nReflecting the movie's political and ecological themes, Barry rejected the usual western clichés for a gentle depiction of the story's wide-open plains. As well as the hugely popular 'John Dunbar Theme', the 'Love Theme' is eloquent and ever so slightly haunting; while the music used to accompany Two Socks (the 'star' wolf) is also beautiful.\n\nJohn Barry：Dances With Wolves\n\nGladiator – Hans Zimmer\n\nAn Oscar-nominated score for the epic that revived the sword and sandals blockbuster. For Gladiator, Hans Zimmer uses a simple but stirring melody throughout and, as a result, the film joins the ranks of those movies for which the music is a key part of its success. Lisa Gerrard’s haunting voice added a timeless and atmospheric quality.\n\nGladiator • Now We Are Free • Hans Zimmer & Lisa Gerrard\n\nStar Wars – John Williams\n\nIn 1977, Star Wars caused a revolution; Williams brought a new hope to movie soundtracks, reviving the golden age of grand symphonic scores. He’s since composed for most of the Star Wars movies and most recently worked on ‘Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker’. From the brass blasts of ‘Imperial March’ to Princess Leia’s theme, every one of Williams’s motifs is pure class.\n\nJohn Williams conducts the Vienna Philharmonic in the 'Imperial March'\n\nSchindler’s List – John Williams\n\nJohn Williams initially thought this heartrending movie would be too challenging to score, telling director Steven Spielberg: “You need a better composer than I am for this film.” Spielberg responded: “I know, but they’re all dead!” As it turned out, Williams captures perfectly the traditional music and sad plight of Europe’s Jewry, and the shame of man’s inhumanity to man.\n\nSchindler's List Theme by Itzhak Perlman in Chile\n\nThe Lord of the Rings – Howard Shore\n\nCanadian composer, Howard Shore, may have seemed an unusual choice for the most ambitious production in cinema history, but he triumphed. Nothing in recent years has come close for scale, drama, melody and skill. Shore’s score – which features some 80 different themes and motifs representing the various characters and locations – won him three Oscars, four Grammys and three Golden Globes.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings soundtrack: all you need to know about Howard Shore’s score\n\nHoward Shore’s The Lord of the Rings | Classic FM Live"
