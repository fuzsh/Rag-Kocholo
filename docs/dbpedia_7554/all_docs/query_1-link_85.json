That is why it is important for us to know the 21 countries where Spanish is spoken as an official language.\n\nMore than 580 million people speak Spanish in the world, which is 7% of the global population. So the following facts are of utmost importance not only for those who are learning Spanish, but also for people who are looking to acquire general knowledge.\n\nThe 21 countries with Spanish as official language\n\nIn another article we talked about the Spanish spoken in each of these countries, now we will limit ourselves to facts that everyone should know about them.\n\nArgentina\n\nThe capital is Buenos Aires. It is the second largest country in South America, after Brazil. Its economy is based mainly on agriculture and livestock, and its population is more than 47 million inhabitants.\n\nBolivia\n\nBolivia is a plurinational state, meaning that its Constitution makes it clear that it is a territory in which several nations coexist prior to Spanish colonization.\n\nIt is landlocked.
