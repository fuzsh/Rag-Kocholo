        "text": "From primordial petroglyphs to the alluring Cocibolca, the world renown “land of lakes and volcanoes” offers an unparalleled journey into the heart of Central America. Shedding its post-80s revolutionary repute, Nicaragua has rapidly emerged as a fulcrum of international ecotourism, and welcomes many travelers who want to learn Spanish in Nicaragua every year.\n\nBordering Honduras to the north and Costa Rica to the south, Nicaragua offers an eclectic mix of language, culture, cuisine and everything in between -- albeit, without the price tag of its continental counterparts!\n\nIndeed, girded by the Pacific Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Fonseca, the nation's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems make it an ideal location for any traveler looking to spice up their linguistic experience without breaking the bank!\n\nA melting-pot of history, heritage and habitat, Mesoamerica’s hidden pocket is well and truly open for business!\n\nPhoto credits: nimdok.\n\nImmersion programs\n\nWhether you’re looking to become a monolingual master, hone your skills, or simply experience life in another country, cultural immersions offer an unparalleled opportunity to walk the walk and talk the talk right in the heart of Central America! Homestay programs are habitually run in association with regional language schools, and may cost anywhere between $250 - 400 USD per week.\n\nUniversity courses\n\nWith more institutions than ever offering study abroad and academic exchange programs, students seeking the most structured option are advised to consider a university-based language course. Though an intermediate level of Spanish is often required, travelers are afforded the opportunity to gain academic credit and work alongside their peers. Students are advised to contact their home institution for inquiries regarding financial assistance.\n\nPrivate tutoring\n\nPrivate tuition offers the most flexibility to travelers looking to combine education with fun, with classes offered alongside (or independent of) additional studies. Unlike its continental counterparts, private tuition in Nicaragua won’t break the bank, costing as little as $8 USD per hour!\n\nWhere in Nicaragua is best for you to learn Spanish?\n\nMasaya\n\nDubbed \"the Cradle of Folklore,” Nicaragua’s handicraft capital offers an eclectic mix of history, heritage and gastronomy -- a significant coup for any linguistic experience.\n\nFrom ‘the Mercardo de Artesanias’ (craft market) and San Jeronimo fall fiesta, to the Volcan Masaya and Apoyo Lake, travelers are never short an opportunity to explore Nicaraguan culture! While you’re here, make sure to check out some of the cities world renown pre-Columbian cuisine, such as Nacatamal, Vaho, and yucca!\n\nLeon\n\nFounded by the Spaniards as Leon Santiago de los Caballeros, Nicaragua’s second largest conurbation boasts a wealth of architectural, historical and cultural landmarks -- not to mention some of the most esteemed language schools in the country!\n\nHome to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites -- the Leon Cathedral and Ruins of Leon Viejo -- and the Telica Volcano’s world-renown hot springs, Leon epitomizes the “work hard, play harder” axiom.\n\nGranada\n\nDescending from a rich colonial heritage, Granada has been hallmarked as the first European city in mainland America -- a claim bolstered by the atavistic monuments and architecture lining the region.\n\nPopulated predominantly by a Spanish-speaking majority of Mestizos (natives), Granada offers travelers an unmatched opportunity to experience Nicaragua’s abundant history, language and culture deep in the heart of Central America! Notable sites include the Volcano Mombacho, Isletas of Granada and Ometepe (not actually in Granada, but easily accessible for a quick day or weekend trip)."
