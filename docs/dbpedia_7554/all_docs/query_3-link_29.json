        "text": "With almost 500 million native speakers across 21 countries and 3 continents, Spanish is the second most widely-spoken language in the world, ahead of English and only surpassed by Chinese. In addition, it is one of the six official languages of the UN (United Nations).\n\nThe highest number of speakers inhabit the Americas, followed by Spain, in Europe. The only country in Africa where Spanish is an official language is Equatorial Guinea.\n\nMexico is home to the largest population of native Spanish speakers, boasting over 127 million.\n\nThe 21 countries and territories where Spanish is an official language are:\n\nHispanic America is the term used to make reference to Spanish-speaking countries across the Americas. The term Latin America, in turn, encompasses all countries in the Americas (with the exception of the United States and Canada) where Romance languages are spoken, including Brazil, where Portuguese is the official language.\n\nCountries where Spanish is a significant language\n\nSpanish is also spoken by millions of people in countries where it is, though not the official language, a significant language. Large communities of Spanish speakers populate countries across the globe not only as a result of colonialism but also through immigration. These countries include:\n\nUnited States. Hispanic communities are the largest minority group in the US. According to the US Census Bureau, over 41.7 million people speak Spanish at home, accounting for over 60% of the languages spoken other than the official English.\n\nBelize. While the official language is English, Spanish is among the major languages spoken in the country, and is taught in schools.\n\nAndorra. Though the official language is Catalan, Spanish is spoken by a large percentage of the population. Other foreign languages include Portuguese and French, but to a lesser extent.\n\nPhilippines. Despite its colonial past, Spanish is spoken by a small minority of the population, accounting for some hundred thousands.\n\nSpanish dialects\n\nThe Spanish language, derived from Latin, was born in Spain, Europe, and was introduced into the Americas during the Spanish colonial period, where many different indigenous languages were spoken across the territories of the New World.\n\nThese indigenous languages started to mix with Spanish, evolving into new dialects unique to the Americas and to each individual region. Americanisms were thus born, deriving from the indigenous languages of the populations that inhabited those lands.\n\nThus, the Spanish spoken across the many regions in the Americas shows a large number of distinctions that differentiate it from the language spoken in Spain that have to do not only with vocabulary, but also with pronunciation and grammar.\n\nVocabulary. The most noticeable difference between the different types of Spanish is vocabulary, with each region or country having their own way of naming things. Words like ordenador (computer), bocadillo (sandwich), or coger (take) are used in Spain, while their Latin American counterparts are computadora, sÃ¡ndwich, and tomar respectively.\n\nLikewise, the introduction of anglicisms is more typical of Latin American countries, with words like smartphone being of every-day use.\n\nGrammar. Grammar differences exist between the different Spanish dialects, the biggest one being the use of the vosotros pronoun in Spain for the second person plural. Latin American countries use the ustedes pronoun instead.\n\nPronunciation. A marked distinction between the various Spanish dialects is pronunciation. Broadly speaking, it can be said that Spanish consonants are much stronger, with more air being released in their articulation. Latin American consonants, in turn, are much softer. The pronunciation of the letter z and of the ce and ci sequences as âthâ in Spain, as opposed to âsâ in Latin America, is a clear example.\n\nDifferences in pronunciation also distinguish the several accents in Latin America. Nonetheless, these differences may be compared to those between American and British accents, where speakers understand one another in spite of the differences in their accents.\n\nWhat other languages are spoken in Spanish-speaking countries?\n\nBesides Spanish, which is the major language in Spanish-speaking countries, other minority languages have been retained. The preservation of regional and indigenous languages is directly related to the preservation of native cultures.\n\nNote: Countries where the number of speakers of native languages is not significant have not been included in the chart above.\n\nMore on this: Latin American Spanish vs Spain Spanish\n\nReferences"
