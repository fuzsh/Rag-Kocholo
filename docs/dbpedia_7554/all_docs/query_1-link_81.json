        "text": "Like English, Spanish is a global language with nearly 600 million Spanish speakers worldwide. There are many Spanish-speaking countries, from the 21 nations with Spanish as their official language, to other countries with significant populations of people who speak Spanish as their native language or as a second language.\n\nThe Chinese language has the most native speakers of any language in the world, but Spanish follows in second place with nearly 500 million native speakers around the globe. After Chinese and English, Spanish is the third most spoken language in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, and is also an official language of the World Trade Organization and the European Union. The widespread use of Spanish and its importance in business, economics and media makes Spanish a practical language to learn.\n\nThe Spanish language has a vast geographic reach. Spanish is the official language of countries spanning across four different continents.\n\nListed in order of population size, these are the 21 countries where Spanish is the official language:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMexico\n\nColombia\n\nSpain\n\nArgentina\n\nPeru\n\nVenezuela\n\nChile (including Easter Island)\n\nGuatemala\n\nEcuador\n\nDominican Republic\n\nHonduras\n\nBolivia\n\nCuba\n\nParaguay\n\nNicaragua\n\nEl Salvador\n\nCosta Rica\n\nPanama\n\nUruguay\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nEquatorial Guinea\n\nAlthough Spain is largely associated with the Spanish language, Mexico actually has three times the number of native Spanish speakers. Colombia also has a significantly higher population of native Spanish speakers than Spain.\n\nNotably, the regional languages of Basque and Catalan are the native languages of nearly 20 percent of Spain's population, even though the official language of their nation is Spanish.\n\nMany people are surprised to learn that there is also a Spanish-speaking country in Africa. In the former Spanish province of Equatorial Guinea, a country located on the central west coast of the continent, Spanish is an official language, along with French and Portuguese. About one third of the population, or one million people, speak Spanish in Equatorial Guinea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpanish is a romance language that evolved from Latin after the fall of the Roman Empire in the Iberian Peninsula, the southwest corner of Europe that includes present-day Spain and Portugal. The language was heavily influenced by surrounding Romance languages, such as Portuguese and Catalan.\n\nCastellano, or Castilian Spanish, first evolved in northern and central Spain, which is why Spain is largely associated with the language. The local culture and the language were influenced by the presence of Moorish rule and their Arabic language. Standard Spanish today still uses words that were derived from Arabic, as well as grammatical features such as gender agreement between nouns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween the 13th and 16th centuries, the language was further standardized in Madrid and Toledo. During the Reconquista, the language was brought into southern Spain. Andalusian Spanish evolved in the southern region and became predominant in the Americas.\n\nIn the 16th century the Spanish Empire expanded into Mexico, Central America and vast areas of South America. The Spaniards brought their language and culture along with them when settling in new areas, where natives were forced to integrate, thus creating multicultural populations and various dialects as a result of Spanish colonialism.\n\nMany former Spanish colonies continued to use Spanish as the primary language even after gaining independence in the 19th century.\n\nFollowing the Spanish-American War, the United States controlled Puerto Rico, but citizens continued to speak their native Spanish. Millions of Puerto Ricans have since immigrated to the United States, increasing native Spanish speakers on the mainland.\n\nThe United States unofficially recognizes Spanish as the nation's second language.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks to migrants and students of the Spanish language, Spanish is spoken widely around the world. In areas where Spanish is not the official language, there can still be a high population of people who speak Spanish, due to the presence of a Hispanic or Spanish culture.\n\nIn the United States, Spanish is the first language of over 13 percent of the total population, or nearly 40 million people. This, combined with the U.S. population of those who speak Spanish as a second language, makes the country the second-largest Spanish-speaking country worldwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Spanish is not the national language, the U.S. unofficially recognizes Spanish as the nation's second language due to its importance to the population. Broadcast media, official documents and public services are widely available in Spanish to serve the high population of Spanish speakers in the United States.\n\nSpanish is the most popular foreign language to learn in the United States, with significantly more students than French, which follows in second place.\n\nIt can be practical for U.S. residents to learn Spanish to connect with the local Spanish-speaking population. It's also easier to learn Spanish if you have the opportunity to use the language in real life situations.\n\nLearning Spanish can also improve travel experiences, since the Spanish-speaking world extends far and wide, and learning a language can help you professionally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny country where Spanish is regularly spoken is susceptible to evolving into a new dialect with unique Spanish slang, idioms, accents, intonation, pronunciation or grammar. Beyond Spain, other Spanish-speaking countries have seen the language evolve to create a mother tongue to suit the local culture.\n\nEven though it is technically the same language being spoken, it can sound very different country to country, but understanding standard Spanish can still help your understanding of more unique dialects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Chavacano\n\nChavacno is a Spanish-based Creole language widely spoken across the southern portion of the Philippines.\n\nThe Spanish Empire ruled the Philippines for over three centuries (the country was actually named after Spanish royalty) and Spanish remained an official language of the Philippines until 1987. About three million Filipinos speak Spanish or Chavacno as their mother tongue.\n\n2. Equatoguinean\n\nMost Spanish speakers in Africa are based in Equatorial Guinea, where nearly 70 percent of the population is Spanish-speaking. However, there are also communities of Spanish speakers in Angola, South Sudan and Morocco, a North African country geographically close to Spain.\n\nThe Spanish spoken in Equatorial Guinea was heavily influenced by Bantu languages. In grammar and in pronunciation, Equatoguinean Spanish is more similar to Peninsular Spanish than to American Spanish dialects.\n\n3. New Mexican\n\nNew Mexico is the only state that recognizes both English and Spanish as official languages. Traditional New Mexican Spanish is a unique Spanish dialect that has evolved from the earliest Spanish-speaking settlers in the state of New Mexico and southern Colorado.\n\nThe locals of Spanish descent have made this dialect survive for over 400 years, but with a decreasing population, the language is beginning to disappear.\n\n4. Rioplatense\n\nRioplatense Spanish is a dialect from the the RÃ­o de la Plata Basin, currently spoken in Argentina and Uruguay. Notably, this regional dialect includes an intonation similar to the Neapolitan language of Southern Italy, influenced by Italian settlers since the 19th century.\n\nNow That's a Combination\n\nThe Bible is the world's most translated piece of writing, followed up by none other than \"Pinnochio\" in second place.\n\nAdvertisement"
