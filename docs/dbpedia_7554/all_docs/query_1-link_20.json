        "text": "Advertisement\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpanish is one of the world’s most widely spoken languages, and it is the official language of 20 countries. These countries are located in Europe, Central and South America, and even in Africa. The majority of these countries were once colonized by Spain, and as a result, their cultures and customs are deeply influenced by Spanish traditions.\n\nSpain is one of the Spanish speaking countries, and it is located in southwestern Europe. It has a rich cultural heritage, including famous painters such as Goya and Picasso, as well as popular festivals such as La Tomatina and Las Fallas. Spain is also famous for its delicious cuisine, including dishes like paella, tapas, and churros.\n\nIn North America, there are three Spanish-speaking countries: Mexico, the United States, and Cuba. Mexico is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world, with a population of over 126 million people. The United States has a significant Spanish-speaking population, with over 40 million people who speak Spanish as their first language – , although it does not have Spanish as one of its official languages, and can, as such, not truly be counted in the list of 20 Spanish-speaking countries. Cuba is a Caribbean island nation with a population of over 11 million people.\n\nIn Central America, there are seven countries where Spanish is the official language: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize. These countries have diverse cultures and histories, but they share many commonalities, including a love of music, dance, and traditional crafts.\n\nSouth America is home to nine Spanish speaking countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. These countries are known for their stunning natural landscapes, including the Andes mountains, the Amazon rainforest, and the beaches of the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. They also have vibrant cultural traditions, ranging from tango in Argentina to the colorful festivals of Peru and Bolivia.\n\nIn Africa, there is a Spanish-speaking country and a Spanish-speaking region: Equatorial Guinea and Western Sahara. Equatorial Guinea is a small country located on the west coast of Africa, while Western Sahara is a disputed territory located in the northwest of the continent.\n\nCountries That Speak Spanish\n\nLargest Spanish Speaking Country\n\nWith a population of over 126 million people, Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. It is located in North America and shares borders with the United States, Belize, and Guatemala.
