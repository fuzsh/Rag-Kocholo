As a native language, Spanish is ahead of English, but behind Chinese, which has the world’s most native speakers.\n\nIf we include everyone who speaks decent Spanish as a second language, we can use Spanish to communicate with 591 million people worldwide! This makes Spanish the third most-spoken language in the world, behind Chinese and English, and on par with Hindi.\n\nSpanish is also one of the most-used languages on the internet, with huge Spanish-language communities on international social networks.\n\nNot to mention the fact that Spanish is continuing to grow in traditionally non-Spanish speaking countries.\n\nLet’s take the United States, for example, where over 60 million people identified as being of Hispanic origin in the 2019 census, comprising more than 18% of the country’s population. The Spanish language has by far the most native speakers in the country, with 12% of the American population using it as their primary language in 2021.\n\nAy caramba!\n\nList Of Spanish Speaking Countries\n\nIf you are planning to learn Spanish, or have already nailed down some of the basics, then there are tons of attractive options for putting your Español to the test.\n\nTo be exact, 21 countries have Spanish as their official language.\n\nMexico\n\nColombia\n\nSpain\n\nArgentina\n\nPerú\n\nVenezuela\n\nChile\n\nEcuador\n\nGuatemala\n\nCuba\n\nBolivia\n\nDominican Republic\n\nHonduras\n\nParaguay\n\nEl Salvador\n\nNicaragua\n\nCosta Rica\n\nPanama\n\nUruguay\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nEquatorial Guinea\n\n1.

Equatorial Guinea\n\nThe final Spanish-speaking country is located in….…AFRICA.\n\n(Yes, it also took us by surprise.)\n\nAround a third of the population in Equatorial Guinea speak Spanish, while French, Fang, and Bubi are also spoken. The main part of the country is situated on the Atlantic Coast in central Africa, while the capital city of Malabo is on the island of Bioko off the coast of Cameroon.\n\nDespite boasting a terrain that features plains, valleys, rainforests and volcanoes, it seems like tourism hasn’t quite taken off, with Equatorial Guinea being among the least-visited countries in the world.\n\nWhile there isn’t a whole pile of available information on traveling there, Equatorial Guinea is currently categorized as Level 1 (exercise normal precautions) by the US Department of State Travel Advisory, which means it’s pretty safe to travel.\n\nBonus Country: the Philippines\n\nOk, while the Philippines is no longer officially a Spanish speaking country these days, this wasn’t always the case.\n\nUp until 1987, Spanish was a co-official language of the Philippines, along with English.\n\nAlthough the language is on the decline since the change, Philippine Spanish (a variant of standard Spanish) is still popular with many locals continuing to speak it, and schools continuing to teach it.\n\nWhich means you may find pockets of Spanish speakers if you ever travel around the Philippines.\n\nAnd if not, just hit the beaches."
