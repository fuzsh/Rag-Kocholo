        "text": "The Rama language, known as ‘the tiger language’ by speakers, is one of the Indigenous languages of the Chibchan family, spoken by the Rama people on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. In 2009, there were an estimated 800 speakers remaining, but in recent years estimations have dropped to around 30-50 native speakers. Unfortunately, these speakers are now facing further threats and displacement, due to the advance of the agricultural frontier from inland and plans for building a train line which would cut right through the traditional Raman land. Taking this into account, there is an urgent need for the creation of language learning resources and opportunities.\n\nErvin’s objective is to emphasize the preservation of intangible heritage and the right to promote and protect the Rama language as a cultural element. The objectives of the project include promoting the participation of the community in learning the ancestral language through endogenous education. To achieve these goals, Ervin is establishing a language revitalization education program in three communities. Long term goals of Ervin’s include developing choir teams to showcase Rama culture and artistic talents, training Indigenous Rama teachers, founding a museum, and creating a master-apprentice program. By empowering the community and promoting cultural expressions, Ervin hopes that his project will advance the recovery of Rama culture and language and strengthen his community’s cultural identity and self-appreciation."
