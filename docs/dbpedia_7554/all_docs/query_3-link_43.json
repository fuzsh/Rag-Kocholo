If you want to skip our discussion on global language trends, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with Most Spanish Speakers Heading into 2024.\n\nSpanish is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is the official language in 21 countries globally, across 4 continents. Currently, the US has almost 57 million Spanish speakers, out of which 42 million are native Spanish speakers while the rest are bilingual. Around 10 million of these Spanish speakers are from California. It comes as no surprise that Spanish is the second most spoken language in the US. According to a report by Cervantes Institute, there are 496 million native Spanish speakers in the world in addition to almost 100 million non-native Spanish speakers. The total Spanish-speaking population in the world amounts to 595 million, out of which 21% reside in Mexico, making it the country with the most Spanish speakers in the world. This is one of the reasons why North America has more native and non-native Spanish speakers than South America, despite the latter having a combination of Hispanic countries. The largest Spanish-speaking country in South America is Columbia, with a total of 52 million Spanish speakers.\n\nSpanish ranks second in the list of the most spoken native languages, right behind Mandarin Chinese. It is also the fourth most spoken language in the world, following English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindi. Notably, it is recognized as one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Additionally, when considering usage on the internet and social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Wikipedia, Spanish ranks as the second most used language on the former and the third most used on the latter.\n\nLanguage Dynamics in a Globalized World\n\nBesides the Americas and the Caribbean, Spanish is also spoken widely in parts of Africa and Europe. Equatorial Guinea stands as the sole African country with Spanish as its official language. Approximately 68% of the country's population are Spanish speakers. While Spanish may not be the primary language, it is commonly used in Northern Africa, particularly in Morocco, which shares a close geographical proximity with Spain. Moving to Asia, while Spanish is not the official language in any Asian country, the Philippines has approximately 3 million Spanish speakers at present. This is because the Philippines was a Spanish colony from 1565 to 1898 and had Spanish as a co-official language along with English till 1987. It's interesting to note that Spain accounts for less than 10% of the total Spanish speakers in the world. According to the Cervantes Institute, Spanish is experiencing growth as a native language, a contrast to the declining trends seen in other languages such as English, French, and Chinese in terms of native speakers. Currently, 7.6% of the world’s population speaks Spanish, and this number is expected to increase by 0.1% by 2050. This means that there will be almost 750 million Spanish speakers in the world within the next three decades.

This is particularly true for those residing in the US, where a significant portion of the population speaks Spanish. The importance of Spanish proficiency is also emphasized by the strong trade connections, notably with Mexico, the United States' largest trading partner, accounting for $600 billion in trade during the first nine months of 2023. Due to trade tensions between the US and China, analysts predict that Mexico is likely to experience a significant increase in employment opportunities and business growth as American companies explore the relocation of manufacturing operations and shift supply-chain reliance from China to Mexico. Among the top Mexican companies engaging in trade with the US is Grupo Simec, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV:SIMECB), specializing in steel manufacturing for the automotive, construction, and manufacturing sectors in the US and Canada. Additional successful Mexican trade partners in the American market include Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:KOF) and Gruma, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV:GRUMAB).\n\nHere's what Harding Loevner said about Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:KOF) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the countries with most Spanish speakers heading into 2024, we consulted a report by the Instituto Cervantes, a non-profit Spanish public institution established in 1991.
