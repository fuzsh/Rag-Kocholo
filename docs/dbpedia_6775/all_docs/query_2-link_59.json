        "text": "The F-22 Raptor fighter jet, which is expected to be replaced by the ‘Next Generation Air Dominance’ (NGAD) aircraft, has demonstrated its position as a key warplane in the United States Air Force (USAF) inventory.\n\nIn a recent show of force and growing military integration, the Raptors participated in Australia’s large military drill, ‘Pitch Black 2024.’ The US Air Force sent six F-22 Raptors from the 27th Fighter Squadron at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va., to Tindal last month—marking the first time the F-22A took part in this exercise.\n\nThe USAF noted that the Raptors flew about 80 sorties throughout the drills while integrating with 19 other countries. The USAF maintains that the F-22A has a distinct advantage in any combat scenario due to its advanced stealth technology, remarkable maneuverability, and ability to supercruise.\n\nThe service said in its official statement that “Its deployment in Exercise Pitch Black allows European and Pacific Forces alike to experience firsthand the operational advantages it brings, fostering interoperability and enhancing collective defense strategies.”\n\nPepsi, Where’s My Fighter Jet? When A College Student Took Cola Giant Pepsi To Court Over “Fake Advert”\n\nThe deployment is of considerable importance, as Australia could potentially support the United States in the event of an expanded Indo-Pacific conflict involving China.\n\nIt has been widely understood that in case of a conflict between the US and China over Taiwan, US military bases in the Pacific, like Hawaii and Guam, could be used as launchpads for US air operations. However, if the US has access to the Darwin air base and Australia decides to assist the US, this Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base could be used by US fighters and bombers for Indo-Pacific operations.\n\nCanberra, however, has not shown any interest in assisting the US in a conflict with Beijing.\n\nNonetheless, the first-ever deployment of the F-22 Raptor to the Australian military drills is noteworthy, occurring amidst ongoing debates about its future within the military. While the Raptors were initially slated to be retired and succeeded by the sixth-generation NGAD by the 2040s, the current uncertainty regarding the NGAD leaves the Raptors without a designated successor for the time being.\n\nAir Force Secretary Frank Kendall announced on July 30 that the US Air Force would pause the Next Generation Air Dominance program for several months to assess whether it is “on the right course” with the fighter program meant to replace the F-22.\n\nBangladesh Becomes 9th Country Under Military Rule; Why B’Desh Army Is Unlikely To Go The Pakistan Way?\n\nGen. Kenneth S. Wilsbach, head of Air Combat Command, had said, “There isn’t an F-22 replacement.” “The F-22 is a fantastic aircraft. We’re actually planning several upgrades to the jet as we speak, and there is no official replacement to the F-22 right now.” He explained: “There is no official F-22 replacement. There isn’t. Because we haven’t decided…We haven’t done a source selection.”\n\n‘Raptor Salad’ For Lunch! US F-22 Raptor Outgunned, Outmaneuvered By German Eurofighter Typhoon?\n\nOn top of that, there is an increasing push to keep the older F-22 Raptors that the military has been planning to retire for some time. The USAF intends to retire 32 older Block 20 jets, as upgrading them is projected to cost millions of dollars, which the service believes could be better allocated elsewhere. Nevertheless, even the watchdog Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the possibility of decommissioning of these aging fifth-generation jets.\n\nAmid the chaotic uncertainty surrounding the NGAD and the challenges faced by the USAF in retiring the F-22 Raptors, these aircraft have emerged as the ‘fighter of choice’ for forward deployment in tense areas, aimed at deterring adversaries of the United States as well as its allies.\n\nRaptors Are Everywhere!\n\nWith tensions flaring between Iran and Israel in the wake of Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination on Iranian soil, a USAF fighter squadron consisting of stealthy F-22 Raptors has reportedly been dispatched to Iran’s doorstep along with other cutting-edge equipment.\n\nThe deployment of USAF’s premier fifth-generation aircraft comes even though the F-15E Strike Eagles, the F-16 Fighting Falcons, and the A-10 Warthogs are already deployed to the US Central Command. While the F-22 Raptor has not been used in combat against Iran, its capabilities and prowess offer a strategic advantage to the US military.\n\nStealth ‘Shock’ For Iran: How F-22 Raptor Stunned IrAF Fighter In 2013 By Flying ‘Undetected’ Under Its Belly\n\nThe Raptor’s stealth, speed, and advanced systems provide massive operational benefits, from securing air dominance to supporting broader military objectives in the hostile region.\n\nThe Raptors were earlier deployed to the Middle East in June 2023 owing to concerns about ‘unsafe and unprofessional behavior’ by Russian aircraft.\n\nAt that time, CENTCOM commander Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla said, “Russian Forces’ unsafe and unprofessional behavior is not what we expect from a professional air force. Their regular violation of agreed-upon airspace deconfliction measures increases the risk of escalation or miscalculation.”\n\nThe US has extensively deployed its Raptors to deter all its key adversaries. In addition to Russia, the Raptors were sent to challenge China earlier this year when they were deployed to Japan’s Kadena Air Base as part of a rotation system adopted by US forces in Japan. The deployment has since been touted as a US attempt at stationing its fifth-generation stealth fighters closer to its primary adversaries’ borders.\n\nThe deployment of Raptors to Kadena is a strategic move in response to the increasing presence of Chinese J-20s. The move is aimed to ensure that the US retains a technological and tactical advantage in the area.\n\nThe USAF Raptors have also visited another country that remains embroiled in tension with China. In March last year, two US Air Force F-22 Raptors landed at Clark Air Base in the Philippines amid rising tensions in the South China Sea.\n\n“This was the first time that F-22s, or any fifth-generation aircraft, have landed on and operated out of the Philippines,” said Capt. Karl Schroeder, a Raptor pilot.\n\nThe F-22 Raptors also roared over a key US ally, South Korea, in May 2024. On May 16, in a significant display of military cooperation, a pair of US Air Force F-22 Raptors engaged in a rare dogfighting exercise with South Korean F-35As over the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe F-22s belong to the 19th and 199th fighter squadrons, underscoring the strategic importance of the deployment. The Department of Defense stated, “The Raptor’s visit to Korea demonstrates the capability of the US Pacific Air Force to deploy power at various strategic points to strengthen command and control in the Indo-Pacific region.”\n\nThe 8th Fighter Wing at Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, which hosted the F-22s, highlighted that the Raptors would help test Agile Combat Employment (ACE) capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nSix B-52 Bombers ‘Shot Down’ In One Night: How Russian AD Missiles Wreaked Havoc On Stratofortress During Vietnam War\n\nACE comprises small groups of airmen and aircraft operating from remote or challenging bases, facilitating quick movement and deployment. The US Air Force has been intensifying ACE training, and the F-22s play a significant role in the strategy.\n\nGiven these deployments worldwide, it is safe to say that the F-22 Raptors are the mainstay of the US Air Force and are expected to remain so until a successor is identified and developed. For now, the Raptors continue to roar, secure, and deter."
