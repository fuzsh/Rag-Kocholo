Davis, Jr.\n\nThe 51st Fighter Wing (51 FW) is a wing of the United States Air Force and the host unit at Osan Air Base, South Korea.\n\nThe 51st Fighter Wing is under Pacific Air Forces' Seventh Air Force. The unit is the most forward deployed wing in the world, providing combat ready forces for close air support, air strike control, counter air, interdiction, theater airlift, and communications in the defense of the Republic of Korea. The wing executes military operations to beddown, maintain and employ follow-on forces for the combined arms base that includes three major flying tenants and large multiservice fighting units.\n\nThe wing is equipped with General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons and Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II squadrons and myriad base support agencies conducting the full spectrum of missions providing for the defense of the Republic of Korea.\n\nMission[]\n\nThe mission of the 51st FW is to provide mission-ready Airmen to execute combat operations and receive follow-on forces. The wing accomplishes this mission through:\n\nConducting exercises to ensure our forces maintain the highest degree of readiness to defend Osan AB against air and ground attack.\n\nMaintaining and administering U.S. operations at Osan and five collocated operating bases—Taegu, Suwon, Kwang Ju, Kimhae and Cheong Ju – for reception and beddown of follow-on forces.\n\nProviding timely and accurate air power in support of military operations directed by higher headquarters.\n\nUnits[]\n\nThe 51st Fighter Wing is composed of four groups each with specific functions. The Operations Group controls all flying and airfield operations. The Maintenance Group performs maintenance of aircraft, ground equipment and aircraft components. The Mission Support Group has a wide range of responsibilities but a few of its functions are Security, Civil Engineering, Communications, Personnel Management, Logistics, Services and Contracting support.

Korean War operational squadrons were:\n\n16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron: duration (F-80C, F-86F)\n\n25th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron: duration (F-80C, F-86F)\n\n26th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron: duration (F-80C, F-86F)\n\n39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron: attached 1 June 1952- (F-80C, F-86F)\n\n68th Fighter-All Weather Squadron: attached 25 September – 9 October 1950 (F-82F/G)\n\n80th Fighter-Bomber Squadron: attached 25 September – 20 December 1950 (F-80C)\n\nIt entered combat service flying the F-80C Shooting Star on 22 September of that year, when it moved to Itazuke AB, Japan, to support the breakout of the U.S. Eighth Army from the Pusan Perimeter. For nearly 4 years thereafter, the 51st FIW played a key role in the defense of South Korea despite moving to four different locations within a year and operating under austere conditions.\n\nThe wing moved to South Korea in October only to return to Japan in December, leaving combat elements behind. In May 1951, the 51st FIW moved to Suwon Air Base, southwest of Seoul, but retained maintenance and supply elements at Tsuiki AB, Japan, to provide rear echelon support. In November 1951 the 51st FIW transitioned to the F-86 Sabre with two squadrons (16th, 25th), adding a third squadron (26th) the following May.\n\nThe group operated a detachment at Suwon AB, Korea, beginning in May 1951, and relocated there in October 1951, with maintenance and supply elements remaining in Japan until August 1954. The wing ceased combat on 27 July 1953. The 51 FIW's war record was impressive. Wing pilots flew more than 45,000 sorties and shot down 312 MiG-15s; this produced 14 air aces including the top ace of the war, Captain Joseph C. McConnell. The ratio of aerial victories to losses was 10 to 1. Unfortunately, the wing lost 32 pilots to enemy action; however, nine that became prisoners of war were repatriated later.\n\nCold War[]\n\nOn 1 August 1954, the 51 FIW returned to Naha Air Base to resume air defense coverage of the Ryukyu Islands. Operational squadrons were the 16th, 25th 26th FISs. At the same time, the wing demonstrated its mobility readiness in response to three regional crises.\n\nFrom August 1958 to January 1959, the 51 FIW deployed eight F-86Ds to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base Taiwan to fly combat air support missions for Nationalist Chinese forces after mainland Communist Chinese forces shelled the Nationalist-held islands of Quemoy and Matsu. Six years later, the wing deployed 12 F-102s to the Philippines and South Vietnam from August to October 1964 for air defense against possible Communist North Vietnamese air attacks.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, crews of the 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing provided air defense of Naha AB, Okinawa, with F-102s. During the 1968 Pueblo crisis, the wing deployed 12 of is 33 aircraft to Suwon AB. On 31 May 1971, the 51st FIW was inactivated, ending almost 17 years of service in the Pacific from Naha when it was inactivated as the Air Force began scaling down its activities in Southeast Asia. In 1975 Naha Air Base closed.\n\nThe 51st was inactive for only five months. On 1 November 1971, the wing was redesignated the 51st Air Base Wing and activated at Osan Air Base, South Korea. At Osan, the 51st assumed the host responsibilities of the inactivated 6314th Support Wing at to include the Koon-ni range and a variety of remote sites. Operational squadrons of the 51st at Osan have been:\n\nFighter Squadrons\n\n25th Fighter Squadron (1992–present A-10, OA-10)\n\n36th Fighter Squadron (F-4E 1974-88), (F-16C/D 1988–present))\n\n497th Fighter Squadron (F-4E) (1982–84)\n\nModern era[]\n\nOn 1 October 1993, after a half-dozen name changes, the wing returned to its original and current designation as the 51st Fighter Wing. Since then, the 51st has stayed true to its proud heritage, ensuring the defense of South Korea as a proven combat force and as an able host ready to receive and integrate follow-on forces on the peninsula.\n\nLineage[]\n\nEstablished as 51 Fighter Wing on 10 August 1948\n\nActivated on 18 August 1948\n\nRedesignated 51 Fighter-Interceptor Wing on 1 February 1950\n\nInactivated on 31 May 1971\n\nRedesignated 51 Air Base Wing on 20 October 1971\n\nActivated on 1 November 1971\n\nRedesignated: 51 Composite Wing (Tactical) on 30 September 1974\n\nRedesignated: 51 Tactical Fighter Wing on 1 July 1982\n\nRedesignated: 51 Wing on 7 February 1992\n\nRedesignated: 51 Fighter Wing on 1 October 1993.\n\nAssignments[]\n\n1st Air Division, 18 August 1948\n\nThirteenth Air Force, 1 December 1948\n\nTwentieth Air Force, 16 May 1949\n\nAttached to Fifth Air Force, 25 September 1950 – 1 August 1954\n\nFurther attached to 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing, 25 September – 12 October 1950\n\n313th Air Division, 1 March 1955 – 31 May 1971\n\n314th Air Division, 1 November 1971\n\nSeventh Air Force, 8 September 1986–present\n\nComponents[]\n\nGroups\n\n5th Tactical Air Control (later, 5 Tactical Control; 5 Air Control) Group: 8 January 1980 – 20 June 1982; 1 October 1990 – 1 July 1993\n\n51st Fighter (later, 51 Fighter-Interceptor, 51 Fighter, 51 Operations) Group: 18 August 1948 – 25 October 1957 (detached 26 September – 12 October 1950, 16 August 1954 – 15 March 1955) ; 1 October 1990–present\n\nSquadrons\n\n16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron: attached 1 July – 24 October 1957, assigned 25 October 1957 – 24 December 1964\n\n19th Tactical Air Support Squadron: 30 September 1974 – 8 January 1980\n\n25th Fighter-Interceptor (later, 25 Tactical Fighter) Squadron: attached 1 July – 24 October 1957, assigned 25 October 1957 – 8 June 1960; 1 February 1981 – 31 June 1990\n\n36th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 30 September 1974 – 1 October 1990\n\n82d Fighter Interceptor Squadron: attached 17 February – 24 June 1966, assigned 25 June 1966 – 31 May 1971 (detached 30 January – 20 February 1968)\n\n318th Fighter Interceptor Squadron: attached 11–18 February 1968\n\n497th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 1 January 1982 – 24 January 1989\n\n555th Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 11 December 1964 – 15 March 1965 and 11 November 1965 – 25 February 1966\n\n558th Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 12 March – 15 June 1965\n\n559th Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 12 June – 15 November 1965.\n\nStations[]\n\nNaha Afld (later, Naha AB), Okinawa, 18 August 1948\n\nItazuke AB, Japan, 22 September 1950\n\nKimpo AB, South Korea, 10 October 1950\n\nItazuke AB, Japan, 10 December 1950\n\nTsuiki Air Base, Japan, 15 January 1951\n\nSuwon AB (K-13), South Korea, 1 October 1951 – 26 July 1954\n\nNaha AB, Okinawa, 1 August 1954 – 31 May 1971\n\nOsan AB, South Korea, 1 November 1971–present\n\nAircraft Assigned[]\n\nThe 51st FW’s aircrews have flown a variety of aircraft, including the P/F-51 Mustang, F-80 Shooting Star, F-82 Twin Mustang, F-86 Sabrejet, F-94 Starfire, F-102A Delta Dagger, F-4E Phantom II,RF-4C Phantom II F-106A Delta Dart, OV-10 Bronco, A-10 and OA-10 Thunderbolt II and several versions of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n\nCommanders[]\n\nThe list of commanders for the 51st Fighter Wing and its predecessors includes a wartime hero, Colonel Francis Gabreski, and an aviation pioneer, Tuskegee Airman Colonel Benjamin O.
