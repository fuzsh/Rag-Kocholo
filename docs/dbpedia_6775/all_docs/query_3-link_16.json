        "text": "ADAMS, DONALD EARL\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major Donald Earl Adams (AFSN: 0-14308A), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an armed enemy of the United Nations as a Pilot, 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 51st Fighter-Interceptor Group, FIFTH Air Force, on 3 May 1952. Leading a squadron of six F-86 type aircraft, Major Adams attacked a flight of twenty MIG type aircraft. In the ensuing battle, from 30,000 feet down to 5,000, Major Adams aggressively pressed the attack despite mechanical difficulties which resulted in sever frosting of his windscreen and rendered his sighting system useless. With an extraordinary display of airmanship and gunnery skill, Major Adams succeeded in destroying the flight leader of the enemy element. In succeeding maneuvers he observed a second aircraft and, unaware of the first destruction because of excessively reduced visibility, he attacked, believing this aircraft to be his first target escaping. Continuing his aggressive attack, he destroyed the second aircraft as well. The destruction of the two aircraft effectively broke up the enemy force. By his high personal courage, resourcefulness, and extraordinary flying skill, Major Adams reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: Caton, New York\n\nALESSI, VINCENT J.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nFirst Lieutenant Vincent J. Alessi, United States Air Force, was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action against the enemy in Korea as Navigator of a B-26 Bomber in the 13th Bombardment Squadron, FAR EAST Air Forces, on 9 January 1952. On that date, Lieutenant Alessi's pilot flew under low overcast on an armed reconnaissance over the heavily defended supply route between the towns of Namsi and Chongju. Although he was exposed to automatic weapons fire, he pressed repeated bombing and strafing attacks until a total of ten boxcars, five warehouses and three vehicles were destroyed by fire and explosion. Turning his attention to the enemy gun positions which were firing on him, he silenced 14 anti-aircraft batteries and destroyed four by explosion. At the completion of these devastating attacks, automatic weapons fire from the remaining gun position struck the aircraft, with one shell piercing the canopy and exploding in the pilot's face. Lieutenant Alessi assisted his pilot in safely returning the aircraft safely to base. Lieutenant Alessi's actions reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nAMELL, ZANE S.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major Zane S. Amell, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations as Flight Leader of four F-86 type aircraft, 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group, FIFTH Air Force, on 11 March 1952. Assigned the mission of protecting fighter bombers, Major Amell and his wingman continued a patrol alone after two aircraft in his flight aborted. Sighting a formation of eight MIG-15 type aircraft letting down for a pass at the fighter bombers, Major Amell immediately attacked, although outnumbered four to one, and destroyed one of the attackers. With his ammunition expended, he then positioned his wingman to continue the attack. His wingman expended his ammunition completely in damaging one of the MIG-15s. Without ammunition, and low on fuel, they were withdrawing when they sighted another formation of six MIG-15s. Major Amell unhesitatingly turned into them as if to attack, and with daring maneuvers, caused the enemy to break up and withdraw without a shot being fired. Through his selfless courage, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, Major Amell reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nANDERSON, RICHARD D.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Richard D. Anderson, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an armed enemy of the United Nations as a Pilot, 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 18th Fighter-Bomber Group, FIFTH Air Force, on 27 October 1951. Leading three flights of four F-51 type aircraft, Captain Anderson displayed outstanding leadership and flying skill in a successful bombing attack on a rail target at Kuni-Ri, Korea. Captain Anderson then led his flight in an attack with rockets and machine guns against the secondary target of supplies and troop billets at Youn-dong, Korea. When his number two man was hit by ground fire and forced to bail out, Captain Anderson maintained effective air cover despite battle damage to his aircraft, accurate ground fire, and insufficient fuel to guarantee safe return. As a result of his courageous actions the downed pilot was rescued within two hours and the mission accounted for the destruction of vital enemy supplies and transportation facilities. Through his high personal courage and superior airmanship, Captain Anderson reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nASLA, FELIX\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major Felix Asla, Jr., United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations as Flight Leader of four F-86 type aircraft, 336th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group, FIFTH Air Force, on 1 April 1952. While Major Asla and his flight were engaging six MIG-15s, they were attacked by another enemy flight. His wingman sustained a direct hit which destroyed nearly half the left wing. Despite being constantly under direct fire, Major Asla protected his wingman by turning into every pass made against the crippled F-86 by pairs of MIG-15s and successfully countered every thrust, damaging two of the enemy aircraft. Even though he knew his fuel was insufficient for his return to base, Major Asla continued his protective tactics until his wingman could bail out in a safe area. He then climbed to thirty eight thousand feet, glided back to friendly territory, and made a successful air-start, landing with less than twenty gallons of fuel. Through his selfless courage, skillful airmanship, and outstanding devotion to duty, Major Asla reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: La Grande, Oregon\n\nBABASA, JOESPH M.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Joseph M. Babasa, Jr., United States Air Force, for exceptional gallantry in action against an enemy as leader of a formation of B-26 attack bombers, for the 13th Bombardment Squadron (L), FIFTH Air Force, on 25 February 1951. Lieutenant Babasa was element leader of four-ship of F-51 planes dispatched to attack a reported convoy in the vicinity of Kuni-Ri, Korea. Because of the numerous lucrative targets, the flight remained in the area until shortage of ammunition forced withdrawal. Just as the flight regrouped for the return flight, it was attacked from the rear by four enemy MIG-15 planes. Lieutenant Babasa's aircraft was severely damaged in the right wing and he was wounded in the left hand. He was enjoined by his flight leader to seek protection by remaining with the other flight members, or to bail out if conditions warranted. Instead, Lieutenant Babasa disregarding his own safety turned to attack a MIG-15 in an effort to draw fire away from his comrades. By skillful maneuvering he scored several hits on the enemy ship. Lieutenant Babasa met six more attacks head on, in spite of his wound, a battle-damaged airplane, and no ammunition. Through his courage, daring and superior airmanship, Lieutenant Babasa reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: Bridgeport, Connecticut\n\nBAILEY, JOSEPH V.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Second Lieutenant Joseph V. Bailey, United States Air Force, for gallantry in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force during the period 29 June to 1 July 1950. Second Lieutenant Bailey volunteered to organize and lead a platoon of anti-aircraft artillery in the defense of the airstrip at Suwon, Korea at a time when no other friendly ground troops were in the area. On 29 and 30 June 1950, during repeated attacks by enemy aircraft against his gun position, Lieutenant Bailey, with utter disregard for his own personal safety, exposed himself directly to strafing attacks in order to direct the fire of his platoon and give instructions and encouragement where needed. This courageous action and cool leadership by Lieutenant Bailey, though resulting in his being wounded, caused the confirmed loss of two enemy aircraft and the probable loss of three more. The gallant action displayed by Lieutenant Bailey while defending the airstrip until ordered to evacuate is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nBALDWIN, RICHARD A.,\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain [then First Lieutenant] Richard A. Baldwin, United States Air Force, for extraordinary courage and gallantry in action on 21 May 1951, as flight leader of four F-80 type aircraft in aerial combat against the enemy on a pre-briefed close support mission to the Kyebang-san sector in Korea. Departing from an air base in Japan in extremely adverse weather conditions, he led his flight into the target area flying heading, time and distance, making an instrument let-down without radio aids, and breaking his flight out of the low overcast in a corridor of extremely mountainous terrain. He quickly oriented himself and made contact with a Tactical Controller who gave the flight a target of an estimated two battalions of enemy troops that were pinning down a force of friendly troops. The enemy was defending their positions with heavy anti-aircraft guns and numerous automatic weapons while their infantry was forcing its way up a steep draw towards the United Nations troops. Due to rain showers which reduced the visibility to less than one half mile, and the low ceiling that obscured the mountains on all sides, a normal attacking pass on the target was impossible. Although the Tactical Control aircraft aborted the mission and left the area because of the low ceiling and visibility, Captain Baldwin continued his attack against the enemy, and in the face of the heavy ground fire made repeated napalm runs and fifty caliber machine gun strafing passes. At the end of each pass it was necessary to put the flight into a tight string formation and to make a standard instrument procedure turn in the overcast. Captain Baldwin so effectively engaged the enemy that friendly ground forces later counted seven hundred enemy troops killed, large quantities of supplies and equipment destroyed. The courage and skillful leadership displayed by Captain Baldwin were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBALDWIN, ROBERT P.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Colonel Robert Percy Baldwin (AFSN: 0-7415A), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action while serving as Pilot of an F-86 Fighter Airplane and Commanding Officer of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Group, in action on 22 June 1953, in Korea. Colonel Baldwin distinguished himself while leading four (4) F-86 type aircraft on a fighter sweep along the Manchurian Border. He sighted four (4) enemy MIG-15 type aircraft pressing an attack against two (2) friendly aircraft and immediately led his flight into the enemy. After successfully breaking up the enemy attack, Colonel Baldwin rolled down on the trailing MIG and fired a short burst into his left wing and fuselage. Colonel Baldwin continued to score numerous hits as heavy smoke poured from both wings and the enemy aircraft went into a steep dive through the clouds. Colonel Baldwin followed him through the cloud layer and pulled up sharply to avoid hitting the ground. Later reports confirmed the destruction of the MiG. By his personal courage and exceptional flying ability in this action, Colonel Baldwin is credited with destroying his fifth (5th) MIG-15 type aircraft. Throughout his tour, Colonel Baldwin's aggressive spirit and mental alertness have brought great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: Los Angeles, California\n\nBANKS, RALPH E.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Ralph E. Banks, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations as Pilot of an F-86 type aircraft, 336th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group, FIFTH Air Force, on 10 March 1952. Leading a flight of four F-86 type aircraft, Captain Banks was assigned the mission of protecting an unarmed RF-80 type aircraft photographing high priority targets along the Yalu River. When the RF-80 was attacked by approximately eighteen MIG-15s, Captain Banks exposed himself to concentrated fire from the MIGs in engaging the two leading attackers. Completely disregarding personal safety and displaying superior airmanship, Captain Banks destroyed these two aircraft in rapid succession. His extraordinary courage and brilliant tactical skill in the face of determined opposition resulted in the destruction of two MIG-15s, the dispersal of the remaining aircraft, and the successful completion of an extremely vital reconnaissance mission. Through his high personal courage and keen professional skill, Captain Banks reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBECKER, RICHARD S.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Richard Samuel Becker (AFSN: AO-1908494), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy as Pilot, 334th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, FIFTH Air Force, on 9 September 1951. On that date, Captain Becker led a flight of six F-86 aircraft on a combat aerial patrol in the Sinuiju-Yalu River area of North Korea. Shortly after arriving in the target area, Captain Becker's flight sighted a formation of approximately 30 enemy MIG-15 planes in an advantageous position over his Squadron. He advised his squadron leader and the entire section turned to the attack. At this point, Captain Becker sighted a second enemy formation bearing down on his Squadron. Displaying outstanding airmanship, Captain Becker engaged this formation with a head-on pass, disrupting their planned assault and causing them to disperse. In the ensuing battle Captain Becker's flight became separated. Captain Becker rolled out of this attack alone at 39,000 feet. He prepared to withdraw when he sighted an enemy formation of 12 MIG-15s preparing to enter the battle. Captain Becker, although alone and with no possibility of friendly assistance, flew into their midst. The brilliance of his vicious assault on the enemy and the dauntlessness with which he engaged this enemy force totally disrupted them. Skillfully bringing his guns to bear on one of the enemy, Captain Becker destroyed him. Continuing to engage the remainder of the enemy formation until low on fuel, Captain Becker then eluded then and returned to his home base. The destruction of the enemy MIG-15 brought Captain Becker's score to five destroyed, one probably destroyed and two damaged in his 82 combat missions over North Korea, making him one of the JET aces in the world. Captain Becker's heroism and his brilliant airmanship reflect great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: Fleetwood, Pennsylvania\n\nBIGGS, ERNEST E.,\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major [then Captain] Ernest E. Biggs, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action on 3 December 1950 while flying in close support of the United Nations ground forces in the Chosin Reservoir area. Major Biggs led his flight of F-51 aircraft to the area in answer to an emergency call from elements of the First Marine Division who were surrounded by enemy forces. These elements were trying to evacuate approximately 900 wounded and were caught in a vicious cross fire. Major Biggs directed his flight in a devastating attack against the enemy, making pass after pass at an extremely low level in the face of heavy small arms and anti-aircraft fire. On his tenth pass, Major Biggs' aircraft received several direct hits by 20 MM shells which seriously damaged the left wing, left main gasoline tank and horizontal stabilizer. Despite the damage suffered by his aircraft, Major Biggs continued to press the attack on the enemy until his ammunition was expended. The heavy damage inflicted upon the enemy as a result of Major Biggs' intrepidity permitted the Marines to carry out their mission of evacuating wounded personnel. Major Biggs' courageous performance was in keeping with the highest traditions of the service, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBLAKE, JOHN E.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major John E. Blake, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy on 21 April 1951. On that date, Major Blake was Pilot of a B-26 attack bomber from the 13th Bombardment Squadron, (L-NI), FIFTH Air Force, on a single plane low-level combat mission over Korea. Major Blake successfully reached the target area despite the hazardous weather conditions. In the vicinity of the target he encountered intense and accurate anti-aircraft fire from many dug-in gun emplacements. Although his plane did not have turret guns to give additional protection during the low level attacks, he proceeded to bomb and strafe repeatedly, destroying a multiple mount .50 caliber gun emplacement, and silencing all anti-aircraft fire in the area. major Blake then located five railroad engines in a marshalling yard south of Songchon. Again under heavy anti-aircraft fire which shot two radio antennae off his aircraft and inflicted other damage, he made repeated attacks, destroying one locomotive, damaging four others, and damaging fifteen boxcars. After expending all bombs and ammunition, Major Blake remained in the target area until after daylight to observe any movement of rolling stock. At daylight he called for fighter aircraft and led them to the railroad yards. Disregarding the fact that he had no armament; Major Blake made a simulated attack on the targets and positively identified them to the fighter aircraft, insuring complete destruction. He then turned homeward after five hours in the target area. Through his outstanding skill, heroism and devotion to duty, Major Blake reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBLAND, KENNETH R.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Kenneth R. Bland (AFSN: 0-22818A), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an armed enemy of the United Nations as Lead Navigator-Bombardier, 728th Bombardment Squadron, 452nd Bombardment Group, on 30 November 1950. Leading a flight of four B-26 type aircraft in an attack against the Chinese Communist forces at Kunu-ri, Korea, Lieutenant Bland demonstrated outstanding gallantry, airmanship, and resourcefulness, the combination of which was greatly responsible for the safe evacuation of a large number of friendly forces from Kunu-ri. Lieutenant Bland planned and led a devastating attack against a huge ground force in such a manner that a major Communist advance was stalled. Lieutenant Bland, utilizing a self-invented bombsight, led his flight directly into the face of the enemy's gunfire, dropping bombs with unusual accuracy. Even though his own aircraft was damaged and his face and hands numbed by the sub-zero airblast from a hole in his aircraft, Lieutenant Bland refused to leave his bombsight, pin-pointing his fragmentation bombs with deadly accuracy. Later reports indicated that this lone airstrike so stalled the enemy's advance that friendly forces were allowed time to regroup over a wide front, and the trapped forces in Kunu-ri were able to escape. Through his keen professional ability, courage, and outstanding devotion to duty, Lieutenant Bland reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Force, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBOGGS, EDWARD H.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Edward H. Boggs, Technical Sergeant, U.S. Air Force, for gallantry in action and heroism against an enemy near Munsan, Korea, on 31 March 1951. On that date, Sergeant Boggs, an Aero Medical crew member on a rescue helicopter with Detachment 1, Third Air Rescue Squadron, flew to an area where critically wounded United Nations troops were cut off by enemy forces. The helicopter landed amidst enemy small arms, automatic weapons, and mortar fire. When he realized there were too many wounded men to evacuate before dark, Sergeant Boggs volunteered to remain on the ground with the trapped men in order that one additional wounded man could be evacuated on each flight to a nearby aid station. Sergeant Boggs was well aware that by remaining behind he would risk his own life. While the helicopter shuttled back and forth, Sergeant Boggs took full charge of the disorganized and weary group. He directed survivors to defensive positions in order to repulse enemy infiltration. Constantly exposing himself to enemy fire, Sergeant Boggs established a system of priority for evacuation and gave all first-aid possible. Not until the last wounded man was evacuated did Sergeant Boggs consider leaving the area. By his expert leadership and exceptional bravery under fire, Sergeant Boggs brought about the rescue of a large number of seriously wounded men. Sergeant Boggs' heroism and selflessness were in keeping with the highest tradition of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Air Forces, General Orders No. 30 (January 15, 1952)\n\nBOLING, JACK T.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Sergeant Jack T. Boling, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy as an Aero-Medical crew member, Detachment 1, Third Air Rescue Squadron on 3 July 1951. At the voluntary risk of his life, Sergeant Boling flew in a highly vulnerable helicopter ten miles into enemy-held territory to rescue a United States Marine fighter pilot who had parachuted from his stricken airplane near Sangyong, Korea. When the helicopter landed, Sergeant Boling observed that the downed pilot was injured and in his attempt to rise could only wave his arms. Disregarding the threat to his own safety, Sergeant Boling leaped out of the helicopter and ran through a hail of enemy small arms fire to the aid of the downed pilot. Although fully aware of the personal danger, he dragged the badly injured victim toward the rescue aircraft. Sergeant Boling signaled the helicopter pilot for assistance and together, the two helped the Marine pilot into the helicopter. During the flight to the nearest Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, Sergeant Boling rendered medical assistance. As a result of this mission, a United Nations Pilot was saved from certain death or capture. By his courage in the face of danger and his selfless devotion to duty, Sergeant Boling reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBORDEAUX, LYLE B.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Lyle B. Bordeaux, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action on 22 October 1951 as a B-29 Aircraft Commander, 30th Bombardment Squadron, 19th Bombardment Group (Medium), FIFTH Air Force. While on a strike against the vital Taechon airfield in Korea. Captain Bordeaux's aircraft was severely damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Displaying outstanding flying skill, Captain Bordeaux retained control of the aircraft and managed to drop his bombs on the target. Shortly afterwards, several members of the crew were wounded when the aircraft was hit by enemy fighters. With two engines out, Captain Bordeaux unable to maintain altitude, and with almost all flight controls shot away, piloted his crippled aircraft to a friendly island near Seoul, Korea, in order to avoid abandoning the plane over enemy lines. Steadily losing altitude, Captain Bordeaux circled the small island until all members of the crew had parachuted to safety. At that time, with the aircraft impossible to control, Captain Bordeaux bailed out at an altitude of less than 1,000 feet. His skillful handling of this critical situation resulted in the rescue of all twelve crew men without serious injury. Captain Bordeaux's courage, skill and devotion to duty reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBRIDGE, CHARLES F.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Charles F. Bridge, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against the enemy on 6 April 1951. While piloting an unarmed T-6 aircraft on a reconnaissance mission over enemy territory in the vicinity of Chodo-ri, Korea, Lieutenant Bridge observed enemy installations consisting of supplies, ammunition dumps, vehicles, and gun emplacements. Because of poor visibility, fighter aircraft could not penetrate the target area. Returning that afternoon, Lieutenant Bridge again located the targets and, despite the limited visibility effectively directed thirteen F4U and five AD type aircraft to the targets. At great personal risk, Lieutenant Bridge made extremely low passes in the face of intense enemy ground fire to pinpoint the targets for the fighter aircraft. These strikes resulted in the destruction of nine ammunition dumps, four gun emplacements, numerous supplies and vehicles, and inflicted a large number of enemy casualties. While over the target area, Lieutenant Bridge's aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire, which necessitated landing at an advanced airstrip for repairs. After necessary repairs were made, Lieutenant Bridge, undaunted by enemy fire, returned to the target area to observe the damage inflicted by the fighter aircraft. Lieutenant Bridge's courage, determination, and outstanding skill in the face of great danger were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBROWN, WARREN G.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Warren G. Brown, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations on 18 February 1952 as Flight Leader of two F-51 type aircraft, 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 18th Fighter-Bomber Group, FIFTH Air Force. Lieutenant Brown displayed outstanding airmanship and courage when his flight was diverted from its primary mission to relieve another flight of United Nations aircraft in setting up a protective cover over a downed United Nations pilot. After numerous passes over the area, Lieutenant Brown's wingman abandoned his aircraft after he had received a direct hit, whereupon Lieutenant Brown began a one-man assault on enemy gun positions which were hampering rescue attempts. Although extremely heavy fire prevented the rescue of the downed pilot, and despite major damage to his aircraft, Lieutenant brown left the area only after completely destroying three anti-aircraft position, thus demonstrating courage beyond the call of duty in the face of enemy attack. By his gallantry and devotion to duty, Lieutenant Brown brought great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBROWNING, JOHN R.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain John R. Browning, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against the enemy while serving as navigator aboard a B-26 attack bomber assigned to a night intruder mission over enemy territory in Korea on 28 November 1950. While attacking enemy installations at low level near the Manchurian Border, Captain Browning's aircraft was damaged so severely by anti-aircraft fire that it was unable to climb above the mountainous terrain to return to friendly territory. Captain Browning thereupon demonstrated extraordinary navigational skill in directing a course down narrow valleys and treacherous mountain passes in spite of darkness and falling snow. He accomplished this remarkable feat solely by means of dead reckoning, since the only available navigational aids were his maps and his compass. Captain Browning eventually directed the aircraft out of the mountainous area through a low pass, and set a heading for friendly territory. On the final approach to the air base at Taegu the airplane hit a small hill and burst into flames. Although semiconscious when taken from the burning wreckage Captain Browning and the pilot reentered the aircraft amid exploding machine gun ammunition and rescued the severely injured gunner. The performance of Captain Browning was in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBRYSON, JAMES K.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to James K. Bryson, Staff Sergeant, U.S. Air Force, for gallantry in action against the enemy on 23 November 1950 by assisting in the rescue of an injured American fighter pilot deep in enemy territory, five miles south of Kanggye, Korea. Sergeant Bryson, assigned as medical technician crew member of a rescue helicopter, volunteered for a pilot pick-up mission with full knowledge that the immediate area of the pick-up contained numerous enemy troops, and that the fuel supply of the helicopter might not be sufficient for the return flight to friendly territory. After flying eighty miles behind enemy lines, the helicopter landed near the injured pilot who had fired a flare to expose his position. Enemy troops immediately opened fire with automatic weapons and rifles. With complete disregard for his own life, Staff Sergeant Bryson jumped from the helicopter and ran to the aid of the injured pilot. With enemy fire striking dangerously near, often as close as two feet, Sergeant Bryson assisted the injured pilot to the helicopter. While taking off, the helicopter was hit in the tail cone, but succeeded in returning to Sinanju. Sergeant Bryson's courage in the face of enemy fire was in keeping with the highest traditions of the service, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBUFKIN, ALLEN S.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Allen S. Bufkin (AFSN: AO-765924), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against the enemy as a pilot of the 452d Bomb Wing (Light), FIFTH Air Force, on 7 May 1951. The mission was to attack troop and supply concentrations in the Kumch'on area, followed by an armed reconnaissance over an enemy supply route. The troops and supplies were attacked with excellent results. On the road reconnaissance the lead aircraft was hit badly by enemy ground fire, requiring crew members to bail out over the Sinmak area. Lieutenant Bufkin immediately organized air cover for the downed crewmen and called for rescue aircraft. Since the area was heavily infested with enemy troops, immediate capture of the crewmen appeared inevitable. Lieutenant Bufkin strafed the area around the downed airmen and drove the enemy back. Heavy, intense ground fire was encountered on the strafing runs and critical battle damage was sustained by his aircraft. Undaunted, Lieutenant Bufkin continued to strafe the area for two hours and forty-five minutes, killing some eighty enemy troops and accomplished successful rescue of the crew. Through his courage, skill and devotion to duty, Lieutenant Bufkin reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nBURNS, ROBERT J.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Technical Sergeant Robert J. Burns, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against the enemy in Korea on 2 February 1951. On this date, Sergeant Burns served as a medical technician aboard a helicopter dispatched to attempt the rescue of two downed airmen thirty miles behind enemy lines. As the helicopter landed near the surrounded airmen, Sergeant Burns, ignoring the heavy enemy fire that was immediately directed at him, left the aircraft to shift the ballast can and to assist the injured airmen into the helicopter. While he was attempting to place the ballast can in the rear compartment, four bullets struck the helicopter. One of these bullets embedded itself in the aircraft dangerously close to Sergeant Burns' head. While taking off with the injured men aboard, the helicopter was again struck by enemy fire. During the return flight to friendly territory, Sergeant Burns demonstrated exceptional skill in administering first aid to the injured airmen, thereby considerably relieving their suffering. The outstanding courage and the exemplary devotion to duty displayed by Sergeant Burns was in keeping with the highest traditions of the service. His performance reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCAGE, PHIL B.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Phil B. Cage, Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Air Force, for gallantry in action against the enemy on 8 December 1950. Landing his C-47 transport airplane on a 1900 foot landing strip that had been hastily scraped from frozen sod at Koto-Ri, Korea, he effected the evacuation of 19 casualties who were doomed to perish from exposure or enemy capture. The peculiar location of the landing strip, which was the only level spot in the vicinity of the battlefront, made it necessary for Colonel Cage to fly his C-47 down a narrow valley which was flanked on both sides by thousands of enemy troops. As he let down on his approach to the landing strip, ridges, 2000 feet high, formed a physical hazard on each side. This hazard was further increased by intense napalm smoke, burning of abandoned supplies, and a light falling snow. As a follow-up to his daring flight, 312 additional wounded troops were swiftly evacuated by other C-47 pilots who emulated his example. Colonel Cage accomplished his mission literally within range of overwhelming enemy forces who surged to within 200 yards of Koto-Ri airstrip. His heroism, courageous devotion to duty, and superior leadership reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Air Forces, General Orders No. 22 (30 January 1951)\n\nCALHOUN, JOHN R.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant John R. Calhoun, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations as pilot of an unarmed H-5 helicopter with Detachment 1, 3d Air Rescue Squadron, FIFTH Air Force, on 27 March 1952. Lieutenant Calhoun flew his aircraft over one hundred miles into enemy territory to rescue a captured United Nations pilot and return him to safety in friendly territory. Despite the fact that fighter cover reported that the downed pilot had been taken captive by enemy troops, Lieutenant Calhoun flew his unarmed helicopter to the site of the troops and, although unable to land and extremely vulnerable to enemy fire, helped the downed airman to effect an escape from the enemy. With the airman dangling on the side of the helicopter and the enemy firing upon him, Lieutenant Calhoun skillfully flew his damaged aircraft from the location of the pickup and aided in hoisting the man to safety in the helicopter. Through his skillful airmanship and high courage in completely disregarding personal safety, Lieutenant Calhoun effected the escape of a United Nations pilot from his captors, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCARLISLE, PAUL L.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Paul L. Carlisle, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy as Fighter Pilot, 36th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, FIFTH Air Force, on 23 November 1950. On that date Captain Carlisle flew on a combat mission against the enemy near Mupyongni, Korea. Captain Carlisle led a flight of two F-51 type aircraft on a pre-briefed mission to fly Combat Air Patrol over a downed pilot of his squadron. Because of low ceilings, darkness and adverse weather conditions, it was doubtful that the flight could penetrate into the search area. However, despite these obstacles, Captain Carlisle departed from an advance airfield in Korea on a pre-dawn take-off. He displayed outstanding navigational ability, leading his flight to the area of the downed pilot by following river beds and railroads beneath the overcast. Captain Carlisle aggressively pressed the attack against enemy forces advancing towards the downed pilot, destroying machine gun positions and continually driving the enemy back to cover. He continued to press daring passes in the face of intense ground fire, making some non-firing passes to conserve ammunition. Each pass deterred the enemy and allowed the friendly pilot to re-position himself. After flying over the downed pilot for three hours, Captain Carlisle's aircraft received a direct hit in the engine section, causing partial loss of power, restricting his aircraft to slow speed. Even though his aircraft was damaged, rather than leave the downed pilot unprotected, Captain Carlisle courageously continued his protective cover, subjecting himself to intense enemy ground fire. For two additional hours, he patrolled the area, making passes to the attacking enemy, killing an un-estimated number of enemy soldiers and destroying many gun positions. Repeated attempts were made by the enemy to reach the downed pilot but each attack was beaten off and repulsed by Captain Carlisle's skillful maneuvering and aggressive counter attacks. For five hours, this protective cover was flown over the friendly pilot. After the rescue helicopter arrived and the pilot was successfully evacuated, Captain Carlisle proceeded to the nearest friendly airfield with minimum fuel remaining. Through the risk of his own life, Captain Carlisle was directly responsible for saving a fellow pilot's life. Captain Carlisle's courage and gallant action were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCARLTON, MERRILL H.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Merrill H. Carlton, Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Air Force, for meritorious achievement and conspicuous gallantry in aerial flight on 20 July 1950 in support of the United Nations Forces as pilot of and unarmed T-6 aircraft in the vicinity of Tanyang, Korea. While on a visual reconnaissance flight over mountainous terrain, deep in enemy territory, with enemy air opposition probable and expected, Lieutenant Colonel (then Major) Carlton observed several gun positions, three vehicles, and five hay stacks which later proved to be camouflaged enemy medium tanks waiting to attack friendly forces. Realizing the military value of the targets and the damage that could be inflicted on friendly troops, Colonel Carlton immediately vectored friendly fighter aircraft to the area. With complete disregard for personal safety he dove his aircraft to within a few feet of the ground to pinpoint the targets for the fighters. Although enemy ground fire had damaged his aircraft and the enemy attacks continued, Colonel Carlton remained in the area and directed the fighter strike which resulted in total destruction of three gun positions, three vehicles, three tanks, and rendered the remainder ineffective in battle. The aggressiveness, courage under fire, and intense devotion to duty displayed by Colonel Carlton reflect great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Air Forces, General Orders No. 48 ( February 11, 1951)\n\n*CASSERLY, THOMAS F. (DNB)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to First Lieutenant Thomas Francis Casserly, III (AFSN: 20141A), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations as a Flight Leader of three F-51 type aircraft, 5235th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, FIFTH Air Force, while engaged in a search mission for a mission B-26 aircraft near the Chinanypo Estuary on 5 April 1952. Flying at low altitude and at a very low airspeed necessitated by the nature of the mission, the three aircraft sustained hits from intense and heavy automatic weapons fire. The number three aircraft was completely disabled and the pilot bailed out. Lieutenant Casserly immediately alerted rescue facilities and began firing passes on various gun positions and enemy troops who were trying to reach the downed pilot. Though his aircraft was hit twice and was not developing full power, and despite heavy ground fire, Lieutenant Casserly continued to press his attacks against the enemy. Lieutenant Casserly's strafing attacks kept the enemy troops clear of the downed pilot and reduced the heavy ground fire, enabling a helicopter to effect the rescue. By his heroic actions in disregarding his own personal safety to save a fellow pilot from certain capture, Lieutenant Casserly reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: South Orange, New Jersey\n\n*CHANDLER, RICHARD E. (POW)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Richard E. Chandler (AFSN: AO-720787), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations as a pilot, 13th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Photo Jet, on 23 June 1952. On that date, Captain Chandler flew an RF-86 aircraft, with an escort of F-86 aircraft, deep into enemy-held territory on a vital photographic reconnaissance mission. As the nature of his target precluded the possibility of protective cover from his escort, Captain chandler was forced to penetrate through to the target alone. He made repeated low-level photographic runs on his objective, diving each time into a hail of small arms and heavy weapons fire. Only through skillful employment of evasive tactics was he able to avoid damage to his aircraft. Successfully eluding jet aircraft sent aloft to intercept him, Captain Chandler rejoined his escort and led the flight safely home. The photographic intelligence Captain Chandler acquired on this mission proved invaluable to the United Nations in determining enemy capabilities and intentions. Through his keen flying ability, high personal courage and devotion to duty, Captain Chandler upheld the highest traditions of the military service, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCHASE, LEVI R.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Levi R. Chase, Colonel, U.S. Air Force, for gallantry in action against an armed enemy of the United Nations as Commanding Officer, 8th Fighter Bomber Group, on 11 July 1952. Knowing that the defense of the target area consisted of fifty-two heavy guns, sixteen of which were radar controlled, sixteen four-gun batteries of automatic weapons and an undetermined amount of intense small arms fire, Colonel Chase led the 8th Fighter bomber Group on three highly successful missions into this heavily defended area at Pyongyang, Korea. Colonel Chase so effectively planned the attack and employed evasive tactics that he led one hundred and eighty-one effective combat sorties through the intense enemy barrage without major damage or the loss of a single aircraft. This series of devastating attacks completely destroyed a vital communications and ordnance manufacturing plant, and inflicted major damage on a roundhouse and a locomotive repair plant. Through his outstanding courage, leadership, and professional skill, Colonel Chase was instrumental in reducing the war potential of the enemy, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCLAYVILLE, HOWARD G.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Howard G. Clayville, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action on 3 May 1951 over enemy-held territory in Korea. As deputy leader of a flight of B-26 attack bombers, Captain Clayville displayed outstanding leadership in directing attacks upon enemy supply lines and installations at Paup, which resulted in the total destruction of large sections of railroad track and equipment. On his second individual attack on the target, Captain Clayville's aircraft received three direct hits from enemy anti-aircraft fire. Relentlessly, Captain Clayville pressed the attack until all his ammunition was expended, and his aircraft so severely damaged that it was almost impossible to control. Captain Clayville considered bailed out, but decided against risking the lives of his crew. Using great physical strength, Captain Clayville kept his aircraft on course to a friendly air field. As the wheels touched, the emergency brake was applied but failed to function. Captain Clayville crash-landed with only minor injuries to his crew. The outstanding courage, flying skill and devotion to duty displayed by Captain Clayville reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCONATSER, MAX C.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Max C. Conatser, Major, U.S. Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy in the vicinity of Pyongyang, Korea, while commanding a Signal Construction Detachment in advance support of the Fifth Air Force. When evacuation was necessary, Major Conatser voluntarily remained at Pyongyang to destroy communication facilities in order to prevent their use by the enemy. On 3 December 1950, while preparing to evacuate his detachment, his convoy was bombed and strafed by the enemy and eight of ten trucks were immobilized. When a nearby ambulance caught fire and was knocked into a gasoline dump, Major Conatser, realizing the danger of explosion, and with total disregard for personal safety, rushed to the vehicle and removed it from the area. Major Conatser further exposed himself to danger by entering an abandoned ordnance depot and removing parts from bobby-trapped vehicles, enabling his men to quickly repair six vehicles and safely evacuate themselves. The exceptional courage and selfless devotion to duty displayed by Major Conatser were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Air Forces, General Orders No. 228 (May 10,1952)\n\nCOOK, ROGER H.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Roger H. Cook, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action on 7 January 1951 as pilot of a B-26 light bomber on a low-level attack against the heavily defended city of Suwon, Korea. Captain Cook flew his aircraft through sever storms to the target area, letting down in icing conditions through a six thousand foot overcast. He broke out just above the mountains, located the enemy and made two successful bomb runs, scoring direct hits on concentrated groups of enemy troops. During the runs his aircraft was damaged by flak and a fire started in the fuselage. Although the aircraft was filled with smoke, Captain Cook continued his low-level attacks with rockets, napalm and machine guns against the confused and disorganized enemy, killing and wounding many troops, destroying six buildings and leaving four more burning. The fire in his aircraft was eventually brought under control and he flew the damaged ship to home base. The skill, courage and devotion to duty displayed by Captain Cook were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCOOPER, ARTHUR S.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Arthur S. Cooper, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action on 6 December 1950. As deputy leader of a flight of B-26 type aircraft, Captain Cooper displayed outstanding flying skill and daring in pressing an attack against the heavily defended Kang Dong Air Strip in North Korea when other flights assigned to the same area failed to reach the target because of bad weather. Letting down under icing conditions through six thousand feet of overcast Captain Cooper's aircraft broke out of the overcast only a few feet above the mountainous terrain with a heavy formation of ice on its wings. Despite poor visibility, Captain Cooper flew through a flak-infested valley until he located and attacked the target. During this attack, the aircraft's main wing spar was demolished, the wing was partially wrenched from its seatings, several flight instruments were rendered useless, and gaping holes were made in the aircraft. In spite of this heavy battle damage, Captain Cooper continued attacking the enemy. As a result of his attacks, a large enemy ammunition dump was completely destroyed with a violent explosion which sent a maze of debris into the path of the low flying aircraft, four anti-aircraft positions were rendered ineffective and four supply buildings were burned. Only after expending the aircraft's entire armament of napalm, rockets, incendiary bombs and fifty caliber ammunition did Captain Cooper leave the target area. Captain Cooper's exceptional skill and gallant performance were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCOOPER, JOSEPH D.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Joseph D. Cooper, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States on 17 April 1951. Captain Cooper volunteered to pilot an unarmed, highly vulnerable H-19 helicopter deep into enemy territory on a mission to secure enemy material of vital intelligence value. Captain Cooper displayed outstanding skill and courage in airlifting a team of highly trained intelligence specialists to the reported location of the material despite heavy anti-aircraft and automatic weapons fire which was encountered over enemy territory and which damaged the helicopter engine. Acting with calm determination, Captain Cooper landed his aircraft and set up a defense position while the intelligence personnel collected the equipment and loaded it aboard the helicopter. This task, which required thirty-five minutes, was conducted under conditions of the greatest hazard. On the return flight, heavy anti-aircraft fire was again encountered, damaging one of the propeller blades. Despite severe vibrations, Captain Cooper skillfully controlled the crippled aircraft and flew it out to sea under intensified fire from land and shore batteries. After flying more than eighty miles over the Yellow Sea, he made an emergency landing on a small island under friendly control. From here the crew and equipment were later evacuated. The success of this mission provided the United States Air Force with urgently needed technical data concerning the performance, capabilities and operating mechanism of an important enemy weapon. Captain Cooper's resolute courage and exemplary devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCOREY, JOHNNY F.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Johnny F. Corey, First Lieutenant, U.S. Air Force, for himself by gallantry in action on 26 November 1950 while flying on a pre-briefed mission over enemy territory in Korea. While flying as an observer on an unarmed T-6 type aircraft, Lieutenant Corey heard a plea for assistance from an injured forward ground controller who was completely surrounded by a large number of enemy troops. Lieutenant Corey immediately proceeded to the area from which the signal had emanated. However, due to excessive smoke and haze, visibility was greatly restricted and only through exceptional alertness did he succeed in locating the injured man near an unfinished airstrip. When the aircraft landed, Lieutenant Corey, in the face of intense enemy fire, quickly helped the wounded man aboard the aircraft. By the time the rescue was completed, enemy forces were rapidly closing in from all directions, concentrating their fire on the aircraft and its occupants. By his decisive and valorous action, Lieutenant Corey saved the life of a member of the United Nations Forces. His unfailing courage under fire, conspicuous gallantry and unswerving devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the United Nations Forces and the United States Air Force.\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Air Forces, General Orders No. 127 (March 28,1951)\n\nCOTTON, J. W.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain J. W. Cotton, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action as pilot of an unarmed T-6 aircraft with the 6149th Tactical Control Squadron, (Air), FIFTH Air Force, in Korea on 24 June 1951. While on a low altitude reconnaissance mission in search of enemy troops and supply concentrations, Captain Cotton's aircraft received a direct hit through the canopy from an enemy machine gun position. As a result, he received a head injury and was temporarily stunned. Despite the wound and damaged condition of the aircraft, Captain Cotton remained in the target area for a period of more than two hours to direct the fire of fighter aircraft which had reported in for his control. In addition, he made frequent low passes through intense enemy small arms and automatic weapons fire to direct the fighters against the best targets. Through skillful direction of the fire power of the fighters, Captain Cotton was instrumental in destroying two enemy machine gun positions, one heavy gun position, and inflicting an estimated one hundred casualty score on enemy troops. Captain Cotton's courage and devotion to duty, reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCOVELL, HERBERT B.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Herbert B. Covell, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations as Pilot of a B-26 attack bomber, 3d Bombardment Wing (L), Fifth Air Force, on the night of 30 December 1952. Lieutenant Covell displayed outstanding airmanship and professional skill on a low level rail reconnaissance mission deep in North Korea. Lieutenant Covell sighted a highly lucrative target of five locomotives and thirty-seven boxcars in a marshalling yard and immediately attacked, despite hostile ground fire. Disregarding his own personal safety, Lieutenant Covell made repeated bombing and strafing passes which resulted in the destruction of three locomotives and ten boxcars and damage to two other locomotives and ten boxcars. Climbing to a high altitude, Lieutenant Covell contacted another B-26 attack bomber and directed it to the target area. His direction of this second aircraft aided in the destruction of one more locomotive and three more boxcars and damage to the remaining locomotive and the other boxcars. As a result of this mission, vital rail transportation facilities were destroyed, seriously hampering the enemy's potential in that area. By his outstanding gallantry in the face of the enemy and his keen tactical airmanship, Lieutenant Covell reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCOVILLE, ALAN\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Alan Coville, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations as a Pilot, 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing, Fifth Air Force, on 16 June 1952. On that date, Lieutenant Coville led a flight of four F-80 type aircraft through marginal weather to completely destroy a heavily fortified emplacement of enemy troops near Kumsong, Korea. This attack, in support of friendly forces requiring immediate assistance, took place within one hundred meters of friendly positions. Due to poor visibility and the closeness of the target to friendly positions, Lieutenant Coville made four separate passes on the target. After making his initial pass, Lieutenant Coville personally led each of the successive elements of his flight into position, despite the enemies ruse of firing target marking shells into friendly positions. Preceding each enemy aircraft to the target, Lieutenant Coville strafed the area in an effort to neutralize the intensive ground fire being received. These repeated runs were made with great risk and disregard for his own personal safety, and made it possible to effect the destruction of the enemy fortifications. Lieutenant Coville personally accounted for three bunkers destroyed, fifty yards of trench line neutralized and an undetermined number of enemy troops killed, enabling friendly forces to occupy the former enemy stronghold immediately without loss of personnel or equipment. Through his personal courage, determination and exemplary devotion to duty, Lieutenant Coville reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nCREIGHTON, RICHARD D.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major Richard Daniel Creighton (AFSN: AO-767134), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy as Commanding Officer, 336th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, FIFTH Air Force, on 16 October 1951. On that date, Major Creighton led a squadron of 16 F-86 planes on a combat aerial patrol in the Sinuiju-Yalu area in North Korea. Nearing minimum fuel, Major Creighton prepared to withdraw his forces from the area, when several formations of enemy MIG-15 jet aircraft were sighted on a southerly heading with obvious intent of attacking friendly fighter-bombers engaged in interdiction bombing below. At the same time another enemy formation was sighted on an interception course to engage Major Creighton's forces. Although faced with a critical fuel problem and outnumbered 100 to 16, Major Creighton unhesitatingly turned his formation to engage the enemy below, fully realizing that by doing so he would expose himself to the enemy formation above. During the ensuing battle, which covered an area from Sinuiju 100 miles south the Pyongyang, Major Creighton's brilliant tactics and repeated vicious assaults thoroughly disrupted the enemy. When fuel and ammunition reached an extremely critical point and the safety of the friendly fighter-bombers was insured, Major Creighton directed his forces to withdraw. Major Creighton's squadron on this occasion destroyed four enemy MIG-15s and damaged three more. The conspicuous gallantry and inspiring leadership displayed by Major Creighton reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: Los Angeles, California\n\nCURTO, DOMENICO A.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Domenico A. Curto, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy on 28 June 1951. Although hazardous weather conditions prevailed at his home base, Captain Curto directed his formation to a rendezvous over Korea and proceeded to the target area. The wingmen were inexperienced in low level attacks and were in the flight for the express purpose of observing correct procedure and technique for minimum altitude attacks on rail bridges and rail tunnels. After probable destruction of one double rail bridge, Captain Curto's aircraft was severely damaged. One aircraft of his flight was destroyed. Disregarding his own safety, Captain Curto continued the attack, destroying one railroad bridge, damaging one flak tower, damaging ten box cars, killing an undetermined number of enemy troops and probably destroying one other double rail bridge. Captain Curto's courage, superior airmanship, and determination to complete his assigned mission, was in keeping with the highest tradition of the military service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: Reading, Pennsylvania\n\nDALY, JOSEPH F.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Joseph F. Daly, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy on 9 August 1951 as a Tactical Reconnaissance Pilot. Captain Daly volunteered to fly deep into enemy held territory, unescorted and unarmed in an RF-80 type aircraft to acquire much needed photographs of a communications line and other targets which were located only a few miles from a large enemy air base. Captain Daly flew to his targets and started his first photographic run over the communications line; several runs were necessary to complete coverage of all the targets. Another RF-80 type aircraft circling nearer the enemy base warned Captain Daly that two enemy aircraft were taking off. With complete disregard for his own safety, Captain Daly elected to remain in the area and pursued his mission until the enemy jet aircraft made their attack. Captain Daly's aircraft was hit in the right wing by a 37-mm. shell, which completely destroyed one fuel tank. A 23-mm. shell hit the right side of the fuselage, and three fragments pierced the canopy. Violent evasive action followed, and through Captain Daly's skill in flying and his understanding of the enemy's capabilities, he was able to evade the enemy aircraft in the ensuing fight in which the enemy made at least five firing passes. He then flew his crippled aircraft twenty minutes under instrument conditions and returned to a friendly base two hundred and thirty miles away and with information needed on the enemy's activities. Captain Daly's gallantry, skill and devotion to duty reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nDAOUST, JOHN B.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain John B. Daoust, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action on 20 February 1951 as leader of a flight of F-80 aircraft in an attack on enemy positions near Chuchon-ni, Korea. Captain Daoust's flight was assigned the mission of attacking enemy positions in a narrow valley which was heavily defended by anti-aircraft fire. While he was circling over the target, he observed two Navy aircraft make an attack on his assigned target, during which one was shot down and the other so seriously damaged that it was forced to leave. Since the terrain made it necessary to make single ship attacks down the valley, Captain Daoust elected to attack with only two aircraft. On the second strafing run Captain Daoust's wingman was shot down. In spite of this he continued his attacks on the enemy positions with napalm, rockets and machine gun fire until his ammunition had been expended and succeeded in destroying five gun positions and inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy troops. The aggressiveness, devotion to duty and complete disregard for personal safety displayed by Captain Daoust were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\n*DARBY, WILBUR S. (KIA)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Captain Wilbur Smith Darby (AFSN: 12895A), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an armed enemy of the United Nations as a Forward Air Controller, 6147th Tactical Control Group, FIFTH Air Force, on 7 October 1952. At the start of a combat operation near Chorwon, Korea, Captain Darby established his Tactical Air Control Party in a forward bunker. During the entire period of the battle this area was subjected to heavy enemy bombardment. On 7 October 1952 the remote system which had been established from the radio jeeps to the bunker failed. At this time, voluntarily and with complete disregard for his personal safety, Captain Darby stationed himself in an exposed radio jeep, and for three days, with the battle at the height of its intensity, continued to direct close air support strikes from his exposed position. By his high personal courage in the face of enemy fire and his exemplary devotion to duty, Captain Darby was instrumental in the success of United Nations operations in that area, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: Maplewood, New Jersey\n\nDAVIS, GEORGE A.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Major George Andrew Davis, Jr. (AFSN: 671514/13035A), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy on 30 November 1951 while leading a formation of eight F-86 aircraft on a combat aerial patrol in the Sinuiju-Yalu River area in Korea. Shortly after arriving in the target area, Major Davis sighted a formation of approximately 12 enemy TU-2 type bomber aircraft escorted by large numbers of enemy MIG-15 and LA-9 type fighter aircraft. In spite of the overwhelming odds against him, Major Davis immediately maneuvered his Squadron into position to press home his attack. With outstanding airmanship, he led his formation on the initial pass on the bombers, scoring numerous strikes on the first box of three. While maneuvering for an immediate second attack on the bombers, his wingman became separated and was unable to rejoin him. Major Davis, disregarding his own safety, returned to the attack, although alone and without knowledge of friendly forces in the area. Despite the intense fire from the enemy bomber formation, he pressed home four more attacks with such effectiveness that he personally destroyed three enemy bombers. Major Davis was forced to withdraw after expending nearly all his ammunition and running critically low on fuel. While proceeding southward toward friendly territory, Major Davis heard a distress call from the element leader of his Flight. Although fully aware that he had less than the minimum amount of fuel remaining to insure safe return to a friendly base, Major Davis altered course 180 degrees and proceeded at full power to the location of the pilot. When he arrived he found his pilot's aircraft disabled by enemy fire and in imminent danger of being destroyed by MIG-15s, which were forming for a final attack on the damaged F-86. Major Davis immediately brought accurate fire on the enemy, destroyed one MIG-15, dispersed the remaining, forcing them to break off their attack. He escorted the disabled aircraft out of the danger zone, into friendly territory. When he finally landed, he had less than five gallons of fuel remaining. Through his skill, Major Davis saved the life of a fellow pilot and caused the destruction of four enemy aircraft, bringing his total score to six destroyed and two probably destroyed. Major Davis' outstanding airmanship and gallantry reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: Lubbock, Texas\n\nDAVIS, GEORGE A.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting a Second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Third Award of the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Major George Andrew Davis, Jr. (ASN: 0-671514/13035A), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy as Squadron Commander, 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, FIFTH Air Force, in the Sinanju-Anju area of North Korea on 13 December 1951. On that date, Major Davis was leader of a squadron of eight F-86 aircraft on a counter-air mission, when he observed a flight of ten MIG-15 enemy aircraft. He immediately initiated a coordinated attack and led his forces into the engagement. The vicious assault was relentlessly pressed and resulted in five MIG-15s destroyed and a sixth probably destroyed by the members of Major Davis' squadron. Major Davis was personally responsible for the destruction of two MIG-15 aircraft. None of his squadron sustained damage in achieving this victory over the enemy. The personal courage and outstanding qualities of leadership exhibited by major Davis contributed immeasurably to the greatest defeat inflicted upon the enemy in a single jet-to-jet engagement. As a result of his gallantry, leadership and brilliant tactical skill, Major Davis reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: Lubbock, Texas\n\nDAVIS, MURRIT H.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major Murrit H. Davis, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy as Squadron Commander, 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 18th Fighter-Bomber Group, FIFTH Air Force, on 14 August 1951. On that date, Major Davis led a flight of 12 F-51 type aircraft on a mission over Korea. Major Davis displayed outstanding airmanship and exceptional heroism by leading his Squadron over the heavily defended city of Pyongyang, capital of North Korea, where a devastating low level napalm attack was made against supply warehouses in that city. Two of his pilots were shot down by enemy fire and his own aircraft was heavily damaged. Despite the intensity of enemy opposition, Major Davis pulled away from his Squadron and circled the target area repeatedly attempting to locate the downed pilots. After an exhaustive search, he reassembled his squadron over the designated rendezvous point and led them toward home base. Approximately ten minutes after leaving the target area, his aircraft engine failed. Major Davis jettisoned his canopy. His aircraft was then seen to enter a spiral to the left, crash into the ground and explode. Major Davis' inspiring leadership, personal courage and devotion to duty, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nDAVIS, RALPH L.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private First Class Ralph L. Davis, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action while serving as an aero-medical specialist, Detachment 1, 3d Air Rescue Squadron, FIFTH Air Force, in action near Korang-pori, Korea, on 19 May 1951. Private Davis voluntarily made a flight fifty miles into enemy held territory to effect the rescue of a United Nations pilot who had been unable to return to friendly territory in his battle damaged aircraft. Upon approaching the locale of the pilot, the helicopter was subjected to a barrage of enemy automatic weapons and small arms fire and forced to circle the area while friendly aircraft strafed the enemy positions. When it appeared hostile fire had been neutralized, the helicopter pilot descended, only to meet again a fusillade of small arms fire which struck the helicopter. Private Davis, with utter disregard for his safety, returned fire from the helicopter until a landing had been made. Still under concentrated fire, he helped the injured pilot aboard as the aircraft escaped to safety. The gallantry, aggressiveness, and devotion to duty displayed by Private Davis reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nDUNN, CARLISLE L.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Staff Sergeant Carlisle L. Dunn, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations as a member of the 1st Shoran Beacon Squadron on the night of 19 December 1951. When his Radar site was attacked by armed guerrillas and subjected to intense small arms fire, Sergeant Dunn quickly deployed his men to defensive positions. Organizing a three man patrol, he led a charge to the enemy point of attack, using hand grenades and automatic weapons. After an intense fight, Sergeant Dunn and his patrol were successful in completely routing the enemy which outnumbered them ten to one, and inflicting heavy losses upon their number. During this action, Sergeant Dunn was wounded but refused medical aid until his site had been secured. Through his outstanding act of bravery, Sergeant Dunn is credited with saving a station vital to United Nations operations. Sergeant Dunn's cool appraisal of the situation and his selfless courage and leadership against an armed enemy reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\n*DOBBS, BYRON A. (POW)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Byron Alexis Dobbs, Jr., (AFSN: 0-888799), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an armed enemy of the United Nations as a Pilot, 8th Bombardment Squadron (LNI), 3d Bombardment Group (L), FIFTH Air Force, on the night of 18 February 1952. While performing armed reconnaissance along one of the enemy's main supply routes in North Korea, his crew sighted a large convoy of enemy vehicles. Captain Dobbs called at once for a flare ship to illuminate his target. During the ensuing bombing and strafing attack his aircraft was subjected to intense and accurate ground fire, but Captain Dobbs continued to press his attack under the flares. Receiving multiple hits throughout the aircraft as he pulled off the target, Captain Dobbs informed the flare ship that he was leaving the area. Fire broke out as he departed and he gave the order to bail out. With cool airmanship and utter disregard for personal safety, Captain Dobbs righted his stricken ship long enough for his crew to get clear. Captain Dobbs courage and selfless heroism in the face of enemy fire were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: St. Clio, Michigan\n\nEDENBO, JOHN W.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain John W. Edenbo, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against the enemy on 19 July 1950, in Korea, by pressing home a bombing attack on the west railroad bridge at Seoul, Korea. As the lone bomber aircraft was committed to the bomb run it was subjected to repeated and determined attacks by enemy fighters attempting to defend the target, an important link in the supply routes of the aggressor forces. On the third of these attacks, an enemy YAK-9 inflicted damage on the B-29 and wounded Captain Edenbo. Although bleeding profusely about the face, neck and hands, he refused a sedative for relief of his pain and directed the bombardier to continue the bomb run. Thirty seconds from the bomb release point, anti-aircraft fire was encountered. In spite of the strong defense by the enemy and without regard for his own wounds, Captain Edenbo persisted in the attack which resulted in direct hits on the bridge. The gallantry and courage of Captain Edenbo in the face of determined resistance and despite his painful wounds, reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\nENYART, JOHN W.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to John W. Enyart, First Lieutenant, U.S. Air Force, for gallantry in action against the enemy on 26 November 1950. While piloting an unarmed T-6 type aircraft on reconnaissance over enemy territory in the vicinity of Tokchon, Korea, Lieutenant Enyart received an emergency call for air evacuation of a United Nations Ground Controller and his party who were completely surrounded by a superior number of enemy troops. Though visibility was greatly restricted by haze and smoke, and identification was difficult, Lieutenant Enyart skillfully directed a number of fighter type aircraft to the spot. These planes succeeded in temporarily halting the enemy's advance. In response to a plea from the Ground Controller that an Air Evacuation Rescue Team be sent immediately to the area, Lieutenant Enyart, with complete disregard for his personal safety, landed his aircraft on a hazardous dirt strip located at the bottom of a steep valley. Exposed to heavy ground fire from the enemy, he successfully evacuated one member of the United Nations Forces, and immediately prepared to return for another. Despite almost zero visibility, and at great risk of his own life, Lieutenant Enyart approached the strip a second time but was prevented from landing by the enemy who had occupied it. The courage displayed by Lieutenant Enyart in the face of great danger was in keeping with the highest traditions of the service, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Air Forces, General Orders No. 105 (March 12, 1951)\n\nEPPERLEY, FRANKIE L.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private First Class Frankie L. Epperley, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action near Sinmak, Korea, on 30 April 1951. Private Epperley, aeronautical medical crew member with Detachment 1, 3d Air Rescue Squadron, FIFTH Air Force, accompanied a highly vulnerable helicopter in a flight over enemy held territory to assist in the rescue of a South African Air Force pilot who had bailed out of his aircraft. When the helicopter reached the area, Private Epperley noticed that the pilot was injured. As the helicopter hovered before landing, it met a burst of small arms fire. Private Epperley realized a trap had been set. Fully aware of the danger, he leaped from the aircraft the instant it touched the ground and ran to the pilot. Two enemy soldiers started toward the helicopter but were killed by the strafing fire of friendly fighter aircraft flying cover. Private Epperley assisted the wounded pilot into the aircraft and administered first aid during [the] return flight. Through his courage, skill and devotion to duty, Private Epperley sustained the tradition of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nEVANS, WILLIAM B.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant William B. Evans, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action on 1 October 1950 as a helicopter pilot. On this date Lieutenant Evans volunteered to rescue a carrier based pilot who had been shot down approximately ninety miles behind enemy lines in the area between Kyomip'o and P'yongyang, Korea. Although provided with escort of two fighter aircraft, Lieutenant Evans was subjected to intense fire from enemy machine gun positions. Disregarding the danger involved, he proceeded to the scene of the accident, landed, and assisted the pilot into the helicopter and returned with him to Kimpo Air Field. Through his skill and daring in flying an unarmed rescue aircraft far behind enemy lines, he saved the downed pilot from certain capture by the enemy. The outstanding courage and devotion to duty displayed by Lieutenant Evans were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nEZELL, JOSEPH H.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Joseph H. Ezell, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against the enemy in Korea, as a pilot of the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, in action on 6 July 1951. Although he was cognizant of the danger involved, Lieutenant Ezell voluntarily flew an extremely dangerous photo reconnaissance mission. His exceptional skill and professional knowledge during the planning stages of this mission were potent factors toward insuring its success. Despite the presence of a large number of enemy aircraft, Lieutenant Ezell courageously completed his vital mission of photographic reconnaissance. He frequently sighted enemy MIG aircraft but continued his task fully aware of the risk. The valuable information obtained as a result of his efforts was a significant contribution to the defense measures being prepared by the United Nations Forces. Lieutenant Ezell's exceptional flying skill and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nFEISTER, FRANK J.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Airman Second Class Frank J. Feister, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United Nations as Gunner of a B-26 attack bomber, 3d Bombardment Wing (L), Fifth Air Force, on the night of 17 November 1952. While on an armed reconnaissance over the enemy's main supply routes in North Korea, the crew sighted a convoy of enemy vehicles and immediately initiated an attack against it. After the last bomb was released, Airman Feister noticed that a fragmentation bomb was hung in the bomb bay. Completely disregarding his own personal safety, and despite the fact that he had been wounded by the intense and accurate enemy fire, Airman Feister swung out over the bomb bay and released the hung bomb. As a result of his quick and heroic action, the entire crew was saved from a very dangerous situation. By his gallantry, keen airmanship and devotion to duty, Airman Feister reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nFERNS, DONALD J.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Donald J. Ferns, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action as Pilot of a B-26 attack bomber during a daylight armed reconnaissance mission on 6 July 1950. On that date, Lieutenant Ferns attacked an enemy tank and Infantry concentration of approximately division strength in the vicinity of Pyongtack, Korea. On the approach to the heavily defended target, his aircraft was hit by intense anti-aircraft fire and the right engine was in flames. Although in position to break off the approach, Lieutenant Ferns elected to press the attack. He continued the attack until all his ammunition was expended and the target area was in complete disorder and ruin. Only then did he look to his own safety and that of his crew. With one engine feathered, he climbed to an altitude of 800 feet and bailed out his crew; at 600 feet, he parachuted to safety. All landed in enemy territory, but through Lieutenant Fern's leadership successfully evaded enemy forces and returned to United Nations lines. Lieutenant Fern's gallant performance and outstanding devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nFERRIS, DONALD J.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Donald J. Ferris, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy as Flight Leader on a mission over Korea on 17 June 1951. On that date, Captain Ferris attacked a vital rail-bridge north of Sariwon, Korea. In the face of intense anti-aircraft fire, Captain Ferris received two direct hits on his aircraft; one in the tail section and one in the cockpit. He was wounded in the arm and neck and his instruments were destroyed. Despite the injuries to himself and the damage to his aircraft, he continued the attack, making repeated strafing passes at the anti-aircraft gun positions in the area. He broke off his attacks only when forced to by shock, loss of blood, and smoke in the cockpit. Captain Ferris delegated command to his element leader and followed him to home base for a successful landing. As a result of this highly effective mission, important rail installations were destroyed and several gun emplacements knocked out. Captain Ferris' personal courage, flying skill and devotion to duty reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nFIELD, CHARLES H., JR.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Charles H. Field, Jr., United States Air Force, for gallantry in action on 30 April 1951 as pilot of a highly vulnerable helicopter on a mission to rescue a South African Air Force flyer who had bailed out near Sinmak, Korea. Arriving in the area Lieutenant Field located the pilot who was flashing a signal mirror near a hilltop. When he discovered the man was wounded he let down immediately to prevent his capture by encircling enemy troops. As the helicopter landed, enemy forces who had remained concealed from the fighter cover, opened up with intense small arms fire. Although his aircraft was hit in the engine section, Lieutenant Field remained at the radio and directed fighters to neutralize enemy positions and to strafe enemy soldiers rushing his aircraft as the wounded pilot was assisted aboard. The enemy continued firing at the helicopter as Lieutenant Field took off and until he was several miles from the pick-up point. Although the aircraft was trailing smoke from a severed oil line and engine failure was threatened, Lieutenant Field flew safely back to friendly territory. Lieutenant Field's gallantry in risking his life to save another was in keeping with the highest traditions of the service, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nFIERRO, VITO J.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Vito J. Fierro, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy on 27 October 1951 as a B-29 Aircraft Commander, 30th Bombardment Squadron, 19th Bombardment Group (Medium, FIFTH Air Force. On that date, Captain Fierro flew deputy lead in an element of eight aircraft in a daylight formation raid on the vital railway bridge at Sinanju, North Korea. The aircraft was severely damaged by anti-aircraft fire, resulting in the loss of rudder and all controls. Aggressive attacks by at least 20 enemy fighters rendered all turret systems inoperative, started a serious fire in one engine and severely wounded seven crew members. The extent of these injuries made a bail out attempt impractical. At this time, Captain Fierro flew his damaged aircraft away from the main formation to prevent a possible air collision, even though he fully realized this would make him more vulnerable to attack. His skillful maneuvering of the aircraft to stay under the formation as much as possible afforded his crew the best possible protection. Captain Fierro headed for Kimpo Air Field where medical aid would be available to the wounded. The landing was made without brakes or flaps and with the engine still burning. By his gallantry Captain Fierro, at the risk of his life, distinguished himself in action against the enemy. His composure and superior judgment in a situation of great danger reflect the highest credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nFISCHER, HAROLD E.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Harold Edward Fischer (AFSN: AO-2204126), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action as a Pilot, 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, FIFTHY Air Force, on 24 January 1953. On that date, Captain Fischer was flying number three position in a flight of four F-86 aircraft acting as escort for fighter-bombers on an attack against the Sinanju bridge complex. When enemy MiGs were encountered the flight attacked, during which Captain Fischer's aircraft was damaged by the misfire of one of his fifty caliber guns. Although the rudder cable was completely severed, the cabin pressurization lost, and the flaps unevenly extended, Captain Fischer aggressively pressed his attack on a MiG, flying through molten metal streaming from the burning MiG. Captain Fischer broke off his attack only after successfully destroying the enemy aircraft and disrupting a possible attack on the friendly fighter bombers. Through his high personal courage in attacking, despite the heavy damage to his aircraft, Captain Fischer demonstrated devotion to duty beyond the normal call, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nHome Town: Lone Rock, Iowa\n\nFISHER, FRANKLIN L.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major Franklin L. Fisher, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an enemy as Jet Fighter Pilot, 4th Fighter Interceptor Group, FIFTH Air Force, on 16 October 1951. Leading a formation of four F-86s in a Squadron of sixteen aircraft on combat aerial patrol in the Sinuiju-Yalu River area of North Korea, Major Fisher displayed exceptional valor when his flight was engaged in aerial combat against overwhelming numbers of enemy MIG-15 jet fighters. With outstanding leadership and skill, Major Fisher repeatedly led his formation in vicious attacks against the enemy. Sighting a formation of eight enemy MIG-15s maneuvering to assault a friendly formation of fighter-bombers, Major Fisher deployed his flight and attacked. With coolness and skill he brought his guns to bear on one of the enemy and destroyed him, while the remainder of the enemy flight dispersed and withdrew from the area. Low on fuel and with only three guns remaining in operation, Major Fisher was attacked by another formation of enemy aircraft. With extraordinary airmanship he outmaneuvered the enemy and brought his guns to bear on a second enemy MIG-15, scoring heavy strikes on the fuselage and wings. Shortly thereafter, the enemy pilot ejected himself as his aircraft burst in flame. The tenacity displayed by major Fisher in personally destroying two enemy MIG-15s, and his courage against overwhelming odds, reflect great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nFLANAGAN, JOHN C.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Sergeant John C. Flanagan, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action on 17 February 1951 near Seoul, Korea while flying as a medical technician crew member in an unarmed and highly vulnerable H-5 helicopter. Fully aware of the great personal risk involved, Sergeant Flanagan displayed a high degree of valor in attempting to effect the rescue of a downed United Nations pilot from an area behind enemy lines. When the helicopter touched the ground in the area where the downed airman lay tangled in his parachute, the enemy deployed in the immediate vicinity opened fire with small arms and automatic weapons. Sergeant Flanagan demonstrated outstanding courage by leaving the aircraft and making his way to the side of the inert pilot. He determined that the airman was dead and searched the body for identification while subject to intense enemy fire. Sergeant Flanagan's gallantry and devotion to duty in the face of aggressive enemy action were in keeping with the highest traditions of the service, and reflected great credit upon himself, the United States Air Force, and the United States Army.\n\nFORMAN, ROBERT D.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Robert D. Forman, Colonel, U.S. Air Force, for gallantry in action against the enemy at Hagaru-ri, Korea, on 6 December 1950. When the fate of a small airstrip was uncertain, Colonel Forman, disregarding his personal safety, flew a C-47 to the strip and landed in the midst of a fierce fight between American troops and the numerically superior enemy. With only a few hours of daylight left, Colonel Forman personally directed the aerial evacuation which successfully removed all battle casualties from the strip. When it became clear that the field was no longer tenable, Colonel Forman dispatched all other C-47s and prepared to leave in his own. At this moment, with darkness fast approaching, Colonel Forman received a message from a radio jeep that there was one more critically wounded United States Marine in desperate need of aerial evacuation. Colonel Forman waited an hour, while the enemy closed in on the field. The battle casualty was finally placed aboard his plane and he made an after dark take-off in the face of strong enemy fire. The leadership, courage, and outstanding heroism displayed by Colonel Forman on this occasion reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.\n\nFORNES, WILLIAM L.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant William L. Fornes, United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an armed enemy of the United Nations as Pilot of an F-84 aircraft, 69th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 58th Fighter Bomber Wing, Fifth Air Force, on 6 August 1952. On that date, Lieutenant Fornes flew as number two wingman in a flight of four F-84 aircraft briefed to bomb a railroad bridge and make rail cuts in the area near the town of Sap-yong, North Korea. After completing the attack in which Lieutenant Fornes damaged one span of bridge and made one rail cut, the flight was returning to base when they were attacked by enemy MIG-15 type aircraft. Under attack they were unable to maintain flight integrity and were scattered; however, Lieutenant Fornes completed a vicious attack on one of the MIG despite the formidable opposition, scoring hits which set the MIG aflame. Through his keen flying ability, high personal courage in the face of the enemy and exemplary devotion to duty, Lieutenant Fornes reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\n\nFOSTER, JOHN G.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Colonel John G. Foster (AFSN: AO-439706), United States Air Force, for gallantry in action against an armed enemy as a Pilot, 67th Tactical Recon"
