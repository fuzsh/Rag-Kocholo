        "text": "Chronology of Historical Highlights of Eighth Air Force\n\nPost-World War II\n\nWith the official end of World War II in Europe on 8 May 1945, Eighth Air Force participated in Operation Revival, a humanitarian operations where Eighth’s bombers modified to carry passengers evacuated 7,717 American and 1,427 RAF officers from Stalag Luft I German Air Force Prisoner of War camp in Northern Germany.\n\nIn a flag move, Headquarters Eighth Air Force transferred from England to Camp Pinetree on Okinawa in the Pacific Theater of Operations and was there when the war against Imperial Japan ended.\n\nIn a flag move, Headquarters Eighth Air Force stationed on Okinawa, was transferred to MacDill Field, Florida and assigned as the second Numbered Air Force to the Strategic Air Command.\n\nEighth Air Force moved to Fort Worth Army Airfield, Texas (later renamed to Carswell AFB) and was assigned subordinate units by Strategic Air Command.\n\nMembers of Headquarters Eighth Air Force attended a conference at the Consolidate Aircraft Corporation plant adjacent to the Fort Worth Army Air Field to coordinate the preliminary training plans on the B-36 Peacekeeper bomber aircraft.\n\nAir Marshal Sir Hugh William Saunders, Royal Air Force along with a group of key personnel visited Headquarters Eighth Air Force at Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas and took a tour of the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation plant adjacent to the air field.\n\nEighth Air Force was transferred from the United States Army Air Forces to the United States Air Force.\n\nThe Chief of Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces and his immediate staff along with representatives of the Turkish Navy, Army, and Air Force – visited Headquarters Eighth Air Force.\n\nA visit to Headquarters Eighth Air Force was conducted by senior officials from the Royal Canadian Air Force including Air Marshall William A. Curtiss, Chief Royal Canadian Air Force; Air Commodore Kerr (Plans and Operations); Air Commodore Miller (Maintenance Command); Air Commodore Plant (Personnel); Air Commodore Wray (Air Transport); and Flight Lieutenant Gowan, Aide-de-Camp.\n\nGeneral George C. Kenney, Commanding General of Strategic Air Command visited Headquarters, Eighth Air Force.\n\nThe first F-82 Twin Mustang fighter aircraft was delivered to the 27th Fighter Escort Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force.\n\n20 to 27 June – The Strategic Air Command conducted its first-ever Bombing Competition that was held at Castle AFB, California. Eighth Air Force swept the first five places in the competition for the B-29 and B-50 bomber categories.\n\n26 June 1948 to 30 September 1949 – Berlin Airlift commenced due to the Soviet closure of land access to the occupied and divided city of Berlin, Germany thus cutting off rail and road access between West Germany to West Berlin that was located deep into the Soviet-controlled zone of East Germany. Western response by the United States, Great Britian, and France was the initiation of a massive airlift of supplies and provisions to the civilian population as well as Western Allied occupation forces in West Berlin. The American airlift effort was called Operation Vittles with the British effort called Operation Plane Fare.\n\nDuring the airlift the United States Air Force decided to deploy the YC-97A, an experimental version of a B-29 bomber converted to a cargo aircraft and assigned to the Eighth’s 1st Strategic Support Squadron at Biggs AFB, Texas. Eighth Air Force was field testing the YC-97A (s/n 45-59590) and deployed this individual aircraft with its Eighth’s air and ground crews along with a host of test technicians.\n\nThe YC-97A flew it first airlift mission on 1 May 1949 and conducted a total of 60 air missions carrying humanitarian supplies from West Germany to West Berlin which continued until 30 September, months after the Soviets had lifted their blockade on 12 May 1949. Eventually the United States Air Force accepted this new cargo aircraft as the C-97 Stratofreighter.\n\nAs well during Operation Vittles, as a show-of-force and messaging, the Air Force rotated B-29 bomber units to England. Bomber units assigned to Eighth Air Force participated in these rotational deployments; specifically: 28th Bomb Group to RAF Scampton (July to October 1948), 2nd Bomb Group to RAF Lakenheath (starting August 1948) and 509th Bomb Group to RAF Lakenheath (starting April 1949).\n\nEighth Air Force assigned 7th Bomb Group received the Air Force’s first operational B-36A Peacemaker heavy bomber.\n\nThe first unit of the Air Refueling Squadrons, Medium concept were activated by the United States Air Force and assigned respectively to the 43d Bomb Wing and 509th Bomb Wing; both belonging to Eighth Air Force.\n\nEighth Air Force dispatched several B-29 Superfortress bombers aircraft on an air mission to circumnavigate the global to demonstrate American long-range airpower. Two bombers completed the mission by flying 20,000 miles, while logging 103 hours and 50 minutes of flight time including eight stops for a total trip of 14 days.\n\nAn Eighth Air Force B-36 Peacemaker bomber conducted a 9,400-mile non-stop flight from Texas to Hawaii and return without refueling.\n\n26 February to 2 March – The aircrew of Lucky Lady II, (s/n 45-010) a B-50 Superfortress bomber assigned to 43d Bomb Group, Eighth Air Force completed the first nonstop flight around the world by an airplane. The aircrew flew more than 23,452 miles in 94 hours and one minute, taking off and landing at Carswell Air Force Base, Texas; with refueling in the air over the Azores, Arabia, the Philippines, and Hawaii. For this flight, the Lucky Lady II aircrew won the Mackay Trophy; the first ever to be awarded to Strategic Air Command.\n\nA single B-36 Peacekeeper bomber from Eighth Air Force assigned 7th Bomb Group flew 9,600 miles unrefueled within the United States in 43 hours.\n\nEighth Air Force began integration of African American airmen into all its assigned organizations.\n\nHeadquarters Eighth Air Force hosted a B-36 bomber conference with representatives from the Air Staff, Air Training Command, and Air Material Command to resolve engineering defects, maintenance, personnel, training, and manning challenges.\n\nHeadquarters Eighth Air Force implemented Strategic Air Command Regulation 66-12 that established a specialized aircraft maintenance organization replacing the Crew Chief system of maintenance as well as standardized maintenance procedures throughout the Command.\n\nEighth Air Force’s mission was change by Strategic Air Command to one of manning, training, and equipping assigned combat and service units for the primary purpose of conducting strategic air warfare with both atomic and conventional weapons.\n\nStrategic Air Command changed the mission of its three assigned Numbered Air Forces with Eighth Air Force gaining responsibility for all heavy bomb operations.\n\nThe first KB-29P aerial tanker is delivered to the Eighth Air Force.\n\n15 to 18 September – During the first phase of Operation Fox Able Three, Eighth Air Force assigned 27th Fighter Escort Wing ferried 89 F-84E Thunderjet fighter aircraft from Bergstrom AFB, Texas to Air Force units at Furstenfeldbruck, Germany. Refueling stops were made at McGuire AFB, New Jersey; Goose AB, Labrador; Bluie West One (Nassasurak AB) Greenland; Keflavik, Iceland; and RAF Manston in England.\n\n15 to 28 October – 27th Fighter-Escort Wing executed the second phase of Fox Able Three by ferrying 91 jet fighters from Bergstrom AFB, Texas to Germany.\n\nFor achieving the first mass deployment of jet-powered fighters over the Atlantic Ocean, the 27th Fighter Escort Wing was presented the Mackay Trophy by General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, USAF Chief of Staff.\n\n8 November 1950 to 30 June 1951 – Eighth Air Force’s only assigned unit to be deployed for the Korean War was the 27th Fighter-Escort Wing. The wing commenced deployment of 75 F-84E Thunderjet fighter aircraft to the Far East for air combat duty in the Korean War from Bergstrom AFB, Texas to San Diego Naval Air Station and after being loaded aboard two aircraft carriers; departed on 13 and 14 September docking in Japan on 30 November 1950. The 27th Fighter-Escort Wing was placed under the operational control of Far East Air Forces and saw air combat over the Korean Peninsula – to include air-to-air combat with Chinese MiG-15 fighter aircraft. This fighter wing became highly decorated with four Distinguished Flying Crosses and 23 Air Medals.\n\nSix B-36s of the Eighth’s 7th Bomb Wing few a training mission from Carswell AFB, Texas to RAF Lakenheath, England, returning on 21 January 1951.\n\nProvisional training squadrons were organized and assigned to each Eighth Air Force base to provide centralized control of administration for all individual training except for air crew training.\n\nThree B-36D Peacekeepers heavy bombers from 7th Bomb Wing participated in the Paris Air Show.\n\nThe first B-36s Peacekeeper bombers landed at Sidi Slimane Air Base, in French Morocco. Six heavy bombers from the Eighth’s 11th Bomb Wing arrived at after covering 4,984 miles, 21 hours, nonstop from Carswell AFB, Texas. The B-36s departed for home station of Carswell AFB, Texas on 5 December landing on 6 December after a 27 hour flight.\n\nEighth Air Force’s 509th Bomb Wing participated in the Royal Air Force Strike Command’s Bombing and Navigation Competition and the Wing’s B-50D Superfortress bomber took second place in the competition.\n\nEight B-50D Superfortress bomber aircraft assigned to the 509th Bomb Wing of Eighth Air Force flew over the city of Brussels, Belgium in the first airpower demonstration for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) officials.\n\nA severe weather storm struck Carswell AFB, Texas where it damaged 72 B-36 Peacekeeper bomber aircraft assigned to Eighth Air Force’s 7th and 11th Bomb Wings.\n\n13-18 October – Strategic Air Command conducted the Fourth Annual Bombing and Navigation Completion which involved 19 wings and participation by the Royal Air Force. Award of the Fairchild Trophy (for best bomber unit in combined fields of bombing and navigation) was a tie between Eighth Air Force’s 97th Bomb Wing and Fifteenth Air Force’s 93rd Bomb Wing. General Thomas S. Powers as the Vice Commander-in-Chief of Strategic Air Command flipped a coin to determine which unit would possess the trophy for the first six months – the 93rd Bomb Wing won the flip.\n\n24 October to 1 November – Strategic Air Command conducted its first Reconnaissance, Photo, and Navigation Competition resulting in Eighth Air Force’s sole participant, the 28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing being the first winner of the P. T. Cullen Trophy.\n\n6 October 1952 to 13 February 1953 – The 27th Fighter Escort Wing deployed again to the Korean War. This unique deployment from Bergstrom AFB, Texas included a 7,800 mile air trip composed of island-hopping. From Texas the F-84G Thunderjet fighter aircraft landed in Hawaii, Midway Island, and Misawa Air Base in Japan. The 2,572 mile route from Midway Island to Japan became the longest over-the-water, air-to-air refueling of jet fighters in aviation history up that time.\n\nTen B-36 Peacemaker bombers aircraft assigned to the 6th Bomb Wing, Heavy of Eighth Air Force conducted operations out of Thule AFB, Greenland.\n\nThe Eighth Air Force’s first KC-97 Stratotanker was delivered to the 96th Air Refueling Squadron at Altus AFB, Oklahoma; with this aerial tanker vital to world-wide strategic operations of the Eighth’s assigned B-47 Stratojet.\n\nThe Eighth Air Force Noncommissioned Academy began its first class at Bergstrom AFB, Texas.\n\nHeadquarters 1st Air Division was organized at Westover AFB, Massachusetts and served as a holding unit for the planned move of Eighth Air Force headquarters to the base.\n\nWestover AFB, Massachusetts was transferred from the Military Air Transport Service to the Strategic Air Command and assigned to Eighth Air Force. During this major reorganization several units and installations were transferred between several Numbered Air Forces applying also to Eighth Air Force.\n\nHeadquarters Eighth Air Force began its operations at Westover AFB, Massachusetts.\n\nMajor General Walter C. Sweeney, Jr. assumed command of Eighth Air Force becoming the longest serving Commander in Eighth’s history relinquishing command on 1 October 1961.\n\nThe 42d Bomb Wing, Heavy, at Loring AFB, Maine received the first B-52 Stratofortress assigned to Eighth Air Force.\n\nEighth Air Force received a new mission set from Strategic Air Command.\n\nSpecifically, the Eighth was to: (1) train, and equip itself to conduct strategic air warfare on a world-wide basis, using either nuclear or conventional weapons, (2) perform tasks assigned in the current Emergency War Plan and in related operations orders, (3) train and administer assigned reserve personnel and units, (4) participate in disaster relief and other domestic emergencies, and (5) perform such special missions as directed by the Commander-in-Chief Strategic Air Command.\n\nHeadquarters Northeast Air Command was discontinued thus resulting in Eighth Air Force gaining airbases and USAF units under its jurisdiction including multiple air bases in Newfoundland (Canada) and Greenland.\n\nStrategic Air Command commenced bomber ground alert status: Eighth Air Force would conduct ground and airborne alert operations from 1957 to April 1970 and then again resume alert operations on 1 January 1975 until 27 September 1991 when alert termination was ordered by President George H.W. Bush.\n\n11 to 17 November – Operation Long Legs was begun by General Curtis E. LeMay, Vice Chief of Staff, United States Air Force flying a new KC-135 Stratotanker named City of Moses Lake (s/n 55-3126) on two aviation record making flights. Accomplished in three phases, Operation Long Legs constituted the American cooperation with Argentina Air Force in celebration of that nation’s twelfth annual Aeronautics Week. The KC-135 flown by General LeMay belonged to the 4050th Air Refueling Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force.\n\nThe first phase conducted on 11 November resulted in an aviation record of a non-stop, non-refueled flight of 6,332.85 miles from Westover AFB, Massachusetts to Buenos Aires, Argentina accomplished in 13 hours, 2 minutes. Approximately 1,000 miles were added to the distance by flying “around-the-hump” of Brazil.\n\nThe second phase was an aviation speed record established with a 5,204 miles flight from Buenos Aires to Washington, D.C. in 11 hours, 5 minutes with an average speed of 471.5 mph conducted on 13 November.\n\nThe third phase of Operation Long Legs conducted 16-17 November had six B-52 Stratofortress bombers from the Eighth Air Force assigned 42nd Bomb Wing conduct a non-stop, round-trip flyover of the Buenos Aires air show with a return Plattsburgh AFB, New York.\n\nLincoln AFB, Nebraska became the first Eighth Air Force assigned base to be reorganized to support alert operations. Subsequently other bases belonging to the Eighth began their reorganization actions to support alert duty and operations.\n\n24 to 25 November – Eighth Air Force’s participation in Strategic Air Command’s Operation Quick Kick included four B-52 Stratofortress bombers from 42d Bomb Wing and was part of Strategic Air Command’s effort to showcase its newest bomber, the B-52. In all, eight B-52s (including the four from the Eighth) few a two-day, non-stop flight around the perimeter of North America (the United States and Canada) with all eight bomber aircrews setting a new endurance aviation record by staying aloft more than 24 hours.\n\nStrategic Air Command began its reorganization of its Numbered Air Forces. Specifically, Eighth Air Force lost some airbases in the middle of the country while gaining others essentially resulting in assigned units and bases contained within the eastern part of the Continental United States.\n\nEighth Air Force entered the missile era with assignment of the 702d Strategic Missile Wing (Snark). The MX-62 Snark was a short-lived, ground launched, turbojet-powered intercontinental cruise-type nuclear missile that achieved alert status in March 1960 and the only SNARK units activated by the Air Force. (Overtime, Eighth Air Force would have assigned missile wings equipped with intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) including Atlas-F, Titan I & II, and Minuteman I & II.)\n\nThe first Snark SM-62 surface-to-surface intercontinental nuclear-armed cruise missile attained alert status with Eighth Air Force assigned 702d Strategic Missile Wing (Snark) stationed at Presque Island, Maine.\n\nThe experimental test program of having bomb wings with 70 assigned aircraft was terminated by the Strategic Air Command. The test units of 2d and 380th Bomb Wing would retain their 70 aircraft inventory, but other B-47 Stratojet equipped units would not convert. Strategic Air Command concluded the 70 aircraft organizational concept was too large for effective management. (On 25 June 1961, both bomb wings would reorganize and reduce to 45 aircraft.)\n\nThe Eighth Air Force assigned 306th Bomb Wing replaced the 19th Bomb Wing assigned to 2nd Air Force in supporting Reflex Action rotation operations at Ben Guerir AB, Morocco. Strategic Air Command forward deployed nuclear-armed B-47 Stratojets as part of its alert force. Three airbases in Morocco would be utilized for forward deployed alert rotations.\n\nMissile Site Number 5 and Number 6 respectively at Lewis and Ausable Forks in New York, were designated and assigned to Eighth Air Force and Plattsburgh AFB, New York. (During this time several Missile Sites were assigned to Eighth Air Force.)\n\nEighth Air Force assigned 19th Bomb Wing converted from B-47 Stratojet bomber aircraft to B-52 Stratofortress bombers.\n\n16 to 22 September – During the Strategic Air Command’s Combat Competition held at Fairchild AFB, Washington; Eighth Air Force won the most top honors including best B-47 and B-52 wing honors as well as awards for aerial refueling units and aircrews.\n\nStrategic Air Command discontinued the fourth bomb squadron in each medium bomb wing with the associated manpower savings providing centralized control of wing operations causing Eighth Air Force to lose a bomb squadron at six of its assigned airbases.\n\nThe first Atlas International Ballistic Missile arrived at Plattsburgh AFB, New York, an Eighth Air Force base.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis began in response to increasing tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union over discovery of Soviet nuclear ballistic missiles and jet bombers assets in Cuba. Historical context:\n\n 20 October – Eighth Air Force actions taken in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis included: (1) moving all Eighth bombers from Homestead and MacDill AFBs in Florida, (2) implement limited airborne alert operations, (3) assigned B-47 bombers began dispersal operations, (4) increased force status to Defense Condition 3, and (5) placed the 12 Atlas missile sites at Plattsburgh AFB and personnel of the Site Activation Task Force directly under Strategic Air Command control to bring the sites to alert posture quickly.\n\n 25 October – The United States implemented a naval “quarantine” blockade and air surveillance of Cuba at 1000 hours.\n\n 2 November – President John F. Kennedy spoke to the nation to report that aerial photos had confirmed Soviet missile bases were being dismantled, their missiles and related equipment were being crated, and that the fixed installations at these sites were being destroyed. However, the United States continued its air surveillance and the naval quarantine.\n\n7 November –the United States announced that missile removal would be verified by check at sea.\n\n8 November – Pentagon photographs revealed that all known missile sites were dismantled.\n\n7 December – Department of Defense announced Soviet jet bombers, apparently all the attack aircraft sent to Cuba, were loaded aboard three Soviet ships.\n\nWhiteman AFB at Knob Noster, Missouri transferred from Second Air Force to Eighth Air Force along with all assigned units simultaneously Francis E. Warren AFB at Cheyenne, Wyoming transferred from Fifteenth Air Force to the Eighth along with its assigned units.\n\nLieutenant General Joseph J. Nazzaro, the Eighth Air Force Commander (#22) since 1 October 1962 was appointed as the Vice Commander of Strategic Air Command and was replaced by Lieutenant General Horace M. Wade.\n\nStrategic Air Command began to deploy B-52 Stratofortress bomber units to Kadena AB, Okinawa as a contingency force if needed in the Vietnam War. Deployments were under the name of ARC LIGHT.\n\n18 June – The inaugural ARC LIGHT conventional air combat sortie was conducted by B-52s in the Vietnam War striking enemy targets in South Vietnam. By December 1965, B-52s would have flown 100 air combat missions in the war.\n\nBomber aircraft and their aircrews from four bomber units (none from Eighth Air Force) home stationed in the United States rotated to conduct the air war in Southeast Asia from Andersen AFB, Guam. These rotations from these four bomber units phased out by March 1966.\n\nIn early 1966, six bomber wings became cadre units on Andersen AFB, Guam and were augmented with personnel and aircrews from other wings within Strategic Air Command. Of the six cadre wings, two were assigned to Eighth Air Force. The 306th Bomb Wing from McCoy AFB, Florida was the first cadre wing from Eighth Air Force to conduct a deployment starting on 6 September 1966. After this date into 1970 several bomb wings of the Eighth deployed as cadre units with some doing repeat deployments.\n\nStrategic Air Command conducted its first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile completion with Eighth Air Force sweeping all categories for the Minuteman missile system.\n\nIn a flag move from Westover AFB, Massachusetts to Andersen AFB, Guam; Headquarters Eighth Air Force attained a new mission to plan, command & control, and implement conventional bomber operations throughout Southeast Asia, while remaining assigned to the Strategic Air Command.\n\n18-29 December – Headquarters Eighth Air Force based at Andersen AFB, Guam; in coordination with Strategic Air Command, planned and conducted 729 nighttime bomber sorties as part of Operation Linebacker II; an 11 day decisive air campaign against Hanoi-Haiphong heartland of North Vietnam resulting in influencing North Vietnam to return to the Paris Peace Talks and sign a previously negotiated cease-fire agreement. For the 11 days, USAF and USN tactical aircraft conducted daytime attacks with nighttime strikes conducted by B-52s and supporting aircraft. Some 1,200 surface-to-air missiles were fired during Linebacker II dowing 15 B-52s and 10 tactical aircraft.\n\nThe Robert J. Collier Trophy, a most prestigious recognition for achievement in aviation, was presented to Eighth Air Force for planning and implementing Operation Linebacker II over the heavily defended heartland of North Vietnam during the 11-day strategic air campaign from 18-29 December 1972. Co-winners included Seventh Air Force and Navy Task Force 77.\n\nBomber-centric air combat ends in war in Southeast Asia with the last B-52 bomber strike flown on this date. From April 1970 to this August date, Eighth Air Force had planned and then commanded and controlled B-52 operations in the air war during the Vietnam War.\n\nSummary of Bomber Statistics in Vietnam War: For 98 months of air combat conducted by B-52s in Southeast Asia; bombers flew 126,615 actual sorties, credited with dropping 6,162,000 tons of munitions with most strikes conducted in South Vietnam (55 percent), Laos (27 percent), Cambodia (12 percent), and in North Vietnam (6 percent); loss of 31 B-52s (18 to hostile fire, remainder to operational accidents.)\n\nIn a flag move, Headquarters Eighth Air Force moved from Andersen AFB, Guam to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana reassuming nuclear deterrence and alert operations under Strategic Air Command.\n\n23 to 25 October – The Twenty-Second Annual Bombing and Navigation Competition was conducted by Strategic Air Command, the first time where overseas-based Air Force units could compete. Some 43 units within the United States as well a B-52 unit stationed on Guam and an aerial tanker unit based at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa competed. Eighth Air Force’s 380th Bomb Wing (FB-111 Aardvark) took the Fairchild Trophy for a fourth time in a row. With this specific competition, Barksdale AFB in Louisiana became the official headquarters and center for the Competition’s symposium and award ceremonies.\n\nB-52 Stratofortress bombers from 2d Bomb Wing the first to be modified to carry and launch the AGM-86 Conventional Air Launch Cruise Missile (CALCM) arrived at Edwards AFB, California for testing. Eighth Air Force and its assigned 2d Bomb Wing became the test bed for the CACLM, a stand-off precision strike munition.\n\nThe Mackay Trophy was awarded in recognizing a non-stop round-the-world aviation record – nicknamed “Busy Visit” – by two B-52s Stratofortress bombers covering 21,256 statute miles in 43 hours, 55 minutes averaging 488 miles per hour. This almost entire over-the-water route was conducted to validate several Strategic Air Command contingency plans and to figure out the “how to” of conducting sea surveillance of ocean-going vessels. Bombers and aircrews were from the 410th Bomb Wing of Eighth Air Force.\n\nThe first KC-10 Extender aerial tanker was accepted and flown from the Douglas Aircraft Company in California to Barksdale AFB by Lieutenant General Edgar S. Harris, Jr. then Commander (#35) Eighth Air Force. The field testing and evaluation of the newest aerial refueler was done under the auspices the 4200th Test and Evaluation Squadron as well as both Eighth Air Force and 2d Bomb Wing.\n\nThe former Commander of Eighth Air Force, General (retired) Ira C. Eaker, donated the Castle Croom Punch Bowl Set with this sterling silver set – the engraved punch bowl and ladle along with his personal cup – becoming the heraldic device for Eighth Air Force. The entire set was created by the Black, Starr & Gorham Company in 1944 and was the centerpiece for post-war reunion events. Subsequently five other cups were donated with each like General Eaker’s cup having the Eighth’s emblem and the person’s name engraved on the cup. The bowl, ladle and six of the original nine cups are displayed within a protective cabinet inside the headquarters’ Command Section adjacent to the entryway into the Commander’s Office.\n\n15 to 18 March – Eighth Air Force B-52 Stratofortress bomber crews in collaboration with the United States Navy, gain proficiency with the Harpoon anti-ship missile in developing air-sea interdiction capabilities.\n\nEighth Air Force began to transfer space-centric units – including early warning, space surveillance, and satellite tracking – were transferred to the newly activated Air Force Space Command. The transferring had been completed by 1 May 1983. These space-centric units had previously been transferred to the Eighth in early 1980 as the Aerospace Defense Command was inactivated in April 1980.\n\n15-18 May – Two B-52 Stratofortress bombers from 2d Bomb Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force participated in a Strategic Air Command test to develop a bomber-centric air-sea interdiction capability. These bomber aircrews in an exercise at the Pacific Missile Test Range on Kwajalein Atoll successfully launched three AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles.\n\nLast B-52D model bomber (s/n 55-0674) was retired by the United States Air Force from its assignment to Eighth Air Force’s 7th Bomb Wing.\n\nThe 42d Bomb Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force reached Initial Operational Capability with the United States Navy’s AGM-94 Harpoon anti-ship missile.\n\nStrategic Air Command conducted its Twenty-Eighth Annual Bombing and Navigation Competition with first contestants participating from the United States Air Forces Europe. The Competition Headquarters at Barksdale AFB was renamed as “Hoban Hall” in honor of former Eighth Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Richard M. Hoban who had done much to establish a permanent home for “Bomb Comp” at Barksdale AFB. The Royal Air Force participated with its newest fighter-bomber aircraft the Tornado. The Fairchild Trophy was won by Eighth Air Force’s 380th Bomb Wing, the only unit in Strategic Air Command to be the recipient of this top trophy five times.\n\nThe Air Force’s newest aerial refueling aircraft – the KC-10 Extender – reached Full Operational Capability while assigned to Eighth Air Force assigned 2d Bomb Wing. The testing and evaluation of the KC-10 at Barksdale AFB had commenced in March 1981.\n\nColonel Philip J. Ford, the 384th Bomb Wing Commander (and future Eighth Air Force Commander) and Lieutenant General E. G. “Buck” Shuler, Jr., the Eighth Air Force Commander (#40) flew the last B-1B from the Rockwell International plant to McConnell AFB, Kansas.\n\n7 to 11 February – Strategic Air Command conducted its last Unit Effectiveness Inspection of Eighth Air Force resulting in 15 outstanding and 22 excellent marks.\n\nThe United States Air Force filed its Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Peacekeeper Rail Garrison system with the study listing 10 candidate bases, including five Eighth Air Force assigned installations for the system’s eventual deployment.\n\n27 April to 4 May – Strategic Air Command conducted the annual missile competition at Vandenberg AFB, California where Eighth Air Force assigned 351st Strategic Missile Wing a Minuteman II unit stationed at Whiteman AFB, Missouri won the Blanchard Trophy for the best missile wing in Strategic Air Command.\n\nCMSgt Joseph D. Cook, Eighth’s Senior Enlisted Advisor (#6) since 12 August 1986, left to become the Senior Leader Advisor to the Commander-in-Chief of Strategic Air Command.\n\n5 to 17 September – Eighth Air Force initiated Exercise Mighty Warrior 89 and during the exercise generated nearly 1,150 sorties from 10 forward operating locations in a realistic wartime environment. During the exercise, Eighth Air Force surged multiple B-52s, B-1Bs and FB-111s sorties to drop live and inert weapons on the Nellis Range, Nevada.\n\nThe aircrew of a B-1B bomber aircraft from Eighth Air Force assigned 96th Bombardment Wing at Dyess AFB, Texas skillfully landed their aircraft on a dry lakebed in the first-ever gear up emergency landing due to a retracted nose landing gear. No aircrew member was harmed, and the bomber suffered minimal damage. For this feat, the aircrew earned the Mackay Trophy for 1989.\n\nThe United States initiated military operations against Panama to protect American lives, restore democracy, and apprehend General Manuel Noriega. Eighth Air Force served as the lead Numbered Air Force for aerial tankers and assembled a tanker task force with over 90 aerial refuelers. The tankers subsequently completed 80 missions to offload 4.75 million pounds of fuel to 124 receivers in the first 22 hours of the operation.\n\n5 to 19 January – For Exercise Mighty Force 90-1, the 2d Bomb Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force deployed seven B-52s and three KC-10s aerial refuelers to Roswell Industrial Air Center for training in supporting Red Flag exercises at Nellis AFB, Nevada.\n\nWith the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the United States with allied nations built a coalition force under Operation Desert Shield.

Eighth Air Force was field testing the YC-97A (s/n 45-59590) and deployed this individual aircraft with its Eighth’s air and ground crews along with a host of test technicians.\n\nThe YC-97A flew it first airlift mission on 1 May 1949 and conducted a total of 60 air missions carrying humanitarian supplies from West Germany to West Berlin which continued until 30 September, months after the Soviets had lifted their blockade on 12 May 1949. Eventually the United States Air Force accepted this new cargo aircraft as the C-97 Stratofreighter.\n\nAs well during Operation Vittles, as a show-of-force and messaging, the Air Force rotated B-29 bomber units to England. Bomber units assigned to Eighth Air Force participated in these rotational deployments; specifically: 28th Bomb Group to RAF Scampton (July to October 1948), 2nd Bomb Group to RAF Lakenheath (starting August 1948) and 509th Bomb Group to RAF Lakenheath (starting April 1949).\n\nEighth Air Force assigned 7th Bomb Group received the Air Force’s first operational B-36A Peacemaker heavy bomber.\n\nThe first unit of the Air Refueling Squadrons, Medium concept were activated by the United States Air Force and assigned respectively to the 43d Bomb Wing and 509th Bomb Wing; both belonging to Eighth Air Force.\n\nEighth Air Force dispatched several B-29 Superfortress bombers aircraft on an air mission to circumnavigate the global to demonstrate American long-range airpower. Two bombers completed the mission by flying 20,000 miles, while logging 103 hours and 50 minutes of flight time including eight stops for a total trip of 14 days.\n\nAn Eighth Air Force B-36 Peacemaker bomber conducted a 9,400-mile non-stop flight from Texas to Hawaii and return without refueling.\n\n26 February to 2 March – The aircrew of Lucky Lady II, (s/n 45-010) a B-50 Superfortress bomber assigned to 43d Bomb Group, Eighth Air Force completed the first nonstop flight around the world by an airplane. The aircrew flew more than 23,452 miles in 94 hours and one minute, taking off and landing at Carswell Air Force Base, Texas; with refueling in the air over the Azores, Arabia, the Philippines, and Hawaii. For this flight, the Lucky Lady II aircrew won the Mackay Trophy; the first ever to be awarded to Strategic Air Command.\n\nA single B-36 Peacekeeper bomber from Eighth Air Force assigned 7th Bomb Group flew 9,600 miles unrefueled within the United States in 43 hours.\n\nEighth Air Force began integration of African American airmen into all its assigned organizations.\n\nHeadquarters Eighth Air Force hosted a B-36 bomber conference with representatives from the Air Staff, Air Training Command, and Air Material Command to resolve engineering defects, maintenance, personnel, training, and manning challenges.\n\nHeadquarters Eighth Air Force implemented Strategic Air Command Regulation 66-12 that established a specialized aircraft maintenance organization replacing the Crew Chief system of maintenance as well as standardized maintenance procedures throughout the Command.\n\nEighth Air Force’s mission was change by Strategic Air Command to one of manning, training, and equipping assigned combat and service units for the primary purpose of conducting strategic air warfare with both atomic and conventional weapons.\n\nStrategic Air Command changed the mission of its three assigned Numbered Air Forces with Eighth Air Force gaining responsibility for all heavy bomb operations.\n\nThe first KB-29P aerial tanker is delivered to the Eighth Air Force.\n\n15 to 18 September – During the first phase of Operation Fox Able Three, Eighth Air Force assigned 27th Fighter Escort Wing ferried 89 F-84E Thunderjet fighter aircraft from Bergstrom AFB, Texas to Air Force units at Furstenfeldbruck, Germany. Refueling stops were made at McGuire AFB, New Jersey; Goose AB, Labrador; Bluie West One (Nassasurak AB) Greenland; Keflavik, Iceland; and RAF Manston in England.\n\n15 to 28 October – 27th Fighter-Escort Wing executed the second phase of Fox Able Three by ferrying 91 jet fighters from Bergstrom AFB, Texas to Germany.\n\nFor achieving the first mass deployment of jet-powered fighters over the Atlantic Ocean, the 27th Fighter Escort Wing was presented the Mackay Trophy by General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, USAF Chief of Staff.\n\n8 November 1950 to 30 June 1951 – Eighth Air Force’s only assigned unit to be deployed for the Korean War was the 27th Fighter-Escort Wing. The wing commenced deployment of 75 F-84E Thunderjet fighter aircraft to the Far East for air combat duty in the Korean War from Bergstrom AFB, Texas to San Diego Naval Air Station and after being loaded aboard two aircraft carriers; departed on 13 and 14 September docking in Japan on 30 November 1950. The 27th Fighter-Escort Wing was placed under the operational control of Far East Air Forces and saw air combat over the Korean Peninsula – to include air-to-air combat with Chinese MiG-15 fighter aircraft. This fighter wing became highly decorated with four Distinguished Flying Crosses and 23 Air Medals.\n\nSix B-36s of the Eighth’s 7th Bomb Wing few a training mission from Carswell AFB, Texas to RAF Lakenheath, England, returning on 21 January 1951.\n\nProvisional training squadrons were organized and assigned to each Eighth Air Force base to provide centralized control of administration for all individual training except for air crew training.\n\nThree B-36D Peacekeepers heavy bombers from 7th Bomb Wing participated in the Paris Air Show.\n\nThe first B-36s Peacekeeper bombers landed at Sidi Slimane Air Base, in French Morocco. Six heavy bombers from the Eighth’s 11th Bomb Wing arrived at after covering 4,984 miles, 21 hours, nonstop from Carswell AFB, Texas. The B-36s departed for home station of Carswell AFB, Texas on 5 December landing on 6 December after a 27 hour flight.\n\nEighth Air Force’s 509th Bomb Wing participated in the Royal Air Force Strike Command’s Bombing and Navigation Competition and the Wing’s B-50D Superfortress bomber took second place in the competition.\n\nEight B-50D Superfortress bomber aircraft assigned to the 509th Bomb Wing of Eighth Air Force flew over the city of Brussels, Belgium in the first airpower demonstration for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) officials.\n\nA severe weather storm struck Carswell AFB, Texas where it damaged 72 B-36 Peacekeeper bomber aircraft assigned to Eighth Air Force’s 7th and 11th Bomb Wings.\n\n13-18 October – Strategic Air Command conducted the Fourth Annual Bombing and Navigation Completion which involved 19 wings and participation by the Royal Air Force. Award of the Fairchild Trophy (for best bomber unit in combined fields of bombing and navigation) was a tie between Eighth Air Force’s 97th Bomb Wing and Fifteenth Air Force’s 93rd Bomb Wing. General Thomas S. Powers as the Vice Commander-in-Chief of Strategic Air Command flipped a coin to determine which unit would possess the trophy for the first six months – the 93rd Bomb Wing won the flip.\n\n24 October to 1 November – Strategic Air Command conducted its first Reconnaissance, Photo, and Navigation Competition resulting in Eighth Air Force’s sole participant, the 28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing being the first winner of the P. T. Cullen Trophy.\n\n6 October 1952 to 13 February 1953 – The 27th Fighter Escort Wing deployed again to the Korean War. This unique deployment from Bergstrom AFB, Texas included a 7,800 mile air trip composed of island-hopping. From Texas the F-84G Thunderjet fighter aircraft landed in Hawaii, Midway Island, and Misawa Air Base in Japan. The 2,572 mile route from Midway Island to Japan became the longest over-the-water, air-to-air refueling of jet fighters in aviation history up that time.\n\nTen B-36 Peacemaker bombers aircraft assigned to the 6th Bomb Wing, Heavy of Eighth Air Force conducted operations out of Thule AFB, Greenland.\n\nThe Eighth Air Force’s first KC-97 Stratotanker was delivered to the 96th Air Refueling Squadron at Altus AFB, Oklahoma; with this aerial tanker vital to world-wide strategic operations of the Eighth’s assigned B-47 Stratojet.\n\nThe Eighth Air Force Noncommissioned Academy began its first class at Bergstrom AFB, Texas.\n\nHeadquarters 1st Air Division was organized at Westover AFB, Massachusetts and served as a holding unit for the planned move of Eighth Air Force headquarters to the base.\n\nWestover AFB, Massachusetts was transferred from the Military Air Transport Service to the Strategic Air Command and assigned to Eighth Air Force. During this major reorganization several units and installations were transferred between several Numbered Air Forces applying also to Eighth Air Force.\n\nHeadquarters Eighth Air Force began its operations at Westover AFB, Massachusetts.\n\nMajor General Walter C. Sweeney, Jr. assumed command of Eighth Air Force becoming the longest serving Commander in Eighth’s history relinquishing command on 1 October 1961.\n\nThe 42d Bomb Wing, Heavy, at Loring AFB, Maine received the first B-52 Stratofortress assigned to Eighth Air Force.\n\nEighth Air Force received a new mission set from Strategic Air Command.\n\nSpecifically, the Eighth was to: (1) train, and equip itself to conduct strategic air warfare on a world-wide basis, using either nuclear or conventional weapons, (2) perform tasks assigned in the current Emergency War Plan and in related operations orders, (3) train and administer assigned reserve personnel and units, (4) participate in disaster relief and other domestic emergencies, and (5) perform such special missions as directed by the Commander-in-Chief Strategic Air Command.\n\nHeadquarters Northeast Air Command was discontinued thus resulting in Eighth Air Force gaining airbases and USAF units under its jurisdiction including multiple air bases in Newfoundland (Canada) and Greenland.\n\nStrategic Air Command commenced bomber ground alert status: Eighth Air Force would conduct ground and airborne alert operations from 1957 to April 1970 and then again resume alert operations on 1 January 1975 until 27 September 1991 when alert termination was ordered by President George H.W. Bush.\n\n11 to 17 November – Operation Long Legs was begun by General Curtis E. LeMay, Vice Chief of Staff, United States Air Force flying a new KC-135 Stratotanker named City of Moses Lake (s/n 55-3126) on two aviation record making flights. Accomplished in three phases, Operation Long Legs constituted the American cooperation with Argentina Air Force in celebration of that nation’s twelfth annual Aeronautics Week. The KC-135 flown by General LeMay belonged to the 4050th Air Refueling Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force.\n\nThe first phase conducted on 11 November resulted in an aviation record of a non-stop, non-refueled flight of 6,332.85 miles from Westover AFB, Massachusetts to Buenos Aires, Argentina accomplished in 13 hours, 2 minutes. Approximately 1,000 miles were added to the distance by flying “around-the-hump” of Brazil.\n\nThe second phase was an aviation speed record established with a 5,204 miles flight from Buenos Aires to Washington, D.C. in 11 hours, 5 minutes with an average speed of 471.5 mph conducted on 13 November.\n\nThe third phase of Operation Long Legs conducted 16-17 November had six B-52 Stratofortress bombers from the Eighth Air Force assigned 42nd Bomb Wing conduct a non-stop, round-trip flyover of the Buenos Aires air show with a return Plattsburgh AFB, New York.\n\nLincoln AFB, Nebraska became the first Eighth Air Force assigned base to be reorganized to support alert operations. Subsequently other bases belonging to the Eighth began their reorganization actions to support alert duty and operations.\n\n24 to 25 November – Eighth Air Force’s participation in Strategic Air Command’s Operation Quick Kick included four B-52 Stratofortress bombers from 42d Bomb Wing and was part of Strategic Air Command’s effort to showcase its newest bomber, the B-52. In all, eight B-52s (including the four from the Eighth) few a two-day, non-stop flight around the perimeter of North America (the United States and Canada) with all eight bomber aircrews setting a new endurance aviation record by staying aloft more than 24 hours.\n\nStrategic Air Command began its reorganization of its Numbered Air Forces. Specifically, Eighth Air Force lost some airbases in the middle of the country while gaining others essentially resulting in assigned units and bases contained within the eastern part of the Continental United States.\n\nEighth Air Force entered the missile era with assignment of the 702d Strategic Missile Wing (Snark). The MX-62 Snark was a short-lived, ground launched, turbojet-powered intercontinental cruise-type nuclear missile that achieved alert status in March 1960 and the only SNARK units activated by the Air Force. (Overtime, Eighth Air Force would have assigned missile wings equipped with intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) including Atlas-F, Titan I & II, and Minuteman I & II.)\n\nThe first Snark SM-62 surface-to-surface intercontinental nuclear-armed cruise missile attained alert status with Eighth Air Force assigned 702d Strategic Missile Wing (Snark) stationed at Presque Island, Maine.\n\nThe experimental test program of having bomb wings with 70 assigned aircraft was terminated by the Strategic Air Command. The test units of 2d and 380th Bomb Wing would retain their 70 aircraft inventory, but other B-47 Stratojet equipped units would not convert. Strategic Air Command concluded the 70 aircraft organizational concept was too large for effective management. (On 25 June 1961, both bomb wings would reorganize and reduce to 45 aircraft.)\n\nThe Eighth Air Force assigned 306th Bomb Wing replaced the 19th Bomb Wing assigned to 2nd Air Force in supporting Reflex Action rotation operations at Ben Guerir AB, Morocco. Strategic Air Command forward deployed nuclear-armed B-47 Stratojets as part of its alert force. Three airbases in Morocco would be utilized for forward deployed alert rotations.\n\nMissile Site Number 5 and Number 6 respectively at Lewis and Ausable Forks in New York, were designated and assigned to Eighth Air Force and Plattsburgh AFB, New York. (During this time several Missile Sites were assigned to Eighth Air Force.)\n\nEighth Air Force assigned 19th Bomb Wing converted from B-47 Stratojet bomber aircraft to B-52 Stratofortress bombers.\n\n16 to 22 September – During the Strategic Air Command’s Combat Competition held at Fairchild AFB, Washington; Eighth Air Force won the most top honors including best B-47 and B-52 wing honors as well as awards for aerial refueling units and aircrews.\n\nStrategic Air Command discontinued the fourth bomb squadron in each medium bomb wing with the associated manpower savings providing centralized control of wing operations causing Eighth Air Force to lose a bomb squadron at six of its assigned airbases.\n\nThe first Atlas International Ballistic Missile arrived at Plattsburgh AFB, New York, an Eighth Air Force base.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis began in response to increasing tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union over discovery of Soviet nuclear ballistic missiles and jet bombers assets in Cuba. Historical context:\n\n 20 October – Eighth Air Force actions taken in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis included: (1) moving all Eighth bombers from Homestead and MacDill AFBs in Florida, (2) implement limited airborne alert operations, (3) assigned B-47 bombers began dispersal operations, (4) increased force status to Defense Condition 3, and (5) placed the 12 Atlas missile sites at Plattsburgh AFB and personnel of the Site Activation Task Force directly under Strategic Air Command control to bring the sites to alert posture quickly.\n\n 25 October – The United States implemented a naval “quarantine” blockade and air surveillance of Cuba at 1000 hours.\n\n 2 November – President John F. Kennedy spoke to the nation to report that aerial photos had confirmed Soviet missile bases were being dismantled, their missiles and related equipment were being crated, and that the fixed installations at these sites were being destroyed. However, the United States continued its air surveillance and the naval quarantine.\n\n7 November –the United States announced that missile removal would be verified by check at sea.\n\n8 November – Pentagon photographs revealed that all known missile sites were dismantled.\n\n7 December – Department of Defense announced Soviet jet bombers, apparently all the attack aircraft sent to Cuba, were loaded aboard three Soviet ships.\n\nWhiteman AFB at Knob Noster, Missouri transferred from Second Air Force to Eighth Air Force along with all assigned units simultaneously Francis E. Warren AFB at Cheyenne, Wyoming transferred from Fifteenth Air Force to the Eighth along with its assigned units.\n\nLieutenant General Joseph J. Nazzaro, the Eighth Air Force Commander (#22) since 1 October 1962 was appointed as the Vice Commander of Strategic Air Command and was replaced by Lieutenant General Horace M. Wade.\n\nStrategic Air Command began to deploy B-52 Stratofortress bomber units to Kadena AB, Okinawa as a contingency force if needed in the Vietnam War. Deployments were under the name of ARC LIGHT.\n\n18 June – The inaugural ARC LIGHT conventional air combat sortie was conducted by B-52s in the Vietnam War striking enemy targets in South Vietnam. By December 1965, B-52s would have flown 100 air combat missions in the war.\n\nBomber aircraft and their aircrews from four bomber units (none from Eighth Air Force) home stationed in the United States rotated to conduct the air war in Southeast Asia from Andersen AFB, Guam. These rotations from these four bomber units phased out by March 1966.\n\nIn early 1966, six bomber wings became cadre units on Andersen AFB, Guam and were augmented with personnel and aircrews from other wings within Strategic Air Command. Of the six cadre wings, two were assigned to Eighth Air Force. The 306th Bomb Wing from McCoy AFB, Florida was the first cadre wing from Eighth Air Force to conduct a deployment starting on 6 September 1966. After this date into 1970 several bomb wings of the Eighth deployed as cadre units with some doing repeat deployments.\n\nStrategic Air Command conducted its first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile completion with Eighth Air Force sweeping all categories for the Minuteman missile system.\n\nIn a flag move from Westover AFB, Massachusetts to Andersen AFB, Guam; Headquarters Eighth Air Force attained a new mission to plan, command & control, and implement conventional bomber operations throughout Southeast Asia, while remaining assigned to the Strategic Air Command.\n\n18-29 December – Headquarters Eighth Air Force based at Andersen AFB, Guam; in coordination with Strategic Air Command, planned and conducted 729 nighttime bomber sorties as part of Operation Linebacker II; an 11 day decisive air campaign against Hanoi-Haiphong heartland of North Vietnam resulting in influencing North Vietnam to return to the Paris Peace Talks and sign a previously negotiated cease-fire agreement. For the 11 days, USAF and USN tactical aircraft conducted daytime attacks with nighttime strikes conducted by B-52s and supporting aircraft. Some 1,200 surface-to-air missiles were fired during Linebacker II dowing 15 B-52s and 10 tactical aircraft.\n\nThe Robert J. Collier Trophy, a most prestigious recognition for achievement in aviation, was presented to Eighth Air Force for planning and implementing Operation Linebacker II over the heavily defended heartland of North Vietnam during the 11-day strategic air campaign from 18-29 December 1972. Co-winners included Seventh Air Force and Navy Task Force 77.\n\nBomber-centric air combat ends in war in Southeast Asia with the last B-52 bomber strike flown on this date. From April 1970 to this August date, Eighth Air Force had planned and then commanded and controlled B-52 operations in the air war during the Vietnam War.\n\nSummary of Bomber Statistics in Vietnam War: For 98 months of air combat conducted by B-52s in Southeast Asia; bombers flew 126,615 actual sorties, credited with dropping 6,162,000 tons of munitions with most strikes conducted in South Vietnam (55 percent), Laos (27 percent), Cambodia (12 percent), and in North Vietnam (6 percent); loss of 31 B-52s (18 to hostile fire, remainder to operational accidents.)\n\nIn a flag move, Headquarters Eighth Air Force moved from Andersen AFB, Guam to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana reassuming nuclear deterrence and alert operations under Strategic Air Command.\n\n23 to 25 October – The Twenty-Second Annual Bombing and Navigation Competition was conducted by Strategic Air Command, the first time where overseas-based Air Force units could compete. Some 43 units within the United States as well a B-52 unit stationed on Guam and an aerial tanker unit based at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa competed. Eighth Air Force’s 380th Bomb Wing (FB-111 Aardvark) took the Fairchild Trophy for a fourth time in a row. With this specific competition, Barksdale AFB in Louisiana became the official headquarters and center for the Competition’s symposium and award ceremonies.\n\nB-52 Stratofortress bombers from 2d Bomb Wing the first to be modified to carry and launch the AGM-86 Conventional Air Launch Cruise Missile (CALCM) arrived at Edwards AFB, California for testing. Eighth Air Force and its assigned 2d Bomb Wing became the test bed for the CACLM, a stand-off precision strike munition.\n\nThe Mackay Trophy was awarded in recognizing a non-stop round-the-world aviation record – nicknamed “Busy Visit” – by two B-52s Stratofortress bombers covering 21,256 statute miles in 43 hours, 55 minutes averaging 488 miles per hour. This almost entire over-the-water route was conducted to validate several Strategic Air Command contingency plans and to figure out the “how to” of conducting sea surveillance of ocean-going vessels. Bombers and aircrews were from the 410th Bomb Wing of Eighth Air Force.\n\nThe first KC-10 Extender aerial tanker was accepted and flown from the Douglas Aircraft Company in California to Barksdale AFB by Lieutenant General Edgar S. Harris, Jr. then Commander (#35) Eighth Air Force. The field testing and evaluation of the newest aerial refueler was done under the auspices the 4200th Test and Evaluation Squadron as well as both Eighth Air Force and 2d Bomb Wing.\n\nThe former Commander of Eighth Air Force, General (retired) Ira C. Eaker, donated the Castle Croom Punch Bowl Set with this sterling silver set – the engraved punch bowl and ladle along with his personal cup – becoming the heraldic device for Eighth Air Force. The entire set was created by the Black, Starr & Gorham Company in 1944 and was the centerpiece for post-war reunion events. Subsequently five other cups were donated with each like General Eaker’s cup having the Eighth’s emblem and the person’s name engraved on the cup. The bowl, ladle and six of the original nine cups are displayed within a protective cabinet inside the headquarters’ Command Section adjacent to the entryway into the Commander’s Office.\n\n15 to 18 March – Eighth Air Force B-52 Stratofortress bomber crews in collaboration with the United States Navy, gain proficiency with the Harpoon anti-ship missile in developing air-sea interdiction capabilities.\n\nEighth Air Force began to transfer space-centric units – including early warning, space surveillance, and satellite tracking – were transferred to the newly activated Air Force Space Command. The transferring had been completed by 1 May 1983. These space-centric units had previously been transferred to the Eighth in early 1980 as the Aerospace Defense Command was inactivated in April 1980.\n\n15-18 May – Two B-52 Stratofortress bombers from 2d Bomb Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force participated in a Strategic Air Command test to develop a bomber-centric air-sea interdiction capability. These bomber aircrews in an exercise at the Pacific Missile Test Range on Kwajalein Atoll successfully launched three AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles.\n\nLast B-52D model bomber (s/n 55-0674) was retired by the United States Air Force from its assignment to Eighth Air Force’s 7th Bomb Wing.\n\nThe 42d Bomb Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force reached Initial Operational Capability with the United States Navy’s AGM-94 Harpoon anti-ship missile.\n\nStrategic Air Command conducted its Twenty-Eighth Annual Bombing and Navigation Competition with first contestants participating from the United States Air Forces Europe. The Competition Headquarters at Barksdale AFB was renamed as “Hoban Hall” in honor of former Eighth Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Richard M. Hoban who had done much to establish a permanent home for “Bomb Comp” at Barksdale AFB. The Royal Air Force participated with its newest fighter-bomber aircraft the Tornado. The Fairchild Trophy was won by Eighth Air Force’s 380th Bomb Wing, the only unit in Strategic Air Command to be the recipient of this top trophy five times.\n\nThe Air Force’s newest aerial refueling aircraft – the KC-10 Extender – reached Full Operational Capability while assigned to Eighth Air Force assigned 2d Bomb Wing. The testing and evaluation of the KC-10 at Barksdale AFB had commenced in March 1981.\n\nColonel Philip J. Ford, the 384th Bomb Wing Commander (and future Eighth Air Force Commander) and Lieutenant General E. G. “Buck” Shuler, Jr., the Eighth Air Force Commander (#40) flew the last B-1B from the Rockwell International plant to McConnell AFB, Kansas.\n\n7 to 11 February – Strategic Air Command conducted its last Unit Effectiveness Inspection of Eighth Air Force resulting in 15 outstanding and 22 excellent marks.\n\nThe United States Air Force filed its Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Peacekeeper Rail Garrison system with the study listing 10 candidate bases, including five Eighth Air Force assigned installations for the system’s eventual deployment.\n\n27 April to 4 May – Strategic Air Command conducted the annual missile competition at Vandenberg AFB, California where Eighth Air Force assigned 351st Strategic Missile Wing a Minuteman II unit stationed at Whiteman AFB, Missouri won the Blanchard Trophy for the best missile wing in Strategic Air Command.\n\nCMSgt Joseph D. Cook, Eighth’s Senior Enlisted Advisor (#6) since 12 August 1986, left to become the Senior Leader Advisor to the Commander-in-Chief of Strategic Air Command.\n\n5 to 17 September – Eighth Air Force initiated Exercise Mighty Warrior 89 and during the exercise generated nearly 1,150 sorties from 10 forward operating locations in a realistic wartime environment. During the exercise, Eighth Air Force surged multiple B-52s, B-1Bs and FB-111s sorties to drop live and inert weapons on the Nellis Range, Nevada.\n\nThe aircrew of a B-1B bomber aircraft from Eighth Air Force assigned 96th Bombardment Wing at Dyess AFB, Texas skillfully landed their aircraft on a dry lakebed in the first-ever gear up emergency landing due to a retracted nose landing gear. No aircrew member was harmed, and the bomber suffered minimal damage. For this feat, the aircrew earned the Mackay Trophy for 1989.\n\nThe United States initiated military operations against Panama to protect American lives, restore democracy, and apprehend General Manuel Noriega. Eighth Air Force served as the lead Numbered Air Force for aerial tankers and assembled a tanker task force with over 90 aerial refuelers. The tankers subsequently completed 80 missions to offload 4.75 million pounds of fuel to 124 receivers in the first 22 hours of the operation.\n\n5 to 19 January – For Exercise Mighty Force 90-1, the 2d Bomb Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force deployed seven B-52s and three KC-10s aerial refuelers to Roswell Industrial Air Center for training in supporting Red Flag exercises at Nellis AFB, Nevada.\n\nWith the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the United States with allied nations built a coalition force under Operation Desert Shield. On 7 August, as part of Strategic Air Command prepared bomber and aerial refueling aircraft for possible deployment, Eighth Air Force Commander, Lieutenant General E. G. “Buck” Shuler, Jr., held his first battle staff conference. Aircraft began to be deployed to theater within days afterwards.\n\nThe 509th Bomb Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force closed at Pease AFB, New Hampshire and simultaneously opened at Whiteman AFB, Missouri.\n\n16-17 January – In Operation Senior Surprise (nicknamed “Secret Squirrel”) seven B-52Gs from Eighth Air Force assigned 2d Bomb Wing, deployed from Barksdale AFB against targets in Iraq. This singular mission turned out to be the longest single air combat mission in history (35.4 hours to complete a 14,000-mile round trip flight), combat debut of the Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missiles (CALCM) precision munitions, first Continental United States (CONUS) to CONUS air combat mission, and first use of standoff air tactics. This air strike was the first air combat mission opening Operation Desert Storm.\n\n21 January thru 15 April – Strategic Air Command established the “Mighty Express” – a special airlift channel to funnel supplies and equipment to intermediate service centers supporting Operation Desert Storm. Eighth Air Force’s Logistics Readiness Center assumed control over the logistics network.\n\nStrategic Air Command implemented its objective wing restructuring plan so to create logistics, operations, and support groups under each wing-level organization. Specifically for Eighth Air Force, the restructuring caused 12 bomber equipped wings to be redesignated with the new nomenclature of “Bomb Wing” and the restructuring caused reassignment and move of all aerial refuelings units to be consolidated under Fifteenth Air Force.\n\nFollowing presidential directions on 27 September 1991, the Strategic Air Command removed all bombers from alert. Bomber-centric nuclear alert for Strategic Air Command had commenced on 1 October 1957.\n\nUnited States Strategic Command created Task Force 204, a unique single service task force managing the daily status of nuclear-capable bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. Beginning on 1 October 1993 until 16 October 2017, the Commander Eighth Air Force was also dual hatted as Commander Task Force 204.\n\nHeadquarters Strategic Air Command was disestablished resulting in Eighth Air Force being reassigned to the newly established Air Combat Command. Ensuring actions renamed most bomber “Wing” organizations as “Bomb Wings.” Per the reassignment to Air Combat Command, the Eighth Air Force retained the: 2d, 5th, 7th, 28th, 96th, 97th, 319th, 384th, 410th, and 509th Bomb Wings.\n\nSenior leaders from Headquarters Eighth Air Force met with Air Combat Command representatives at Langley AFB, Virginia to discuss a new roles and missions for the Numbered Air Force.\n\nEighth Air Force created a Standardization and Evaluation function in its headquarters to check aircrew mission capabilities.\n\nHeadquarters Eighth Air Force reorganized, eliminating it’s the Chief of Staff and staff directorate positions by forming staff divisions.\n\nAt the direction of Air Combat Command, the Eighth Air Force established a B-52 Formal Training Unit Site Activation Team to manage the transition of the B-52 Formal Training Unit from Castle AFB, California to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana.\n\n2 to 3 June – The Mackay Trophy was awarded to Eighth Air Force’s 7th Bomb Wing for an around-the-world aviation record set by two B-1B Lancer bombers.\n\nHeadquarters Air Mobility Command transferred the 65th Wing at Lajes Air Base, in the Azores to Air Combat Command who redesignated the wing as an Air Base Wing assigned to Eighth Air Force.\n\nAir Combat Command implemented its General Purpose Numbered Air Force where Commander Eighth Air Force became the Commander Task Force - Bomber mission supporting the United States Strategic Command as well as support the United States Navy’s Atlantic Command in their counterdrug operations and long range interdiction operations in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n1 October 1993 to 16 October 2017 – The Commander United States Strategic Command created Task Force 204 (TF 204) for the generation of nuclear capable bombers with the Commander Eighth Air Force becoming dual-hatted as Commander TF204. Task force personnel was provided by Eighth Air Force’s 608th Strategic Operations Squadron (activated 4 June 2004 and inactivated 24 August 2018).\n\nAir Combat Command transferred the 35th Wing with F-15s and HH-60s stationed at Keflavik AB, Iceland from First Air Force to the Eighth Air Force.\n\n7th Bomb Wing moved from Carswell AFB, Texas to Dyess AFB, Texas but remained assigned to Eighth Air Force.\n\nThe first B-2A Spirit bomber aircraft – named “ACC-1” and later renamed the Spirit of Missouri – arrived at Whiteman AFB, Missouri and assigned to the Eighth Air Force’s 509th Bomb Wing.\n\nUnder the newly created General Purpose Numbered Air Force operational concept, Air Combat Command activated several warfighting units assigned to Headquarters Eighth Air Force at Barksdale AFB. New subordinate units included the 608th Air Operations Group, the 608th Air Communications Squadron, the 608th Air Intelligence Squadron, the 608th Air Support Squadron, the 608th Combat Operations Squadron, and the 608th Combat Plans Squadron.\n\nEighth Air Force assigned 2d Bomb Wing established Detachment 1, 2d Operations Group at Barksdale AFB to support the transition of the B-52 Formal Training Unit (FTU) activities from Castle AFB, California.
