        "text": "Lieutenant General Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher in a color engraving by an unknown author, in 1803–1806.\n\nThe era of the Great French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars showed the world many bright and talented commanders. Not lost among them was the Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, who in the Silesian Army subordinate to him received the nickname Alt Vorwarts - literally Starina (old man) Forward, although in Russian sources they often write not “starina”, but “general”.\n\n\"General Forward.\" Lithograph from a painting by M. Blankarts\n\nNapoleon contemptuously called him the Sausage Man, but once, during the famous campaign of 1806, he called him the Old Devil (le vieux diable).\n\nBlucher’s role in the Battle of Waterloo, when it was his troops who decided the outcome of this famous battle, has not been forgotten. But here’s the question: with all Blucher’s merits, can he be called a great, and even more so, great commander?\n\nBlucher, who did not receive a good education, was certainly a desperately brave and very decisive general. In this he is similar to his contemporary - Napoleonic Marshal Augereau, who at all military councils said the same thing: guns forward - and attack! And before the Battle of Castiglione, which made him famous, he said:\n\n“If we are defeated, then we will talk about retreat. Yes, and they will kill me in this case. So what should I worry about? \"\n\nHowever, it is the military leadership talents of both that raise doubts. Blucher himself understood this and usually responded to praise and compliments:\n\n“What am I? Just fast legs and that's it. Here is my chief of staff, Gneisenau!”\n\nAnd during a trip to England, when Oxford University awarded him the degree of Doctor of Canon and Civil Law, he stated:\n\n“If you want me to be a doctor, then at least make Gneisenau a pharmacist.”\n\nJ. Doe. August von Gneisenau, 1818\n\nHis joke with the invitation to those gathered to kiss their own head is also known. He himself completed this task by kissing Gneisenau on the forehead. Self-criticism and modesty are commendable. Today we will talk about this man - Gebhard Leberecht von Blucher.\n\nOrigin and early life\n\nThe future field marshal came from an old German (Lower Saxon) noble family, the first information about which dates back to the beginning of the 1742th century. His father, Christian Friedrich, served almost his entire life in the armies of various European states, but retired only as a captain. Having settled in the town of Teutenwinkel near the Mecklenburg city of Rostock, he married and had numerous children - the hero of the article, born in XNUMX, became the ninth in a row.\n\nThe family did not live well, and therefore Gebhard did not receive a good education (at the age of 12 he dropped out of school altogether); he spent a lot of time on the street, where his playmates were boys from peasant families. Blucher retained this kind of democracy in communication throughout his life; the soldiers liked it, but on the contrary, it caused irritation and rejection among his superiors and noble subordinates.\n\nAs we have already noted, Blucher’s parents did not live well, and therefore the hero of the article and his younger brother were sent to the care of their older sister, who, after getting married, settled on the island of Rügen. A Swedish garrison was stationed here, and teenagers were constantly hanging around the barracks. It all ended with the fact that in 1756 both enlisted in the Swedish hussar regiment, which caused the displeasure of their father.\n\nThe fact is that at that time the Seven Years' War was going on in Europe, and the fate of most ordinary soldiers was unenviable: they would either be killed or seriously wounded, and it was not known what was better - a quick death or a difficult and half-starved life as an invalid. At the same time, the future Prussian field marshal also found himself on the side of Prussia’s opponents.\n\nBut on August 29, 1760, during the Battle of Friedland, Blucher was surrounded by Prussian hussars and captured. By luck, here he met his maternal relative, Colonel von Belling, who invited him to join the Prussian army. So Blucher ended up in the 8th regiment of the Black Hussars, and even with the rank of cornet.\n\nGiuseppe Rava. Prussian Death Hussars\n\nWithin a few months he received the rank of second lieutenant, then prime lieutenant. For some time he served as adjutant to the regiment commander. However, the next rank of headquarters captain was awarded to Blucher only in 1771.\n\nHussar captain Gebhardt Blücher in the painting by V. Campausen\n\nThe point was the hostile relationship that he developed with the new regiment commander, who became General von Lossow. When he crossed out his name from the list of officers up for promotion in 1772, Blucher submitted a dismissal report drawn up in a harsh tone to the king, which contained the following words:\n\n“Sovereign, Jägersfeld, who has no merit other than being the son of Margrave von Schwedt, is preferred to me. I ask, Your Majesty, to deign to resign.\"\n\nFrederick II did not like such insolence. At first he even put Blucher in prison, but then granted his request, writing on the report:\n\n“Captain Blucher has been fired and can get the hell out.”\n\nDuring his service, the hero of the article managed to accumulate a certain amount of money, with which he managed to buy a small estate in Pomerania, the Grocc-Radds. He spent the next 15 years of his life there.\n\nIn 1773, Blücher married Caroline von Melling, the daughter of a Prussian general, who bore him seven children.\n\nReturn to the army\n\nThe quiet life of a provincial landowner soon tired of him, he asked to return to military service, but Frederick II turned out to be vindictive and refused. Only in 1787, a year after the death of this king, did 45-year-old Blucher receive permission to return to his regiment, and with a promotion to the rank of major.\n\nHe fought a little with the French in the Netherlands, receiving the rank of lieutenant colonel and the Order of Merit (Pour le Merite), which was considered a very honorable military award. In 1790, the hero of the article became a colonel and commander of the 8th Hussars. In 1791, he received the sad news of his wife's death, but continued to fight against the French on the Rhine.\n\nOn May 28, 1794, he managed to capture six guns from Kirrweiler and capture 300 enemy soldiers, after which he received his first general rank and became the commander of a cavalry observation (reserve) corps stationed on the border of France and the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1795, he found time to marry again - to Amalia Colomb, the sister of the Prussian cavalry general Peter Colomb, at which time he was already 53 years old. In 1801, “based on the totality of successes,” the hero of the article was awarded the rank of lieutenant general. And in 1803, Frederick William III appointed Blücher governor of Prussia, while leaving him in the honorary position of chief of his beloved 8th Hussars.\n\nBlucher's opinion on the armies of other countries\n\nIt is curious that Blucher respected Russian soldiers very much, placing them even higher than Prussian ones - in contrast to the officers, whom he reproached for lack of discipline and a tendency to underestimate the enemy. And he called Russian generals “brave commanders, but inept commanders.” The exception, in his opinion, was Suvorov; about the Seven Years' War, he said that if then “the Russians had at least one general equal to Suvorov, Prussia would have ceased to exist.”\n\nHe treated his Austrian allies with some contempt, making an exception only for the Croatian and Hungarian light cavalry.\n\nBlucher had a very low opinion of the British army (he was especially outraged by the practice of buying officer patents), and he did not change his opinion even after the Battle of Waterloo. In general, he said that Prussia should join anti-French coalitions on the condition that England would pay and Russia would fight (the Austrians, as you can see, he “out of brackets”).\n\nAs for the French, in his opinion, their combat effectiveness increased significantly during the imperial period. He considered Frederick II to be the last brilliant commander, but he did not deny Napoleon military talent, arguing that the same troops under the command of this Corsican fought much better than under the leadership of his marshals. This did not stop him from literally hating Bonaparte.\n\nThe defeat of 1806\n\nPrussia was still dreaming of the glory of the victories of Frederick the Great, and its military authority among its neighbors was very great. The same Bonaparte said that this country “hatched from a cannonball.” Contrary to Blücher's advice, the Prussians did not enter the war in 1805, but unexpectedly declared it to Napoleonic France in 1806. The result was dismal, Heine later said:\n\n\"Napoleon blew on Prussia, and it ceased to exist.\"\n\nPrussia was defeated in two battles (at Jena and Auerstedt), which took place on the same day, October 14, 1806. It was near Auerstedt that Blucher fought. The enemy of the Prussians here was the “Iron Marshal” Louis-Nicolas Davout, who, by the way, unlike Bonaparte, entered the history, as a commander who has not suffered a single defeat.\n\nDick de Loneley. Davout at the Battle of Auerstedt\n\nNapoleon then made a mistake, expecting to meet the main enemy forces at Jena. Davout and Bernadotte, according to his plan, were supposed to perform an auxiliary task - to go to the rear of the Prussian army. However, near Auerstedt (60 km north of Jena), Davout came across the main forces of the Prussians, with whom King Frederick William III was also present.\n\nFrederick William III in a portrait by an unknown artist\n\nThe balance of forces was depressing: 29 thousand soldiers and 46 guns for Davout and from 50 to 60 thousand and 230 guns for the enemy. Bernadotte did not help Davout, for which he was later almost court-martialed, but he was saved by the fact that he was married to Napoleon’s former fiancée Desiree Clary, whose elder sister was also the wife of Joseph Bonaparte.\n\nIn the ensuing battle for the village of Hassenhausen, the commander-in-chief of the Prussian army, Duke Karl Wilhelm of Brunswick, was mortally wounded, and he was replaced by the king himself, who did not shine with military talents. At the decisive moment, when the French bypassed the left flank of the Prussian army, Friedrich Wilhelm, believing that he was fighting with the entire army of Bonaparte, did not dare to bring into battle the 14 infantry battalions, 5 cavalry squadrons and 3 artillery batteries that were in reserve.\n\nIt all ended with the flight of the Prussian army, which lost about 10 thousand soldiers killed and wounded, up to three thousand Prussians were captured, and 115 artillery pieces were left to the enemy. Even Bonaparte was impressed, and in the fifth bulletin of the Grande Armée he literally wrote about the miracles that Davout’s corps performed and about the “extraordinary courage and tenacity of character” of its commander.\n\nAnd in a letter to Murat, he called the Battle of Auerstadt “an excellent battle.” The division commanders of Davout's III Corps (Gudin, Friant and Morand) received the nickname \"immortals\" after this battle.\n\nFrederick William III and his wife Louise, who was nearby with their children, fled in different directions. Arriving in Konigsberg, the queen fell ill with “nervous fever” (probably typhus), however, despite the illness, she ordered herself and the children to be transported along the Curonian Spit to Memel (Klaipeda).\n\nThe flight of Queen Louise along the Curonian Spit in a drawing by an unknown author\n\nHer husband later arrived here, and here they met with Alexander I.\n\nAfter the defeat, Blucher led the rearguard units, which covered the retreat - and were defeated by Bernadotte's finally approaching corps. Nevertheless, Blucher managed to withdraw his units to the neutral city of Lubeck, where he hoped to put his soldiers on English ships, which, however, were not in the port. Lübeck was besieged by French troops, and Blücher was forced to surrender. In the protocol of surrender he wrote:\n\n“I capitulate because I have no more food or ammunition.”\n\nDespite the defeat, Bonaparte then appreciated the tenacity of the 64-year-old Prussian general:\n\n\"That old devil held almost half my army.\"\n\nBlücher was captured, but on March 8, 1807, he was exchanged for Claude-Victor Perrin, better known as Napoleonic Marshal Victor (then a general), who in January 1807, on his way to Stettin, was accidentally captured by suddenly appearing Prussian cavalrymen.\n\nK. Rechling. Exchange of General Blucher for French General Victor\n\nIn his homeland, Blucher was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle and appointed to the post of Governor-General of Pomerania; in 1809, he received the rank of cavalry general (corresponding to the rank of marshal of the military branch).\n\nHowever, undisguised hatred of Napoleon, bellicose rhetoric and even cooperation with the patriotic society “Tugenbund” led to resignation in 1812 - Frederick William III was terribly afraid of Bonaparte and did not want to provoke him into a new war. The 70-year-old general settled in Breslau (in Wroclaw).\n\nHaving learned about the beginning of Napoleon's war with Russia, he declared: “This is where Bonaparte will bury his glory!”\n\nAnd it soon became clear that Blucher had waited in the wings.\n\nOn December 18 (30), 1812, Prussian Lieutenant General L. York von Wartenburg and Russian General I. I. Dibich signed the Taurogen Convention on the “neutralization” of the Prussian auxiliary corps, which was part of the Napoleonic army. Already on December 24, 1812 (January 5, 1813), Russian troops occupied Königsberg, and on January 22 (Gregorian calendar), the King of Prussia, Frederick William III, left French-controlled Berlin for the capital of Silesia, Breslau (Wroclaw).\n\nEvents developed rapidly. On January 24 (February 5), 1813, the Landtag, assembled in Königsberg, announced the introduction of military service in East Prussia for men aged 18 to 40 years and the creation of a 20-strong “people's militia” corps. On February 3, a royal decree was issued on the formation of volunteer huntsman detachments.\n\nOn February 16 (28), 1813, the Treaty of Kalisz Union was signed, which became the basis of the 6th anti-French coalition. Russia pledged to field an army of 150 thousand people against Napoleon, Prussia - 80 thousand. Sweden, Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Mecklenburg-Schwerin joined this coalition. England has traditionally promised to help with money.\n\nOn February 20 (March 4), 1813, Russian troops occupied Berlin without a fight.\n\nOn March 16, Frederick William III officially declared war on France.\n\nFor the first time in his life, Blücher took over the post of commander-in-chief; in Silesia he had a 27-strong army under his command, reinforced by a 13-strong Russian corps. In March 1813 she moved to Saxony.\n\nIn the next article we will continue the story about Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher.\n\nRyzhov V.A."
