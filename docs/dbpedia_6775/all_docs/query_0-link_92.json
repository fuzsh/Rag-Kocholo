        "text": "Location\n\nOsan Air Base is located in Pyongtaek City, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea. The base operator’s phone number is 011-82-31-661-1110 or DSN 315-784-1110.\n\nView Larger Map\n\nHistory\n\nOsan Air Base (AB) is one of two major airfields operated by the U.S. in Korea and the only USAF facility in the Republic of Korea (ROK) entirely planned and built by the U.S. from scratch during the Korean War. The base is located 4.7 miles southwest of the town of Osan, for which it is named, and 40 miles south of Seoul, the capital city. Prior to the invasion of the Republic of Korea by the North Korean communists in 1950, the area consisted of several tiny farming villages near the hillsides and a large number of rice paddie areas where the runway now lies. A large ginko tree marked the village square of one of these villages and still stands on a hill in the base golf course.\n\nEstablished in November 1951, the base was originally named Osan-ni Air Base (but more often referred to by its “K-55” airfield designation) in November 1951. The first base commander chose the name “Osan-ni” for practical reasons, as it was the only village shown on military maps in the region and it was easy to pronounce. In 1952 the ROK government allowed the U.S. to acquire 1,250 acres for the air base. Throughout 1952, a aviation engineers constructed a 9,000-foot runway and base support facilities were constructed. On 26 December 1952, the Osan-ni’s first operational flying unit and support elements of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing (FBW) arrived at the base, including advanced elements of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing. The 18 FBW conducted combat air operations from Osan-ni Air Base in support of United Nations ground forces throughout the Korean War, and provided post-war tactical air power until October 1954. Please visit the Osan Air Base homepage for more information.\n\nMeanwhile, the 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing replaced the 18th FBW in March 1955, and assumed the air defense role with the F-86F. The wing remained the only permanently-based USAF tactical wing in Korea until July 1958. From that time, Pacific Air Forces rotated tactical fighter units into Osan AB over the next 13 years until the 36th Tactical Fighter Squadron was permanently assigned to Osan AB in November 1971 (Harrumph!). The 51st Fighter Wing (FW) was originally activated at Osan AB on 1 November 1971 as the 51st Air Base Wing. The “51st” designation has remained at Osan AB ever since. Osan transitioned to standby status and hosted only temporary duty or transient units involved in Pacific Air Forces tactical operations. The base became a permanent peacetime installation. Osan has hosted many types of fighter aircraft in its history. Today, the host 51st Fighter Wing flies the A-10 (Pilsung!) and F-16 fighter (Harrumph!) aircraft.\n\nMission\n\nTeam Osan and Why We’re Here — Osan Air Base, located just 48 miles south of the Korean DMZ, is home to the “Mustangs” of the 51st Fighter Wing and 24 tenant units, including Seventh Air Force.

Our wing with its 24 PAA, F-16 and A-10 squadrons, along with a C-12 airlift flight and a myriad of base support agencies conducts the full spectrum of missions providing for the defense of the Republic of Korea.
