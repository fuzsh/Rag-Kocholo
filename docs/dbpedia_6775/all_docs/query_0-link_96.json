        "text": "Good flying never killed an enemy.\n\nAttributed to Major Edward 'Mick' Mannock, RAF, ranking British fighter ace of WWI, credited with 61 victories. Cited in 2008 book Mannock: The Life and Death of Major Edward Mannock VC, DSO, MC, RAF.\n\nFirst and foremost I had to learn to fly; learn, and then cast the thought of flying away into the background. Flying in itself is wholly unpredominant: to have a perfect pair of hands is important, but it is only a question of degree, not the end-all and be-all. Smooth landings do not affect the success of an operation; it is finding the right way to the right place that matters. In other words, flying must be subconscious.\n\nGroup Captain Leonard Cheshire, in his book Bomber Pilot, 1943.\n\nMen were going to die in the air as they had died for centuries on the ground and on the seas, by killing each other. The conquest of the air war truly accomplished.\n\nRenÃ© Chambe, Au Temps des Carabines, 1955.\n\nUp there the world is divided into bastards and suckers. Make your choice.\n\nDerek Robinson, RAF fighter pilot, Piece of Cake, 1983.\n\nThey fall into two broad categories; those who are going out to shoot and those who secretly and desperately know they will be shot at, the hunters and the hunted.\n\nAir Vice-Marshal J. E. 'Johnnie' Johnson, RAF, regards fighter pilots. He was the highest scoring Western Allied fighter ace against the German Luftwaffe, making him one of the hunters. Wing leader, 1956.\n\nYou lived and died alone, especially in fighters. Fighters. Somehow, despite everything, that word had not become sterile. You slipped into the hollow cockpit and strapped and plugged yourself into the machine. The canopy ground shut and sealed you off. Your oxygen, your very breath, you carried into the chilled vacuum, in a steel bottle.\n\nJames Salter, The Hunters, 1956.\n\nI belong to a group of men who fly alone. There is only one seat in the cockpit of a fighter airplane. There is no space alotted for another pilot to tune the radios in the weather or make the calls to air traffic control centers or to help with the emergency procedures or to call off the airspeed down final approach. There is no one else to break the solitude of a long cross-country flight. There is no one else to make decisions.\n\nI do everything myself, from engine start to engine shutdown. In a war, I will face alone the missiles and the flak and the small-arms fire over the front lines.\n\nIf I die, I will die alone.\n\nRichard Bach, Stranger to the Ground, 1963.\n\nThe heavens are their battlefield. They are the Cavalry of the Clouds. High above the squalor and the mud, so high in the firmament that they are not visible from earth, they fight out the eternal issues of right and wrong. They are struggling there by day, yea and by night in that titanic conflict between the great foes of light and of darkness. They fight the foe high up and they fight low down. They skim like armed swallows along the front, taking in their flights men armed with rifle and machine gun. They scatter infantry on the march, they destroy convoys, the scatter dismay. Every flight is romance, every record is an epic. They are the knight errants of this war, without fear and without reproach. They recall the old legends of chivalry, not merely by the daring of individual exploits, but by the nobility of their spirit and amongst the multitudes of heroes, we must continuously thank the cavalry of the air\n\nDavid Lloyd George, British Prime Minister, speech to the House of Commons in movement of a motion of thanks to the armed services, 29 October 1917.\n\nI scooted for our lines, sticky with fear. I vomited brandy and milk and bile all over my instrument panel. Yes, it was very romantic flying, people said later, like a knight errant in the clean blue sky of personal combat, in whipcord breeches and a British tunic with long Bond-Street-cut tails.\n\nW. W. Windstaff, the publishing pseudonym of a wealthy American pilot flying with the British RFC in WWI. His true identity remains a secret. Written to be privately published in 1929. Eventually published as the 1993 book Lower Than Angels: A Memoir of War & Peace\n\nThe more mechanical become the weapons with which we fight, the less mechanical must be the spirit which controls them.\n\nField Marshal Archibald P. Wavell, British Army, in his 1936 book Generalship, its Diseases and their Cure.\n\nI go forth into battle light of heart â¦ I regard it as a privilege to fight for all those things that make life worth living—freedom, honour and fair play â¦ Flying has meant the companionship of men, the intoxication of speed, the rush of air and the pulsating beat of the motor awaken some answering chord deep down which is indescribable.\n\nWilliam 'Bill' Millington, RAF. Letter to his parents from hospital, after his Hurricane was set alight in combat with Me109âs during the Battle of Britian. Quoted by Peter Townsend in the 2015 book The Few: Fight for the Skies.\n\nI mean, I had fast motor cars and fast motor bikes, and when I wasnât crashing airplanes, I was crashing motor bikes. Itâs all part of the game.\n\nAttributed to Air Chief Marshal Sir Harry 'Broady' Broadhurst, RAF, 13 victories WWII.\n\nI wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast; for I intend to go in harms way.\n\nCaptain John Paul Jones, Continental Navy, letter to Le Ray de Chaumont, 16 November 1778. Quoted in the 1890 book The Naval History of the United States.\n\nThe hunters are the ones who go out and kill. Maybe one out of ten good fighter pilots will be one of the hunters.\n\nAttributed to Jack Ilfrey, USAAF, 8 victories WWII.\n\nTo the aircraft I aim, not the man.\n\nFrancesco Baracca, Corpo Aeronautico Militare, Italyâs leading ace of WWI with 34 victories. Original Italian “Ã¨ all'apparecchio che io miro, non all'uomo”. The prancing horse emblem he sported on his aircraft was later used by Enzo Ferrari on his cars. Quoted in the 2016 book Umili Eroi.\n\nYou donât think much of the individual, because you donât think youâve hit him and you hope that he will bail out or something; it's the aeroplane youâve hit â¦ normally it was more of a game if you like, you were outwitting and shooting down another aircraft, you were simply hitting metal.\n\nWing commander Pete Malam Brothers, RAF, 16 victories WWII. Imperial War Museum Sound Archive, 1917.\n\nI hate to shoot a Hun down without him seeing me, for although this method is in accordance with my doctrine, it is against what little sporting instincts I have left.\n\nMajor James 'Mac' McCudden, RFC and RAF, 57 victories WWI. Flying Fury: Five Years In The Royal Flying Corps, 1918.\n\nMy habit of attacking Huns dangling from their parachutes led to many arguments in the mess. Some officers, of the Eton and Sandhurst type, thought it was ‘unsportsmanlikeâ to do it. Never having been to a public school, I was unhampered by such considerations of form. I just pointed out that there was a bloody war on, and that I intended to avenge my pals.\n\nCaptain James Ira Thomas 'Taffy' Jones, RFC, 37 victories in 3 months WWI. Quoted in the 2007 book Fighter Aces of the RAF in the Battle of Britain.\n\nA glorious death. Fight on and fly on to the last drop of blood and the last drop of benzen — to the last beat of the heart and the last kick of the motor: a death for a knight — a toast for his fellow, friend and foe.\n\nCaptain Manfred von Richthofen, the 'Red Baron', LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte. Toast to Boelche, Jagdstaffel 2 mess. Quoted in the 1927 book The Red Knight of Germany.\n\nFighting in the air is not sport. It is scientific murder.\n\nCaptain Edward V. 'Eddie' Rickenbacker, USAS, Fighting the Flying Circus, 1919.\n\nThe first time I ever saw a jet, I shot it down.\n\nGeneral Charles 'Chuck' Yeager, USAF. Eleven victories in WWII, here describing his 6 November 1944 sighting of a German jet. In a twitter post on 8 November 2018 he continues:\n\nâI was first in my group to shoot down an Me262. He was on final — not very sportsmanlike — but what the hell?â\n\nIt was my view that no kill was worth the life of a wingman, many of whom were young and inexperienced boys. Pilots in my unit who lost wingmen on this basis were prohibited from leading a Rotte. The were made to fly as wingman, instead.\n\nColonel Erich 'Bubi' Hartmann, Luftwaffe and GAF. 352 victories, the most successful fighter ace in history. Quoted in the 2014 book Luftwaffe War Diary: Pilots & Aces: Uniforms & Equipment.\n\nThe wingman is absolutely indispensable. I look after the wingman. The wingman looks after me. Itâs another set of eyes protecting you. That the defensive part. Offensively, it gives you a lot more firepower. We work together. We fight together. The wingman knows what his responsibilities are, and knows what mine are. Wars are not won by individuals. theyâre won by teams.\n\nAttributed to Lt. Col. Francis S. 'Gabby' Gabreski, USAF, 28 victories in WWII and 6.5 MiGs over Korea. For example by USAF at www.af.mil/News/Photos/igphoto/2000446347/ and in the 2011 book Viper Force: 56th Fighter Wing — To Fly and Fight the F-16.\n\nThere is a peculiar gratification on receiving congratulations from oneâs squadron for a victory in the air. It is worth more to a pilot than the applause of the whole outside world. It means that one has won the confidence of men who share the misgivings, the aspirations, the trials and the dangers of aeroplane fighting.\n\nCaptain Edward V. 'Eddie' Rickenbacker, USAS. 26 victories in WWI. Fighting the Flying Circus, 1919.\n\nOnce committed to an attack, fly in at full speed. After scoring crippling or disabling hits, I would clear myself and then repeat the process. I never pursued the enemy once they had eluded me. Better to break off and set up again for a new assault. I always began my attacks from full strength, if possible, my ideal flying height being 22,000 ft because at that altitude I could best utilize the performance of my aircraft. Combat flying is based on the slashing attack and rough maneuvering. In combat flying, fancy precision aerobatic work is really not of much use. Instead, it is the rough maneuver which succeeds.\n\nColonel Erich 'Bubi' Hartmann, Luftwaffe, the world's leading ace, with 352 victories in WWII. Cited in 2000 book Aces.\n\nAnd I have yet to find one single individual who has attained conspicuous success in bringing down enemy aeroplanes who can be said to be spoiled either by his successes or by the generous congratulations of his comrades. If he were capable of being spoiled he would not have had the character to have won continuous victories, for the smallest amount of vanity is fatal in aeroplane fighting. Self-distrust rather is the quality to which many a pilot owes his protracted existence.\n\nCaptain Edward V. 'Eddie' Rickenbacker, USAS. 26 victories in WWI. Fighting the Flying Circus, 1919.\n\nIn every squadron there were, perhaps, four or five pilots who exuded confidence. They knew that they were going out to shoot. The rest knew sub-consciously, that they would make up the numbers, mill about, and get shot at.\n\nLynn Garrison, quoted in 2003 book Fighter Command Air Combat Claims, 1939â45.\n\nThe hours I spent more than thirty thousand feet in the bitterly cold air over that alien land were the most productive of self-study. Nothing makes a man more aware of his capabilities and of his intrinsic limitations than those moments when he must push aside all the familiar defenses of ego and vanity, and accept reality by staring, with the fear that is normal to a man in combat, into the face of Death.\n\nMajor Robert S. Johnson, USAAF. Thunderbolt!: The Extraordinary Story of a World War II Ace, 1958.\n\nThe duty of the fighter pilot is to patrol his area of the sky, and shoot down any enemy fighters in that area. Anything else is rubbish.\n\nCaptain Manfred von Richthofen, the 'Red Baron', LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte, 1917. Richtofen would not let members of his Staffel strafe troops in the trenches. Quoted in the 2016 book Historyâs Greatest Pilots Close Up.\n\nAnybody who doesnât have fear is an idiot. Itâs just that you must make the fear work for you. Hell, when somebody shot at me, it made me madder than hell, and all I wanted to do was shoot back.\n\nBrigadier General Robin Olds, USAF. Undated, cited by USAF at www.af.mil/News/Photos/igphoto/2000446288/\n\nThe most important thing in fighting was shooting, next the various tactics in coming into a fight and last of all flying ability itself.\n\nLt. Colonel W. A. 'Billy' Bishop, RFC. Officially credited with 72 victories, making him the top Canadian and British Empire ace of WWI. Winged Warfare, 1918.\n\nTo be able to fight well, a pilot must be able to have absolute control over his machine. He must know by the âfeelâ of it exactly how the machine is, what position it is in, and how it is flying, so that he may manoeuvre rapidly, and at the same time watch his opponent or opponents. He must be able to loop, turn his machine over on its back and do various over flying âstunts,â not that these are actually neccessary during a combat, but from the fact that he has done these things several times he gets the absolute confidence and when the fight comes along he is not worrying about how the machine will act. He can devote all his time to fighting the other felllow; the flying part of it coming instinctively. Thus the flying part, although perhaps the hardest to train a man for, is the least important factor in aerial fighting.\n\nMajor W. A. 'Billy' Bishop. Winged Warfare, 1918.\n\nIn nearly all cases where machines have been downed, it was during a fight which had been very short, and the successful burst of fire had occurred within the space of a minute after the beginning of actual hostilities.\n\nW. A. 'Billy' Bishop, RFC. Shooting Stars, The Saturday Evening Post, 1 June 1918.\n\nYou must take the war to the enemy. You must attack and go on attacking all the time.\n\nMajor Willy Omer FranÃ§ois Jean Coppens de Houthulst, Belgian Air Service, 37 victories WWI.\n\nA fixed determination to attack and win will be the surest road to vistory.\n\nRFC Training Manual, 1913. Cited in 2018 book The Birth of the RAF.\n\nIt is quite simple. I fly close to my man, aim well and then of course he falls down.\n\nLieutenant Oswald Boelcke, probably the worldâs first ace, spoken to the future 'Red Baron' in a dining car on a train. Quoted in the chapter How I Med Boelcke by Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen in his 1917 book The Red Battle Flyer.\n\nAerial gunnery was 90 percent instinct and 10 percent aim.\n\nCaptain Frederick C. Libby, RFC. 14 victories WWI. Quoted in 1979 book Fighter Aces of the U.S.A.\n\nI had no system of shooting as such. It is definitely more in the feeling side of things that these skills develop. I was at the front five and a half years, and you just got a feeling for the right amount of lead.\n\nLt. General Guenther Rall, GAF. Quoted in the 1985 book Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering.\n\nWhen one has shot down oneâs first, second and third opponent, then one begins to find out how the trick is done.\n\nCaptain Manfred von Richthofen, the 'Red Baron', LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte. My Air Victories, Pearsonâs Magazine, July 1918.\n\nPublished in the US soon after his death, it was reportedly written âjust after his fiftieth victoryâ, and reveals the writer, said the editor, âas somewhat callous, not to say cruel, with no pity for the vanquished and no compassion for the suffering he had brought upon the innocentâ.\n\nI put my bullets into the target as if I placed them there by hand.\n\nCapitaine RenÃ© Paul Fonck, French Air Service, 75 victories WWI. Quoted in the 1968 book The Great Air War: The Men, the Planes, the Saga of Military Aviation, 1914 - 1918.\n\nYou can have computer sights of anything you like, but I think you have to go to the enemy on the shortest distance and knock him down from point-blank range. youâll get him from in close. At long distance, it's questionable.\n\nColonel Erich 'Bubi' Hartmann, Luftwaffe. Quoted in the 1985 book Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering.\n\nI am not a good shot. Few of us are. To make up for this I hold my fire until I have a shot of less than 20 degrees deflection and until Iâm within 300 yards. Good discipline on this score can make up for a great deal.\n\nGeneral John C. Meyer, USAAF and USAF. 24 victories in WWII, later became commander-in-chief of Strategic Air Command. Originally quoted as part of The Long Reach, an internal Eighth Air Force VIII Fighter Command publication for fighter pilots, printed in May 1944. Published in 2000 as Long Reach VIII Fighter Command at War.\n\nGo in close, and when you think you are too close, go in closer.\n\nMajor Thomas B. 'Tommy' McGuire, USAAF. Quoted in the 1965 book Seven Heros: Medal of Honor Stories of the War in the Pacific.\n\nMy only tactic was to wait until I had the chance to attck the enemy and then close in at high speed. I opened fire only when the whole windshield was black with the enemy. Wait! Wait!— until the enemy covers your windshield. Then not a single shot goes wild â¦ it doesn't matter what your angle is to him and whether or not you are in a turn or any other maneuver. When all your guns hit him like this, he goes down!\n\nColonel Erich 'Bubi' Hartmann, Luftwaffe, 352 victories WWII. Quoted in 1968 book Fighter Aces of the Luftwaffe.\n\nAs long as I look right into the muzzles, nothing can happen to me. Only if he pulls lead am I in danger.\n\nCaptain Hans-Joachim Marseille, the 'Star of Africa', Luftwaffe, 158 victories WWII. Quoted in the 2007 book Fighter Aces of the Luftwaffe in World War II.\n\nEverything in the air that is beneath me, especially if it is a one-seater, a chaser, is lost, for it cannot shoot to the rear.\n\nCaptain Manfred von Richthofen, the 'Red Baron', LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte, top scoring ace of WWI with 80 victories. The Red Fighter Pilot, 1917.\n\nI started shooting when I was much too far away. That was merely a trick of mine. I did not mean so much as to hit him as to frighten him, and I succeeded in catching him. He began flying curves and this enabled me to draw near.\n\nCaptain Manfred von Richthofen, the 'Red Baron', LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte, top scoring ace of WWI with 80 victories. The Red Fighter Pilot, 1917.\n\nA fighter without a gun â¦ is like an airplane without a wing.\n\nBrigadier General Robin Olds, USAF. Quoted in the 1977 book F-4 Phantom.\n\nIâm waiting to be told how cobras, hooks, or vectored thrust help in combat. theyâre great at air shows, but zero energy is a fighter pilotâs nightmare. Shoot your opponent down and his number two will be on your tail thinking it's his birthday â a target hanging there in the sky with zero energy.\n\nNed Firth, Eurofighter\n\nSee - Decide - Attack - Reverse.\n\nColonel Erich 'Bubi' Hartmann, Luftwaffe. The most successful fighter ace in the history of aerial warfare. The Blond Knight of Germany: A biography of Erich Hartmann.\n\nSo it was that the war in the air began. Men rode upon the whirlwind that night and slew and fell like archangels. The sky rained heroes upon the astonished earth. Surely the last fights of mankind were the best. What was the heavy pounding of your Homeric swordsmen, what was the creaking charge of chariots, besides this swift rush, this crash, this giddy triumph, this headlong sweep to death?\n\nH. G. Wells, The World Set Free, 1914.\n\nI know that flying over the Soviet Union without permission was spying. I knew that it was. But I really didnât think that in the true sense of the word spy I ever considered myself a spy. I was a pilot flying an airplane and it just so happened that where I was flying made what I was doing spying.\n\nFrancis Gary Power, U-2 reconnaissance pilot held by the Soviets for spying, in an interview after he was returned to the US. Quoted in the 1988 book Mayday: Eisenhower, Khrushchev, and the U-2 Affair.\n\nMy pilot pointed to his left front and above, and looking in the direction he pointed, I saw a long dark brown form fairly streaking across the sky. We could see that it was a German machine, and when it got above and behind our middle machine, it dived on it for all the world like a huge hawk on a hapless sparrow.\n\nJames McCudden, VC, RFC. Flying Fury: Five Years in the Royal Flying Corps, 1918.\n\nA fixed determination to attack and win will be the surest road to victory.\n\nRFC Training Manual, 1913. Quoted in the 2018 book The Birth of the RAF.\n\nOne thing was to know how to fly the airplane. He has to know it, to love to fly, to be aggressive and to have good eyeballs and to know how to use them. Iâd say he has to have an instinctive capability for air fighting. â¦Fighting spirit one must have. Even if a man lacks some of the other qualifications, he can often make up for it in fighting spirit.\n\nBrigadier General Robin Olds, USAF. Trriple ace, with 17 victories in WWII and the Vietnam War. Quoted in the 1972 book Fighter Tactics and Strategy 1914 - 1970. At the time he said this, he was Comandant of Cadets at the Air Force Academy, after commanding the 8th Wing at Ubon, Thailand, during the Vietnam War.\n\nI never went into the air thinking I would lose.\n\nCommander Randy 'Duke' Cunningham, USN. Only Navy ace of Vietnam, later a Top Gun instructor and Commander of adversary squadron VF-126. Quoted in 1974 book And Kill MiGs, Air to Air Combat in the Vietnam War.\n\nSpeed is life.\n\nAnon., popularized by Samuel Flynn, Jr., USN.\n\nSpeed is the cushion of sloppiness.\n\nCommander William P. 'Willie' Driscoll, USNR.\n\nIt is probable that future war will be conducted by a special class, the air force, as it was by the armored Knights of the Middle Ages.\n\nBrigadier General William 'Billy' Mitchell, Winged Defense, 1924.\n\nMost healthy young men or women from sixteen to forty years of age can be taught to fly an ordinary airplane. A great majority of these may become very good pilots for transport- or passenger-carrying machines in time of peace; but the requirements for a military aviator call for more concentrated physical and mental ability in the individual than has ever been necessary in any calling heretofore.\n\nBrigadier General William 'Billy' Mitchell, Skyways, 1930.\n\nTheir element is to attack, to track, to hunt, and to destroy the enemy. Only in this way can the eager and skillful fighter pilot display his ability. Tie him to a narrow and confined task, rob him of his initiative, and you take away from him the best and most valuable qualities he posses: aggressive spirit, joy of action, and the passion of the hunter.\n\nGeneral Adolf Galland, Luftwaffe. 104 victories in WWII. The First and the Last, 1954.\n\nAggressiveness was a fundamental to success in air-to-air combat and if you ever caught a fighter pilot in a defensive mood you had him licked before you started shooting.\n\nCaptain David McCampbell, USN. 34 victories in WWII, the most of any US Navy pilot, ever. Quoted at very start of the 2019 biography David McCampbell: Top Ace of U.S. Naval Aviation in World War II.\n\nFly with the head and not with the muscles. That is the way to long life for a fighter pilot. The fighter pilot who is all muscle and no head will never live long enough for a pension.\n\nColonel Wilhelm 'Willie' Batz, Luftwaffe and GAF. 237 victories in WWII. Quoted in the 1985 book Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering.\n\nThe air battle is not necessarily won at the time of the battle. The winner may have been determined by the amount of time, energy, thought and training an individual has previously accomplished in an effort to increase his ability as a fighter pilot.\n\nColonel Gregory 'Pappy' Boyington, USMC, 26 victories, WWII.\n\nThe experienced fighti ng pilot does not take unnecessary risks. His business in to shoot down enemy planes, not to get shot down. His trained hand and eye and judgment are as much a part of his armament as his machine-gun, and a fifty-fifty chance is the worst he will take or should take, except where the show is of the kind that that either for offense or defense justifies the sacrifice of plane and pilot.\n\nCaptain Edward V. 'Eddie' Rickenbacker. The Men Who Cleared the Clouds, Chapter XIX of Supplementary Volume to the Great War History, 1920.\n\nThere was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for oneâs own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind â¦ Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to.\n\nJoseph Heller, First mention of Catch-22 in his novel Catch-22. Heller first started writing it in 1953, but the book wasnât published until 1961.\n\nFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee.\n\nMuhammad Ali (nee Cassius Clay).\n\nA good fighter pilot, like a good boxer, should have a knockout punch â¦ You will find one attack you prefer to all others. Work on it till you can do it to perfection â¦ then use it whenever possible.\n\nCaptain Reade Tilley, USAAF.\n\nHe must have a love of hunting, a great desire to be the top dog.\n\nAttributed to Sergei Dolgushin, Russian Air Force, 24 victories WWII.\n\nKnow and use all the capabilities in your airplane. If you donât, sooner or later, some guy who does use them all will kick your ass.\n\nDave 'Preacher' Pace, USN.

Like the hunter who stalks his prey and maneuvers himself unnoticed into the most favourable position for the kill, the fighter in the opening of a dogfight must detect the opponent as early as possible in order to attain a superior position for the attack.\n\nGeneral Adolf Galland, Luftwaffe. 104 victories in WWII. The First and the Last, 1954.\n\nIf youâre in a fair fight, you didnât plan it properly.\n\nNick Lappos, Chief R&D Pilot, Sikorsky Aircraft.\n\nThe British were sporting. They would accept a fight under almost all conditions.\n\nAttributed to Gunther Rall, Luftwaffe, 275 victories in WWII.\n\nIt's just like being in a knife fight in a dirt-floor bar. If you want to fix a fella, the best way to do it is to get behind him and stick him in the back. It's the same in an air fight. If you want to kill that guy, the best thing to do is get around behind him where he canât see you â¦ . and shoot him.\n\nCaptain William OâBrian, 357th Fighter Group, USAAF. Quoted in the 2017 book Lone Eagle: The Fighter Pilot Experience — From World War I and World War II to the Jet Age.\n\nA squadron commander who sits in his tent and gives orders and does not fly, though he may have the brains of Soloman, will never get the results that a man will, who, day in and day out, leads his patrols over the line and infuses into his pilots the 'espirit de corps.'\n\nBrigadier General William 'Billy' Mitchell, USAS, in a report on the success of Eddie Rickenbacker. Quoted in the 1960 book The Aces.\n\nThe greater issues were beyond us. We sat in a tiny cockpit, throttle lever in one hand, stick in the other. At the end of our right thumb was the firing button, and in each wing were four guns. We aimed through an optical gun sight, a red bead in the middle of a red ring. Our one concern was to boot out the enemy.\n\nGroup Captain Peter Townsend, RAF. Nine victories WWII. Quoted in the 2018 book High Fliers: Airmen of Achievement in Wartime.\n\nVictory smiles upon those who anticipate the change in the character of war, not upon those who wait to adapt themselves after the changes occur.\n\nGiulio Douhet, The Command of the Air, 1921.\n\nI saw the lightnings gleaming rod.\n\nReach forth and write upon the sky\n\nThe awful autograph of God.\n\nJoaquin Miller, The Ship In The Desert, 1875.\n\nThough I Fly Through the Valley of Death I Shall Fear No Evil For I am 80,000 feet and Climbing.\n\nSign over the entrance to the SR-71 operating location on Kadena AB Okinawa.\n\nWe were stripped down, even the turrets were removed. You were light and real fast, though.

'Dick' Newell, Korean War pilot, 12th TAC Reconnaissance Squadron, on flying the reconnaissance version of the B-26.\n\nWe train young men to drop fire on people. But their commanders won't allow them to write “fuck” on their airplanes because? Itâs obscene!\n\nColonel Walter E.

Poem composed two months before he committed ritual suicide on the day after Japanâs surrender. June 1945.\n\nNo guts, no glory. If you are going to shoot him down, you have to get in there and mix it up with him. If heâs damn good, you are immediately going to be confronted with a problem we sincerely hope you will have solved during your training mission.\n\nGeneral Frederick C. 'Boots' Blesse, USAF. Ten victories, Korean War. ACM text No Guts, No Glory, cited by US Navy safety Center in ACM Perspectives, Approach, January 1989.\n\nI donât mind being called tough, because in this racket itâs the tough guys who lead the survivors.\n\nGeneral Curtis LeMay, USAF. Quoted in the 2006 book Aviation Century: War and Peace in the Air.\n\nWatching the Dallas Cowboys perform, it is not difficult to believe that coach Tom Landry flew four-engines bombers during World War II. He was in B-17 Flying Fortresses out of England, they say. His cautious, conservative approach to every situation and the complexity of the plays he sends in do seem to reflect the philosophy of a pilot trained to doggedly press on according to plans laid down before takeoff. I sometimes wonder how the Cowboys would have fared all this years had Tom flown fighters in combat situations which dictated continuously changing tactics.\n\nLen Morgan, View from the Cockpit, 1985.\n\nEverything I had ever learned about air fighting taught me that the man who is aggressive, who pushes a fight, is the pilot who is successful in combat and who has the best opportunity for surviving battle and coming home.\n\nMajor Robert S. Johnson, USAAF. 27 victories in WWII. Thunderbolt!: The Extraordinary Story of a World War II Ace, 1958.\n\nI think that the most important features of a fighter pilot are aggressiveness and professionalism. They are both needed to achieve the fighter pilotâs goal: the highest score within the shortest time, with the least risk to himself and his wingman.\n\nColonel Gidi Livni, Israeli Air Force.\n\nThe aggressive spirit, the offensive, is the chief thing everywhere in war, and the air is no exception.\n\nCaptain Manfred von Richthofen, the 'Red Baron', LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte.\n\nEyesight and seeing the enemy first, or at least in time to take correct tactical maneuvers was very important. However, most important is the guts to plough through an enemy or enemies, and fight it out. There are no foxholes to hide in â¦ there is no surrendering.\n\nRichard H. May, USN. Quoted in the 2001 book Fly Navy: Naval Aviators and Carrier Aviation, a History.\n\nThere are only two types of aircraft â fighters and targets.\n\nMajor Doyle 'Wahoo' Nicholson, USMC.

Westcott, David Harum; A Story of American Life, 1898.\n\nIf I were, to pick out the most valuable personal traits of a fighter pilot, aggressiveness would rate high on the list. Time and again, I have seen aggressive action, even from a disadvantageous position, completely rout a powerful Nip formation.\n\nCharles H. MacDonald, USAAF, 27 victories, WWII, quoted in the 1958 book Five Down and Glory.\n\nThe essence of leadership in the Royal Air Force was, and is, that every leader from flight commander to group commander should know and fly his airplanes.\n\nAir Vice-Marshal J. E. 'Johnnie' Johnson, RAF. Full Circle: The Tactics of Air Fighting 1914-1964, 1964.\n\nA speck of dirt on your windscreen could turn into an enemy fighter in the time it took to look round and back again. A little smear on your goggles might hide the plane that was coming in to kill you.\n\nDerek Robinson, RAF fighter pilot, Piece of Cake, 1983.\n\nThere are pilots and there are pilots; with the good ones, it is inborn. You canât teach it. If you are a fighter pilot, you have to be willing to take risks.\n\nAttributed to General Robin Olds, USAF.\n\nAn excellent weapon and luck had been on my side. To be successful, the best fighter pilot needs both.\n\nGeneral Adolf Galland, Luftwaffe. 104 victories in WWII. The First and the Last, 1954.\n\nOne of the secrets of air fighting was to see the other man first. Seeing airplanes from great distances was a question of experience and training, of knowing where to look and what to look for. Experienced pilots always saw more than the newcomers, because the later were more concerned with flying than fightingâ¦ . The novice had little idea of the situation, because his brain was bewildered by the shock and ferocity of the fight.\n\nAir Vice-Marshal J. E. 'Johnnie' Johnson, RAF.\n\nOnly the spirit of attack borne in a brave heart will bring a success to any fighter aircraft, no matter how highly developed it may be.\n\nGeneral Adolf Galland, Luftwaffe. 104 victories in WWII. The First and the Last, 1954.\n\nThe man who enters combat encased in solid armor plate, but lacking the essential of self-confidence, is far more exposed and naked to death than the individual who subjects himself to battle shorn of any protection but his own skill, his own belief in himself and in his wingman. Righteousness is necessary for oneâs peace of mind, perhaps, but it is a poor substitute for agility â¦ and a resolution to meet the enemy under any conditions and against any odds.\n\nMajor Robert S. Johnson, USAAF.\n\nTo be a good fighter pilot, there is one prime requisite â think fast, and act faster.\n\nMajor John T. Godfrey, USAAF.\n\nMark Twain said, “Courage is the mastery of fear, resistance to fear, not the absence of fear.” At times the nearness of death brings an inexplicable exhilaration which starts the adrenaline flowing and results in instant action. The plane becomes an integral part of the pilotâs body, it is strapped to his butt, and they become a single fighting machine.\n\nRobert M. Littlefield, Double Nickel â Double Trouble, 1993.\n\nBeing a stealth pilot is one of the most labor intensive and time constrained types of flying that I know. We have very strict timing constraints: to be where you are supposed to be all the time, exactly on time, and that has to be monitored by the pilot. For example, during a bomb competition in training in the US, I dropped a weapon that landed 0.02 seconds from the desired time, and finished third!\n\nLt. Col. Miles Pound, USAF\n\nStealth Equals Death.\n\nWhen it absolutely, positively has to be taken out overnight.\n\nThe two phrases stamped on the key ring that every new 'Bandit' (a pilot who has soloed an F-117 Stealth Fighter) received.\n\nOde To The P-38\n\nOh, Hedy Lamarr is a beautiful gal, and Madeleine Carroll is too,\n\nBut youâll find if you query, a different theory amongst any bomber crew\n\nFor the loveliest thing of which one could sing (this side of the pearly gates)\n\nIs no blonde or brunette of the Hollywood set -\n\nBut an escort of P-38s.\n\nYes, in the days that have passed,\n\nwhen the tables were massed with glasses of scotch and champagne,\n\nIt's quite true that the sight was a thing of delight us,\n\nintent on feeling no pain.\n\nBut no longer the same, nowadays is this game\n\nWhen we head north for Messina Straits\n\nTake the sparkling wine-every time,\n\njust make mine an escort of P-38s.\n\nByron, Shelley and Keats ran a dozen dead heats\n\nDescribing the views from the hills,\n\nof the valleys in May when the winds gently sway\n\nIn the air itâs a different story;\n\nWe sweat out our track through the fighters and flak\n\nweâre willing to split up the glory\n\nWell, they wouldnât reject us, so heaven protect us\n\nand, until all this shooting abates,\n\nGive us courage to fight 'em — one other small item -\n\nan escort of P-38s.\n\nFrederic Arnold, Kohn's War.\n\nI didn't turn with the enemy pilots as a rule. I might make one turn — to see what the situation was — but not often. It was too risky.\n\nGeneral John C. Meyer, Vice-Chief of Staff, USAF.\n\nIt is generally inadvisable to eject directly over the area you just bombed.\n\nAttributed to a USAF Manual.\n\nNothing is true in tactics.\n\nCommander Randy 'Duke' Cunningham, USN, first American ace in Vietnam. Quoted in the 1985 book Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering.\n\nWe were too busy fighting to worry about the business of clever tactics.\n\nHarold Balfour, RAF. WWI fighter pilot and later the British Under-Secretary of State for War. Quoted in the 1983 book Fighter Pilot Tactics: The Techniques of Daylight Air Combat.\n\nBeware the lessons of a fighter pilot who would rather fly a slide rule than kick your ass!\n\nAttributed to Commander Ron 'Mugs' McKeown, USN, Two victores in Vietnam. First commanding officer of the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School, and undefeated light-heavyweight boxing champion of the Brigade of Midshipman for three years.\n\nFor most of the time carrier aviation is more challenging than flying in a spacecraft.\n\nAstronaut James Lovell.\n\nFighter pilots, above all else, know who among their peers are hunters and who are hunted. They absolutely will not fly into a tough combat situation with a wingman they donât trust and not all men make the cut. Where we work is a vicious place. I'll attempt to describe it, but the full comprehension comes only in a sky full of hot metal and smart missiles that all seem to be looking at you. You're in a machine that is so fast and powerful that you intuitively know that if death comes, it will be full of hot fire. Frail human that you are, you will be shredded to pieces. Worst of all, you'll be alone in a fierce place where your comrades cannot hold you while you die. That is the real environment of a fighter pilot.\n\nJerry R Caddick\n\nPhysical address, high training, entire fearlessness, iron nerve and fertile resourcefulness are needed in a combination and to a degree hitherto unparalled in war. The ordinary air fighter is an extraordinary man and the extraordinary air fighter stands as one in a million among his fellows.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, letter to Henry Bordeaux, 27 June 1918. The letter was used as the preface in an Engish translation of Mr. Bordeauxâs 1918 book Guynemer: Knight of the Air.\n\nA fighter pilot must be free to propose improvements [in tactics] or he will get himself killed.\n\nCommander Randy 'Duke' Cunningham, USN.\n\nHe who can handle the quickest rate of change survives.\n\nJohn Byrd, last line of his classic USAF document New Conception For Air-To-Air Combat, 4 August 1976.\n\nWhen I took over my wing [in Vietnam], the big talk wasnât about the MIGâs, but about the SAMâs â¦ Iâd seen enemy planes before, but those damn SAMâs were something else. When I saw my first one, there were a few seconds of sheer panic, because thatâs a most impressive sight to see that thing coming at you. You feel like a fish about to be harpooned. Thereâs something terribly personal about the SAM; it means to kill you and Iâll tell you right now, it rearranges your priorities â¦ We had been told to keep our eyes on them and not to take any evasive move too soon, because they were heat-seeking and they, too would correct, so I waited until it was almost on me and then I rolled to the right and it went on by. It was awe inspiring â¦ The truth is you never do get used to the SAMâs; I had about two hundred fifty shot at me and the last one was as inspiring as the first. Sure I got cagey, and I was able to wait longer and longer, but I never got overconfident. I mean, if youâre one or two seconds too slow, youâve had the schnitzel.\n\nGeneral Robin Olds, USAF. Quoted in the 2006 book Aviation Century: War and Peace in the Air\n\nEvery day kill just one, rather than today five, tomorrow ten â¦ that is enough for you. Then your nerves are calm and you can sleep good, you have your drink in the evening and the next morning you are fit again.\n\nColonel Erich 'Bubi' Hartmann, Luftwaffe. Quoted in the 1985 book Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering.\n\nThe closest modern equivalent to the Homeric hero is the ace fighter pilot.\n\nW. H. Auden, Introduction to the Potable Greek Reader, 1948.\n\nTo become an ace a fighter must have extraordinary eyesight, strength, and agility, a huntsmanâs eye, coolness in a pinch, calculated recklessness, a full measure of courageâand occasional luck! .\n\nGeneral Jimmy Doolittle, USAAF. Quoted in 2007 Smithsonian book Extreme Aircraft.\n\nThe most important thing for a fighter pilot is to get his first victory without too much shock.\n\nColonel Werner MÃ¶elders, Luftwaffe. He got his first victory, and 114 others. Quoted as his credo by Hartmann Grasser in the 2007 book Fighter Aces of the Luftwaffe in World War 2.\n\nIt is true to say that the first kill can influence the whole future career of a fighter pilot. Many to whom the first victory over the opponent has been long denied either by unfortunate circumstances or by bad luck can suffer from frustration or develop complexes they may never rid themselves of again.\n\nGeneral Adolf Galland, Luftwaffe. 104 victories in WWII.\n\nIt is wonderful how cheered a pilot becomes after he shoots down his first machine; his morale increases by at least 100 percent.\n\nCaptain James Ira Thomas 'Taffy' Jones, RFC, 37 victories in 3 months of WWI. Quoted in the 1985 book Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering.\n\nI gained in experience with every plane shot down, and now was able to fire in a calm, deliberate manner. Each attack was made in a precise manner. Distance and deflection were carefully judged before firing. This is not something that comes by accident; only by experience can a pilot overcome feelings of panic. A thousand missions could be flown and be of no use if the pilot has not exchanged fire with the enemy.\n\nMajor John T. Godfrey, USAAF.\n\nAs a fighter pilot I know from my own experiences how decisive surprise and luck can be for success, which in the long run comes only to the one who combines daring with cool thinking.\n\nGeneral Adolf Galland, Luftwaffe. 104 victories in WWII. The First and the Last, 1954.\n\nThe most important thing to a fighter pilot is speed; the faster an aircraft is moving when he spots an enemy aircraft, the sooner he will be able to take the bounce and get to the Hun. If you have any advantage on him, keep it and use it. When attacking, plan to overshoot him if possible, hold fire until within range, then shoot and clobber him down to the last instant before breaking away. It's like sneaking up behind someone and hitting them with a baseball bat.\n\nDuane W. Beeson, P-51 pilot, 4th Fighter Group.\n\nMonths of preparation, one of those few opportunities, and the judgment of a split second are what makes some pilot an ace, while others think back on what they could have done.\n\nColonel Gregory 'Pappy' Boyington, USMC. Baa Baa Black Sheep, 1958.\n\nHow this can happen is a mystery to us.\n\nLieutenant-General Ray Henault, Canadaâs Chief of Defence staff, regards the friendly fire deaths of four Canadian soldiers by a USAF F-16 in Afghanistan, 18 April 2002.\n\nSuccess flourishes only in perseverance â ceaseless, restless perseverance.\n\nCaptain Manfred von Richthofen, the 'Red Baron', LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte. Quoted in 1962 book Fighter Pilot.\n\nIf he is superior then I would go home, for another day that is better.\n\nColonel Erich 'Bubi' Hartmann, Luftwaffe.\n\nIf I should come out of this war alive, I will have more luck than brains.\n\nCaptain Manfred von Richthofen, the 'Red Baron', LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte. 1914 letter to his mother upon being decorated with the Iron Cross. Quoted in the 1927 book The Red Knight of Germany.\n\nI was struck by the joy of those pilots in committing cold-blooded murder â¦ Frankly, this is not cojones. This is cowardice.\n\nMadeleine Albright, US Ambassador to the UN, 1996, regards Cuban fighters shooting down unarmed American Cessnas. Quoted in Los Angeles Times newspaper, 28 february 1996.\n\nThereâs something wonderfully exciting about the quiet sing song of an aeroplane overhead with all the guns in creation lighting out at it, and searchlights feeling their way across the sky like antennae, and the earth shaking snort of the bombs and the whimper of shrapnel pieces when they come down to patter on the roof.\n\nJohn Dos Passos, letter written in Bossano, Italy while serving in the American Red Cross Ambulance Service to his friend Rumsey Marvin. 18 February 1918.\n\nIt was no picnic despite what anyone might say later â¦ . Most of us were pretty scared all the bloody time; you only felt happy when the battle was over and you were on your way home, then you were safe for a bit, anyway.\n\nGroup Captain Colin Gray, RAF, 27 victories WWII. Quoted in the 1989 book Their Finest Hour: The Battle of Britain Remembered.\n\nThere is no question about the hereafter of men who give themselves in such a cause. If I am called upon to make it, I shall go with a grin of satisfaction and a smile.\n\nLieutenant David Endicott Putnam, Americaâs first ‘Ace of Acesâ, in a letter to his mother, 12 September 1918.\n\nWonât it be nice when all this beastly killing is over, and we can enjoy ourselves and not hurt anyone? I hate this game.\n\nCaptain Albert Ball, RFC, 44 victories in WWI. Ball was the first British ace idolized by the public. Letters to his father and fiancÃ©e, 6 May 1917.\n\nAfter a scrap I usually drink my tea through a straw.\n\nDerek Robinson, RAF fighter pilot, Piece of Cake, 1983.\n\nFor me flying is the greatest of all sports The heavens were the grandstands and only the gods were spectators â¦ The stake was the world, the forfeit was the playerâs place at the table, and the game had no recess. It was freeze-out and not even the sky was the limit. Imagine men stalking each other through the clouds day after day! Imagine children of seventeen matching their skill with nerveless veterans who fought on begging for death because they could not check the speed of their lives!\n\nIt was the most dangerous of all sports and the most fascinating. It got in the blood like wine. It aged men forty years in forty days. It ruined nervous systems forever in an hour. Men came out of the trenches after three years of hell and became pilots. After their first fight in the air they felt the same grip on their hearts as the downy-faced youngsters facing their first adversary.\n\nNo words can describe the thrill of hiding in the clouds, waiting on human prey.\n\nElliott White Springs, 13 victories WWI. Vertical Sport, US Air Services, June 1928.\n\nIt is as though horror has frozen the blood in my veins, paralyzed my arms, and torn all thought from my brain with the swipe of a paw. I sit there, flying on, and continue to stare, as though mesmerised, at the Cauldron on my left.\n\nErnst Udet, My life as Aviator, 1935.\n\nIâm not allowed to saw how many planes joined the raid, but I counted them all out and I counted them all back.\n\nBrian Hanranan, carefully worded broadcast from HMS Hermes, in the Falklands Islands region, regards the number of British aeroplanes involved in (and potentially lost in) the raid on Port Stanley. BBC news, 1 May 1982.\n\nI suppose Iâm as good as the next guy, but that's about all. Only reason Iâm still flying while a lot of other great guys are gone is because Iâve had the breaks so far. I believe though, that the breaks are going to continue my way. The minute a flyer gets the notion that his number is up, he's finished. I start out, and know Iâm coming back, and that's all there is to it.\n\nFear? You bet your life. But it's always on the way up. Then you get to thinking about a lot of things, but that all leaves you as you reach combat. Then there's a sense of great excitement, a thrill you can't duplicate anywhere. Then there can be no fear, no thought of life or death, no dream of yesterday or tomorrow.\n\nWhat you have at that moment is â well, it may sound strange, but it's actually fun. The other guy has his chance, too, and youâve got to get him before he gets you. Yes, I think it is the most exciting fun in the world.\n\nLt. Col. Robert B. 'Westy' Westbrook, USAAF, one of the leading aces of the Pacific, quoted in the Los Angeles Examiner newspaper, 20 June 1944.\n\nIt got more exciting with each war. I mean the planes were going faster than hell when I was flying a Mustang, but by the time I got to Nam, it scared the piss out of a lot of guys just to fly the damn jets at full speed. Let alone do it in combat.\n\nAttributed to Brigadier General Robin Olds, USAF.\n\nHe who has the height controls the battle.\n\nHe who has the sun achieves surprise.\n\nHe who gets in close shoots them down.\n\nanon.\n\nMannockâs Rules on Air Combat\n\nAlways Above, seldom on the same level; never underneath.\n\nPilots must dive to attack with zest, and must hold their fire until they get within one hundred yards of the target.\n\nAchieve surprise by approaching from the East (From the German side of the front.)\n\nUtilize the sunâs glare and clouds to achieve surprise.\n\nPilots must keep physically fit by exercise and the moderate use of stimulants.\n\nPilots must sight their guns and practice as much as possible as targets are normally fleeting.\n\nPilots must practice spotting machines in the air and recognizing them at long range, and every aeroplane is to be treated as an enemy until it is certain it is not.\n\nPilots must learn where the enemyâs blind spots are.\n\nScouts must attacked from above and two-seaters from beneath their tails to take advantage of hte observerâs blindspot.\n\nPilots must practice quick turns, as this manoeuvre is used more than any other in a fight.\n\nFormation flying at 25 yards must be practised.\n\nPilots must practice judging distances in the air as these are very deceptive.\n\nDecoys must be guarded against — a single enemy is often a decoy — therefore the air above should be searched before attacking.\n\nIf the day is sunny, machines should be turned with as little bank as possible; otherwise the sun glistening on the wings will give away their presence at a long range.\n\nPilots must keep turning in a dogfight and never fly straight except when firing.\n\nPilots must never, under any circumstances, dive away from an enemy, as he gives his opponent a non-deflection shot — bullets are faster than aeroplanes.\n\nPilots must keep an eye on their watches during patrols, and on the direction and strength of the wind.\n\nFlight commander Edward 'Mick' Mannock, RFC and RAF. 61 victories WWI. Mannock was a pioneer of fighter aircraft tactics in aerial warfare, these rules were first issued to the pilots under his command in June 1917.\n\nThere are several versions of the 15 rules published, with slightly differing language. This version is from âAlways Aboveâ: Major Edward 'Mick' Mannock in World War I, published in the journal of the Air Force Historical Foundation, Air Power History, Vol. 53, No. 1, Spring 2006, pp. 28-43.\n\nDicta Boelcke\n\nTry to secure advantages before attacking. If possible, keep the sun behind you.\n\nAlways carry through an attack when you have started it.\n\nFire only at close range, and only when your opponent is properly in your sights.\n\nAlways keep your eye on your opponent, and never let yourself be deceived by ruses.\n\nIn any form of attack it is essential to assail your opponent from behind.\n\nIf your opponent dives on you, do not try to evade his onslaught, but fly to meet it.\n\nWhen over the enemy's lines never forget your own line of retreat.\n\nFor the Staffel: attack on principle in groups of four or six. When the fight breaks up into a series of single combats, take care that several do not go for one opponent.\n\nHauptmann Oswald Boelcke, LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte, written in early October 1916. According to Boelckeâs first biographer, Professor Johannes von Werner, the eight dicta were written for Colonel Hermann von der Lieth-Thomsen.\n\nWhatever Boelcke told us was taken as Gospel!\n\nCaptain Manfred von Richthofen, the 'Red Baron', LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte.\n\nI will be like Boelcke.\n\nGerman pilotsâ motto, WWI.\n\nTen of My Rules for Air Fighting\n\nWait until you see the whites of his eyes.\n\nFire short bursts of 1 to 2 seconds and only when your sights are definitely 'ON.'\n\nWhilst shooting think of nothing else; brace the whole of the body; have both hands on the stick; concentrate on your ring sight.\n\nAlways keep a sharp lookout. “Keep your finger out\"!\n\nHeight gives you the initiative.\n\nAlways turn and face the attack.\n\nMake your decisions promptly. It is better to act quickly even though your tactics are not the best.\n\nNever fly straight and level for more than 30 seconds in the combat area.\n\nWhen diving to attack always leave a proportion of your formation above to act as top guard.\n\nINITIATIVE, AGGRESSION, AIR DISCIPLINE, and TEAM WORK are words that MEAN something in Air Fighting.\n\nGo in quickly — Punch Hard — Get out!\n\nFlight Lieutenant Adolphus G. 'Sailor' Malan, RSAAF, commander of No. 74 Squadron RAF, August 1941. These rules were printed on a small poster, and found in nearly every RAF orderly room by the end of the war.\n\nNavy Aviators live on the line between bravery and stupidity, science and idiocy. One day youâre planning a complicated twenty-eight-jet air strike over Afghanistan, the next your buddies are urging you to take a shit on a Dubai boulevard after your tenth Jack Daniels. It has always been that way, fly hard, get drunk, and chase skirtâ¦ . naval aviators had the capacity to instantly toggle between the heroic and the moronic.\n\nStephen Rodrick, The Magical Stranger, published May 2013.\n\nBecause operators are based thousands of miles away from the battlefield, and undertake operations entirely through computer screens and remote audio-feed, there is a risk of developing a ‘PlayStationâ mentality to killing.\n\nPhilip Alston, United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, regards drone pilots. In a report to the UN Human Rights Council, 2 June 2010.\n\nThere are no words with which I can do justice to the aircrew who fought under my command. There is no parallel in warfare to such courage and determinaiton in the face of danger over so prolonged a period, of danger which at times was so great that scarcely one man in three could expect to survice his tour of thirty operations â¦ It was, moreover, a clear and highly conscious courage, by which the risk was taken with calm forethought, for their aircrew were all highly skilled men, much above the average in education, who had to understand every aspect and detail of their task. It was, furthermore, the courage of the small hours, of men virtually alone, for at his battle station the airman is virtually alone. It was the courage of men with long-drawn apprehensions of daily âgoing over the topâ.\n\nAir Marshal Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, RAF, tribute to WWII bomber crews, crediting their lonely courage and ending by invoking the language of WWI, Bomber Offensive, 1947."
