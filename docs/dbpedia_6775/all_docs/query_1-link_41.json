        "text": "Lt. Col. Paul Gravely took command of Maneuver Training Center Fort Pickett from Col. Preston Scott, Jr., Feb. 3, 2018, at Fort Pickett, Virginia. Brig. Gen. Walter Mercer, Virginia National Guard Assistant Adjutant General – Army, presided over the exchange of organizational colors that represented the change of garrison command from Scott to Gravely.\n\n“Both of these officers are solid leaders and will continue to contribute to our national security as senior leaders for years to come,” Mercer said. “You can rest assured that the leadership of the MTC is passing from one excellent leader to another.”\n\nMercer described Scott as “the right leader at the right time” to lead the efforts at MTC for a number of significant milestones including setting the conditions to get the State Department to establish the Foreign Affairs Security Training Center at Fort Pickett, growing support for the Morale, Welfare and Recreation program and focusing on process improvements to make Fort Pickett more efficient.\n\n“I know that your leadership and your ability to problem solve, listen and communicate at the strategic level have been the key reasons for our great success,” Mercer said about Scott.”You have shown a level of professionalism and strong leadership that has made the senior leaders of the state proud, and you have also clearly earned the trust and respect of your Soldiers and leaders.”\n\nScott will succeed Col. Kerry Dull as the chief of staff of the Fort Belvoir-based 29th Infantry Division.\n\nMercer pointed out some specific significant accomplishments during Scott’s time in command including supporting an average of 110,000 service members averaging over 400,000 “mandays” of training annually, establishing a joint use agreement for the Blackstone Army Air Field which directly contributed to a 400% increase in investments over the last four years and establishing three new dining facilities, a medical readiness flight physical facility, a new post headquarters and completing renovation of numerous World War II-era barracks to bring the modernization to 50% completion.\n\nHe also commended Scott for the work done to incorporate a master storm water management plan into the Fort Pickett Master Plan which will significantly contribute to outstanding environmental compliance history at Fort Pickett and will provide cost savings in all future installation construction efforts, as well as completing a multi-year fiber optic installation plan that will greatly enhance the ability for units to stay connected to necessary data systems to aid and document training.\n\n“It has been a pleasure to serve as the 50th garrison commander at Fort Pickett,” Scott said. “Words cannot express the pride I have in this Maneuver Training Center team. These years that I have been allowed to lead this organization have been some of the best in my military career. This team provides the highest quality support even when asked to do it with limited resources.”\n\nGravely is no stranger to the operation of MTC, having served as the director of plans, training and security since 2001.\n\n“Lt. Col. Gravely comes into this command with a diverse resume which includes an impressive amount of deployed time and command and operational experience,” Mercer said. “He understands the MTC mission set, the unique needs of this installation, and what it will take to continue to improve on what Col. Scott has done here. He is a strong leader, a quiet man of character and Soldier-focused leader. I trust him completely and look forward to seeing great things happen with MTC under his leadership.”\n\nGravely said his goals are to continue renovations on the installation, enhance training opportunities for units who visit the installation, emphasize the Army Compatible Use Buffer and continue developing the important relationships with the Town of Blackstone, Nottoway County, Dinwiddie County and the Department of State.\n\n“We are fortunate to have great support from our surrounding localities, and those important relationships are something I hope to continue to build,” Gravely said. “Many of the state employees who keep MTC running are from this area, and we count on their skills and strong work ethic to provide the best resources possible for units who come here to train.”\n\nGravely resides in Dinwiddie County with his wife and son.\n\nMercer, Scott and Gravely all thanked the families of both the outgoing and incoming commander for their sacrifice and support.\n\n“None of us could meet the demands of being senior leaders in the National Guard without the support and sacrifice of our families that allows us to do what we do,” Mercer said.\n\nThe Troutville-based 29th Division Band provided music for the ceremony.\n\nMaj. Gen. Timothy Williams, the Adjutant General of Virginia, announced Gravely as the new commander Dec. 13, 2017.\n\n“Please join me in congratulating this exceptional officer on his new command,” Williams wrote in the announcement. “Lt. Col. Gravely has completed a successful assignment as the plans, training and mobilization manager at the Maneuver Training Center. I have no doubt he will continue to serve with distinction in his new assignment.”\n\n“Col. Scott leaves a legacy of leadership and selfless service to the Virginia Army National Guard and its regional partners who train at MTC,” Williams wrote. “We thank him for his many contributions to the Virginia National Guard and are confident he will excel in his new assignment.”\n\nFort Pickett is comprised of approximately 41,000 acres and is operated by the Virginia National Guard. It features a combination of open and wooded terrain maneuver areas and 21 ranges capable of supporting almost any weapons system in the U. S. Army inventory. In addition, the installation has a rail spur and C-17 capable airfield as well as barracks to support more than 5,000 personnel. Morale, welfare and recreation facilities include a gym, post exchange and leisure center.\n\nBiographies for Col. Scott and Lt. Col.
