        "text": "Chapter 1043: Channing Lestrange of the Northern Army, a Savage Man\n\nрʟease reading on ΒʘXΝOVEL.ϹΟM\n\nTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation\n\nNone of the martial artists present were fools. They could vaguely tell that Maddox Johnstone had not stepped onto the arena to kill Keon Woodard for the ranking of the Martial Artist Summit, much less for a few points.\n\nHe wanted Keon’s life!\n\nIt started when Scorpio Woodard killed Farron Sampson from the Northern Military School in the arena.\n\nAll the Woodard family martial artists were on the killing list of the Northern Army.\n\nAfter the battle in the fifth arena was over.\n\nIn the ninth arena.\n\nThat was the arena that belonged to the middle-aged martial artists.\n\nArena No. 8 and Arena No. 9 were prepared for the pinnacles.\n\nThose who ascended the stage were all pinnacles.\n\nThere was only one condition to register for the middle-aged group, and that was that one must not be over a hundred years old.\n\nThey were less than a hundred years old, but they had already reached the pinnacle realm.\n\nThat represented a kind of potential.\n\nIn the future, they would be able to advance to a higher realm.\n\nAt this moment, a middle-aged martial artist standing on the ninth ring had just defeated his opponent. He had paid a considerable price.\n\nThe competition of pinnacles also used a point system.\n\nThe number of powerful martial artists was the highest!\n\nThere were no weaklings in the middle-aged group, and it was even more impossible for them to collect points.\n\nFor every point they obtained, they had to experience a fierce battle.\n\nThe summit had been going for two days, yet the person with the highest points in the middle-aged group only had five points.\n\nCompared to the youth group and even the junior youth group, this score was indeed unbearable to watch.\n\nHowever, it was undeniable that the middle-aged group had the strongest battles so far.\n\nThe middle-aged martial artist standing in the ninth ring was called Zephir Woodard. He had just experienced a bloody battle and was about to go down to rest.\n\nHowever, a drunken young Daoist priest challenged the ninth ring.\n\nThe young Daoist priest was dressed in a Daoist robe. He was holding half a bottle of wine in his hand. He lazily stretched and stepped onto the arena. He said softly, “Living in someone’s courtyard and drinking someone’s sweet dew, you have to do something for them. Otherwise, this wine won’t be to your liking.”\n\nAnyone could understand his words.\n\nThis drunk idiot was here to find trouble.\n\nThe judge on the ninth ring was from the capital. He came from the depths of the palace and was often by Martial Emperor Yanagi’s side. Even Dominic Lowe had to give him some face when he saw him.\n\n“The drunk and nameless are not allowed to enter the arena,” the internal judge said with a frown.\n\n“Nameless and drunk? I’m Channing Lestrange, I have a name, how can you say that I’m nameless!”\n\nChanning tilted his head and glanced at the internal judge.\n\nIt was just a look.\n\nAn invisible pressure and an inexplicable power descended.\n\nBang!\n\nThe internal judge was sent flying as if he had been attacked by an air cannon.\n\nEveryone was shocked.\n\nAlmost everyone was dumbfounded.\n\nBeating up the referee in public!\n\nWhose family did this idiot belong to?\n\nHe had gone too far!\n\nThere was no lack of big shots in the audience. They stood up in anger and said, “How dare you!”\n\n“It’s fine. I have only cultivated my heart, not my body. I’ve been plagued by all sorts of killing sins in the world. So what? If anyone here isn’t happy with me, feel free to come up and fight!”\n\nThe Daoist Channing was extremely fierce after drinking.\n\nHe was a completely different person!\n\nPerhaps this was how alcohol boosted one’s courage.\n\nMoreover, Channing was not a coward.\n\nHe was a ruthless person!\n\nChanning changed the topic. He glanced at the middle-aged pinnacle on the stage and said with a faint smile, “In the meantime, allow me to finish off this opponent.”\n\n“Channing, anyone who goes up the stage must report their name and origin!”\n\nOn the high platform, Braydon Neal stood with his hands behind his back. His indifferent words resounded throughout the venue.\n\nThe moment Braydon opened his mouth, the hearts of many people present jumped.\n\nDominic was hiding in the crowd. He touched his chin and said, “Is this guy from the Northern Army?”\n\n“Looking at how he’s acting, he might really be from the Northern Army!”\n\nThe old man sitting next to Dominic analyzed.\n\nAs expected.\n\nChanning turned to Braydon on the high platform. He nodded slightly and put down the wine bottle. He looked at Zephir and said softly, “Channing Lestrange of the Northern Army, supreme pinnacle!”\n\nThe entire place was silent.\n\nThen, there was an uproar.\n\nThe venue was in an uproar.\n\n“What the f*ck?” Dominic was dumbfounded.\n\n“Did you guys hear the two words that kid said just now?”\n\n“Of course, I heard him. He called himself a supreme pinnacle!”\n\n“F*ck, when did the Northern Army nurture a supreme pinnacle!”\n\n“This is bad. The Woodard family is really courting death. They killed the Northern Army’s man in public. Just now, Commander Neal was so enraged that he personally went up on stage to kill Scorpio.”\n\n“Now, even a supreme pinnacle has appeared!”\n\n“It seems that none of the Woodard family’s martial artists will survive this Martial Artist Summit. Whether it’s the junior youth group, the youth group, or even the middle-aged group, as long as the Woodard family’s martial artists go on stage, they will be killed by the soldiers of the Northern Army!”\n\nAlmost all the martial artists in the venue were shocked.\n\nA young man who was a supreme pinnacle.\n\nIt was terrifying!\n\nZephir’s face was pale. He was a high-level pinnacle who had lived for nearly a hundred years. He had only heard of the reputation of supreme pinnacles. He had never even seen one before.\n\nNow, he had seen it with his own eyes.\n\nHowever, this supreme pinnacle was his opponent.\n\n“I…” Zephir said in horror.\n\n“According to the rules of the summit, those who ascend the arena cannot refuse to fight!” Channing, a little drunkard, was actually seriously explaining the rules to Zephir.\n\nThe internal judge was not injured, and he did not dare to stop Channing.\n\nWhat a joke. Who would dare to stop a supreme pinnacle?\n\nA supreme pinnacle was of the highest level of rankings.\n\nNow that the golden age had arrived, there were many pinnacles, but how many of them were truly exposed to the public?\n\nIf one appeared, he would receive the country’s greatest welcome!\n\nWhat Braydon said earlier was true. The Martial Artist Summit this time would probably be even more intense than the Global Martial Artist Summit.\n\nIt was because of the geniuses who were sealed in ice a thousand years ago.\n\nThey would all be reborn in this era!\n\nWhat did this mean?\n\nIt meant that in the martial arts world of Hansworth, the geniuses that had been frozen in every era would be reborn in this era.\n\nIt represented a thousand years of accumulation!\n\nThis is the foundation of Hansworth.\n\nIt was extremely terrifying.\n\nThe ice-sealed geniuses were released by the old hermits, who were cultivating in seclusion.\n\nIt was probably not just because the golden age was about to arrive.\n\nThe most important reason was that the hundreds of foreign countries wanted to encroach on Hansworth territory. They had even formulated a hunting plan to kill these rising elites.\n\nHundreds of countries outside the borders had joined forces to slaughter the people of Hansworth.\n\nThere was no doubt that the plan was to destroy the country and endanger Hansworth.\n\nHow would the old hermits be able to sit still if they knew about this?\n\nNo matter how big a commotion there was in the outside world, as long as Hansworth could continue to prosper, the living fossils in seclusion wouldn’t ask about the outside world.\n\nHowever, if there was someone who wanted to shake the foundation of Hansworth…\n\nThis would be the bottom line!\n\nTherefore, Channing and the other monsters were awakened from their frozen state and released into the world.\n\nAt this moment, the internal judge did not dare to interfere with the matters in the arena."
