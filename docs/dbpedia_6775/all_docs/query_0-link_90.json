        "text": "The attack group of the Navy's Cavour aircraft carrier, engaged in recent months in an operational campaign in the Indo-Pacific, is located in Guam, where it is planning interactions with units of other allied and partner navies in the same area. Starting today, in particular, the Cavour will meet the Carrier Strike Group 3 of the United States Navy, which is based on the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln.\n\nCavour and its attack group are veterans of the multinational exercise Pitch Black, which ended on August 2 in Australia, and in which around 140 aircraft and almost 4.500 soldiers from 20 countries took part. In the next few days, the attack group and the aero-tactical component of the Navy on board the Cavour, composed of F-35B fighter-bombers and AV8B+ Harrier ground attack aircraft, will head towards Yokosuka, Japan.\n\nRead also other news on Nova News\n\nClick here and receive updates on WhatsApp"
