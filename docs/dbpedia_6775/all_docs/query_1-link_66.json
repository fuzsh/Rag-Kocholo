        "text": "Simmering tensions in the Middle East are on the verge of exploding into a full-fledged regional war, which many fear could begin, with the imminent Iran-led multi-pronged attack on Israel – expected in mid-August.\n\nAs the global diplomatic community races against time to avert such a scenario, many wonder how Israel – a tiny nation – would defend itself from the combined wrath of Iran and its regional sub-state militias as the “Axis of Resistance” if the unwanted does happen. In this article, India Today’s Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) team tries to provide a big picture of the power structure in the region.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIMMINENT ATTACK\n\nIsrael and its largest ally, the United States are gearing up for a large-scale attack following a string of high-profile killings of Axis leaders, with the most prominent being Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Faud Shukr less than 10 days ago.\n\nTensions in the region have been high since the deadly October 7 Hamas attack on Israel last year but spiralled up dangerously after Israel allegedly carried out ambitious operations in Tehran and Beirut following a rocket strike that killed 12 young men in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27.\n\nIn April, Iran fired more than 330 drones and missiles toward Iran in response to an Israeli attack on its consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus that killed 13 people. Iranian state media has suggested that the upcoming attack would be similar to but greater than the April assault.\n\nPOSSIBLE ATTACK SCENARIO\n\nAs D-day nears, analysts suggest three approaches Iran may adopt to deal a blow that deters the Israelis but not as severe as to invite direct US involvement.\n\nScenario 1: More missiles & drones from different sides – The foremost challenge facing the Iranians is the difficulty of bypassing Israel’s robust missile defence systems. Out of over 300 projectiles sent in April, only a few fell in the Israeli territory. The rest were intercepted and eliminated before they reached its airspace.\n\nAnalysts at the Institute of the Study of War, a US-based think tank believe that Iran would not just fire projectiles from its territory but ask regional proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq to launch simultaneous attacks to overwhelm the air defences of Israel and the US. Drones and missiles fired from Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria would be much harder to intercept than those launched from Iran due to shorter distances and flight times to Israel. It would give US and Israeli forces significantly less time to respond.\n\nAs per assessments, it would take Hezbollah drones around 15 minutes to reach Haifa and around 40 minutes flying on direct paths to reach Tel Aviv.\n\nScenario 2: Simultaneous attacks on US forces - Experts fear that Iran Axis forces in Syria and Iraq could simultaneously attack US forces, especially in northern Syria. Recent reports in Syrian media talked of the arrival of Yemen’s Houthis in Syria from Iraq and their commission to different positions across eastern and southern Syria.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSuch a strategy will pull American attention and resources away from identifying and intercepting projectiles bound for Israel, making projectiles more likely to penetrate Israeli air defences.\n\nScenario 3: Multi-day attack - Iran and its allies could conduct waves of drone and missile attacks over several days, enabling Iran and its proxies to learn and adjust their attacks as they observe how successful each volley is.\n\nThere are also talks of targeted killings of Israeli figures in Iranian media. On August 4, Iranian armed forces-run Defa Press called on the Axis of Resistance to target “prominent” Israeli leaders in retaliation for Haniyeh’s killing – which has been blamed on Israel.\n\nNonetheless, it would be difficult for Iran and its proxies to hand over any real damage to Israel, given the massive American firepower and troops presence in the Middle East region.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs per The Intercept, the US has more than 60 bases, garrisons, or shared foreign facilities in the region – from small combat outposts to massive air bases in countries like Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn June last year, the US Department of Defence put its troop numbers in the Middle East at more than 30,000. It is believed to have increased since, given the presence of a carrier strike group and an amphibious ready group – together hosting more than 12,000 sailors and marines not to mention many other sophisticated warships sailing in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman and the Mediterranian.\n\nEarlier this week, the US ordered the deployment of an additional fighter squadron to the Middle East to bolster defensive air support capability in addition to ballistic missile defence-capable cruisers and destroyers.\n\nTune In"
