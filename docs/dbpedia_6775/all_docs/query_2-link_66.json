        "text": "SEOUL, Republic of Korea —The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Far East District and members of the U.S. Air Force 8th Fighter Wing “Wolf Pack” cut the ribbon on two phases of a new maintenance complex at Kunsan Air Base Nov. 9.\n\nThe new fabrication shop (phase 1) and armament shop (phase 3) will give Airmen about 58,000 square ft. of space for maintenance and repair of aircraft. The accessory shop (phase 2) will be complete by summer 2012.\n\nThis project consolidates three sections and three buildings into one combined facility with close proximity to the flight line. This reduces response time to aircraft “red ball” maintenance discrepancies. “Red ball” maintenance is a situation that requires urgent action.\n\n“This is a great day for all of us, but especially for the maintainers,” said Sam Adkins, Chief of FED Construction Division. “This project gives them the latest and best facilities in order to keep the ‘Wolf Pack’ mission ready.”\n\nThe fabrication shop includes structural sheet metal, aircraft metals technology, non-destructive inspection, and survival equipment shops. The temperature and humidity controlled building will give a more stable environment for processing petroleum products and other chemicals. It also includes a state-of-the-art paint booth and sanding room for turning parts from cradle to grave.\n\nThe armament shop includes mission equipment storage area, increased tool storage, aircraft weapon maintenance, administration offices, classroom, training room, and parts room. The new location places the armament shop closer to the aircraft maintenance units, decreasing flight line response and mission equipment dispersal times. Hazardous materials are now kept in the support section increasing work area safety.\n\nBoth facilities have air conditioning and heating capabilities which offers technicians a comfortable work environment. These facilities also provide more space and better lighting, increasing productivity and morale.\n\n“I want to thank all those involved for making this project successful,” said Adkins. “As with everything we do, this project required great team effort.”\n\nThe contractor, Poong Chang Construction Co., Ltd. will also demolish the former maintenance facilities constructed in 1974."
