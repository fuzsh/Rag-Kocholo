        "text": "Welcome to the Pack!\n\nBefore Arrival\n\n1. Contact your sponsor\n\nNo matter how many times you've PCS'd or even if you've been assigned to Kunsan before, you need to make contact with your sponsor to make sure you're aware of the latest in-processing policies and requirements BEFORE you arrive.\n\nYour sponsor is the key to your successful PCS and should be your first stop for information concerning travel to Kunsan AB. They also have information on local transportation modes that can save you valuable time and hassle upon arrival.\n\nSponsorship Due to a recent change from the Korean government, Vonage is no longer accessible in Korea but Magic Jack is. All services must be used through LG Daecom at Kunsan AB. We recommend you ask for a sponsor at least 90 days before you depart your present assignment. Kunsan AB has group Command Support Staffs so you might need to contact one of the following: 8MSG/CSS, 8MXG/CSS, 8OG/CSS or 8MDG/CSS which can be found in the global. If you belong to a Detachment, AFN, Army or 8th FW tenant unit please search the Kunsan AB global for the appropriate agency and contact them via email.\n\nAdditionally, you can contact the INTRO monitor Airman and Family Readiness Center at your current base for assistance. The INTRO program manager will help you obtain a sponsor. Once you receive your orders, forward a copy to your sponsor. If you are unable to contact your sponsor, contact the group command support staff at your gaining unit or your local Airman and Family Readiness Center.\n\nAll personnel who PCS to Kunsan will arrive at Incheon International Airport (ICN) located about 25 miles west of Seoul, Korea or Via Patriot Express directly into Kunsan AB.\n\nFor those arriving ICN you will go through Immigrations and then Customs. Due to the mission at Kunsan, sponsors may not be able to meet incoming personnel at Incheon. After exiting the secure area turn RIGHT and walk to the end of the Air Terminal. The last area on the LEFT (Near gate 14A) is a U.S. Military Reception Center with military personnel in uniform waiting to assist you with any questions you have. Check with them on the bus schedule and catch the next bus to Kunsan Air Base. DO NOT TAKE A TAXI FROM INCHEON TO KUNSAN! (YOU WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED FOR IT ON YOUR TRAVEL VOUCHER)! Once you arrive at Kunsan your sponsor should meet you and take you to the Billeting Office. If at this point you still have not been assigned a sponsor call DSN 315-782-6000 for the Command Post to locate someone from your unit to assist you.\n\nDue to the unique mission at Kunsan AB newcomers often arrive only to find their sponsor is on their Mid-tour leave. To ensure you have someone to meet you and show you around please make every effort to contact your group's Command Support Staff (CSS) and flight chief to let them know when you are arriving. If you have had limited contact with your sponsor or have not received your sponsor please locate a contact number for your gaining unit or call 315-782-1110 (base operator) to be connected to your assigned squadron.\n\nIf you do not have a mail box your mailing address will be as follows: Rank, Name, PSC 2 Box 5000, APO AP 96264. It is advisable for you to contact someone from your unit if you have not been assigned a sponsor to ensure you receive as much assistance as possible before you arrive.\n\nYour sponsor is there to assist you in getting settled here in Korea.\n\nUpon arrival to Korea, they should arrange for your transportation as well as work with you all the way through your in-processing timeline.\n\nWithin your first week of arrival, military members will be required to attend two days of in-processing. Whether coming in on the Patriot Express or Commercial flight from ICN.\n\nUse this site as your one-stop shopping for all the information you need to fully prepare you for PCSing to Kunsan AB, Republic of Korea (ROK).\n\nGood luck and welcome to the Wolf Pack!\n\n2. Set Up P.O Box\n\nMail or fax a copy of your orders to your sponsor and they will take it to the post office to set up a P.O. Box for you.\n\nYou can use the P.O. Box to start forwarding your mail, especially items like magazines that need up to several weeks lead time for an address change.\n\nIf you are sending any packages in advance of your arrival, be sure to keep in mind the following mailing tips:\n\nAddresses/customs forms clearly written: Ensure mailing addresses are clearly written on the box with the return address on the upper left-hand corner. Use proper names in the \"to\" and \"from\" lines to make sure the mail gets to its destination on time. Customs forms must list everything contained in the package and cannot have generic terms like \"gift\" or \"present.\"\n\nCheck your mail regularly: Check your mail on a regular basis (every two to three days), or more if expecting packages. After 15 days of sitting on our shelf, they will be r eturned to sender. If you ship your items too early it may be returned before you have a chance to pick it up.\n\nHow to prevent returned mail: To prevent your package from being \"returned to sender,\" contact customer service and put your box on hold if you are going TDY or taking leave for more than 15 days. You may also allow someone else to check your mail by filling out the required paperwork at customer service. Otherwise, mail will be returned.\n\nMailing restrictions: Do not abuse your military postal system privileges. Various items like alcohol, flammable items, etc., are not authorized for shipping and can't go through the MPS. Find out what you can and cannot send by checking the guidance posted around the Post Office before buying and packaging it. Customs will find unauthorized items and you will be prosecuted and lose your MPO privileges.\n\nShipping before arrival: Please note issues surrounding sending items here in advance. Specifically, priority mail or better gets packages here with 10-14 day, but standard postage, FEDEX, DHL, etc. will be sent Space-A once it gets to the APO.\n\nShipping before arrival: Please notify the post office, DSN 782-5514, and\n\nyour sponsor of items being sent prior to your arrival as a precautionary to\n\nprevent items being returned.\n\n3. Temporary Lodging\n\nTemporary Lodging Arrangements\n\nWolf Pack Lodge\n\nPhone: DSN 782-1844 or Comm 063-470-1844\n\nHours: Daily 24/7\n\nBuilt in 2010, Wolf Pack Lodge provides rooms.

Call us to make your reservation today.\n\n4. Pre-Arrival Housing Information\n\nPlease contact your sponsor, they will arrange housing for you prior to your arrival to Kunsan AB. For more information, please visit Upon Arrival, Housing.\n\n5. POV Shipping\n\nOnly E-7s and above are entitled to ship one POV regardless of the type of tour. Personnel contemplating shipment of a two-wheeled motorized vehicle, including mopeds, should contact their gaining unit regarding operation/registration procedures. Unleaded fuel is available on-base.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved testing of catalytic systems on POVs operating in Korea. This eliminates the requirement to remove catalytic converters from POVs. Under the DOD POV Import Control Program, the removal of catalytic converters is voluntary. If catalytic converters are not removed, unleaded fuel must be used. All POV's have to be registered through the Korean authorities.\n\nIn order for any USFK service members in the grades of E-6 and below to be eligible to be issued, or re-issued a POV operator's license, authorization is required from their squadron commander.\n\nThe legal status of U.S. Forces personnel in Korea is determined by an international agreement between the United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK) called the U.S. and ROK Status of Forces Agreement.\n\nYour assignment in Korea not only helps the ROK, it helps the U.S. accomplish important foreign policy objectives. This does not entitle you to any special privileges, except for those provided in the SOFA.\n\nOn the other hand, the ROK is very willing for you to live and work in as familiar an environment as possible and to have for your personal use the same type of services and facilities that you enjoy back home. In return for having these things, which are generally not as readily available to its own citizens, the ROK government makes two r equests:\n\n1. That you respect the ROK laws, and\n\n2. That you do not allow the privileges granted U.S. forces to harm the nation's economy or that of its citizens.\n\nThe SOFA gives you benefits and protection. It enables you to enjoy the benefits of exchanges, commissaries, military clubs, banks/credit unions and postal services. It protects your legal and civil rights in case you are involved in an accident or suspected of a violation of ROK law.\n\nThe SOFA also provides that the ROK government will take jurisdiction over USFK personnel only for those offenses which violate ROK laws, such as causing the death of another person, robbery, rape, or attempts to commit such offenses. Offenders remain in U.S. custody until all judicial proceedings are completed.\n\nBlack-marketing and drug abuse are two particularly serious offenses in Korea. Selling or transferring items brought into the country duty free to someone who's not authorized the same privilege is black-marketing. This covers everything from cigarettes to TV sets.\n\nDrug laws in Korea are extremely rigid; do not violate them.\n\nBefore shipping your POV, you should consider the following:\n\n¬∑ Body damage: If your car has severe body damage it will not be allowed on the road\n\n¬∑ Tires: Tires must have a minimum of one millimeter (1 mm) depth over the entire tread and to be the sizes recommended by the manufacturer and do not stick out beyond the fender. Additionally, DO NOT mix radial tires with non-radial tires\n\n¬∑ Miscellaneous: Check your lights, exhaust system, seatbelts, brakes, windshield and windows (for cracks)\n\n¬∑ Recommendation: Pull-out radios, cassette decks, and CD players should be removed to reduce the chance of pilferage; your catalytic converter does not need to be removed; unleaded gas is available in the ROK\n\n¬∑ Tinted windows: Tint is not authorized on the driver or passenger windows\n\n¬∑ Check with your local TMO for the latest restrictions and information before shipping\n\nInsurance Some U.S. insurers will not write policies for overseas. Check with your current insurer before you PCS. Vehicle insurance companies are available both on and off base. Whatever you decide, you must show proof of insurance to pick up and register your vehicle on base.\n\nConsiderations: If you plan on shipping a POV to Kunsan, please understand that once you PCS, you will only be entitled to one POV shipment regardless of whether your follow-on assignment is CONUS or OCONUS. This means that if you ship a POV to Kunsan and your next base is Ramstein, Germany, then you cannot ship your Kunsan POV back to the states and then ship another vehicle to Ramstein unless you pay for one of the shipments yourself. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your local TMO.\n\nMaintenance on American vehicles Owning an American-made vehicle overseas could become expensive; often stateside warranties are not honored. Bottom line, be prepared for unexpected costs and consider this when deciding to ship your car overseas.\n\nContact your local TMO office for more details on shipping a vehicle.\n\n6. Preparing your household goods\n\nWhen you're deciding which personal items to ship, the Traffic Management Office should be the first stop after you receive orders. The staff at TMO has a list of weight allowances for household goods and a list of items that can and cannot be shipped.\n\nUpon arrival, government furniture is available in your dorms.\n\nWhen PSCing to Kunsan AB, you should not ship your washer, dryer, microwave, oven or refrigerator--these items are available in government quarters.\n\nBe prepared to wait 35 to 60 days for your unaccompanied baggage and 60 to 70 days for your household goods from the date of shipment.\n\nExtras to bring with you\n\nBring linens, blankets, and towels with you. To prevent the possibility of being without sheets, blankets or towels until your baggage arrives, please remember to pack your own in your luggage or mail them to yourself at your unit. If you choose to mail items to yourself, you may be reimbursed for the cost of the postage--contact your origin TMO/CPC for an authorization letter. Your sponsor will be able to assist you with APO mailing information.\n\nItems to typically ship are dependent on you as an individual. The Exchange at Kunsan is small and you may not find all the items you want. Osan has a larger Exchange, but is 2.5 hours away on Wolf Pack Wheels.\n\nItems in which you should bring but not limited to depending on your weight allowance:\n\n- Uniforms\n\n- Civilian Clothing (Warm and Cold Weather) (Rain Wear)\n\n- Entertainment Items...Guitar, Xbox, PS3, Computer, books, etc.\n\n- Cooking items for officers are not provided in the dorms. Recommend bringing plates, pots and pans, silverware, etc. There are microwaves and refrigerators in the officer quarters and shared appliances in the enlisted dorms.\n\nIt is important when you arrive that your correct contact information is on file so the appropriate offices may contact you when your property arrives.\n\nFor more information, check out www.move.mil.\n\nFor information on weigh allowances and other Travel Regulations, visit the Defense Travel Management Office and JFTR.\n\nGetting Here\n\n1. Where is Kunsan?\n\nKunsan Air Base is a United States Air Force base located on the west coast of the South Korean peninsula bordered by the Yellow Sea. It is adjacent to the town of Gunsan and about 150 miles (240 km) south of Seoul. The town (Íµ∞ÏÇ∞Ïãú in Korean) can be romanized as both Gunsan and Kunsan. The United States Air Force uses Gunsan to refer to the town, and Kunsan to refer to the base.\n\nThe base is named after Gunsan City, a port town seven and a half miles east of the installation. Kunsan AB is a true remote assignment. It is much more austere than Osan AB. It is not configured to provide adequate support to family members. Kunsan AB is home to the 8th Fighter Wing made up of two F-16 fighter squadrons, the 35th Fighter Squadron and the 80th Fighter Squadron.\n\nKunsan Air Base is the home of the 8th Fighter Wing, \"The Wolf Pack,\" assigned to the Pacific Air Forces' Seventh Air Force and the 38th Fighter Group of the Republic of Korea Air Force.

What is the ROK?\n\nThe Republic of Korea, or ROK, is an independent Korean state or collection of states which has existed almost continuously for several millennia.\n\nIt is located in Eastern Asia, at the southern half of the Korean Peninsula bordering the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. After World War II, a Republic of Korea (ROK) was set up in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula while a Communist-style government was installed in the north (the DPRK).\n\nDuring the Korean War (1950-53), U.S. troops and UN forces fought alongside soldiers from the ROK to defend South Korea from DPRK attacks supported by China and the Soviet Union.\n\nAn armistice was signed in 1953, splitting the peninsula along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter, South Korea achieved rapid economic growth with per capita income rising to roughly 17 times the level of North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea today is a fully functioning modern democracy. Serious tensions with North Korea have punctuated inter-Korean relations in recent years.
