        "text": "Chapter 1044: This is a Game\n\nрʟease reading on ΒʘXΝOVEL.ϹΟM\n\nTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation\n\nBraydon Neal had seen everything that had happened in the arena.\n\nHe stood on the high platform and said calmly, “Channing Lestrange is the Deputy Commander of the Northern Army. Elder Salinas, please preside over the order of the arena. Everything will proceed as usual.”\n\nThe internal judge, Elder Salinas, turned around and bowed slightly to the platform. “Yes, sir!”\n\nActually, Elder Salinas was also in despair.\n\nIt was only the second day of the Martial Artist Summit, and a pinnacle martial artist had jumped out.\n\nIt was like an existence that was causing trouble.\n\nElder Salinas braced himself and stepped onto the stage. He announced in front of everyone, “Once a martial artist steps onto the stage, no one is allowed to reject the challenge. Begin!”\n\n“I admit…”\n\nZephir Woodard did not finish his sentence.\n\nChanning glanced at him and released his invisible power again.\n\nThe judge, Elder Salinas, was sent flying again.\n\nWho hit the judge again?\n\n“I’m sorry,” Channing said drunkenly. “I drank too much fake wine and hit the wrong person!”\n\n“As long as you are happy, Deputy Commander Lestrange!”\n\nElder Salinas’s injuries weren’t serious, so he didn’t care. In fact, he knew very well that it was his fault for stopping Channing on stage.\n\nSince he had offended him, he could only endure the loss.\n\nFrom this, it could be seen that Channing was very petty.\n\nElder Salinas also knew that the Northern Army was targeting the Woodard family. He could not get involved.\n\nChanning seemed unreliable, but he was the deputy commander of the Northern Army and was personally acknowledged by the Northern King, Braydon.\n\nThe Northern Army was in charge of the country. Elder Salinas only wanted to spend his remaining years peacefully and didn’t want to offend the Northern Army elites.\n\nOn the stage, Zephir found it difficult to breathe. He felt an invisible hand grab his neck, and he couldn’t say the words, “I admit defeat.”\n\n“Kneel down!” Channing said softly, holding the half-bottle of wine.\n\nWith a light sentence, Zephir was pressed down on his knees by the invisible heavenly might and slid over.\n\nTwo bloody marks appeared on the clean arena.\n\nAn invisible force suppressed Zephir like an ant. His life and death were not in his hands.\n\nThis was the methods of a supreme pinnacle!\n\nChanning said softly, “The people of the Northern Army are very different from the martial artists in my memory. Although I have been frozen for many years and my memory is scattered, I still remember that in my era, martial artists killed each other and robbed each other. For a rare spirit herb, father and son would kill each other!\n\n“But the Northern Army is different!”\n\nFarron Sampson’s appearance before his death and his words revolved around Channing’s mind.\n\nBorn in the Northern Army, he died without regret!\n\nOne man died in battle, and all the men of the Northern Army were seeking revenge.\n\nHe had never seen such camaraderie in his era.\n\nPerhaps there were, but it was rare.\n\nChanning shot a glance at Zephir, then raised his hand and lightly slapped down.\n\nBang!\n\nEven the entire arena was directly blasted into dust.\n\nThe huge arena was originally extremely sturdy.\n\nUnder Channing’s palm, it vanished into thin air.\n\n“Woodard family martial artists, do you want revenge?” Channing turned around and stood in the air.\n\nNo one dared to speak.\n\nOther people went up to the arena for points.\n\nChanning had stepped onto the arena to kill, or more accurately, to target the Woodard family martial artists.\n\nNo one went up on stage.\n\nAccording to the rules, it was time for someone else to head up.\n\nElder Salinas, as the judge, couldn’t help but remind him. “Deputy Commander Lestrange, if no one challenges you, you can’t force them. It’s time to leave.”\n\n“It’s fine. From now on, I’ll kill every Woodard family martial artist I see!”\n\nChanning’s words made many people swallow their saliva.\n\nMany martial artists in the venue looked at the group of martial artists in the corner with pity in their eyes. There were old and young, and they were all members of the Woodard family.\n\nThe expressions of the Woodard family members were ugly, but most of them were afraid.\n\nChanning was a supreme pinnacle.\n\nHow did it feel to be stared at by a supreme pinnacle? You could ask the Woodard family.\n\n“Remember to let me know if there are any Woodard family martial artists stepping up to the arena later,” Channing said before he left the arena.\n\n“Alright!”\n\nElder Salinas hurriedly sent this god of plague away.\n\nThis was the first supreme pinnacle to appear after the Martial Artist Summit began.\n\nNow, it seemed that no one could afford to provoke him!\n\nChanning had already made it clear that as long as a martial artist participated in the Martial Artist Summit and ascended the nine arenas, regardless of gender or age, they would be killed by the ruthless people of the Northern Army!\n\nOn the side of the sixth arena belonging to the youth group, a graceful female martial artist with good talent, a low-level pinnacle martial artist, died under the cold sword.\n\nIt was Maddox Johnstone again!\n\nAfter Maddox stepped onto the stage, he killed her with one slash and walked down the stage.\n\nIt was because this female genius martial artist was a direct descendant of the Woodard family.\n\nTherefore, she was killed!\n\nBraydon sat at the head of the platform, watching everything coldly.\n\nScorpio Woodard killing Farron Sampson earlier was definitely not his own idea. It must have been the Woodard family’s idea.\n\nWithout the permission of the Woodard family elders, Scorpio would not dare to do this even if he had ten guts.\n\nHe had killed Farron with obvious intentions.\n\nScorpio had tortured and killed people, and it was even more humiliating for the Northern Army.\n\nThis angered the higher-ups of the Northern Army!\n\n“Frediano, inform the military school that all the students who have registered are withdrawing from the competition.” Braydon’s thin lips moved.\n\n“Brother, why are you withdrawing them from the competition?” Luke Yates put his hands on his hips and asked in dissatisfaction.\n\n“This is unfair to those juniors,” said Westley Hader with a frown.\n\n“It’s better than losing their life!”\n\nLuther Carden, who was sitting in the wheelchair, reminded him.\n\nYuri Qualls added, “The sudden provocation of the Northern Army must have been instigated by the Woodard family. The Woodard family alone is not strong enough to take down the Northern Army. I’m afraid there are several other aristocratic families working together.”\n\n“This is a game!”\n\nLuther’s words were even more precise.\n\nA game between the Northern Army and the aristocratic families!\n\nThe battle between the two had already begun.\n\nIt had begun in this Martial Artist Summit, and it would continue.\n\nThe people of the aristocratic families were extremely vicious.\n\nThis was because this was the Martial Artist Summit, and there were rules to follow.\n\nBoth sides had to abide by the rules.\n\nBraydon was the chief examiner of the Martial Artist Summit, and he was also the Garrison King of Hansworth.\n\nThe Martial Artist Summit was originally held by the capital government!\n\nEveryone knew that Braydon, the son of Hansworth, was the spokesperson of the capital and the most outstanding student nurtured by Martial Emperor Yanagi.\n\nOnce the Northern Army men under Braydon broke the rules of the summit, it would be a slap in the face.\n\nBraydon had broken the rules. How was he going to answer to the hundreds of thousands of martial artists?\n\nIf one did things arbitrarily, one would not be able to convince the masses.\n\nIf it was not handled well, it would arouse the anger of the masses.\n\nPerhaps the goal of the aristocratic families was to incite the anger of the people and unite hundreds of thousands of martial artists to target the Northern King and the Northern Army.\n\nThis was a formal event where the genius martial artists of the 23 provinces gathered.\n\nOnce a rule was set, it could not be broken.\n\nIt could not be changed at will!\n\nThis was because the entire world was watching the Martial Artist Summit!"
