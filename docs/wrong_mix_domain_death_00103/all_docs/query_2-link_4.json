        "text": "The People's President\n\nAndrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States, emerged from humble beginnings to become a military hero and a key figure in shaping 19th-century America. Known for his populist appeal, he left a complex legacy, with achievements including the Battle of New Orleans and the establishment of the modern Democratic Party.\n\nThe Hermitage was Andrew Jackson's home from 1804 until his death in 1845. Though The Hermitage's Collections include signficant personal items, the key source to researching Jackson is The Papers of Andrew Jackson Project based at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. This initiative began in the 1980s and continues its mission \"to collect and publish Jackson's entire extant literary record.\"\n\nThe Papers of Andrew Jackson Project (PAJ)\n\nYou can learn about this project, Jackson’s story, and access published records at https://thepapersofandrewjackson.utk.edu.\n\nVolume XII through 1834 is published and is available in book format to purchase from PAJ.\n\nAndrew Jackson Papers at the Library of Congress/John Spencer Bassett’s Correspondence of Andrew Jackson\n\nItems not transcribed in the PAJ or the Bassett papers that are part of the Library of Congress (LOC) Collection can be accessed at https://www.loc.gov/collections/andrew-jackson-papers/about-this-collection/.\n\nThis digital version of Bassett's Correspondence is an earlier transcribed edition consisting of important documents primarily from the LOC collection, covering six volumes and an index by correspondent. This set can be accessed at https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001639368."
