        "text": "The United States Secret Service was aware of an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump, leading the agency to increase security around him, CNN .\n\nThere is no indication this information is related to the Saturday shooting at Trump’s Pennsylvania rally, the outlet wrote.\n\n“Secret Service learned of the increased threat from this threat stream,” a national security official told the outlet. “NSC directly contacted USSS at a senior level to be absolutely sure they continued to track the latest reporting. USSS shared this information with the detail lead, and the Trump campaign was made aware of an evolving threat. In response to the increased threat, Secret Service surged resources and assets for the protection of former President Trump. All of this was in advance of Saturday.”\n\nTrump has “a lot to be grateful for” following the shooting, former Secret Service member Barry Donadio The National Desk following the shooting.\n\n“Those agents that jumped on Trump, I’m certain it went through their minds that that next bullet could be hitting them in the back,” Donadio said. “Being in the Secret Service is a way of life. It is not a job, it is a life-changing event where you make a decision that you may sacrifice your life for who you are protecting.\"\n\nSeveral major Republican lawmakers are for investigations into security failures which allowed the would-be assassin to fire at Trump.\n\n“I am formally demanding a full investigation by the Senate Homeland Security Committee into the massive security failure that resulted in an attempt on President Trump’s life - and the murder of an innocent American,” Sen. Josh Hawley wrote via X.\n\nJackson Walker on X at @_jlwalker_ for the latest trending national news. Have a news tip? Send it to jacwalker@sbgtv.com."
