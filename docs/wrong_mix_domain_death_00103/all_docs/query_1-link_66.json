He lost 78 to 43. The sons of four or five principal citizens stole bee hives and\n\nSamuel Tracy prosecuted them. Their fathers and friends brought out Ransom Odle to run against\n\nSamuel Tracy for Prosecuting Attourney. The artical listed Ransom Odle’s occupation as seng digger\n\nand his residence as in the hills of the West Side.\n\nAccording to Carl Nelson Odle, Ransom Odle came down the Ohio River to settle in Scioto County,\n\nOH.\n\nThe Portsmouth Times, August 2, 1859\n\nPORTSMOUTH.\n\nWe propose to throw into the compass of this hastily written article, a few hints respecting the city in\n\nwhich we live. It is our purpose, hereafter, to resume the subject, and consider it somewhat in detail.\n\n1. No town on either bank of the Ohio river, between Pittsburg and Cincinnati, has, within the last\n\nfifteen years, attained a GROWTH so rapid, so sure, and so substantial as Portsmouth. Within ten\n\nyears, her population has absolutely doubled. Real estate has advanced at a steady and healthful\n\nPage 12 of 37 Tuesday, April 06, 2010 4:48:39 PM\n\nyears, her population has absolutely doubled. Real estate has advanced at a steady and healthful\n\nrate. Year by year improvements of every kind are projected and carried into execution. What is not\n\ndone at one time is certain to be undertaken at another. As a consequence we have excellent\n\npavements, clean streets, creditable public buildings, good substantial business houses, and neat\n\nprivate residences. The health of the place is wonderfully improved by the clearing up of the Scioto\n\nbottoms, and, by the plan of sewerage, and the filling up of the depressed grounds so systematically\n\ncarried forward for several years past.\n\n2. Owing to her POSITION, on the Ohio River, at the southern TERMINUS of the Ohio Canal, of the\n\nScioto & Hocking Valley Railroad, and of the Columbus & Portsmouth ‘Turnpike, Portsmouth has a\n\ncertainty of progress hereafter such as no other Ohio River place (Cincinnati excepted) has or can\n\nhave. Railroads do not run through her, away from, and away with her, as has been the case with\n\nCircleville, Chillicothe, Lancaster, Zanesville and many other Ohio towns, lately so flourishing, now\n\nutterly crippled.We will not enlarge on this point. Any man who can think at all, will be able to think\n\nfor himself with this fact before him.\n\n3. Portsmouth possesses greater facilities for MANUFACTURING than almost any other city in the\n\nwest, and especially for the manufacture of Iron. We have, in the neighborhood, about Twenty-three\n\nFurnaces which make this city their place of landing. Consequently, iron can be had cheaper here\n\nthan in any other place. Then as to QUALITY, that produced in this region cannot be surpassed,\n\nbeing mostly made by charcoal from the best Limestone ores. Our Bar, and, particularly, our Boiler\n\nIron has justly acquired a high reputation abroad. The casting of balls for the U. S. Army has been\n\ncommenced here within a year.\n\nMURRAY, STEVENSON & Co. have made for the U. S. Army, under the direction of Secretary\n\nFLOYD, a large lot of forty-two pound balls, the quality of which is said to be far superior to those\n\nwhich are made in the East from Scotch Pig and Stone Coal Iron. The Inspecting officer pronounced\n\nthem the best he ever examined. We hope our government will award them another contract, as they\n\nwill assuredly do whatever is right in the premises.\n\nT sum up our Manufactories in short hand: We have here in Portsmouth-2 Rolling Mills, 4 Foundries,\n\n2 Machine Shops, 3 Barrow Factories, 4 Chair Factories, 3 Planing Mills, 2 Sash and Door Factories,\n\n3 Grist Mills, 2 Distilleries, 2 Barrel Factoriesand, of those, the greater number is run by steam. Six\n\nyears ago, there were but SIX STEAM ENGINES in the place! What a commentary upon our real\n\nadvancements is afforded by this one isolated fact!\n\nIn the northeast United States during 1816 many farmers suffered such heavy losses that they\n\nabandoned their farms and migrated to the western territories. The year 1816 was unusually cold and\n\ndry, especially in the northeast. It has been described as the “year without summer”. In Vermont and\n\nMaine there was snowfall every month of the summer (June, July, August, and September),\n\ndestroying 100% of the crop. There were frosts as late as mid-July as far south as New Jersey that\n\ndestroyed 100% of the spring planted crop. For farmers that replanted in July, the frosts that began\n\nagain in September destroyed 100% of the July planted crop. The cause of the 1816 “year without\n\nsummer” was the Tambora volcano eruption of 1815 on Sumatra, the largest volcano eruption in\n\nrecorded history. The eruption of Tambura was 100x more powerfull than the eruption of Mount St.\n\nHelen. Many farmers from New England gave up and migrated west. Ransom Odle may have\n\nmigrated to Ohio during about 1816, due to the 1816 crop loss in New York.\n\nSamuel Odell (b. Sept. 15, 1818) was the son of Samuel Odell (b. Jan 14, 1770, d Jan 17, 1843) and\n\nElizabeth Wells. Samuel, grandson of Capt Augustine Odell, has been traced in Ohio, where Ransom\n\nmigrated in about 1816.\n\nSamuel Odell senior was the son of Capt. Augustine Odell (b. ca 1740 in Beekman Twnsp, Dutchess\n\nCo. NY and died Jan 4, 1804 in Queensbury, NY. Election supervisor of Queensbury, NY during\n\n1788-89. Residence in 1800 was Sherburne, Chenango Co. NY. He was a Captain in in 6th Albany\n\nCo Regiment of New York and a Captain in Vermont during Revolutionary War. Wife Molly —-.

On April 4, 1804, 70 Square Miles of Chenango County was partitioned to expand Oneida\n\nCounty, including the communities of Waterville, and Sangerfield. On March 21, 1806, 650 Square\n\nMiles of Chenango County was partitioned to produce Madison County. This produced Chenango\n\nCounty as it exists today.\n\nText taken from “History of Washington County, New York” by Crisfield Johnson, originally published\n\nin 1878.\n\n“Some of our readers may have thought we devoted more space to the troubles between New York\n\nand Vermont than belonged to them in a strictly local history of Washington county. But, in fact, that\n\nimbroglio affected even the internal affairs of Charlotte county, and in 1781 some very curious\n\nmovements took place in several of the towns of that and Albany counties, which have seldom or\n\nnever been treated in national histories, but which might have had a serious effect on the welfare of\n\nthe whole country.\n\n“As has been stated, the county of Charlotte and that part of Albany county now included in\n\nWashington were principally settled by New Englanders, and by Scotch and others of foreign birth.\n\nThe former had almost all adhered to the American cause, which many (though by no means all) of\n\nthe latter were friendly to the king. As the Americans were most of the time in possession of the\n\nterritory in question, the New Englanders were largely in the majority among the dominant class.\n\n“These had generally sympathized more or less with their compatriots who were striving to set up an\n\nindependent government in Vermont. The Vermonters, too, although they had openly claimed only to\n\nthe present east line of that State, had kept up a kind of faint half-claim to the territory between that\n\nline and the Hudson, or even farther west, on the ground that it had been included in Skene’s new\n\nprovince of Ticonderoga, of which they deemed their State in some way to be the political heir.\n\n“…The intrigue for the annexation of the territory before mentioned was going forward at the same\n\ntime. Not liking to rest their claim on no higher authority than the supposed organization of the\n\nprovince of Ticonderoga, the Vermonters also resorted to the secession doctrine. In April the\n\nLegislature of that State directed that a convention be held at Cambridge the following month,\n\ncomposed of delegates elceted by the people of the various districts of Charlotte county of that part of\n\nAlbany county lying north of the south line of Vermont prolonged to the Hudson, which convention\n\nshould decide whether, and on what terms, those districts should be united to the State of Vermont.”\n\nText taken from “History of Washington County, New York” by Crisfield Johnson, originally published\n\nin 1878.\n\n“The long and deadly struggle of the Revolution, with its accompaniments of invasion, house-burning,\n\nand Indian outrage, had naturally developed a very bitter feeling among the people, especially on the\n\nfrontiers, against everything of English name or origin. Even the name of Queen Charlotte was not\n\nAncestors of William J. (Bill) Odle\n\nGeneration 5 (con’t)\n\nPage 14 of 37 Tuesday, April 06, 2010 4:48:39 PM\n\nfrontiers, against everything of English name or origin. Even the name of Queen Charlotte was not\n\nagreeable to the inhabitants of Charlotte county, whose farms had been devastated by the troops of\n\nQueen Charlotte’s husband. Still more unpleasant was the name of Tryon county, derived from the\n\nlast British governor of New York, to the people of the Mohawk valley, where the work of burning and\n\nmassacre had been carried on year after year by Tories and Indians in British employ,.\n\n“Accordingly, on the second day of April, 1784, the Legislature passed an act changing the two\n\nnames just mentioned. It was a model of brevity and precision, and, after the enacting clause, read as\n\nfollows:\n\n‘From and after the passage of this act the county of Tryon shall be known by the name of\n\nMontgomery, and the county of Charlotte by the name of Washington.’\n\n“Thus the most honored appellation known to Americans was conferred upon this county. The name\n\nwas not as common then as now, and we believe this is the oldest ‘Washington county’ in the United\n\nStates,–a venerable patriarch with nearly forty namesakes among counties, besides an almost\n\ncountless host of towns, villages, and post-offices.”\n\nText taken from “History of Washington County, New York” by Crisfield Johnson, originally published\n\nin 1878.\n\n“In 1791, Vermont was admitted to the Union as a State, thus putting the seal of Federal authority on\n\nthe settlement arrived at this year. Washington county thus became permanently a border county\n\nalong all of its enormous length. In this year also the counties of Rensselaer and Saratoga were\n\nformed from Albany.

Originally Genesee County\n\ncomprised virtually all of Western New York and was divided into only four “Shires” or towns; Batavia,\n\nNorthampton, Southampton, and Leicester. Gradually, parcels of land were taken from Genesee\n\nCounty to form other counties; Allegany (1806), Cattaraugus (1808), Chautauqua (1808), Niagara\n\n(1808), part of Livingston (1821), part of Monroe (1821), Erie (1821), Orleans (1824) and Wyoming\n\n(1841).

The idea was pursued at several stages, ending in failure\n\nfor one reason or another until 1790, when New York consented to the admission of Vermont into the\n\nUnion, ceded control of the New Hampshire Grants to Vermont and stated the New York-Vermont\n\nboundary should be the western edge of the New Hampshire Grants and the mid-channel of Lake\n\nChamplain.

Buffalo Hump takes its name from\n\na prominent intrusive into the Idaho granite batholith rising to an elevation of 8,926 feet in\n\nthe form of a recumbent buffalo and is a prominent landmark of the central Idaho region\n\nSpeaking of the gold discoveries in Idaho during the early 1860’s, James H. Hawley stated:\n\nOf the thousands who came into the new camp of Florence during the summer of 1862,\n\nnearly all stopped for a short time at least. The limited area of place ground, however, in\n\nthat vicinity, soon became apparent and prospecting parties started in all directions. As\n\nusual in all mining camps the unfounded reports of rich discoveries soon became\n\ncirculated among those remaining in the camp, and it was early in the summer of 1862 that\n\na rumor became current there that rich mines had been discvoered at the base of the\n\nmountain known as Buffalo Hump, a well known mountain, situated about forty miles\n\nnortheast of Florence, and to the new El Dorado went practically all of those who had\n\ncome into the new section; they packed their scant amount of provisions and blankets on\n\ntheir backs and started for the new El Dorado, but only disappointments awaited them\n\nthere, as they soon ascertained. There was no placer gold and the gold-bearing ledges\n\ncropping out in many places were of a low grade and could not be profitably worked at that\n\ntime. (“History of Idaho, Vol. I, 1920)\n\nSome years later, Buffalo Hump mines began to prosper in 1898\n\nFrom “Illustrated History of North Idaho,” quoting a man named Attorney Nash:\n\nNo one had any idea of the enthusiasm that the Buffalo Hump strike has arroused. It is all\n\nand even more than the locators claimed for it. The assays run to phenomenal values and\n\nnone of the returns have been low. The strike itself is one of the most phenomenal\n\ngeological freaks ever discovered. It consists of a huge vein of ore thrown up on the face of\n\nthe plain and for five miles one can ride along beside it on horseback. In its course the vein\n\nruns straight through the Salmon River.\n\nFor two weeks past men have been flocking from all directions to the camp. At night the\n\ncamp fires resemble those of an army; for miles around they leap heavenward. More than\n\ntwo hundred prospectors were living in tents along the vein when I left Grangeville.\n\nFlorence and the other camps are almost depopulated; men threw up good jobs to get to\n\nthe strike; you meet them on foot, huge packs on their backs; on horseback, two men on a\n\nhorse . . . all with but one thought — to stake out a claim before all are gone.\n\nFor years trained and veteran prospectors camped beside it, and climbed over and around\n\nto get into the renowned diggings in Boise Basin, in the Florence district, in the northern\n\ncounties, into the Seven Devils country and to dozens of other localities long since\n\nforgotten.\n\n– Between 1850 and 1900 was the primary settlement period of Douglas County, Oregon.\n\nMuch of the settlement was inspired by the Oregon Donation Land Act of 1850. By 1860,\n\nthere were 3,162 persons living in Douglas County according to the Federal Census.\n\nSource: Government in Idaho. 12th session of Idaho legislature conened at Boise City\n\nfrom Dec 11, 1882 to Feb 8, 1883.

Death certificate states\n\nage 78, born in VA, father Charles Shaw, mother Resiah Shaw..\n\nNotes for Charles Wesley Shaw:\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nCourtesy of Ruth Shaw Book, this family story was written by a daughter of Charles in the late 19th\n\ncentury:\n\nCharles Shaw was from the Shenandoah Valley of VA. He and his first wife had a farm and he also\n\ndrove livestock west, which kept him away from home a lot. He had been told that his wife was\n\nunfaithful out while he was away on drives. One trip a storm came up and he returned after only a\n\nshort time. There he found his wife and the local preacher. The next morning he left with only some\n\nmoney and his clothes. (He wanted to protect her and their children’s standing in the community.)\n\nHe traveled to the Tennessee hills, stopping at an inn where he met a waitress named Ann. He had\n\nto make another drive and told her to wait and that he would come back for her. In Nile Twp he\n\npurchased a farm (now the Yeager farm) on Route 125 near the Boy Scout camp. Then he returned\n\nfor Ann and left her with the local dressmaker (known to Stella Shaw) until they could be married.\n\nThey had 3 children, Malinda Ann, Elllie Ann, and a third daughter who along with Ann died in\n\nchildbirth. These daughters all were named Ann after the wife he so loved. He buried them in a\n\ngrove on the Yeager farm.\n\nAfter some time he began dating Elmira Harbert, daughter of his neighbor. She was very young and\n\nhe was in his 40’s so her father was very opposed to their relationship. Before one date, he tied her\n\nby the hands to the rafters of a shed so she couldn’t meet Charles. Her brother Reese found her,\n\nuntied her, and told her to keep her date and marry Charles. After this incident her brother was never\n\nseen again. It is believed by local people that her father killed him, as the next day his well was filled\n\nin and a new one dug!\n\nThey were married and had 8 children. Mahala had an illegitimate child by Thomas Odle and was\n\nraised by Charles and Elmira as their own. No one knew the story but Mahala, Charles, and Elmira\n\nuntil Newton was 65 and had to return to his mother for her signature for Social Security.\n\n21. Anna Coon Bishop was born about 1795 in VA.

Jacob Jones accompanied his mother over the Alleghany\n\nMountains and proceeded on to the west side of the Monongahela River, near\n\nthe present town of Pentres. It was Indian country and the settlements were\n\ngreatly disturbed by Indian raids, beginning in 1774 and continuing through\n\nthe Revolution. During the outbreak of 1777 Jacob Jones and other members of\n\nhis family were besieged in the home of a neighbor, and two of his children,\n\nMary and John Jones were taken captive. Mary was adopted into the Wyandot\n\ntribe of Indians and spent many years with her chosen people near Sandusky,\n\nOhio. John Jones was not satisfied to remain an Indian, and eventually\n\nescaped, going to Detroit, was educated in medicine by his adopted father and\n\nlater visited his father and other members of the family in West Virginia and\n\nfor many years lived near the Town of Grafton. Jacob Jones made his escape\n\nfrom the Indian besiegers and subsequently removed to a safer situation on\n\nCheat River. He was a frontier soldier until the close of the Revolution,\n\nand about 1794 he obtained a grant of land near Knottsville in Taylor County,\n\nwhere both he and his wife died about 1829 at the respective ages of\n\nninety-six and ninety-three.

William Jones was\n\nborn May 4, 1774, in Monongalia County. Just before his birth occurred the\n\nIndian raid of that year. His mother being unable to leave home, the older\n\nchildren were sent on to the nearest fort and subsequently, following a\n\nsecond warning, Jacob and his wife also started for the fort. The son\n\nWilliam was born after they had proceeded about five miles, and a neighbor\n\ncarried the new-born child while the father supported his wife as best he\n\ncould until they reached safety. William Jones lived near Knottsville, where\n\nhe died in 1843. His wife was Sarah Anderson, and they were the parents of\n\nten children. Of these, Samuel, the sixth child, was born February 2, 1808,\n\nand was a farmer and shoemaker near Knottsville, where he died in 1897. He\n\nmarried Frances Limber who was born in 1818 and died in 1888. Their second\n\nchild, Uriah Hones, father of Professor Jones, was born near Knottsville,\n\nJanuary 14, 1839.
