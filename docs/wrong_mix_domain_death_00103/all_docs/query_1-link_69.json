        "text": "The surname for this ancestral line was sometimes spelled as Whitaker and sometimes as Whitaker, with other various misspellings noted on census and other records, i.e. Whiteaker, Whitacre, etc. For consistency and ease of \"searching\" and locating names, I have decided to drop the second \"T\" and use the spelling Whitaker. Much of the following information was obtained from Carla Pigman, a descendant of John Martin Whitaker, for which I am grateful. Sharon Calvert has also helped me unravel some of the tangles in this family. The Ancestry website, the Familysearch website, and the Find a Grave website have also provided useful information. I cannot vouch for the complete accuracy of all of the information I have gathered, so would appreciate being informed of obvious errors. I can be contacted by email at kkgoins@comcast.net. The Whitaker Family Page was last updated in March 2021.\n\nThe oldest Whitaker I have found related to our line is Thomas Whitaker, born about 1655 in Yorkshire, England. I do not have his parents names nor his wife's name, but his name is listed as: \"Mr. Thomas Whiteakers Junir of Thornhill of Dewsbury, Yorkshire, England.\" This is found engraved on a \"historical/memorial marker\" placed by \"Descendants 2012\" in connection with another marker placed by the \"Rockford Preservation Society 2012,\" in Rockford, Surry County, North Carolina, as well as three markers which seem to have been placed in Harford County, Maryland in 2008. Complete transcriptions of these \"markers\" may be found at the bottom of this page (\"Appendix 1\"). I have included some individual notations from the markers for details below relating to Mark Whitaker (1677-1729 - Maryland) and his son Thomas T. Whitaker (1712-1787 - North Carolina).\n\n1 - Thomas Whitaker, born about 1655 in Yorkshire, England, to unknown parents, and married to unknown wife. One child known - Mark Whitaker*(see below), born November 1677 in West Yorkshire, England. Date of death - unknown.\n\n2 - Mark Whitaker (Sr.), born in November 1677 to Thomas Whitaker (Jr.>) and unknown mother in Yorkshire, England.\n\n1677 - born prior to November 8, 1677; christened November 8 at St. Michael & All Angels Church in West Yorkshire, England.\n\n1693 - admitted \"sizar\" to Emmanuel College, Cambridge University on November 27. Note: Definition of \"Sizar\" per Wikipedia, at Cambridge University, \"a sizar is an undergraduate who receives some form of assistance such as meals, lower fees, or lodging during his or her period of study, in some cases in return for doing a defined job.\"\n\n1697 - \"matriculated\"/graduated from the above college.\n\n1702 - resident of Baltimore County, Maryland, per Maryland Compiled Census & Census Substitutions Index. The memorial marker shows that in 1702 Mark first appeared on the Tax Rolls of \"Spesutia Hundred\" in present-day Harford County, Maryland. Note: See the Appendix for the transcription of a historical marker in Harford County, Maryland, \"St. George's Parish Spesutia Church - 1671.\"\n\nFamily information as follows can be found in \"Baltimore County Families 1659-1759,\" and on the Maryland \"Family\" memorial marker as noted in the Appendix.\n\n1705 - married 1st: Catherine Teague (1690-1717) at St. George Parish, in Baltimore (or Harford) County, Maryland, with children: (1) Elizabeth Whitaker Swift (1704-1787), married Flower Swift with children Thomas Swift, Flower Swift, and Margaret Swift; (2) Thomas T. Whitaker*(see below) (1712-1787), married Mary Wilson with children Margaret Whitaker, Jane Whitaker, Elizabeth Whitaker, Mary Whitaker, Nancy Ann Whitaker, Mark M. Whitaker, and Johnson Whitaker Sr.; (3) Mark Whitaker (Jr.) (born 1716), married to Abigail Johnston; not much other information is known; and (4) Catherine D. Whitaker (born 1717). Note: Catherine D. Whitaker's full date of birth was given on the Maryland memorial marker as November 15, 1717, and this is the full date of death given for her mother, Catherine Teague Whitaker, thus it appears that Catherine, the mother, died in or related to childbirth.\n\n1713 - Per the Maryland memorial marker (see Appendix), Mark Whitaker, Planter, bought 100 acres of land in a tract called Westwood, from Robert West for \"2500 pounds of good tobacco.\"\n\n1718 - married 2nd: Elizabeth Empson (1704-1746), on February 13, 1718, with children: (1) Charity Whitaker (b. 1718); (2) James Whitaker (1721-1810), (3) Empson Whitaker (b. 1724); (4) Elizabeth Whitaker (b. 1726); not much is known about any of these children.\n\n1720 - Per a 2001 email from Jim Drew, this Mark Whitaker was \"clerk for the church in St. Georges Parish,\" a \"Vestryman.\"\n\n1726 - Per the Maryland marker, church vestry records show that in \"1726, by an order to Mark Whitaker for his sallery being Clk of the Vestry.\"\n\n1729 - Mark Whitaker died May 1, in Baltimore County, Maryland, at age 51. Per the Find A Grave website, he was buried at St. George's Episcopal Church Cemetery. Please see the Appendix for a transcription of a historical marker related to this church.\n\n3 - Thomas T. Whitaker, born June 12, 1712 in Baltimore County, Maryland.\n\n1712 - born June 12, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mark Whitaker and Catherine Teague.\n\n1729 - at age 17, he petitioned the Court as an orphan, stating he had left his step-mother's home and desired to be allowed to live with his mother's sister Ann Teague Mitchell and her husband Thomas Mitchell, and the Court granted his petition.\n\n1735 - married; Note: this possible marriage year is not certain since the first listed child was born in about 1748 (more research is needed). See next entry.\n\n1745 - married to Mary Wilson (1715-1795); this marriage year is based on the birth year of their first child known to me; however, more research is needed; with children: (1) Margaret Whitaker (about 1748-1834); (2) Jane Whitaker (born about 1750); (3) Elizabeth Whitaker (born about 1754); (4) Mark M. Whitaker (1755-1812); (5) Mary Whitaker Osborne(1759-?); (6) Nancy Ann Whitaker York (1760-1820), married James Earl York, with two known children: John William York and Mark York; and (7) Johnson Whitaker (Sr.)* (see below) (1765-1800).\n\n1787 - Thomas T. Whitaker died in Surry County, North Carolina.\n\n4 - Johnson Whitaker (Sr.), born about 1765 to Thomas T. Whitaker and Mary Wilson.\n\n1765 - born in Surry County, North Carolina.\n\n1784 - married to Sarah Stafford (born about 1765) in Surry County, North Carolina, on September 7, 1784; with children: (1) Margaret \"Peggy\" Whitaker Sexton (born about 1789), married to Thomas Sexton with children Thomas E. Sexton and Solomon Sexton; (2) Johnson Whitaker (Jr.)*(see below) (born about 1790); and (3) Nancy E. Whitaker Ham Long (1793-1871), married 1st to Shelton/Chilton Ham with children Amanda Ham and Happy Ham King; married 2nd to William Long with children Perry Long, Levi Long, and Drury Long. Note: Thomas T. and Mary Whitaker probably had other children also, but I have no information on any others.\n\n1800 - I believe Johnson Whitaker (Sr.) died in Madison County, Kentucky and was buried there, even though his Find A Grave memorial gives his death place as Washington County, Tennessee. More research is needed, and I will make corrections if needed. After Johnson's death, his widow, Sarah Stafford Whitaker married Samuel Feagley in 1802 and had two children: Sarah Feagley Kelley and Polly Feagley Long.\n\n5 - Johnson Whitaker (Jr.), born about 1790 to Johnson Whitaker (Sr) and Sarah Stafford Whitaker Feagley.\n\n1790 - born in Surry County, North Carolina\n\n1812 - married Ankey \"Ann\" Taylor (born about 1792) on September 3, 1812, in Madison County, Kentucky.\n\nTheir children:\n\n1) Johnson Whitaker (3rd, in my Tree) (born 1812), married Mary \"Polly\" Land; I have no further information about either of these people.\n\n2) James Harvey Whitaker, (about 1813-1858), married Sarah Byrum (about 1815-1870), with children (1) Archibald Whitaker (1836-1913), married Martha Jane West, with children James Irving Whitaker, Laura Bell Whitaker Rollins, Rufus Turpin Whitaker, Robert Hamilton Whitaker, and Wilbert R. Whitaker; (2) James Henry Whitaker* (1837-1923) married Elizabeth Jane Tudor, with children Rolinda Bell Whitaker Howard, William Whitaker, James Whitaker, Nathaniel \"Nat\" Whitaker, Sarah E. Whitaker, and Ruther B. Whitaker; (3) Nancy Whitaker (born about 1839), I have no other information about her; (4) Sarah Whitaker (born about 1841), I also have no other information about her; (5) Johnson M. \"Duff\" Whitaker (1843-1917) married 1st to Elizabeth Carrie Collins Teeter Whitaker with children Josie Fine Whitaker Gulley, James H. Whitaker, Sarah Whitaker, and Ella Whitaker; married 2nd to Bettie Whitaker, with no children and no further information found; (6) Margaret \"Catherine\" Whitaker Walker (1846-1938), married to George Walker, with two daughters (unknown names); (7) William Whitaker (born about 1847); I have no other information on him; (8) John Whitaker (born about 1848), no other information (not to be confused with John Martin Whitaker who fought in the Civil War); (9) Thomas Whitaker (1852-?), married to Belle Kersey; (10) Taylor Whitaker (1855-?) married to Irene McLean/Malear with children Willard Whitaker, Pendleton Whitaker, Ida B. Whitaker, Raymond Whitaker, and John L. Whitaker; (11) Stephen (born about 1856), no other information; (12) Susan A.

Short, Macy Short, Luther Short, Sallie Short Douglas, Isaac Zee Short, Maggie Short Agee, Martha J. Short Ham, Effie L. Short, and Ernest Short. *Note: James Henry Whitaker served in the Civil War, Union Army, 11th Kentucky Cavalry, Company A, along with other Whitaker men.\n\n3) Marcus Aurelius \"Mark\" Whitaker - see below (about 1814-1900).\n\n4) John Jackson Whitaker (born about 1815), married to Sarah \"Sally\" Land (born about 1817), with children Mary Elizabeth Whitaker Million Sallee, Jane Whitaker, William Jackson Whitaker, Lucy F. Whitaker Ham, Robert Andrew \"Bud\" Whitaker, James Woodson \"WB\" or \"Woodie B.\" Whitaker, and Henry Clay Whitaker.\n\n5) Polly Whitaker (born about 1820 ?), I have found no further information on her.\n\n6) Margaret Whitaker Gully (born about 1820 ?), married to William Gully, with children: Berry B. Gully, Mary Elizabeth Gully Turpin, John Gully, Sarah M. Gully, Thomas Gully, William D. Gully, and Susan J. Gully.\n\n7) Irvine Whitaker (born about 1822), married 1st to Tabitha Jane Moberly (1827-1855) with children (1) Thomas J. Whitaker* (1843-1922), married to Annie Elizabeth Roberts with children: Lettie Jane Whitaker Murphy and Nancy Ann Whitaker Long; (2) James Milton Whitaker* (1847-1904), married to Mary Jane Doolin Brooks Whitaker, with children: James Archibald Whitaker; Sarah \"Sallie\" Whitaker Whitaker, Robert A. Whitaker, Dossie/Dawcy Whitaker Gulley, William Irvine \"Willie\" Whitaker, Bettie Whitaker Prater, Loie Whitaker, and Herbert Whitaker; (3) Charles Whitaker (born 1848), no further information; (4) Clarka/Clarky Whitaker Sanders (1849-1883), married to Moses Sanders with children: Bertha or Bythia Jane Sanders, Thomas J. Sanders, William Sanders, and Robert Sanders; (5) Martha Whitaker (born 1849), no further information; (6) William Dudley Whitaker (1852-1929), married to Mary Jane Sanders, with one known child: James Whitaker; and Perry Whitaker (1854-1854). Married 2nd to Tempe/Tempy Barnes (born about 1834) with children: (1) Abraham L Whitaker (born 1862), no further information; (2) Nancy Ann \"Anna\" Whitaker Murphy (1864-1950), married to William A. Murphy, with children: Etta Murphy, Charles Murphy, Mary \"Hattie\" Murphy Lundin, William \"Willis\" Murphy, Leta Murphy, and Ada Murphy; (3) Emily Whitaker (born 1870), no further information; (4), Robert Whitaker (born 1872), no further information; and (5) Mary Whitaker (born 1875), no further information. *Note: Thomas J. Whitaker served in the Civil War, Union Army, 1st Kentucky Cavalry, Co. K, and James Milton Whitaker served in the Civil War, Union Army, 11th Kentucky Cavalry, Co. A.\n\n8) Zachariah Whitaker (born about 1824), married Susan Turner (1835-1900), with children:(1) George W. Whitaker (1850-1936), married Samira \"Mira\" Tudor, with children: Lemuel Newton Whitaker, Jeanette \"Nettie\" Whitaker Grimes, and Connie Whitaker; and (2) William S. Whitaker (born about 1856), no further information.\n\n9) Sarah Ann \"Sally\" Whitaker Gulley (1825-1881), married to John M. Gulley (1821-1907), with children: (1) Griffith H. Gulley (1851-1931), married to Margaret Curry, with child: Ralph Gulley; (2) Margaret E. Gulley Collins (1854-1933), married to Lambert Collins, with children: Charles E. Collins, John H. Collins, Harry Collins, Mary B. Collins, Bert Collins, Arthur Everrett Collins, and Margaret \"Maggie\" Collins Allen; (3) Charles Gulley (1857-1933), married to Minnie Dilley, with children: Orville R. Gulley, Raymond Carl Gulley, Leona Gulley Perry, and Laurence Gulley; (4) Isabelle \"Belle\" Gulley (1859-1919), with no further information; and (5) John M. Gulley, Jr. (1861-1949), married to Ella Strupe, with children: Claude Gulley, Cordia Gulley, and Hazel Gulley.\n\n1840 - the last documentation I have for Johnson Whitaker, Jr., is the Madison County, Kentucky census for 1840 which shows 1 male age 40-49 (Johnson) and 5 others under age 20 (1 male age 5-9, 1 male 10-14, 1 female age 5-9, 1 female age 10-14, and 1 female 15-19). From this record, it is presumed that Johnson's wife, Ankey Taylor Whitaker, had already died, but I have no dates or other information about the deaths of either she or Johnson.\n\nDeath - date of death of Johnson Whitaker (Jr.) is unknown to me, but after 1840 census, and probably in Madison County, Kentucky.\n\n6 - Marcus Aurelius (Mark) Whitaker was born in January 1814 to Johnson Whitaker (Jr) and Ankey \"Ann\" Taylor.\n\nNote: It seems that Johnson and/or Ann may have been fairly well educated to have given their son this name. Per Wikipedia, \"Marcus Aurelius was Roman Emporer from 161 AD to 180 AD, as well as a Stoic philosopher. He was the last of the rulers known as the Five Good Emporers.\" Most census records list his name as \"Mark,\" although in one he is listed as \"Marcus\" and one inexplicably listed as \"Martin.\" His marriage record has his name as \"Marcus Whitaker.\" His daughter, Fanny, attempted to name her firstborn son after her dad, but didn't quite get it right, and ended up naming him \"Relus Marcus\" Goins. That endears me to Fanny, because she really intended to honor her father by giving her son what she thought was his name, but without understanding who Marcus Aurelius was, she fell a bit short.\n\n1814 - born in Madison County, Kentucky.\n\n1832 - married Mourning Ham (about 1812-1900) on October 25, 1832, in Madison County, Kentucky. Note: Mourning's name has always fascinated me because of the specific spelling which indicates \"sadness and sorrow.\" However, one of her daughters insisted that her mother's name was spelled \"Mornen,\" and I assume she was thinking more along the lines of a morning greeting, such as \"Good mornen to you.\"\n\nMarcus and Mourning's children:\n\n1) Patsy Whitaker (born about 1834), age 16 in 1850 Madison County, Kentucky, census; I have no further information on her.\n\n2) William \"Will\" Whitaker (1836-1891), married Sarah Ann \"Sally\" Elkins (1843-1872) in Madison County, Kentucky. In the 1850 and 1860 Madison County, Kentucky census, Will is found living in the home of his parents with siblings; he and Sally were married in 1862, he applied for the Civil War draft in 1863 but did not serve; in the 1870 Madison County, Kentucky, census, 33-year-old Will and 22-year-old Sally are found living in Million Precinct, where Will's occupation is listed as \"Miller,\" with no children, but a farmhand and domestic servant are included as occupants of the household. Sarah Ann \"Sally\" Elkins Whitaker, daughter of Robert and Polly Elkins, died on November 1, 1872, and was buried at Gilead Cemetery. I have no further information about William Whitaker until an April 22, 1891, notice of his April 2, 1891, death was published in the Richmond, KY, Climax newspaper. He too was buried at Gilead Cemetery where Sally had been buried nearly 20 years before.\n\n3) Sidney M. Whitaker* (born about 1837), married Adeline Ivins (1840-1900) on July 28, 1866, in Madison County, Kentucky. Their children: (1) Ida \"Belle\" Whitaker Agee (1867-1939), married Charles Agee with children: Eddie Agee, William P. Agee, Sallie Ann Agee, Charley B. Agee, Irvine Agee, Leroy Agee, Goldie Agee, Lizzie Agee, Hugh Agee, and Gilbert Agee; (2) Lucy Ann Whitaker Long Hamm (1870-1958), married 1st to William Moore Long with children: Lillie B. Long, Ella M. Long, Oscar C. Long, Hallie Long Bogie, and Willie Long; married 2nd to Robert W. Hamm; (3) Alan J. Whitaker (born 1872), with no other information; (4) Susan Whitaker (1873-1874); (5) Mollie Whitaker Singer (1874-1943), married to George Singer, with children: Ellie L. Singer, Lillie M. Singer, Houston Singer, Velma Singer Land, and Sara Singer Faulkland; and (6) Cordelia \"Delia\" Whitaker Agee Crutcher (1877-1962), married 1st to William Sherman Agee, with children: Alma Agee, Alvis Agee, Preston Agee, Samuel Agee, and Coy Agee; married 2nd to Augusta Fleming Crutcher. I do not have dates of death for either Sidney M. Whitaker or his wife Adeline Ivins Whitaker, but the 1900 Madison County, Kentucky census shows Sidney (Widowed) living in the household of his daughter, Mollie, her husband George Singer, and her children, so he died sometime after 1900. Adeline was last found in the 1870 census, so presumably passed away sometime between 1870 and 1900. More research is needed. Note: Sidney M. Whitaker* served in the Civil War, Union Army, 11th Kentucky Cavalry, Company A, along with his brother John Martin Whitaker* and their first-cousin James Milton Whitaker (son of Irvine Whitaker and Tabitha Jane Moberly Whitaker).\n\n4) Irvine Whitaker* (1839-1919), married Nancy B. Caudle (1846-1922) in Madison County, Kentucky, on January 10, 2865; with children: (1) William M \"Willie\" Whitaker (1866-1915), married to Julia A. Agee Whitaker Moberly, with children: Austin Whitaker, Burton Whitaker, Grace Whitaker Elswick, and Eva F. Whitaker Whitaker; (2) George Whitaker (1868-?), married to Martha Hollins in 1888 in Madison County, Kentucky, but no further information on either of them; (3) Nancy M (\"Nannie\") Whitaker Clark, married to Felix C. Clark (1867-1928), with children: Bessie Clark, Tommie Clark, Walter Clark, Nora Clark Smith, Emma Clark Young, and Coleman Clark; (4) Charles \"Charlie\" Whitaker (1873-1950), married to Ida B. Short, with children: Maud Whitaker, Willie Whitaker, and Gilbert Lee Whitaker; (5) Fountain J. \"Fount\" Whitaker (1874-1945), married 1st to Elizabeth Nora Million (1873-1893), with daughter Gracie Whitaker; married 2nd to Sallie Ann Agee (1886-1973), with children: Pearl J. Whitaker Edgington, Willie Price Whitaker, Joe Whitaker, Carl B. Whitaker, and Elizabeth Whitaker; and (6) Brutus Whitaker (1881-1927), married to Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Whitaker (1886-1947), with children: Hattie Whitaker McMillan, Mossie Whitaker Miller, Russell Stanley Whitaker, Robert Whitaker, John Ivan Whitaker, Winifred Whitaker Coffey, Nannie Margaret Whitaker Bryant, Infant Son Whitaker, Maude Helen Whitaker Davis, and Mollie Frances Whitaker Gray . Note: *Irvine Whitaker served in Co K, 1st Kentucky Cavalry, Union Army during the Civil War. Family lore says he was working in the fields when approached by soldiers on horses who told him he was enlisting and coming with them. His brother Johnson Whitaker (born 1843) and their first-cousin Thomas J Whitaker (born 1843, son of Irvine & Tabitha Moberly Whitaker) also served in the same regiment and company.\n\n5) John Martin Whitaker* (1841-1911), married Elizabeth \"Betty\" Wilder (1854-1951), with children: (1) William M. Whitaker (1872-1911), found in the 1900 Madison County, Kentucky census living in his parents' household, with no other information except that in his father's April 26, 1911 newspaper obituary, only two surviving children are listed (Sally and John Marion), thus it can be concluded that John Martin Whitakers' firstborn son, William M. Whitaker, had already died; (2) Sally A. Whitaker Williams (1874-1942), born in Madison County, Kentucky, married at age 41 in 1915 in Collin County, Texas, to Taylor Edward Williams; no children; and (3) John \"Johnnie\" Marion Whitaker (1884-1958), in 1905 to Eva Lee Rhodus, with children: Willie Mae Whitaker, Luther Daniel Whitaker, Emmett A. Whitaker, Edgar Thomas Whitaker, Buford B. Whitaker, Sr., and John Alvin Whitaker. Note: *John Martin Whitaker served in the Civil War, Union Army, 11th Kentucky Cavalry, Company A. along with his brother Sidney Whitaker and their first-cousin, James Milton Whitaker.\n\n6) Thomas Whitaker (born about 1842). Note: This is NOT the same person as Thomas J. Whitaker who served in the Civil War on the Union side in the 1st Kentucky Cavalry. THAT Thomas J. Whitaker was a son of Irvine and Tabitha Moberly Whitaker. THIS Thomas Whitaker was a son of Marcus Aurelius and Mourning Ham Whitaker. This Thomas Whitaker can be found at age 8 in his parents' household in the 1850 Madison County, Kentucky census. He is NOT listed in the 1860 census with his parents. He may have died, or perhaps he had left home since he was near 18 years of age. Note: I found two possible traces of him, but cannot be sure that either actually are \"our\" Thomas Whitaker, but I list them here just in case they are. (1) 1862: A THOMAS WHITAKER enlisted in the CONFEDERATE Army in Chapel Hill, Durham County, North Carolina. More research is needed to know if this is OUR Thomas Whitaker, but ours disappeared from Madison County Kentucky prior to the 1860 census, so this is a possibility. Other Whitaker men served during the Civil War on the side of the North. If this is \"our\" Thomas who served on the side of the South, that could explain why he never returned \"home.\" (2) 1885 Federal Census, Harbine Precinct, Thayer County, Nebraska, USA. This COULD be our Thomas J. Whitaker, listed as age 40, and listed as born in Kentucky. More research is needed on both of these possibilities.\n\n7) Johnson Whitaker* (1843-1889). Note: This Johnson Whitaker, son of Marcus Aurelius and Mourning Ham Whitaker, is not Johnson M. \"Duff\" Whitaker (1843-1917), son of James Harvey Whitaker and Sarah/Sally Byrum Whitaker. THIS Johnson Whitaker can be found in the 1850 and 1860 Madison County, Kentucky census in the household of his father, Marcus Aurelius Whitaker. I have found no marriage record for him, but he served in the Civil War, Union Army, 1st Kentucky Cavalry, Company K, under Col. Frank Wolford, along with his brother Irvine Whitaker and their first-cousin Thomas J. Whitaker (son of Irvine Whitaker & Tabitha Moberly Whitaker). As far as when this Johnson Whitaker died, I don't have a date; however, in 1889, his mother \"Mourning Whitaker\" applied for his Civil War Pension, leading me to believe that Johnson had passed away before that. Then in 1896, his father, \"Mark Whitaker\" applied for the same Civil War Pension, which leads me to believe that Mark's wife Mourning had died before 1896, and that does go along with Mark being listed as Widowed in the 1900 census.\n\n8) Eliza Whitaker Ball, (born June 1844), born in Madison County, Kentucky, found in the 1850, 1860, and 1870 Madison County Kentucky federal census living in the home of her parents with siblings; on August 16, 1880, in Madison County, Kentucky, at age 36, Eliza Whitaker married Joseph Haskell Ball (born about 1850), with children: (1) Sarah Nancy Jane \"Nannie\" Ball Hawley (1885-1963), married to John Taylor Hawley with children: Edwin E. Hawley, Luella Hawley Evans, Mable Hawley Martz, and Wendall Hawley; (2) John Ball (born 1886), and (3) Lucy Ball (born 1890). Note: See below under \"Margaret Whitaker Ball, Joseph Haskell Ball was first married to Eliza's sister Margaret. Haskell Ball was born in Lee County, Virginia. I do not know why he left Virginia and moved to Kentucky where he met and married the Whitaker sisters. In census records, he was found living in Lee County, Virginia, in 1850, 1860, and 1870. In 1871, he married Margaret Whitaker in Madison County, Kentucky. He continued living in that county in Kentucky where it appears all of his children were born. His occupation in most census records was listed as \"Farm Labor,\" including the 1880 Madison County, Kentucky, census where he was listed with his son Arthur, age 9. This census listing does not include baby Hugh Ball (born December 1879), nor his Hugh listed with his Whitaker grandparents along with Arthur and Cordelia. If I had to guess, I would imagine he was living with Marcus and Mourning Whitaker with his older brother and sister, but that census only lists Mark, Mourning, Arthur, and Cordelia. I failed to find Eliza Whitaker in the 1880 census; however, so wonder if she could have been staying with her brother-in-law, Joseph Haskell Ball to care for the baby, Hugh, and the census taker neglected to list her or the baby. That mystery will remain. Of course, there is no 1890 census to check, but the 1900 census finds Joseph Ball (age 50), Liza Ball (age 55), Nancy Ball (age 14), John 13, and Lucy Ball (age 10) all living in Lee County, Virginia, where Joseph's occupation is listed as \"Teamster.\"\n\n9) Frances Ann \"Fanny\" Whitaker - see below (Aug 1847 - 1924).\n\n10) Margaret Whitaker Ball (1849-Feb. 1880), born about 1849 in Madison County, Kentucky, was found living with parents and siblings in that county in the 1850, 1860, and 1870 federal census. On July 18, 1871, Margaret, age 22, married: Joseph Haskel Ball (born about 1850), with children: (1) Arthur Ball (1872-1923), married to Frances Cooley, with children: William Henry Ball, Margaret \"Maggie\" Ball Wardlow, Ollie Ball, Nannie Ball, Woods Ball, Sallie Ball, and Virgie Ball; (2) Infant Female Ball (1874), (3) Infant Male Ball (1875) (4) Cordelia Ball (born 1876), and (5) Hugh Ball (1879-1960), married 1st to Hattie B. Marcum, with children: Nellie H. Ball and Fred White Ball; married 2nd to Lula Smith. Margaret Whitaker Ball gave birth to youngest son, Hugh Ball on Christmas Day (December 25) of 1879, and died just weeks later, in February 1880. The 1880 Madison County, Kentucky census dated June 8, 1880, shows Joseph Ball, age 30, with 9-year-old son Arthur Ball, living in the Kirksville Precinct, but Arthur Ball, age 9, and his sister Cordelia Ball, age 4, are also both noted to be listed in the household of their grandparents, \"Mornen,\" (sic) which should be \"Mourning\" Whittaker, age 66 and \"Martin,\" (sic) which should be \"Marcus/Mark\" Whittaker, age 65, in the Buckeye Precinct of Madison County, Kentucky, dated June 14, 1880. Arthur Ball is later found in the 1900 census living in Garrard County, Kentucky with his wife and children. I have not found any reliable documentation for Cordelia Ball after the 1880 census when she was 4 years old, so have no other information about her. Hugh Ball, at age 21, in about 1900 married his wife, Hattie B. Marcum. Note: As noted above, after Margaret's February 1880 death, Joseph Haskell Ball married Margaret's older sister Eliza Whitaker in August of 1880. See the above entry on Eliza Whitaker Ball for further information on Joseph Haskell Ball and his children, both with Margaret and with Eliza.\n\n11) Zachariah Whitaker (1852- ? before 1880), listed in 1860 and 1870 Madison County, Kentucky, census, living with parents and siblings. He was age 18 in the 1870 census, occupation listed as \"Farm Laborer\", but also inserted is a word (no longer used) indicating that he was mentally handicapped. He may have died between 1870 and 1880, as I did not find him in any 1880 census, and I found no other information for him after 1870.\n\n12) Marcus Aurelius \"Reel\" Whitaker (1855-1923), married Margaret J. \"Maggie\" Vandeventer (1858-1936), with children: (1) John Thomas Whitaker (1877-1964), (2) Sherman Whitaker (1879-1905), apparently not married, born and died in Madison County, Kentucky, (3) George Henley Whitaker (1882-1942), married to Sarah \"Sallie\" Whitaker (1874-1930), with children: Loa Berniece Whitaker Campbell, Emma Lee Whitaker (born about 1912), Dorothy Faye Whitaker Howard (1914-1981), James Whitaker (born about 1916), Bissie Whitaker (born about 1917), and Jennie Whitaker (born about 1918); (4) Elizabeth \"Eliza\" \"Lizzie\" Whitaker Whitaker (1886-1947), married to Brutus Whitaker (1881-1927, son of Irvine and Nancy Caudle Whitaker), with children: Hattie Whitaker McMillan, Mossie Whitaker Miller, Russell Stanley Whitaker, Robert Whitaker, John Ivan Whitaker, Winifred Whitaker Coffey, Nannie Whitaker Bryant, Infant Son Whitaker, Maud Helen Whitaker Davis, and Mollie Frances Whitaker Gray; (5) Ella Whitaker Rhodus Williams Bailey Agee (1889-1960), (6) Acie Lee Whitaker (NOT Osie) Williams (1891-1911), (7) Pattie Whitaker (born about 1893), (8) Etta Whitaker (born about 1894), and (9) Shirley Dock Whitaker (1896-1955), married to Nellie Lamb Tuell, with children: Geneva Sue Whitaker Coleman, Joel Burchell \"J.B.\" \"Joe\" Whitaker (1921-1985), and Stanley D. Whitaker (1929-1970).\n\n13) George Whitaker (1856-?), found in 1860 and 1870 Madison County, Kentucky census living with parents and siblings; he married Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Thompson on October 12, 1882 in Madison County, Kentucky; I have found no further information for either George or Lizzie Whitaker. I have wondered whether some of these folks who seem to have \"disappeared\" may have migrated \"West\" or to some other part of the country, leaving no trail, but this is speculation on my part.\n\n1900 - the last documentation I have found for Marcus Aurelius Whitaker, age 86 and listed as \"Widowed,\" was found in the 1900 Garrard County, Kentucky, census, living in the home of son Irvine Whitaker and family.\n\nDate of death for Marcus Aurelius Whitaker is unknown, but after 1900 (see above), probably in either Garrard County or Madison County, Kentucky. His wife, Mourning Ham Whitaker, died sometime before 1900, probably around 1895 or 1896 when her husband Mark Whitaker applied for the Civil War pension she had been receiving since 1889 based on their son Johnson Whitaker's Civil War service. I do not know where either Marcus Aurelius Whitaker or his wife Mourning Ham Whitaker are buried, though presumably somewhere in Madison County, Kentucky.\n\n*CIVIL WAR: (2021 UPDATE) Four sons of Marcus Aurelius Whitaker and Mourning Ham served in the Civil War: (1) Sidney Whitaker and (2) John Martin Whitaker served in Company A, 11th Kentucky Cavalry, Union Army, and (3) Irvine Whitaker and (4) Johnson Whitaker served in Company K, 1st Kentucky Cavalry, Union Army. Two sons of Irvine Whitaker and Tabitha Jane Moberly also served in the Civil War: (1) Thomas J Whitaker served in Company K, 1st Kentucky Cavalry, Union Army and (2) James Milton Whitaker served with Company A, 11th Kentucky Cavalry, Union Army. And finally, one son of James Harvey Whitaker and Sarah Byrum (a first-cousin of the above six men) also served in the Civil War: (1) James Henry Whitaker served in Company A, 11th Kentucky Cavalry, Union Army, along with several of his cousins. Note: the fathers of the seven men listed above: James Harvey Whitaker, Marcus Aurelius Whitaker, and Irvine Whitaker were brothers, all sons of Johnson Whitaker Jr. and Ankey Taylor.\n\n7 - Frances Ann \"Fanny\" Whitaker Goins was born in August 1847 to Marcus Aurelius Whitaker and Mourning Ham.\n\n1847 - born in August in Madison County, Kentucky.\n\n1864 - married William Harrison Goins (1838-1913) on September 27, in Madison County, Kentucky.\n\nTheir children:\n\n1) Lucy Ellen Goins Long (1867-1926), married James A Long (1852-1928), with children: (1) Florence Ida Long Goins(1883-1978), married to Robert \"Bobbie\" Ellis Goins (1884-1971), with children: Mabel Ellis Goins Hoskins, Coleman Kelly Goins, and Hazel B.

A rock with \"Cy Goins\" scratched on it marks his final resting place, although when we were there his and his brother's \"markers\" (rocks) were just strewn about on the ground.\n\n5) Edaline \"Eddy\" \"Dolly\" Goins Isaacs (1876-1958), married Silas M. Isaacs (1872-1930), with children Ollie Frances Isaacs Singer, Collins Isaacs, & Bergson Owen \"Berg\" Isaacs.\n\n6) Benjamin Franklin Goins (1878-1878), I have no information on him; he is believed to have died in infancy.

Tevis (1870-1920), with children Grace Stone Tevis Mason, Benjamin Franklin Tevis, Percy Eugene Tevis, Robert Walker Tevis, and Shirley Hutchenson Tevis.\n\n8) Georgia Ann or Georgeann \"Georgie\" Goins Goins (1888-1908), married Robert Ellis \"Bobbie\" Goins (1884-1971). Note: Per family lore, Georgie killed herself at age 20 while pregnant with her first child. It was said that some of the women in the area had been filling her head full of \"old wives tales\" about having a child with birth defects because she had married her first cousin. A sad family tragedy of two lives ended much too soon.\n\n1924 - Death: Frances Ann \"Fanny\" Whitaker Goins died in Lincoln County, Kentucky in February 1924. Her husband, William Harrison Goins had died on January 3, 1913, at Kirksville, Madison County, Kentucky. Per his death records, he was buried at the Long graveyard at Kirksville (near Cottonburg) in Madison County, Kentucky. Fannie's obituary says she was to be buried \"at Kirksville.\" I believe they are both buried at \"Long's Cemetery,\" which is basically inaccessible and located on a farm off of Poosey Ridge Road in Madison County, Kentucky.\n\nFor further information about the GOINS family, please see the Goins Family Page on this website, and for further information about the HAM family, please see the Ham Family Page.\n\nAppendix 1:\n\nHISTORICAL AND MEMORIAL MARKERS\n\n(Note: The following three markers are located in Harford County, Maryland and are related to Mark Whitaker (1677-1729).\n\nMarke Whiteaker - Mark Whitaker\n\n1677-1729\n\nMarke was christened \"8 Nov 1677 the sonne of Mr. Thomas Whiteakers Junir of Thornhill\" by Dewsbury, Yorkshire England\n\nHe was admitted \"sizar\" to Emmanuel College, Cambridge University, on 27 Nov 1693 and matriculated in 1697.\n\nMark first appears on the 1702 tax rolls of Spesutia Hundred, present day Harford County MD. 3 March 1713 Mark Whitaker, planter, bought from Robert West for \"2500 pounds of good tobacco\" 100 acres in a tract called Westwood.\n\nVestry records say \"1726 by an order to Mark Whitaker for his sallery being Clk of the Vestry.\"\n\nMark died 1 May 1729, his grave is lost to time.\n\nFAMILY\n\nHis estate was valued at 50 pounds and son Thomas inherited his land.
