        "text": "President Joe Biden denied to NBC News anchor Lester Holt Monday that his rhetoric has incited violence, instead repeatedly referring to instances of problematic speech by former President Donald Trump.\n\nMonday night's came at a critical time for Biden as panic over his age and mental acuity grows. The appearance also followed Saturday's attempted assassination of Trump. Biden in the interview his recent call for Trump to be put in a “bullseye” was wrong, but took a defensive tone when discussing the rest of his language toward Trump.\n\n“Have you taken a step back and done a little soul-searching about things you may have said that could incite people who are not balanced?” Holt asked.\n\n“How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real?” Biden countered. “When a president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything because it may incite somebody?”\n\nLook, I have not engaged in that rhetoric,” he added. “Now, my opponent has engaged in that rhetoric.”\n\nREAD MORE |\n\nBiden continued by pointing out Trump’s infamous “ ” remark and his support for Jan. 6 rioters. The president also aired his grievances with the media for its coverage of his debate performance and alleged mental decline, arguing it overshadowed many of Trump’s false claims made on the debate stage.\n\nWhy don’t you guys ever talk about the 18— the 28 lies he told?” Biden asked. “Where are you on this? Why didn’t the press ever talk about this?”\n\nThe tense interview also followed Biden’s for Americans to “cool it down” regarding tense political rhetoric surrounding the election.\n\nJackson Walker on X at @_jlwalker_ for the latest trending national news.
