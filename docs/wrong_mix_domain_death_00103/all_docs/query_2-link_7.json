        "text": "Andrew Jackson died at the Hermitage on June 8, 1845, and was buried two days later in a garden tomb next to his wife, Rachel. As news of his death spread via mounted couriers, riverboats, and newspapers, communities around the country spontaneously organized funeral processions, eulogies, and other solemnities to mark the former president’s passing. In New York City, businesses closed and four hundred thousand people paid their respects as a five-mile-long funeral procession wound its way through the streets; some spectators climbed trees for a better view. The national outpouring of grief for a fallen hero provided an occasion for new artistic interpretations of Jackson on memorial ribbons, prints, and other objects."
