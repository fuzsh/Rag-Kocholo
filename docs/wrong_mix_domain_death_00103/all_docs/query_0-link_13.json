        "text": "As we commemorate Black History Month, it's essential to reflect on the narratives that shape our understanding of American history. One such narrative is the prominent placement of Andrew Jackson on the twenty-dollar bill, a controversial figure whose legacy stands in stark contrast to that of his predecessor, John Quincy Adams. To understand this disparity, we must delve into the realm of Critical Race Theory.\n\nAndrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams, both consequential presidents, were at the helm during a time when the United States was grappling with profound moral challenges. Yet, their legacies and their treatment in American history tell two drastically different stories.\n\nJackson, a slaveholder, committed war crimes, masterminded the tragic Trail of Tears, oversaw the destruction of the Negro Fort and the murder of over 200 Africans, and even killed a man in a duel. Despite this, he is often portrayed as a heroic figure in American history.\n\nIn contrast, John Quincy Adams, an unapologetic abolitionist, fought tirelessly to end slavery. He famously defended the Africans who revolted and seized the Spanish ship Amistad, advocating for their freedom in the Supreme Court. Yet, his contributions are often overshadowed or minimized in our history books.\n\nThis discrepancy is not accidental. It's a manifestation of systemic racism embedded in our educational systems. These systems often compel children to admire figures like Jackson, despite his horrific actions, while downplaying the contributions of white abolitionists like Adams. This distortion of history can be harmful to both Black and White students, shaping their understanding of race, power, and justice in problematic ways.\n\nCritical Race Theory provides a lens through which we can critique and challenge these narratives. It teaches us to reframe history honestly, acknowledging America's racist past while also highlighting anti-racism as a core American value. It pushes us to question why a man like Jackson is celebrated on our most popular bill, while the legacy of Adams languishes in relative obscurity.\n\nAs we reflect on Black History Month, let's also reflect on the narratives we perpetuate about our shared history. Why do we continue to glorify a figure like Andrew Jackson, and what message does that send to our children? What would it mean to grow up seeing Adams on the twenty-dollar bill instead of Jackson?\n\nThis would not only be symbolic of acknowledging America's racist past, but it would also signal a commitment to anti-racism as a core American value. It would remind us that there are figures in our history, like Adams, who stood against the tide of racism and fought for justice. And it would serve as a powerful reminder that we can, and should, do the same.\n\nAs long as Jackson remains on our most widely circulated bill, we're reminded that America often justifies the actions of racists rather than illuminating anti-racist actions. It's time we reevaluate the narratives we uphold and take tangible steps towards an honest, inclusive understanding of our history."
