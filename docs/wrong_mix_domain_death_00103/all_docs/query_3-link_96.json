        "text": "The UK‚Äôs grid electricity mix for the last 28 days. Huge progress has been made over the past 15 years by phasing out coal (the black square) almost entirely, however phasing out the remaining gas turbines will be more complicated. Along with meeting the total demand, the electrical grid must load match and regulate frequency. Historically this has been done by using ‚Äòdespatchable‚Äô power sources like gas turbines which can ramp up and down quickly to match demand and provide spinning reserves to regulate frequency. Low carbon sources of electricity are more suited to ‚Äòbase load‚Äô application (e.g. nuclear) or are uncontrolled (e.g. solar and wind) and can‚Äôt fulfill this function. So what are the solutions? 1. Demand-side management. Through dynamic tariffs with cheaper off peak electricity to encourage users to change behaviours and support the use of active smart meters. 2. Load shedding infrastructure. To allow the grid to switch off non-essential circuits during peak times (this is already mandatory in California on commercial developments). 3. More electricity storage. Either at grid level in the form of large pumped hydro schemes or building level in the form or batteries. #decarbonisation #energy #engineering [Image credit: mygridgb.co.uk]\n\nWhy is the electrification of heating important? Since its peak in 2007 the #carbon intensity of the UK electricity grid has reduced by approximately 2/3 as more renewables have been brought online. This means that buildings heated by #electric heat pumps have been progressively reducing their operational carbon year on year and now have a significantly lower carbon footprint than those heated by gas boilers, so this is a critical step on the road to #netzero When approaching a new project in any country it is crucial to understand the nature and future trajectory of the utility networks that will serve the development.

Design interventions ranging from pocket parks and accessible lobbies to museums and public artworks all with the aim of making the City welcoming and engaging for all. Despite working in the City daily I wasn‚Äôt aware of most of these gifts to the public and came away wanting to visit many of them. Perhaps an interactive map is needed to connect these places to people!\n\nüìØ City of London Summit 2024: Session 1 The Future of the City üìØ A very interesting talk from Ross Sayers of Landsec on development priorities for the coming year with a slightly more optimistic take on the market than we have seen in the construction press recently which was very welcome. Also nice to see Cundall projects 21 Moorfields and New Street square up on screen! It occurred to me during the subsequent panel discussion that the design of the modern workplace perhaps isn‚Äôt evolving as fast as we think it is. The basic template for the current trend of environmentally conscious, amenity rich offices with exterior space and transparent open plan working was arguably laid down by Foster‚Äôs Willis Faber building as far back as the 1970s. However, my colleague Frances Brown pointed out that the big evolution is that these traits are now virtually ubiquitous in grade-A speculative office rather than an outlier in the owner occupier space. So what will office 3.0 will look like? Some clues in the second session of the day that perhaps it‚Äôs not restricted to the office itself as a singular, insular entity but in how it interacts with, activates, and enhances its surroundings.\n\nInteresting morning at the NLA hearing about the outlook for tall buildings in #London in the next decade. . The City Plan 2040 sets us up for a slight evolution of the existing city cluster but it will be interesting to see the evolution of the new Fleet Valley tall buildings area. It is significantly lower than the existing city cluster being capped at 90m rather than 300m but will still allow a significant second peak to the west of St Paul‚Äôs.\n\nIs there anything more terrifying than a blank sheet of paper? . Many engineers struggle with early stage building design because engineering training focuses on problem solving more than creative design. . For me the solution came from Charles Eames who defined design as the ‚Äòsum of all constraints‚Äô and said ‚ÄúHere is one of the few effective keys to the Design problem: the ability of the Designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible; his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints.‚Äù . Starting the design process by analysing the constraints identifies opportunities and frames the design process as a problem to be solved which is much more comfortable territory for most engineers. . #environmental #engineering #design\n\nWhat‚Äôs behind the dramatic increase in #refurbishment projects in the #London office market? . Cundall have long been active in the prime commercial sector in London and over the last 5 years we‚Äôve seen a huge increase in deep #retrofit / #decarbonisation projects. What are the drivers for this trend? . 1, Planning policy. The London Plan (adopted in 2021) requires that all developments carry out a Whole Life-cycle Carbon (WLC) assessment considering embodied carbon and prepare a Circular Economy statement. Both elements aim to encourage retention of existing building stock. . 2, The market. Most tenants taking prime office space in London have made their own net zero #carbon commitments which include their scope 3 emissions. Consequently, they are asking much tougher questions of agents and choosing properties with the best sustainability credentials. . 3, SFDR regulations (introduced in 2021) require that all investment funds disclose their #sustainability credentials. Funds which invest in prime real estate are imposing much tougher targets on developers as part of the strategic development brief. . #design #engineering #construction\n\nSo we have a new Prime Minister... but what does it mean for the construction sector? . One key part of the Labour manifesto is the New Towns Code. This has many provisions but for me the more intriguing parts are: 1, The emphasis on \"Buildings with character\", in \"tree-lined streets\" incorporating \"design that pays attention to local history and identity\". An emphasis on quality design is a very welcome antidote to the current blandemic, however, I really hope this doesn't become a Trojan Horse for the introduction of regressive imitation historical design (mock Tudor anyone? ü§¢ ) 2, The introduction of grey belts to ease planning difficulties in semi-rural areas which have historically been a roadblock to housing development. This will apparently be done by reclassifying \"low-quality\" areas of Green Belt land for development. Undoubtedly this will be opposed by environmental groups and local residents in what are predominantly traditional Conservative areas so it won't be straightforward. . However it plays out it looks like interesting times ahead! . #housing #construction #engineering #design"
