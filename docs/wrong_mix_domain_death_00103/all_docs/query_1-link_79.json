        "text": "In August 1876 wire ropes were pulled from the Brooklyn to the Manhattan side. The ropes were made of twisted steel strands and were about three-quarters of an inch thick and more than a thousand feet long. The rope was attached to a hemp rope which pulled the wire rope up the Brooklyn tower. The other end of the rope was towed by scow to the Manhattan side, the wire sinking to the bottom of the river. After a long delay before the river was clear of traffic and no boats were about to pass the wire was pulled up on the Manhattan tower. The first wire was left hanging across the river about two hundred feet above the water. This was repeated with a second rope. The two ropes were spliced to form a \"traveler\". Brooklyn and Manhattan were joined!! Master Mechanic E. F. Farrington 60 yeas old, was the first person who crossed the river. He started across from Brooklyn to Manhattan about 22 minutes after one o'clock on August 25 in a boatswains' chair. There are multiple images of this crossing on line.\n\nA second traveler was set up and the two travelers were used to bring more and more wires from one side of the river to the other. Next a wooden foot bridge was built from tower to tower.\n\nMore ropes were lashed to the traveler and moved along from one side to the other. The lashing had to be cut loose by hand with a knife. This was done by riggers sitting in a boatswains chair (little more than a swing on a hook). There were four men cutting the lashings On August 26, 1876. One man started from the top of each tower going towards the anchorage and one man form the top of the tower going towards the middle of the river. Cohne (Korner) started first going from the Booklyn tower towards the anchorage. Henry (Harry) Supple accomplished this with great flair but others got hung up as they tired to move along the ropes. In addition to Henry Supple who died in an accident in 1878 (see above) several riggers were named in the Chief's report on the bridge: William Kohrner (Cohne), a German, Patrick Timbs, an Englishman, Thomas Carroll an Englishman, on the first rope and William Miller, Frederick Arnold, James O'Neil (see James O'Neil under the injured) and E. F. Farrington on the second rope.\n\nRiggers Harry Supple, William Kohrner, Frederick Arnold, James O'Neill, William Miller, Patrick Timbs and Thomas Carrol were all sailors who had never done rigging quite like bringing the cables across the Brooklyn Bridge towers.\n\nIn 1883 it was stated that the daily wage of a rigger was $2.00 to $2.50.The were paid less than stone cutters, masons and carpenters who made a dollar a day morre.\n\nCohne (Kohrner/Korner), William - a German, rigger 1876 (c 1839-1898) Spelled: Cohne in the Report of the Chief Engineer and in the newspaper reports of the unlashing of the cables - \"Kohrne\" by McCollough and in the news report in the Brooklyn Union August 26, 1876 - Koenhner in a Brooklyn Eagle article about the riggers cutting the lashings.\n\n1875: Brooklyn Ward 2, Sands Street, 4 family frame house, William Cohne 36, rigger born Germany, Hannah Cohne 35, wife, born Brooklyn, Hortense Hura 50, mother in law, born New Jersey, seamstress\n\n1876: Brooklyn Union - William Kohrner, a rigger, in the employ of the bridge was one of the men to cut the lashings with sceath knife.\n\n1880: Brooklyn, 68 Prospect street, William Cohn 40, rigger born Oldenburg, \"Augusta\" Cohn 40, born New York, father born Conn, mother born NJ, \"Angela\" Hurt 60, mother in law, born N J, father born Italy, mother born NY and a boarder.\n\n1881-1889: William Cohne 68 Prospect Occupation: Rigger Publication Title: Brooklyn, New York, City Directory, 1889\n\nIn August 1876 Willam Cohne was in one of the first group of riggers cutting the lashings as the wires were drawn across the bridge. The feat of riding in a boatswains's chair along the travler rope and cutting the lashings, which held the new wire to the travler, was watched by hundred of spectators on the ground. The press extensively covered the activities. Some of the riggers, like Harry Supple, became momentary heros and the crowds watched with awe and anticipation as the men made their way across the wire, dangling high in the air. William Cohne was portrayed as portly and slow - taking much longer than the other riggers to cut the lashings. In the news papers his name was spelled with such a large number of variations one cannot help but wonder if this did not reflect an anti German sentiment.\n\n\"Korner\" was observed by a reporter through a telescope - \"his progress was slow and laborious, and from the expression on his face was evidently hard work.\" He was suspended 200 feet in the air sitting on a board without being lashed into the seat.

Said by McCullough to have been a \"huge, portly man\" - \"well over 200 pounds\". McCullough also depicted Carroll as an Englishman, not very competent, running into trouble on the wire, having difficulty cutting the lashings and needing to be rescued by other riggers. Thomas Carrol was born in Ireland.\n\nBrooklyn Union Aug 27, 1876 - Thomas Carroll, wire worker, was one of the men who cut the lashings.\n\nMultiple news articles tell the story of Thomas Carroll getting stuck midway out over the river.\n\nThe Scientific American August 4, 1877 Thomas Carroll was descried as a \"portly\" Englishman who fought in the Crimean War and helped lay the Atlantic cable.

He said that on Monday (August 27, 1876) William Miller went from the New York Tower to the New York anchorage cutting lashes in seven and a half minutes - faster than Harry Supple who had made the run in 10 minutes.\n\nThe Brooklyn Daily Eagle of 29, August 1876 - Another wire crosses - the last section of the second working rope - CUTTING THE LASHINGS - Mr. E. A. Farrington, Fred Arnold, James O'Neil, and William Miller between the New York tower and the anchorage.\n\nIn February 1877 the Chief Engineer Farrington spoke to a reporter about the men he most trusted on bridge. He mentioned William Miller as an experienced rigger.\n\nThere are 40 William Millers listed in the 1876 Brooklyn Directory. None of them is listed as a rigger.\n\nMiller and O'Neil went off from the New York Tower on August 29. Each man had a 150 foot rope attached to him to prevent them from going down too fast on the steep incline at the start.\n\nBurwick/Berwick, Robert Rooke (c 1830-1904) - foreman 1877 - Robert Berwick was listed as a foreman at death of Neil Mullen in 1877. The Brooklyn Eagle reported that \"Robert\" Berwick the \"boss mason\" had three men putting finishing touches on one of the upper arches about 20 feet from the ground. Suddenly he saw a crack in the arch. He ordered his men to get down. They had barely reached safety when the arch fell. Unfortunately, Neil Mullen had not heard the order and was buried under a pile of masonry. See Mullen above.\n\nBeriwck was questioned about the work he had been supervising. He stated that the arch was all but completeted when it fell. There had not been any problems with a dozen or so other arches that had been built. Robert bErwich stood and watcched the tower for a hour after the accident. When he determined there was no further danger he went to inspect.\n\nRobert Berwick was born in Ireland according to his naturalization papers March 27, 1863 in the Superior Court in Norwalk, Connecticut. 1855: 4th Ward, 4 family frame, Buricke Robert R, age 25 born England mason, Ann E Burwick wife born NY.

Final Year, 1868. George Washington McNulty, of New York City, is a native of the city, born September 6, 1851, son of Isaac and Sarah Cornelia (Stillwell) McNulty. He is of mingled Scotch-Irish and English ancestry. His paternal ancestor settled in Pennsylvania about 1738, and his maternal ancestors served with Cromwell, and came to America after the destruction of the monarchy under Charles II. Descendants of these parental stocks fought in the French and Indian War, Revolutionary War. War of 1812, and in the Civil War.\n\nGeorge W. McNulty was educated in the Freehold Institute, at Freehold, New Jersey, and at the New York Polytechnic Institute. In 1867 and 1868 he was a student of Civil Engineering in the University of Virginia. He began his professional career as an employe of the Road Board of Essex County, New Jersey. In 1870 he became a member of the engineering staff of Colonel Washington A. Roebling, who succeeded his father, John A. Roebling, as Chief Engineer of the great East River Bridge, connecting New York City and Brooklyn. Major McNulty had been engaged in surveying until this time, but he was an enthusiastic student of all pertaining to engineering. To him was committed some very difficult branches of the bridge building work, and his success gained for him the unqualified approbation of his superiors and associates. He occupied his position until the completion of the Bridge in 1884, and from that time until 1890 was associated with L. L. Buck, Chief Engineer of the new East River Bridge, in bridge building work. He was Chief Engineer of the New York Metropolitan Street Railway Company from 18-- to 1895, when he became connected with the railway building firm of Naughton & Company, an association which is yet maintained, his duties having been in part in connection with the rapid transit subway construction in New York City. Major McNulty was during 1890 to 1891 a trustee of the Xew York and Brooklyn Bridge. He is a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, which body lie has served in the capacity of director; and of the Engineer's Club, the New York Athletic Club, the Atlantic Yacht Club, the Democratic Club, Manhattan Club, and the Hardware Club. He was from 1880 to 1885 Engineer Officer, with the rank of Major, of the Fifth Brigade, New York National Guard.\n\nHe married Miss Florence Moutarn, and two children have been born of their union, a daughter, Florence, and a son, George W., Jr. (University of Virginia: Its History, Influence, Equipment and ..., Volume 2)\n\nFlaherty, Michael, foreman at death of Neil Mullen in December 1877\n\n1877: Brooklyn Daily Eagle February 5, 1878\n\n\"The injury to the pier happened in this manner: In raising the stone, which weighed about two tons, to its place, originally, it was found not to be in its proper position, and it became necessary to raise it again from the pier, in order to reset it. In doing so it dragged along the top of the pier, carrying away tome of the brick. The stone was swung on a fall from the end of a derrick, which was from seven to ten feet short of the pier, and was raised on this occasion without the slack of the guy used to bring it to its place being taken in. Dragging in consequence, first in the manner mentioned, along the pier, it oscillated toward the boom as it fell off, and in its rebound came against the pier about two feet below the top, with a violent blow. As the pier, however, remained apparently firm in its place, no injury beyond the displacement of the few bricks was supposed by the workmen to have ensued, and no report of the blow was made to Mr. McNulty, the Engineer in charge.\n\n\"The stone was raised from the pier, in thiis seemingly unskillful way, by reason of a misapprehension of the order given by the foreman engaged in resetting the stone, to the engineer who was running the two drums, one for the fall attached to the derrick, and the other to the guy used for the purpose of bringing the stone forward to its place. The order given by the foreman, Michael Flaherty, was to, \"take it in,\" meaning to take'in the slack of the guy, which had been loosened when the stone was first lowered into place. The engineer, Edward S. Gutenez, understood the order to be to take up the stone, and accordingly put the strain on the foil of the derrick and not upon the guy.\" February 5, 1878 BDE\n\n1880: Michael O Flaherty 40, stone mason born Ireland, Margarat O Flaherty 40, born Ireland cannot read and write, William O Flaherty 14, born England, Daniel O Flaherty 12, born England, Annie O Flaherty 6, born NY James O Flaherty 8m, born NY\n\n1881: March 9, 1881\n\nAn Employee of the Bridge company Charged with Abandoning his wife.\n\nThe examination in the case of Michael Flaherty, a foreman in the employment of the Brooklyn Bridge Company, who was sued by his wife, Margaret Flaherty, for abandonment, was held this afternoon, before Justice Walsh. The complainant is a middle-aged respectable lookling woman, and is spoken of by her friends as hard working and industrious. She testified that she resided, at No. 140 Raymond street, with her four children, aged 14, 13 and 7 years, and 18 months, respectively, and that she had been abandoned by her husband in August last. During the past six weeks he had not given her and her children any support whatever. Up to within a few weeks she kept a little grocery and candy store, but the cares of her family obliged her to give it up. She had heard her husband say that his salary was $5 a day.\n\nThe defendant admitted the abandonment but said that he had given his wife money from time to time for her support. Last May he had given her $100 and in August $47. He ademitted he had given her no money during the past six weeks. He refused to tell wheat his present address was; his present salary was forty cents and hour, and he generally worked ten hous each day.\n\n1882: July 20, A degree of seperation was granted in a limited divorce agreement between Michael Flaherty and his wife, Margaret. Michael was a well known contractor, a mason who done some \"heavy jobs\". He had worked on the East River Bridge. In 1882 he had a contract with the new Produce Exchange. He had married Margaret in England in 1845. They came to the States circa 1869 with their four children, three boys and a girl the eldest of which was 15 years old in 1882. Margaret alleged that starting about 1877 Michale beat and abused her and about 1880 had abandoned her. She said he rapped her on the top of the head with his knuckles so it would not leave a mark. He would hit her until she became unconscious. Michael, of course, denied all of this and claimed that Margaret had been treating HIM \"cruelly and brutally\" biting and scratching him and calling him foul names, destroying his wearing apparel. Life with her was unbearable. He wanted a seperation. Margaret was granted custody of the children.\n\n1883:\n\nMargaret Flaherty brought suit in the Supreme Court against her husband. Michael Flaherty, a stone-mason, residing in New York, for a limited divorce on the ground of inhuman treatment. The Court ordered him to pay her $9 a week alimony, which he has not done. This morning Mr. J. M. Pearsall on behalf of the wife applied to Justice Cullen in the Special Term of the Supreme Court for an order of arrest against the husband for contempt of court. The order was granted.\n\n1883: Friday May 11, The suit of Margaret Flaherty against her husband Michale continued in an attempt to punish Michale for comtempt of court. A degree of separation had been granted and Michael was ordered to pay alimony. He was $350 behind. He lived on 14th street, NYC. She lived on Henry street, Brooklyn.\n\nJuly 11, 1883: Micael Flaherty, a stone mason, was ordered to pay his estranged wife, Margaret, $9 per week in alimony. But he had not done that. An order was issued for his arrest for contempt of court.\n\n1883, August 15: The order of arrest was vacated as Michael Flahery was detained in jail for failure to pay alimony to his wife, \"Mary\". He wanted to appeal.\n\n1883: August 18, Michael Flaherty was in the Raymond street jail for non-payment of alimony in a suit brought by his wife \"Mary\".

FARRINGTON, son of Asahel and Henrietta (Fisher) Farrington, was born Oct. 25, 1820, in the \"southwest room of the old Otis Fairbanks house,\" which formerly stood on the road from West Medway to the Village. His maternal grand-parents, Leonard and Betsey Fisher, resided for years on the borders of Franklin. Their bodies rest in the old burying-ground in West Medway. They originally came from Wrentham, as did his paternal grand-parents. Mrs. Henrietta Farrington, his mother, resided, during the later years of her life, in West Medway, and became a member of the Congregational Church in that place, but died in 1846, in Warren, Mass. \"Incompatibility of temper\" caused an early separation between Asahel and Henrietta Farrington, and the guardianship of Edmund was assigned to his mother, who returned to her father's house. Asahel settled in one of the northern towns in New Hampshire, married again and became the father of nine sons and daughters. He finally died at an advanced age in Lyndon, Vt. Some years before his death he became a Methodist lay preacher.\n\nEdmund Farrington in early life was frail in body, bashful and retiring in disposition, imaginative and unstable in mind. A few summers and winters in the district school and one term at Leicester Academy sufficed him for schooling in \"book learning.\" The hand of poverty was ever upon him. In his tenth year he was \"put out\" on the farm of Sanford Ware, in Franklin. After one season of farming we find him making cotton wadding with A. M. B. Fuller, in what is now known as Daniels' box factory, in North Franklin. Subsequently he worked for Hiram Metcalf, making stocking yarn in the same building, and a year or two more as card stripper and piecer in White's and Gills' factories. At the age of eighteen he began to learn the carpenter trade. He afterward worked for \"Boss Daniels\" at boot making, having been instructed by William H. Temple. Leaving Medway in 1839, he went on a whaling voyage from New Bedford, was left in the Azore Islands, shipped from there to the coast of Africa; thence to Brazil, and coming up to the West Indies, he ran away in San Domingo, whence, after a sojourn of several weeks, he shipped and worked his passage to Boston in the brig \"Sea Eagle.\" Soon after his return from sea he joined the Fourier Association at Brook Farm, West Roxbury. Here he became acquainted with such men as Ripley, Dana, Parker, and Greeley, and became dimly conscious that he had a mind and a soul, and that there might be a place and a work for him in the world. At Brook Farm he learned last making, which he followed in Boston, Maiden, Lynn, and Danvers, Mass., and in Gardiner, Me. In Lynn he edited for a time a paper called The Forum. He contributed also to various papers at different times and rode the \"lecture hobby\" with some success. He took up gas and steam fitting in Portland, and superintended gas works in Gardiner, Me.\n\nHe married in 1847, in Lowell, Mass., Miss Emma A. Smiley, of Gardiner, with whom he led a happy life until her death in 1880. They had four children, but only a son and a daughter survive. In Lowell he assisted to build and fit up the large carpet mill, and afterward went to Chicago and engaged in building. He returned to Poughkeepsie, N. Y., where he remained for eighteen years, engaged mostly in contracting and building. He removed to New York and followed the same business, but failed in it during the first years of the war.\n\nWhile looking over a scrap of The New York Herald, in which a workman had brought a lunch, he saw an advertisement for a master carpenter on the Covington and Cincinnati suspension bridge. He answered this advertisement, was accepted and spent nearly three years in the position, mastering meantime all the mysteries of the business. He was next appointed superintendent of construction on the new suspension bridge at Niagara Falls, where he remained a year. He afterwards erected two suspension bridges over the Delaware River, between New York and Pennsylvania, at Hancock and Lordville.\n\nHe was called to East River Bridge in 1870, and placed in charge of the wood work of that structure, to which was soon added the iron work, and finally the wire work, when he was installed master mechanic. He remained on this bridge twelve years and four months, when he retired July 31, 1882, on account of failing health. While on this work he went through the operations of sinking the caissons safely; got over all the temporary wire ropes and erected the foot-bridge after his own plans; and first crossed the space from one anchorage to the other in a \"boatswain's chair,\" attached to the smallest of all the ropes. He erected the machinery for cable making, made the cables and suspended a large portion of the superstructure, and inspected and prepared the lumber for the roadway. No other individual had any previous knowledge of suspension bridge building except Col. W. A. Roebling, Engineer in Chief, and for nine years this gentleman was unable to visit the work, or to give it proper personal attention, so that the burden fell on Mr. Farrington. How well he bore it and how patiently, in face of the intrigues of place-seekers and the opposition of assistant engineers, arising from professional jealousy, the completed work and the encomiums of the public, who watched him in its daily progress testify. When he left the bridge, little remained but routine work to be done and men who had grown up under his instruction remained to do it. Mr. Farrington retired in 1882 to his native town to recuperate, where he remained until 1884, when he returned to New York to engage in new enterprises. Mr. Farrington's townsmen have reason to feel somewhat of pride and gratification in the success of one born among them who was a weak, friendless child, thrown on the world and his own resources at an early age, drifting for years on the tide without chart or compass, but who finally became an esteemed Christian, honored and even famous for his mechanical achievements.\n\nAdditional Comments: THE BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF PROMINENT PERSONS, AND The Genealogical Records OF MANY EARLY AND OTHER FAMILIES IN MEDWAY, MASS. 1713-1886.

Fred Arnold was one of the riggers responsible for cutting the lashings between the travler wire and the cable being crosses. On August 30th, 1876 Fred Arnold and James O'Neil, a fellow rigger, went out on the wrong wires, a serious twist occurred about 600 feet our form the New York side. The two men at stuck and were suspended and left hanging up in the air until things got untangled. Midway across they had to change cables and shift their chairs from one cable to another. James O'Neil was apparently exceptionally cool about the whole thing, acting as if he was about to fall asleep. James O'Neil was later injured when a plank hit him. See James O'Neil in the injured list.\n\nIn February 1877 the Chief Engineer Farrington spoke to a reporter about the men he most trusted on bridge. He mentioned Fred Arnold as an experienced rigger.\n\nTestified in the 1880 suit brought by Edward Hansen. In 1880 at the time of the accident he was assistant foreman rigger, at the time of the trial he was a rigger.\n\n\"Arnold swore that Hoffman worked as a rigger for nine months, and part of the time under him. He never knew of Hoffman having charge of trestle work until a few days before. He told what he knew of the accident.\"\n\n1875: Hudson street, Brooklyn Ward 5, 2 family brick, Frederick Arnold 33, born England laborer, Bridget Arnold 30, born Ireland, Thomas Arnold 2, John Arnold 0\n\n1877: Mary Ann Arnold Birth 25 Nov 1877 Brooklyn, Kings, New York, Gender Female Father's Name Fred.
