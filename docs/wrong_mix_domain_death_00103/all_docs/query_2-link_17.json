        "text": "Andrew Jackson (1767-1845) served as the seventh President of the United States from 1829-1837. Originally born in the Carolinas, Jackson moved to Tennessee where he was a lawyer and politician, being the first person elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Tennessee. Jackson also served in the military, most notably as a general during the War of 1812. Winning the presidential election of 1828, Jackson's administration proved to be a turning point for the country's politics. Coming from Tennessee, Jackson was the first \"frontier\" president from the western part of the country. His aggressive, and at times controversial, personality polarized many politicians, leading to the creation of two new political parties: Democrats (supporters of Jackson) and Whigs (opponents of Jackson). His time in office is noted for his strengthening of the power of the presidency, expanding the spoils system, and abolishing the Electoral College. His tenure began an era that later became known as the \"Era of Jacksonian Democracy.\"\n\nPainting of Andrew Jackson in his military uniform by Ralph E. W. Earl, 1817\n\nAndrew Jackson Bond, 1822 August 30 (MS.2449)\n\nThis collection contains an 1822 bond for a $3,500 suit brought by Bennett Smith against the estate of his son-in-law John Hutchings. From Hutchings, Andrew Jackson's business partner, Smith sought to recover a debt arising over the sale of slaves. Andrew Jackson represented Hutchings' son, Andrew Jackson Hutchings, as guardian in the suit.\n\nAndrew Jackson Inaugural Address Broadside, 1829 March 9 (MS.3365)\n\nThis broadside, published by the Columbia Telescope (S.C.) on 1829 March 9, provides a transcript of the inaugural address that Andrew Jackson delivered on 1829 March 4 in Washington, D.C. In it, Jackson outlines his domestic and foreign policy goals and discusses his intention to stand for the rights of states, limit executive power, handle agriculture, commerce, and manufactures unequivocally, and ensure the fair treatment of the Indians.\n\nAndrew Jackson Letter, 1834 Nov. 11 (MS.3288)\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson wrote this letter to General Callender Irvine from Washington on November 11, 1834. In it, he discusses a horse descended from Bollivar that Irvine has recently sent him.\n\nAndrew Jackson Papers, 1840-1844 (MS.3228)\n\nThe first document housed in this collection is a copy of a legal agreement dated April 1840 between William Donelson, Stockley Donelson and Andrew Jackson detailing the construction of a route from Jones Bend to the Nashville & Lebanon Turnpike through Jackson's land. On the back are Andrew Jackson's comments, dated October 7, 1844, declaring the copy false. The second document is a letter written by Andrew Jackson Donelson to Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage dated January 2, 1844. Donelson states that the copy is legitimate and that some of the plaintiffs are willing to settle.\n\nAndrew Jackson Broadside, circa 1845-1850 (MS.3325)\n\nThis broadside was issued as a public tribute to General Andrew Jackson after his death in 1845. It is entitled \"General Andrew Jackson\" and features a woodcut showing Jackson in his later years as well as a \"Biographical Sketch.\""
