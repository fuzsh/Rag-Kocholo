The first wife of Moses Thurston (1721-1800) of Andover, Mass. and Hollis N.H., is said to have been Hannah Sewall (Brown Thurston, Thurston Genealogies, 44). This attribution inspired fruitless searches for Hannah Sewall's family. It is clear that she is not descended from Henry Sewall of Newbury and Rowley, Mass., nor is it likely that she is from Edward Sewall of Salem, Mass., and Exeter, N.H.. If she were related to Timothy Sewall of Mendon, Mass., or Thomas Sewall of Gilmanton (later Gilford), N.H., it would have to be as a sister, but the parents and siblings of neither Timothy nor Thomas are known.\n\nNo one has been able to explain why Brown Thurston said that Hannah was a Sewall. The birth records of their first three children at Andover from 1744 to 1748, the birth records of five children at Hollis from 1744 to 1756, including a duplicate for the eldest, and the baptism records of five children at Pepperrell, Mass., from 1756 to 1765 do not give Hannah's maiden name (Andover VRs and extracted Hollis VRs and Pepperrell ChRs on the IGI). The ten children of Moses and Hannah Thurston listed by Brown Thurston (45-6) can be assembled from these three lists. Nevertheless, the surname of Moses Thurston's wife Hannah is given as Sewall on may online family trees and other resources.\n\nIt seems much more likely that Moses and Hannah were the Moses Thurston and Hannah Johnson who were married at Andover on May 29, 1744 (VRs, 2:199). Hannah would appear to the the eldest daughter, born on March 31, 1724, of Zebediah and Hannah Johnson, who had eight children at Andover from 1724 to 1747 (VRs, 1:226-232).\n\nThe names of the three children of Moses and Hannah Thurston recorded at Andover, Hannah, Moses, and Shuah, and their birth dates, are an exact match for the eldest three children in Brown Thurston, 45. Moreover, the name and birthdate of the eldest is repeated in the birth records of Hollis. It would seem that Moses moved to Andover sometime before his marriage and lived there until about 1749, when he moved to Hollis.\n\nThere are only three and one-half months from the Thurston-Sewall marriage at Andover on May 29, 1744 until the birth of Moses's and Hannah's eldest child Hannah on Sept. 10, 1744. But marriage of necessity would not be a unique situation. Additional posts to the board by Eben Graves site Church Records that appear to be conclusive proof that Hannah was Hannah Johnson.\n\n229 Worcester, Samuel T, \"History of the Town of Hollis, NH\" (1879), Online at Ancestry.com.\n\n230 (http://www.findagrave.com/index.html).\n\n231 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, \"FamilySearch,\" database, FamilySearch (http://familysearch.org : accessed 2 Mar 2021), entry for Abner Thurston, person ID LCML-5K7.\n\n232 Thurston, Brown, comp, \"The Thurston Genealogies\" (Portland, ME, Hoyt, Fogg & Dunham, 1880), p. 40.\n\n233 Charles Henry Bell, History of the Town of Exeter, New Hampshire (Boston, Mass.: Farwell & Co., 1888), page 229.\n\n234 Charles Henry Bell, History of the Town of Exeter, New Hampshire (Boston, Mass.: Farwell & Co., 1888), page 144.\n\n235 , New Hampshire Probate Records, 1635-1753.\n\n236 Savage, James, A Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England (Originally published in Boston, 1860-62.
