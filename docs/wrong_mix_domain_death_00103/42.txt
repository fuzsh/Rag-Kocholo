Andrew Jackson has become the second person to die following a crash on the A16 between Peterborough and Crowland last month.

Mr Jackson, 33, was driving a silver Ford Fiesta when it was involved in a collision with a silver Kia Sorento at about 6.10pm on Friday, 24 November.

Mr Jackson, of Manwick Road, Felixstowe, Suffolk, was taken to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, in Cambridge, for treatment, but died on Saturday (9 December).

The passenger in the Sorento, 79-year-old Eleanor Joy Williamson of Silkstone Common, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 79-year-old woman from the Spalding area of Lincolnshire, who was driving the Sorento, suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Queen’s Medical Centre, in Nottingham, where she remains in a critical condition.
