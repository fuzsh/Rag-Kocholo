        "text": "Fanney Khan (Template:IPA-hi) is a 2018 Indian Hindi language musical comedy film written and directed by debutant Atul Manjrekar. It was jointly produced by the banners T-Series Films, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Pictures and Anil Kapoor Films & Communication Network. A remake of the 2000 Belgian film Everybody's Famous!, it stars Anil Kapoor, Aishwariya Rai and Rajkumar Rao in lead roles. The film follows Kapoor as the titular character, the middle-aged father of a young, aspiring, and overweight teenage girl whom he pushes to be a singer. He kidnaps a famous soloist to make way for his daughter to become a star.\n\nThe film was announced in June 2016 with Kapoor playing the lead role; after considering Priyanka Chopra and R. Madhavan among others for the other two starring roles, Rai and Rao was chosen. It was mostly filmed in Mumbai in September 2017. Rai's costumes were redesigned by Manish Malhotra after she expressed dissatisfaction over the previous clothes. After the shooting was disrupted in April 2018 over producer KriArj Entertainment's non-payment of dues, Bhushan Kumar of T-Series took over the entire production. Filming was completed in Mehboob Studios, Mumbai in June 2018.\n\nFanney Khan was initially scheduled for a worldwide release on 15 June 2018, coinciding with Eid. It was postponed, and had its initial release in the United Arab Emirates on 2 August 2018, and was released worldwide on 3 August 2018.\n\nPlot[]\n\nPrashant Kumar Sharma (Anil Kapoor), a part-time vocalist in an orchestra, who is popularly known as Fanney Khan, dreams of becoming a singer but circumstances prevent him from being one. He rushes to the hospital and holds his newborn daughter, whom he names Lata, which is the name of the famous singer, Lata Mangeshkar.\n\nA grownup Lata (Pihu Sand) has an excellent voice but is ridiculed because she is overweight. She is a fan of Baby Singh (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), a famous singer, who is tired of her life and wants a break. Prashant's factory is closed and he starts working as a taxi driver.\n\nOne day, coincidentally, Baby Singh travels in Prashant's taxi. When she asks for water, Prashant mixes sleeping pills in the water bottle. He calls his best friend Adhir (Rajkummar Rao) and tells him that he is kidnapping Baby Singh to release an album of his daughter. After much pleading, Adhir agrees to help him.\n\nDuring this incident, Adhir and Baby Singh become friends. Adhir finally takes her out and she starts enjoying herself. She also thanks to him for bringing her dog, Ustaad, who she considers to be her true friend but problems arise when Prashant sees on TV that the police are aware of Baby Singh's kidnapping as the watchman of Baby Singh's house reveals that he saw a man (Adhir) kidnap her dog.\n\nWhile wearing a mask of Rajnikant, Prashant asks Baby's director Karan Kukkad (Girish Kulkarni) to release an album of his daughter. Lata is excited about her own album, and after recording, she talks about her experience, leading the director to realize that her father is the kidnapper and is the famous Fanney Khan. He recognizes him in their next meeting. Prashant finally removes his mask and reveals that he can trust him and his friend Adhir.\n\nLata replaces Baby Singh as the performer on the reality show India ki Awaaz. Meanwhile, Adhir and Baby are nowhere to be found. Police and TV arrive outside Prashant's factory and surround the premise. Prashant calls Kakkad and asks him what is happening and Kakkad tells him to walk outside and tell the Police and TV that if Lata does not perform, he will shoot the real Baby Singh. The TV reporters patch Prashant through with the TV placed inside India ki Awaaz and Prashant and Lata have an emotional talk. She performs well and stuns the audience. Later, Prashant walks out of the factory with his hands up but to his surprise, the Police and TV men clap for Prashant.\n\nLater, a video is released depicting Baby and Adhir in a live-in relationship and on vacation. They both state that they are fans of Lata Sharma. The film ends with the society praising Lata and the hard work done by Prashant to make his daughter a singer.\n\nCast[]\n\nAnil Kapoor as Prashant Kumar Sharma a.k.a. \"Fanney Khan\"\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan as Sumitra \"Baby\" Singh\n\nRajkummar Rao as Adhir\n\nDivya Dutta as Kavita Sharma\n\nPihu Sand as Lata Sharma\n\nSatish Kaushik as Kader Bhai\n\nBarbie Rajput as Rhea\n\nGirish Kulkarni as Karan Kakkad\n\nSwati Semwal as Jinal\n\nSuddu Ali as Zina\n\nKaran Singh Chhabra as rapper Guddu\n\nProduction[]\n\nTBA\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nTemplate:External media\n\nThe music of the film was composed by Amit Trivedi and Tanishk Bagchi while the lyrics were written by Irshad Kamil.[5][6]\n\nAmit Trivedi recreated Mohammad Rafi's hit song Badan Pe Sitare and Ustad Nushrat Fateh Ali Khan's song Halka Halka. Tanishk Bagchi recreated Noor Jehan's 1946 song Mohabbat.\n\nTemplate:Tracklist\n\nRelease[]\n\nFanney Khan was initially scheduled for an Eid release[7][8] on 15 June 2018, but it was postponed until 3 August 2018.[9]\n\nAfter the release of Fanney Khan's trailer and poster in June 2018, Vashu Bhagnani sent a legal notice to its producers for not crediting him as the distributor and co-producer of the film. As per Bhagnani's claim, he had entered into an agreement with Prernaa Arora of KriArj Entertainment to acquire the all India distribution rights of the film, which also entitled him to be credited as co-producer of the film.[10] Replying to this, Ankit Relan from the legal team of T-Series said that T-Series was never consulted or informed about this arrangement and since the movie is being jointly produced by multiple producers, KriArj Entertainment does not have the right to grant distribution rights to anyone without taking consent from them.[11] In a hearing that took place in July 2018, the Delhi High Court restrained Vashu Bhagnani from interfering in the distribution and release of Fanney Khan.[12]\n\nHome video[]\n\nThe film was made available as VOD on Prime Video on October 12, 2019. Its satellite rights were sold to Sony Max for an undisclosed sum.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nTBA\n\nTemplate:Anil Kapoor Template:Bhushan Kumar Template:Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra"
