        "text": "Hello everyone...\n\nFrom Belgium here but Italian born.\n\nMy first introduction to Buk sas through the movie « Tales of ordinary madness » featuring Ben Gazzara and Ornella Muti. At First I rejected it. I was too young, still full of hope and illusions. A few years later I was ready, I tried to read the book and that was it, I became through experience much more aware of realit, raw reality.\n\nI read and read. Everything I could, both in American and french.\n\nHe became a second father, quite the opposite of the real one.\n\nBoth had their issues with life, suffering, misery and both reacted in opposite way.\n\nI very much missed my father from being sixteen through thirty four.\n\nHe died. Later I learned to respect him.\n\nYet he was so different from Buk and here I’m, right in between, lost.\n\nA little of both.\n\n61 now. Still lost, a misfit. With a Phd but still lost.\n\nBuk brought so much for me.\n\nEmotions, laugh, his bitterness yet his resilience.\n\nRecently I met by chance the wife of Dominique Deruddere, film director, autor of Crazy Love based on Love is a dog from hell.\n\nHe lives in LA and it would be a good idea to talk to him if not yet done. Buk loved the movie she said."
