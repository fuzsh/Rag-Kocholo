        "text": "Matthias Schoenaerts was born on December 8, 1977 in Antwerp, Belgium. His mother, Dominique Wiche, was a costume designer, translator, and French teacher, and his father was actor Julien Schoenaerts. He made his film debut at the age of 13 alongside his father in the Belgian film Priester der Entrechteten (1992), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Schoenaerts enrolled in film school but was expelled for poor attendance in his second year. By age 21, he was enrolled at the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Antwerp and was acting professionally in small roles on Belgian television and in Belgian film. By the time he graduated in 2003, Schoenaerts was already named one of \"Europe's Shooting Stars\" by the influential marketing organization, European Film Promotion.\n\nIn 2002, he starred in Dorothée Van Den Berghe's directorial debut Meisje (2002), which was also his first feature film since Daens. With his role in Tom Barman's Any Way the Wind Blows (2003), he proved he was Flanders' young actor to watch.\n\nIn 2004, Schoenaerts produced and starred in the short film A Message from Outer Space (2004). He also appeared in Ellen Calling - Nachricht vom Schicksal (2004) alongside his father.\n\nIn 2006, he had a small role as a member of the Dutch Resistance in Paul Verhoeven's Black Book (2006), and landed his first starring role in the Belgian film Dennis van Rita (2006), playing Dennis, a mentally-challenged man learning to adjust to life after a prison sentence for a rape he may not have committed.\n\nThough Schoenaerts garnered critical praise for his role in \"Love Belongs to Everyone\", the film that would make him a star in his homeland came in 2008, in Erik Van Looy's Loft - Tödliche Affären (2008), Schoenaerts played Filip, one of a group of married friends who share the rent on a downtown loft as a place to meet their respective mistresses. The dramatic thriller was a smash hit, becoming the top-grossing Flemish film of all time. In the same year, he also starred in the horror film Linkeroever (2008).\n\nIn 2009, he worked once again with director Dorothée Van Den Berghe, playing the hippie Raven in My Queen Karo (2009). In 2010, he played the lead role in Alex Stockman's techno-thriller Pulsar (2010).\n\nIn 2011, Schoenaerts starred in Michaël R. Roskam's Bullhead (2011), playing Jacky Vanmarsenille, a cattle farmer who becomes entangled with the underworld of bovine hormones and steroids. Impressed by the script, Schoenaerts committed to star in the film in 2005, and over the five years that it took first-time director Roskam to secure financing, the actor transformed his naturally thin body into that of a steroid-abusing brute. His powerful performance in the tragic role won awards at numerous film festivals and propelled \"Bullhead\" to an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, Schoenaerts got the lead role opposite Marion Cotillard in Jacques Audiard's Der Geschmack von Rost und Knochen (2012); in the film he played Ali, an ex-boxer who falls in love with Cotillard's character. Like Audiard's previous films, \"Rust and Bone\" received a breathless reception at the Cannes Film Festival with a 10-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening and was a critical and box office hit in France. Schoenaerts' performance in the film earned him a César Award for Most Promising Actor in 2013.\n\nSchoenaerts also starred in the Belgian short film Dood van een Schaduw (2012), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 2013 and won the European Film Award for Best European Short.\n\nIn 2013, he starred in Blood Ties (2013) after being recommended for the film by his co-star in \"Rust and Bone\", Marion Cotillard. Following his breakthrough in \"Rust and Bone\", Matthias started a career in Hollywood and landed roles in American and British productions like Saul Dibb's Suite Française - Melodie der Liebe (2014), Alan Rickman's Die Gärtnerin von Versailles (2014), Michaël R. Roskam's The Drop - Bargeld (2014), and Thomas Vinterberg's Am grünen Rand der Welt (2015).\n\nIn 2015, Schoenaerts returned to French cinema in Alice Winocour's Der Bodyguard - Sein Letzter Auftrag (2015), in which he plays an ex-soldier with PTSD. He also played one of the leads of Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash (2015), opposite Tilda Swinton and Ralph Fiennes, and played the art-dealer Hans Axgil in Tom Hooper's The Danish Girl (2015).\n\nHe will reteam with Michaël R. Roskam in Racer and the Jailbird (2017) and also with Thomas Vinterberg in Kursk (2018), in which Schoenaerts will play the captain of a Russian submarine.\n\nGaston Berghmans, quite possibly Belgium's greatest comedian of all time, was born in 1926 in Merksem, a community which is part of the city of Antwerp. He had a very normal and healthy childhood and attended middle school to become a craftsman, just like his father before him.\n\nRight before the Second World War, Gaston had been starring in some local plays in his off-time, and decided to become a professional comedian during the War, quitting his job as a handyman on ships in the port of Antwerp. In this period in his life, he met up with some guardian angels that would procure his future in the entertainment industry.\n\nLater, he met up with Leo Martin, also born in Antwerp, but raised in Brussels. Together they formed the legendary comedy duo 'Gaston & Leo', that toured around theaters all over the country and made TV appearances with hilarious sketches. They also made some features movies including _\"Zware jongens\" (1984)_, _\"De Paniekzaaiers\" (1986)_ and _\"Gaston en Leo in Hong Kong\" (1988)_. Their last big thing together was a Sunday evening sketch show called _\"Gaston & Leo Show\" (1989)_, which aired from 1989 until 1993, when Leo died of cancer. When asked about this period later in his life, Gaston said that he felt like he had died along with his friend.\n\nAfter losing Leo, Gaston starred in his own television show (_\"Gaston Berghmans Show\" (1994)_) for a few years, but he realized that things would never be the same again. After retiring from sketch comedy television in 2000, he only made a limited number of on-screen appearances, mostly in shows that tributed him. In 2008, he ended his acting career in the way he wanted to, with a large dramatic movie part in _\"Christmas in Paris\" (2008)_. That picture however flopped, making people demand him to get into another final project. Gaston kept refusing this, saying his health did not longer allow him to do so. After years of physical ups and downs, he eventually passed away on May 21, 2016 in a rest-home in Schoten, surrounded by his family."
