        "text": "'Bonfire' and De Palma\n\n''It's a great book,'' said Brian De Palma, ''and it's very difficult to make a great movie out of a great book.''\n\nMr. De Palma was talking, of course, about ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel about high and low life in contemporary New York. The novel is very much on his mind because sometime this summer, Mr. De Palma, the director of such films as ''The Untouchables,' ''Body Double'' and ''Carrie,'' expects to be turning ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' into film.\n\nMr. De Palma recently finished mixing the sound on his latest film, ''Casualties of War,'' starring Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn in a David Rabe script based on a true story. It is about a group of American soldiers on a surveillance mission in Vietnam that was tainted by the rape and murder of a Vietnamese girl who accompanied them. He expects that movie to be released by Columbia Pictures in August.\n\nAs for ''Bonfire,'' a Peter Guber-Jon Peters production for Warner Brothers release, ''It cuts across all the stratas of society, and it deals with many issues - a huge, sprawling novel that has characters moving on all stratas and all converging in the very dramatic conclusion of great novels,'' he said. '' 'Gone With the Wind' and 'The Red and the Black' pop into mind.''"
