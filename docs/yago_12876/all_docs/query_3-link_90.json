        "text": "Jean is in a spot of bother. He has just been retrenched from his crap factory job, he has just drugged and kidnapped a prominent pop star, and he has appaling taste in clothes. He has pinned his hopes on his 17 year old daughter. Marva. She is completely without talent and grossly overweight, but Jean and his wife Chantel are convinced that she is chart-topping material. When Debbie, a local hit machine, stops to help Jean with his broken down car. a plan to propel Marva to stardom is hatched.\n\nBelgian director Dominique Deruddere shocked and stunned the world with his debut feature, the Charles Bukowski inspired Crazy Love (1987) Deruddere takes swipes at the lure of fame and the banality of pop entertainment with this black satire. Jean's scheme to ransom his hostage in exchange for a spot on TV for Marva is ill-conceived and comically executed. This enormously entertaining comedy is a shoo-in for a Hollywood re-make, so get in early and see the real deal. Wonderfully funny."
