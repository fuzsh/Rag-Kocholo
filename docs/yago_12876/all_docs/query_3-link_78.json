        "text": "For a movie that starts with voyeurism, advances to acute acne and concludes with a bout of necrophilia, ''Love Is a Dog From Hell'' is a remarkably innocent romance. Dominique Deruddere, a 31-year-old Belgian director, found the idea for his first full-length feature in the stories of Charles Bukowski, an American writer with an underground reputation who did the screenplay for ''Barfly.'' The funny, tender, surprising result can be seen at the New Directors/New Films festival tonight at 8:30 and Sunday at 6 P.M. at the Museum of Modern Art. (The program opens with ''A Warm Reception in L.A.,'' by Vincent Cafarelli and Candy Kugel, a zippy five-minute singing cartoon about a writer whom nobody calls back.) Mr. Deruddere, who collaborated with Marc Didden on the screenplay, first did a short movie based on Mr. Bukowski's account of a man making love to a dead woman, then worked his way back to the youth of the necrophiliac, here called Harry Voss. The interpretation of how Harry got that way is a bit pat, but the three matched sections of the final work are filled with such sympathy for his longings that they compel understanding.\n\nWe meet Harry in the 1950's, his handsome 12-year-old head bubbling with movie-screen romances, gorgeous princesses kidnapped and rescued by dashing knights for the slow fadeout. Under the guidance of a slightly older friend, Harry makes contact with flesh-and-blood women but is defeated first by his shyness, then by his audacity. He learns only how to find solitary and unsatisfying relief for his so-far natural desires.\n\nWe meet him next as he is about to be graduated from high school. Still a romantic, he is now afflicted with as rotten a complexion as the movie screen has ever offered. He solaces himself by listening to love songs and writing love poems, especially to a coed named Liza. ''I love her,'' he confesses to a pal. ''I love them all!'' The pal tries to fix him up, but even the most accommodating coed finds those pustules offputting.\n\nAnd, finally, it is 1976, and Harry, ''30 and broke,'' is something of a bum but no less the romantic. Again he has a pal to assist him in at last finding the woman of his dreams, beautiful, available, entirely and forever his. This one can't say no. ''The best woman I've ever had,'' sighs Harry. ''The kind you meet once in a lifetime.'' It's a comedy of desperation, with overtones of tragedy."
