        "text": "Everybody talks about the weather, Mark Twain once said, but nobody does anything about it. These days, everybody talks about the stupidities of our celebrity culture, but nobody does anything to wake us up from it.\n\nA case in point is the Belgian film that is today's offering in the World Film Series at Wofford College. \"Everybody's Famous\" -- an Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Film in 2000 -- is a story of people dreaming about a life of fame while sleepwalking through the life they have. But in the end, the movie seems to conclude that becoming famous really is the key to transforming drab and pointless lives into something meaningful.\n\nJean is a middle-aged factory worker and would-be songwriter who spends all his energy pushing his daughter Marva to pursue a singing career. Some of the most bizarre moments of the film are the singing contests -- apparently quite popular in Belgium -- where people dress up and sing in the style of American pop stars, and are rated by a panel of judges. Marva is sad, sullen, overweight and a terrible performer. These scenes are painful to watch.\n\nThe movie really goes into action when Jean has a chance encounter with a major pop star and impulsively kidnaps her. His first motive is money, since he's just been laid off from his factory job. But when the time comes for a ransom demand, fame is more tempting than money. Jean demands that the star's manager produce one of Jean's songs, and use Marva to record it.\n\nFrom that point, things become increasingly improbable. It's clear that writer-director Dominique Deruddere sympathizes with the misguided dreams of his characters, even though he despises the culture that created those dreams. The closest thing to a villain in the film is the manager, who ends up manipulating the kidnapping into a made-for-TV event. But it's the manager who makes the dream of fame come true, and there isn't a trace of irony in the movie's happy ending. Fame really does bring happiness. This kindness to its characters makes the movie unexpectedly gentle, but also dulls the edge of its satire.\n\nWant to go?\n\n\"Everybody Famous\" is showing today at 3:30 and 7:30 at Wofford's Olin Theater. The film is in Flemish, with English subtitles. Admission is free."
