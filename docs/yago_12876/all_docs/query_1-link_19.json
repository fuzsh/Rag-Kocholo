I doubt if any musician has played on so many top hits. Turn on any oldies station and you’ll hear him but you’ll never hear his name. Much of his work was a well kept secret - until now. He played with Frank (and Nancy) Sinatra and Elvis - and was on “Tequila!” He was part of the sound of the Phil Spector girl groups, Rick Nelson, The Beach Boys, Paul Revere And The Raiders, The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers and Merle Haggard. Besides the many classic hits and LPs, he recorded dozens of surf, drag and instrumental LPs and led the band on SHINDIG! The training ground for this friendly hard working Italian American gui- tarist was in burlesque houses backing strippers! Fred Hopkins has interviewed David Marks, Larry Tamblyn and Sam The Sham for recent issues of PV, as well as some cool actors. MICHAEL BRUCE, DENNIS DUNAWAY, and NEAL SMITH (along with the late Glen Buxton and Vince “Alice” Furnier) were ALICE COOP- ER. Like many of the best late 60s/early 70s hitmaking groups, they had been school kids influenced by the British Invasion who formed a garage band. The ALICE COOPER band was a major influence on heavy metal, glam and punk rock. These days Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie owe a huge debt to them. I was lucky enough to see them play live twice before they became the subversive crossdressing international top 40 superstars that parents warned their children about and am proud to present this revealing interview. Ed Grant has hosted Manhattan’s best public access TV show (MEDIA FUNHOUSE) for many years now. GARY KENT is a stuntman, actor (he often played bikers) and director who has worked on famous low budget features by Monte Heilman, Richard Rush, Ted Mikels, A1 Adamson, and Ray Dennis Steckler. A few credits are THE THRILL KILLERS, BORN LOSERS, THE SAVAGE SEVEN, SATAN’S SADISTS, and RETURN OF COUNT YORGA. Obviously we had to have an interview with him. Robert Plante, based in Schenectady, NY also interviewed John “Bud” Cardos for PV. DON PEDRO COLLEY is known to sci fi fans for his roles in George Lucas’ THX-1138 and BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES. The seri- ous 6’4” bald actor was also a zombie maker in SUGAR HILL, was Crawdaddy in BLACK CAESAR and was a sheriff on THE DUKES OF HAZZARD. Justin Humphreys interviewed directors Edward Bernds and Nathan Juran for our last issue and more fine character actors than we have room to list here! VLADEK SHEYBAL died years ago, but we have an unpublished inter- view with the Polish born (gay) actor. He usually played East Block bad guys, in two James Bond movies (FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and CASINO ROYALE), several Ken Russell movies, and on the British UF(D TV series. He was even the devil himself in Cannon’s THE APPLE! David Del Valle, who recently was happy to escape from L.A, also provided us 2 TODAY'S MOST ASTOUNDING ADVENTURE ...that started a million years ago! with interviews with the late Cameron Mitchell and the late Cornel Wilde. He interviewed many actors who are still alive and well too. Our address is changing. We didn’t move, and we didn’t want it to change - we were simply assigned a new number. Before long we’ll be assigned a new area code too. PSYCHOTRONIC hasn’t been represented at any conventions for a few years now, but we will have a table at the next WFMU Record Fair in Manhattan. It’s Nov. 5, 6, 7 at The Metropolitan Pavilion, 123-125 W. 18th St. (between 6th and 7th Aves.) Besides all the interesting dealers selling records, CDs, videos and what- ever, there will be live bands. Call (201) 521-1416 (ext. 230) for more info. I will continue to watch any R or PG-13 (and some X) rated tape for review, but we have received way too many new G and PG review tapes aimed at kids recently. Most are from APix, Fox and Full Moon. I might review selected ones because of the director, stars, or themes, but most are going to our nephew Max and niece Sydney in Ohio. Recently the top three movies in the country were good, serious hor- ror movies. None were remakes, sequels or parodies, or starred teenagers! All are set in large old American cities (not New York) and start with the letter S. Mia and I both liked STIR OF ECHOES (from Artisan) the best. It’s based on a 50s Richard Matheson novel which had to have been the inspiration for THE SHINING. THE SIXTH SENSE (from Buena Vista) is also very creepy and also has a kid communicating with the dead. I just got tired of being forced to look at nonstop closeups of the cowering, terri- fied kid’s face. STIGMATA (from MGM), with its Vatican conspiracies and EXORCIST scenes, comes in a distant third, but was also worth going to a theater for. I can’t say the same for the record breaking BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (also from Artisan). I suffer through no budget home made direct to video drek that looks better than this all the time. The brilliant phoney grass roots publicity blitz was worthy of P. T. Barnum (and William Castle) and was largely made possible by the Internet and the PHANTOM MENACE overkill backlash. Countless American teens bought their tickets thinking they were paying to see a terrifying actual documentary. Many of them still think that they saw one, which is a seri- ous reason to worry about the future. Then there’s the new Viacom Corporation which (so far) includes (among other companies) CBS, Blockbuster Video, Paramount, Simon And Schuster, Showtime, MTV, and VHl! Despite prophecies, predictions and paranoia, nothing major will change in the year 2000 (the new Millennium doesn’t really start until 2001 anyway, and even then only for people who use the Christian calen- dar) - there will just be more people deeper in debt and with less impor- tant real choices than ever, being convinced that they’re lucky to be living in the 21st Century in what they think is still a Democracy. Happy anniversaries to Goldmine and High Times (25 years each), Interview (30), and my parents (50 years together)!

I’ve been waiting for a Rivington’s article for years now. Never knew he was in the Lamplighters. I’ve got some of their 45s on Federal. I also just picked up a promo copy (from the guitar player in my new band) of the Rivington’s 45 “Cherry”/”Litde Sally Walker.” It’s cool! Stay Sick. - Bill Rosenthal (Estero, FL) The Rivingtons interview was fascinating. Now that you mention it, I feel I’ve often sensed subliminally something mystical about ‘‘Papa Oom Mow Mow”/”Surfin’ Bird.” The repeating, seemingly meaningless lyrics are are like a hyper mantra, like monks chanting on speed. Plus, the term ‘‘the word” has that suggestion of religiousness to it. - Rob Gififen (NYC) On pg 81 (The Rivingtons) it says ‘‘lead singer Carl White died from pri- apism (choking) in 1980.” Priapism is defined as a constant and painful erection... not the same as chocking to death of course, depending on where it was I suppose. It did give me a quick chuckle, however. - Jefif McIntosh (Watertown, NY) And Frazier had a stroke (not a heart attack). Although I haven’t heard Papa, I think, for more than 25 years, and never really got the craze, reading the article, 1 thought: it may be a great idea to do a sampler with as much versions of the song on it as possible. I would buy it right away. Anyway, you did a good job on researching all the details of the Rivingtons band and their members; must have been a lot of work. The articles on Bemds and Juran were also very informative and a nice read. - Andreas Pieper (Munster, Germany) During a MTV summer segment, there was some giggly, bikini-clad girl Vj cavorting on a CA beach, announcing what videos were coming up. She called to off-camera, ‘Hey Papa! Say Hello to the viewers!, Papa! Look at the camera!’ The camera panned over a bit to where a little old man was walk- ing on the beach. He turned to the camera and did a ‘‘giming” face that looked just like the original! I couldn’t believe my eyes! And the Vj even called him Papa. Also, the mask company Illusive Concepts offers a great rubber mask of Papa. - David Lady (Chatfield, Ohio) This guy 1 work with lived in Cleveland and he told me Ghoulardi blew up a real rat with a firecracker and got kicked off the air. On a totally unre- lated thing - 1 bought this Alice Cooper CD called Freakout and it’s a fake! - Eric Messina (Coral Springs, FL) Arid Alice Cooper tore up live chickens afid Marilyn Manson sacrifices live childreti . . . . 1 grew up in Akron, so was warped by Ghoulardi and the same influences that wai^ Mr. Weldon. When Ernie Anderson passed on, I showed the family X- THE MAN WITH THE X-RAV EYES and blared ‘‘Papa Oom Mow works. - Clifford Weimer (Staten Island) The Trashmen’s ‘‘Surfin’ Bird” figures into WONDERLAND (‘97), a great doc. about Levittown. - Michael Will (Monteal) In a recent Goldmine issue (dated 7/16), Ronny (of ‘‘...and the Daytonas” fame) is quoted in an interview saying, ‘‘...as a songwriter, I figured out that you don’t really have to say anything. You know, if ‘papa oom mow mow’ is good, then, well, you know what I’m saying!” Take that. Bob Dylan. - Patrick Lozito The recent tuH) hour A-^E BIOGRAPHY of Brian Wilson pretty^ much ignored David Marks, but one of the longest music clips was of The Beach Boys doing \"Papa Oom Mow Moiv\" (!?). The Big Chuck and Hi John Comedy And Sci Fi Fest (formally Ghoulardifest) was Oct. 9/10 in Akron, Ohio. The FrightiHsion fest will be in Berea, Ohio, March 21 to April 2 in 2000. Info on both of these NE Ohio Ghoulardi/TV horror host derived shotis can be found at umv.frightinsion.com or call (330) 297-5441. BERNDS The ‘57 TV version of BLONDIE starred Pamela Britton in the title role, not Penny Singleton. Britton later played landlady Mrs. Brown on MY FAVORITE MARTIAN. - Gary Rafferty (Albuquerque, NM) 1 enjoyed the interview with Stooge director Ed Bemds. He seems to have fantastic recall for a man his age, and the interview left me thirsty for more (a full-blown autobiography would be most welcomed!). 1 was disap- pointed that he did not mention Christine MacIntyre (who was pictured in one of the stills). I have read that she was Mr. Bemds’ ‘‘protege’” who he put in many Stooge comedies (not that she needed the help). I would like to learn more about this very beautiful and multi-talented lady who bright- ened every Stooge episode she was in. - Jim McCoy (Texas). Scarecrow Press has just published Mr. Bemds Goes Tb Hollyuood The 332 pg- book (mostly on his early days at Columbia) is $45- Call (800) 462- 6420. SAM THE SHAM The Sam The Sham interview was astounding. He was so cool. More inter- views with music giants - suggestions - any of The Sonics, Jeff Conolly, Sean Bonniwell, etc. - Eric Messina (Coral Springs, FL) Really enjoyed issue #30. 1 especially enjoyed the great interview with Sam Zamudio. Bands like Sam The Sham are to me what Psychotronic is all about. In the early eighties there was a Sydney Ska band who used to encore with Woolly Bully, they’d start up a Congo line during it and often the entire audience would join in for one big conga! Anyone visiting Memphis should drop in on the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, downtown near Beale St. In addition to fantastic exhibits on Stax, Alex Chilton, and plenty on the great Riinngtons Blues musicians from the area, there is a wonderful tribute to Sam the Sham! - David Tamsitt (Sydney Australia) I was stunned to leam that Sam The Sham won a Grammy for best liner notes in 1971. 1 had the belief that Grammys always went to serious jazz annotators, who could tell you about a 32nd note’s minor-key incantation - Steve “Pudgy” DeRose (Chicago) Splendid issue. Not one but two interviews with great directors, both in their 90s for god sakes, who did some of my 50s favorites. That Justin Humphreys sure knows where to find ’em. IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT (67) features a wild juke box song called “Fowl Owl On The Prowl” that’s remarkably similar to Sam ’The Sham’s “Lil Red Riding Hood.” It’s not listed in the credits and I’ve always suspected it was a direct send-up by Quincy Jones, who composed the film’s score. - Michael Will (Quebec) JURAN The Hertz/juran interview was quite informative, but 1 wanted to hit myself over the head with a steel pipe when 1 read that copies of the ATTACK OF THE 50’ WOMAN poster have sold for over $1000. in recent times. 1 could have purchased that poster as well as others 30 years ago for a few dollars apiece. - Lou Henken (Flushing, NY) Hertz was also art director for (among others): / WME UP SCREAMING (41), THE LOVES OF EDGAR ALLAN POE (42), DR. RENAULTS SECRET (42), THE RAZOR'S EDGE (46), - his 2'nd Oscarnomination, BODY AND SOUL (47), KISS THE BLOOD OFF MY HANDS (48), and HARVEY (50). OBITS I’m sure someone has pointed out that the picture of David Manners in PV#30 (p.95) is in fact Manners’ MUMMY costar Bramwell (’’He took a little walk.”) Fletcher. They just showed THE MUMMY at the Cleveland Cinematheque a couple of weeks ago as a part of a Universal Horrors tour (others included DRAC- ULA, THE BLACK CAT, OLD DARK HOUSE...) Thanks. . , — You do Cleveland Proud. - Bill Chase The British David Manners Bramwell Fletcher who died in 1988 was in THE MUMMY with the late David Manners. Yes, the picture last issue was Fletcher. even more bonus tracks (and some longer versions of other ones) aitd there's an Oar tribute LP! Shel Silverstein wrote Marianne Faithful s “Ballad Of Lucy Jordon,” theme song of MONTENEGRO (’81). It’s worth noting that back in 1965, long before it was politically fashionable. Dusty Springfield was the first major perfomier to take on Apartheid. On a South African tour, she refused to play segregated concerts and was chased out of the country. Whenever asked about it in later years, she just shrugged it off like it was no big deal. Class or what? - Michael Will (Monteal) As all readers of Joan Collin’s Past Imperfect know, “la belle Alexis\" was not the first of Anthony Newley’s three wives. His first wife was (British ’IV) actress Ann Lynn. - Tony Williams (Carbondale, ILL) ANTHONY NEmy was also in BLADE IN HONG KONG (85), ALICE IN WONDER- LAND (85), and BORIS AND NATASHA (92). A few corrections and additions about your obits: It’s Jorge Russek, not Russer. Albert Popwell can also be spotted in CHARLEY VARRICK. A source close to the set of ’THE ENFORCER told me that Popwell used to- justly- call himself the “DIR’TY HARRY movies’ good luck charm” because ever time he was in one, it did well at the boxoffice. - Justin Humphreys Popwdl, according to Tbm Rainone, was the brother of actor Brock Peters (TO KILL A MOCKINBIRD...). Pt^nvdl, known as the killer who Dirty Harry said “Make my day\" to, was in movies since the 50's, including (besides those listed last issue) THE HARDER THEY FALL (56), THE PEACE KILLERS (71), BLOODY FRI- DAY (73), THE SINGLE GIRLS (74), WHOSE THAT GIRL? (87), and eim Lynch’s WILD AT HEART (90). Besides the titles listed last issue, the late HOWARD S. COHEN also wrote UNHOD? ROLLERS (72), COVER GIRL MODELS (75), DEATH FORCE (78), VAMPIRE HOOKERS (79), BARBARIAN QUEEN (85), EMMANUELLE 5 (87), AUEN INVASION (90), and BARBARIAN QUEEN 2 (92). Jaki Byard was from Halifax, Nova Scotia REVIEWS I love the photo of Senor Wences on the back cover. Cracks me up, that damn hand puppet! - Uigh Buck (Bethlehem, PA) Wences was in the Betty Grable musical MOTHER WORE JIGHTS (47). I read reports (okay, internet posts... admittedly not the most reliable of sources) that Hypatia Lee had faked her own death in order to \"go under- ground,” while selling the test of her (fan club) merchandise. It should be mentioned that she was also in HELLROLLER (92) and Paul Leder’s KILLING OBSESSION (94). - Erich Mees (Dunwoody, GA) Just finished issue #30. Think it’s the best ya’II have ever done, Michael! Congratulations! Loved the stories on Sam the Sham, Bemds, and Juran. Really fascinating stuff. Always love the obits, too. I invariably leam of some death I didn’t know about. Was listening to Skippy’s Oar album on the headphones this am. Good stuff, son! - Kent Benjamin (Austin, ’DC) Bettjamin, an expert on 60's rock video and Texas music, writes for Goldmine and other publications. I found Skip Spense’s Oar album on cassette (Sony) for 99< in a close out rack at a SL Louis Big Lots store. It has five bonus tracks. Does anybody remember the (late 80’s?) Parkay Margarine TV advert which Senor Wences did. I believe there as a Spanish language version as well. - Steve “Pudgy” DeRose (Chicago) That version urn from Sony/Epic in '91 (7 have a CD of it thanks to Andy Schwartz at Epic). There is also a new version of Oar (from Sundaze, thanks to Bill Bently of Reprise) with I always enjoy Art Black’s The Damned And The Demented column. I’ve read about actor/filmmaker/miscreant Emmy Collins in recent columns and have gotten a hoot out of the reviews of his short films. I’ve been fol- lowing Collin’s career (?) since ’92 and I wanted to let you know that he had small roles in PECKER (credited as “hippie”) and FEAR AND LOATHING. . . (cameo as Jefferson Airplane’s guitarist in acid flashback) - both were in PV #30. Colins is also credited as associate producer/assistant director (and has a cameo as a shouting hippie) in THE SORE LOSERS (PV #25). - Neill Calabro (Duluth, GA) According to Larry, ’The Stooge In ’The Middle by Morris Feinberg (Larry’s brother), KOOK’S TOUR was not a pilot but a lark done by old hams with some money and a lot of time. It was adlibbed from an outline. Larry did have a stroke but it was six months after filming and he died five years later to the day. Feinberg’s book doesn’t mention JERK OF ALL TRADES at all. - Hugh Shelton (Warren, Ml) Re: KOOK’S TOUR - Larry Fine died in Jan., 75, not ’71. Moe Howard followed in May of the same year. - Gary Rafiferty (Albuquerque, NM) Interesting to see the review of RAMRODDER (PV #29). Catherine “Gypsy” Share was also in it. It was made before she and Bobby Beausoleil met Charlie Manson, so it is historically interesting for that alone. I recently found out that the elusive 1976 MANSON MASSACRE was re-released in 1980 as HOUSE OF BONDAGE. - Robert Lawson (Toronto) SAVAGE WEEKEND was released over here on video as DER KILLER HINTER DER MASKE, a literal translation of one of the alternative titles. It was set on the “index” over here, so it was prohibited for the video company to do any advertising for it. Only people about the age of 18 are allowed to see it. I think it is a somewhat nastv' movie, but also more or less boring. And by the way, for my money this movie holds the record for shots showing boom mics. The director must have gone craz\\' after seeing the wiiole movie. I own a British tape (Video Unlimited) of UNKNOWN WORLD and this tape runs 71 minutes. The movie is nice but far to cheap for such a theme. You alway's wait for something really exciting to happen, but... - Andreas Piepcr (Munster, Germany) WONDER WOMEN (PV #30) was shown a couple of years ago on TNT as THE DEADiy AND THE BEAUTTIFUL During the finale, in which Dr. Su’s mutants escape to create havoc, I was fascinated by a featured mutant - a large, athletic black male with a rotating orb atop his head. This sequence alone assures tlie film cult status in my book. A must see! - Steve Bragg (Huntsville, AL) RE: THE PHANTOM OF CHINATOWN (PV #29): Lotus Long was also in THINK FAST MR. MOTO and Keye Luke was in MR. MOTO’S GAMBLE. Mabel Ijee from REET PETITE AND GONE (PV #29) was later in GANjA AND HESS (aka DOUBLE POSSESSION), as Mabel King. She recorded “Dearest Dream” (Hull, ’56) backed by The Heartbeats! In ’63 she did “Love” backed by The Harptones! Oh, and Louis Jordan’s drummer in those movies, Chris Columbus, is playing Atlantic City (I saw him there about three years ago), sounding great! - H. Pfeflfer (The Bronx) Mabel Kin^ was also a guest star in GETTING OVER (76), starring John Daniels from BIACKSHAMPOO. Re: AROUND THE WORLD WITH FANNY HILL. This film also played on late night cable as THE BAWDY ADVENTURES OF FANNY HILL some years ago. I think it was the first “adult” film I ever saw. I saw it again last year under the AROUND THE WORLD... title, and I still think its pretty good of its kind. -JAMES MOHR I was a regular viewer of MUSIC SCENE. Most of the music holds up well, but all of the comedy didn’t age well. I bravely watched the other 45 minute show, THE NEW PEOPLE, featuring Tiffany Bolling (I have her album) and Zoey (I DISMEMBER MAMA) Hall. - Conrad Widener (S. Connellsville, PA) In your review of MUSIC SCENE you call “In The Year 2525” irritating. 1 agree completely. Zagar And Evans were the only act from from here (Lincoln) to score a number one song - and it had to be that piece of crap. Omaha’s fared better with their native musicians including my favorite blues shouter, Wynonie Harris. - John Oldfield (Lincoln, Nebraska) RE: MUSIC SCENE - “Down By The River” was on Neil Young’s second album. Also, Mary McCaslin had a pretty well known run as a West Coast folkie. Her excellent best of album is still in print. - Greg Wall (L.A.) Congratulations on your 30th indispensable issue. You may also be inter- ested to know that Ulli Lommel (you reviewed a couple of his films in the 30th) acted in the version of FANNY HILL that Russ Meyer turned out for Albert Zugsmith in 1964. - Hal Kelly (trashcompactor) Thank you for giving me two more credits for Dorothy Short (DAUGHTER OF THE TONG and SPOOKS RUN WILD). The Reese Witherspoon of the 30s is known as the girl who gets a bullet hole in REEFER MADNESS. She was also featured in DATING DO’S AND DONT’S, clips from which were used for many laughs on Letterman and SCTV’ in the 80s. In Neon Angel - The Cherrie Currie Story, The Runaways vocalist mentions her “older sister Sammi,” stating that \"she was in a couple of movies - good roles too!” I can’t be certain if this is the ClASS OF 74 star. Watch closely in EYES WIDE SHUT while Nicole is in the kitchen gabbing with Tom on the blower. A dink\\' T\\' is playing THE lAST MARRIED COUPLE IN AMERICA - the last movie I know of featuring Sondra. - Hugh Shelton (Warren, Ml) My favorite slx}t in Kubrick's last feature was a look at the Gem Sfm store on St. Mark's Place in t/)e Fjist Village. Look for another Sondra Currie moiie in this issue. Your review of the soft core version of joe Samo’s BUTTERFLIES (PV #30) was fascinating, as was the movie itself. I suspect that it was originally intended to be a soft core feature, but for years Caballero released it as a hard core feature containing insert shots. BUTTERFLIES probably would have worked better as a XXX feature had someone like Jamie Gillis or John Holmes played Harr>^ Reems’ role. Reems generally did a fine job of play- ing nice guy roles while Gillis and Holmes often excelled at playing male chauvinists as well as more sympathetic roles. - Lou Henken (Flushing, NY) CLASS REUNION and THE DICKTATOR (both PV §30) are both officially available from Something Weird Video. The Anthofiy C. Ferrante, w^ worked on WISH MASTER 2, is not the Anthony Ferrante I met many years ago, but tl)ey both have written for Fangoria (!?). Seiwal people called about how to find copies of MAD MON- STER PARTY - the number we have is Deluxo (781) 639-4 15 T And for DEBBIE DOES DAMNATION - director Eric Brummer is at Sub-Vision Films, (323) 659-0568. MONDO PSYCHOTRONIC TAPE Got your MONDO PSYCHOTRONIC tape in yes- terday’s mail and watched it from start to finish. It’s GREAT! Both as a Psychotronic comp, and as a scrapbook of Cleveland’s finest moments in TV, film, etc. We must be close in age because I grew up on a lot of those shows you featured (CAPT. KANGAROO was so bizarre!) I like how you kept your composure when interviewers were laughing at Psychotronic film clips and how you would say - “but it’s actually a really good movie.” It’s obvious you really care about these films and aren’t just name-checking them for a rise. I appreciated that. Also liked seeing you at Chiller (^n. I haven’t been in 2 or three years. Somewhere 1 have video of my friend David arm-wrestling T\\ira Satana to a standstill that let both of them walk away with their dig- nity. She’s so nice for someone who used to grind cigarettes into people’s faces in ASTRO ZOMBIES! Interesting that you mentioned (in the accom- panying notes) about THE LOVE COMMUNE being renamed GHETTO FREAKS. Is this the same as the blaxploitalion flick GHETTO FREAKS? I ask because we just aired a local filmmaker’s episode in which the director Alvin Ecamia did a line-by-line recitation of the trailer to GHETTO FREAKS while it played in the background. The short film is about 5 minutes long and is called ME! I will send you the episode. It’s not very representative of our show, but sometimes we air special episodes like this highlighting peo- ple vse like. - Tom Warner (Atomic TV) See ad on pg. 18. Finally got to sit through your entire Mondo Psychotronic video that I bought from you. It was fantastic!!! When is your next video coming out? I especially lov^ the footage of your old store, since I unfortunately never got to visit it. Keep ’em coming and I’ll keep buyin’ ’em. - Michael Sciddurlo (Hoboken) I really love the MONDO PSYCHOTRONIC video tape and hope you do oth- ! ♦ PSYCHOTRONIC ♦ ers in the future. Thank you for the 8 pages of notes detailing the contents. They were extremely helpful. That clip of The Nairobi Trio from The ERNIE KOVACS show is one of the most astounding TV moments I have ever seen. When the clip of Ghoulardi came up, I just sat there entranced. I had just read about his show and seen photos in PV and in the recent Ghoulardi book. It was so great to finally see a clip of him. All the stuff with you, toward the end of the tape was great. It was nice to see the PSYCHOTRON- IC shop again. I started at NYU in the fall of ’91 and spent a good amount of time at the shop. Whenever I was in a bad mood or stressed out, I would stroll over and hang there for a bit. Doing that always made me feel better. It was sad to see it go. The PSYCHOTRONIC shop was the best store in the Village during the early 90s. - Leigh Buck (Bethlehem, PA) ETC. I first became aware of you back in the early 80s after picking up an issue of The Gore Gazette, in which you and Gary Hertz (a classmate of mine at NYU) were pictured touring the tri-state area promoting DR BUTCHER M. D. on a flatbed truck, otherwise known as “The Butchermobile.” But it wasn’t till I received The PSYCHOTRONIC Encyclopedia for Christmas (!) in 1983 that I became a huge fan of yours. - Bob Young (Bronxville, NY) Young was the origvial co-host (along mth Andy Kaufman's brother Michael) of the public access show BEYOND VAUDEVILLE, (later aka ODDVILLE MTV). As always, the best magazine on the planet...period!! Still trying to find the ever elusive no.l. Small beef re: one of your reader’s letters. 1 loved the Standells as much as anyone, (would sit in my dad’s car parked in the drive way and flip the stations looking for “Dirty Water’’). But to knock the Beatles. Remember those crazys put Huntz Hall and asked Leo Gorcey to be on the cover of Pepper and I doubt strongly there would have been a Standells if not that little combo. Keep up the great work. - Tom Neal I love the magazine, the guides are fantastic and you’ve warped my life and many and won- drous ways. One quibble though, in the Norton Records (plug), the Sonics and Wallers are ref- ered to as “Northeast bands.’’ There may not be that much rock out of the Pacific NorthWEST these days (Seattle doesn’t count Dammit!) but we are still justifiably proud of our 60s heritage. I have a crappy radio show out here in Eugene (hippy capitol of the West) on 88.1 FM called Route 666, so I can’t help but notice tiny stuff like this. Thanks and stay Sick - Josh Mcardie (Eugene. OR) Paul Revere And The Raiders, The Ventures, and many other classic acts were also from the Padfic NW. As Kenny Miller’s collaborator, 1 just wanted to say. thanks for the mention of Kenny’s autobi- ography. While the review was generally posi- tive, you made a couple of comments that I feel deserve correction. You state that it’s not true that Kenny had a hit record in England. Perhaps our definitions of “hit” differs, but Kenny’s recording of “Restless” received a huge amount of airplay in England and Europe and was quite successful, to the point where Kenny was able to live of the pro- ceeds of its sale and resulting tour for more than a year. I’d also like to cor- rect the statement that Kenny “seems to have become some kind of gigolo to royalty.” You’re obviously referring to his deep friendship with Muna al Hussein, the second wife of the late King Hussein of Jordan, and Empress Reza Pahlavi, the wife of The Shah Of Iran. Kenny was close to both women, but it’s grossly unfair - and incorrect - to label him a gigolo, a word that implies a sexual relationship that simply didn’t exist. These points aside, Kenny and I both appreciate the mention in PV. Fans who would like more information on Kenny’s long and varied entertainment career, or would like to write him personally, should visit his website at www.kenny- miller.com - Donald Vaugn (Raleigh, NC) When Isay \"hit, I mean a sofig that made the charts. His song did not make the top 100 in England. I should have said Ketiny Miller had high ranking interna- tional friendships similar to some of George Hamilton 's. Do you remember a cartoon show in the middle ‘60s called MILTON THE MONSTER? Milton was a Frankenstein type monster but had a voice like Gomer Pyle. His pals were Hebbie And jeebie and Abercrombie the Zombie. Also, do you remember a band called Bubble Puppy from the late 60’s? They had a hit called “Hot Smoke And Sassafras” b/w “Lonely” - Bob Staebell (Fenton, MO) Yes, and yes. MILTON, produced by Hal Seeger, was on ABC on Saturday mornings (65-7). The Abercrombie name came from a 1940'ssong (and Soundie short) by Bob Crosby. Bubble Puppy, was from Houston, Texas and recorded for the leg- endary International Artists company. The very first time I went to Manhattan, (in a van of people, in '77), the trip was financed by driver John Thompso7i, oumer of Cleteland's Drome record store, by selling boxes of that (even then rare) 45 to NYC record stores. The w^-wah guitar oierkill \"Hot Smoke\" went to iil4 in Feb., '69. Bubble Puppy’ also recorded one LP. My old band Pentagram (from which I’ve been disassociated since ’89) recently had their 4th album come out. Review Your Choices. It’s heavy metal, so it might not be up your alley, but you might be interested to know that one of the songs, “I Am Vengeance,” is appearing on the soundtrack of an independent horror movie of the same title that I believe was made in Florida. They also have recorded two tracks for a Blue Cheer trib- ute album. Pentagram (from D.C.) recorded versions of “Doctor Please” and “Feathers from Your Tree”! My best friend from high school is the vocalist. I’ve heard the recordings, and they sound remarkably like Cheer probably would sound if they recorded those songs in ’99- - Randy Palmer (NYC) Palmer is the author a new H.G. Lewis book from McFarland. “Thank You” from all of us here in the HIGH FIDELITY art department. Your generosity real- ly helped us to fill up the record store set and it looks great! The film will be released this win- ter. - Jon Schleunz (Chicago) At least three recent, about to be released features have used PSYCHOTRONIC covers in scenes. GALAXY QUEST (from Dreamworks), star- ring Sigourney Weaver and Michael Almeryda's HAMLET with BUI Murray are also supposed to have copies of PV in them. We'll see. Also check out the new book 0.

Every black character (even the porters) are white men in blackface (Sapphire and other females are only referred to). The only real blacks are Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club Orchestra (lighter skinned band members even had to be darkened up!) or seen in actual Harlem street background footage. You might be appalled by this hard to believe hit from RKO, but like it or not, Freeman E Gos^n (Amos) and Charles). Correll (Andy) were funny. They start- ed their blackface comedy act in vaudeville in 1919, were very popular on NBC radio from 29 to I960 (!) and also produced the famous black cast AMOS ‘N’ ANDY TV show (51*3). The plot concerns a fellow Georgian (Charles Morton) who wants to marry the rich Jean (Sue Carol - who later married Alan Ladd). His crooked rival (Ralf Harolde) plots with a woman (silent star Irene Rich) to steal the deed to a mansion. Amos and Andy drive the orchestra in their old beat up cab to jean’s Long Island birthday party, and after The Kingfish calls a Mystic Knights Of The Sea lodge meet- ing, have to go to a haunted house. The orchestra does “Ring Dem Bells” and backs three singers with mega- phones singing the #1 hit “Three Little Words.” The (black) singers actually lip synch to the vocals by the (white) Rhythm Boys (featuring Bing Crosby!). Also with the saittering Roscoe Ates (FREAKS). Ellington's next feature appearance was in MURDER AT THE VAN- ITIES (34). By the way, Elvis Presley made his first pub- lic appearance in a school minstrel show and Frank Sinatra’s first filmed appearance was in a minstrel show short - both were in blackface.

MISTRESS OF ATLANTIS (32) D George Wilhelm Pabst, S Ladislaus Vajda, Hermann Oberlaender, P Seymour Nebenzahl (L’ATLANTIDE) At a French Foreign Ijegion post de Saint-Avit (Gibb McLaughlin) tells how he came to kill Capt. Merchange Qohn Stuart) in flash- backs. During a camel caravan a mysterious masked Arab leads the hero to the underground lost caverns and” tunnels of Atlantis, ruled by the “magnificent beautiful goddess” Queen Antinea (Brigitte METROPOLIS Helm). She plays chess, consults a black fortune teller, has a pet leopard and mesmerizes lovesick men who become delirious smoking “keef.” A laughing (gay?) French servant tells a flashback inside the flashback about Antinea’s mother, a blonde can-can dancer. Eventually Saint-Avit escapes with the guidance of a servant woman (the Moroccan Florelle Tela Tkha). MISTRESS is slow moving but features some wonderful close-ups, impressive sweeping camera work, and a giant stone Antinea head. This is the 87 min. English language version (a 39 roadshow release in America without credits). German and French versions also stared Helm but had different support players. All were filmed in Morocco and Berlin. It was remade as SIREN OF ATIANTIS (47) and JOURNEY BENEATH THE DESERT (61). Pabst is known for his classics PANDORA’S BOX (29) and THE THREEPENNY OPERA (31). Stuart was later in BLOOD OF THE VAMPIRE (58) and VIUAGE OF THE DAMNED (6l). ONE FRIGHTENED NIGHT (Sinister, 35) D Christy Cabanne, S Wellyn Totman, P Nat Levine Mascot, known for its serials, made this better than average 66 min. haunted house movie. Cranky but clever old Jasper Whyte (Charles Grapewin, the uncle in THE WIZARD OF OZ) offers a million each to relatives summoned to his Boston mansion, but two women claiming to be his lost granddaughter Doris show up. The real Doris (Mary Carlisle, later in DEAD MEN WALK) arrives with vaudeville magician Luvalle The Great (Wallace Ford), but teams up with Tom (Regis Toomey). A caped figure in a horror mask lurks, char- acters die, and one room is filled with mummies, skulls and heads. The impressive cast also includes Rafaela Ottiano (later in DEVIL DOLL) as Elvira the maid, Lucien Littlefield (THE CAT AND THE CANARY), as the doctor, Clarence H. Wilson (A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT) as the lawyer, Arthur Hohl (ISLAND OF LOST SOULS), Fred Kelsey (in everything from THE LAST WARNING to MF^ OF LOST WOMEN) as the big sheriff. Adrian Morris (MAD LOVE) as his dumb deputy, and future gos- sip columnist Hedda Hopper (DRACULA’S DAUGHTER). The atmospheric opening credits are great and I love the Mascot logo with a tiger sitting on the world. Future director Joseph H. Lewis was the editor. Cabanne also made THE MUMMY’S HAND and SCARED TO DEATH. 60s Sex THE PICK-UP (SW, 68) D/S/cine. R.

Julie's hip talking friend, adviser and spy Joe (Herb Jeffries) sings in clubs, in an airport, and even on the plane sometimes backed by The Calypsomaniacs (and with some wild »xy danais). The best of his many numbers is \"The Devil Is A Woman\" wth bl^k nightclub dancer Lady T in a devil costume, and a pre-credit num- ter with shouts of “Go! Go! Go!.” Other songs are by Lord Flea and His Calyi^ians (ag^n). The Easy Riders (three white folk singers doing calvpso standards), and The Duke Of Iron. Laurie Mitchell (QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE) a the bloiide NYC roommate. Jeffries, a singer with Duke Ellington and a 40s black cowboy movie star, was the son of an Irish mother and a dark skinned LaUn father. He married stripper Tempest Storni! BOP GIRL (GOES CALYPSO) (57) P/D Howard Koch, S Arnold Belgard, P Aubrey Schenck It's rock (pop and even jazz) vs. calypso as Bob (Bobby Troup), a serious pro- te^r, t^es notes and uses an applause meter at nightclubs, proving that \"rock and roll is past its peak.\" He also falls for the sexy Jo Qudy lyier dubbed by Mami Nixon), making his fiancee (Margo Woode) jealous. Tyler sing; several , numbers including “Rovin' Gal\" with Johnny Olen's Bill Haley type rock band and “Calypso Boogie.\" The Goofeis (a comic trio with a band) do one song while swinging upside-down and “Rock And Roll Until I Die\" in coffins (!). The black acts are Lord Flea (the only real calypso singer here) who does several numbers with The Calypsonians, and R + B quartet The Titans who do the very impressive It s So Hard To Laugh\" (on Vita Records, owned by Korla Pandit!). The Mary Kaye Trio does “Fools Rush In” (she also plays guitar) and Judy Harriet sings “Hard Rock Candy Baby.\" During the credits Nino Tempo (from TOE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT) and his band do a hot honkin' sax instrumental. Lucien Littlefield (ONE FRIGHTENED NIGHT) plays the older professor. Les Baxter provided the other music for the UA feature. Tyler (JAIL- HOUSE ROCK) died in a car accident just before the release. Cr^YPSO HEAT WAVE (57) D Fred F. Seam, S David Chandler, r Sam Katzman V^ety headlines scream “Calpyso sweeps nation!” and Calypso Johnny Qohnny Desmond) is a top singing idol. An over bearing cigar chomping juke- box gangster (Michael Granger) says “Rock and roll was last year!\" as he takes over the Disco record company. His sexy untalented girlfriend (SATAN IN HIGH HEELS star Meg Myles) wants to record (an idea from TOE GIRL CAN'T HELP ip and Johnny hides out (and sings to former Little Rascal Darla Hood!) on hishoat^heH^ (a white vocal group with incredible voices). The Tarrieis, a folk group with lead singer Alan Arkin (!), and TTie Treniers (also in TOE GIRL CAN'T...) do two numbers each and R+B singer Maya Angelou does “Run Joe.” Paul Langton owns Disco, Merry Anders is his press agent girl- friend and young Joel Grey is a short employee who dances. Also with Mac Niles And The Calypsonians, George Stone, DJ Dick Whittington (still on in LA.), and Gil Perkins. Desmond (Giovanni Desimons) was a big band singer who had 18 post war solo hits. It's from Columbia KILLER HANDS DEMONOID (MESSENGER OF DEATH) (Video Treasures, 79) P/D/S Alfredo Zacharlas, S David Lee Fein (MACABRA LA MANO DEL DIABLO) In the opening flash- back, KKK look hooded satanists in a cave chop the hand off of a writhing topless chained up woman. The cursed crawling hand goes on to take over the husband (Roy C. Jenson) of Jennifer (Samantha Eggar). then, as in TOE HIDDEN, vanous other people. A boxing hard drinking Irish war vet priest tuait Whitman) helps the detennined Jennifer (who never acts scared or even very worried) battle the hand. A black cop yells “Cut off my hand or I’ll kill yoii!\" The (briefly unattached) hand (FX by Bob Bums) shoots a gun and a body bursts from a grave. With frequent visions of a demon, a flaming man, a mummy, Haji as a kidnapper, and a Wayne Newton marquee. The goofy action shifts from a deep mine in Mexico to Las Vegas, then to LA and the soundtrack features some fuzz guitar. DEMONOID (now available from Luminous) was released here in 81, the year of Oliver Stone's THE HAND. IDLE HANDS (Col., 99) D Rodman Flender, S Terri Hughes, Ron Milbauer, P Andrew Licht, JefiGrey A. Mueller, Suzanne & Jennifer Todd In sort of an update of THE CRAWLING HAND mixed with the comedy of RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, Anton (Devon Sawa from THE BOYS’ CLUB) is a small town teen who has been unknowingly killing people. When he cuts off his possessed hand, it kills on its own. Seth Green and Elden Henson are his stoner friends who return as zombies, one with a bottle jammed in his forehead and the other carrying his own head. Jessica Alba plays the cute motorcycle riding neighbor and Vivica A Fox (INDE- PENDENCE DAY, BOOTY CALL) searches for the killer in her RV. I think many reviewers hated this because the lead kids smoke pot whenever possible (just like real kids have been doing for over 30 years now), it was released after the last major school shootings, and Anton killing two corrupt cops is played as comedy. The Offspring do The Ramones’ “I Wanna Be Sedated\" at a costume party. With clips from GLEN OR GLENDA Rob Zombie and TWo Live Crew videos, and the old NYC Chiller Theatre intro. Fred Willard, Timothy Stack (from NIGHT STAND) and Joey Slotnik have small roles. The various rock artist soundtrack has music by Graeme Revell. It's a step up for the director of THE UNBORN and LEP- RECHAUN 2 and will probably be popular on tape. 70s A PLACE CALLED TODAY (Monterey, 72) D/S Don Schain, P Ralph T. Desiderio (CITY IN FEAR) A black attorney 0- Herbert Kerr Jr.) runs for mayor as the city (LA ?) is hit by a series of radical terrorist bombings. A liberal activist (Lana Wood) helps with his campaign. Her TV news director boyfriend (Richard Smedley) is also the secret lover of a shameless blonde (Cheri Caffaro) who helps her rich father back the do nothing puppet mayor. Media manipulation, politick corruption and the reasons for revolutionaries (a folk song is heard while we see slum scenes) are explored but this very cynical and reac- tionary movie has a multiple twist end. The intelligent understanding compassionate Afroed candidate is the one behind all the bombings and killings! And all the main characters die! Wood has topless scenes and Caffaro (as in her GINGER movies) is naked, bound and gagged and is raped. Despite the exploitive elements, Schain (Caffaro's husband) forgot to make this fun to watch, ftlling it with endless speeches and political discussions and angry debates shot in the one person at a time DRAGNCT TV style. It was rated X when first released by Avco Embassy. Also with Timothy Brown. 5' 2\" Wood (Natalie’s sister) is aka Svetlana Gurdin. BONNIE’S KIDS (Alpha Blue, 73) D/S Arthur Marks, P Charles Stroud In this hate filled drive-in film noir, Elbe (Tiffany Bolling), a waitress, and her younger sister Myra (Robin Mattson) flee after killing their scary, mean drunk- en would be rapist stepfather (Leo Gordon). They move into the ranch of their rich model agency owner uncle (Scott Brady), but he's a gangster out to use them for deliveries. Elbe falls for a private eye (Steve Sander) and Myra helps drive their uncle's lonely wife (Lenore Stevens) to suicide (“I’m going to tell the whole world that you’re a goddamn queer!’’). As Myra becomes more deranged, the sisters take a case of money and end up on the run from hitmen Eddie (Alex Rocco) and Digger (Timothy Brown) . It’s set in El Paso. The dialog is mean and sarcastic, the score is interesting and the theme is by Sam Neely. Also with Casey Adams as a gun dealer, Christine Murray (from THE DEAN'S WIFE) and future TV stare Sharon Gless and Richard Geary. Mattson, later a soap opera regular, has topless scenes. This and Marks’ DETROIT 9000 (PV #29) and CLASS OF 74 (PV #30) were all from the short lived General Films. TRAIN RIDE TO HOLLYWOOD (Anchor Bay, 75) D Charles R. Rondeau, S Dan Gordon, P Gordan A. Webb Bloodstone had 13 London label R+B chart hits (5 pop) during the 70s/80s but had been formed (in Kansas City) back in 62. This, their odd attempt at a musical comedy fantasy, was released by Tom (BIUY JACK) Laughbn. Harry Williams, the fat guy in “The Sinceres’’ is knocked out and dreams that he and his group are porters on a train filled with movie stare in some mixed up past. Gable Qay Lawrence) and Leigh (Phyllis Davis) do GONE WITH THE WIND scenes. Jay Robinson is Dracula, and Guy Marks is Bogart. The Brando GODFATHER becomes the WILD ONE Brando and kills pas- sengers. (!?) Seven numbers are perfonned including lush ballads (featuring lead singer Charles McCormick) and 50s hits (“Yakety Yak\" and “Sh-Boom’’), the group tap dances and are in silent b/w comedy bits. At a train stop, a New Orleans style funeral song is performed, Harry does a James Brown type song and boxes with a gorilla and there's a song by some harem girls. With Michael Payne, Roberta Collins and Tracy Reed. The tape is letterboxed. THE RUNAWAYS (Regal, 75) D/S John Carr (FUGITIVE LOVERS) Blue (Steven Oliver from MOTOR PSYCHO and THE NAKED ZOO) is a kind hearted 70s hair truck driving pool cleaner who sing3 country ballads in a Sacramento bar. Tara (Sondra Currie from CLASS OF 74), a suicidal young red haired rich woman falls for him big time after he saves her life, so they take off on his motorcycle. Her corrupt political lobbyist husband Mr. Alexander (the tall and scary John Russell) sends out his team of goons, wiretappers and P.Ls and has her framed for possession. Blue turns to Tara's reclusive movie star friend (Virginia Mayo) for help. A nerdy fan (Roger Galloway) has romantic old Hollywood fantasy scenes featuring Mayo. This very obscure movie has memo- rable scenes with Juanita Moore confronting Alexander about his racism and former child star Frankie Darrow (in his last role) as a drunk. With Doodles Weaver as a gas station attendant, Vince Baibi as “Grinder,’’ Jeff Morrow, bikers, scenes in the State capitol building and an impossible Elvis style dubbed singing sequence. The soundtrack is song 3 by Marvin Cave and some “weird” experimental sounds. Currie is the older sister of twins Cherie and Marie Currie. CURSE OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN (Alpha Blue, 71) D “John Kirkland’’/Leonard Kirtman, P/S Ken Uche A young doctor (Maryland Proctor) inherits an old west tourist town and brings along a gang of long hair bell bottom friends to help reopen it A horseman car- BONNIE'SKIDS 12 ♦ PSYCHOTRONIC 4 tying a bloody head turns out to be fake but it takes a while to find out who it was. The editing, lighting, sound, fight scenes and makeup are all vety bad in this obscure oddity. During the flashbacks (told by the zombie look caretaker) of a shootout, long cords for the blood squibs are clearly visible (!). A narrator constantly explains things and repeats what we already know- Witli yodeling Jimmy Rogers style singer Lee Bv'ers, pot smoking comedy improv, an LSD trip and OK cover versions of \"You Ain’t Coin’ Nowhere,” Donovan’s \"Colours” and \"La Bamba.” Claudio Dean is tlie girlfriend, Ultra Violet is a French tourist and one guy resembles Victor Buono. Henning Schellemp was cinematographer. Kirtman (CAR- NIVAL OF BLOOD) is aka pom director Ijeon Gucci. Washington Irving’s famous story' was also filmed in 1922 (with Will Rogers). 58 (Mexico) and recentlv bv Tim Burton. HOT ICE (SW, 78) P/D/S Stephen Apostolof Dyed blonde Patti Kelly and Michael Thayer (from the original ILSA) play international thieves who go to a ski lodge to rob the diamonds of \"rock star Diamond Jim” (who kinda resem- bles an early 70s George Harrison). This boring attempt at a comedy is filled with stock snow sports footage (from the director’s SNOW BUN- INS perhaps?), three live musical segments (a three piece soft rock band with no dmms), and silly hiding the lover in a closet style comedy. Besides a brief topless dance scene there is no nudity. Forman Shane is the overacting comic lodge owner and Teresa Parker is his cheating wife. Also with Ric Lutz and Rick Cassidy. Ed Wood Jr. was assistant director. Without Wood’s twisted screenwriting talents and naked women, Apostolof/A. C. Stevens (PV #8) was lost (this was his last feature). Wood was fired from a small acting role and died shortly after pro- duction. The ending promises a sequel. (!) CAN 1 DO nr TIL 1 NEED GLASSES (Media, 76) D I. Robert Levy, S Mike Price, P/S Mike Callie This pathetic \"sequel” to IF YOU DON’T STOP IT YOU’LL GO BLIND (also 76) runs a very long 73 mins, and plays like a series of local TV comedy skits. Gag? deal with hillbillies, Jews, Indians, fake Orientals, gangsters, fairy tales, ugly women and a nudist colony, although there is precious little nudity shown. A running gag is a man jacking off to a Hustler issue on a bus. The human germs bit is copied (very badly) from Woody Allen’s EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANT- ED... Most of the actors play multiple roles. They include Jeff Doucette (later a regular on NEWHART), big Vic Dunlap (in a record number of unfunny comedies), Patrick Wright, and a few seconds of both Uschi (probably from IF YOU DON’T...) and yes, Robin Williams in his film debut. Thank Charles Band for the (80s) video release. I pity the homy fools who paid to see this in theaters. FOREIGN KILLER TONGUE (APix, 95) D/S Alberto Sciainina, P Christopher Figg, Andres Vicente Gomez (LA LENGUA ASESINA) In New Mexico Candy (Melinda Clarke, who narrates) poses as a nun after her thief in gold lame boyfriend Oason Durr) is jailed. A meteor caus- es her tongue to grow, talk and of course, kill. The pathet- ic woman in a tight black mbber body suit tries to cut it off and hang herself with it Her poodles become friendly guys in drag. Clarke, a brave American actress who had another strange extreme role in RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3, is impressive and a few parts are disturbing and surreal as intended, but this Spanish/English production, influenced by better movies KILLER TONGUE (Melimla CiarkeJ Tim Buckley by Peter Jackson and Robert Rodriguez, is to me an irritating mess. With piss- ing, farting, puking, lots of blood and a rape. Robert \"Freddie” Englund plays a sadistic psycho prison guard with a bad wig and Doug \"Pinhead” Bradley is a prisoner. The print has Spanish intertitles. The Spanish director made music videos in England. The music was composed by \"Fangoria.\" THE FABULOUS WORLD OF JULES VERNE (Englewood, 59) D/S Karel Zeman (VYNALEZ ZKAZY) This wonderful looking Czech fantasy is based on several Verne novels (includ- ing Deadly Invention and Face The Flags). It fea- tures Melies style special effects (including sub- marines, airships and a giant squid) mixing actors with 19lh Century engravings and anima- tion. The plot concerns the possibility of science ending the world. The Warner Brothers 6l US intro features Hugh Downs (who recently finally retired from 20/20). They also Anglicized the Czech actor names. Even if you’ve seen the fea- ture check out this tape for THE MAGIC WORLD OF KAREL ZEMAN, an excellent British docu- mentary short showing the kindly seeming Zeman at work and behind the scenes on this and his other features (BARON MUNCHHAUSEN and JOURNEY TO THE BEGINNING OF TIME) plus scenes from his early shorts. The original US trailer is also included. PASSION FEVER (SW, 66) D Nick Economon In this pretty simple b/w Greek movie, young Yarkos (Pano Katteri) drives a convertible, wears black clothes and always scores with the ladies (and an underage school girl). He falls for blonde Mickel (Katarenia Helmy) but insults, humiliates and hits her when he thinks she’s still involved with an older man. Then the rejected school girl kills herself. Doris Wishman (as \"Louis Silverman”) added a few mismatched no-face nudity and sex scenes for the 69 U.S. adults only release. The music is over dramatic organ playing. 60 s THE CHRISTIAN UCORICE STORE (68) D James Frawley, P/S Floyd Mutrux, P Michael S. Laughlin L. A based Tennis star Franklin Cane (Beau Bridges, looking like Carl Wilson) goes on tour in Texas, freaks out during a match, sells out by doing commer- cials and becomes distant and confused. He also meets then loses a beautiful photographer (Maud Adams in her film debut). It’s all pretty slow going and talk filled but has a neat ending. It was worth it for me just to see Tim Buckley singing \"Pleasant Street” (where the title comes from). He even says one line (to Adams). Another under- rated drug casualty singer (Tim Hardin) is heard on the soundtrack. Gilbert Roland plays Cane's former star play- er manager, Alan Arhus is her ex, director Jean Renoir (and his wife) play themselves and Babe Ruth is on TV. If you look you can also spot McLean Stevenson, Greg Mullavy, Gwen Wells, Talia Coppola, Barbara Leigh, and Anne Randall (HELL’S BLOODY DEVILS), and maybe even Monte Heilman, James B. Harris, Theodore J. Flicker, Larry Gelman, and Mike Medavoy at a party. National General released this (it’s been on local TV stations cut) in 71, the year of Mutrux's DUSTY AND SWEETS McGEE. GIRL IN TROUBLE (Sinister, 63) P/D/S “Lee Beale”/Brandon Chase, S Anthony Naylor Blonde Judy Collins (I?) (Tammy Clarke) thinks \"I want a taste of life” so she hitches from her small town down to New Orleans. Nearly every man is a pred- ♦ P S Y C H 0 T R 0 N I C ♦ 13 ator, voyeur or rapist. She gels a room at a cheap old hotel where llie helpful older Mona (Neiomi Salatiech) sa^'s “Real Addams Family ain’t it?’’ and arranges for Judy (now \"jane Smith\") to land jobs as a lingerie shop model (she has a topless changing scene) then a Bourbon St. stripper (with an incredible high hairdo). This interesting b/w shot on location regional drama sometimes has the feel and look of CARNI\\AL OF SOULS. It’s mostly told in voiceover flash- backs from an ambulance after a sleeping pill OD. The music is jazzy; Tempest Storm is seen on signs and the ending is surprisingly upbeat. A marquee for BARABBAS (6l) shows that the screenwriter probably wouldn’t have heard of folk singer Collins (her first LP was in 62). By the director of THREESOME (69). THUNDER ALLEY (Gravedigger, 67) D Richard Rush, S Sy Salkowitz, P Burt Topper In this slight and forgotten AlP release, Daytona 500 driver Tommy (Fabian) is suspended over a deadly acci- dent and becomes an angry' troubled thrill circus stunt driver. In a change of pace role, Annette Funicello plays the tough stunt driving daughter of the track’s owner (jan Murray). She even has a drunk scene. Psychedelic and many scenes of actual races (with crashes and fires) are used. With Warren Berlinger (nice guy driver who drinks loo much), Diane McBain (Tommy's ex), Michael Mikler (bad rival), Stanley Adams (garage owner), Salli Sachse (THE TRIP) and Mary Hughes (a girlfriend of Jeff Beck). The Davie Allan and The Arrows music is excellent and the clean cut Band Without A Name are glimpsed playing at a wild booze dance party. TTieir end theme copies “Heart Full Of Soul.” Rush followed this with the much more interesting PSYCH-OUT. RARE ANIMATION THE STRANGENESS (TWE, 80) P/D/S/edit/ music Michael Hillman, P/S/FX Chris Huntly, Mark Sawicki Seven mostly young characters (two are female) go deep inside a mine, talk, argue, and are killed off. Dan Lunham and blonde Terry Bealand star. An Aussie cowboy says the slimy tentacled animated monster they eventually encounter is “Straight from the pits of ’ell!\" In the best scene, the creature kills (a doll version oO the company man who was greedily after gold. Some mutilated bodies are covered with maggots. The music is from a synlh and everything is way loo dark. Ernest Farino also worked on the FX. Parts were filmed at Newport Beach, CA MYSTERIOUS PLANET Oust For The Hell, 82) P/D/S Brett Piper Many models of space ships are used in this very low budget semi-remake of THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND. A woman (Paula Taupier) who makes her own ray guns, and sometimes uses two voices at once, leads a crew of three men and a monster head alien. They land on a beach, encounter a giant two head- ed snail and other animated creatures and a local mute girl (Marilyn Mullin) in a bikini, and battle attacking ships. Boyd Piper co-stars. Brett Piper also made RAIDERS OF THE LIVING DEAD (86), THET BITE (89) and A NYMPHOID BARBARIAN... (90). See ad. ENGLAND PERVIRELLA (Dionysus, 98) D/S Alex Chandon, P Josh Collins Tills silly, very' overlong tlieatrical slapstick fantasy sex comedy is not funny and is not sexy'. Three witches watch as some characters travel around the world in flying toy cars on strings A kidnapped baby magically becomes a dumb topless blonde (star “Emily Bouffanle ”) with horns. With lesbian and orgy scenes, comic bloody decapitations, an underwater dream, masked ninjas, a dwarf, fake Orientals, Eileen Daly, Bril TV' host Jonathon Ross as a priest, and the late David Warbeck as a mideaslem King. Thee Headcoats do a comic surf song. Box 1975, Burbank, CA 91507. CIRCUS OF FEAR (Alpha, 66) D John Moxey, P/S HaiT> Alan Towers Everybody seems to have dark secrets at the winter quar- ters of llie Barberini Circus in this convoluted mystery. The most suspicious of them all is tall lion tamer Gregor (Christopher Lee), always in a black head mask, suppos- edly due to his horrible scars. A Scotland Yard inspector (Leo Genn) shows up to investigate a London Tower Bridge murder/robbery. The fun English/German cast includes Heinz Drache (ringmaster out for vengeance). Skip Martin (blackmailing dwarf Mr. Big), Suzy Kendall (busy having an affair), Anthony Newlands (circus owner), Klaus Kinski (always lurking around with a dan- gling cigarette), Margaret Lee, Victor Maddem, and Eddi Ament It was filmed partially at an actual circus. The German language version (DER RATSEL DES SILBERNEN DREIECKS) was directed by Werner Jacobs. This print is color (the U.S TV PSYCHO CIRCUS version is b/w) but is worn and flawed. The same year, Lee and Drache were also in Towers’ THE BRIDES OF FU MANCHU with Tsai Chin (who has a bit part in CIRCUS). RAZOR BLADE SMILE (APix, 98) P/D/S/edit Jake West, P Robert Mercer Lilith (Eileen Daly, who narrates) is a vam- pire in black leather who hang? out in a Ijondon goth club and uses a hit list to find and kill her victims. Some of this was shot cheap and flat like a TV soap opera but more imaginative flashbacks, nightmares, and visions use b/w, red tinting, slo motion, extreme closeups and Hong Kong style action. One standout fantasy sequence was obviously inspired by LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM and the excellent title sequence is like a horror version of classic James Bond movie credits. Also with some nudity, some humor and a surprise romantic ending. Christopher Adamson co-stars as a Masonic Illuminati leader, the late David Waiheck has a small role and part of “Bela Lugosi’s Dead’’ by Bauhaus is heard. British readers might recognize (former pom actress) Daly as the model on Redemption Video covers. She’s good for the part and interesting looking but has definitely had some surgery (face and body) to get that way (a scarier phenomenon than eternal blood suckers). RECENT VERY BAD THINGS (98) D/S Peter Berg, P Michael Schififer This extreme black comedy (the first movie directed by CHICAGO HOPE actor Berg) died at the box office, but was one of my favorite theatrical releases of recent years and has some of the most hilarious (anti) wedding scenes ever. We saw it at a Scranton, PA strip mall multiplex just before Christmas. Five subur- ban LA professionals get as high and dmnk as possible for a wild loud music bachelor party in a Vegas hotel. One guy Oeremy Piven) accidentally kills a hooker (Oriental pom star Kobe Tai) during frantic sex in the bathroom. After another cover up murder, the devious real estate agent (Christian Slater) con- vinces the others to cut up and hide the bodies, then return home for the wed- ding as if nothing happened. When secrets leak out and more people die, the bride (Cameron Diaz) turns out to be more determined, devious, and deadly than any of the men. With Daniel Stem (the weak link of the covemp), Jon Favreau from SWINGERS (the groom), Jeanne Tripplehom and Leland Orser. The shock ending has one of the best uses of computer FX I've seen. The score is by Stewart Copeland. STAG (97) was a more serious (but not better) variation of the same idea. ... DISEMBODIED (Dead Alive, 99) D/S/music William Kersten Connie (Anastasia Wollverton), a very pale young inventor in all black clothes moves into a decrepit basement hotel room. She “gives birth” to a lot of bloody pods that become potatoes with eyes. A bearded older scientist (George Randolph) who exclaims “Great Scott! Could I be having flashbacks?” kidnaps a brain she keeps in a jar. This surprising and sometimes surreal and ^nny movie includes outer space night- mares, flashbacks, and even some stop motion ani- mated objects, but not much dialog. The director (who also composed the excellent soundtrack) has to be a fan of David Cronenberg movies, ERASERHEAD, BAS- KET CASE, ASTRO ZOMBIES and THE SMUT PED- DLER! There’s also a friendly cheerful next door hook- er (Hannah Neace) and a perverted wart faced manag- er who carries around a l6mm industrial film. With one exception, none of the small cast members look over maybe 25. It was filmed in Harbor City, CA IN DREAMS (Dreamworks, 99) D/S Neil Jordan, S Bruce Robinson, P Stephen Wooley This and the excellent shocking BUTCHER BOY (98) make two more box office disappointments in a row for the underappreciated Irish director of INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. Grimms Fairy Tales illustrator Claire (Annette Bening) is troubled by disturbing visions of crimes. Her little daughter is kidnapped after appearing in an elaborate Snow White play and Claire ends up suicidal in a padded room. She eventually escapes and confronts the insane killer (Robert Downey Jr.). A very magical and elaborate horror movie (based on a novel by Bari Wool), parts of IN DREAMS made me think of THE TENANT, THE SHINING, several Argento movies, and even ALICE SWEET ALICE! Incredible scenes of a whole town (including a church and a graveyard) flooded for a reservoir were filmed in a Mexican studio (where parts of TITANIC were shot). The rest was filmed in Mass, (where it'sset), North Carolina, and Tennessee. Also with Jordan regular Stephen Rea (psychiatrist), Aidan Quinn (airline pilot husband) and Paul Guilfoyle (cop). Song^ by Roy Oibison, The Righteous Brothers, Bread and The Andrews Sisters are heard. C OP“ at home to watch TV with her. She uses E-mail messages to help cover up her crimes. Flashbacks reveal that her late father (Eric Bogosian) had sexually abused her. Although played seriously this is a black comedy with some ghoul- ish surprises and clever plot twists. Jeanne Tripplehom (who should be a biggpr star) and Molly Ringwid are both good as the main co-workers and Michael Imperioli (THE SOPRANOS) is a computer expert. The director is a famous art photographer. The effective score (mostly strings) is by Evan (brother of John) Lurie. See THE (MAFU) CAGE (PV #21), also directed by a woman, for Kane in a similar role 20 years earlier. This played festivals then had a very brief delayed theatrical release. SPHEERIS OWES OFFICE KILLER (Dimension, 96) D Cindy Sherman, S Elise MacAdam, Tom Kalin, P Christine Vachon, Pamela Koffler Carol Kane (Latka’s wife on TAXI) is usually cast in small comedy roles, but she makes a convincing psycho. Here she’s Dorine, a hard working quiet “freaky lit- tle mouse” of a writer for a consumer magazine who calmly loses it after being demoted to part time freelance work. She kills several obnoxious co-workers (including Barbara Sukowa) and props up their bloody rotting bodies in chairs James Woods DUDES (IVE, 87) D Penelope Spheeris, S J. Randall Jahnson, P Herb J^e, Miquel Tejada-Flores Milo (Michael “Flea” Balzary) invites two other aimless NYC punks to drive to California in a Volkswagen. Grant Qohn Cryer) says “Everything’s fucked” and the car- toonish Mohawk hair Biscuit (Daniel Roebuck - PV #27) says “Maybe we’ll meet the Go-Gos!” In this mis- fire slapstick comedy, the stars are beaten in a diner, meet an Elvis impersonator at a rodeo and a phantom cowboy at a ghost town. When Milo is killed by bikers his character is missed (the young Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist is the only believable punk). Grant falls for a divorced shaip shooter mechanic (Catherine Mary Stewart) in Utah. Biscuit has nightmares of an Indian massacre and they eventually get high with Indians. The Vandals play a cowboy song (the soundtrack was on MCA). Also with Lee Ving, Pamela Gidley, and John Densmore of The Doors. The director’s next was DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION 2 (88). Her biggest hit was WAYNE'S WORLD. BOYS NEXT DOOR (New World, 84) D Penelope Spheeris, S Glen Morgan, James Wong, P Keith Rubenstein, S^dy Howard Roy (Maxwell Caulfield), a pissed off, muscular trailer trash teen and his only friend Bo (Charlie Sheen) graduate from high school, then drink while driving to LA to party before facing a future of factory work or military service. Roy leads the sometimes reluctant Bo on a harrassment and murder spree, target- ing women, gays and minorities. Pretty much ignored when released, this ahead of its time feature was an accurate look at things to come. Characters watch violent Japanese anime and one victim says “In ten years you’ll be illiterate unless you learn to use computers.” BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD had to be influenced by the horrifying but often hilarious things Roy and Bo say. Caulfield and Sheen are both excellent. With Christopher McDonald and Hank Garrett as detectives, Patti D’Arbanville, and Moon Zappa. The soundtrack includes choice tracks by The Cramps (several), Iggy, Tex And The Horseheads and effective electronic music by George S. Clinton. It was made between the director’s SUB- URBIA (84) and HOUYWOOD VICE SQUAD (86). BLOODSUCKERS JOHN CARPENTER’S VAMPIRES (Uni., 98) D John Carpenter, S Don Jakoby, P Sandy King It’s been years since I expected good movies from Carpenter and this vampire western isn’t one of them. The macho, foul mouthed Jack Crow (overacting James Woods), leads his team of mercenary vampire hunters who like to party ♦ PSYCHOTRONIC ♦ IS MUSIC CLASSICS (Vols. 1-10) (MPI, 98) The box covers are generic and boring and llie claim that these (aprox. 75 min.) comps are made up of 40s Soundies is only partial- ly true, but the whole set runs over 12 hours and is a fascinating motherlode of historical b/w big band, swing, boogie, jazz and early R-i-B performances, both live and lip synched. The hundreds of clips (not listed on the boxes) are actually from many features, shorts, TV' specials and Soundies, from the 30s through tlie 50s. Much of it is available elsewhere, but only the most serious completist collector would have it all. Nothing is arranged in any kind of order or by theme - it’s just LOTS of (often rare and amazing) pre-rock music. Each clip has new subtitle intros. They seem to be accurate except for one or two glaring exceptions. The picture quality is very high, but collectors of Soundies (visual juke box shorts filmed from 41-46) will notice that the original credits have been edited out. Collectors will also notice that some musical features and shorts have been cut up and dispersed over several volumes. For instance, clips of Dizzy Gillespie from JIVIN’ IN BE-BOP (PV #29), Slim Gaillard from O’VOUTIE O’ROONEY and Duke Ellington from SYMPHONY IN BLVCK, are spread over several volumes. Big stars with long careers appear on many vols. The great Duke Ellington is on every one but vol. 6, so you can pretty much trace about 30 >'ears of his career. Count Basie, Louie Armstrong and Cab Calloway are also all on many volumes and it’s all prime stuff. Most acts were strickly all black or white, but it’s interest- ing to see that the bands of Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa were integre- grated in the 40s. Allthough most bands were all men (maybe with a female singer), there were all female bands too. Ina Ray Hutton is amaz- ing doing \"The Susie Q” (vol. 2) and \"I’m 100 % For You’’ (vol. 5) with her all female band in the 30s. Members of the Thelma White Orchestra sing (and scream) during \"Hollywood Boogie’’ (vol. I) and Rio Rita and her orchestra do several numbers including “Feed The Kitty (vol. 5). Surprisingly one band that let female players in was Lawrence Welks - “Champagne Polka’’ (vol. 4). I like the big bands and most of them (Harry James, Artie Shaw, The Dorsey's, Glen Miller, even Kay Kyser), along with the best band singers (including Sinatra and the wonderful Peggy' Lee) are here but some of the less famous performers are more exciting. To see just how out there even a white guy could be in the 40s’ you need to experience Harry “The Hipster’’ Gibson’’ doing \"Piano Boogie Jump’’ (vol. 8) and a song named after himself (vol 9). To see where rock and roll came from check out a young Joe TLimer doing “Roll ‘Em’’ (vol. 6) and “Low Down Dog’’ (vol. 8) with Meade Lux Lewis on piano. Billy Eckstein sounds a lot like T\\imer on \"Lonesome Lover Blues’’ (vol. 1) and scat sings of \"Rhythm In A Riff (Vol.3). Freddie Slack plays boogie woogie piano on “Basin St. Blues’’ with The Will Bradley Orchestra (vol. 1). Jimmy Rushing sings the blues in “Take Me Back Baby’’ (vol. 7). The Delta Rhythm Boys mention \"hep cats\" during “Gimme Some Skin” (no, not the Stooges song) on vol. 8 and The Chantecleers do \"Jumpin’ Jack From Hackensack’’ (vol 9). Some Soundies were very sexy (as were some later Scopitones) and look like clips from adults only movies. A good example is Francis Faye doing’ \"Just A Gigolo” while three maids kneel and peep through a keyhole. Some of my other favorite clips are of: Dorothy Dandrige doing \"Cow Cow Boogie\" (vol. 3) in a short cowgirl oufit. Eubie Blake and his band playing “Chinaboy” (vol. 8) in a giant pie and turn- ing into skeletons (!). Billie Holiday singing \"My Man\" (vol. 7). Sam Butera blowing his sax on \"Night Train” with Louis Prima (vol. 4). June Richmond doing “47th St. Jive\" with Roy Milton’s band (vol. 5). She sings \"What’s the plan Charlie Chan?,’ and men- tions a \"Fly chick.\" Nat \"King” Cole watching himself on a Soundie machine as he does \"Frim Fram Sauce\" (vol. 8). Louis Jordan doing \"G.I. Jive\" while in uniform (vol. 5) Benny Goodman and his band (including Lionel Hampton, Gene Krupa and Harry James) doing “I’ve Got A Heartful Of Music\" (vol 5). Maurice Rocco, a black boogie woogie piano player, doing \"Beat Me Daddy Eight To The Bar’’ in a Soundie with optical FX. Carol Stevens, a white jazz singer seating on TV while Coleman Hawkins plays (vol. 7). These tapes made me apreciate Jack Teagarden, a New Orleans trad type jazz singer and even Ozzie Nelson! And there’s The Dinning Sisters, Amos Milboume, Les Paul, even Bob Hope singing in the 30s It’s hard to single out highlights with all these great clips and I’ll probably have new favorites in the future. My fave this week though is Fats Waller doing “The Joint Is Jumpin’ (vol 9) during a wild booze party in an apartment where you have to “check your weapons\" at the door. See this and you’ll never look at modem videos the same. The first two vols. came out in 91 and the rest are brand new. More and different Soundies (there were also country, classical, polka, novelty, even burlesque... ones) have been released by BMG (4 out of print volumes hosted by Leonard Maltin) and Something Weird (3 vols. including one with all sexy ones). Many 30s music shorts are now available from Kino and MCA released a four vol. SWING SET (from 40s/50s shorts). These and other comps will be reviewed in PV soon. The swing revival is pretty much a media scam at this point, but if it results in the release of more material like this I’m all for it.

Master vampire Valek (action movie star Thomas Ian Griffith) is after a magic cross, so he can take over the earth. We learn that the Catholic church is responsible for vampires (see STIGMATA for more interesting and believable Vatican conspiracies). With Daniel Baldwin, Sherri Lee as a pathetic hooker victim, Maximilian Schell as a cardinal, Ciiry-Hiroyiiki Tagawa and Gregory Sierra (from BARNEY MILLER). It takes place in New Mexico where it was filmed. Even the sometimes similar direct to video FROM DUSK TO DAWN 2 (PV #30) was more fun than this. NEW YORK VAMPIRE (E.I., 98) P/D/S/edit Greg Lamberson, P Ed Walloga (UNDOING LO\\T) Angry, depressed, suicidal young Scott (long haired Tommy Sweeny) is bit by a smiling vampire/model (Julie Sweeny). The now white faced, raw^ meat eating Scott has to deal with a long haired rival vampire (Andrew Lee Barrett), the deatli of his girlfriend, and an older police detective who attacks saying “That's right, holy wata!” There’s a subway scene but most of this tape (presented by Carl Morano and Eric Mache) is talk in apartments. With flashbacks and a rap song. The director made SLIME CITY ten years earlier. VAMPIRE TIME TRAVELERS (Cinematrix, 97) D/S/edit/act Les Sekely, P Raymond Storti A sororitv' house is mn by the domineering house moth- er (Lvnne Baker, the best looking of the many young female cast members). Students include Sam 0- J- Rodgers), the “sister of Buffy,” a tall blonde guitar play- er (Kat Facchino, who has a shower scene), and a dorky tennis pla>er (Ali Elk). A white faced valle)' girl vampire (Jillien Weisz) is given advice by (close-ups of the mouth oO her late vampire sister. A video (with nudity) is “Bite Her In The Butt.” The odd comedy has b/w flashbacks and niglitmares inside of flashbacks and nightmares, comic sound FX and some heavy metal music. 22647 Ventura Blvd. #352, Wooodland Hills, CA 91364. MORE RECENT REVENOUS (20th, 99) D Antonia Bird, S Ted Griffin, P Adam Fields, David Heyman In 1847, after barely surviving the Mexican American War, “hero” Capt Boyd (Guy Pearce from LA CONFI- DENTIAL) is assigned to a remote former Spanish California mission, now a military outpost, during the winter. The Scottish Colquhoun (Robert Carlyle) sud- denly arrives and tells a horrifying tale of cannibalism in a cave. The rest of this atmospheric, bloody historical horror movie is a battle for survival (a bit like Carpenter s THE THING) as characters become vampire like Wendigos. The acting (especially by Carlyle, also the latest Bond villain) is excellent and RAVENOUS has flashbacks, nightmares and political overtones. Also with Jeffre>^ Jones as the commander, Neal McDonough (fascist look blonde soldier), Shiela Tousey (Indian woman), David Arquette (her stoned lover), Jeremy Davies (priest), Stephen Spinella (doctor), John Spencer and Joseph Running Fox. It was shot in Mexico, The Czech Republic and Slovakia and is by the female director of PRIEST (94), also with Carlyle, and MAD LOVE (95) starring Drew Barrymore. The excellent unpredictable score is by Michael Nyman and Damon Albam of Blur and KNB provided the FX. LULU ON THE BRIDGE (Trimark, 98) D/S Paul Auster, P Peter Newman, Greg Johnson After Izzy (Harvey Keitel), a New York jazz sax player, is shot during a gig (Izzy Lives! is the Post headline) he finds a magical floating glowing stone with unclear calming powers (on a dead body) then a new waitress/actress love LOVE TO KILL (Elizabeth Barotides) (Mira Sorvino). She lands the lead in a new film version of PANDORA’S BOX being directed in Dublin by a former movie star (Vanessa Redgrave) and he's beaten, kidnapped and mentally broken down by a relentless interrogator (Willem Dafoe). The Dafoe sequence is like an overlong theater improv session stuck in the middle. With Gina Genshon as Izzy’s ex, Mandy Patinkin, Richard Edson, Lou Reed (as an actor who looks like Lou Reed!?) and Kevin Corrigan. Whoever did the casting worked overtime to round up odd faces. I don’t want to give away the surprise ending but it sure is similar to the end of the recent hit SIXTH SENSE. Tlie score is by Graeme Revell and the jazz is by John Lurie and The Lounge Lizards. LULU was shot in Manhattan and Dublin. The video box claims Keitel is a star of EYES WIDE SHUT. APOCALYPSE BOP (E. L, 96) P/D/S Andrew Osborne, P Monique Sorgen Suicidal Harvard dropout Zeke (Scott Von Doviak who looks like actor Steve Zahn) has visions of Felicia (Claire Harding) who plays guitar in the Boston subway. Various characters (football jocks, soldiers, skin- heads, gays, pot smokers...) interact and talk. Some scenes are b/w before the whole movie loses its color. Eventually Zeke is magically transported to a party at a mansion in the woods hosted by a big bearded “Satan like” ex-con who explains that “we’re at the end of real- ity.” A karaoke singer in drag becomes an actual (naked) woman and a crazed Marine starts killing peo- ple. The interesting, very 80s seeming SLACKER inspired (?) comedy was based on a play. The music is punk and new wave. VIRUS (Universal, 99) D John Bruno, S Chuck Pfarrer, Dennis Feldman, P Gale Anne Hurd The crew of a tugboat discover a huge technically advanced Russian ship in the S. Pacific during a typhoon and the hard drinking greedy thick headed cap- tain (Donald Sutherland) claims it. The only survivor Ooanna Pacula) is terrified and an electric alien pres- ence creates little mechanical bug monsters and grisly part human robots (created by Steve Johnson and Eric Allard and inspired by the creations of Mark Pauline per- haps?). Eventually the captain becomes a mutant part- machine killer. Jamie Lee Curtis (back in horror with this and the HALLOWEEN sequel) is a strong willed sur- vivor. The small cast includes William Baldwin, Cliff Curtis (as a long haired tattooed Maori), Marshall Bell and Sherman Augustus. The script of this Germanyjapanese backed ALIEN clone (based on Pfarrer's Dark Horse comic) is confused and much of the action is in near total darkness. The first time direc- tor worked on John Cameron movies. LOVE TO KUX (APix, 97) D James Bruce, S/act Rustam Branaman, S Monica Clemens, P Harel Goldstein, Bill Barnett (THE GIRL GETS MOE) Moe (Tony Danza) and Franco (Branaman, from TERRIFIED) are wealthy from dealing illegal Asian firearms. Moe falls for Monica (Elizabeth Barondes from NOT OF THIS EARTH version 3), but during a night of (offscreen) lovemaking. Franco accidentally kills her sister (Amy Locane from CRY BABY) and hides the body. Louise Fletcher is the mother of the two cute sisters who like to shoot guns. The main characters in this odd black comedy by the director of HEADLESS BODY IN A TOPLESS BAR (96) act cheer- ful despite the shootouts, murders and talk about cancer, suicide, germ warfare, and AIDS insurance scams. With Michael Madsen as another gangster, James Russo as a corrupt cop in a neck brace, Richmond Arquette (who looks just like his brother David), Todd (DIFF'RENT STROKES) Bridges, and R^ Moon Zappa. ■■■ ♦ P S Y C H 0 T R 0 N I C ♦ 17 $20 each plus S3 shipping (cash, check, m.o. or credit card) to PSYCHOTRONIC, 7549 State Rt. 97, Narrowsburg, NY 12764.

Stefano Piselli, Roberto Guidotti, Riccardo Morrocchi “Sadistic and Sadeian” Movies are covered in chronological order from FAN TOMAS (1913) to WAX MASK (97). Many Utles are older horror movies (MASK OF FU MANCHU, ISLAND OF LOST SOULS...), Luis Bunuel is the most mentioned director and appropriate features by Stroheim, Welles, Bava, Franco, Lynch and Cronenberg are here, along with some pom titles.

FORGOTTEN HORRORS THE DEFINITIVE EDITION (Midnight Marquee, $24 ppd) George E. T\\imer, Michael H. Price First published way back in 1979, this influential book is available again in a nice new updated and explained soflbound edition. It features new titles, pictures and rare advertisements, Bela, Dwight Frye and Anna May Wong on the cover and an intro from Mel Brooks. Even after 20 years of home video many of the low budget horror, sci fi, fantasy and adventure features (and some serials) from 1929 to 36 covered here in historical detail remain obscure. I hope to review more of them in the future, but some that have already been in these pages are KING OF THE KONGO, DRUMS OF JEOPARDY, THE THIR- TEENTH GUEST, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT, DELUGE, CHLOE, DRUMS O’VOODOO, ONE FRIGHTENED NIGHT, LOVE WANGA, DEVIL MONSTER and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES.
