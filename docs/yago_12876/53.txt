After impressing everyone with his excellent Charles Bukowski adaptation Crazy Love (1987) and the Oscar nominated Everybody’s Famous (2000), director Dominique Deruddere has made films in many European countries. His latest is this German-Belgian black comedy based on the famous comic-book Lune de guerre by Jean Van Hamme and Hermann Huppen. It’s a deliciously dark social satire about a wedding party that turns into outright warfare. Mark and Sofie are getting married and a beautiful countryside hotel is the setting for the wedding banquet. But what’s supposed to be the couple’s most wonderful day turns into a nightmare when the groom’s father, Hermann, picks a fight with the owner of the restaurant. It turns out that the conceited Hermann is obsessed with buying the establishment and is using the occasion of the wedding to humiliate the owner. Slowly but surely the party runs out of control and the idyllic country hotel turns into a besieged stronghold. The words ’till death do us part’ take on a menacing significance in The Wedding Party.
