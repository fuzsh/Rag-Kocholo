Laurence Leamer is the New York Times bestseller author of nineteen books. As a young man, he worked in a French factory, a West Virginia coal mine and a school in the mountains of Nepal. The subjects Leamer has written about are as varied as his life, from the costs of power in Washington to the travails of celebrity in Hollywood, and from the legal struggles of two Pittsburgh lawyers against a coal mogul to the games played in the elegant salons of Palm Beach. The award-winning author’s books focusing on women have been particularly well regarded starting with The Kennedy Women, a number two New York Times bestseller. His recent book, Capote’s Women, a national bestseller, is being made into an eight-hour series starring Naomi Watts, Diane Lane, Calista Flockhart, Molly Ringwald, and Tom Hollander. Leamer’s newest book, Hitchcock’s Blondes, is the second part of a trilogy about intriguing women involved with creative geniuses. The author has a wife, Vesna Obradovic Leamer, who takes care of everything else in their complicated lives. He is fortunate as well in having a terrific daughter, Daniela Mantilla, a great son in law, Antonio Mantilla, and two dynamite grandkids, Alejandro and Emilia. If one has good health, a close family and loyal friends one has everything. The author lives in Palm Beach, Florida and Washington, D.C.
