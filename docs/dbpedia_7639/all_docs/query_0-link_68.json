        "text": "THE KENNEDY MEN\n\n1901-1963: The Laws of the Father.\n\nBy Laurence Leamer.\n\nIllustrated. 882 pp. New York:\n\nWilliam Morrow. $35.\n\nJACK\n\nA Life Like No Other.\n\nBy Geoffrey Perret.\n\nIllustrated. 459 pp. New York:\n\nRandom House. $35.\n\nNO event since the assassination of John F. Kennedy has scarred the American consciousness the way the events of Sept. 11 have. For the rest of their lives, those old enough to remember will recall where they were when they learned of the attacks. The atmosphere of crisis in the Kennedy years, which peaked during the Cuban missile crisis, finds echoes as well, now that many Americans, in anticipation of further terrorist assaults, are buying gas masks, assembling medical emergency kits and discussing civil defense in a manner unknown in this country since the early 1960's. Once again the United States is fighting a limited land war in Asia. Restrictions placed on executive authority in the 1970's, following public exposure of covert operations by the Kennedy administration against Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba, are suddenly the topic of urgent debate.\n\nIt is curious, and more than a little disturbing, therefore, to be reminded how remote the themes of almost everything written about Kennedy in the past three decades are from the aspects of Kennedy's life and career that seem the most relevant in this transformed environment. In the last generation, writing about Kennedy by biographers and historians has tended to fall into three recognizable genres. The first has been tabloid history, an approach to the lives and loves of Kennedy and the Kennedy dynasty that sacrifices analysis to prurient entertainment. Then there has been the left-liberal myth of Kennedy as a reluctant cold warrior who, if he had lived, not only might have avoided expanding the war in Indochina that began in his administration, but might also have brought the cold war to a peaceful conclusion based on a mutual recognition by the United States and the Soviet Union of the threat of nuclear war to all humanity. Hollywood has disseminated this myth in movies like ''Thirteen Days,'' in which a dovish Kennedy saves humanity during the Cuban missile crisis from American generals and presidential advisers, and Oliver Stone's ''J.F.K.,'' which hinted that Kennedy was murdered by officials in the government who sought to escalate the war in Vietnam.\n\nFinally, recent years have witnessed the fabrication of a third myth -- that of a sinister John F. Kennedy. In a climate of sexual puritanism created both by the religious right and some strains of feminism, Kennedy's philandering came to seem less ribald than deplorable. Critics on the left, like Noam Chomsky and Seymour Hersh, have argued, plausibly, that Kennedy was a sincere cold warrior -- and, unjustly, have condemned him for being one."
