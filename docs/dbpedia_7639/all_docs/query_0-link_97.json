Kennedy, and their struggle to fulfill the family legacy. These lives make for a book of overwhelming drama full of exalted aspirations, notable achievements, and the most spectacular mishaps, excesses, and tragedies. For the most part, these Kennedy men fell far short of the great vision that Joseph P. Kennedy had for his sons and grandsons.\n\nThe Sins of the Father\n\nJoseph P. Kennedy and the Dynasty He Founded\n\nBy: Ronald Kessler\n\nNarrated by: Frank Langella\n\nLength: 3 hrs\n\nAbridged\n\nOverall\n\n4 out of 5 stars 22\n\nPerformance\n\n4 out of 5 stars 19\n\nStory\n\n3.5 out of 5 stars 19\n\nFor all his wealth and power, Joe Kennedy was not a happy man. He also had no shame. What he cared about was having power. Through the political dynasty that he founded, he achieved that for generations to come. If he hurt and corrupted others in the process, no one had the courage to challenge him. The results are the myths that continue to enshrine the Kennedy family and maintain it as a national obsessions.
