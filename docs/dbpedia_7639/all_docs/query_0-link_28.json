        "text": "VERY entertaining non fiction\n\nHighly recommend this if you love non-fiction. About Truman Capote and his \"Swans,\" socialites of the 50s and 60s. Full of glamor and cunning, these women climbed to the top of society--but many were ultimately unhappy once at the top. This parallels Capote's literary career. It was very entertaining--loved listening to it on auditable.\n\nDelicious from start to finish!\n\nThis is a fascinating read that keeps you engaged. It’s dishy, and sometimes catty, yes….but also sad. There’s always more to see behind the image that is portrayed in public.\n\nWomen are used as trophies and discarded like old newspaper while rich men are hunted like sport fish. Wealth doesn’t equate to love, kindness or even security. In listening to this book, a lot of the people are lonely and insecure, looking for love in all the wrong places with the wrong people.\n\nThe narrator was excellent and wonderful to listen to. Definitely worth a second or third listen.\n\nGreat Segues\n\nThis is more a book of each of the swans and their personal stories as much as it is about Trump. It intertwines with how they meet Truman and how they eventually become one of his “swans”.\n\nA Wonderful Exploration of a Rare time in History\n\nA wonderful delivered and Riveting dissection of “The”society of the ‘50s and 60s with a look at the celebrated and sordid life of Truman Capote, a jester for the Swans.\n\nIt’s ok\n\nAuthor went on tangents that had nothing to do with Truman’s swans. Pretty boring overall\n\ngreat/interesting listen\n\nThe book gives a great insight into the very unique, ridiculous, and glamorous lives of the women Capote surrounded himself with as well as his own intimate life (that was quite ridiculous in its own ways). Reading about such overstated wealth is definitely odd but this book brings you into their world of complicated relationships, high society lives, and how no amount of money or fame can truly buy happiness.\n\nLifestyles of the Rich and Famous\n\nI decided to read this book to prepare for the upcoming series...and this book did not disappoint. Glamorous, stylish and wealthy beyond our wildest dreams...these women are fascinating. I loved the division of each chapter and the juxtaposition of Truman Capote's life. This is a great book.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed this book\n\nGreat story. Great pacing. Well told and performed. I can’t believe how quickly I got through it. Although quite in depth, it really whetted my appetite for the topic…so I’m off to find more books!"
