        "text": "Books & Books and the Coral Gables Art Cinema present\n\nAN EVENING WITH LAURENCE LEAMER\n\nIn Conversation with Christina Lane\n\ndiscussing\n\nHitchcock’s Blondes: The Unforgettable Women Behind the Legendary Director’s Dark Obsession\n\n(G.P. Putnam’s Sons, $29.00)\n\nWednesday, October 18, 6PM @ Coral Gables Art Cinema\n\nGET TICKETS HERE\n\nBooks & Books and the Coral Gables Art Cinema are thrilled to present a screening of Hitchcock’s To Catch A Thief followed by a conversation evening with Laurence Leamer and Christina Lane. They will be discussing Leamer’s book: Hitchcock’s Blondes: The Unforgettable Women Behind the Legendary Director’s Dark Obsession (G.P. Putnam’s Sons, $29.00), and Leamer will be signing copies of the book following the conversation.\n\nAbout the Book:\n\nBestselling author of Capote’s Women Laurence Leamer shares an engrossing account of the enigmatic director Alfred Hitchcock that finally puts the dazzling actresses he cast in his legendary movies at the center of the story.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock was fixated—not just on the dark, twisty stories that became his hallmark, but also by the blond actresses who starred in many of his iconic movies. The director of North by Northwest, Rear Window, and other classic films didn’t much care if they wore wigs, got their hair coloring out of a bottle, or were the rarest human specimen—a natural blonde—as long as they shone with a golden veneer on camera. The lengths he went to in order to showcase (and often manipulate) these women would become the stuff of movie legend. But the women themselves have rarely been at the center of the story, until now.\n\nIn Hitchcock’s Blondes, bestselling biographer Laurence Leamer offers an intimate journey into the lives of eight legendary actresses whose stories helped chart the course of the troubled, talented director’s career—from his early days in the British film industry, to his triumphant American debut, to his Hollywood heyday and beyond. Through the stories of June Howard-Tripp, Madeleine Carroll, Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, Janet Leigh, Kim Novak, Eva Marie Saint, and Tippi Hedren—who starred in fourteen of Hitchcock’s most notable films and who bore the brunt of his fondness and sometimes fixation—we can finally start to see the enigmatic man himself. After all, “his” blondes (as he thought of them) knew the truths of his art, his obsessions and desires, as well as anyone.\n\nFrom the acclaimed author of Capote’s Women comes an intimate, revealing, and thoroughly modern look at both the enduring art created by a man obsessed…and the private toll that fixation took on the women in his orbit.\n\nBUY THE BOOK HERE\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nLaurence Leamer is a leading biographer of the rich and powerful, including Capote’s Women, Madness Under the Royal Palms and The Kennedy Women, among many other books. The second season in F/X’s anthology series, Feud, will be an adaptation of Leamer’s 2021 Putnam bestseller, Capote’s Women. The miniseries will star Naomi Watts, Molly Ringwald, Diane Lane, and other notable stars, with Gus Van Sant directing. He lives in Washington, D.C., and Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nAbout the Moderator:"
