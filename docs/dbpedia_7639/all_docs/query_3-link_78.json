        "text": "CAPOTE’S WOMEN\n\nA True Story of Love, Betrayal, and a Swan Song for an Era\n\nBy Laurence Leamer\n\nThere’s a poem by Thomas Hardy, “The Convergence of the Twain,” which chronicles the construction of the Titanic, in all its opulence, and the simultaneous formation of its “sinister mate” — the iceberg that is set to destroy it: “And as the smart ship grew / In stature, grace and hue, / In shadowy silent distance grew the iceberg too.”\n\nThis poem came to mind as I read “Capote’s Women,” the story of the high-society women of the 1950s and ’60s who were befriended, and then betrayed, by Truman Capote, their sinister mate. In frothy prose — meals are “splendid repasts,” apartments “abodes” — Laurence Leamer describes this “coterie of gorgeous, witty and fabulously rich women.” They married well, and often, passing their days buying lunch, clothes and houses.\n\nCapote called them his “swans.” One of them was the “gorgeous and vivacious” Barbara “Babe” Paley, who “never left the Best-Dressed List” and created “stunning” homes, “exquisitely decorated.” “Stunning” is one of Leamer’s preferred adjectives.\n\nAnother swan was Gloria Guinness, another “regular on the Best-Dressed List.” She underwent three starter marriages — to the manager of a sugar factory in Veracruz, to a German count and to the son of an Egyptian ambassador — and enjoyed affairs with, among others, a high-ranking Nazi and the British ambassador to France, before ending up with the banking heir Loel Guinness, who, as luck would have it, had recently been left today’s equivalent of $2.39 billion in his father’s will."
