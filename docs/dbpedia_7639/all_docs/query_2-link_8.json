Contributing editor, Washingtonian, 1975–.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: Author Laurence Allen Leamer has held a number of positions in the field of journalism over the course of his career. He served as an associate editor for Newsweek, and has worked as a freelance writer for numerous periodicals. Leamer is best known as a book author, publishing political nonfiction books and a number of unauthorized biographies of celebrities.\n\nLeamer's Playing for Keeps in Washington contains eight portrait essays about power in Washington and the people who wield it. His method couples \"journalism with the short story,\" observed Eric Redman in the New York Times Book Review, \"and, stylistically at least, the marriage works. Leamer's research is extensive, his characters real (they range from Henry Kissinger and Edward Kennedy to Ralph Nader and Nancy Hanks), but Leamer's literary techniques are lifted directly from the realm of fiction.\"\n\nLeamer's other book on Washington powerbrokers, Make-Believe: The Story of Nancy and Ronald Reagan, which traces the lives of the fortieth president and his wife, begins his venture into the arena of unauthorized biography. With the help of a researcher, Leamer \"has done an admirable job in putting together an easy-to-follow chronology,\" commented Anne Wittels in the Los Angeles Times Book Review. \"In addition, Leamer has done comparative research, pointing out discrepancies between facts in public records and those same 'facts' when told, or ignored, in his subjects' own autobiographies.\" Leamer notes, for instance, that in Ronald Reagan's official biography as governor of California, he failed to mention his marriage to Jane Wyman and the two children he fathered by her. Similarly, Nancy's one-page biography begins \"Nancy Davis Reagan was born in Chicago, the only daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Loyal Davis,\" when actually, asserts Leamer, she was born Anne Francis Robbins in New York City, the only daughter of Edith and Kenneth Robbins.\n\nThe theme of Make-Believe, stated Elisabeth Bumiller in the Washington Post, \"is that the Reagans grew up in hard-knock worlds [Ronald's father was an alcoholic, Nancy's a cad who left her mother virtually at her birth], where they had to make-believe, married in Hollywood where the town made-believe for them, and now continue to create their own 'make-believe' world in Washington.\" In the New York Times Book Review, Nicholas Lehmann-Haupt granted that there \"is something to this notion [of make-believe] … Both the Reagans had rough early childhoods …, and both found safe harbor—he as a genial actor, she as the stepdaughter of a Chicago surgeon,\" yet he ultimately dismissed the concept, describing Leamer as \"too much the prisoner of his odd scraps of information … at other times, he's clearly reaching.\"\n\nBumiller concluded that for critics of the Reagan administration, \"the book will simply confirm all the things they suspect, particularly about Nancy's problems with her children, her love of the sparkly set, and her ambitions for herself and her husband—all here in the most comprehensive catalogue to date. For Reagan fans, it will be another blast of cheap shots by a journalist.\"\n\nIn the Toronto Globe & Mail, Joy Fielding described Leamer's next unauthorized biography, As Time Goes By: The life of Ingrid Bergman, as a \"fascinating story, full of big names and larger-than-life drama, and Laurence Leamer writes literally and well, keeping the reader glued to every page.\" Fielding noted a sexist slant to Leamer's writing, however, and commented that the author's \"judgmental\" writing may offend women readers. The reviewer conceded that Bergman had her faults, but added, \"that she was as bad as Leamer's prose suggests is highly doubtful.\" Fielding concluded that \"in trying to present an impartial and complete picture of the woman who was branded both saint and sinner, Leamer is ultimately tripped up by his own prejudices and the narrow perimeters of his own male perspective.\"\n\nAnn Edwards, in a Washington Post Book World review, also perceived a lack of compassion for the subject by Leamer, claiming, \"What he adds to the Bergman story is not insight or depth or, for that matter, anything of a revisionist nature, but a subtext that insinuates when it should illuminate.\" Edwards stated that \"he presents her as wildly ambitious, egocentric, selfish and without very good motives or intelligence. Too often, her foibles are described in penny-dreadful prose.\" She further observed that \"whenever the opportunity arises, Leamer has a way of placing Bergman in a bad light.\"\n\nAbout Leamer's unauthorized biography King of the Night: The Life of Johnny Carson, Ronald L. Smith noted in the Chicago Tribune that \"the research is so meticulous the book reads like a textbook,\" further commenting that the book \"is an extremely thorough job of fact finding.\" Carson did not cooperate on the book, so Leamer and his research team spent over two years locating two hundred former neighbors, employees, and acquaintances from whom they gleaned information and anecdotes. Among the sources Leamer tapped were Carson's first wife, Jody, and two of his other three wives. Leamer managed to gain entrance to several events that Carson himself attended during the research period and told Ron Grossman in the Chicago Tribune, \"My appearance caused a ripple of uneasiness to go through the crowd … some guests had already talked to me and were scared out of their wits lest I show a sign of recognizing them.\"\n\nThe biography prompted John J. O'Connor to write in the New York Times that \"Laurence Leamer is more interested in enumerating less appealing aspects of Mr. Carson's off-camera life.\" O'Connor commented about Leamer's extensive research that \"the resulting pastiche is often irritatingly speculative and nearly always juicy, already the stuff of tabloid headlines.\" The reviewer concluded, \"For all of its sensational tidbits, this is a quintessentially American story of parlaying a modest talent into a staggering profit.\"\n\nIn 2001, Leamer returned to writing about political figures with the release of The Kennedy Men, 1901–1963: The Laws of the Father. Using a wide range of both established and new sources, the author chronicles the history of the men in the politically powerful Kennedy family, including Joseph Sr., Joseph Jr., Robert, Edward, and John. Leamer gives a full biography of each figure, and also discusses their roles in the family and in American politics as a whole. The author presents the work in a serious but relaxed style, including colorful vignettes and anecdotes from each man's life.\n\nCritics reacted positively overall to The Kennedy Men, 1901–1963. Many found Leamer's account of this famous political family to be eloquent and fair. \"This beautifully written, balanced account shows both the positive and the negative sides of the Kennedy men,\" observed Ralph Nurnberger in a review for Perspectives on Political Science. Other critics praised the author for his diligently researched work. \"Although Leamer aims primarily at a general audience, scholars will take note of his considerable primary research … and dozens of his own interviews,\" wrote Library Journal contributor Robert F. Nardini.\n\nLeamer followed up his book about the Kennedy men with 2004's Sons of Camelot: The Fate of an American Dynasty. With this work he switches focus to twelve sons of the Kennedy patriarchs. Through extensive interviews and other research, Leamer traces each son from adolescence into adulthood and beyond—working as entrepreneurs, publishers, attorneys, congressmen, and more. He also addresses how each son has handled the legacy of political power and fame that accompanies the Kennedy name.\n\nSons of Camelot was also met favorably by critics and readers alike. For many, Leamer's book offers new insight into this famous family. \"Impeccable: Leamer never overreaches, delivering accessible and even insightful portraits of Camelot's sons,\" wrote one Kirkus Reviews contributor. For others, the book's strengths lie in the information provided by Leamer's contacts—professional and personal acquaintances the author has developed from his many years covering the Kennedy family. The research \"gives his work an insider status rarely found in the Kennedy oeuvre,\" noted Ilene Cooper in a review for Booklist.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerican Enterprise, January-February 1995, Florence King, review of The Kennedy Women: The Saga of an American Family, p. 87.\n\nAmerican Libraries, September 1999, review of The Kennedy Women, p. 97.\n\nAntioch Review, spring 2002, review of The Kennedy Men 1901–1963: The Laws of the Father, p. 350.\n\nBaltimore Chronicle, January 2, 2002, Joe Rosenberg, review of The Kennedy Men, 1901–1963.\n\nBarron's, August 29, 1983, Richard Rescigno, review of Make-Believe: The Story of Nancy and Ronald Reagan, p. 41.\n\nBooklist, July 1994, Ilene Cooper, review of The Kennedy Women, p. 1891; May 1, 1997, Mike Tribby, review of Three Chords and the Truth: Hope, Heartbreak, and Changing Fortunes in Nashville, p. 1458; August 2001, Ilene Cooper, review of The Kennedy Men, 1901–1963, p. 2048; March 1, 2002, review of The Kennedy Men 1901–1963, p. 1152; February 15, 2004, Ilene Cooper, review of Sons of Camelot: The Fate of an American Dynasty, p. 1002.\n\nBook World, September 4, 1994, review of The Kennedy Women, p. 2; October 7, 2001, review of The Kennedy Men, 1901–1963, p. 3.\n\nCampaigns & Elections, November 2001, review of The Kennedy Men, 1901–1963, p. 18.\n\nChicago Tribune, July 11, 1989, Ronald L.
