Fully authorised by the estate of Philip K. Dick and written by the author they felt best equipped to take forward the vision of one of the great names in SF, this novel combines the dark imagery, paranoia, tension and pace of Dickâ€™s original novel and the cinematic genius of Ridley Scott in a novel that takes the Blade Runner series into a new millennium.

Blade Runner has become one of the most recognisable and well loved brands in SF and K.W. Jeter has only added to its reputation and impact.
