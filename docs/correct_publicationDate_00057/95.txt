Seller Rating:

Paperback. Condition: Good. The first sequel to the major movie spectacular, "Blade Runner", "The Edge of Human" has been commissioned by Orion and authorised by the Philip K Dick Trust and The Blade Runner Partnership. It is written by a writer who worked alongside Dick in the years prior to his tragically earl death. It answers a lot of the questions left hanging by the movie and yet remains true to the spirit of the original Philip K Dick story "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep". Rick Deckard is living with his replicant lover, Rachael, in the rural backwoods of North America. They eke out their remaining days together with Rachael spending most of the time in cyrogenic suspension. Out of the blue Deckard is snatched away and dumped back in LA with more questions than answers. Why is he on a murder rap? Who is the sixth replicant? And is Sarah Tyrell, Rachael's double, to be trusted? The book has been read but remains in clean condition. All pages are intact and the cover is intact. Some minor wear to the spine.
