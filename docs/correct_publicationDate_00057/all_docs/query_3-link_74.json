        "text": "Fully authorised by the estate of Philip K. Dick and written by the author they felt best equipped to take forward the vision of one of the great names in SF, BLADE RUNNER 4: BEYOND ORION combines the dark imagery, paranoia, tension and pace of Dick?s original novel and the cinematic genius of Ridley Scott in a novel that takes the Blade Runner series into a new millennium.\n\nBlade Runner has become one of the most recognisable and well loved brands in SF and K.W. Jeter has only added to its reputation and impact."
