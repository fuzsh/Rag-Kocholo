        "text": "Like just about everything related to Blade Runner, it’s complicated.\n\nWhen we speak of canon, what are we really referring to? Definitionally we are talking about “a collection or list of sacred books accepted as genuine.” In genre fiction, it’s a way to separate what is “official” from what is unverified, unlicensed, or unsanctioned. As fan fiction and other User Generated Content have proliferated over the recent decades, the question “what is canon?” has become more relevant — and more challenging.\n\nFortunately, when we are speaking about Blade Runner, we don’t have to worry quite yet about it falling into the public domain — another aspect of creative control that can wreak absolute havoc with canon. Take a look at a character such as Sherlock Holmes and unless you are a purist who says, “only the written works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle count as canon” then you’re looking at trying to catalog hundreds (thousands?) of stories from over a century.\n\nSuper fans of genre storytelling, like me, are often obsessed with ‘canon.’ With extended universes, reboots, retcons, and ever-changing franchise ownership, it can be difficult at times to keep track of what the official storyline is within a given franchise. Does the animated series count? What about comics, or that officially licensed board game?\n\nWith Blade Runner, it shouldn’t be too difficult to discern what is, and is not canon. We’re talking about two movies, three film shorts, four books, a limited number of comics, and one video game. It’s a pretty manageable library, especially when compared to something like Star Wars — or even Alien for that matter.\n\nAs you know by now, while my love for Blade Runner is unmatched by any other properties, I do find comparisons with the Alien franchise to be both unavoidable, and also illuminating. So with that in mind, this essay on canon was inspired by a similar piece by Andrew E.C. Gaska on the Alien franchise. Andrew has an impressive resume and has worked with 20th Century Fox and Free League on Alien-related projects so this is something he’s thought about (in fact, has been paid to do so), so I think his piece is a good standard bearer.\n\nThe truth is, it would simply be impossible to incorporate all Blade Runner materials into some sort of “pure canon.” Ridley Scott took care of that with his somewhat loose adaptation of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? into the film Blade Runner. Then, K.W. Jeter wrote three novels in which he cherry-picked, discarded, rewrote, altered, and combined details from DADoES? and Blade Runner.\n\nAfter that things become a little clearer, but debates can still be had. So, again in the spirit of Gaska’s work on Alien, I’m also going to think of canon in the Blade Runner universe as being tiered. A purist may argue that canon is absolute — a work either is or it is not canon. That’s a fair position to take, but then it requires one to simply do away with large chunks of work related to Blade Runner. I’d prefer not to do that. So, here’s a way we can work it into the actual framework of the Blade Runner universe: We’ll simply say that the Blackout of 2022 has made many incidents difficult to verify. Official records have, for the most part, been lost, and so in some cases, we’re left with oral histories.\n\nLevel Four — Bridge Canon\n\nBlade Runner 2: Edge of Human\n\nBlade Runner 3: Replicant Night\n\nBlade Runner 4: Eye and Talon\n\nAh, the books. Let’s not get into the quality here (read my Blade Runner IP essay for that), rather we’ll focus on their place in the canon, which is equal parts perplexing and fascinating. First, let’s look at where they entered from a timing perspective. Edge of Human was published in 1995, well more than a decade after the original film came out. Quite simply, after the re-evaluation of the first film and its subsequent popularity as an art house revival with the Director’s Cut, the books were a relatively cheap way to give an apparently growing audience something new. In that sense, they act as a bridge to the second film. The books also bridge the gap (or at least attempt to) between the original novel and the original film. Again, your mile may vary on the degree to which they were successful in doing that.\n\nLevel Five — Fan Canon\n\nThe Alien Universe\n\nSoldier\n\nThere are two pieces of evidence that fans point to in order to make this connection. First, in Aliens, during a scene in which Weyland Yutani executives are debriefing Ripley, we see a video screen showing Dallas and in his bio it notes he had previously flown a ship while working for the Tyrell Corporation. While a very minor detail, it does appear in what Gaska considers “Definitive and authorized canon” from the Alien universe.\n\nThe second piece is a bit more circumspect. As part of the marketing for the film Prometheus, the character of Peter Weyland (founder of Weyland Corp.) gives a TED Talk in the year 2023. You can watch that short film here. While not in the filmed version of the talk, there is a portion of the script (featured in the Blu-Ray DVD extras) in which Weyland has written the following (hat tip to Neon Dystopia for having this laid out well in this piece):\n\n“A mentor and long-departed competitor once told me that it was time to put away childish things and abandon my “toys.” He encouraged me to come work for him and together we would take over the world and become new Gods. That’s how he ran his corporation, like a God on top of a pyramid overlooking a city of angels. Of course, he chose to replicate the power of creation in an unoriginal way, by simply copying God. And look how that turned out for the poor bastard. Literally blew up in the old man’s face. I always suggested he stick with simple robotics instead of those genetic abominations he enslaved and sold off-world, although his idea to implant them with false memories was, well… “amusing,” is how I would put it politely.”\n\n(Bold added by me.)\n\nOk, so that’s not really subtext, that’s just text. Peter Weyland is clearly referring to Eldon Tyrell. But it’s not in the filmed version, just part of an unused script, so again, tenuous at best.\n\nAs for Soldier, it hangs its argument on two pieces of evidence as well: First, the screenplay is written by David Peoples, who was also brought in to do rewrites on Blade Runner. Peoples has been quoted as referring to Soldier as a ‘sidequel’ to Blade Runner. In Soldier, Kurt Russell’s character, Todd, the titular soldier, is said to have seen action at the “Battle at Tannhauser Gate as well as the Shoulder of Orion conflict.”\n\nYeah, that definitely sounds like a connection to Blade Runner, but it’s alluded to, not something we actually see. I’d label it more of an easter egg or homage as it’s just barely one level above this from The Expanse…"
