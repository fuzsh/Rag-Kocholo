        "text": "We’re less than a week away from the release of Blade Runner 2049, one of the most anticipated movies of the year—and, to Blade Runner fans, one of the most anticipated sequels in Hollywood history. It’s been 35 years since the original Blade Runner hit theaters, and its reputation as a dense, dark sci-fi masterpiece has only grown in the decades since its release.\n\nBut a movie on such a lofty perch can also be a little difficult to penetrate—and it doesn’t help that there are a half-dozen versions of the original Blade Runner available on home video right now. So if you’re a Blade Runner newbie, this is everything you need to get up to speed in time for Blade Runner 2049.\n\nOkay: What’s the deal with the original Blade Runner?\n\nBlade Runner is a sci-fi/neo-noir movie, loosely adapted from Philip K. Dick’s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. Blade Runner is set in the year 2019, in a dark, rainy, neon-soaked, and altogether hellish-looking vision of the future of Los Angeles. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, the titular \"blade runner\"—a kind of detective tasked with finding and eliminating incredibly lifelike robots called \"replicants.\" Replicants are essentially indistinguishable from humans, but created to do jobs humans don’t want to do: hard labor, warfare, and sex work. As a failsafe, replicants were designed with a four-year lifespan. Shortly before the movie begins, a small group of replicants mount a rebellion, murder a bunch of humans, and vanish. Rick Deckard is assigned to track those replicants down.\n\nSo there are like 27 versions of this movie, right? How many of them do I actually need to watch?\n\nJust one! And Ridley Scott made it pretty easy to remember, because it’s the one called Blade Runner: The Final Cut. After years of confusion about the \"real\" version of Blade Runner, The Final Cut was released in 2007 to provide a single, definitive of Blade Runner. Scott personally oversaw a brand-new remaster of the original movie. He also re-added some violence that had originally been removed from the U.S. release, cleaned up a bunch of effects that had aged poorly, and patched up a plot hole that had bedeviled Blade Runner fans for years. (More on that later.)\n\nGreat. Where can I watch The Final Cut?\n\nIt’s not available on any of the major subscription streaming services right now, but you can rent it on any of the major paid streaming services—Amazon, YouTube, Google Play, et al.—for a few bucks. That alone should be enough to get you prepped for Blade Runner 2049—so if you want to stop here, you’re good.\n\nLet’s say I get really, really into Blade Runner. Which other versions should I watch?\n\nThis is where it gets a little complicated. When Blade Runner was originally released, it included an elaborate voiceover narration by Harrison Ford, which was added when test audiences complained that the movie was too confusing. Most Blade Runner diehards loathe this voiceover, though some defenders have argued that it ultimately helps to entrench Blade Runner in the neo-noir genre. (For what it’s worth, neither Ridley Scott nor Harrison Ford are fans of it.) Even more controversially, the original version included a disjointed happy ending that was patched in, bizarrely enough, with unused helicopter footage from Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining. To my mind, the original release (which is now called the \"Theatrical Version\") is definitely inferior—and Blade Runner 2049 has pretty clearly jettisoned that happy ending—but if you’re a completist, it’s interesting to see the somewhat bastardized version that originally arrived in theaters.\n\nAfter watching that, you might want to check out the Director’s Cut, which was released in 1992. It’s much more similar to The Final Cut than the original release—there are no voiceovers and no happy ending—but there are some scene-to-scene differences, and some purists prefer the visual design of the original to the remastered look of The Final Cut.\n\nAfter that, you can check out the International Version, which is just a more violent version of the Theatrical Cut, or the Workprint Version, which is more or less what Blade Runner would have been before all those concessions were made to appease confused test audiences for the original release. I’ve never bothered with any of those, but you can find both versions on the elaborate \"Ultimate Collector’s Edition,\" so go nuts.\n\nOkay. So Blade Runner 2049 picks up 30 years after the original?\n\nYep! But if you’re curious about what else happened in that 30-year gap, there are a few short Blade Runner 2049 tie-in movies you can watch to get up to speed. The first one, set in the year 2033, centers on Niander Wallace, the new villain played by Jared Leto:\n\nThe second one, set in the year 2048, centers on a new replicant played by Dave Bautista:\n\nAnd the third—an anime short directed by Cowboy Bebop’s Shinichiro Watanabe, which you’ll need to watch at Crunchyroll—is set in the year 2022, chronicling a global blackout that helped lead to the events of Blade Runner 2049.\n\nGreat. What else?\n\nIf you’ve read this far, it’s probably time to address the biggest and most heated debate in the Blade Runner universe. There’s no definitive answer, but it’s still kind of a spoiler for the original movie—so if you haven't seen it, and want to go in blind, stop reading now.\n\n…\n\nAll set? Good. An attentive viewer will walk away from Blade Runner with a big burning question: Is Rick Deckard a replicant? You can make a case for either side, but The Final Cut certainly tips the scale toward \"yes.\" In The Final Cut, Deckard is taunted by a fellow blade runner who seems to know about a weird, private dream Deckard had about a unicorn. If he knows what’s going on in Deckard’s brain, one could argue, it’s because he has intimate knowledge about Deckard’s programming.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Ridley Scott has stated that Deckard is a replicant (and his Final Cut certainly bolsters the evidence for it); Harrison Ford has stated that Deckard isn’t a replicant. Either way, it’s a safe bet that Blade Runner 2049 will add new context to the debate—especially since Harrison Ford is returning, which means Rick Deckard has survived for decades longer than the standard replicant lifespan.\n\nGot it. So that’s everything I need to know about Blade Runner? Didn’t you mention something about a plot hole?\n\nAnd now we get into the really deep cuts! Blade Runner 2049 is the first theatrical sequel to Blade Runner, but there are a bunch of other Blade Runner stories and spinoffs in other mediums. Novelist K.W. Jeter wrote a series of sequels that used a weird plot hole in the original Blade Runner as a jumping-off point. In the original movie, Deckard is told that six replicants are on the run—but he only confronts five. In The Final Cut, Ridley Scott changed a line to imply that the missing sixth replicant died in the original escape—but more than a decade before that, Jeter’s novel Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human followed Deckard as he tracked down that mysterious sixth replicant. Jeter wrote two more Blade Runner novels after that. None of them are canonical anymore, and you can probably skip them.\n\nThere’s also a 1997 computer game, simply titled Blade Runner, which tells a self-contained story about a different blade runner, set during the events of the original film. It’s very good, but it’s very difficult to get a copy running today.\n\nAnd then there’s the 1998 movie Soldier, which was written by Blade Runner co-screenwriter David Webb Peoples. It’s not great—and it was a huge flop—but it’s supposed to take place in the same universe, and it includes a few easter eggs for Blade Runner fans.\n\nOkay. Is that everything?\n\nJust one more thing. You're in a desert, walking along in the sand, when all of a sudden you look down and see a tortoise. You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back. The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs, trying to turn itself over. But it can't. Not without your help. But you're not helping.\n\nWhat do you mean I’m not helping?\n\nWatch Blade Runner. It’ll all make sense in the end."
