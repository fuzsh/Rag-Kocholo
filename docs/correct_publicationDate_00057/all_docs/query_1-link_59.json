        "text": "In the book \"The Art and Soul of Blade Runner 2049,\" actor Ryan Gosling says the script did not specify what the significance of the Nabokov quote in the Baseline Test was. According to the same book, the Baseline Test, as we see it in the film, was largely developed by Gosling himself in his research for the character.\n\nWhen Joi asks if K wants to read, I understood him to reply \"you hate that book.\" The original post seems to think it is K who dislikes the book, but I think that's a mistake.\n\nI've only just started reading \"Pale Fire,\" so I can't comment on the content and how it may relate to the themes of the film. However, there may be something to be said about the 'metafiction' of Pale Fire:\n\nNabokov (real author) writes a novel about a fictional author (Charles Kinbote), who is writing about a poem (another creative work of fiction).\n\nIn Blade Runner 2049, real humans have created K (a replicant). K, in turn, owns an artificial life form in Joi.\n\nA flimsy analogy, perhaps, but it would explain why Joi hates the book--it reminds her that she's completely artificial, and has no real agency of her own. She's not even a replicant, she's one rung below them.\n\nHere is a quotation from the book (page 117)\n\nThe Baseline was always a scene to me that held the key to understanding K. I wasn't sure what that key was during the preparation period of the film. In the script, the character was meant to read a small passage from Nabokov's Pale Fire, but there wasn't any insight as to why.\n\nIn order to better understand the meaning of the passage and to give it a personal meaning, I enlisted the help of a wonderful vocal coach named Natsuko Ohama. She suggested a technique called 'Dropping In.' In this technique, you explore the meaning of each word of the text by exhausting every conceivable context in which the would could be used.\n\nThe process is very long and repetitive, but it has a trance-inducing effect that can be very powerful and unsettling. I felt that if that technique were extrapolated into K's experience, it could be used to penetrate his psyche. I believed we could learn through a process of psychological erosion what his true emotional state was.\n\nI was very grateful to Denis for incorporating it into the film, because it unlocked my understanding of K, but also provided insight into the state of mind of those who would force this burden upon him.\"\n\nGosling's text is prefaced by a note by author Tanya Lapointe:\n\nOn July 14th, Day 4 of principal photography, Ryan Gosling delivered and alternate Baseline script that lasted eight minutes. On this page the actor explains his process in achieving such a hypnotic performance.\n\nNow it has been a long time since I read Pale Fire, so some of my details may be off, but there is a crucial scene that plays directly into the motifs of Blade Runner 2049 that I remember quite vividly.\n\nLet's look at the line, \"tall white fountain\". The main character is an editor for a newspaper, and it is his job to sort through poems coming into the paper. He reads a poem written by a man in which he shares the feelings and images he experiences in a near death experience. He mentions seeing a tall white fountain.\n\nThings get even stranger when, reading another newspaper, another poem apparently detailing a near death experience also states \"a tall white fountain\". This is, of course, extremely odd. The chances of two people seeing such a random object in their near death experience are very unlikely. This raises all types of questions. Are these visions linked? Is this evidence of an afterlife?\n\nSo he begins investigating. The woman who originally wrote the poem has since passed away, so he reaches out to the editor to get answers. He asks the editor if the poem he published is exactly similar to the what the woman claims to have seen in her vision. He says something along the lines of \"Yes, I didn't change anything about her poem. However, when I published it,I accidentally wrote 'fountain' instead of 'mountain'. It should be a tall white mountain.\" Thus blowing his entire theory of an otherworldly connection apart.\n\nThis is exactly similar to K's search for answers, believing he was the \"chosen one\", when in reality he was chasing shadows."
