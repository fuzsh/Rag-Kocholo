        "text": "Ridley Scott has signed with Alcon Entertainment to direct and produce a new Blade Runner film. Deadline broke the story this morning,\n\nSpecifically, Alcon holds the rights to use the franchise for purposes of prequels and sequels, but did not purchase the rights to the original Blade Runner movie (also directed by Scott, based on the novel by Philip K. Dick).\n\nThat means there won't be a remake of the first film, but rather a franchise arising around that film as offshoots in some manner. Alcon will likely be developing this project in conjunction with Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\n[See Update below!]\n\nEarlier reports about Alcon obtaining the rights to develop the Blade Runner franchise indicated a publicly stated desire by the studio to work with director Christopher Nolan, he of Batman film fame. But they seemed to be speaking with the assumption that although they were going to of course first see if Ridley Scott was interested, Scott would probably turn the opportunity down. But if Alcon was surprised at Scott's willingness to return to the property, they were no doubt also quite happy about it as well.\n\nIf you've never seen Blade Runner, you can't imagine what you're missing. It remains one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time and a masterpiece of modern filmmaking. Brush up on your Blade Runner lore here, and then take a look at the trailer:\n\nThe original Philip K. Dick novel was titled Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and was quite different from Scott's film. But in developing the franchise anew, and limited from actually remaking or rebooting the original film (and, presumably, the novel from which that film was derived), Alcon still has at their disposal the sequel novels written by author K.W. Jeter. Jeter (a well-known and great sci-fi author, and the man who coined the term \"steampunk\") wrote three sequel books for the Blade Runner series: The Edge of Human, Replicant Night, and Eye and Talon.\n\nAlcon could choose to attempt films inspired by or directly adapted from those sequel novels, or might choose to develop entirely original film concepts for either a prequel or sequel film. The immediately obvious problem with a prequel is, quite simply, that after making a prequel... what next? They cannot remake Blade Runner, so the second film from Alcon would then leapfrog over a previous film into sequel territory, it seems. Unless a string of prequels are made, foregoing any sequels entirely. But that would be problematic in many ways, and almost surely force abandoning any lead-up to the original film.\n\nWhich seems to strongly suggest a sequel makes the most sense, particularly with three books from which to gain inspiration. So I think that sequels are more likely, although obviously we can't know for certain just yet. In the end, Ridley Scott will do what he thinks is best, and I'm sure he'll be right!\n\nIf it's going to be sequels, then the question becomes, \"Recast, or ask Harrison Ford to come back?\" Ford might be willing to return, although if he's already got another Indiana Jones film lined up (as is rumored), he might be reluctant to take on too many sequel projects. On the other hand, Ford likes sequels and makes great ones, and it would be fantastic to see him return to this franchise. Then there is the question of whether Ridley Scott will make films based on the theatrical version of the first film, or his intended \"truth\" about the nature of Ford's Deckard character. If it's the latter, there are potential problems regarding whether or not Deckard would have aged, for example. So there's much to consider here.\n\nIf it were merely that Alcon wants to make a single sequel film, I'd say the best option would be a direct sequel with Ford reprising his role, the age issue made moot by noting that Deckard was made to last much longer due to his profession, and ages like a regular person. Facing the end of his existence, there are all manner of possible great stories to tell from that starting point.\n\nIt's unlikely, however, that Alcon's plan is a single film. So if they still bring Ford back, the first sequel would probably need to set Deckard up as training a new form of Blade Runner. Or an alternative is that a Blade Runner could be sent to hunt down Deckard because he's still on the run and hiding out \"underground,\" maybe even training humans to help a growing Replicant Resistance movement of some sort (to find and stop Blade Runners perhaps?). Whatever the case, I suspect that there would be some passing of the torch to a new character/hero for the continuation of the franchise.\n\nWhile those options sound pretty cool to me, I suspect Alcon and Scott will instead opt to start from scratch with new casting, and pick up shortly after Blade Runner left off. Which means a recasting is in order. Which means it's time for me to make some suggestions!\n\nThe casting of Deckard is of great importance. Wrong casting here could sink the whole project. So my top suggestions would be Russell Crowe, Daniel Craig, Will Smith, Clive Owen, and Christian Bale. I can easily imagine any of them with the close-cropped hair, the trench coat, running down busy New York sidewalks at night while neon lights reflect off the rain-slick streets.\n\nRussell Crowe is also on my short-list of top suggestions for whichever Replicant character is primary in the film. He's gotta be in one of these roles! Along with Crowe on this list is Javier Bardem, Vin Diesel, Michael Kenneth Williams, and Vinnie Jones. Consider their energy and power, the raw intellect and strength they radiate, menacing but also thoughtful and planning, with a perspective on what it means to be human, to face mortality, that few people can truly understand.\n\nFor the female lead, I definitely hope to see Emily Blunt get cast in this film, be it as Rachael or a female Replicant, for her ability to add something regal and classy to downtrodden characters or something edgy and raw to otherwise proper and refined personas. Perhaps Scott will bring Noomi Rapace along as well, which would be awesome in light of how much pure emotion she can convey without speaking a word, the way she can seem vulnerable and unbreakable simultaneously, like a loaded spring on the verge of snapping at any moment.\n\nEva Green has long been on my list as a great option to reprise the role of Rachael in any eventual direct sequel, such a terrific actress with a quality of the classic \"femme fatale\" stars from bygone eras, a sensibility and look that so perfectly suits the character and tone. And Carey Mulligan would likewise be great in as a Replicant nobody thinks to fear but should, similar to Pris being designed for exploitation by human men despite her ability to slay them so easily. Mulligan actually strongly resembles the physical description of Rachael from the original novel, and when I first heard about a Blade Runner revival, I immediately thought of Mulligan as perfect casting as Rachael for any hypothetical remake of the book.\n\nRidley Scott is finishing work on his film Prometheus, a sci-fi horror story linked to his previous film Alien. Prometheus will open in theaters June 8, 2012.\n\nThere is so much potential for a great modern Blade Runner franchise, and with Ridley Scott back in the director's chair I feel confident that whatever choices he makes, we're in for something amazing and unlike whatever we might expect."
