        "text": "According to a recent survey by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 77% of IT leaders plan to invest in generative AI, and 96% of that group are looking to extend AI capabilities to edge locations to capitalize on real-time data processing and decision-making.1 The intense interest in AI at edge locations is not surprising given the potential to enhance customer experiences, streamline operations, and provide competitive advantage — especially leveraging inference AI.\n\nAI inference leverages trained AI models to make predictions or conclusions from net new data. It enables immediate action wherever data is consumed, and it’s changing the way organizations operate at edge locations. There are virtually unlimited use cases for this capability. For instance, AI inference might warn of imminent equipment failure at a remote factory. It can help medical staff monitor patients and improve the quality of healthcare decision-making. AI inference can help banks monitor financial transactions at edge locations and flag suspicious activity in real time.\n\nWhile AI inference unlocks new possibilities, it also creates a unique set of hybrid cloud challenges, any of which can undermine the success of a new AI project before it gains traction. Without a robust hybrid cloud infrastructure, organizations face delays, cost overruns, and the potential for slow adoption when launching AI at the edge.\n\n(1) S&P Global Market Intelligence, “2024 Trends in Data, AI, and Analytics,” November 2023\n\nOrganizations seeking to optimize hybrid cloud performance for AI inference should consider the comprehensive solutions offered through the partnership between Lenovo and Nutanix. This collaboration brings together advanced hardware, software, and global services to deliver scalable, easy-to-manage, and secure AI infrastructure.\n\nThe Lenovo ThinkAgile™ HX series, running Nutanix Cloud Platform, consolidates compute, storage, and virtualization software into plug-and-play building blocks, easily managed in scale-out clusters through a single interface to simplify fleet management of large-scale edge deployments. Maximize high availability with zero-touch deployment and uninterrupted updates, data redundancy features, and cloud backup for maximum uptime.\n\nScale as you grow from a single node to a multi-node cluster with near-limitless edge nodes at remote locations, including the purpose-built Lenovo ThinkAgile™ HX360 V2 Edge, in a pre-validated bundle with Nutanix software and leading open-source AI frameworks to run AI inferencing workloads. Featuring an edge- and ROBO-friendly form factor, the ThinkAgile™ HX360 V2 Edge can take advantage of Nutanix Validated Design for Enterprise Edge with AI, enabling go-live within weeks.\n\nAccording to a 2024 study by ESG2, ThinkAgile HX solutions with Nutanix Cloud Platform provide up to 61% reduced TCO and up to 418% ROI.\n\n(2) Enterprise Strategy Group, “Economic Validation: The Economic Benefits of Lenovo ThinkAgile HX Series with Nutanix Cloud Platform,” May 2024"
