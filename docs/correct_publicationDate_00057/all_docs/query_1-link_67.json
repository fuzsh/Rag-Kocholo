        "text": "Posted by LittleToonCat\n\nMoonbase Commander, one of the very last games ever created in the SCUMM engine, is now finally supported and ready for public testing!\n\nAlthough not an adventure game, Moonbase Commander, developed by Humongous Entertainment (creators of Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam, Backyard Sports, etc.) is a turn-based strategy game that isn’t like any other strategy games at its time. The main objective is to prevent your opponents from taking over a planet before you can. Its unique aim, timing of your power, and launch aspect makes this one of the most “easy-to-learn, hard-to-master” type games. You can easily spawn other hubs from your central hub, spawn collectors at the energy pools, fire projectiles at your opponents’ hubs, the list goes on! It even has a custom map editor, which allows you to create your own maps and share them with other players!\n\nEven though the game can be played via single player Skirmishes and Challenge mode, you can also play multiplayer games either with other people online, or through other devices connected to your Local Area Network, both of which are fully supported! Just click on Multiplayer in the game’s menu and you can create a game and let your friends join! Easy as that!\n\nTired of playing the same maps over and over again? We have incorporated the map generator from the popular fanmade tool Moonbase Console and all of its algorithms and configurations within ScummVM! You can enable this feature by downloading the latest daily build, go to the Game Options dialog and click on the “Generate random maps” checkbox. This will generate a new randomized map when starting a Skirmish or a Multiplayer game. This can be disabled at any time by unchecking the same checkmark.\n\nDedicated players have organized a Discord server, where you can find people willing to play online and discuss all things Moonbase Commander! You can join the server here!\n\nYou can purchase the game on ZOOM-Platform, Steam, or GOG, or download and try the demo, both multiplayer and the map generator are supported there as well!\n\nMany thanks to the current IP holder Rebellion for providing access to the game’s source code to the team!\n\nPosted by DreamMaster\n\nIn a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\n\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\n\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\n\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n\nPosted by djwillis\n\nPlease welcome this year's participants!\n\nOn Wednesday 1st May Google announced the list of participants accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code and we are very happy to report that 4 contributors have been accepted to work on various parts of the ScummVM project this summer.\n\nNow we have had a chance to dot the i's and cross the t's we are really pleased to welcome them all to the project and ask everyone to show them a very warm welcome as they get settled.\n\nIn no particular order, a heartfelt welcome to...\n\nProject: Implementation of a Game Files Integrity Checking System for ScummVM\n\nChike Lee - Chico / InariInDream\n\nScummVM requires game data files to operate. Frequently, especially when copying from the old media, the files can be damaged. Thus, a system that could let the end-users compute checksums and compare them with known good references is desirable.\n\nChike will be looking to extend existing work in this area and complete the end to end implementation during the summer.\n\nProject: Enhance Macromedia Director Support\n\nKrish Ganatra - Krish / Krish28\n\nMacromedia Director is a popular multimedia authoring tool from the 90s, and many iconic adventure titles have been released using it. Improving its support in ScummVM will preserve gaming history and provide players with access to beloved classics.\n\nKrish will be undertaking a range of targeted enhancements to Macromedia Director support in ScummVM to extend compatibility and support.\n\nProject: Porting qdEngine to ScummVM\n\nKunal Tiwari - kunxl.gg\n\nK-D Labs created qdEngine and it has been used in several point-and-click adventure games, primarily in Russian, and also translated into Lithuanian, Czech and English. The most known games are Pilot Brothers 3 and Pilot Brothers 3D.\n\nKunal will be working to bring this engine's code into ScummVM with a goal to add full support for the engine during the summer.\n\nProject: Add Keymapper to multiple Engines\n\nNabeel Shabbir - kashmiri_markhor / NabeelShabbir\n\nScummVM includes a global fully configurable keymapper, but this requires engines to be adapted to use it. The goal of this project is to fully integrate ScummVM keymapper into a large number of our supported engines.\n\nNabeel will be working on this throughout the summer, starting with the larger engines and more advanced keymapper requirements.\n\nWe are now in the community bonding period that runs up until the 27th of May when coding on the projects formally begins.\n\nPlease give them all a very warm welcome, and visit our Discord server if you want to discuss these projects, each project has a dedicated channel.\n\nYou can also expect regular updates from the participants on their respective blogs that will be linked from the planet.\n\nThe team is very excited about these projects - and we hope you are as well.\n\nWe also wanted to take the time to thank everyone who applied to ScummVM for this year's Google Summer of Code programme. Unfortunately, not every application was successful, but we are so grateful for the interest shown and would love you all to still consider helping with ScummVM in some capacity in the future."
