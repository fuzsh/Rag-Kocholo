Yet, these two noble and lofty feelings make their appearance in the foreword to The Fire Now. Love and friendship, to which “tenderness” is added later on, are used by the three editors of this collective project, as the core for their “continuous dialoguing.”\n\nNation and Loyalty in a German-Polish Borderland: Upper Silesia, 1848—1960 by Brendan Karch\n\nReviewed by Brian Gebhart\n\nFor over a decade, historians of Central and Eastern Europe have begun to highlight how the subjects and citizens of states in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries did not always neatly subscribe to the identities projected onto them.\n\nWelfare and the Great Recession: A Comparative Study edited by Stefán Ólafsson, Mary Daly, Olli Kangas, and Joakim Palme\n\nReviewed by Anton Hemerijck\n\nTen years after the first economic crisis of twenty-first century capitalism, Europe seems to have passed the nadir of the Great Recession.

Narratives of the Spanish Civil War and the Dictatorship edited by Lucía Pintado Gutiérrez and Alicia Castillo Villanueva\n\nReviewed by José Luis Fernández Castillo\n\nFrom a general perspective, the authors illustrate how the act of translating was, on many occasions, at the center of political resistance both during the Spanish Civil War and in the long dictatorship that ensued.\n\nHumanism in Ruins: Entangled Legacies of the Greek-Turkish Population Exchange by Asli Iğsız\n\nReviewed by Nergis Canefe\n\nAn engaging analysis of the Greek-Turkish population exchange that moves far beyond conventional attention to nationalism.\n\nWomen at Work in Twenty-First-Century European Cinema by Barbara Mennel\n\nReviewed by Felicity Chaplin\n\nA committed and engaging enquiry into the contradiction between feminism and neoliberalism.\n\nThe Scholems: A Story of the German-Jewish Bourgeoisie from Emancipation to Destruction by Jay Howard Geller\n\nReviewed by Thomas Nolden\n\nBy reframing Gershom Scholem, simply, as a member of a German Jewish bourgeois family, Jay Howard Geller presents a welcome and innovative study of the figure who single-handedly invented an entire field of Jewish religious studies.\n\nGood Governance Gone Bad; How Nordic Adaptability Leads to Excess by Darius Ornston\n\nReviewed by Eric S.

The country’s rapid and unexpected authoritarian turn in recent years has unsettled many observers both at home and abroad.\n\nOrganic Resistance: The Struggle Over Industrial Farming in Postwar France by Venus Bivar\n\nReviewed by Rachel A. Ankeny\n\nWe associate France with the highest of gastronomic ideals, producing artisanal products steeped in the terroir of its diverse regions.\n\nHistory after Hitler: A Transatlantic Enterprise\n\nReviewed by Claudio Minca\n\nThe very question of practicing “history after Hitler” is an enormous one, and I believe that reflecting on its post-war developments is an important task that transcends the boundaries of this specific academic field.\n\nMedicine in First World War Europe: Soldiers, Medics, Pacifists by Fiona Reid\n\nReviewed by Richard S.

Fradera (Trans. Ruth MacKay)\n\nReviewed by Meghan Tinsley\n\nParadoxically, in interweaving the stories of metropolis and colonies, and in emphasizing their mutual constitution, Fradera cedes space for the oppressed.\n\nHearing the City in Early Modern Europe edited by Tess Knighton and Ascensión Mazuela-Anguita\n\nReviewed by David J. Burn\n\nHearing the City is a major contribution at several levels. It re-addresses existing literature from different perspectives as well as covers cities and material not previously treated.\n\nThe Cinema of Louis Malle: Transatlantic Auteur edited by Philippe Met\n\nReviewed by Alison J.

While much migration research still focuses on the shift between sending and receiving contexts, this book smashes that mode of thinking and in turn contributes to our understanding of the lingering effects of cross-border mobility as it is experienced, internalized, and refashioned.\n\nThe Political Economy of Italy’s Decline by Andrea Lorenzo Capussela\n\nReviewed by David Ward\n\nWhat is worse for Italy is that a vicious cycle of corruption seems destined to lead the nation ever more downward and further away from achieving the status of open-access social order.\n\nBittersweet Brexit: The Future of Food, Farming, Land and Labour by Charlie Clutterbuck\n\nReviewed by Rosalind Sharpe\n\nSurprisingly, given how important it is to daily life and the fate of governments, food hardly featured in discussions about Brexit.\n\nThe Italian Executioners: The Genocide of the Jews of Italy by Simon Levis Sullam\n\nReviewed by Sergio Parussa\n\nA detailed, harrowing account of the active participation of ordinary Italians in the deportation of Italian Jews between 1943 and 1945, as well as of the subsequent erasure of their responsibilities and absolution of all guilt during the postwar years.\n\nNorth Africa and the Making of Europe: Governance, Institutions and Culture by Muriam Haleh Davis and Thomas Serres\n\nReviewed by M. Chloe Mulderig\n\nAt a time when nationalist discourse is very much on the rise worldwide, the issue of “European identity” has become pressing and contentious. Threats to the stability of the European Union, along with increasing electoral success of right-wing politicians, are, at least in some part, the consequence of growing mistrust of immigrants and refugees.\n\nTop Incomes in France in the Twentieth Century Inequality and Redistribution, 1901–1998 by Thomas Piketty\n\nReviewed by Stephen Rose\n\nThe more astonishing feature of the French tax regime is how few people pay income taxes. It was only after the end of WWII that more than 20 percent of the population paid income taxes. This share increased steadily to reach 65 percent in 1980.\n\nFood, Religion and Communities in Early Modern Europe by Christopher Kissane\n\nReviewed by Jodi Campbell\n\nChristopher Kissane has written an engaging and informative book that introduces readers to the significant role of food in the social and cultural history of early modern Europe. He paints a broad picture of a range of communities, from Catholic to Protestant, northern to southern, elite to poor. These patterns are illustrated and enriched by the narration of numerous individual experiences of ordinary people whose food practices came into conflict with religious or secular authorities, and therefore left a paper trail.\n\nTight Knit: Global Families and the Social Life of Fast Fashion by Elizabeth Krause\n\nReviewed by Elandre Dedrick\n\nFast fashion has taken the world by storm in recent years, and this book gives ethnographic depth to a growing controversy.\n\nThe Irish Scholarly Presence at St. Gall: Networks of Knowledge in the Early Middle Ages by Sven Meeder\n\nReviewed by Salvatore Cipriano\n\nThe notion that early medieval Ireland was an island of “saints and scholars,” a bastion of civilization-saving monks and their rich corpus of well-travelled books and manuscripts, is something of a popular truism. Scholars, too, have also readily identified Irish scholarship’s significant contributions to monastic, spiritual, and intellectual life in the eight and ninth centuries.\n\nElecting the Pope in Early Modern Italy, 1450-1700 by Miles Pattenden\n\nReviewed by Christopher P. Gillett\n\nIn his new book, Electing the Pope in Early Modern Italy, 1450-1700, Miles Pattenden argues that the unique character of the papal electoral model contributed to the papacy’s increasing economic and structural problems throughout the early modern period.\n\nA Global History of Convicts and Penal Colonies by Clare Anderson\n\nReviewed by Elizabeth Bishop\n\nDuring 2013, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a member of the Russian feminist protest punk rock group Pussy Riot, went missing for twenty-seven days.\n\nLa Parisienne in Cinema: Between Art and Life by Felicity Chaplin\n\nReviewed by Kate Ince\n\nThroughout her book, Chaplin readily acknowledges that la Parisienne is in many ways particularly a nineteenth-century figure, at her strongest in the Second Empire Paris of Haussman and during the early Belle Époque.\n\nOil and Sovereignty: Petroknowledge and Energy Policy in the United States and Western Europe in the 1970s by Rüdiger Graf\n\nReviewed by Stephen Gross\n\nThe surge of populist movements across Europe, which are assaulting the supranational powers of the European Union; the growth of massive financial institutions, which transcend borders with a web of monetary flows; the expansion of firms with global supply chains, which can relocate production around the world; the trade wars unleashed by President Donald Trump, which ostensibly aim to reassert American control over its own economy; can be understood as either causes of or reactions to the perceived decline of the nation state.\n\nBurgundy: Global Anthropology of Taste and Place by Marion Demossier\n\nReviewed by June Brawner\n\nThe qualities of wines have been linked to their places of origin for millennia, though perhaps never with such enthusiasm as in the twenty-first century.\n\nNetworked Remembrance: Excavating Buried Memories in the Railways beneath London and Berlin by Samuel Merrill\n\nReviewed by Brian Ladd\n\nThe widespread fascination with the landscape of underground railways is not difficult to understand. This is a realm frequently visited by large numbers of people who realize that they only glimpse fragments of a much larger system. The fact that these structures lie under the earth, and often lack illumination, ensures that many of us will wonder what might be hidden there, concealed by a cloak of darkness.\n\nProducing History in Spanish Civil War Exhumations: From Archive to Grave by Zahira\n\nReviewed by Jonah S. Rubin\n\nIn this timely volume, Zahira Aragüete-Toribio examines civil society forensic exhumations of Spanish Civil War dead in Extremadura, the region of western Spain where the author grew up. The region, which borders Portugal, saw some of the most intense fighting of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nDemocratic Accountability, Political Order, and Change by Johan P.

War pages of history are comprised of complex and controversial narratives of perpetrators and victims: those who later became celebrated, glorified, forever commemorated; or those who become feared, loathed, pitied, or forever forgotten.\n\nWine and Place: A Terroir Reader by Tim Patterson and John Buechsenstein\n\nReviewed by Elizabeth Carter\n\nA crucial wine debate swirls around the concept of terroir. The term can be approximately, and beautifully, thought of as “somewhereness.”\n\nTurkish Guest Workers in Germany: Hidden Lives and Contested Borders 1960s to 1980s by Jennifer Miller\n\nReviewed by Brittany Lehman\n\nHistorians often rely on a preponderance of evidence to stake their claims. In so doing, however, these scholars frequently get lost in the numbers and the trends, forgetting the individual. Jennifer Miller’s much-needed book shows readers that groups of people—even when they number in the millions—are made up of individuals, each of whom has unique experiences.\n\nThe Culture of Food in England, 1200–1500 by C. M. Woolgar\n\nReviewed by Philip Slavin\n\nThe history of food, both from the production and consumption side, has been arguably one of the most popular scholarly topics in social and economic history\n\nWar, Public Opinion and Policy in Britain, France and the Netherlands, 1785-1815 by Graeme Callister\n\nReviewed by Annie Jourdan\n\nCallister’s book is an ambitious study as it examines the interplay of public opinion, national sentiment, and foreign policy during the period 1785-1815, not only in one, but in three countries.\n\nMy Life as a Spy: Investigations in a Secret Police File by Katherine Verdery\n\nReviewed by Sabrina Papazian\n\nVerdery highlights the vulnerability of her emotions and experiences by sharing fieldnotes where she describes feelings of hopelessness and despair during particular stressful moments in her ethnographic endeavors. She also documents her emotions as she carefully read her secret file in 2010. This introspective dive into Verdery’s psyche makes her research experience and writing relatable.\n\nThe Pyrenees in the Modern Era: Reinventions of a Landscape, 1775-2012 by Martyn Lyons\n\nReviewed by David A.

Clarke, Matthew Goodwin and Paul Whiteley\n\nReviewed by Owen Parker\n\nBrexit was one of the first book-length contributions to this rapidly growing set of stories. Broadly, it is in the camp of those interested in the survey-data-driven “who-voted-what-and-why” question. But unlike many analyses in that camp, it considers the results of the referendum within the broader context of a rigorous and detailed analysis of public opinion during the decade preceding the referendum and of the rise of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), a growing political force, particularly during the latter part of that period.\n\nBack to the Postindustrial Future: An Ethnography of Germany’s Fastest-Shrinking City by Felix Ringel\n\nReviewed by Larissa Stiglich\n\nIn 2009, the year after Felix Ringel arrived to conduct his fieldwork in the former socialist model-city, Hoyerswerda received the new, dubious distinction of the fastest-shrinking city in all of Germany.\n\nThe Limits of Identity: Early Modern Venice, Dalmatia, and the Representation of Difference by Karen-edis Barzman\n\nReviewed by Larry Wolff\n\nThe Venetian republic and the Ottoman Empire, while frequently at war during the early modern centuries, also enjoyed extended periods of closely coordinated diplomatic and commercial relations.\n\nMusical Theater in Europe, 1830–1945 by Michela Niccolai and Clair Rowden\n\nReviewed by Jennifer Walker\n\nThe lion’s share of scholarly literature that treats the subject of European musical theater during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries relegates itself to the study of “high” art, mainly in the form of opera. Musical Theater in Europe, 1830–1945, however, stands as a long-awaited corrective to this issue.\n\nAnti-Semitism and the Holocaust: Language, Rhetoric, and the Traditions of Hatred by Beth A. Griech-Polelle\n\nReviewed by Tatjana Lichtenstein\n\nIn Anti-Semitism and the Holocaust: Language, Rhetoric, and the Traditions of Hatred, Beth Griech-Polelle sets out to investigate the relationship between antisemitism, the construction of a German racial community, and the persecution and murder of Jews during the Second World War.\n\nStyrian Witches in European Perspective: Ethnographic Fieldwork by Mirjam Mencej\n\nReviewed by Mary R. O’Neil\n\nUntil the last several decades, historians would have agreed that European witch beliefs had gradually disappeared following the decline of witch trials during the seventeenth century. However, contemporary researchers have effected an historic revision, documenting the persistence of these archaic beliefs into the twentieth century.\n\nMigrants & Refugees Across Europe by Luigi Moccia and Lia Pop\n\nReviewed by Daniela Irrera\n\nVarious contributions have flourished in recent years regarding the current migration and refugee crisis, raising awareness among academics, practitioners, policy-makers, and public opinion.\n\nDilemmas of Inclusion: Muslims in European Politics by Rafaela M. Dancygier\n\nReviewed by Colin Brown\n\nRecognition of the immigrant-origin electorate, and especially of the Muslim electorate, has grown in Europe in recent years. Academic studies have highlighted the increasing descriptive representation of migrant-background politicians at the local and national level—and have asked why this increase has been uneven.\n\nUnorthodox Kin: Portuguese Marranos and the Global Search for Belonging by Naomi Leite\n\nReviewed by Brandon Hunter\n\nA book about “the desire for belonging” that explores “the ways the cultural logics of kinship inform imaginings of self in relation to others.”\n\nThe Political Economy of Higher Education Finance: The Politics of Tuition Fees and Subsidies in OECD Countries, 1945–2015 by Julian Garritzmann\n\nReviewed by Scott Smith\n\nThis overview of tuition and subsidy regimes is important because of the dearth in empirical data around what drives tuition fees across the OECD, as well as what accounts for the stickiness of subsidies even when governments are led by rightist political parties that traditionally espouse greater privatization and deregulation.\n\nSergei Prokoviev’s “Alexander Nevsky” by Kevin Bartig\n\nReviewed by Jamie Blake\n\nParticularly within the realm of film, landmarks of creativity are rarely the product of a singular mind. Rather, a great cinematic experience is often the result of artistic collaboration at its finest.\n\n“City of the Future”: Built Space, Modernity, and Urban Change in Astana by Mateusz Laszczkowski\n\nReviewed by Adrien Fauve\n\nAs a virtuosic ethnographer and social scientist, he traces evolving aspirations, creative behavior, and unexpected consequences.\n\nShopping Towns Europe: Commercial Collectivity and the Architecture of the Shopping Centre by Janina Gosseye and Tom Avermaete\n\nReviewed by Alejandro J. Gomez-del-Moral\n\nAs a history of the beliefs, expectations, motives, and modus operandi of the architects and urban planners who masterminded postwar Europe’s wave of shopping center construction, this volume is superb.\n\nJewish Salonica: Between the Ottoman Empire and Modern Greece by Devin E. Naar\n\nReviewed by Yaron Ben-Naeh and Tamir Karkason\n\nJewish Salonica is a cornerstone of Sephardi legacy, without which it is impossible to describe the history of Sephardi Jews after their expulsion from the Iberian Peninsula. Alongside Istanbul, Salonica stands at the center of the study on Ottoman Jewry and the Jewish Sephardi Diaspora.\n\nConfessional Cinema: Religion, Film, and Modernity in Spain’s Development Years\n\nReviewed by Jorge Marí\n\nSpanish film aficionados will immediately recognize the image as a frame from Pedro Lazaga’s 1967 comedy Sor Citroën.\n\nCultural Feelings: Mood, Mediation, and Cultural Politics by Ben Highmore\n\nReviewed by Danielle Hanley\n\nHighmore makes a number of provocative and ultimately productive choices for his project. First, he chooses to use the terms “feeling” and “mood” over “affect.” He does so because these terms are vague and allow the author to move between habituated and the emotional, the quotidian and the intense aspects of lived experience.\n\nBelladonna by Daša Drndić, translated from the Croatian by Celia Hawkesworth\n\nReviewed by Lucy Popescu\n\nIn her latest novel, Daša Drndić interweaves fiction, reality, history, and memory to terrific effect.\n\nQueenship in Medieval France, 1300-1500 by Murielle Gaude-Ferragu, translated from the French by Angela Krieger\n\nReviewed by Zita Eva Rohr\n\nWhile the stories of medieval kings, and indeed their kingships, have received considerable scholarly attention for decades, if not for a hundred years or more, studies of medieval queens, and queenship in general, as legitimate fields of cross-disciplinary research really only received their “shot in the arm” following John Carmi Parson’s ground-breaking and durable collection of essays, Medieval Queenship, first published in 1993.\n\nIceland’s Financial Crisis: The Politics of Blame, Protest, and Reconstruction by Valur Ingimundarson, Philippe Urfalino, Irma Erlingsdóttir\n\nReviewed by Alyssa Maraj Grahame\n\nDespite owning the distinction of being the first national economy to experience the full brunt of the financial crisis in 2008, and the first to “recover” from it, Iceland is no exception to widespread patterns of ongoing consequences.\n\nEngines of Empire: Steamships and the Victorian Imagination by Douglas R. Burgess JR.\n\nReviewed by Crosbie Smith\n\nThis is an ambitious, provocative, and at times idiosyncratic book. The dust-jacket fly-leaf declares its broad aims as the telling of “the story of the complex relationship between the Victorians and their wondrous steamships … it is a fascinating glimpse into a world where an empire felt powerful and anything seemed possible – if there was an engine behind it.”\n\nBoys Quarter by Chukwuma Ndulue\n\nReviewed by Naomi Falk\n\nNdulue directs the mind away from imagining stereotypes of times and places and coaxes it towards a sustained patience with language, one that melts the text into the reader.\n\nThree Plastic Rooms by Petra Hůlová, translated from the Czech by Alex Zucker\n\nReviewed by Andrei Rogatchevski\n\nHůlová’s first-person narrative on behalf of a thirty-something female prostitute attempts to establish the image of prostitutes as women of integrity, who provide a service to society by furnishing their clients with “a bit of humanity.”\n\nDecolonization: A Short History by Jan C. Jansen and Jürgen Osterhammel\n\nReviewed by Michael Collins\n\nThe ambitious aim of Jansen and Osterhammel’s Decolonization is to provide a comparative evaluation of an immensely complex global historical process in a relatively concise volume. The authors revised and expanded their original 2013 German language version for the current text, whose purpose is to explain how the de-legitimation of European colonial rule over Africa and Asia during the course of the twentieth century involved a broad array of structural and normative factors.\n\nFlip The Script: European Hip Hop and the Politics of Postcoloniality by J. Griffith Rollefson\n\nReviewed by Séverin Guillard\n\nThis music genre sheds light on postcolonial issues that, despite having been crucial in European politics, have often been put aside in most debates. As immigrants from former colonized countries settle in the heart of the ex-colonial capitals, hip hop helps them to “flip the script” on the dominant discourse on Europe, forcing the nation to see them as an inherent part of its identity.\n\nThe Borders of “Europe” edited by Nicholas De Genova\n\nReviewed by Özden Ocak\n\nThe last few years have left their mark on the history of humankind with the deadliest shipwrecks known to the Mediterranean, unnumbered capsized “migrant boats” trying to reach the European shores, and dead bodies washed ashore after failed attempts to cross European maritime borders—such as Aylan Kurdi, a Syrian boy trying to reach the Greek Island of Kos from Turkey.\n\nCombatants of Muslim Origin in European Armies in the Twentieth Century: Far From Jihad, ed. Xavier Bougarel, Raphaëlle Branche and Cloé Drieu\n\nReviewed by Christopher Tozzi\n\nThese essays offer valuable and fascinating information on the experiences of Muslim troops within diverse regions of Europe during the wars of the twentieth century.\n\nThinking Freedom in Africa: Toward a Theory of Emancipatory Politics by Michael Neocosmos\n\nReviewed by Yousuf Al-Bulushi\n\nWhen Nelson Mandela became South Africa’s first democratically elected president in 1994, much of the Western world rejoiced at the prospect of a “reasonable” transition from apartheid to liberal democracy on the African continent. Mandela was seen by many as the best equipped to realize the goals of freedom, justice, and equality in the African country that had remained under white settler domination for longer than any other on the continent.\n\nViolence as a Generative Force: Identity, Nationalism, and Memory in a Balkan Community by Max Bergholz\n\nReviewed by Keith Brown\n\nThere is an art to communicating the urgency, excitement, and significance of microhistory.\n\nLions of the North: Sounds of the New Nordic Radical Nationalism by Benjamin R. Teitelbaum\n\nReviewed by Cathrine Thorleifsson\n\nTeitlebaum gathers striking empirical knowledge on the role of music and expressive culture in reconfiguring neo-nationalist thought and action.\n\nThe Body and the Screen: Female Subjectivities in Contemporary Women’s Cinema by Kate Ince\n\nReviewed by Michelle Royer\n\nSince the 1980s, Western countries have seen an increasing number of films by female directors who challenge the mainstream representation of women, and attempt to present women’s lives and identities in a new light. Kate Ince’s volume offer new readings of several key French and British female filmmakers of the last twenty-five years, and shows that feminist philosophers can provide the tools for rethinking female subjectivities in cinema.\n\nHistories of Nationalism in Ireland and Germany: A Comparative Study from 1800 to 1932 by Shane Nagle\n\nReviewed by Fearghal McGarry\n\nThe comparative approach has long been recognized as an effective means of analyzing nationalism, even if studies of nationalist movements remain mostly confined within nation-state frameworks. While the appeal of nationalist rhetoric is rooted in its claim to represent the unique values, aspirations, and destiny of a specific national community, comparative studies emphasize the political and cultural commonalities shared by various brands of nationalism.\n\nLiberty or Death: The French Revolution by Peter McPhee\n\nReviewed by Donald Sutherland\n\nUntil fairly recently, historians of the Revolution were reluctant to tell such stories but McPhee shows there were plenty of atrocities and lynchings along with the outrages of the revolutionary tribunals.\n\nNationalizing France’s Army: Foreign, Black and Jewish Troops in the French Military, 1715-1831 by Christopher Tozzi\n\nReviewed by Graeme Callister\n\nThe French Revolution has long been acknowledged as a watershed in the history of France.
