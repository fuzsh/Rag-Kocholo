        "text": "The following is a list of people who were formally indicted for committing war crimes or crimes against humanity on behalf of the Axis powers during World War II, including those who were acquitted or never received judgment. It does not include people who may have committed war crimes but were never formally indicted, or who were indicted only for other types of crimes.\n\nMain article: Nuremberg trials\n\nMartin Bormann – Guilty, sentenced in absentia to death by hanging. Later proven he committed suicide to avoid capture at the end of World War II in Europe, and remains discovered in 1972 were conclusively proven to be Bormann by forensic tests on the skull in 1998. Nonetheless, Simon Wiesenthal, Hugh Thomas and Reinhard Gehlen refused to accept this. Gehlen further argued Bormann was the secret Russian double agent 'Sasha'.\n\nKarl Dönitz – Guilty, sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.\n\nHans Frank – Guilty, sentenced to death by hanging\n\nWilhelm Frick – Guilty, sentenced to death by hanging\n\nHans Fritzsche – Acquitted.
