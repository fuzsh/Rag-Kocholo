        "text": "I\n\nHIS MAJESTY\n\nWE WERE greeted in the reception hall of the Emperor’s villa by an ancient gentleman whom my mother addressed as ‘my dear Count,’ He kissed her hand gallantly and ignored me, possibly because he did not see me. In any case, my own attentions were claimed by a row of glass cases filled with stuffed birds of every description.\n\n‘Poor Rudolf’s birds,’ observed the elderly cavalier, turning to my mother, who later told me that Crown Prince Rudolf had shot and collected the birds in his youth.\n\nWe were conducted up a staircase and through a number of reception rooms, one in grey, another in red, and all—so I was informed in a whisper—formerly used for various purposes by the Empress Elisabeth. We were even allowed to peer into the study that had once belonged to the unhappy Wittelsbach princess. Every square inch of the wall was covered with pictures of the Empress’s best-loved horses. What impressed me most was a large painting of a gorgeously attired zouave who had once, so the Count informed us, been favourite master of hounds to this most capricious of European princesses.\n\nEmerging from this equine museum with its mixture of amiable and demonic-looking fauna, we entered a series of waiting-rooms, in one of which our escort left us. My mother was still nervously adjusting her own gown and my ‘archducal suit’ when the door nearest to us opened and the Count summoned us inside.\n\nI saw a fair-sized desk in one corner, and standing in front of it an extremely old gentleman whose picture I had often seen before. His Imperial and Royal Majesty Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary approached my mother with a light tread, drew her to her feet from the low curtsey into which she had subsided, and conducted her to the other end of the room, where stood an old-fashioned sofa and a few armchairs. He beckoned to her to sit down with an inimitable gesture and left me standing where I was, optimistically hoping that he would ignore me just as his Aide-de-Camp General had done.\n\nNot until we were outside again did my mother tell me that this was the celebrated ‘Emperor’s Corner’, where the sovereigns of Russia, Germany and Austria had once held an historic conference.\n\nWhile the low hum of conversation drifted across to me from the said corner, I stood politely near the door. The longer I stared at the old gentleman the more he seemed to resemble God, and I would no more have dared to approach or address him than I would have dared to accost the Almighty. He was as remote from me as if he were floating on a purple cloud and might ascend into Heaven at any moment.\n\nI cannot recall what the Emperor and my mother chatted about. I only remember that the old man said he was glad the Empress had been ‘spared this’. Presumably he meant the Sarajevo assassination and the risk of war, but he may have been referring to something else—I am not sure.\n\nSuddenly, Almighty God said:\n\n‘So that’s the lad, is it?’\n\nHe raised his hand a fraction and beckoned me over.\n\n‘What’s your name?’\n\n‘Eugen, Your Majesty,’ I stammered, remembering my lines.\n\n‘Well, Eugenio,’ said the voice in my ear, ‘be sure you grow up as a fine man as Eugenio of Savoy. He was a faithful servant of my house.’\n\nI knew something about Eugene of Savoy, thanks to my Christian name. What I did not know was that, if it had not been for this faithful servant of the Habsburgs, the chair opposite me would probably have been occupied, not by His Majesty, but by a Turkish sultan or a descendant of some other arch-enemy of the archducal house in the days of Eugene of Savoy.\n\n‘When were you born?’ was the next question.\n\nI saw my mother bite her lip, but my orders were to speak up boldly, so I said:\n\n‘The twenty-first of August 1900, Your Majesty.’\n\nThen I quailed. Almighty God passed a hand across his eyes as if trying to brush something away. He turned to my mother:\n\n‘Well, well … August twenty-first—just like poor Rudolf.’\n\nI did not understand this, of course, but the moment passed quickly.\n\nThe Emperor opened one of his desk drawers with the slightly tremulous hands of old age. Slowly, he held out the picture of a very lovely woman whom I at once recognised. Thick coils of golden-brown hair were dressed low on her neck, her charming face was overlaid with an expression of gentle melancholy, and the pale-blue ribbon of an order lay draped across her peerless bosom. It was a copy of the famous portrait of Elisabeth of Austria as a young woman, painted by the masterly hand of Franz Schlotzbeck.\n\n‘How beautiful the Empress was,’ Franz Joseph murmured almost inaudibly. ‘Would you like to take your leave now, Baroness?’\n\nHe invariably addressed my mother as ‘Baroness’, which was correct only to the extent that he had made her grandfather a baron and privy councillor many decades earlier. She nodded with tears in her eyes, and the audience was at an end. She gave another curtsey and the old man gallantly escorted her to the door, where the Count reappeared. Then, for the last time, I heard the quiet voice of Europe’s last great emperor:\n\n‘Au revoir, Baroness—until next year, perhaps. It was good of you to visit me. I much appreciated it.’\n\nWe were conducted past the antlers and horses’ heads and through the Imperial Villa’s suite of reception rooms, this time to a side entrance. We were soon to learn why.\n\nWhen we neared the great fountain in front of the colonnaded portico we saw that the grounds were swarming with people—locals and townsfolk, farmers, foresters, soldiers, and countless children carrying bunches of Alpine roses and nosegays of Edelweiss. They stood there, hushed and silent, until the door to the balcony opened and the old, old man emerged as though descending from Olympus.\n\nAt that moment there came to our ears, softly at first, then ever louder, the strains of Haydn’s old Imperial anthem:\n\n‘Gott erhalte …’\n\nWe saw Franz Joseph raise a hand to his cap in salute. Not long afterwards he returned to Vienna, never to see his beloved Ischl, his stags and chamois again. It was 10 July 1914, and Europe stood on the threshold of the First World War.\n\nThe audience in the Imperial Villa at Ischl is my most vivid memory of the old Europe, whose last great monarch Franz Joseph was. I have never forgotten him, and to me, despite all subsequent encounters with the self-styled great, he has remained the embodiment of regal majesty.\n\nMy mother lived on in her native Munich, savouring her innumerable memories of the Habsburg-Wittelsbach era. She continued to give tea-parties accompanied by tarot, the bridge of the contemporary beau monde. Franz Joseph and his Aide-de-Camp General were no more, alas, but Bavarian ministers and generals seemed only too ready to fill the gap.\n\nAs for me, it was time to concentrate seriously on my studies, and I devoted myself to university life.\n\nThe years 1920-6 were rewarding years indeed. What a university, what teachers! When I tick off their names—the historians Marks and Oncken, the art historians Wölfflin and Pinder, Vossler and Strich in the fields of literature—I get the impression that Munich must have undergone a last humanist renaissance at this period. It was a time without mass-activity, without shortages of teaching space and accommodation—a time, moreover, when no motor shows were held in front of the University. Whether eminent or less eminent, celebrated or less celebrated, teachers still had time to spare for their pupils. They used it not only to acquire a personal knowledge of the young men who hoped to graduate under their guidance but to assess their human and intellectual qualities. Universities, and Munich’s Ludwig Maximilian University in particular, had yet to become party-political training establishments or centres of advancement for budding technocrats.\n\nThrough Wölfflin, a man of Swiss calm and composure, I came into contact with his friend and kindred spirit Ricarda Huch. Their duologues on the political and artistic problems of the Thirty Years War afforded me hours of unadulterated pleasure. At the home of my tutor, Oncken, an old National Liberal whose small french beard gave him the look of a latter-day descendant of Napoleon III, I encountered the surviving representatives of German liberalism. Constitutional history figured as prominently in their conversation as the doctrine of the pre-eminence of foreign policy.\n\nJust before Christmas 1926 I graduated under Oncken with a thesis on the problems of imperial policy during the second half of the sixteenth century—and graduated, much to my surprise, magna cum laude. If I have acquired any aptitude for logical and critical thought, I owe it to the distinguished man who was my tutor and patron.\n\nHowever, the really memorable feature of my student days in Munich was provided neither by Oncken, Wölfflin nor Strich, despite the knowledge of history, art and literature which I derived from them. What endowed this period with true lustre was the integrated personality of Vossler, the Romance scholar. It is to him and his courses and lectures on the great French literature of the nineteenth century that I owe my acquaintanceship with two writers who have accompanied me throughout my life. One of them, Stendhal, was to be my constant companion in Italy. My studies in Parma were profoundly coloured by his Chartreuse de Parme, even though I never managed, for all my strenuous endeavours, to discover the location of the Farnese Tower.\n\nThe other, Balzac, became my life’s greatest teacher. As an historian, I have applied myself to the Roman emperors and the Hohenstaufens and made the Roman Popes of the sixteenth century a special field of study. Thanks to my mother, I have preserved an undying regard for the strange and splendid figures of the house of Habsburg. Nevertheless, the world of great historical personalities has never endowed me with as much experience of life, as much knowledge of the human heart and its outward manifestations, as the French writer’s immortal Comédie humaine. Vossler predicted—and hoped—that each of his students would sometime share the moment which fell to the lot of young Baron Rastignac after the burial of the unhappy Père Goriot. I shall never forget how he used to quote passages from this episode by heart:\n\nThus left alone, Rastignac walked a few steps to the highest part of the cemetery, and saw Paris spread out below on both banks of the winding Seine. Lights were beginning to twinkle here and there. His gaze fixed almost avidly upon the space that lay between the column of the Place Vendôme and the dome of the Invalides; there lay the splendid world he had hoped to gain. He eyed that humming hive with a look which foretold its despoliation, as if he already felt on his lips the sweetness of its honey, and said with superb defiance: ‘It’s war between us now.’\n\nI was reminded of this passage on my arrival in Rome, as I stood on the Monte Pincio and watched the clouds in the gathering twilight, but I never formed any such clear-cut decision as Monsieur de Rastignac. To this day, I have no idea how to classify or define the bitter-sweet love for Rome which brought me so much joy and grief. Besides, I had too much of the anti-Rastignac, Lucien de Rubempré, in me to have plunged boldly into the fray. I preferred to leave such decisions to others, which is why I became no more than a Rastignac in Rubempré’s clothing or vice versa.\n\nBe that as it may, my tutor, Oncken, had adjudged me worthy of a grant from the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Knowledge. My field of research, ‘The history of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and his family’ (one of the most important and interesting Italian families of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), was an over-ambitious one. It still amazes me that a cool and rational scholar like Oncken should ever have sanctioned it, but he did. And so, armed with a thick wad of letters of recommendation, I made my way southwards.\n\nIt was spring 1927, and I was bound for Arcadia.\n\nII\n\nARCADIA\n\nALESSANDRO FARNESE—The Great Cardinal’, as even his contemporaries called him—had long fascinated me. I had first come across him in Ludwig von Pastor’s exhaustive but dry-as-dust History of the Popes. The Austrian scholar, whose close relationship with Pope Pius XI earned him the post of Austrian Ambassador to the Holy See, had pronounced Farnese to be well-deserving of a biography. Since the Cardinal belonged to my beloved sixteenth century, and since I was in urgent need of an historical victim to provide me with an entrée to the south, I settled on him.\n\nHe was, and still is, a worth-while subject for biography, but he had the good fortune to escape my own attentions in that respect. In 1945 Allied intelligence agents in Rome found a trunk-ful of documents, testimonials, written records and photographs referring to him. Probably under the impression that Cardinal Farnese was my ‘contact’ at the Vatican, they appropriated all my material on him. I have no idea where they took the trunk, but this is hardly surprising—the secret service is nothing if not secretive. I can, however, commend Alessandro Farnese to the younger generation with a good conscience. Anyone, whether art historian, literary historian or historian proper, could make something of him.\n\nAlessandro Farnese was the eldest grandson of Pope Paul III, who ascended the papal throne in 1534, at the age of sixty-seven, and occupied it until 1549. All Rome wept when Farnese himself died in 1589, and even Pope Sixtus V, a harsh and austere man who cherished no great love for him, is said to have shed a few tears. He died a cardinal, having been a candidate for the papacy in seven successive papal elections. He left magnificent works of art, palaces, villas, and collections of all kinds. His finest property, which he commissioned from Vignola, was his summer residence at Caprarola, near Viterbo, a place famed for its countless fresco-adorned halls and rooms, its fountains and caryatids, gardens and grounds. Titian painted his portrait several times.\n\nSuch was the man to whom I proposed to devote my next few years in Italy. The years spun out into almost two decades and my book remained unwritten, but it would be unjust to pretend that the Allied secret service was exclusively responsible for that. I was equally to blame. Unhappily, I allowed myself to be seduced into concentrating on the story of our own time rather than on the past.\n\nI have no idea how many letters of recommendation Goethe took with him when he travelled to Italy. Personally, I had a large number addressed to the heads of German academic institutes, cardinals and monsignors, professors, authors and scholars. I had some personal letters as well. These derived from my mother’s non-academic but capacious private archives, and proved no less valuable to me. General von Lossow gave me a note for Badoglio, and Konrad von Preger, the Bavarian Ambassador to Berlin (an anachronism which still existed at this time), gave me some visiting-cards to hand in at the two German embassies.\n\nI accordingly paid my calls, armed with some visiting-cards of my own. They were far too expensive, but I think my initial successes were largely due to them. Rome in those days was a veritable paradise for graduates and students, irrespective of their private means. If they had a lot of money, it merely meant that they did not have to cram their bellies as assiduously with the ample refreshments provided at academic gatherings as did those whose pockets were not so well lined.\n\nThe German scholastic triumvirate in the Eternal City was made up of Ludwig Curtius, Director of the Archeological Institute, Ernst Steinmann, owner and administrator of the world-famous Bibliotheca Hertziana, and Paul Kehr, head of the Prussian Historical Institute. It was to them that I turned first. Being a pupil of Oncken, Wölfflin and Strich, I was taken more or less seriously. All three men listened to my Farnese plans and each tried to coax me into a different field. Curtius urged me to devote myself to the Cardinal’s archaeological excavations and collections and Steinmann to his artistic legacy, while Kehr wanted to see me bury my nose in the documentary treasures of the papal archives.\n\nOf the three men who represented German erudition in Rome, Paul Kehr was undoubtedly the most considerable from the scientific point of view. His institute was dominated by the spirit of Mommsen, and it was no coincidence that Mommsen’s grandson Theodor also worked there. Discounting the Hohenstaufen period, my knowledge of the Middle Ages had unfortunately been limited to the minimum necessary for passing my examination. I intended to pursue my Farnese studies, if not in the style of Emil Ludwig or Stefan Zweig, at least in an a fresco manner, and to confine my study of documentary records principally to the vast correspondence between the Cardinal and the great figures of his day, popes and cardinals, scholars, artists and other members of the Farnese family. I wanted to portray his role at the seven conclaves more from the aspect of personal ambition and human tragedy than through the medium of a study of written sources, a field in which von Pastor’s labours had borne far more fruit than mine could ever have done.\n\nFundamentally, I believe that Kehr regarded anything which had not been gleaned from an intensive and unremitting study of written sources as suspect by definition. The archaeologist Ludwig Curtius was his exact scholastic opposite. He always needed a forum to dazzle, an adoring throng to spur him on. Where Kehr was dry, brittle and methodical, Curtius’s lectures had the colour and brilliance of a firework display. If he spoke of Emperor Hadrian in the Villa Albani, a treasure-house of Roman baroque which was generally closed to the public, he was Hadrian. If, at the annual gathering in memory of Winckelmann, he paid tribute to that Nestor of archaeology, he transformed himself into Winckelmann. If he gave an address on Goethe—and he gave many, all of them brimming with wit and fire—one could almost believe that he was a reincarnation of Goethe in Rome. He had the great actor’s gift of pausing for effect while his eyes roved over his doting audience. Not in vain did countless elderly ladies, especially those of the Prussian nobility, spend their winters in Rome in the late ’twenties and early ’thirties. Their hearts throbbed and their eyes shone in the presence of this erudite and glamorous man. I cannot pronounce upon his scientific work, but he, too, afforded me some memorable moments.\n\nCurtius had a shrewd, slightly snobbish wife. I got on well with her and admired her ability, unique in contemporary Rome, to mix a social cocktail out of representatives of the intelligentsia and members of the fashionable society in which she and her husband delighted. The Curtiuses made a point of living in an ancient palazzo in the centre of the old quarter, which automatically endowed their receptions with the requisite atmospheric je ne sais quoi. Whether one had been invited there to meet the Russian émigré circle of Rome, in which case one felt eerily transported into the time of Rasputin and the ill-fated Tsar and Tsarina, or whether Furtwängler was playing—his sister, who was married to Scheler, the philosopher, also worked at the Institute—or whether the ‘Georgianer’, represented by Karl Wolfskehl, already half-blind, and Ernst Kantorowicz, were giving readings from their works, one could always count on enjoying a social or cultural feast.\n\nI made a trip to the Bay of Naples with Kantorowicz, the German Jew who alone grasped the nature of that universal phenomenon, Frederick II, the Hohenstaufen emperor. His account of the Cumaean Sibyl and her prophecy to Aeneas was a blend of classical grandeur and modern intellect in which Virgil himself would have revelled.\n\nIn 1932 I attended Curtius’s last major public lecture, delivered at the German colony’s Goethe celebrations and entitled ‘Goethe as a Phenomenon’. I should like to quote one passage from it. It has not lost its validity, though few people—and certainly not I myself—could have been struck by its tragic topicality at the time:\n\nIt is because our national education is still incomplete—indeed, because it only really begins with Goethe—that the idea of education occupies so central a role both in our world of ideas and in Goethe’s work. Other nations, with the exception of the Russians, do not realise this. They recapitulate and delve deeper into what they already possess, whereas we seek to delve deeper into what we do not have. They mould what they have in common, whereas we are indefatigable in our efforts to formulate what divides us. This is the fundamental source of our present national misfortune.\n\nThe third member of the German academic triumvirate in Rome, Ernst Steinmann, was very much one of the older generation. To any connoisseur of Rome he remained inextricably associated with the Eternal City until his death in 1935, not because he was a great scholar but because his love for Rome was second to none. He loved the art and artists of the imperial and papal metropolis less with his mind, which modestly patrolled the frontiers of genius, than with his whole romantic German soul. He was a typical product of the Kaiser era, with its traditions of princely and feminine patronage. At the court of Kaiser Wilhelm II he had listened with deep emotion to Prince Eulenburg’s Rosenlieder; in Rome he devoted himself heart and soul to Michelangelo, who was not really his meat. He lived in the Palazzo Zuccari, which had been bought by his two patronesses, the inseparable friends Henriette Hertz and Frida Nord, wife of the famous German-born chemist who emigrated to England. At great expense Henriette Hertz had restored the home of the Mannerist painter Zuccari at the beginning of the century and made it a worthy abode for her fine collection of Italian art and her extensive library of works on art history. The latter formed the basis of the celebrated Bibliotheca Hertziana, situated at the junction of two famous streets, the Via Sistina and the Via Gregoriana, where so many artists and authors from Northern Europe lived during the nineteenth century and where Gabriele d’Annunzio maintained the luxurious apartment in which he wrote Il Piacere, that still unsurpassed portrait of Roman mœurs in the ’eighties and ’nineties of the last century.\n\nSteinmann was no d’Annunzio, but he did enjoy the pleasures of life—though in a milder and less voluptuous fashion than ‘il Divino’. Before his final move to the Palazzo Zuccari, the German government had granted him the funds to complete his magnum opus on the Sistine Chapel, now slightly dated but still one of the standard works on Michelangelo’s painting. He then began to collect the world-famous library on the Florentine artist which he later bequeathed, so I believe, to the Vatican.\n\nHis salons, adorned with lively Mannerist frescos, were frequented by old and aristocratic Roman society people of the vintage of Prince Bülow and his mother-in-law, Donna Laura Minghetti. Steinmann was a close friend of the ex-Chancellor. I recall seeing Bülow holding court beside his deaf and half-crippled wife—once one of the most feted women in imperial Berlin—scattering quotations right and left and broadcasting malicious comments on friend and foe in the inimitable style of a latter-day St Simon. Another attractive feature of the receptions at the Hertziana, and one which found particular favour with the ladies, was the presence of the best-looking churchman in contemporary Rome, a Bavarian prince and grandson of Emperor Franz Joseph. After a lamentably brief marriage to an archduchess, Prince Georg bethought himself that the house of Wittelsbach had been entitled, from time immemorial, to a place in the hierarchy of St Peter’s. It was an enviable post which not only entailed no expenditure but was well enough endowed to permit its incumbent an ample opportunity to lead the life of an abbé of the Winckelmann era. The Prince, who was dazzlingly handsome, bore a resemblance to his maternal grandfather in the days before he had become Almighty God in mutton-chop whiskers and was still dashing young Franzl. His soutane, with its small lilac neck-band, suited him perfectly. He accepted the admiration due to him and enjoyed the Library’s Italian-style buffets in a far from purely Platonic manner. Handsome as a god and man of God withal, he used to stand in the centre of a circle of admiring females, mainly of Anglo-Saxon origin. They were not as beautiful as he was, but then the Church pays no heed to outward appearances. One man who enjoyed chatting to him in a slightly mocking fashion was Professor Nogara, director-general of the papal museums and art collections, another enthusiastic amateur of Michelangelo.\n\nErnst Steinmann bestowed his favour on me from my very first visit onwards, either because I resembled one of Michelangelo’s slaves on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or, again, because I knew so many stories about Germany which reminded him of his friend Bülow. He not only took me seriously but, unlike Kehr, did his best to launch me on my forthcoming research into the life of Cardinal Farnese, the great art patron. Schudt, the real brains of the Library and an austere scholar who likened his chief’s social functions to sessions with the dentist, gave me access to all the treasures the Hertziana had to offer on the subject of my cardinal. I was allowed to peruse first editions of Michelangelo’s poems and contemporary descriptions of ‘il Terribile’, some erotic and some genuinely illuminating.\n\nI divided the next few months between serious study and enjoyment. They were comparatively successful months, but success in Rome is short-lived, and I am convinced that the hatred which the Romans still bear for Mussolini is largely attributable to the fact that he was successful for so long. Though no Mussolini, I too enjoyed temporary esteem. Then, when my fund of anecdotes ran out, my star faded and I was forced to look around for new roads to success. I remembered in due course that my cardinal had been a great friend and patron of the Jesuits, and that I had been given a letter of introduction to the Chronicler of the Order, Father Tacchi-Venturi. I also remembered that the writer had conveyed in a mysterious whisper that, as father confessor to Mussolini, Tacchi-Venturi was the Jesuits’ éminence grise.\n\nI was relatively uninterested in the latter information. I had certainly seen large numbers of black shirts and several noisy parades since my arrival in Italy, but not a sign of Mussolini himself. The German and cosmopolitan academics who had welcomed me so hospitably behaved as though he did not exist. He did not annoy anyone, and everyone took care not to annoy him. Besides, what I wanted from Father Tacchi-Venturi was not an audience with Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia but permission to use the Vatican’s archives and libraries—and this I duly obtained.\n\nThe Father lived in the heart of Rome in a palatial baroque building near the Gesù, a church commissioned for the Jesuits by Cardinal Farnese and begun by Vignola in 1568. After passing through a monastery garden, silent save for the gentle plashing of a fountain and enclosed by ancient trees, I was conducted into an equally secluded study. Here a bald priest rose politely from his desk, which was covered with documents and parchment tomes. My letter of introduction lay before him. He spoke excellent German, and I soon found myself drawn into a conversation about my native land. One of his first questions was:\n\n‘Do you know a Signor ’Itler?’\n\nI did not understand him to begin with, but as soon as I realised who he was referring to I told him what I knew about Hitler. He pressed me for details, and I was lucky enough to be able to give him some information acquired at second hand from General von Lossow. He went so far as to make notes, several times murmuring ‘molto interessante’ to himself. We continued to converse about Signor ’Itler until I could think of nothing more to say.\n\nThen he tugged an old-fashioned bell-cord and a deferential young priest appeared. Having dictated two letters on Compagnia di Gesù paper, Father Tacchi-Venturi gave them to me. They were addressed to the Prefect of the Vatican Secret Archives and the Prefect of the Vatican Library, two men with the identical surname of Mercati. The Father explained that the holders of these important posts were brothers. When I took my leave he pressed a thick volume of his history of the Jesuit Order into my hand and invited me to pay him another visit. Having bowed myself out, I decided to take a look at his church—my cardinal’s church—together with the chapel dedicated to St Ignatius, the founder of the Order. The four lapis-lazuli pillars adorning the chapel and the huge effigy of Ignatius, apparently made of silver, did not quite accord with my preconceived notions of the saint’s asceticism. However, I was highly impressed by what his followers had made of the place, and I also knew why my cardinal had taken so much interest in the Society of Jesus.\n\nNext day, after a glorious morning stroll along the side and rear of St Peter’s which took me through Bramante’s courtyards and fresco-covered galleries, I handed in my two letters. Twice I was appraised by alert priestly eyes, and twice I was accorded a cool handshake. Then I was given two reader’s cards stamped with the papal arms and made my way into the spacious halls beyond. They were thronged with busily writing priests of all ages, attired in robes of every hue. Having registered the fact that I was in a temple of erudition, I started to look up ‘Farnese’ in the immense card index. My heart sank. I envisaged spending the rest of my days there, and, lovely though my morning journey to the tree of knowledge had been, the prospect of plucking its fruits seemed arduous in the extreme.\n\nI was still rummaging desperately in the filing cabinets when I felt a light touch on my shoulder. Behind me stood a young, black-clad priest who looked like a converted Siegfried—slim, blond and blue-eyed enough to have excited the attentions of any modern film producer. I must have looked very German myself because he gave me an encouraging smile and offered to help me. He did, in fact, help me a great deal, and we became firm friends. He was living with a number of fellow-priests, most of them equally young, at the Camposanto Teutonico, or German Cemetery, behind the colonnades of St Peter’s Square. Attached to this last resting-place of notable Germans who had died in Rome was a seminary at which young German priests pursued historical or theological research, either independently or in conjunction with the Prussian Historical Institute. There was nothing monastic or ascetic about the Camposanto. Once or twice a year a jovial crowd of German scholars, young and old, used to gather on the terraces of the college, which afforded a superb view of the dome of St Peter’s. A barrel of Bavarian beer would be procured from home, much to the delight of the Italian guests, and everyone—from Curtius and his staff to the gentlemen of the Bibliotheca Hertziana and the Prussian Institute—put in an appearance. Towards midnight, when the Roman moon was shining above St Peter’s, voices would be raised in song—profane rather than sacred. The close proximity of the slumbering Pope lent the scene a unique flavour. Next morning invariably brought caustic complaints and accusations from the eminent old monsignori who were spending the twilight of their days in an adjoining palazzo. They regarded these nocturnal symposia as works of the devil and meet to be condemned. However, since His Royal Highness Monsignor Prince Georg was a regular patroniser of such functions—if only because of the good Bavarian beer, ham and sausages—the devil prevailed after all.\n\nYoung students from the rest of Europe and America invited each other to social gatherings with equal regularity. All the larger nations and many of the smaller possessed institutes of varying elegance, mostly in the Valle Giulia, a valley-like indentation at the foot of the Monte Pincio.\n\nWhat I did not know at the time and only learned in 1945 was that the inmates of the English Academy in the Valle Giulia voluntarily co-operated with their justly renowned Intelligence Service. They did so for no reward other than an agreeable awareness that they were serving their country. Given the necessity for intelligence work, I find this approach to it far more appealing than later techniques of a fundamentally similar but far less light-hearted nature.\n\nThe grandest of these youthful gatherings were given by the French at their embassy on the Quirinal. This was situated in the Palazzo Farnese, begun by my cardinal’s grandfather and completed by his grandson. Because my predilection for Alessandro Farnese had become something of a talking-point, I used to act as a retailer of anecdotes from the turbulent life of the greatest Roman art patron of his day, and, as I stood talking in those fresco- and tapestry-adorned rooms, his successes became my own.\n\nThen, again, when I stood late at night in front of works by Michelangelo and other great names in architecture, my opinion of myself dwindled and I began to feel that it was time to bid the Eternal City a temporary farewell. After all, other parts of Italy were also closely associated with my cardinal and his house. His brother Ottavio had been the Duke of Parma and Piacenza, so the archives and libraries there would undoubtedly contain an abundance of material for my biography. In addition, the name Parma was redolent of violets, Stendhal’s Chartreuse de Parme was one of my favourite books, and it would doubtless be amusing to pick up the trail of Marie Louise, Napoleon’s pleasure-loving consort. It was as Duchess of Parma that she only too swiftly found a replacement for the man she had never been worthy of. In short, I had ample reason to embark on a voyage of discovery and exchange the gay and hectic life of the capital for the provincial calm of Northern Italy.\n\nI have never regretted my six months there. Admittedly, the violets turned out to be a snare and delusion. I never saw fewer violets than I did in Parma, and the scent manufactured from the few there were could only be described as pitiful. The same applied to Stendhal’s celebrated Torre Farnese, the tower in which Fabrizzio del Dongo was incarcerated. It existed only in the author’s imagination, though the palace of the Duchess of Sanseverina and many other enchanting features of his immortal novel were still in existence. I began by concentrating pleasurably on Fabrizzio’s escapades and love-life—that is, until I discovered Maria Louise. Then I forgot all about violets, the Torre Farnese and the Carthusian monastery of Parma.\n\nI am not, of course, referring to Napoleon’s brainless bedmate, who ruled her pretty little duchy reasonably well—with mild sensuality and the assistance of a man or two—from 1816 onwards. No, far from sitting with majestic ennui atop a monument in Parma, my Maria Louise was very much alive. She worked as a librarian in the Public Records Office and had been instructed to initiate me into the archivistic mysteries of her personal domain. She had neither the silly china-blue eyes nor the egg-shell colouring nor the Habsburg lip of the Archduchess. She was as dark as one could have wished, and her velvety almond-shaped eyes had a besotting quality wholly appropriate to a romance in a North Italian duchy. She taught me a great deal. For instance, I still have an exact recollection of Parma—the vast palace of the Farnese; the Pilotta with its three courtyards and its art gallery containing famous paintings by Correggio, who was born in the vicinity of the city; and, above all, the equally famous Teatro Farnese, whose 4500 seats made it the largest theatre in the contemporary world when it was built by a pupil of Palladio in 1620.\n\nMaria Louise knew every ancient street and palace. She drove with me to the summer residence of the Farnese—Colorno, whose peaceful rococo gardens, romantic, time-worn fountains and classical temples of love harmonised perfectly with our mood of youthful enchantment. She also initiated me—this being one sphere of interest which Maria Louise fully shared with her ever-ravenous namesake—into the mysteries of the culinary delights of Emilia, the province to which Parma belongs. My gratitude to her endures to this day. I have never yet eaten ham as tender as that of Parma, never tasted asparagus as delicate as in asparagie alla parmigiana, which is renowned throughout Italy, never encountered a cheese more delicious than fragrant golden-yellow Parmesan, never enjoyed piatto bollito, a dish compounded of tender zamponi, or pigs’ trotters, stewed with beef and a diversity of sausages—a dish to be dissected with the fork alone, as at the court of His Apostolic Majesty in"
