It represents an attempt to screen the wealth of contradictory, conflicting and unreliable ma- terial concerning Hitler into strata which will be helpful to the policy-makers and those who wish to frame a counter-propaganda. For this reason the first three parts are purely descriptive and deal with the man (1) as he appears to himself, (2) as he has been pictured to the German people, and (3) as he is known to his associates. These sections contain the basic material for the psy- chological anaylses in sections IV and V in which an attempt is made to under- stand Hitler as a person and the motivations underlying his actions. The material available for such an analysis is extremely scant and spotty. Fortunately, we have had at our disposal a number of informants who knew Hitler well and who have been willing to cooperate to the best of their abilities. The study would have been entirely impossible were it not for the fact that there is a relatively high degree of agreement in the descriptions of Hitler's behavior, sentiments and attitudes given by these several informants. With this as a basis it seemed worthwhile to proceed with the study filling in the lacunae with knowledge gained from clinical experience in dealing with individuals of a similar type. This is not an entirely satisfactory procedure, from a scientific point of view, but it is the only feasible method at the present time. Throughout the study we have tried to be as objective as possible in evaluating his strengths as well as his weaknesses. All plain numbers in parentheses refer to the page of The Hitler Source- Book, a companion volume in which the original material is to be found together with the complete reference. Numbers in parentheses preceded by M. K. or M. N. 0. refer to pages in Mein Kampf and My New Order, respectively. A detailed Index to the original material is to be found at the beginning of the Source-Book. A complete Bibliography is appended to this study. It is hoped that the study may be helpful in gaining a deeper insight into Adolph Hitler and the German people and that it may serve as a guide for our propaganda activities as well as our future dealings with them.

BRANCH, OSS 4,111.11111M621 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 PART I HITLER - AS HE BELIEVES HIMSELF TO BE Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 HITLER � AS HE BELIEVES HIMSELF TO BE At the time of the reoccupation of the Rhineland, in 1936, Hitler made use of an extraordinary figure of speech in describing his own con- duct. He said: \"I follow my course with the precision and security of a sleep-walker.\" Even at that time it struck the world as an unusual statement for the undisputed leader of 67,000,000 people to make in the midst of an inter- national crisis. Hitler meant it to be a kind of reassurance for his more wary followers who questioned the wisdom of his course. It seems, how- ever, that it was a true confession and had his wary followers only real- ized its significance and implications they would have had grounds for far greater concern than that aroused by his proposal to reoccupy the Rhineland. For the course of this sleep-walker has carried him over many untravelled roads which finally led him unerringly to a pinnacle of success and power never reached before. And still it lured him on until today he stands on the brink of disaster. He will go down in history as the most worshipped and the most despised man the world has ever known. Many people have stopped and asked themselves: \"Is this man sincere in his undertakings or is he a fraud?\" Certainly even a fragmen- tary knowledge of his past life warrants such a question, particularly since our correspondents have presented us with many conflicting views. At times it seemed almost inconceivable that a man could be sincere and do what Hitler has done in the course of his career. And yet all of his former associates, whom we have been able to contact, as well as many of our most capable foreign correspondents, are firmly convinced that Hit- ler actually does believe in his own greatness. Fuchs reports that Hitler said to Schuschnigg during the Berchtesgaden interviews: \"Do you realize that you are in the presence of the greatest German of all time?\" It makes little difference for our own purpose whether he actu- ally spoke these words or not at this particular time, as alleged. In this sentence he has summed up in a very few words an attitude which he has expressed to some of our informants in person. To Rauschning, for example, he once said: \"Aber ich brauche sie nicht, urn mir von ihnen meine geschichtiche Groesse bestaltigen zu lassen.\" (717) And to Strasser, who once took the liberty of saying that he was afraid that Hitler was mistaken, he said: \"I cannot be mistaken. What I do and say is historical!' (378) 1 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Many other such personal statements could be given. Oechsner has sum- med up his attitude in this respect very well in the following words: \"He feels that no one in German history was equipped as he is to bring the Germans to the position of supremacy which all German statesmen have felt they deserved but were un- able to achieve.\" (669) This attitude is not confined to himself as a statesman. He also believes himself to be the greatest war lord as, for example, when he says to Rauschning : \"Ich spiele nicht Krieg. Ich lasse mich nicht von Teldherrn' kommandieren. Den Krieg fuehre i c h. Den eigentlichen guenstigen. Ich werde auf ihn warten. Mit eiserner Ent- Zeitpunkt zum Angriff bestimme i c h. Es gibt nur einen schlossenheit. Und ich werde ihn nicht verpassen \" (701) And it seems to be true that he has made a number of contributions to German offensive and defensive tactics and strategy. He believes himself to be an outstanding judge in legal matters and does not blush when he stands before the Reichstag, while speaking to the whole world, and says: \"For the last twenty-four hours I was the supreme court of the German people.\" (255) Then, too, he believes himself to be the greatest of all German architects and spends a great deal of his time in sketching new buildings and planning the remodeling of entire cities. In spite of the fact that he failed to pass the examinations for admission to the Art School he believes himself to be the only competent judge in this field. A few years ago he appointed a committee of three to act as final judges on all matters of art, but when their verdicts did not please him he dismissed them and assumed their duties himself. It makes little difference whether the field be economics, education, foreign affairs, propaganda, movies, music or women's dress. In each and every field he believes himself to be an un- questioned authority. He also prides himself on his hardness and brutality. \"I am one of the hardest men Germany has had for decades, perhaps for centuries, equipped with the greatest authority of any German leader. . . but above all, I believe in my suc- cess. I believe in it unconditionally.\" (M.N.O. 871) This belief in his own power actually borders on a feeling of omnipotence which he is not reluctant to display. \"Since the events of last year, his faith in his own genius, in his instinct, or as one might say, in his star, is boundless. Those who surround him are the first to admit that he now thinks himself infallible and invincible. That explains why he can no longer bear either criticism or contradiction. To contradict him is in his eyes a crime of `lese majeste'; opposi- 2 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 tion to his plans, from whatever side it may come, is a definite sacrilege, to which the only reply is an immediate and strik- ing display of his omnipotence.\" (French Yellow Book, 945) Another diplomat reports a similar impression: \"When I first met him, his logic and sense of realities had im- pressed me, but as time went on he appeared to me to become more and more unreasonable and more and more convinced of his own infallibility and greatness . . .\" (Henderson, 129) There seems, therefore, to be little room for doubt concerning Hitler's firm belief in his own greatness. We must now inquire into the sources of this belief. Almost all writers have attributed Hitler's confi- dence to the fact that he is a great believer in astrology and that he is constantly in touch with astrologers who advise him concerning his course of action. This is almost certainly untrue. All of our informants who have known Hitler rather intimately discard the idea as absurd. They all agree that nothing is more foreign to Hitler's personality than to seek help from outside sources of this type. The informant of the Dutch Legation holds a similar view. He says: \"Not only has the Fuehrer never had his horoscope cast, but he is in principle against horoscopes because he feels he might be unconsciously influenced by them.\" (655) It is also indicative that Hitler, some time before the war, forbade the practice of fortune-telling and star-reading in Germany. It is true that it looks as though Hitler might be acting under some guidance of this sort which gives him the feeling and conviction in his own infallibility. These stories probably originated in the very early days of the Party. According to Strasser, during the early 1920's Hitler took regular lessons in speaking and in mass psychology from a man named Hanussen who was also a practicing astrologer and fortune-teller. He was an extremely clever individual who taught Hitler a great deal concerning the importance of staging meetings to obtain the greatest dramatic effect. As far as can be learned, he never had any particular interest in the movement or any say on what course it should follow. It is possible that Hanussen had some contact with a group of astrologers, referred to by von Wiegand, who were very active in Munich at this time. Through Hanussen Hitler too may have come in contact with this group, for von Wiegand writes: \"When I first knew Adolph Hitler in Munich, in 1921 and 1922, he was in touch with a circle that believed firmly in the portents of the stars. There was much whispering of the coming of 'another Charlemagne and a new Reich.' How far Hitler believed in these astrological forecasts and prophecies in those days I never could get out of Der Fuehrer. He neither denied nor affirmed belief. He was not averse, however, to making use of the forecasts to advance popular faith in him- self and his then young and struggling movement.\" 3 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 It is quite possible that from these beginnings the myth of his associa- tions with astrologers has grown. Although Hitler has done considerable reading in a variety of fields of study, he does not in any way attribute his infallibility or om- niscience to any intellectual endeavor on his part. On the contrary, he frowns on such sources when it comes to guiding the destiny of nations. His opinion of the intellect is, in fact, extremely low, for in various places he makes such statements as the following: \"Of secondary importance is the training of mental abilities.\" \"Over-educated people, stuffed with knowledge and intellect, but bare of any sound instincts.\" \"These impudent rascals (intellectuals) who always know everything better than anybody else . . .\" \"The intellect has grown autocratic, and has become a dis- ease of life.\" Hitler's guide is something different entirely. It seems certain that Hitler believes that he has been sent to Germany by Providence and that he has a particular mission to perform. He is probably not clear on the scope of this mission beyond the fact that he has been chosen to re- deem the German people and re-shape Europe. Just how this is to be ac- complished is also rather vague in his mind, but this does not concern him greatly because an \"inner voice\" communicates to him the steps he is to take. This is the guide which leads him on his course with the pre- cision and security of a sleep-walker. \"I carry out the commands that Providence has laid upon me.\" (490) \"No power on earth can shake the German Reich now, Divine Providence has willed it that I carry through the fulfillment of the Germanic task.\" (413) \"But if the voice speaks, then I know the time has come to act.\" (714) It is this firm conviction that he has a mission and is under the guidance and protection of Providence which is responsible in large part for the contagious effect he has had on the German people. Many people believe that this feeling of Destiny and mission have come to Hitler through his successes. This is probably false. Later in our study (Part V) we will try to show that Hitler has had this feeling for a great many years although it may not have become a conscious con- viction until much later. In any case it was forcing its way into conscious- ness during the last war and has played a dominant role in his actions ever since. Mend (one of his comrades) , for example, reports :� \"An eine eigenartige Propheseiung errinere ich nich noch in diesem Zusammenhang: Kurz vor Weihnachten (1915) aeus- serte er sich, dass wir noch vieles von ihm hoeren werden. Wir sollen nur abwarten, bis seine Zeit gekommen ist.\" (208) 4 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Then, too, Hitler has reported several incidents during the war which proved to him that he was under Divine protection. The most startling of these is the following: \"I was eating my dinner in a trench with several comrades. Suddenly a voice seemed to be saying to me, 'Get up and go over there.' It was so clear and insistent that I obeyed auto- matically, as if it had been a military order. I rose at once to my feet and walked twenty yards along the trench carrying my dinner in its tin can with me. Then I sat down to go on eating, my mind being once more at rest. Hardly had I done so when a flash and deafening report came from the part of the trench I had just left. A stray shell had burst over the group in which I had been sitting, and every member of it was killed.\" (Price, 241) Then, also, there was the vision he had while in hospital at Pasewalk suf- fering from blindness allegedly caused by gas: \"Als ich im Bett lag kam mir der Gedanke, dass ich Deutsch- land befreien wuerde, dass ich es gross machen wuerde, und ich habe sofort gewusst, dass das verwirklicht werden wuerde.\" (429) These experiences must later have fit in beautifully with the views of the Munich astrologers and it is possible that underneath Hitler felt that if there was any truth in their predictions they probably referred to him. But in those days he did mention any connection between them or dwell on the Divine guidance he believed he possessed. Perhaps he felt that such claims at the beginning of the movement might hinder rather than help it. However, as von Wiegand has pointed out, he was not averse to making use of the forecasts to advance his own ends. At that time he was content with the role of a \"drummer\" who was heralding the coming of the real savior. Even then, however, the role of drummer was not as innocent or as insignificant in Hitler's mind as might be supposed. This was brought out in his testimony during the trial following the unsuc- cessful Beerhall Putsch of 1923. At that time he said: \"Nehmen Sie die Ueberzeugung hin, dass ich die Erringung eines Ministerpostens nicht als erstrebenswert ansehe. Ich halte es eine grossen Mannes nicht fuer wuerdige semen Na- men der Geschichte nur dadurch ueberliefern zu wollen, dass er Minister wird. Was mir vor Augen stand, das war vom ersten Tage tausendmal mehr: ich wollte der Zerbrecher der Marxismus werden. Ich werde die Ausfgabe loesen, und wenn ich sie loese, dann waere der Titel eines Ministers fuer mich eine Laecherlichkeit. Als ich zum ersten Mal vor Richard Wagners Grab stand, da quoll mir das Herz ueber vor Stolz, dass hier em n Mann ruht, der es sich verbeten hat, hinauf- zuschreiben: Hier ruht Geheimrat Musikdirektor Excellenz Baron Richard von Wagner. Ich war stolz darauf, dass dieser Mann und so viele Maenner der deutschen Geschichte sich damit begnuegten, ihren Namen der Nachwelt zu ueber- 5 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 liefern, nicht ihren Titel. Nicht aus Bescheidenheit wollte ich Trommler' sein. Das 1st das Hoechste, das andere ist eine Kleinigkeit.\" After his stay in Landsberg Hitler no longer referred to himself as the \"drummer.\" Occasionally he would describe himself in the words of St. Matthew, \"as a voice crying in the wilderness,\" or as St. John the Baptist whose duty was to hew a path for him who was to come and lead the nation to power and glory. More frequently, however, he referred to himself as \"the Fuehrer\", a name chosen by Hess during their imprison- ment. (901) As time went on, it became clearer that he was thinking of him- self as the Messiah and that it was he who was destined to lead Germany to glory. His references to the Bible became more frequent and the move- ment began to take on a religious atmosphere. Comparisons between Christ and himself became more numerous and found their way into his conversation and speeches. For example, he would say: \"When I came to Berlin a few weeks ago and looked at the traffic in the Kurfuerstendamm, the luxury, the perversion, the iniquity, the wanton display, and the Jewish materialism disgusted me so thoroughly, that I was almost beside myself. I nearly imagined myself to be Jesus Christ when He came to His Father's temple and found it taken by the money-chang- ers. I can well imagine how He felt when He seized a whip and scourged them out.\" (903) During his speech, according to Hanfstaengl, he swung his whip around violently as though to drive out the Jews and the forces of dark- ness, the enemies of Germany and German honor. Dietrich Eckart, who discovered Hitler as a possible leader and had witnessed this perform- ance, said later, \"When a man gets to the point of identifying himself with Jesus Christ, then he is ripe for an insane asylum.\" The identifica- tion in all this was not with Jesus Christ, the Crucified, but with Jesus Christ, the furious, lashing the crowds. As a matter of fact, Hitler has very little admiration for Christ, the Crucified. Although he was brought up a Catholic, and received Communion, during the war, he severed his connection with the Church directly afterwards. This kind of Christ he considers soft and weak and unsuitable as a German Messiah. The latter must be hard and brutal if he is to save Germany and lead it to its destiny. \"My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Saviour as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by only a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love, as a Christian and as a man, I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord rose at last in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of 6 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was the fight for the world against the Jewish poison.\" (M.N.O. 26) And to Rauschning he once referred to \"the Jewish Christ-creed with its effeminate, pity-ethics.\" It is not clear from the evidence whether the new State religion was part of Hitler's plan or whether developments were such that it be- came feasible. It is true that Rosenberg had long advocated such a move, but there is no evidence that Hitler was inclined to take such a drastic step until after he had come to power. It is possible that he felt he needed the power before he could initiate such a change, or it may be that his series of successes were so startling that the people spontaneously adopt- ed a religious attitude towards him which made the move more or less ob- vious. In any case, he has accepted this God-like role without any hesi- tation or embarrassment. White tells us that now when he is addressed with the salutation, \"Heil Hitler, our Savior,\" he bows slightly at the compliment in the phrase� and believes it. (664) As time goes on, it becomes more and more certain that Hitler believes that he is really the \"Chosen One\" and that in his thinking he conceives of himself as a sec- ond Christ who has been sent to institute in the world a new system of values based on brutality and violence. He has fallen in love with the image of himself in this role and has surrounded himself with his own portraits. His mission seems to lure him to still greater heights. Not con- tent with the role of transitory savior it pushes him on to higher goals � he must set the pattern for generations to come. Von Wiegan.d says: \"In vital matters Hitler is far from unmindful of the name and record of success and failure he will leave to posterity.\" (493) Nor is he content to allow these patterns to evolve in a natural way. In order to guarantee the future he feels that he alone can bind it to these principles. He believes, therefore, that he must become an immortal to the German people. Everything must be huge and befitting as a monu- ment to the honor of Hitler. His idea of a permanent building is one which will endure at least a thousand years. His highways must be known as \"Hitler Highways,\" and they must endure for longer periods of time than the Napoleonic roads. He must always be doing the impossible and leav- ing his mark on the country. This is one of the ways in which he hopes to stay alive in the minds of the German people for generations to come. It is alleged by many writers, among them Haffner (418) , Huss (410) and Wagner (489) , that he has already drawn extensive plans for his own mausoleum. Our informants, who left Germany some time ago, are not in a position to verify these reports. They consider them well within the realm of possibility, however. This mausoleum is to be the 7 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 mecca of Germany after his death. It is to be a tremendous monument about 700 feet high, with all the details worked out so that the greatest psychological effect might be attained. It is also alleged that his first errand in Paris after the conquest in 1940 was a visit to the Dome des Invalides to study the monument to Napoleon. He found this lacking in many respects. For example, they had put him down in a hole which forced people to look down rather than high up. \"I shall never make such a mistake,\" Hitler said suddenly. \"I know how to keep my hold on people after I have passed on. I shall be the Fuehrer they look up at and go home to talk of and remember. My life shall not end in the mere form of death. It will, on the contrary, begin then.\" (410) It was believed for a time that the Kehlstein had been originally built as an eternal mausoleum by Hitler. It seems, however, that if that was his original intention he has abandoned it in favor of something even more grandiose. Perhaps the Kehlstein was too inaccessible to enable large numbers of people to come and touch his tomb in order to become inspired. In any case, it seems that far more extravagant plans have been developed. His plan, if it is to be successful, needs constant emotional play on hysteric mass minds, and the more he can arrange the ways and means of achieving this, after he dies, the more assured he is of attaining his final goal. \"He is firmly convinced that the furious pace and the epochal age in which he lived and moved (he really is convinced that he is the motivating force and the moulder of that age) will terminate soon after his death, swinging the world by nature and inclination into a long span of digestive process marked by a sort of quiet inactivity. People in his '1000 year Reich' will build monuments to him and go around to touch and look at the things he has built, he thought. He said as much on that glorified visit of his to Rome in 1938, adding that a thousand years hence the greatness and not the ruins of his own time must intrigue the people of those far-away days. For, believe it or not, that is how the mind of this man Hitler projects itself without a blush over the centuries.\" (410) There was also a time a few years ago when he spoke a good deal about retiring when his work was done. It was assumed that he would then take up his residence in Berchtesgaden and sit as God who guides the destinies of the Reich until he dies. In July, 1933, while visiting the Wagner family, he talked at length about getting old and complained bitterly that ten years of valuable time had been lost between the Beer- hall Putsch in 1923 and his accession to power. This was all very regret- table since he predicted that it would take twenty-two years to get things in adequate shape so that he could turn them over to his successor. (936) It is supposed by some writers that during this period of retirement he would also write a book which would stand for eternity as a great bible of 8 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 National Socialism. (3) This is all rather interesting in view of Roehm's statement made many years ago: \"Am liebsten taet er Heute schon in den Bergen sitzen und den lieben Gott spielen.\" (715) A survey of all the evidence forces us to conclude that Hitler be- lieves himself destined to become an Immortal Hitler, chosen by God to be the New Deliverer of Germany and the Founder of a new social order for the world. He firmly believes this and is certain that in spite of all the trials and tribulations through which he must pass he will finally attain that goal. The one condition is that he follow the dictates of the inner voice which have guided and protected him in the past. This conviction is not rooted in the truth of the ideas he imparts but is based on the conviction of his own personal greatness. (146) Howard K. Smith makes an interesting observation: \"I was convinced that of all the millions on whom the Hitler Myth had fastened itself, the most carried away was Adolph Hitler, himself.\" (290) We will have occasion in Part V to examine the origins of this conviction and the role it plays in Hitler's psychological economy. 9 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 10 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 PART II HITLER - AS THE GERMAN PEOPLE KNOW HIM Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 HITLER � AS THE GERMAN PEOPLE KNOW HIM When we try to formulate a conception of Adolph Hitler as the German people know him we must not forget that their knowledge of him is limited by a controlled press. Many thousands of Germans have seen him in person, particularly in the past, and can use this experience as a basis for their individual conception of him. Hitler, from a physical point of view, is not, however, a very im- posing figure � certainly not the Platonic idea of a great, fighting Leader or the Deliverer of Germany and the creator of a New Reich. In height he is a little below average. His hips are wide and his shoulders relatively narrow. His muscles are flabby; his legs short, thin and spindly, the latter being hidden in the past by heavy boots and more recently by long trousers. He has a large torso and is hollow-chested to the point where it is said that he has his uniforms padded. From a physical point of view he could not pass the requirements to his own elite guard. His dress, in the early days, was no more attractive. He fre- quently wore the Bavarian mountain costume of leather shorts with white shirt and suspenders. These were not always too clean and with his mouth full of brown, rotten teeth and his long dirty fingernails he presented rather a grotesque picture. (F. Wagner) At this time he also had a pointed beard, and his dark brown hair was parted in the middle and pasted down flat against his head with oil. Nor was his gait that of a soldier. \"It was a very ladylike walk. Dainty little steps. Every few steps he cocked his right shoulder nervously, his left leg snapping up as he did so.\" (279) He also had a tic in his face which caused the corner of his lips curl upward. (483) When speaking he always dressed in a common-looking blue suit which robbed him of all distinctiveness. At the trial following the unsuccessful Beerhall Putsch Edgar Mowrer, who saw him for the first time, asked himself: \"Was this provincial dandy, with his slick dark hair, his cut- away coat, his awkward gestures and glib tongue, the terrible rebel? He seemed for all the world like a traveling sales- man for a clothing firm.\" (642) Nor did he make a much better impression later on. Dorothy Thompson, upon her first meeting, described him in the following terms: \"He is formless, almost faceless, a man whose countenance is a caricature, a man whose framework seems cartilaginous, without bones. He is inconsequent and voluble, ill poised and insecure. He is the very prototype of the little man.\" (307) Smith (289) also found him \"the apotheosis of the little man,\" funny looking, self-conscious and unsure of himself. It may be supposed that this is only the judgment of American journalists who have a different standard of masculine beauty. However, Ii Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Hitler in Bavarian Costume 12 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 while testifying as a witness in the law court in 1923, Professor Max von Gruber of the University of Munich, and the most eminent eugenist in Germany, stated: \"It was the first time I had seen Hitler close at hand. Face and head of inferior type, cross-breed; low receding forehead, ugly nose, broad cheekbones, little eyes, dark hair. Expres- sion not of a man exercising authority in perfect self-com- mand, but of raving excitement. At the end an expression of satisfied egotism.\" (575) A great deal has been written about his eyes which have been described in terms of almost every color of the rainbow. As a matter of fact, they seem to be rather a bright blue � bordering on the violet. But it is not the color which has attracted people, but rather their depth and a glint which makes them appear to have a hypnotic quality. One finds stories like the following recurring over and over again in the literature. A policeman who is noted for his antipathy to the Nazi movement is sent to a Hitler meeting to maintain order. While standing at his post Hitler enters: \"He gazed into the police officer's eye with that fatal hypno- tizing and irresistible glare, which swept the poor officer right off his feet. Clicking to attention he confessed to me this morning: 'Since last night I am a National Socialist. Heil Hitler.'\" (Fromm, 369) These stories are not all from the Nazi propaganda agencies. Very reliable people, now in this country, have reported similar incidents among their own personal acquaintances. Even outstanding diplomats have commented on the nature of his eyes and the way in which he uses them when meeting people, often with disastrous effects. Then there are others, like Rauschning, who find his look star- ing and dead � lacking in brilliance and the sparkle of genuine anima- tion. (257) We need not dwell on his eyes and their peculiar quality, however, since relatively few Germans have come in such close contact with him that they could be seriously affected by them. Whatever effect Hitler's personal appearance may have had on the German people in the past, it is safe to assume that this has been greatly tempered by millions of posters, pasted in every conceivable place, which show the Fuehrer as a fairly good-looking individual with a very determined attitude. In addition, the press, news-reels, etc., are continu- ally flooded with carefully prepared photographs showing Hitler at his very best. These have undoubtedly, in the course of time, blotted out any unfavorable impressions he may have created as a real person in the past. The physical Hitler most Germans know now is a fairly presentable in- dividual. 13 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Hitler Entering Meeting in Hamburg 14 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 The only other real contact the overwhelming majority of people have had with Hitler is through his voice. He was a tireless speaker and before he came to power would sometimes give as many as three or four speeches on the same day, often in different cities. Even his greatest op- ponents concede that he is the greatest orator that Germany has ever known. This is a great concession in view of the fact that the qualities of his voice are far from pleasant � many, in fact, find it distinctly un- pleasant. It has a rasping quality which often breaks into a shrill falsetto when he becomes aroused. Nor is it his diction which makes him a great orator. In the early days this was particularly bad. It was a conglomera- tion of high German with an Austrian dialect which Tschuppik (317) describes as a \"knoedlige Sprache.\" Nor was it the structure of his speeches which made him a great orator. On the whole, his speeches were sinfully long, badly structured and very repetitious. Some of them are positively painful to read but nevertheless, when he delivered them they had an extraordinary effect upon his audiences. His power and fascination in speaking lay almost wholly in his ability to sense what a given audience wanted to hear and then to ma- nipulate his theme in such a way that he would arouse the emotions of the crowd. Strasser says of this talent: \"Hitler responds to the vibration of the human heart with the delicacy of a seismograph. . . enabling him, with a cer- tainty with which no conscious gift could endow him, to act as a loudspeaker proclaiming the most secret desires, the least permissible instincts, the sufferings and personal re- volts of a whole nation.\" (376) Before coming to power almost all of his speeches centered around the following three themes: (1) the treason of the November criminals; (2) the rule of the Marxists must be broken; and (3) the world domination of the Jews. No matter what topic was advertised for a given speech he almost invariably would wind up on one or more of these three themes. And yet people liked it and would attend one meeting after another to hear him speak. It was not, therefore, so much what he said that appealed to his audiences as how he said it. Even in the early days Hitler was a showman with a great sense for the dramatic. Not only did he schedule his speeches late in the eve- ning when his audience would be tired and their resistance lowered through natural causes, but he would always send an assistant ahead of time to make a short speech and warm the audience up. Storm-troopers always played an important role at these meetings and would line the aisle through which he would pass. At the psychological moment, Hitler would appear in the door at the back of the hall. Then with a small group behind him, he would march through the rows of S.A. men to reach the speaker's table. He never glanced to the right or to the left as he came down the aisle and became greatly annoyed if anyone tried to accost him 15 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 or hampered his progress. Whenever possible he would have a band pre- sent and they would strike up a lively military march as he came down the aisle. When he began to speak he usually manifested signs of nervous- ness. Usually he was unable to say anything of consequence until he had gotten the feel of his audience. On one occasion, Heiden (499) reports, he was so nervous that he could think of nothing to say. In order to do something he picked up the table and moved it around on the platform. Then suddenly he got the \"feel\" and was able to go on. Price (241) describes his speaking in the following way: \"The beginning is slow and halting. Gradually he warms up when the spiritual atmosphere of the great crowd is engen- dered. For he responds to this metaphysical contact in such a way that each member of the multitude feels bound to him by an individual link of sympathy.\" All of !Dur informants report the slow start, waiting for the feel of the audience. As soon as he has found it, the tempo increases in smooth rhythm and volume until he is shouting at the climax. Through all this, the listener seems to identify himself with Hitler's voice which becomes the voice of Germany. This is all in keeping with Hitler's own conception of mass psy- chology as given in MEIN KAMPF where he says: \"The psyche of the broad masses does not respond to any- thing weak or half-way. Like a woman, whose spiritual sen- sitiveness is determined less by abstract reason than by an indefinable emotional longing for fulfilling power and who, for that reason, prefers to submit to the strong rather than the weakling �the mass, too, prefers the ruler to a pleader.\" And Hitler let them have it. NEWSWEEK (572) reported: \"Women faint, when, with face purpled and contorted with effort, he blows forth his magic oratory. \" Flanner (558) says: \"His oratory used to wilt his collar, unglue his forelock, glaze his eyes; he was like a man hypnotized, repeating himself into a frenzy.\" Yeates-Brown (592) \"He was a man transformed and possessed. We were in the presence of a miracle.\" This fiery oratory was something new to the Germans and par- ticularly to the slow-tongued, lower-class Bavarians. In Munich his shouting and gesturing were a spectacle men paid to see (216) . It was not only his fiery oratory, however, that won the crowds to his cause. This 16 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 was certainly something new, but far more important was the serious- ness with which his words were spoken. \"Everyone of his words comes out charged with a powerful current of energy; at times it seems as if they are torn from the very heart of the man, causing him indescribable an- guish.\" (Fry, 577) \"Leaning from the tribune, as if he were trying to impel his inner self into the consciousness of all these thousands, he was holding the masses and me with them under a hypnotic spell. . . It was clear that Hitler was feeling the exaltation of the emotional response now surging up toward him . . . his voice rising to passionate climaxes. . . his words were like a scourge. When he stopped speaking his chest was still heav- ing with emotion.\" (Ludecke, 164) Many writers have commented upon his ability to hypnotize his audi- ences. Stanley High (453) reports: \"When, at the climax, he sways from one side to the other his listeners sway with him; when he leans forward they also lean forward and when he concludes they either are awed and silent or on their feet in a frenzy.\" Unquestionably, as a speaker, he has had a powerful influence on the common run of German people. His meetings were always crowd- ed and by the time he got through speaking he had completely numbed the critical faculties of his listeners to the point where they were willing to believe almost anything he said. He flattered them and cajoled them. He hurled accusations at them one moment and amused them the next by building up straw men which he promptly knocked down. His tongue was like a lash which whipped up the emotions of his audience. And somehow he always managed to say what the majority of the audience were already secretly thinking but could not verbalize. When the audi- ence began to respond, it affected him in return. Before long due to this reciprocal relationship, he and his audience became intoxicated with the emotional appeal of his oratory. (Strasser, 295) It was this Hitler that the German people knew at first hand. Hitler,the fiery orator,who tirelessly rushed from one meeting to another, working himself to the point of exhaustion in their behalf. Hitler, whose heart and soul were in the Cause and who struggled endlessly against overwhelming odds and obstacles to open their eyes to the true state of affairs. Hitler, who could arouse their emotions and channelize them towards goals of national aggrandizement. Hitler the courageous, who dared to speak the truth and defy the national authorities as well as the international oppressors. It was a sincere Hitler that they knew, whose words burned into the most secret recesses of their minds and rebuked them for their own shortcomings. It was the Hitler who would lead them back to self-respect because he had faith in them. 17 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 002571145 Hitter Addressing an Audience 13 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 002571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 This fundamental conception of Hitler made a beautiful foundation for a propaganda build-up. He was so convincing on the speaker's plat- form and appeared to be so sincere in what he said that the majority of his listeners were ready to believe almost anything good about him be- cause they wanted to believe it. The Nazi propaganda agencies were not slow in making the most of their opportunities. Hitler, himself, had provided an excellent background for a propaganda build-up. From the earliest days of his political career he had steadfastly refused to divulge anything about his personal life, past or present. To his most immediate associates he was, in reality, a man of mystery. There was no clearing away of unpleasant incidents to be done before the building-up process could begin. In fact, the more secrecy he maintained about his personal life the more curious his followers be- came. This was, indeed, fertile ground on which to build a myth or legend. The Nazi propaganda machine devoted all its efforts to the task of portraying Hitler as something extra-human. Everything he did was written up in such a way that it portrayed his superlative character. If he does not eat meat, drink alcoholic beverages, or smoke, it is not due to the fact that he has some kind of inhibition or does it because he be- lieves it will improve his health. Such things are not worthy of the Fuehrer. He abstains from these because he is following the example of the great German, Richard Wagner, or because he has discovered that Hitler's Meals are Very Simple. Only One Pot for Everybody. 19 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 it increases his energy and endurance to such a degree that he can give much more of himself to the creation of the new German Reich. Such abstinence also indicates, according to the propaganda, that the Fuehrer is a person with tremendous will-power and self-disci- pline. Hitler himself fosters this conception, according to Hanfstaengl, for, when someone asked him how he managed to give up these things, he replied: \"It is a matter of will. Once I make up my mind not to do a thing, I just don't do it. And once that decision is made, it is taken for always. Is that so wonderful?\" The same is true in the field of sex. As far as the German people lmow he has no sex life and this too is clothed, not as an abnormality, but as a great virtue. The Fuehrer is above human weaknesses of this sort and von Wiegand (494) tells us that he \"has a profound contempt for the weakness in men for sex and the fools that it makes of them\". Hanfstaengl reports that Hitler frequently makes the statement that he will never marry a woman since Germany is his only bride. However, Hitler with his deep insight into human nature, appreciates these weak- nesses in others and is tolerant of them. He does not even condemn them or forbid them among his closest associates. He is also portrayed in the propaganda as the soul of kindliness and generosity. Endless stories that illustrate these virtues are found over and over again in the literature. Price (236) cites a typical example: an attractive young peasant girl tries to approach him but is prevented from doing so by the guards. She bursts into tears and Hitler, seeing her distress, inquires into the cause. She tells him that her fiance had been expelled from Austria for his Nazi principles and that he cannot find work and consequently they cannot get married. Hitler is deeply touched. He promises to find the young man a job and, in addition, completely furnishes a flat for them to live in, even down to a baby's cot. Every at- tempt is made to present him as extremely human, with a deep feeling for the problems of ordinary people. A great many writers, both Nazi and anti-Nazi, have written extensively about his great love for children and the Nazi press is certainly full of pictures showing Hitler in the company of little tots. It is alleged that when he is at Berchtesgaden he always has the children from the neighborhood visit him in the afternoon and that he serves them candy, ice cream, cake, etc. Phayre (225) says, \"Never was there a middle-aged bachelor who so delighted in the company of children\". Princess Olga reported that when she visited Hitler in Berlin and the topic of children came up during the conversation, Hitler's eyes filled with tears. The Nazi press had made extremely good use of this and end- less stories accompany the pictures. Likewise, a great deal is written about his fondness for animals, particularly dogs. Here again, there are numberless pictures to prove it is so. As far as dogs are concerned, the 20 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 propaganda build-up is Hitler's modesty and simplicity. His successes point in other respects. One writer even went so far as to attribute his vegetarianism to his inability to tolerate the thought of animals being slaughtered for human consumption (405) . Hitler is pictured as an \"affable lord of the manor\", full of gentleness, kindliness and helpfulness, or, as Oechsner puts it, he is the Great Comforter�father, husband, brother or son to every German who lacks or has lost such a relative (668) . Another trait which has received a great deal of comment in the propaganda is probably fairly near the truth but it goes far beyond that have never gone to his head. At bottom he is still the simple soul he was when he founded the Party and his greatest joy is to be considered as \"one of the boys\". As proof of this they point to the fact that he has never sought a crown, that he never appears in gaudy uniforms or does a great deal of entertaining. Even after he came to power he continued to wear his old trench coat and slouch hat for a time and when he donned a uniform it was always that of a simple storm-trooper. Much was written about his fondness for visits from early acquaintances and how he loved to sit down in the midst of his busy day in order to talk over old times. There was really nothing he liked better than to frequent his old haunts and meet old friends while he was in Munich, or to take part in their festivities. At heart he was still a worker and his interests were always with the working classes with whom he felt thoroughly at home. Hitler is also a man of incredible energy and endurance. His day consists of sixteen and eighteen hours of uninterrupted work. He is absolutely tireless when it comes to working for Germany and its future welfare and no personal pleasures are permitted to interfere with the carrying out of his mission. The ordinary man in the street cannot imagine a human being in Hitler's position not taking advantage of his opportunity. He can only imagine himself in the same position revelling in luxuries and yet here is Hitler who scorns them all. His only conclusion is that Hitler is not an ordinary mortal. Phillips (868) reports the case of a young Nazi who once confided to him: \"I would die for Hitler, but I would not change places with Hitler. At least when I wake every morning I can say, 'Heil Hitler!', but this man, he has no fun in life. No smoking, no drinking, no women! �only work, until he falls asleep at night!\" A great deal is made of Hitler's determination. It is pointed out over and over again that he never gives up once he has made up his mind to attain a particular goal. No matter how rough the road, he plods along in unswerving determination. Even though he receives serious set-backs and the situation appears to be hopeless, he never loses faith and always gets what he goes after. He refuses to be coerced into compromises of any sort and is always ready to assume the full responsibility for his actions. The great trials and tribulations through which the. Party had 21 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Typical Picture Illustrating Hitler's Love for Children 22 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Typical Picture Illustrating Hitler's Love for Children 23 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 to pass on its way to power are cited over and over again and all the credit is given to Hitler and his fanatical faith in the future. Even his refusal to permit ordinary scruples to get in his way is given as a sign of his greatness. The fact that he did not communicate with his family for over ten years becomes a great virtue since it meant a severe deprivation to the young man who was determined to make something of himself before he returned home! A great deal of publicity has also been given to his breadth of vision, ability to penetrate the future and his ability to organize both the Party and the country in preparation for obstacles they will have to overcome. According to the propagandists, Hitler is the soul of efficiency and has an extraordinary power of resolving conflicts and simplifying problems which have stumped all experts in the past. In fact, his infalli- bility and incorruptibility throughout are not only implied but openly stated in no uncertain terms. He is also a person of great patience who would never spill u drop of human blood if it could possibly be avoided. Over and over again one hears of his great patience with the democracies, with Czechoslovakia and with Poland. But here, as in his private life, he never loses control of his emotions. Fundamentally, he is a man of peace who desires nothing quite so much as to be left alone to work out the destiny of Germany in a quiet and constructive manner. For he is a builder at heart and an artist, and these prove that the creative and constructive elements in his nature are predominant. This does not mean, however, that he is a coward. On the contrary, he is a person of outstanding courage. His way of life is proof of this, as well as his enviable record during the last war. A great many stories about his decorations for bravery have been circulated and particularly for his outstanding heroism when he was awarded the Iron Cross first-class. The fact that the stories of his performance vary from one time to another does not seem to disturb the people in the least. Fundamentally, according to the Nazi press, Hitler is a man of steel. He is well aware of his mission and no amount of persuasion, co- ercion, sacrifices or unpleasant duties can persuade him to alter his course. In the face of all sorts of disasters and disagreeable happenings and necessary measures, he never loses his nerve for a moment. But he is not hard in human qualities. He places loyalty and justice as the two of the greatest virtues and observes them with scrupulous care. Loyalty means so much to him that the inscription over his door at Berchtes- gaden reads, \"Meine Ehre heisst Treue\". He is the acme of German honor and purity; the Resurrector of the German family and home. He is the greatest architect of all time; the greatest military genius in all history. He has an inexhaustible fount of knowledge. He is a man of action and the creator of new social values. He is indeed, according to the 24 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Nazi propaganda bureau, the paragon of all virtues. A few typical examples may illustrate the extent to which they are carried in their praise of him. \"Zunaechst Hitler selbst : Hitler is der Mann ohne Kom- promiss.

His quality is Messianic; his spiritual trend is ascetic; his reaction is medieval . . .\" Phillips: Ger- many Today and Tomorrow. (868) Hitler not only knows about all these writings but since he has always been the guiding spirit in all German propaganda and usually plans the broad lines that are to be followed, it is safe to assume that he himself is responsible for the instigation and development of this mythi- cal personality. When we look back over the development of this build-up we can see clearly that Hitler, from the very beginning, planned on making himself a mythological figure. He opens MEIN KAMPF with the following passage: \"In this little town on the river Inn, Bavarian by blood and Austrian by nationality, gilded by the light of German mar- tyrdom, there lived, at the end of the '80's of the last century, my parents: the father a faithful civil servant, the mother devoting herself to the cares of the household and looking after her children with eternally the same loving kindness.\" This is the classic way of beginning a fairy tale rather than a serious autobiography or a political treatise. In the very first sentence of the book he implies that Fate was already smiling on him at the time of his birth, for it reads: \"Today I consider it my good fortune that Fate designated Braunau on the Inn as the place of my birth.\" As soon as Hitler came to power new weapons for self-aggrand- izement were put into the hands of the propagandists and they made good use of them. Unemployment dropped off rapidly, roads that the Germans never dreamed of sprung up over night, new and imposing buildings were erected with astounding rapidity. The face of Germany was being lifted at an incredible speed. Hitler was keeping his promises; he was accomplishing the impossible. Every success in diplomacy, every social reform was heralded as world-shaking in its importance. And for each success, Hitler modestly accepted all the credit. It was always Hitler that did this, and Hitler who did that, provided these acts were spec- tacular and met with the approval of the public. If they happened to meet with disapproval, it was always one of his assistants who was to blame. Every effort was made to cultivate the attitude that Hitler was infallible and was carrying through his mission of saving Germany. It was not long before the German people were prepared to take the short step of seeing Hitler, not as a man, but as a Messiah of Ger- many. Public meetings and particularly the Nurnburg took on a religious atmosphere. All the stagings were designated to create a supernatural and religious atmosphere and Hitler's entry was more befitting a god than a man. In Berlin one of the large art shops on Unter den Linden exhibited a large portrait of Hitler in the center of its display window. Hitler's portrait was entirely surrounded as though by a halo, with various 26 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 copies of a painting of Christ (High, 453) . Notes appeared in the press to the effect that, \"Als er sprach, hoerte man den Mantel Gottes durch den Saal rauschen!\" Ziemar reports that on the side of a hill in Odenwald, conspicious as a waterfall, painted on white canvas were the black words: \"We believe in Holy Germany Holy Germany is Hitler! We believe in Holy Hitler! !\" (763) Roberts reports: \"In Munich in the early autumn of 1936 I saw colored pic- tures of Hitler in the actual silver garments of the Knights of the Grail; but these were soon withdrawn. They gave the show away; they were too near the truth of Hitler's men- tality.\" (876) Teeling (565) writes that at the Nurnburg Nazi Party Rally in Septem- ber, 1937, there was a hugh photograph of Hitler underneath which was the inscription, \"In the beginning was the Word . . .\". He also says that the Mayor of Hamburg assured him, \"We need no priests or parsons. We communicate direct with God through Adolph Hitler. He has many Christ-like qualities.\" Soon these sentiments were introduced by official circles. Rauschning (552) reports that the Party has adopted this creed: \"Wir alle glauben auf dieser Erde an Adolph Hitler, unseren Fuehrer, und wir bekennen, dass der National-sozialismus der allein seligmachende Glaube fuer unser Volk 1st.\" A Rhenish group of German \"Christians\" in April, 1937, passed this resolution: \"Hitler's word is God's law, the decrees and laws which repre- sent it possess divine authority.\" (550) And Reichsminister for Church Affairs, Hans Kerrl, says: \"There has arisen a new authority as to what Christ and Christianity really are � that is Adolph Hitler. Adolph Hit- ler . . . is the true Holy Ghost.\" (749) This is the way Hitler hopes to pave his path to immortality. It has been carefully planned and consistently executed in a step by step fashion. The Hitler the German people know is fundamentally the fiery orator who fascinated them and this has gradually been embroidered by the propaganda until he is now presented to them as a full-fledged deity. Everything else is carefully concealed from them as a whole. How many Germans believe it we do not know. Some, certainly, believe it wholeheartedly. Dorothy Thompson writes of such a case: \"At Garmisch I met an American from Chicago. He had been at Oberammergau, at the Passion Play. 'These people are all crazy,' he said. 'This is not a revolution, it's a revival. They think Hitler is God. Believe it or not, a German woman sat next to me at the Passion Play and when they hoisted 27 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Jesus on the Cross, she said, 'There he is. That is our Fuehrer, our Hitler.' And when they paid out the thirty pieces of silver to Judas, she said: 'That is Roehm, who be- trayed the Leader.'\" (568) Extreme cases of this kind are probably not very numerous but it would be amazing if a small degree of the same type of thinking had not seeped into the picture of Hitler which many Germans hold. 28 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 PART III HITLER - AS HIS ASSOCIATES KNOW HIM Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 HITLER � AS HIS ASSOCIATES KNOW HIM The picture the Nazi propaganda machine has painted of Hitler certainly seems like an extravagant one. Even if we ignore the deifying elements, it seems like the fantasy of a superman � the paragon of all virtues. Extraordinary as it may seem, however, there are times at which he approximates such a personality and wins the respect and ad- miration of all his associates. At such times he is a veritable demon for work and often works for several days on end with little or no sleep. His powers of concentration are extraordinary and he is able to penetrate very complex problems and reduce them to a few simple, fundamental factors. He prides himself on this talent and has said to various people: \"I have the gift of reducing all problems to their simplest foundations . . . A gift for tracing back all theories to their roots in reality.\" And he really has it. Unencumbered with abstract theories or tradi- tional points of view and prejudices he is able to look at complex problems in a rather naive way and pick out the most salient and significant ele- ments and apply them to the present situation in a fairly simple and workable manner. To be sure, he never solves the entire problem in this way but only the human elements involved. Since this is the part which interests him most and produces immediate results, it has been rated very highly and has won the admiration of his close associates from the earliest days of his political career. During these periods of activity Hitler is completely absorbed in the task confronting him. Conference follows conference with great rapidity. His judgments are quick and decisive. He is impatient to get things done and expects everyone to apply himself with an ardor equal to his own. He, therefore, demands great sacrifices from his associates. At such times, however, he is also very human. He shows an un- usual degree of considerateness toward others and a certain tolerance of their weaknesses. When he calls a halt for meals he will not eat until his entire staff has been served. When an overzealous servant insists on serving him before others he will often get up and take the plate over to one of his lowly assistants. During all of this he is in the best of spirits and jokes with everyone around him. He has an extraordinary memory and continuously recalls amusing incidents from the past lives of those around him. These he tells to his staff at large. He is an excellent mimic and often plays out the role of the individual involved to the great amusement of the staff while the individual must sit by and witness the performance much to his own embarrassment. Nevertheless he is thoroughly flattered that the Fuehrer 29 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 should single him out and remember him and his actions in such detail. During these periods Hitler is also the soul of kindliness and generosity. He acts more like a big brother to his staff than as a Fuehrer and manages to endear himself to each and every one of them. But, underneath, he is every inch the Fuehrer. He displays extraordinary courage and determination. He shows a great deal of in- itiative and is willing to assume full responsibility for the wisdom of the course he has mapped out. He is very persuasive and is able to muster and organize his people into an efficient smooth-running unit. Personal fric- tions disappear, for the time being, and everybody has but a single thought in mind: To do what the Fuehrer wishes. He works with great certainty and security and appears to have the situation entirely in hand. All kinds of facts and figures relevant to the problem flow from him without the slightest hesitation or effort, much to the amazement of those about him. He can cite the tonnages of ships in various navies: \"He knows exactly what kind of armament, the kind of armor plates, the weight, the speed and the number of the crew of every ship in the British Navy. He knows the number of rotations of airplane motors in every model and type existent. He knows the number of shots a machine gun fires a minute, whether it is a light, medium or heavy one, whether it was made in the United States, Czecho-Slovakia or France.\" (Russell, 747) Then, too, his staff has learned from past experience, that when Hitler is in one of these moods he approximates infallibility particularly when the support of the people is needed to carry through the project on which he is engaged. This may seem like an unwarranted statement but, if our study is to be complete, we must appraise his strengths as well as his weaknesses. It can scarcely be denied that he has some extraordinary abilities where the psychology of the average man is concerned. He has been able, in some manner or other, to unearth and apply successfully many factors pertaining to group psychology, the importance of which has not been generally recognized and some of which we might adopt to good advantage. These might be briefly summarized as follows: (1) Full appreciation of the importance of the masses in the success of any movement. Hitler has phrased this very well in MEIN KAMPF : \"The lack of knowledge of the internal driving forces of great changes led to an insufficient evaluation of the importance of the great masses of the people; from this resulted the scanty interest in the social question, the deficient courting of the soul of the nation's lower classes . . . .\" (p. 138) (2) Recognition of the inestimable value of winning the support of youth; realization of the immense momentum given a social movement 30 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 by the wild fervor and enthusiasm of young people as well as the import- ance of early training and indoctrination. (3) Recognition of the role of women in advancing a new move- ment and of the fact that the reactions of the masses as a whole have many feminine characteristics. As early as 1923, he said to Hanfstaengl (902) : \"Do you know the audience at a circus is just like a woman (Die Masse, das Volk is wie em n Weib) . Someone who does not understand the intrinsicly feminine character of the masses will never be an effective speaker. Ask yourself: 'What does a woman expect from a man?' Clearness, deci- sion, power and action. What we want is to get the masses to act. Like a woman, the masses fluctuate between extremes . The crowd is not only like a woman, but women consti- tute the most important element in an audience. The women usually lead, then follow the children and at last, when I have already won over the whole family � follow the fathers.\" And in MEIN KAMPF, he writes: \"The people, in an overwhelming majority, are so feminine in their nature and attitude that their activities and thoughts are motivated, less by sober consideration than by feeling and sentiment.\" (p. 237) (4) The ability to feel, identify with and express in passionate language the deepest needs and sentiments of the average German and to present oportunities or possibilities for their gratification. (5) Capacity to appeal to the most primitive, as well as the most ideal inclinations in man, to arouse the basest instincts and yet cloak them with nobility, justifying all actions as means to the attainment of an ideal goal. Hitler realized that men will not combine and dedicate themselves to a common purpose unless this purpose be an ideal one cap- able of survival beyond their generation. He has also perceived that al- though men will die only for an ideal their continued zest and enterprise can be maintained only by a succession of more immediate and earthly satisfactions. (6) Appreciation of the fact that the masses are as hungry for a sustaining ideology in political action as they are for daily bread. Any movement which does not satisfy this spiritual hunger in the masses will not mobolize their whole-hearted support and is destined to fail. \"All force which does not spring from a firm spiritual founda- tion will be hesitating and uncertain. It lacks the stability which can only rest on a fanatical view of life. (MK 222) \"Every attempt at fighting a view of life by means of force will finally fail, unless the fight against it represents the form of an attack for the sake of a new spiritual direction. Only in the struggle of two views of life with each other can 31 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 the weapon of brute force, used continuously and ruthlessly, bring about the decision in favor of the side it supports.\" (MK 223) (7) The ability to portray conflicting human forces in vivid, concrete imagery that is understandable and moving to the ordinary man. This comes down to the use of metaphors in the form of imagery which, as Aristotle has said, is the most powerful force on earth. (8) The faculty of drawing on the traditions of the people and by reference to the great classical mythological themes evoke the deep- est unconscious emotions of the audience. The fact that the unconscious mind is more intensely affected by the great eternal symbols and themes is not generally understood by most modern speakers and writers. (9) Realization that enthusiastic political action does not take place if the emotions are not deeply involved. (10) Appreciation of the willingness, almost desire, of the masses to sacrifice themselves on the altar of social improvement or spiritual values. (11) Realization of the importance of artistry and dramatic in- tensity in conducting large meetings, rallies and festivals. This involves not only an appreciation of what the artist � the writer, musician and painter � can accomplish in the way of evoking emotional responses but also the leader's recognition of the necessity of his participation in the total dramatic effect as chief character and hero. Hitler has become mas- ter of all the arts of high-lighting his own role in the movement for a Greater Germany. Shirer (157) describes this very well: \"A searchlight plays upon his lone figure as he slowly walks through the hall, never looking to right or left, his right hand raised in salute, his left hand at the buckle of his belt. He never smiles � it is a religious rite, this procession of the modern Messiah incarnate. Behind him are his adjutants and secret service men. But his figure alone is flooded with light. \"By the time Hitler has reached the rostrum, the masses have been so worked upon that they are ready to do his will. . . .\" (12) A keen appreciation of the value of slogans, catchwords, dramatic phrases and happy epigrams in penetrating the deeper levels of the psyche. In speaking to Hanfstaengl on this point he once used the following figure of speech: \"There is only so much room in a brain, so much wall space, as it were, and if you furnish it with your slogans, the oppo- sition has no place to put up any pictures later on, because the apartment of the brain is already crowded with your fur- niture.\" Hanfstaengl adds that Hitler has always admired the use the Catholic Church made of slogans and has tried to imitate it.\" (899) 32 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 pec acu ar an rama lc ec s In ee zngs 33 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Spectacular and Dramatic Effects in Meeting.; Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Spectacular and Dramatic Effects in Meetings 35 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 (13) Realization of a fundamental loneliness and feeling of isola- tion in people living under modern conditions and a craving to \"belong\" to an active group which carries a certain status, provides cohesiveness and gives the individual a feeling of personal worth and belonging:ness. (14) Appreciation of the value underlying a hierarchical political organization which affords direct contact with each individual. (15) Ability to surround himself with and maintain the allegi- ance of a group of devoted aides whose talents complement his own. (16) Appreciation of winning confidence from the people by a show of efficiency within the organization and government. It is said that foods and supplies are already in the local warehouses when the an- nouncement concerning the date of distribution is made. Although they could be distributed immediately the date is set for several weeks ahead in order to create an impression of super-efficiency and win the confi- dence of the people. Every effort is made to avoid making a promise which cannot be fulfilled at precisely the appointed time. (17) Appreciation of the important role played by little things which affect the everyday life of the ordinary man in building up and maintaining the morale of the people. (18) Full recognition of the fact that the overwhelming majority of the people want to be led and are ready and willing to submit if the e.ader can win their respect and confidence. Hitler has been very suc- cessful in this respect because he has been able to convince his followers of his own self-confidence and because he has guessed right on so many occasions that he has created the impression of infallibility. Spectacular and Dramatic Effects in Meetings 36 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 (19) This was largely possible because he is naturally a tactical genius. His timing of decisions and actions has almost been uncanny. As Thyssen puts it: \"Sometimes his intelligence is astonishing . . . miraculous political intuition, devoid of all moral sense, but extraordin- arily precise. Even in a very complex situation he discerns what is possible and what is not.\" (20) Hitler's strongest point is, perhaps, his firm belief in his mission and,in public, the complete dedication of his life to its fulfillment. It is the spectacle of a man whose convictions are so strong that he sac- rifices himself for the cause which appeals to others and induces them to follow his example. This demands a fanatical stubbornness which Hitler possesses to a high degree. \"Only a storm of glowing passion can turn the destinies of nations, but this passion can only be roused by a man who carries it within himself.\" (21) He also has the ability to appeal to and arouse the sympa- thetic concern and protectiveness of his people, to represent himself as the bearer of their burdens and their future, with the result that he be- comes a personal concern to individuals and many, particularly the women, feel tenderly and compassionately about him. They must always be careful not to inflict undue annoyance or suffering on the Fuehrer. (22) Hitler's ability to repudiate his own conscience in arriving at political decisions has eliminated the force which usually checks and complicates the forward-going thoughts and resolutions of most socially responsible statesmen. He has, therefore, been able to take that course of action which appeals to him as most effective without pulling his punches. The result has been that he has frequently outwitted his ad- versaries and attained ends which would not have been as easily attained by a normal course. Nevertheless, it has helped to build up the myth of his infallibility and invincibility. � (23) Equally important has been his ability to persuade others to repudiate their individual consciences and assume that role himself. He can then decree for the individual what is right and wrong, permissible or unpermissible and can use them freely in the attainment of his own ends. As Goering has said: \"I have no conscience. My conscience is Adolph Hitler.\" (24) This has enabled Hitler to make full use of terror and mobi- lize the fears of the people which he evaluated with an almost uncanny precision. (25) He has a capacity for learning from others even though he may be violently opposed to everything they believe and stand for. The use of terror, for example, he says he learned from the Communists, the 37 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 use of slogans from the Catholic Church, the use of propaganda from the democracies, etc. (26) He is a master of the art of propaganda. Ludecke writes: \"He has a matchless instinct for taking advantage of every breeze to raise a political whirlwind. No official scandal was so petty that he could not magnify it into high treason; he could ferret out the most deviously ramified corruption in high places and plaster the town with the bad news.\" (169) His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your en- emy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it. (27) He has the \"never-say-die\" spirit. After some of his severest set-backs he has been able to get his immediate associates together and begin making plans for a \"come-back.\" Events which would crush most individuals, at least temporarily, seem to act as stimulants to greater efforts in Hitler. These are some of Hitler's outstanding talents and capacities. They have enabled him to attain a position of unprecedented power in an incredibly short period of time, over a rarely used route. No other Nazi in a high position possesses these abilities in any comparable degree and consequently they could not displace him in the minds of the masses. His associates recognize these capacities in Hitler and they ad- mire and respect his extraordinary leadership qualities, particularly the influence he has over people. In addition they love him for his very hu- man qualities when he is at his best and is engaged in some important undertaking. These are aspects of Hitler's personality we should never lose sight of when evaluating his hold on his associates or on the German people. He has a magnetic quality about him which, together with his past accomplishments, wins the allegiance of people and seems to rob them of their critical functions. It is a bond which does not easily dissolve even in the face of evidence that he is not always what he pretends to be � in fact is more often than not, the exact opposite. We have reviewed Hitler's strength and briefly portrayed his character when he is at his best. It is now time to look at the other side of his personality � the side which is known only to those who are on fairly intimate terms with him. Perhaps the truest words that Goebbels ever wrote are: \"The Fuehrer does not change. He is the same now as he was when he was a boy.\" (387) 38 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 If we glance at his boyhood we find that Hitler was far from a model stud- ent. He studied what he wanted to study and did fairly well in these sub- jects. Things which did not interest him he simply ignored even though his marks were \"unsatisfactory\" or \"failing.\" For over a year before his mother died, he did nothing, as far as can be determined, except lie around the house or occasionally paint a few water-colors. Although they were in difficult financial circumstances he did not seek work or try to improve himself in school. He was self-willed, shy and inactive. In Vienna, after his mother died, he continued this pattern even though he was frequently on the verge of starvation and reduced to begging on the streets. Hanisch, who was his flop-house buddy, reports that \"he was never an ardent worker, was unable to get up in the morning, had dif- ficulty in getting started and seemed to be suffering from a paralysis of the will.\" As soon as he had sold a picture and had a little money in his pocket he stopped work and spent his time listening to parliament, read- ing newspapers in the cafes, or delivering lengthy political dissertations to his fellows in the hostel. This behavior he justified on the grounds that \"he must have leisure, he was not a coolie.\" When Hanisch asked him one day what he was waiting for, Hitler replied: \"I don't know myself.\" As an adult he is still this little boy except when he is in one of his active moods. In 1931. Billing wrote: \"Die inneren Schwierigkeiten einer Regierung Hitlers werden in der Person Hitler selbts liegen. Hitler wird nicht umhin koennen, sich an eine geregelte Geistige Taetigkeit zu ge- woehnen.\" (588) Ludecke (168) also wrote: \"He had a typical Austrian `Schlamperei.' He suffered from an all-embracing disorderliness. Naturally this grew less in time but in the beginning it was apparent in everything.\" It was indeed so apparent that early in the history of the movement the party engaged a secretary whose duty it was to keep track of Hitler and see to it that he fulfilled his duties and obligations. The move was only partially succesful, however: \"Hitler was always on the go but rarely on time\" (Ludecke, 168) . He is still rarely on time and frequently keeps im- portant foreign diplomats, as well as his own staff, waiting for consider- able periods of time. He is unable to maintain any kind of a working schedule. His hours are most irregular and he may go to bed any time between mid- night and seven o'clock in the morning and get up anywhere from nine o'clock in the morning to two in the afternoon. In later years the hours tended to get later and it was unusual for him, just before the war, to go to bed before daybreak. The night, however, was not spent in working as his propaganda agents allege but in viewing one or two feature movies, 39 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 endless newsreels, listening to music, entertaining film stars or just sit- ting around chatting with his staff. He seemed to have a violent dislike for going to bed or being alone. Frequently, he would ring for his adju- tants in the middle of the night, after his guests had gone home, and de- mand that they sit up and talk to him. It was not that he had anything to say and often the adjutants would fall asleep listening to him talk about nothing of importance. As long as one of them remained awake, however, he would not be offended. There was an unwritten law among his immediate staff never to ask a question at these early morning ses- sions because to do so might get Hitler off on another subject and force them to remain for another hour. Hitler sleeps very badly and has been in the habit for some years of taking a sleeping powder every night before retiring. It is possible that he demands someone to be with him in the hope that the powder will take effect and he will be overcome with sleep. His behavior, how- ever, is not in keeping with this hypothesis for he carries on a monologue and frequently gets very much stirred up about the topic. This is hardly conducive to sleep and we must suppose that there is some other reason for his late hours. Even after he has dismissed his adjutants and goes to bed he usually takes an armful of illustrated periodicals with him. These are usually magazines with pictures concerning naval and military mat- ters and American magazines are usually included. Shirer (280) reports that he has been informed that since the war broke out Hitler has been keeping better hours and regularly has his first breakfast at seven A.M. and his second breakfast at nine A.M. This may have been so during the early days of the war but it is very doubtful that Hitler could keep up this schedule for any length of time. Rauschning (275) claims that Hitler has a bed compulsion which demands that the bed be made in a particu- lar way with the quilt folded according to a prescribed pattern and that a man must make the bed, before he can go to sleep. We have no other information on this subject but from his general psychological structure such a compulsion would be possible. His working day before the war was equally disorderly. Rausch- ning reports, \"He does not know how to work steadily. Indeed, he is in- capable of working.\" He dislikes desk work and seldom glances at the piles of reports which are placed on his desk daily. No matter how im- portant these may be or how much his adjutants may urge him to attend to a particular matter, he refuses to take them seriously unless it hap- pens to be a project which interests him. On the whole, few reports inter- est him unless they deal with military or naval affairs or political matters. He seldom sits in a cabinet meeting because they bore him. On several occasions when sufficient pressure was brought to bear he did attend but got up abruptly during the session and left without apology. Later it was discovered that he had gone to his private theater and had the operator 40 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 show some film that he liked particularly. On the whole, he prefers to discuss cabinet matters with each member in person and then communi- cate his decision to the group as a whole. He has a passion for the latest news and for photographs of him- self. If Hoffmann, the official Party photographer, happens to appear or someone happens to enter his office with a newspaper he will interrupt the most important meeting in order to scan through it. Very fre- quently he becomes so absorbed in the news or in his own photographs that he completely forgets the topic under discussion. Ludecke (165) writes: \"Even on ordinary days in those times, it was almost possible to keep Hitler concentrated on one point. His quick mind would run away with the talk, or his attention would be dis- tracted by the sudden discovery of the newspaper and he would stop to read it avidly, or he would interrupt your care- fully prepared report with a long speech as though you were an audience And Hanfstaengl reports that \"his staff is usually in despair on account of his procrastination . . . He never takes their protests in this respect very seriously and usually brushes them aside by saying, 'Problems are not solved by getting fidgety. If the time is ripe, the matter will be set- tled one way or another.'\" (899) Although Hitler tries to present� himself as a very decisive in- dividual who never hesitates when he is confronted by a difficult situa- tion, he is usually far from it. It is at just these times that his procras- tination becomes most marked. At such times it is almost impossible to get him to take action on anything. He stays very much by himself and is frequently almost inaccessible to his immediate staff. He often becomes depressed, is in bad humor, talks little, and prefers to read a book, look at movies or play with architectural models. According to the Dutch report (656) his hesitation to act is not due to divergent views among his advisors. At such times, he seldom pays very much attention to them and prefers not to discuss the matter. \"What is known as the mastery of material was quite unim- portant to him. He quickly became impatient if the details of a problem were brought to him. He was greatly adverse to experts' and had little regard for their opinion. He looked upon them as mere hacks, as brush-cleaners and color grinders . \" (269) On some occasions he has been known to leave Berlin without a word and go to Berchtesgaden where he spends his time walking in the country entirely by himself. Rauschning, who has met him on such occasions, says: \"He recognizes nobody then. He wants to be alone. There are times when he flees from human society.\" (275) 41 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Roehm (176) frequently said, \"Usually he solves suddenly, at the very last minute, a situation that has become intolerable and dangerous only be- cause :he vacillates and procrastinates.\" It is during these periods of inactivity that Hitler is waiting for his \"inner voice\" to guide him. He does not think the problem through in a normal way but waits until the solution is presented to him. To Rauschning he said: \"Unless I have the incorruptible conviction: This is the solu- tion, I do nothing. Not even if the whole party tried to drive me to action. I will not act; I will wait, no matter what hap- pens. But if the voice speaks, then I know the time has come to act.\" (268) These periods of indecision may last from a few days to several weeks. If he is induced to talk about the problem during this time he becomes ill-natured and bad-tempered. However, when the solution has been given to him he has a great desire to express himself. He then calls in his adjutants and they must sit and listen to him until he is fin- ished no matter what time it happens to be. On these occasions he does not want them to question him or even to understand him. It seems that he just wants to talk. After this recital to his adjutants Hitler calls in his advisers and informs them of his decision. When he has finished they are free to ex- press their opinions. If Hitler thinks that one of these opinions is worth- while he will listen for a long time but usually these opinions have little influence on his decision when this stage has been reached. Only if someone succeeds in introducing new factors is there any possibility of getting him to change his mind. If someone voices the opinion that the proposed plan is too difficult or onerous he becomes extremely angry and frequently says: \"I do not look for people having clever ideas of their own but rather people who are clever in finding ways and means of carrying out my ideas.\" (654) As soon as he has the solution to a problem his mood changes very radically. He is again the Fuehrer we have described at the begin- ning of this section. \"He is very cheerful, jokes all the time and does not give any- body an opportunity to speak, while he himself makes fun of everybody.\" This mood lasts throughout the period when necessary work has to be done. As soon as the requisite orders have been given to put the plan into execution, however, Hitler seems to lose interest in it. He becomes per- fectly calm, occupies himself with other matters and sleeps unusually long hours. (654) 42 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 This is a very fundamental trait in Hitler's character structure. He does not think things out in a logical and consistent fashion, gather- ing all available information pertinent to the problem, mapping out al- ternative courses of action and then weighing the evidence pro and con for each of them before reaching a decision. His mental processes operate in reverse. Instead of studying the problem as an intellectual would do he avoids it and occupies himself with other things until unconscious processes furnish him with a solution. Having the solution he then begins to look for facts which will prove that it is correct. In this procedure he is very clever and by the time he presents it to his associates, it has the appearance of a rational judgment. Nevertheless, his thought processes proceed from the emotional to the factual instead of starting with the facts as an intellectual normally does. It is this characteristic of his thinking process which makes it difficult for ordinary people to under- stand Hitler or to predict his future actions. His orientation in this re- spect is that of an artist and not that of a statesman. Although Hitler has been extremely successful in using this in- spirational technique in determining his course of action (and we are reminded of his following his course with the precision of a sleep-walker) it is not without its shortcomings. He becomes dependent on his inner guide which makes for unpredictability on the one hand and rigidity on the other. The result is that he cannot modify his course in the face of unexpected developments or firm opposition. Strasser (297) tell us that: \"When he was then confronted by contradictory facts he was left floundering.\" And Roehm says that there is: \"No system in the execution of his thoughts. He wants things his own way and gets mad when he strikes firm opposition on solid ground.\" (176) This rigidity of mental functioning is obvious even in ordinary everyday interviews. When an unexpected question is asked, he is completely at a loss. Lochner (154) supplies us with an excellent description of this re- action: \"I saw this seemingly super-self-confident man actually blush when I broached the theme of German-American relations . . This evidently caught him off-guard. He was not used to having his infallibility challenged. For a moment he blushed like a schoolboy, hemmed and hawed, then stammered an embarrassed something about having so many problems to ponder that he had not yet had time to take up America.\" Almost everyone who has written about Hitler has commented upon his rages. These are well-known to all of his associates and they have learned to fear them. The descriptions of his behavior during these rages vary considerably. The more extreme descriptions claim that at 43 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 the climax he rolls on the floor and chews on the carpets. Shirer (279) reports that in 1938 he did this so often that his associates frequently referred to him as \"Teppichfresser.\" Not one of our informants who has been close to Hitler, people like Hanfstaengl, Strasser, Rauschning, Hohenlohe, Friedelinde Wagner, and Ludecke, have ever seen him behave in this manner. Moreover they are all firmly convinced that this is a gross exaggeration and the informant of the Dutch Legation (655) says that this aspect must be relegated to the domain of \"Greuelmaerchen.\" Even without this added touch of chewing the carpet, his be- havior is still extremely violent and shows an utter lack of emotional control. In the worst rages he undoubtedly acts like a spoiled child who cannot have his own way and bangs his fists on the tables and walls. He scolds and shouts and stammers and on some occasions foaming saliva gathers in the corners of his mouth. Rauschning, in describing one of these uncontrolled exhibitions, says: \"He was an alarming sight, his hair disheveled, his eyes fixed, and his face distorted and purple. I feared that he would collapse or have a stroke.\" (710) It must not be supposed, however, that these rages occur only when he is crossed on major issues. On the contrary, very insignificant matters might call out this reaction. In general they are brought on whenever anyone contradicts him, when there is unpleasant news for which he might feel responsible, when there is any skepticism concern- ing his judgment or when a situation arises in which his infallibility might be challenged or belittled. Von Wiegand (492) reports that among his staff there is a tactic understanding: \"For God's sake don't excite the Fuehrer � which means do not tell him bad news � do not mention things which are not as he conceives them to be.\" Voigt (591) says that: \"Close collaborators for many years said that Hitler was al- ways like this � that the slightest difficulty or obstacle could make him scream with rage. . . .\" Many writers believe that these rages are just play acting. There is much to be said for this point of view since Hitler's first reaction to the unpleasant situation is not indignation, as one would ordinarily expect. He goes off into a rage or tirade without warning. Similarly, when he has finished, there is no aftermath. He immediately cools down and begins to talk about other matters in a perfectly calm tone of voice as though nohting had happened. Occasionally he will look around sheepishly, as if to see if anyone is laughing, and then proceeds with other matters, with- out the slightest trace of resentment. 44 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Approved for Release: 2023/03/01 CO2571145 Some of his closest associates have felt that he induces these rages consciously to frighten those about him. Rauschning (261) , for example, says it is a: � \" . . . . technique by which he would throw his entire entour- age into confusion by well-timed fits of rage and thus make them more submissive.\" Strasser (377) also believes this to be the case for he says: \"Rage and abuse became the favorite weapons in his armory.\" This is not the time to enter into a detailed discussion concerning the nature and purpose of the rages. It is sufficient, for "
