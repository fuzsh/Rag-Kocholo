        "meta_description": "Before it debuts in Canada, the Germany-set drama “Labyrinth of Lies” has already found a North American home. The specialty label has scooped up Giulio Ricciarelli's directorial debut, a fact-based thriller that “exposes the conspiracy of certain prominent institutions and government branches to cover up the crimes of Nazis during WWII.” The film stars Alexander Fehling (“Inglorious Basterds,” “Young Goethe in Love”), André Szymanski, Johann von Bülow and Friederike Becht (“The Reader,” “Young Goethe in Love”) and Gert Voss. In “Labyrinth of Lies” the economic miracle is changing the life of Germans in post-war Germany 20 years later.",

        "text": "In “Labyrinth of Lies” the economic miracle is changing the life of Germans in post-war Germany 20 years later. Most of them are sick of the war and prefer to push their guilt to the back of their mind. When a journalist (André Szymanski) identifies a teacher in the playground as a former guard from Auschwitz, no one wants to take notice. But a young prosecutor (Alexander Fehling) takes on the case and can't even be stopped by his boss. During his research, he realizes that some Germans claim that they never heard the expression “Auschwitz,” while others try to forget about it. As the resolute prosecutor doesn't give up, the Attorney General Fritz Bauer (Gert Voss) retains him to take charge of the investigations. Struggling with an overload of information, the young attorney blunders into a labyrinth of guilt and lies where he almost gets lost."
