        "meta_description": "This chapter traces changing geopolitical views of Germany and their academic and political influence. The geopolitician Halford J. Mackinder remained impressed with Germanyâ€™s advances in geography and spatial literacy, while increasingly seeing that superior knowledge as part of the threat posed by an insurgent Wilhelmine Empire. By the 1940s, though, German geography, through the popular image of Karl Haushofer, had been re-interpreted as a pathological throwback. Anglo-American geopolitics that would greatly influence the post-1945 construction of a new global order relied heavily on both positive and negative images of Germany. In this sense, the vision of Germany and its geopolitics was the foil against which the post-war settlement was framed.",
