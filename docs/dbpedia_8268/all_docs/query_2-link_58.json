        "text": "Kahlil Gibran might be Lebanon’s most well-known and beloved historical poet of the modern age, and in part because I am also Lebanese, his work has a special place in my cultural heart. Interestingly, he is also the best-selling American poet of the 20th Century. (Read his bio below for more details on that.)\n\nIf you read yesterday’s post and clicked through to the insightful analysis, you will have seen today’s poem referenced. This is “The Wise King,” one of Gibran’s prose-poems. I find it somewhat ominous, but pleasing all the same, like Dickinson’s #620.\n\nThe Wise King\n\nOnce there ruled in the distant city of Wirani a king who was both\n\nmighty and wise. And he was feared for his might and loved for\n\nhis wisdom.\n\nNow, in the heart of that city was a well, whose water was cool and\n\ncrystalline, from which all the inhabitants drank, even the king\n\nand his courtiers; for there was no other well.\n\nOne night when all were asleep, a witch entered the city, and poured\n\nseven drops of strange liquid into the well, and said, “From this\n\nhour he who drinks this water shall become mad.”\n\nNext morning all the inhabitants, save the king and his lord\n\nchamberlain, drank from the well and became mad, even as the witch\n\nhad foretold.\n\nAnd during that day the people in the narrow streets and in the\n\nmarket places did naught but whisper to one another, “The king is\n\nmad. Our king and his lord chamberlain have lost their reason.\n\nSurely we cannot be ruled by a mad king. We must dethrone him.”\n\nThat evening the king ordered a golden goblet to be filled from the\n\nwell. And when it was brought to him he drank deeply, and gave it\n\nto his lord chamberlain to drink.\n\nAnd there was great rejoicing in that distant city of Wirani,\n\nbecause its king and its lord chamberlain had regained their reason.\n\n***"
