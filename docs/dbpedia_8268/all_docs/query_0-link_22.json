Hassan\n\nEarly Life\n\nJubrān Khalil Jubrān (1883–1931) was born in the village of Bsharri, in Mount Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman province of Greater Syria, to Khalil Saad Jubrān and Kamila Rahme. Little is known about his childhood in Lebanon, except that he seems to have been a dreamy, withdrawn child who loved to draw and spend time outdoors in the scenic hills that would later inspire his writings about nature [PL. 24]. He had an older half-brother, Buṭ rus, from his mother’s first marriage, and two younger sisters, Sultana and Mariana. His father disliked tending the walnut grove he owned and worked instead as a tax collector. A gambler and heavy drinker, he was arrested for embezzlement and his property was confiscated. Destitute, Kamila took her four children to Boston in 1895, settling in the immigrant slums of the South End. They were part of a large wave of Arab immigrants who left Greater Syria for the Americas in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.\n\nIn Boston, Kamila worked as a pack peddler until she was able to open a small shop that Buṭ rus operated, while Sultana and Mariana worked as seamstresses. Only Khalil was sent to the Quincy School, where a clerk misspelled and shortened his name to Kahlil Gibran, by which he became known beyond the Arab world. He began to learn English at Quincy and to attend art classes at the nearby Denison House, where he soon met avant-garde photographer and publisher Fred Holland Day, who became interested in Gibran’s drawings. Day would have a profound and lasting impact on the twelve-year-old. As Gibran’s nephews and biographers Jean Gibran and Kahlil Gibran put it, Day photographed young Kahlil “in mysterious Arab burnooses, just as he dressed Armenians in turbans, blacks in Ethiopian regalia, Chinese with flutes, Japanese\n\nPL. 24\n\nDrawings from untitled sketchbook (Cedars of Lebanon/Man with fez), c. 1895 in kimonos. … [T]hrough Day’s lens ghetto waifs became ‘Armenian Princes,’ ‘Ethiopian Chiefs,’ and ‘Young Sheiks.’ Day’s titles infused the children with an unexpected sense of privilege and dignity. Kahlil, in particular, fortified his self-image and sought to overcome the reality of a poverty-stricken childhood with a vision of nobility and lineage. With Day’s lofty labeling, he was no longer a slum child who lived in a dark alley; the silvery image of himself which he saw on Day’s platinum-coated plates showed far more. Within a year, he was striving to live up to the grand illusions which Day had caught.”1 Day was also Gibran’s first publisher, using several of the promising boy’s drawings to illustrate Copeland and Day publications. Day’s influence on Gibran must have been worrisome to his mother, for she decided to send the fifteen-year-old back to Lebanon to attend a Maronite school and learn Arabic, which he could speak but neither read nor write. By the time Gibran sailed for Lebanon, he had managed to sell an entire portfolio of his drawings to an editor at Scribner’s. The writer who reported the event in the April 2, 1898, issue of The Critic goes on to say that the drawings “remind one, not unnaturally, of the designs of oriental stuffs. Only one was Americanized, and that was the least successful. Now I wonder why more Syrians, Turks, and other Orientals with whom New York abounds have not tried their hands at this sort of work before.”2 Perhaps unwittingly, this writer pointed the way to success for “Oriental” writers and artists in the United States: they can thrive so long as they cater to the perceived public taste for exotica but not when they address “Americanized” topics. Gibran learned this lesson all too well.\n\nHe returned to Boston in 1902, shortly after Sultana’s death of tuberculosis. The following year, Buṭ rus died of the same disease and Kamila of cancer. Gibran looked after the shop until its debts were paid and then lived on Mariana’s earnings. Day arranged an exhibit for Gibran’s work in 1904, at which Gibran met Mary Haskell, a school principal who would become his patron, friend, and editor of the English-language books he wrote in the second phase of his writing career, from 1918 onwards [PL. 93]. His first, Arabic phase, however, began in this early period with a weekly column in al-Muhājir (The Immigrant), one of several Arabic-language newspapers published in New York. The paper also published his early Arabic-language books: a short treatise on music (1905), three short stories in a volume entitled ‘Arā’is al-Murūj (1906, Spirit Brides, later translated under the whimsical title Nymphs of the Valley in 1945), another short story collection called al-Arwā al-Mutamirrida (1908, Spirits Rebellious), the novella al-Ajniḥ a al-Mutakassira (1912, The Broken Wings), and finally his collected columns under the title Dam‘a wa Ibtisāma (1914, A Tear and a Smile). Largely sentimental, these works criticize social conditions in Lebanon, patriarchal conventions, restrictions on personal freedom, and the corruption of Maronite clergy. From 1908 to 1910, Haskell sponsored Gibran’s art studies in Paris, where he was first exposed to works that would leave a clear mark on his own: the paintings of William Blake and Eugène Carrière, the sculptures of August Rodin, and the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. Back in the United States, he moved to New York City.\n\n2 Quoted in Gibran and Gibran, Kahlil Gibran, 65.\n\nMahjar Writer\n\nAlthough Gibran’s Arabic-language works won recognition in the Arab world, he was not the only or the first Arab American writer. That latter distinction belongs to Ameen Rihani (1876–1940) [PLS. 25, 98, 99], prolific writer in Arabic and English and the author of the first Arab American novel written in English, The Book of Khalid (1911), for which Gibran provided the cover and in-text illustrations [PL. 26]. The protagonist of Rihani’s novel also seems to have served as a blueprint for the titular character of Gibran’s The Prophet (1923). Rihani and Gibran met in Paris in June of 1910 and traveled together to London that summer. Gibran admired his elder compatriot, with whom he shared similar ideas about art, literature, and politics, and who had in 1905 already introduced Arabic prose poetry, a genre that Gibran would also use. Rihani spearheaded a group of Lebanese writers in New York who came to be known in Arabic as the Mahjar (immigrant) school, which included Mikhail Naimy, Elia Abu Madi, Nasib Arida, Nadra Haddad, and Rashid Ayyub. They rejected the time-honored conventions of classical Arabic poetry, conventions that had recently been infused with new vigor by leading poets in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century. Mostly self-taught, by contrast, the Mahjar group of New York lacked the formal Arabic education expected of poets, and their knowledge of European literature was also eclectic. Looking for a freer, more fluid poetic medium to express their social and political criticism, they were captivated by European Romantics and American Transcendentalists like Rousseau, Blake, Wordsworth, Keats, Shelly, Emerson, and\n\nPL. 25\n\nProfiles of Rihani, Gibran, and Marie, December 2, 1910\n\nPL. 26\n\nAmeen Rihani (author), Kahlil Gibran (illustrator), published by Dodd, Mead and Company, Pages from The Book of Khalid, 1911\n\nWhitman but were repelled by the various styles of modernist literature and art.\n\nIt was not surprising, therefore, that the Mahjar group experimented with prose poetry and used simpler form and diction. They played an important role in the history of modern Arabic poetry that M. M. Badawi describes this way:\n\nBy introducing a new conception of poetry, by adding a spiritual dimension to it, so to speak, by turning away from rhetoric and declamation, by concentrating on the more subjective experience of man in relation to nature and ultimate questions, by introducing biblical themes and images into their poetry, by their preference for short meters and stanzaic forms, the Mahjar poets, especially of the United States, exercised a liberating influence upon modern Arabic poetry. Indeed their extremist views were often rejected, the revolt of some of them against Arabic versification which resulted in the once fashionable prose poetry of Rihani and Jibran, proved to all intents and purposes to be a dead end, at least until recently; their language was sometimes severely criticized for not being sufficiently correct or even grammatical, and the tendency of many of them to turn their back on the Arab cultural past was often violently attacked. Nonetheless, it would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of the role they played in the development of modern Arabic poetry, and of the subtle influence they exercised in shaping modern Arab sensibility. Without their seminal minds the course of modern Arabic poetry would in many ways have been different.3\n\nIt is likely that Badawi wrote this with Gibran in mind, for after a falling out of sorts with Rihani during the 1910s, Gibran emerged as the leader of that group and the president of al-Rābiṭ a al-Qalamiyya (the Pen League), which was first founded in 1915 or 1916, reformed in 1920 in New York, and disbanded at his death in 1931 [PL. 27].\n\nGibran’s Arabic writings also drew much of the criticism to which Badawi refers.\n\n3 M. M. Badawi, A Short History of Modern Arabic Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993), 203. For a detailed study of the development of modern Arabic poetry and the role of each one of the Mahjar poets in it, see Salma Khadra Jayyusi, Trends and Movements in Modern Arabic Poetry, vol. 1 (Leiden: Brill, 1997), 85–138.\n\nPL. 27\n\nNasib Arida, Rashid Ayyub, Wadi Bahout, William Catzeflis, Kahlil Gibran, Abd al-Masih Haddad, Nadra Haddad, Elia Abu Madi, Mikhail Naimy, with cover design by Kahlil Gibran, Majmu’at al-Rābi ṭ a al-Qalamiyya (The Gathering of the Pen League), 1921\n\nPL. 28\n\nNa ẓarāt shāʻir wa-mu ṣ awwir fī al-ayyām wa-al-layālī, plate in al-Mawākib (The Procession), 1918\n\nGibran’s last significant Arabic work was the long poem alMawākib (The Procession), written during WWI but not published until 1919 due to paper shortage [PL. 28]. By then he had already transitioned to the second, English phase of his career. His works from this period include The Madman (1918), The Forerunner (1920), The Prophet (1923), Sand and Foam (1926), Jesus, the Son of Man (1928), The Earth Gods (1931) [PL. 29], and the posthumously published The Wanderer (1932) and The Garden of the Prophet (1933). Gibran’s international reputation as an inspirational writer rests on the phenomenal popularity of these works, especially The Prophet. Drawing on the mystique of the East, these works are characterized by Gibran’s use of biblical idiom, aphoristic style, and universalist, didactic tone. The speaking voice is often an intriguing mix of Romantic visionary, pantheist, and nonsectarian mystic.\n\nAn immigrant seeking acceptance, Gibran was encouraged by his early success in Boston’s artistic milieu to embrace the persona projected on him, and he accepted many American ideas about the Orient, particularly the role of Oriental sage or prophet that he came to impersonate. He conformed to it, whereby he also confirmed it for his readers, and what is perhaps most poignantly interesting, he seems to have believed in it—or willed himself to believe it. Gibran was not a two-faced opportunist who knew how to manipulate racist stereotypes, but he was not above self-exoticization or lying about his family and class background to embellish his image to the women in his life, his publishers, and his readers.4 His adoring disciple Barbara Young’s quasi-hagiographic biography, This Man from Lebanon (1945), amplified the legend.\n\nYet as his other, more reliable biographers emphasize, Gibran’s sense of isolation was enormous. Robin Waterfield, who foregrounds the psychology of the immigrant and his desire for success and recognition, argues that Gibran’s life in the United States “evolved organically out of the persona he chose to adopt—that of wounded Romantic, shading into that of poet and prophet—but even an organic development of a persona remains two-dimensional. Whether Gibran was talking to friends or to a public audience, the impression he projected was the same. As an insecure young immigrant, he soon learnt that this role could win him ready acceptance, and even adulation; such positive feedback entrenched the role-playing until it\n\nKahlil Gibran, published by Alfred A. Knopf, The Earth Gods (first edition), 1931 became second nature. But once in a while, his first nature prodded him into awareness.”\n\n5 For example, in 1921, while still working on The Prophet, Gibran declared to his close friend and biographer Mikhail Naimy that he was “a false alarm.”\n\n6 If anything, that realization seems to have led him to embrace more fully the role of Oriental prophet and hermit, both in his works and in his private life, increasingly spent in the isolation of his Greenwich Village studio, which he called his “hermitage.” There he spent the last decade of his life writing and painting, until he died of the effects of alcoholism at the age of forty-eight.\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\nWhile the mystique of the East appealed to avant-garde and countercultural circles disenchanted with modern Western society, its flipside was the derogatory stereotypes rampant both in mainstream culture and in the academic field then known as Orientalism. As Edward Said argued in his influential book Orientalism (1978), nineteenth-century British and French scholarship on the peoples of the Middle East and South Asia reflected the power relations between colonizers and colonized. For Said, Oriental studies were compromised by the role they played in justifying and facilitating European colonialism. Said defined Orientalism as an academic field of study, a style of imperial administration, and “a style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological distinction made between ‘the Orient’ and (most of the time) ‘the Occident.’”\n\n7 The Orient/Occident or East/West duality pits against each other two discursive constructs perceived as totally distinct and fundamentally in opposition, with one (the West) considered superior to the other. The East, Said argued, was not something objectively there in the empirical world—there is no place or culture called the “East”— but a discursive invention that operates, according to the logic of the excluded middle, as Europe’s negative self-reflection, its ideal Other. Said ended his introduction to the book with the hope that the very notions of East and West would be eliminated once and for all—meaning, of course, not that diverse cultures would disappear, but that the ideological fictions of “East” and “West,” along with the dualistic “style of thought,” would be discarded.\n\n5 Robin Waterfield, Prophet: The Life and Times of Kahlil Gibran (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1998), 4–5.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, however, the dualistic logic of Orientalism reigned supreme. Arab American writers, especially those who wrote in English with American readers in mind, were heavily influenced by Orientalism, even as they tried to resist it. To rehabilitate the image of their culture, those writers invoked the idea of Oriental wisdom, the East as the birthplace of prophets and great religious traditions. Some writers, like Ameen Rihani and Abraham Mitrie Rihbany, tried to recast the Orientalist hierarchy between “East” and “West” as a Hegelian dialectic in which each side enjoyed an advantage and suffered a disadvantage: the East is spirituality rich and materially backward, whereas the West is scientifically advanced but spiritually impoverished. This horizontal equivalence sets the stage for the metaphor of the “bridge” between Orient and Occident, which was so appealing to early Arab American writers and to many of their readers even today: the writer with a foot in each world who can reconcile the spirituality of the East and materialism of the West for the sake of a higher form of civilizational synthesis. In doing so, they unwittingly accepted the racialist and colonialist assumption that such things as “East” and “West” exist as coherent, self-contained, and antithetical cultures. Indeed, they tried to retool that dualism to their advantage.\n\nGibran, too, was fascinated by the metaphor of the bridge. In a diary entry dated June 7, 1912, Mary Haskell reported that he made the following comment to her as they “walked across Common and Cambridge St. Bridge” in Boston: “To build a bridge—that is what I want to do: to build one so strong that it may be crossed upon forever.”8 But whereas Rihani and Rihbany wrote explicitly about ways of reconciling or synthesizing “East” and “West,” these notions do not play a role in the universalist outlook of Gibran’s writings. Instead of engaging Orientalist discourse on its own terms, he bypassed dualism and wrote in a universalist mode inspired by Blake’s pantheism, Christian and Islamic mysticism, and the Hinduism of Bengali poet and 1913 Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, whom Gibran met and drew in 1916. That mode does not recognize dichotomies and sees opposites as outward manifestations of the Oneness of being. It is no wonder that Gibran’s best-known book, The Prophet, is formally modeled on Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra, itself featuring an Oriental sage who speaks in aphorisms. In fact, Nietzsche’s entire philosophical project aims at destroying the foundation of the European metaphysical tradition, from Plato and Aristotle to Kant and Hegel, a metaphysics that relies on dichotomies like truth and falsehood, good and evil, beauty and ugliness, body and soul, mind and matter, and by the same “style of thought,” East and West. Nietzsche rejected such dichotomies and initiated (or revived, for he had precursors, including Spinoza) a counter-tradition that continued with Heidegger’s destruction of metaphysics, Sartre’s existentialism, and Derrida’s deconstruction, each of which being a secular method of debunking dualism.\n\nIn that sense, we can say that Arab American writers who accepted the distinction between East and West situated themselves within Orientalist discourse even as they tried to critique it from the inside, a discourse that relies on the European metaphysical tradition based on dichotomies, and one which in the nineteenth century produced colonial ideology and Orientalist discourse. By contrast, the later Gibran placed himself within the Nietzschean countertradition, which rejects dualism, a rejection that approximates mysticism’s emphasis on the Oneness of being. Gibran was no systematic philosopher, of course, and he did not fully subscribe to— or possibly grasp—the secular implications of Nietzsche’s critique of metaphysics. Hence Gibran’s uneasy fusion of anti-foundationalism, pantheism, and mysticism. He found the idea of truth as multiple and personal to be attractive because it offered an alternative ethos to the rigidly hierarchical worldview propagated by Orientalism, racialism, and other ideologies of difference. His search for universal truths that transcend cultural and religious boundaries represents a countercurrent that, however implicitly, challenged the discourse’s hierarchical logic while espousing a nonsectarian kind of spirituality.\n\nLegacy\n\nThis year, 2023, marks the centennial of The Prophet. Although he considered himself to be an artist and a writer in equal measure, Gibran’s drawings and paintings are much less known than his books—hence the importance of this exhibit, which spotlights an overlooked part of his controversial legacy. On the one hand, he is the only Arab American writer to whom national monuments are dedicated (in Boston and Washington, DC) and he remains Knopf’s best-selling author of all time. The Prophet alone has sold more than ten million copies in the United States and been translated into over a hundred languages. It has enjoyed cult-status in countercultural and New Age movements, and its author has had a great impact on pop culture icons, from Elvis Presley to The Beatles, Johnny Cash, and David Bowie, along with one of the world’s best-selling writers today, Brazilian Paulo Coelho, who is himself a kind of latter-day Gibran.9 On the other hand, Gibran’s English-language works have never been taken seriously by scholars and academic critics, some of whom regard him as a “charlatan” who exploited Oriental stereotypes.10 His works have also been described as “fast food” poetry,11 and as a “welcome escape route” for “late romantics and seekers after the exotic.”12 Whatever the case may be, there is no doubt that Gibran represents a compelling and complicated cultural phenomenon that could have emerged only in America.13\n\n9 Coelho is an avid reader of Gibran’s works and the translator of his letters to Mary Haskell under the title Cartas de amor do profeta (Rio de Janeiro: Ediouro Publicações, 1997).\n\n10 See, for example, Evelyne Shakir’s “Arab-American Literature,” in New Immigrant Literatures in the United States, ed.
