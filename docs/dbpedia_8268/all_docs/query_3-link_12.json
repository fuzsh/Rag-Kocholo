        "text": "This paper is a part of an ongoing research that is being done on the history of Arab-American literature .The study, therefore spots light on the important efforts of Arab-American women writers in sharing their brothers‟ men to create new literary works in host-country. Arab-American woman writers have become prominent figures in the field of Arab-American literature and greatly indebted to Arab American feminism, which has empowered them and enabled the voicing of their concerns through literature.\n\nArab Americans living in the United States are represented in the intriguing and varied body of Arab American Literature. It is a diverse and significant body of writing that reflects the experiences and perspectives of Arab Americans in the United States. It explores powerful examples of how difficult it is to deal with identity, heritage, and belonging concerns in a diverse community. Arab American writers, from Ameen Rihani to Naomi Shihab Nye, have made creative contributions with their viewpoints, illuminating the rich tapestry of life in Arab America in everything from provocative novels to tender poetry and perceptive essays. However, Arab American authors have faced numerous challenges, including prejudice, stereotypes, language barriers, and limited publishing opportunities. Despite these obstacles, they have persisted in using their literary works as a means of self-expression, cultural preservation, and empowerment. To promote the visibility and acknowledgment of Arab Ame...\n\nThis paper attempts to trace the development of Arab-American literary tradition through three distinct generations-each of which responds quite differently to the identity politics, cultural hybridity, subversion of orientalist gaze, and the crisis of belonging amidst the inevitable multifacetedness of the Arab-American community. The literary works of the contemporary Arab-American writers are engaged with the idea of the American landscape as a long-term rather than a provisional home. In other words, this new generation of writers manages to hover over the divide between the two cultures and view the Arab world from the American soil. The paper finally approaches the Post-9/11 Arab-American novel in terms of receptiveness, characteristics, challenges, and future outlook. I argue that for the contemporary Arab-American novel to flourish, the integration of Arab experience into the American fabric, in the sense that themes and subject matters related to both sides of the hyphen, should be acknowledged as a cultural necessity. Ironically, this is the best way for Arab-American novelists to bring their distinct voices to the multi-vocal mainstream culture, to carve a niche for themselves. The useful analogy is the literary cultural expressions and experiences of the Asian, African or Canadian communities on the American soil; they are distinct, but not different from the cultural traditions of other diaspora communities.\n\nAs the first female Algerian author to have her works translated from Arabic to English, Ahlem Mosteghanemi writes novels amidst a current of linguistic and cultural transgression. The Syrian poet Hala Mohammad‟s work in the Poets of Protest series (2012) and her writings on social media shall be examined comparatively, considering Mosteghanemi‟s novel Memory in the Flesh (1993). This paper shall examine both female writers‟ roles as literary transgressors in and outside of Arabia and the academe. With artistic boundaries being tested so prolifically in the post-Arab-Spring era, a recent „freeing up‟ of artistic space by both writers has provoked a literary evolution in female Arab writing. Beginning with an account of how the Algerian and Syrian Springs (both recent and past) have influenced each writer, a historical and structural account will be given to show how each writer complicates strictly structuralist or historiographical literary paradigms. Amidst political upheaval and cultural violence and displacement, each writer is seen to shape and develop their roles as writers. A relationship will then be made between how these writers address taboo subjects in otherwise orthodox states and varyingly find themselves subject to a polarised response: suppression or sustained popularity. Finally, it will be argued that a reevaluation of the role of the author or poet is incited by this transgression. Keywords:"
