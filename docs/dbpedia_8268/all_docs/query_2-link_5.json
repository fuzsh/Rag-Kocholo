        "text": "Isabella Kapur\n\n1883\n\nKahlil Gibran is born Jubrān Khalīl Jubrān to Kamila Rahme and Khalil Saad Jubrān in the town of Bsharri, in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Ottoman Empire, in present-day Lebanon. (In 1860, the massacre of Lebanese Christians led to the separation of Mount Lebanon into an autonomous Christian region under Ottoman and European protection.) While his exact birth date is unknown, Gibran himself favored January 6.\n\nGibran’s parents developed a poor reputation in the relatively small town of Bsharri. Kamila Rahme was the daughter of a Maronite cleric who was excommunicated from the church for officiating the wedding of two people from politically opposed factions, and she had a son, Butrus, from a previous marriage. Khalil Saad Jubrān, described as imposing and arrogant, worked as a walnut farmer and tax collector but occupied much of his time drinking and gambling.\n\n1891, age 8\n\nUnable to afford their home, Gibran’s family (including his two younger sisters, Mariana and Sultana) is forced to move to an unhygienic basement apartment in Bsharri, acquired by Khalil Saad Jubrān in exchange for loyalty to Bsharri political leader Raji Beyk. When Beyk is accused of corruption in 1891, Jubrān is caught up in the scandal and arrested for embezzlement. He is found guilty and the family’s property is confiscated.\n\nGibran’s interest in drawing develops.\n\n1895, age 12\n\nAfter Gibran’s maternal grandfather dies in 1894, the family’s social, economic, and emotional difficulties are compounded. Gibran’s mother moves herself and her children to the slums of South End Boston, leaving Gibran’s father behind in Bsharri. Kamila works as a peddler, a common occupation for Syrian/Lebanese immigrants in Boston at the time.\n\nGibran attends Quincy School, the nearby public school which includes students from the Irish, American, Jewish, Syrian, Eastern European, and Chinese communities in the South End of Boston. In the process of immigrating, Gibran’s name had been interpreted and misinterpreted several times. In school, at the insistence of one of the administrators, his name is Westernized in the manner that would become most common—“Khalil” becomes “Kahlil” and “Jubrān Khalīl Jubrān” is condensed to “Kahlil Gibran.”\n\nGibran takes drawing classes at Denison House, a settlement house across the street from the Quincy School run by social workers—mostly college-educated upper- and middle-class women.\n\n1896, age 13\n\nDenison House social worker Florence Pierce and philanthropist Jessi Fremont Beale identify Gibran’s talent in drawing and introduce him to Fred Holland Day, a wealthy photographer, philanthropist, and publisher who becomes Gibran’s first patron. Day photographs Gibran—surrounding him, as he did his other subjects plucked from the South End, with an ambiguous selection of clothing and objects to create an Orientalist vision of Near Eastern nobility— and introduces him to the Boston art and publishing worlds. The photographer encourages Gibran’s drawing practice.\n\n1897, age 14\n\nGibran discovers the Belgian writer Maurice Maeterlinck, whose work deeply influences him. Through Day and his circle, Gibran also learns of artists like Aubrey Beardsley, Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris, Maxfield Parrish, William Blake, the Pre-Raphaelites, and other Romantics and Symbolists.\n\n1898, age 15\n\nGibran first gains the design and typography skills that he will employ in subsequent decades. He contributes designs to books from Day’s publishing company, Copeland and Day; Dodd, Mead and Company; and L.C. Page and Company. Gibran meets the then twenty-three-year-old Cambridge poet Josephine Prescott Peabody, befriending her by drawing her portrait from memory.\n\nGibran’s mother sends him back to Lebanon, nervous about the influence that his new art world connections are having on him. He attends Madrasat al-Hikma (College La Sagesse), a Nationalist Maronite high school in Beirut open to students of all faiths. There, he pursues literature in both Arabic and French. With his friend Youssef Howayek, he creates a literary journal called al-Manāra (The Beacon). At Madrasat al-Hikma, Gibran also encounters the Ottoman resistance.\n\n1901, age 18\n\nGibran leaves Beirut to travel in Europe, spending time in Paris. Gibran continues to design book covers, including those of Wisdom and Destiny and other publications by Maurice Maeterlinck, published by Dodd, Meade and Company.\n\n1902, age 19\n\nGibran learns that his sister Sultana has died of glandular tuberculosis. He returns to Boston to find that his mother has been diagnosed with cancer, and his brother, Butrus, is also suffering from tuberculosis.\n\nGibran resumes correspondence with Josephine Prescott Peabody. The two attend art events together and Peabody encourages Gibran in his writing and art. Around this time, Gibran also meets the well-loved Boston Rabbi Charles Fleischer, who becomes a friend and who will host a funerary tribute to the artist following his death decades later.\n\n1903, age 20\n\nGibran’s brother Butrus succumbs to tuberculosis in March. In June, Gibran’s mother Kamila dies. Gibran and his surviving sister, Mariana, run the family shop until they clear the debts the business has accrued. Mariana supports them as a seamstress. Gibran’s health also deteriorates, as does his anxiety about illness. In May, Gibran’s artwork is shown publicly for the first time in an exhibition at Wellesley College, an opportunity facilitated by Peabody.\n\nGibran distinctly shifts towards writing. His earliest published writing, which he shares in the years that immediately follow, is in Arabic.\n\n1904, age 21\n\nFred Holland Day hosts the first solo exhibition of Gibran’s work. On the final day of the exhibition, Gibran meets Mary Haskell, the head of a Boston girl’s school who will become a lifelong supporter, patron, sounding board, and editor for Gibran, as well as, at one point, a prospective spouse. Through Mary Haskell, Gibran meets writer Charlotte Teller, who introduces him to labor and women’s rights activists and literary figures including Samuel Clemens (aka Mark Twain), who Gibran would draw.\n\nIn November, Day’s studio burns. Among the considerable collection destroyed in the fire are most of Gibran’s works done up to this point.\n\nGibran develops a relationship with the New York-based Arabic newspaper and publisher al-Muhājir (The Immigrant). The paper’s editor, Ameen Guraieb, hires Gibran to write a weekly column. Gibran develops a uniquely colloquial and non-traditional style, pulling on the informal language of both rural Lebanon and Boston’s South End as well as Syriac from his Maronite background.\n\n1905, age 22\n\nGibran’s first published writing, al-Musiqa (On Music), appears in Arabic in al-Muhājir.\n\n1906, age 23\n\nIn January, a string of riots involving Syrian American Orthodox and Maronite leaders in New York results in the murder of an innocent bystander, spurring the community to speak out. Gibran contributes a drawing to the front page of an al-Muhājir issue that contains an article by fellow Maronite Lebanese American writer Ameen Rihani. The first edition of ‘Arā’is al-Murūj (Spirit Brides), later translated as Nymphs of the Valley, is published in Arabic by al-Muhājir. The compilation of three stories by Gibran demonstrates his colloquial writing style and innovative emphasis on lower class protagonists. Josephine Prescott Peabody gets married, ending their friendship. Gibran begins an affair with a pianist, Gertrude Barrie, and later falls in love with aspiring French actress Émilie Michel (aka Micheline) following an introduction through Mary Haskell.\n\n1908, age 25\n\nAl-Arwāḥ al-Mutamirrida (Spirits Rebellious) is published in Arabic by al-Muhājir. The book is critical of the rigidity of laws and traditions,\n\nPortrait of Samuel Clemens, 1907 and it sparks controversy, leading the Syrian government to ban the book. The Maronite Church considers excommunicating Gibran.\n\nOn July 1, with financial support from Mary Haskell, Gibran enrolls at Academy Julian in Paris to focus on his technical drawing and painting skills. While in Paris, Gibran encounters the art of William Blake, Auguste Rodin, and Eugene Carriére and the writing of Nietzsche, all of which have a profound impact on his creative output.\n\nThat same July, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) in Istanbul, also known as the Young Turks, sparks a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire’s authoritarian rule under Abdülhamid II leading to the reestablishment of both parliament and the 1876 constitution. Known as the Young Turk Revolution, the event leads, four years later, to CUP commanding full leadership of the Ottoman Empire, and contributes to the empire’s eventual dissolution. A good deal of this revolution is planned in Paris, a city with a significant Arab immigrant community. Freshly moved to Paris during this exciting time, Gibran absorbs new political ideas.\n\nBack in Gibran’s home region, the autonomous Mount Lebanon, the emphasis by the new Ottoman government on increased centralization sparks objections. Maronite leaders in Mount Lebanon refuse to send representatives to the new parliament located in Istanbul, in direct defiance of the push towards centralized control within the Ottoman Empire. The Maronite leaders refuse to hold elections for the appointment of representatives and eventually succeed in pushing back at the new Young Turk government’s demands. This emphasis on regionalism will inform Gibran’s own relationship with Syrian nationalism.\n\n1909, age 26\n\nGibran leaves Academy Julian first to study with artist Pierre MarcelBéronneau, himself a student of Gustave Moreau, and then to work on his own. Continuing to explore the Paris art world, Gibran meets and has the opportunity to draw artist Auguste Rodin, American sculptor Paul Bartlett, and French composer Claude Debussy, among others. These drawings form part of Gibran’s Temple of Art series, a collection of portraits of artists, political thinkers, poets, and writers with whom Gibran associated over the course of many years. While in Paris, Gibran learns that his father has died. He becomes involved with the New York-based journal Mir’āt al-Gharb (Mirror of the West), which has more revolutionary leanings than al-Muhājir.\n\n1910, age 27\n\nStill in Paris in June, Gibran meets Ameen Rihani. The two travel to London together alongside Youssef Howayek. Rihani becomes a significant influence on Gibran, informing his views on Arab Nationalism. Rihani is immediately skeptical of CUP and the capacity of a constitution to right decades of injustice without accompanying cultural and intellectual reform. Back in Paris, Gibran is invited to contribute six paintings to an exhibition at the Union Internationale des Beaux-Arts et des Lettres, but having run out of money, he chooses to return to New York in October.\n\nGibran’s poem “To Syrians” is published in Mir’āt al-Gharb in November and marks an overtly political turn in Gibran’s work. The work chastises the Syrian people for complacently accepting Ottoman rule and insists that if they cannot stand up for Syria, they should abandon it.\n\nMary Haskell begins to record her conversations with Gibran in detail, eventually resulting in a thorough record of his life and work spanning the next few decades. In December Gibran proposes marriage to Haskell, who initially declines, before agreeing the next day. The pair end their engagement four months later but remain creative collaborators.\n\n1911, age 28\n\nThe Book of Khalid, written by Ameen Rihani and featuring illustrations by Gibran, is published by Dodd, Mead and Company. A transcription of Gibran’s speech made for the Golden Links Society, a Syrian diasporic literary and educational society, is published in Mir’āt al-Gharb. The speech makes a case for either outwardly revolutionary or inwardly transformational behavior, condemning Syrian reliance on Ottoman and European powers.\n\nAs she had with his move to Paris, Haskell finances Gibran’s move to New York in April, providing him with $5000. Settling into 51 West Tenth Street in Greenwich Village, Gibran establishes the studio in which he will reside for many years, calling it his “hermitage.” In addition to seeing Ameen Rihani regularly, he meets Carl Jung, William Butler Yeats, and more members of the Arabic literary community.\n\n1912, age 29\n\nAl-Ajniḥ a al-Mutakassira (The Broken Wings) is published in Arabic by al-Muhājir. Cairo based Lebanese Palestinian writer May Ziadeh reads the novella and contacts Gibran, spurring a lasting\n\nPL. 98\n\nPortrait of Ameen Rihani, 1911 correspondence ranging from literary and political discussion to love letters.\n\nIn spring of 1912 Gibran meets and draws a portrait of Abdu’lBahá, the leader of the Bahá’i faith and the inspiration for The Prophet ’s protagonist al-Mustafa. The meeting informs Gibran’s pantheistic beliefs, but he is strongly opposed to the pacifism upheld by the members of the Bahá’i faith with whom he interacts. Observing the shifting political situation in the Ottoman Empire, Gibran develops a strong belief that only revolution—war—can result in a greater Syrian state free from Ottoman control.\n\nLending credence to Gibran’s calls for revolution, following the loss of Libya and the Balkans, the Ottoman Empire establishes stricter centralized control over its remaining territories to stave off impending collapse. Communities throughout the empire push back, demanding decentralization. Gibran and his contemporaries begin to strategize for the eventual demise of the empire. Three main factions surface: Arab nationalism, advocating for a pan-Arab state; Syrian nationalism, advocating for a state of Greater Syria; and Lebanese nationalism, advocating for a further division of territories that would result in Lebanon as its own nation. Gibran considers all three, but the greater part of his political writing and action is in favor of Syrian nationalism.\n\nEven as politics come to the forefront, Gibran begins to write The Prophet. He also moves away from painting to place a greater emphasis on drawing.\n\n1913,\n\nAge 30\n\nEarly in the year, the First Arab Congress is held in Paris, a gathering of over thirty Syrians from organizations in Paris, the United States, Cairo, Beirut, Mount Lebanon, and South America to discuss home rule for Syria. Gibran does not attend because his anti-pacifist position causes an ideological rift between him and his contemporaries at the conference.\n\nThe Arab American literary journal al-Funūn (The Arts) begins publication under the direction of Nasib Arida. The journal runs until 1918, publishing a total of 29 issues, 25 of which include writings and/or drawings by Gibran. Among his contributions is a series celebrating Arab and Islamic thinkers, leaders, and artists throughout history, demonstrating Gibran’s interest in a unifying cultural history. In November, Gibran contributes Ilā al-Muslīmīn min Shāʿir Masī ḥ ī (To Muslims from a Christian Poet), a text sometimes dubbed “An Open Letter to Islam,” encouraging unity between religions in opposition to the Ottoman Empire. Gibran meets Arthur Davies, president of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors and adds several portraits to the Temple of Art series, drawing psychologist Carl Jung, French actress Sarah Bernhardt, dancer and playwright Ruth St. Denis, and Italian revolutionary Guiseppe Garibaldi II.\n\n1914, age 31\n\nIn August, the First World War begins, and in November, the Ottoman Empire is drawn into the struggle, joining the Central Powers. Over the next two years, Gibran publishes political tracts anonymously—a precaution taken by many of his peers fearing Ottoman retaliation. Meanwhile, Gibran’s book Dam‘a wa Ibtisāma ( A Tear and a Smile) is published in Arabic by Atlantic. Hoping that Syrians of all religions will join with the Allies to oust the Ottoman Empire, he donates the proceeds from the book to the developing war effort.\n\nA solo exhibition of Gibran’s work opens at Montross Gallery in December. Gibran shows forty-four paintings and drawings, including portraits of people he encountered in both Paris and New York.\n\n1915, age 32\n\nGibran continues to expand his artistic circle, drawing several portraits of American painter Albert Pinkham Ryder through whom he meets Corrine Roosevelt Robinson, another wealthy patron of the arts and sister to Theodore. Between late 1915 and early 1916, Nasib Arida and Abd al-Masih Haddad found al-Rābiṭ a al-Qalamiyya (the Pen League), a Syrian-Lebanese-American literary collective that Gibran joins alongside Rihani and Lebanese American poets Mikhail Naimy and Elia Abu Madi.\n\nMeanwhile, in Syria, Governor Jamal Pasha begins a bloody consolidation of power, placing his allies, loyal to the Ottoman CUP government, in political office and spying on, torturing, and eventually hanging those advocating for national autonomy.\n\n1916, age 33\n\nIn retaliation against Ottoman military control of the region, France blockades the coast of Syria, leading to food shortages, famine, military commandeering of civilian homes and transportation, increased censorship by the military, and a shutdown of contact with the rest of the world. This is swiftly followed by a locust infestation and a typhus outbreak. These factors combined result in the deaths of between 380,000 and 650,000 people in Beirut, Mount Lebanon, and the remainder of Syria combined. Gibran joins the Syrian Aid Society, which is absorbed by the Syrian-Mount Lebanon Relief Committee, for which he serves as secretary. Gibran contributes a poem and drawings to the “Syria in Distress” issue of al-Funūn in October.\n\nGibran draws Nobel Prize winning Bengali poet and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore during Tagore’s anti-nationalist lecture tour. During this time Gibran also meets James Oppenheim, publisher of the magazine The Seven Arts, to which the artist contributes alongside such luminaries as Robert Frost and D. H. Lawrence. Even as his new acquaintances oppose the war, Gibran continues to support it, seeing violent upheaval as Greater Syria’s only way out of Ottoman control. In December, France establishes a new Near Eastern liberation force, Légion d’Orient, comprising Syrian, Armenian, and Arab volunteers, and Gibran actively recruits for the group.\n\n1917, age 34\n\nIn February, Gibran shows his work at the art dealership M. Knoedler & Co. An article about the exhibition, written by Jungian psychologist Alice Raphael, appears in The Seven Arts in March. On April 6, the United States enters WWI. The following month, the Syria Mount Lebanon League of Liberation is established by Gibran and other figures in the North American Syrian community with the goal of encouraging volunteers to fight for Syria. Among the tactics employed by the League of Liberation was the publication of several articles in the New York-based journal al-Sā’iḥ, which was founded by Abd al-Massih Haddad. Even while attempting to help those in Syria and Lebanon, the diasporic community remained divided along regional and religious lines.\n\n1918, age 35\n\nPoet Witter Bynner introduces Gibran to Alfred A. Knopf, who will become his primary English language publisher. Knopf publishes Gibran’s first book written in English, The Madman: His Parables and Poems. The book includes Gibran’s illustrations alongside his writing. In September, British and Australian troops push Turkish troops out of Syria, and on November 11, the war ends on the western front. In honor of the event, Gibran contributes the cover illustration to a special Armistice Day issue of al-Sā’iḥ. Following the end of the\n\nPL. 104\n\nPortrait of Witter Bynner, 1913\n\nFirst World War, France begins to establish control over Greater Syria, and Lebanon gains greater autonomy as the Ottoman Empire dissolves. France and Great Britain, despite prior agreements, begin to argue over how to split up the former Ottoman territories between themselves. In this developing political setting, Gibran encourages the Arab world to avoid imitating the state structures of the West. Even as he expresses his admiration for and connection to a pan-Arab history that includes Syria and Lebanon, he emphasizes that creating one large nation would come at the expense of the spiritual and cultural life of the many regions newly emerging from centuries of Ottoman rule.\n\n1919, age 36\n\nIn January, the Paris Peace Conference begins at Versailles, initiating negotiations over reparations and the distribution of land and power following the war. Greater Syria is separated into Syria and Lebanon. Unhappy with the talks, Gibran writes “War and the Small Nations,” a parable that expresses his frustration with the squabbling of the larger nations, especially France and Great Britain, as well as with their power to determine the fates of smaller nations. Gibran also authors his first play, Bayn al-Layl wa al-Sabah (Between Night and Morn). Published in al-Sā’iḥ, though never performed, the play features five men representative of the different religious factions in Greater Syria and a poet who stands in for Gibran himself as they spend the night in a prison cell debating the future of Syria on the eve of its liberation from Ottoman control. While Gibran is preoccupied by political concerns, Twenty Drawings, which includes Alice Raphael’s essay, is published by Knopf. Gibran designs a special version of the Knopf borzoi colophon for the publication. His poem al-Mawākib (The Procession) is published by Mir’āt al-Gharb. Amid criticism of this and other poems as well as the frustrations of postwar politics, Gibran shifts away from his Arabic-speaking audience and towards a Western, Englishspeaking public.\n\n1920, age 37\n\nIn March, on the heels of rulings made during the Paris Peace Conference, Faisal I of Iraq is installed as the King of Greater Syria by the Syrian National Congress. Faisal and his family members rule a large portion of the former Ottoman territories, prompting Gibran to fear the creation of a new imperial empire in the region, this time pan-Arab in origin. Instead, in April at the San Remo\n\nPL. 106\n\nTwo Faces (Portrait of Elinor Wylie), 1923 conference, the imperial powers finalize the division of Ottoman Territories. France is given control of Greater Syria and violently removes the Arab government under Faisal. Lebanese Nationalists push the new French controlled government for autonomy, and on September 1, Greater Lebanon is established as its own state. That autumn, Gibran writes his self-proclaimed farewell to politics, the poem “You Have Your Lebanon and I Have Mine,” printed in al-Hilāl in Egypt and al-Sā’iḥ in New York.\n\nGibran devotes more time to his literary writing and art. The first edition of The Forerunner: His Parables and Poems is published in English by Knopf and al-ʻAwā ṣif (The Tempests), a collection of stories and poems from 1912 to 1918, is published in Arabic. Gibran revives al-Rābiṭ a al-Qalamiyya (the Pen League), serving as president alongside Mikhail Naimy, who serves as secretary, and writer William Catzeflis, who serves as treasurer. Al-Rābiṭ a al-Qalamiyya helps to fill the space left when al-Funūn ends its run in 1919, providing a gathering place for those hoping to rejuvenate Arabic literature. Gibran designs the Pen League’s logo, featuring an open book accompanied by a quote about poetry from the Prophet Muhammad. Gibran continues to write primarily in English and devotes much of his time to working on The Prophet.\n\n1921, age 38\n\nGibran contributes to the Egyptian journal al-Hilāl an article entitled “al-ʻAhd al-Jadīd” (The New Era), which reflects on two consciousnesses in Near Eastern thought according to Gibran: that of the creative and that of the political. Gibran, already in poor health and drifting away from the social connections that defined his youth, begins to reflect on death.\n\n1923, age 40\n\nMary Haskell moves to Savannah, Georgia, to serve as the companion of Jacob Florance Minis, the widow of her cousin Louise Gilmer Minis. She continues to edit The Prophet and correspond with Gibran, though they drift apart slightly under the strain of distance and shifting responsibilities. After years of work by both of them, the first edition of Gibran’s most well-known work is published in English by Knopf. Like his other recent books, The Prophet includes Gibran’s own illustrations alongside his writing. The first edition is carefully designed, down to the type of paper used, by Gibran and Knopf. Al-Badā wa-al-Ṭarāʼif (The New and The Marvelous), a collection of thirty-five pieces of writing by Gibran, is published in Cairo. During this time, Gibran essentially gives up painting to work in drawing and watercolor. Portrait commissions begin to bring in extra income.\n\n1924, age 41\n\nImmigrants to the United States from Eastern Europe, the Near East, and Asia are almost completely prevented from entering the country by the Immigration Act of 1924. This includes Syrian and Lebanese immigrants and demonstrates the pervasive xenophobia Gibran and fellow members of the Syrian diaspora faced in the United States during the early twentieth century. In the early 1920s, Gibran meets the US-based Indian writer and lecturer Syud Hossain, an outspoken opponent of immigration restrictions and colonial rule. In 1924, Hossain invites Gibran to be a board member for his new, internationally-minded organization, the Orient Society. From 1924 to 1928, Gibran and his fellow society members publish The New Orient, “a journal of international friendship” that features contributions from H. G. Wells, Witter Bynner, Mahatma Gandhi, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Yone Noguchi, Bertrand Russell, Sarojini Naidu, and Gibran’s future secretary, poet Barbara Young, among others.\n\nAfter a failed real estate venture and in increasingly poor health, Gibran retreats to his New York studio. He proceeds to work on Jesus the Son of Man with an advance from Knopf. In the midst of Prohibition, Gibran self-medicates with alcohol, particularly the Lebanese beverage arak. Over the next few years, this compounds his existing health conditions.\n\n1925, age 42\n\nMary Haskell decides to marry Florance Minis and ends her thorough journaling of her conversations with Gibran, though she remains his editor. Several acquaintances in New York emerge as new colleagues for Gibran, including Frederick Crofts, who purchases the textbook division from Knopf, and his lively wife Margaret Lee Crofts. Poet Henrietta Boughton, who will eventually go by her pen name, Barbara Young, becomes Gibran’s secretary and remains so until his death. Antiochian Orthodox Priest Antony Bashir, a fellow Lebanese immigrant, begins to translate Gibran’s English language works for Arabic-speaking audiences.\n\n1926, age 43\n\nSand and Foam: A Book of Aphorisms is published by Knopf. From 1926 to 1927, Gibran also works on two English language plays, Lazarus and His Beloved and The Blind.\n\n1927, age 44\n\nKalimāt Jubrān (Sayings of Jubran) is published in Cairo. Gibran abandons drawing notable figures and instead focuses on rendering his friends and those close to him. At the end of the year, Gibran passes Jesus the Son of Man to Mary Haskell for editing.\n\n1928, age 45\n\nGibran contributes drawings to Aghānī al-Darwīsh (Songs of the Dervish) by Rashid Ayyub. The first edition of Jesus the Son of Man: His Words and His Deeds as Told and Recorded by Those Who Knew Him is published in English by Knopf and is positively received by critics and the public. In 1928, New York Socialite Eva Palmer, alongside journalist Alma Reed, founds the Delphic Society, also known as the Ashram, at 12 Fifth Avenue. Gibran joins the society alongside contemporaries including painter José Clemente Orozco, lecturer Syud Hossain, poet Angelos Sikelianos, and architect Claude Bragdon. Those associated with the society and its gallery branch, Delphic Studios, are united by an interest in universal humanity and pantheism, inspired by lessons drawn from ancient Greece. Gibran’s health further deteriorates.\n\n1929, age 46\n\nAl-Sanābil (The Spikes of Grain) is published in Arabic by al-Sā’iḥ. Gibran suffers from chronic pain and continues to self-medicate by drinking heavily. He develops cirrhosis of the liver but continues to work and does not seek treatment, though he is aware he is dying. Fatigued, his work on The Garden of the Prophet slows.\n\n1930, age 47\n\nGibran drafts the final iteration of his will, dividing the majority of his belongings and assets between his sister Mariana, Mary Haskell, and his hometown of Bsharri.\n\n1931, age 48\n\nThe first edition of The Earth Gods is published in English by Knopf. On April 10, 1931, Kahlil Gibran dies in New York and, per his wishes, is buried in Lebanon. Mary Haskell and her sister purchase Mar\n\nSarkis Monastery to serve as Gibran’s burial site. Gibran leaves his money and estate to his sister Mariana, his papers and the contents of his studio to Mary Haskell, and the future royalties from his books to his birthplace, Bsharri. Haskell sends much of his work back to Lebanon, including 73 paintings, 366 drawings, material from his studio, and much of the contents of his library.\n\n1932\n\nThe Wanderer: His Parables and His Sayings is published posthumously in English by Knopf.\n\n1933\n\nThe first edition of The Garden of the Prophet is published posthumously in English by Knopf.\n\nSources Referenced\n\n“About Gibran: Biography.” Gibran National Committee, 2014. http://www. gibrankhalilgibran.org/AboutGebran/ Biography/.\n\nBushrui, Suheil B., and Joe Jenkins.
