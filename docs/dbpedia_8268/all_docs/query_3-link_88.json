        "text": "1Migrant produced press was a crucial locus for debate in the Mexican Mahjar, tying those locally settled or in transit into broader audiences spanning Mahjars and Mashriq. The production of a range of periodicals first in Arabic and later in bilingual and Spanish language formats is indicative of the diversity of resources migrants mobilized. The early presence of a migrant intelligentsia literate in several scripts and languages is symptomatic not only of socioeconomic and educational diversity, but also of the processes encouraging intense migration out of the Mashriq in the final decades of the nineteenth century. These included the emergence of an educated middle class with transatlantic connections and imaginaries through the multiplication of French and American missionary and Ottoman educational institutions, the economic and political reforms of Ottoman modernity, and the progressive closure of the public sphere with the failure of constitutionalism and Abdelhamid’s return to absolutism after 1878. Mexican Mahjar periodical production changed profoundly with the transition from Ottoman administration (1878-1914), when periodicals were ephemeral, funded by migrant notables as outlets for particular political projects, to the French Mandate moment (1920-1946).\n\n2Transnationalism as methodological and theoretical strategy affords recognition of the fact that migrants’ imaginaries and decisions do not necessarily conform to nation-state’s expectations of a single one-directional transit. Mobile Mashriqis across the American Mahjars often remained intensely mobile, and over a third eventually returned to settle in the Mashriq. Focusing mobility through a transnational lens allows scholars to think beyond the metaphor of diaspora, affording alternatives to the national histories of migrant reception that dominated the ethnography and historiography of migratory processes for decades. My work centers mobile subjects, their multiple experiences of mobility and the choices open to them as they wove trajectories across various jurisdictions and administrative frameworks. Rather than imagine migrant efforts as moves on the checkered horizons of identity politics or attempts at achieving what particular normative national projects demanded as assimilation, I trace their divergent investments and identifications as they crafted networks and defined the terms of their participation in colonial and postcolonial formations not of their own making.\n\n3As analytic perspectives, transnationalism and transregionalism also allow us to explore the plurality, fragmentation and hierarchization of the public sphere (Fraser, 1990) generated by mobile subjects. The migrant press was an outgrowth of the literary and journalistic movements developing in the Mashriq during the second half of the 19th century, the Nahda or Arab Renaissance (Dakhli, 2009; Pastor, 2017). Some of the most prominent journalists active in Mexico had a Mashriqi formal education, for example José Helu, who arrived with his wife in 1898. Others, like José Musalem, studied locally, in his case in Oaxaca. The Mahjar press however developed a transnational public sphere, with the active participation of migrant journalists, both professional and amateur, from across the American Mahjars. Periodical publications often reproduced articles that had appeared in other magazines or journals. Among those favored for reproduction in Mexico were articles originally published in New York City’s Al-Hoda [The Guidance, published 1898-1972], which was widely read across the Americas. Journalists circulated across Mahjars along with their products, as a 1937 note titled “Social events of the month in the colony” published in El Emir, printed monthly from 1937-1968 in Mexico City by its head editor Alfonso Negib Aued, portrays:\n\n1 El Emir, no. 1, México DF, June 1937, p. 24.\n\nThe Lebanese Social Club, established by a group of lively young ladies of our colony, on this past April 17th offered, in the elegant venue of the restaurant Swastica, a ball in honor of M. Saloum Mokarzel, distinguished journalist, director of the daily ‘al Hoda’ edited in New York.\n\n4The Mexican Mahjar press articulated global issues, Mashriq debates and questions emerging in transnational Mahjar perspective as well as the immediate context in which it developed: that of the evolution of the press in Mexico towards the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century.\n\n5After providing a brief overview of the development of the migrant press in the first three decades of the 20th century, this paper will address two crucial debates in the Mexican Mahjar press of the 1930’s and 40’s. The first was punctual and fraught. It took the form of a chronicle of diasporic mobilization around the Great Arab Revolt in British Palestine (1936-1938). Following key figures touring the Hispanophone American Mahjars rallying support for the rebels, the chronicles make up a peculiar narrative, a cry in the desert so to speak. I argue that the political and social crisis that the 1936-1939 Palestinian Revolt articulated in the Mashriq triggered a storm of press coverage in the Mexican Mahjar which effected a qualitative transformation of representation. Palestine was radically transformed. Initially described as a geography for recreation characterized by natural beauty and Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Land, it became the axis of a heated debate around ‘the Palestine question’ and its moral geography. In this process, ways of representing Jewish populations also changed. They ceased to be understood through the Ottoman history of coexistence of multiple religious traditions in the Mashriq, resignified as a homogeneous people, vector of the imperialist project of European Zionism. Coverage of the Revolt elicited no echo from the mainstream Mexican press or interlocution from the Maronite Phoenicianist migrant notability. Though El Emir’s editor in chief, Alfonso Aued, presented an impassioned plea for increasingly besieged Palestinians, he failed to engage the Mexican Mahjar with such ‘Arab futures’ except perhaps in the modality of spectacle.\n\n6In the economically difficult and politically impoverished climate in the wake of the Great Depression, the second key debate was a decade-long conversation across the migrant community and Mexican ideologues of mestizaje, as the foundational whitening racial project (Moreno Figueroa, 2020) of the postrevolutionary state, about the desirability, or not, of Mashriqis as permanent residents of Mexico and the limits to their integration into the mestizo nation. The debate, most intensely visible in El Emir, invoked and even cited pamphlets and press articles produced in the Spanish language Mexican mainstream press. For Mahjaris, the debate hinged on their appropriation of ancient Phoenician colonization of the Mediterranean, defining the Nahda as a Maronite civilizing mission which afforded situating Arab migrants in Mexico as partners to local Spanish descent (criollo) elites in a common civilizing effort over mestizos and Amerindian populations.\n\nFrom Enlightenment and popular presses to the industrial press\n\n7Though periodical publications developed in the New Spain since the mid sixteenth century, diversifying with the eighteenth-century circulation of Enlightenment debates, they only emerged as a widely popular form in the second half of the 19th century. A multitude of actors turned to the press as a site affording the cultivation of communities, a forum for public debate incorporating local issues as well as international news. The use of the press as a space for debate came to index modernity, demonstrating a population’s competence in engaging public space – bourgeois space by definition. Press production in Mexico after independence in 1821 was subject to the power struggles between conservative and liberal elites that infused 19th century politics in Latin America. The Lares Law, for example, decreed in 1853, inscribed the most restrictive conditions. It was supported by conservatives, who were often monarchists and refused the concept of an autonomous citizenry with the freedom to openly criticize those in power. It was also championed by the Church, whose functionaries saw in such freedom the loosening of their surveillance over Catholic consciences and the spread of the dangerous ideas of the French Revolution to former Spanish colonies. For these very reasons, freedom of expression and of the press were banners of the liberal cause, which deliberately sought to exceed the limits to discourse approved by the Crown and Church. When liberals regained control of national politics in Mexico in 1861, they restored the 1857 Constitution which stipulated freedom of expression, and established the Organic Law of Freedom of the Press or Press Law. Also known as the Zarco Law, it instituted trial by jury for press crimes, eliminating preventive censure, confiscation of production and the easy jailing of journalists (Toussaint, 2006).\n\n8The Zarco Law was modified in 1882 by Porfirio Diaz, the president in power from 1875-1910, affording the state an iron hand over periodical production (Toussaint, 2006). In 1888, Rafael Reyes Espíndola founded the daily El Universal, which became the official publication of the Porfirian administration. Numerous periodical publications established by foreigners residing in Mexico played a crucial political role in the late 19th century, expressing unfailing support for the president’s continued re-elections. Among them in 1888 were the Pabellón Español, which advertised itself as a ‘journal exclusively dedicated to the defense of Spanish interests’; the Trait d’Union, The Mexican Financier, Voz de España, and the magazine Revista Latino-Americana (Ruiz Castañeda, 1973: 215-217). It was not until after the 1910 Revolution and the new Mexican Constitution of 1917 that freedom of the press was again guaranteed.\n\n9In spite of Porfirian control over workers’ organizations and the repression of opposition literature, workers movements generated a diverse and active press landscape as of the mid-19th century. Characterized by contending ideological and political projects, it spoke in tandem in the voices of mine, textile and tobacco workers, artisans and peasants. It began with the press of guild associations and then communist, socialist and anarchist newspapers denounced the interests of foreign capital and the land question. A conciliating press spoke in the name of mutual aid associations, sponsored by the Porfirian regime as antidotes to socialism and communism. These defended education and moral cultivation as solutions to workers’ conditions, condemning idleness and vagrancy. As the social movements that would eventually converge in the Mexican Revolution grew strong during the early years of the 20th century, a rising tide of opposition press overtook the worker’s press. This new independent press, liberal and revolutionary, whose contributors and editors were systematically persecuted and often exiled, was produced the length and width of the country and sometimes also from the safe haven of border towns like San Antonio, Texas, or Los Angeles, California. The revolution interrupted and co-opted the workers’ movement, and its press was reduced to the publications of the large workers unions (García Cantu in Bringas, 1988: 27-28).\n\n10The press in Mexico evolved towards a new journalism model during the first decades of the twentieth century. In 1916, in the midst of revolutionary uncertainty, Felix Palavincini established a new daily, also called El Universal. It incorporated the trappings of modern journalism with a strong North American imprint, adopting new formats and discourses of news reporting that were slowly becoming hegemonic. El Excelsior, founded by Rafael Alducin in 1917, modelled itself on the Times of New York, competing with El Universal. Both were established following an industrial model, included English language pages and campaigned for the Allies during both world wars (Reed Torres in Ruiz Castañeda, 1973: 262). By December 1940, when the General Headquarters for Information were established as a division of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of periodical publications registered with the Mexican Postal and Telegraphs Office was 1,093, of which 426 were produced in Mexico City.\n\nOttoman Mexican Periodicals\n\n11Arabic language and bilingual Arabic-Spanish periodicals multiplied in Mexico City in the first decade of the twentieth century, nearly thirty years into the establishment of the migratory circuit. Mashriqi press was less visible in Mexican public space than the periodical publications established in Euroamerican languages and scripts by other colonies of foreigners residing in Mexico. The migrant press was not supported by a state and did not share the production circuit of the new press industry. Its producers were rarely professional journalists; even those who had professional training in journalism usually made their living through other means. In fact, the Mexican Mahjar press might be best contextualized through the mutualist project which infused other early community institutions: the first associations established by migrants catered to communal solidarities, operating as shared savings funds for emergency redistribution and called themselves mutual aid societies.\n\n7 El Emir, no. 13, p. 17.\n\nIn spite of this, there was a fracture in the Colony, because of the creation of an Ottoman consulate, having as official candidate Nasib Bey Kuri, which didn’t please some who instead championed the Mexican politician and banker Don Francisco Pimentel y Fagoaga, Director of the Central Bank. Of this controversy several newspapers were born, divided into two camps, each supporting the politics of the party that created it.\n\n14Al-Kadaa [The Decision] was created in 1909 to promote Nasib Bey Kuri’s candidacy for the post of Ottoman consul in Mexico. Were some of the periodicals, which apparently succumbed to mundane unviability, like the ephemeral Diario Era Nueva [New Era Daily] edited by Jalil Daher’s, or Vida Nueva [New Life] founded by Rashid Khuri who arrived in Mexico from Brazil, among those involved in the consulate controversy? Or was this an unsuccessful transplant from the denser South American Mahjar horizon of publication? Periodicals were numerous in Brazil and Argentina, where large numbers of migrants concentrated. Argentina had a particularly active cluster of periodicals and presses that translated classic texts like the Quran and Kalila wa Dimna. Meanwhile Al-Khawatir honored Mexico’s 1910 independence centennial with a month of special issues. Al-Huruades/Sucesos [Events] was a Maronite religious magazine coordinated by Father Chekrala Juri. A circle of Mahjaris writing in Arabic emerged in South America in 1916, calling themselves Al Rabitat al Qalamiyya and Al-Andalus (Martinez Lillo, 2008). In later decades, the Latin American Mahjar at large was referred to as Al-Andalus (al-Mulaththam, 1956).\n\nMexican Mahjar Mandate Press\n\n16The consequences of the transition from Ottoman to French Mandate administration for migrants’ press projects mirror Mahjar associational life more broadly. A new set of concerns and institutions emerged towards the end of the First World War. New periodicals sprang up as part of the new constellation of power brought about by France’s Mandate in the Mashriq. The initial effervescence and multiplication of venues in response to the hopes raised and dashed by the prospect of independence from Ottoman rule gave way to intense debates around the reality of French rule which brought French policing and intervention into the associational landscape. Associations calling themselves political parties appeared on the Mahjari horizon for the first time. Their names reflected the surging debate over the fate of the Mashriq after the impending Ottoman collapse and the territorial dismembering of the Empire. These associations indexed fierce disagreements between Pan-Arabists advocating the independence of Greater Syria, a diverse entity incorporating the current nation-states of Syria, Lebanon, Israel/Palestine, as well as parts of Iraq and Jordan, which clashed with Maronite factions seeking an independent Christian Lebanese nation.\n\n19After the turbulent 20’s, periodical production settled, with Maronite dominated Francophile periodicals integrating contributors and a broad readership across the North, Central and South American Mahjars and addressing interlocutors in the Mashriq as well. Of the periodicals produced during this second peak in the migratory pulse, two, Al-Ghurbal (1922-1990) and El Emir (1937-1974) were particularly long-lived. Though Al-Ghurbal appeared initially as an Arabic language broadsheet, it went through three phases, slowly transitioning to a bilingual broadsheet and eventually to a Spanish language monthly magazine. Its third phase is available through a partial digitalization hosted by Mexico City’s Centro Libanes website, the early decades are unknown except through single broadsheets which occasionally surface in archival settings (at the Lebanese National Library for example). El Emir was produced as a Spanish language monthly magazine from its inception in 1937.\n\nProducers, consumers and the construction of authority\n\n20Periodical publications like Al-Ghurbal and El Emir were characterized by a peculiar restriction and differentiation of their readership. Along with the popularization of the history, geography and literature of the Mashriq, the construction of Mahjari community within the framework of Mexican national space was one of El Emir’s explicit objectives, as its first editorial advertises:\n\n14 El Emir, no. 1, México DF, June 1937, p .4.\n\nFacts clearly show that the Lebanese Colony is not merely an agglomeration of immigrants but a coherent unit, an ensemble of wills with a common aspiration: honoring the faraway homeland in every way… Our strength is that in presenting the homeland’s history, we gather closer together. Sharing with those living in the provinces how those in the capital work, telling those who live in the north what the inhabitants of the south do. Building constant communication between these and those, regardless of economic or social category…\n\n21The magazines were consumed primarily by migrants, producing community insofar as it was mobile subjects who cultivated affiliation to migrant institutions and larger migrant networks who were likewise aware of and subscribed to such periodicals. Aued mentions as another goal his intention to “Further intellectual exchange between two like-minded cultures which had several centuries of contact”, bringing the Lebanese colony closer to “the Mexican people”, in contrast to Arabic language journalism, whose audience in Mexico was limited to a migrant notability that spoke and read fusha and their entourage.\n\n24Though it never circulated widely beyond the migrant population, El Emir developed an interconfessional and transnational public. Publishing political and cultural briefs, interviews and editorials, covering news in Mashriq and Mahjar, it included notable obituaries like Mustafa Kemal Pasha’s, the text of the new Syrian and Lebanese constitutions, text and music of the Algerian March and French consular announcements regarding national status and nationalization options, calling migrants to register with the French authorities. It published letters and contributions from readers living in the Mexican provinces and in every corner of the Latin American Mahjar: Tucuman, Argentina; Santo Domingo; Honduras; Cuba; the United States. Mahjar intellectuals contributed articles and conference transcripts, notably Habib Estefano (1888-1946) from Argentina and Esteban Fayad from Venezuela; its circulation contributed to the making of the greater American Mahjar.\n\nThe 1936 Palestinian Revolt as spectacle\n\n25Guy Debord has argued that in modern industrial formations, life “announces itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. All that which was lived directly has become estranged in a representation” (Debord, 1967: 15). Spectacle, whose most immediate and overwhelming form are the media, does not constitute a series of images but a social relationship between people, mediated by images. In his analysis, our modern appetite for spectacle is derived from industrial conditions of production. Mashriqis in the Mexican Mahjar came to relate to events unfolding in British Palestine as spectacle. The particular estrangement afforded by media coverage was compounded by multiple distances mediating migrants’ relationship to Palestine. Though inhabitants of a common Bilad al-Sham, the majority of Mashriqis in Mexico had travelled from what are now Syria and Lebanon, with only a few families arriving from Ottoman or British Palestine. Despite sustained economic and affective investment in the Mashriq, press narratives and other practices cultivating continuities could not elide the materiality of Mahjari distance from everyday life in the Mashriq. In both senses, Mashriqis in Mexico were spectators to the escalating conflict. Finally, textual representation of the conflict became ever more spectacular, notes initially titled “Palestine of Blood and Fire”, transitioned to “The Dangerous Chimera: the Jewish State in Palestine”, followed by the impassioned “The Palestinian Tragedy and our Duty” and the final manicheism of “Arabs or Jews- whom will Great Britain favor?”\n\n26In Mexican industrial press coverage and sometimes in the Emir, reportage as a genre emulated the detached style of the North American professional press. The suppression of explicit political positioning constructed a claim to objectivity, making these reports into texts that are difficult to question, rather than politically innocent accounts. In Mexican criollo media giants such as El Universal and El Excelsior, 1948 provoked punctual coverage of the armed confrontation. The advances and retreats of contending armies, their relative strength, crises and disgraces were narrated in a deliberately neutral affect, carefully eliminating all indexes of proximity to unfolding events in order to report them. The Mahjar press however, as it is visible in El Emir, presents an important contrast. Printed articles, which were often the verbatim transcripts of live public oratory, present an explicit affective charge. Affective proximity characterized Mahjari press, in which coverage of the Palestinian process became politicized and garnered urgency a decade earlier than in the mainstream Mexican press.\n\n27El Emir’s discourse on the Palestinian region was radically transformed between 1937, when the periodical was initially published and 1939, when coverage of the Palestinian Revolt intensified. Palestine as a spectacle of natural beauty presented through the depiction of landscape was supplanted by the textual spectacle of the conflict and human suffering. The initial descriptions of a geography of recreation gave way to heated debate around the ‘Palestine question’ and its moral geography. Coverage migrated from the periodical sections intended for a general public, neutral in terms of gender and generation, to the masculinized public sphere of political and moral debate.\n\nRepresenting Palestine, representing Jewish populations\n\n19 El Emir, no. 3 August, p. 33.\n\nPalestine, which is under British Mandate, is divided into five districts… the population of Palestine is calculated at 120,000, of which 40,000 are Israelites and 80,000 Arabs… The capital is Jerusalem… Tel Aviv, only city in the world with a completely Jewish population and which has more than 90,000 inhabitants. Before 1914 it was considered a neighborhood of Jaffa, it is now considered an independent city and has grown in importance, having modernized… Jaffa, the second largest port and main exporter of oranges…\n\n29The text framed these ‘facts’ through a Biblical history of the region, noting the importance of Bethlehem and Jerusalem as sites of Christian pilgrimage, constitutive of the Holy Land.\n\n30The same number included a note about the impending partition of the area under British Mandate, in terms that reflect more concern about access to the Holy Land for Christendom than for the futures of local populations:\n\n20 El Emir, no. 3 August, p. 6.\n\nThe constitution of the Palestinian state\n\nLondon - The Commission of Inquiry on Palestine has published its recommendation. This report comes to the conclusion of dividing Palestine into two sovereign States, one Jewish and the other Arab. These two states will be under British Mandate.\n\nThis recommendation, in dividing the two states, attempts to end the eternal conflict between Arabs and Jews. Concerning the Holy places, Great Britain commits to sustaining the historical character of Jerusalem, Nazareth and Bethlehem, guaranteeing free access to these places for the entire world.\n\n32At this point, the magazine still included articles on spectacular sites in Palestine, like María Yunis de Henaine’s piece Mount Carmel:\n\n22 El Emir, no. 6, November 1937, p. 16.\n\nMount Carmel, situated next to the Mediterranean Sea, is fertile and abundant in all manners of fruit; besides this, the majesty and beauty of its topographical position, the gentleness of its climate, the balmy environment of its varying flowers and aromatic plants, are described in Sacred Scripture, which employs the words Promised Land that brings forth milk and honey… It rises majestic covered in abundant olive plantations, which grow strong and healthy on its skirts, its flora is most beautiful and varied, such as there is no other in Palestine. It is a sight to behold, Mt Carmel, especially in the springtime, all of it sown with most beautiful flowers, varied in their color and in their species, which grow strong and healthy even in the cracks of rocks…they make time spent on the Holy Mount lovely and delightful, the inimitable and varied song of little birds of showy feathers that inhabit it, including their queen, the eagle, who hides her nest in the crevices of its inaccessible rocks… It can be said with no exaggeration that Muslims, Bedouin, Druze, Hebrews and Protestants; people of all creeds, come to offer up their prayers at this cave…\n\nThe radicalization of migrant opinion\n\n36The breaking point came in El Emir with the impassioned editorial “The Palestinian Tragedy and our Duty”, published on November 1938 in the magazine’s 18th number. Recognizing that this intervention exceeded his original intent in producing a periodical, Don Alfonso Aued, the editor, denounced the global press, cinema and periodical publications for representing events with a systematic bias. As a result, “the reader, who is not well informed on matters in the Near East – the majority – believes that Palestinian Arabs are barbarous and love disorder”. Aued suggested an alternative narrative: Great Britain, seeking funds during the first World War, promised Palestine to British Jewish notables. Once victorious, Great Britain took over the country without local consent and allowed an expansive immigration: “The Jews, with British support, have entered Palestine as a conquered country, attempting to displace its former inhabitants economically and materially”. Aued argued that support for Zionist imperialism was not limited to Great Britain, since it received financial support from the “judeo-yankee plutocracy”. Palestinians, whom the author now referred to as ‘the Palestinian people’ have responded to the situation with a series of revolutions of which the most recent is the most intense and long-lasting: “It is no longer one group, or some groups, but the entire nation. Noble example of an entire people that struggles against the force of intrigue, the power of money and the strength of arms to defend its territory and preserve its identity”. He considers that, dying in struggle, Palestinians have done their duty as “civilized men”. Such conditions even make Arab Jews of Palestine “enemies of the newcomers”. He concludes: “In the face of all these facts, is there any Lebanese who does not feel the duty to see to his Palestinian brothers?” In a problematic turn, he ends with “That before the river of lies about Palestine, brothers in language and tradition might be erected a mountain of truths. For the time being, destiny begins to avenge the Palestinians. In Germany, Jews are expelled and their property confiscated. As the Scriptures say, ‘Wish not unto others what you don’t want for yourself!’”\n\n30 El Emir, no. 23 and 24, April and May 1939, p. 23.\n\nI come with the great patriot and well-known Palestinian journalist M. Emilio Gouri, as delegates of the Palestinian Arab Committee presided by the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Hajj Amin Hussaini–great patriot who lives out his exile in Lebanon. Our goal is to explain to emigrants in America the true situation in Palestine and request their support for the thousands of orphans and widows of the heroic people whose fathers and husbands fell valiantly in the field of honor. Not only Palestinians struggle for this dear land, with them fall side by side in combat Lebanese, Syrians, Iraqis, Transjordanians who make their way in despite British vigilance and the giant barbed wire fence on every Palestinian border, like a new Chinese Wall. Palestine has become a sort of key possession, the object of a common struggle for all the states of the Orient, as a symbol of their liberation.\n\nArab Modern\n\n40At the turn of the twentieth century, elites in geographies subaltern to Europe began developing the nationalisms that would launch decolonization, establishing foundational fictions for postcolonial states. Struggling to dismantle European hegemony locally, anti-colonial nationalists rooted in distinct colonial histories nevertheless complied with an overarching Eurocentric narrative. Colonized elites claimed the postcolonial state by displaying familiarity with European modernity, often acquired through migration and education in metropolitan centers (Duara, 2003). The modernist intelligentsia gestated through Ottoman reform and integration into the world economy during the long nineteenth century, initially active in migratory circuits spanning the Arab and European Mediterranean, extended mobility to the American Mahjars.\n\n41Public debate on the question of Ottoman relations with Euro-America surged across Mashriq and Mahjar, producing Nahda narratives concerned, like other anticolonial nationalisms, with situating Arabs as both heirs to a glorious ancient civilization and cosmopolitan moderns. In formulating an Arab modern, reformers operated within European discourses of nationhood whose ideologues were often enthusiasts of empire. Perverse Trojan horses, the categories of modernity, of its political thought and emancipatory rhetoric, contained assumptions that enforced Europe as omnipresent referent (Chakrabarty, 1992, 2000), conditioning Arab views of non-European others (Pastor, 2014). Modernist Nahda claims had emancipatory as well as subordinating effects as they intersected with criollo postcolonial modernism in the Mexican Mahjar debates on who constituted desirable or undesirable migrant arrivals.\n\n42The metaphor of nations awakening from a long period of slumber separating their ancient glory from modern subalternity was common to many regions of the colonial world. It became central to a global subversive discourse of civilization in which African, Arab, Asian, and Euro-American critics of the West converged. Anticolonial leaderships legitimated their mobilization and transformation of the people by appealing to an alleged ancient unity, describing the nationalisms they sought to build as national awakenings (Duara, 2003: 6.). Arab nationalisms were founded on the trope of decline during the period of Ottoman administration; a medieval condition or ossification from which Arabs were finally jostled awake through an unsettling but felicitous encounter with Euro-American modernity on the brink of the twentieth century (Hitti, 1943: 213). Nationalists who embraced Euro-American presence in the Mashriq extended credit for the Nahda awakening to particular imperial nations, reflecting personal patronage circuits. Abd El-Jalil, a professor at the Catholic University of Paris, refers to European, especially French Orientalists: “It is hardly necessary to say that it [the Nahda] owes much to the work of Orientalists. We recognize our immense debt to them…” (Abd El-Jalil, 1943: 7). Or “It was America’s knock that awakened the Arab East from its medieval slumber and set it on the road to modernism and national progress in the 1870s” (Hitti, 1943: viii).\n\n43Imagined as culturally and morally closer to European empires than their Muslim compatriots, Christian Arabs had acquired the privilege of missionary education disproportionately. Christian nationalists emphasized an Arab literary renaissance as crucial precursor to political consciousness and attributed the Nahda to Christian Arabs of Bilad al-Sham. Dawn (1991: 3) argues that this interpretation was first popularized in the West by George Antonius in his 1938 The Arab Awakening, and later in a more ambivalent and complex form, restated by Sharabi 1972, Tibi, 1981 and Hourani (1981, 1991, 2003). It also occurs in Abd El-Jalil (1943), Hitti (1943), Sayegh, and Atiyah (1958). Abd al-Jalil suggested that a revived concern with the Arabic language initially emerged among Christian populations; he noted that as early as the seventeenth century, a movement championing Arab linguistic purism developed in Christian circles in Aleppo (Abd El-Jalil, 1943: 219).\n\n44The Mexican Mahjar press presented variations on this theme in the 1930s and 40s. (Nimeh, 1946: 282-83). Lebanese Christians were attributed a stellar role based on the Uniate churches’ historical ties to Rome, with Maronite sensibilities detaching Lebanese experience from that of Syrians:\n\n33 “Duaihi y el Renacimiento Libanés”, El Emir, no. 6, November 1937, p. 14-15.\n\n…as of that time [Arab language and literature] sank into the dark depths of a lethargic slumber which would have been eternal but for the indefatigable efforts of the Lebanese and the missionaries, both French (who arrived in 1625) and American (who arrived in 1820). Syria had its flourishing in the time of the Greeks and the Romans and later in the time of the Arabs. Its decadence began with the arrival of elements that neither had a culture nor knew how to assimilate: The Kurds, Turks, Mamlukes and Turcomans, who under the banner of Islam dominated the Syrian people, far superior to them in culture and civilization. And thus the torch that illuminated the ancient world went out. The decadence of Syria was followed by the decadence of Phoenicia, because the rulers–Mamlukes, Turks–did away with everything. The schools of Aleppo that existed during the reign of Saladdin disappeared. Fanaticism and ignorance reigned during several centuries. This lethargic life – which went on for a long time – was followed by a renaissance, slow at first but which later accelerated, and the movement which began as a religious one, became a social one. The achievement is due to the popes of Rome, who in educating young Lebanese men later caused them to found national schools and spread culture in the Orient.\n\n45Syrian civilization was given a Greek, Roman and Arab pedigree, distinct from the Lebanese Phoenician past. The Nahda was imagined as originating in the Uniate churches’ cultivation of links with Rome since the sixteenth century. Once the Melkite and Maronite churches recognized papal authority, religious scholars occasionally travelled to study or teach in Europe, especially after the establishment of the Maronite College in Rome in 1584 (Eddé, 2001: 135-7). Crafting respectability in an overwhelmingly Catholic country, Mexican Maronites recruited the Pope as suitable Nahda sponsor.\n\nGenealogies for Travelers and Conquerors\n\n46Christian histories of the Nahda buttressed debates defending Mahjaris as desirable conquerors in El Emir (Pastor, 2012, 2014). Mashriqi intellectuals defending their desirability as immigrants in Mexico were eventually, though not initially, validated by local state ideologues and intellectuals. Their modernist genealogical construction which began with fantasies about Phoenician pasts turned indignant with the publication of José Vasconcelos’ ¿Que es el comunismo? in 1936. Minister of state and foremost ideologue of the postrevolutionary national project, Vasconcelos celebrated the Día de la Raza as commemoration of the “Discovery of America”:\n\nWe are gathered to celebrate the most important event in our American history, the discovery that linked the New World with Europe, incorporating all of these territories into civilization… Day of the Race; that is to say, the date of homage to the Spanish race in whose glories we have a share because we are part of Hispanic culture and because a branch of our ancestors sailed in the caravels of the immortal expedition… The transcendence of Colon’s findings resides in the fact that he made his discovery as a Spaniard in the company of Spaniards… and since Spaniards were then the most cultured nation of Europe, they were not content to fill the deserts with half naked offspring like any barbarous tribe, but rather in three centuries of incomparable civilizing effort they built the twenty-something nations which constitute the Latin world of America… So that our fathers the conquerors and explorers, as well as our teachers the missionaries, were when they arrived in these territories the flower of the Europe of their time, and the first among races in the World. (Vasconcelos, 1936: 105-09).\n\n47Vasconcelos launched his hundred and twenty page pamphlet rumination on the Spanish Civil War and the defects of the Calles administration by lamenting the expulsion of “defenseless Spaniards” during the Mexican Revolution and their substitution in the national landscape by Jews and Syro-Lebanese: “deaf persecution ended up replacing in our cities and towns, our own Spaniard, with the communist Jew who today exploits petty industry and a good part of commerce, but speaks English; by replacing him with the Syro Lebanese who does not improve our race, but worsens it” (Vasconcelos, 1936: 11). Vasconcelos identified progress, democracy and civilization with Christianity, and saw all of these incarnate in the Spanish tradition. He envisioned the empowerment of Latin America through a confederation of Hispanic nations, given Spain’s reluctance to engage in enlightened imperialism.\n\n50Aued described Mahjaris as abstract Phoenician conquerors and colonizers, hinting at their conquest of the Americas at large; or more specifically as conquerors of the Mediterranean, Spain and the Americas. He argued that they were equivalent to the Spanish colonizer in their modern Latin American adventure, given elaborate parallels construed across the histories of both peoples. Phoenician were the conquerors of the conquerors of Iberoamerica, the Spaniards their descendants. In an editorial titled “The Lebanese and the Progress of America,” Aued narrated parallel and interlocking racial histories for Mashriqis and Spaniards in the Mediterranean:\n\n37 Aued, El Emir, no. 19, December 1938, p. 3.\n\nThe first to dominate Spain were Phoenicians and Carthaginians—our ancestors—, the Spaniard has Phoenician blood in his veins. The Lebanese in turn is a direct descendant of the Phoenicians. Later, Greeks and Romans conquer the ancient Phoenician land and they also impose their dominion on the Iberian Peninsula. Yet Arab blood also mixes in Spain and Lebanon. This way, indestructible parities were created which give ethnic parity to the two peoples, the Spanish and the Lebanese.\n\n51According to Aued, spiritual parity of Spanish and Lebanese peoples derived from the fact that both have labored and battled in defense of the Christian faith. Parallels continue in their encounter with the Americas:\n\n38 Aued, El Emir, no. 19, December 1938, p. 3.\n\nAnd with the same agility with which the ancient Phoenicians sail the seas, the Spaniard crosses the pond… Comes to America… Conquers all and obtains all, but at the same time gives his blood, his language and his religion to the land in which he arrives… In turn, the Lebanese [man] comes to America and he is not satisfied to make his fortune, but ties himself to America’s blood, establishes his house and does not forget the motherland but loves the new land.\n\n52Spanish and Mashriqi accumulation in the Americas is a noble enterprise, a generous surrender. Aued distinguished the legitimacy of Mashriqi partnership with criollo nations by contrasting the noble restraint of Mashriqi profit from the irresponsible accumulation of North American and European migrants:\n\n39 Aued, El Emir, no. 19, December 1938, p. 4.\n\nAnd the noble character of this labor is fully understood when it becomes known that, even after twenty or thirty years, most of those merchants don’t make fortunes greater than twenty or thirty thousand pesos… Big industry and mining require enormous capitals. They are exclusively in the hands of the Americans and Europeans. Culture and science are French and Spanish imports. All of this has been useful to the upper middle class, the Indian has been left aside. He is considered a stranger to all these goings on… when the revolution came, the Indian had had no contact with the Western world other than through the Lebanese who had gone all the way to his house in order to dress him and the ancient missionary friars who taught him their religion and tried to get him to learn their language… But now the Lebanese is no longer a stranger who will introduce something unknown [to the people], now, because of his home already established, because of his wealth, already made in America, he is the brother who is helping to forge the new homeland… The Lebanese is, in the evolution of the Americas, an unquestionable truth of civilization and progress.\n\n53Mashriqi businessmen were thus construed as morally as well as racially, ethnically and spiritually equivalent to the criollo postrevolutionary elites, willing, capable, and responsible partners to their modernizing mission.\n\n54Careful to sustain the parallel without positing the modern migrant as a direct conqueror, Aued argued that the Spaniards’ civilizing achievements had remained unfinished: “Three hundred years have not been enough to fully inject Western customs into the indigenous peoples”. And this is where the modern partnership between civilized peers became crucial to progress:\n\n40 Aued, El Emir, no. 19, December 1938, p. 4.\n\nWhere elegant or rich commerce disdained to go he goes and begins by selling suits to the people who scarcely clothe themselves… not only does he change the way of dressing, he transforms footgear: huaraches (sandals) are substituted by leather shoes and tennis shoes. And the significance that dress has for the progress of a people is no secret for anyone. Peter the Great, Mustafa Kemal Pacha in Turkey, saw this problem clearly: they understood that the feeling of inferiority that their people had before the French, the English etc. was due, more than anything else, to clothing…\n\n55Some authors went as far as attributing the origins of the Universal civilization claimed by the West to Phoenicians:\n\n41 “El Origen de los Libaneses”, Emir, p. 8 (Esteban Fayad?).\n\nI take up my pen to sing the great deeds of my ancestors,\n\nwho contributed to contemporary civilization\n\nthe foundations on which it rests.\n\n57In El Emir’s seventy third number, Leonardo Kaim and Aziz Hatem again took issue with Vasconcelos’ characterization of Mashriqis as undesirable. Vasconcelos replied in May 1943:\n\n43 Correspondence reproduced in El Emir, no. 73, p. 16.\n\nI cannot and should not take back the affirmation I made about the Spanish race being superior and more desirable as a migrant race. This does not hinder appreciation and tenderness towards people or migrants of other races. Thus, as you have pointed out to me, I have friends whom I appreciate and respect in the Syro-Lebanese colony; but this does not mean that even today the Syro-Lebanese race could demonstrate a capacity for cultural creativity, a spiritual development comparable to the Spanish. Of my own Mexican people, it would be absurd to say that their historical level and their qualities could be compared to those of the Spanish. Therefore, I think that stirring up resentment regarding self-evident facts does not contribute anything to the conviviality of the different races that have to coexist peacefully in democracies.\n\n58Vasconcelos seemed unshakeable in his evaluation of Mahjaris and Mexicans as less worthy than the Spanish. Their common subordination to his European ideal however, facilitated their equivalence.\n\nThe Phoenician Civilizing Mission\n\n61Another recurrent claim was that of an early Phoenician discovery and conquest of the Americas. Nimeh goes so far as to attribute the great Amerindian traditions to them:\n\nThe Phoenicians were the first great colonizers of History, the first colonizers who implanted their civilization everywhere, in all its aspects, beauty, love and material improvements… THERE WAS NO CORNER, NO MATER HOW REMOTE, THAT THEY DIDN’T KNOW; and abandoning their Mediterranean lake, they traversed Hercules’ columns (Gibraltar), circumnavigated Africa in three years, from the shores of the Red Sea to the Cape of Good Hope, and they built the city of Dakar, reaching as far as the British Isles and the shores of America in the middle of the XII century B.C. This last fact, extremely interesting, has been sufficiently revealed with the findings in Brazil and in Santo Domingo, the specialists in the matter assert that the small group of Phoenicians which conquered the Brazilian coasts probably founded the Inca, Maya and Aztec civilizations and reached as far as the Yucatan Peninsula. (Nimeh, 1945: 94)\n\n62The early Phoenician discovery of the Americas continues to be defended in the early twenty-first century by leading community intellectuals (Edde, 2001; Martínez Assad, 2003: 188-89). Situating Phoenician traders at the origin of great Amerindian civilizations staked two claims, one universalizing and the other localizing. Grandly, it claimed a Phoenician origin for universal civilization, regardless of where or when civilization flourished. In the context of the post-Revolutionary Mexican national project, it also portrayed Mahjaris as already local. Not only were the Phoenicians at the origin of the Mediterranean civilization that conquered the New World, they were also the root of New World civilizations themselves. Phoenicians were always already there in the Spanish/Indian fusion championed by Vasconcelos as the essence of the Mexican.\n\n63Mahjar intellectuals must have been convincing in print and beyond because by the time Nimeh’s History of Lebanon appeared, Vasconcelos prefaced it in glowing welcome:\n\nBut America is a land which belongs to all men, and since we are fortunate to have among us a distinguished groups of Lebanese, who by the way show themselves to be good Mexicans, it is convenient that we know what the small but illustrious nation which is the cradle of our compatriots of Lebanese origin is and has been. Dr. Nimeh’s book, “History of Lebanon” provides us with the means to access this knowledge. Dr. Nimeh is a distinguished professional… An expert in history and Arab topics, this prepares him to understand the Spanish, insofar as the Arab element endures in the Spanish. Not an unimportant influence, excepting the religious aspect, which is of course antithetical in the two cultures. Dr. Nimeh’s book saves us from a common error, which is to mistake the Lebanese for the Arab, the Syrian, even the Turk. The Lebanese is distinct from all other groups of the Orient. Most Lebanese are of Phoenician origin, though some Arab blood runs in their veins and their language is Arabic. And it is well known that the Phoenicians were the first colonizing people in history. Once Phoenician power had disappeared, the Lebanese, now living in a Roman province, contributed to the glory of the Empire, were part of the Roman army and mixed with the patricians. Likewise, at the dawn of Christianity the Lebanese take the lead and contribute martyrs and saints very early on… In modern times, Beirut has been a cultural center with a strong French influence… Souls with affinities to our Western tradition, it is only natural that they will soon assimilate to the idiosyncrasies of the American nations and become collaborators in their progress… Dr. Nimeh’s book should not then be exotic for us, but something that is already part of the Hispano-Mexican heritage. (Vasconcelos in Nimeh, 1946: 9-10)\n\n64Vasconcelos was finally happy to recognize Mashriqis as another conquering element in his vision of mestizaje, the racial and cultural mixing which he argued constituted the distinctive and vital force sustaining the Mexican nation. Phoenician origins and French influence over the Mashriq ensured Mahjari affinities with Mexico’s “Western tradition”, making them adequate collaborators to national progress. The Mahjari campaign to make migration palatable to the Mexican public continued with the support of local journalists, for instance the Unión Libanesa Mundial published journalist Enrique Castro Farias’ Aporte Libanés al Progreso de America in 1965.\n\nConclusion\n\n65Through their press production, Maronite Mahjaris in Mexico actively defined the terms of their participation in Mexican Mahjar social formations by invoking and intervening in two key debates. They inscribed boundaries that produced them as distinct from Muslims and Jews, through a refusal to identify with the Palestinian Arab Revolt of 1936-1938. In a decade-long parallel debate, they produced local Amerindian and mestizo populations as subordinate to Arabs and Phoenicians. Articulating alternatives to xenophobic state and popular discourse, Mahjaris used their status as French protégés and Mexican ideologies conflating race, class and religious tradition to secure privilege."
