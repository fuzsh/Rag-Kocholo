        "text": "“An Original Man: The Life and Times of Elijah Muhammad”, “Black Nationalism: A Search for Identity in America”, and “The Black Muslims in America” are some books that go into very descriptive detail to portray the person Elijah Muhammad was and how he used his religion, The Nation of Islam, to deliver his messages and gain followers as well as traction in his movements. These books proceed to enlighten the reader of the plight of African-Americans in the 20th century and how Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam was a sign of strength and fortitude which encouraged those within its reach to better themselves and their communities.

The author highlights specific examples from the day to day life of Imam Shata, which supports the author’s argument. Nevertheless, the author fails to cite any sources or any outside authorities and only uses the main character, Imam Shata, to present the balance of the conflict. She achieves such a balance by showing how the Imam reacts in the face of the two different situations. In addition, the author presents examples of situations in which the Imam welcomed the ‘American’ issues with creativity and flexibility.\n\nEssay On The Scarlet Ibis\n\n1049 Words | 5 Pages\n\nArab Open University Faculty of Language Studies Tutor Marked Assignment (TMA) EL121: The Short Story and Essay Writing Fall Semester 2015-2016 Part (I): STUDENT INFORMATION (to be completed by student) 1.\n\nNaomi Shihab Nye Analysis\n\n1221 Words | 5 Pages\n\nNaomi Shihab Nye has exposed the need for coexistence, and the affirmation of the Arab-American identity in \"Arabic Coffee\", \"Half-and-Half\", and \"Blood\" from 19 Varieties of Gazelle: Poems of Middle East, and \"Arabic\" from her collection Red\n\nAnalysis Of Mahmoud Darwish's Memory For Forgetfulness\n\n1288 Words | 6 Pages\n\nIn 1948, Mahmoud Darwish was six years old when his interrupted childhood brutally confronted exile. Thousands of Palestinians were forced to exile due to the systematic occupation by the Israelis. For Darwish, severance from the homeland gave birth to his poetry, and commenced a love affair with location and dislocation. Throughout Mahmoud Darwish 's poetics is the linkage of individuals or occupied entities to the ideal of a universal struggle for freedom and liberty from oppression, and a link to the beauty of life and language through the creative process, thus affirming Wellek and Warren 's notion that: \"the work of literature is an aesthetic object, capable of arousing aesthetic experience.\" (1984: 241).\n\nThe Neo-Marxist Criticism In James Joyce's Araby\n\n1102 Words | 5 Pages\n\nIn October 1905, James Joyce wrote “Araby” on an unnamed narrator and like his other stories, they are all centered in an epiphany, concerned with forms of failures that result in realizations and disappointments.

Joyce uses a person vs. society formula as the central conflict of the story in which a naïve boy learns the difference between the fantastical nature of boyish love and the actuality of the real world. It is these two opposing perceptions that lead to the story’s central idea that adolescents acquire maturity through the forfeiture of innocence. Through the use of richly crafted settings, Joyce accentuates the narrator’s fumbling, first foray into adulthood.\n\nAnalysis Of Mahfouz's Arabian Nights And Days\n\n748 Words | 3 Pages\n\nMahfouz, as well as Said, shared a direct contact with the Arabian lifestyle because they grow up in that society.

Mahfouz aims to show various thematic concerns of the people of the East than the early versions left out.\n\nLiterary Symbolism In Araby\n\n797 Words | 4 Pages\n\nAraby As one grows older, one often looks back upon a moment in his or her life as being the point in time that they finally “grew up”.
