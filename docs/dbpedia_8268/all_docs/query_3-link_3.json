        "text": "The Mahjar can be considered the first period featuring a transnational expansion of Palestinian literary geography. The term “Mahjar” refers to a period of extensive migration from Palestine (and the Levant more broadly) to North, South and Central America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In terms of cultural and literary production, this period was divided into the northern Mahjar, focused primarily on the United States, and the southern Mahjar, which included Latin America and the Carribbean. Overall, the\n\nMahjar\n\nperiod remains an understudied black hole in the context of Palestinian literary history. The transnational literary links and networks formed as a result of these waves of migration, and the fluid back-and-forth movements of people, ideas, and texts across continents have yet to be fully uncovered and explored.\n\nIn the context of modern Arabic literary histories, the Mahjar (migration) period is linked to the development of romantic poetry by emigrant poets who continued to write and publish in Arabic.1 Particular emphasis is placed on the works of literary figures in the northern Mahjar, while little is known about those who wrote and published in the southern Mahjar. In recent decades, there has been a revived interest in the Mahjar period, especially in understanding the Arab communities in Latin America, resulting in several scholarly works.2 Although studies on the Mahjar period cover many disciplines, none provides a comprehensive and interconnected literary history of this period.3 Literary studies tend to focus either on anthologizing or engaging in textual analysis of works published in the northern Mahjar.4 While these works are important in building a base from which further studies can emerge, it is also crucial to frame the literature of the northern Mahjar as part of an intricate web of literary production, publication, and debate that reveals astounding literary interconnections across continents. Reconnecting the two Mahjars and linking them to literary production in the Arab world will be essential to fostering a better understanding of the latent transnationalism at the heart of this period of Arab literary history.\n\nPeriodicals, more than any other medium, were the site of literary publication and discussion as well as news communication and circulation during this period. Content analysis of periodicals exposes the scope of the transnational links and networks that spanned both the northern and southern Mahjar, as well as the Arab world. In the network of periodicals and countries, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Chile emerge as the literary hubs of the southern Mahjar. These literary hubs, represented by their periodicals, considered themselves part and parcel of Arabic literature, despite the fact that they were geographically far removed. More than that, they saw themselves as creating “al-Andalus al-jadid” (“a new Andalus”), building on the legacy of the golden age of Muslim rule of the Iberian peninsula between the eighth and tenth centuries, inspired by the conviviality and cultural renaissance associated with that period. It is no coincidence that the most important literary association of the southern Mahjar, established in São Paulo in 1933, was known as al-ʿUsba al-Andalusiyya (the Andalusian League), which also published its own periodical\n\nal-ʿUsba\n\n.\n\nResearching this period comes with its own challenges, particularly in locating and accessing Arabic-language Mahjar periodicals, some of which are now a century old. As these periodicals were considered community newspapers, along with those of the German and Italian communities who published periodicals in their own languages, many were not preserved or deposited in the national libraries of the countries of the northern and southern Mahjar. Existing local Arab institutions or associations may house copies of these periodicals; copies may also be found in private archives or libraries of individuals who collected this material.\n\nAnother challenge of this period is the process of identifying and selecting what can (or cannot) be considered part of Palestinian literary history. While a strong Palestinian political identity was already forming in Latin America in the 1920s, as detailed by Nadim Bawalsa,7 literary identity remained more broadly Arab in the sense that Palestinians and non-Palestinians could be seen to make significant contributions to Palestinian literature in different ways. An early version of pan-Arabism pervaded the first half of the twentieth century in the sense that the different migrant communities—namely, Palestinians, Lebanese, and Syrians—supported each other’s anticolonial national liberation projects and revolutions. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, which promised to establish a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, highlighted early on the unique colonial situation in Palestine. While other Arab countries were struggling toward national liberation, European colonial powers were preparing to hand Palestine over to another people, regardless of Palestinian resistance and revolution. This more than any other issue made Palestine a unifying cause for Arab communities in the diaspora and was taken up by many literary figures in the Mahjar.\n\nGiven that primary source material for this period is most likely not housed in conventional venues such as public libraries and archives, there is a need for creativity not only in searching for this material in unconventional locations, but also in tapping into sources outside the strict literary sphere. In addition to periodicals, sources such as travelogues, autobiographies, and memoirs are invaluable treasure troves of information and data. The next sections will discuss how periodicals expose local, regional and transnational links that allow us to piece together the geographically fragmented puzzle of modern Arabic literature during the Mahjar period.\n\nAmong the many al-Rusafi poems printed in Chile’s periodicals9 is a poem that he wrote while in Palestine in honor of Palestinian protests that broke out after the 1920 Nabi Musa festivities turned violent; this event poem was published in al-Watan’s May 22 1920 issue. Another al-Rusafi poem published a year later in al-Watan’s April 30, 1921 issue is reprinted from one of the most important Palestinian literary magazines,\n\nal-Nafaʾis al-ʿAsriyya\n\n, edited by\n\nKhalil Baidas\n\nin Jerusalem. Given that he lived in Palestine at the time, al-Rusafi also published his poetry in other Palestinian magazines such as\n\nBeit Lahm\n\n(Bethlehem),10 and newspapers such as\n\nMirʾat al-Sharq\n\n,\n\nFalastin\n\n, and al-Difaʿ .\n\nAlthough poetry dominated the contents of early twentieth century Arabic periodicals and literary production in general, prose in the form of short stories and serialized novels was nonetheless present. For example, Chile’s al-Shabiba newspaper printed a novel entitled ʿIbrat al-athhan fi ghawaʾil bint al-han (The Evils of Intemperance), which it serialized across its 1917 issues. The author of the novel is cited as the Lebanese writer Iskandar ʿAtiyya, and a footnote mentions that this novel was originally printed in “al-watan” (“the homeland”) at the behest of an unnamed charitable organization. Indeed the novel was printed in Beirut in 1893 and later reserialized by periodicals such as al-Shabiba in the Mahjar.11\n\nThe same issue also contained a special news item that focused on an important Syrian literary and early feminist figure, Labiba Hashim, who founded and owned Fatat al-Sharq (Eastern Girl) magazine. The article provides insight into Hashim’s literary output and praises her magazine for surviving longer than other women’s magazines in the Arab world. It also mentions that many of Hashim’s “khutab” (“lectures”) have been published in Arab newspapers and magazines. A month later, al-Watan’s February 9, 1920 issue printed a list of periodicals that were considered to have the most freedom to publish in the Arab world, including titles such as al-Mufid, al-Istiqlal al-ʿArabi,\n\nLisan al-ʿArab\n\n, and Suriyya al-Jadida.\n\nIn its literary section “Fi Riyad al-Adab” (“In the Garden of Literature”), al-Watan’s December 1920 issue carried literary news from Palestine: al-Beitjaly’s new novel, entitled Al-Haya baʿ d al-mawt (Life after Death), was under print.13 Readers of al-Watan were encouraged to order it directly from al-Beitjaly, whose personal address is provided at the end of the segment. The item was signed by al-Beitjaly and dated August 1920, which implies that news about the new novel may have reached al-Watan as a letter from al-Beitjaly sent a few months earlier. Many years later, in 1952, al-Beitjaly made a trip to Latin America as part of an Arab Orthodox Christian delegation to collect donations for a shelter for the sick and disabled in Jerusalem following the Palestinian Nakba (Catastrophe) of 1948.\n\nInter-Mahjar links become apparent through the publishing and reprinting of the news and works of Arab and Palestinian literary figures across various Mahjar locations. A more diverse set of contents is traceable in this context, from literary texts to essays, speeches, book reviews, editorials, coverage of literary events, and news of clubs and associations. In this regard, the content of Mahjar periodicals features three intertwined literary spheres: the local, the southern Mahjar, and the northern Mahjar.\n\nOn the local level, Chilean Arabic newspapers published the Arabic-speaking community’s literary texts and events, as well as relevant Chilean literary news. Literary content features mainly poetry but also a few cases of literary prose such as al-Watan’s “Qissat al-ʿAdad” (“Story of the Issue”)18 entitled “al-Qatil al-bariʾ ” (“The Innocent Killer”). The story’s author is unnamed, and, although it is not indicated, the story appears to be translated into Arabic from another language with no mention of the translator’s name.\n\nTwo forms of local poetry are prevalent in Mahjar periodicals: poetic contributions to the periodical and poetry recited at events and thereafter published in periodicals. When the Lebanese poet Jean Zalaquett took over as the editor-in-chief of a revived al-Watan newspaper in the 1940s, he began to regularly publish his own poetry.19 A special brand of mathematical poetry, often recited at events by Palestinian bishop Ilya Deeb, was also published in local periodicals. For example, in both its September 12 and October 2, 1920 issues, al-Watan published the texts of the poems that Bishop Deeb recited at events held at the Palestinian Club in Santiago. Bishop Deeb also wrote a poem celebrating al-Watan’s revival in the 1940s after a period of closure.20\n\nAn added confusion in the literary sections of these early Mahjar periodicals is that the word “adab,” which mostly denotes literature, is also used with its other meanings: morality, ethics, duty, responsibility, and good behavior. For example, a long discussion ensued in al-Islah’s literary section called “Bab al-Adab” (“Literary Section”) about the role of women in modern society.22 Other adab content featured a sustained discussion on how Mahjaris should behave, and what they should do and not do to better integrate into their new host societies.\n\nIn addition to a local engagement with Arabic literature, there is a perceptible engagement with the Chilean literary scene in Arabic periodicals published in Chile. One example is the news that Atalah sent a telegram to Gabriela Mistral to congratulate her on winning the Nobel Prize in Literature.24 Another example is coverage of the events and publications of the Friends of Arabic Literature Association, based at the University of Chile. The association invited prominent Chilean literary figures to present on topics related to Arabic literature. For example, al-Watan covered news of the lecture by Chilean writer Augusto d’Halmar, who presented on the topic of the Arab influence in Spain. In its coverage of these events, al-Watan often stressed the importance of the Friends of Arabic Literature Association in facilitating the good standing of the community in Chile and thanked Jamil Shouhi for his efforts and dedication to sustaining the association and its publications.25\n\nNews of periodicals was often also published in the literary section. A major preoccupation of periodicals at this time was their reception by other Arab periodicals. In some cases, these responses are printed in the periodical. For example, al-Watan reprinted what other periodicals wrote about it, including local periodicals such as al-Shabiba and al-ʿAwatif, as well as periodicals in other parts of the southern Mahjar such as several newspapers in Buenos Aires.26 Al-Watan also printed self-reflexive pieces such as the profile of former owner,\n\nIssa Khalil Dakrat\n\n, alongside reflections on the evolution of the newspaper,27 as well as an editorial by Zalaquette on the state of the Arab press in Chile.28\n\nFor its November 1936 special issue on Palestine, al-Islah newspaper commissioned several poems by well-known southern Mahjar poets who were also owners and editors of Arabic-language periodicals. These include the Lebanese poet Khayrallah Jarr, editor of al-Andalus al-Jadid magazine in Brazil, and the Syrian poet Ilyas Qunsol, editor of al-Jarida al-Suriyya al-Lubnaniyya in Argentina.30 The Palestine special issue also received endorsement in the form of a letter to the editor from the Lebanese poet\n\nIlyas Farhat\n\n, who was one of the founding members of the Andalusian League in 1933 in Brazil.31 Later issues of al-Islah featured more poetry from southern Mahjar poets such as the famous Lebanese poet Rashid Salim al-Khoury, who was known as al-Shaʿ ir al-Qarawi (“the Village Poet”).32 Al-Khoury was editor of al-Rabita magazine in São Paulo and became the president of the Andalusian League in 1953.\n\nThe decade of the 1940s was the beginning of the end for Mahjar literature, as many of the major literary figures in both the southern and northern Mahjar began to pass away. In this regard, Zalaquett, the new editor of al-Watan, became a prolific elegist. He published one of his first elegies in al-Watan in memory of the Lebanese poet\n\nRashid Ayyoub\n\n, one of the founding members of the Pen League in New York City.34\n\nMahjar periodicals were concerned not only with how they were received in the Arab world, but also with what other periodicals in the Mahjar wrote about them. In its early years, al-Watan reprinted comments on its founding and mission that were originally published in three Arabic-language periodicals in Argentina.38 After its revival in the 1940s, Zalaquett did the same by reprinting what al-Jarida al-Suriyya al-Lubnaniyya in Buenos Aires had to say about the second life of al-Watan and its new editor.39\n\nIn addition to reprinting literary content from other Mahjar periodicals, a newspaper like al-Islah also provided overviews and documentation of Mahjar periodicals in its literary section. For example, in the section titled “Fi-ʿAlam al-Adab” (“The World of Literature), al-Islah gives a comprehensive overview of important Arabic-language periodicals at the time, including those in the southern and northern Mahjar as well as the Arab world.40 A year later, al-Islah again published news of the Arab press in the section “Bab al-Adab” (“Literary Section”), this time focusing on the longest running newspapers in the Mahjar.41 The links between southern Mahjar periodicals were also buttressed by the relationships between editors. In 1937, George Assaf, the editor of one of the oldest Arabic newspapers in Latin America, al-Salam newspaper in Argentina, visited Chile and met with al-Islah, which in turn published Assaf’s poetry, a letter he wrote to the readers about the purpose of his trip to Chile, as well as a profile of Assaf during his journalistic mission in Chile.42"
