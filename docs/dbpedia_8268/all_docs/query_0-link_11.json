        "text": "Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.\n\nAnd the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.\n\nAnd how else can it be?\n\nI would not exchange the sorrows of my heart\n\nFor the joys of the multitude.\n\nAnd I would not have the tears that sadness makes\n\nTo flow from my every part turn into laughter.\n\nWhen my Sorrow was born I nursed it with care, and watched over it\n\nwith loving tenderness.\n\nAnd my Sorrow grew like all living things, strong and beautiful\n\nand full of wondrous delights.\n\nAnd a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.\n\nAnd he said:\n\nYour children are not your children.\n\nThey are the sons and daughters of Lifeâ€™s longing for itself.\n\nThen said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.\n\nAnd he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said:\n\nWhen love beckons to you, follow him,"
