        "text": "“Development” and “Evolution” tend, in this respect, to be interchangeable. As one map maker recently wrote (in a piece to which twitter serendipitously led me as I was in the middle of the first attempt at writing this short essay):\n\nAn unfortunate side effect is that all our maps start to look the same.\n\n…which can be great for communicating across cultures and regions and ideologies. It gets less great when we think about who gets to define mapping standards and why. Who gets to say what a map looks like? who gets to keep the gates? It also gets less great when we think about how we as humans thrive on—need—diversity and change. And less great again when we know that our development—our evolution—our ability to conceive of and perceive the world is shaped by the input we receive. By continually homogenising our view of the world we create an ever shrinking evolutionary spiral, ending up being unable to conceive of different maps. We limit our ways of describing and interpreting the world. (Steer 2020, emphasis added)\n\nA further element of unclarity is the assumption that cognitive maps (a metaphor, only ever a metaphor) and maps are intimately or even directly related; this is a key tenet of the individualist preconception of the ideal of cartography (Edney 2019, 64–73). In the passage just quoted, it is not entirely clear whether it is individuals, humanity, or maps that are changing/developing/evolving. But then, Steer’s purpose is to blur these categories: after all, his theme is, “we map because we are maps, we are maps because we map.”\n\nAs an academic, I try to be precise in my language, or at least consistent in my terminology. (Although I can’t say that I succeed! And terminology can be slippery, and usage can shift over time even in one’s own writing.) The issue is that when modern scholars write about evolution and development, they always draw on their biological meanings, whether explicitly or implicitly. It therefore behooves us to be precise in our usage:\n\nEvolution is the process whereby populations (of bacteria, fungi, plants, animals, etc.) change their characteristics over time.\n\nDevelopment is the process of change of an individual or of one thing (like landscape). In growing, maturing, and aging, individuals develop physically and cognitively, becoming more articulated and specialized. While development is necessarily directed by the individual’s complement of genes (nature), it is by no means so determined and is heavily shaped by external conditions (nurture).\n\n1.1. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829)\n\nThat plant and animal species evolve over time was recognized in the later eighteenth century, at the same time as the Biblical chronology of a six-thousand-year-old Creation was replaced by an understanding that the earth is perhaps even billions of years old. Early in the nineteenth century, the French botanist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed a mechanism for how evolution occurs. Central to his necessarily complex model was the idea of “the inheritance of acquired characteristics”: an organism adapts in order to live in a new or changed environment, and then passes that “acquired characteristic” onto its progeny, which inherit it. Note that Lamarckian evolution requires change to happen within individual organisms.\n\nLamarck could not suggest a precise motive force for evolution and, in line with the era’s Romanticism and the concept of Zeitgeist as the spirit that drives an age, argued that the whole biological system is driven by the “power of life” which causes the continual creation of filaments of life.\n\nLamarckian concepts of evolution are what gave credence to the climatic (or more generally physical) determinism that in turn gave intellectual cover for Western nationalism and imperialism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Early sociologists, notably Herbert Spencer, in particular sought a model to help explain the complexity of interactions within societies and saw an especially productive analogy with the biological organism. The model was productive in that modeling societies as organisms justified emergent ideas of the “nation,” as the expression of the unity of culture and society, and also seemed to explain scientific credence to the long-established religious, economic, and educational arguments that all cultures pass through predetermined stages by recasting the sequence in terms of “racial” capacities. This last application of Lamarckian models further undergirds the widely held but incorrect conviction that evolution somehow follows a guided or preordained trajectory toward some goal of perfection, driven by some motive power.\n\nThe adaptation of Lamarckian biological models to explain social function also led to what many people insist, mistakenly, in calling “Social Darwinism.” The underlying concepts of that idea were developed before Darwin ever published; it was, for example, Spencer who coined the phrase, “the survival of the fittest” in 1852.\n\n1.2. Charles Darwin (1809–82)\n\nCharles Darwin did not “invent” or “discover” the concept of evolution, as many people seem to believe, but proposed a novel mechanism to explain how change occurs in organisms: natural selection. His particular insight—and also Alfred Russell Wallace’s—was to shift the mechanism of evolutionary change from the individual to the population.\n\nRecognizing that individual members of a population vary in their particular characteristics, Darwin argued in On the Origin of Species (1859)—and later in the explicit context of humanity in The Descent of Man (1871)—that as environmental conditions have changed over long periods of time, so members of a population that possess certain characteristics that are beneficial in helping them live will be more likely to survive to pass on those characteristics. Over time, those beneficial characteristics will become more pronounced in a population, perhaps ubiquitous. Natural selection is probabilistic. The principle does not imply that an individual organism that lacks a beneficial characteristic will not survive to reproduce, only that it is less likely to do so.\n\nDarwin could offer no explanation of why variations should exist in the characteristics of individual members within a population. By the early twentieth century, biologists had identified DNA as the bearer of genetic information, and of course the post-war discovery of DNA’s double-helix form allowed for the identification of precise mechanisms of genetic change and mutation in individuals that work in ways that Darwin could never have imagined.\n\nThe biomolecular foundations of mutation and inheritance precludes the possibility that evolutionary change happens through changes within individuals. Much has been recently made of the idea that prolonged and intense biological stress can modify DNA, but such modifications seem not to persist for more than a few subsequent generations. Lamarck’s model of evolution is thoroughly discredited by biologists, together with all its implications and applications. Its analogical applications must also be discarded, if only for the seriously iniquitous practices they have sustained over the last 200 years.\n\nBiologists have advanced and debated other population-level mechanisms that can account for the preferential selection of characteristics within a population, notably altruism, but there remains general acceptance that natural selection is the dominant process. There is also nothing in population-level evolution that can be identified as a guiding force/spirit/ethos/motive. At the same time, there is nothing that says that only beneficial characteristics can be inherited, or that characteristics are necessarily the result of natural selection. There is, by definition, huge variation within any given population, sustained by constant mutations introduced through the process of reproduction; the relationship of the individual to the overall population remains statistical, not determined.\n\n1.3. Recapitulation\n\nSeveral biologists, most famously Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919), complicated matters no end by relating individual development to population evolution. At least in terms of the development of embryos, Haeckel argued that “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny”: the individual’s biological development (ontogeny) repeats or rehearses the same stages through which the parent population passed in its evolutionary development (phylogeny). This “recapitulation theory” relied heavily on Lamarckian principles but sought to apply them to Darwinian ideas of speciation. While refuted early (and often) within biology (Gould 1977), it has unfortunately had something of a tenacious hold in the humanities and social sciences. It seems to linger especially in cognitive development circles (follow the last link to the Wikipedia entry to see an example from 1994).\n\nThere has long been a recapitulationist edge to the ideal of cartography. Several of the ideal’s preconceptions suppose that each act of map making parallels or repeats the manner in which cartography as a whole had developed. The practice of drafting a map in manuscript before being printed, for example, is held to repeat the manner in which the manuscript reproduction of maps gave way to their print reproduction (Edney 2019, 26, 78, 93, 180). Recapitulationist suppositions have not ended with the rise of sociocultural map history. In particular, the equivalency commonly drawn between indigenous mapping in the present and preliterate mapping in the distant past (see below) has sustained a commitment to the individual’s expression of their internal, cognitive map as an external, sketch map as the “basic act of mapping—both the Ursprung of the cartographic endeavor and the impetus of each act of mapping” (Edney 2019, 71).\n\nI am automatically leery of the use of recapitulation theory because, while it sustains what seem to be profound arguments, it allows scholars to not actually address the mechanisms involved.\n\n2. Ideas of Cartographic Development\n\n2.1. Unilinear and Progressive Trend of Cultural and Cartographic Development\n\nBeginning in the early nineteenth century, even as the concept of “cartography” was formulated and increasingly accepted (Edney 2019, 114–20), the history of cartography was written in line with theories that every culture (like an individual) passes through a set sequence of developmental stages. These theories, in line with Lamarckian and Spencerian models, conflated the individual with the population, holding that social development was an expression of individual attainment. The making of maps indicated that a culture had attained a civilized state, and the nature of those maps positioned the culture on the ladder of civilization. (I address this topic in part in Edney 2020 and more thoroughly in the next book.)\n\nNarratives of the history of cartography within Western society structured that history as a series of stages through which each map-making culture passed. The stages were rungs on a single ladder of progress leading to the modern state of cartographic perfection. Here’s a schematic diagram that I developed for my 2011 presentation to the International Conference on the History of Cartography:\n\nMore important problems are as follows:\n\n• the model perpetuates the ideal’s individualistic preconception in its insistence that maps are direct expressions of the map maker’s own experience.\n\n• Wood based his model on evidence and theorizations that pertain solely to the detailed, fine resolution maps of place (topographical mapping) and has nothing empirical to say about other kinds of maps, such as marine, regional, world, or analytical maps.\n\n• Wood’s vision of “map” is as limited and partial as that of scholars who adhere to the normative conception of maps as factual statements about the world. In this respect Wood perpetuates the observational preconception of the ideal of cartography, that all maps are properly based on the observation and measurement of the world (Edney 2019, 76­–83).\n\n• like others who pursue sociocultural approaches to maps and mapping, Wood argues that “cartography” is a product of the European Renaissance, and that other cultures have made only maplike works. However, it is clear that the ideas of “map” as a singular category of image and of “cartography” as the endeavor of making such maps are the creation of post-1800 Western culture (Edney 2019).\n\n• Wood’s is an Anglocentric approach, in that it is based on the distinctiveness in the English language of “map”; it only has one other meaning, for “rabbit,” used only in northern English and Scots and of uncertain etymology (OED map, n.2). In other European languages, words that are translated as “map” are for more semantically complex. In French, for example, carte very much retains its original sense as “paper” and refers to a wide variety of things, of variously official nature, produced on paper, from restaurant menus, business cards, to manuscripts, to government decrees.\n\n• conversely, harking back to the idealization of “map” after 1800, there are other words widely used for different kinds of map, even in English: chart and plan.\n\n• Wood avoids the question: if maps evolve, what then is the mechanism of evolution? What’s the cartographic equivalent of DNA that is susceptible to variation? What is the mechanism by which certain variations become dominant? The model is thus descriptive rather than explanatory.\n\n• the model only makes the established metanarrative of the history of cartography more complex and does not do away with it; it maintains the Western-imposed artificial sequence of ancient to medieval (bypassing the Arabs!) to modern practices.\n\n• ultimately, Wood’s model does not challenge the idealization of cartography.\n\nThis argument revolves around the core of Wood’s position vis-à-vis defining maps and cartography and their history. For Wood, “the map” is specifically a graphic that possesses a sign plane in which the position of signs in that plane bears significance (i.e., denoting location; Wood and Fels 2008, xv–xvi). This is an absolute. It does nothing for Wood to consider a piece of landscape art as a map, nor a geological cross-section, nor an aerial photograph. This is the problem with Harley and Woodward’s (1987) definition: it’s just too broad, too encompassing. It might have been a valiant attempt to overcome the existing, narrow parochialism, but it went too far and was too catholic (compare with Andrews 2007).\n\n4. Defining the Scope of Map Studies\n\n4.1. Wood’s Absolute Delineation\n\nThere is a key implication for Wood’s strict position, which became clear in his review of Jordana Dym and Karl Offen’s Mapping Latin America (2011). Taking exception to the breadth of images discussed by contributors to that volume as a marker of the influence of Harley and Woodward, Wood let rip at the very conception of the edited volume:\n\nHarley and Woodward’s reactionary definition was ridiculously capacious, failing to distinguish a map—with its singular logic—from almost any other graphic—with their individual [different] logics—drawings, paintings, photos, diagrams, graphs; failing to distinguish a map from, say, one of William Playfair’s statistical graphs, from a watercolour by J. M. W. Turner (say, his Upper Falls of the Reichenbach), from one of those oil sketches by Willem de Kooning (Rosy Fingered Dawn at Louse Point), from one of Richard Misrach’s luminous ocean photographs, from a satellite photograph, or from one of Richard Diebenkorn’s paintings of Ocean Park.\n\nThis is throwing away the map to save it, ignoring its peculiar power to demonstrate its pervasiveness. It begs the very question, If it’s just a graphic text that can be analysed to reveal something about space, why then, in this book, so narrow a focus on so particular a subset as…the map? Why not a Latin American equivalent of Kivelson and Neuberger’s Picturing Russia: Explorations in Visual Culture? (Wood 2012, 137)\n\nThe issue is profound and at one time certainly troubled me. How does one legitimately delimit the field of map studies or, in my particular case, the field of map history if “map” is up in the air?\n\nAn adherent of Harley and Woodward’s definition, as I once was, faces a quandary: even as one pursues new and interesting studies, as per Harley and Woodward, one continues to define the limit of those studies—the limit of one’s field of study—by unacknowledged and unexamined concepts about “maps” and one runs the profound risk of simply perpetuating the long-established, narrow and restrictive range of things that were once privileged as maps. How does one delimit—de-fine—the field in an intellectually appropriate manner?\n\nWood’s solution is to insist on cartography’s ontological preconception, that what characterizes all maps, if they are to be maps, is the “singular logic” of their signification of location. Anything else is just another kind of graphic. By this standard, verbal maps are not maps. (They’re part of the cognitive mapping process, although expressed through the semiotic medium of language…but they do inform about location, perhaps through relative cues rather than the absolute system that Wood wants for locational signification.)\n\n4.2. Prototype Theory\n\nAnother solution is to use the prototype theory advanced by some linguists (esp. Lakoff 1987) to define “maps,” as has been done by some map scholars (Vasiliev et al. 1990; MacEachren 1995). This model suggests that there is a “prototype” conception that defines a noun, around which is a field of acceptable noun-ness. So, there’s some concept “map” against which one can compare an image, and if the image is “close enough” and falls within some threshold of map-ness, then it’s a map. If not, it’s not a map. Vasiliev et al. (1990) sought to clarify the elements that together constitute the prototype, although to my mind they only ended up reifying the modern idealization of the normative map: their test subjects identified map-ness according to how they had been taught to think of maps.\n\nI’m not sure if Lakoff’s prototype theory is still widely accepted among academic cartographers. But the theory does seem to model how sociocultural map scholars have intuitively modeled their understanding of “map” and “cartography” since the 1980s. That is, as they reject the normative restrictions placed on maps, they have effectively expanded the map/not-a-map threshold so that an ever greater conceptual region is included, yet still without wondering too much about the prototype. (I referred above to Wood’s definition of map as being absolute because it effectively constructs a threshold that is coincident with his prototype.)\n\nThis is also a situation facing other arenas of scholarship. Art history, in particular, has a long history of struggling to define “art” and therefore the field of “art history.” Art historians have wondered, for example, whether it makes sense to use the conception of “art” developed in the eighteenth century for all of human history (Shiner 2001). They have realized that the vast majority of images made in human history are informational in nature (including maps), so that “visual expressiveness, eloquence, and complexity are not the proprietary traits of fine art,” so what then becomes of art history (Elkins 1995, 553)? Indeed, in looking at the original emergence of “art” as the practice of making meaningful marks, an archaeologist understands art to have emerged from visual communication generally, in the second communication revolution within human evolution (after speech but before writing: Davidson 2020). In all these cases, disciplinary definitions are steadily expanded. I don’t know enough about art history to know if philosophical delimitations have expanded so far as to reach a breaking point, but they have for cartography.\n\n4.3. Map Studies are Delimited by Mapping Processes, not Maps\n\nWhen I still thought that “cartography” was a valid conception, rather than an idealization, like Wood I had a hard time with the idea of leaving such a fundamental point unexamined as the nature of maps. Cartography is defined as “map making,” so what is cartography if the prototypical map is uncertain? Harley and Woodward (1987) proposed an amorphous prototype; Woodward and Lewis (1998) made the prototype still more ineffable by including ephemeral forms of maps. What then is cartography? What would be included in a history of cartography, what not? Logically, one can be either catholic in one’s understanding, in which case one must own up to really engaging in “visual culture,” or one adopts a clear and unambiguous definition of map and delimit one’s studies accordingly. Wood is thus hostile towards scholars like Dym and Offen who he thinks want to have it both ways.\n\nWhat I have realized, as I continue to wrap my head around the fact that “map” and “cartography” are idealizations, is that this philosophical problem of ring-fencing and definition is not actually a problem. At least, it is only a problem when couched in terms of cartography, in terms of some big universal endeavor, and of map, as a graphic characterized by a particular, singular logic. Neither conception is historically valid. In getting past the hegemonic mindset of “cartography,” it is necessary instead to think in terms of mapping, as the (any) process of “representing spatial complexity,” and of map as any semiotic text “representing spatial complexity” (Edney 2019, 41). Maps are the epiphenomena of the processes by which spatial complexity is comprehended and communicated and utilized. In this respect, I see multiple kinds of maps made in different ways (not only graphic) to different ends and for different communities.\n\nOnly by conceptualizing the subject as broadly as possible, far more broadly than Harley and Woodward (1987) and as broadly as Woodward and Lewis (1998), is it possible to get beyond all the pesky problems that happen when one draws a boundary around a subject. Wood (with John Fels) distinguishes between map; perimap, which is to say all the material on the same surface as the map but lacking its propositional logic of denoting location; and epimap, which is to say all other the images and objects that conceptually surround the map and give it context. Perimap and epimap together constitute the paramap (Wood and Fels 2008, 8–12). The problem is that it is difficult (if not impossible) to establish the signification of a map (so defined) distinct from the perimap; the signification of maps bleed off the edge of the paper and into the surrounding book and into other semiotic texts. The boundaries, seemingly neat and orderly, dissolve.\n\nSuch uncertainty arises every time we construct a boundary around any intellectual construct. What is a work of art? (I appreciate Davidson 2020’s comparison of a mural by Banksy and a structurally similar advertisement; the former ceased being mere property-damaging graffiti and became art once Banksy was accepted as a creative genius, the latter will never be considered as art because of its overtly commercial and consciously designed nature.) What is a book? What is the discipline of geography, or history, or physics? What is literature? What is a university? What is a language? What is literacy? What is the USA (Immerwahr 2019)? And so on, and so on, ad nauseam.\n\nSo, three options:\n\n1) We can throw up our hands in disgust, and resort to the intuitive, prototype-theoretical practice, say, “I don’t know what X is, but I know it when I see it,” and then trust in our abilities to be as inclusive and as critical as possible.\n\n2) Or, we can construct precise definitions and then engage in lengthy battles to preserve the intellectual field we have thereby created, as Wood.\n\n3) Or, and this is the fundamental point of so much intellectual work about “social construction,” we accept that everything is messy because people behave in messy ways, and through their communal behavior constitute society itself.\n\nI recommend option 3. It is not enough to say that things are socially (politically|ideologically) defined, as if society somehow exists to shape and define things. Rather, it is by doing things, from living in and communicating about the world, in expressing ourselves through graphic imagery (and through words, and in sculpture, or video), that societies and cultures are made (Latour 2005).\n\nEverything is a process.\n\nArt is a process, or should it be “artification” to prevent the confusion offered by “art” as a thing (Shapiro 2019). (Maybe “arting”?)\n\nMapping is a process, a process of communicating and learning about the world, of producing, circulating, and consuming maps that inform about the world and its nature. Not only to locate things, although much mapping has that task, but to develop organizational schemas that are shared within particular communities.\n\nSo, yes, mapping is a social practice, maps are social constructions. That does not mean—just to head of the usual, tiresome criticism—that there is no objective truth and that everything is subjective. Such critique is, to me, an especially willful misunderstanding of such “constructivism.” The social construction of science does not deny that there are fundamental truths about the world (2+2=4; e=mc2) but that the entire apparatus of science is done by and for particular groups of humans, and that communally defined conventions govern scientific work, not just personal genius or insight. I, too, want maps to show me how to get from where I am to some other place I want to be, but I am not going to insist that because some things that are manifestly maps serve a navigational function, that all maps should have a navigational and factual essence. There are a multitude of maps, created and used within a multitude of communal contexts—not individual contexts—and the combination and overlapping of those precise contexts (call them spatial discourses) is what constitutes society as a whole, with all its social inequalities and power dynamics.\n\nI could go on at length, as I have before now (Edney 2019, chap. 2). And I will do so again, I am sure. But for now, let’s get back to the implications of all this for considering the nature of historical change in mapping and whether “development” and “evolution” are appropriate concepts.\n\n5. Evolution and Development in a Processual Approach to Mapping and Map History\n\nThe terms “develop” and “evolution” with their biological connotations have different meanings and implications according to the different understandings of mapping.\n\nFrom a normative perspective, traditional map historians have long argued that cartography develops in line with each culture: map making begins simple then gets ever more complex and sophisticated over time. It is, in fact, one of the key elements contributing to the normative concept of maps: if map making did not develop over time, then it is not really map making! (And only Western map making has developed over time, so only Western maps are really maps.)\n\nIf we discard the normative perspective, as scholars have tried to do since 1980 or so, then different options present themselves:\n\nFrom an absolutist and cognitive frame of reference, à la Wood, then we can say that maps evolve and moreover that they speciate, producing markedly different kinds of maps for different purposes, all of which nonetheless share a common mapness, and that the individual’s capacity for mapping (as a cognitive act) develops along with physical and cognitive capacity.\n\nFrom a relativistic and sociocultural frame of reference, à la Dym and Offen (and most other sociocultural map scholars), then … well, the terms develop and evolve are not banded about often, in large part because sociocultural map historians are not really interested in diachronic analysis. Sociocultural map studies tend to focus on particular maps in particular contexts and are overwhelmingly synchronic in their agendas.\n\nBut from a processual perspective, can we use develop and evolve in a meaningful way? That is, are their unavoidable and inevitable biological connotations permissible or do they entail incorrect or misleading assumptions?\n\nThe key to a processual map history is that mapping is undertaken within precise spatial discourses. The community of individuals who participate in a specific discourse—who produce, circulate, and consume texts in order to communicate and comprehend a very particular understanding of the world—can certainly change their practices, their conventions, and their constitution. In the case of the mapping of the urban place called Portland, Maine, for example, a very specific set of representational strategies emerged early in the nineteenth century that were later altered through the incorporation of nationalized engineering conventions and a broadening of the community involved to encompass trained engineers and commercial cartographers as far away as Philadelphia (Edney 2017). It is plain that this precise spatial discourse changed over time and indeed that it spawned new spatial discourses: the city map in the city directory persisted, but the mapping of the city as wall displays constituted a new discourse overlapping with the first yet nonetheless distinct in its participants and processes. Within a spatial discourse, I do not see the kind of increased articulation and specialization that merits an analogy with development.\n\nAs for evolution, that is perhaps a different manner. When I began this essay, I was thinking that change over time in mapping is not analogous to evolution. After all, what is the mechanism of selection? But as I’m writing this, I’m thinking about not only the small community in Portland that produced and consumed city maps in city directories, but also the fact that there were similar communities in other antebellum US cities (Boston, New York, Hartford, etc.). Can we think of this collection of spatial discourses, which I have tended to think as each unique unto itself, as actually comprising a population of spatial discourses that undergoes stress and variable selection? Even so, at this point, I’m still at a loss to identify the manner in which a population of spatial discourses reproduces itself. (What would the mapping equivalent be to “The Birds and the Bees”?)\n\nThe mechanisms of change in mapping occur within individual discourses. Each spatial discourse will change over time; my sense is that change is inevitable, but there is a potential for constancy that I can’t rule out yet. New spatial discourses emerge, undoubtedly others are disbanded. But they are not organisms. They don’t grow in size, gobbling up other discourses to survive. They don’t start simple, mature, and then decline into senescence. So, no, mapping does not evolve, nor does it develop.\n\nAll this is to say: analogies of development and, to some degree, evolution have undergirded the history of cartography, both normative and sociocultural. The analogies contribute to the persistent myth of “cartography.” They are among the many conceptual habits that map scholars must discard as a field if we are ever to get out of the rut of cartography.\n\ntl;dr – no one should use “develop” or “evolve” in their map historical studies in any way that might be interpreted as analogous to biological processes.\n\nReferences\n\nAndrews, J.
