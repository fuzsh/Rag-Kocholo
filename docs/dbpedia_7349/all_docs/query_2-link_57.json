        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n189 Chapter 7 The post-darwinian eye, physiological aesthetics, and the early years of aestheticism, 1860–1876 Barbara Larson Aestheticism came to public attention in 1877 with exhibitions at the prominent Grosvenor Gallery and the infamous Whistler trial the following year, and this formerly marginalized movement became popular among the cultural elite.1 While distinctly modern and even subversive in approach, the artists of aestheticism neither felt bound to subjects of the current period nor followed a unified style. They ranged from artists like James McNeill Whistler and his friend Albert Moore, who explored color harmonies, to Edward Burne-Jones, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Lord Frederic Leighton, who often used a warm, sensual palette to depict voluptuous, languorous female figures. They became known for their promotion of well-appointed decorative interiors that confirmed elite sensibilities, as well as for their love of spectacular aspects of the natural world such as peacock feathers and sunflowers, which were repeated to the point of becoming virtual symbols of the movement. Some of the artists of aestheticism were once part of the Pre-Raphaelite school, but now ventured away from the kinds of generally descriptive scenes and narrative art with which they had once been associated. Instead, they became engaged in considerations of the specifics of beauty (color and form) and in producing harmonious and indistinct scenes. The unifying 190 barbara larson credo of aestheticism was “art for art’s sake,” which seems to reject by its very declaration any adherence to the world, let alone science, but, as I argue here, aestheticism is actually close in principle to developments in psychology and physiology in the 1860s and early 1870s that were tied to evolutionism. This includes Darwin’s arguments about the function of the eye—its attentiveness to attractants (“beauty”) on the one hand and inability to grasp overall detail on the other, and it includes the current and influential idea promoted by Darwin supporter Herbert Spencer that art, though an eventual outcome of the evolutionary and physiological history of the body, indeed had no purpose other than itself. The Scientific Background of Aestheticism The field of psychology as it emerged in Great Britain in the 1850s was tied to the work of empirical philosophers engaged in mental studies like Alexander Bain, who emphasized the mind’s response to physiological processes.2 Grounded in the body, psychological response was directly tied to corporeal operations; even “spontaneous thought” had its basis in physiology. After the publication of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species (1859), physiological psychologists became attuned to Darwin’s ideas regarding holistic corporeal response to the environment and a fallible, limited, yet highly responsive eye, a perspective on sight and experience of the world that diverged from that upheld by contemporaneous natural theologians. When the new movement of aestheticism emerged in the 1860s, its characteristics included the foregrounding of sensory experience from the artist’s and viewer’s perspective that strongly suggests the influence of the physiological theories of Bain, Herbert Spencer, and Darwin. Spencer was one of the most influential of the psychologists on developing physiological aesthetics of the period. Like Bain, Spencer tied physiology to psychology in his Principles of Psychology, published in 1855, but followed Jean-Baptiste Lamarck on historical and linear evolutionism , believing the brain was layered with ancestral memories. After the publication of the On the Origin of Species, Spencer emerged as a Darwin supporter, but maintained certain Lamarckian applications of evolutionism as a teleological process, as opposed to Darwin’s undirected theory of natural selection (survival of the fittest). He began to issue his second expanded edition of Principles of Psychology by 1868, and then in complete text form in two volumes by 1872. In it he acknowledged that his original publication, steeped in “the Doctrine of Evolution,” was ridiculed by most in the mid-1850s, but in the last ten years, presumably since the publication of Origin, applications of evolutionary physiology to the mind were now taken seriously.3 In Principles of Psychology Spencer [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-17 19:32 GMT) 191 the post-darwinian eye, physiological aesthetics, and aestheticism demonstrated an interest in the evolutionary implications of aesthetics, adding an entire section in the second edition that directly addressed art.4 According to Spencer, art as practiced by the civilized was a pursuit uncoupled from issues of survival. Energy that had once been necessary for survival from an evolutionary and physiological perspective was now expended by neurological “effervescence..."
