        "text": "This paper investigates the development of social Darwinism in China from the mid-1890s to 1930 vis-à-vis its ties with social Darwinism in the West, employing a comparative analysis of Spencer, Huxley, and Yan Fu. A form of evolutionism that envisioned a cosmological order based upon strength was transformed into a component of power politics in Republican China, despite unsuccessful political endeavors that illustrated both the triumphs and social malfunctions of evolutionary ideas. From the late 1910s, a new variety of social Darwinism arose alongside the scientific one, reflecting the influence of Kropotkin and de Vries, as Chinese thinkers incorporated non-Anglophone texts. The theories that emerged made sense of the changing Chinese adaptations of evolutionary thinking by contextualizing and modifying them within the intellectual and political dynamics inside China and also in China’s evolving relationship with capitalism and imperialism.\n\n1 Hawkins, Mike, Social Darwinism in European and American Thought, 1860–1945: Nature as Model and Nature as Threat (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Richards, Robert J., Was Hitler a Darwinian?

In Korea, Spencer and Darwin were introduced during the 1880s. Huxley was also introduced, with attention being paid to his physiological works, such as: Huxley, Thomas H. and Youmans, William J., The Elements of Physiology and Hygiene: A Textbook for Educational Institutions (New York: D. Appleton & Co., 1884)Google Scholar. See Tikhonov, Social Darwinism, 25. Social Darwinism was introduced to Japan through a translation of Spencer’s works during the Meiji period.

In the Descent he certainly speaks favorably of known “materialists,” such as Vogt, Buchner. In one passage in Notebook C Darwin does call himself a materialist, but he generally did not.

The concept of “mutation” was clearly incorporated into the new synthesis, but at a micro, “gene level” as the source of evolutionary novelty.\n\n108 De Vries’s mutation theory included seven fundamental assumptions: new elementary species arise suddenly, without transitional forms (Hugo de Vries, Mutation Theory: Volume 1 [Chicago: Open Court Publishing, 1909], 248). New elementary species are, as a rule, absolutely constant from the moment that they arise (ibid., 249). Most of the new forms that have appeared are elementary species, and not varieties in the strict sense of the term (ibid., 251). New elementary species appear in large numbers at the same time or at any rate during the same period (ibid., 253). The new characteristics have nothing to do with individual variability (ibid., 254). The mutations, to which the origin of new elementary species is due, appear to be indefinite; that is to say, the changes may affect all organs and seem to take place in almost every conceivable direction (ibid., 255), and mutability appears periodically (ibid., 258)."
