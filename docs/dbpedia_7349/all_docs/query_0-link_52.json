Evolutionary figures who championed a variety of theories appealed to different religious traditions. As a result, no single pattern, whether it be harmony, integration , or least of all conflict, is comprehensive enough to capture the complexity of the global cultural engagement with evolution and religion in this period. Consider these examples of very different relations between religious and evolutionary doctrines in Argentina, Türkiye, and Japan. Three years after the publication of the Origin of Species (1859), an Argentinian lawyer named José Manuel Estrada (1842–1894), who was also a defender of Catholic thought, complained about those intellectuals in Buenos Aires who had been touting Jean-Baptiste Lamarck’s transformism. Estrada was a key figure during parliamentary discussions about secular education in the early 1880s. Although fifty years earlier Charles Darwin (1809–1882) traveled through Argentina while on the Beagle voyage, he was not the only evolutionist discussed in the controversies during the eighties. In fact, Darwin’s theory was understood through the evolutionary concepts of Herbert Spencer. But Spencer’s evolutionary theory diverged significantly from Darwin’s, particularly when it came to its implications for religion. In some regions of the world, Darwin was read 4 EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES AND RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS through the evolutionary perspective of other evolutionary figures in addition to Spencer. In fact, during the late nineteenth century, Muslim intellectuals in Ottoman Türkiye found Ernst Haeckel’s writings important in their attempts to build a broad worldview. Inspired by their reading of Haeckel, they created a connection between materialism and evolution that was compatible with their faith. This allowed the introduction of ideas of previous Islamic intellectuals , such as the twelfth-century scholar, mystic, and philosopher Ibn ʿArabî (1165–1240). But neither Haeckel nor materialism appealed to Japanese intellectuals with a commitment to Buddhism. In the beginning of the twentieth century, members of Jinsei gakkai (the Society for Studies of Humanity), an academic society in Japan, organized a conference at the University of Tokyo to mark the momentous occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the Origin. The lead organizer, Fujikawa Yū (1865–1940), a medical doctor and polymath, was the driving force behind a new publication that focused on the scientific understanding of humankind, the journal Jinsei. Fujikawa was an adherent of Jōdo Shinshū (the True School of Pure Land). His commitment to Buddhism was not apparent at the conference, nor did he see any conflict between his faith in Buddhism and evolutionary theory. In this volume our goal is to explore how intellectuals and the public around the world viewed the relationship between science and religion from about 1800 to about 1920. We have attempted to provide a broad range of national and transnational perspectives. This goal has taken us to Britain, Spain, and the United States but also to New Zealand, Australia, India, Egypt, Argentina, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, and the Ottoman Empire. While various European countries and the United States of America receive some attention , our emphasis is on other parts of the world that are underexamined in modern histories of evolution and religion developed in the United Kingdom and North America. Some chapters deal with a single country or geographic region, while others take a transnational viewpoint. We have examined a variety of religious traditions, including Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Islam, as well as the intersection of multiple religious traditions . We have drawn attention not only to European scientists other than Darwin who played a significant role in the dissemination of evolutionary ideas but also to the central figures in national contexts who appropriated scientific theories for their own purposes. Many of these central figures were not scientists. They were missionaries, religious figures, journalists, cartoonists , indigenous leaders, novelists, popularizers of science, educators, and politicians . It is important to note that some religious figures were discussing and incorporating evolutionary theory into their thought well before Darwin came on the scene. Although many chapters focus on evolution across the life sciences, others examine the closely connected themes of social evolution [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-17 19:31 GMT) 5 INTRODUCTION and human origins. Disputes about the validity of evolutionary theories and their implications for religion are further situated within interconnected debates about colonialism, imperialism, racism, orientalism, secularization, materialism, and education. Even cultural historians who are not..."
