        "text": "Universal Darwinism\n\nAKA\n\nDarwinian Metaphysics\n\nGeneralized Darwinism\n\nUniversal Selection Theory\n\nWestern Mysticism- & Religion-Aligned Discourses, while diverse and varied, tend to embrace and perpetuate some rather specific beliefs about learning and teaching. In particular, there is a pervasive assumption that all truth is pre-existent and present out in the universe – resident in an ideal realm, or in a creator’s mind, inscribed in material forms, and so on.\n\nLearn More...\n\nGroup Development Theories comprise a host of models and perspectives intended to interpret the evolution of task-oriented collectives. Prominent foci of the many different theories include sequences of development-based stages, clusters of purpose-based phrases, typologies of conflict-focused dynamics, and cycles of evolutionary transformation.\n\nLearn More...\n\nEco-Complexity Discourses is a sub-category of Coherence Discourses. It is an umbrella term that reaches across perspectives on learning that refuse separations of human from nature, material from transcendent, and part from whole. Across Eco-Complexity Discourses, learning is understood as synonymous with evolution.\n\nLearn More...\n\nWithin Developmental Discourses, learning is understood as a recursively elaborative process rather than a linear accumulative one. Most Developmental Discourses focus on how learners’ key habits of perception and interpretation change amid predictable sequences of biological, psychological, and emotional transformation.\n\nLearn More...\n\nComplex Systems Research focuses on systems comprising sets of agents that form unified wholes in their interactions, relationships, or dependencies. Their emergent, global behaviors cannot be predicted on the basis of the rules governing the individual agents. Definitions and descriptions of complex systems revolve around such terms as emergent, adaptive, nonlinear, irreducible, noncompressible, non-decomposable, multi-level, self-organizing, context-sensitive, and adaptive.\n\nLearn More...\n\nDual Inheritance Theory aims to explain human activity in terms of two intertwined processes: biological evolution and cultural evolution. Concisely, changes at the genetic level can influence culture, and changes in culture can influence genetic selection.\n\nLearn More...\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a domain of computer science focused on devices that are able to take some level of agency in achieving novel goals. Beyond that detail, the scope of AI is disputed, in part because “novel goals” is a moving target … as once-unimaginable feats become routine. Commonly mentioned aspects include abilities to collect relevant information about the environment, draw inferences based on that information, and apply those inferences flexibly.\n\nLearn More...\n\nGenetic Epistemology is a theory of the genesis/origins of knowing/epistemology, in which learning is framed as an adaptive process in which the principal criteria of personal truth are coherence among elements of understanding and their utility for making sense of one’s own experience, not match between internal, subjective interpretations and external, objective reality. Cognitive Developmentalism is a key element of Genetic Epistemology.\n\nLearn More...\n\nCoherence Discourses regard distinctions and descriptions as useful devices to make sense of the complex dynamics of learning, but they caution that such devices are mere heuristic conveniences. Coherence Discourses suggest that truths do not exist independently or outside of a system – which is a commentary on humans’ understanding of reality, not a commentary on reality. Most Coherence Discourses employ biological and ecological metaphors, with dynamics framed in evolutionary terms.\n\nLearn More...\n\nCognitive Robotics is concerned with creating robots that are able to learn and reason in order to act effectively in situations involving complex goals and/or problem solving. It explicitly rejects strategies based on symbolic representations of the world. Rather, it situates ambulatory, sensing robots in the physical world and equips them with strategies to learn to act as they work toward meeting assigned goals.\n\nLearn More...\n\nLearning Transfer refers to instances of applying what is learned in one setting/task to an identifiably different setting/task. The extent to which it happens depends on such factors as the similarity of the situations, the motivations of the learner, mastery of the content, and prompts and interpretive assistance from a knowledgeable other. Various taxonomies (of types of transfer) and strategies (to encourage transfer) have been developed.\n\nLearn More...\n\nCultural Learning studies and describes that ways that people or non-human animals develop and perpetuate their collective knowledge.\n\nLearn More...\n\nAuthors of the Gaia Hypothesis propose that the interactions of living organisms and their inorganic environments on Earth form a complex (emergent, self-regulating, evolving) system. Importantly, “Gaia” is not seen as an organism, but the system of “organic co-evolving with/in inorganic” – and that system is posited to maintain the conditions for life.\n\nLearn More...\n\nTranshumanism addresses the development, use, and distribution of technologies to enhance intellect and physiology. Oriented by a belief that eventual benefits will outweigh current health, social, ethical, and other issues and dangers, most proponents of Transhumanism envision a future in which possibility is so greatly increased by directed evolution (vs. natural evolution) that humans will become fundamentally different sorts of beings.\n\nLearn More...\n\nEpistemology encompasses all discourses concerned with what knowledge is, its scope and limits, and how it is generated, validated, enacted, and maintained.\n\nLearn More...\n\nThe study of mind and behavior.\n\nLearn More...\n\nEnactivism positions the knower as an integral and active aspect of grander dynamical systems. That is, the knower is coupled with other knowers and affects while being affected by systems that include the more-than-human environment. Enaction is seen as a process in which a perceiving knower acts creatively to meet the requirements of a situation. Enaction is thus about systemic transformation rather than processing of information.\n\nLearn More...\n\nHumanisms encompass a range of perspectives that reject any system of belief that relies on spirits, deities, or other mystical forces as sources or arbiters of truth. Humanisms assert that humans can and must generate insight for themselves. The sensibility dates back millennia, but its most powerful articulations have been relatively recent, starting with the Enlightenment and the associated rises of Empiricism and Rationalism.\n\nLearn More...\n\nThe study of human society\n\nLearn More...\n\nMindset is focused on the relationship between learners’ conceptions of themselves and their attitudes toward learning. It distinguishes between two types of mindset, fixed and growth. Learners with a fixed mindset typically see ability as fixed and learning in terms of a performance that reflects that ability. Learners with a growth mindset typically see ability in more expansive terms, defined at least in part by the effort put forth.\n\nLearn More...\n\nFocus\n\nAdaptive dynamics by which systems maintain viability\n\nPrincipal Metaphors\n\nKnowledge is … vibrant, viable complex forms/systems\n\nKnowing is … surviving\n\nLearner is … a vibrant, adaptive phenomenon\n\nLearning is … adapting; viability-maintaining\n\nTeaching is … occasioning; co-evolving\n\nOriginated\n\n1950s\n\nSynopsis\n\nUniversal Darwinism encompasses every extension of Charles Darwin’s theory of “descent with modification” beyond its original application to biological organisms. This theory is most often identified as a theory of “evolution”:\n\nEvolution (1620s) – any process by which an organic form changes in response to situational conditions. The notion is based on the metaphor of “an opening of what was rolled up” (i.e., a scroll or book), and it was originally used in medicine and mathematics. It was first used to refer to living forms in the 1660s to describe the growth and development of individual organisms. The metaphor was extended to geological forms in the 1830s and to biological species in the last half of the 1800s. (Charles Darwin used the word only once in his writings, having preferred the phrase “descent with modification.”) Associated processes include:\n\nOntogenesis (Ontogeny) – the organic growth of an organism – that is, the biological events that unfold as an organism develops and matures\n\nPhylogenesis (Phylogeny) – the evolutionary unfolding of a species. Phylogenesis is often coupled with and contrasted to Ontogenesis.\n\nUniversal Darwinism is motivated by the conviction that the dynamics identified by Darwin, of variation, selection, and retention, can be applied to other patterns, phenomena, and systems – such as those studied in Psychology, Sociology, medicine, computer science, and geology. Within education, virtually all Coherence Discourses invoke evolutionary dynamics. Some, such as Enactivism and Complex Systems Research, assert that “learning” and “biological evolution” are instances of the same phenomenon, merely applied at different levels of organization. That is, “systemic learning,” “systemic adaptation,” and “systemic evolution” can be understood as synonyms. Illustrative constructs include:\n\nCross-Adaptation – a type of physiological Learning Transfer by which a learning/adaptation developed to respond to one set of environmental stressors is applied with positive effect in a novel (and, often, very different) situation\n\nCross-Enhancement – the use of one stimulus to prompt an amplification of one’s ability to perceive multiple and fine-grained qualities of a quite-different stimulus\n\nEpigenetics – the study of changes that can affect gene expression – that is, inheritance – that don’t involve changes to DNA sequence. The matter rose to interest among educators in the 2000s, especially around the notion of Mindset, in the realization that over-deterministic interpretations of “genetics” (as pertaining to learner traits and potentials) were at play in the field. Associated constructs include:\n\nEpigenetic Landscape (Conrad Hall Waddington, 1960s) – a visual metaphor in which development is likened to the motions of balls down a slope with many troughs, intended to illustrate the notion that differentiations during development are influenced by both genetics and experience\n\nEvolvability – a descriptive term, referring to the extent to which a system can evolve. Evolvability was originally applied to biological systems – that is, to the extent to which a species capacity to generate adaptive diversity might be incorporated in its genome. More recently, the notion has been extended to applications such as Evolutionary Robotics(see above) – that is, the extent to which systems might be designed to adapt continuously and creatively to changing circumstances and mounting complexity.\n\nEvolved Psychological Mechanism – a psychological adaptation that evolved to meet a specific need or serve a specific purpose. More colloquially, an Evolved Psychological Mechanism is a learning that happens at the level of the species and that is “remembered” genetically.\n\nExaptation (Co-Option) (Stephen J. Gould, 1980s) – the extension or hijacking of an evolved function for another purpose. For example, the human larynx is theorized to have evolved to enhance capacities to call and to warn, and it was later co-opted for speech.\n\nPhase Space – the collective of all possible happenings/unfoldings/outcomes/actions of a system. If that system is a living, learning, evolving form and/or if the system occupies an evolving context, its Phase Space will also be an evolving form. That is, as the system and/or is situation learns/evolves, its horizon of possibility shifts.\n\nPhysiological Adaptation – any intracellular, biochemical, and/or metabolic shifts in an organism’s body that enables it to exist more effectively in an environment. More colloquially, a Physiological Adaptation is a learning that is “remembered” in one’s physical structure.\n\nPsychological Adaptation – a cognitive or behavioral shift/adaptation that enables an organism to exist more effectively in an environment\n\nSensory Adaptation (Neural Adaptation) – a decreased sensitivity to a stimulus, due principally to frequent or constant exposure to it\n\nImportantly, there are conflicting perspectives on the core dynamics of evolution. Natural Selection and Survival of the Fittest are most commonly invoked, but Natural Drift and Survival of the Fit have more recently emerged as perhaps better descriptions of biological evolution and almost certainly more applicable within discussions of “learning as evolution” (that is, among Coherence Discourses):\n\nDarwinism (Charles Darwin, 1850s) – mechanisms proposed by Darwin for the transformation of forms over time (including the evolutions as species, meanings, and customs) and increases in diversity and complexity (e.g., within an ecosystem, social collective, or culture). It is important to note that, although Darwinian or evolutionary processes are often assumed to be directional (e.g., from lower to higher, simpler to more complex, or worse to better), Darwin’s theory did not propose a direction, merely mechanisms for transformation and diversification.\n\nLamarckism (Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics; Use-and-Disuse Theory) (Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, 1790s) – a perspective on evolution founded on the suggestion that offspring can inherit traits that its parents developed (through use or disuse) during their lifetimes. While once wholly rejected, recent research in Epigenetics (see above) have demonstrated some merit to Lamarkism.\n\nNatural Selection and Survival of the Fittest\n\nNatural Selection (Charles Darwin, 1850s) –the collection of processes that determine whether organisms/species survive or are eliminated (e.g., disease, predators, etc.). In Darwinian evolution, Natural Selection is seen as the principal dynamic in the emergence and extinction of species.\n\nSurvival of the Fittest (Herbert Spencer, 1860s) – the suggestion that those organisms/species that are better adapted to a specific environment will be more successful than competitors at surviving and reproducing\n\nNatural Drift and Survival of the Fit\n\nNatural Drift (Francisco Varela, 1980s) – a rejection of the suggestion that evolution has a “trajectory” or “direction,” in the sense of moving from less-complicated to more-complicated forms. Natural Drift suggests that evolution is a constant unfolding of novel possibility.\n\nSurvival of the Fit (Francisco Varela, 1980s, who attributed it to Charles Darwin) – the suggest that “adequacy” rather than “optimality” is the necessary quality for survival of an organism/species. That is, the suggestion that evolution is more a matter of emergent possibility rooted in complex co-activity than linear progress based on competition.\n\nMany discourses have emerged that claim to embrace evolutionary dynamics, but that assume ends-driven dynamics and/or interventions by divine agents. Examples include:\n\nIntelligent Design (Nick Matzke, 1980s) – an attempt to explain life and other features of the universe by appealing to a higher power that created natural laws, oversees evolution, and intervenes miraculously\n\nOrthogenesis (Evolutionary Progress; Orthogenetic Evolution; Progressionism; Progressive Evolution) – a version of evolutionary theory based on the assumption that organisms are innately driven to evolve in a predetermined direction\n\nTheistic Evolution (Evolutionary Creationism; God-Guided Evolution) – a version of evolutionary theory based on the assumption that a god created the laws of nature, which in turn drive evolution according to a predetermined purpose (See Theism, under Mysticism- & Religion-Aligned Discourses.)\n\nSuch discourses are deprecatingly described as “teleological,” whereas Universal Darwinism is “teleonomic”:\n\nTeleology – the belief that natural evolutionary processes are purpose-driven or goal-directed. The word is derived from the Greek telos- “end, goal, purpose” + -logia “speak, tell.”\n\nTeleonomy (Colin Pittendrigh, 1950s) – the recognition that natural evolutionary processes can appear to be (but are not) purpose-driven or goal-directed. The word is derived from the Greek telos- “end, goal, purpose” + nomos “law.”\n\nSome specific examples of Universal Darwinism relevant education include the following:\n\nEvolutionary Developmental Biology (Evo-Devo) – a branch of biology focused on the emergence (i.e., the evolutionary history) of the developmental processes of different species\n\nEvolutionary Developmental Psychology (David Bjorklund, 2000s) – applying evolutionary principles to understand genetic and environmental mechanisms involved in the development of cognitive and social competencies\n\nEvolutionary Educational Psychology – the study of how people are affected by and how they manage gaps between folk knowledge and academic knowledge\n\nEvolutionary Psychology – applying evolutionary principles in the study of human behavior and cognition, concerned largely with adaptations that arise when one deals with evolving circumstances and new intellectual challenges\n\nIdeal Theory vs. Non-Ideal Theory (John Rawls, 1990s) – a contrast proposed to describe the evolution of practical theories, suggesting that one starts with an Ideal Theory (e.g., involving universal compliance with principles and/or oriented to a utopian endstate) that serves as a precursor to a Non-Ideal Theory (e.g., involving partial compliance with principles and/or embracing an always-evolving horizon)\n\nNeural Darwinism (Neuronal Group Selection; Selectionist Brain Theory) (Gerald Edelman, 1980s) – an evolution-based account of brain development that uses Darwinian dynamics to make sense of the growth, interactions,signaling, and linkings of synapses, neurons, neuronal clusters, etc.\n\nPaleopsychology – the speculative examination of psychological processes currently manifested by humans that are thought to have emerged in earlier stages of human or pre-human evolution\n\nPopulation Learning – Based on the principle that “evolution is learning that occurs at the level of the species,” Population Learning refers to those processes by which a species (or co-entangled group of species, or population of organisms) learns/evolves genetically through iterative processes of reproduction and selection.\n\nPunctuated Equilibrium (Stephen J. Gould, 1980s) – originally, a model of biological evolution that cast the process in terms of occasional periods of rapid change rather than a continuous process of minor changes. The notion has been picked up by some psychologists and educators, especially those who align strongly with Developmental Discourses, to characterize individuals’ and groups’ shifts in knowing and consciousness (see, e.g., Gersick's Punctuated Equilibrium Model, under Group Development Theories.)\n\nOther instances and applications of Universal Darwinism can be found under the following entries:\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nCognitive Robotics\n\nCultural Learning\n\nDual Inheritance Theory\n\nEpistemology\n\nGaia Hypothesis\n\nHumanisms\n\nTranshumanism\n\nCommentary\n\nMost criticisms of Universal Darwinism come from outside of scientific domains, and they typically boil down to a rejection of evolutionary theory – usually because this robust scientific theory is incompatible with particular religious convictions or disruptive of desires for a stable and fully explainable reality. Some criticisms reach back to misinterpretations and misapplications of Darwinism (e.g., Social Darwinism, used to justify social inequality a century ago). Still other criticisms are articulated as worries of over-enthusiastic and under-justified extensions of a biology-based theory onto non-biological domains. Curiously few criticisms seem to be associated with an awareness that evolutionary theorizing about psychological, social, and cultural phenomena preceded Darwin. Specific examples if misinterpretation and misapplication of Darwinism include:\n\nPolitical Genetics – an umbrella category that reaches across perspectives that purport to translate the physical sciences of genetics and evolution into social and political theories. Examples include:\n\nBeyondism (Raymond Cattell, 1980s) – an attempt to derive a “religion from science,” founded on the premise that evolutionary competition, if unhindered, will solve the world’s problems – acknowledging that some civilizations will thrive and others will perish in the process\n\nEugenics (Ectogenesis) (Francis Galton, 1880s) – a social and political perspective aimed at ridding humanity of genetic defects through selective breeding of those with deemed-to-be-superior traits and preventing reproduction of those with deemed-to-be-undesirable traits\n\nSocial Darwinism (Herbert Spencer, 1800s) – a social theory structured around the principle of “survival of the fittest,” by which evolutionary advancement was assumed to unfold through those judged as superior – on the basis, e.g., of class, wealth, and race\n\nAuthors and/or Prominent Influences\n\nCharles Darwin; Richard Dawkins\n\nStatus as a Theory of Learning\n\nUniversal Darwinism is can be readily interpreted as a theory of learning if “systemic learning” and “systemic evolution” are interpreted as synonyms. Through the robust scientific offerings of such offerings as Genetic Epistemology and Enactivism – as well as the fact that evolutionary dynamics are assumed in all Eco-Complexity Discourses – there are grounds to assert that Universal Darwinism is a theory that reaches across all learning phenomena.\n\nStatus as a Theory of Teaching\n\nUniversal Darwinism is not in any way a theory of teaching.\n\nStatus as a Scientific Theory\n\nThe scientific theory of evolution is one of the most robustly argued and thoroughly researched subdomains in modern science. Many of the extrapolations of evolutionary dynamics onto other phenomena cannot claim the same rigor. For most of the theories of learning associated with Universal Darwinism, there is substantial, phenomenon-specific evidence.\n\nSubdiscourses:\n\nBeyondism\n\nBiocultural Evolution\n\nCross-Adaptation\n\nCross-Enhancement\n\nDarwinism\n\nEpigenetic Landscape\n\nEpigenetics\n\nEugenics (Ectogenesis)\n\nEvolution\n\nEvolutionary Developmental Biology (Evo-Devo)\n\nEvolutionary Developmental Psychology\n\nEvolutionary Educational Psychology\n\nEvolutionary Psychology\n\nEvolvability\n\nEvolved Psychological Mechanism\n\nExaptation (Co-Option)\n\nIdeal Theory vs. Non-Ideal Theory\n\nIntelligent Design\n\nLamarckism (Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics; Use-and-Disuse Theory)\n\nNatural Drift\n\nNatural Selection\n\nNeural Darwinism (Neuronal Group Selection; Selectionist Brain Theory)\n\nOntogenesis (Ontogeny)\n\nOrthogenesis (Evolutionary Progress; Orthogenetic Evoluution; Progressionism; Progressive Evolution)\n\nPaleopsychology\n\nPhase Space\n\nPhylogenesis (Phylogeny)\n\nPhysiological Adaptation\n\nPolitical Genetics\n\nPopulation Learning\n\nPsychological Adaptation\n\nPunctuated Equilibrium\n\nSensory Adaptation (Neural Adaptation)\n\nSocial Darwinism\n\nSurvival of the Fit\n\nSurvival of the Fittest\n\nTeleology\n\nTeleonomy\n\nTheistic Evolution (Evolutionary Creationism; God-Guided Evolution)\n\nMap Location\n\nPlease cite this article as:\n\nDavis, B., & Francis, K.
