        "meta_description": "All living beings on Earth, from bacteria to humans, are connected through descent from common ancestors and represent the summation of their corresponding, ca. 3500 million year long evolutionary history. However, the evolution of phenotypic features is not predictable, and biologists no longer use terms such as \"primitive\" or \"perfect organisms\". Despite these insights, the Bible-based concept of the so-called \"ladder of life\" or Scala Naturae, i.e., the idea that all living beings can be viewed as representing various degrees of \"perfection\", with humans at the very top of this biological hierarchy, was popular among naturalists until ca. 1850 (Charles Bonnet, Jean Lamarck and others). Charles Darwin is usually credited with the establishment of a branched evolutionary \"Tree of Life\". This insight of 1859 was based on his now firmly corroborated proposals of common ancestry and natural selection. In this article I argue that Darwin was still influenced by \"ladder thinking\", a theological view that prevailed throughout the 19th century and is also part of Ernst Haeckel's famous Oak tree (of Life) of 1866, which is, like Darwin's scheme, static. In 1910, Constantin Mereschkowsky proposed an alternative, \"anti-selectionist\" concept of biological evolution, which became known as the symbiogenesis-theory. According to the symbiogenesis-scenario, eukaryotic cells evolved on a static Earth from archaic prokaryotes via the fusion and subsequent cooperation of certain microbes. In 1929, Alfred Wegener published his theory of continental drift, which was later corroborated, modified and extended. The resulting theory of plate tectonics is now the principal organizing concept of geology. Over millions of years, plate tectonics and hence the \"dynamic Earth\" has caused destructive volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. At the same time, it created mountain ranges, deep oceans, novel freshwater habitats, and deserts. As a result, these geologic processes destroyed numerous populations of organisms, and produced the environmental conditions for new species of animals, plants and microbes to adapt and evolve. In this article I propose a tree-like \"symbiogenesis, natural selection, and dynamic Earth (synade)-model\" of macroevolution that is based on these novel facts and data.

        "text": "Four decades ago, J. C. Maxwell summarized the concept of the dynamic Earth in the following words: \"The earth's surface, in the context of geologic time, may be likened to a boiling vat of maple syrup. The crust, with its high-standing continents, is analogous to the scum which rises from boiling syrup, coalesces, drifts apart, and rejoins in different patterns on the surface of the convecting liquid. The earth's crust is a similarly thin scum of relatively light rocks 'floating' on the mantle, a zone of heavier materials extending halfway to the earth's center and overlying the inner metallic core. By some cosmic accident the earth has been endowed with a magnetic field, apparently for much of its 4.5-billion-year history. Changes in the field with respect to a point on the surface are recorded by successively formed sequences of rock. Analysis of these ancient magnetic fields gives convincing evidence of extensive differential movements in the earth's crust. The composition of the crust and the forces which cause its deformation are apparently determined by gravitational and thermal instabilities within the outer few hundred kilometers of the mantle. Temperature within the earth increases downward at a rate exceeding the adiabatic gradient for the upper few hundred kilometers, hence this outer zone is intrinsically unstable. Vertical movements, once initiated, tend to be self-propagating. These instabilities may give rise to lateral and vertical movements approximating convecting currents in liquids. Rising currents have apparently occurred largely in oceanic areas, bringing new mantle material to the surface in the oceans and sweeping older oceanic rocks towards and perhaps beneath the high-standing continents. The great mountain ranges which border many continents are believed to be related in some way to the convective overturn of rocks in the earth's crust and upper mantle\" [57]. This description, published in 1971, was a concise summary of a long series of articles and books that originated in 1858.\n\nIn this year, the French geographer Antonio Snider-Pellegrini (1802-1885) published two imaginative maps depicting the continents of the Earth, \"before and after separation\" [58]. This early outline of the idea of continental drift, and hence the dynamic Earth (Figure 8 A), did not convince the geologists of the time, because Snider-Pellegrini's speculations were largely based on Biblical myths and only on few scattered empirical data. As a result, the old concept of a static Earth, the \"geological basis\" of all views of the \"hierarchy and organization of life on our planet\", as depicted in ladders and trees, from Charles Bonnet's Scala via Darwin's Diagram to Ernst Haeckel's Oak, prevailed (Figures 1 to 6).\n\nSeven decades after Snider-Pellegrini's account was published, the last (definitive) edition of Alfred Wegener's (1880-1930) book on The Origin of the Continents and the Oceans [59] appeared in print. In this monograph of 1929, the German scientist summarized a long list of empirical evidence for a novel fact-based theory of continental drift that overshadowed the earlier, Bible-inspired speculations of the French geographer. In essence, Wegener stated that the isolated continents as we observe them today were once united and formed a super-continent. This giant proto-land mass (\"Pangaea\") may have covered up to 50% of the surface of our planet and was surrounded by one large ocean (\"Panthalassa\"). Due to \"continental drift\" via mechanisms inexplicable to Wegener, the land masses finally reached, in the course of millions of years of steady motion, the position they have today. Despite Wegener's inability to explain the physical processes that may have caused the drift of these large land masses, the author proposed that the formation of mountains, via compressive forces, the occurrence of earthquakes, and volcanism are consequences of continental drift [59]. Today it is well established that Wegener was right (Figures 8 B, C; 9).\n\nOnly a few years before J. C. Maxwell published his summary of the \"Dynamic Earth\" quoted above, the concept of plate tectonics was proposed. This unifying theory of geology states that the Earth's outer rigid shell (i.e., the lithosphere) is broken into more than a dozen giant, rigid plates that float on the hot, ducile mantle (i.e., the asthenosphere) like pieces of ice on a lake. Most of the Earth's documented history results from plates rifting into pieces to form new ocean basins. When they converge back together, they can form mountains and large continents (Figure 8 C). As shown in Figure 9, the rigid lithospheric plates differ in size and their direction of internal heat-driven motion. Some pieces of the outer crust, such as the North American Plate, carry continents and attached pieces of the ocean floor. Other parts of the lithosphere, such as the Pacific Plate, are entirely covered by oceans and are made of oceanic crust. For instance, in the area of San Francisco (California) and elsewhere, the North American and Pacific Plates are pushed at each other, and the spontaneous release of pressure causes abrupt, short plate movements, so-called \"earthquakes\" (Figure 8 B). These rapid, unpredictable geologic events may have devastating secondary effects. For instance, the 2011 Sendai 9.0 megathrust earthquake that occurred on March 11 off the coast of Japan triggered destructive tsunami waves with highs of up to 12 m. These masses of sea water have travelled up to 10 km inland, destroyed the terrestrial landscape, and caused thousands of deaths. Frequently, such devastating earthquakes occur along the so-called \"Pacific Ring of Fire\", stretching from New Zealand, along the eastern edge of Asia north across the Aleutian Islands of Alaska and south along the coast of North and South America. The \"Ring of Fire\", which has 452 volcanoes, is a direct consequence of plate tectonics and hence the movements/collisions of crustal plates [60].\n\nWhat is the significance of the theory of plate tectonics for the geological sciences? Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975) once said that \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\" [61]. Accordingly, earth scientists may conclude that \"Not much in geology makes sense except in the light of plate tectonics\". In other words, the theory of plate tectonics is the unifying principle of historical geology.\n\nThe consequences of the internal heat-driven movements of tectonic plates for the evolution of life on Earth, as well as the \"Tree-models\" depicting this process, are obvious: new habitats are created and existing ones are re-modelled or destroyed by these geologic events (Figure 7). Major mass extinctions, such as those that occurred 251 and 65 million years ago, respectively, were at least in part caused by massive volcanic eruptions and hence the dynamic Earth [54, 60].\n\nIn a recent publication it was documented that the break-up of the super-continent Pangaea (which existed from the Perminan into the Jurassic, ca. 299 to 200 million years ago), due to plate tectonics, accounts for the evolutionary diversification of many groups of animal, such as dinosaurs, mammals and the land leeches of Madagascar [62]. Another example for the role of plate tectonics as driving force for speciation are amphibious tetrapods, such as salamanders. A detailed analysis of numerous collected specimens of the four-toed Asian salamanders (family Hynobiidae) revealed that the 46 biospecies were \"created\" as a result of plate tectonics. About 110 million years ago, much of Asia was a low-lying humid region where salamanders of all varieties existed. A series of geologic events, which resulted in the lifting up of the Tibetan Plateau and mountain-building led to the isolation of sub-populations that evolved, over millions of years, into separate, geographically isolated species [63]. Hence, the dynamic Earth must be interpreted as a major factor that drove the evolutionary diversification of many macro-organisms on our planet [64, 65] (Figures 8, 9). It should be mentioned that wildfires, which have a large impact on the distribution and diversification of plants and animals, are regularly caused by massive volcanic eruptions (Figures 10, 11). These secondary consequences of plate tectonics may also have been an important cause for the extinction of the dinosaurs that occurred 65 million years ago [54, 61, 66].\n\nFinally, we have to address the question as to the consequences of volcanism (and the associated wildfires) on the evolutionary patterns of micro-organisms, such as bacteria, soil amoebae and unicellular algae (diatoms etc.) [67]. One case study may illustrate this topic. The eruption of Mount St. Helens in southwest Washington, USA, on May 18, 1980 released superheated steam and gases. Moreover, this catastrophic event resulted in pyroclastic flows, landslides, mudflows, and ash fall. As a result, novel habitats were formed, whereas old ones were re-structured, scoured, or eliminated [68]. Six years after the eruption, some aquatic habitats were analyzed with respect to the presence of micro-organisms. The results show that species richness and microbial diversity were very low at the most heavily disturbed sites around the cool volcano, documenting a large mass extinction event at the \"micro-scale\" [69]. However, more work on other volcanic sites is necessary to corroborate these results. These data document that volcanic eruptions (and wildfires) lead to a temporary \"sterilisation\" of the affected aquatic and terrestrial habitats and hence to the destruction of most of the micro-organisms that existed there before the catastrophic event occurred (Figures 10, 11). The patterns of re-colonization by microbial communities and the resulting evolutionary diversifications are not yet explored in detail.\n\nReviewer 1: Mark Ragan, University of Queensland, Australia\n\nReviewer's comments: In this article the Author develops a new perspective on macroevolution, based on a narrative of how our understanding of the living world has evolved particularly over recent centuries. The main models along this trajectory are a static Chain of Being, a static Tree of Life, and finally a geologically (hence environmentally) dynamic tree-like \"synade\" driven primarily by symbiogenesis, \"directional\" natural selection and plate tectonics. I completely agree that it is important to situate our understanding, not least about evolution, in historical perspective, and the Author rightly attempts to weave together this history from developments in two fields, geology and biology. He further reminds us of the broader contexts of the intellectual enterprise, referencing philosophy, religion, human behaviour as well as scientific content per se. Addressing this important challenge requires broad but careful interdisciplinary scholarship, and my comments largely focus on issues of historical accuracy, not on the (undisputed) merit of the undertaking itself.\n\nThe author claims that the Scala Naturae was a \"Western medieval Christian\" idea. Lovejoy (Great Chain of Being, 1936) and others have clearly shown that ideas of perfection, vertical ordering and continuity long preceded Christianity. The Chain of Being infuses the teachings of Pythagoras (Sixth century BCE), and Paul Kuntz (Jacob's Ladder, 1987) finds it common to most religious traditions. In any event there is substantial overlap between the various canons of the (Christian) Old Testament and the (Hebrew) Tanakh. Nor is it helpful to refer to the Chain of Being as Christian \"dogma\" (a belief that cannot be doubted, against a penalty of excommunication).\n\nAuthor's response: I agree with the opinion of the referee and have modified the text accordingly.\n\nReviewer's comments: Regarding Lull (or Llull), it is a little imprecise to say he published a tree-like scheme, as the printing-press came into use more than 120 years after his death. Trees of logic, divisio scientiarum and genealogy appeared many centuries before Lull. Nor was Lull's diagram unique in admixing the real with the supernatural, mystical or conceptual (cf. Jacob's Ladder, medieval cosmologies, sephirotic trees). The Author correctly states that Lull had only limited influence, but goes on in the same sentence to claim that nonetheless \"...the Western medieval Christian idea of the Scala naturae... is unequivocally related to the Bible-based ideology depicted in Figure 1\" [Lull's apostolic tree]. Precisely what does \"related to\" mean here?\n\nAuthor's response: The text was re-written in order to clarify these points.\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author incorrectly characterises Bonnet as having believed that \"there is no change in nature, everything remains identical, and species are constant\". Bonnet did indeed embrace a static framework of increasingly perfect steps that we recognise as biological taxa, but wrote (PalingÃ©nÃ©sie philosophique, 1769) that the germ of each form of life gradually progresses within this framework, i.e. works its way step-by-step up the Chain. Buffon had entertained similar ideas slightly earlier, as would Lamarck later. The Author's Figure 2 shows only the top half of Bonnet's chain of being, which was first published in 1745 (TraitÃ© de Insectologie), and later (1779, not 1719) appeared in the first volume of his Oeuvres.\n\nAuthor's response: The text was modified as recommended and the legend to Figure 2 corrected.\n\nReviewer's comments: I do not understand how any branched tree can be said to be \"more ladder-like than a true tree with branches\", nor how Lamarck's 1809 and 1815 trees are topologically any more ladder-like than the one in Darwin's Origin. Trees have branches, ladders do not, and Lamarck's diagrams show branches.\n\nAuthor's response: These unclear sentences were re-written and ... \"branches with twigs\" added so that this misunderstanding is now corrected. In my view, Lamarck's table of 1809, reproduced in Figure 2, looks more like a ladder than a \"true tree\". For instance,/Infusoires, Polypes and Radiaires/,/Insectes, Arachnides, CrustacÃ©s/and/Annelides, CirrhipÃ¨des, Mollusques/are depicted as ladders, but no such A/B/C-arrangement can be found in Darwin's tree reproduced in Figure 4. However, I agree with the referee that this is my own personal view and one can likewise imagine a tree in this static Tableau.\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author refers to Cuvier's \"religious\" opposition to Lamarck. While Cuvier was a Protestant and Lamarck, born into a Catholic family, became a deist, their famous antagonism was above all else a \"competition for priority and empire\" (Outram, Georges Cuvier, 1984). To my (admittedly limited) knowledge, Cuvier was not similarly belligerent toward other non-Protestants; nor am I aware that he criticised Lamarck for his religious beliefs per se.\n\nAuthor's response: This sentence was modified as follows: After his death, Lamarck encountered fierce religious and political opposition.\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author insists that Darwin's use of \"old-fashioned terms such as 'perfection, improvement, higher vs lower (or primitive) forms of life' ... clearly documents relicts of religiously motivated 'ladder-thinking' in his mind\". A scan of the Origin for occurrences of perfect finds that Darwin used it to describe structural complexity, specialisation and competitiveness in the struggle for existence - arguably fair use for a general audience in 1859, and utterly distinct from its sense in Bonnet, much less Bonaventure. Nor were many specialist terms available - recall Haeckel's orgy of neologism in Generelle Morphologie (1866). While I don't deny that Darwin, like us all, was a product of his intellectual place and time, the Author fails to make his case that these terms arose from ladder-thinking per se and not simply from the broader Western intellectual tradition (e.g. the idea of perfection in Timaeus).\n\nAuthor's response: I agree that my conclusion is not supported by strong evidence and have therefore modified the text accordingly.\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author takes Darwin to task for failing to mention bacteria in his published work. Microscopic life had long been imagined (Ovid, Pliny), and its eventual observation (Leeuwenhoek, mid-1670s) prompted Thomas Hobbes to praise the majesty of God revealed in His microscopic creation (Decameron Physiologicum, 1678). By 1859 microbial life was known to be abundant and diverse, although bacteria per se remained poorly known: Pasteur began his work on bacteria in the early 1860s, Koch from the mid-1870s, and Cohn's classifications date from 1872. O'Malley (Trends in Microbiology 17:341-347, 2009) documents that Darwin was well aware of progress in microbiology, corresponded with Ehrenberg and Haeckel, and even invited Cohn to Down House. Whether because he concluded that the state of knowledge would not advance his argument, or judged the area as too unfamiliar to his audience, Darwin omitted mention of microbes in the first edition of Origin. Responding to criticism, however, he added text on \"some of the lowest forms, as the infusoria and rhizopods\" for the third edition (1861).\n\nAuthor's response: I have modified the text and suggested that Darwin's remarks on microbes are confusing and unclear.\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author rightly calls attention to Haeckel's acknowledgement of Lamarck: the second volume of Generelle Morphologie (1866) was dedicated to Darwin, Lamarck and Goethe. Readers with German may be interested in Haeckel's Die Naturanschauung von Darwin, Goethe und Lamarck (1882).\n\nAuthor's response: In Germany, most of the books of Haeckel, which were sometimes distributed via local publishers, are no longer available. Moreover, no complete list of publications (papers, books, monographs) has ever been published, due to a lack of interest in this eminent biologist in this country - a \"Haeckel-Industry\" does not exist in Germany. Unfortunately, I am unable to purchase a copy of Haeckel (1882) and study this \"Schrift\".\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author refers to the oak tree as \"the primate of plants\" in the \"Christian medieval hierarchy\" of the Scala Naturae, and on this basis reads Haeckel's choice of the oak for his classic tree-diagrams, and an 1855 comment by Wallace, as examples of atavistic \"ladder-thinking\". I know of very little evidence that the oak tree was widely considered as the most-perfect plant, hence to link vegetables with animals. Quite the opposite: for Bradley (Philosophical Account, 1721) the most-perfect plant was the fig; for Linnaeus (Ordines Naturales, 1764) the palms; for Bonnet (Contemplation, 1764) Mimosa; for Oken (Elements, 1847) the apple; for Haeckel (NatÃ¼rliche SchÃ¶pfungsgeschichte, 1868) the bell-blossom; for A.P. de Candolle, Endlicher and E. Fries the Ranunculaceae, Papilionaceae and Compositae respectively, with NÃ¤geli (Mechanisch-physiologische Theorie, 1884) tending to support Fries. Cotton Mather (Christian Philosopher, 1721) lauded the cabbage-tree and banana, while in a paragraph beginning \"Even the most noxious and the most Abject of the Vegetables...\" described fungi in \"rotten Barks of Oaks\".\n\nAuthor's response: In Germany, Oaks are the symbol of strength and beauty. I believe that, for this reason, the German biologist Haeckel used the Oak in all of his drawings wherein he depicted phylogenetic trees.\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author claims that Haeckel argued that the Tree of Life is monophyletic, and to be sure, trees depicting a monophyletic origin of organisms appear in his work (e.g. NatÃ¼rliche SchÃ¶pfungsgeschichte, opposite page 569). In two other places even in this same book, however (pages 347, 382), Haeckel depicts multiple origins via spontaneous generation, with nine and six lineages respectively persisting to the present. His discussions in Protistenreich (page 66) and especially Generelle Morphologie (Vol. I, chapter 7) are nuanced, but he comes down on the side of polyphyly. By the sixth edition of History of Creation (Lankester's translation of the eighth edition of NatÃ¼rliche SchÃ¶pfungsgeschichte), Haeckel finds the question to be \"of very subordinate importance\" (Vol. II, page 42).\n\nTheobald's argument is powerful, but few things in natural history are \"unequivocal\".\n\nAuthor's response: I have added the sentence \"However, ...\" and extended the legend to Figure 6 accordingly. The statement concerning ref. 30 was modified.\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author correctly states that Haeckel included both nucleate and anucleate micro-organisms in his Protista, but most subsequent authors restrict the term to morphologically simple eukaryotes. To my knowledge Haeckel never used the term Monerologie and, given potential confusion with Monadologie (Leibniz) or Monismus (Haeckel again), I caution against its adoption.\n\nAuthor's response: I think that the term \"Monerology\" is justified, because, as a result of Haeckel's work, the study of the Monera gathered momentum. Therefore, the text was not modified as recommended by the referee.\n\nReviewer's comments: The idea that organisms were or continue to be assembled from free-living units can be traced to Schimper (1883, 1885) and Oken (Die Zeugung, 1805), indeed to various seventeenth-century corpuscular theories. As the Author states, Mereschkowsky put symbiosis centre-stage as the key to cellular origin, and a unifying evolutionary principle. It is, however, imprecise to say that Mereschkowsky's symbiogenesis includes eukaryogenesis, as the term Eucaryotes was introduced by Chatton only in 1925. The 1992 translation of Khakhina's Concepts of Symbiogenesis (Russian original 1979) is an indispensable reference on Mereschkowsky and his period.\n\nAuthor's response: I disagree with this opinion. In Mereschkowsky's paper the origin of the nucleus is discussed at length. Hence, symbiogenesis includes eukaryogenesis, as described in the text. The book of Khakhina (1992) is cited and discussed in detail in ref. 35 (in German).\n\nReviewer's comments: I disagree with the Author that a \"static Earth\" prevailed in geology pre-1858. In fact the previous decades had been characterised by intense debate: uniformitarians (Lyell, Chambers) versus catastrophists (Cuvier, Sedgwick, Whewell), Neptunists (Werner, Jameson) versus Vulcanists (Hutton, Playfair), Deluge universalists (Buckland) versus regionalists (Hugh Miller). Many, perhaps all, of these competing explanations were presented by their respective proponents as consistent with the Biblical account.\n\nAuthor's response: According to Wegener (1929), ref. 59, the \"static earth-view\" was the dominant hypothesis of most scientists before ca. 1858. However, I agree with the referee that some geologists may have published \"dynamic Earth-like\" hypotheses and ideas before 1858, that are not cited anymore. The principle of natural selection was likewise proposed before Darwin (1859) by many authors. A detailed description of all of these concepts is beyond the scope of this article.\n\nReviewer's comments: I'm unfamiliar with this earth-science variant of Dobzhansky's saying (which, by the way, is slightly misquoted), and ask the Author to provide a citation. I don't dispute the importance of plate tectonics, but does it entirely crowd out, say, Steno's Laws as the sole \"unifying principle of historical geology\"?\n\nAuthor's response: I have re-written this sentence accordingly.\n\nReviewer's comments: Figures 8, 9, 10, 11 are simply illustration, not scientific argument.\n\nAuthor's response: In view of the devastating 2011 Sendai megathrust 9.0-earthquake and tsunami that occurred on March 11 in Japan (briefly discussed in the revised text) these figures are important illustrations of the most significant arguments of the paper. The text was extended with reference to the catastrophe that occurred in Japan.\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author cites himself (reference [70]) as documenting that Darwin (now additionally identified as a theologian) \"used Biblical phrases such as 'He who...' throughout his Origin\". This raises the not insignificant matter of what constitutes a Biblical phrase, or more precisely a Biblical turn of expression. Darwin was familiar with the King James version (KJV, 1604-1611), while the phrase \"He who laughs last, laughs longest\" was in use by 1608, implying that \"He who...\" phrases entered the KJV from the broader language, not vice-versa. Many of course originated as Latin as \"Qui...\" phrases, for example \"He who dares, wins\" (Qui audet, vincet). \"Qui...\" expressions are not uncommon in the works of (or attributed to) e.g. Publius Syrus, Ovid and Seneca, and thus predate the Vulgate by 450-600 years. Darwin is likely to have encountered these in his schooling (in his Autobiography he refers, somewhat disparagingly, to his classics training at Cambridge).\n\nAuthor's response: I agree with the referee: Darwin may have been indoctrinated with these Biblical \"He who\"-phrases during his education. However, it is clear that these \"He who\"-phrases can also be found in non-Biblical texts such as those cited above. Since Darwin was a theologian by training I have restricted my discussion to Biblical phrases.\n\nReviewer's comments: In the same passage, the Author adds that \"the symbol of Trees first appears in the creation myth of the Old Testament\". I remind the Author that Enkidu and Gilgamesh (27th Century BCE) felled the giant cedar to serve as the door to the Temple of Enlil - a symbolic use if ever there were one. A sacred tree was associated with King Ashurnasirpal II of Assyria (883-859 BCE). Moses is considered to have lived around the 14th Century BCE, and the books of the Pentateuch/Torah were written quite a few centuries later. For early tree-symbols in other cultures and contexts see Cook, The Tree of Life: Image for the Cosmos (1974).\n\nAuthor's response: I agree with the referee and have removed the word \"first\".\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author asserts that \"the trees of Darwin and Haeckel are 'static', based on their implicit assumption of an Earth surface that does not display significant movements.\" Haeckel in fact corresponded with Philip Sclater (Secretary of the Zoological Society of London 1860-1902, and founder of The Ibis) concerning a supposed lost continent (Lemuria) that had once served as a land bridge between Madagascar and India (explaining the modern distribution of lemurs) but was supposed to have since subsided. Nor is it necessary to invoke plate tectonics to bring dynamism into species trees: dispersal and allopatric speciation provide that, at least for macroscopic organisms.\n\nAuthor's response: I have read the books of Darwin and Haeckel very carefully: In no section or sentence a dynamic Earth is mentioned, i.e., these biologists assumed that the earth is static (see Wegener 1929, who documents, in the first sections of his book, that, in the 19 th century, the \"static Earth-view\" prevailed). However, I agree with the referee that, in their notebooks etc., both Darwin and Haeckel may have envisioned a dynamic Earth. To the best of my knowledge, there is no proof for this speculation.\n\nReviewer's comments: The Author concludes by proposing that symbiogenesis, \"directional\" natural selection in sensu Weismann and Schmalhausen, and the dynamic Earth \"must be viewed as the three most important 'driving forces' of organismic evolution.\" I admit to scepticism about Top Three lists, but if we're to play the game, then why, after (wrongly) excoriating Darwin for ignoring microbes, and calling Earth our \"planet of the bacteria\", does the Author select such eukaryote-centric processes? What about genetic variation, barriers to gene flow, energy flow through ecosystems, or planetary climate change? Or might we embrace Top Three List pluralism, according prokaryotes a separate set of drivers that might include surface-volume ratios, extrachromosomal inheritance and/or lateral genetic transfer?\n\nAuthor's response: I fully agree with the referee and therefore have removed \"the most\" so that this sentence is now less \"dogmatic\". We are eukaryotic macro-organisms, with domesticated bacteria (mitochondria) in all of our body cells. Therefore, an \"eukaryote-centric\" view may be justified.\n\nReviewer 2: W. Ford Doolittle, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada\n\nReviewer's comments: I very much enjoyed this thought-provoking essay, as, I am sure, will other readers of this issue of Biology Direct. So let's get right to some of the thoughts it provokes.\n\nOn causes of evolution. In general it is hard to complain about the general notion here, which is that the neo-neoDarwinian synthesis for this post-postgenomic era will be further loosened by the admission that symbiogenesis, reticulation at the gene level and a sort of born-again catastrophism will be (in fact long have been) muscling their way on to the center of the explanatory stage as causes of evolution. It is possible to complain, though, that Kutschera and so many others who promote this or that process as the or (even just one of the) principal causes of this or that pattern in evolution seem to believe that the idea of cause, and in particular the notion that we might rank causes by relative importance, is unproblematic. A search for \"causation\" in the online Stanford Encylopedia of Philosophy reveals that it is not, and especially when there are no conceivable common units of measure with which the complex of factors behind everything that has happened in the history of life on this earth might be quantitatively compared. Symbiogenesis, if seen as a natural predisposition or drive on the part of organisms is obviously out, but as a frequent solution to evolutionary challenges may well need more emphasis. The impact of spectacular but localized geological events on microbial evolution has certainly not been thought much about, maybe because of the belief that everything is and always has been everywhere.\n\nLadder-of-life-ism. I'd agree with the Dr. Kutschera that Darwin had not given up the notion that evolution is in some ways progressive, and it is common, as the author does, to deride such residual ladder-of-life or great-chain-of-being type of thinking. But we do all imagine that when life began it was very much simpler than today. Many contemporary biologists accept the ideas developed by Eors Szathmary and the late John Maynard Smith in their book The Major Transitions in Evolution. Indeed symbiogenesis itself of one of the examples of contingent irreversibility Szathmary and Maynard Smith stress, as a rung on what looks very like a ladder of advancing complexity. The Great Chain of Being, like Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny, is something we are not supposed to believe in but that points obliquely to a truth. Maybe, as Dr. Kutschera claims, the old, bad, ladder-of-life thinking that he feels still infected Darwin was religious in character. But a new understanding of the inevitable increase in complexity is not, surely.\n\nLUCA. Another point I and other enthusiastic lateralists might disagree with this author is in his claim that Douglas Theobald, in his recent Nature paper, confirmed Darwin's \"species theory N. 2\" (\"the principle of the last common ancestor of all forms of life\"). We'd agree that this was Darwin's idea, but not that it is true or that Theobald confirmed it. In fact, he (Theobald) writes that \"the last universal common ancestor [LUCA] may have comprised a population of organisms with different genotypes that lived in different places at different times.\" This doesn't fit any reasonable definition of ancestor and in fact the model for evolution that several of us hold boils down to saying that LUCA is still alive and well. It is necessary to realize that having common ancestry does not logically entail sharing a common ancestor.\n\nAuthor's response: I have re-written the unclear sentences accordingly and cited the important book of E. Szathmary and I. Maynard Smith (1998). The key sentence of the paper of Theobald (2010) was included.\n\nReviewer 3: Staffan MÃ¼ller-Wille, University of Exeter, United Kingdom\n\nReviewer's comments: This article presents some interesting suggestions as to the chief ingredients of contemporary attempts to tell the history of life on earth - natural selection, symbiogenesis and plate tectonics - but it fails miserably as a piece of intellectual history. I do not have the expertise to judge the \"synade model\" of macroevolution Kutschera proposes, but as a historian of the life-sciences I would like to point out some of the many inaccuracies and weaknesses of argument that permeate his account of how, in his own words, \"the old Biblical 'woody plant-model' evolved by descent with modification.\" I will conclude with a few words on why I think it is important for contemporary biologists and their audiences to get the history of their discipline right.\n\nI will begin with one of those details that historians like to fuss about. Figure 1 of Kutschera's article shows, as the caption describes it, \"the 'Tree of Knowledge', drawn ca. 1304 by Raymon Lull (1235-1315)\" (the correct, Catalan spelling of his name is Ramon Llull). Any attentive beholder will notice immediately that the \"drawing\" is in fact a woodcut, a technique Europeans began to employ around 1400 only, that is, almost a century after Llull had died. The image is, of course, taken from a posthumous print edition of Ramon Llull's Arbor Scientie that appeared in Lyon in 1505. And it does not represent the tree of knowledge but - as a heading in the original book indicates - a \"moral tree\". Latin inscriptions in the original, erased from the reproduction Kutschera uses, indicate that the fruits on the right-hand side of the tree - i.e., the tree's actual left-hand side - symbolize the seven deadly sins (wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony) growing out of corruption (vitiositas) which in turn roots in malice, stupidity, falsehood and absence of (good) purpose (privatio finis). Correspondingly, on the left-hand side of the tree we find the seven cardinal virtues, held securely in the ground by many more roots, including kindness, magnanimity and wisdom. The figure on top of the tree is of course not God, but Jesus, pruning the tree on its 'evil side' with the help of an axe (Figure 1).\n\nThe example demonstrates that Ramon Llull was able to exploit visual tree-metaphors in a number of ways, and that it is worthwhile attending closely to details and context [87]. In the case of the moral tree, the tree is actually split into two, and the basic idea illustrated by the tree metaphor is a dynamic one: virtue breeds virtue, and vice breeds vice, so that Jesus has to return to his worldly father's profession. Llull is also known for representations of the scale of nature (Figure 2), but in this case - unlike his \"moral tree\" - the underlying logic has very little to do with \"Bible-based ideology\", as Kutschera claims. The idea of a scale of nature pre-dates Christianity, with Plato as its first systematic proponent [88]. It builds on a simple intuitive idea, namely that diversity derives from the presence or absence of qualities and capacities, from \"privation\" and \"perfection\" in contemporary parlance. Take away rationality from a human, and you end up with an animal, take away sensation and locomotion, and you end up with plants. This has a lot do with ideology, but also with basic logic, yet very little specifically with the Bible or the Christian creed. Note that God, or Jesus for that matter, is conspicuously absent from Llull's scale of nature. The \"highest\" position is taken in by \"Being (Ens)\", i.e. substance in its most general sense, the \"lowest\" by individual humans like Plato and Socrates. If one prefers to read the \"tree\" top-down, an entirely materialist picture presents itself, with two pagan philosophers occupying the highest place.\n\nStill, Christianity seems to be the main-culprit in the rather linear and static history that Kutschera himself tells about the evolution of tree-of-life-ideas. To call Llull a \"fanatic Christian\" is ludicrous. His doctrines were in fact condemned by papal decree in 1376. Georges Cuvier's opposition to Lamarck did certainly not lead to a return to \"Biblical myths.\" Quite on the contrary, the morphological evidence he had gathered for the existence of four \"embranchements\" in the animal kingdom - vertebrates, molluscs, articulates, and radiates -, dealt the final death-blow to the idea of a scale of nature. When Darwin criticized \"independent species creations\" he did not have in mind \"religious dogma\" in general, but the theory that his friend Charles Lyell had laid out in his three-volume Principles of Geology (1831-1833). The diagram in Darwin's Origin of Species will only appear as a straight-forward tree, if one cuts it down like Kutschera does in Figure 4 - the original illustration shows a structure with no trunk but multiple roots (Figure 3). Darwin did include microbes in his scientific work [77], p. 229, and his view of our planet was certainly not static. And finally, while he did speak in terms of perfection and improvement, he handled these terms relationally, and shared with his contemporaries and predecessors, at least since Carl Linnaeus (1735-1778), a curious predilection for levelling out the presumed steps in the scale of nature, for example by demonstrating that earthworms possess intelligence in his last book [89], p. 189. In an almost random manner, Kutschera behaves like Jesus on Llull's moral tree, pruning out whatever idea appears wrongheaded to him as corrupted by religious myth on the one hand, and reducing the history of biology to a straight, progressive path towards what we, or rather he, considers to be true today.\n\nWhy should all this matter? Well, first of all, because demands on empirical accuracy and objectivity are as exacting in the humanities as they are in the sciences. It may matter whether it was indeed the oak tree - or not perhaps the date-palm, the only plant known to antiquity to possess sexuality [90] - that ranked below animals in the scale of nature (I could not find any reference to oak trees in the paper by William Bynum that Kutschera quotes in support of his rather bold claim). But there is a deeper reason. Portraying the history of science as a perennial battle between good science and evil religious influences just leaves out too much of the middle-ground that exists between these poles. What one is usually left with are equally unsatisfactory and unappealing versions of both. The current clashes between Neo-Darwinians and Intelligent Design proponents presents the public with bad theology and bad science, both claiming to have found answers to everything. Science as a pursuit of knowledge about the world, raising difficult questions about things that matter deeply, gets lost in this reduced landscape of Legoland-caricatures of science and religion.\n\nFigure captions:\n\nFigure 1: \"Moral tree\".

Figure 1 was reproduced from a text written by a historian of science (ref. 8), who labelled this woodcut \"The tree of knowledge\", but I have changed this as recommended by the referee into \"The Moral Tree\".\n\nAll suggestions and recommendations were incorporated into the revised text.\n\nThe references O'Malley 2009 (76) and MÃ¼ller-Wille 2009 (77) were added to the text and briefly discussed.\n\nI have studied all major works of Charles Darwin - micro-organisms are not taken into consideration by the author. His brief references to \"lower organisms\" are confusing, unclear and, from our modern perspective, simply wrong, because Darwin was unaware of the concept of symbiogenesis that was discovered/developed after his death (see ref. 39 for a detailed discussion of this topic).\n\nIn my view, the general conclusion that religion has prevented the progress of science and is in conflict with rational thinking is justified. I do not want to change this statement, which is based on many facts and is, moreover, corroborated by corresponding conclusions published in numerous articles and books cited at the end of the text."
