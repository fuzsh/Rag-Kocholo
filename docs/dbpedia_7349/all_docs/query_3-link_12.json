Introduction\n\nThus far we have seen how the geological time scale was constructed and during that same period, dinosaurs were discovered.\n\nA major part of this course will be the evolutionary relationships of dinosaurs and how the evolution of key innovations in groups of organisms modifies the Earth system.\n\nBut what is evolution, how do we know about it, how does evolution function, and how do we know about in the past?\n\nII. SCALA NATURAE\n\nThe western belief in linear order - in 18th and 19th century Europe and North America made worth looking for order as a product of God a meaningful pursuit.\n\nOne very important aspect of that order was called the SCALA NATURAE (Scale of Nature) - a concept attributed to Aristotle, ranking things from the inorganic to humans and angels.\n\nIn this view the universe was absolute and full - a concept called the Principle of Plenitude\n\nConcept related to Platonic concept of absolute ideals.\n\nSupported feudal social stratification as well as putting everything in its place - we still have strong vestiges of that concept.\n\nIII. Species problem\n\nThrough the 1600 - 1800's the idea of \"The path to God is by contemplating his works\" was a romantic and popular one which at least justified (if not motivated) much early natural history work.\n\nLed to great attempts at classifications.\n\nOne fundamental problem was - what are the units of life to be classified?\n\nIV. Carolus Linnaeus (Carl von Linné)\n\n(1706-1778) was a Swedish naturalist who took it upon himself to classify the entire natural world.\n\nHe became known as \"God's Registrar\"\n\nLinnaeus recognized that interbreeding showed that there was a natural break between organisms that would freely interbreed and those that would not. This was a fact known well by breeders of dogs and other domestic animals.\n\nLinnaeus saw that there was a \"unity of type\". He showed that the basic unit of natural classification was not the individual but the \"species\", and that they were recognizable by the fact that the individuals within a species would freely interbreed.\n\nIn other words a species is held together by sex.\n\nIn a monumental work on the sexual system in plants Linnaeus showed that the \"biological definition of a species\" holds true just as well for animals.\n\nNonetheless, in most cases species are recognized by the fact that members of a species tend to look much more like each other than they do to members of other species.\n\nThus, most species are identified by morphology. Testable by interbreeding.\n\nV. In 1758 Linnaeus published his grand opus: SYSTEMA NATURAE\n\nIn this work he outlined not only the known species of animals and plants, but also what has become to be known as the \"Linnean Hierarchy\" of Taxonomic levels.\n\nHe noticed that while the fundamental unit was the species, that species could be grouped by similarity of structure into larger groups: genera, families, orders, classes, phyla, and kingdoms (and others in between). We call any entity within this hierarchy a taxon (plural - taxa). Thus a species is a taxon as is a family. This is an inclusive hierarchy.\n\nIn other words, kingdoms consist of and contain classes, classes consist of and contain orders, orders consist of and contain families, families consist of and contain genera, genera consist of and contain species.\n\nIn this \"Linnean Hierarchy\" speciesare handled specially - a fact you need to know and be familiar with.\n\nHere is the Linnean Hierarchy for us: THE LINNEAN HIERARCHY FOR HUMANS\n\nPhylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Primates Family Hominidae Genus Homo Species Homo sapiens\n\nVI. That this classification method worked became clear very quickly and it was universally adopted. BUT WHY DID IT WORK ?\n\nLinnaeus catalogued species as if invariable, but the occasional hybrids between species suggested to him they were not quite so fixed.\n\nIn fact, although Linnaeus began by believing that species were fixed entities created by God as is, later in life he began to believe otherwise:\n\nthat they were \"children of time\", capable of transformation in form though time � in other words species could evolve.\n\nVII. Jean Baptiste Lamarck\n\n(1744-1829) came up with the first reasonable theory of organic evolution. He recognized that:\n\n1) organisms change in their environment\n\n2) that they discontinuously change and reorganize\n\nBut he could not could not deal with concept of extinction.\n\nLamarck believed that species could change through time by passing on traits acquired during an individual's life to their offspring - the so-called \"acquired characteristics\".\n\nIn this way all variation now and in the past were united by a \"Great Chain of Being\". It was the Scala Naturae in motion.\n\nVIII. Our friend Georges Cuvier\n\n(1769-1832) believed very strongly that extinction was real!\n\nHis studies made him think all traits of organisms are designed to be a perfectly functional whole.\n\nHe believed that there were several different basic plans (bauplans) of organisms - separate creations.\n\nHe also believed that the history of life consisted of separate periods of creation and periods of and extinctions - catastrophes - much like the French Revolution that he survived.\n\nWith this belief system Cuvier ran right into Lamarck. Cuvier was a successful political animal and managed to have Lamarck ostracized.\n\nThere were other evolutionary concepts around, but like Lamarck's ideas, none took hold because they lacked a clear and observable mechanism\n\nIX. Darwin - Wallace and Natural Selection\n\nCharles Darwin (photo) became the ships naturalist on the H.M.S. Beagle. He saw many unfamiliar patterns of geography and organismal variation that needed to be explained.\n\nIn particular he noted the parallel between species, geography and adaptation and fittedness to environments.\n\nTo Darwin, this became the central problem - how did organisms within a species become adapted to their roles in the world?\n\nHe spelled this out long after his voyages with the Beagle in his Origin of Species (On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, 1859).\n\nOne key was Thomas Malthus (1766-1834), an English political economist concerned about the consequences of poverty such as he saw in London. A critical work was his \"Essay on the Principle of Population\" (1798).\n\nMalthus showed that populations if allowed to grow unchecked increase at a geometric rate.\n\nThe world could not possibly hold so many, so natural checks are in place. Poverty, disease, war, and famine were all outcomes of increasing population that in fact kept populations of all organisms from increasing. Many more organisms are born than can possibly survive.\n\nDarwin took this concept and combined it with a critical observation.\n\nVariation of morphology and behavior was a fact of life.\n\nThe old idea was one of \"Ideals\" or \"Types\" of Platonic origin. We still hold to that informally. In the \"typological\" concept of species, variation is some error around a true ideal form.\n\nBut Darwin recognized that variation was at the core of what a species is. There is a statistically average condition, but each variant is as real as any other and there is no ideal condition. This concept of type is unfortunately still very much part of racial thinking and has no place in modern biology.\n\nDarwin was espousing \"populationist thinking\".\n\nDarwin realized that this natural variation led to differential survival based on that variation. For a given environmental context some variants would fair better than others in the \"struggle for existence\".\n\nDarwin was a domestic pigeon breeder (as a part of his research) and knew that humans had long taken advantage of natural variation to select for breeds; this is artificial selection. Hence Darwin called his explanation \"Natural Selection\".\n\nDarwin noted clearly the fact that the most closely related (similar) species were often found closest together in geography.\n\nThere are 5 parts to Darwin's Natural Selection:\n\n1. Heredity of most features\n\n2. Heritable Variation in the population\n\n3. Variation leads to differential rates in survival and reproductive success among the variations.\n\n4. Differential survival and reproduction leads to a shift in the frequency of characters, leading to a shifting of mode within the species.\n\n5. If this process goes on long enough, parent and daughter species can no longer interbreed.\n\nRemember: Populations and species evolve, individuals do not.\n\nTwo wonderful examples, studied by Darwin and still studied today, are the so-called \"Darwin's Finches\", members of the family Geospizidae in the Galapagos Islands, and the islands' giant tortises.\n\nAlfred Russell Wallace (1823-1913) came up with vitually the same concept of natural selection more or less independently through his studies on the Malay archipelago. Darwin panicked because he was not ready with his book yet!\n\nBoth gave papers at the same time and the same subject at the Linnean Society meeting of 1858 (thanks to Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker).\n\nBy the way, the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" comes originally not from Darwin but rather from Herbert Spencer who adopted Darwin's ideas to a general progessionist philosophy (many say inappropriately), although Darwin adopted the term in his later editions of the Origin of Species on advice from Wallace.\n\nX. BUT HOW DO WE KNOW EVOLUTION OCCURS?\n\n1. PRESENTLY TESTABLE\n\n2. STRAINS OF BACTERIA adapting to changes\n\n3. IN PAST - PREDICTIONS OF INTERMEDIATES - BIRDS - ARCHAEOPTERYX\n\nWe know about evolution from 5 classes of order in organisms:\n\nORDER IN CHARACTERS (comparative anatomy)\n\nORDER IN GENETICS\n\nORDER IN DEVELOPMENT (embryology)\n\nORDER IN GEOLOGICAL RECORD\n\nORDER IN GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nXI. From our present perspective then we can recognize at least three different kinds of evolution\n\n1. microevolution\n\n2. evolution of taxa\n\n3. evolution of key innovations\n\nEven within this we can recognize two modes:\n\nANAGENESIS VS. CLADOGENESIS (see also discussion in Transitional Vertebrate Fossils FAQ)\n\nThen rates of evolution are a different matter again:\n\nGRADUAL VS. PUNCTUATED\n\nDARWIN'S GAPS\n\nAs an aside, it is worth noting that Darwin initially regarded the fossil record as a bit of an embarrassment. In 1859, there were no fossil intermediate forms known between major groups from the fossil record. To argue his point Darwin needed to insist that the fossil record was very incomplete because of gaps in sedimentation. Of course this begs the question of rates of evolution. It now seems that some of the apparent gaps are due to very rapid change indeed.\n\nXII. Now what favors cladogenesis - the splitting of lineages and the proliferation of species?\n\nIN OTHER WORDS, WHAT FAVORS SPECIATION?\n\n1. small numbers\n\n2. isolation\n\n3. extreme conditions (intense selection)\n\nXIV. EVOLUTION CREATES DIVERSITY - BUT EXTINCTION IS OPPOSITE\n\nThe geological record of diversity shows the overall pattern of life.\n\nSO THIS IS WHERE WE GET WHAT WE SEE IN THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD - CREATION OF DIVERSITY\n\nFrom this comes:\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF BIOTIC SUCCESSION of William Smith\n\nHOW, IN DETAIL, DO WE WORK OUT THE EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS OF FOSSIL AND RECENT SPECIES?
