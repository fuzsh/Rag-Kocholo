        "text": "ISP Course 101 39 228 - Darwin, Evolution, and Society\n\nWinter Quarter 2001, TTh 11:50-1:20\n\nInstructor: George F. Michel, (x 4246), rm 507, Byrne Hall;\n\nOffice Hours: TWTh 10:00-11:30\n\ne-mail: gmichel@condor.depaul.edu\n\nType of Course: This is an Internet intensive course (for course syllabus and reading assignments see \"Course Syllabi\" - specifically IDS 303 on my home page http://condor.depaul.edu/~gmichel). Teaching will involve lectures and assigned readings (on the Internet) and their integration via small group discussions, individual performance on homework projects, classroom discussion, and a final team presentation project. Evaluation will depend upon qualitative assessment of the student's classroom discussion and quantitative assessment of student's written assignments, presentation, and journal. Although there is a listed bibliography, the readings will be extracted from the Internet appropriately to the topic of discussion. Often, the reading assignments will illustrate alternative viewpoints.\n\nAs a Focal Point Seminar, this course is designed to introduce first-year students to the nature and scope of intellectual inquiry at DePaul University. In a Focal Point Seminar, students learn about a single topic in depth, and then learn to complicate their view of that topic by examining it from different perspectives. Students also learn to read challenging texts critically and carefully and to use writing as a means of learning difficult subjects thoroughly and effectively.\n\nBrief Course Description: Ever since its initial presentation, Darwinian notions about evolution have engendered much controversy in western societies. This course compares Darwin's notions with those evolutionary notions prevalent before Darwin. Also, we examine how Darwin's notions lead to the Eugenics movement started by his cousin Galton and were adopted by Herbert Spencer for use in his theory of social organization (social Darwinism). Early in the 20th Century, Mendel's genetic theories were rediscovered and incorporated into a Darwinian framework to create the modern Synthetic Theory of Evolution. This lead to several \"biological\" theories about human behavior. For example, Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology seek to integrate social and biological sciences by treating many aspects of human psychology (e.g., violence, racial attitudes, intelligence, altruism, gender differences in values and behavior, homosexuality) and culture (e.g., incest taboos, marital customs, crime, religion, racial, sexual, and ethnic discrimination) as products of naturally selected genetic programs. The common assumptions of the Synthetic theory (that natural selection underlies all directed evolutionary change and that it acts on genes) are critically examined. Alternative accounts to Darwinian theory that rely on creationism notions are also examined critically. Finally a biological account is presented that is consistent with Darwinian notions, but is not reductionistic and deterministic.\n\nCourse Requirements: In addition to the assigned readings, students are responsible for:\n\n1. Five projects (FAQs, three questions about \"text material\", \"tree of life\", \"quincunx\", and speciation) to be handed in at the times noted in the syllabus,\n\n2. Nine homework assignments (a two-page report of what you learned during the previous week) - each will be handed into class on 1/16, 1/23, 1/30, 2/6, 2/13, 2/20, 2/27, 3/6, 3/13,\n\n3. A journal with at least two entries/week of class to be handed in on 3/13,\n\n4. A team presentation (to occur on Mar 15 & Mar 21 (8:30-11:15). Each presentation will examine a specific question about evolution (e.g., \"What are some common misconceptions about evolution?\", \"Is evolution still happening?\", \"What is the position of humans in the evolutionary process?\"). The presentation will state: a) why that question was examined (describing what was known concerning the question and what is hoped to be added by the current attempt to examine this question); b) how it was examined (e.g., the literature that was compared, the people that were polled, the procedures that were followed); c) what was discovered by the current examination (e.g., results of the poll, comparison, etc.); d) What the results of the current examination mean relative to the information presented in \"a\" above. Only one presentation will be constructed by each team; however, each member of the team must contribute to the team's product. Each member of the team will grade his/her performance and that of each other member (including team facilitators) and include a paragraph justification for each grade.\n\nSyllabus for Darwin, Evolution, and Society:\n\nTopic Date\n\nI.
