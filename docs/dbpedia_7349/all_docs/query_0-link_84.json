        "text": "As Lowell said during a lecture at MIT honoring Darwin after his death, “the loneliness of greatness is the price men make the genius pay – for posthumous renown” (Simpson 438). The fact that Lowell is looking and anticipating fame rather than truth creates a stronger will in him to keep his sensational theories alive. With his high respect for and perceived connection to Darwin, Lowell attempts to emulate himself as an archetype seen throughout the Industrial Age: the self-made man. The self-made man seeks to make profit or progress out of his own hard work, as was done in various factories, businesses, and schools, and this analysis shows that Lowell is no exception. From a Darwinian point of view, a self-made man is someone who has fought to be the naturally selected human that is superior to others.\n\nCaught In The Widow's Web Grice\n\n657 Words | 3 Pages\n\nHe uses scholarly language in his essay.

The family lead a socially and intellectually active life and both of his grandfathers were renowned in their profession, as an evolutionary thinker and as a potter, respectively. His upper-middle class upbringing and financial security via prospects of comfortable inheritance served as a solid intellectual and financial background to his achievements. The intellectual, freethinking and scientific atmosphere combined with gentlemanly social standing, religious scepticism and manufacturing affluence enabled him not only to get the best education but to be open to ideas that challenged the status quo (the idea for example that people of colour are brothers under the skin). As boys of his social standing, he attended a private boys’ school and aspired to take over his father’s profession.\n\nThis process was called natural selection he claimed that it was the basic mechanism that had brought about the diversity of the life on earth. Since the late 1800’s the theory of explanations of how evolution works had become more a theory of evolution. As more explanations (evolutionary theory) became accurate, the observations began to accurate, they began to explain the facts, that these facts control the theory, not the other way around.\n\nHow Did Alfred Wallace Contribute To Biology\n\n777 Words | 4 Pages\n\nIn the following paragraph I will be talking about the kind of work that Wallace worked on throughout his lifetime.
