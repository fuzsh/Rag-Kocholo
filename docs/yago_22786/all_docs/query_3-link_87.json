        "text": "Rover Dangerfield is a 1991 American animated musical comedy film starring the voice talent of comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who also wrote and co-produced the film. It is about a street dog named Rover, who is owned by a Las Vegas showgirl. Rover gets dumped off Hoover Dam by the showgirl’s boyfriend. However, rather than drowning, Rover ends up on a farm.\n\nThis is one of those movies that used to be shown all the time on HBO, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network in the 1990s that has a lot of sentimental nostalgic value to a lot of people, myself included.\n\nI love this movie, I think the animation is fantastic, this is done by Hyperion Animation, the same team that did other nostalgic 80s/90s animated fare like The Brave Little Toaster and Bebe’s Kids just to name a few things.\n\nThe voice work overall is very good, Rodney Dangerfield can usually boost even the worst movies by having himself appear in it, you’ve also got Susan Blu, Dana Hill, Gregg Berger, Tress MacNeille, Ronnie Schell, Bob Bergen in the cast giving good performance as well.\n\nThe songs are very catchy and memorable…\n\nI mean, it’s just a delightful movie especially if you grew up with it around the time it came out, it’s just hard not to love.\n\nDoes it have its’ faults? Absolutely. For one thing, there are a couple characters overall that really are just one note and have nothing interesting about them at all, especially Rocky who is just a generic bad guy.\n\nThe story overall is a been there done there storyline, the fish out of water storyline that has been done better in movies like Doc Hollywood amongst many others and they don’t really add anything new to make it stand out on its’ own.\n\nProbably the biggest fault of the film is that you can definitely tell it was tone down from it was originally suppose to be, when this was in development, the plan was to do an R rated animated film to fit more into Rodney Dangerfield’s style of comedy but Warner Bros. wanted it tone down to a G rating to sell to kids….that and also Rodney Dangerfield and Warner Bros. weren’t on the best of terms after the Caddyshack II debacle so this may be one of those things where a lot of the film was edited without Dangerfield involved. But this definitely felt like a different movie that Dangerfield signed on to at first. It would’ve been very interesting to see what an R rated take on this would’ve been.\n\nRover Dangerfield isn’t anywhere near the same levels of a Disney or Pixar movie but it doesn’t need to be. It does enough to get a lot of enjoyment and entertainment value from the great animation, solid voice cast, good music, and just nostalgia value, it’s got flaws, yes, but it still has a special place in my heart, it’s just a fun enjoyable movie to watch. It’s not quite up there with stuff like Chipmunk Adventure or Ducktales The Movie where I can watch it numerous times in a row but it’s still a fun enjoyable movie."
