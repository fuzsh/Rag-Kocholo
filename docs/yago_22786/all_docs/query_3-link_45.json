        "text": "AKA Jacob Cohen\n\nBorn: 22-Nov-1921\n\nBirthplace: Babylon, NY\n\nDied: 5-Oct-2004\n\nLocation of death: Los Angeles, CA [1]\n\nCause of death: Complications of Surgery\n\nRemains: Buried, Westwood Memorial Park Cemetery, Los Angeles, CA\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Comic\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Never did get no respect\n\nThe boy who would one day be Rodney Dangerfield started selling one-liners to comedians at age 15, and was doing stand-up at 17 as \"Jack Roy\". He performed comedy for ten years with little success, always holding down a day job to pay the bills. In 1951, he quit comedy in disgust and sold aluminum siding for 12 years before stepping on stage again.\n\nAfraid of bombing, he didn't want either of his names connected with the expected bad reviews, so at his first \"comeback\" gig, he asked the club manager to make up a name for him. \"Any name at all, just don't put my name in the ad.\" Thus Rodney Dangerfield was born. A guest spot on The Ed Sullivan Show led to dozens of appearances on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Dangerfield's nightclub, cleverly called Dangerfield's, was quickly successful, and gave Dangerfield steady work.\n\nHis schtick was the perpetual loser, but Dangerfield didn't coin his most famous line -- \"I don't get no respect\" -- until 1972, when The Godfather, with its overtly serious theme of \"respect\", needed deflating. Caddyshack (1980) made him a movie star, and his comedy album, No Respect, won a Grammy in 1981. He was the voice (and author and producer) of Rover Dangerfield (1991), and he played Juliette Lewis's incestuous father in Natural Born Killers (1994).\n\nIn late August of 2004, Dangerfield checked into a hospital for heart valve replacement surgery, and cracked one last joke when reporters asked about the operation. \"If things go right, I'll be there about a week, and if things don't go right, I'll be there about an hour and a half.\" During the surgery, he fell into a coma. He briefly regained consciousness in early October, kissing his wife and smiling for the doctors. Dangerfield slipped back into a coma, dying several days later. His tombstone is engraved, \"There goes the neighborhood\".\n\n[1] UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.\n\nFather: Phillip Cohen (stage name Phil Roy, vaudevillian)\n\nSister: Marion\n\nWife: Joyce Indig (m. 1949, div. 1962)\n\nWife: Joyce Indig (m. 1963, div. 1970)\n\nSon: Brian Dangerfield\n\nDaughter: Melanie Dangerfield\n\nWife: Joan Child (florist, b. 1953, m. 26-Dec-1993)\n\nHigh School: Richmond Hill High School, Richmond Hill, NY\n\nEndorsement of Miller Brewing Company 1984\n\nGrammy Best Comedy Recording, No Respect 1981\n\nHollywood Walk of Fame 27-Mar-2002\n\nHeart Attack Nov-2001\n\nHeart Bypass Operation 2000\n\nAngioplasty 2000\n\nComa 2004\n\nStroke\n\nBrain Surgery\n\nHungarian Ancestry Maternal side\n\nJewish Ancestry\n\nRisk Factors: Marijuana, Depression\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nWhen Jews Were Funny (10-Sep-2013) · Himself\n\nThe Onion Movie (7-Jan-2008) · Himself\n\nThe 4th Tenor (22-Nov-2002)\n\nBack by Midnight (2002)\n\nLittle Nicky (2-Nov-2000)\n\nMy 5 Wives (8-Sep-2000) · Monte Peterson\n\nRusty: A Dog's Tale (22-Sep-1998) [VOICE]\n\nThe Godson (22-Sep-1998) · The Rodfather\n\nCasper: A Spirited Beginning (21-Oct-1997)\n\nMeet Wally Sparks (16-Jan-1997) · Wally Sparks\n\nNatural Born Killers (26-Aug-1994) · Mallory's Dad\n\nLadybugs (27-Mar-1992)\n\nRover Dangerfield (1-Jul-1991) [VOICE]\n\nBack to School (13-Jun-1986) · Thornton Melon\n\nEasy Money (19-Aug-1983) · Monty Capuletti\n\nCaddyshack (25-Jul-1980) · Al Czervik\n\nThe Projectionist (17-Jan-1971) · Renaldi\n\nOfficial Website:\n\nhttp://www.rodney.com/\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nIt's Not Easy Bein' Me: A Lifetime of No Respect but Plenty of Sex and Drugs (2004, memoir)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile\n\nCopyright ©2019 Soylent Communications"
