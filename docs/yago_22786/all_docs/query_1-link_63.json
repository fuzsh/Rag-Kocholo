        "text": "The catchphrase of the American comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who has died aged 82, was \"I don't get no respect!\" Many of his jokes were disparaging about his own looks, personality and sex life, and the lack of respect he got from his parents, his wife, his kids, and his doctor: \"My psychiatrist told me I'm going crazy. I told him, 'If you don't mind, I'd like a second opinion.' He said, 'All right. You're ugly too!'\"\n\nConstantly tugging at his red tie, he presented himself as a disgruntled ordinary guy. \"My image is something everyone identified with,\" he claimed. \"They all feel life treated 'em wrong and they got no respect.\"\n\nEarlier this year, he published his surprisingly frank autobiography, It's Not Easy Bein' Me: A Lifetime Of No Respect But Plenty Of Sex And Drugs, which revealed that he had suffered from depression, and that many of his one-liners were derived from an unhappy childhood and personal pain: \"I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toy was a toaster.\"\n\nRodney Dangerfield was born Jacob Cohen in Babylon, New York. His father, Philip Cohen, was a comedian in vaudeville under the name of Phil Roy. \"My dad wasn't around much. I found out much later that he was a ladies' man ... I was raised by my mother, who ran a very cold household. I never got a kiss, a hug, or a compliment. ... I guess that's why I went into show business - to get some love. I wanted people to tell me I was good, tell me I'm OK. Let me hear the laughs, the applause.\"\n\nYoung Jack began his career at the age of 15 when he started writing jokes. \"We were so poor that if I hadn't been born a boy, I'd have had nothing to play with!\" At 17, he started performing at amateur nights before travelling the comedy circuit for 10 years as Jack Roy, without much success. When he married in 1949, he reluctantly gave up showbusiness for a more stable income as an aluminium wall-cladding salesman.\n\nFor more than 10 years, he lived a miserable middle-class suburban existence in New Jersey. \"My wife and I were happy for 20 years. Then we met.\" It wasn't until 1961, aged 40 and divorced, that he reinvented himself as Rodney Dangerfield, standup comedian, a hit on the nightclub circuit and on television in the Ed Sullivan, Tonight and Dean Martin shows, but his biggest break came in the 1970s with his many appearances on the anarchic Saturday Night Live.\n\nDangerfield's first film role was in The Projectionist (1971), a quirky indie movie in which the eponymous hero imagines himself as Captain Flash. Dangerfield doubled as the projectionist's oily boss and the villain, The Bat, of his daydreams.\n\nIt was nine years before Dangerfield reappeared in a film, the low-brow golf comedy Caddyshack (1980), with his Saturday Night Live colleagues Chevy Chase and Bill Murray. Dangerfield, in a sports jacket gaudy even by golfers' standards, plays Al Czervik, a loud-mouthed millionaire who is as insulting as he is rich. It is a tribute to Dangerfield's timing that few of the lines are funny on paper, but audiences found his \"Hey, everybody! We're all gonna get laid!\" hilarious on screen.\n\nDangerfield then starred in Easy Money (1983), in which he is a working-class slob who could receive $10m from his late mother-in-law's estate if he gives up his vices, including smoking, drinking and gambling.\n\nIn Back To School (1986), he is a bombastic, uneducated self-made millionaire businessman who enrols in college in order to encourage his son to complete his education. The film grossed $100m. In 1991, the hugely popular Dangerfield produced, wrote and contributed his voice to the familiar-looking wise-cracking canine hero of the animated feature Rover Dangerfield.\n\nAlthough Dangerfield was just as obnoxious and foul-mouthed as ever in Oliver Stone's controversial Natural Born Killers (1994), his persona was used for dramatic purposes as the repulsive, sexually abusive father of one of the killers (Juliette Lewis). Dangerfield then returned to vulgar slapstick comedies such as Little Nicky (2000) in which he played Lucifer, the grandfather of Adam Sandler's devil on earth, and increasingly dismal farces in which the octogenarian comic is the romantic lead surrounded by young girls.\n\nIn fact, in 1993, Dangerfield married Joan Child, a woman 30 years his junior, the owner of Jungle Roses, a national floral distribution company. In his later years he underwent two aneurysm operations, heart surgery and brain surgery, only to return to work immediately afterwards.\n\nIn 1981, Dangerfield won a Grammy Award for his comedy album No Respect, and was the recipient of the Lifetime Creative Achievement Award from the 1994 American Comedy Awards. His trademark white shirt and red tie are on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. He had obviously gained respect.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, and by two children from his former marriage."
