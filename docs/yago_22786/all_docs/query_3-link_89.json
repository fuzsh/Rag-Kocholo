        "text": "At the age of forty-two, Jack Roy (that was his legal name now) went back. He played a club in Upper Manhattan that he’d worked fifteen years before. The Inwood Lounge, it was now called, a historic joint, because there he got the third and ultimate name of his life. He wanted to break in his new stuff quietly without anyone he knew watching. So he told the owner, George McFadden, not to bill him as Jack Roy. Well, McFadden came up with a lulu. It wasn’t Jack Roy who came out but Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nAnd there, staring at him, was mostly the same crowd he’d played to before, but fifteen years older. They looked at him and they said, “Rodney Danger-field?” Rodney had an answer: “If you’re gonna change your name — change it!”\n\nOne friend said, “Wild name; why not keep it?” As you know, he did. “I don’t know, I was crazy in those days. I was a little depressed. Okay, I became Rodney Dangerfield.”\n\nRodney redux. He worked here, he worked there. He was better now, he thought. “I matured. I wasn’t a kid anymore, I was a man coming back.” Some places he worked free, just to polish the material, work on the image. Sometimes a comic needs a hook, you know? Jack Benny’s stinginess, Billy Crystal’s mahvelous. Rodney’s came out of his real life, his despair, his feeling of always being on the bottom end. He had this joke he wrote: I played hide and seek. They wouldn’t even look for me. “To make it work better, you look for something to put in front of it: I was so poor, I was so dumb, so this, so that.” He thought, “Now what fits that joke? Well, no one liked me was all right. But then I thought, ‘A more profound thing would be I get no respect.’ “\n\nHe tried it at a place in Greenwich Village called Upstairs at the Duplex, equally historic in the annals of comedy. There he declaimed, “I don’t get no respect. When I was a kid, we played hide and seek. They wouldn’t even look for me.”\n\n“And the next day, people started saying to me, ‘Hey, Rodney! No respect! Me, too. I don’t get no respect’ So I started writing more and more no-respect jokes.”\n\nIt was magical. He’d struck a universal chord. All that misery, and now he found out he wasn’t alone. Everyone identified. Everyone else was miserable too! But unlike the rest of them, Rodney made it come out funny.\n\nEvery time I get in an elevator, the operator says the same thing to me: “Basement?”\n\nBetter things were happening to him the second time. The Ed Sullivan Show got him his first national attention and opened television up to him. In 1969 he was able to start his own nightclub, Dangerfield’s, with a borrowed $250,000, mainly so he could work close to his children. There were Johnny Carson shows and beer commercials and a rap video and TV comedy specials and all the rest, a gradual climb to the top. Success, fame, wealth, who knows? Maybe even respect.\n\nBut of course, for Rodney, something will always be missing. Love, happiness … whatever. Best not to dig too deep there. At any rate, you know the Guy Who Does It in One will always see the downside. Rest assured that won’t change.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\n“You know, it’s funny,” Rodney muses as we ride it home. “No matter how big an act you are, to get to the stage, you end up walking through the kitchen. I just worked at the Hilton Hotel, you know? You walk through the kitchen. I worked at Caesars Palace — the kitchen. Every place you go, you’re always in the kitchen.”"
