        "text": "The pudgy, bug-eyed comic became known for his nervous, twitchy ‘loser’ persona. As a self-professed ‘abandoned child,’ Dangerfield found that, like life, the road to comedy stardom could be very rocky.\n\nLife before becoming Rodney Dangerfield wasn’t easy. Born Jacob Cohen and initially going by the stage name of Jack Roy, the 19-year old comedian ventured into the world of stand-up only to find disappointment. After nine years of going nowhere, he completely dropped out of showbiz and, to support his family, sold household aluminum siding. Twenty-five years later, at the age of 45, Rodney decided to give comedy another try, appearing in clubs at night while still selling siding during the day. He ultimately found success, due to luck, persistence and his enormous comedic talent.\n\nIn his autobiography, “It’s Not Easy Bein’ Me: A Lifetime of No Respect,” Dangerfield remembers the jokes he told at his audition for the Sullivan show:\n\n“I live in a tough neighborhood. When I plan my budget, I allow for holdup money.”\n\n“I tell ‘ya, in my building, nothing but robberies. Every time I close a window,\n\nI hit somebody’s hands.”"
