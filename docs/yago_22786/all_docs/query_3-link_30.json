        "text": "RODNEY DANGERFIELD is definitely an acquired taste.\n\nAficionados will be delighted with his performance as Thornton Mellon, a self-made millionaire who goes back to college with his son in ''Back to School,'' which opens today at the UA Twin and other theaters. Those who find him a bit hard to swallow will continue to marvel at how his nervous mannerisms, bulging eyeballs and loud-mouthed joviality manage to endear him to loyal fans who, it seems, will laugh at just about anything he does.\n\nThe film is a good-natured potpourri of gags, funny bits, populist sentiment and anti-intellectualism. Thornton Mellon, who made his fortune in the rag trade as owner of an expanding chain of ''Tall and Fat'' stores has not been spoiled by success. Although he has married and divorced a social-climbing gold digger, he has not done anything extreme such as improving his taste or manners, and he is still the same beer-guzzling, fun-loving guy he always was. Learning that his son wants to drop out of college, he decides to cheer him up, rebuild his dorm room into a mini-Caesar's Palace and buy both of them a first-class education.\n\nHis son rebels. The father parties and plays while the boy goes to the library and tries to make it on his own, proving that you just can't do anything with kids these days. When Thornton is assigned term papers, he hires experts like the writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr. to ghostwrite them. Everything is for sale, not only college admission, for the price of a new business school, but also Mr. Vonnegut, who went for an undisclosed price.\n\nMr. Dangerfield's characterization uses many of the bits that made him famous and also adds an appealing warmth. Thornton Mellon is pot-bellied, crass and unpolished. ''With the shape my body is in,'' he says, ''I could donate it to science fiction.''"
