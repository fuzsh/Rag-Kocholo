        "text": "So if you've ever wondered what an animated film that doesn't even try to fake character development and jumps into every predictable phase looks like, you can watch Rover Dangerfield.\n\nSo it's a story about a dog who lives in Las Vegas left in the care of his owner's implied abusive boyfriend. Also said boyfriend is like a jewel thief or something and tries making deals with the mob? Either way, the dog, Rover, manages to screw up a deal for the boyfriend while his owner is out of town and ends up being thrown off the Hoover damn. Yeah. Really.\n\nSo then he's picked up by some dudes fishing, wakes up, and runs around in confusion because, holy crap, farms are NOT Vegas. He ends up being taken in by a boy living on the farm, though the dad seems pretty damn eager to have Rover put down/put a bullet in his head himself... despite this, he let's his shrill voiced son keep the dog, provided he doesn't cause trouble.\n\nSo Rover expectedly has trouble fitting in while bonding with a sheep dog. Suddenly! Girl next door, Daisy the collie, is barking her head off in a garden and, of course, Rover is in love. So he runs over, introduces himself in song, and by the next scene she is talking to him like she knows him intimately after they've known each other for a full song not even trying all that hard. Suddenly Rover is the most awesome dog evar. Just when we start wtfing about his previous owner, he suddenly has an angstfest over missing her but being in lurv with Daisy, the dog he met like three days ago. 8|\n\nEventually, he's all at Daisy's place when wolves go to attack the chickens and, in the process of stopping them, a turkey dies. Of course, the trigger happy farmer thinks Rover did it and all to happily leads this dog off to shoot it in the woods. Even though they were probably gonna kill the turkey like that week anyway, it was a terrible thing. Every fricken animal ever is sad that Rover this super great buddy to all is going to be shot. Out in the woods, what's his face farmer CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT OH GOD. D'8 He fires a shot while being attacked by wolves, so everyone thinks Rover is dead. He saves farmer guy and then comes back a hero.\n\nSOMEHOW this makes the papers in Vegas and this is how Connie, his owner, finds him. She takes him home, but for some reason Daisy is all pissed about this. Of course, it's because she's in luuuuv. But it's like Rover has a choice who carts him away. He goes back to Vegas, all depressed over not being with Daisy when his owner suddenly decides to bring him back to the farm and leave him there. Also Daisy had puppies. THE END.\n\nWhat\n\nthe\n\nshit\n\nOf course, what can you expect from a movie that has a song entirely about why you shouldn't pee on Christmas trees?\n\nSo this was a movie that actually had some pretty good, if not weird looking, animation (Ashley saying she was sure the boyfriend's hair was rotoscoped. Just the hair. 8|). That's all that can be said. They pretty much shifted into every phase without any emotional development of the characters, making each emotionally driven decision very jarring, especially the way-to-sudden relationship between Rover and Daisy. Hell, even everyone being Rover's god damn best friend was just... poorly developed. The songs, you could see coming from a mile away and you dread it every single time.\n\nAlong with that, you had Rover making all these \"witty\" comments to himself. He was very fast talking and kept rolling with the jokes and responding to conversations where people wouldn't even understand a word he was saying. Pretty much what could have a been a good story with at least 20 minutes more emotional development was just... so defeated by treating itself not as seriously as a movie deserves. It was like what's his face just wrote a routine with the loosest of storylines and then they decided to animate it since he couldn't really be an anthropomorphic dog.\n\nSo this movie had unappealing characters, no real emotional development, and was just all around... unpleasant to me as an animation major.\n\nIf anything, this film made me laugh constantly at Rover's weirdo eyes.\n\nAnd so I leave you with DEM EYES.\n\n:|\n\n~Becca"
