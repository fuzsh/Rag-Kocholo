        "text": "Jack Roy (born Jacob Rodney Cohen; November 22, 1921 â€“ October 5, 2004), better known by the pseudonym Rodney Dangerfield, was an American stand-up comedian, actor, screenwriter, and producer. He was known for his self-deprecating one-liner humor, his catchphrase \"I don't get no respect!\" and his monologues on that theme.\n\nHe began his career working as a stand-up comic at the Fantasy Lounge in New York City. His act grew in popularity as he became a mainstay on late-night talk shows throughout the 1960s and 1970s, eventually developing into a headlining act on the Las Vegas casino circuit. His catchphrase \"I don't get no respect!\" came from an attempt to improve one of his stand-up jokes. \"I played hide and seek; they wouldn't even look for me.\" He thought the joke would be stronger if it used the format: \"I was so ...\" beginning (\"I was so poor,\" \"He was so ugly,\" \"She was so stupid,\" etc.).[clarification needed] He tried \"I get no respect,\" and got a much better response from the audience; it became a permanent feature of his act and comedic persona."
