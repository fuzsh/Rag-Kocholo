Jacob Rodney Cohen, better known by his stage name Rodney Dangerfield, was an American actor, voice actor, stand-up comedian, author, producer, and screenwriter, who was best known for his catchphrase: "I don't get no respect!" and his monologues on that theme. A couple of his most famous roles were Al Czervik in the 1980 sports comedy film Caddyshack, and as the voice of the titular dog character (a parody of himself) of the 1991 Warner Bros. animated comedy film Rover Dangerfield (in which his notable catchphrase was heard in both films).

For Disney, he notably voiced Max the dog in the Disney Channel Phil of the Future episode "Doggie Daycare". He was also spoofed by Genie from the 1992 film Aladdin and Chameleon from The Mighty Ducks.

Dangerfield was born Jacob Rodney Cohen in Deer Park, New York. He was the son of Jewish parents Dorothy "Dotty" Teitelbaum and the vaudevillian performer Phillip Cohen, whose stage name was also Phil Roy. His mother was born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Phillip Cohen was rarely home; his son normally saw him only twice a year. Late in life, Cohen begged for, and received, his son's forgiveness. Dangerfield's mother was cruel and cold to him his entire life. Throughout his childhood she never kissed or hugged him or showed him any sign of affection. In an interview with Howard Stern on May 25, 2004, Dangerfield told Stern that he had been molested by a man in his neighborhood. The man would pay Rodney a nickel and kiss him for five minutes. After Cohen's father abandoned the family, his mother moved him and his sister to Kew Gardens, Queens, where Dangerfield attended Richmond Hill High School, graduating in 1939. To support himself and his family, he delivered groceries and sold newspapers and ice cream at the beach.
