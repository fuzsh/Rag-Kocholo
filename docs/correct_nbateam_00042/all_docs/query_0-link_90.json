        "text": "Kwame Brown, the former No. 1 overall draft pick, is facing yet another setback.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors announced Thursday that Brown will undergo surgery for a torn pectoralis major muscle. The San Francisco Chronicle is reporting that the injury is expected to sideline Brown for at least three months.\n\nBrown, who signed a free agent deal with Golden State in the offseason, has appeared in nine games for the team. He's averaging 6.3 points and 6.3 rebounds per game, right along his career average (6.8 points, 5.6 rebounds.)\n\nBrown, who was selected by Michael Jordan's Wizards in 2001, has never managed to meet expectations or stay healthy (he had missed 233 games entering this season) over his 11-year NBA career, earning him a label as one of the greatest busts in history. He averaged a career-high 10.9 points and 7.4 rebounds during the 2003-04 season, but was traded by Washington just a season later. He's been a nomad since, playing for five teams since the 2005-06 season."
