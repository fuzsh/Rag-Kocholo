        "text": "Kwame Brown is no longer expected to live up to the hype of being a no. 1 pick, but he will have to do what he's proven he can do - defend. And that's all the Warriors will ask him to do after signing him to a one-year, $7 million dollar deal.\n\nAs Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski pointed out in a tweet, Brown gives the Warriors something that new head coach Mark Jackson is looking for which is a defender. He won't score outside of putbacks, layups and dunks but he has proven to be a great post defender who can guard low-post threats one-on-one. The Warriors aren't exactly known as defensive stalwarts as a unit, so this is just another signing to help change the culture of the team heading into Jackson's first season.\n\nBrown has career averages of 6.8 points and 5.6 rebounds per game in a 10-year career with five teams. His best season came in 2003-2004 when he averaged 10.9 points and 7.5 rebounds per game for the Washington Wizards."
