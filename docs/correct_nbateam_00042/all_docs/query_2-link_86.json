        "text": "BRUNSWICK - Joyce Brown, mother of NBA basketball player Kwame Brown of Brunswick, died Monday morning of apparent natural causes, Glynn County authorities said. She was 61.\n\nShe was pronounced dead shortly after 8 a.m. at Southeast Georgia Health System's Brunswick hospital, said county Coroner Jimmy Durden.\n\n\"The preliminary investigation indicates she died of natural causes. There is no indication of foul play,\" Durden said.\n\nWhile raising Kwame and his siblings, she suffered from high blood pressure, lost a kidney to disease and eventually went on disability with a bad back.\n\nGeorgia Bureau of Investigation officials said family members found Brown unresponsive Monday morning and called 911. She was rushed to the hospital from her home in the 300 block of Oak Grove Island Drive, Durden said.\n\nAn autopsy will be performed Tuesday, but she had no visible injuries and there was no indication of forced entry or other problems at her home, said Mike McDaniel, special agent in charge of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation office in Kingsland.\n\nMcDaniel said county police officials asked the GBI to handle the death investigation because its detectives are tied up with the weekend slayings of eight people in a mobile home at the opposite side of Brunswick.\n\nKwame Brown, the NBA No. 1 draft pick in 2001, is a center for the Detroit Pistons."
