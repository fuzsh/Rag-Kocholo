        "text": "Bronny James has got the eyes of the whole basketball world on him right now as he embarks on his first season in the NBA, with everyone knowing that he is the son of the great LeBron James.\n\nHe has now played for the Lakers for the first time and he did not show what he is really capable of, which has got people talking.\n\nShooting 0% from the 3-point line and 0% from FT, he also suffered an injury that sidelined him from the second game.\n\nKwame Brown takes aim at Bronny and LeBron\n\nThis underwhelming debut display was enough for Kwame Brown to form an opinion as he remarked: \"Bronny James don't seem to have that dog in him.\"\n\nGiven Brown never quite lived up to the early hype that came with being the No.1 draft pick in 2001, he knows a thing or two about being a young player with a lot of pressure.\n\n\"I'm Bronny James, that's the attitude you supposed to have. You coming in here with this nice guy bullsh** that ain't going to work,\" Brown said on Kwame Brown Bust Life and went on to say that his father's statement made it difficult for Bronny.\n\n\"Your daddy talked a lot of stuff, Bronny. And unfortunately because of what your daddy said, we in the media going to be critiquing you.\n\n\"I think your poor dear daddy set your a** up because he's so busy chasing legacy that he don't know he going to destroy you.\""
