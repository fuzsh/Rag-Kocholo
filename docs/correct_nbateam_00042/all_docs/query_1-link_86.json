        "text": "Kwame Brown is a former NBA player who spent 12 years in the league. He retired in 2013, after playing for Washington Wizards, Los Angeles Lakers, Memphis Grizzlies, Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Bobcats, Golden State Warriors, and Philadelphia 76ers. He was a powerful center in his day. Brown had a pretty decent career, having played in the NBA playoffs four times.\n\nKendrick Perkins is also a former NBA player who spent more time than Kwame with a career that lasted for 14 years. He retired in 2018, having played for four different franchises. He also played center for the Boston Celtics, Oklahoma City Thunder, Cleveland Cavaliers, and New Orleans Pelicans. Kendrick won 1 championship with the Celtics in 2008.\n\nHere is one highlight from their playing days.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nKwame Brown smashes Kendrick Perkins’ claims\n\nKendrick Perkins recently tweeted giving his opinion on what trade was the worst trade ever.\n\nHe said that according to him, the trade of Kwame and wrongly spelled “Paul” (Pau) Gasol were the worst trades in history.\n\nALSO READ: Kwame bashes Joe Rogan.\n\nThis led to an obvious reaction from the former Lakers center Brown. A video surfaced where he ranted about Kendrick, practically intending to insult every living fiber in Kendrick’s body. He used, let’s say, pretty harsh language to make his point. Decently putting it, he obviously disagreed with Kendrick’s claim.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“Mo********** looked like he needed an inhaler to get to the refrigerator. You got bigger sh** to be worried about talking about the worst trade, mo********** you got the worst cholesterol, you got the worst blood pressure. Mo********** we about the same goddamn age and you look like three times the size of me boy… poke you in the stomach like a Pillsbury Doughboy..” said Kwame, attacking back.\n\nWATCH: LeBron James was straight up mean to Kwame.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“Getting up there talking sports and looking like you can’t even goddamn walk!” Kwame continued. He also said, “You got bigger sh** to worry about like your health and whatever the f*** LeBron tell you to say to me.” hinting that he thinks Perkins said all this under the influence of LeBron.\n\nA heated banter between two former players. Fans’ endless entertainment off the court."
