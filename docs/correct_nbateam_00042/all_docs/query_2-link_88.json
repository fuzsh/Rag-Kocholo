        "text": "Former No. 1 overall pick Kwame Brown inked a one-year deal worth $7 million with Golden State for ’11-12, and while his role is yet to be determined, the ten-year NBA veteran (that’s incredible to type) isn’t shy about playing up his strengths, which he deems to be his physicality and defensive presence. Brown told the San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday, among other things, that he’s grown since his rookie season because “My kids can Google now.” And he went on to talk about some guys he loves matching up with in today’s NBA: “I think a lot of people give credit to numbers and guys who block shots. I don’t get a lot of blocked shots, but every guy that I play against feels me every second of every game. Just as much as Dwight gives, I give back. I love playing against him. He’s physical. I love playing against Shaq and Andrew [Bynum]. That’s just what I like to do: mix it up.”"
