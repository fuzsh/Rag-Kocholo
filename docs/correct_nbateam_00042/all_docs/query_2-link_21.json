        "text": "Kwame Brown was drafted in 2001 by Micheal Jordan during his tenure as the President of Basketball Operations for the Washington Wizards. Kwame averaged around 7 points a game during his 12 year NBA career, mostly as a journey man having played for 7 teams in total.\n\nVarious media personalities have labeled Kwame as a ‘bust’, stating that he has never lived up to his expectations as a highly touted number 1 overall pick. The most notable of them is none other than Stephen A. Smith of ESPN, who has spear headed this sentiment for nearly 20 years.\n\nThere is what seems like endless footage of Smith on YouTube during his show ‘First Take’ (formally known as ‘Cold Pizza’) calling Kwame one of the biggest disappointments in NBA history, even attacking his character in the process. I can remember growing up watching Stephen A. on First Take and ‘Quite Frankly’ (another one of his shows), or making appearances on other ESPN shows like ‘Mike and Mike’ or ‘SportsCenter’, and seeing Stephen A. just randomly go off on Kwame’s lack of skill, even when the topic had nothing to do with Brown at all.\n\nSmith seemed to thoroughly enjoy blasting Brown’s abilities, or lack thereof on the hardwood, often mocking his ‘small hands’ and ‘slow feet’ and lack of post moves in the paint. This was rather alarming to me, giving that Kwame was only around seventeen years old when most of Smith’s attacks began, as Brown was drafted into the NBA fresh out of high school. I think that Smith’s criticism would have come off as less harsh if it was done out of a genuine effort to help the young man, as opposed to a clearly defined agenda to boost Smith’s own profile at ESPN and create a bigger name for himself.\n\nEven more shocking, was the silence of Brown during these attacks. There isn’t a single record of Kwame responding to Smith, or any other ‘reporters’ who included Brown as the butt of countless jokes and attacks over the past 20 years. I’ve always thought that showed a high level of character and resolve on Brown’s part.\n\nBut Kwame’s name was brought up on a recent episode of Showtime’s ‘All the Smoke’, which is hosted by former NBA veterans Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. The two were interviewing former NBA all-star Gilbert Arenas, and Jackson appeared to take a few shots at Brown, sarcastically saying that Barne’s called Kwame “one the greatest number 1 draft picks of all time”.\n\nWhen Brown got when of this, he took offense to it and went on a tirade. He lashed back out at Barne’s and Jackson on his own platform via YouTube, which I felt was understandable, being that Barne’s and Jackson weren’t really known as stand-out players during their time in the league.\n\nBarnes averaged 8 points per game while playing for around 10 different teamsduring the span of his 14-year career. Jackson was a more proficient scorer, at 15 points per game, while playing for 8 teams during a 14-year span.\n\nKwame’s rants weren’t limited to Barne’s and Jackson, he also had a few choice words for Stephen A. Smith, Jemele Hill, Charlamge the God, DJ Envy, Angela Yee, Rob Parker, and Chris Broussard among others.\n\nIn my opinion, I think that Kwame Brown is a much needed breath of fresh air for today’s ‘version’ of media, which is dominated and often bullied by celebrity personalities and talking heads who often pose as journalists and reporters.\n\nThere’s definitely a space for entertaining and charismatic characters like Kwame Brown, and other like-minded athletes that often don’t agree with the repetitive and tired narrative driven by most of the major sports media conglomerates today."
