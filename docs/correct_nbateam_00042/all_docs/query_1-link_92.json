        "text": "Free agent center Kwame Brown has agreed to terms on a one-year, $7 million contract with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAgent Mark Bartelstein says the offer in Golden State was \"too good to pass up.\"\n\nThe loss of Brown leaves the Bobcats with a hole at center. Gana Diop, who is coming off a torn Achilles tendon, is the only center on the Bobcats roster."
