        "text": "“I feel extremely bad for Kwame,” coach Mark Jackson said when the team announced the injury. “He had done absolutely everything that myself and our coaching staff had asked of him and quickly started to change this team’s image on the defensive end of the floor. If you look at the last week, in particular, he had some pretty impressive defensive performances, especially against some of the top scoring big men in the NBA. “This is a blow, but Kwame and the Warriors will recover and move forward. I know that he will work as hard as he can during rehabilitation.”\n\nGolden State Warriors backup center Kwame Brown is recovering from surgery on his chest muscle that will likely sideline the former No. 1 overall pick for the rest of the season. The procedure to repair his right pectoralis major was performed Wednesday by Dr. Neal ElAttrache at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthpaedic Clinic in Los Angeles. The large chest muscle attaches to the right shoulder.\n\nWith center Kwame Brown likely out for the season, the Warriors are back on the market for a big man. Only this time, the options are even skimpier. Thursday, Golden State announced Brown will have to undergo surgery to repair a torn pectoralis major (the large chest muscle that attaches to his right shoulder). It is expected to keep him out at least three months, according to the Warriors. “It’s a tough loss,” coach Mark Jackson said. “This guy has done everything we have asked him to do. He’s brought toughness, a presence to this basketball team — it’s a tough loss for us. He was a jewel for us, a great find, and hopefully he’ll back soon with us soon and continue his great career.” Brown — who signed a one-year, $7 million deal just over a month ago — will have surgery in the next few days. General manager Larry Riley said the team won’t know for sure how long he’s out until after the surgery.\n\nKwame Brown will have to undergo surgery, the team announced today, that will keep him out at east three months. That puts Brown’s return well into April, barring no setbacks. The regular season ends for the Warriors on April 26. The MRI performed yesterday revealed a torn pectoralis major (the large chest muscle that attaches to his right shoulder). Surgery has not been scheduled, but it is expected in the next few day.\n\nNow we know who forged Andrew Bynum into the player he has become. Los Angeles Lakers fans can send thank-yous to Kwame Brown. That’s what Brown implied Friday after the Lakers beat Golden State. First, some reality. “He’s a grown man now,” Brown said of his former Lakers teammate. “He’s grown into his body well. He’s a lot more physical than when he first came in.”\n\nNBA player and former Laker Kwame Brown has sold his house in Playa del Rey for $1.65 million. The open-floor-plan house had been on and off the market since 2008 when it was listed for sale at $2.999 million or for lease at $12,000 a month. The current listing stated the home had sustained water damage on the main level and needed a new roof, windows, doors and elevator. Described as a short sale in the listing, the ocean-view contemporary includes four bedrooms and five bathrooms in 6,329 square feet. The breakfast bar can seat up to 10. The basement media room has a built-in projector, screen and a wet bar.\n\nThe reasoning behind the Warriors’ one-year, $7 million deal with Kwame Brown became pretty clear Wednesday when the 6-foot-11, 270-pound hulk of a man walked into the team’s training facility and started talking about banging and bruising opposing centers on the block. “I think a lot of people give credit to numbers and guys who block shots,” the 29-year-old said. “I don’t get a lot of blocked shots, but every guy that I play against feels me every second of every game. Just as much as Dwight (Howard) gives, I give back. I love playing against him. “I love playing against Shaq (O’Neal) and Andrew (Bynum). That’s just what I like to do: mix it up.”"
