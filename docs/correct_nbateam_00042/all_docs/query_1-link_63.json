        "text": "All seems to be well in the Golden State Warriors’ locker room as they move on from the Draymond Green-Jordan Poole incident. The Draymond Green and Jordan Poole altercation sent shockwaves around the world during the offseason. However, the Warriors have extended Poole’s contract amidst the chaos and they are now looking to start the regular season in peace. Former Warriors star Kwame Brown recently backed Draymond Green for punching Poole in the training session. However, Michael Jordan may have influenced Brown’s opinion on the altercation.\n\nFormer NBA star Kwame Brown spent 12 years in the NBA playing for several teams. He was a part of the Warriors roster in 2012-13 when they were building a championship team. However, he featured in just nine games and was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nREAD MORE: Ex-NBA Star Kwame Brown Backs Draymond Green for Punching Jordan Poole Citing 42-Year-Old Heat Legend: “Just to Slap Jimmy Butler and Whoever Else F*** Up”\n\nKwame Brown recently came to the defense of Draymond Green over the Poole altercation. He supported his argument by quoting an example of Udonis Haslem. He also said that teams need players like Green. However, Brown’s opinion on the topic may have been influenced by Michael Jordan, who had reportedly reduced him to tears on some occasions.\n\nMichael Jordan used to insult Kwame Brown during his Washington Wizards days\n\nA Sports Illustrated report from 2013 covered Jordan and Kwame’s interactions in the early 2000s. The report by L. Jon Wertheim called Jordan a ‘tormentor’ and many players came at the end of his aggressive speeches.\n\nL. Jon Wertheim reported: “As a leader Jordan proved more tormentor than mentor. Many Washington players got the business end of a Jordan harangue, but he designated second-year forward Kwame Brown as the whipping boy, referring to him, as reported by The Washington Post, as a “flaming f*gg*t.”A source told SI that Jordan ritually reduced Brown to tears in front of the team.”\n\nThe report also revealed that Jordan used to call Kwame Brown expletives. The Chicago Bulls legend also insulted other players from the Wizards team at that time. When Jordan became the GM, he continued the ritual of insulting the players.\n\nMichael Jordan’s ‘torment’ could have influenced Kwame Brown’s backing of Green\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBrown has already admitted that earlier these kinds of altercations were very common in the NBA. He gave the example of Udonis Haslem to support his argument.\n\nHowever, it may be noted that Brown was on the receiving end of insults during his time with the Washington Wizards. As stated by the report from L. Jon Wertheim, players were insulted by Jordan as teammates and later as their General Manager as well. Being on the receiving end, Brown’s support for Green punching Jordan Poole is not a surprise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWATCH THIS STORY: Mike Tyson, Who Once Almost Brawled With Michael Jordan in a Bar, Admits Unknown Fact About Their Connection\n\nDo you agree with Kwame Brown backing Green for his altercation with Poole?
