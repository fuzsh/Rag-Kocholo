        "text": "Welcome to the second edition of Last Week This Morning, a weekly NBA column that is supposed hit on all of the previous weeks top stories, but really just serves as a platform for me to talk about anything I want in the world of hoops.\n\nPlayoff T-Shirts\n\nI was working on Friday when a buddy of mine texted me about potentially heading in to the city (if you were paying attention last week, you would know that ‘the city’ is Boston) to catch Game 3 of Hawks – Celtics. He’s a Celtics fan, I am not, but I do enjoy Isaiah Thomas and Jonas Jerebko, plus I needed him to do me a favor (spring time = swapping the Jeep hard top out for the soft top, and it’s a two-man job), so after one final text he sent me showing that everyone in attendance would be receiving a free playoff T-Shirt courtesy of Arbella Insurance, I was in.\n\nOn the train ride in, I had expressed my interest in how the T-shirt thing would go down. Would I be scrambling to find a medium? Would they all be the same size? If they are the same size, what does Arbella Insurance consider the median size of Celtics fans? You know, the important stuff.\n\nI should also note that I had a good feeling about the Celtics in Game 3 once I heard that Brad Stevens was putting Jonas Jerebko and Evan Turner in the starting lineup. I have less affinity for Turner, but Jerebko is on my ‘does-stuff’ All-Star team. He’s always doing SOMETHING right, and while he doesn’t necessarily put up impressive numbers, whenever he’s on the court, going back to his Pistons days, that lineup just functions better. Ok, back to the T-shirts.\n\nI’d say we arrived about 40 or so minutes before tip-off, grabbed some food, and headed down to our seats. The arena was mostly empty, so I figured I’d have plenty of time to find the right size shirt and do a quick swaperoo before anyone noticed. Both of our seats had XL’s, mine came with a beer stain from the two dudes standing up behind us, so, lucky me.\n\nQuick tangent, the two drunk dudes were about my age (26) and at one point in the third quarter one of them said “this place is nothing like the old Gahden”, which made me laugh considering that building closed in 1995 and there is no way they could possibly know what it was like in there.\n\nT-shirts. I didn’t want the XL, or the beer stain, so I started hunting for that medium, but I would have happily settled for a large.\n\nHere’s the kicker, every shirt in the building was an extra large. Is that common practice around the NBA? What kind of message are they trying to send?\n\nI understand the ‘one size fits all’ approach. I’m sure they don’t want people like myself searching for the right size and screwing everything up, and I know it’s cheaper to mass-produce T-shirts if you stick to one size, but I thought it was bush league. Actually, I didn’t really care at all, but outrage equals clicks so consider myself thoroughly pissed. They were bad T-shirts anyway, but I’ve always been genuinely curious of how that free shirt ‘transaction’ goes down, and now it’s documented somewhere on the Internet, so my job here is done.\n\nKwame Brown Kid\n\nAs soon as ‘Kwame Brown Kid’ walked in, I forgot how dumb the T-shirt fiasco was.\n\nKwame Brown is a fun NBA joke. I’m sure there are thousands, if not millions of Crying Jordan Kwame Brown memes on the Internet, and for good reason!\n\nI can forgive someone for owning, and even wearing, a Washington Wizards Kwame Brown jersey. Jerseys are expensive; you kind of wear what you’ve got – case in point – I saw a Marquis Daniels Celtics jersey in the crowd. Totally acceptable! He was a decent rotation player on a few good Celtics team, I’ll allow it.\n\nWhy would someone ever own a Lakers Kwame Brown jersey, though, and why would you wear it to a Boston Celtics home playoff game?\n\nI can probably answer that second part, you wear it for attention, like the attention I am giving him, because I thought it was great. The crowd hated him, which I enjoyed. The ‘KWAAAAAAMEEEEEEE’ chant was something I could have never predicted on the train ride in, and for someone who didn’t really care who won, that is why live sporting events are worth going to.\n\nI screamed some rendition of ‘KWAAAAAAMEEEEEE’ for pretty close to four hours on Friday night. Five or six years ago, I would have bet A LOT of money against that ever happening, and not only did it happen – it made my night.\n\nBest-of-Five?\n\nIf you read the previous 800 or so words of nonsense, thank you. The truth is, that was the extent of my NBA thoughts this week. The first round of the NBA Playoffs has been quite bad, and largely uneventful. This is the sort of opening round that makes every ‘first round should be best-of-five’ argument relevant; even though I disagree that they should actually change the current format. Underwhelming, uneventful basketball is better than no basketball, but this is coming from a guy who has bought the Vegas Summer League package every year since it’s introduction. I’m not the best person to make a ruling on this.\n\nHack-A-Whatever\n\nMark Cuban made some comments to the effect of ‘if Adam Silver thinks that they should change the ‘Hack-A-Shaq’ rule, he is absolutely wrong’ earlier this week, and while I don’t necessarily agree with Cuban often, I’m with him on this one.\n\nOn the theoretical list of ‘things that are making basketball less fun’, the intentional fouling stuff is pretty far down. How about tackling how ridiculously long video reviews take? How about a real attempt to de-incentivize flopping? How about changing the one-and-done rule?\n\nI don’t mind watching poor free throw shooters shoot free throws. I actually find DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard at the line awkwardly entertaining. It’s cringe worthy in a can’t-look-away, Michael Scott just said something slightly offensive to Toby Flenderson kind of way. I’m in to it.\n\nBeing able to poke fun at ‘that guy who can’t shoot free throws’ has been part of the NBA framework my entire life. I’m not ready to give that up."
