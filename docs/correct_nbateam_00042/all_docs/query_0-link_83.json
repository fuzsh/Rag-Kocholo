        "text": "Before the Golden State Warriors are on the clock with the No. 2 overall selection next month, Warriors Wire is rewinding through Golden State’s draft history to highlight some of the most memorable picks — trades, surprises, busts, sleepers and everything in between.\n\nIn the 2001 NBA Draft, the Golden State Warriors were busy with three picks, including two in the top 14 selections. After bringing Michigan State’s Jason Richardson to their wing unit at No. 5, the Warriors were eyeing a prospect that could fit the frontcourt with the No. 14 overall pick in the draft.\n\nJune 27, 2001\n\nWith the first overall pick, the Washington Wizards started the 2001 draft by selecting Kwame Brown out of Georgia’s Glynn Academy. Just four picks later, the Warriors drafted the high-flying Richardson with the No. 5 selection.\n\nBrian Winters and Garry St. Jean’s night wasn’t over after the top five. The Golden State Warriors were back on the clock near the end of the lottery. With the No. 14 pick in the 2001 draft, the Warriors landed Troy Murphy out of Notre Dame.\n\nDuring his three seasons in South Bend, Murphy never averaged below 19.2 points and 9.2 rebounds in his college career. Murphy tallied 21.8 points on 47.1% from the field in his junior season with 9.2 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per contest.\n\nDespite his solid numbers, Murphy performed slightly better as a sophomore. In the 1999-2000 season, the 6-foot-11 big man recorded 22.7 points on 49.2 % shooting from the field with 10.3 boards and 1.0 blocks per contest.\n\nIn his final two seasons at Notre Dame, Murphy earned a bevy of accolades, including Consensus First Team All-American and Big East Player of the Year. Murphy earned the honors in back-to-back seasons as a sophomore and junior. In 2016, Murphy was inducted into Notre Dame’s Ring of Honor.\n\nAs a rookie, Murphy started slowly with Golden State, averaging 5.9 points on 42.7% shooting from the field with 3.9 rebounds in 17.1 minutes per game. Despite his underwhelming rookie season, Murphy broke out in his second year in the Bay Area.\n\nMurphy finished second in the NBA’s Most Improved Player award, registering 11.7 points on 45.1% shooting from the field with 10.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game. Murphy went on to average a double-double in three out of his six seasons in Golden State.\n\nIn 2007, the Warriors included Murphy in an eight-player trade with the Indiana Pacers that landed the Warriors Stephen Jackson and Al Harrington.\n\nAfter his time in Indiana, the Notre Dame product went on to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, New Jersey Nets, Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks in his 13-year career in the association."
