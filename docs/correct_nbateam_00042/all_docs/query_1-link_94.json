        "text": "Golden State Warriors backup centre Kwame Brown is recovering from surgery on his chest muscle that will likely sideline the former No. 1 overall pick for the rest of the season.\n\nThe procedure to repair his right pectoralis major was performed Wednesday by Dr. Neal ElAttrache at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthpaedic Clinic in Los Angeles. The large chest muscle attaches to the right shoulder.\n\nBrown will remain in Southern California doing rehab before returning to the Bay Area next week. The Warriors say the injury will sideline Brown at least three months.\n\nHe was injured in a victory over the Miami Heat on Jan. 10. In nine games this season, Brown averaged 6.3 points and 6.3 rebounds in 20.8 minutes.\n\nThe Washington Wizards selected Brown with the top pick in 2001."
