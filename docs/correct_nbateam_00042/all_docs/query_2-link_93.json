        "text": "If you thought Kwame Brown’s career ended too soon and he still had something to offer the game of basketball, today is your lucky day. The agency that represents Brown announced on Monday that he’s ready to give it another shot:\n\nInterperformances is proud to announce that the NBA star Kwame Brown decided to sign with our agency. The #1 overall pick of the 2001 draft is ready for a new life. His comeback can be the road to glory for a team that believes in him. Kwame is back, physically healthy and ready to be the outstanding player he was on several NBA teams.\n\nA great intimidator that can block shots , rebound consistently and explode in devastating dunks. No longer the young man that entered the NBA, Kwame is now an experienced and mature player and man. And he’s back, for the love of the game.\n\nSay what you want about Kwame Brown’s career and how he didn’t live up to expectations in Washington, but the man carved out a fairly decent career for himself. If he can still get a team to pay him to play basketball in the year 2016, all the more power to him.\n\nConsidering we’re already over halfway through the NBA offseason, Brown’s announcement is probably more about getting the attention of teams overseas than NBA squads. It’s hard to imagine Brown would even get a training camp invite from an NBA team unless he has a really impressive workout to show he can still play at an NBA level. But at the same time, Kwame Brown has been known to underwhelm after an impressive workout, so that might not be the best way to evaluate him.\n\nAll kidding aside, hopefully things work out for Kwame. After everything he’s had to put up with in his NBA career, it would be nice to see him get a chance to craft his own ending to his basketball career, and one that hopefully ends on a bright note."
