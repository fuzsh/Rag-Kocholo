I guess the Warriors front office and new ownership really thought Kwame was overpaid last season at $1.2 million.\n\n(Wait, didn't the NBA just have a lockout because the owners were upset about all the foolish contracts they handed out?)\n\nWell the goal here isn't to pretend like this is a BIG, fascinating move for the Warriors. It's to start a dialogue about which of these two should be starting at the 5 spot for the Warriors now. (Shoot, if it was my call I would have amnestied Biedrins and donated that $7 million to the Bring Back Thunder foundation, but we have to live within the real world hoops constraints.)\n\nIf I had to pick between the two, I'd go with... actually who am I kidding?\n\nYou know, I thought Chris Cohan sold the Warriors over a year ago."
