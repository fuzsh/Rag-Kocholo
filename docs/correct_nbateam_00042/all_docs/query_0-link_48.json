        "text": "Get well, Kwame. Nine games and $7 million in your pocket. Via Warriors press release: “Results of an MRI performed yesterday on Golden State Warriors center Kwame Brown revealed a torn pectoralis major (the large chest muscle that attaches to his right shoulder), which will require him to undergo surgery within the next few days, the team announced today. The surgery, which has not yet been scheduled, is expected to keep him out for a minimum of three months. ‘Obviously, we’re very disappointed, especially for Kwame, who was playing extremely well and had worked diligently since his arrival,’ said Larry Riley, the team’s Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations/General Manager. ‘In a short time, he had proven to be the anchor to our low post defense and certainly lived up to his reputation as one of the top interior defenders in the NBA. He had provided us a big, physical presence in the middle, which is something that we’ve lacked in the past. Unfortunately, surgery of this nature typically requires, approximately, a three-month recovery period.'”"
