CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Free agent center Kwame Brown has agreed to terms on a one-year, $7 million contract with the Golden State Warriors.

Agent Mark Bartelstein says the offer in Golden State was "too good to pass up."

The loss of Brown leaves the Bobcats with a hole at center. Gana Diop, who is coming off a torn Achilles tendon, is the only center on the Bobcats roster.

Bartelstein says Brown is "extremely grateful" for the opportunity the Bobcats gave him, adding that "it was a huge step to come back and play for Michael."
