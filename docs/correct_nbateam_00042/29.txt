The Golden State Warriors have signed free-agent centre Kwame Brown to a $7-million US, one-year deal.

The well-travelled Brown, who spent last season with Charlotte and joins his sixth NBA team, will give new coach Mark Jackson depth at the centre spot alongside Andris Biedrins.

The 29-year-old Brown, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 draft by the Washington Wizards, averaged 7.9 points and 6.8 rebounds in 66 games with 50 starts last season while shooting 51.7 per cent from the floor.
