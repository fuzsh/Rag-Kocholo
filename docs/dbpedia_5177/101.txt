William Russell, Lord Russell (born Sept. 29, 1639—died July 21, 1683, London, Eng.) was an English Whig politician executed for allegedly plotting to murder King Charles II and his Roman Catholic brother James, Duke of York. Because the charges against Russell were never conclusively proved, he was lauded as a martyr by the Whigs, who claimed that he was put to death in retaliation for his efforts to exclude James from succession to the throne.

Born the third son of the 5th Earl (later 1st Duke) of Bedford, he survived his elder brothers to acquire, as heir, the courtesy title of Lord Russell in 1678. He sat in the House of Commons in all the Parliaments held during Charles II’s reign, from 1660 on. About 1673 he joined the opposition to Charles’s pro-French policies. Titus Oates’s fabricated allegations (1678) of a “Popish Plot” to seize power convinced Russell of an imminent Roman Catholic threat to English Protestantism. By 1680 Russell, a close associate of the Duke of Monmouth, was leading the fight in the Commons to exclude James from the succession. But Charles defeated the exclusion movement by dissolving Parliament (March 1681), and Russell then withdrew from public life.
