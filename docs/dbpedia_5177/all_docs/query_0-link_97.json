        "text": "PREFACE\n\nThis bibliography began as an Urban University Project to access the primary source materials extant on the Ohio & Erie Canal. As the search progressed, it became apparent that no reference guide existed that listed the primary or secondary sources for the Ohio & Erie Canal or any other Ohio canal. Throughout my research, I was encouraged by Dr. Elizabeth Mancke and Dr. Lynn Metzger, project advisors, to expand my scope to include secondary sources of other states canal systems and to find studies that placed the Ohio & Erie Canal and other Ohio canals into a larger \"Transportation Revolution\" context. Our goal was to produce a bibliography that would serve as a scholarly reference guide to Ohio canals where none previously existed. I believe we have succeeded.\n\nThe major objective was to discern what primary source materials exist for the Ohio & Erie Canal. As you will discover, there are rich historical resources in both the Ohio Historical Society and the Western Reserve Historical Society. I have also included the Barberton Public Library and Stark and Wayne County Historical Societies because of their copious files of newspaper clippings. A vertical file of clipped newspaper articles can save a researcher hours, if not days, of endless searching through rolls of microfilm.\n\nTime restraints limited the scope of materials included in the bibliography. Along with the Ohio canal systems, I incorporated information on canals in New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and the Old Northwest (Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin). With the exception of the primary source section for Ohio, all of the works cited are secondary and are accessible at the University of Akron's Bierce Library or through Ohio Link's inter-library loan.\n\nIt was also necessary to limit the type of entries included in the bibliography. I used judicious discretion in citing engineering studies about canals while listing nearly all of the works available on the social impacts of canals. With regard to periodicals, I decided not to include the Canal Society of Ohio's Towpaths or the American Canal Society's American Canals. Although both contain useful information, their distribution range is limited, which makes access for researchers difficult. Many of the journals cited are subscribed to by most major research libraries and are readily available.\n\nFinally, this compilation is by no means a definitive bibliography of the Ohio & Erie or any other canal system. But, I hope my research will aid scholars, students, researchers, and other individuals who seek additional information concerning canals. There may be a future opportunity to revise and expand this study to include other historical repositories as well as an index with cross-referencing and limited annotation. I truly hope this revision occurs, but until then, enjoy the following information.\n\nSam Tamburro\n\nPainesville, Ohio\n\nOHIO\n\nThe Barberton Public Library\n\n602 West Park Avenue\n\nBarberton, Ohio 44203\n\nAkron: New Portage to Old Portage.
