HIBBS\n\nPortrait found between pages 432 & 433 in History of Lower Scioto Co., Ohio - Publ. Chicago: Inter-state Publishing Co. 1884\n\nGENERAL JOSEPH L. HIBBS, merchant, Portsmouth, Ohio, was born in Scioto County, Ohio, April 8, 1819, and is a son of Jacob and Rebecca Hibbs nee Lucas. His mother was a daughter of Judge Joseph Lucas, a brother of the late Robert Lucas, Governor of Ohio, and Iowa two terms each. Wm. Lucas, father of Joseph and Robert, was in the army under Washington at Braddock's defeat, and also served as Captain in the war of the Rebellion. He afterward emigrated with his family from Virginia and located in Scioto County, at a place known since as Lucasville. Edward Lucas, fore-father of the Virginia Lucases, and his wife, nee Dark, of Quaker descent, came to this country with William Penn, and first settled in Berks County, Penn., and afterward the family removed to Virginia, where they became quite noted. The great-grandfather of the subject of this sketch, Aaron Hibbs, emigrated from England to America Soon after the Revolutionary war, and Jacob Hibbs, the father of Joseph, was among those who were called out in the war of 1812, in defense of Detroit. When Joseph had reached the age of eighteen his father gave him three years of his time, and the young man started for himself with the trade of carpenter, which he had acquired at odd spells at home during his younger days. This business he followed very successfully for five years, during the first three of which he cleared $500, besides attending school four months. He was a studious boy, and assiduously devoted his spare time to the acquisition of useful knowledge, being particularly interested in historical works, devoting much of his spare time to reading of ancient, profane and religious history. These books he read with pleasure, and, unlike many other boys, he had no time to devote to books pertaining to romance or fiction. For several years subsequent to his carpenter business he was successfully engaged in farming and other pursuits, as manager for prominent persons in Pike County, Ohio. In 1851 he became clerk in a business house in Portsmouth; and in 1853, with what money he had accumulated, he embarked in the hardware business, in copartnership with Mr. George Hered. In 1859 he bought out Mr. Hered's interest, and to this day has continued the business successfully in his own name, and takes rank among the oldest hardware merchants of the State. During the war of the Rebellion Mr. Hibbs was commissioned by Governor Tod as Brigadier-General Wright, Quartermaster-General of the State. In 1866 he started a boot, shoe, and hat store, which, ten years later, he consolidated with his hardware business which has resulted in great success. In the summer of 1875, his health having become impaired by intense application to business he took a trip South during the following winter, in hopes of regaining his lost vigor, and visited Nashville, Chattanooga, Atlanta, Augusta, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, and other places of note, including Florida State Fair. Early in the year 1877, finding that he was but little improved in health, he withdrew from active participation in business, and took up his residence in New York City, spending a few days at Washington, District of Columbia, on his way, when the Electoral Commission was considering the validity of President Hayes's title to the Presidency, and remained until he was inaugurated. Sine then General Hibbs has made his home in New York City, where he attends to the purchasing of goods for his Portsmouth houses and other houses, as orders are sent to him by his friends. In 1879, while in New York City, he sold for the commissioners of Scioto County $40,000 of six per cent, county bonds, at a premium, and visited the United States Sub-treasury vaults and the leading banks of the city. In December of the year 1877 he went to California by the way of the Isthmus, and spent several months in visiting places of note and interest on the pacific Coast, among which were San Francisco, Oakland, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, San Jose, Santa Cruz, Calaveras, Grove of Big Trees, and the gorgeous and picturesque scenery of the Yosemite Valley. As illustrative of the character of that climate, it may be stated that on the first day of May, 1878, when the valleys were fragrant with flowers, and the figs nearly grown, General Hibbs rode on horseback a distance of fourteen miles over huge mountains of snow on his way to the valley, the thermometer registering seventy degrees. The scenery of the valley at this time was especially awe-inspiring, and picturesque to the sublimest extent. The various waterfalls, some of them 2,600 feet high, were at their highest state and greatest force, caused by the rapidly melting snow, and presented a view inexpressibly grand and sublime. The General also visited Sacramento, Salt Lake City, the great Mormon Tabernacle, Camp Douglas, and the tomb of Brigham Young, visiting on his return eastward Des Moines, Iowa City, Muscatine and Freeport, where he spent some time among his friends who had removed West several years previous. He refers to his trips with much enthusiasm, and looks upon the time spent in this way as the most interesting and enjoyable portion of his life. General Hibbs has taken a deep interest in public enterprises and in church matters, and has contributed largely of his means for their support. In many other ways he is benevolent and public-spirited, doing much toward promoting the growth and prosperity of his adopted city. He possesses all the elements of a capital business man, and has good judgment of men and things. He is cautious, firm, and conscientious, and as a business man stands among the best of Portsmouth. By industry, frugality and keen foresight he has been rewarded with very gratifying success.\n\n~ Page 267 - History of Lower Scioto Co., Ohio - Publ. Chicago: Inter-state Publishing Co. 1884 JOHN W.
