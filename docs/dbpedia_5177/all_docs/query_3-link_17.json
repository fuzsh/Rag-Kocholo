In the series, he performed alongside Jacqueline Hill, who played fellow teacher Barbara Wright, and Carole Ann Ford, who portrayed companion Susan.\n\nWhile Russell left the show alongside Hill in 1965, he remained in the wider Whoniverse, appearing in various audio stories.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctor Who fans say the same thing about 'sublime' Black Mirror-esque episode\n\nRussell then went on to earn a Guinness World Record for the longest gap between TV appearances when he returned to the show in 2022.\n\nAn astonishing 57 years later, he guest-starred alongside Jodie Whittaker in her final episode, The Power of the Doctor.\n\nConfirming the incredible achievement, Guinness World Records announced: “The longest gap between TV appearances is 57 years 120 days, and was achieved by William Russell (UK) as the Doctor Who character Ian Chesterton in The Power of the Doctor episode, which aired on 23rd October 2022.”\n\nFollowing the sad news of the esteemed actor's death, tributes have been pouring in from fans all over the world.\n\nDon't miss...\n\nOutnumbered's Claire Skinner's life from unexpected romance to Doctor Who role [NEWS]\n\nBBC Doctor Who fans react to 'terrifying' episode as Millie Gibson carries show [LATEST]\n\nDoctor Who viewers say the same thing about 'emotionally devastating' episode [INSIGHT]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

What a wonderful man with a delightful family an extraordinary life & career.\n\n\"The most charming smile and twinkling eyes, he always lit up the room. I hope there will be many celebrations of this beautiful man. #RIPWilliamRussell.\" (sic)\n\nAnother penned: \"R.I.P. William Russell, part of the original cast of #DoctorWho when it first started in 1963 as the heroic school-teacher Ian.\n\n\"Safe to say, he was the show's first 'main character' and it's been wonderful to see him revisit the role over the past 60 years.\" (sic)\n\nA third fan tweeted: \"Raising a glass to William Russell, who has left us just a few months shy of his 100th birthday.\n\n\"Already a star when he became a crucial part of Doctor Who’s genesis, his long and remarkable career embraced everything from Shakespeare to Blackadder. A fine actor and a lovely man.\" (sic)\n\nOne more person sweetly added: \"I like to think the Doctor kept that Time-Space Visualiser. Maybe when he's sad or lonely, he switches on his weird space telly and watches what his friends are up to.\n\n\"Just like how, on mine, William Russell's always about to go on another adventure, forever.\" (sic)\n\nAside from his landmark stint on Doctor Who, Russell has also made an impact in many other roles, including when he played the titular character from 1956's The Adventures of Sir Lancelot and when he appeared as Ted Sullivan in Coronation Street in 1992.\n\nHe also starred in several films, including The Man Who Never Was (1956), The Great Escape (1963) and Superman (1978)."
