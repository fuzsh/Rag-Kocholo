        "text": "*Update* A funeral service will be held at 2pm on Saturday August 7th, 2021, at the Forest Hill Cemetry, with Gary Gray officiating. A reception will follow at 8 Arlington Street, in Lincoln, NB, at 3pm, for all that would like to attend.\n\nIt is with great sadness and heavy hearts that the family announces the sudden passing of William (Bill) Carleton Russell, who left us on February 11th, 2021, at the Saint John Regional Hospital. Born August 29, 1969 in Fredericton, he is predeceased by his father Van Carleton Russell of Halifax NS, and survived by his loving wife, soulmate, and best friend of 28 years, Margaret Lee (Munsie) Russell.\n\nHe will be lovingly remembered by his children Alannah Russell (Julien), Vanessa Russell (Brandon), and Spencer Russell; Adored grandson Ellis; Mother Deanna Marlene (Clark) McInnis; Stepfather Sylvester (Bet) McInnis, and brothers Stephen Russell, and Van Russell.\n\nBill loved the Beatles, the Blue Jays, his weekly sleepovers with Ellis, Star Wars, and all things superheroes. His most favorite thing of all was his family.\n\nThe family wishes to thank everyone who has sent their love and support during this heartbreaking time, and the doctors and nurses at both the DECH and the SJRH for doing everything they could. We lost an amazing husband, father, grampie, and son far too soon.\n\nFor those who wish, Donations in Billâ€™s memory can be made to the charity of your choice. Online condolences may be made at www.bishopsfuneralhome.com\n\nwww.bishopsfuneralhome.com"
