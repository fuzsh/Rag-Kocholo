        "text": "William Russell has died at the age of 99, it's been confirmed.\n\nThe late actor was part of the original series of Doctor Who cast in 1963 and even returned to the show for a cameo in 2022 - breaking a TV record in the process.\n\nRussell first rose to fame in the ITV series The Adventures of Sir Lancelot back in 1956. He enjoyed a acclaimed career on both stage and screen and worked for decades, with his most famous role being Ian Chesterton opposite Doctor Who's William Hartnell in the BBC series very first episode back in 1965.\n\nThe late actor returned to the role in 2022, to send Jodie Whittaker off in style as she enjoyed one last stint as The Doctor, and reprised his role of Ian 57 years on from first appearing on the sci-fi show. Ian, a science teacher, was a companion of the very first Doctor, portrayed by William Hartnell from November 1963 until October 1966.\n\nThroughout his initial time on Doctor Who in the 60s, featuring in 77 episodes across the first two series, Russell returned to play his role again 57 years later for Jodie's grand exit towards the end of 2022. Not only did Russell's triumphant return thrill fans, but he clinched a spot in The Guinness Book of Records along the way.\n\nThe actor boasts the record for the most prolonged gap between TV appearances, owing to the 57-year and 120-day hiatus between his most recent performances as The Doctor's companion Ian. On the 59th anniversary of the BBC show, they confirmed: \"The longest gap between TV appearances is 57 years 120 days, and was achieved by William Russell (UK) as the Doctor Who character Ian Chesterton in the 'The Power of the Doctor' episode, which aired on 23 October 2022.\"\n\nRussell's return to Doctor Who has snatched the record from Coronation Street's Philip Lowrie, who previously held the title for his comeback as Dennis Tanner after a 43-year hiatus. He played Ted Sullivan in Coronation Street and also held roles in The Great Escape and 1978 film Superman. The actor played a recurring role as Tom Preston in Harriet’s Back In Town and more recently appeared in an episode of Agatha Christie: Poirot.\n\nAccording the the Radio Times, Russell passed away on Monday 3rd June. He is survived by his three children, Robert, Laetitia and Vanessa, from his first marriage to Balbina Gutierrez and his son Alfred, whom he shared with his second wife Etheline Margareth Lewis Enoch. The actor also had four grandchildren - James, Elise, Amy and Ayo.\n\nAlfred Enoch followed in his dad's acting footsteps as he played Dean Thomas in the Harry Potter film franchise. Fans have paid tribute to William on social media as one said: \"What sad news to say farewell to William Russell. What a wonderful man with a delightful family an extraordinary life & career. The most charming smile and twinkling eyes, he always lit up the room. I hope there will be many celebrations of this beautiful man.\"\n\nActor and writer Nicholas Pegg added: \"Raising a glass to William Russell, who has left us just a few months shy of his 100th birthday. Already a star when he became a crucial part of Doctor Who’s genesis, his long and remarkable career embraced everything from Shakespeare to Blackadder. A fine actor and a lovely man.\"\n\nDoctor Who's Russell T Davies shared a tribute on Instagram alongside a photo of him with William. He wrote: \"William Russell (1924-2024). What a sad loss, William played the Doctor’s very first companion, Ian Chesterton, back in 1963. A schoolteacher, trapped on the Tardis by a wily old Doctor, unable to get home, whisked off to the Stone Age, Skaro, the Crusades, planet of the Zarbi..! Wonderful! A fine, nimble, witty, heartfelt actor who absolutely sold the truth of those early years. Before that, he’d been Sir Lancelot on the BBC; it’s often undersold what a star booking he was for Doctor Who.\n\n\"He later went on to marry Rita Fairclough as Ted Sullivan on Coronation Street. In the photo, I bumped into him on a train in 2018! I was star-struck! He spoke with so much pride and joy about his son, Alfred Enoch, who I’d seen in King Lear at the Royal Exchange. Absolutely lovely man. A fine, long life. Well done, sir, well played.\"\n\nArtist Stuart Humphryes shared: \"R.I.P. The late and legendary actor William Russell (1924-2024). He was the first and the greatest of all the many companions who starred in Doctor Who. He first played Ian Chesterton in 1963 and last returned to the series to play him in 2022, earning him a Guiness Book of Records award. A wonderful innings, yet still immensely sad - It is the passing of an era and also of a hero. Sleep well, Sir Ian, Knight of Jaffa. I was one of your biggest fans.\" Russell would have marked his 100th birthday in November, having been born in Sunderland in 1924."
