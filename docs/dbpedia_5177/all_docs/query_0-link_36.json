William died in DEC 1808 and left a will probated 6 DEC 1808 by SciotoProbated Court, with Sarah Shutt Executrix. The will provides and inventory of all of William's assets, including all his tools as a wagon maker and animals valued at $525. He left land in NJ and OH to James, Richard and Stepson Joseph Heritage that he had purchased from his wifes father. With the remainder left to a wife Sarah Heritage Carpenter Shutt (Shute) and daughter Sarah Ann (age UNK). There was a guardianship probated in 4 APR 1809, that appointed a Thomas Gilruth as guardian for Richard, since he was only 16 yrs of age. During war of 1812 Richard traveled up the Wabash River Valley as far as Tippicanoe. He liked the lay of the land and vowed to return. He served under Captain Peter Bacus with General William Henry Harrison. Richard was discharged March 03, 1813, and he returned to Scioto County Ohio.\n\nRichard Shute married Hannah McCartney on March 31, 1814, in Scioto County, Ohio.(5) Hannah was a daughter of Daniel McCartney and his wife, Sarah Price.(6) Hannah McCartney was born February 03, 1796, in Virginia.(7) He migrated to the Gessie, Indiana, area with his wife, Hannah, and their four children, William, Daniel, John and Ephriam, in October 1829.
