        "text": "Richard and Nancy Ann (Rickett) Grimshaw\n\nGrimshaw, Early Settlers in Scioto County, Ohio\n\nRichard and Nancy (Rickett) Grimshaw\n\n(See photo below for credits.)\n\nRichard Grimshaw was born to Jonathan and Betsey (Willoby) Grimshaw in Beaver Co, Pennsyvania in 1823 (see companion webpage). Richard met his wife, Nancy Rickett, in that area, and they were married in nearby Carroll, Ohio on August 25, 1842. They started their family there (first child in 1843) and, sometime between 1847 and 1850, moved south to Scioto County. Richard and Nancy had a large family of 16 children who left many descendants that comprise one of the major Grimshaw lines in North America. One of their descendants was Ralph Grimshaw, who was a specialist on sheep at the Ohio State University in Columbus; he is the subject of a companion webpage. Two of Richard and Nancy Grimshaw’s sons and their spouses migrated to northeast Missouri and are the subject of a companion webpage.\n\nIt is likely that Richard’s father, Jonathan, is related to the family of Grimshaws – descendants of Jonathan and Elizabeth (Pratt) Grimshaw – who settled in Erie County in northwest Pennsylvania, but the connection has not yet been established. Jonathan and Elizabeth Grimshaw are also the subject of a companion webpage. There is one record that Richard may have had a brother, Benjamin, also in the Scioto County area.\n\nContents\n\nWebpage Credits\n\nPhotos of Richard and Nancy Grimshaw and Several of Their Children\n\nPartial Descendant Chart for Richard and Nancy Grimshaw\n\nAdditional Descendant Information for Clinton Grimshaw from Michael Brown\n\nAdditional Family Members from Amie Agidius\n\nDid Richard Have a Brother, Benjamin Grimshaw?\n\nPublished Descriptions of Richard and Nancy Grimshaw\n\n1850 Census Record for a Richard and Nancy Grimshaw in Ohio\n\n1870 Census Record for Richard and Nancy Grimshaw\n\nMaps of the Area in Scioto County Where Richard and Nancy Settled\n\nWebsite Information on Richard and Nancy Grimshaw\n\nBurial Place of Richard and Nancy (Rickett) Grimshaw\n\nGravestone of Newton, Son of Richard and Nancy (Rickett) Grimshaw\n\nInformation from Responses to Edwin Grimshaw Inquiry\n\nMatthew Grimshaw, Civil War Veteran\n\nWas Richard Grimshaw Related to the Erie County Line of Grimshaws?\n\nJohn Wesley and Matthew J Grimshaw Migrated to Missouri\n\nObituary of James Theodore Grimshaw, Grandson of Richard and Nancy Grimshaw\n\nInformation from Descendants of Clinton E and Mary Ellen (Smith) Grimshaw\n\nInformation and Photos of Charles Wesley and Turah “Perneta” (Anspauch) Grimshaw\n\n“We Remember Arthur W.

Agidius, the daughter of Paul Agidius, the son of Jim and Nettie Agidius, the daughter of Clinton and Carrie Grimshaw. I was just emailing to inform you of a few additions to the family on our side. James Adam Agidius, my brother has two children; James Andrew Agidius (4/14/1998) and Solomon Robert Agidius (7/17/07). My eldest brother Jason is married to a woman named Sarah. As well my Cousin Bryan Kalbfleisch, son of Faye Jean Agidius, is married to Michelle and they have three children, Noah, Brianna and Allison. Patrick Agidius, son of Nettie has two daughters, Nichole Agidius, and Heather (Agidius) Kramer who is married to Bob Kramer and they have 1 daughter Ava Kramer.\n\nI love your website!

There appear to be no Benjamins among Richard’s descendants. Therefore it is concluded that Benjamin may have been a brother of Richard, although there is no other evidence to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nPhotos of Richard and Mary (“Mollie”) (Clark) Grimshaw\n\nMichael Brown has provided pictures of Richard and Mollie Grimshaw, parents of Clinton E Grimshaw, as shown below.\n\nLeft to right in both pictures: Charles Clark (Mollie’s father), Mollie Grimshaw, Earl Grimshaw (son of Richard and Mollie) and Richard Benton Grimshaw\n\nPublished Descriptions of Richard and Nancy Grimshaw\n\nSeveral published references provide valuable information on Richard and Nancy; the relevant sections are shown below.\n\nEvans, Nelson W., 1903, p. 376-3782\n\nReferences to Grimshaws shown in bold.\n\nJEFFERSONTOWNSHIP.\n\nJefferson was a township prior to 1810, but the exact date of Its organization is unknown. It Included Valley Township until 1860, when the township was divided, the ‑eastern part retaining the name of Jefferson and the western part becoming Valley Township. Jefferson Townshipwas formerly part of Seal and Union Townships.\n\nThe present Jefferson Township was settled first on Long Run in the southeast comer of the township in 1808. Some of the earliest settlers were James “Painter” Wilson, Joshua Tritt, J. H. Munn, James Haney, Jesse Rice, Rodney Marshall, Samuel Farmer, Jacob Crouse, Richard Grimshaw, Jared Spriggs, Abner Field, Aaron Gee, Daniel Conkell, Daniel McLaughlin, Thomas Carlisle and Solomon Munn. The original Jefferson Township settlements were on the SciotoRiver in what is now ValleyTownship.\n\nBoundary, Area and Valuation.\n\nThe boundary of Jefferson Township was first changed December 5, 1826, as follows: The east half of the southeast quarter of section 25, township 3, range 21 taken from Jefferson and attached toMadison. There have been other small changes for the accommodation of certain residents, but none are of much importance. The township records are very Incomplete. Nothing of consequence is recorded prior to 1838, when Leonard Groninger was clerk. The present boundary is north by PikeCounty, east by Madison and HarrisonTownships, south by Clay and west by Valley Township.\n\nThe area of JeffersonTownship is 14,940 acres. The value of the real estate is $49,660; personal property, $25,013, making a total valuation of $74,673. It ranks 14th in area, 15th in population, (smallest) 16th in real estate, 16th in personal property and 16th in total of both.\n\nTopography.\n\nJefferson contains very hilly and rough land, but also some very good farm land. In the southeast corner, the Valley of Long Run contains good farms. Southwest of the center and extending to the eastern. boundary of Valley Township is a strip of bottom land on Marsh’s Run, that is very productive farm land. On Blue Run are found the ‑widest fertile bottoms, but in the region called “Flat Wood” is a large area of level high land that produces well, both grain and fruits. Fallen Timber Valley, in the north‑east ‑corner, Is narrow but it contains some good farms. Jefferson has a great many hills but all of them can be profitably *cultivated in berries, peaches and other fruits. ExceptVernon, Jefferson is the roughest township east of the Scioto river.\n\nOfficers.\n\nThe township officers In 1851 were: Treasurer, James L. Thomas; Clerk. Leonard Groniger; Justices of the Peace, Mark Snyder and Isaac N. Johnson; Constables, Thomas Carlisle, John Stewart and O. B. Murphy. The present township officers are: Clerk, T. Frank Craig; Treasurer, P. H. Reinoehl; Trustees, John Shuman, Jerry Field and W. L. McCain; Justices of the Peace, James McWilliams and Jared Spriggs; Constable, Stephen Keller.\n\nJeffersonTownship has no furnaces nor factories, and never has had but three mills, one water power, one horse power and one steam power.\n\nSchools.\n\nThere are few townships but have a better school system than Jefferson. In 1851, Jefferson had eight schools, one special and 7 sub‑districts. The following is copied. from its first records. District Number 1, 78 youth, $64.13 school fund: District No. 2, 67 youth, $55.08 school fund; District No. 3, 71 youth, $58.38 school fund; District No. 4, 39 youth, $32.06 school fund; District No. 5, 63 youth, $51.80 school fund; District No. 6, 60 youth, $49.35 school fund; District No 7, 34 youth, $27.96 school fund; Special District, 54 youth, $48.9.1 school fund. The township fund for the same year was $69.81.\n\nJefferson Township at present has five schools, as follows: District 1, Munn’s School, 41 pupils; District 2. Flat Woods, 39 pupils; District 3, Black Run, 36 pupils; District 4, Blue Run, 39 pupils; District 5, Fallen Timber, 60 pupils. The term to seven months, and the teachers’ wages are $30.00 per mouth. Two of the school buildings, Flat Woods and Fallen Timber, are nearly new. The average value of each school house and site is about $500.\n\nBlue Run Methodist Episcopal Church was organized, and a church built in 1859. Rev. Harrison Willis was the first pastor. The first trustees were: James Varner, Milton Deselen and John Morgan. The ‑original members were: John Morgan and wife; Abner Field and wife; Samuel Miller and wife; Jared Spriggs and wife; Eliza Varner, James Varner and wife and Mrs. Nancy Mar­shall. The pastor is Rev. G. E. Hughes.\n\nFallen Timber Christian Church was organized in 1865. The first pastor was Rev. Asa Eblin. The membership of the church is nearly 100 and the Sunday School is large. Edward McWilliams is Superintendent of the Sunday School.\n\nFlat Woods Methodist, Protestant Church was organized in 1876. The first pastor was Rev. Perry Orr and the trustees were: Hamilton Myers, Nicholas Funk and Jared Spriggs. The original members were David Crull and wife; William Porter and wife; Henry Bricker and wife; Abigail Crull, Catherine Farmer and Rachel Ralphsnider. The pastor is Rev. W. W. Gadd. The church has about fifty members and a large Sunday School.\n\nCemeteries\n\nJefferson Township Cemeteries are fenced and kept at the expense of the township. The Morgan Cemetery Is located on the high hill back of theBlueRunChurch. Here are buried some of the oldest pioneers of Jefferson, but few If any of their graves have record stones from which data can be obtained.\n\nTheJacobsCemetery is located on Fallen Timber Run. None of the old pioneers’ graves can be found in this.\n\nFlat WoodsCemetery is near theFlat WoodsChurch on Stony Hill.\n\nThe HickmanCemetery is on the farm of Jacob Hickman.\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy grave in Jefferson Township is that of Major James Munn, who was buried on top of the hill near Oertel Corner, on the Portsmouth and Harrisonville turnpike. It is well cared for and the grave can be seen from the road near the Oertel homestead. While it has no stone, it is well known.\n\nPortsmouth Area Recognition Society, 1986, p. 319-3203\n\nProbably the most complete publication on Richard Grimshaw.\n\nGRIMSHAW\n\nOne of the first settlers in Jefferson Township was Richard Grimshaw, born in 1823 inErie County, Pennsylvania. He came to Portsmouth by boat in the early 1840’s. While working there he saved money for land, a team of horses and the making of a large sled.\n\nAs time permitted he scouted the area of government land, in time he bought four sections, (40 acres each section) paying 32 cents per acre. He walked to the capital at Chillicothe, Ohio, to obtain the sheepskin deed.\n\nAfter preparation of needed supplies and with the horses and sled he followed the dirt road out to Oertles Corner, (State Route 139) then using the creek as road he arrived at the recently purchased land. This area was named Blue Run because of the abundance of blue slate in the creek bottom. The clearing of virgin timber began and log buildings erected.\n\nHe married Nancy Ann Rickett of Portsmouth and they were the parents of 16 children. Twelve grew to adulthood, some remaining in the area, and some migrating to other states. There continues to be descendants in these areas.\n\nThe first church was held in a one-room log building on the Grimshaw land, later church services were held in the log school house. After several years, a church building was built near the presen tMethodist Church. Much later in 1920 the presentBlueRunMethodist Church was erected. Among those that helped make this possible was Richard Benton Grimshaw, a son of the pioneer Richard Grimshaw. Another descendant a grandson of the pioneer was Floyd Grimshaw, who was county treasurer in late 1940’s. Several of his descendants live in the Portsmouth area.\n\nAnother descendant of the pioneer, Clinton Grimshaw, a farmer, was a life-long resident of Blue Run. He died in 1971 at the age of 88. Richard died in 1902 at the age of 79; Nancy died in 1900 at the age of 77. They are buried at StoneyHillCemeteryon the Lucasville,\n\nMinford Road.\n\nIn the 150 years since, descendants of this first family continue to live on Blue Run.\n\nLucasville Historical Society, 1991, p. 1584\n\nPhotos, but no written information, on the Grimshaws in Scioto County.\n\n1850 Census Record for a Richard and Nancy Grimshaw\n\nThe following information from the 1850 U.S. Census is taken from a companion webpage on this website. Initial examination of this record would lead one to conclude that it shows the Richard and Nancy who are the subject of this webpage, but it is apparently a family located in Jefferson County (not Scioto County) that is coincidentally similar to that of Richard and Nancy.\n\nOhio, Richard and Nancy Grimshaw\n\nRichard Grimshaw, age 37, and his 36-year-old wife, Nancy, were living in Jefferson County, Ohio with their three children – John W, age 6; Mathew, 3; and Sarah E., 6 months. Richard and Nancy were born in Pennsylvania ; the children were all born in Ohio. Also living in the household were John Mafale (?) and William Haley.\n\n1870 Census Record for Richard and Nancy Grimshaw\n\nThe following image from the 1870 U.S. Census of Scioto County was obtained from the Ancestry.com website. It shows 47-year-old Richard and Nancy, one year younger, living with four of their children – Nancy A., age 12, Richard B, age 9, Jonathan, age 7 and Emily, age 5\n\nMaps of the Area in Scioto County Where Richard and Nancy Settled\n\nScioto County is on the southern border of Ohio, across the Ohio River from Kentucky (red star on map below).\n\nIn maps published by Barton and Gibbs5 (1875, p. 11 — Jefferson Township), the Grimshaw property is clearly depicted, as shown below (west and southwest of the number for Section 26).\n\nThe Richard Grimshaw property is shown on the following map published by the U.S. Geological Survey (7-1/2 Minute Quadrangle, Lucasville Sheet, 1961)\n\nGoogleEarth image of area of Richard and Nancy Grimshaw’s home place (within white rectangle).

The original members (except veterans) were mustered out Dec 30, 1864, by reason of expiration of term of service, and the organization, composed of veterans and recruits, retained in service until Jul 20, 1865, when it was mustered out in accordance with orders from the War Department.\n\nThe official list of battles, in which this Regiment bore and honorable part, is not yet published (in 1888) by the War Department, but the following list has been compiled, after careful research, during the preparation of this work:\n\nMcDOWELL, VA May 8, 1862 CROSS KEYS, VA June 8, 1862 CEDAR MOUNTAIN, VA August 9, 1862 FREEMAN'S FORD August 23-25, 1862 BULL RUN, VA (Second battle) August 30, 1862 CHANCELLORSVILLE, VA May 1-4, 1863 GETTYSBURG, PA July 1-3, 1863 LOOKOUT VALLEY, TN October 29, 1863 MISSION RIDGE, TN November 25, 1863 RESACA, GA May 13-16, 1864 NEW HOPE CHURCH, GA (Dallas) May 25 to Jun 4, 1864 KENESAW MOUNTAIN, GA June 9-30, 1864 PEACH TREE CREEK, GA July 20, 1864 ATLANTA, GA (siege of) July 28 to September 2, 1864 AVERYSBORO, NC March 16, 1865 BENTONVILLE, NC March 19-21, 1865\n\nhttp://www.scioto.org/OhioHistory/Military/CivilWar/73-OVI/73-E.html\n\n73rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry – Company E\n\nMustered in 30 Dec 1861 at Camp Logan, Chillicothe OH, by Thomas W.

E. 73RD. O.V.V.I.”\n\nWas Richard Grimshaw Related to the Erie County Line of Grimshaws?\n\nRichard is reported to have come to Ohio from Erie or Erie County, Pennsylvania. His father’s name was Jonathan and his mother’s name was Betsey (common name for Elizabeth). He was born on February 2, 1823. The similarities to David Grimshaw on the descendant chart for Jonathan and Elizabeth Grimshaw (who were not immigrants to North America themselves), as described on a companion webpage, is uncanny, as though they may have been twins.\n\nIn addition, one of the biographies above indicates that Richard was born in Erie County:\n\nOne of the first settlers in Jefferson Township was Richard Grimshaw, born in 1823 inErie County, Pennsylvania. He came to Portsmouth\n\nby boat in the early 1840’s. While working there he saved money for land, a team of horses and the making of a large sled.\n\nHowever, other records indicate that Richard was born in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, which is over 100 miles south of Erie (northwest of Pittsburgh).\n\nIn any case, it seems highly likely that Richard is tied to the Erie, Pennsylvania family line, but the exact connection has not yet been determined.\n\nThanks again to Elaine Ruggiero for providing the following descendant chart.

It is apparent that not only John Wesley and Matthew, but also Newton Isaac Grimshaw – James Theodore Grimshaw’s father – migrated to Missouri from Ohio.\n\nJames Theodore Grimshaw, 90, of Moberly died Saturday, Feb.1, 2003, at Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital.\n\nServices will be at 2 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 4, at Trinity United Methodist Church in Moberly with the Rev. George Burgin officiating. Arrangements are under the direction of Nilson Funeral Home, 5611 St. Charles Road.\n\nMr. Grimshaw was born Nov. 17, 1912, in Macon County to Newton Isaac and Alice Narcissus Palmer Grimshaw.\n\nHe married Norma Lee Calvert in March 1934 in St. Joseph, and she preceded him in death.\n\nMr. Grimshaw was a retired grocer and provided tax service for the elderly. He volunteered at Moberly Regional Medical Center and was a member of Trinity United Methodist Church. He also was a Navy veteran of World War II and a member of American Legion Post 6.\n\nSurvivors include three sons, Robert Grimshaw of Clinton, William Grimshaw of Oregon and John Grimshaw of Columbia; and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nHe also was preceded in death by two sons, James Grimshaw and C. Thomas Grimshaw; a brother; and two sisters.\n\nSource: http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2003/Feb/20030202ForT002.asp\n\nInformation from Descendants of Clinton E and Mary Ellen (Smith) Grimshaw\n\nMichael Brown and his mother, Lucy Ellen (Grimshaw) Brown have kindly provided the pictures shown below.\n\nMary Ellen (Smith) Grimshaw, widow of Clinton E. Grimshaw. Photo taken about 2000, when Mary Ellen was about 90 years old.

Faye, Ralph and Russell are in the back row. Photo courtesy of Michael Brown and Steve Abner.\n\nThanks to Michael Brown for the above information and photos. In August 2013, Michael noted that Ellen Grimshaw had died at age 102 and provided the following obituary.\n\nEllen Grimshaw, age 102, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, August 14, 2013. She was born on December 15, 1910 on Dry Run, Washington Township, Portsmouth, Ohio, the daughter of Leonidas and Minerva Roberts Smith, Ellen attended elementary school in a one-room “rural” schoolhouse on Dry Run. At age 14 she worked the summer as a housekeeper and cook to earn money for books and bus fare to Portsmouth High School for the year. After high school, she continued to work as a housekeeper. In 1933, Ellen married Clinton E. Grimshaw, a widower with 9 children, who owned a farm on Blue Run Road near Lucasville, Ohio. Immediately her life became one of cooking, gardening, farming, canning, sewing, and caring for a large household. Ellen was well known for her cooking and baking, especially bread and cinnamon rolls. Winter months the Grimshaw house became a gathering place for local youth to go sleigh riding down the hill with Ellen making hot chocolate and popcorn balls for all. During winter months quilting frames would be set up for months in the living room. Many of these quilts are still cherished by family. She was “Mom” to all the Grimshaw children and “Granny” to the many grand and great-grandchildren. Ellen served as a 4-H Advisor for many years and in 1975 she was honored with a trip to Washington, D.C. to be presented a 25 years Advisor Pin. Ellen had a sharp mind and enjoyed many hobbies. She enjoyed listening to the radio while working, keeping informed on national news and was interested in history, geography and music and traveling to visit family. Until a short time ago she could readily recall the birth dates of her siblings, family and events, rarely missing a birthday card. She lived on Blue Run until the age of 87 when she moved into an apartment in Minford, Ohio. Ellen remained independent, only giving up driving at age of 95. In 2010 she moved into Elbrooke Pavilion, an assisted living facility in Minford, Ohio. Since February 2013 she has been a resident at Heartland of Portsmouth Nursing Home. A lifelong devout Christian, Ellen was a member of Blue Run United Methodist Church for over 75 years, Ellen was a founding member of United Methodist Women, a Sunday School Teacher, church delegate to the Annual Conference and served as a cook for local church youth attending Camp at Lancaster, Ohio and the church food booth at the Scioto County Fair for many years. Ellen enjoyed reading her Bible nightly. Just a few weeks prior to her passing she enjoyed hearing and singing hymns, remembering the words to her favorites. She was preceded in death by her parents; brothers, Melvin, Leonidas, Cecil, Homer, Raymond and Harold Smith; sisters, Elizabeth Manley and Lorena Smith Holstein; husband, Clinton E. Grimshaw; daughters, Jeanne Finch and Janet Durand; and step children, Marie Deemer, Lucille, Ralph, Russell, Harry, Donald, Albert and Charles Grimshaw. Ellen is survived by and her memories will be cherished forever by surviving children, Annalee (Jordan) Abner, Lucy Ellen Brown, Richard, Kenneth, Marilyn Jane Grimshaw, long-time son-in-law, Jordan Abner, and step daughters, Faye Parmenter and Nettie Agidius, 41 grandchildren; 70 great grandchildren; several great-great grandchildren and many nieces and nephews.\n\nFuneral services will be conducted at 2:00 p.m. Sunday, August 18, 2013 at Erwin-Dodson-Allen Funeral Home in Minford with Pastor Tim Palla officiating. Burial will be at Lucasville Cemetery in Lucasville. Friends may call at the funeral home from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. Saturday and one hour prior to the service on Sunday. Online condolences may be sent to www.edafh.com. In lieu of flowers memorial contributions may be sent to Save the Children.Org, 54 Wilton Road, Westport, CT 06880.\n\nInformation and Photos of Charles Wesley and Turah “Perneta” (Anspauch) Grimshaw\n\nJudy Bryson has kindly provided the information and pictures shown below.\n\nCharles Wesley & Turah “Perneta” Anspauch Grimshaw\n\nChildren: Ada Opal (b 7 JUL 1897; d 29 SEP 1972), Gracie Pearl (b 9 MAR 1906; d 6 MAR 1981), Lester Frances (b 28 JAN 1902; d 13 OCT 1967), Loral May (b 3 APR 1904; d 3 SEP 1969), William Arthur (b 1 JUL 1899; d 9 OCT 1979)\n\nCharles Wesley Grimshaw\n\nJames Orland Grimshaw b 21 NOV 1914; d 31 DEC 1937 – died as a result of a motorcycle accident. He is holding his pet chicken.\n\nJames Orland Grimshaw’s grave marker. His father, Charles Wesley, carved the stone. On the opposite side of the stone is “Orland Grimshaw.” He is buried at Mt. Zion Cemetery, Callao, MO\n\nRuth Lillian Grimshaw Roberts b 26 NOV 1911; d 17 SEP 1990; Freeman Kermit Grimshaw b 25 OCT 1909 – still living; Connie “Bea” Grimshaw Watson b 2 MAR 1908 – 9 JUN 1995; Virginia “True” Morris Grimshaw (wife of William Arthur Grimshaw) b 4 JUL 1905; d 24 MAY 1986; little girl – unknown. Photo taken about 1983.\n\nThomas David Grimshaw (brother of Charles Wesley Grimshaw and son of John Wesley & Rebecca “Esther” Tritt Grimshaw)\n\nOn the back of this photo, it says “Maud & Marvin.” My mom believes these are John Grimshaw, Jr.’s twin children. John, Jr. would be John Wesley & Ester Tritt Grimshaw’s child. But in my records (which most likely are not complete on John Jr.), I show he is married to Lillian Zimmerman and I do show 1 child – Marvin David. Do you have more info on this line to verify he had children names Maud & Marvin? The back of the photo also said “Charles Wesley’s brother’s children.\n\nRoy Whitfield – son-in-law of Arthur Wood & Ella J. Dunseith Grimshaw. Roy was married to Nola Coral Grimshaw.\n\nThe back of the photo says: “Children of John Grimshaw & Mrs. Werman.” The handwriting was difficult to read, and I’m not convinced if “Werman” was correct. Could have been a nanny? My mom believes that Maud and Marvin are on each end of the photo, and not sure of the other children.\n\n“We Remember Arthur W. Grimshaw” by Naomi H. Grimshaw\n\nNaomi (Cavender) Grimshaw wrote a memorial piece to her husband, Arthur Wood Grimshaw, who died in 1961. The date of the memorial is not indicated but must have been between 1961 and the date of Naomi’s death, April 16, 1984. An image of the introduction to the piece is shown below, followed by the text of the memorial.\n\nThanks go to Judy Bryson for sharing this invaluable document for the history of this family line.\n\nWE REMEMBER ARTHUR W. GRIMSHAW\n\nAs I think of his passing in an early morning hour of February 27, 1961 to the Fathers House of many mansions, (John 14:1, 2 & 3) I know he had lived in readiness for that hour. It comforts my heart in the midst of grief.\n\nTwenty-two years I spent with this good man. He was good, and, patient and gentle; truly a Christian gentleman at all times. An humble man and very conservative in his manner, he never wanted to call attention to himself. His love and devotion for his family was deep and abiding, often expressed by his kindly manner and expressive ayes, rather than words.\n\nHis grandson, Max, suggested that the family preserve in writing some incidents of his life, “lest we forget” as the years go by, what a wonderful man he was. It has been a great pleasure to recall the things he told me of himself and his family, and to remember my life with him.\n\nNaomi H. Grimshaw\n\nThe full text of this document is provided on the companion webpage on the Grimshaw lines that migrated to Missouri.\n\nFinal Resting Places of Matthew Grimshaw and His Descendants\n\nJudy Bryson has kindly provided the following photos of the gravestones of Matthew and Eliphel (Morris) Grimshaw and some of their descendants.\n\nMatthew and Eliphel Grimshaw\n\nArthur Wood Grimshaw and His Wives, Ella Jane and Naomi\n\nRoss M and Lester Frances (Grimshaw) Allen\n\nDelbert E Grimshaw\n\nGeorge and Annie (Grimshaw) Smith\n\nPearl Gomer Smith, son of George & Annie Smith\n\nRalph Leo Smith, son of G.

After making e-mail contact with the website author, Eric sent the photos, which are shown below.
