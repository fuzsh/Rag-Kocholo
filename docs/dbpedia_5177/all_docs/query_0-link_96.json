        "text": "(Columbus) – United States Senate candidate Frank LaRose announced endorsements today from more than 150 conservative leaders across Ohio.\n\nLaRose’s broad army of supporters come from all walks of life and represent a diverse background of local GOP leadership, from mayors, county officeholders and state legislators to county Republican Party chairs and members of state and county GOP leadership committees.\n\n“There’s one thing money can’t buy in Ohio politics, and that’s a battle-tested, grassroots organization that’s been proven successful in four statewide elections,” said LaRose, a Green Beret combat veteran and current reservist.\n\n“I learned in the Army the success of any mission often depends on the team you take with you into battle.”\n\n“Many of these great Ohioans have had my back for years, and I’m honored and humbled to have them with me again in this mission. We’re fired up and ready to retire Sherrod Brown and take back control of our United States Senate.”\n\nLaRose is the only candidate seeking the Republican primary nomination who’s run and won four statewide elections, two primaries and two general election contests.\n\nAs Bernie Moreno withdrew his candidacy and Matt Dolan lost a primary election, LaRose won re-election as Secretary of State last year with more votes than anyone in the history of the office and with nearly 100,000 more votes statewide than Sherrod Brown received in his last election.\n\nRecent polling consistently shows LaRose as the strong, double-digit leader of the Republican primary field and a serious threat to Brown, a 48-year politician who’s proven to be one of the most resilient politicians in state history.\n\nWhat they’re saying:\n\n“As dangerous ideology continues to creep into our schools, we need a fighter to protect our children from a radical agenda. As a father of school-aged girls, Frank LaRose understands what we’re up against and has the courage to take on the liberal agenda.”\n\n– Josh Williams, Ohio House of Representatives\n\n“When others talk a big game, Frank LaRose acts. No one outworks Frank and no one is more dedicated to fighting for Ohio values – even when it’s hard. We saw that first hand with Frank leading on Issue One. Frank is the fighter we need as our next U.S. Senator.”\n\n– Tom McCabe, Mahoning County Republican Party Chair\n\n“With a 100% pro-life voting record and guided by faith, Frank LaRose is the warrior we need in the US Senate to protect the sanctity of life and protect the unborn and our future generations.”\n\n– Bonnie Ward, Ohio Republican Party State Central Committee Member\n\n“As a decorated combat veteran, Frank LaRose fought to protect our nation at home and abroad. At this critical moment in our country, we need a battle-tested conservative who won’t back down from a fight. Frank is the strongest candidate in the race and I’m proud to endorse him for the US Senate.”\n\n– Mike Loychik, Ohio House of Representatives\n\n“Frank LaRose is the only candidate positioned to beat Sherrod Brown and continue President Trump’s agenda to make America great again.”\n\n– Greg Simpson, Ohio Republican Party State Central Committee Member and Former Clermont County GOP Chairman\n\nEndorsements: Greg Simpson, Ohio Republican Party State Central Committee Member and Former Clermont County GOP Chairman, Clermont County;
