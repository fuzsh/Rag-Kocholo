        "meta_description": "Scioto Historical is an educational mobile app and website that puts the history of southern Ohio at your fingertips. Learn about American and local history through map-based, interactive, multimedia presentations and experience professionally curated virtual historical tours on your laptop, tablet, or on a screen in your classroom. With its mobile app, Scioto Historical can guide you to historical locations and augment any walking or driving tour.\r\n\r\nFirst launched in June, 2013, Scioto Historical 2.0 is edited by Andrew Feight, Ph.D., Professor of American History at Shawnee State University in Portsmouth, Ohio. As a digital humanities and public history project, Scioto Historical 2.0 seeks to transform how American and local history is studied, taught, and preserved in the digital age.\r\n\r\nFocused on the counties of Scioto, Adams, Pike, and Lawrence in southern Ohio, the project's field of study also includes parts of Northeastern Kentucky (Lewis and Greenup counties, including the city of Ashland).\r\n\r\nIn partnership with area scholars, students, artists, and local cultural organizations, the project facilitates undergraduate digital research, while preserving the region's history and advancing the practice of digital arts and humanities in southern Ohio and eastern Kentucky.",
