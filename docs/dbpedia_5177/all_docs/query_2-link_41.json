        "text": "William Russell Phillips, a long time resident of Burleson, Texas was born on July 28, 1950 in Methodist Hospital in Oak Cliff, Dallas, Texas to Troyce and Bill Phillips. He passed away on January 10, 2024 from respiratory failure due to Covid and pneumonia.\n\nRusty, as the family called him, attended Jefferson Davis Elementary, W. E. Griener Jr. High, and graduated from Pleasant Grove Christian School, now Dallas Christian School, in 1969. He was one of the star players on the Chargers football team during his high school years as well playing on the varsity basketball team. Rusty played on the Northwood Institute football team for two years after graduating from high school.\n\nSports was an important part of Rusty’s life. He became an avid golfer while working as a district manager for Chief Auto Parts. His golfing skills increased as he made his attempts to enter the world of professional golf. He has also been a life-long fan of the Dallas Cowboys. His life was changed dramatically when he was injured in a motorcycle accident in 2003 resulting in the loss of his right leg. The accident only temporarily slowed Rusty down, as over time he rebounded from it and moved on with his life. He lived a full life as son, brother, husband, father, friend, and neighbor. He will be missed by all who knew him.\n\nHis parents, Bill and Troyce, his brother, George, and his granddaughter, Brookelynn Brown, preceded him in death.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Lolita, who during their ten years together has been an invaluable blessing to Rusty and Rusty’s family; by his brother, Cary Phillips of Sachse, Texas; his cousins in the DFW area; and, his daughter, Dawn Jeanette Phillips; granddaughter, Whitney Brown; grandson, Skyler Trigg; and many great grandchildren."
