He is one f the most successful of the Drew-Selby Co's. commercial salesmen and enjoys the confidence of his employers to the fullest extent.\n\nJoseph Jackson Sutton\n\nwas born in Lawrence county, Ohio, June 17, 1842. His father was John W. Sutton of Baltimore county. Maryland, who lived in Ohio for more than tifty years and in Scioto county twenty-eight years. He died in Portsmouth, Ohio, October 31, 1892. His mother's maiden name was Catharine Gard, of York county, Pennsylvania. She died November 14, 1900. Mr. Sutton received only a common school education in the schools, but was a great reader. He informed himself on all current events and is well read in history.\n\nMay 26, 4862 he enlisted in Company H, 87th 0. V. I. for three months, was at the seige and surrender of Harper's Ferry, Va., September, 1862. He was paroled and honorably discharged Oct. 1, 1862, returning to his home in Jackson county, Ohio. He remained there until March 29, 1863, when he enlisted in Company H, 2nd West Virginia Cavalry at Charleston, W. Va., in a Company which had been raised in Jackson county, Ohio, the entire regiment having been recruited in Ohio. No regiment saw harder service than this. It was on the perilous Wytheville raid, the ill-fated Lynchburg raid, and numerous engagements in West Virginia. In July, 1864 the command was transferred to the Shenandoah Valley in the Army f Major-General Phillip H. Sheridan. Our subject was in the following battles under that gallant commander: Winchester, Fisher's Hill. Cedar Creek, Appomattox Station. and Appomattox C. H., the latter, being the surrender of Lee. He was in fifty-five battles and skirmishes, was never wounded, although engaged in a number f hand-to-hand encounters\n\n1152 - HISTORY OF SCIOTO COUNTY.\n\nand never missed a scout, nor fight in which his company was engaged. He prides himself in his army service in that, although not very strong physically, he was never sick nor in the hospital during the war. He boasts that he never cost the Government a cent for medicine or hospital treatment. He was honorably discharged June 30, 1865.\n\nFrom the service he returned to Scioto county, where his parents had located in 1864. He was a resident of Portsmouth for a number of years. He was a member of the Board of Education in that city in 1893 and 1894, was a member of the Sixth Street Methodist Episcopal church and one of the official board of that church. He was also a member of Scioto Lodge No. 31, of Orient Encampment and a charter member and Captain of Canton Orient Patriarchs Militant I. 0. 0. F., of Portsmouth, Ohio. Mr. Sutton was married to Malissa Jane Westfall in Scioto county, February 15, 1866. Six children were born to them, two of whom survive, George C., of New York city, who was educated in the schools of Portsmouth, and Mrs. Ethel Trahelot of Chillicothe, Ohio. Mr. and Mrs. Sutton are temporarily living in the mountain section of Pike county, Ky. Mr. Sutton is engage in the lumber business.\n\nMr. Sutton is one of the most agreeable companions. He is a good conversationalist on any subject upon which he has read. He has a fine sense of humor. He is one f the most genial and courteous of men. When he makes a friend, he retains him. If he has any weakness it is his pride of his army record and he is fully justified in that. In 1892 he wrote and published a history f the Second regiment of West Virginia Cavalry. It is a book of 262 pages and very interesting. This regiment while being designated the Second West Virginia Cavalry was really from Ohio. Mr. Sutton was not only a first-class soldier but is a first-class citizen. Whenever a duty is presented to him lre always tries to do it, to the best of his ability. This has been characteristic of him from boyhood to the present time. He was reared a Democrat, but cast his first vote in 1864 for President Lincoln in the Shenandoah valley under the sound of the enemy's cannon. While he has usually been known as a democrat, his political views are liberal. He is universally liked and respected, and has no enemies he knows of. Certainly there has been nothing in his life and character which would invite the enmity of anyone.\n\nWilliam Swabby\n\nwas born April 6, 1849, at Center Furnace, Lawrence county, Ohio. His parents were Hiram Swabby and Ellen Brinkenmire. They were married in Germany. William Swabby was the fifth Of a family of ten children. He received a common school education in the schools at. Howard Furnace. Hiram Swabby was an engineer and our subject learned that trade. He began as assistant engineer with his father at the age of fifteen and worked at that until he was twenty-one He then worked at Howard furnace as a teamster for four years. He decided to go west and went to Hamilton furnace, Missouri, and remained there for two months, then came back and ran the engine at Cambria furnace for two years. In 1877, he came to Scioto county. He worked for Peter Somers from 1876 until 1880. Since that time he has been a farmer.\n\nIn 1876, he was married to Barbara Somers, daughter of Peter Somers. They have five children: George, who is employed in the Portsmouth post-office; Charles, an assistant superintendent of a rolling mill in Pittsburg; Howard, employed at the Big Four depot in Cincinnati; Cora and Roscoe at home. He is a republican and a member of the Methodist church. He was a Trustee of Clay township in 1886. 1n 1901, he was elected an Infirmary Director. Mr. Swabby is a good example of the self-made mail. Starting with industry and honesty for his capital, he has made a success of life.\" His reputation is that of an honest, capable, industrious and level-headed citizen. The respect in which he is held by the community is evidenced by his nomination and election as Infirmary Director, his majorities being a just tribute to his excellences as a citizen and his admitted qualifications for the place.\n\nRev. David Stanton Tappan, D. D., ILL,. D.\n\nThe name was originally Topham (Upper Village.) It is purely Anglo Saxon. The first Tappan of whom we have any knowledge, was Robert of Linton, near\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES - 1153\n\nPaley Bridge, West Riding, of Yorkshire. Our subject is the twelfth in the direct line of descent from this Robert Tappan, who died in 1550. Out of the twelve in the line of descent, nine had Scripture names, Samuel, Abraham and Benjamin were among them, the latter being the favorite. Abraham, the fourth in descent from Robert, came to Massachusetts, in 1637, and settled in Essex county. He was made a selectman the next year. Benjamin Tappan, the grandson of Abraham, graduated at Harvard College. The Tappans have always believed in education, but the son of the last named Benjamin, great-great-grandfather of our subject, was a goldsmith. However, a goldsmith in 1770, was a very different occupation from a goldsmith now. The early goldsmiths were the bankers and money lenders of their time.\n\nThe first Tappan in this country had eight children; the next, ten; the next, twelve; the next, eleven, and the Doctor, our subject, has followed the family fashion, for he has had eleven. The Tappans have always been distinguished for three things, conscience, learning and piety, and these characteristics are as strong in the present generation as in the past ones. The Doctor is in a peculiar situation as to this sketch. He was not consulted about it. It is written by his classmate and he is not responsible for anything in it. He never mentions his ancestry unless directly questioned about it, and the writer has inflicted that part upon him.\n\nHis grandfather, Benjamin Tappan, afterwards Judge and U. S. Senator, came to the Northwest Territory, in 1799. In 1809, he located in Steubenville, and there his grandson, our subject, son of Dr. Benjamin Tappan and Oella Stanton, daughter of Dr. David Stanton and sister of the great War Secretary, was born, April 2, 1845, the third of five children. He attended the public schools of Steubenville, until September, 1860, when he entered the Freshman Class at Miami University. He was a faithful and diligent student and learned well all there was to be learned. It was known through his entire course that he had the ministry in view. He took the first honors in a class of twenty-tive, at graduation, in June, 1864, and delivered the valedictory oration. While in college, he was a member of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity and the Miami Union Literary Society. Directly after his graduation, he took up the study of Theology, in the Western Theological Seminary, at Alleghany, Pennsylvania, and graduated in April, 1867. In the summer of 1865, he had charge of the State Lick Academy, in Armstrong county, Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1866, he was in charge of Callensburg Academy, in Clarion county, Pennsylvania. Alleghany Presbytery licensed him to preach, in the spring of 1866. In September 1867, he took charge of the Chariton Presbyterian church in the Presbytery of Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nOn August 12, 1869, he was married to Miss Anna Grandgirard, daughter of Rev. Emilius Grandgirard, at Hillsboro, Ohio.\n\nIn February, 1871, he took charge of the Presbyterian church at Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, where he remained until April, 1890. While in Iowa, he was honored with the offices of Moderator and Permanent Clerk of his Presbytery in turn. He was permanent clerk of the Iowa Synod South, from 1870 to 1882. when the two Synods were consolidated. In 1882, he was made Stated Clerk of the Synod of Iowa, and served until his removal from the state. While a resident of Iowa, he received the honorary degree of A. M. from Wooster University. He received the Degree of Doctor of Divinity, from Lenox College, Iowa, in 1886. While a resident of Iowa, he was a commissioner to the General Assembly of his church three times. He was for six years president of the school board of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. From 1887 to 1890, he was a Trustee of the Presbyterian College, at Fairfield, Iowa. On April 1, 1890, he took the pastorate of the First Presbyterian church, of Portsmouth, Ohio, the largest and strongest church in the Presbytery of Portsmouth. He held this until September 1, 1899, when he became President of the Miami University.\n\nIn the Presbytery of Portsmouth, he was the leader among his ministerial brethren. He was often Moderator. In 1893, he was a commissioner to the General Assembly from the Portsmouth Presbytery, and was one of the Clerks. He was chairman of the Committee on Home Missions in the Portsmouth Presbytery during his entire connection with it. In the Synod of Ohio, he was for three years chairman of the Committee on Education, and for three years\n\n1154 - HISTORY OF SCIOTO COUNTY.\n\nwas chairman of the Committee on Home Missions. In November, 1899, he received the degree of LL. D. from Wooster University, Ohio.\n\nHis eldest child, Benjamin, died an infant, in Iowa. His eldest daughter, Oella, is the wife of Edgar H. Lowman, of Springfield, Ohio. His second daughter, Julia, is the wife of Prof. William B. Langsdorf, Ph.. D., Lit. D., late Professor of Latin in Miami University, but now a Presbyterian minister. His second son Paul, is a graduate of Wooster, and a Doctor of Medicine, and an assistant physician at the Dayton Hospital for the Insane. His sons, Frank and George, are students of Washington College, Pa. His daughter Helen is at home. He lost a son, Edwin Stanton, aged eighteen months, while a resident of Portsmouth, and his daughter Lucy, aged sixteen, died since he has resided in Oxford. His youngest daughter, Margaret, is aged seven years.\n\nDoctor Tappan is a well educated man. He is thorough in all his methods. What he knows, he is certain of and it is available to him at any time. He is strong physically and strong mentally. As a preacher and public speaker, he has a voice which can be heard and understood. His sentences are well chosen and expressive. Whatever he has to say is interesting. His discourses are full of treasures of thought. Dr. Tappan has had but three churches in a ministry of thirty-two years. He could have remained in either a life-time. Each change was a promotion and a call up higher. His call to the Presidency of Miami University, his Alma Mater., was a tribute to his thorough education and his love for and devotion to teaching. He is conservative in all things. He is the last minister in the Presbyterian church to be suspected of heresy or heterodoxy. He is no theorist and is always found on the safe side f every question presented to him. When one goes to hear him preach a sermon, he is sure to be instructed and edified. He is sure to hear every word uttered and that the diction will be perfect. He is sure that there will be no sensationalism and he is sure of the Orthodoxy of every utterance. Dr. Tappan is a man f powerful will, and of great strength of purpose and the trait is inherited from both sides of the home. But for the fact that he is a minister, he would be as overbearing as his grandfather, the Senator, or his uncle, the great War Secretary, neither of whom could tolerate opposition. He is a tower of strength at the head of any institution, whether it be a church or college. He is a safe man at all times and under all circumstances. In a number f courses presented to him, he can always be relied on to take the wisest and the most just. Since the above was written, in June, 1902, Dr. Tappan resigned the Presidency of Miami University and in November of the same year accepted the pastorate of the Presbyterian church at Circleville, Ohio.\n\nAddison Taylor\n\nwas born in Harrisonville, Scioto county, Ohio, March 17, 1866, a son of Martyn Taylor, M. D., and Lydia J. Draper, his wife. Several of his paternal ancestors were soldiers of the Revolutionary War and his father was an acting assistant surgeon in the Civil war. Addison was educated in the common schools of the county and was a teacher for eight years, the last four of which he taught in the grammar grades at Sciotoville. He has been a consistent political prohibitionist since arriving at his majority, never having voted any other ticket, on a state, or national election, and has been a candidate for various offices in the county on the Prohibition ticket. He has been a member of the Methodist church for eighteen years. In 1890, he was married to Miss Anna Frank, of Sciotoville. They have two children: Wendell and Ella. Mr. Taylor is secretary and treasurer of the Scioto Star Brick Works, west of Sciotoville, and has been connected with the company for ten years, having worked his way up from a laborer in the yard. A good part of his time is spent traveling over the country selling fire brick. He has a large business acquaintance among the iron and steel trades. He is active in church work and what might be termed a \"radical\" in his opinions.\n\nJames Landon, Taylor, M. D.\n\nThe Taylors are of English ancestry and settled first on coming from England in the state of Connecticut, in the early part of the 18th century. From there this branch emigrated to the wilds of central New York, where\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES - 1155\n\nwe find James Taylor, the grandsire of this sketch, organizing a Methodist Episcopal church in or about Elmira, then called Newtown, in 1807. His mother Anna Landon, was a member f the Landon family, now widely distributed through the United States. About 1835, he came to Scioto county with his family, one daughter, Olive, and seven sons, two of whom preceded him. Of the sons, four also became Methodist ministers: James, Harvey, William and Landon, the latter marrying Jane Vincent, daughter of A. C. Vincent, one of the original French Grant settlers. Landon and wife took up their residence at Franklin furnace, Ohio, where the subject of this sketch was born February 1, 1840.\n\nOwing to the invalidism of his mother, the infant was taken by his maternal aunt, Mrs. John S. Baccus, near Wheelersburg, and reared in that family. Here he learned to speak French, which he ever after cultivated. His first recollection f school life was going to a subscription school in Wheelersburg, taught by Miss Elizabeth Crichton.\n\nAt the age f fifteen, he obtained a certificate to teach school and taught his first school in the Kettles district in 1856, at $33 1-3 per month. Mr. A. J. Finney, afterwards Sheriff and County Clerk, was one of Doctor Taylor's pupils, as well as many other gray-headed men and women out in that district which comprises part of four townships: Vernon, Bloom, Harrison and Porter. When the winter term was over, young Taylor started for a term in college. After completing, the Junior year of his college course in Delaware. Ohio, young Taylor obtained from President Merrick an honorable dismissal, and a certificate of standing in college so flattering that it virtually passed him into the University of Michigan, where he graduated in 1863. From that time until 1870, he spent in teaching, and in 1872, took the degree of M. D. in the Ohio Medical College in Cincinnati. He then took up the practice f medicine in Wheelersburg, Ohio, following Doctor Arthur Titus, where he has resided ever since.\n\nIn 1867, he married Melissa Folsom, of Green township, a daughter of J. S. Folsom, whose biography appears in this volume. There were born to them one daughter and two sons, both of the latter being physicians. The daughter Katy, died unmarried in 1900. The older son, Wesley, is rounding up his medical and literary education in the universities and hospitals f Europe, and the younger son John, has a similar course in prospect.\n\nDoctor Taylor has now been identified with Wheelersburg, Porter township and vicinity, as a teacher, farmer, doctor and well known citizen for nearly half a century. For eleven years consecutively he served on the School Board. In March, 1870, he succeeded Captain N. W. Evans as County Examiner, serving for nearly a year on the Board with Doctor Burr and John Bolton. He is a member of the local medical societies, the National Association and the American Academy of Medicine, the Vice Presidency of which he held from 1901-2. He is a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and planning to attend the International Medical Congress of Tuberculosis to be held in Paris in 1903.\n\nDoctor Taylor is still engrossed with the cares of his business, his lands and his profession, leading even a busier life than when he set out in the practice of his profession thirty years ago. He is of athletic build, six feet in height, an active mover, a republican in politics and a protestant in religion. Doctor Taylor is in no way responsible for what follows in this sketch. He is a very difficult subject to make a character estimate of and do him justice. The reason of that is, there are so many points of view, and our subject will show up well from any of them. Doctor Taylor is a well educated Man. He has been trained to think and investigate. His mind is like a wonderful piece of mechanism. It is bound to accomplish certain results. Give him a subject to investigate and reason out and he will first ascertain all the facts and then he will reach the most logical and wisest conclusion. He was not only trained to this but he has given himself a thorough course of self-discipline and training. The facts he learns are always available to him. They will come to him and he can use them at any time. The Doctor has a reputation as a first class business man and financier. It is because he knows how to reason on predicates and thereby anticipate results. In all things he undertakes he does his work thoroughly. He never acts until he knows the uttermost facts, and\n\nPICTURE - LAFAYETTE TAYLOR\n\n1156 - HISTORY OF SCIOTO COUNTY.\n\nwhen he has learned them all, he reasons out a course to pursue and that course is unerringly the wisest which could have been discovered or chosen. When he comes to a conclusion, he has faith in it and never hesitates. This habit of thought and action avails him in every thing he undertakes whether it be farming, medicine, literature or finance.\n\nThe Doctor is one of those rare characters who would succeed in anything they undertake. He is a first class farmer, he stands at the top of his profession and as a financier and business man he has no superior. The editor believes he would have acquired national distinction as a medical or historical writer, but no one could justly say that Doctor Taylor has missed his calling. To a layman, his medical essays, mentioned in the Bibliography of this work, show that he is master of every subject he has treated and that on a condition of facts given, his hypotheses are the most consistent with the highest wisdom in his profession, and his ideas are the most advanced. The esteem in which the Doctor is held by the fellow members of his profession, show that the layman’s ideas of him are correct. But the Doctor is not only fortunate and successful in handling medical subjects; some years ago he was a contributor to the Ohio Farmer and his articles on Tariff Reform were unanswerable. He can write an essay on the money question which would command the respectful consideration of the best financiers. He would be equally interesting in writing on stock raising. The editor has read all of the Doctor's essays on Medical Topics with great interest and believes that the community in which he dwells does not appreciate his learning or his acquirements in his profession. Fifty years from now his learning and talent will be appreciated. As the Doctor has taken good care of himself in his present life, in the life hereafter, he will not be concerned at the failure to appreciate him while living. His neighbors do appreciate him now as a business man, and they have the utmost confidence in him in his profession, but they will never realize the extent of his acquirements until he has passed beyond this life and his finished career can be compared with others.\n\nHarry Edmund Taylor\n\nwas born in McConnellsville, Morgan county, Ohio, September 29, 1873. He was the son of William and Frances Bell Taylor. William Taylor was the owner of various salt furnaces in the Muskingum valley, and was the first democrat elected to office in Morgan county after the war, being elected Sheriff in 1883. The subject of this sketch graduated from the McConnellsville schools in 1889, and then entered the office f the Morgan county \"Democrat,\" where he learned the printer's trade. In 1891, he became a reporter on the Akron, Ohio, \"World\" and the Akron \"Beacon and Republican.\" In 1894, Mr. Taylor came to Portsmouth to take charge of the city news work on the Portsmouth Daily Times, about to be started by J. L. Patterson. He has held that position up to the present time. In 1898, he, with Vallee Harold purchased the controlling interest in the Times Publishing Company, and upon the organization of the company Mr. Taylor was chosen Secretary and Treasurer. He married December 5, 1899, Leah Pauline, daughter f Mr. and Mrs. Harry H. Grimes, of Portsmouth, Ohio.\n\nLafayette Taylor\n\nwas born December 25, 1856, in Susquehanna, county, Pennsylvania, near the town of that name. His parents were William and Mary E. (Kelley) Taylor. who resided on East Mountain in Gibson township, in the above named county. William Taylor was a son of Amos and Dolly (Starks) Taylor. They settled about a mile below Smiley, Pennsylvania, on the west side of Tunkhannock, soon after 1800. Amos was the son of David and Mercy Taylor, who settled at Smiley about 1804, and built a hotel which was then one of the three frame houses in Gibson township.

Volney E. is a lumberman at Doane, West Virginia.\n\nDuring the early years of our subject's boyhood, he worked on a farm and attended the district school. He very early developed the propensity and desire to make money. This is evidenced by the fact that when he had reached the age f sixteen, he had accumulated the sum f $460 or what would be considered a good fortune for a boy of that age. But with this desire for money came an overwhelming desire for a better education than he could obtain at home. In company with a boy friend of his age and against the will of his parents, he came to Oberlin, Ohio, to attend school. But a term there somewhat discouraged him; he thought an education should be obtained in a more rapid manner so he left this school intending to take up study again in some other school. In the meantime, he went to work chopping wood and sawing logs for a saw mill until school should open again. This was his first experience in the lumber business. When the time for entering school again came around, he did not go; but continued to work and save. Month after month passed away and all the time the desire to make money was overcoming and crowding out the .desire for an education, until at the end of three years, he gave up his intention of educating himself and embarked upon his money making career which has been somewhat phenomenal and characteristic of all similar careers. In a short time he had saved sufficient money to buy several yoke of cattle and began taking logging contracts in Pike county. Success crowned his undertakings and soon he began to buy timber in tracts and to have it sawed, doing the logging himself.\n\nIn 1880, he came to Rarden, which has been the scene of his activities since, and which owes its growth and prosperity in large part to him. In 1885, he gave up logging and took up his residence in Barden, having married the previous year. Here he opened a small store and engaged in the buying and shipping of lumber and at the same time owning and operating several sawmills. He became a partner with Guilford Marr in the cooperage business in 1887. From this year until 1891, he had on hands at all times the enormous quantity of 2,000,000 feet of sawed lumber and his output each year during this time was 2,500,000 feet. Besides this quantity of sawed lumber, he handled railroad ties, tanbark and all kinds of lumber products. His trade gradually branched out until he had practical control of the lumber business in this section and nine-tenths f all the lumber shipped from Rarden in the last fifteen years has passed through his hands and has added thousands to his offers. From 1887 to the present time he has reaped the harvest from something like 50,000,000 feet of lumber.\n\nIn 1895, he became the chief stockholder in the Barden Stone Company, incorporated that year. He is exclusive owner of the Barden Stone Mill. He owns a controlling interest in the Taylor Cooperage company. He is an equal partner with Charles S. Brown in the Taylor-Brown Timber Company. He owns and operates a large general store at Barden. In 1900, he bought several thousand acres of valuable timber in Wayne county, West Virginia, and has since been engaged in sawing and marketing it.\n\nMr. Taylor is a republican and has always been such. He takes a deep interest in the management of local and national affairs, but is not a politician in any sense. His whole time is devoted to his numerous interests.\n\nHe was married July 4, 1884, to Almeda McNeal, a daughter f Joseph and Mary (Watrous) McNeal of Pike county, Ohio. They have one child living, Volney S., born March 27, 1886. He is now in school at Valparaiso, Ind. Another child, Lynn, was born May 8, 1888 and died in infancy. His first wife died November 22, 1888, and he was again married to Lucinda McNeal, a sister to his former wife, January 27, 1890.\n\nMr. Taylor is a man of strong and rugged build and has exceptional powers of physical endurance. He is always active and pushes his work and never lets it push him. The one great secret f his success is his exhaustless, tireless energy. Coupled with this his admirable ability to keep well in hand and manage his diverse business interests. He has exceptional business judgment and tact and during the years of his rapid advancement in the business world it has been employed to wonderful advantage. He is the embodiment\n\n1158 - HISTORY OF SCIOTO COUNTY.\n\nof honor and integrity-honest with himself, with his neighbor, with his employes and with those with whom he has business transactions. Some have a deep religious nature and a total lacking of the moral nature and vice versa; others have both in varying degrees, though one predominates.\n\nIn our subject we find but a moderate degree of the religious but an unusually sensitive moral nature which answers the purpose which the religious nature does in others. Consequently we have a man liberal in thought about things supernatural but radical in questions of right and justice. He should be a shining example for the young man who has nothing but his hands and a sound mind and body for capital to start on.\n\nMartyn Taylor, M. D.,\n\nof Sciotoville, Ohio, was born in the town of Lewis, Essex county, New York, in 1828. His father Theodore Taylor was the son of Eliphalet Taylor, a soldier of the Revolution who was conspicuous for bravery at the battle of Bennington. The mother of our subject, whose maiden name was Lucy Jane Ballou, was a descendent of Maturin Balton who came from Devonshire, England in 1640 to the province of Rhode Island and was largely influential in shaping the policy of this province. Hosea Ballou, the mother of President Garfield, and she, are of the same branch of the Ballou family. The boyhood and youth of Doctor Taylor, to the age of young manhood, were passed in his native state, where he received an academic education. At the age of eighteen years, the death of his father threw, him upon his own resources, and he began, single handed to strike out for himself, making his home in Adrian, Michigan. Enrolling himself as a student in the Medical College of the University of Michigan, he worked his way through that institution by teaching in the intervals of lectures and received a degree of Doctor of Medicine in the spring of 1852.\n\nMarch 27, 1853, he married Miss Lydia Jane Draper and began the practice of his profession at Danby, Dupage county, Illinois.

His surgical duties ceased when these four companies rejoined their regiment, with which he remained until June 20, 1865, when he was discharged.\n\nHe has always been a republican but has never sought office. His highest ambition has been to attain the greatest excellence in his profession. He is a member of the Methodist Episcopal church. After thirty years of laborious practice, he is disabled from further work, by disabilities resulting from military service, and is simply waiting for his summons.\n\nWells Teachnor, M.

He was a liberal and generous man. He would give his last dollar to a good cause. His willingness to oblige everybody was often taken advantage of, and among others who took advantage of him in that respect were his party friends. He knew everybody and was on good terms with all he knew, and never refused any demands made on him by his party. He ran for council several times to help his party. He was a candidate for Water Works Trustee four times, not that he cared for the office, or wanted it, or that it would be f any help to him, but simply because he was a good man to be on the ticket, and because, if he was on, he would work for himself and for the ticket.\n\nIn 1871, he was a candidate for this office and the vote stood J.

In making these appointments, the Commissioners appointed those whom they believed had the greatest sympathy for the unfortunate. It was on this idea that Thompson was appointed and reappointed while he lived. If Mr. Thompson took any interest in any subject, he took a great interest. This is true of his church and Odd fellowship. As a church worker he could always be depended upon. In Odd fellowship he was also a great worker.

Robinson, the daughter f Joshua V. Robinson, was born November 11, 1862. He was the youngest son and child of his parents. He attended the Portsmouth schools until 1878, then went to the Ohio State University for a term, then to Cincinnati to the Nelson Business College, and took one term there. When he came home from Cincinnati, he went to work for the Portsmouth Steel & Iron Company, on the old site of the Gaylord mill. He next went to work for Levi D. York, in the Burgess Steel & Iron Works, running the two hammers at the plate mill. After that he went to work for his brother at the fire-clay mines at. Sunday Switch on the B. & 0. railroad, for several months. Mr. Adams then offered him a job as weigher and time-keeper f the Portsmouth Fire Brick Company. During this time he was also secretary. He remained with this company until 1891.\n\nAfter 1891, he engaged in business with George Davis and W. G. Beyerly in the Kentucky Fire Brick Works. They made the first paving brick that was ever made of shale in this district. This was continued until after the death of Mr. Davis, Jan. 11, 1894, but the administrator had his interest until 1896, when the property was sold and Mr. Watkins and our subject bought it. It was incorporated into the Kentucky Fire Brick Works, and Mr. Turley was made vice president and secretary. They operated it for about five years and in June, 1901, it was consolidated, and the Kentucky Fire Brick Works, the Portsmouth Fire Brick Works, the South Webster Plant and the Blast Furnace Company became the Portsmonth & Kentucky Fire Brick Company, of which our subject was first vice president and general manager.

They have three children: William, Leroy and Ethel. Mr. Turner lives two miles below Friendship and has a comfortable home and a large and profitable farm. He has one f the largest apple orchards in southern ,Ohio. Mr. Turner is one of those solid, substantial farmers who tends strictly to his own affairs and by doing so has become one of the most prosperous and respected citizens. He is of large portly build, weighs over two hundred pounds and is possessed of a most equable temper. While he is essentially a man of business, he is a lover of the sports, and in times of leisure he takes a special delight in hunting and in the fox-chase.\n\nCharles W. Turner,\n\nof Sciotoville, Ohio, was born in Piketon, Pike county, Ohio, September 6, 1840. His parents, Nelson Turner and Francis (Hopper) Turner, were married at Scioto furnace, Ohio, in 1836, and moved to Piketon during the following year. His father was an engineer and machinist and erected a blacksmith and machine shop in Piketon, which he conducted successfully. He died in 1843. After several years of widowhood, his mother was married in 1846, to William Sheets. In the spring of 1848, they moved to Randolph, Tennessee, where they were engaged in the hotel business for two years. In 1852. they moved to a plantation on the Mississippi river, where his mother died March 4, 1853.\n\nIn the spring of 1854, our subject left the parental roof and went west to near Little Rock, Arkansas, to live with a cousin. He worked on a farm there\n\n1166 - HISTORY OF SCIOTO COUNTY.\n\nuntil the fall of 1860, when he went to see his step-father, who, in the meantime. had moved from Mississippi to a large plantation in Louisiana.\n\nHostilities between the North and South were at fever heat and he was an out-spoken Northern sympathizer. In the spring of 1861, the Confederates were organizing a company there to go to the front, and were bent upon pressing him into service. He out-witted them and skipped for the North between sun-set and sun-rise June 5, 1861. He intended to go up the river, but when he reached Memphis, he found it blocked at Island Number Ten, and had to change his plans and go by rail to Louisville. Coming up the river, he rode on a boat with the Tiger Bayou Riflemen from Milligan's Bend to Memphis, and to secure safety, he told them he lived in Memphis and would enlist with them upon reaching that port, which he neglected to do. While in the Memphis depot, inquiring the most direct route, he met a young man from Indiana, who had been in Mississippi, and who was trying to get home. As they were both in the same predicament and their efforts to escape were the same, friendship ensued and they became partners. They went to Bowling Green, Kentucky, and on June 10, while on the depot platform at Bowling Green, our subject overheard the officers tell the conductor to stop the train at Camp Zollicoffer, where the train would be searched. He told his partner this, who paid little attention to it. Our subject considered discretion the better part of valor and was also anxious to see the camp, so he was standing on the platform between the cars when the train reached the camp. Officers boarded the train and placed guards at the doors, but they evidently thought he was a member of the crew and did not molest him. He stepped off and sauntered up to the engine and boarded the cab, and thus came on safely. But, his partner, who had remained in the cars, was captured, and he never heard of him again. They had arranged that, if one met with misfortune, the other would notify his folks, and our subject wrote his partner's folks when he reached Missouri.\n\nHe reached the Union lines at Louisville, and, crossing the river to Jeffersonville, he drew one long breath, threw his hat into the air, and gave a yell. His plans were then undecided, hut as his two half-sisters were attending school in Hannibal, Missouri, he went to see them. He then went to Rails county, twenty-one miles away. He lived on a farm there until February 22, 1862, when he enlisted in the 31st Missouri State Troops and served until November 30, same year, when they were disbanded, subject to call. Our subject started to Indiana on horseback, but stopped in Iowa where he remained until July 28, 1863. He then went to Indiana, thence to Ohio and Pittsburg to see his mother's relatives. In the fall of 1863, he went to Camp Nelson, Kentucky, where he was employed in the Quartermaster's Department to drive teams. During the winter he operated from Flat Lick to Cumberland Mountain, taking supplies to the forces. In the spring of 1864, he went to Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nUntil then, he had been a driver and leader of pack mules in the mountains, but he was promoted to Wagon Master when he reached Lexington. His train started south with five hundred wagons and three hundred ambulances, awl when it reached Decatur, Alabama, he was turned over with 25 wagons and 150 mules to the First Division of the Twenty Third Corps of the Army of the Cumberland. The drivers were sent back and soldiers were detailed to drive and he was retained as Wagon Master. He was with this division until February 16, 1865, was through the Nashville fight, and kept up the supplies from the time the army left Nashville until it was finally shipped from Grange's Landing on the Tennessee river to Louisville. from which place the Division was sent to Washington and our subject, to Lexington. During March, 1865, another train was organized, which started to Little Rock, Arkansas, in April. It went to Louisville and went into camp to await transports, but, on May 20, they were discharged, the war being ended.\n\nHe then went to Berlin Cross Roads, Jackson county, Ohio, bought a team and hauled ore to La Trobe Furnace. In the fall of 1865, he took a contract with the Baltimore & Ohio South Western railroad to furnish them cross-ties in Scioto county. He came to this county and boarded at Henry Barrett's in Harrison township. In February, 1866, he came to Sciotoville and contracted with McConnell, Porter & Company to deliver fire-clay to their works.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES - 1167\n\nOn October 15, 1868, he was married to Miss Louella Byrn, who died November 15, 1901.

On January 1, 1876, he was employed by The Scioto Fire Brick Company as assistant superintendent. On January 1, 1890, he became superintendent, and in September, 1894, he was also made treasurer; and on January 1, 1902, he became president, superintendent and treasurer.\n\nHe was reared a Democrat, but shortly after becoming a voter, he became a republican, in which he is firmly grounded. He is not a politician in the popular sense. He never aspired to political honors, although he served his township one term as Trustee in 1877. One of the regrets of his life is that he voted the democratic ticket one time.\n\nMr. Turner is one of the best specimens of the self-made man. On account of scant school privileges in the South during his boyhood, his education was limited, but by dint of a bright intellect and indomitable perseverance, lie acquired a good, practical education since reaching manhood, and is to-day one of Scioto county's progressive and substantial men.\n\nWilliam Turner\n\nwas born in Washington township, Scioto county, Ohio, March 14, 1831.

Wynn.\n\nHe was township Trustee for a number of years. He was County Commissioner from 1876 to 1882. He owns about 500 acres of land along the Ohio river and the Scioto valley. He was a whip before he was a republican, and cast his tirst vote for General Taylor on the Whig ticket. He is an Odd Fellow. Mr. Turner is one of the most reliable citizens of Scioto county. While he was County Commissioner, he made one of the best in the whole succession. When he said \"no\" it was \"no,\" but he was never arbitrary. He was always open to reason and conviction and took the best course. No man ever possessed better business judgment than he. As an economist, he has been a success. He has made a fair fortune and he knows how to take care of it, though at all times he is a liberal, public-spirited citizen. A dozen words from him as how to make money is worth a whole library from a writer on the subject who has not succeeded in practical life.\n\nJames Huston Varner\n\nwas born January 1, 1861 at Portsmouth, Ohio, the youngest son of Col. Sampson E. Varner and Maria Louise Huston, his wife. He attended the Portsmouth public schools until 1874, when, at the age of 13, he went into the Kinney National Bank.

Bundy, who at that time was a local Methodist preacher.\n\nOur subject was very mischievous when a boy and that trait persists in exhibiting itself to this day. In attending the common schools, he was always considered a very apt pupil. He had an especial fondness for geography, spelling and history, mathematics being as dry as chaff to him. He taught the Friendship school four years and was successful in its management. After completing the common schools, he attended the National Normal at Lebanon, Ohio, the Central Ohio Normal at Worthington, Ohio, and at Oberlin, Ohio. Our subject was too young to be in the Civil war, but had three uncles: Ervin, Oren and Sanford Jennings, who were in the service and consequently he has a warm feeling for the old soldiers. He was Assessor of Washington township for two years. This is the only office he ever held, with the exception f being Postmaster at Dennis, Ohio, since September 15, 1893.\n\nHe is a republican but an ardent supporter of the \"free-silver\" theory. He is very independent in his political course and votes for the man rather than the party label. Though not a rich man, he owns a good farm, unincumbered, all under-drained, very productive, and with good improvements. He is a good financier in a small way. He is always liberal and willing to help those in need of help, and has always felt a pleasure in doing so. Mr. Vaughters was Editor of the Piketon (Ohio) Courier in 1879 and 1880. He says he did not accumulate two cents during that time, but had two million dollars worth of fun. He has been correspondent for several city papers before and since.

At the time he was captured, there were forty of his command on a scout and the Indians killed them all except twelve, whom they captured. Of the twelve captured, the Indians tortured eight of them to death, fastening them down and building fires on them.
