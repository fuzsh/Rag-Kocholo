        "text": "Before attending law school, Bill made his impact as a career Soldier and as a military contractor. The son of a career Air Force pilot, Bill began his own military career when he enlisted at the age of seventeen. During his 29-year Army career (21 years of Active Duty) protecting America’s vital interests as an Infantry Soldier, Bill’s professional efforts were recognized for saving lives. Rising in rank from Private to Lieutenant Colonel and earning the coveted Airborne wings and Ranger tab along the way, Bill served in the Cold War, Desert Storm, the Balkans, and the Iraq War with over 13 years of overseas service. His Reserve time included a stint as a military contractor training the Saudi Arabian National Guard in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Bill and his wife, Kasia, were both at the Pentagon on 9/11.\n\nDuring his tour in Iraq, Bill served as the 1st Infantry Division Anti-Terrorism/ Force Protection Officer and as the Division’s Liaison Officer to the 1st Marine Division during the Battle of Fallujah. After returning from Iraq and during his second tour at the Pentagon, Bill was moved by the courage and sacrifices of the Wounded Warriors visiting from Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospitals. Bill also worked as a Maneuver Training and Feedback Analyst (Part Time/On Call Contractor), at the Army Combat Training Centers at Fort Irwin, California, Hohenfels, Germany, and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. During this period, he completed his Masters of Arts in National Security Affairs at the Institute of World Politics, in Washington, D.C.\n\nLegal Experience: Before Joining Garfinkel Schwartz, Bill served as an Assistant State Attorney in Brevard County, Florida. He was a senior docket attorney representing the State of Florida in prosecuting criminal misdemeanor cases. Bill managed a prosecution docket exceeding 500 active cases from Arraignment through final decisions for Nolle Prosequi, plea resolution. Each case required an analysis of the crimes, ability to prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, admissibility of evidence, the Defendant’s record, and the consideration of the Victim’s rights. “I couldn’t be more excited to join the team at Garfinkel Schwartz. This is an opportunity to apply the sum total of my skills and experience to helping individual Servicemembers, contractors, and their families, who were injured by terrorist groups and weapons, to achieve some justice under the Anti-Terrorism and Defense Base Acts.”"
