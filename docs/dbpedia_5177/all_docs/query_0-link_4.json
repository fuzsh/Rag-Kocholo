He had no educational advantages except what he received in his native land, but by perseverance and industry became a good scholar in the common branches. He was a good speaker, and had great conversational powers. He was conscientious in all his dealings with his fellow-men, and enjoyed a popularity that was the envy of both friends and foes. He joined the Methodist church when quite young, and was always a firm adherent to its principles. In 1808 he married Nancy Wood. But three of their seven children are living - William B., Sarah Ann wife of W. D. Gale, Louisville, Ky., and Henry W. Joseph H., James, Robert and Albert L. are deceased.

His wife died Feb. 4, 1857, aged seventy-two years. He was a Class-Leader in the church many years, and while in Congress was leader of a class composed chiefly of Ohio Congressman.\n\n~ Page 420 - History of Lower Scioto Co., Ohio - Publ.
