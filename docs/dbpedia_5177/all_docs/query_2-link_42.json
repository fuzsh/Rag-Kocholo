        "text": "DOCTOR Who legend William Russell has sadly died aged 99 as emotional tributes pour in.\n\nThe icon, best known for playing school teacher Ian Chesterton in the first ever Doctor Who series, passed away yesterday.\n\nRussell first featured in An Unearthly Child, the first ever Doctor Who story, alongside William Hartnell who played the First Doctor.\n\nHe starred with Jacqueline Hill as Barbara Wright, Carole Ann Ford as Susan Foreman and later Maureen O'Brien as Vicki.\n\nHe was genuinely one of the nicest, sweetest, kindest man you could meet. Weâ€™ve lost a Dr Who giant\n\nEmotional fan tribute\n\nThe beloved actor appeared in nearly every episode of the first two Doctor Who seasons.\n\nThey would pave the way to one of the nation's favourite franchises.\n\nAfter exiting the popular show in 1965, Russell went on to narrate Doctor Who audio stories.\n\nHe was later awarded with a Guinnness World Record for the longest gap between TV appearances when he reprised his role as Ian in Jodie Whittaker's final episode, The Power of the Doctor, much to fans' delight.\n\nRussell also featured in the classic The Great Escape, as well as the 1978 Superman movie and as Ted Sullivan in Coronation Street.\n\nHe also made an appearance in an episode of The Black Adder, as a late replacement for Wilfrid Brambell.\n\nThe star was also recognised as a successful theatre actor and earned himself a number of roles with the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre and the Globe Theatre.\n\nNo cause of death has yet been confirmed.\n\nHe leaves behind his wife Etheline, who he tied the knot with in 1984, and their son Alfred - who has taken after his father and starred as Dean Thomas in the Harry Potter films.\n\nThe actor is also survived by children from his first marriage, Vanessa, Laetitia and Robert, and four grandchildren.\n\nHEARTFELT TRIBUTES\n\nTributes have poured in from devastated fans across social media.\n\nDoctor Who star Nicole Bryant wrote: \"What sad news to say farewell to William Russell\n\n\"What a wonderful man with a delightful family an extraordinary life & career.\"\n\nAnother shared: \"Raising a glass to William Russell, who has left us just a few months shy of his 100th birthday.\n\nOne of the first of us to step through those magical blue box doors into wonder and adventure\n\nTribute\n\n\"Already a star when he became a crucial part of Doctor Whoâ€™s genesis, his long and remarkable career embraced everything from Shakespeare to Blackadder. A fine actor and a lovely man.\"\n\nA third heartbroken fan penned: \"William Russell what a wonderful wonderful man he was.\n\n\"He appeared in the very first episode and came back in Power of the Doctor (Oh how we all cried when he appeared).\n\n\"He was genuinely one of the nicest, sweetest, kindest man you could meet. Weâ€™ve lost a Dr Who giant.\"\n\n\"Rip to a fantastic man who brought us the world of Doctor who!,\" wrote someone else.\n\n\"Oh no thatâ€™s very sad news to hear. One of the first of us to step through those magical blue box doors into wonder and adventure. Was wonderful to see him in Power of the Doctor,\" agreed another fan."
