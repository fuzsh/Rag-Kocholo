What a lovely man,” said First and Second Doctor companion actress Anneke Wills.\n\nMeanwhile a statement posted on Seventh Doctor Sylvester McCoy’s official social media page said: “RIP William Russell. We lived near each other and I’d bump into him. He always gave me a beautiful generous smile of welcome. Sadly no more.”"
