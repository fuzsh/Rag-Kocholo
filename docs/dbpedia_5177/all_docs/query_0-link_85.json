        "text": "Ada Area Doctor Committee\n\nIn early 1985, a group of Ada Area citizens recognized the need for a local physician.\n\nThis resulted in the formation of the Ada Area Doctor Committee with a purpose of soliciting funds to assist in bringing a doctor into our community. After lots of discussions, ideas were presented. It was decided to send out information letters to Ada area residents. This letter explained the need and purpose of the committee's goals as well as asking for donations to fund a scholarship. This scholarship would assist in the educational costs of a medical student to finish school and then return to our area to practice.\n\nFuture meeting dates were set, inviting those interested. It was hoped that these meetings could be utilized to answer questions and clarify the need for and how this scholarship would work and be repaid by the recipient. 5,300 information letters were mailed with 157 responses from individuals, families, local groups and businesses interested in contributing to our cause. Contributions were received and by August 1985, $20,000.00 had been donated.\n\nThe committee met to pour over the various candidates for the position. Lawrence Kuk was selected as the recipient. After all the details were worked out and his education completed, Dr. Kuk and his family moved to Ada. He opened his practice in 1990. According to the agreement, Dr. Kuk repaid his loan to the Ada Area Doctor Committee by 1995. Dr. Kuk remains, as of this writing, a practicing physician and a contributing citizen in Ada and the surrounding areas.\n\nOriginal trustees include: officers: David Houx*, chairman; Terry Keiser, vice chairman; Jack Daniels, treasurer and Saundra Neely, secretary; Wayne Fleming*, Clyde Dornbush, Mary Bowden, Jim Turner, Charles VanDyne, Rick Combs and Fred Heifner, and Beulah Hays*. Bryan Marshall eventually replaced Wayne Fleming and Jack Daniels as a trustee. A huge thank you goes to Lou Lobenhofer for his expertise in getting the tax-exempt status for this project.\n\nFollow up meetings were held with the trustees and contributors to update and report funds collected and repaid. Later, discussions were held as to how this committee/fund might support another future medical professional coming to the Ada area.\n\nIn April 2019 the remaining trustees: Terry Keiser, chairman; Mary Bowden, vice chair; Bryan Marshall, treasurer and Saundra Neely, secretary, along with Charles VanDyne and Dr. Lawrence Kuk met to discuss the use of the funds in the account. After much discussion the decision was made to include all the Ada Area Doctor Committee monies previously raised and interest from those funds be placed with the Hardin County Community Foundation to support the \"health care related education\" of a person in the Ada area. The scholarship is to be dispersed under the guidelines agreed upon with the Hardin County Community Foundation.\n\n(*deceased)\n\nTHE BERNARD FAMILY FUND\n\nDESIGNATED TO EDUCATION & MUSIC PROGRAMS &\n\nMARY LOU JOHNSON LIBRARY\n\nThis fund was established in 2002 by Leo J. \"Barney\" Bernard in memory of his wife, Elizabeth \"Betty\" Fox Bernard and their son, Michael E. Bernard. It was created to enhance music programs in the Kenton City Schools which the Board of Education is otherwise unable to fund and to support the Mary Lou Johnson/Hardin County District Library in such amounts as the Foundation trustees determine.\n\nBernard is a name long associated with business and civic activities in Hardin County. Leo Bernard owned and operated the Bernard Furniture Store in Kenton from 1956 to 1974.

This time with the JAG Corps provided the couple with new adventures as they found themselves stationed in Seoul, South Korea and in Washington, D.C. In 1968, Jim became the only attorney from Hardin County to be admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court.

He was elected president of his high school class, graduated and was appointed to and graduated from West Point in 1946. He did not know it at the time, but a daughter, Catherine Moore, was born on December 27, 1925 in Texas, of a prominent Army physician. Catherine and Debow would meet while he was in the service and marry in 1949. They had a son, DeBow II, who died in 2014.\n\nDebow was commissioned in the Infantry. He served overseas for a total of seven years including stations in Japan, Germany, Iran, Korea, and Vietnam. He attended and taught at the Infantry School, Fort Benning, GA, attended the Army Command and Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, KS and the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force base, AL. He was the chief of the nuclear branch of the Defense Atomic Support Agency at Sadia Base, Albuquerque, NM, and liaison to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory for the military service and concurrently, earned a masters’ degree from the University of Kansas and a PhD in nuclear engineering at the University of New Mexico. As chief of the nuclear branch of the Defense Atomic Support Agency, Dr. Freed became the principal briefer for the military services on atomic and nuclear matters for military, congressional and other national visiting groups for three years when interest in those areas was extremely high. He was later assigned to the West Point faculty to help modernize the physics program and initiate an academic major in nuclear engineering.\n\nCatherine held a bachelor degree from the University of Texas, master’s degree from the University of Kansas and PhD (honorary) from Ohio Northern University. She was a full partner in life and contributed greatly while Dr. Freed served. Catherine taught at the University of Kansas and New Mexico as well as near their stations. Catherine was very active in campus and community affairs and held many leadership roles that contributed greatly to the success of the institutions and communities they served. She was a lay minister in the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, taught Bible study and conducted services. Catherine was on Regional Girl Scout councils, worked with the United Way and other service and charitable organizations. Dr. Freed credits Catherine for many of their opportunities to serve.\n\nIn 1987, Dr. Freed was chosen by the Army Chief of Staff and the West Point Superintendent from among 47,000 West Point graduates as the model for the study which led to the fifth purpose of a West Point cadet’s education which was for each cadet “to aspire to a lifetime of service to the nation.” Dr. and Mrs. Freed’s commitment to military service is recognized in a room at West Point that is dedicated to them and in the book West Point Leadership, Profiles of Courage, which profiles 180 West Point graduates, who are characterized as having helped shape the world. The text notes the key role and unique contributions Mrs. Freed made to the institutions which prospered under their leadership and in their lifetime of service to the nation. The Freed’s greatly enjoyed military service but believed they could make additional contributions in private church-related higher education as a part of their commitment to lifelong service. After 23 years of military service Dr. Freed retired from active duty and entered into private higher education as Dean at Mount Union College. Then as President of Monmouth College in Illinois and later became President of Ohio Northern University, Ada, OH and finally serving as President of the University of Findlay, Findlay, OH for a total of 32 years of college or university presidency. The Freed Family Foundation has directed the distributions of the income from their donation to the Hardin County Community Foundation to support specifically, Ohio Northern University, Village of Ada, the Ada area and Hardin, Hancock and Allen county organizations.\n\nWilliam D. & Krista S.

In 1962, he joined the Kenton City Police Department where he remained for the next 16.5 years. In his later years with Kenton Police Department he was assigned, along with other policing duties, to Kenton’s downtown square where he wrote parking meter citations and managed/repaired the city’s parking meters. He enjoyed getting to know people and tease with them. Folks affectionately referred to him as “Meter Maid’ or sometimes “Barney Fife”. Always the jokester, George enjoyed the teasing but no one was immune to the dreaded parking ticket. There is a family tale that the ground actually shook the day Officer George wrote a parking ticket to his own mother!\n\nIn 1978 George became part of the Hardin County Sheriff’s Office where he performed the duties of Deputy Sheriff. A year later he was required to resign his position to allow him to run for the office of Hardin County Sheriff. He campaigned throughout the County and worked at K-Mart parttime running a floor polishing machine. George’s campaign was successful, as the top vote-geter, and he was sworn in as the Hardin County Sheriff in January 1981. A few days after taking in his new responsibilities K-Mart called the Sheriff’s Office. They asked if George could come and show them how to work the floor polishing machine and, always willing to help his community,...he did!!!\n\nGeorge served five terms as Hardin County Sheriff. He honored his campaign promises and established the Office’s Canine Unit, created a Detective Bureau, and made meaningful strides against the use and sale of illegal drugs in Hardin County. George took his job very seriously and, as always, lived the Law Enforcement moto of “Protect and Serve”. He particularly enjoyed mentoring young officers, three of whom went on to be elected County Sheriffs in both Hardin and Union Counties. George was a lifetime member of the Buckeye State Sheriff’s Association and the National Sheriff’s Association. In 1994 he was awarded the BSSA Medal of Honor, the NSA Medal of Valor, and received the Law Enforcement Citation from the Order of the Purple Heart for being wounded in the line of duty. Sheriff George often warmly referred to the Hardin County residents as “his people”, folks who would come and go in his life and he remembered them all. He had an innate ability to make everyone feel at ease. His door was never closed to anyone and he treated them all the same. Whether it was his smile that lit up a room, or his humor and stories, you couldn’t deny his presence. Simply put Sheriff George touched lives and felt privileged for the opportunity to do so. Upon his retirement in 2001 George established Wilson Personalized Footballs, a vendor sales business where he sold customized Wilson footballs mostly for high school teams and federal agencies gift shops.\n\nGeorge passed away in February 2022 from complications of COVID.\n\nPatricia Lee (St. Clair) Smith was born and raised in Sandusky County, Ohio the eldest daughter of five children.

Pat continues to live in Kenton and remains active in her community.\n\nGeorge and Pat married in 1973. They believe strongly in Hardin County and its many\n\norganizations which reach out to friends and neighbors. Their Memorial Fund was created to\n\nsupport the efforts to meet Hardin County needs. The Smith extended family includes the pride and treasures of their lives, Karin Sue and husband Rod; Kevin L. and wife Sarah; Keith Randall; Kimberly Kay; grandson Jesse Ray and wife Emily; grandson Robert Cody and wife Alexa; and three great grandchildren, Kenton Jack, Millie Rae, and Kimber Marie.

Victory/Dudley township where she was born on June 11, 1926, Ruthanna was the daughter of Hattie (Shuster) and Charles Tobey. She was the youngest of six children. Her father was hoping that the sixth child would be a boy and at her birth, he declared \"Well, she'll have to be my little Jake.\" Thus, she was known by her family and close friends as \"Jake\" her entire life. Her siblings were : sisters Major Mary I. Tobey (career Army nurse), E. Maxine Steinman (of Kenton), and Betty C. Tobey; her brothers, Charles H. Tobey and Lowell Shuster (a first cousin whose mother died shortly after childbirth as was raised by the Tobey's). The children were raised during the depression and Ruthanna said she had 2 dresses: one on a nail in the bedroom and one on her back. This no doubt led to her fondness as a working adult for clothes shopping for herself and others. When her sister, Mary, and both brothers left on a bus the same day to enter World War II she took up the slack to farm alongside her father.\n\nRuthanna lived most of her life in the village of Mt. Victory. Ruthanna could be seen around town wearing stylish work clothes-never pants for herself or female employees-or in a baseball cap and tattered clothing if she was in the midst of a project. She was a lady of contrasts who had a stern appearance, but a very soft heart.\n\nAs a high school student, she worked for the Mt. Victory Schools and the Mt. Victory State Bank. After graduation, from Mt. Victory High School in 1944 Ms. Tobey was planning on attending Findlay College, having received a full scholarship. But as many of the \"greatest generation\" she remained in Mt. Victory caring for her ill mother and supporting her sister, Betty, who had polio as a child and required physical assistance. Ruthanna began her work life at the bank as a teller, advancing to assistant cashier and cashier before becoming president of the bank. She had many friends in the Amish community who banked with her. If children came into the bank, she always had a special sweet treat for them. She remained president of Mt. Victory State bank until her retirement in 1995.\n\nIn 1975 Ruthanna was appointed by Governor James A. Rhodes to serve on the Ohio State Banking Board. She had the honor of being the first woman appointed to this position. During this same time, about a 20-year span, the Mt. Victory Bank was operated by an all-female team of employees.\n\nHer sister E. Maxine Tobey Steinman lived in Kenton and Ruthanna spent much time with her nephews and nieces: Dr. Charles Steinman of Salisbury NC, John Steinman of Kenton and Jane Steinman Kaufman of Philadelphia, PA as well as Charles R. Tobey of Battle Creek, MI and Kathy Shuster Pipkin of Ferndale, WA. She is survived by 12 great nephews and nieces and 18 great grand nephews and nieces.\n\nRuthanna always took pride in the Mt. Victory community and surrounding area and served as a trustee of the Hardin County Community Foundation. After 10 years of service, she retired as an Emeritus Trustee. She enjoyed caring for her home throughout her life, with bounteous flowers overflowing the window boxes. It was her pride and joy; she found pleasure in decorating, landscaping, traveling the world, baking pies and collecting walnut period furniture. Her true joy was in her three generations of nephews and nieces. She passed away on December 21, 2019."
