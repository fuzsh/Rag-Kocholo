        "text": "William Russell McCutchen age 63 of Cantonment, FL, passed away on Thursday, May 30, 2024, with his children by his side at his residence.\n\nRusty was born March 25, 1961, in Walterboro, SC to Joseph A. McCutchen and Christine Kirkman. He graduated from Dekalb County High School in 1979 and is an Alumni of Tennessee Technological University in 1983 with his Bachelor of Science in Geology and a minor in Chemistry.\n\nHe was a man of many hobbies. He enjoyed fishing, collecting mineral specimens, gardening, reading, woodworking, and doting over his beloved grandchildren.\n\nRusty is survived by his mother Christine (Max) Kirkman, his three children which he loved dearly Alex McCutchen, Megan (William) Hill, Sara McCutchen, and their mother, Natalyn Plumlee Slaughter; the lights of his life- grandchildren Emmett McCutchen and Nova Rose Hill; as well as, his brother Roger (Carole) McCutchen, sister Lisa (Eric) Lyons, and many nieces and nephews. He is also survived by his devoted girlfriend and caregiver Debby Flaim. He was preceded in death by his father Joseph A. McCutchen, Betty McCutchen, and Lorinda Dickerson.\n\nRusty had a passion and kindness for others; he shared that in his journey through sobriety and fellowship with Alcoholics Anonymous. During his valiant fight with esophageal cancer, Rusty was a bright light for others also experiencing the diagnosis of a terminal illness. He will be greatly missed by many friends and family across Alabama, Florida, and Tennessee."
