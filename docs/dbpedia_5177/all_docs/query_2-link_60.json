        "text": "Of the four original actors to travel in the TARDIS in Doctor Who (1963), he is the most recent one to make a reappearance in the series, in the 2022 Centenary special The Power of the Doctor (2022).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, writer Peter Grimwade originally envisaged him as returning to star opposite Peter Davison as the teacher in Mawdryn Undead: Part One (1983), but Russell proved unavailable due to theatre commitments. The story was then changed to bring back Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.\n\nActing was something I enjoyed doing as a young boy. I found myself drawn towards it. I kept it up when was in the Air Force and organised entertainments for other people. Then, after I left university, I went into rep and continued from there. I think I was rather typecast at first as the dashing young lieutenant or RAF officer, who always seemed to get killed.\n\nWe formed a very happy little group. I was very impressed with Billy (Hartnell), he was a true professional. He had all the switches in the TARDIS marked out exactly in his mind. He had the idea of the Doctor always getting my name wrong. Billy wasn't at all like the Doctor off set, he was just a very professional actor who did his job in his own way.\n\nWe were pushed around a lot sometimes. One of the things we'd always argue about on the studio floor was that certain writers were making us say things that we felt our characters would not say. Eventually we got a script editor, Dennis Spooner, who co-ordinated with the writers and kept an eye on things. We liked to talk a lot about how our characters would develop.\n\nI remember 'Marco Polo' going on for quite a long while, and being under quite a lot of pressure. Despite that, we all enjoyed it tremendously - in fact, we rather enjoyed all the historical stories. Dressing up in the appropriate costumes was always great fun and it looked very splendid. The script was very good, and that contributed to the all-round enjoyment; it concentrated more on the characters, their development and the narrative and so, I think, the story was told in a believable way."
