        "text": "A legendary traveler on the TARDIS has left time and space.\n\nBritish actor William Russell died on Monday and his death was announced yesterday. He was 99, so he lived a long life by any standard. His death, though, severs one of the last living ties to the birth of Doctor Who, one of the most iconic sci-fi productions ever.\n\nFor you see, William Russell – already famous for starring as Lancelot in the ITV Drama The Adventures Of Sir Lancelot, was cast as a main character – schoolteacher Ian Chesterton – for a new TV program supposedly meant to entertain and educate across all ages. Yes, Doctor Who was launched, in part, as an educational program – and one could argue that the show still retains educational aspects through social commentary to this day.\n\nBut pretty apropos that in “An Unearthly Child”, aired on November 23rd, 1963. one of the original main characters was a teacher. Even more apropos was that he (and fellow teacher Barbara Wright, played by Jacqueline Hill) was the eye through which the adult audience would see the adventures of this strange alien traveling in a police box, all the while the younger viewers were represented by Susan, the Doctor’s granddaughter. It helped reinforce the show’s intent to be genuine family entertainment enjoyable across all age groups. After all, you have an everyman, an authority figure who has his world rocked across time and space. The impact on future sci-fi shows meant to entertain across demographics can’t be understated. Surely older viewers were just as enthralled with Mr. Chesterton’s heroics as younger viewers were – and sci-fi, up to and including Doctor Who, still speaks to viewers young and old.\n\nIan Chesterton made his last appearance in Doctor Who in the episode “The Power of the Doctor”. He had made his penultimate TV appearance fifty-seven years earlier, a record-breaking gap. He lived sixty years after “An Unearthly Child”, saw the world change, watched as more and more actors took up the Sonic Screwdriver and made their own impact on one of TV’s most iconic characters, saw Doctor Who get canceled and revived, and saw its fanbase grow across the globe. He even took part in several of the audio dramas. Russell, though a fandom star, would go on to enjoy other work. For instance, he starred in the iconic British soap Coronation Street as Ted Sullivan, the short-lived partner of series regular Rita. He was also the Eighth Elder in Superman. Yeah, this guy did Superman, DW, and Corrie. (One of his children, by the way, is Alfred Enoch – known for playing Dean Thomas in the Harry Potter films. Looks like the acting bug was genetic.)\n\nSadly, one of the last ties to a world before us has been severed. The only surviving actor from that first episode is Carole Ann Ford (Susan). Beyond her, director Waris Hussein is the last major player involved with that first serial. But Russell’s legacy will live as long as Doctor Who airs and beyond.\n\nFarewell, Ian. You made it – in London 1965 and beyond!"
