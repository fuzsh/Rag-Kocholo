He was served with the subpoena after that.\n\nRussell was one of a few White House staffers to continue working for Trump after he left office and is now a senior adviser to the former President.\n\nA lawyer for Russell did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRussell had not previously been interviewed by investigators as part of the Justice Department’s sprawling criminal probe."
