AGNES RUSSELL BOLING FORK BAPTIST CHURCH Baptist Churches of Tennessee Church History Research & Archives 220 Graystone Drive, Gallatin, Tennessee 37066\n\nBirth\n\nWilliam Russell's birth has been reported as Tennessee [1] or Tryon (now Rutherford) County, North Carolina. He may have been born in the Watauga Settlement, in what is now Tennessee, but was previously in North Carolina territory. The Russell and Bean families were among the early settlers of Watauga. According to one source, William was born 1760, in Tryon ,North Carolina, the son of George Russell (born 1720) and Elizabeth (Bean) Russell. [2] (Note: In 1779, Tryon County was divided into Lincoln and Rutherford Counties in North Carolina, and ceased to exist.)\n\nMarriage and Early Life\n\nWilliam's family migrated to the Watauga Settlement, in what was then Grainger County, Tennessee when he was about 9 years of age.\n\nWilliam married , Agnes McCollough,[3] [last name needs verification; the name Agnes Russell appears on Baptist Church rolls in Franklin County along with William.] born about 1745, in Virginia. For more information regarding the children of William and Agnes, see her profile.\n\nRussell settled in Franklin County, Tennessee, where his cabin served as the first county court house. A replica of this log cabin is on site at the railroad museum in Cowan, Tennessee. In 1808, William and Absalom Russell received grants on the Boiling Fork River.\n\nMilitary Service Major Russell was a captain of a Battallion of Volunteer Mounted Gunmen during the War of 1812/Creek Indian War. William fought alongside Andrew Jackson and Sam Houston at the battle of Horseshoe Bend. In a flanking maneuver, he and his group of mounted spies along with friendly Cherokees assailed the Red Sticks from the rear, seizing the victory:\n\n\"Col. Gideon Morgan, who commanded the Cherokees, Capt. Kerr, and Capt. William Russell, with a part of his company of spies, were among the first that crossed the river. They advanced into the village and very soon drove the enemy from the huts up the river bank to the fortified works from which they were fighting you. They pursued and continued to annoy during your whole action.\" [4]\n\nThe Creeks had been fighting the Americans in their front at such close quarters that their bullets flattened upon the bayonets thrust through the portholes. This attack from the rear by 500 Cherokee diverted their attention and gave opportunity to the Tennesseans, adopted Cherokee Sam Houston among them, to swim over the breastwork. With more than half their number dead upon the ground, the rest of the Creeks turned and plunged into the river, only to find the banks on the opposite side lined with enemies and escape cut off.\n\nThe men sent out to count the dead found 557 warriors dead within the enclosure. Coffee estimated that another 250 to 300 were shot in the water.\n\nIn addition to the Horseshoe Bend battle (27 Mar 1814), Major Russell was involved in the Pensacola campaign. Davy Crockett was in his command. They mustered in Fayetteville, TN, crossed the Tennessee River at Muscle Shoals, and marched to Pensacola via Fort Montgomery. The Battle of Pensacola took place on 7 Nov 1814, and they returned to Fort Montgomery. [5]\n\nSome secondary sources say he was Andrew Jackson's chief of staff at the Battle of New Orleans, but this has not been substantiated by primary sources.\n\nA rifle which belonged to Major Russell is in the collection at the Alamo and is viewable on request by arrangements with the curator. There is a story in the family that Rufus Burleson of Texas was baptized into the Baptist church by George Daniel Russell, grandson of Major William, and that as a token of his friendship presented his friend his grandfather's gun, used in the War of 1812. (Edward Burleson was a major figure in the Texas Revolution.) The gun is a .52 caliber Pennsylvania long rifle with an octagonal barrel and double set trigger. It bears a silver plate with the inscription \"Maj. Russels, old gun. Presented by J.B. to Joseph Burlesson of Texas, 1839.\"\n\nSettling in Alabama After his military service, he settled in what is now Franklin County, Alabama, and is credited with being the first white settler in that area. The town of Russellville in that county is named in his honor.[6] In any case, many sources relate that he found the land in what is now Franklin County to be a good place to settle (supposedly on the way to New Orleans, but probably after crossing at Muscle Shoals in the Pensacola campaign). \"Major Russell settled two miles east of the present site of Russellville. The old cemetery is near where the original cabin was built. After cutting Jackson Highway from Nashville to New Orleans, he came back and built the first pioneer cabin in Franklin County.\"[7]\n\n\"Among the earliest settlers of this immediate section was Major William Russell. He came about 1815. Along with him or following close behind him were many of Jackson's soldiers, who had first seen the country on their return from the Battle of New Orleans.\"[8]\n\nDeath\n\nWilliam died in 1825 and is buried near Russellville, Franklin, Alabama. [9] [10]\n\n\" Died at his residence in this county, on Wednesday the 16th inst. Major Wm Russell aged about 63 years. In the demise of this man, Society has lost an ornament - the poor of his neighborhood, a kind benefactor - the survivors of his family, an indulgent protector, and his country a patriot. On our western frontier from his boyhood, the opponent, but never an unrelenting victor - An officer in the late Creek and Seminole wars, he had the friendship of his commander and the love and respect of his men. These best exhibit his character as a soldier.\" [The Tuscumbian, 28 Mar 1825, Tuscumbia, Alabama]\n\nNotes\n\nP.252 SOUTHERN KITH AND KIN\n\nGrandmother told many thrilling stories of her lonely vigils during Grandpa’s frequent hunting excursions and many stories of Major Bill Russell’s adventures. Of General Jackson sending him to find out the fate of Ft. Mims during the Creek Indian Wars, which he did, but had his hunting shirt shot full of holes, though he escaped with a few scratches. Col. Gordon sent Grandpa George Russell and David Crockett to locate the Indians. After two days they found the deserted Indian Camp, with fires still smoking and large quantities of corn buried, but the Indians were gone. General Jackson then sent Major Bill Russell, my great-grandfather, and his oldest son, Captain Bill Russell, out to try to locate the Indians. They rode to the top of a hill and Major Bill, as was his custom, dismounted and stood by the side of his horse to listen. There was a great cawing of crows. Major Bill said to his son: “That is too many crows. Those are Indians.” Almost at once the opposite slope came alive with Indians, which frightened the Major’s horse and he ran away, leaving the Major afoot. He ordered his son to go at once and report the matter to General Jack- son and he would get to camp if he could. In going up the hill he gained on the Indians, but in going down hill they gained on him. General Jackson’s army was stationed in Horseshoe Bend, a bend of the Taladega River, and into this bend the charging Indians rushed with Major Bill in the lead. Soon his famous rifle was cracking with deadly effect. This was one of the greatest slaughter of Indians in Indian Warfare. The bravery of this Indian charge was never ex¬ celled and General Jackson’s victory was complete, practically ending the war. This battle, however, did not end the history of Major Bill Russell’s old gun. I have furnished a more elaborate history of it to George, which I think that he has. The gun now rests as a souvenir in the Davy Crockett Room of the Alamo, I feel sure that it was placed there by Albert Sydney Burleson of San Antonio, who was Post Master General under Woodrow Wilson. Mr. Richard Burleson and Dr. Rufus Burleson exhausted their efforts to secure a place for it in Baylor University, and my brother, George Dallas Russell, tried to rescue it from Murry Burleson. I taught Murry Burleson’s children for three years and he allowed me to care for the gun and to hunt squirrels with it in the Colorado river bottoms. I felt that I was a reproach to the Russell name if I failed to hit a squirrel anywhere except m the head. It was hand made and kept in such prime condition that every dent of the hammer could be plainly seen. o me it was a symbol of that Liberty and bravery for which it has always spoken and for which it still speaks for generations yet unborn.”\n\n[11]\n\nList of children needs verification.\n\nUnverified Information\n\nThe following unverified notes are preserved from the older biography. is said to list William as the son of Captain George Russell and Elizabeth (Bean) Russell, but I cannot find this information in the book [CBB].\n\n\"William married first Charity _______? There are no reported children of this marriage.\" [documentation needed]\n\nThey [William and Agnes] were the parents of nine children born in Washington County, Tennessee, Fauquier County, Virginia, North Carolina, and Wilkes County, Georgia. Such is the life of a soldier. It seems as though Agnes was a \"camp follower.\" [documentation needed]\n\nWilliam was born in 1750. He passed away in 1825.
