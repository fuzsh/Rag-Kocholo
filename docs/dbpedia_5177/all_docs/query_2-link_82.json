        "text": "Tributes are pouring in for Doctor Who actor William Russell, who has died at the age of 99.\n\nThe English actor played Ian Chesterton (opposite William Hartnell as Doctor Who) in 77 episodes, from the show’s beginnings in 1963 until 1965.\n\nHe rose to fame in 1956 in the ITV series The Adventures of Sir Lancelot, while his post-Doctor Who CV included roles in Superman (1978), Mackenzie (1980) and Coronation Street (1992).\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nHe also appeared in several Doctor Who TV spin-offs from the 2000s onwards, including Doctor Who: Short Trips (2010-11), The Lost Stories (2010-13), The Companion Chronicles (2009-14) and The Early Adventures (2014-16).\n\nHis most recent Doctor Who appearance was to reprise his role as Ian Chesterton for the 2022 season of the beloved BBC show,\n\nRussell died on June 3, The Guardian reports. The cause of death has not been given.\n\nBorn in Sunderland in 1924, he caught the acting bug while studying at Oxford University in the early 1940s.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1950s he was treading the boards at iconic theatre venues such as Tunbridge Wells and the Oxford Playhouse before moving into television and eventually movies.\n\nTributes have poured in for the acting stalwart, with the BBC’s official Doctor Who Instagram sharing a black and white picture of Russell in his role as Ian Chesterton.\n\n“We’re sad to report the passing of William Russell, a legend in Doctor Who history — who played one of the first and original companions to the Doctor, Ian Chesterton,” Doctor Who’s show runner Russell T. Davies wrote.\n\n“An absolute legend, for Doctor Who and the whole of television.\n\n“In 1963, William created the template for the Doctor’s companion, and that’s still going strong, 61 years later.\n\n“He’s adored by the fandom, and will never be forgotten.”\n\nDoctor Who star Nicola Bryant, who played Peri Brown in the mid-1980s, took to X (formerly Twitter) to pay her respects.\n\n“What sad news to say farewell to William Russell,” she wrote.\n\n“What a wonderful man with a delightful family, an extraordinary life and career.\n\n“The most charming smile and twinkling eyes, he always lit up the room.\n\n“I hope there will be many celebrations of this beautiful man.”\n\n“Raising a glass to William Russell, who has left us just shy of his 100th birthday,” wrote actor, writer and director Nicholas Pegg.\n\n“Already a star when he became a crucial part of Doctor Who’s genesis, his long and remarkable career embraced everything from Shakespeare to Blackadder.\n\n“A fine actor and a lovely man.”\n\nRussell is survived by his second wife Etheline, who he married in 1984, and their son Alfred, who is also an actor.\n\nHe also has three children from his first marriage to Balbina Gutierrez."
