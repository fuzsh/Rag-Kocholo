Five persons were engaged in agriculture. Robert S. Russell, age 79, is listed as a pensioner for Revolutionary or Military services. Robert Spotswood Russell moved to Fayette County, KY in 1793 where he took up residence at his estate known as \"Poplar Hill\" on the Russell Cave Pike. He served in the state legislature, was a Sheriff of Fayette County, and was Brig. General in the state militia. He moved to Callaway County, MO in 1835. His biography from William Russell and His Descendants by Anna Russell des Cognets (Lexington, Ky., 1884) follows: ROBERT SPOTSWOOD RUSSELL, third son of Gen. William and Tabitha Adams Russell, was born in Culpeper county, Va., on March 28th, 1762. He was named in affectionate remembrance of ROBERT, the youngest son of Sir Alexander Spotswood, who was killed by Indians in 1755, while in Washington's command. He was eight years of age when his father removed from Culpeper to southwestern Virginia, where he settled on Clinch river. While yet a boy he was actively engaged in defense of the frontier of Virginia against the hordes of Indians that constantly menaced all the settlements. When his father was called to take command of all the troops in western Virginia, he, with his elder brother William, assumed the charge of the family of motherless children. Their services, however, were soon needed in the field, and from feelings of strong patriotism, they both volunteered under Col. William Campbell, who was then about to march in pursuit of a large body of tories. While on the march Robert was detached from the regiment by Col. Campbell, with a guard sufficient to protect the western settlements from the incendiary movements of the tories; which was the cause of his not taking part in the engagement at. King's Mountain. His Indian campaigns were numerous and hazardous. When eighteen years of age, he and his brother William, with a company of twenty or thirty men, went to Tennessee, then a part of North Carolina, and gave protection to the first white men who raised corn on Stone's river above Nashville. Owing to the unsettled condition of the country at that time, and his youth being spent in active military service, his educational advantages, as well as those of his elder brother, were of necessity limited. They were both, however, endowed with fine natural understandings, which, with their practical sense and correct judgment, combined with their experience in their country's service, marked them as no common men. Reared in the storm and trained to self-reliance, they were well prepared to set out as pioneers on the great Wilderness road to plant their homes in Kentucky. He was of an ardent and impulsive nature, and possessed a personal magnetism which made every one his friend. In disposition he was affectionate and demonstrative. Tall and commanding in appearance, he bore strong resemblance to his father; and was remarkable for his great physical strength and activity, which he retained to the end of his life. After the close of the Revolution, he was occupied the greater part of several years in surveying and entering lands for his father in Kentucky and Tenneasee. Early in the year of 1787, he spent some time with his relatives in Culpeper and Shenandoah, and while on that visit, made the acquaintance of the family of Col. Thomas Allen, one of the earliest settlers of the Shenandoah Valley. On the 29th of May, 1787, he was united in marriage with Deborah Montgomery, the eldest daughter of Col. Allen. The paternal grandparents of Deborah were Robert and Deborah Montgomery Allen, who came from Armagh, Ireland, and sattled in tbe Valley, about 1732. Her mother was Abigail Millar, daughter of William and Catherine Du Bois Millar, who were of German descent, and early settlers in the Valley. Col. Allen's residence was in Shenandoah county (now Warren county), and on the Shenandoah river. After the marriage of Robert and Deborah, they lived in or near the town of Front Royal, which was laid out in 1788, and it is found that \"Robert S. Russell was one of its trustees,\" as was also Col. Allen. His settlement in Shenandoah was temporary, as it was his intention to remove to the tract of land given him by his father in Kentucky, which contained one thousand acres, and was known as a part of \"Russell's military survey,'' only a small portion of which he had sold. In 1788, he found it necessary to go to Kentucky to look after his interests there, and on his way he tarried a few days with his father's family at Aspenville. The following letter, written to his wife, gives some idea of the danger of such a journey at that period.\n\nASPENVILLE, October 5th, 1788. MY DEAR WIFE: I write you a few lines to let You know that I am very well, and ready to proceed on my journey. I intend to set out for Kentucky in about four hours from this time. I hope there will be no trouble in the Wilderness. As there are a number of people traveling the road this fall, the Indians are not so troublesome as heretofore. I think constantly of you and my sweet little Abby, and trust that God will protect you both till my return, which I hope will be by the time appointed when I left. Papa and mamma send their best wishes to you and to your honored parents. With my love to you and my little daughter, I remain, your most affectionate, ROBERT S. RUSSELL.\n\nMrs. DEBORAH M. RUSSELL, Shenandoah, Va.\n\nThe reluctance of his wife's relatives to part with her had delayed his removal to Kentucky several years, but in the spring of 1793 he prepared to set out. with his family for his future home. At this time they had three little daughters, and having negroes and stock as well as household goods to remove, the journey was indeed an arduous undertaking. It was, however, accomplished with safety, and upon their arrival on the banks of \"Elkhorn,\" they were warmly greeted and cordially welcomed by his brother's family and by other friends who had preceded them. As soon as practicable they commenced building, and within two years completed a most substantial and comfortable house, built of stone and ornamented with panelings and wood carvings, which still remain in good condition. It was at that time one of the finest houses in the country, the builders having come from Virginia. Many persons came from quite a distance to see it as a specimen of fine workmanship. The site selected for the house was quite elevated, and shaded by a grove of poplars; and they gave it the name of \"Poplar Hill.\" The fine spring which gushed through the limestone at the foot of the hill, was as highly prized as the famous one at Russell's Cave, and its basin in solid rock is the same to-day as then. At \"Poplar Hill\" their large family of ten children were reared, and from it they all married, branched out, and began life for themselves. Within a radius of a few miles were the homesteads of Mr. Robert C. Harrison at \"Elk Hill,\" Mr. John Breckinridge at \"Cabell's Dale,\" Col. Samuel Meredith at \"Winton,\" Maj. Robert Wilson at \"Cedar Grove,\" and Col. William Russell at \"Mount Brilliant,\" which formed quite a little colony of Virginians. These families afforded a large society of young people, who made it a gay neighborhood. Their social gatherings were frequent, and were enlivened by impromptu dances and other amusements. Many interesting stories have been told of the exploits of the belles and beaux of that day. At all these places upon which large families were reared, very little remains to recall those prosperous and happy days. Time has laid his hand upon all. \"Poplar Hill is now owned by Mr. Hart Boswell, who has greatly improved and modernized it, and is kept in fine repair. Gen. Russell cared little for public life. He served as Sheriff of Fayette county, and occasionally as a Representative in the Legislature. He, however took great interest in the military organization of the State, which at that time was regarded as of much importance, and prior to 1810 he was appointed General of the 3d Brigade of Kentucky militia. The following \"General Orders,\" have been found among his papers, and are here given as of interest. They are in the hand-writing of Colonel Daviess, then acting as Aid to Gen. Calmes:\n\nGeneral Orders, 5th Division. The Major General orders that, at the ensuing Regimental Musters, the regiments be paraded at 10 o'clock, or as soon thereafter as possible, and to this end he orders that the field officers be on the ground at half an hour after nine o'clock, and each Major is to receive the Captains of his battalion as they arrive, and conduct them to a place where he may chose to draw up his battalion, when he may order them to ground or stack their arms and be dismissed, till they are ordered to parade and march to the field. The Colonels are ordered to see that no hucksters, or sutlers, or idle people come so near as in any wise to incommode the service. It is the intention of the General, unless circumstances should prevent, to form the officers and non-commissioned officers into a corps in front of the line, and have them exercised in the complete system of field evolutions and maneuvers. The Brigadier Generals will communicate this without delay to the field officers of their respective brigades. By order of the Major General CALMES, JOSEPH HAMILTON DAVIESS, Aid extraordinary to the Major General. September 23d, 1810. N. B. General Robert S. Russell and the officers of his suite are requested to come to General Calmes's house the evening before the muster in Versailles.\n\nGeneral. Russell and Col. Joseph Hamillton Daviess were intimate and warmly attached friends. One of the gold epaulettes which Col. Daviess wore when he was killed, was given as a souvenir to Gen. Russell, who preserved it as a cherished memento. The following letter of Governor Shelby, found among the papers of General Russell, shows that he had still the desire to serve his country in a military capacity.\n\nFRANKFORT, August 12th, 1813. DEAR SIR:--I have been favored by the receipt of your letter of this date, and feel highly gratified by some of the information which it contains; but that the second Regiment of Cavalry should turn out so poorly is indeed strange. I had expected a more patriotic spirit to exist in that corps, which by their organization are selected from the great body of the militia, with more than ordinary privileges. I still hope that they will signalize themselves on this occasion. The Volunteers will not be organized until we arrive at headquarters, unless some event shall require their whole force to concentrate short of that point, and of course it would be improper for me to enter partially into any arrangement. I do not know what General Officers will accompany me, but in any arrangements I shall pay great respect to seniority. When I directed my public address to you, it was under the recollection of your former letters to me, requesting to be employed in the service of your country's cause. All, therefore, that I can say on that score is, that I shall be well pleascd if it suit your convenience to go with me and that I shall be happy in an opportunity at all times to find you co-assistant with the public good and the rights of others, and take pleasure in acknowledging your merits and services to your country. I have the honor to be, most respectfully, � Yr. ob. servant, ISAAC SHELBY. Brigadier General ROBERT S. RUSSELL, Fayette co.\n\nThe expedition referred to in this letter was that of Gev. Shelby to the Canada frontier, and whether Gen. Russell accompanied him, or not, cannot be found. After spending forty-three years of his life at Poplar Hill, and at the age of seventy-three years, he again set out as an emigrant. His children felt that their interests demanded that they should go farther west, where good investments could be made. All had either gone or were going, except his eldest son, and the devoted parents felt that they must follow. In the fall of 1835, \"Poplar Hill\" was sold, and accompanied by three of their children with their families, they once more turned their faces towards the setting sun. It was with full hearts and overflowing eyes that they bade farewell to their beloved home around which clustered so many fond associations and hallowed memories. The trees which they had planted at their first coming, now had branches which sheltered their children and grandchildren. From their advanced years they knew they could not return, and that it was their last adieu. Once upon their way they recovered their cheerfulness, and bore the journey with as little fatigue as their grandchildren who accompanied them. After several weeks they reached Calloway county, Mo., where they found a comfortable home awaiting them. Here they lived, well pleased with the new country yet in its early settlement. From their own doors they frequently saw the wild deer bounding past, and they seemed to live over again their early life in Kentucky. Their children all lived within easy distance of them, and they were happy and contented. Their only grief was that their eldest and dearly loved son remained in Kentucky, but frequent visits from him gladdened their hearts. A few years later the strength of both began to fail, and they deemed it best to give up the cares of house-keeping and divide their remaining days among their children, which they did in 1840. They had both in early life made their profession of Christianity, and their whole lives had been consistent with their faith and declaration; and now that they were full of years, and the \"sere and yellow leaf\" upon them, they were not afraid, being at peace with all the world and with God. While at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Elizabeth Freeland, Gen. Russell died on the 16th of January, 1842, aged eighty years. \"Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace.\" His aged and afflicted widow seemed as one lost, and could not be comforted. On the 11th of June, 1842, after a few days of sickness, she passed away at the age of seventy-five years. Her remains were buried by the side of her husband in the graveyard at Judge Freeland's, where a plain stone tells that ROBERT S. and DEBORAH M. RUSSELL sleep beneath. Their children were eleven in number.\n\nTwo obituaries of Robert Spotswood Russell follow: From the February 12, 1842 issue of the Kentucky Gazette, Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nOBITUARY.\n\nDeparted this life on Sunday, the 16th of January, 1842, in Calloway county, Missouri, Gen. ROBERT SPOTSWOOD RUSSELL, near 80 years of age, whose loss is deeply regretted, by an afflicted widow, and numerous offspring of children, as well as by a most numerous circle of relatives, friends and acquaintances � indeed, there was none that knew him but was his friend - he had no enemy. He was born in Culpeper county, Va. on the 28th of March 1762, and in early life emigrated with his father and family to the neighborhood of Abingdon, in the western part of Virginia. Here the subject of these remarks, in connection with his elder brother William, had charge of a large and then motherless family of children � their father, General Wm. Russell, having been called to the command of all of the troops in Western Virginia � who subsequently was transferred to the Continental army, and with his regiment ordered to Charleston, S. C. Here he was made a prisoner of war, with the army there assembled, when captured by the British. These two brothers, under the influence of the same patriotic feeling, volunteered their services under Col. Campbell, then about to march in pursuit of a large body of tories -- On the march, Robert, the younger brother, was detached from the regiment by Col. Campbell, with a sufficient guard to protect the Western settlement from the threatened incendiary movements of the tories � and hence was not in the battle of King�s mountain. His Indian campaigns were numerous and hazardous. When a youth, he, with 20 or 30 others in company, were the first white men that ever raised corn on Stone�s river, above Nashville, Tenn. He married in Shenandoah county, Va., and with his family moved, in 1792, to Kentucky, and settled on a military survey in Fayette county, granted his father for his services as Captain in the British army, under Gov. Braddock, against the French and Indians --- Here he resided for 43 years, rearing a large family, and in the full enjoyment of the confidence and friendship of his fellowmen. During this period, he was 20 years one of the County Court Magistrates, high Sheriff of the county, Commanding General of the 3d Brigade, and whenever a candidate, a Representative in the State Legislature.\n\nIn 1835, with all his family and children�s families, (with one exception) he emigrated to Missouri, where he enjoyed uninterrupted good health, until a few days previous to his death. At the age of 30, he embraced religion, and warmly and devoutly, by word and example, sustained the cause of Christianity for 50 years. He died in the full confidence of the promises of his Lord and Savior. His earthly remains now lay in the Far West, and we entertain no doubt his soul rests in Heaven. �Our loss is his eternal gain.� R. Jan. 31st, 1842.\n\nObituary from The Columbia Patriot, Columbia, Boone County, Missouri, January 22, 1842.\n\nOBITUARY\n\nDeparted this life on the 16TH instant, at the residence of his son-in-law, Judge Freeland, in Callaway county, Missouri, Gen�l. ROBERT S. RUSSELL, in the 80th year of his age.\n\nThe subject of this notice, although as a mere youth, performed valuable, and distinguished service in our glorious struggle for freedom: He afterwards served several sessions, as a member of the popular branch of the Virginia Legislature. About fifty years ago, he emigrated from his native State of Virginia, and settled near Lexington, Fayette county, Kentucky; where he continued to reside, until the fall of 1835, when, with most of his numerous family, he moved to Missouri.\n\nIn Kentucky, Gen. Russell is favorably known, as having filled many important civil, and military stations; and is believed to have enjoyed as large a share of the affection and confidence of the people, as any other citizen in that patriotic State. He died the only surviving child of Gen. Wm. Russell known as a gallant and efficient officer, at the desperate battle of Point Pleasant, and subsequently as the Commandant of one of the Virginia Regiments, during the Revolution.\n\nHe left an aged companion, the mother of all of his children, with whom he lived 55 years.\n\nAs a husband, father, neighbor, and citizen, it is impossible, that any man could have better sustained these several relationships, as the deep feeling consequent upon his death abundantly testify.\n\nHe died as he had long lived, a worthy member of the church of Christ, in the full hope of a blessed immortality.

His biography from William Russell and His Descendants by Anna Russell des Cognets (Lexington, Ky., 1884) follows: WILLIAM HENRY RUSSELL, born October 9th, 1802. Some account of his public life and services is given in the following letter of Hon. Robert J. Walker to President Andrew Johnson.\n\nWashington, D. C., May 9th, 1867. To his Excellency, The President of the United States:\n\nI am prompted to this act by my knowledge of the eminent fitness of Col. Russell for the position, and my conviction that his appointment would secure the faithful and intelligent discharge of the duties of a responsible position. Col. Russell is a native of Favette county, Ky. He was a member of the Legislature of that State in 1830; and was mainly instrumental in securing the election of Mr. Clay, an old political opponent, to the U. S. Senate in 1831; so acknowledged by Mr. Clay himself. In the fall of 1831, Col. Russell emigrated to Missouri; and in the summer of 1832 was Judge-Advocate of a regiment in the Black Hawk war. In 1838 and '40, he was a member of the Legislature from Ca!loway county of that State; serving in 1839 as a member of the Harrisburg Convention, and urging with consistent zeal Mr. Clay for the Presidency. In 1844, he was appointed, by President Harrison, Marshal of Missouri - comprising at that time Missouri proper, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, and Nebraska. In 1846, he went to California at the head of a large emigration. On his arrival there he was appointed, by Commodore Stockton, Secretary of State, while Fremont was acting Governor. In 1848, he was a member of the Philadelphia Convention that nominated General Taylor, but withdrew before the nomination was made, because he opposed that of Gen. Taylor and regarded the Whig party as having degenerated into a mere personal party. In 1849, Col. Russell returned to California, where he was made an honorary member with Gov. Waller of the Convention that framed the State Constitution. In 1851, he was appointed Collector of Customs at Monterey, which position he held until his successor was appointed by Mr. Pierce. He practiced law with the late Senator Baker and Edward Stanley of North Carolina, in San Francisco, Cal. In 1861, he was appointed by Mr. Lincoln, U. S. Consul at Trinidad de Cuba, which office he held until after the assassination, receiving the plaudits of all for the faithful manner in which he discharged his duties, especially for his successful effort to rescue the Joseph Maxwell from the claims of the Spanish government, she being a prize of the Confederate steamer \"Sumpter\". His record is spotless, and I most earnestly commend him to your favorable consideration. Yours very respectfully, R. J. WALKER.\n\nCol. Russell died in Washington, D. C., October 13th, 1873, and was buried in Oak Lawn Cemetery, Georgetown, D.C. He married in early life Miss Zanette Freeland, of Baltimore. The biography of William Henry Russell from the Dictionary of American Biographyy (New York, 1935) follows (note that he was actually born in Fayette County, KY but practiced law in Nicholas County, KY): RUSSELL, WILLIAM HENRY (Oct. 9, 1802-Oct, 13, 1873), politician, California pioneer, was born in Nicholas County, Ky., the son of Robert Spotswood and Deborah (Allen) Russell and grandson of Gen. William Russell. He practised law in his native county and in 1830 represented it in the legislature; about this time he married Zanette Freeland of Baltimore. He early came to the attention of Henry Clay, who befriended him, and it is said that for a time he was Clay's secretary. In 1831 he emigrated to Callaway County, Mo., and in the following year served in the Black Hawk War; in 1841 he was appointed United States marshal of the District of Missouri, which included the Indian Country. He had by this time acquired the courtesy title of \"colonel.\" His term ended in 1845, and in May 1846, near Independence, Mo., he joined a wagon-train of California emigrants, among whom was Edwin Bryant, later the author of What I Saw in California (1848), in which Russell figures. He was elected captain of the company but near Fort Laramie was displaced. With Bryant and seven others he continued the journey on muleback by way of Fort Bridger to the site of the future Salt Lake City and then across the Great Salt Desert, the first to follow Fremont's track of the year before. Arriving at Sutter's Fort on Sept. 1, and proceeding to Yerba Buena and Monterey, Russell joined Fremont's California Battalion with the rank of major and was one of the peace commissioners who framed the treaty of Cahuenga, Jan. 13, 1847. Fremont [q.z:] a few days later appointed him secretary of state. On the downfall of the Fremont administration in March, Russell left for the east by way of Santa Fe, reaching the Missouri settlements in July and thence going to Washington; he was one of Fremont's principal witnesses in the court-martial, which began in November. In 1849 he returned to California and practised law at San Jose and elsewhere until at least 1854. Later he went east again and in 1861 was appointed consul at Trinidad, Cuba. By 1865 he was back in the United States, and two years later sought vainly to get the post of consul-general at Havana. He died in Washington and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery. Russell appears as \"Col. R___\"in one passage in Parkman's The California and Oregon Trail (1849, ch. x) and in many passages in other Western books of the time. He was a large man, expansive in manner, boastful and bombastic in speech. His egotism sometimes made him the sport of his companions. In a story often told about him, he is said to have mistaken the chorus of \"tu-whoo's\" from a flock of owls for a challenge of \"Who are you?\" and to have thundered back, \"Col. William H. Russell, of Kentucky--a bosom friend of Henry Clay!\" Ever after he was known as \"Owl\" Russell. He was, however, a man of many substantial and endearing qualities, and was widely popular. He is sometimes confused with William Hepburn Russell [q.v.], the founder of the Pony Express. [Anna Russell des Cognets, William Russell and His Descendants ( 1884) ; W. H.

At 33 years of age Andrew became the father of Eugenia Erwin January 26, 1864. His biography from History of Kentucky by Judge Charles Kerr (Chicago and New York, 1922) follows: Col. Eugene Erwin was a soldier whose record of action and high character entitles him to all the honors paid a military career in every age of the world. He was born at Woodlands, adjoining Lexington, then the home of his father, James Erwin, whose wife was the favorite child of Henry Clay. Eugene Erwin lived for several years in Missouri. He was in Missouri when the war broke out between the North and South, and immediately offered his services to the Confederacy. His military career of about two years was most brilliant. He was a magnetic leader, was idolized by his soldiers, and until his heroic death he was almost constantly at posts of danger. He was commissioned major by the commander of the State Guards of Missouri, and participated in the battles of Wilson's Creek, Lexington and Sugar Creek, also Springfield and Elkhorn Tavern. Then on leaving Missouri and joining the forces east of the Mississippi he was made lieutenant colonel and given command of a battalion. He led the assault upon the attack of Iuka, after which he was commissioned colonel and assigned to the command of a regiment. He and his regiment were also assigned prominent places in the advance upon Corinth, and after that ill-starred attack, only thirty members of his regiment were able to answer roll call. His regimental flag carried in that and many subsequent engagements was never captured, and is now in the possession of his grandson Eugene Erwin Simpson of Lexington. Colonel Erwin himself was severely wounded at Corinth, but in a month had rejoined his command. At the beginning of the battle in front of Port Gibson, May l, 1863, he was ordered to re-enforce the left wing of the Confederate command, and after a forced march of eight miles made in 2 1/2 hours brought his command on the ground at a critical moment, when the entire left of the Confederates was threatened with defeat. To save the day he advanced the head of his column to a position within twenty yards of the enemy, and for an hour and a half his solitary regiment sustained the shock of the entire Federal attack. He went into the battle with 520 men, as the official report shows, lost in killed and wounded eighty-three, and by a remarkable skill in maneuvering and in deflective strategy fought and held his position until almost surrounded, and then under heavy fire made good his withdrawal, his individual command alone standing between an overwhelming defeat of the entire left wing of the Confederate army. Then followed the siege of Vicksburg, during which the Sixth Regiment of Missouri Infantry with its commander, Colonel Erwin, was assigned to emergency duty within the city, re-enforcing points against which the heaviest attack of the enemy was delivered. The climax of Colonel Erwin's career as a soldier came on the afternoon of the 25th of June, 1863. Ordered with his regiment to support some hard pressed Louisianans, who were defending a portion of the fortifications where the Federals had exploded a mine and were crowding through the shattered parapet, Colonel Erwin, shouting \"Follow me, boys\" rushed forward to lead the charge. Three musket balls passed through his body. At his fall his men with a hoarse, hungry roar of rage sprang out among the enemy. Then and there occurred the bloodiest fight of that memorable siege. When the paroled army passed out of surrendered Vicksburg only twenty-five of the Sixth Missouri were able to pass out with it. The brigadier-general's commission sent to Richmond to Colonel Erwin arrived too late--it had been canceled by death. Thereafter the Sixth Missouri as an individual unit lost its identity. Colonel Erwin was not only the idol of his own men, but his exploits commanded the admiration of his enemies. After he was wounded at Corinth special permission was granted Mrs. Erwin to come South through the lines, and after the surrender of Vicksburg General Grant furnished her with a pass and transportation to return to her home.\n\nHis obituary from The Daily Citizen, Vickburg, Mississippi issue of June 30, 1863 follows: OBITUARY COL. EUGENE ERWIN. Another brave and noble spirit has fallen. On Thursday evening, June 24th, Col. Eugene Erwin of the 6th Regiment Missouri Vols. was killed while mounted upon the works with a view to leading a charge against the enemy. He was struck with a minnie ball which passed through his body, killing him instantly. For several weeks previous to his death his health had been delicate, and at times compelled his absence from the field. During the siege of this place, he had more than once been driven to his bed, and on the day of his death he was out contrary to the advice and urgency of his friends, feeling, as he said, that it was his duty, so long as he could stand, to stand at his post. No one felt more than he did the importance of every man's discharging his duty - no one did more to discharge it. Col. Erwin, at the first outbreak of the war, left his home and family and offered himself a willing sacrifice upon the altar of his country's liberty. He has borne deprivation and hardships of [the duty?]. Throughout the campaigns of Gen. Price in Missouri, Arkansas and Mississippi, and this without a murmur, he has ever shown himself an excellent soldier and a gallant officer. More than a half dozen battlefields - Elk Horn, Corinth and Port Gibson included - hear testimony to his coolness and daring bravery. He was strict in discipline, yet generous, kind and true, possessing the confidence and esteem of all his men and officers. He esteemed religion highly, and did all in his power to promote its interests. Those who knew him best loved him most; for the more intimate the acquaintances, the brighter shown the excellence of his character. But he has fallen - fallen at his post defending the cause of justice and truth. At midnight's hour amid the roar of cannon and the whistling of enemy's balls, we bore him gently and laid him in the soldier's humble grave, where he shall rest in peace till he is called forth to his reward in the resurrection morn.\n\nHe by his example speaks --\n\n\"'Twere sweet to live, yet I can die, And in the grave forgotten lie, To know I have my duty done, And nobly life's last triumph won. Know ye my comrades in the field, I die a freeman's death; Cease not to wield the battleshield With life's last lingering breath - The banner which we bore on high, Still bid it all their hosts defy - For where the war tide wild shall wave, So fit to be a soldier's grave.\"\n\nHe leaves a wife and three sweet little girls to mourn his loss. May our Heavenly Father sustain and comfort them in their bed of bereavement and grant them all a happy reunion in .... [remainder unintelligible].\n\nShe married John Morrison Clay in Fayette Co., KY, July 7, 1866. John was born in Fayette Co., KY February 21, 1821. John was the son of Henry Clay and Lucretia Hart.

At 21 years of age Josephine became the mother of Nettie Russell Erwin 1857. At 25 years of age Josephine became the mother of Mary Webster Erwin in Jackson Cnty, Mo, February 5, 1861.

Simpson, 13, born in Kentucky. Her obituary from the Lexington Herald, March 30, 1920: Mrs. John Morrison Clay died Monday morning at her home, Ashland-on-the Tates Creek Pike. She was 85 years old and had been ill all winter, but not in a serious condition until with the last few weeks. Mrs. Clay was the widow of John Morrison Clay, the youngest son of Kentucky's famous statesman, Henry Clay. She was Miss Josephine D. Russell, the daughter of Col. and Mrs. William H. Russell, and was born in Fulton, Missouri. Her father was a well known man in public life, a jurist and statesman and the devoted friend of Henry Clay. She was twice married, her first husband having been Col. Eugene Erwin, the grandson of Henry Clay, who was killed at the Battle of Vicksburg, and Mrs. Clay's two daughters surviving her are the children of that marriage, Mrs. Minor Simpson, of Ashland-on-the Tates Creek Pike, and Mrs. M. W. Anderson of Kansas City who came several days ago called by her mother's illness. She leaves also five grandchildren, Eugene Erwin Simpson, Miss Josephine Simpson, Henry Clay Simpson, Henry Clay Anderson, and Matthew William Anderson. The funeral of Mrs. Clay will be held Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock at Christ Church Cathedral and the burial will be in the family lot at the Lexington Cemetery. In the passing of Mrs. Clay, Lexington loses perhaps the most remarkable woman of her generation, a writer of prose and poetry, a successful business woman, fearless and intrepid in spirit, brilliant in mind and admired for beauty, wit and all the womanly graces as well. She was engaged in activities which won for her a national fame, having been the world's most noted and successful woman owner and breeder of fine thoroughbred horses. At the death of her husband, Mr. John Morrison Clay, August 10, 1887, she succeeded to his business of rearing and racing thoroughbreds and under the Ashland colors, yellow and blue, won several of the classics of the turf. From an illustrated article which appeared in one of the magazines several years ago called \"The World's Most Noted Woman\" the following is quoted: \"With scarcely half a dozen brood mares in her possession, Mrs. John M. Clay, proprietor of the famous Ashland Stud in Kentucky, has had more great horses than a number of the famous stock farms in which thousands of dollars are invested.\" Mrs. Clay strolls among her mares and horses at will. They all seem to know her and have learned to appreciate the tender care with which she guards them. Of all persons interested in breeding and rearing the thoroughbred horse in America there are none as picturesque as this Kentucky authoress who, in spite of this and other business cares, finds time to give the public popular stories, her latest novel, \"Uncle Phil,\" being now in its second edition. The life of Mrs. Clay was closely interwoven with the Henry Clay family as her first husband, Col. Erwin, whom she met while on a trip to California, was the son of Henry Clay's fifth child, Anne Clay, his father being James Erwin of New Orleans. Being brilliant and accomplished her father took special pride in her and she was said to be more like him in intellect than any of his eleven children. Col. Erwin was an officer of the Sixth Regiment of Missouri Volunteers and was killed while leading a charge against the enemy at the battle of Vicksburg. He had been a leader on half a dozen battlefields where he was noted for his coolness, daring and bravery. After his death Mrs. Erwin and her children came to live at the home which was part of the original tract of land settled by Henry Clay more than 100 years ago and several years later was married to Mr. John Morrison Clay, the youngest son of the Sage of Ashland and the namesake of the founder of Morrison Chapel. Of the pioneer and aristocratic lineage on all sides it seemed the birthright of Mrs. Clay to perform unusual duties and to meet with success in her undertakings. While a girl she read the works of the world's greatest writers and with her observations on many trips with her father she was thus splendidly equipped. An article says of her that she first appeared in print against her will. She had been on a trip to Mexico and as they came through California she was asked to write of some of their experiences. She refused the requests, but her father required her to comply and after writing the article she added as a postscript, \"my father made me write this\". The editor was very much amused at this and when the article appeared it was widely read and copied in the other California papers. Mrs. Clay took great pride in her old home and its many valuable Clay relics. It was there that the wife of Henry Clay, Lucretia Hart, died. Among the most noted of the writings of Mrs. Clay were: \"John Logan\" dedicated to Henry Clay; \"Some Little of the Angel Still Left,\" \"Uncle Phil\" and her last work, \"The Sport of Kings,\" a group of racing stories. A patriot, a suffragist, a musician and a scientific gardener were some of the other qualifications of this wonderful Kentucky woman. During the Civil war she devoted a great deal of time to work for the soldiers and when the United States went to war with Germany she recalled her accomplishment of knitting and made more than 100 pairs of socks. She had not finished her self-imposed quota when the armistice was signed and she sent many of the pairs to Belgium to be presented to the common soldiers of that country who had won her admiration. She said that in all her life nothing had given her more pleasure than this knitting she had done for the soldiers. At a meeting of the International Conference of Women, held at Toronto, Canada, a few years ago. Mrs. Clay was asked to make all address. She could not be present but wrote the address and sent it to be read at the conference. Her subject was \"Women and the Professions.\" After expressing her opinion that women could succeed in all the professions, Mrs. Clay tells in the address of her experience as a horse breeder. She says that she sold one yearling for $8,200, which won three of the Kentucky Derby honors and the rich Realization stake at $41,000. The address was printed in the Kansas City Star and in several other newspapers. Private funeral services will be held for Mrs. Clay at Christ Church Cathedral Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the Very Rev. Robert K. Massie, dean of the Cathedral, officiating. The pallbearers will be Dr. Thomas Bullock, Thomas H. Shelby, W. K. Berry, James A. Todd, Colonel C. D. Clay, Captain T. J. Clay, Prof. Walter Patterson, Louis des Cognets.
