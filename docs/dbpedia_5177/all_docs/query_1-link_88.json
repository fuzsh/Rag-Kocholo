        "text": "Link to Kim McClatchie user page\n\nKim McClatchie\n\nHead of HR\n\nIn the year 2021, Kamala Harris marked history when she was sworn in as the 49th US vice president, becoming the first woman, and the first African American, to occupy the prestigious role. However, female leadership in world power is still a relatively modern phenomenon.\n\nThis research will reveal the countries that have the highest percentage of female representation across business and government policy. We will analyse the number of women in leadership positions across a variety of industries and establishments; from politicians to CEOs and female-ran companies, to women in top managerial positions. By breaking down our findings, we will reveal which locations have the highest concentration of female leaders.\n\nIf you are a woman looking to work abroad and find new opportunities, it is important to consider reliable expat health insurance, to ensure you are covered should you face an accident or are injured.\n\nWhich country has the most female leaders in the world?\n\nBy analysing gender equality data on the most developed countries in the world, we were able to rank the countries with the most female leaders.\n\nWe looked at a number of factors, although data was unavailable for some countries. The countries that did not have more than half of the data points available were subsequently removed from the list.\n\nData from the Global Gender Gap report looked at the number of female members of parliament chambers. Many countries use a bicameral political system, meaning that they have two chambers of parliament. They are comprised of a lower house where the government is formed, like the House of Commons, and an upper house that scrutinises and revises legislation, like the House of Lords.\n\nAttitudes towards women in local culture can be a major attraction or barrier to living and working abroad\n\nWhich are the most female-friendly countries in the world?\n\nThe most female leaders in the world\n\n1/ Austria\n\nScore: 8.08 out of 10\n\nAustria has elected and appointed three female government leaders, with one female Federal Chancellor, which is comparable to the role of Prime Minister, as well as two Presidents of the Austrian National Council. Brigitte Bierlein served as president of the Constitutional Court before serving as chancellor of Austria until January 2020. Bierlein was the first woman to hold either office.\n\nAustria’s share of board members of listed companies is 34.60% women. ‘Board members’ refers to all members of the highest decision-making body in the given company. There were also 40.40% of women in parliament seats in the lower or single house, with a higher percentage in upper chamber seats, with 41% of the Federal Council being women.\n\n2/ United Kingdom\n\nScore: 7.53 out of 10\n\nThe United Kingdom ranked in second place behind Austria, scoring 7.53 out of 10 for its female leaders. The UK has had three female prime ministers, including most recently politician Liz Truss, who stepped down from her role amid a government crisis, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in the history of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe UK has a higher percentage of women working in the lower house, the House of Commons, than in its upper chamber, the House of Lords (34.50%).\n\n3/ Argentina\n\nScore: 7.52 out of 10\n\nArgentina scored third place in the ranking with 7.52 out of 10. Argentina has one of the highest shares of female membership in its lower house of parliament, The Chamber of Deputies (44.80%). Argentina also has had two female presidents, most recently, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who served for a term of eight years until December 2015 when she was succeeded by Mauricio Macri.\n\nCountries with the most female leaders in the world\n\nRank\n\nCountry\n\nNumber of Female Heads of State & Government Leaders\n\nFemale Membership of Lower or Single House %\n\nFemale Membership of Upper Chamber %\n\nShare of Women’s Membership in Boards %\n\nFirms with Female Majority Ownership %\n\nFirms with Female Top Managers %\n\nScore\n\n1\n\nAustria\n\n3\n\n40.40%\n\n41.00%\n\n34.60%\n\n16.20%\n\nn/a\n\n8.08\n\n2\n\nUK\n\n3\n\n34.50%\n\n29.00%\n\n37.80%\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\n7.53\n\n3\n\nArgentina\n\n2\n\n44.80%\n\n31.00%\n\nn/a\n\n7.90%\n\n8.00%\n\n7.52\n\n4\n\nGermany\n\n2\n\n35.10%\n\n40.60%\n\n36.00%\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\n7.06\n\n5\n\nFrance\n\n2\n\n37.80%\n\n35.10%\n\n45.30%\n\n15.50%\n\nn/a\n\n7.05\n\n6\n\nBelgium\n\n1\n\n42.70%\n\n45.00%\n\n37.90%\n\n11.80%\n\n17.90%\n\n7\n\n7\n\nAustralia\n\n1\n\n38.40%\n\n56.60%\n\n34.80%\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\n6.8\n\n8\n\nNetherlands\n\n0\n\n40.70%\n\n32.00%\n\n38.10%\n\n5.00%\n\n13.70%\n\n6.31\n\n9\n\nCanada\n\n1\n\n30.70%\n\n51.60%\n\n32.90%\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\n6.23\n\n10\n\nIceland\n\n3\n\n47.60%\n\n0.00%\n\n47.10%\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\n6.19\n\nShow MoreShow Less\n\nAre you looking to move your life overseas?\n\nWe look at the happiest countries to live and work\n\nCountries with the most female elected leaders in the world\n\nNumber of female heads of state & government leaders\n\nFinland has 4 female elected leaders\n\nFinland has appointed or elected the most female heads of state and government in the world, having had three female prime ministers and one female president.

Any countries that did not have more than half of the data factors available were removed. Ukraine and Russia were removed from the seed list due to ongoing conflict.\n\nThe Number of Female Heads of State & Government was taken from Wikipedia. This data is correct as of 28/04/23.\n\nThe Percentage of Women in Parliament in both the upper chamber and lower or single house was taken from IPU Parline’s Monthly ranking of women in national parliaments for the month of February 2023.\n\nThe Share of Women’s Membership in Boards was taken from the Global Gender Gap Report 2022. This data was only available for OECD member countries. The percentage of Firms with Female Majority Ownership and Firms with Female Top Managers for every country was also taken from this report.\n\nAll the countries were ranked by their score for every factor to get a normalised score out of ten."
