Troubled with quincy recently, Mrs. Baird thought to avoid a recurrence and to that end determined to have her tonsils removed. Kissing her children goodbye at 8 oâclock, she smilingly entered an automobile accompanied by her husband and _____ in what was to prove a ride to her death, for two hours later she was a corpse, sleeping away while under the anaesthia , her heart failing before the operation could proceed. The pathetic death, moved the doctors and nurses to tears and relatives and friends upon learning of it were shocked beyond measure.\n\nMrs. La Rux Hildinger Baird was born in Du Bois, Pa., April 11, 1886. She was one of two children of John J. and Jennie Hildinger. Her mother dying when she was yet a small girl. Her father John J.

On the 5th day of June 1907 she was united in marriage to Thomas Baird as a result of their school day courtship. To them were born two children both of whom survive, Thomas Douglas, age six, and John J., age five. About four years ago they moved from McKeesport to this city and have since lived in their own home at 1923 Grandview avenue. She is also survived by her sister, Miss Virginia Hildinger who since the death of her father and since this last July has been making her home here. Virginia is now the only surviving member of that once happy family. The deceased was a member of Manly M. E. church of this city.

He died Tuesday evening at 7:20 oâclock at his home, Summitt and Twenty-first streets. At the time of his death he was in his eighty-fifth year. Mr. Micklethwait was born in the old brick house which formerly stood on the northwest corner of Grandview and Twenty-first streets, and his long and useful life was so ordered that it was lived on the same plot of ground upon which he was born. He was a grandson of Martin Funk, one of the first of the pioneer settlers of Scioto county and a large land owner along with what is now know as Lawsonâs Run. He was the last surviving child of Joseph and Barbara Micklethwait, three brothers John, Martin, and Richard, and a sister, Elizabeth all having died before him. His father died in 1850 and his mother in 1888.\n\nIn his youth he attended the old red school house so famous in its day, which stood near where the Terminals are now. This was the best of the local schools of its time. In the late sixties he engaged in the gardening business with his brother Richard. He continued in this until 1880, when, because of increased production and the shipment of southern vegetables to this market, he turned to dairying and was engaged in the dairy business from 1900 to 1907. He then sold his business and leased his farm to the Pure Milk Company, which continued to operate the dairy until the Micklethwait farm was subdivided into building lots. In, 1873, Mr. Micklethwait was married to Miss Abigail Dever in the old Dever homestead in Madison Township, near the Jackson county line. He was the father of three sons, Doctors William D. and Oscar R. Micklethwait and Attorney Joseph T. Micklethwait and one daughter Mrs. Leon G. Marshall, with whom he resided at the time of his death. Mrs. Abigail Mickelthwait, for so many years his faithful wife, also survives him. On January 6, 1923 they had the happiness of celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary.\n\nMr. Micklethwait was a lifelong member of the Methodist Episcopal church, having in turn been a faithful and prominent member of Spencer Chapel, Sixth Street, and Trinity churches. He was a lifelong and consistent Republican, having pride in that his first vote for president was cast for Abraham Lincoln in 1864. He never sought office, refusing all appeals to enlist in political candidacies, but served many years as a member of the Board of Education and as treasurer of Clay township. Mr. Micklethwait was a firm believer in the future of Portsmouth, and lived to see the small town of 1843, then all west of Chillicothe street, grow up till it embraced and surrounded all his land in the eastern part of the city. He lived as well to see it reach the fifty thousand population which he so firmly believed was to come. He aided materially in this growth and advancement in many ways. He loved his work of gardening and dairying and had the attachment for the soil which only those can feel who have spent their entire lives upon it. The funeral services will be held at the home Friday afternoon at two oâclock, the Rev. Arthur Staples of Trinity M.E. church officiating. Interment will be in the new mausoleum in Greenlawn cemetery.\n\n[The Portsmouth Times, Wednesday, 30 May 1928 - Sub. by Teresa Wilson Rogers]\n\nClarence E.
