        "text": "It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of Mr William Russell Enoch, known to us all as Russell, who passed away on 3rd June 2024, aged 99 years, in the comfort of his own home.\n\nA loving family man and respected actor, he will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved him.\n\nWe would be honoured if you could join us in celebrating his life on July 3rd, and you are most welcome at both the church and crematorium services, as well as at the reception where a buffet and drinks will be served.\n\nWe would respectfully ask that you are at the church by 12:15pm as Russell will be received at 12:30pm.\n\nParking is extremely limited in the local area, so please do plan ahead accordingly, and also consider transit between the church and the crematorium.\n\nAs Russell loved colour in all aspects of his life, dress does not need to be black, so please do feel free to come as you wish.\n\nDonations, in memory of Russell, may be made in lieu of flowers to Turvey Monastry (Monastery & Turvey Centre) at 68198140, 60-16-45, or BIC: NWBK GB 2L, or IBAN: GB89 NWBK 6016 4568 1981 40.\n\nThe Monastery of Christ our Saviour at Turvey is a Benedictine monastery which provides hospitality and welcome for those seeking peace, and for those in need. It is a contemplative community deeply engaged in ecumenical and interfaith dialogue, with a longstanding relationship with psychotherapy, to which we now wish to offer our assistance in return.\n\nThank you for your kind words and help at this sad time, and we very much look forward to welcoming you on July 3rd to celebrate Russell's life."
