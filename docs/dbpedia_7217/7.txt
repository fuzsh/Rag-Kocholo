The 3 Best Tropical and Beach Honeymoon Destinations in the U.S.

If youâre searching for the best place for a honeymoon in the U.S., that destination may include a beach, swaying palm trees, crashing ocean waves, or all of the above. Here are the most popular honeymoon destinations in the U.S. for a beachy, tropical escape.

1. Maui, Hawaii

Editorâs Note:Due to the August 2023 fires in Maui, please be thoughtful about traveling to certain areas of the island at this time. According to the Hawaiian Tourism Authority, HawaiÊ»iâs Governor Josh Green has said, âNo one can travel to West Maui right now. We will share when that is possible again. Only returning residents and authorized emergency relief workers should come here now. But all of the other areas of Mauiâ¦ and the rest of HawaiÊ»i are safe. When you come, you will support our local economy and help speed the recovery of the people that are suffering right now.â

Couples who want an exotic escape to paradise with lots to do and see should head to Maui. Itâs ideal for travelers with various interests â such as dining out, lounging on one of the best beaches in Maui, snorkeling, or hiking. Another perk is that Mauiâs weather is fairly consistent year-round, so honeymooners can usually expect a warm, sunshine-filled honeymoon regardless of the season. Parts of the island stay dry even during the rainier months.

Maui has all of the typical island favorite tourist activities, like winding along the harrowing Road to Hana, hopping on a whale-watching cruise, or hiking the craters at HaleakalÄ National Park. For a little extra romance, make sure to add stargazing at night at the HaleakalÄ National Park and visit the golden sands of Paâako Cove (known as Secret Beach) to your Maui honeymoon itinerary.

And while thereâs plenty of fine dining on the island, Mauiâs food trunks offer affordable delights, including poke, seared ahi, traditional Kiawe BBQ, and even pizza, coffee, and burgers for those in the market for a taste of home. And, of course, exploring the islandâs cultural traditions, like heading to a luau, learning to hula or play the ukulele, or taking a lei-making workshop, are must-dos.

Those searching for an adults-only oasis should head to the Hotel Wailea, one of the islandâs most famous hotels, set upon 15 acres of lush Hawaiian foliage on a hilltop overlooking the ocean. The hotel offers the best indoor-outdoor living, with an open-air fitness center, alfresco dining options, an outdoor cocktail lounge, and suites with balconies.

For those that prefer a truly intimate escape without distractions, the Hana-Maui Resort, a Destination by Hyatt property, has standalone villas sans clocks, TVs, or radios, so you can focus on bonding with your significant other. The seafront properties come in various sizes and types to customize your stay, offering things like Jacuzzis and kitchens. The propertyâs spa features 9 treatment rooms, a eucalyptus steam room, a cold plunge pool, and outdoor showers.

2. Kauai, HawaiiÂ

Couples planning a honeymoon to Hawaii have numerous choices of where to go, but Kauaiâs dramatic scenery and intimate resorts are ideal for honeymooners who want to spend their getaway exploring dazzling natural wonders in a less commercialized setting.

Kauaiâs landscape is wild and pristine, and the best way to see it is from above. Honeymooners should definitely splurge on a honeymoon tour of the island, flying over the Na Pali Coast, Hanalei Valley, and Waimea Canyon. Expect to see some serious âJurassic Parkâ-style scenery, complete with thundering waterfalls, steep cliffs, verdant rainforest, volcanic craters, and of course, incredible vistas of the sapphire sea.

When it comes to hiking, trails in KÅkeÊ»e State Park offer stunning views of the Na Pali Coast, Waipoâo Falls Trail guides you through Waimea Canyon, and Kalepa Ridge TrailÂ is ultra-steep and best for experienced hikers. Known as the Garden Isle, Kauaiâs lush landscape comes at a price: more rain. If youâd prefer near-guaranteed sunshine, it may be best to opt for Maui instead.

Where To Stay in Kauai for a Honeymoon

The best Hawaiian island for a honeymoon is a tough decision, but when you see the OâLuina, that may give you the answer. The eco-luxe hideaway is one of the most romantic hotels in the U.S., a traditional Hawaiian longhouse that gives visitors a true taste of Hawaiian hospitality and intimacy. Lounge with your honey in the hammock or bask in the infinity pool, which sits on 11 acres of rural hillside 1,000 feet above Kalaheo.

Or, consider a stay at the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa. Although the property offers a lot of amenities geared towards children and families, honeymooners will still love relaxing on the blissful white sands of Poipu Beach, getting pampered at the Anara Spa, or golfing at the 18-hole Poipu Bay Golf Course.

3. Key West, Florida

One of the best beach honeymoon destinations in the U.S. and the best honeymoon destination in Florida, honeymooning in Key West is an easy way to feel like youâre miles away from home without going that far. The destinationâs motto, âOne Human Family,â points towards the spotâs inclusivity to all types of visitors, regardless of race, nationality, or sexuality â all honeymooners are welcome in Key West.

You can start enjoying the pristine landscape on the drive over, traversing an ocean-lined highway past various Keys, admiring crystal-sand beaches and swaying palm trees, building a sense of true escape before even arriving at Key West.

Enjoy the islandâs colorful architecture, besides the usual swimming, fishing, snorkeling, scuba diving, kayaking, lounging on the beach, and drinking tropical cocktails with your loved one. Conservation is also big in the Keys, so plan to visit the Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservatory. Nearby, visit other Keys to explore beautiful beaches and check out the Dolphin Research Center and the Turtle Hospital.

However, honeymooners may want to skip a honeymoon in Key West from August to October when humid, rainy weather (and the possibility of hurricanes) could put a damper on vacation fun.

Where To Stay in Key West for a Honeymoon

For an adults-only Key West honeymoon experience, H20 Suites offer amenities including private plunge pools and balconies. Honeymooners should book the romance packages, which include extras such as Champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries.

For intimate oceanfront luxury and a private island honeymoon, consider Sunset Key Cottages, set on its own 27-acre island just off Key West. Here, you can relax in your very own beachfront cottage, which may include amenities like a kitchen, a wraparound veranda, and a private plunge pool.

The 3 Best Mountain Honeymoon Destinations

Some of the best hiking honeymoon destinations in the U.S. are mountain honeymoon destinations. After all, what better way to get away from it all with your new partner than by getting out into nature and exploring the great outdoors? Mountains also make for some of the best adventure honeymoon destinations in the U.S., so if youâre hoping to get the adrenaline pumping with your new partner, hereâs where you should go.

1. Sedona, Arizona

Outdoorsy honeymooners should head straight for Sedona, where the dramatic red rocks and sandstone formations are stunning and rumored to have mystical powers â not a bad way to start a lifelong partnership together.

Besides hiking, other outdoor adventures include 4Ã4 or Jeep tours, hot air balloon trips, horseback riding, rock climbing, cycling, and beyond. But you can also enjoy the peaceful spas or visit the regionâs art galleries and wineries. Some of the most popular outdoor attractions include Cathedral Rock and its famous reflection pools, the emblematic Bell Rock, and Slide Rock, a natural waterslide best visited in the summer months.

If you want to enjoy Sedonaâs attractions to the max, itâs best to visit in summer, spring, and fall, as it can get cold in the winter months. The destination may also be best for shorter honeymoons, as you can see most of what the city and its magical surroundings offer in a long weekend or a week.

Where To Stay in Sedona for a Honeymoon

LâAuberge de Sedona offers cottages, suites, and guestrooms amid the picturesque red rocks and flowing creeks. You and your partner will be immersed in the sounds and sights of nature while still enjoying all the luxuries of a fancy hotel. Honeymooners should opt for the Spa Cottages, which come equipped with gas fireplaces, private outdoor showers, and jetted tubs.

Those with Hilton points should opt for the Hilton Sedona Bell Rock, where dramatic reddish sandstone formations seem to rise around the property from all angles. All guestrooms come with private balconies or patios and fireplaces, and honeymooners can participate in activities such as sunrise yoga or stargazing.

Hot Tip:

If youâre looking to rack up those Hilton Honors points, you have options. Amex is one of the best transfer partners for Hilton, so you could get a card like The Platinum CardÂ® from American Express and then transfer your Amex Membership Rewards points to Hilton at a 1:2 ratio (or more if thereâs a bonus).

2. Big Sur, California

Combine mountains and sea with romance during a honeymoon in Big Sur, California. A destination known for its natural beauty, honeymooners can frolic on hidden beaches, hike up cliffs for incredible seafront vistas, and get lost amid towering redwoods.

Start with a drive along the Big Sur Highway to enjoy winding through all the aforementioned landscapes and get a feel for this beautiful destination. This may just be the most scenic road trip in the U.S., so itâs one of the best honeymoon destinations to hit the road.

The fall can be one of the best times a year to go to Big Sur, as the summer tourist rush is over, but you should still have decent weather. Plus, you may be able to enjoy the perks of harvest season, as there are many farms and vineyards in the area perfect for quaint activities like apple picking, romantic picnics, or wine tasting.

Hikers have varied options, but some of the most popular trails include trekking through Point Lobos State Natural Reserve and Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, enjoying the Sykes Hot Springs via the Pine Ridge Trail, and walking through Los Padres National Forest.

Where To Stay in Big Sur for a Honeymoon

World of Hyatt fans know that one of the most coveted Hyatt properties in the U.S. is the Alila Ventana Big Sur, which aims to connect guests with the natural beauty of the surroundings. The hotel offers plenty of activities to honeymooners â think classic car rental, meditation, private hikes, bike tours, and even foraging experiences. Guests will also love rejuvenating in the hotelâs guestrooms and suites, decked out in natural elements like wood and featuring balconies with beautiful views.

Post Ranch Inn is another iconic property in the area, perched atop a hill overlooking the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean. Honeymooners should book the Romance at the Ranch package, which includes a 3-night stay, 2 dinners, a private couplesâ wellness experience such as a guided nature walk or forest meditation, Champagne, and more.

3. Alaska

One of the most unique honeymoon destinations in the U.S., Alaska is unlike any other spot in the world. Its impressive landscapes make for a one-of-a-kind, unforgettable adventure. Couples who want to add a cruise or prefer an all-inclusive honeymoon resort in the U.S. can make that happen by choosing Alaska.

The hardest decision to make when planning an Alaska honeymoon will be exactly where to go. Here are some of the top spots:

Aleutian Islands: These remote islands are difficult to reach and off-the-beaten-path, ideal for adventurous honeymooners.

Anchorage: This city is an excellent base for exploring the nearby Chugach State Park, Eklutna Historical Park, and the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center.

Denali National Park: This reserve is larger than some U.S. states and home to Mount McKinley, North Americaâs tallest peak.

Fairbanks: Just as beautiful in the winter to see the northern lights, visitors can enjoy the midnight sun in the summer.

Juneau: From glaciers to fjords to waterfalls, get into nature to see incredible wonders from this Alaskan destination.

The Wilderness. Honeymooners looking for privacy can rent cabins and lodges in Alaskaâs expansive natural settings, with access to hiking and spotting wildlife up close and personal.

Because itâs far-flung and can be expensive to get to, we recommend Alaska for honeymoons at least a week long. When it comes to timing, you can visit at any time of year, but for different reasons. Those who love snow, skiing, or want to see the northern lights should visit in winter. If youâd rather hike and enjoy the midnight sun, visit in the summer months.

Where To Stay in Alaska for a Honeymoon

Those in the market for an all-inclusive mountain honeymoon package in the U.S. will find some options in Alaska. Stillpoint Lodge builds many packages for honeymooners, including activities like wildlife cruises, guided hikes, bear viewing, glacier visits, meals, adventure gear, and more. Soaring Eagle Lodge has a special honeymooner 7-day package, including oceanfront lodging and several activities optimal for couples, like sled dog rides and kayaking.

Meanwhile, Alyeska Resort is a chateau-style lodge where visitors can ski in the winter and hike or relax in the summer, complete with a stunning, Nordic-inspired spa.

Hot Tip:

Flights to Alaska arenât always cheap. Consider flying there by redeeming Alaska Mileage Plan miles.

The 3 Best Urban Honeymoon Destinations

Honeymooners looking for an activity-filled honeymoon who want to explore, do, see, and learn should consider a large city. Cities have much to offer in the way of cultural and culinary delights, as well as plenty of landmarks to see and activities to do, so honeymooners will never get bored. For a fun honeymoon, head to one of these top U.S. cities.

1. New York, New York

The Big Apple is a destination perfect for honeymooning foodies, cultural enthusiasts, or couples who canât sit still. With plenty to see and do, the city that never sleeps offers so much to honeymooners, from luxury hotels to world-renowned museums, cuisine of all kinds, shopping, and all sorts of urban adventures.

New York City experiences all 4 seasons, so think carefully about what you want to do and see before deciding when to go.

There are plenty of traditional tourist experiences perfect for honeymooners â think walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, heading up to the top of the Rock or the Empire State Building, wandering Central Park, sharing snacks on the steps of the Met, and cozying up during a Broadway show.

But there are also plenty of more off-the-beaten-path activities to consider, like exploring local neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens, taking a foodie tour of Chinatown, or visiting underrated museums and parks, such as the Lower East Side Tenement Museum or Prospect Park.

The Big Apple can be busy and fast-paced, so itâs best to visit with an idea of what you want to do and see so you donât get overwhelmed. It may also be good to source some dinner reservations before visiting if you plan to eat at popular spots.

Where To Stay in New York City for a Honeymoon

There are endless options for couples that want any kind of New York City accommodation experience, from intimate boutique spots to luxury, dazzling properties right in the heart of all the action. But honeymooners will love The Beekman, A Thompson Hotelâs old-world charm and one-of-a-kind atrium. The hotel is part of the Hyatt portfolio, so you can use World of Hyatt points to stay.

Other iconic honeymoon hotels in New York City include the storied Plaza Hotel, which occupies a prestigious location on 5th Avenue, and the Greenwich Hotel, a charming boutique hotel in Greenwich Village, home to fireplace suites and Savior beds. For the ultimate splurge, consider Conrad New York Midtownâs sexy Atrium Suite, a 1,200-square-foot space home to a stunning glass atrium offering panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline.

2. Las Vegas, Nevada

Despite Las Vegasâ party animal reputation, a Sin City honeymoon can be decidedly romantic. Or affordable. Or full of wild debauchery. The thing about Las Vegas is that the city can be anything you want. Thatâs why itâs such an easy honeymoon choice, especially if youâre eloping â Elvis is a great wedding officiant.

Itâs also an easy choice for honeymooners who donât have much time. Itâs easy to get to and perfect for a long weekend if thatâs all you can dedicate. Likewise, you can stay longer, as other activities exist in the surrounding area.

Besides the obvious, which is exploring the Strip and its casinos, restaurants, nightclubs, and emblematic hotels, honeymooners can also enjoy several outdoor activities. Ideal day trips include the Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon, the Grand Canyon, Valley of Fire, Lake Mead, and Zion National Park. From helicopter tours to hikes to kayaking, these nearby destinations offer honeymooners an opportunity to escape the glitz and glamour of Vegas for more natural delights.

Back in Vegas, couples should head to the Stratosphere, an observation tower offering memorable views of the cityâs lights, see a concert or show like Cirque du Soleil, and make sure to pay a visit to a relaxing day spa for some relaxing couplesâ treatments.

Meanwhile, hotels like the Bellagio, the Cosmopolitan, and the Four Seasons Las Vegas have some pretty iconic suite options if youâre in the market for a fancier honeymoon. And donât forget, if you had your heart set on a honeymoon in Venice, Italy, but ended up in Las Vegas, you can always stay (or just visit) the Venetian to take a romantic gondola ride down its canals.

3. New Orleans, Louisiana

New Orleans has it all â the cultural and gastronomic offerings of a large city and the charm and bliss of a historic landmark town. Honeymooners of all kinds can enjoy this southern hub, whether youâre in the market for a relaxing getaway or an activity-filled vacation.

New Orleans summers are very hot and humid, and unless youâre a partying couple, it may be best to avoid Mardi Gras dates.

Jazz lovers will fall in love with the city, where musical parades march the French Quarter daily, and well-known and underground music clubs abound. Walking around the city feels romantic in itself. Enjoy a stroll through the French Quarterâs stunning French Creole and Spanish architecture, a walk past the mansions lining the Garden District, or admire Lake Pontchartrain at sunset.

Dig deeper with a voodoo or ghost tour of NOLA â these haunted and mystical traditions are part of the cityâs history and cultural framework. And, of course, plan to eat your way through this southern culinary destination. Indulge in its famous sandwiches like poâ boys and piled-high muffulettas, followed by gumbo and red beans and rice. And, of course, every couple should start off the day at Cafe Du Monde for cafÃ© au lait and beignets, New Orleansâ most famous sugary treat.

Where To Stay in New Orleans for a Honeymoon

With so many options for romantic boutique hotels in New Orleans, itâs hard to pick just one. We canât stop thinking about the quaint Creole cottage guestrooms at the Dauphine Hotel. The 18th-century property features historic rooms with all our favorite things about Southern living â plantation shutters, intimate evening conversations on the porch, and cypress wood and brick architecture.

Those with Marriott Bonvoy points may prefer the Ritz-Carlton New Orleans, located in a 1908 Beaux-Arts building that was once Maison Blanche, a famed NOLA department store. The tree-covered courtyard is perfect for listening to jazz tunes while enjoying a romantic evening cocktail. It might be worth splurging on a suite with amenities like a 4-poster bed and New Orleans heritage artwork.

Hot Tip:

Looking to earn more Marriott Bonvoy points? Consider one of these Marriott Bonvoy co-branded credit cards. Marriott is also a transfer partner of both Amex and Chase, so if you have a card like the Amex Platinum card or the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®, you can transfer points to Marriott Bonvoy to boost your stash.

The 2 Best Private Honeymoon Destinations

A honeymoon is an intimate escape with the utmost privacy for some couples. If you really want to enjoy one anotherâs company on your honeymoon and are less concerned about activities and dining, here are some of the best private honeymoon destinations in the U.S. where you can hide away with your honey for some secluded, romantic time together.

1. Santa Fe, New Mexico

Couples who want a rejuvenating stay surrounded by beauty and tranquility should consider Santa Fe, New Mexicoâs capital and one of the Southwestâs most creative and artistic cultural hubs. Activities as simple as watching the sunrise or sunset together are truly magical in this city, where itâs all about serene delights and life in the slow lane.

Honeymooners can visit year-round, but deciding what kind of stay youâd like first is best. Are you looking for fireplaces and ski lifts or hikes and lazy pool days? Summer visitors can also enjoy private horseback rides, cycling tours, and hot air balloon experiences.

If you want to enjoy some privacy in the city, consider a visit to one of Santa Feâs top spas â our favorite is the spa at the Four Seasons Resort Rancho Encantado Santa Fe, which offers private hike-to-yoga, mediation wellness experiences, and smudging ceremonies.

For couples that want to get out of town, there are several historic pueblos outside of Santa Fe worth exploring, such as Picuris, which sits on the banks of the Rio Pueblo River, and the artist pueblo San Ildefonso.

Where To Stay in Santa Fe for a Honeymoon

Honeymooners who want a splurge should consider the luxury digs at the aforementioned Four Seasons Rancho Encantado Santa Fe, a 57-acre property. The standalone casitas nestled in the Sangre Cristo foothills feel delightfully removed from all the action â but downtown Santa Fe is just 10 minutes away.

Meanwhile, the Ojo Santa Fe Spa Resort is all about connecting with nature, with spring-fed thermal pools rumored to have healing waters and one of the worldâs most famous destination spas. We recommend staying in the casitas with fireplaces and personal courtyards. Itâs an optimal space to hide from the world and enjoy your new life partner.

2. Jackson Hole, Wyoming

Honeymooners looking for idyllic scenery, Western charm, and nature-inspired fun should head to Jackson Hole, a mountain honeymoon destination that inspires secluded romance and peace. Just as beautiful in winter as in summer, those visiting during the colder months can admire snow-capped peaks, dog sleds, skiing, snowmobiles, and snuggling up near the fireplace. Meanwhile, summer brings hiking, hot springs visits, whitewater rafting, cycling, and hot air balloon rides.

Jackson Hole is home to famous natural wonders, including Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park, so thereâs plenty to do and see if youâre outdoorsy. But those looking for a tranquil honeymoon may be just as happy enjoying a drink while overlooking the stunning mountainous landscape or taking morning walks together.

Where To Stay in Jackson Hole for a Honeymoon

Winter travelers looking for a fancier honeymoon experience will love a stay at the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole, a ski-in, ski-out resort that caters to honeymooners with couples activities and spa treatments.

Equally as luxurious is the Amangani, set amid the foothills of the Tetons. The suites are decked out in natural wood to blend in with the beauty of the surroundings, and all stays include wellness classes and access to hiking routes â with free snowshoes.

The 2 Best Romantic Honeymoon Destinations

A honeymoon is all about bonding with your new partner with no distractions. If you want a honeymoon swathed in intimacy and love, there are some of the most romantic honeymoon destinations in the U.S., perfect for your trip.

1. Savannah, Georgia

This historic city was made for couples who want to wander hand-in-hand along cobblestone streets, below towering oaks and weeping willows, and past majestic mansions and charming shopfronts. The city has many secret corners inspiring romance, like verdant gardens, riverfront paths, and stately squares.

Savannah is rumored to have many resident ghosts, so taking in a spooky ghost tour is an excellent way to explore the town as a couple. Another romantic way to enjoy the city is by riverboat cruise along the Savannah River.

A visit to the nearby Tybee Island is a must for honeymooners. The barrier island is home to an 18th-century lighthouse that still functions today. Couples can also pop into local art galleries or enjoy a relaxing afternoon on the beach.

Although there arenât many wineries close to Savannah, the city is home to several tasting rooms where couples can easily sip the night away together. Fan favorites include 208 Wine Bar, with over 60 wine options by the glass, Georgia Tasting Room, where you can sample locally-named private label wines like the Tybee Island Pinot and the Savannah Sauvignon Blanc, and Savannah Wine Cellar, which specializes in sustainable, organic, and low intervention wines.

Where To Stay in Savannah for a Honeymoon

It seems like nearly every boutique hotel in Savannah was made for honeymooners. With plenty of romantic boutique properties, couples are spoiled for choice, from Perry Lane Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Savannahâs inviting rooftop bar or in-room spa services to the historic B&B Kehoe House, lodged in a former mansion. This property customizes special package stays for honeymooners.

For those who want to be right on the water, the JW Marriott Savannah Plant Riverside District is located near shops, bars, and restaurants, ideal for couples who want to spend time shopping and dining in addition to exploring Savannahâs historic haunts. Thereâs also the newly opened Drayton Hotel Savannah, a Curio Collection by Hilton property, home to 50 rooms and suites and a rooftop bar.

2. Napa Valley, California

Oenophiles should choose Napa Valley for a romantic, wine-inspired honeymoon, especially if you canât swing a trip to the south of France or Italyâs Tuscan hills. Home to more than 400 wineries and plenty of restaurants, spas, and beautiful landscapes, thereâs plenty to do and see in this California region.

Although itâs a year-round destination, you may want to plan your visit between August and October during harvest season. However, budget honeymooners may want to consider a month like December, where you can still explore the area with decent weather but with fewer crowds and more affordable prices.

We recommend hiring transport for the day or taking a tour so you donât have to worry about indulging then driving. Besides wine tasting, honeymooners should ride romantic gondolas along the Napa River. Packages with Napa Valley Gondola allow couples to add wine tastings or winery visits to their gondola ride.

And some of the most romantic things to do in Napa Valley are decidedly low-brow and affordable. Enjoying a picnic with your loved one is a peaceful way to enjoy the surroundings, and hiking in nearby spots like Bothe-Napa Valley State Park or Robert Louis Stevenson State Park is a tranquil and rejuvenating experience.

Where To Stay in Napa Valley for a Honeymoon

Almost all of Napa Valleyâs hotels are geared towards adults and couples, so it wonât be hard to find romantic accommodation of any kind. Upgraded Points favorites include Indian Springs Calistoga, located on an inviting 17-acre property. The hotelâs historic cottages are focused on indoor-outdoor living, with stunning patios overlooking the propertyâs olive and palm trees and rose and herb gardens. Donât forget to pamper yourself in the thermal mineral springs and mud baths while there.

Those with World of Hyatt points to burn may prefer the Alila Napa Valley in St. Helena, an adults-only property with 68 luxury rooms and suites. The hotel overlooks a vineyard and has charming installations like fire pits and alfresco dining options perfect for quiet, romantic evenings.

Hot Tip:
