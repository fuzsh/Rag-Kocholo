        "text": "You may not have envisioned years ago having a honeymoon that included your own children, or that doing so and still having a romantic time together was even remotely possible.\n\nWhat you probably had in mind was spending days on end at a Caribbean all-inclusive resort with the love of your life, sinking blissfully into the reality of your new union. You two, as part of this romantic escape, would soak in the passion of the islands, fall deeper in love while sipping Pina Coladas on a dreamy white-sand beach… you know, the whole shebang.\n\nYour vision probably did not involve kids at that time, but today it might.\n\nThe good news? With Beaches all-inclusive resorts in the Caribbean offering families the ultimate familymoon — family honeymoons that include children — your romantic getaway can be more than just a dreamy fantasy, and still involve your children.\n\nThere’s no need to drop your kids off at grandma’s for the week, if you don’t want to. Celebrate your love with the family!\n\nWhat is a familymoon exactly?\n\nA familymoon is a honeymoon that includes your children. It might seem surprising to some that parents would even want kids around during such an intimate time, but familymoons are more popular than you might think.\n\nCouples who have kids prior to being married and in particular couples with younger kids, sometimes opt to take the children along on their honeymoon. Going on a familymoon has many pluses, including allowing your children to be part of the celebration.\n\nIn recent times, resorts seem to be catching up to the increasing popularity of familymoons, which means you’ll have lots of options to choose from when planning your own.\n\nInsider tip: A familymoon at Beaches Resorts includes things like gourmet dining at its best, unlimited free cocktails and house wines for adults, a waterpark and plenty of activities for the kids, as well as an arcade and games room. Want to spend the evening with just the two of you? Beaches Resorts’ certified nannies are ready when you need them!\n\nWhy go on a familymoon?\n\nWhile some newlyweds with kids struggle to make the decision on who will be taking care of the rugrats while on honeymoon, others are already packing their bags and getting set for an exciting familymoon with the children in an exotic destination not too far from the States.\n\nFor some newlywed couples it’s just much easier to take their kids on their honeymoon than to organise a care-taker. In addition, a familymoon allows the children to be a bigger part of the ‘getting married’ experience.\n\nFor blended families especially, these getaways can provide an opportunity for kids from either side to get to know each other a bit better in a peaceful, neutral and fun zone, which can help speed up the bonding process. Everyone involved gets to create memories as a new family together, while the newlyweds get to enjoy quality time as well.\n\nDid you know? The Turks & Caicos Islands are only a 1 hour and 45 minute flight from U.S. shores and are home to one of the most beautiful beach destinations in the world: Grace Bay beach. These are just two reasons to have a honeymoon in Turks & Caicos (with or without the rest of the family!).\n\nTips for going on your familymoon\n\nGet adjoining rooms\n\nLook for adjoining rooms (if the kids are old enough to stay in their own) or a family suite with separate bedrooms. This ensures you and your spouse will still have plenty of privacy despite taking the kids along for the ride.\n\nDon’t be afraid to be affectionate\n\nHolding hands, hugging, complimenting each other openly, saying ‘I love you…’, and otherwise expressing your love and appreciation for your spouse on your familymoon is perfectly alright.\n\nAs long as you both keep things G-rated, showing affection in front of the kids can actually be beneficial to their development, as it shows them what a healthy relationship should look like. Seeing you two being affectionate can also help kids feel safer, more secure and loved.\n\nShow lots of love to the whole family\n\nIn addition to you and your spouse being affectionate with each other, you’ll also need to make some time to show the kids some extra love as you all set off on a familymoon.\n\nThis is especially-so if two families are being combined — adults on either end will need to show equal parts of love to all kids in the new family dynamic. If you’re remarrying or getting married for the first time to someone with their own children, reassure your own kids that your love for them has not changed. All of the above can help make a familymoon more comfortable and memorable for everyone.\n\nHire a nanny to get some ‘alone time’\n\nGetting a nanny or babysitter is a great idea when going on a familymoon. This can help ensure the kids are well cared for while parents get out to have some fun, whether that involves a spa date, or a candlelight dinner on the beach.\n\nGo somewhere relaxing and safe\n\nFor a familymoon, set your sights on a family-friendly accommodation not too far from home, where kids will have more than enough activities to occupy their time. You’ll want to book a place where your children can roam around in a safe environment, so you don’t have to worry about their whereabouts all the time.\n\nTip: Beaches Resorts have tons of fun things for kids to do on the resort grounds, including age appropriate activities at Kids Camps, Sesame Street characters, splashing around at the Pirates Island Waterpark, and so much more. Even teens won’t get bored at Beaches Resorts, offering unlimited land and water sports, swim-up soda bars, and a night club experience catered just for them! The best part? It’s all included in the booking price.\n\nMake time for each other post honeymoon\n\nThere’s no doubt about it, traveling with your kids can be a fulfilling experience no matter the occasion - but also tiring. Once you’re done with your familymoon, you may want to spend some time alone with your spouse to celebrate your marriage in a quieter way. When you all are back home, you can get a friend or family member to watch the kids, while you two get away or spend a night or two alone as a couple.\n\nDoing this will allow you both to unwind from the vacation, and enjoy each other’s company.\n\nBest familymoon destinations near the U.S.\n\nWhen looking for the ideal familymoon destination, look in the direction of tropical islands that are family-friendly and not too far from home. Ensure there’ll be enough things both kids and adults can do to have a good time.\n\nFor blended families, a familymoon might be the first trip away together, so choose a destination that’ll be memorable. Some options include theme parks, big city getaways, and all-inclusive beach resort vacations. Your ideal choice of a place to go will combine elements of relaxation, fun, and adventure, mixed in with lots of romance for the happy couple!\n\nAlso read: Family vacation ideas to make memories that last a lifetime.\n\nBeaches Turks and Caicos\n\nView this family friendly all-inclusive resort in Turks & Caicos\n\nBeaches Turks & Caicos is a dream for families.
