        "text": "Sure, parents are exhausted 99.9% of the time, but at the same time they will do anything for their children even if it means sacrificing what should have been their honeymoon. Plus, after the year we’ve just had and holidaying being off the cards for many, this could be a fantastic opportunity to not only take your little family away from it all, but also to get your extended family to join you on a wonderful group familymoon! Plus, that way you can keep the celebrations going for longer!\n\nSo where do we recommend going if you are travelling with multiple generations? Take a look below!\n\nCouples travelling alone might be keen on jet setting to more unique honeymoon destinations full of cultural or historical tourist sites.\n\nFor instance, not all honeymoon destinations have to be hot places! You could go and visit Reykjavik and witness the magical Aurores Borealis (Northern Lights) together. Or why not head to New York in December where snow could blanket the iconic streets and make the trip even more romantic? Ice skating and going to see the Christmas Tree at the Rockefeller Center are musts for the NY holiday season.\n\nNot forgetting, of course, those idyllic places like Barbados, if a tropical destination is your dream holiday. Bridgetown, for example, offers you the opportunity to enjoy beautiful landscapes, drink rum and watch horses have an early morning paddle in the bay.\n\nWe recommend regularly checking government advice concerning travel to better understand any rules or regulations associated with your destination of choice."
