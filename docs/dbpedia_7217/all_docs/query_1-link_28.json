        "text": "Nick Viall and his new wife, Natalie Joy, were in honeymoon hell after their dream wedding.\n\nDuring Thursday’s episode of the “Viall Files” podcast, the “Bachelor” alum disclosed that their escape to Turks and Caicos was canceled when Joy was not allowed into the country.\n\n“We brought Natalie’s mom with us to babysit. As much as we spend all of our time with our daughter and we love every minute of it, we were hoping to connect and have some quality time,” the 43-year-old told listeners before revealing that they were held at the customs checkpoint.\n\n“The agent stamps the passport … [They are] about to hand it back, looks at it and goes, ‘There’s a page torn here.’ And we’re like, ‘Huh? I don’t know.’”\n\nAfter being taken into a separate room, the family of four was told that Joy, 25, would not be let into the country due to her passport.\n\nThe surgical technologist called the situation a turning point in their new union, telling listeners, “Not only did we have River in our arms and have to hold it together for our daughter — but also it really challenged us … It was the first thing we had to conquer as husband and wife.”\n\nViall further told fans he tried to remain calm as agents informed the couple that Joy would be sent back to the United States.\n\n“[The agent] looked at me and was like, ‘Are you still going to go to your hotel?’ I’m like, ‘I’m not leaving my wife. I’m telling myself, ‘You’re two days on the f—king job. Time to be a husband. It’s your time to step up and stay calm. Everything’s going to be fine,’” he said.\n\n“It was so chaotic, [but] I got so many opportunities to call Natalie my wife and that was great. I was like, ‘I’m not leaving my wife,’ ‘I got my wife here.’”\n\nDespite arranging to send the entire family back to the United States that same day, the couple was allowed to enjoy one day of their honeymoon after their flight back was canceled.\n\nFor more Page Six reality TV updates …\n\nListen to our “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“It could have been much worse [and] we had one night,” Viall said of the experience, recalling that the family of four enjoyed dinner at the hotel before leaving the following morning.\n\nJust two days before, the couple married during an “etheral [and] romantic” celebration at Joy’s parents’ home in Georgia.\n\nThey originally met when Joy messaged Viall on social media and went public with their relationship in 2021."
