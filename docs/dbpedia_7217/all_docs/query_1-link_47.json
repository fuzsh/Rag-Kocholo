        "text": "First comes love, then comes marriage, and then comes the honeymoon in Belize! After the whirlwind of your joyful wedding celebration, Belize is the perfect destination to reconnect and unwind. In Belize, things run at a blissfully relaxed pace. Newlyweds enjoying a honeymoon in Belize will find lush jungles, stunning Caribbean beaches, friendly and welcoming people, and opportunities to explore Belizean culture of the past and the present.\n\nWhy Choose Belize?\n\nCome to Belize to fall in love again—and not just with each other! This breathtaking destination offers the perfect environment for a honeymoon you’ll always remember. Located on the Caribbean coast of Central American, Belize is blessed with temperate, tropical weather, and cooling trade winds. The natural environment is preserved and protected here and has been since Belize became an independent nation in 1981. More than twenty-five percent of Belize’s lands and waters are held in more than ninety-five reserves and marine sanctuaries.You’re welcome to relax in the jaw-dropping beauty of the natural and cultural environment on your honeymoon in Belize.\n\nGetting to Belize is easy. Belize City is served by many major airlines, and flights from major U.S. cities to this Central American country arrive every day. Once you arrive, regional airlines fly to domestic destinations, including Punta Gorda.\n\nA majority of Belizeans speak English, so there’s no need to worry about understanding what you need to know in this friendly, welcoming country.\n\nBelize is a small country that offers the best of the pristine natural environment. Visit Belize to stay in a rustic jungle lodge, settled in the bend of a lazy river. Take advantage of miles of uncrowded Caribbean beaches. Snorkel or dive the second largest barrier reef in the world.\n\nHoneymoon at Cotton Tree Lodge\n\nCotton Tree Lodge is situated in Toledo, the southernmost district of Belize. Toledo is easy to reach via a connecting flight from Belize City, but miles away from the stress and hustle of daily life. Put everyday life on hold and discover the wonders of Cotton Tree Lodge. Toledo is one of the least developed areas in Belize and features an unspoiled rainforest and winding inland rivers—as well as uncrowded beaches and cays, or low sandy islands.\n\nHoneymoon packages at Cotton Tree Lodge include romantic accommodation in a honeymoon suite on the Moho River, farm-to-table dining (so fresh you can visit the on-site farm and meet the chef), local beer and wine, plus specialty rum drinks made with fresh-squeezed tropical juice. Take your pick of romantic and exciting excursions to keep you busy on the days you’re not enjoying a local rum punch on your river-view hammock.\n\nHoneymoon Cabana\n\nThe honeymoon cabana at Cotton Tree Lodge is constructed in a rustic jungle lodge, like all of our buildings, and designed to be cozy and comfortable. It features 400 square feet of private space, a private balcony overlooking the Moho River, including comfortable chairs and a hammock just perfect for lounging à deux. A king bed and hand-woven Mayan textiles lend an authentic touch to the beautiful space. Enjoy an evening under the stars and tree canopy from your balcony, listening to the sounds of the jungle. Not everyone will hear monkeys on their honeymoon, but you’re pretty likely to at Cotton Tree Lodge!\n\nAdventures for Two\n\nAll-inclusive honeymoon packages at Cotton Tree Lodge include your choice of daily adventures and excursions—in case you’re not the type of couple to sit back and relax all day. Maybe you’re looking for that perfect photo for the wedding album or to share with friends and family on social media. How about swimming beneath a waterfall or hiking through a cavern to a secret swimming hole? Memories are made of experiences like these!\n\nRomantic Escapes\n\nYour honeymoon in Belize is time for you to begin your married life and discover each other as newlyweds. Explore the natural and cultural wonders of this lush tropical paradise and make memories you’ll keep forever. Take a lot of pictures because you’ll want to remember this!\n\nVisit a local cacao farm to learn all about how organic chocolate is grown and made. Samples are included, of course. The Toledo district of Belize is famous for its chocolate, and you’ll see (and taste) why. Or, learn to make tortillas or traditional dishes in the homes of local people who will welcome you into their kitchens as guests of Cotton Tree Lodge and share stories and knowledge with you. Snorkel together at Snake Caye and encounter the riotous colors and wonders of a tropical coral reef. Explore a Mayan cultural site and then swim beneath a waterfall if that sounds like the perfect day to the two of you. Choose the excursion that suits you every day.\n\nIf you’re feeling a little quiet some days, after a massage, you barely have to leave your cabana to experience the unique wonders of Belize. Visit the on-site organic farm or go on an early morning bird-watching walk on lodge property. Learn survival skills in the nearby jungle, such as how to build shelter and what is edible in the wild. Or take an epic lazy evening cruise down the Moho River, enjoying a nightcap and listening to the sounds of the wilderness. You might love it so much, you’ll do it more than once.\n\nExcursions to Get Your Adrenaline Flowing\n\nSome couples aren’t having fun until their hearts are thumping and their adrenaline is high. Try swimming by headlamp through a cave system along an underground river. At the end of the swim, discover an underground waterfall. Jump off the cliffs into a deep pool if you two are the type to cliff jump. Or kayak a tropical river and add zip lining to several excursions if you crave the feeling of the wind whipping through your hair.\n\nAdd fishing excursions to your honeymoon package to take advantage of world-class angling. Trolling in deep water is an excellent way to fish as a couple if one of you wants to land a legend, and your other half wants a lazy boat ride in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nTest your skills on the shallow sand flats near the coast by fly fishing from a shallow skiff or wading and casting in the clear blue water. Our guides take care of everything, so the two of you can spend the day loading up on years of fish tales.\n\nDining for Two\n\nCotton Tree Lodge operates as part of our local community. Many of the ingredients for the fresh, hand-prepared meals served as part of your all-inclusive honeymoon package are grown on the property at our sustainable farm. You might be gazing at a mango tree and enjoying the fruit at the same time. Join us at the main lodge for three meals a day and an appetizer in the bar before dinner. Mingling in the lodge is the perfect opportunity to catch up with fellow guests after a day of wild adventures—or lazy days of swinging on a rope swing over the Moho River.\n\nBreakfast is buffet style and features everything you need to fuel your day, whatever you have planned. Enjoy just-picked tropical fruits and juices, freshly baked breads, pancakes, and breakfast meats, and we would never forget the coffee or tea.\n\nLunches at the main lodge are a chance to experience local flavors as the chef creates traditional dishes like rice and beans, and familiar favorites like burritos based on the best ingredients available that day. Full-day excursions will include a delicious picnic or packed lunch fresh from the chef’s kitchen.\n\nEnjoy a romantic dinner every night of your stay. Four courses await you beginning with soup and salad and ending with dessert.\n\nAll-inclusive honeymoon packages at Cotton Tree Lodge include local wine, beer, and cocktails made with just-squeezed fruit. Ask the bartender for a recommendation based on what’s fresh. Join guests at our riverside bar in the evenings—or take your nightcap to your private balcony overlooking the Moho River, where you can enjoy the soothing sounds of the jungle transitioning from day to night.\n\nRelax and Unwind\n\nWeddings can be stressful and your honeymoon is your opportunity to unwind. A honeymoon in Belize at Cotton Tree Lodge will slow your pace. We’re five miles off the nearest paved road, and you’ll never hear any traffic or blaring TVs. The only cacophony you might encounter is a wave of peaceful birdsongs.\n\nYou’re welcome to use the gazebo for your own garden-view yoga practice.\n\nTalk to the staff upon arrival to schedule spa services sure to leave you without a care in the world. The Toledo district where Cotton Tree Lodge is situated is world-famous for chocolate, so consider a chocolate couples massage for an experience you’ll never forget.\n\nHoneymoon Packages\n\nJoin us at Cotton Tree Lodge to celebrate your honeymoon and experience what it feels like to be our guest. Our goal is to ensure you feel cared for while you spend time together and begin your married life. Let us handle everything, from delicious meals to making the bed, while you enjoy your time however you wish—from kayaking and fishing to swimming behind a waterfall. Congratulations on your marriage! Your honeymoon in Belize awaits."
