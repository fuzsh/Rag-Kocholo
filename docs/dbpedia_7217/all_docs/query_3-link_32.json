        "text": "Conversations between brothers Vinod and Ashok Hindocha haven’t been the same in more than a decade.\n\n“Maybe this happened? Maybe that happened? We need to know the truth,” they say. Tragically, they are talking about Vinod’s daughter Anni Dewani, who was kidnapped while on her honeymoon in South Africa on 13 November 2010 and later found dead.\n\nDuring a late-night tour, the taxi carrying Anni, an engineer born in Mariestad in Sweden, and her new husband Shrien Dewani, from Bristol, was hijacked at gunpoint in Gugulethu, a township 15km from Cape Town.\n\nThe taxi driver was released, followed by Shrien, 30, but Anni, 28, was found the next morning in the vehicle, the fatal gunshot wound in her neck.\n\nThree men from South Africa – the taxi driver and two hijackers – were imprisoned for their part in her murder. Shrien Dewani, accused of organising his wife’s murder, was extradited to South Africa but the trial was thrown out due to insufficient evidence before he was put on the stand. In the eyes of the law he remains innocent of any charge.\n\nIndeed, in the eyes of many, this was perceived at the time as an open-and-shut case, but it continues to torment the Hindochas every day. “Still, today, we don’t know exactly what happened,” says Ashok, 61, Anni’s uncle. “That brings a lot of uncertainty. Guessing what happened and knowing what happened are two different things. We want to know what happened.”\n\nOn the 11th anniversary of Anni’s death, a four-part Discovery+ series named Anni: The Honeymoon Murder reviews the twists and turns of the story, the investigation, and gathers testimony from witnesses, detectives and family members. The number of unanswered questions the family still have, all these years later, is astounding.\n\nIt’s little surprise, given what viewers hear from key players in the investigation. Captain Paul Hendrikse, the lead investigator on the case, speaks of “alarm bells” going off when he arrived at the crime scene and hearing the alleged story. Journalist Leigh-Anne Jansen describes the case as “eerie”, saying: “This wasn’t one of our normal crimes.”\n\nAnother journalist, Maygene de Wee, admitted crime was rife but the violence involved in this case was jarring. She says in the documentary: “But the question still bothered me, why kill Anni?”\n\nWhy Anni had to die haunts the Hindochas, too. They ruminate on the alleged events of the night she died, why the couple were even in a township – renowned for being dangerous – how the story didn’t fit the typical crime and details of the accounts told in court.\n\n“Every time I speak with my brother, we always bring this subject up. Maybe this happened, maybe this happened, maybe that happened. We need to know the truth,” Ashok, who features in the documentary series, tells i.\n\nHearing Ashok talk, the sense of disbelief and confusion that has been building for 11 years is palpable. He hopes the documentary series will shine fresh light on what happened to his niece.\n\nHe and the rest of his family try to remember the Anni they knew growing up in Sweden – but it’s not easy.\n\nWith an affectionate chuckle, Ashok, who runs a restaurant in Sweden, says “she was very bubbly, very joyful. A very happy person. Always laughing, always making jokes, making everybody happy wherever she went.\n\n“I think her dream was just to get happily married. Have a family, have a normal, happy life.”\n\nThe reality was very different. And the Hindocha family saw their very private tragedy grip the press in South Africa, Sweden and Britain. “It was difficult because a lot of press from what we could gather… they saw this as a way to make some extra bucks.\n\n“They wanted big headlines, some journalists were not objective, lies were told, they used to call, behind our back, people we hardly know to get some headlines that just were not accurate. But that’s the way it is.\n\n“You can’t control everything and that’s not our aim. Our aim was just we want to find the truth.”\n\nAshok’s sentiments are universal for the families of victims, who are often forgotten in crimes, says Dr Cheryl Allsop, a senior lecturer in criminology and criminal justice at the University of South Wales.\n\n“When something bad happens, you want to know why. And it’s why, sometimes, families want to meet the offender because they want to understand: ‘Why did you do it’? ‘Why did you choose this person… Why did they have to kill?’” says Dr Allsop.\n\n“It is those unanswered questions. Sometimes you get some of those answers from a trial, sometimes you don’t. But you do still want to know how it came to be because it’s beyond your comprehension.\n\n“In a trial, someone might just plead guilty at the end, but never give evidence and never say why – a lot of offenders use that as a little bit of a point of power.\n\n“It’s not unusual to want to know, even with a conviction, well why? You can just put yourself in that position.”\n\nAshok says: “It’s haunting us, what happened? What happened? What happened? I’m sure people who were involved in this haven’t come forward. It should be hanging in the heads too.\n\n“But I think that the programme – I hope they’ve done a very fair and square programme – I’m sure it might raise probably some more questions and hopefully we’ll get some more answers out of it.\n\n“But fight for justice is something that the Hindocha family will never ever give up on.”"
