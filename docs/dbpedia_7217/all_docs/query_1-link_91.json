        "text": "In today’s world of second marriages, mixed families, and first marriages that happen sometime after the kids arrive, honeymoons have become a lot more a two-person vacation. What used to be purely a romantic getaway for the newly married pair doesn’t necessarily work for all couples. Some of them want to bring the kids, and that’s meant rethinking the whole honeymoon concept for resorts and destinations. Here are some options to consider if you’re looking to bring the whole brood on your honeymoon … or should we say familymoon?\n\nLand of the Mouse\n\nThis Florida mecca has a lot going for it – warm weather, good airline connectivity, inexpensive flights, and a ton of activities to choose from. In addition to the Walt Disney World parks, you could easily spend a day or two at the Universal Resorts, Sea World and Discovery Cove. Orlando’s other big bonus is that there is a huge variety of lodging options, from inexpensive motels to five-star resorts, not to mention a plethora of timeshare-type condos that can be rented for a few nights or a week. If you don’t want to be park hopping all day, every day, you can choose a higher end resort and chill by the pool all day while deciding on a restaurant for dinner.\n\nSurfin’ USA\n\nThe 50th state offers so much for the whole family, from the excitement of Waikiki to the volcanoes of the Big Island, and the lush valleys of Kauai to the beautiful resorts of Maui. The larger resorts are very family oriented, with enormous pool decks, water slides and lazy rivers. And with Hawaii, any season provides beautiful weather and so many outdoor activities to choose from.\n\nCruisin’\n\nWhether you’re looking to soak up some sun on a Caribbean cruise, venture to Alaska in the summertime, or go exotic and ply the waters of the Mediterranean Sea or the Baltic Sea, cruises are great choices for families or extended families. Individuals can participate in as many or as few group outings as desired, and a lot of the planning is done for you – pick an itinerary you like, and voila! Couples can still get away for a romantic dinner or two at one of the upcharge restaurants.\n\nGo All In\n\nPopular in parts of Mexico and the Caribbean, all-inclusive resorts that cater to families have a lot of the benefits of cruise ships, including kids programs, for when the newlyweds want a little time to themselves. Beaches Family Resorts is one popular choice; the Sandals-owned properties are located in Negril, Jamaica; Providenciales, Turks & Caicos; and Ocho Rios, Jamaica.\n\nRoad Trippin’\n\nSome familymoons take the scenic route, hitting multiple national parks, or picking one popular state to focus on – California, Arizona and Colorado are common choices. Or a summertime drive through New England or Quebec may work better for your family, focusing on some more historical stops. You may also consider renting an RV from a site like rvshare.com or cruiseamerica.com, to save on hotel and meal costs.\n\nVenture to Europe\n\nSome culture may be just what your family honeymoon ordered. If you plan an open jaw routing, you can fly into one city and then return home from another. Then use the continent’s amazing rail system to explore a country or region.\n\nSafari Culture\n\nCosmopolitan Cape Town is a delight, and reminiscent of San Francisco in some ways, with its natural beauty, progressive attitudes, and open, artistic culture. Make this your headquarters for several days as you explore the stunning cape region, from mountains to beaches and vineyards. Then head up to Kruger National Park near the border with Zimbabwe and Mozambique for a few days of safari – and a honeymoon finale that no one in the family will ever forget."
