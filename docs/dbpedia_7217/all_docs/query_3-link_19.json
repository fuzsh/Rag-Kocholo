        "text": "The first known usage of the term “hony moone” was found in English in 1546, but the concept, then, was entirely different from that found even in the 18th century. The origin of the word is charmingly simple when laid out; the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines the word “honeymoon” as one which originated from “the idea or concept that the first month of a marriage is the sweetest”, hence honey referring to sweetness and moon referring to a calendar month.\n\nModern Honeymoons\n\nIf you asked modern newlyweds why they honeymooned they would probably tell you that they needed a break after planning the wedding, and this is probably true! Nonetheless, historically the origin of honeymooning has much more to do with the needs of family and societal expectations. The honeymoon first began to form with the “bridal tour” that many elite couples took in Great Britain in the 18th century. The point of this was generally to visit those family members and close friends who were unable to attend the wedding for any reason. This became popular throughout Europe very quickly, and it was known in France as a voyagé à la façon anglaise (English-style voyage) after the 1820’s.\n\nTravel for pleasure\n\nThe honeymoon evolved once more during the Belle Epoque era which saw a push for more widespread tourism result in newly married couples travelling abroad purely for pleasure. This was interesting as the view of the day was that women were far too fragile and delicate for travel. Nonetheless Italy and the French Riviera became the honeymoon destinations of choice. The tradition at this point was for the couple to depart on their honeymoon directly from their own wedding reception in order to catch a late ship or train to their destination.\n\nRelaxation\n\nThese days the honeymoon is less mired in tradition, and has become an opportunity for newlyweds to put the business of everyday life on hold in order to relax, bond, and enjoy some time alone after the stress and hassle of wedding planning. Some do keep it old school and leave from their reception, but many people now leave it for a day or two to catch their breath, and the destinations and activities have, likewise, diversified.\n\nHiking in Peru, clubbing in Cancun, whale watching in Puerto Vallarta and soaking up the culture of Florence are all equally plausible and common for the honeymooners of today; it’s about indulging yourself at this most formative transitional period of your lives together."
