We can’t agree on a destination.\n\nMy partner wants to do the USA (New York and then a internal flight to Miami) and I would like to do Thailand or Bali. Honeymoon is/would be in June 2024 so thailands rainy season which kind of rules it out.\n\nWhere did you all go on honeymoon ? And would you recommend it….\n\nWe have to take our 2 kids so must be family friendly. (age 12/10)\n\nHoneymoon: Sri Lanka - this was right after a truce had been called on the civil war and the political situation was fairly stable. Beautiful memories - food, people, weather, landscape. Bali: We recently did a family trip with our 2 kids - age 5 and 7. Fantastic holiday esp for kids, lots of beach/hiking activities. Would recommend if you are able to go for 7-10 days. New york - have always done it as a city break so it all depends on what you want to be doing on your honeymoon.\n\nLake District for two nights in a B&B. When we arrived, we were dismayed to discover it was a family home in the middle of a housing estate and we were the only guests staying (no Internet in those days and it was named something like Ivy Cottage, which it most definitely was not) . Our bedroom, complete with twin beds, was accessed through the study which contained our \"En suite\". The dad of the family was working in the study all the time we were there and I had to walk past him to get to the shower etc. We mistakenly told them it was our honeymoon and while we were out they went in the room, pushed the beds together and unpacked our cases, laying out some fancy new nightwear I'd bought especially for our honeymoon across the bed, I was so embarrassed. The next morning the kids served us breakfast and basically climbed all over the table whilst we were eating it. We left after one night and booked into a proper hotel even though we were absolutely skint."
