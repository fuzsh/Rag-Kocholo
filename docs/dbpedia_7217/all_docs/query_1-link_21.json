        "text": "Vishal Parvani:\n\nBut for us specifically, the reason why we chose Patagonia is we could have been lazy on a beach, but I feel like you get bored of that within two or three days. We'd go into the Maldives, which is something we were discussing, and all the people that I know have been there, they're like, \"After two days, you're so over it.\"\n\nWe could have done that, but we need to be moving constantly. Every day was something different, and that just kept it exciting. We've been together for 10-plus years and having something new is very hard for us to find. Patagonia was something new for both of us.\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nEvery day we had jaw dropping moments.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nThat's amazing, and Richa, I think exactly what you said before - and when I say before, I would say in the '90s and before - Patagonia used to be a destination exclusively for people willing to rough it. You either had to camp or stay at one of the refuges, which were very basic back in the day. I believe Explorer was the only high-end property. It's no longer a destination for very active people or very avid hikers.\n\nThe Jeeps are there too. The crowd tends to be younger because of all the hiking opportunities, but with so much more we see a lot of multi-generational travel too, including grandparents and little kids.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nWas there any reason for you guys, why specifically Patagonia? Did you see a documentary? Was it all over your Instagram, or…?\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nInstagram had a little bit to do with it.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nBut I haven't seen many people who go to Patagonia. We wanted to do something different, not something that's just full of tourists.\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nFor me, I think I was looking at places just randomly. I must have been looking at hiking videos. I got into Patagonia and I was like, “Vishal, I think I found the place that we need to go to.” A couple of our other friends had mentioned that Patagonia would be a cool place for a honeymoon. Maybe Instagram heard me.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nAnd we popped up.\n\nYou messaged us, right, Richa?\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nYeah. Best choice ever that we made.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nI'm happy you got to read some of the comments from our past clients, but in general, the destinations that Quasar goes to, Galapagos or Patagonia, they need very little selling.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nAlso, what I really loved was how flexible it was. The weather changes all the time, but in Patagonia, you basically can go with the flow, and if something doesn't happen the way you planned it, there are so many other options. There was one day that we were supposed to go on a boat, the La Peninsula, but the weather wind was strong, and we ended up doing a full-day hike. If we were on the boat that day, we wouldn't have stumbled upon a puma in the park. It was so wild. It was just like this was meant to be.\n\nWe've done so many national parks, we've done Machu Picchu, Inca Trail, and Patagonia is just on the top.\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nSo I think the biggest difference, at least for me, was to be disconnected from the world and just with nature. Obviously at the hotels you have Wi-Fi and cell service, but when you're out and about the town, there's not really a lot of service, which is really nice.\n\nYou actually got to be present in the moment. When we would go back to the hotel, even though you had access to everything again, you were so happy from the day, and the hotel itself was so beautiful and the food and the atmosphere…you don't care to be on your phone.\n\nIn our world and our careers, we live on it. So it was very nice to have a place where you can go and you actually are disconnected and want to be disconnected.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nI'm so glad you mentioned that because in the Galapagos, you're obviously on the boat and the boat does have Wi-Fi but we restrict the hours when it's available. For the first couple of days it can be challenging but soon you realize that it's okay to be disconnected.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nWe absolutely loved that aspect about it.\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nWe ate berries off the trail. We drank water from the waterfall. We're like, we're living off the land, this is the best and we can just move here. We saw three condors flying right above us. Our guide was like, \"This isn't normal, they're never this low.\" It was just the perfect day.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nThat excursion is amazing. I don't know if in the map you know exactly where you were when you were surrounded by the three glaciers. The Dickson Glacier is in Chile. You guys were right there, but you were in another country, you were in Argentina. You were literally between the two countries, which are separated by these tall peaks.\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nBy far one of the best hikes, and then obviously spotting the puma was pretty cool.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nSo we didn't fight during our honeymoon. It's because of that. The biggest tip was having a good planner. What's your second tip for Patagonia?\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nBe flexible and be prepared for weather. Yes, lots of layers, and just be flexible. I think if you're flexible, honestly, you'll enjoy Patagonia so much more. You can't control the weather.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nAnd there's so many options. So there's no one right way to do it over there. And what's your third tip?\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nDefinitely do it via Jeep with you guys. Having the Jeep was so much fun since a lot of the roads are still kind of dirt roads over there.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nAnd get a lot of massages, hit the spas.\n\nTHE INCREDIBLE WILDLIFE & THE GUANACOS\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nThe summer days are super, super long. Some of our programs, like the puma tracking programs, leave the hotel before sunrise and come back after sunset.\n\nSo you guys saw guanacos, you saw condors, you saw pumas, probably saw a lot of the caracaras. Did you guys get to see any eagles?\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nWe didn't see eagles. We saw a bunch of foxes.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nGray and red.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nOh you saw, that's great. I think I've only seen red or gray fox once or twice.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nWe got really lucky seeing animals somehow. I feel like I summoned them.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nOh, and we saw, what are they called? The cowboys over there. Oh, the gauchos.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nThe gauchos and they're herding thousands and thousands of sheep.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nThat's the only traffic you'll run into in Patagonia is when the sheep are in the middle of the road.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nWell, we'd be happy to have you if Galapagos is the choice.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nWhen's the best time of year for Galapagos?\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nThe great thing, as opposed to Patagonia where the seasons change, the weather is…\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nPretty consistent.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nIt stays pretty consistent throughout the year, so it mainly depends on what you want to see and do. The best season for snorkeling, the highlight of Galapagos, is between June and November. That's the best time to see whales, orcas.\n\nFernando – Quasar:\n\nAmazing, guys. That was it. That's all my questions. I don't know if you guys have any additional questions.\n\nVishal Parvani:\n\nNo, I just wanted to say thank you again. That was really well planned and exceeded all our expectations.\n\nRicha Sadana:\n\nI don't think we could have had a better honeymoon than that. You guys honestly made it very easy and seamless and stress-free."
