        "text": "Believe it or not, not all couples who get married go on a honeymoon. Work, financial, and career commitments, among other things, cause couples to skip the honeymoon altogether.\n\nWhile you might think that’s not a big deal, skipping the honeymoon can actually have a significantly negative effect on your marriage and your relationship.\n\nOn today’s episode, we’re talking to a real expert on the topic of honeymoons, paying for the honeymoon, and wedding registries in general.\n\nIf today is your first time visiting Verve Event Co., welcome! My name is Desiree Adams and I'm a wedding planner based in upstate NY. Through my blog and podcast, Ask the Planner, I share all the tips and tricks I've gathered over the years to help YOU plan an unforgettable wedding.\n\nUnique Honeymoon Destinations And Why Taking a Honeymoon Can Save Your Marriage with Sara Margulis of Honeyfund: Episode 94\n\nAs a bride-to-be in 2005, Sara and her fiance already had everything they needed for their home, but they didn’t have the budget to take their dream honeymoon. They loved to travel and fantasized about a far-off destination like Fiji to take them away from the stress of working two full-time jobs and planning a wedding. So they asked their friends and family to contribute to a wishlist of costs and experiences that would make their dream honeymoon happen.\n\nTheir wedding guests surprised them with more than $5,000 in contributions – but even more than that, they raved about the idea and asked them if they would make something like that for other couples. The couple was aspiring entrepreneurs with backgrounds in marketing and software engineering, so they put their heads together and created Honeyfund in 2006.\n\nThe site gained traction by the viral nature of the product – everyone who signed up invited 150 of their closest friends and family to view their page. Fast forward to 2011, Honeyfund was featured by MarthaStewartWeddings.com and then chosen as one of TIME Magazine’s 50 Best Websites of 2012. In 2014, Honeyfund appeared on Shark Tank and gained a partnership with Kevin O’Leary (aka “Mr. Wonderful”). Honeyfund is now the most trusted cash and honeymoon registry in the wedding space. Nearly 1.2 million couples have created Honeyfund registries and nearly $1 billion has been gifted.\n\nNOT PLANNING YOUR WEDDING YET?
