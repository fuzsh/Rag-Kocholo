        "text": "We’re dumbfounded at the prospect of staying in a terrace apartment in Paris or a beachside bungalow in Tulum, Mexico, for under $100 a night. With Airbnb, budget-conscious newlyweds now have more options for affordable honeymoon accommodations.\n\nIn homage to honeymoons that won’t break the bank, Shane Co. explored the average cost of a week-long honeymoon booked on Airbnb in over 80 cities across every continent, based on The Knot’s and Travel & Leisure’s lists of top honeymoon destinations in 2023. In each destination, we tallied up the average costs of airfare, Airbnb stays, Airbnb experiences, food, drink, and more to find the most affordable cities and countries for your dream honeymoon on a budget!\n\nKey Findings\n\nBased on our study data, the average Airbnb honeymoon cost is $5,255.\n\nWith an average cost of $6,884, Australia is the most expensive continent for an Airbnb honeymoon — 31% more expensive than the average cost.\n\nTurks & Caicos, Greece, and St. Barts are the most expensive countries for honeymooners staying in an Airbnb — each averages more than $7,000.\n\nGrace Bay in Turks & Caicos is the most expensive Airbnb honeymoon destination, averaging $9,382 — over 75% more expensive than the average cost.\n\nBon Voyage: The Average Cost of an Airbnb Honeymoon by Continent\n\nAlthough airfare can get pricey for those beautiful honeymoon destinations in Asia, Africa, and South America, once you get there, you will be pleased to find that you can save roughly a thousand dollars on average compared to honeymoon destinations in Europe and North America. For example, eating dinner out for six nights in Cartagena, Colombia, will cost a newlywed couple $122.34 on average, while doing the same in Ibiza, Spain, will set you back $509.34.\n\nOn the other hand, a honeymoon down under might force you to go a little over budget. An Aussie vacation is costly all around, making it the most expensive continent for a romantic getaway. On Hamilton Island, for instance, the average Airbnb nightly price is $522, while a couple of round-trip tickets for Byron Bay are $3,441. If you have your heart set on the outback, you might want to start planning ahead.\n\nMapping Out the Cost of an Airbnb Honeymoon by Country\n\nOn the interactive map below, hover over each country to see its average Airbnb honeymoon cost and its percentage above or below the average honeymoon cost. Zoom in to get a closer look at costs on each continent!\n\nTurks & Caicos is the most expensive country to honeymoon in by far. The cost of an Airbnb honeymoon in Grace Bay is roughly $9,382, making it over $4,000 more than the average cost. For many travelers, Grace Bay is a bucket list destination for its crystal clear waters and expansive beaches with soft white sand that stretch for miles; however, you might just have to stretch your money if you plan on visiting.\n\nIf you were thinking of saving money by honeymooning domestically, think again if your plans include visiting Aspen, Colorado, or Nantucket, Massachusetts. While you might be able to save a few bucks by turning it into a road trip, you will surely make it up once you get there. The cost of an Airbnb honeymoon in either location will cost you just over $8,000, putting it nearly $3,000 over the average.\n\nWith average honeymoon costs over $7,000, Maui (#8), Key West (#9), Big Sur in California (#12), and the Hamptons in New York (#14) are the other U.S. destinations that landed on the list of the top 20 most expensive places for an Airbnb honeymoon.\n\nThe Most & Least Expensive Destinations for an Airbnb Honeymoon\n\nIf you are looking for cost-efficient honeymoon destinations far from the beaten path, Southeast Asia is home to a hidden treasure trove of things to do and sights to see. Luang Prabang in Laos is the cheapest honeymoon destination on our list ($2,517) and remains relatively untouched by tourism.\n\nDespite being off the radar for many, Luang Prabang has much to offer. The city is home to many beautiful temples, French-villas-turned-boutique-hotels, and gold-leaf Buddhas. Luang Prabang also has many nature trails that go deep into the hills and the mesmerizing Kuang Si waterfall.\n\nMykonos ($9,208) and Santorini ($8,969) in Greece are the second and third most expensive honeymoon destinations on our list, respectively. The pair of islands in the Aegean Sea are known for their rich histories, remarkable views, and first-class restaurants and wineries.\n\nWhile Mykonos and Santorini are perfect for honeymooning, they are also busy tourist spots, meaning there aren’t a lot of cost-effective accommodations available if you’re keeping a close eye on your spending.\n\nIf you and your fiancé have your hearts set on a European honeymoon but aren’t trying to spend an arm and a leg to make it happen, consider visiting cities like Prague and Budapest, where the average Airbnb honeymoon cost hovers around $3,200. Both locations offer budget-friendly options for lovebirds looking to experience the best of what European cities have to offer.\n\nPrague in the Czech Republic is home to over a thousand years of history and is widely known for its Old Town Square, Gothic churches, and vibrant Baroque architecture. Similarly, Hungary’s capital city is known for its lively culture, underground caves, and local eats. Did we mention Budapest is also the mineral spa capital of the world?\n\nFull Data\n\nInterested in diving deeper into the numbers of the most and least expensive destinations for an Airbnb honeymoon? We’ve compiled our full data study for all 85 honeymoon destinations analyzed into the interactive data table below. Search for the destination you’re most intrigued by or click on the heading of each column to sort by that category!\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nWe were amazed to find that Airbnb has opened up new possibilities for newlyweds looking for an affordable honeymoon. Through our analysis of cities across every continent, based on the top honeymoon destinations for 2022, we discovered a range of options for a cost-effective romantic getaway. We hope our findings help you plan the honeymoon of your dreams and the journey of a lifetime!\n\nIf you’re not engaged yet but dreaming of that special moment, let Shane Co. help make your vision a reality. Our collection of engagement rings and wedding bands is full of stunning pieces that will take you from dating to forever. With so much to plan for your future, why not make the transition to engagement just as memorable as your dream honeymoon? Start your journey toward happily ever after with Shane Co.\n\nMethodology\n\nIn our quest to uncover the most and least expensive locations for an Airbnb honeymoon across the globe, we analyzed 85 destinations based on the lists of best honeymoon destinations from The Knot and Travel & Leisure for 2022-2023.\n\nTo determine the cost of an Airbnb honeymoon, we considered nine cost factors, including airfare, Airbnb accommodations, Airbnb experiences, food, alcohol, and taxi fare for an average honeymoon length of seven days and six nights, as advised by Brides.com. The total cost for each destination was calculated by adding up all nine cost factors.\n\nIn the context of this study, an “Airbnb honeymoon” refers to the cost of accommodations and experiences using Airbnb listings only and does not include the cost of other hotels or resorts not listed on Airbnb’s site. Airbnb experiences vary by destination and can range from snorkeling and horseback riding to cooking classes and wine tours.\n\nCost factors include:\n\nAverage Airbnb Nightly Price (Entire Home)\n\nSource: Airbnb\n\nAverage Airbnb Experience Price (For 2)\n\nSource: Airbnb Experiences\n\nAverage Flight Cost (Round-Trip For 2)\n\nSource: Champion Traveler & Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)\n\nCost of a Three-Course Dinner at a Restaurant (For 2)\n\nSource: Numbeo\n\nCost of Breakfast/Lunch Meals (For 2)\n\nSource: Expatistan\n\nCost of Beer at a Bar (For 2)\n\nSource: Expatistan\n\nCost of Cocktails at a Bar (For 2)\n\nSource: Expatistan\n\nCost of Wine at a Market\n\nSource: Expatistan\n\nCost of Taxi Rides"
