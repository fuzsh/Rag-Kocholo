        "text": "Discover 27 types of honeymoons and pick your perfect holiday\n\nHoneymoons have come a long way since their humble 5th century origins, when newlyweds would drink honeyed mead after their first moon together.\n\nThe mead was believed to have aphrodisiac properties to help with conception, and wedding guests would give the sweet drink as a gift to the married couple.\n\nBy the 19th century, honeymoons had evolved into a trip that couples would take to visit family and friends who couldn’t make it to their wedding.\n\nToday, honeymoons can range from a small, intimate trip, to a round-the-world extravaganza, and the options are endless.\n\nYou can go zip-lining in the jungle, venture on safari in Kenya, trek the Himalayas, go from rustic camping to big cities, or lounge in a luxury tropical destination.\n\nEvery couple is different, from their interests, budget and timeframe, so to celebrate Valentine’s Day this 14 February, we’ve put together the ultimate guide to every type of honeymoon.\n\n1. Adventuremoon\n\n2. Babymoon\n\n3. Beachmoon\n\n4. Campmoon\n\n5. Citymoon\n\n6. Cruisemoon\n\n7. Culturemoon\n\n8. Earlymoon\n\n9. Ecomoon\n\n10. Engagement-moon\n\n11. Familymoon\n\n12. Foodiemoon\n\n13. LGBT-moon\n\n14. Luxurymoon\n\n15. Manymoon\n\n16. Minimoon\n\n17. Partymoon\n\n18. Railmoon\n\n19. Roadtrip-moon\n\n20. Safarimoon\n\n21. Snowmoon\n\n22. Spiritualmoon\n\n23. Themepark-moon\n\n24. Trekmoon\n\n25. Unplugged-moon\n\n26. Volunteer-moon\n\n27. Winerymoon\n\n1. Adventuremoon\n\nA thrilling honeymoon for the adventurous couple seeking outdoor adventure and an adrenaline rush. An adventuremoon is packed with action like hiking, abseiling, kayaking, scuba diving, skydiving, snorkelling and biking.\n\nWhere to go for an adventuremoon?\n\nCape Town, South Africa, is the ultimate adventure destination, where you can hike soaring mountain ranges, see the Big Five in the wild, and dive with Great White Sharks.\n\nSatisfy your adrenaline itch in Zambia, with thrilling walking safaris and the colossal Victoria Falls, where you can go bungee-jumping, white-water rafting, ziplining and swim to the edge at Devil’s Pool.\n\nThrill-seekers will also love New Zealand, especially the adrenaline capital of Queenstown, which boasts the Nevis Swing and the Nevis Catapult, the biggest catapult in the world.\n\nFor a truly intrepid honeymoon, head to Antarctica, the world’s last great wilderness and a place where few others have gone before. You can camp on the ice, go kayaking through icebergs and even take the chilly polar plunge.\n\n2. Babymoon\n\nThe last holiday for a couple before their baby is born, often taken in the first or second trimester. Regardless of whether you’re engaged or getting married, a babymoon is a great way to relax and spend time together before the baby arrives.\n\nWhere to go for a babymoon?\n\nMany couples like to take their last child-free holiday somewhere relaxing and romantic. The Maldives is renowned as a couple’s paradise, with luxurious resorts and dreamy beaches. Portugal is another beautiful destination with gorgeous cities, sunny beaches and stunning architecture.\n\n3. Beachmoon\n\nA blissful honeymoon for the beach-bum newlyweds who love sun, sand and sea. Picture idyllic shores, tasty cocktails, fantastic snorkelling and peaceful retreats. You’ll spend your days exploring crystal clear waters, coral reefs, island jungles, or simply kick back with a coconut.\n\nWhere to go for a beachmoon?\n\nFor pristine beaches, luxurious resorts and incredible marine life, head to the Maldives or Bora Bora. Both are renowned as honeymoon hotspots, but if you’re looking for something more off-the-beaten path, venture to Zanzibar, Mauritius or the Seychelles, renowned for their powdery white sand, waterfalls, wildlife, and spectacular coral reefs.\n\n4. Campmoon\n\nPerfect for couples who love the outdoors, a campmoon features scenic destinations, peaceful locations and an immersion into nature. Inject some romance into your camping honemyoon by staying at ‘glamping’ sites, which offer a private, luxury experience.\n\nWhere to go for a campmoon?\n\nNew Zealand is an incredible camping destination, with a number of lavish ‘glampsites’ in the pristine bushland. Our favourites are Hurunui Jacks in Hokitika and Magic Cottages at Takou River.\n\nCambodia is another great glamping destination, with the iconic Shinta Mani Wild offering sustainable, luxury camping in the jungle.\n\n5. Citymoon\n\nAn urban escape, ideal for the cosmopolitan couple who love the culture, entertainment, sights and bright lights of the big cities. Wander the streets, sample the local street food, explore the museums and galleries, indulge in fine dining, head to the theatre or a concert, and shop ‘til you drop.\n\nWhere to go for a citymoon?\n\nRenowned for its lavish malls, hotels and dining, Dubai is brimming with big city glitz and glamour, or head to Europe to be spoiled with choice - London, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, Barcelona and Berlin are sure to seduce you.\n\nFor a citymoon in Asia that will ignite the senses, consider Delhi, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore or Tokyo. In South America we love Buenos Aires in Argentina.\n\n6. Cruisemoon\n\nA cruisemoon allows you to simply board a ship and kick back as you sail around the world. It’s ideal for newlyweds looking for a relaxing, intimate honeymoon, while visiting spectacular destinations.\n\nWhere to go for a cruisemoon?\n\nWhere you cruise may depend on where you live. Those in North or South America are close to beachy Caribbean cruises, while newlyweds in Europe could consider a romantic European river cruise down the Danube, Rhine or Seine Rivers.\n\nThose based in Australasia are well positioned for a Pacific Island cruise, taking you to magical islands like Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu.\n\nIf you’re looking for something more adventurous, venture on a cruise to Antarctica, where you’ll see penguins, seals and whales in a pristine, icy wonderland.\n\n7. Culturemoon\n\nThis type of honeymoon focuses on soaking up the culture of a destination, and typically includes visiting museums and galleries, taking cooking classes, or attending festivals and events.\n\nWhere to go for a culturemoon?\n\nJapan is bursting with fascinating culture and you can have some unique experiences such as soaking in an onsen or staying in a traditional ryokan. Peru is another culturally rich destination, with ancient ruins, superb cuisine and colourful towns.\n\nFrom learning about the Vietnam war history in Ho Chi Minh or taking a cooking class in Chiang Mai, to learning to salsa in Medellin or taking a painting class in Florence, a culturemoon can be a romantic and enriching honeymoon.\n\n8. Earlymoon\n\nA pre-wedding honeymoon, usually taken a few months before the wedding day to unwind and spend time together. Planning a wedding can be stressful, so why not take some time out before the big day to relax and connect with your partner.\n\nWhere to go for an earlymoon?\n\nWe recommend Sri Lanka for an earlymoon. With plenty of relaxing, intimate experiences, this beautiful destination is filled with powdery beaches, colourful temples, and lush tea fields.\n\nTake the romantic train ride through Ella, an enchanting town, surrounded by jungle-cloaked mountains and tea plantations.\n\n9. Ecomoon\n\nA honeymoon with a focus on sustainability, responsible travel and the world’s remarkable ecosystems. On an ecomoon, you’ll visit protected natural areas and wildlife reserves, and stay in romantic eco lodges.\n\nWhere to go for an ecomoon?\n\nRanked as one of the world’s best ecotourism destinations and a leader in sustainability, Costa Rica is the ultimate ecomoon destination.\n\nOver 25% of the country is designated as a protected area, and you’ll find adventure in a myriad of stunning ecosystems including cloud forests, wetlands, rainforests, volcanoes and coastline.\n\nEcuador is another great destination for an eco honeymoon, with the Galapagos Islands boasting some of the most unique ecosystems in the world. It’s incredibly important to protect this natural wonder, and you can take steps to ensure your visit contributes to sustainable projects in the area.\n\n10. Engagement-moon\n\nWhat better way to celebrate your engagement than with a romantic holiday together? An engagement-moon is the opportunity to relish your ‘just engaged’ glow, before the wedding planning begins.\n\nWhere to go for an engagement-moon?\n\nAmp up the romance with a trip to a city famed for its romantic nature, like Paris or Rome. You could also head to Sapa in northern Vietnam, to stay among the breathtaking terraced rice fields, or Bali in Indonesia for luxurious resorts, spiritual temples, and glorious sunsets on the beach.\n\n11. Familymoon\n\nA familymoon is for couples who already have children and want to enjoy their honeymoon as a family. Some couples also choose to have a destination wedding, with their family and guests making it a holiday for themselves too. Other newlyweds are simply happy to have friends and family join their holiday.\n\nWhere to go for a familymoon?\n\nAustralia is a fantastic family-friendly destination, with plenty of diverse regions and experiences that both children and adults will enjoy. Ireland is another great choice, with scenic romance and welcoming locals.\n\nYou may also prefer to stay at an all-inclusive resort in Phuket, or the Lake District in Argentina, so you can relax with your partner, while your children enjoy activities like swimming, kayaking, snorkelling and nature walks.\n\n12. Foodiemoon\n\nPerfect for gastronomes and plain lovers of food, a foodiemoon will delight your tastebuds and take you to the heart of a country through their cuisine. Spend your honeymoon eating, drinking and learning about the culinary culture of your destination.\n\nWhere to go for a foodiemoon?\n\nTake a tour around Europe’s top foodie destinations - eat pasta in Italy, tapas in Spain, cheese in France and sample the local wines wherever you go.\n\nAsia is another foodie hotspot, with tantalising smells wafting through the streets of Japan, India, Vietnam and Thailand. You can enjoy fantastic cooking classes from Bangkok and Hanoi, to Kyoto and Delhi.\n\n13. LGBT-moon\n\nThis is a honeymoon for LGBT couples wishing to travel to a spectacular destination that is also LGBT-friendly. Many countries still discriminate against gay couples, so it’s important to pick a honeymoon destination where you can feel safe and free to express your love and celebrate your marriage.\n\nWhere to go for a LGBT-moon?\n\nTel Aviv in Israel is renowned as the gay capital of the world. It’s one of the most liberal cities, with gay beaches, gay bars, and the famous Gay Pride week held every year. The city also boasts year-round sunshine, beautiful beaches, fantastic food and constant events.\n\nAmsterdam in the Netherlands is another top honeymoon spot for LGBT couples. As one of the first countries in the world to legalise same-sex marriage, Amsterdam has a wonderful LGBT culture and community, with plenty of gay bars, gay hotels and four gay districts, along with a myriad of gay pride parades every year.\n\n14. Luxurymoon\n\nA lavish honeymoon for newlyweds who want to indulge and be pampered in paradise. Think private beaches, impeccable service, gourmet food and wine, infinity pools and world-class spas, set in some of the most exclusive destinations in the world.\n\nWhere to go for a luxurymoon?\n\nIf you’re picturing a dreamy bungalow perched over dazzling blue water and white sands, head to Bora Bora or the Maldives, two renowned honeymoon havens.\n\nFor the ultimate luxury honeymoon, we also recommend Song Saa in the Koh Rong archipelago of Cambodia. This eco-friendly private island will personalise your honeymoon, from candelit dining and beach picnics, to private yoga and meditation classes and adventures around the stunning islands.\n\n15. Manymoon\n\nCouples who choose a manymoon, take a series of shorter trips throughout the first year (or more) of marriage. If you don't have time for a longer honeymoon, a manymoon is a great alternative, allowing you to stretch out your honeymoon bliss.\n\nWhere to go for a manymoon?\n\nEverywhere! The beauty of a manymoon is that you can choose a few of your favourite destinations and visit them throughout the year.\n\n16. Minimoon\n\nIf you can’t get away for your honeymoon straight after your wedding, consider taking a minimoon. This small honeymoon usually lasts around a week and is a great way to unwind after your big day.\n\nSome couples also take a tinymoon, which is generally a weekend getaway in their wedding destination.\n\nWhere to go for a minimoon?\n\nThe best destinations for minimoons are captivating cities or regions that will keep you occupied for a week or less. We recommend lively Cartagena in Colombia, the tranquil jungle of Laos, the beaches of Koh Samui in Thailand, or a romantic European city like Prague or Budapest.\n\n17. Partymoon\n\nA honeymoon for the couple that loves to party. If you don’t want your wedding celebrations to end, head to a destination that’s famed for its clubs, events, balmy weather and festive culture.\n\nWhere to go for a partymoon?\n\nKeep the party going in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro, loved for its beautiful beaches, friendly locals, dance clubs and the incredible Carnival, held in February each year. We also recommend Colombia, where the fun-loving locals love to salsa, or Buenos Aires, home of the sensual tango and a trendy nightlife scene.\n\n18. Railmoon\n\nA romantic trip by rail, this honeymoon allows newlyweds to take it slow and soak in the moment. A luxurious train journey offers lavish accommodation, cuisine, and the opportunity to hop off at some of the most beautiful destinations in the world.\n\nWhere to go for a railmoon?\n\nTake the iconic train journey from Singapore to Bangkok on the Eastern & Oriental Express, travelling through breathtaking landscapes with all the amenities of a five-star hotel.\n\nYou’ll find luxury train journeys around the world, from Japan and India to South Africa.\n\n19. Roadtrip-moon\n\nIf you love and your partner love the freedom of the great open road, consider taking a roadtrip-moon. Wind through scenic roads, stay in romantic lodges, and revel in the spontaneous adventures of a road trip. All you need is a car, a map and your lover.\n\nWhere to go for a roadtrip-moon?\n\nWith some of the most incredible scenery in the world and plenty of wide open roads, New Zealand is the perfect destination for a road trip honeymoon. You’ll never get tired of winding through the beautiful landscapes, with dazzling lakes, soaring mountains and enchanting forests at every turn.\n\nSouth Africa is another great place for a self-drive honeymoon, famed for its spectacular Garden Route, while Argentina will take you into the clouds to a land of natural wonders and archaeological treasures on the Calchaqui Valley circuit. For a classic romantic road trip honeymoon, head to the USA, and get your kicks on Route 66.\n\n20. Safarimoon\n\nA safarimoon is well-suited to the animal loving couple, but it’s also one of the most romantic types of honeymoon. You’ll stay in world-class luxury lodges nestled in the stunning African bush, and spend your days on thrilling safari drives to spot the world’s most majestic creatures.\n\nEnjoy champagne breakfasts and sunrise hot air balloon rides, private candelit dinners in the bush, romantic sundowners by the river, and relaxing beach getaways.\n\nWhere to go for a safarimoon?\n\nFor the best safari and beach destinations, head to east Africa. You can go on safari in the renowned Serengeti in Tanzania, before taking a quick flight to Zanzibar, a stunning island archipelago.\n\nYou can also hop over to neighbouring Kenya, venturing on safari in the Masai Mara before heading to the southern Kenya beaches to unwind in paradise.\n\n21. Snowmoon\n\nIf you and your partner prefer to ski than snorkel, hit the slopes for a magical snowy honeymoon. Spend your days skiing through the incredible landscapes, then spend your evenings soaking in an outdoor hot tub or getting cosy around a crackling log fire.\n\nWhere to go for a snowmoon?\n\nYou’ll be spoilt for choice with top ski destinations such as the awe-inspiring Swiss Alps and Austrian Tirol, the superb ski resorts of Hakuba and Niseko in Japan, or the famed slopes of Colorado in the USA or Whistler in Canada.\n\nFor the ultimate icy destination, take a cruise to Antarctica, where you can go cross-country skiing in the most remote wilderness on earth.\n\n22. Spiritualmoon\n\nThis is a peaceful, intimate honeymoon that focuses on the spirituality and culture of the destination. You’ll spend your days exploring sacred temples, tranquil gardens, and monasteries where you can learn from monks and nuns.\n\nWhere to go for a spiritualmoon?\n\nHead to Bagan in Myanmar to explore sandy plains strewn with ancient pagodas, and wake at dawn to take a romantic hot air balloon ride over the city, soaking up the ethereal sunrise.\n\nVisit Luang Prabang in Laos to find enchanting waterfalls, sacred cave temples and observe the monks walking into the city at sunrise to receive alms.\n\nIndia is another spiritual destination, packed with beautiful temples, fascinating history and holy festivals.
