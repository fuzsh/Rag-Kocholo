        "text": "We've saved over £6,000 to cover the cost of our wedding, but we've got very little left to pay for our honeymoon. We quite like the idea of a budget honeymoon and we're open to any ideas. What have other readers done?\n\nOther way round\n\nArrange a simple wedding. Marry on a beach with a handful of family and friends. Spend your money on a memorable honeymoon.\n\nNL, Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire\n\nSpare the expense\n\nThe answer you will probably get from many people is \"stuff the wedding\" and elope to have an all-in-one wedding and honeymoon on a beach somewhere. But a wedding for family and friends is an important outward sign of the commitment you are making. My husband and I had very little money for a honeymoon, being students, so his parents bought us a tent as a wedding gift and we set off by train and camped in the Loire Valley and Paris. It was very romantic, a fantastic time and we had many unique experiences - the stories are still told 28 years on. We are constantly bombarded by the idea that everything has to be expensive and exotic - it just has to be special for you.\n\nSarah Woodfield, Bromley, Kent\n\nAnonymous and low-key\n\nWe went for a budget honeymoon, partly due to lack of funds and partly as we wanted to avoid the clichéd romantic beach resorts. We spent five fantastic days in Berlin, flying with a budget airline and staying in a hostel. No one knew it was our honeymoon and we preferred it that way. As we had been living together for years and didn't need household items, we asked friends and family for spending money for our honeymoon as wedding presents, so we were able to treat ourselves while we were there.\n\nVicky Gilbertson, Manchester\n\nThere's no rush\n\nWho says the holiday aspect of the honeymoon has to be straight after the wedding? We married in 1962 and had a few days settling into our flat before going to work, as we couldn't afford to go away. In spring 1963 we tried to prove to my father, who told us that in his youth he could holiday on five guineas, that it was still possible, by hitching to Wales with a borrowed tent and £5. Alas, the money only lasted five days. By the summer we had saved enough for a holiday in Austria. We certainly never felt deprived.\n\nMargaret Squires, St Andrews\n\nVouching for vouchers\n\nInstead of presents, why not ask your guests to give you travel vouchers. My brother did, and he and his wife spent a belated honeymoon a year later on their dream holiday.\n\nFiona Johnson, Shaftesbury, Dorset\n\nHoneymoon hike\n\nHaving enjoyed walking the Cleveland Way - a 110-mile horseshoe shaped walk between Helmsley and Filey - a couple of years previously, for our honeymoon my husband and I decided to walk the missing link: the 60 miles that join the beginning and the end of the horseshoe. For most of the time it felt like we were the only two people in the world. The honeymoon was relaxing, life-affirming (we saw a lamb being born), rewarding and cheap. Oh, and nine months later our first-born made an appearance - not bad to say I was 37.\n\nAnne Rylatt, York\n\nHoliday and help\n\nIf you want somewhere romantic, cheap and beautiful then try Under the Thatch.\n\nThey have all sorts of places to say in west Wales including log cabins, Romany caravans and cottages, which are unusual, cheap, and very well kept. All the profits go to rescuing historic buildings at risk, and they were awarded the 2007 Guardian/Observer ethical travel award, against international competition. What more could you want?\n\nLadyGray, via the Money blog\n\nScottish retreat\n\nWe got married last summer and had a fantastic romantic week in the Scottish Highlands without breaking the bank. We took the Caledonian sleeper from King's Cross to Fort William, which was a magical way to start the holiday - especially waking up in the Highlands and having breakfast in our cabin. We then hired a car for the week so we could explore the local area and this enabled us to stay in two or three places. We found there was a wide range of accommodation available, from youth hostels and campsites to old hunting lodges, so you can choose what you are comfortable paying. We had a wonderful, relaxing time - the beauty of the countryside was breathtaking and even when it rained and we couldn't get out it was just as lovely to settle in front of a warm fire in a friendly pub. Another consideration was that we had kept our carbon footprint down by opting not to fly and the train journey was one of the highlights of the trip.\n\nCatherine Dean, London, who wins this week's £25 National Book Token\n\nBack to basics\n\nIt's only sex, for God's sake, not Mills & Boon. Save the \"holiday of a lifetime\" for when you're going to need it.\n\nName and address supplied\n\nGîte treat\n\nMaybe your readers looking for a budget honeymoon should ask last week's correspondent who recommended one of the French gîtes she was reduced to holidaying in during her deprived, private school-going childhood?\n\nBrenda Kirsch, London\n\nBased on trust\n\nHave a look at the Landmark Trust - they have some amazing properties, from windmills to lighthouses and castles, which are beautiful, in the UK, and very reasonably priced. Different and really romantic.\n\nAbimoore, via the Money blog\n\nThis week's question:\n\nI refuse to buy Valentine's Day cards, Mother's or Father's Day presents, Easter eggs and all the other commercial nonsense thrown at us. My friends say I'm just a tightwad who doesn't know the meaning of the word \"generosity\". Who's right?"
