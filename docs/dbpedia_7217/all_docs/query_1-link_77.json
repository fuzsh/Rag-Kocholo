        "text": "If Jersey was dubbed ‘the honeymoon island’ back in the 1950s for the bright young things who wed at Chelsea Town Hall and then skimmed across the sea, then Alderney should be the equivalent in the 2020s. It’s a low-profile Channel Island within touching distance of France, where the summer stretches out like a wobbly mirage, only melting into a mild winter at the very last opportunity. Smaller than Jersey, it draws in travellers looking for something truly genuine and timeless. For an island with fewer pubs than your hands have digits it’s got a couple of cute hotels. There’s Braye Beach Hotel, situated on a spectacular sandy stretch, where upstairs the best rooms have breezy balconies and downstairs there’s a new, upbeat steakhouse and cocktail bar called The Vaults (Oscar makes a mean Mojito).\n\nBook your stay at Braye Beach Hotel\n\nOf those handful of pubs, some have rooms, the best being The Georgian House. It’s adored by locals, and if you’re not dancing in the garden to a sea shanty, pint of cider in hand, by 10pm then something has gone terribly wrong. A lot of what’s to do centres around the sea: cliff-jumping, volleyball on the beach, rock-pooling for winkles and samphire, ear-wigging live music from pizza joint The Moorings with bare feet buried into the warm sand. At night, hunt for clouds of glow worms in the dark water, zapping about like fireworks. The really fun part, though, is the journey in and out: flying in on a beaten-up 12-seater plane is just as exhilarating as zipping over the Maldives, and if the weather is fine the sapphire blue is just as blue and the diamond specks just as phenomenal-looking.\n\nBook your stay at The Georgian House\n\nAnother recent opening is The Blonde Hedgehog, named after the distinctive pale hedgehogs that are often spotted after-dark. Nina rooms are spread across two neighbouring townhouses in the pretty, cobblestoned main town of St Anne.\n\nBook your stay at The Blonde Hedgehog\n\nHelicoptering into an archipelago might seem a little far-fetched right now, but it doesn’t have to be. Neither does the idea of chalk-white empty beaches, discovering secret coves, visiting clapboard crab shacks or pottering around a miniscule island without a car in sight. All of these delights can be found in the Scillies (and yes, it’s a honeymoon, why not chopper in?). Of the 140-odd isles that make up this destination off the Cornish coast, just five are inhabited, which means that a 10- to 14-day trip is enough time to hop around and get a feel for each. Although you will arrive (by boat or plane) to the main island St Mary’s, where there are a handful of cars, the residents here are experts at slow living and this laidback attitude will sink into your hurried soul like warm honey. Stay at the Star Castle hotel – it’s elevated, so gives a pretty view across the harbour. St Martin’s is the island where some of those elusive, desolate beaches can be found – ribbons of sand broken up by jaunty, paint-chipped sailing boats. Snorkel and swim before cycling to Holly and James’s vineyard for wine-tasting and cloudy apple juice.\n\nBook your stay at Star Castle hotel\n\nNext up is the smallest island, Bryher, at a petite one and a half miles long it often feels exposed – keep an eye out for puffins bracing themselves against the gale. It’s got one of the area's loveliest hotels to retreat to though, Hell Bay, a charming New England-style house with terraces that flood with sunlight streaming across the Atlantic. If short on time and it’s a decision between the final islands, Tresco and St Agnes, both are wildly different. St Agnes is as remote as it gets and is much more of a campsite affair, where cooking fresh lobster from an honesty box is supper, but if romance to you is about staying in a groomed apartment with waterfront brasseries serving chilli and lemongrass crab linguine (The Ruin beach café), then Tresco is the one.\n\nRead our ultimate travel guide to the Isles of Scilly\n\nEdinburgh may not spring to mind for a minimoon, but that would be to ignore its sensational spirit and its small footprint bursting with things to do and places to stay (from the plush big-hitters to the tough-to-find B&Bs). Remembering as well that the galleries, smart dining scene, museums and shopping can all be mixed in with blustery hilltop hikes and countryside pints. Plus, there’s something exciting coming this autumn, a townhouse hotel, the little sister to sporting estate Gleneagles. Housed in the former Bank of Scotland, it’s likely to become the sort of urban pad where, like moths to a flame, high-earning creatives will gather to cement deals and couples will come to exclaim over the extraordinary roof terrace. If planning an earlier escape, choose either The Balmoral (for old-school glitz) or The Dunstane Houses (grown-up yet still cool).\n\nBook your stay at Dunstane Houses\n\nAfter a couple of nights head an hour north to the legendary Gleneagles, voted the best hotel in the UK at the Condé Nast Traveller 2020 Readers’ Choice Awards. This legendary place often feels like it has a split personality between night and day: morning sees the wholesome, Barbours-on, scuffed-wellies brigade but this jolly vibe slowly morphs and is replaced by sheer gracefulness by 7pm. The white-clothed tables in the Strathearn restaurant glint with silver and walnut-coloured trolleys glide silently around, their steaming plates covered under polished cloches. Eat here in the summer and the light is hauntingly beautiful, the hazy evening sun eventually dimming and notching up the soft pools of candlelight scattered around the room.\n\nBook your stay at Gleneagles\n\nPre-pandemic, there may have been a slight lethargy towards the upmarket hotels found in Mayfair, Soho and Chelsea. A kind of tiring of classic luxury, with travellers seeking out experience over a clutch of five stars. But now there’s a returning lust for these grande dames and the cosseting they so exquisitely excel at. There couldn’t be a better antidote to staring at the same four magnolia walls of home than checking in at The Lanesborough. A riot of scaled-up Regency splendour saturated in colour, it’s an injection of glee for the post-lockdown soul.\n\nBook your stay at The Lanesborough\n\nThe Dorchester is still reassuringly robust, remaining a stalwart for the A-list and, thanks to new energy from super-young chef Tom Booton, now serving the best Scotch eggs and lobster tarts in town.\n\nBook your stay at The Dorchester\n\nBut Claridge’s sneaks in, in its quiet, elegant way, as top of the spoiling pile. A hotel that never seems to have to try, yet for more than 100 years has remained current; a vodka Martini in the Fumoir Bar has been the most glamorous thing to do in the city since 1929.\n\nBook your stay at Claridge's\n\nThere are some new kids on the block though, not placed to rival the dames, but there to zhuzh up the central-London scene. The Mayfair Townhouse in Green Park sets its sparkly, quirky mood on entry with a human-size peacock sculpture covered in thousands of Swarovski crystals (and minibars in rooms are free – a very nice touch).\n\nBook your stay at The Mayfair Townhouse\n\nThe Nomad in Covent Garden is tipped to be the new Ned (by the same group), and this summer country house Beaverbrook – a proud Surrey legend – opens its first city outpost in Chelsea, which promises to be a close-knit, Georgian affair with a dollop of theatre (the rooms are named after London stages).\n\nBook your stay at Beaverbrook\n\nFind out more about the best new townhouses in the UK\n\nAh, the Cotswolds. It’s safe to say that it’s a minimoon magnet, due to its smart boutique hotels, unstuffy take on manor houses and cottage owners who know that style involves much more than a duck-egg-blue coat of paint. When it comes to those hotels, there’s a clutch that really stand out, all within an hour’s drive of one another – these types of places tend to orbit around a handful of terrifically chic villages such as Burford, Kingham and Broadway. The Farncombe Estate sits on the fringes of the latter and cradles three properties in its manicured pastures: Dormy House, a snazzy country-house hotel so perfectly pitched guests are rebooking at breakfast; Foxhill Manor the eight-bedroom little sister, which is more relaxed with a do-as-you-please policy; and The Fish, best described as a stripped-back, more affordable Dormy, with the addition of a clutch of hillside huts and treehouses.\n\nFind more of our favourite hotels in the Cotswolds\n\nVenture half an hour to Kingham and Carole Bamford’s The Wild Rabbit is an upscale pub-with-rooms with food that speaks to the showy side of things – don’t expect hearty pub grub. Another 20-minute drive south is the village of Southrop, which has been transformed by Thyme, a passion project from owner Caryn Hibbert. In 2002 she set about restoring a set of honey-stone historic buildings, starting with a cookery school. It’s now a veritable hamlet: cottages, hotel rooms, farm, restaurant, pub, spa… Go for the English Rose room in The Lodge, it’s got fabulous pink walls, gold mirrors and a gilded drinks trolley. The pool may be outside but don’t let that put you off, it’s bath-warm even in the depths of winter.\n\nBook your stay at Thyme\n\nThey say romance is subjective, but it would be very difficult to challenge the allure of the Scottish Highlands. The cloud-wreathed peaks, the slopes pocked with dense moss, khaki-green grassy plains, reeds swaying by misty, empty lochs – it’s the emptiness, in fact, that does it. Empty, yet at the same time deeply atmospheric. What could be better than a lodge made for two in the midst of all this beauty? 57 Nord opened in 2019 and is the antithesis of the average Scottish bothy that can be found in these parts. It’s light, airy, supremely modern, with more than a hint of Scandi, and so clean-cut design-wise that it slices through the wildness of the landscape like a smooth blade. All sharp lines and acres of glass, white ceramics and subtle grey mottled marble, topped off with a steel roof. For something more (seemingly) traditional, The Fife Arms, set at the foot of the craggy Cairngorm mountains is, at first sight, a Scottish hunting lodge revamped. But look closer and the real excitement is all in spotting the unique details, such as the electric-blue blown glass chandelier in the lobby and the original watercolour painting by Queen Victoria (it’s tucked away behind the door as you enter). It’s like a contemporary art gallery and hotel all rolled into one deliciously curated package.\n\nBook your stay at The Fife Arms\n\nRead the full review of The Fife Arms\n\nBabbacombe Bay in Torquay, where they ring a bell when dolphins come to visit, has one of those breakneck hills leading down to it that feels like a stage of the Tour de France. Three quarters of the way down sits The Cary Arms, a gloriously nautical pub that delivers so much more than just a cracking Sunday lunch that locals travel miles for. The rooms in the main building are nice enough in a creaky inn way, but the latest additions, six white and royal-blue, glass-fronted beach huts, were built purely for couples on a rocky outcrop below the small spa. Each has a porthole window in the peak of the roof, the kind that needs long arms and a wooden stick (provided) to close the solid shutters. But it’s intentional – the beds are on a mezzanine and the view when sitting up is as crisp and spherical as a telescope out onto the sea, often punctuated by fishing boats gliding through the circle. Make sure to have a snack or supper here at least once – it’s comfort dishes with a dash of English riviera; Otter ale pies by the fire in winter and pints of prawns and Salcombe gin Negronis outdoors in summer. One evening take the steep walk up the slope and turn left into Princes street for award-winning fish and chips at Hanbury’s. Eating in is fine, but best to take away and sit on the benches on the promenade – with the Narnia-style lamps gently dappling light down the cliff, it’s heart-wrenchingly nostalgic.\n\nBook your stay at The Cary Arms\n\nWhen a whole county has been known as ‘the garden of England’ for hundreds of years, there are bound to be some pretty jaw-dropping nature spots to be found within it. Elmley Nature Reserve is one of those places. It’s a destination where waking up feels like a total privilege (that’s because it is – roughly 38 people can stay on the whole 3,200-acre site at a time), where a cup of morning coffee has a backdrop that consists of miles of savannah-like marshland and enormous flocks of wildfowl swirling through a soft-pink dawn sky. It gives that pinch-me feeling of being on safari. Located on the Isle of Sheppey just over an hour from London, this fiercely protected piece of land is, unlike many nature reserves in the UK, family-owned, and the Fultons have cleverly diversified the wetlands with a smattering of chic places to stay hidden among the rushes. From teeny cabins with cast-iron radiators, soft wool throws and outdoor showers (Damson has an outdoor bathtub) to dinky but delightful Shepherd’s huts, most of the hideouts are geared towards getting couples to switch off from normal life, and on to each other.\n\nBook your stay\n\nFind out more about cosy cabins you can rent across the UK\n\nIt’s happened so quickly that it’s taken some residents by surprise, but the hamlet of Bruton (and other towns that touch its sides, such as Frome) has become somewhat of a destination for the artsy elite. What started with a world-class gallery on the outskirts of the village (Hauser & Wirth back in 2014) has snowballed into a collection of Japanese- and Scandi-influenced shops, considered places to eat and curated wine bars. And at the heart of all this, just outside of Bruton itself, sits The Newt – a landmark that has probably surprised even itself with how popular it has become less than two years since its launch. But the owners shouldn’t be surprised – they had already achieved this sort of stardom once, back in South Africa with winery and farmstead Babylonstoren. This hulking UK project (hotel, cyder farm, spa, museum, multiple restaurants, a garden drawing in day-trippers) has a very similar sprawling, kick-back, all-welcome feel to it. It’s high-end but utterly unpretentious, a very difficult quality to engineer. New in 2021 is The Farmyard, tucked away in a quiet corner of the land accessed through the cyder orchards, which makes holing up on the estate as a twosome even more attractive.\n\nBook your stay at The Newt\n\nAnother more recent opening in the area is Number One Bruton, a sensitively converted Georgian townhouse and a much welcome add-on to restaurant Osip by Merlin Labron-Johnson, one of the youngest British chefs (at 24) to be awarded a Michelin star. This once burgeoning rural corner of England seems to be reaching a crescendo – now is the time to check it out.\n\nLately the phrase off-grid when used in relation to travel has become a tad clichéd, a stock line to describe some far-flung, fantastical island. But this Hansel and Gretel-style cottage is exactly that – it’s got no grid to speak of, it’s entirely electricity free. It’s set in its own wildflower meadow on the Wilderness reserve estate, and its exterior of red bricks, gnarly tree-trunk pillars, thick thatched roof and vivid turquoise-painted door gives a joyful hint of the fun and romance inside. Large storm lamps, pillar candles and a flickering hearth light the way to a cosy, whimsical interior with working antiques (a whistling kettle), gingham curtains next to clouds of deep-red and dusky pink roses and an Esse range cooker heating hot water. The kitchen also has an original bread oven and a butler sink, and there’s a help-yourself herb garden outside and a pair of Pashley bikes propped up against the back door. The lack of artificial light really conjures an intimacy that’s hard to find elsewhere, and makes simple things such as reading or taking a board game off the shelf seem brand new. Although it’s easy to stay put on the reserve and have the Wilderness team bring more firewood, buckets of ice for wine and charcuterie platters, the Suffolk surroundings should be snooped around. There’s the gorgeously retro Pier and golden sands at Southwold, art galleries and music festivals in coastal town Aldeburgh or gin-making at Adnams brewery nearby.\n\nBook your stay at Hex Cottage\n\nIt’s no secret that Cornwall has an incredible food scene, and even the most rookie eater has heard of the Dover sole at Rick Stein’s and the hand-dived scallops at Paul Ainsworth’s. But in the past five years a new wave of restaurants has opened, putting down roots that aren’t quite as glossy as the eponymous brasseries. They tend to be headed up by chefs who became fed up with London’s flashy lifestyle, wanting something a little more grounding. Weaving a couple of these treasures into a trip should be a top priority. To start, make a 24-hour stop at Coombeshead Farm, an informal B&B sandwiched between Dartmoor and Bodmin moor. It’s the brainchild of Tom Adams and April Bloomfield and their ultimate goal is to be entirely self-sufficient, with everything on the plate picked, washed and pretty much served there and then (or, like the Mangalitsa bacon, coming from their own animals). There’s not a whiff of fuss in sight but the dishes are assured and inventive. Home-churned butter graces the finest sourdough like cake frosting, the lavender and bergamot soup is a dream, sides to pork or lamb might be bronzed fennel or nettle kraut and there’s honeycomb from the bees for breakfast. Fill the car with loaves and pickles and head to Fitzroy in Fowey for lunch (plump mussels and natural wines) before nipping up to the north coast and checking in at recently opened The Pig at Harlyn Bay (with a similar farm-to-fork ethos). Just next door in Padstow there’s also Prawn on the Lawn, a fishmongers with a small café, run by Londoners Katie and Rick and serving mind-blowingly fresh seafood rolls. A great opportunity to champion the latest rising stars.\n\nBook your stay at The Pig at Harlyn Bay\n\nSometimes a hotel is a destination in and of itself, and Adare Manor in Ireland is a fine example of this. This castle/manor house is so gargantuan, both in its size and status, that it gracefully looms over its nearby thatched village (Adare). There are a couple of firsts that set it apart from competitors: La Mer opened its first British Isles spa here and, most recently, The Oak Room became the first Michelin-starred restaurant in the county, where head chef Michael Tweedie works wonders with local ingredients and tarts up Irish classics – his five-spice Thornhill duck has rave reviews. Sommeliers Jonathan and Farrah are absolutely on point too; the beef is best paired with a rich glass of Amarone red. On top of these well-earned credentials, the property sees more than 100 engagement proposals a year from couples the world over (the crowd is so mixed it’s impossible to pinpoint), so it’s fair to say there must be something quite spellbinding about it. Interiors are exceedingly fairy tale: yawning, gothic-style window arches, silk-damask drapery, glittering chandeliers. It’s hard to pick a dud room, but the larger ones are so over-the-top fancy it’s almost a tad overwhelming – a smaller one, both in space and pared-back taste, is our pick.\n\nBook your stay at Adare Manor\n\nThis stone building really does resemble a burrow with its neat carpet of grass gently sloping across the roof and the slender black chimney puffing away. It’s buried into the Bleddfa hills of Powys, an area of Wales where the scenery is softer and more rolling than the jagged Snowdonia mountains. The Burrow is situated on a farm named Dolassey where owners Tom and Amy live, but the land is vast and it’s unlikely you’ll bump into them. The only sounds are the bleating of nosy sheep and the tumbling of water. Although it’s designed for two, it’s spacious; there’s an open-plan living area with bifold doors onto the terrace, a shiny copper bath next to the king-size bed and a double shower in a separate bathroom. The aesthetic is minimal and sophisticated but there are splashes of colour and fun too: dining chairs look like the Sixties school stacking variety, with bright red and blue spindly legs, and there’s a jug bursting with wildflowers next to the little wire welcome hamper. Come dusk, cook on the fire pit outside (or order a ploughman's basket from The Little Welsh Kitchen, which will deliver straight to the door) before jumping into the hot tub for nightfall. The stars scatter across the sky here like a never-ending sheet of sequins, and sometimes the Milky Way is visible.\n\nBook your stay at The Burrow\n\nAs sought-after glamping ventures such as Fforest become ever more crowded (particularly once the post-vaccine boom takes hold this summer) savvy travellers should shift their focus to the new, low-density patches popping up. Unlike other larger sites, The Private Hill in Yorkshire has just four eye-catching domes to stay in, one being set apart a little, so it can deliver the seclusion that a trip like this demands. What’s pleasing is the type of people who stay here clearly aren’t in it for the Insta-points. It’s only had a sprinkling of bookings so far; mostly young, flushed-cheeked locals looking for an understated but memorable way to pop the question, or older couples in weathered camping gear celebrating Ruby anniversaries. Each polar-insulated structure has everything expected in a hotel room rather than a tent: full-size shower, flushing loo and wardrobe, and these practicalities are all layered up nicely with sheepskin throws, battered leather armchairs, patchwork rugs and one giant bed cocooned in Egyptian cotton. Cheery Becci or Jo might already have lit the woodburner before check-in, which is a sweet touch. If the evening weather is balmy, they offer up homely dishes served on your private decking: goat’s cheese tart, steak and apple crumble under a blanket of stars – all for £35 a head.\n\nBook your stay at The Private Hill\n\nRead more about the best places to go camping in the UK this summer\n\nThe Norfolk Coast Path is where in-the-know visitors come in hushed droves. Devotees tend to swerve Devon and Cornwall, favouring cycling or walking the trails here, as they are a shade less touristy and a notch more varied. Wade through immense shifting sand dunes (great shelter for picnics), skip over tidal creeks, scrunch along shingle beaches and stop off at seaside villages such as Titchwell, away from the main thrum (not forgetting the whipping amber gorse of the often-deserted marshes at Cley and Salthouse). Around five miles away is a little-known rental, its ancient flint walls, heavy oak beams and eccentric curiosities contrasting beautifully with a slick high-spec kitchen and Aesop products. The floor consists of hand-made Norfolk tiles called pamments, the method used to create the clay has been around for centuries and it means no two squares in the blush-pink palette are the same. Yet running underneath is seamless underfloor heating – a perfect example of the thought that has gone into renovating this former gardener’s cottage (it took two years to get everything just so). The sunken concrete bath made with two people in mind is another winning detail. After a soak, take a wander up the road to The Hunworth Bell for a posh burger (Holkham-bred beef, Emmental cheese, brioche bun, skinny fries) and Norwich-brewed beer before stumbling back to a soundtrack of owls hooting.\n\nLike this?
