        "text": "As Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate and aunt to a future king of England, ties the knot with James Matthews this weekend, we take a look at the honeymoon hotels and destinations of the Royal Family.\n\nBy Sherelle Jacobs and Jade Conroy\n\n• Pippa Middleton honeymoon hotel: a guide to the contenders\n\nThe Seychelles held a special place in the couple’s hearts – it was were they went on holiday in 2007, shortly after getting back together after a break-up. The private island has just 11 villas, each with private plunge pools and direct access to the beach. Guests arrive and leave by helicopter.\n\nRead the full review: North Island, Seychelles\n\n• The most romantic hotels in the Seychelles\n\nMore than 750-million viewers tuned in to see Prince Charles and the then Lady Diana Spencer tie the knot in July 1981. They began their three-month honeymoon at the Mountbatten estate of Broadlands . . .\n\n10 best Scottish castle hotels\n\nTheir stay in Scotland was then followed by a 12-day cruise through the Greek Islands to Egypt on the Royal Yacht Britannia. At the time, it was a much more casual trip compared for previous Royal honeymoons, as the plans were made daily rather than a set route.\n\n• The best Greek Islands hotels\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's marriage to Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey in November 1947 was broadcast by BBC Radio to an estimated 200-million listeners around the world. The bride is reported to have done her own makeup and purchased the material for her dress with ration vouchers – though it was still sufficiently lavish with floral lacing, 10,000 pearl appliques and a 13ft silk train. Her diamond tiara snapped while she was getting ready at Buckingham Palace; a police escort hurried the court jeweller back to his workshop to fix it in time.\n\n• The Queen's favourite hotels\n\nThe Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh spent the first part of their honeymoon at Broadlands House in Hampshire (pictured), owned by the Duke's uncle, Lord Mountbatten. They slept in a 18th-century lodge hugged by thick woodland and spent their days stalking deer. The newly-weds then travelled on to Birkhall Lodge, part of the Balmoral estate.\n\n• The royal family's favourite hotels\n\nPrince Albert, Duke of York – who would later become King George VI when his brother abdicated – wed Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon – the late Queen Mother – at Westminster Abbey in April 1923. On her way in, Elizabeth laid her bouquet at the Tomb of The Unknown Warrior to honour her brother Fergus, whose body was never recovered from the Battle of Loos in 1915. She wore a Coco Chanel-inspired gown embroidered with silver.\n\n• The world's best palace hotels\n\nThe pair honeymooned at Polesden Lacey, a Surrey country manor house owned by their friend, aristocratic socialite Mrs Ronald Greville. It was appropriately sumptuous, with interiors designed by Ritz architects, walls lined with portraits by Dutch 17th-century painters and cabinets stuffed with Meissen porcelain. They spent much of their time playing golf and tennis and taking long walks. The two royals later visited the bride's home, Glamis Castle in Scotland. Unfortunately, heavy rain and snow caused Elizabeth to come down with whooping cough, something she later described as 'not a very romantic disease'.\n\n• The best country house hotels in Britain\n\nWhen Princess Margaret married Antony Armstrong-Jones at Westminster Abbey in May 1960, it was the first royal wedding to be broadcast on television, with more than 20-million viewers tuning in. Screens were set up throughout the cathedral so that guests at the back could see the ceremony, and loud speakers blared out the service to crowds lingering outside. The bride's minimalist silk-organza frock designed by Dressmaker to the Queen Norman Hartnell was described as 'stunningly tailored' by Vogue and the 'simplest royal wedding gown in history' by Life magazine.\n\n• The greatest hotels in the world\n\nRight after a champagne breakfast reception at Buckingham Palace, Margaret and her new husband embarked on a six-week honeymoon across the Caribbean on the Royal Yacht Britannia, visiting islands like Trinidad, Antigua and Mustique. The princess spent most of her time in the Royal Apartments and they ate dinners formally, in full evening attire. The two returned looking 'extremely bronzed', Illustrated London News wrote at the time.\n\n• The best hotels for wedding venues in Britain\n\nThe honeymoon following the Prince of Wales’ second wedding, to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, wasn’t dissimilar to his first. The wedding took place in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall in April 2009. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh did not attend the ceremony but were present at the blessing, held at Windsor Castle, afterwards.\n\n• The best Scottish castle hotels\n\nThe honeymoon began at Birkhall, at the Balmoral estate in Scotland (pictured), and was followed by a cruise around the Greek Islands. The couple reportedly toured the islands on a yacht owned by billionaire tycoon, Spiros Latsis.\n\n• The best beach hotels in the Greek Islands\n\nQueen Victoria married Prince Albert at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace in February 1840 – royal weddings at Westminster Abbey weren't a thing until one of her granddaughters, Patricia, married there in 1919. The Queen of England wore a crown of orange blossoms and her decision to go for a white dress was unusual for the time; it was made of silk was spun at Spitalfields and flamboyant lace she would re-use several times. Remnants of the cake, covered with pure white sugar and decorated with the effigy of a dog to represent loyalty, survives to this day; a slice recently fetched at auction for £1,500.\n\n• Europe's best hotels for wedding venues\n\nTheir honeymoon only lasted three days, and because of Victoria's many duties, they had to stay at Windsor Castle. The Queen also raised eyebrows for holding several impromptu balls during the honeymoon, which was considered inappropriate by the aristocracy. The bride doesn't seem to have been bothered – she later described the 'break' as 'most gratifying'.\n\nThe best Isle of Wight hotels\n\nKing Edward VII's marriage to American divorcee Wallis Simpson after he abdicated from the throne in 1936 was shrouded in secrecy. They wed at Château de Candé just outside Tours in France. Less than 20 guests attended, and there were poignant rows of empty chairs in the back of the library where they exchanged vows. No official photographer was present; the best man's wife took some snaps which were not released to the public until 80 years later. However, the couple reportedly received 6,000 telegrams from fans on the happy day.\n\n• The most romantic hotels in Paris\n\nThe pair honeymooned at Schloss Wasserleonburg in Austria. In a letter, Wallis Simpson described it as 'really lovely and peaceful - we hope here to gather strength for future battles.' Today it is a country house hotel clad in spruces and firs, popular for romantic overnight stays and weddings – think Florentine fountains, a Baroque chapel and cosy wooden cottages.\n\nCheck availabity\n\n• The best spa hotels in the south of England\n\nThe island break was followed by a five-day cruise around the Atlantic on the Royal Yacht Britannia, during which the couple visited remote islands, some of which were only accessible by rubber dinghy.\n\n• The world's most romantic hotels\n\nPrince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones married in June 1999 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. It was not a state ceremony, in accordance with the couple's wishes, and Prime Minister Tony Blair, who had not been invited, was conspicuously absent. Sophie made headlines with her Samatha Shaw dress made from hand-dyed silk organza, encrusted with pearls and crystal beads. For the first time in royal wedding history, the children that carried her train were all 'commoners'.\n\n• The best New Forest hotels\n\nThere was heated media speculation about what exotic lands the couple would visit on their honeymoon. Royal-family watchers were a tad disappointed when they chose Scotland – and Birkhall Lodge where the Queen had honeymooned. They did get an unexpected bout of glorious weather, however, prompting them to extend their stay.\n\n• The best castle hotels in Scotland"
