        "text": "Where to go on Honeymoon in April\n\nApril is a fabulous month for a wedding. There’s a spring in everyone’s step as the days get longer and the promise of summer is in the air. It’s a wonderful time to be in the Mediterranean, and it’s low season in the Caribbean but with superb weather.\n\nFor details of prices and booking terms, click on the links below to individual tour operators. Remember that prices tend to be inflated during the Easter holidays. In 2025, Easter Sunday falls late on 20 April.\n\nQuick links\n\nMediterranean – Short haul – Europe cities – Caribbean – America – Indian Ocean – Africa – Asia – South America – More long haul\n\nMediterranean Honeymoons in April\n\nThis is a wonderful time to be in the Mediterranean as you can expect long sunny days, uncrowded resorts and rested locals gearing up for the summer season. Hillsides will be carpeted in wild flowers and beaches will be empty.\n\nCyprus is a long way south with 24ºC temperatures and 9 hours of sun, along with hills carpeted in wild flowers and not so many other tourists. At this time of year you’ll find tempting hotel and apartment offers.\n\nThe French island of Corsica tends to be unfairly overlooked by honeymooners. In fact, it has beautiful beaches, wonderful restaurants and rugged countryside where you can take long romantic walks amongst the spring flowers. Check out this collection of Romantic Retreats which includes hotels, villas and apartments.\n\nFew Greek islands are more romantic than Santorini (20°C, 8 hours of sun), a black volcanic caldera with stunning white-cube boutique hotels carved into sheer rock faces. My favourite places to stay include Hotel Grace and these hideaway houses for two.\n\nIn Italy you will have the resorts to yourselves, as the locals wait until August for their summer break. For the best beaches head to the island of Sardinia and fabulous hotels like the five-star adult-only Hotel La Villa del Re. If spa and wellness is your thing, try the Hotel Capo d’Orso Thalasso & Spa.\n\nTurkey is a great honeymoon choice and far enough south to ensure temperatures in the low 20s and 9 hours of daily sunshine (compared with 13°C and 5 hours of sunshine in London). If you fancy somewhere quiet, head to the Mandarin Boutique Hotel, a romantic adults-only hideaway with just 8 rooms set in remote countryside. It’s well-priced with four-poster beds and Jacuzzis for two.\n\nMorocco, Madeira, Egypt\n\nMorocco is just three hours flying time from the UK. Marrakech has temperatures of 24°C with 9 hours of sun, perfect for sightseeing. If you’re on a budget, try this 7-night Morocco Honeymoon which includes a riad in Marrakech, hot air balloon flight, a luxury desert camp and a stay in the Atlas Mountains. For five-star treatment, stay at Sir Richard Branson’s Kasbah Tamadot.\n\nYou could fly four hours to Madeira (19ºC, 6 hours of sun) and stay in a historic country house (quinta), a great choice if you enjoy fine dining and gorgeous walks. Find out more about honeymoons in Madeira.\n\nIt’s five hours flying time to Egypt, where the weather will be stunning. I recommend a few days in Cairo (29°C temperatures and 9 hours of sunshine) combined with a Nile cruise. If you want warm sea and sunbathing, head to Sharm el-Sheikh or Hurghada. Check out these honeymoon ideas in Egypt.\n\nEuropean cities\n\nAnother option is to honeymoon in a European city. April in Paris is so perfect, they wrote a song about it. Arrive in style on First Class Eurostar and stay in a chic boutique hotel such as the Pavillon de la Reine just off the Place des Vosges, or the beautiful Relais Christine hidden away on the Left Bank.\n\nOr make tracks to Andalucia to tour three of Spain’s greatest cities. Stay at Las Casas Del Rey de Baeza in Seville, the chic Hospes Palacio del Bailio in Cordoba and the charming Hospes Palacio de los Patos in Granada. Expect temperatures of 23°C and 8 hours of sun.\n\nHow about combining the Italian cities of Florence, Rome and Siena. And of course there is Venice which is wonderful in April and has a wide range of hotels – some magnificent, others not so great. I particularly like the five-star deluxe Ca’ Sagrado, which has just 42 rooms and overlooks the Grand Canal.\n\nThe Caribbean\n\nIn the Caribbean the weather will be superb (30°C, 8 hours of sun) and once Easter passes you are in low season, so prices drop dramatically. Beach bums should consider the small coral island of Anguilla which boasts beautiful powder white sands, superb hotels and charming local restaurants. Best places to stay include Cap Juluca, the Four Seasons (I like the rooftop suites with private pools) and the Mediterranean-style Aurora Resort.\n\nIf you want a buzzing resort with an array of romantic touches and a choice of places to eat and things to do, you cannot beat Sandals which has superb beachfront locations across the Caribbean.\n\nYou can experience the thrill and romance of sailing on a tall ship exploring the small ports of the Caribbean with Star Clippers.\n\nIndian Ocean\n\nThe Seychelles in April will be enjoying 30°C temperatures, 8 hours of sunshine, low rainfall, calm seas and good underwater visibility. These islands are incredibly well geared up for honeymooners with romantic packages and a sophisticated set-up for weddings too if you want to tie the knot there. For barefoot luxury in the Seychelles, try Denis Private Island. Or indulge at the exquisite Four Seasons Resort Seychelles.\n\nIn the Maldives you can expect 32°C temperatures and 9 hours of sunshine, though humidity will be high. You can get some good deals if you go all-inclusive.\n\nIf you want all-out luxury, check out NIYAMA Maldives which has 87 studios and pavilions – most with a private pool – dotted across two gorgeous islands, plus an underwater nightclub and a chance to spend a night at sea with your own butler and private chef in a traditional sail boat.\n\nAfrica\n\nIn South Africa it’s the end of the hot season: explore Cape Town (22°C temperatures, 7 hours of sun) before heading to the Winelands. This 12-night Luxury Cape and Coast honeymoon is a great option, or push the boat out for the Ultimate Cape Town, Winelands and Kruger private tour. If you want to stay somewhere very special in the Winelands, take a look at Sir Richard Branson’s Mont Rochelle. Also consider combining South Africa and Mauritius.\n\nIn Namibia it’s the start of the dry season with temperatures around 25ºC with 9 hours of sun. You’ll be awe-struck by the wild desolate beauty of this country, where you can take a hot air balloon ride over vast swathes of desert, visit the Skeleton Coast, track the endangered Black Rhino, climb the world’s tallest sand dunes and gaze up at velvety night skies. Choose between a self-drive honeymoon and a classic fly-in honeymoon.\n\nBotswana is transitioning from the green season (occasional rain showers) into the popular dry season. The swollen waters of the Okavango Delta will be absolutely gorgeous. If you want real adventure, head to the Kalahari Desert.\n\nSee my pick of the best safari honeymoon lodges in Africa.\n\nAsia\n\nIndia is packed with natural and man-made wonders: it’s a country guaranteed to amaze and enchant you. Check into buzzing Mumbai (33°C, 10 hours of sun) before enjoying the gilded world of the Maharajas’ Express, one of the world’s greatest luxury train journeys.\n\nSri Lanka is a hot spot for honeymoons (and weddings) and although weather patterns vary, April should be reasonably dry and not too humid. In Colombo you can expect 32°C and 8 hours of sun.\n\nIf you are drawn to Asia, Vietnam is a good choice for April. This two-week Vietnam in Style private tour will take you to Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hoi An, Ho Chi Minh City and the idyllic islands of Con Dao.\n\nHow about travelling between Bangkok and Singapore on the Eastern & Oriental Express, a four-day luxury train journey that is the height of colonial-style opulence, with lots of fascinating side trips.\n\nSouth America\n\nSouth America is also a great choice for a honeymoon in April. In Brazil it’s turtle hatching season in the North-East, where you can swim with wild dolphins and relax on some of the world’s best beaches. Look forward to 27°C and 6 hours of sunshine in Rio. We recommend Dehouche, a small specialist company based in Brazil run by British expats. See their expert guide to South America honeymoons.\n\nOn the way to Brazil you’ll find the Cape Verde islands, an Atlantic archipelago with a fascinating cocktail of African, Brazilian and Portuguese influences. It’s a great value destination with sandy beaches and dramatic landscapes, and six-hour direct flights from the UK. Expect 10 hours of sunshine and 25ºC in April. See the latest offers.\n\nIn Argentina summer is over and all the vacationing Argentines have gone back to work, making it a good time to visit with lower prices. It’s cooler as autumn kicks in but still pleasant and great for sightseeing. Get a taste of what to expect.\n\nMore long haul ideas\n\nThis is a good time of year to fly down under. In Australia, you can enjoy the views on board The Ghan, a luxury train that runs across the Outback between Adelaide and Darwin with excursions including wine tasting in the Barossa Valley.\n\nTahiti is a South Pacific paradise with a French twist. You can take a cruise around the 200 gorgeous islands and atolls, or stay on The Brando, a sensational private island. Resort hotels include the Four Seasons Bora Bora and St Regis Bora Bora.\n\n>> Also see my pick of the best honeymoon destinations over Easter.\n\n>> See our sister site 101 Holidays for more expert ideas of where to go holiday in April, and where is hot in April in Europe.\n\nLast updated: 29 April 2024\n\nTry another month…\n\nJanuary, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December\n\nGet holiday deals sent to your inbox"
