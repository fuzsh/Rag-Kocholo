        "text": "Just days after revealing the identity of her mystery husband, Dr. Anand Tarpara, Anisha Ramakrishna is sharing more details about her life as a newlywed.\n\nThe Family Karma cast member tied the knot with the vascular surgeon on October 8, 2022, and because of their “busy schedules,” the pair didn’t have the ability to take a traditional honeymoon trip.\n\nInstead, as Anisha confirmed during an Amazon Live broadcast on February 27, she spent her first full weekend as a married woman at a surprising destination.\n\n“The week after I got married was BravoCon [2022],” Anisha said during the live stream about the three-day event, which took place from October 14 to 16. “So, I’d say my honeymoon was BravoCon!”\n\nThough Anisha spent her first post-wedding weekend on panels and with dozens of other Bravolebrities at BravoCon, she noted that she traveled a lot with her Arizona-based husband before they got married.\n\n“I have been to 11 countries with him in the year and a half we were dating, before we got married, so I don’t think we needed a honeymoon,” she added. “We’re geriatric millennials.”\n\nAfter she finished recording the live stream, Anisha took to Instagram to share photos from the aforementioned pre-wedding trips for the first time. In the caption of her post, Anisha shared why she advises couples to travel together before they decide to get engaged or married.\n\n“You know I advise taking at least three trips with your partner before making things permanent. I traveled the world with my husband before I got married,” she wrote. “It doesn’t matter where you go, but you should travel, even if it’s a road trip. It is important to see how compatible you actually are.”\n\nAfter traveling all around the world together, Anisha and Anand decided they were compatible. Now that they’ve tied the knot, the two are planning to celebrate their union with a big event this spring (only immediate family and “very close friends” were in attendance for their October wedding). Following their spring celebration, the spouses plan to continue traveling for the time being.\n\n“We’re flex on kids,” Anisha told People about her other plans for the future. “Thankfully, I froze my eggs, so I am not ready to have a child yet, if I’m going to be honest… I just want to enjoy this time traveling and doing things, just us, and maybe if I were to have one, it’s not going to be for another two years, like 2024.”"
