        "text": "July is peak summer in the UK and though there are a few more visitors about in many places in the world, it’s a little busier than usual for a reason: you get incredible weather and it’s one of the best times for going on safari. So, while you have a blissfully beautiful summer’s wedding, you can rest assured you’ll have a honeymoon in July drenched in sun, too.\n\nWhere should you honeymoon in summer? Head to Tanzania for a safari honeymoon you won’t forget, with the Great Migration, one of the world’s most incredible wildlife spectacles, in full flow. Mozambique makes for the ideal beach retreat following a thrilling time on safari, as does Zanzibar, while both the Maldives and Mauritius serves up plenty of warm and pleasant days. The Seychelles offers incredible beaches too, while the summer months are ideal for hiking in its wild interiors, too.\n\nThe South Pacific is one of the best honeymoon destinations in July, with The Islands of Tahiti, Fiji and the Cook Islands all fantastic options. If you fancy heading east, then Southeast Asia enjoys a great spell of weather in July, in particular the islands of Indonesia .\n\nMany people don’t consider the Caribbean because it’s tropical storm season but on the whole the islands are rarely troubled. Instead, visit St. Kitts & Nevis for festival season, Saint Lucia for its pure adventure and Antigua for its impressive range of hotels.\n\nOur specialists say the Cook Islands are the most romantic destination for a honeymoon in July. So tiny you’d struggle to pick them out on a map, the 15 islands of the Cook Islands are like little droplets of heaven for a honeymoon in July. Rarotonga is an isle that looks like something out of Jurassic Park, its lush volcanic mountains making for a delightfully wild interior, while its charming locals give the Cooks incredible character. Elsewhere, Aitutaki offers that secluded beach escape you’ll be craving, with secret sands and azure lagoons so beautiful you’ll think you’ve been dropped in paradise.\n\nHoliday type: Dream Honeymoon\n\nWhy visit in July?\n\nIt’s the dry season in the Cook Islands, so you’ll get fantastic weather.\n\nIt’s not as hot and humid as the rainy season, so the weather will be cool enough to explore Rarotonga’s wild interior but warm enough to relax on the beach.\n\nRarotonga will be looking its lush best after a full rainy season.\n\nMore about honeymooning in the Cook Islands."
