If you’re looking to go international, here are the best honeymoon destinations around the world!\n\nHere are the best honeymoon destinations in the United States (by month)!\n\nBest USA Honeymoon Destinations in January\n\nPlanning to honeymoon in January?\n\nWhile much of the country bundles up for a cold spell, you can still have a tropical getaway in the winter…\n\nWaipi'o Valley Lookout on the Big Island of Hawaii\n\nHawaii\n\nOf course! Any serious list of the best honeymoon destinations in the USA has got to begin with the Aloha State. Easily one of the most beautiful honeymoon places in the world, these magical islands tick all the boxes for a romantic escape.\n\nNot sure where to get started? Grab your new partner in crime and go through my guide to which Hawaiian islands to travel to narrow down your options.\n\nIn all honesty, it’s hard to go wrong with any of the Hawaiian islands, so whether you want to island-hop or stick to one — the world (or Hawaii, in this case), is your oyster. That said, I would definitely consider Maui as a top contender.\n\nMake sure to check out my Maui travel guide as you plan and definitely check out some of the hidden gems in Maui to find a quiet place for two in the island paradise.\n\nAs a serious bonus, there are countless top-notch local Hawaiian dishes there that you can’t find anywhere else.\n\nBest USA Honeymoon Destinations in February\n\nLike January, you’ll have to figure out if you want a tropical honeymoon with your love or if you’d prefer something cooler.\n\nNot sure what costs to consider? Here’s how to budget for your honeymoon!\n\nCamden, Maine\n\nCamden, Maine\n\nWelcome to one of the United State’s most underrated winter destinations! If you’re looking for a ski honeymoon, look no further.\n\nThe Camden Snow Bowl is about 4.5 miles from Penobscot Bay, located on Ragged Mountain. It features a 400-foot toboggan run…which, fun fact: the U.S. National Toboggan Championships are hosted here every year!\n\nThis is the only place in the country where you can look over the Atlantic Ocean while skiing down the slopes.\n\nWhile it’s a fantastic destination to hit the slopes, the harbor is equally as enchanting for a stroll at twilight. Pack cozy sweaters, and explore the best things to do on the Maine Coast during February.\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nYou’ve just tied the knot, so why not celebrate! If you’re looking for a party, there is nowhere like New Orleans during Mardi Gras. Fuel up with the world-famous coffee from Café du Monde, find your favorite ​​Krewe in the parade, and party with carnival lovers around the globe.\n\nWhile it can be a crazy time, it’s a true bucket list experience. Check out my guide to Mardi Gras for beginners to get ready for this epic adventure.\n\nBecause it has such a dynamic blend of cultural influences, New Orleans is unlike anywhere else in the United States; you’ve got jazz shows, Vodou tours, swamp excursions, Cajun cooking classes, and more!\n\nTreat yourself to beignets on beignets and all the eclectic charm of this magical city.\n\nNew Orleans makes an ideal honeymoon for those who love history and good eats. And the best part is if you want to party it up—you absolutely can!\n\nSpend 4-days in New Orleans strolling the cobblestone streets of the French Quarter, taking in all the gorgeous mansions of the Garden District, and sampling all the foodie delights!\n\nLooking for something a bit more relaxed? New Orleans is a different world during December and January. Explore the beauty of the city, without the crowd or intense heat.\n\nSt. Augustine, Florida\n\nSt. Augustine, Florida\n\nOn the northeast coast of Florida, you’ll find the oldest city in the US. One of my favorite lesser-known weekend getaways in the United States, this is one of those unique American cities with a European flair.\n\nFor the couple that love history, beach days, and Southern treats (namely butter pecan milkshakes), you’ll be dazzled by St. Augustine.\n\nWander the cobblestone streets, soak in the European colonial architecture, explore Anastasia State Park, then hit up the beach.\n\nThis Florida city has held onto so much of its Spanish heritage and style, that you’ll essentially get a 2-for-1 — you get to explore Florida…and feel like you’ve been transported to Spain all in one!\n\nBest USA Honeymoon Destinations in March\n\nEntering spring, choosing the best honeymoon destinations by month is a real challenge. So many places are at their absolute prime and things begin to warm up and flowers are in bloom, it’s the perfect time to book your US honeymoon.\n\nSavannah, Georgia\n\nSavannah, Georgia\n\nThis Georgian peach was made for spring honeymoons. Wander amongst the Spanish moss and taste your way through town until you find your favorite Southern-fried delights— try some of Savannah’s best restaurants and find your fave!\n\nThis beautiful city is packed with historic gems so be sure to read up on the best things to do in Savannah before you go to.\n\nThe whimsical natural beauty combined with that good old-fashioned Southern hospitality makes this a prime place to discover together. There’s something about the Spanish Moss that feels eerily romantic, and Savannah is a dream destination.\n\nHere’s how to spend three days in Savannah!\n\nIf you want to extend your honeymoon, Charleston is about a 2-3 hour drive from Savannah and makes an excellent complement.\n\nFor a real treat, book a stay at Montage Palmetto Bluff, which is partway between Savannah and Charleston. I had the most incredible and luxurious getaway, and I’d highly recommend looking into it!\n\nTexas Hill Country, Texas\n\nTexas Hill Country\n\nWhen most people think of Texas, they think of rolling hills and tons of rustic charm…but maybe not about flowers!\n\nBut central Texas is home to large fields of bluebonnets, painting the ground in color. From mid-March to mid-April places like Burnet, Georgetown, Fredericksburg, Austin, and Washington County are completely covered and are quite impressive – perfect for a honeymoon photoshoot!\n\nGoing on a road trip? The Ennis Bluebonnet Trail is 40-miles of brilliant florals.\n\nThe small town of Burnet, Texas is a real star and comes alive in March during the Bluebonnet Season. As soon as spring has sprung, you’ll find vibrant meadows taken over by wildflowers.\n\nHead to Devil’s Backbone Overlook for a picnic then take a scenic drive through the Willow City Loop. Whether you want to sleep under the stars in this gorgeous region or take a day trip from Austin, Texas Hill Country is a must-visit (and don’t forget your camera!).\n\nGarden Of The Gods, Colorado\n\nColorado Springs\n\nAnother gem of the Rocky Mountains, this is a dream honeymoon destination for outdoor lovers. Trek through the Garden of the Gods and climb up Pikes Peak. Hop on a hot air balloon for the ride of a lifetime, then watch the world go by at Memorial Park.\n\nAdd plenty of time to explore the rest of this stunning state. Whether you are admiring the mesas of Grand Junction or taking in the urban delights and things to do in Denver, Colorado is well worth exploring.\n\nBest USA Honeymoon Destinations in April\n\nWondering where the best April honeymoon destinations are? While temps are still on the chillier side, there’s no doubt that spring is in the air…which means florals and sunshine!\n\nCharleston, South Carolina\n\nCharleston, South Carolina\n\nOf all the places I’ve visited, this is one that surprised me the most. While I’d heard it was lovely, I didn’t expect to fall head over heels in love with Charleson like I did.\n\nStaying at the cozy, romantic 86 Cannon Historic Inn in Charleston, I actually found myself not wanting to leave in the morning! That is more than a little rare for me, but the welcoming inn was a key part of what made Charleston so charming.\n\nI fell in love with this South Carolina gem — full of incredible food and Southern charm, this is one of the best spring honeymoon destinations in America. Definitely check out my Charleston foodie guide to start planning out your meals!\n\nA seriously romantic restaurant that’s well worth making a reservation at way ahead of time is the (slightly hidden) Chez Nous. The chef at this adorable neighborhood spot, located in a 19th-century home (no less), serves up a new menu every single day and only uses the freshest ingredients.\n\nI’m telling you, if you’re looking for a foodie honeymoon, Charleston should not be missed!\n\nYou could easily spend three days in Charleston, and then if you wanted to extend your trip, you could pop on over to Savannah (it’s about a 2-3 hour drive from Charleston).\n\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\n\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\n\nOne of the top ski destinations in the United States, this gorgeous city is also a fantastic spring honeymoon destination in the USA. While spring is one of the quietest times in Jackson Hole, it’s prime time to hike, bike, and swim your way through the top attractions.\n\nSome of the highlights of Jackson Hole include visiting Yellowstone National Park (which is about a 90-minute drive from Jackson), exploring Grand Teton National Park, white water rafting on the Snake River Canyon, and horseback riding.\n\nWalk amongst the greenery, spot buffalos (from a safe distance), and watch the eagles fly overhead while you breathe in the oh-so-fresh air here.\n\nJackson Hole is a prime honeymoon spot for the couple that loves adventures in nature.\n\nBest USA Honeymoon Destinations in May\n\nThe weather starts to warm up in May and there are so many choices to pick from. Better yet, May is a great time as summer vacation hasn’t started for school kids, so typically, places aren’t as crowded.\n\nLake Wenatchee, Leavenworth 2hrs from Seattle\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nWhile you might get a few rainy days, forget about the gray overcast images that you have of Seattle in your mind.
