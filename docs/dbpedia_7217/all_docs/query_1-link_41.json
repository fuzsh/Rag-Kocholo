We know the memories of this adventure will last far longer than a new toaster or hand towels.”\n\n“We were so grateful to have found Traveler’s Joy. We had planned to stay on 3 different islands, so Traveler’s Joy was essential to organizing every detail to share with our loved ones. Plus, we had way too much fun putting together our profile!”\n\n“For our honeymoon we really wanted to explore some of the most iconic countries in Western Europe. Thanks to Traveler's Joy, we were able to do so to the fullest extent!”\n\n“Traveler’s Joy made it possible for us to trek across Italy for the honeymoon we didn’t dare dream possible. Mostly, though, it gave us a profound appreciation for the friends and family who helped bring our travel itinerary to life.”\n\n“We had so much fun planning out each of our stops, creating our customized Traveler’s Joy page with a description and photo for each one, then shared it on our wedding website.”\n\n“We wholeheartedly recommend Traveler’s Joy as a registry to anyone who wants less stuff to stash and more stories to share.”\n\n“We both felt passionate that despite our love for cooking, there was no plate or rolling pin or mixer that could compare to a once-in-a-lifetime trip.”\n\n“Our friends and family thought we were crazy to spend our first 6 days as a married couple camping in tents on the side of a mountain. With the help of Traveler’s Joy, we did it anyway. From September 10-25, we had the trip of a lifetime.”\n\n“Traveler's Joy did a phenomenal job getting us the cash we needed in a timely manner. They also created an opportunity for our family and friends to feel a part of our honeymoon in a special way. For that, we are forever grateful.”"
