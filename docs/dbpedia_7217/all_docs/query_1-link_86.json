        "text": "CongTV and Viy Cortez are off to their honeymoon!\n\nViy’s latest Instagram Story shows them in what looks like a lobby with Cong holding luggage. The longtime couple and newlyweds has yet to reveal their honeymoon destination.\n\n“First honeymoon dalawa lang kami,” the vlogger and businesswoman said in her caption.\n\n“Talaga namang new year kahit June palang,” Viy added with an airplane emoji.\n\nThe top content creators exchanged their vows on June 17 at the L’Annunziata Parish Church in Muntinlupa City. Cong dressed up in a black suit by Francis Libiran, while Viy wowed in a custom Leo Almodal wedding gown.\n\nViy and Cong got engaged in 2022. They welcomed their son, Kidlat, in the same year.\n\nEarlier this month, the couple held a pamamanhikan with their families just a few days before their wedding.\n\nBefore tying the knot, Cong and Viy had their prenup shoots in Japan and at the beach.\n\nEarly this year, the couple starred in Zack Tabudlo’s music video for “Pulso.”"
