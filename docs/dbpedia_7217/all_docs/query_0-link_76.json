Either way, you can fly to Alaska from most major airports.\n\nWhere to stay: The Lakefront Anchorage\n\n8. Corfu, Greece\n\nThe beautiful Greek island of Corfu is an affordable alternative to popular destinations like Santorini and Mykonos.

Yellowstone National Park\n\nOutdoorsy couples, there’s no better place than Yellowstone National Park to connect with nature. A skier’s paradise in the winter and a hiker’s dream in the summer, you can explore Yellowstone by horseback, cruise around Yellowstone Lake, or hop on a guided tour. Book a cozy cabin, lodge, or resort within your budget range.\n\nWhere to stay: Wyoming Inn at Jackson Hole\n\n11. Nicaragua\n\nHave you ever thought about sandboarding down a volcano? Experience the thrill in Nicaragua, the land of lakes and volcanoes. Take advantage of the Central American country’s tranquil beaches and tropical forests, and book your stay at an affordable honeymoon resort. Visit during the \"green\" season (May through November) when prices are low.\n\nWhere to stay: Yemaya Reefs\n\n12.

Porto, Portugal\n\nKnown for its port wine and breathtaking views of the Douro River, it’s free to walk down the historic Aliados Avenue, browse the shops on Sta. Catarina Street, and visit the Grand Cathedral. There are accommodations in Porto for every budget range. Plus, you can travel by riverside tram to get fully immersed in the city’s charm.\n\nWhere to stay: Airbnb The Cathedral's Terrace\n\n16. The Bahamas\n\nThe Bahamas is one of the most sought-after honeymoon spots, but there are ways to make the tropical oasis more affordable. Avoid the height of the season (mid-December to mid-April) and invest in low-cost activities, such as hitting the crystal blue beaches and visiting the lush tropical gardens at the Ardastra Gardens & Wildlife Conservation Centre.\n\nWhere to stay: Airbnb Rum Dum Cottage\n\n17. Jamaica\n\nJamaica is close to the U.S., so the flights are cheaper than those to other parts of the Caribbean. Once there, you’ll find sandy beaches, tasty Jamaican food, and endless rum punches.

From setting your budget to researching all-inclusive packages, these suggestions will help you make the most out of your trip.\n\n1. Create a budget—and stick to it\n\nFirst, sit down with your partner and set a honeymoon budget you’re both comfortable with. Ask yourselves, “What are your priorities?” Would you rather splurge on a fancy resort? Activities? Maybe you both don’t mind spending money on an overseas flight if the country you’re going to has affordable housing and free excursions. Once you’ve established your budget, commit to it throughout your trip.\n\n2. Book your flights and hotel early\n\nTrust us: Don’t wait until the last minute to book your flights or travel accommodations. We recommend planning your trip six to eight months in advance. That way, you’ll have enough time to research deals and find flights within your budget. You’ll also have a greater selection of rooms and options for hotels, resorts, and Airbnbs (especially if you travel during the busy season).\n\n3. Travel during off-seasons\n\nIf you want to visit a popular destination, consider traveling during the off-season when crowds are minimal and prices are lower. However, you’ll want to ensure the weather is still good. For example, avoid going to the Caribbean in August and September because of peak hurricane season. Similarly, spring may not be the best time to visit Yellowstone because many parks are closed then.\n\n4. Look at all-inclusive options\n\nBooking an all-inclusive honeymoon is a smart way to take a vacation without surprise fees or extra expenses. Besides your accommodation, the packages typically include food, entertainment, and activities. Cruises are a popular all-inclusive option for honeymooners. But if you’d rather not travel by ship, there are all-inclusive honeymoon resorts available in most destinations. Bonus: Zola has cruise gift cards to help you raise funds for the big trip.\n\n5. Use Zola’s honeymoon fund\n\nInstead of using your wedding registry for new cookware, consider asking your guests to contribute to your honeymoon! Zola’s honeymoon and cash funds make it easy for your friends and family to give you money for your trip and specific experiences, including round-trip airfare, dinner for two, and activities like watersports or horseback riding."
