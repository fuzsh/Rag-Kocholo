        "text": "**This review is contributed by Super Channel—a channel dedicated to providing integrity and accountability in today’s entertainment.\n\nFilmed in beautiful Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada, you will love the captivating scenery and beautiful aerial shots of Lake Okanagan. The story is emotional and the cast creates a realistic onscreen chemistry that will hold your interest, keep you guessing and taking sides as you enjoy a movie night at home with your entire family. Dove-approved for All Ages.\n\nAva (Rebecca Dalton) is excited about meeting her soon-to-be fiancé, Brett (Edward Ruttle) at the restaurant, and who is sure to propose tonight! Her sister, Bonnie (Jocelyn Gauthier), listens with some skepticism as Ava rehearses her “yes” answer, and the entire plan for the evening. The dinner, Ava insists will be the chicken, even though Brett wants steak and potatoes, and now the wine and small talk that hopefully will turn serious as she steers Brett to the patio against his will. As he proposes, the photographer suddenly appears and Brett is somewhat shocked but goes along with it.\n\nAva happily gushes about the wedding plans and Brett is a bit surprised as she changes “their” minds about the venue from the beach to the park. The honeymoon in the tropics blindsides Brett but … he’s OK with it. The dress … Ava bought it three years ago knowing Brett would propose. The unusual pre-planning, the pre-purchase, the pre-plans for her business, pre-plans for Brett’s career, etc. is overwhelming as she lives her life before actually living it!\n\nAs Ava and Bonnie admire the pre-purchased bridal gown, Brett walks in unexpectedly, shocking Ava as he breaks the engagement and is gone…\n\nBut the honeymoon tickets and the first-class resort are non-refundable and Bonnie suggests Ava should go anyway, and enthusiastically offers to join her!\n\nThe crowds of happy couples at the resort depress Ava, but things start to improve when she meets handsome Kyle (Spencer Lord). As Ava spends time with Kyle, she is finding happiness and a way through the hurt, but when Brett unexpectedly arrives to announce how sorry he is and what a mistake he made, and takes every opportunity to make amends, Ava is more confused than ever. Can Ava ever trust Brett again, or is sweet supportive Kyle her path to happiness? Ava must call on all her senses and emotional self-protection to figure out what she truly wants in a forever partner.\n\nThe Dove Take\n\n“Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning” (Archbishop Desmond Tutu). Wise words to consider whether you are the forgiver, or the forgiven. Ava and Brett did just that and a new understanding created a relationship stronger than ever."
