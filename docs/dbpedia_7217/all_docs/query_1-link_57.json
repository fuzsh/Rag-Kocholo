        "text": "Sonoma County is California’s best honeymoon destination. That may seem like a grand proclamation, but we’re not just boasting. Here’s why: Sonoma County is where you can find abundant sunshine, more than 425 wineries, romantic vineyards, breathtaking Pacific Ocean beaches, award-winning restaurants, majestic redwood forests, relaxing resorts, and did we mention world-class wine? Last but not least, this favorite Wine Country is just 45 minutes away from San Francisco. Who needs more?\n\nSimply take a look at these five points, and you’ll surely agree that Sonoma Wine Country region is prime not only for weddings, but for the happy couple’s getaway, too.\n\n1. The Romance of Wine\n\nThere’s no denying the pleasure of a fine glass of wine, and shared with a loved one, a sip adds an extra special statement to even the most simple moment. Sonoma County boasts more than 400 wineries, and 60,000 acres planted with world-class winegrapes of nearly every varietal imaginable.\n\nStart with Albarino, end with Zinfandel (Mazzocco Sonoma winery of Healdsburg crafts nearly two dozen variations from nearly a dozen vineyards each year), and taste every letter of the alphabet in between.\n\nThen, as you’re ready to fly home, Alaska Airlines invites you to check up to a case of wine for free when you depart from the Charles M. Schulz – Sonoma County (STS) Airport.\n\nWould you like to play princess for a day? Visit Sonoma’s Wine Castles, for example: Ledson (photo above), Chateau St. Jean, Ferrari-Carano, and Francis Ford Coppola wineries.\n\n2. Lovely Places to Cuddle\n\nWhether you’re looking for a posh, modern retreat (the recently renovated Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa, for example) a quaint, historic B&B amid the vineyards (the 1880 Raford Inn beckons), or intimate luxury (the four-diamond Vintners Resort), lodging here is so unique and welcoming you may never choose to leave your estate grounds.\n\nExplore all hotel listings here. But first, be sure to explore our terrific, insider-only deals and specials.\n\nPlus, many Sonoma County hotels and inns offer passes for complimentary wine tastings at dozens of nearby wineries. Find wineries here.\n\nWhat would a romantic getaway be without sunsets, ocean breezes and breathtaking views? Find favorite romantic spots here.\n\n3. The Embrace of Mother Nature\n\nRunning hand-in-hand through grassy meadows, strolling through whispering mountaintop forests, romping on the beach, and plucking flowers from vast gardens to wear in your hair. Does that sound like a greeting card?\n\nIt’s reality in Sonoma County, which spans more than 1 million gorgeous acres, from the Mayacamas Mountains range to the Pacific Ocean coast. With near-endless parks, preserves, babbling streams, greenbelts, and vast open agricultural and grazing areas, there’s something new to explore every day.\n\nHow much open space is there, really? In fact, rural lands take up almost two-thirds of Sonoma County’s total acreage, and the Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District continues to acquire more land for protection every single year, enjoying a remarkable 28 percent growth since 2006. Explore our listings of outdoor activities and nature parks.\n\n4. Wine … and Dine\n\nGiven the wondrous agricultural bounty grown in Sonoma County, the pasture-raised beef, lamb, pigs, and poultry, plus rainbow arrays of artisan cheeses, breads, and treats like handcrafted chocolates, it’s no wonder that we’re home to some of America’s best farm-to-table restaurants.\n\nJust a few of our top-rated destinations include the 2019 Michelin star favorites SingleThread (three stars) and Farmhouse Inn (one star).\n\nIf you’re a true foodie, you might even think about a spring wedding, to take advantage of Restaurant Week in March. Get details about the best restaurants in Sonoma County.\n\n5. Play Time\n\nBecause Sonoma County encompasses such a broad range of landscapes, the recreation is equally expansive.\n\nYou and your honey can horseback ride at wineries or along the coastal bluffs of Bodega Bay, zip line through the redwoods, hike and bike, kayak the Russian River, and go hot-air ballooning over vineyards, lakes, and valleys.\n\nPerhaps you’d like to take a winery tour in a horse-drawn carriage, or stroll through a vineyard. It’s all at your beck-and-call. Find sightseeing and tours here.\n\nPlanning a wedding?"
