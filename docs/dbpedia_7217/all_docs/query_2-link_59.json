They are from Clinton Township — only about 40 kilometres from downtown Windsor.\n\n\"It's like a real laid back environment that is still welcoming as well,\" Malea said.\n\n\"We knew that it was the place we wanted to have our honeymoon.\"\n\nMalea says they knew they wanted to have their honeymoon just over the border — a decision she says was well-received back home.\n\n\"I know the people I told, they were like 'I like that. It's different, but I can see why you guys chose Canada and chose Windsor,'\" she said. \"'It's quiet, it's chill. You guys will have a great time.'\"\n\nCourtney says he likes Windsor as a destination because, for him, crossing the border is enough for him to feel like he's on a getaway.\n\n\"For us, it's about a 45-minute trip and it feels like we travelled to Florida,\" he said.\n\n\"That was the first thing we recognized, was like 'wow' even though we can look back across the water and see where we essentially spend a lot of our time but we definitely like that getaway feeling without the hustle and bustle of getting on a plane or travelling hours and hours away.\"\n\nFinding stuff to do in the region wasn't hard, however, thanks to the Windsor community, says Malea. She put a call out on the Windsor, Ontario Facebook page. That post garnered 196 comments filled with suggestions.\n\nThe couple says they enjoyed their stay in a downtown hotel, hit up the Jerk Festival and spent a day at a resort in Harrow. They also got a couple's massage in downtown and grabbed some good eats along the way — including at Neros Steakhouse in Caesars Windsor. It made Opentable.com's list of Canada's top 100 most romantic restaurants in 2023.\n\n\"I think a lot of people don't really appreciate or understand the gem that is Windsor.... You don't even have to look hard, like there's just so much going on,\" Malea said, adding that they were bummed they were going to miss T-Pain who was playing a concert the weekend after they left.\n\nThe couple don't know when they'll be back but they're already looking ahead for the next opportunity.\n\n\"We're big on completing the circle,\" Courtney said. \"Us now having Windsor as our honeymoon spot, it's definitely on the docket to return and complete the circle, so for me one year sounds about right.\"\n\nSeeking romance\n\nJason Toner, director of Marketing & Communications for Tourism Windsor-Essex Pelee Island, said they are running a couple of campaigns to bring people from the U.S. and Michigan to the region, whether it's just for an escape or a honeymoon.\n\n\"You can get that value weekend away for $500 American that you might be spending $2,000 to $3,000 to do somewhere on the American side of things,\" he said.\n\nToner says you don't really realize all the romance you have in your backyard until you're really looking for it.\n\nHe says along with the nature, restaurants and wineries that are tried and tested — there are also cool experiences out there like making a charcuterie board together or candle making classes.\n\nToner himself is experiencing the region as someone who is \"newly in love.\"\n\n\"Going on new date nights, I'm really experiencing what that new love is and that atmosphere that you get in a restaurant of someone that's putting the effort into making your experience special,\" he said.\n\n\"We have so many friendly spots to step in and make a cool experience, but not trying too hard to do it.\""
