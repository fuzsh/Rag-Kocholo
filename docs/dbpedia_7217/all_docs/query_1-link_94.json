        "text": "Add the Cranberries and U2 to that honeymoon soundtrack—the emerald hills of Ireland are calling. Roughly two hours from Dublin, Relais & Châteaux's recently refurbished Cashel Palace Hotel in County Tipperary reopened in March 2022. The stately Palladian manor, built for an archbishop in 1732, now has an array of modern amenities including a spa and sauna, a 56-foot indoor pool, elevators, and air-conditioned guest rooms.\n\nWith just nine sumptuous suites and 42 bedrooms, the property feels intimate—a lovely place to take a morning stroll through elegant English-style gardens, relax in an outdoor seaweed bath, or sip afternoon tea from delicate bone china in the elegant Queen Anne Room. Adventurous couples will make the most of these picturesque country environs, of course, by exploring the medieval Rock of Cashel and Hore Abbey, joining a spine-tingling ghost walk through spooky Leap Castle, or hiking the ancient pilgrim path of St. Declan's Way.\n\nIf there was ever a time and place to splurge on a vacation, it’s a honeymoon in the Maldives. Screensaver-blue waters and Pinterest-worthy overwater bungalows are a common sight in this corner of the world, but the enchanting Fari Islands—with its ultra-luxe resorts, community marina, and beach club—really ups the ante. A 50-minute speedboat ride from Velana International Airport in the North Malé Atoll brings couples to one of two stunning hotels: Patina Maldives, Fari Islands and the Ritz-Carlton Maldives. A third, the Kengo Kuma–designed Capella Maldives, is slated to open in 2027.\n\nPatina Maldives, Fari Islands, is the first flagship property from Patina Hotels & Resorts, a new-ish lifestyle brand from Capella Hotel Group. It was designed by Brazilian architect Marcio Kogan of Studio MK27 and features 90 one- to three-bedroom beach and pool villas, 20 studios, a specially commissioned James Turrell Skyspace pavilion, and a plant-based meal experience set in an organic permaculture garden. Honeymooners, in particular, should take note of Patina’s new Island Romance package, which bundles together private dinners, couples’ massages, meditation sessions, and a chance to take part in the resort’s coral-conservation program.\n\nA honeymoon in wine country? Sounds like the perfect pairing. At the 712-acre Stanly Ranch, Auberge Resorts Collection on the banks of the Napa River, rustic cottages (from $995 per night) are situated among rolling vines. (The working ranch and vineyard is known for its pinot noir and chardonnay varietals.) Couples can cycle alongside olive groves, play bocce on the “great lawn,” splash around the resort's hilltop pool, treat yourselves to a wine-themed spa treatment, vineyard hop to neighboring wineries (including Scribe and Matthiasson), or take a 10-minute hotel shuttle to downtown Napa, where they can sample top-notch cabernet sauvignon and global cuisine. (Angèle Restaurant & Bar, a riverside spot for romantic French fare, is fantastic for both.) While downtown, pay a visit to Brown Estate—the first and only Black-owned winery in the region. A bottle of their zinfandel makes for a memorable souvenir.\n\nA newly year-round direct flight from New York to Funchal, the capital of Portugal’s Autonomous Region of Madeira, has made the far-flung archipelago more accessible than ever for American travelers. Beyond its thrilling hiking and mountain biking trails, Madeira is heaven for foodies: Dine at the remote beachfront restaurant Fajã dos Padres, where many of the ingredients are farmed organically on-site; sip rum at Porto da Cruz, a distillery run by steam engine; and settle in for a six-, nine-, or 12-course tasting menu at the Michelin-starred Desarma, opened in 2023 by Chef Octávio Freitas on the rooftop of the boutique-y Views Baía hotel.\n\nWhen you’re ready to trade small-town vibes for big-city action, fly to the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, home of the oldest bookstore on earth (Bertrand) as well as the recently reopened Royal Treasury Museum at the Palácio Nacional da Ajuda. Browse the luxury boutiques lining the Avenida da Liberdade, a.k.a. the Champs Elysées of Lisbon; take a tile workshop at the Museu Nacional do Azulejo; or soak up more Vitamin D by driving an hour south to the beaches in the stunning Setúbal district. Kayaking beneath the peninsular cliffs in Parque Natural de Arrábida is a must, as is locking in one of the 53 rooms or suites at AlmaLusa, the only hotel in Comporta that is walkable to a beach.\n\nInstead of following the crowd on the well-trodden Tokyo-Mt. Fuji-Kyoto route, honeymooners should consider a winter getaway to Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island and the largest and wildest of its 47 prefectures. Kickstart the journey at Akan Mashu National Park by paddling around Lake Kussharo, the second largest caldera lake in the world, and down the serene Kushiro River with Kussharo Eco Tours, one of two local operators running canoe tours year-round. (If you’re lucky, your guide may spot a white-tailed eagle or rare Blakiston’s fish owl.) Lake Mashu, also within park boundaries, is equally worth a stop. It’s one of the clearest lakes on Earth, primarily because humans are forbidden from going on or in it. The best way to experience Mashu’s majesty is via a snowshoeing tour, led by soft-spoken naturalist and hobby photographer Shinobu Katase, around the rim of its caldera.\n\nLearning about the Ainu, the original inhabitants of Hokkaido, on an enlightening Anytime, Ainutime! excursion through Lake Akan Ainu Kotan, one of Japan’s largest indigenous villages, is another can’t-miss experience. Language, foraging, culture, crafts—it’s all covered, and you can further support the community by shopping at one of the 20-plus Ainu-owned stores in the area.\n\nWhatever you get up to by day, the open-air onsen at Oyado KinkiyuBettei Suikazura in the steaming hot springs town of Kawayu is where you want to unwind at night. The spring-fed waters rank among Japan’s most acidic—which does wonders for some skin conditions but can also corrode jewelry (so slip those new rings off before you plunge in).\n\nFor newlyweds craving a touch of adventure, Uniworld’s 16-day Peruvian Amazon & Machu Picchu Exploration (from $13,999 per guest) delivers in spades. The itinerary starts and ends in Lima and includes a weeklong cruise on the Aria Amazon, a luxurious river boat with floor-to-ceiling windows in its 16 chicly designed staterooms.\n\nAmong the featured excursions: a skiff ride on the Marañón River in Iquitos, where lucky couples might spot pink dolphins or one of 64 rare birds; kayaking or canoeing the tarry black waters of the Yanayacu-Pucate River; jungle trekking with a naturalist through the San Jose de Sarapanga forest, eyes peeled for 300-pound water lilies; and visiting a manatee rescue and rehabilitation center in Maynas. The pièce de résistance, of course, is a visit to the epic wonder that is Machu Picchu.\n\nMaybe it's the pink sand beaches or the British colonial architecture or the ease of flying there in two hours from New York City, but Bermuda is always popular with the honeymoon crowd. It's even more enticing now that a state-of-the-art terminal has opened at LF Wade International Airport. Taking a page from the Singapore Changi playbook, the sustainably designed project features a putting green, nature trail, and outdoor terraces. On the hotel front, The Loren at Pink Beach lures newlyweds with its contemporary design, one-bedroom villa suites with private heated pools, and fun honeymooner activities like shipwreck diving (Bermuda’s coastline holds the world record for most wrecks per square mile). Other postnuptial properties to consider include Azura Bermuda, a cliffside boutique hotel overlooking South Shore, and the century-old Cambridge Beaches Resort, with its full-service marina and European-style spa.\n\nBesides swimming and sunbathing, newlyweds can plant a cedar tree to commemorate their special day, thanks to a partnership with the Bermuda National Trust, or explore Black-owned businesses and other historic points of interest along the African Diaspora Heritage Trail. At sunset, toast to married life at The Birdcage, a seasonal rooftop cocktail bar.\n\nA storybook wedding deserves a storybook honeymoon—and a road trip around the Faroe Islands is the stuff of Grimms' Fairy Tales. Fly into Vágar Airport and pick up a vehicle from 62°N Car Rental; the North Atlantic archipelago is well-connected via tunnels and bridges, with mom-and-pop accommodations sprinkled throughout the islands. At Hanusarstova, an airy cottage in the village of Æðuvík, about a 20-minute drive from the capital of Tórshavn, young farmers Harriet and John ply their Airbnb guests with homemade breakfasts—including eggs from their own chickens.\n\nAlternatively, couples can base themselves at the four-star, Green Key-certified Hotel Brandan in Tórshavn, and make day trips along the Sóljuleiðir, or Buttercup routes, named for the Faroese national flower. Intrepid honeymooners who take it slow will be rewarded with cascading waterfalls and spectacular hiking trails, turf roof homes nestled amid rolling green hills, and an abundance of charming villages (Tjørnuvík, Gjógv, and Skálavík, to name just a few).\n\nFor newlyweds who first connected over a mutual love of food and drink, there’s no better place to indulge your cravings than New Orleans—land of powdery-sweet beignets, killer po’boys, and muffulettas the size of hubcaps. Check in at Hotel Peter & Paul, a 19th-century Catholic church, convent, and schoolhouse in the Marigny neighborhood that has been lovingly transformed into one of the finest boutique properties in the South. Couples can select from dozens of one-of-a-kind rooms decked out in rich tapestries, Italianate marble fireplaces, and hand-painted tile showers. More importantly, there’s the excellent Elysian Bar in the former rectory; the aperitivo hour (3 to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday) with its $9 pineapple shrub daiquiris and rillettes is the ultimate warmup for the bar crawl and food binge to come.\n\nOur suggestion: Start with a round of Vieux Carrés while going ‘round-and-round at the famous Carousel Bar in the storied Hotel Monteleone before eventually making your way to Fritai for innovative Haitian-Creole dishes like kabrit (crispy twice-cooked goat with rice and beans, fried plantains, and spicy relish), the charmingly Frenchified N7 in the Bywater for the housemade charcuterie and frog legs karaage with sambal aioli, or the Rabbit Hole Supper Club pop-up at Trap Kitchen, where the quirky parade of genre-rattling dishes sometimes includes a burnt grain salad we still dream about. When you’re ready for a nightcap, duck into the velvety-luxe Peacock Room at the Kimpton Hotel Fontenot, where the spirit menu is as vast as the vibe is sultry.\n\nIf you’ve left any room for non-culinary activities, the Germaine Cazenave Wells Mardi Gras Museum, secreted away above Arnaud’s Restaurant; the Ogden Museum of Southern Art; and City Park, whose handsome old oak trees drip with Spanish moss; are always worth a detour.\n\nMany travelers to the 49th state experience it from a ship deck, but tackling it by car, foot, and plane pays dividends for more DIY-type honeymooners. Start at the family-run Tutka Bay Lodge on Kachemak Bay near Homer. Nestled amid 35 acres of pristine forest, the rustic-luxe boutique property offers daily cooking classes, meditation and yoga, sea kayaking, bear viewing, glacier trekking, deep-sea fishing, and tours of the family’s nearby flower farm.\n\nNext stop: a charming A-frame cabin at Salted Roots in Seward. Sandwiched between a spruce forest and Resurrection Bay on the Kenai Peninsula, its private deck is the perfect perch to kick back after a packed day of sightseeing (or flightseeing, as the case may be). The couple that runs the place also owns Flamingo Lounge, a craft cocktail bar-cum steakhouse in town; ask them for tips on hiking, orca spotting, and where to buy the most unique Alaskan-made souvenirs.\n\nFor a grand finale, fly an hour north to Fairbanks and bed down in a glass dome igloo at Borealis Basecamp outside Fairbanks. Pitched amid towering spruce trees under an inky black sky, it’s ideal for catching the aurora borealis, which is most active from late August through April. When you’re not watching the night sky, you can walk alongside reindeer in a boreal forest or make a day trip to the Arctic Circle.\n\nOne of the most relaxing ways to experience the beauty of Central Vietnam is aboard The Vietage by Anantara, a luxury train carriage operated by Anantara. Originating in Đà Nẵng, it chugs its way through the scenic countryside and along the South China Sea, ending in the coastal town of Quy Nhơn. The 12-passenger car is dolled up in 1920s and '30s French Colonial style, complete with a full bar. Couples can indulge in endless beer and bubbly during the six-hour journey; A three-course meal made with local ingredients and a 15-minute head-and-shoulder massage are also included.\n\nThe ideal way for newlyweds to experience the route is by booking Anantara's Exploring the Central Coast package (from $1,235 for two people). It features two one-way tickets aboard The Vietage, bookended by two nights in a deluxe balcony room at Anantara Hoi An, just a half hour's drive from Đà Nẵng, and two nights in a glamorous oceanfront villa at Anantara Quy Nhơn Villas. Honeymooners won't even have to worry about feeding themselves; daily breakfast and dining credits are folded into the rate.\n\nFor couples bonded over their love of the great outdoors, the five-day Great Smoky Mountains Hiking trip (from $5,899 per person for a private guided excursion) from REI Adventures will leave them breathless—literally and figuratively. The itinerary winds through the 522,427-acre Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina and includes a visit to the 19th-century John Oliver Cabin in Cades Cove, one of the park’s oldest historical structures, and Andrews Bald, a double peak on Forney Ridge and the highest bald in the Smokies. It also covers a leg of the Appalachian Trail, culminating with panoramic views of Fontana Lake from atop the historic Shuckstack fire tower.\n\nThe hiking will be moderately challenging, covering between four and nine miles per day, but honeymooners won’t rough it come nightfall: sleeping arrangements include a stay at the 76-year-old Nantahala Village Resort and glamping in Under Canvas’ safari-style tents with real beds, private baths, and wood-burning stoves. Meals, guides, park fees, and transportation from Knoxville are included.\n\nFor couples who believe luxury and romance go hand in hand, there are few destinations more glamorous than Dubai. The largest city in the United Arab Emirates boasts some of the world’s most opulent hotels and spas, a cityscape rife with glittering architecture, and more than a dozen Michelin-starred restaurants. One&Only Royal Mirage makes for a stunning basecamp with its jewel-toned Arabian suites, tiled hammam, and lagoon-style swimming pools (including one reserved exclusively for adults). Pry yourself away from the five-star property and the whole city awaits: Sign up for a Dubai Fountain lake ride at the foot of the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building; hop aboard a traditional abra at Dubai Creek to browse mountains of colorful spices and gobs of wedding jewelry in the traditional spice and gold souks, respectively; or check out the knock-your-socks-off Lost Chambers Aquarium at Atlantis The Palm, home to more than 65,000 marine animals.\n\nEnd the trip with a stay at Bab Al Shams, a splendid Arabian Desert resort just beyond city limits. Days here are spent bashing dunes, riding camels, and splashing around Escher-esque, multi-tiered swimming pools. Nights are for stargazing and, well, use your imagination.\n\nWhen the team behind The Resort at Paws Up, a four-time Readers' Choice Awards winner and one of the most exclusive addresses in rural Montana, announced the summer 2021 opening of a new adults-only retreat, newlyweds took notice. The Green O is tucked into the same 37,000-acre working ranch that houses Paws Up—deep in the forested Blackfoot River Valley yet less than a 40-minute drive to the Missoula airport. The Green O’s 12 standalone guest houses have enormous windows for taking in the serene woodlands, but the two-story Tree Haus layout, lofted 23 feet above the ground, feels the most private. When couples aren’t curling up by one of two fireplaces or soaking in the ground-level outdoor hot tub, they can pass the hours horseback riding, hot air ballooning, and whitewater rafting. Food, wine, airport transfers, and the use of a Lexus SUV on-site are included in the nightly rate.\n\nNewlyweds keen on taking their relationship to a deeper level can get their minds, bodies, and souls in sync at AYANA Estate on Jimbaran Bay in the south of Bali. The one-bedroom cliff villas have sweeping views of the Indian Ocean, plus plunge pools and personalized butler service, but it’s the property’s cultural and holistic wellness offerings that really entice: sunrise yoga, sound bath meditation, Hindu temple visits, batik painting classes; tours of the on-site Saka Museum, an architecturally stunning cultural center that explores the Balinese philosophy of Tri Hita Karana; herbal remedy workshops where participants harvest their own ingredients from the resort’s five-acre organic farm; and thalassotherapy, a spa treatment that heats saltwater to the optimum temperature to stimulate circulation and rebalance the body’s minerality. Honeymooners can also request dinner on a private pier surrounded by flickering tiki torches or a couples massage in twin villas nested atop ocean-facing rocks.\n\nFrom Bali, hop a one-hour flight to Komodo National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Indonesia’s Lesser Sunda archipelago known for its rugged landscapes and scaly residents (more than 4,000 Komodo dragon monitor lizards call this home). Drop your bags at AYANA Komodo Waecicu Beach in Labuan Bajo and head straight for the water: Popular activities here include stand-up paddleboarding and sea kayaking, snorkeling at Menjerite Island, planting coral with an in-house marine biologist, and exploring Komodo’s various nooks and crannies aboard Lako di’a, a traditional phinisi yacht fit for Balinese royalty."
