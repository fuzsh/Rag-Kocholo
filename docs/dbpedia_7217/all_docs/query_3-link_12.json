        "text": "The marriage of King Edward VII and divorced Wallis Simpson occurred secretly after King Edward renounced the throne in 1936. Their wedding had less than 20 guests at Château de Candé in France. Photos weren't even released to the public until 80 years later.\n\nThe couple first met in 1934 at the wedding of Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark who was Philip's cousin. After more than a decade of courtship, the two officially announced their engagement in 1947 and married at Westminster Abbey.\n\nKelly first met Prince Rainier III at the Cannes Film Festival in April 1955, after she was invited to take part in a photo session at the Palace of Monaco.\n\nPrincess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones was the first royal couple to take their wedding day to the small screen. With more than 20-million viewers tuned in, the duo wed at Westminister Abbey in May of 1960.\n\nSarah and Andrew knew each other as children and later became romantically linked after meeting again at a party at Floors Castle. Four months after Prince Andrew proposed on his 26th birthday, they were married.\n\nThe couple first met in 1977 and the relationship intensified when Charles invited Diana for a weekend at Balmoral, his family's Scottish residence, in 1980. Twenty-year-old Diana married the Prince of Wales just one year later.\n\nThey spent their honeymoon sailing the Mediterranean aboard the royal yacht Britannia. Afterward they visited Scotland, where the rest of the royal family had gathered at Balmoral, and spent time in a hunting lodge by the estate.\n\nPrince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones wed in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. This wedding was unique in that the children carrying the Coutness' dress were all commoners — a first in royal wedding history.\n\nThe twosome kept their honeymoon simple with a low-key visit to the Birkhall Lodge in Scotland.\n\nFrederick met Mary in 2000 during the Summer Olympics in Sydney, and only later did he tell her that he was Denmark's Crown Prince. They married four years later at the Copenhagen Cathedral in, Denmark."
