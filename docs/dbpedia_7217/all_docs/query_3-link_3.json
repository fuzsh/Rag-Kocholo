        "text": "After you and your partner are pronounced newlyweds, digging your toes in the white-sand beaches of Bora Bora, admiring the luminous Eiffel Tower in Paris, or trekking through the deserts of South Africa are celebratory ways to kick off and celebrate this new chapter in your relationship. Whether it’s restful or action-packed, coastal or mountainous, embarking on a honeymoon after your wedding allows you and your spouse to spend one-on-one time together, deepen your connection, and create everlasting memories.\n\nWhile jetting off to a new destination is a popular post-wedding tradition that many modern couples participate in, the travel-focused custom has actually existed for centuries. The difference, however, is that now, the honeymoon presents an opportunity for couples to relax, bond, and explore, whereas in medieval times—when the ritual first began—the “trip” had a darker, less romantic purpose.\n\nIf you want to know more about how the honeymoon tradition originated, we spoke to wedding historian Susan Waggoner and travel guru Dr. Terika Haynes to give us the rundown on the meaning and history of this post-nuptial getaway. Read on to learn all about its inception, plus how this ritual has evolved over time.\n\nThe History and Meaning of the Honeymoon Tradition\n\nThe honeymoon tradition first originated in the fifth century during medieval times. Although the custom, as we know it today, symbolizes romance and celebration, it derives from “marriage by capture,” an ancient practice in which the groom would kidnap his bride with the intention of impregnating her without her family objecting, according to Waggoner. The groom would hold the bride captive until “the family would either give up the search or the bride would become pregnant, making all questions of her return moot,” Waggoner says. With either outcome, the couple wouldn’t be able to nullify their marriage. Historians note that poor men in China, South America, East and South Asia, Africa, and some European countries would participate in this custom to avoid paying a dowry, a gift of money or property given to their spouse.\n\nThe medieval years were also responsible for coining the term “honeymoon.” In fifth-century Europe, guests would give the couple of honor a month’s worth (measured by one moon cycle) of mead, fermented honey. The bride and groom were then expected to guzzle down the alcoholic drink for 30 days to improve the likelihood of conception, per Waggoner. So, the word essentially signifies a moon’s worth of honey wine.\n\nHow the Honeymoon Tradition Has Evolved Over Time\n\nAlthough the honeymoon practice began with deceptive routes, it's evolved into a more romantic, consensual vacation. Ahead, read all about how the tradition has changed throughout the years.\n\nThe 19th Century\n\nIn 19th-century Britain and America, couples would venture on a “bridal tour,” where they would visit friends and family members who couldn’t attend the wedding. Sometimes, to help the woman ease into her married life, a friend or relative of the bride’s would accompany them. Starting in the 1870s, however, the pair would travel solo. These trips were also a way for spouses to flaunt their wealth and social status.\n\nThe 20th Century\n\nOnce the 20th century rolled around, honeymoons became a more prevalent trend that the middle class also took part in. Due to the evolution of automobiles and the development of the travel industry, couples started heading to far-flung locations. Certain destinations even attracted visitors by marketing it as a honeymoon spot. For instance, in the early 1900s, Niagara Falls developed the slogan “Honeymoon Capital of the World.” By mid-century, honeymoon resorts emerged. In the post-WWII era, as individuals adopted looser views on sex, honeymoons had a more romantic focus.\n\nThe 21st Century\n\nModern-day couples now wholeheartedly embrace the honeymoon tradition, which typically refers to a trip that the newlyweds take right after their wedding, just the two of them. In terms of the destination, the duration, and the itinerary, modern honeymoons don't have a rigid formula. They do share the same intention: celebrating their marriage and furthering their romance, a welcome change from its original purpose. Waggoner notes that since those in our current society usually marry for love and travel for pleasure, married individuals often take a post-wedding vacation for connection, enjoyment, and relaxation.\n\nNowadays, with the accessibility of air travel and the birth of the internet, modern spouses have the opportunity to jet off to virtually any spot in the world, from Puerto Rico to Sydney, Australia—as long as it’s within their means, of course. And current newlyweds usually seek out honeymoon destinations and plan activities that coincide with their interests, hobbies, and personalities, whether it’s more adventurous or more restorative. \"Honeymoons have become more personalized to reflect the things that the couple enjoys,\" Haynes mentions. \"Couples are now doing customized spa treatments, adventurous excursions, culinary tours, and much more.\"\n\nPopular Trends With the Modern Honeymoon Tradition\n\nWhile many couples settle on the more \"traditional\" modern honeymoon, in which the betrothed pair goes on a trip immediately after the wedding as a unit, there are many other trends that are popular today. Here are the types of modern honeymoons that are currently trending.\n\nDelayed Honeymoons\n\nMany couples depart right after their nuptials, but one modern honeymoon trend entails delaying the trip up to a year after the celebration. That way, instead of organizing the details of the getaway and rushing to pack your suitcase amid the wedding-planning chaos, duos can take a beat and recuperate after the wedding. Some also wait to take off based on their work schedules, their bank account, or the weather. Planning a delayed honeymoon also gives the pair something to look forward to by extending the festivities.\n\nMinimoons\n\nWhile the average honeymoon lasts about one week, instead of planning a multi-day escapade, some couples are embracing the minimoon, a quick trip (about two to three days) at a nearby locale that newlyweds take in the days or weeks following their big day. While many duos gravitate toward this trend as a budget-friendly option, per Haynes, some plan a longer honeymoon at a farther destination following their minimoon. Others organize a minimoon before their big day, whether it's a wellness getaway or a beach trip.\n\nTrip Stacking\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum lies trip stacking, a modern honeymoon trend that lasts weeks or even months (instead of the usual seven-day-long getaway). Many “stack” multiple vacations, such as planning one getaway that entails exploring several European cities or booking multiple cruises back to back.\n\nBuddymoons\n\nFollowing months of wedding festivities, honeymoons are often a chance for couples to spend some uninterrupted alone time together. Some, however, are arranging buddymoons, a honeymoon that extends the invitation to close friends, family, or anyone that newlyweds want to share the travel experience with. In some cases, the betrothed pair decides to spend the first half of the vacation with the group and the second half as a twosome. This type of honeymoon is trending due to the emphasis on in-person connection post-COVID, according to Haynes, and due to its cost-effective nature, since multiple people split the bill."
