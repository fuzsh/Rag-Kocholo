        "text": "The family of a British man whose wife was killed in a carjacking on their honeymoon in South Africa say they are shocked by the incident.\n\nShrien and Anni Dewani, who had been married for two weeks, were kidnapped at gunpoint near Cape Town on Saturday.\n\nMr Dewani was later released unharmed. His wife's body was found the next day.\n\nAt the couple's home in Westbury-on-Trym in Bristol, members of his family said they were shocked and still \"trying to take it all in\".\n\nWestern Cape police spokesman Lt Col Andre Traut said the couple's taxi had been hijacked in Gugulethu - a township 15km (9 miles) from Cape Town - by two armed men at 2300 local time.\n\n\"The driver was forced out of the vehicle then the two armed suspects took off with the vehicle with the couple inside,\" he said.\n\nMr Dewani, 31, was dropped off at midnight in Harare, an area of the township of Khayelitsha.\n\nHe flagged down a passing motorist who took him to a police station where he raised the alarm.\n\nA search was conducted and Mrs Dewani, 28, was found dead on the back seat of the car in Lingelethu West, with injuries to her head and chest.\n\nMr Traut said a post-mortem examination would be conducted to determine the exact cause of death."
