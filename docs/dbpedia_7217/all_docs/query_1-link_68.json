        "text": "Nick Viall and Natalie Joy are keeping their love on top.\n\nAfter the newlyweds were forced to cut their romantic getaway to the Turks and Caicos Islands short due to problems with Natalie's passport, Nick and Natalie are not letting the debacle dampen their honeymoon phase.\n\n\"It was our first test facing adversity as husband and wife,\" Nick exclusively told E! News. \"We were reminded of the importance of focusing on what really matters— having each other's backs and protecting our family.\"\n\nAs the Viall Files host emphasized, \"We made one another feel safe in a challenging situation.\"\n\nFollowing their April 27 wedding ceremony, Nick and Natalie—along with their 3-month-old daughter River and Natalie's mom—were forced to return to the United States just hours after arriving at their honeymoon destination because of a rip in Natalie's passport."
