        "text": "Last year when I took my solo trip to Hong Kong, I had originally considered the Maldives. When I came across a photo of their famed overwater villas on Pinterest seven years before, I immediately added it to my must-go-to list. The idea of falling asleep to crashing waves below my room and waking up to crystalline waters was incredibly enticing. When I searched for flights, I discovered that tickets to the exotic locale were equivalent to that of the autonomous southeastern China territory. But the deterrent was that a seaplane transfer was required for my ideal hotel, which took away time that I didn’t have to spare. Alas, I had to put my dream destination on hold.\n\nI’m a lover of solo travel—it allows me to explore a country or city without being held back by a companion’s differing interests or, frankly, the inability to walk as much or as quickly as I do (I definitely have that New Yorker gait). I also like to pack my days full with little downtime to rest, which isn’t preferable for many of my friends. Lately, I’ve been visiting bustling cities with plenty to do that are favorable for people traveling alone. But I’ve also fit in a few laid-back “honeymoon destinations” over the past few years. The state of Hawaii is often regarded as one, but I easily filled my time on Maui by farm hopping and on Kauai by taking in the incredible scenery (a cruise along the Na Pali Coast with Capt. Andy’s and a helicopter ride through Hanapepe Valley with Island Helicopters were some of my favorites). Then there’s, of course, Paris, one of the most romantic cities in the world that is often visited by honeymooners and where I realized how much I appreciate traveling on my own. But these two spots are also enticing to tourists who aren’t celebrating their nuptials, whereas the Maldives are an entirely different story (or so I thought).\n\nVacationing in the South Asian country means that you are essentially locked into the isle you’ve chosen. The 1,190 islands are owned by hotels, home to locals, or uninhabited, and hopping around is both pricey and fruitless (unless you’re splitting your time between different resorts). But when I arrived to Four Seasons Maldives at Kuda Huraa, to my surprise, I found that there were families and larger groups traveling together in addition to the expected couples. Sure, I was the only one there on my own, but I soon realized that the Maldives aren’t just a honeymoon destination. Yes, it provides the ultimate framework for being one—sunset cruises, an idyllic setting, accommodations that promote snuggling up in one’s room, and intimate candlelit dinners on the beach—but seeing so many other people who weren’t just partnered up shed light on the reality that there was much more to the Maldives.\n\nThe second I stepped through the doors of my overwater villa, I made a beeline for the bi-level deck. I quickly settled into the two built-in hammock floors, plenty of outdoor furnishings, and an infinity pool that could be directly accessed via another set of sliding doors from my bedroom; it was everything that I had dreamt of and more. I reclined in a chaise lounge and stared out into the Indian Ocean, taking in the magnificent scenery, listening to the laps of water that were splashing against the stilts that lofted my temporary abode. It quickly dawned on me that this was just what I needed after a few stressful months of nonstop work.\n\nBeing in a destination that fosters seclusion allowed me to finally feel alone—which is entirely different from being lonely—and at last I could hear my own thoughts. My brain was no longer racing a mile a minute; I could slow down. This was further reinforced when I hopped over to Four Seasons Maldives at Laanda Giraavaru, where I swam with manta rays and was so distracted by these large, magical creatures that the only thing I felt was unencumbered awe. The property also has an incredible and fully immersive Ayurvedic program that can help anyone get back on track, but I preferred to let nature do the healing for me."
