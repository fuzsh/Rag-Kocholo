        "text": "Captive Honeymoon!\n\nThis past weekend I attended a lovely morning wedding. The ceremony time was chosen, not because morning light is so beautiful, but so the couple could catch an early flight to their honeymoon destination. This made me wonder, where did the honeymoon tradition start?\n\nWeddings have taken place in some form or another since the beginning of history. However, I wondered if early honeymoons were like they are now. I doubt that past generations could afford to travel as we do now for our honeymoons. So I began my own journey to find the answer to \"where did the honeymoon tradition come from?\"\n\nIn my quest, I found it had to do with the “capture of the bride\" era. This era is known as marriage by capture and in some third world countries still takes place. Historically \"marriage by capture\" is roughly attributed to the 15th century and considered the beginning of the honeymoon concept. However, honeymoons may have occurred much early.\n\nThe honeymoon took place after the man captured or took his \"bride\". The \"groom\" would steal the \"bride\" away from her family and all others for a \"moon's time\" which is roughly 30 days. Hopefully during the thirty days, the bride would conceive a child. Forcing her family to “consent” to a marriage.\n\nWhy all the drama? For one, the groom was usually from another tribe and not likely to be given consented to marry the women. Kidnapping was a way to force the issue and the thirty days gave the \"groom\" time to persuade the family.\n\nWhy Honeymoon?\n\nDuring the 30 days of \"marriage by capture\", the groom would give his captured \"bride\" a drink of mead know as metheglin. Mead is a fermented drink of herbs and honey. This drink made from honey and given to the bride by her groom during a \"moons time\" gives us the word of honeymoon."
