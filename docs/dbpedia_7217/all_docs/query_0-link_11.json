        "text": "While many people spend their lives dreaming about their perfect wedding, it should come as no surprise that we’re more obsessed with honeymoon destinations. Your first official vacation as a married couple will be memorable no matter where you decide to go, but the occasion is the perfect excuse to splurge on an ultra-luxurious, once-in-a-lifetime trip.\n\nThat doesn’t necessarily mean you have to jet off to a remote island or faraway country, however. In fact, most newlyweds are probably too exhausted to hop on a long-haul flight right after they say “I do.” There are plenty of honeymoon destinations around the United States that lend themselves perfectly to post-wedding romance, whether you want to cozy up in a ski resort or spend your days swimming and snorkeling off a pristine beach. To help kickstart your planning, we rounded up some of the best honeymoon destinations in the USA, from classic picks like Hawaii to more unexpected spots like Watch Hill, Rhode Island.\n\nAll listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors.
