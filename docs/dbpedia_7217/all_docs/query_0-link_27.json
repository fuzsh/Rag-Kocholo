        "text": "Hoping to plan a romantic honeymoon in the United States but not sure where to start? From dazzling cities to jaw-droppingly beautiful mountains to some world-class beaches, the best honeymoon destinations in the USA are incredibly varied and truly offer something for every kind of couple.\n\nWe’ve put together this guide to the best honeymoon locations in the US to give you and your beloved plenty of ideas on where to go, all across the country.\n\nWe’ve also divided these romantic USA honeymoon spots (which vary from classic to quite offbeat) based on your interests, to help you quickly identify which American honeymoon is for you!\n\nBest Cozy + Romantic Honeymoons in the USA\n\nIf you’re looking for honeymoon locations in the United States that are cozy, romantic, and idyllic–think small towns and cities or beautiful nature that doesn’t require an epic hike or big drive to access–these honeymoons in the USA fit the bill.\n\nNantucket\n\nTiny, beautiful Nantucket is perfect for couples looking for a small island boasting both an adorable town center and beautiful beaches for their honeymoon.\n\nLocated off the coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Nantucket is a classic summer retreat and one of the best places to visit in New England.\n\nWhile you’re there, consider renting bikes to explore the island together, tracking down all three of Nantucket’s beautiful lighthouses, visiting the whaling museum, and of course, enjoying a lobster roll or two!\n\nWhere to Stay in Nantucket\n\nThe Cottages & Loft: For a cute homestay environment these lovely cottages are the perfect honeymoon accommodation in Nantucket. With a pretty deck overlooking the water, lots of light, beachy decor, and comfortable beds, these are a fantastic stay. There are also bikes free for hire, perfect for exploring the island!\n\nWhite Elephant Hotel: For some decadent hotel luxury this hotel is an amazing choice. Located right on the waters edge, with on site spa, huge bathrooms with deep bathtubs, stunning island views from every window, and giant beds. The hotel is next to some of the best restaurants in Nantucket as well as having it’s own excellent on site restaurant. Perfect for honeymoon indulgence!\n\nSavannah\n\nBeautiful Savannah, Georgia, with its incredible oak trees, ridiculously beautiful architecture, insanely delicious food scene, and slow-moving cadence, is one of our absolute favorite cities in the USA, and a ridiculously romantic one at that!\n\nSlowly strolling the squares hand-in-hand, exploring the wonderful restaurant scene, ducking into a house museum or two, and visiting beautiful spots like Forsyth Park are all romantic things to do in Savannah.\n\nIn addition to the beauty of the city, though, Savannah is also located next door to a lovely beach getaway on Tybee Island, adding another layer to your retreat.\n\nFor a slightly longer US honeymoon idea, you can even combine it with a visit to St. Augustine in northeastern Florida if you’d like to add even more beach time to your honeymoon!\n\nWhere to Stay in Savannah\n\nThe Marshall House: For your honeymoon in Savannah you absolutely have to stay in one of the historic houses, this hotel is a perfect choice. Built in 1851 this is a staple part of Savannah’s history, rooms are decadent and cozy, and the hotel offers a nightly wine reception in the library and cocktails in the bar.\n\nHampton Inn & Suites: Another wonderful hotel in Savannah’s historic district, this provides a modern refresh of a classic luxury hotel. Rooms are bright and comfortable, and a fabulous complimentary breakfast is served on the hotel terrace each morning.\n\nNew England Road Trip\n\nWith its charming small towns, lovely landscapes, and rugged coastline, New England in general makes a classic US honeymoon spot.\n\nWhile you can have an amazing honeymoon by simply choosing one adorable bed & breakfast and curling up for a week or two in Vermont, Maine, or elsewhere, you can also set off on a bit of an adventure and make a leisurely road trip of it.\n\nFrom beautiful Boston to the stunning White Mountains to Acadia National Park to the many lighthouses of the coast, a New England honeymoon can include a huge variety of destinations.\n\nAnd, if you and your beloved are scheduling a fall honeymoon and get to enjoy the region’s world-famous foliage, that’s all the better.\n\nWhere to Stay in New England\n\nBoston – Found Hotel Boston Common: This boutique hotel in the Theatre District is perfect for exploring Boston. Rooms are bright and comfortable, and there is access to public transport a short walk from the hotel.\n\nBurlington, Vermont – Green Mountain Suites Hotel: This stunning mountain style lodge is packed with amenities as well as luxurious bedrooms. Breakfast is also included in the restaurant overlooking the gardens.\n\nNiagara Falls\n\nDial it back a few decades, and Niagara Falls was the place to be on a honeymoon in North America–and while it’s less iconic on the honeymoon scene now, it’s still a wildly romantic place, and home to some very romantic resorts!\n\nWhile this blog post does cover honeymoon destinations in the USA specifically, I’d be remiss not to mention here that while the portion of Niagara Falls located in the States is lovely, it’s well worth bringing your passport along and crossing the border into Canada for a portion of your Niagara Falls honeymoon!\n\nHowever, with boat tours, hiking trails, Old Fort Niagara, the magnificent Cave of the Winds experience that will take you right up to Bridal Veils Falls (prepare to get soaked!), and more available on the New York side, it’s safe to say that even a strictly American honeymoon to Niagara Falls has plenty of romance to offer.\n\nWhere to Stay in Niagara Falls\n\nStateside – The Butler House: For classic honeymoon accommodation this is the one to go with in the American side of Niagara Falls. Built in 1910 is the historic craftsman style, this is a cute and cozy hotel for your honeymoon. Location wise you also can’t beat this, just 10 minutes walk from the American Falls and a mile from the International Rainbow Bridge to Canada.\n\nCanada – Hilton Fallsview: While not the greatest Hilton experience you might expect, but definitely worth it for the views. Expect the usual Hilton features of a good quality hotel but look over the as-close-as-you-could-get views of Niagara Falls.\n\nAsheville\n\nLocated on the edge of the phenomenal Great Smoky Mountains National Park and practically around the corner from the stunning Blue Ridge Parkway, Asheville, North Carolina, is the perfect place to escape for a honeymoon if you and your beloved want a solid mix of city and country options.\n\nAsheville’s hipster food and art scenes are legendary, allowing you to eat very well and enjoy life in a small city, but the hiking, white water rafting, and viewpoints nearby are also not to be missed.\n\nBe sure to also squeeze in a visit to the ridiculously opulent Biltmore Estate, which will make you briefly wonder if you had been transported across the pond to a European honeymoon after all.\n\nWhere to Stay in Asheville\n\nCedar Crest Inn: This pink 1891 mansion house is a perfect place to base yourself in Asheville. Packed with historical details and stunning architecture you can imagine it as a mini Biltmore.\n\nAloft: If your honeymoon includes your furry family member this is the most pet friendly place you would wish for. Dogs and cats stay for free and are provided with beds, treats and facilities, exactly as human guests would expect from a luxury hotel stay. Almost no area of the hotel is off limits to your pup, and the hotel also partners with a local shelter offering homes for dogs until they are adopted.\n\nMartha’s Vineyard\n\nFeaturing plenty of sandy beaches, charming lighthouses, and quaint towns, idyllic Martha’s Vineyard–located off the southern coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts–makes a fabulous honeymoon for couples looking for a classic and charming New England getaway!\n\nIn many ways, Martha’s Vineyard is a similar honeymoon location to Nantucket, but Martha’s Vineyard’s larger size means there is more to explore (though on the flip side, it also takes a bit more effort to get around.\n\nWhere to Stay in Martha’s Vineyard\n\nNarragansett House: This pretty Victorian house is a perfect place for your honeymoon in Martha’s Vineyard. With cute beachy decor, cozy beds, and views to the beach this is the perfect place to pass lazy honeymoon days.\n\nThe Attleboro House: Another quintessential Victoria property in Oak Bluffs is this hotel with views directly over the beach where the boats come in. Rooms are delightfully old-fashioned, many with lovely wooden features and quirky windows to take in the views.\n\nCharleston\n\nLocated just two hours north of Savannah, the coastal city of Charleston is known for its architectural beauty, celebrated food scene, excellent nearby beaches, and intense history–especially in both the American Revolutionary War and the Civil War.\n\nOften compared to its neighbor Savannah, Charleston is also incredibly charming, but actually feels incredibly different, with a coastal vibe accented by its many palm trees.\n\nFor honeymooners looking for a laid-back, slow-moving USA honeymoon spot in the south that combines a charming city with plenty of beach time (Folly Beach, Sullivan’s Island, and the Isle of Palms are all nearby), Charleston is an excellent option.\n\nWhere to Stay in Charleston\n\nMarket Pavillion Hotel: This hotel is a stunning honeymoon choice in the heart of the historical district. Rooms feature four poster beds and charming classic decor, but the hotel amenities are really special with a mosaic pool and even its own Executive Pastry Chef whipping up delicious pastries for breakfast.\n\nFrench Quarter Inn: Another fabulous historical hotel is this one in the french quarter overlooking Charleston City Market. You are welcomed with champagne on arrival, there is also a port wine and cheese reception and freshly baked cookies with milk are served every evening. The perfect treats for your honeymoon! Rooms are vintage inspired and really beautiful. This is the loveliest spot for your honeymoon in Charleston.\n\nBest Tropical Honeymoon Destinations in the USA\n\nYou don’t have to skip off to Asia or Latin America to find a fantastic tropical honeymoon!\n\nThese USA honeymoon destinations feature warm, humid climates, excellent beaches, and (in most cases) jungles as well!\n\nHawaii\n\nThe archipelago of Hawaii–and especially its four main tourism islands of Kauai, Maui, Oahu, and the island of Hawai’i (generally referred to as the Big Island)–is one of the most classic honeymoon destinations in the USA, and definitely one worth considering!\n\nUnderstandably, choosing exactly which island(s) to visit as part of your Hawaii itinerary can often be just as hard as narrowing down your US honeymoon location to Hawaii.\n\nHowever, whether you want to go hiking on Kauai, drive the Road to Hana on Maui, check out the otherworldly Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island, watch the sunset on iconic Waikiki Beach on Oahu, or some combination thereof, a Hawaii honeymoon has something spectacular to offer.\n\nWhere to Stay in Hawaii\n\n‘Alohilani Resort: This stunninng resort on Waikiki Beach is perfect for your honeymoon. Rooms are luxurious with unobstructed views of the Pacific Ocean and Diamond Head. Relax in privacy in the cabanas around the pool and dance the night away at beach events.\n\nTurtle Bay Resort: Spanning the tip of Oahu’s North Shore this is a great place for seclusion and acres of incredible beaches, right at the door. There are also private bungalow options tucked away for ultimate honeymoon privacy.\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nWant to honeymoon on a Caribbean island without dusting off your passport (or applying for one)?\n\nConsider Puerto Rico!\n\nLocated due east of the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico is home to a stunning coastline, an incredible rainforest, a delightful and colorful city in Old San Juan, and idyllic beach retreats like the small island of Vieques.\n\nPlus, as a US territory, is incredibly simple for US citizens to visit, as no passport is required, the currency is USD, and generally, even your cell phone will work without issue.\n\nWhere to Stay in Puerto Rico\n\nO:Live Boutique Hotel: This small luxury hotel is catered perfectly for couples looking for romance, rooms have huge bathtubs on the terraces and if you book a suite you also get a rain shower with hydromassage jets. If that isn’t enough water for you there is an infinity pool on the rooftop overlooking the Condado Lagoon.\n\nRoyal Isabela: Set on the cliffs of the Caribbean coast offering private cottages with stunning sea views, this hotel is the perfect tranquil retreat away for your honeymoon. The site has a fabulous swimming pool, or you can book your stay in a casita that has it’s own pool, so you never have to leave!\n\nSouth Florida\n\nFrom the vibrant Art Deco architecture of Miami to the tranquil beauty of the Keys, southern Florida makes a fantastic honeymoon location in the United States!\n\nWith plenty of sandy beaches, palm trees, delicious food, and world-class road trip views, a south Florida honeymoon has something to offer any couple looking for a little sunshine and warm air–there’s a reason it’s one of the most beloved places to visit in the south!\n\nConsider starting your honeymoon in beautiful Miami, and spending a few days exploring the metropolis before hopping in a car and driving down to the whimsical towns and beautiful beaches of the Florida Keys–a route that is often considered one of the most beautiful road trips in the country!\n\nFor another romantic Florida honeymoon option, head due west from Miami in southeast Florida to Marco Island on Florida’s southwest Gulf coast for a completely unique and oh-so-romantic south Florida experience.\n\nAs the gateway to (and the largest of) the Ten Thousand Islands, Marco Island is a water-lovers paradise and a perfect island-y honeymoon destination where newlyweds can boat or kayak to nearby uninhabited islands and sand bars and have the entire beach to themselves for the day.\n\nGiven its small size, there are plenty of acclaimed restaurants on Marco Island and luxury beachfront hotels to choose from, all surrounded by the wondrous Everglades ecosystem.\n\nWhere to Stay in South Florida\n\nMiami – The Betsy Hotel: Rooftop pool, marble bathrooms with deep tubs, a stylish cocktail lounge and spacious private balconies, this hotel is a great choice for your honeymoon.\n\nMarco Island – Olde Marco Island Inn and Suites: This Victorian style inn is perfect for island honeymooning, book a suites for a private lanai and garden views. Rooms also have private kitchens, the suites have stunning family style kitchens if cooking is on the menu for your honeymoon!\n\nIncredible Big City Honeymoon Ideas in the US\n\nIf you’re the kind of couple to dream of city lights, skyscrapers, and phenomenal dining during your romantic getaway, these great honeymoon spots in the USA are for you.\n\nNew York City\n\nIconic NYC has been a classic honeymoon spot in the United States for decades, but it still holds true: if your idea of the most romantic things to do includes exchanging a kiss at the top of the Empire State Building or paddling a rowboat in Central Park, a romantic New York getaway is a perfect choice.\n\nNYC offers an almost overwhelming number of options for honeymoon activities, but it’s safe to say that city lovers, foodies, museum hoppers, theater fans, and more will all find something to love about spending their first days of marriage traipsing through New York.\n\nWhere to Stay in New York City\n\nThe Plaza Hotel: For a memorable place to stay, this is one of the most classic and luxurious hotels in New York. It is located right by Central Park, the Rockefeller Center, and some of NYC’s most popular museums.\n\nThe Renwick: Offering stylish residential style accommodation, this beautiful hotel is equipped with plenty of amenities and high class comfort. It is also a short walk to the Empire State Building and Bryant Park for exploring.\n\nLas Vegas\n\nShows, shopping, and plenty of gambling: Las Vegas is nothing if not a playground for adults, and that makes it an excellent USA honeymoon destination for couples interested in all kinds of nightlife.\n\nWhile Vegas may be known for its nighttime escapades, though, there’s plenty to keep you busy during the day, too, from pool parties to incredible desert day trips.\n\nWant some memorable honeymoon photos?\n\nThose quirky drive-thru chapels and get-married-by-Elvis elopement options aren’t legally binding (though since you likely have “get marriage license” somewhere on a wedding to-do list right now, that’s probably not a surprise)–they do make fun photos to look back on, though, and can be a funny addition to a honeymoon in Vegas!\n\nWhere to Stay in Las Vegas\n\nThe Venetian: As one of the most iconic hotels on the Las Vegas strip this is a fabulous choice for your honeymoon.
