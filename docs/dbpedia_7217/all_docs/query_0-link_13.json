Essential information: It gets *blazing* hot here in the summer—plan accordingly.\n\nRomantic stay: The city's signature red rocks are on full display at . You can peep 'em while swimming in the pool, lounging on your balcony, sitting by the fire pit, or cuddling up on a hammock.\n\nExcursion for two: Play sommelier for the day (is that passionfruit you taste?) at the Verde Valley Wine Trail, set between some of the desert's most famous rock formations. Many chauffeured tours start in Sedona and shuttle you to multiple vineyards.\n\nFor a memorable meal: The babbling water of Oak Creek will serenade you as you chow down at , which has some 💣 bankside seating.\n\nMust pack: Cute, but sturdy, hiking boots.\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nReal ones know that NOLA isn't just cool during Mardis Gras. It's a city with jaw-dropping architecture and history you actually want to learn about (no, really), plus celebratory vibes all the dang time. Here's how I picture your honeymoon: holding hands while walking through the many lush gardens, cheers-ing Sazerac cocktails in honor of doin' the damn thing, and sharing powdered sugar-dusted smooches while chomping on some beignets. S'cute! Pro tip: Visit between December and May for the best weather (the humidity is not ideal in any other month).\n\nRomantic stay: Okay, you have to admit, the stay on Airbnb is straight-up sexy. The moody color palette…the rain shower…the absurdly beautiful front walk-up…I'm in love.\n\nExcursion for two: Take a night to bar hop between live jazz joints. Make sure you stop by the famous Mother-in-Law Lounge for a super on-brand experience (ya know, because you have in-laws now!).\n\nFor a memorable meal: Tucked inside a 19th-century Creole cottage, (with a yummy American-style menu) will make you feel elegant as hell. Ask for a table in the courtyard if the weather is being nice.\n\nMust pack: A fanny pack or sling bag for hands-free drinking in the streets (yeah, it’s legal there! One Hurricane to go, plz and thx!).\n\nCape Cod, Massachusetts\n\nBrunch. Beach. Boat. Booze. Another Beach. Beach Bar. Another Bar. Bedtime. That's the winning schedule for a honeymoon here. Known for being luxurious, yet laid-back, the Cape Cod peninsula (made up of several small towns and villages) is where East Coasters flock to in the summer months for seafood shacks, quirky art galleries, and local festivals. Honeymooners can join in on the fun any time of year, but summer and early fall are when it truly shines. Day tripping to nearby Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, or Provincetown (or a combination of the three!) is also a must to get the true New England experience.\n\nRomantic stay: The is the place to be. You and your new spouse can treat yourselves to a \"Some Like it Hot\" couples massage in the Duet Suite or hit the only Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course on the Cape. Unwind at the end of the day with a private beach fire and a drink from the resort's Beach Bar.\n\nExcursion for two: See the Cape from alllll angles by skydiving out of the Airfield in Barnstable. You'll see all the surrounding islands and the Boston skyline on your way down.\n\nFor a memorable meal: Located in a former blacksmith shop (that's hot!), now slings sophisticated seafood dishes and killer burgers.\n\nMust pack: Airy sundresses for seamless beach-to-dinner action.\n\nAspen, Colorado\n\nAsk your partner right now: \"Would you prefer to hit the beach or the slopes?\" If they tell you the latter—and you're on board…no pun intended—scope out Aspen. A favorite of the Real Housewives, Aspen attracts snow bunnies with its mountain conditions, but you could spend an entire visit just snuggling up by the fire at a chic après-ski spot. Aspen is also equally beautiful in the summer months—you'll just be hiking those pretty peaks instead of slaloming down them.\n\nRomantic stay: is pretty $$$, but it's Aspen's only five-star ski-in/ski-out hotel...and you only honeymoon once, I guess?\n\nExcursion for two: Escape the cold with a visit to the Aspen Art Museum. Admission is free (!), so you can spend more money on hot toddies.\n\nFor a memorable meal: Get your sushi fix at , a fancy eatery from Chef Nobu (yes, that Nobu), located in a historic Victorian house.\n\nMust pack: Chic ski gear, obviously!!\n\nHonolulu, Hawaii\n\nI mean…it's Hawaii. It's hard to compete with that ish. Honolulu makes a great home base when visiting popular destinations, like Pearl Harbor, Waikiki Beach, and Diamond Head. Whether you are into high-adrenaline activities, like surfing and skydiving, or would rather plop your booties on the beach all day with piña coladas in both hands, you won't be bored. Trust.\n\nRomantic stay: Ummm, let's just say the ocean will literally be your backyard at . You should also be obsessed with them for their dedication to preserving the island's land and culture for future generations.\n\nExcursion for two: Helicopter rides are a Bachelor franchise staple for a reason: romahnce. Book a trip to see Oahu's volcanic landscape from above.\n\nFor a memorable meal: Takeout can be fancy too! Order a few plates to share from , a roadside seafood shop on the coast, and carry them over to the water for a picnic.\n\nMust pack: A waterproof camera or phone pouch for worry-free ocean shots.\n\nAnchorage, Alaska\n\nFor people who'd rather go fishing than get a massage, the largest city in Alaska is the perfect place to start an adventurous honeymoon. Fly in and explore the Wildlife Conservation Center and the food scene for a day or two before trekking off to more remote parts of the state. Consider hiking in Kenai Fjords National Park or exploring the ice caves at the Mendenhall Glacier.\n\nRomantic stay: Avoid most human interaction by booking a package at Wilderness Place Lodge—and opt for a personalized nature excursion. It's not actually in Anchorage, but all packages start with a short flight from there.\n\nExcursion for two: Have a whale of a time (yes, I'm saying this unironically) on a quaint whale-watching trip. They're typically out and about between May and September.\n\nFor a memorable meal: Scarf down fresh local seafood at , located inside the popular .\n\nMust pack: Layers upon layers upon layers.\n\nNew York, New York\n\nGetting lost on vacation isn't always fun, but it is when it's in the 🎶 concrete jungle dreams are made of 🎶 ! Couples who aren't afraid of crowds will thrive in NYC, with people-watching ops aplenty and things to see, eat, and do around every turn. No matter what neighborhood you stay in (don't be afraid of Brooklyn either!), the subway takes you anywhere you want to go. Don't blame me if you never want to go back home.\n\nRomantic stay: The views may take your breath away forever at , an expertly designed and surprisingly affordable hotel near Madison Square Park.\n\nExcursion for two: Take a jet ski ride around Manhattan for the best views of the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge, and more. (One of my favorite birthday gifts ever!)\n\nFor a memorable meal: on 52nd Street is a *classic* New York steakhouse perfect for dinner before a Broadway show. It's been serving up strong cocktails and hickory coal-fired filet mignons since 1927, and TBH, you should get one of each.\n\nMust pack: An eye mask and ear plugs. Especially if you're staying near Times Square.\n\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\n\nRemember how I said your wedding can leave you feeling winded? Well, this is the place to get some delicious alpine air in your thirsty, thirsty lungs. Prepare to get your horse girl on at this popular honeymoon destination, where winding rivers, sprawling mountains, and endless natural landscapes make you feel like you live in a postcard. Visit in the winter to take advantage of the fresh pow and peaks (snow much fun!), or jet in for a summery escape with trails galore. Be sure to visit one of the two nearby national parks—Yellowstone and Grand Teton—and embrace what Mama Nature gave ya (bonus points if you spot an elk!).\n\nRomantic stay: If there were ever a time to splurge on a stay, it would be at , a celeb-favorite resort with views of the Grand Tetons and Snake River.\n\nExcursion for two: Pack a gourmet picnic and eat it overlooking Jenny Lake in Grand Teton National Park. Look up Inspiration Point for a hike with great lookout spots.\n\nFor a memorable meal: If you can't afford to book a room at the fancy schmancy Four Seasons, book a table at its restaurant, , instead. The lodge-like steakhouse has a dining room with a giant stone fireplace and massive windows overlooking Rendezvous Peak."
