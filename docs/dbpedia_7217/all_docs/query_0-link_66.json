        "text": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Submit questions here. (It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy husband and I have been married for three years and been together five all together. He has a 15-year-old and an 8-year-old. We have them alternating weeks. The kids are great, but we got married during a COVID scare, so basically no wedding and honeymoon. We each get two weeks of vacation at our jobs and every hour is spent on a family vacation. This year, a college friend invited us to visit her in Germany. It would essentially be a 12-day trip where we could explore Europe. Her husband has a family that offered to host us for a night or two in Italy. It is a dream come true for us; only, the enthusiasm of my husband is circling the drain.\n\nHis kids are whining about going to their grandparents while we are going to Europe. Neither has passports and we already have tickets, but my husband has been making excuses about rescheduling for next year and having us go to the beach with the kids instead. I am absolutely livid! This is a one-time offer, I took extra shifts to save for this, and I want my honeymoon! We had a big fight where he called me “selfish” and said I wasn’t putting the kids first. I told him to find his backbone and he shouldn’t have married me if I was always going to be second place in his priorities. The kids getting their needs first is obviously important, but no kid needs a trip to Europe, and not on a honeymoon.\n\nI am driving a 16-year-old car because we couldn’t afford an additional car payment when my stepdaughter needed more expensive braces. My parents went on trips without us kids. My sister and brother do it with their spouses. Many times, we have taken on the kids of friends because they wanted to go into the city overnight. His ex left the kids with us four times last year when she went to weddings/girl trips/Mexico, etc. I am not asking for my husband to move heaven and earth here. He is usually good at keeping boundaries with the kids on things like eating your veggies or doing their homework, but this is just so out of bounds it is in another zip code. I want to see my friend. I am going on this trip. I just don’t know what I am coming back to. Help!\n\n—No Honey on this Honeymoon\n\nDear No Honey,\n\nIt’s not helpful for me to sit here now, three years into your marriage, and say you should have had an in-depth conversation, before you tied the knot, about what “the kids getting their needs first” would look like in action. Because everyone approaches parenting and time with their children differently. In fact, a recent useless internet rabbit hole that I thoroughly explored when I should have been sleeping involved the comments on a video in which a couple celebrated the fact that they could enjoy date night while their children hung out at the kids’ club on a cruise. In the responses, I saw one group responding incredulously to the idea of not wanting the most possible time with their kids on vacation, and another group proclaiming that they only saw their children at dinner while cruising and everyone loved it. I don’t think members of either camp were wrong. But they probably shouldn’t marry each other.\n\nI don’t think your husband is somehow a boundary-challenged pushover to question whether he wants to give up an annual vacation with his kids, who he only sees half the time as it is, or to struggle with the idea of hurting their feelings. Nor are you wrong for thinking a visit to grandma sounds entirely reasonable. So don’t fight about the parenting side of this. It doesn’t matter what your parents did or what your sister and brother do. His relationship with his kids has nothing to do with those choices, and you’re not going to convince him to value their feelings or his time with them less by telling him what other people with different priorities did.\n\nWhere you might be able to move the needle is by reminding him of his commitment to you. He agreed to this trip and you planned for it, and to back out would be to seriously disappoint you and go back on his word. Framing it like this, encouraging him to think about what he owes you and how he is or isn’t nurturing your relationship (rather than what the two of you together owe his kids) might clarify for him that his children aren’t the only people in his life who have feelings and needs.\n\nIf he refuses to go, you two have a lot to talk about when you get back. But make sure it’s about his inability to show up for you, not a critique of how he chooses to be a dad.\n\nGot a question about kids, parenting, or family life? Submit it to Care and Feeding!\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy husband lost his first wife and their two young daughters in a car crash before I had even met him. Right now, I’m pregnant with our first and struggling with the emotions surrounding it. My mother-in-law and sisters-in-law will bring up his late wife and her experiences in casual conversation, and it is just emotional whiplash for me. I want my first pregnancy to be a positive experience, and every time her name comes up, I am reminded that my happiness with my husband came at such a horrible cost. I don’t want to erase my husband’s past or pretend like his late wife and girls didn’t exist, but any time I try to articulate my feelings, it comes out wrong. What do I do here?\n\n—Struggling\n\nDear Struggling,\n\nThis is really hard, and I want to make sure I don’t give you advice that makes it harder by causing a divide between you and your in-laws, or giving them a reason to see you as insensitive to their loss. But I also don’t want you to be in emotional distress during your pregnancy! So I think the best approach has two parts.\n\nFirst, you need a short-term plan to decrease the number of upsetting comments you hear without giving them any reason to believe you want to erase the memory of your husband’s ex and children. This will mean putting a slight “It’s not you it’s me” spin on your request. I’m thinking something like this: “I’ve been so emotional while I’m pregnant. I don’t know if it’s the fact that we’re starting a family or the hormones but I just find myself crying uncontrollably when I think about Jim losing Megan and the girls. I think I have a deeper appreciation for what all of you went through and the depth of the tragedy as I imagine having my own baby.”\n\nThen give them a chance to talk about it, at that moment. Ask questions. Offer empathy. Later, have a similar conversation with your husband and assure him that you don’t want to erase his past but are struggling to manage the sadness around this, in your vulnerable and sensitive state. Ask him if he could ask his mother and sister to give you a heads up—a trigger warning of sorts—before they bring up his late wife and kids, rather than dropping their names into casual conversation. They might receive this better coming from him, and I’m hopeful that an awareness of how the topic affects you will make them hesitate before they bring it up as often.\n\nSecond, you need a long-term plan to actually be okay with hearing these names, without having negative feelings about how your relationship came to be. I do think that when you decided to be in a relationship with a widower, part of the deal was that he (and his family) might want to talk about the people they lost—possibly forever! So obviously the healthiest way to be in this marriage is to reframe the way you think about how you and your husband got here in a way that isn’t upsetting. This is definitely therapy territory. With support, I can imagine you getting to a place where instead of thinking “This is a reminder that my happiness with my husband came at a terrible cost,” you might think something like “This is a reminder of how lucky my husband and I are to have each other, how fleeting life is, and how we really need to treasure every moment, even when our day-to-day life as parents feels tough.”\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m trying to balance complicated family obligations. My dad planned a trip for his 70th birthday, three nights and four days, but centered around a casino and special restaurants that don’t really accept kids. I’m a single mom of a 7-year-old, and his dad is a somewhat functioning alcoholic. He has him one night a week, and mostly holds it together for him. My son isn’t aware of any of this. If his dad tries to have him two nights in a row there’s always some excuse as to why he can’t stay. It’s sort of an unspoken agreement that I’m there no matter what, and lately he’s struggling and seems depressed. He’s short tempered and fairly authoritarian in his parenting.\n\nI initially agreed to join my parents and two sisters, but immediately began to have trepidation, as there’s no one else that can ensure my son will be safe and well cared for. We could add that I have flight anxiety but the main impact of that is that my family thinks I’m just coming up with reasons not to go. I’m super stressed and burned out, and can’t imagine feeling at ease while I’m not within driving distance of my son. My dad has health problems, and tends to put things very black and white as if this is the last possible family trip we could ever take. I don’t want to have regrets, and chances are everything could be okay if I go, but I just don’t feel comfortable. There’s also some sibling drama, they are impatient with my anxiety and also think I’m too focused on my son, etc. I won’t be supported if I’m anxious; I can’t please everyone, but I want to avoid regrets.\n\n—No Fight Left\n\nDear No Fight Left,\n\nYour son comes first. And he definitely comes before people who are impatient and unsupportive of you. Also, you are allowed to pass on things (yes, including your dad’s way-too-long, guilt trip fueled 70th birthday extravaganza) because they don’t sound good, don’t work for your lifestyle, or would make you unhappy, even if you don’t have a reason as weighty as protecting the well-being of a small child. The only apology you owe your parents and siblings is for agreeing to go and then changing your mind. The conversation could go something like this:\n\nYou: “I’m not going to be able to make the casino trip after all, because I’m not comfortable leaving Jack with his dad for more than one night. Dad, let’s get together to celebrate before or after. And let me know if I owe you any money for the flight or hotel.”\n\nYour family: “You’re so neurotic, of course you can leave him.”/ “Why are you being so selfish?”/ “You need help!” /“Do you realize I might never have another birthday?”/ “You are breaking your father’s heart.”\n\nYou: I know we don’t see eye to eye on this but I’m going to have to put my son first. Dad, I believe you have many more happy years with us and I’m looking forward to giving you your gift. Just let me know when. And I can’t wait to see pictures from the trip. Goodbye.\n\nCatch up on this week’s Prudie.\n\nMore Advice From Slate"
