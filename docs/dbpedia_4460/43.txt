Berlin-Pankow is a station on the Berlin–Szczecin railway, situated in Berlin's Pankow district. It is served by the S-Bahn lines S2, S8 and S9 and is the northern terminus of the U-Bahn line U2. But the next extension could terminate at Ossietzkyplatz.

The station opened on October 15, 1880 south of the former Pankow village. It soon was named Pankow-Schönhausen after the neighbouring Schönhausen Palace. The entrance building was rebuilt in 1911 with the establishment of the suburban railway toward Bernau, which would become the first line of the Berlin S-Bahn on August 8, 1924. The station was renamed Berlin-Pankow in 1954.

As since 1930 the northern terminus of the U2 U-Bahn line was nearby Vinetastraße an extension toward Pankow had been planned since then though works were not carried out until 1997. The new terminus was opened on September 16, 2000.
