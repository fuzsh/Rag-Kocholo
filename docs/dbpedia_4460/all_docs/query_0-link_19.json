        "text": "The Quebec Harbour Authority is poised to launch major investments including a Post-Panamax containers terminal. The harbour is a key component in the historical development of Quebec City, but since the rise of containerisation in the 1960's, the urban relationship with the harbour has remained distant. Current planning of new infrastructure and transformation of underused industrial sites has revealed a contentious attitude between the Harbour administration's global ambitions and the welfare of local citizens and the surrounding neighbourhoods. The White Birch Pulp and Paper Mill, clustered between the city and the harbour, is a case in point for investigation of the opportunities offered by brownfield regeneration for renewed urban ecosystems reinvesting built heritage. A morphological investigation is conducted towards the goal of developing a coherent design option. This paper pursues three levels of analysis. First, it addresses the paradigm shift from the segregation and specialisation of industrial land use towards a spatial and social local integration. Second, it explores the development potential of industrial \"superlots\". Thirdly, it confronts the issue of assessing the capability of inherited components-those that are obsolete, to be replaced or to be restored. The design proposal underlines the importance of assessing built environments as a tangible mediation between the global requirements of international shipping and local interest in improvements to urban life. Nadon-Roger, M., & Dufaux, F. (2020). Waterfront Brownfields : The Challenges of Quebec City’s Industrial and Harbour Regeneration. PORTUSplus, 10.\n\nThe thesis is discussing the concepts of brownfields regeneration as an approach to achieve sustainable urban development. The research deals with different layers of complexity of sustainable urban regeneration as a process, and brownfields as sites. It analyzes some case studies, moreover it attempts to build on existing worldwide experience of brownfields regeneration strategies, and investigate the principles of sustainable urban planning strategy. The research main goal is to suggest a conceptual framework for dealing with the process of redeveloping brownfields in the Egyptian context, especially in Greater Cairo cities. The research addresses how brownfields regeneration could be considered as a main approach to achieve more sustainable strategic development in G.C.R. This thesis consists of six chapters. Starting with an introductory chapter, followed by the theoretical part, which consists of two chapters. It presents a theoretical review that discusses different concepts of brownfields sustainable regeneration. In addition, it reviews the complexity of brownfields sustainable regeneration and related issues in complex urban systems .It investigates the impact of brownfields regeneration on urban environment, the challenges and driving forces that could affect the process of brownfields regeneration. The analytical part including (chapter four and five) presents different examples of practices in different countries, and cities, recognized benefits, challenges Many cases for a number of projects that have been recognized as examples of sustainable brownfield regeneration. Moreover, it investigates the current conditions of brownfields in Greater Cairo contexts and relevant developmental approaches. Finally, the research proposes a suggested conceptual framework in which brownfields could be integrated strategically in urban development goals. The research ends with conclusions and recommendations related to brownfields regeneration, that can offer the opportunity to promote sustainable, feasible projects that revitalize Egyptian cities.\n\nThis study presents some general aspects of brownfields from definition to assessment methods. There are several approaches to define brownfield, but there is a common agreement among researchers on its typology. The economic and environmental aspects as evaluating methods depend on the varying revitalisation goals. But our goal is to analyse the different tools in order to find the best method for evaluation of environmental and sustainability state of the sub region and settlements in the North Hungary region. Among the available numerous tools SWOT analysis, Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), utility based evaluation, indicator based sustainability assessment can be mentioned as most significant. In this paper we introduce the major evaluating processes and the risks of brownfield revitalisation, the rehabilitation possibilities and remediation. INTRODUCTION The problem solution of brownfield requires an interdisciplinary approach. It needs the harmonised approach of the natural scienc...\n\nBrownfields represent tremendous opportunities for redevelopment , particularly in locations close to the old city centers. These post-industrial sites are considered unused gaps with a very vital and important location inside the city. In Egypt, independent projects attempted to utilize these sites without a comprehensive approach for the optimal intervention with those sites. Different state governments identified various redevelopment aspects to deal with those sites, while others restrict the development to particular uses in order to minimize exposure to leftover containments on-site. In Egypt, Brownfields occupies various sites at different locations; these locations sometimes are unique for the development process for their locative potential as waterfronts, central business district or locations near by main transportation axes in the city, including excellent chances for redevelopment and, therefore, a key aspect of the success of redevelopment of these sites depends on the success of its spaces utilizations. This research is an attempt to explore all aspects affecting the re-exploitation of brownfields sites inside Egyptian cities that can contribute to a strategy of redevelopment of the brownfields sites and their surroundings.\n\nAs many other Western cities Budapest has been experiencing economic, political and social restructuring in the 1990s that has resulted in abandoned and underused areas – brownfields. “Transition zone,” “brown zone”, or sometimes also “rust zone” are just some of the various terms that have been used to describe the industrial areas in Budapest, located between city center and periphery (Kiss, 2007). These areas are a result of specific long­, middle­ and short­term processes, partly resembling restructuring of other European cities, partly other Post­Socialist cities and partly influenced by Hungarian historical, political, social and economic context. Municipalities and developers are inclined to discuss and approach brownfields as plots of unused land, despite the fact that they are usually (under­)used by transition economy. Redevelopment plans thus usually ignore the existing social, economic and political relations on these sites and envision only megalomaniac ideas for these ­ in their understanding ­ tabulae rasae.\n\nMalaysia’s modern urban growth, development and urbanisation experiences may be conveniently periodised into three major periods, based on the form, structure and functions of the urban centres. . In Malaysia, given the growing conditions of neglect and degradation of the cities centers. Since most Malaysian city centers are very old historical cities and seem to be rediscovering now the economic value of creative industries and culture. Urban revitalization and regeneration together with the issues of energy sustainability and the need to reduce pollutant emissions, are today the major challenges facing the planning of cities. The concept of urban regeneration in Malaysia’s cities to promote a “return to the city”, revitalise the city centre, restore activity in a fiercely competitive international context, and implement initiatives to improve the quality of the environment operating in a wide sense towards a smart growth. Urban regeneration is more than just upgrading the physical environment of an area to hopefully spark private investment. However one of most critical issue in urban regeneration is gentrification. This should not be happening in the true spirit of urban revitalization. Instead of displacing the existing community, they should be relocated to the same site. Therefore urban regeneration processes accomplishes the growing importance in literature of concepts like territorial governance, institutional relational density, creativity, social capital, city branding, city image and place marketing. Kuala Lumpur City Hall is among the municipalities practices urban regeneration by recognizing it as one of the strategic directions the city will take in an effort to encourage more sustainable lifestyles. Keywords : urban revitalization, urban regeneration, gentrification, public participation\n\nIn this paper we discuss these topics in four main parts: in the first section we will summarise the historical origins of brownfields in Budapest and subsequently describe three main brownfield zones in Budapest (northern, southern, eastern) and their sectoral, ownership and environmental characteristics. In the third section we take a closer look at one of the brownfield areas namely, the former Ganz factory in Józsefváros that is spontaneously being redeveloped by several Chinese sellers and investors. We believe this example is a good case study on the challenges and failures of predominant mainstream approach toward brownfield redevelopment as it does not take into account the existing transition (often gray or informal) economy and put all the hopes into the idea of largescale redevelopment. Last section is thus a critical examination of Budapest’s brownfield redevelopment strategy. We end the paper with some general policy recommendations regarding the redevelopment of brownfield in Józsefváros."
