        "text": "New sustainable neighbourhood developments are multiplying worldwide. Embedded in these model neighbourhoods are not only particular ideas about better urban form, but also particular ideas about better organization of urban life and social development. Frameworks, certifications, and labels to organize the practice of sustainable neighbourhood development are proliferating almost as rapidly as the developments themselves, and each holds a different mix of such ideas. Beginning from a typology of seven extreme types of ecourbanism, we consider the implications of pursuing each extreme for the key actors who assume different roles in planning, building, and living in these new neighbourhoods. We then consider two different ecourban neighbourhood frameworks, the Living Community Challenge and EcoDistricts Protocol. We examine these frameworks in terms of our seven extreme types of ecourbanism, as technologies of ecourbanism that have emerged in order to facilitate the mainstreaming and generalization of experimental ecourban development practices. Building upon a conceptual framework of transition theory and urban assemblages, we see the emergence of such new frameworks as mobilizing different assemblages of actors, via the crucial work of intermediary institutions, in order to move ecourban neighbourhood development from a niche practice to the mainstream. Better understanding the mixtures of actors’ roles and responsibilities, and expectations and practices promoted in different frameworks, will help us better understand the prospects of ecourban developments under different frameworks, in different urban contexts, at different stages of development, and different scales of experimentation and standardization.\n\nCities have always been important to processes of globalization and global change, past and present. Cities were the loci of empires, at least going back to the period when the Romans declared urbis et orbis — the City of Rome and the Orb of the World are one. In the sixteenth century the City of Seville witnessed the return of the sailing vessel Victoria, carrying the first humans to circumnavigate the globe. From the nineteenth century to early twentieth century, the City of London was the centre of an empire that colonized more than a quarter of the total land-area of the earth. Following the Spanish Empire's use of the same epithet, London described itself as the metropole of an empire upon which the sun never set. While some writers give the impression that 'global cities' are a twentieth-century phenomenon and the movement of finance capital predominantly defines their global status, the globalization of all cities has been intensifying across a very long history. Nevertheless, while globalization and urbanization have been intertwined for centuries, there are a number of changes that suggest a qualitative shift across the last four or five decades. All of these developments have had a profound effect on social life. In this paper I want to examine each of these four domains of social life a little more closely and show that in each case there are no simple answers. Rather we are confronted by paradoxes, quandaries and cross-cutting challenges that require a different way of thinking about alternatives. First I want to draw out a few of these paradoxes. I will then use the same approach to suggest an integrated set of principles for making better cities. The approach taken here is called ‘Engaged Research’. It takes seriously the idea that social life is multifarious and cannot be reduced to the dominance of economic considerations nor to global imperatives. Because social life is complex, layered and changing, engaged research involves long-term exploration of the intersections of various conjunctural and contingent conditions of existence—cultural, economic, political and ecological."
