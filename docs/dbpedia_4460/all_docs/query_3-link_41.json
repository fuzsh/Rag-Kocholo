        "text": "The steam would scream and the line would whine as trains wheels hit the steel tracks to speed precious cargo to their destinations. Like a scene from Thomas the Tank Engine, a traffic of steam trains would be noisily going about their business at the freight depot and marshalling yard in Pankow-Heinersdorf. There may well have even been a Fat Controller, or Sir Topham Hatt if you watched Thomas in the USA, overseeing the animated scene! But the anthropomorphised steam train would be very sad to see the sorry state of the now left for scrap Güterbahnhof.\n\nBefore we get too tunnel visioned, lets take a journey to the other side of the tracks in Berlin-Rummelsburg for some context. As you may remember from a previous article, the Rundlokschuppen Rummelsburg, a roundhouse engine shed, was constructed in 1875, serving as transportation system at the entrance to Berlin, the capital of newly unified Germany. On the other side of Berlin is Heinersdorf, which at the time was not yet connected to the city. At first glance it may appear strange that a whole railyard would suddenly appear in such a location, but in 1843 a transportation system connecting Berlin to Stettin (used to be a city in Germany, now a city in Poland), called the Berlin-Stettin railway, was constructed. With this there was, over the course of time, the need to be able to maintain, store and repair trains in the area which was, you’ve guessed it, Pankow-Heinersdorf. Imagine if they had to travel all the way to Rundlokschuppen Rummelsburg! I guess you would have to say it’s about the journey and not the destination, but this would not adhere to the German mantra of efficiency.\n\nThe freight depot with marshalling yard was up and running by 1904. At the beginning, only the roundhouse engine shed and some of the office buildings stood on the 250,000 square meter area. The Rundlokschuppen with its turntable for the steam trains unable to reverse or drive backwards could hold up to 24 trains and the roof of the roundhouse engine shed had an impressive dome measuring 40m diameter in the beautiful Schwedler cupola design. Around 1,800 freight trains would go through the Güterbahnhof Pankow each day back when it was thriving.\n\nNext to the freight depot was also a passenger railway station and in 1924 the electric rail service was introduced. The Berlin Pankow stations were connected to the Berlin S-Bahn, which brought about the first problems for the Rundlokschuppen. The round house engine shed from its very construction could not be expanded to fit the larger trains. Enter the Ringlokschuppen, a semi-circle shaped engine shed capable of housing larger trains and the turntable situated out front. However, this solution only kept the freight depot ticking over for so long before more challenges occurred. The turntable being exposed to the brutal Berlin elements led to its inevitable demise.\n\nThe Güterbahnhof Pankow was one of a kind in Germany and was eventually abandoned in 1997. Since then, there has only been disputes over the site and for years opposing parties have been at collision point. In 2007 department store mogul Kurt Krieger who owns several massive chain stores like Sconto and Möbel Höffner, bought the property and all sorts of ideas for the location were initially proposed. There were talks of the Rundlokschuppen being saved and transformed into a cafeteria for a school, with the rest of the historic landmark being flattened to transform the area into apartments and shops. Then in 2011 there were talks of the “Pankower Tor” project with Krieger wanting to invest 5 million Euros to make way for shops, apartments and two furniture stores, one of the stores possibly being specialized in vintage furniture and using the locomotive hall as a showroom as well as creative space. Some rumours have it that Krieger wants to demolish it all.\n\nDenkmalschutz aka listed building status has prevented this from happening thus far and (luckily for those interested in historic preservation), none of the above has yet materialized. The Pankow District put a right old spanner in the works by trying to protect the last historic construction of its kind and put in an appeal to force Krieger to preserve the buildings, especially the Rundlokschuppen since it is only one of two left in Germany, possibly even Europe. There was an initial success for interim legal protection, but the appeal was then rejected by the Higher Administrative Court (OVG) a few years ago.\n\nHowever, further admin stopped any projects from happening. The district received a 400,000 Euro grant to help maintain the slowly disappearing buildings, but it will take more than that to make a real difference at this point. If the district cannot find a suitable and economic use for the buildings, this would allow Krieger to apply for the demolition of the site with a very high chance to having the project accepted."
