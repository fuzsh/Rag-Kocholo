(C) t' APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 With the conclusion in late 1972 of the General Relations Treaty between the two German states, the Federal Republic of Germany gave its blessing to hav- ing its friends and allies proceed at their own pace to establish relations with the German Democratic Republic. The dam burst, and a literal wave of new diplomatic relationships engulfed the East Germans. This, coupled with its simultaneous entry into the world of international organizations, has brought the CDR the acceptance which it vainly sought since its founding. (U /OU) The demise of Nazi Germany left the Third Reich dismembered. Some of its eastern area was transferred to Polish or Soviet rule. The old capital city of Berlin was separated into Sectors under Four -Power ad- ministration. The remaining German territory was divided into zones of occupation �later merged, in the West, to create the Federal Republic of Germany. The 4` Soviets countered by declaring East Germany a separate state. To Bonn and its allies the move was a hypocritical attempt to provide a facade for continued manipulation of East Germany by Moscow. (U /OU) At that time, in the wake of World War II, East Ger- man assertions of separate statehood and sovereign status clearly lacked credibility. The Germany of re- cent memory had been a large, independent. prosperous, and powerful nation. The new East Ger- many, by contrast, was a mere fragment of that territory, economically deprived and dependent on Moscow's mailed fist for its political muscle. After more than two decades, the expenditure of mountainous ef- fort, and continued Soviet backing, East Germany still stands �and now stands much stronger. (U /OU) The international acceptance East Germany has gained has not come easily. For 20 years West Ger- many, with the aid of the Western Allies and by weight of its own political dynamics and surging economic strength, kept its eastern neighbor isolated r� from the non Communist world. East Germany tried with dogged determination to win favors where it could �by exchanging trade missions with emerging African states, for example �but its successes were few. Finally, in April 1969, East Berlin's persistence and For years the Leipzig Industrial Fair has symbolized East Germany's striving for international stature. some fumbling by Bonn in the Middle East broke the ice. Iraq established formal ties with East Germany, and then a number of other Afro -Asian states followed suit.

The authorities need- ed only to exploit this endowment. (C) t' APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 P The regime has also attempted to create its own tradition. The new rulers first argued their claim to govern on the basis of historical determinism. Accord- ing to Marxist Leninist doctrine, a socialist worker's state was destined to replace the capitalist system on German soil. It was asserted that this progression had already been sanctified by Soviet success, which Walter Ulbricht, a one time \"associate\" of Lenin, was best able to interpret. (U /OU) While this may have satisfied true believers in the Communist faith, it failed to generate mass loyalty. Therefore a more pragmatic line was introduced and emphasized: the contention that the East German system works, purportedly in ways even superior to those of rival West Germany. (U /OU) The government in East Berlin boasts in particular of high standards in such fields as education, welfare, health care, and in the dramatic arts. It impresses on the young that East Germany is a \"land of oppor- tunity\" where aptitude and drive �not to mention political conformity �are likely to bring rapid ad- vancement. It asks the general public to take pride in an \"economic miracle\" that has made East Germany the ninth ranked world industrial power and provided it with the highest standard of living in the Soviet camp. It sports the trappings of a full fledged nation, including an army to patrol its borders and a civil air- line and merchant fleet to show its flag abroad. The regime also has working in its favor, of course, the fact that it has endured �far longer, in fact, than did either the Weimar Republic or the Third Reich. (U /OU) The overall extent to which the rulers of the new \"worker- peasant state\" have won popular support is difficult to estimate. The regime has its warm adherents (doubtless a minority) and its outright op- ponents (probably an even smaller minority). There remains the bulk of the citizenry, among whom an un- emotional conformity seems to be the rule. Life evidently goes forward in a familiar pattern for most East Germans, who are concerned with things other than politics. Privately they may find the regime doc- trinaire, niggling, and clumsy; publicly they may drop a critical remark. Yet, resistance appears futile. The regime's capacity for coercion and willingness to use it, the Soviets' determination to maintain a firm grip on Eastern Europe (as exemplified in East Germany itself in 1953, Hungary in 1956, and Czechoslovakia in 1968), and the West's caution about intervening directly in the East are factors that would stifle the hopes of any would -be resistance leader. (C) i 1 Linking the Old with the New (c) On the whole, the history of East Germany has been short and inglorious. Deriving from that sector of Ger- many assigned Soviet occupation forces by World War II agreements, East Germany grew up in the Russian image as a well regimented state in which human beings conformed to the wishes of the Communist par- ty. Incorporated formally in 1949 as the German Democratic Republic, East Germany under the much -hated Walter Ulbricht remained an inter- national pariah for much of the cold war era. Unilateral grants of sovereignty by Moscow were effec- tively countered by Bonn's efforts to isolate the regime. Internally, there was a short -lived popular uprising in 1953, and in succeeding years many East Germans \"voted with their feet �as President John F. Kennedy put it �until the construction of the Berlin wall in August 1961 closed the last escape route. In the decade following the erection of the infamous wall, East Germany inched forward in economic and political stature, winning a grudging respect from the populace and a modicum of international acceptance. In May 1971, Ulbricht �who had come to place his wisdom above that of the Soviet masters retired\" as party leader and long -time party stalwart Erich Honecker was installed in his stead. During the early months of Honecker's efficient but colorless rule, he endorsed the Four -Power negotiations then in progress on the status of Berlin, thus paving the way for the in- ter- German General Relations Treaty establishing the GDR as a member of the international community. Despite humble beginnings and a deprived up- i,ringing, East Germany had reached maturity. East Germany's rulers, as if fearful that their hold is more tenuous than it appears to be, have been expert at invoking past spirits and building new illusions in their own behalf. A regime specialty is to push the East i APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 r Berlin's ancient Maiden's Bridge; SED Central Committee offices are at left and apartments on the right, with the State Council and Foreign Ministry buildings in the rear.

In tangible ways East Germany also links itself with History is reinterpreted; in East German texts the older times. It uses the black, red, and gold flag of \"class struggle\" is rampant, and \"heroes of the Weimar, but with the hammer and compass state sym- people\" are many. Ultimately the \"triumph of the bol affixerl. Its rail system is still called the Deutsche proletariat\" is assured, and thus the legitimacy of the Reichsbahn. Statues of the Prussian generals 3 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 f Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Bluecher, and Yorck are again in place on broad, tree -lined Unter den Linden, the Fifth Avenue of prewar Berlin. Goethe, despite his aristocratic tendencies, is made to seem a democratic progressive and thus a progenitor of the East German ethos. The greatest prize of all is Berlin, long promoted as \"the capital of the German Democratic Republic. For years, East German autborities intimated that it was only a matter of time before they took over the en- tire city, but with the General Relations Treaty they finally admitted the right of West Germany to repre- sent West Berlin. Nevertheless, they seek whatever ad- vantage they can derive from the fact that their capita! is the city �part of it, at least �that throughout Ger- many's history as a nation -state was its political and cultural heart and soul. Germany, centrally located as it is, has served as the crossroads of Europe. Historically it has been a battleground and an arena of conflicting cultures. Primarily Western- oriented, it also has displayed a fascination with the East. It has preyed upon its neighbors and in turn has been a prey. That Germany should now exist in two parts is not extraordinary. More often than not it has existed in a state of dis- unity. The territory which became East Germany is situated principally on the central North European Plain and is dominated by Berlin, a focus of land and inland waterway transportation routes. Generally scenic though not spectacularly so, the country ranges in nortb -south perspective from flat to gently rolling terrain. Only in the south and southwest is there high S ground with elevations up to 3,300 feet. A rail i network, so extensive as to be likened to a national trolley, constitutes the backbone of the transportation system. Good highways, lengthy canals, and midern oil and gas pipelines help speed traffic. The two great navigable rivers, the Elbe and the Oder, lead respec- tively to the ports of Hamburg, West Germany and Szczecin, Poland. Cool to cold winters, mild summers, prevalent cloudiness, and frequent precipitation con- stitute the weather pattern. Generally variable within i fairly narrow limits, the weather at times turns suf- ficiently capricious to disrupt crop growing, an endeavor k.lready beset by soils low in fertility. The subsurface endowment primarily brown coal, potash, sulfur, fluorspar, natural gas, and uranium �is insufficient to maintain an advanced industrial socie- ty, and East Germany must look largely to Soviet suppliers to meet its energy and raw material re- quirements. Looking outward, East Germany finds its setting to be equally bleak. To the west stands a powerful Ger- man rival. To the south lies a potentially unstable Czechoslovakia, and to the east a proud, nationalistic Poland comes between East Germany and its patron, the U.S.S.R. As the westernmost of the European Communist states, East Germany has developed a \"front line\" mentality. Party functionaries have visualized themselves as members of an outpost holding back the tide of \"Western imperialism.\" On a broader front, regime leaders have at times displayed suspicions of all their neighbors and performed as if East Germany were virtually beleaguered. In a sense it is. East Germany is smaller in area than any adjoining state and surpasses only Czechoslovakia in population. In these circumstances it is perhaps not surprising that East German authorities suffer some sense of inse- curity. Within a compact area of almost 42,000 square miles there exists a population of slightly over 17 million, a figure that has remained virtually static since the building of the Berlin wall. The people are a Nordic- Slavic blend, and thus exhibit the tall, blond, blue -eyed and short, brunet, brown -eyed characteristics of both groups. East German society is homogeneous, however, being sc 99% Germanic in makeup and outlook. Only a tiny Slavic minority, the Sorbs, form an exception. Even they are highly in- tegrated into the Germanic lifestyle, despite the government's attempts to portray them as a treasured minority. The regime has largely destratified the old Germanic society, eliminating the former ruling class and bring- ing the middle class under control by economic stric- tures. The working class in theory dominates the system, but in practice Communist authorities somewhat distrustful of worker loyalties �speak for it. Thus, a party managerial elite constitutes the true dominant class. The old Teutonic family portrait of the iron willed father, domestic servant mother, and submissive children has also been drastically altered. Women have been granted equal rights with men, and are no longer kitchen bound. Nurseries, schools, and youth groups are heavily responsible for child- rearing by \"approved methods.\" Originally unpopular, such policies have been increasingly accepted by a populace which with the passage of years has perceived that it had little choice but to come to terms with the regime. 6 -X. t APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 8?. The regime, during its two -plus decades of existence, has busied itself domestically with reshaping old Ger- man institutions into a new socialist establishment. It has been fortunate in that some of its reforms have proven popular and thereby established a rapport between ruler and ruled. It has also dispensed medicine bitter enough to antagonize its citizenry. a r. k Throughout, the guiding principle has continued to be R Institution of t h e Ne d Soci the exaltation of the interest of the state. The populace has had to adjust accordingly. The determination of the government to have its way was most strikingly demonstrated in the spring of 1960 when it unleased a massive campaign to com- y y 5 F APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 plete the collectivization of agriculture, Many farmers resisted as best they could, only to be overwhelmed in a matter of weeks by party organizers fanatically devoted to the dictates of political doctrine and socialist agricultural science. Defeat bred apathy among the peasantry, which in turn contributed to a downturn in agricultural production. Typically, the regime persevered and through the application of threats and incentives inspired East German farmers to outproduce their counterparts in neighboring East European countries. In human terms, the happy, smil- ing peasantry portrayed by the regime is doubtless a great distortion, but still the original bitterness seems to have dissipated and the collectivized farmer ap- parently finds life tolerable. By contrast with the equivocal result in the agricultural sector, educational reform has definitely bolstered the regime. By and large, the changes under- taken have proven acceptable, and the credit goes to the government. The old European class system, which permits the advancement of only a small elite, has largely been scrapped, and a mass schooling system has been substituted. The formerly submerged levels of society may now achieve according to their ability, and their political reliability. Principal emphasis is placed on vocational training and on socialist indoc- trination, which is pervasive. Practical work programs in the factory or on the farm are emphasized as an educational adjunct even for those hoping to enter the professions. This factor of socialist learning is equaled in unpopularity by one other: as in other areas, also in education and science there persists the strong odor of Soviet dominance and exploitation. Russian is given first prior;ty in the study of foreign languages. Research projects are frequently oriented toward Soviet needs. Soviet dogma, as it extends into the physical and natural sciences, is stressed. In the classroom, life in the West is presented in an extremely restricted and highly colored format, thus reinforcing the mental isolation of the student. He may opt not to believe what the teacher imparts, but still he will be able to acquire precious little ground on which to build a counterbelief. In the instance of at least one institution, the military, the regime has sought popular acceptance by retaining rather than abandoning \"the best of the old tradition.\" The Volksarmee presents with its goose- stepping troopers, neat formations, rumbling tanks, and heavy Germanic marches a remarkable resemblance to the forces of former times. Aspects of 6 socialist modernity also creep in, however, including: the shaping of an officer corps representative of the party and the proletariat, the lowering of caste barriers between officers and men, and the reordering of Ger- man military history to highlight \"revolutionary episodes.\" East Germany nurtures its army as a prominent sym- bol of the integrity of the state. Totaling almost 120,- 000 men, the East German armed force exceeds in numbers only those of Hungary and Albania in Eastern Europe. However, relative to population it has almost as many men in uniform as West Germany. The army is clearly subordinate to the civilian officials c.f the state and is virtually incapable of exercising political influence. In. addition, there is doubt about its combat reliability. Ultimately the question that has hung over the Volksarmee is the same as that which has haunted its West German counterpart: \"Would German fight German The proposition may seem highly theoretical, but still it exists. And, in the East German case, any answer other than a strong af- firmative bespeaks doubt about the endurance of the state. Alert to this frailty, the regime continually seeks �with some success �to bolster the morale of the army. Plaudits are showered on it by the government, and extensive favorable coverage is g in the media. Military parades are held with considerable frequency in East Berlin even though they violate tl: a terms of Four -Power Agreements on the status of the city. In addition the armed forces increasingly have been per- mitted to play a more prominent role in Warsaw Pact exercises, though hardly one that challenges the reality of Soviet dominance in Pact affairs. The Volksarmee itself is molded along the lines of the Soviet forces, is supplied chiefly with Soviet equipment, and, quite naturally, is subject to considerable Soviet influence in its day -to -day operations. The approximately 333,000 -man Soviet component euphemistically known as \"the friends maintains a low public profile in East Germany, but by its presence helps in- sure the life of the regime. From 1945 onward, the Protestant Evangelical Church has represented the longest lived holdout against the dominance of the state. The church initial- ly sought to operate on the basis of one Germany, in principle a denial of East Germany's right to exist. The church was also identified with the old society, whereas to many pastors the new secular authorities were the representatives of \"godless Marxism.\" In A APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 i:. 1} i t r r f F i 10 1 I 0 former times the church had had a say in the running of the state. Now the state encroached on the church. In the name of \"socialist morality\" (i.e., whatever fosters socialism is moral), Walter Ulbricht proclaimed the \"Ten Commandments of Socialism.\" The state pressed its own forms for baptism, confirmation, and marriage, and discouraged religious education. Recalcitrant clergymen were browbeaten, or even jailed. Presently, after years of feuding, church and state have learned to coexist, although not always comfort- ably. The regime continues to grant small subsidies as in pre -1945 days, tolerates religious training, and per- mits pastors to speak out against state sponsored atheism but not against the socialist state itself. For its part, the church has forsworn open political opposition and, under extreme pressure, broken ties with the church in West Germany. Viewing these developments, some observers have seen the regime trying for a genuine modus vivendi, but the situation appears to be more a case of the state, by cat -and- mouse tactics, turning the church into a cooperative subject. Overall, the regime has been more watchful of its in- tellectuals than its churchmen. Religious expression inay be dismissed as anachronistic and irrelevant; cultural expression is officially regarded as a modern day tool for upholding and exemplifying the state. From time to time, as in the early Honecker days, the regime deems it wise to relax its hold, but normally in- tellectual dissent is rooted out far more quickly in in- secure East Germany than in other, better established East European states. The regime has failed rather woefully in enlisting the full cooperation of its most innovative people. It has permitted them to travel abroad, provided them with social clubs, showered them with honors, and made them financially secure. Yet, it has not seen fit to supply the degree of freedom that even avowed Marx- ists demand. Some of the most able of German Marx- ists� Bertolt Brecht and Arnold Zweig, for ex- ample �chose to reside in East Germany following World War II, and by their presence lent prestige to the regime. The situation soured, however, as many of the great talents rebelled or dried up, and few replacements were found in the younger generation. To some extent the collective excellence of orchestral and theatrical ensembles has filled the void, but in- dividual genius remains a dear commodity in a land of group conformity. Lifestyle: Political and Economic (c) As a political entity, East Germany is the product of interlocking wills: that of German Communists to fulfill their destiny as set down by the patron saints Marx and Engels and that of the Soviet Union to build for itself the broadest possible buffer zone in central Europe. The event that historically was supposed to bring forth a German Communist state �a violent class revolution �never materialized. This omission constitutes a serious departure from orthodoxy for a highly doctrinaire regime. A successful revolution, however, was never an immediate prospect for strug- gling members of the radical left, who ultimately found in Russian expansionisia their instrument for victory. The Communist Party of Germany (KPD), the direct antecedent of the East German ruling party, was founded at the end of World War I following a split of the Socialist Party. True to Lenin's vision, it sought by all available means to promote an upheaval on Ger- man soil as the precondition for revolution everywhere. At the time of Hitler's accession to power in 1933, the KPD had 300,000 members, a total second only to the Soviet party in the Comintern. Over the next 12 years Nazi persecution and party factional strife thinned the ranks and hardened the survivors in their determina- tion to build a new German state following World War II. Communist rule in the Soviet Zone of Germanv commenced on 30 April 1945 when the \"Ulbricht group\" arrived from Moscow. Operating under Soviet aegis, it offered the semblance of a democratic system. As the cold war came on and the time for mollifying the Wcst passed, a new reality appeared: an authoritarian state patterned on the Soviet model and subservient to it. All power was lodged in the Socialist Unity Party (SED), the party formed by the forced merger in April 1946 of the Social Democratic Party 7 Yfwit'e\",3v,ie ,v -a�c.. ...e_..?t;. ,.L,t ...L vA,, APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 i x t into the KPI). From the beginning, the SED was largely the tool of Waiter Ulbricht, and he endowed the party with his principies: rigid organization, strict discipline, doc- trinal orthodoxy, and loyuity to Moscow. Any devia- tion from these norms was a privilege reserved for Ulbricht himself. Having faced many perils since his youthful days as a KPD functionary� including the menace of Stalin's displeasure during his Moscow years (193 845)--he had become practiced at political survival. He set Lle public example as the well in. funned, painstaking, and puritanical leader who work- ed almost ceaselessly for the new state. In private- he manipulated the party machinery ruthlessly to his own advantage. Overall, he lilted to be considered the father of his country, but his inability to rise above the image of a petty tyrant more often made him an object of ridicule. Under Ulbricht, the party, by its own accounts, guided the state from one triumph to another in a quest fur excellence. At its founding in 1949 the self styled German Democratic Republic was declared to be a peoples denrocmcy at an intermediate stage, aim- ing to become a genuine socialist state. By 1952 the groundwork was being laid for a socialist order, and as of 1958 the groundwork had been completed. In 1968 a new constitution hailed the achievement of the socialist state and assumed its continuing perfectiun. Thoughout, important anniversaries were --as they continue to be� celebrated by the party with overflowing self praise for its achievements in building \"the first German peace state.\" Su outpourings over the years doubtless have con stitutiJ an attempt on the part of regime leaders to in- spire confidence in the durability of the party and the system that it has wrought. The doctrinaire dullness of the exaggerated claims and constant sloganeering, however, has served more as a reminder of the nature of the leadership itself. it fia:< been the burden of the party to have produced few tan men of the type who inspire popular trust. What has been produced has been a coterie of grey -faced bureaucrats, solemn of mien, and joyless of mood, who operate in the old :;er- man paternalistic tradition of \"papa knows best.\" As the chosen keepers and interpreters of Marxist truth, they exhibit an elitist mentality and a consegttent dis trust for popular feeling. On occasion they pose as true democrats and friend: 4 the people, but conformity is what they demand and expect to receive from those below. The success of political regimentation as practiced by tier SED has rested to a considerable .1egree on a commonalty of view and a uniformity of purpose among the top members of the party. Ulbricht was for years the personification of the unity of the Socialist Unity Pary. Fealty to the mast( was the price of political success. There were thuse who plotted his demise as party leader, but so firm was his grip and so favorable the fates that even the workers' uprising of 17 June 1933 failed to dislodge him. Eventually he was eased out, but even then the changeover to Erich Honecker in 1971 .vas carried through smoothly. Like Ulbricht, Honecker is experienced and artful, the sort of man not likely to be taken by suprise by his foes. As is usually the ease with Communist governments, the East German regime has outfitted itself with Western -style democratic finery. One of its showier items is a multiparty system which allows four ad- ditional parties representing Christian, Liberal, agrarian, and reformed Nazi elements membership in parliament. These parties ptirport to be counterparts of similar groups in West Germany, but in reality they are largely paper organizations. Each, of course, is regime controlled and lacks any stature of its own. In similar fashion, so- called mass organizations such as the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB) and the Free German Youth (.I:DJ) operate under direct SED guidance and serve both as listening posts for popular opin and as conduits for regime edicts. Finally, the regime groups together the political parties and the more important mass organizations into a semisaered body known as the National Front, which claims to represent the views of the populatic.. as a whole. In East Cennany the indbipensable political element is solidarity. An election iq a referendum for or against the system. Candidates are hand chosen, and their speeches are carefully tailored. Subsequent discussion is so arranged as virt.tally to be scripted. The campaign audience is well aware that only its approval is desired. Social and psychological pressure is applied to guarantee a massive turnout since a nonvoter is con- sidered a dissenter. Regularly, 98% to 99% of titre elec- torate do their duty and overwhelmingly \"confirm\" the regime. The shorn forms of democratic practice in East Ger- many are complemented by err,; ty vessels of parliamentarism.

Heavy reparations, including the dismantling and shipping of entire industrial enterprises to the U.S.S.R., completed the gloomy picture. While the West German economy, given the impetus of the Marshall Plan, took off and soared, the East German economy for years remained grounded. The factors were many, and certainly not the least of them was the dire labor shortage caused by the flight of 2.3 million persons prior to the building of the Berlin wall. Whereas in the West the wall signified the division of Germany, for the GDR it meant the start of a new economic life. With escape no longer a possibility, the people had no choice but to serve East Germany. The result was what the East Germans choose to call their very own Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle). It clearly is a source of pride, even to those East Germans unsympathetic to the regime. The manner in which the regime directed the 10 buildup of the economy was indicative or its ambition to give East Cermany a claim to a sovereign existence. Prior to 1945 this sector of Germany had been somewhat sparsely industrialized �its chief production being in light industry: chemicals, optics, and preci- sion instruments. The regime proceeded with a vengeance to build a broad industrial base in the in- terest of virtual self sufficiency. Unfortunately for the East Germans, their economic aspirations frequently remained just that, as Soviet needs took priority over their own. By Moscow's lights, East Germany's role was to be that of a servant of the Soviet economy. It would be a machineshop turning out high quality products for the U.S.S.R. and would provide a ready market, at inflated prices, for Soviet raw materials. The East Germans over the years have swallowed hard and accepted Soviet demands, but not without acts of protest, the most sDectacular of which was the suicide in December 1965 of Erich Apel, head 0 t i 5 a i y e i 0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 of the State Planning Commission. Apel's death illustrated a basic fact of East German life, i.e., that politics dominates economics and that party chiefs are ascendant over technocrats. Those who would push the economy ahead in a rational fashion, even resorting to capitalistic devices, have won a modicum of freedom, particularly under Honecker, but the dead hand of party doctrine still lies heavily on their plans. It is as if the authorities would rather per- mit economic lag than commit political heresy. Thus East Germany, advanced though it is by East Euro- pean standards, has proceeded under severe hand- icaps. Its industry for years was cut off from impor- tant scientific and technological advances, and its markets were restricted by reason of its isolation from the West. It continues to exist in the straitjacket of a centralized command economy. Finally, it seems fre- quently to be stretched to the limit of its resources and thus susceptible to grievous damage from the errors of man or the wHms of nature. Acts of God are imper- missible in socialist planning, but nonetheless wet summers have ruined crop harvests, and harsh winters have produced power shortages dire eneugh to disrupt industry and douse city lights. Breakdowns are embarrassing, especially in that they serve as a reminder of grimmer days for the average man. The late 1940's and much of the 19M's were times of deprivation. In the 1960's the populace experienced a steadily increasing standard of liv- ing, and now, by Communist criteria, a consumer- oriented society has arrived. Television sets and to a lesser degree refrigerators and washers are generally available, though frequently not at a price the average family can easily afford. Private cars are still luxury, and housing remains in meager supply despite the best efforts of the regime. Food shortages are largely a thing of the past, with the quality and variety of the offerings both unproved. Some advances also have been made in supplying high quality clothing, shoes. and furniture. As consumers, the Fast Germans are _.ot unlike their cousins in the West. They yearn increasingly for luxury items� exotic food, stylish apparel, or even a car, and work long hours and stint themselves in various ways to gain their goals. They inwardly rage at authority if the pmdiict is not available, or, if obtained, it proves unsatisfactory. The regime is well aware that its reputation is on the line in the nationalized market place, and under Honecker in particular it hai made adjustments to fill the wants of the people. The Regime and the People (c) In an era of increasing detente, the regime continues to prefer that its people live in semi isolation behind heavily barricaded borders. With few exceptions, only those certified as politically reliable or economically expendable are allowed to travel to the West. Those rash enough to attempt flight across a boundary or over the Berlin wall are still deemed guilty of a crime against the state and may be shot by border guards. Within its political compound, the state constantly ex- tracts pledges of loyalty from the populace and dis- penses a rigorous brand of justice. To a large extent, Western influences are still shut out. Intellectuals are exhorted to be good servants of the state, mirroring East German society in their works and combating ,lien ideologies. The People's Army, the state security forces, and the considerable encampment of Soviet troops are frequently lauded a a bulwark against the enemy to the west. Trends towards liberalization elsewhere in Eastern Europe frequently have elicited public condemnation from a regime intent on warding off any infection iii its body politic. Even the Soviet Union has been open to criticism, at least during the !alter years of Ulbricht, though seldom under the g enerall loyal Honecker, who has also seen fit to relax domestic strictures ever so %lightly. As compared with earlier yeah, Fast German society in the 1970's is caught in some -thing less than an iron vise. On ncrasion. the authorities even relent suf- ficiently to allow a modicum of free expression. Such leniency selves to alleviate a buildup of tension.. However, the %ituation is rarely permitted to get out of hand, and, if signs of di%%Pnt appear, the clamp-t are likely to be reapplied. Since most potential tmublemaken apparently either have had their spirits crushed or have long since fled the country, public of- ficiate� encouraged by the lead of Honecker �have APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 assumed more of an air of trust of the populace. Most inhabitants of East' Germany on a day -to -day basis have faced the reality of their existence and have learned to give the cooperation required of them. ,Many slip into rationalizations to the'effect that life in East Germany is mare secure, less hectic, and therefore \"nicei than in West Germany. Those who are a part of the regime or who owe their success to it doubtless constitute a growing band of state loyalists. 12 There remains, however, an air of negativism among East Germans, which frequently is more pronounced than that found elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Fven allowing for the traditional German tendency to face life grimly, many observers have commented on the absence of enthusiasm and spontaneity. There appears to be a \"we versus them' mental set among the pop- ulace vis -a -vis the authorities. At times individuals are surprisingly outspoken on such matters as the inability APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R00 0200110020 -1 to visit West Germany or the unavailability of certain items at the neighborhood store. Sallies against \"the system\" at this level are genera!!, tolerated, but out- right attacks on the political leadership are taboo and invite stern retribution. Other evidences that \"a correct socialist attitude\" has not been fully implanted are readily available. Rock music and long hair, for example, frequently have been portrayed as tools of capitalistic subversion, although as of 1973 these \"youthful aberrations\" were tolerated. High party officials continue to inveigh against juvenile delinquency, or \"hooliganism\" as they call it. in addition, the regime has acknowledged alcoholism as a considerable problem. The high in- cidence of divorce and eRtramarital relations also suggests that a systematized existence does not necessarily bring the high standards of morality preached by the regime. By and large, however, antiregime and antisocial behavior is a relatively minor concern in a state in which regimentation bas become a way of life. Per- sonal documentation is constantly required, and police checks are common. Job mobility is severely restricted, and variant behavior is viewed with suspicion. What regular authorities fail to detect, police informers may ferret out. Political offenses, though considerably less frequent than in earl 't er days, usually result in harsher punishment than standard crimes, and, one accused, the individual's chances for acquittal are slim. Then too, a personal existenee.as such is sharply dimini_shvA by reason of the fact that an individual is merged into a series of collectives --for work, play, and political and s(: ial activity. Within that context, he is expected to conform in realization of the socialist dictum that cooperation with one's \"comrades\" and obedience to the rules of the team are the highest goals. Centralized direction by the regime of the nation's intellectual and cultural life provides another means for the perpetuation of mass subservience to the state. Radio, television, and the press bear witness to the gre�tness of the nation -and the wisdom of the party with a constancy, volume, and uniformity seemingly guaranteed to promote boredom. Motion pictures and theatrical productions frequently supply only a slightly less rigorous political indoctrination. Unhappily for the regime, Western influences such as radio and TV brondeasts are available in sufficient quantity to provide a standard of comparison for those Fast Ger- mans who care to take advantage of them, On balance, however, the regime's domestic propaganda is the major factor. Pervasive and thus largely un- avoidable, it must eventually seep into the individual's being. Doubtless the most powerful instrument of control is the ruling Socialist Unity Party itself. About 1.9 million East Germans are Communist party members, but some only nominally so. In addition, the party directs a 35.000 -man Workers Militia, a paramilitary force, adw ittedly of unknown effectiveness, charged with putting down civil unrest. Basic party organizations are established in factories, collective farms, production cooperatives, police units, state and economi_- administrations, scientific and educational institutions, residential areas, and any other place a small group may congregate. At this level, trained functionaries propagate the regime's message to the ex- tent that their sometimes limited skill and their auditors' frequently limited Interest allow. When propaganda and political agitation fail, the government may still enforce its will on the populace by resort to the police, the courts, and the prisons. De- Stalinization and liberalization as practiced elsewhere in Eastern Europe, however, have also taken root in East Germany, albeit somewhat tentatively, and in the process the government's use of terror tHdics has abated. Memories of state oppsessioa persist, however, and they serve to discourage overt dissidence. Even then it is important to note that bloodlust was more a Soviet than an -East German aberration and that Ulbricht disposed of opponents in less brutal fashion than Stalin. Generaily, the regime in recent years has preferred to cow rather than crush its op- ponents. A domesticated critic is living proof of the regime's ability to triumph. Purges would only invite comparisons to events of the Hitler era. The maintenance of public order an a day to-day basis falls.to.ttie Peoples Police and the.State Service (SSD), both responsible 'to national and not local authority. The SSD, operating .covertly, has been the feared instrument of political control, although to- day to a considerably lmwr extent than formerly. Sum- mary punishment is n-a longer a feature of the East German system. Arrests, indictments, and trials are conducted according to established procedures. Ac- quittals; reversals of sentences, and pardons are now conceivable. By constitutional writ the Fast GermamIs entitled to many of the same rights and privileges as the citizen of a Western democracy. In practice the in- dividual is, Judged according to the degm.- that his behavior detracts, from the well -being of the state. 13 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA -RDP01 -00707 R000200110020 -1 Big Brother and Others (c) in the successful quest foe status, East Germany has had the decisive backing of the Soviet Union. For Moscow, East Germany represents the Soviets forward most military political position in Europe. It is an im- portant industrial partner, and above all else its con- tinued existence obviates \"the German threat.\" Soviet troops stationed in East Germany provide a guarantee of the endurance of the regime. The U.S.S.R. takes about 40% of East German exports and is the chief supplier of essential raw materials. Ry its ac- complishments, e.g., space flights, it radiates an aura of socialist success in which East Germany may bask. For its part, East Germany has a record of compliance that compares favorably with that of any other East European state. The evident harmony of the Moscow -East Berlin relationship has been punctuated by some discordant notes over the years. In the postwar era, the Soviets plundered their sector of Germany, hesitated before approving the creation of the GDR, domineered over it for years. failed to deliver Berlin to it or to sign a separate peace treaty with it despite frequent promises. In the early days, the proud Nordics had little choice but to accept humiliation by their Slavic mentors. As East Germany became stronger and hence less dependent, the leadership undertook a new course. It frntueptly finessed Moscow's demands, openly pledg- ing loyalty to the Soviets and then quietly proceeding the German way. In the post- Khnuhchev era. the Ulbricht regime, perhaps exaggerating its importance to th- bloc. went a step further. It ceased giving the Sovi4 full credit for all socialist advances and with evident delight pronounced some of its own accom- plishments superior. As the elder statesman of blom leaden. Ulbricht increasingly advised Moscow on proper courses of action, particularly on Berlin where 14 East German interests were involved. Finally a more pliable leader was found in the person of Erich Honecker. From this episode it became clear that on crucial issues Moscow's desires still prevailed over Pankow's, to the detriment of the image of full East German sovereignty. In domestic affairs the regime clearly enjoys the dominant role, but overall it remains only a junior partner in Soviet sponsored ventures. Friendship among peoples\" is one of East Ger- many's most heavily stressed precepts. Yet even in Eastern Europe East Germans often are resented, since they are viewed more as Germans than as socialist brethren. Alluding to past Teutonic depredations, many East Europeans are inclined to believe that Ger- mans, East or West, simply \"cannot overcome their national character.\" As inheritors of a Western cast of mind and a Protestant morality, East Germans are also considered to be \"different.\" For their part, many in East Germany would agree that they themselves are \"different,\" and also \"better.\" The regime has lived in mortal fear that incipient liberalism in the established East European nations may spread into East Germany and pro.iuce infec- tions, perhaps even convulsions among the populace. Broadly, it was for this reason that East Germany was a prime mover in the bloc's invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. Once again the world was treated to the spectacle of Germans marching into Czechoslovakia. Despite underlying tensions and occasional flash- points, the Fast Germans remain generally cc} operative allies in the Warsaw Pact and CEMA. Within this context, Pankow looked to the other allied capitals to back its claims to sovereignty and boost its campaign for recognition. Their frequent failure to do so vigorously increased the regime's sense of insecurity, and at times induced among East German leaders con- cern that their Eastern neighbors would succumb to the wiles of West Germany, strike a deal with Bonn. and thus leave Fast Germany in an isolated and weakrne d condition. A new confidence born of acceptance has partially displaced such oncerns. and has imbued the regime with a sense of belonging. Still, old fears die hard among the East German faithful, and they remain vigilant against any infidelity on the part of Fast Europeans. On the basis of experience, the Fast Germans have never been quite able to trust the Soviets.

(c) It has not been easy for East Germany to live next door tco the dramatic prosperity which burst forth in West Germany's capitalistic pluralistic society. Pankow on the one hand belittles Bonn's economic slsmess and on the other promises to outstrip it by way of Marxian socialism. Extending its effort to the break- ing point has brought some results, but has not dis- pelled the sense of frustration and inferior.ty of com- ing off second best in almost any observable com- parison with West Germany, which to 'iegin with has two and a half times the territory and nearly four times the population of East Germany. In marching to its own dremmet, the GDR has written off the idea of German reunification �a notion it had occasionally extolled for propaganda purposes and which is still held up in West Germany as an arti- cle of faith. In one of his more accurate descriptions of the German situation, Walter Ulbricht told his Com- munist Party Congress in April 1967: \"Two separate German states 1-ave been created, and they have pur- sued completely different paths of development. To unify them would be tantamount to combining fire and water. I: is unrealistic to talk about unification now.\" On balance, it appears that the former East German ruler c as a point. Time and circumstance have lossened tanohar and fraternal ties. Regionalism has taken hold, rind each state has been welded into military and economic pacts inimical one to the other. Each is prideful in its accomplishments and separate identity. Each sees itself as the true fatherland, reserv- ing for itself the best of the Germanic past, and places the onus of unrighteousness on the other. Neither appears disposed in the near future to modify its style sufficiently to accommodate the other. Present -day relations between the two Germanies are heavily influenced by a residue of distrust. For 16 years West Germany treated East Germany as a political and social outcast, an \"untouchable\" on the international scene. Bonn claimed the right to sole representation for Germany as a whole. Bonn spokesmen dismissed East Germany as \"the Soviet oc- cupied zone,\" \"Middle Germany,\" and \"the so- called German Democratic Republic.\" Only in the fall of 1969 did newly inaugurated Chancellor Brandt acknowledge the existence of \"two German states,\" albeit in \"one German nation �a formula unaccept- able to a Pankow regime intent on winning accept- ance of a sovereign East Germany. By contrast with Bonn's attitude of disdain, East German spokemen over the years verbally assaulted the Federal Republic with very special rage, some of it bordering on the obscene. More recently, the Brandt policy of recon- ciliation with the East has undercut Pankow's propaganda effort and the war of words abated in the early 197G's. A sign of the mood of insecurity that still grips East Germany is the uncertainty with which relations with West Germany are conducted. On the one hand, the GDR in recent years has pressed a policy of separateness (Abgrenzurig) in order to show in every small way the existence of two entirely different Ger- manies. It continues to regard West Germany as a menace to its existence, the governing SPD as a betrayer of socialism, and popular Chanceller Willy Brandt as a seducer of its people. On the other hand, East German leaders realize they must deal with West Germany in good faith, in order to solidify their political ga,..s and to open new avenues to Western markets and technology. Seeking a solution to its dilemma, the CDR has agreed, somewhat grudgingly and with specific limitations, to permit those East -West German personal contacts spelled out in the General Relations Treaty. Simultaneously, the GDR has continued to bargain toughly on the official level with Bonn in behalf of East German interests. In mall ways, such as the release of political prisoners, East Germany has made concessions to domestic and West German public opinion, bu c it remains doubtful that Pankow is ready to risk a full normalizaticip of relations with the powerful magnet that is West Germany. Looking ahead, observers of East Germany have mused for years as to what comes next. Many predicted that Ulbricht's passing from power would be a major turning point. As it turned out, observable changes have thus far been minimal. Erich Honecker has slightly relaxed domestic controls and allowed his r1 0 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 t r F 3x pi 4 s n ail people a slightly larger measure of \"the good lift,\" both in terms of consumer gomis and social welfare benefits. At the same time, lie has opted for a somem-hat greater degree of ceotralLmd control of the economy. In external affairs, lie differs again by degree: conforming more fully to Soviet wishes, acting friencifier ,oward other Warsaw fact states, and generally avoiding throwing his weight around in East European affairs. In party matters, he procceds cautiously, in the process slowly replacing incumbents with his own risen. As a lifelong bureaucrat and longtime heir apparent, he seems to Have learned his lessons well. Unlike Honecker and the bureaucrats now in office, there Is no certainty that the younger generation, which will inherit the system, will conform to es- tablished practice. Self- confident and pragmatic, the new risen seers willing to accept the concept of socialism nominally, but then operate according to the dictates of reason. An infusion of more youthful, less rigid personnel into positions of Iwwer conceivably could eventually tip the balance in favor of a society miff ieientiv h1wralized and an econoniv sufficientiv Westerniml to permit an accommodation with West Germany. Stic a result is hardiv foreordained. however. The firobability remains that the liberals of today will be the conservatives of tomorrow; and. by the time they assume power. they will be prepared to march in lock step along the Ulbricht- Honecker course. On balance, the bast German regime has reason to believe that developments in the ricar term may be favorable to its interests. In effect, it has built its own house. To u considerable degree, it has gained aecep- lance at home and ubroud. Overall, it feels t hat time is on its side, 1larticularly as expectations of a return to 17 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200110020 -1 d German national unitv diminish further among East and West Germans and separation becomes more a i reality. Nonetheless, East Germany still has problems. At home, the regime must deal with the spiral of rising ex- pectations, and it is problematical whether it can fulfill the demands of the populace both for a better life and increased contact with the outside world. I Abroad, East Germany must be careful in several respects �to maintain the proper attitude of loyalty to the Soviet Union; to avoid the weighty embrace of West Germany; to exploit Western economies without falling prey to their ideologies; to keep the friendship t of third world countries without paying an exorbitant price in terms of aid; and above all, to do these var'.ous things with slender diplomatic resources and little ac- crued experience in tb international arena. In the long run, Pankow also will not be able to rest worryfree. Hopes for reunification, as opposed o ex ,iectations, are unlikely to die out completely. Building on hope, Chancellor Brandt and his suc- cessors may be expected to pursue practical inter German ties as the br for some form of political union. In an era of detente, circumstances con- ceivably may arise which would break down the carefully erected barriers and make union the more possible. On c, larger scale, West and East Europe may over time interact in a movement toward one Europe in which logic decrees that there will be ono Getmany. Thus, there is no guarantee in per- petuity that there will he an East Germany. At present, Pankow can only insist that such must be the case. No matter what path the regime itself would take, it must in plotting its course accept two conditions as facts of life. The GDR will continue to be subordinate to the Soviet Union whose own national interests will define the broader aspects of Fast Germany's relationships abroad. Also, the West German Govern- ment has not abandoned the concept of reuni .cation. Rather, it has switched to playing a Fong -term game on this ;paramount issue. Bonn has challenged East Ger- many to a competitive coexistence in the confident belief ,'hat ultimately its Western lifestyle and the spirit of German nationhood will win out. At present, it has acceded to East Germany's international recogni- tion in an effort to lure the Communist regime into the arena. East Germany has accepted the challenge and novv is fated to emerge from isolation into a world of change, with con.setluenem as vet unknown.
