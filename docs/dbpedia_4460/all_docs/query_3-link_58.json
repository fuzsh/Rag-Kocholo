        "text": "Nothing could be dug up about this little abandoned railroad switch house. We stumbled across this lost place by chance looking for another abandoned structure a while back. While there might not be any information online, we can make a few assumptions based on its location and condition.\n\nWhat do we know about the abandoned Railroad Switch House?\n\nSeeing as this abandoned building is located right next to some train tracks and relatively close to a train station, this building was most likely a Railroad Switch House (in German: Rangierhaus) – a building used to monitor and switch train tracks (similar to the abandoned Bahnbetriebswerk Pankow Heinersdorf). It’s doubtful that the building dates back earlier than the 20th Century and it seems like it was give up sometime in the 1980s or early 90’s. The Switch House hasn’t faired well, as not only have the roof and the floors caved in, but it seems like the building has fallen victim to a land slide, covering each side of the building with earth."
