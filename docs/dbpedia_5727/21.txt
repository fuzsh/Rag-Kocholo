Summer of ‘42

It’s the summer of 1942: America is at war, men line up by the thousands to join the army, and on a tiny island off the coast of Maine, three fifteen-year-old boys begin a summer they will never forget. Hermie, Oscy, and Benjie are accustomed to spending the summer together, but somehow this year seems different and girls have replaced baseball and comic books. While their adolescent misadventures ensue, they learn about life, love, and the scope of human compassion.
