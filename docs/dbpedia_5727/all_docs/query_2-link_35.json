        "text": "Appropriately, the first film exhibited to a paying audience - it opened the Lumiere Brothers' programme in Paris in 1895 - was a 45-second shot of workers leaving the Lumiere factory in Lyon. Heading in pursuit of leisure at the end of a working day, they were representatives of the mass audience that would make the cinema one of the world's greatest industries. Here, before my choice, are five categories of vacation movies.\n\n1. The group trip that goes wrong in amusing ways but turns out well in the end.\n\n2. The holiday in which someone seeks and/or finds a life-changing experience.\n\n3. The shattered idyll - the wonderful vacation that leads to, or ends in, disaster.\n\n4. The sociological observation of people from different backgrounds and social strata as they go off on holiday in the same direction.\n\n5. The day-out flick, in which all human life is squeezed into 24 hours as three sailors go ashore in New York or a charabanc transports Indians to Blackpool.\n\nThe top ten\n\nPeople on Sunday\n\nRobert Siodmak, Edgar G Ulmer, 1930\n\nSubtitled 'A Film Without Actors', this milestone movie - the last German silent classic - centres on five attractive young Berliners. Three are women (a model, a shop assistant, a film extra), one of whom spends Sunday at home in bed, while the others go out into the country with a womanising wine salesman and a taxi driver. Part fiction, part documentary, it beautifully evokes an active city slowing down on a summer Sunday. The only experienced filmmaker involved was the great cinematographer Eugen Schufftan, and his images can take their place beside contemporary photographs by Kertesz, Sandor and Cartier-Bresson. Fred Zinnemann worked as camera assistant, Billy Wilder and Curt Siodmak wrote the script. It was immediately embraced by Jean Renoir and later by the Italian neo-realists, the British Free Cinema Movement and the French Nouvelle Vague.\n\nHindle Wakes\n\nMaurice Elvey, 1927\n\nOne of the best British silent movies, this is an adaptation of a famous play by Stanley Houghton (of the Manchester school) which had shocked audiences in 1912 with the story of a Lancashire mill girl who refuses to marry her boss's weak son after they have had seaside sex. Opening up the play, it skilfully evokes factory life and captures the glamour of 1920s Blackpool as experienced by factory workers during their Wakes Week holidays.\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much\n\nAlfred Hitchcock, 1934/1956\n\nHitchcock's future as 'the Master of Suspense' was established by his first version of this film, he was an acclaimed auteur when he remade it in Hollywood. In the original, a middle-class British couple (Leslie Banks, Edna Best) are holidaying in Switzerland when their daughter is kidnapped by terrorists. In the remake, a Midwestern doctor and his wife (James Stewart, Doris Day) are on vacation in Morocco when their son is abducted.\n\nHoliday Camp\n\nKen Annakin, 1947\n\nThis comedy-drama interweaves the experiences of a cross-section of British types at a Butlin's holiday camp. Robustly working-class left-wing playwright Ted Willis and gay right-wing columnist Godfrey Winn each had a hand in the script, and it's a cultural time capsule. Jack Warner and Kathleen Harrison launched their Huggett family here (a film and radio series followed) and Dennis Price appears as a fugitive serial killer.\n\nMonsieur Hulot's Holiday\n\nJacques Tati, 1953\n\nTati, the French heir to Chaplin and Keaton, moves insouciantly into an Atlantic seaside resort, spreading havoc everywhere, and playing an unforgettable tennis game (both breath- and point-taking). It's a kindly, personal, original work with odd onomatopoeic sounds instead of dialogue. Tati went on to make more elaborate comedies. This remains his popular, populist triumph.\n\nSummer Madness\n\nDavid Lean, 1955\n\nWith this international production Lean moved into the big time. His glossy tale of international manners stars Katharine Hepburn at her most vulnerable as a middle-aged spinster having a holiday affair with an Italian (Rossano 'Some Enchanting Evening' Brazzi) in Venice. Touristic stuff, movingly played by Hepburn (her eyes were permanently damaged by endless retakes of her falling into canals).\n\nPauline at the Beach\n\nEric Rohmer, 1983\n\nRohmer is the cinematic laureate of the relaxed/troubled holiday experience, whether staying in Paris when everyone else is away (Le Signe du Lion), on the Mediterranean (La Collectionneuse), beside Lake Annecy (Claire's Knee), or on France's Atlantic coast - A Summer's Tale and this lovely picture from his 'comedies and proverbs' series. It will remind everyone of funny, embarrassing youthful holiday experiences.\n\nOn Golden Pond\n\nMark Rydell, 1981\n\nIn his final film, Henry Fonda stars with Katharine Hepburn in a deeply affecting story of an elderly couple spending a last holiday with their estranged daughter (Jane Fonda), her child and fianc√© at the family's idyllic summer house. Fonda and Hepburn keep sentimentality at bay with Oscar-winning performances. As a story of elderly people away from home it's eclipsed by Ozu's Tokyo Story (1953), but that's not strictly a holiday film.\n\nSummer of '42\n\nRobert Mulligan, 1971\n\nSome men have had, and every man would like to have had, a teenage sentimental education in the arms of an older woman one long, hot summer. Sensitive adolescent Gary Grimes loses his virginity to beautiful Jennifer O'Neill, one of the first American war widows of World War Two. A self-consciously nostalgic piece, with Oscar-winning music, immaculate detail, and made while soldiers were dying in Vietnam.\n\nAn Affair to Remember\n\nLeo McCarey, 1957\n\nThe holiday cruise on a luxury liner providing romance, disaster, or both on the high seas has been a movie staple since Hitchcock's Rich and Strange (1931). In this glossy genre classic, a shot-by-shot remake of the same director's 1939 Love Affair, society playboy Cary Grant falls in love with nightclub singer Deborah Kerr on a cruise from New York to the Mediterranean, and they arrange to meet six months later to see if their love endures."
