        "text": "See the full report\n\nAmerica’s capacity to generate carbon-free electricity grew during 2023 — part of a decade-long growth trend for renewable energy. Solar and wind account for more of our nation’s energy mix than ever before.\n\nTo study America’s growing renewable electricity capacity and generation, Climate Central analyzed historical data on solar and wind energy over a 10-year period (2014 to 2023).\n\nThe analysis shows that the amount of electricity produced from solar and wind power increased across the U.S. Our nation generated 238,121 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023 — more than eight times the amount generated a decade earlier in 2014. Wind power has more than doubled this decade, with 425,325 GWh coming from wind installations across the country in 2023. Together, these two renewable energy sources generated enough electricity in 2023 to power the equivalent of more than 61 million average American homes.\n\nThe most solar power generation came from California (68,816 GWh) and Texas (31,739 GWh) in 2023. Texas also led the country in power generated from wind (119,836 GWh).\n\nThese data — combined with federal capacity forecasts — show how renewable energy growth is driving America’s progress toward net-zero carbon emissions targets in the U.S.\n\nThis report and supplementary data show:\n\nHow much solar and wind power increased from 2022 to 2023\n\nGrowth trends in solar and wind power over the past decade (2014-2023)\n\nWhich states are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy\n\nDownload the dataSee the full report\n\nRelated Climate Matters briefs including state-level graphics:\n\nA Decade of Solar Growth\n\nA Decade of Wind Growth\n\nIndex\n\nIntroduction\n\nSolar\n\nSolar-powered States in 2023\n\nA Decade of Solar Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023\n\nWind\n\nWind-powered States in 2023\n\nA Decade of Wind Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023\n\nClean Energy Growth Relative to U.S. Climate Targets\n\nMethodology\n\nIntroduction #\n\nRenewable energy from solar panels and wind turbines is increasingly important in the United States, as costs for these technologies continue to rapidly decline. As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation’s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind – shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\n\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower — a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\n\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\n\nThe key terms in this report — capacity and generation — gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\n\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\n\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.\n\nSee Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\n\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\n\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\n\nSOLAR #\n\nNational Solar Power in 2023\n\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations — an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\n\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\n\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\n\nSolar-powered States in 2023 #\n\nThe states with the most solar capacity in 2023 (combined utility- and small-scale) were California, with 36,461 MW, Texas (18,476 MW), Florida (10,352 MW), North Carolina (7,150 MW), and Arizona (5,848 MW).\n\nThese same five states also generated the most electricity from solar power (utility- and small-scale combined) in 2023 (Figure 1): California (68,816 GWh); Texas (31,739 GWh); Florida (17,809 GWh); North Carolina (12,085 GWh); and Arizona (11,778 GWh).\n\nTexas led the nation in growth from 2022 to 2023 for both solar capacity and generation (Table 1). Texas added 4,996 MW of capacity (37% annual increase) and generated 6,302 GWh more than the previous year (25% annual increase).\n\nCalifornia followed with an addition of 4,714 MW of solar capacity — a 15% increase from 2022. The state produced 5,906 GWh more (9% increase) than the year before.\n\nTable 1. Top states for utility- and small-scale solar (combined) capacity and generation in 2023. Find data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the full dataset.\n\nA Decade of Solar Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\n\nThe U.S. added more than 121 GW of utility- and small-scale solar capacity in total during the last decade — an increase of around 688% (Figure 2). This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\n\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 — an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\n\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\n\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2). Present-day data on solar capacity and generation reflect these strong historical growth trends, as these states were among the highest solar-generating states in 2023.\n\nFigure 2: National solar capacity (GW) by year (2014-2023)\n\nTable 2. Top states for growth in solar (utility- and small-scale combined) capacity and generation from 2014 to 2023. Find data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the full dataset.\n\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023. During 2023, U.S. solar electricity generation peaked in July (26,626 GWh).\n\nFigure 4:Monthly wind generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023. During 2023, U.S. wind generation peaked in March (44,580 GWh).\n\nClimate Central’s WeatherPower™ tool produces daily estimates and forecasts of local solar and wind generation across the continental U.S. Daily forecasts from WeatherPower reflect the influence of weather on local solar and wind generation. WeatherPower data provide a snapshot of solar and wind energy across the U.S., at local scales, on any given day. It can be used to generate figures relevant to any state, media market, county, or congressional district in the continental U.S.\n\nThis WeatherPower graphic shows estimates and forecasts for solar generation in North Carolina in March 2024.\n\nWIND #\n\nNational Wind Power in 2023\n\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from utility-scale onshore and offshore wind installations — an increase of 6 GW or 4% from 2022.\n\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 425,235 GWh of electricity from utility-scale wind installations. This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\n\nFigure 5: National wind electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\n\nWind-powered States in 2023 #\n\nThe states with the most wind capacity in 2023 were Texas, with 40,652 MW; Iowa (12,803 MW); Oklahoma (12,245 MW); Kansas (9,043 MW); and Illinois (7,874 MW).\n\nThese same five states also generated the most electricity from wind power in 2023: Texas (119,836 GWh); Iowa (41,869 GWh); Oklahoma (37,731 GWh); Kansas (27,462 GWh); and Illinois (22,054 GWh) (Figure 5).\n\nTexas led the nation in absolute growth from 2022 to 2023 for both wind capacity and generation (Table 3). Texas added 1,309 MW of capacity (3% annual increase) and generated 5,049 GWh more than the previous year (4% annual increase).\n\nArizona and New York standout for their relative growth in wind capacity from 2022 to 2023. Arizona’s capacity increased by 39% (238 MW added), and New York’s by 25% (557 MW added).\n\nTable 3. Top states for utility-scale wind capacity and generation in 2023. Find data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the full dataset.\n\nA Decade of Wind Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\n\nThe U.S. added more than 83 GW of wind capacity during the last decade — an increase of around 130%. This means that wind capacity more than doubled from 2014 to 2023 (Figure 6).\n\nThe amount of electricity produced from wind increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated more than twice as much electricity from wind energy than in 2014 — an increase of 243,580 GWh or 134%.\n\nThe states with the most significant growth in wind capacity during this decade include: Texas, which added 26,658 MW from 2014 to 2023; Oklahoma (8,466 MW); Iowa (7,241 MW); Kansas (6,074 MW); and Illinois (4,347 MW).\n\nFour out of these five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 4). Present-day wind generation reflects these strong historical growth trends, as there is overlap with the highest wind-generating states in 2023.\n\nFigure 6: National wind capacity (GW) by year (2014-2023)\n\nTable 4. Top states for growth in utility-scale wind capacity and generation from 2014 to 2023. Find data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the full dataset.\n\nClean Energy Growth Relative to US Climate Targets #\n\nThe U.S. is among nearly 200 countries that joined the Paris Agreement to limit warming. As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\n\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\n\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\n\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\n\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\n\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.\n\nBy 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).\n\nSolar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).\n\nIn 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\n\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\n\nFigure 7. Measured and modeled net annual U.S. emissions (Gt CO2e). U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have decreased from 2005 to 2020, but even in the most optimistic scenario based on current policies, the U.S. is projected to progress toward, but fall short of, its 2030 target.\n\nFigure 8.Projected solar and wind proportion of electricity capacity under current (optimistic) policy scenarios. Solar and wind (combined) are expected to make up a majority of electricity capacity in most U.S. states by 2035 under optimistic current policy scenarios.\n\nMethodology #\n\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA’s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA’s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA’s electricity data browser.\n\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\n\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people’s lives."
