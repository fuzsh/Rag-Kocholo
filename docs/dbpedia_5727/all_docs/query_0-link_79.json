        "text": "Climate change is an urgent reality affecting cities like Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. More frequent and intense severe weather events, such as flooding and dzuds (extreme winter weather), have led to recurrent climate migration crises in recent years. The Asia Resilient Cities (ARC) Project is working with residents to solve climate-related problems and advocate for their needs. This includes partnering with youth, who are often excluded from urban planning. Funded by USAID, ARC is implemented by JSI with our partner The Asia Foundation in Ulaanbaatar.\n\nARC uses creative approaches to engage residents, like the Resilient City Hackathon held in Ulaanbaatar in June 2024. Twenty-five 18–29-year-old Ulaanbaatar residents were selected to participate in the hackathon through an application process and organized into five teams. Each team was asked to design innovative solutions to the climate-related problems facing residents of Ulaanbaatar’s ger areas (unplanned settlements), with a focus on resilience, community engagement, and sustainability. Each team included youth with experience living or working in ger areas.\n\nIn this piece, we have summarized the experience of Munkhshur Erdenebat, ARC Project Officer in Ulaanbaatar, during the hackathon and discuss why youth are critical to the city’s climate change response.\n\nWhy focus on Ulaanbaatar’s ger areas and choose a hackathon approach?\n\nApproximately 60 percent of Ulaanbaatar’s residents live in gers (traditional Mongolian yurts) in settlements that lack basic infrastructure such as sanitation, a clean water supply, and heating. Residents experience poverty, pollution, floods, and related health problems.\n\nARC organized a hackathon because its collaborative and intensive nature facilitates creation of awareness of critical issues and development of practical, sustainable, and community-centered solutions. To help the five participating teams develop their solutions, the hackathon included guest-speaker sessions to learn about ger areas; a visit to the Ger Innovation Hub, a community center run by ARC partner organization GerHub NGO; and a chance to work closely with mentors, including Munkhshur, and other subject experts.\n\nWhat was GerHub NGO’s role in the hackathon?\n\nGerHub NGO has worked with The Asia Foundation for many years. The organization has a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities in ger areas, and extensive experience in implementing projects that involve those communities. Instead of using a top-down approach, GerHub NGO engages and provides a platform for ger area residents to share their thoughts and ideas, and partner in the implementation of solutions. It has been organizing hackathons that use design thinking methods since 2020. Its expertise and grassroots relationships helped ensure that the solutions developed during ARC’s hackathon were relevant, feasible, and helpful for ger area residents.\n\nHow did the hackathon use design and systems thinking?\n\nThe Resilient Cities Hackathon taught participants to use design and systems thinking methods to identify problems and root causes and come up with ideas to overcome them. Since systems thinking was a relatively new concept for the hackathon participants, the five-day event began with an introduction to the approach’s terminology and application.\n\nSystems thinking helps people understand elements, interconnections, and relationships within a city or neighborhood. For example, understanding the increasing frequency of floods in ger areas requires examining how climate change exacerbates natural disasters, and the effect of those disasters on the rural herders who migrate to urban areas and settle in flood-prone districts because of land shortages in Ulaanbaatar. Design thinking involves five phases and focuses on understanding people’s needs, empathizing with their experiences, and developing human-centric solutions. By integrating these approaches, the hackathon ensured that the solutions were holistic, user-focused, and effective."
