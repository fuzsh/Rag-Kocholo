        "text": "The U.S. Drought Monitor depicts the location and intensity of drought across the country. The map uses 5 classifications: Abnormally Dry (D0), showing areas that may be going into or are coming out of drought, and four levels of drought (D1–D4).\n\nThis map is used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to trigger some disaster declarations and loan eligibility. Individual states and water supply planning may use additional information to inform their declarations and actions. Learn more.\n\nHow has drought impacted this state in the past? Viewexamples of past drought impacts or explore historical Drought Monitor maps.\n\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor 1-week change map shows where drought has improved, remained the same, or worsened since the previous week's Drought Monitor.\n\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor depicts the location and intensity of drought across the country, using 5 classifications (D0–D4). Green hues indicate conditions improved, while yellow/orange hues indicate degradations.\n\nThe Multi-Indicator Drought Index (MIDI) looks at current drought conditions across the U.S. by integrating several key drought indices on precipitation and moisture into one objective, computer-generated map.\n\nThe Short-Term MIDI approximates drought impacts from changes in precipitation and moisture over a short-term timeframe (looking back up to 90 days), such as impacts to non-irrigated agriculture, topsoil moisture, and range and pasture conditions. Long-term droughts (lasting months to years) can have different impacts.\n\nThis experimental map is based on methodology from the NOAA National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center.

Long-term drought conditions can also increase wildfire intensity and severity.\n\nThis experimental map is based on methodology from the NOAA National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center.
