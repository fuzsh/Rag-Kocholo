An estimated 44.2 million Americans lived in these households.\n\nOne in 20 (5.1 percent) households in the U.S. experienced very low food security, a more severe form of food insecurity, where households report regularly skipping meals or reducing intake because they could not afford more food.\n\nChildren: Over 1 in 6 households with children (17.3 percent) experienced food insecurity, an increase of 40 percent compared to 2021.\n\nRace and ethnicity: Black (22.4 percent) and Latinx (20.8 percent) households are disproportionately impacted by food insecurity, with food insecurity rates more than double double the rate of White non-Latinx households (9.3 percent).\n\nRural: Households in rural areas experienced deeper struggles with hunger compared to those in metro areas (cities + suburbs). In 2022, 14.7 percent of households in rural areas experienced food insecurity compared to 12.5 percent of households in metro areas.\n\nGeography: The food insecurity rate is highest in the South (14.5 percent), followed by the Midwest (12.4 percent), the Northeast (11.6 percent), and the West (11.2 percent).\n\nThe prevalence of food insecurity varied considerably by state, ranging from 6.2 percent in New Hampshire to 16.6 percent in Arkansas (for the three-year period of 2020-2022).\n\nReport: Household Food Security in the United States in 2022\n\nCharts, including state map: Key Statistics and Graphics about Hunger in 2022\n\nUpdated 10/25/2023\n\nPoverty Quick Facts\n\nOverall poverty: According to the official poverty rate, 37.9 million people (11.5 percent) lived in poverty in 2022, unchanged from 2021. However, according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which accounts for cost of living and the receipt of social safety net programs, the poverty rate increased by 60%, from 25.6 million people (7.8 percent) in 2021 to 40.9 million people (12.4 percent) in 2022.\n\nIncome: After accounting for inflation, real median household income declined by 2.3 percent, from $76,330 in 2021 to $74,580 in 2022.\n\nContext: Normally, the SPM is higher than the official poverty rate. In 2020 and 2021 it was lower than the official poverty rate, reflecting the impact of expansions to federal assistance programs during the pandemic. Conversely, in 2022, the higher value of the SPM reflects the end of pandemic-era assistance.\n\nPoverty rates using the comprehensive Supplemental Poverty Measure for specific groups:\n\nChildren: 1 in 8 (12.4 percent or 9.0 million) children lived in poverty in 2022, more than double the number of children in poverty in 2021 (5.2 percent or 3.8 million).\n\nRace/Ethnicity: In 2022, the supplemental poverty measure was much higher for Black individuals (17.2 percent), Latinx individuals (19.3 percent), and Native American and Alaska Native individuals (23.2 percent) than for White individuals (9.1 percent). All rates reflect an increase from 2021. Higher rates of poverty in Black, Latinx and Native communities are due to systemic racism that results in neighborhood disinvestment, occupational segregation, wage discrimination, etc.\n\nGeography: Nationally, the Southern region had the highest average poverty rate (13.7 percent) followed by the Western region (13.4 percent), the Northeast region (11.9) and the Midwest region (9.1 percent).\n\nRole of the Federal Nutrition Programs: The federal nutrition programs lifted more people out of poverty in 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020. In 2022, SNAP lifted 3.7 million people out of poverty, 1.4 of whom were children, school meals lifted 1.5 million people out of poverty, 830,000 of which were children, and WIC lifted 164,000 people out of poverty, 98,000 of whom were children.\n\nOn September 12, 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau released its latest reports Poverty in the United States: 2022, Income in the United States: 2022, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2022.\n\nCensus Data Reveals Surge in Poverty\n\nOn September 12, 2023, the Census released data on poverty in the U.S. for 2022. We learned that, from 2021 to 2022, the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) increased by 60 percent overall and more than doubled among children. This significant increase in poverty is likely due to the end of pandemic-era programs and is one of many indicators that hunger is also on the rise.

When there is talk about improving opportunities for all Americans through education, health care, and the economy, addressing hunger and poverty must be a part of that conversation.\n\nEducation\n\nThe last thing on a hungry child’s mind is learning. Children are better equipped to learn when they have the nutrition they need. Yet too many low-income children who are eligible for free and reduced-price meals are not accessing them. More must be done to increase participation in school meals, summers meals, afterschool meals, and child care meals.\n\nHealth care\n\nResearch shows that food insecurity is linked with costly chronic diseases and unfavorable outcomes. According to the Root Cause Coalition, the annual costs of hunger to the U.S. health care system are $130.5 billion. Greater investments in nutrition programs would go a long way in addressing obesity and other negative health outcomes faced by low-income Americans.\n\nEconomy\n\nSNAP serves as the first line of defense against hunger for millions of Americans. The program also stimulates the economy. Recent census data shows that SNAP lifted 3.6 million people out of poverty in 2016. In addition, USDA research shows that each $5 of SNAP benefits generates nearly twice that in economic activity. Federal nutrition programs can’t do it alone. There must be a comprehensive approach.\n\nRecent Publications & Data\n\nSee More Resources\n\nReport\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) is a critical program that provides people with low incomes, including women, LGBTQIA+ people, and their families with essential food assistance. SNAP helps ensure that women and LGBTQIA+ people can meet their basic needs and supports their well-being. But while SNAP plays a crucial role in alleviating food insufficiency for women and families, currently, there are barriers that prevent food-insecure women, especially those facing multiple forms of discrimination, from fully accessing and benefiting from SNAP.
