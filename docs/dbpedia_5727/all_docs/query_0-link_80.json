        "text": "VA is hosting VetFest events nationwide to inform Veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors about the PACT Act and help them access the health care and benefits they’ve earned. A list of VetFest events near you is at the bottom of this post and will be updated as additional events and details become available.\n\nAttendees will have the opportunity to:\n\nMeet VA representatives: Talk to VA health care and benefits professionals who can answer your questions about how the PACT Act impacts your eligibility and help you navigate the application process.\n\nApply for benefits: Get assistance with filing for PACT Act-related benefits, submitting an intent to file, or enrolling in VA health care.\n\nToxic exposure screenings: Receive a screening by VA staff to determine if you may be eligible for benefits due to toxic exposure.\n\nThe PACT Act (Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act) is the largest expansion of Veteran health care and benefits in generations. It specifically benefits Veterans who served in the Vietnam War, Gulf War, and post-9/11 eras and were exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances. PACT Act also extends eligibility to survivors of these exposed Veterans.\n\nYou can find additional events in your local area by visiting the VA Facility Locator to find a facility near you or by visiting VA Outreach events.\n\nVA is committed to ensuring all eligible Veterans and survivors receive the benefits they deserve under the PACT Act. If you are unable to attend a VetFest event, you can still learn more and access resources online by visiting:\n\nThe PACT Act and your VA benefits\n\nPACT Act Performance Dashboard\n\nThe PACT Act: 2024 Expanded Health Care Eligibility Toolkit\n\nVetFest events near you:\n\nAlabama – AL\n\nJune 11, 2024, Montgomery, AL: Central Alabama Summer VetFest\n\nJune 14, 2024, 10 a.m. – 12 p.m. CT, Fayette, AL: Northwest Alabama Veterans’ Town Hall (Fayette)\n\nAlaska – AK\n\nAug. 21, 2024, Palmer, AK: Summer VetFest Alaska\n\nAug. 28, 2024, Palmer, AK: Summer VetFest Alaska\n\nArizona – AZ\n\nJune 27, 2024, 9 a.m. – 1 p.m. MST, Phoenix, AZ: PACT Act Summer VetFest\n\nJuly 5, 2024, 5:30 – 8:30 p.m. MST, Prescott, AZ: Prescott Frontier Days Rodeo\n\nJuly 6, 2024, 11:30 a.m. – 8:30 p.m. MST, Prescott, AZ: Prescott Frontier Days Rodeo\n\nArkansas – AR\n\nJune 24, 2024, North Little Rock, AR: 2024 Central Arkansas VA Healthcare System Summer VetFest\n\nSept. 12, 2024, 10 a.m. – 2 p.m. CT, Fayetteville, AR: Health Summit\n\nCalifornia – CA\n\nJune 3, 2024, 10 a.m. – 2 p.m. PT, Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara VA 101: Overview on VA Benefits\n\nJune 11, 2024, 10 a.m. – 3 p.m. PT, San Jacinto, CA: Tribal Health PACT Act Outreach & VA/RSBCIHI Outreach Collaboration\n\nJune 13, 2024, 6 – 7 p.m. PT, Bakersfield, CA: Bakersfield Veterans Town Hall\n\nJune 18, 2024, Commerce, CA: East LA Summer VetFest\n\nJune 22, 2024, San Diego, CA: VetFest Kearny Mesa\n\nColorado – CO\n\nAug. 29, 2024, 5:30 p.m. MDT, Grand Junction, CO: Veteran’s Night Grand Junction Farmers Market\n\nNov. 19 – 21, 2024, 8 a.m. – 4 p.m. MDT, Colorado Springs, CO: El Paso PACT ACT Healthcare and Claims Clinic\n\nConnecticut – CT\n\nJuly 13, 2024, Waterford, CT: PACT Act Health Care and Claims Clinic\n\nDelaware – DE\n\nJuly 24, 2024, Harrington, DE: VA Outreach Event at Armed Forces Day\n\nFlorida – FL\n\nJune 7, 2024, Key West, FL: LGBTQ+ VetFest\n\nJune 11, 2024, Boca Raton, FL: Summer VetFest\n\nJune 14, 2024, Jacksonville, FL: North Florida and South Georgia VetFest for Women Veterans\n\nJuly 10, 2024, Belle Glade, FL: West Palm Beach VetFest\n\nJune 22, 2024, Spring Hill, FL: Paco/Hernando Summer VetFest\n\nGeorgia – GA\n\nJune 8, 2024, 10 a.m. – 2 p.m. ET, Johns Creek, GA: Atlanta VA & Warrior Alliance PACT Act Rally\n\nJune 29, 2024, Dublin, GA: PACT Act Summer VetFest\n\nJuly 27, 2024, 9 – 10:30 a.m. ET, Decatur, GA: July 27th Veteran Town Hall\n\nHawaii – HI\n\nAug. 10, 2024, Kapolei, HI: Summer VetFest\n\nIdaho – ID\n\nAug. 28, 2024, Boise, ID: Boise VA Medical Center Veterans Appreciation Fair\n\nIllinois – IL\n\nJune 8, 2024, 9 a.m. – 3 p.m. CT, Hines, IL: Hines VA Health and Benefits Fair\n\nJune 8, 2024, 12 – 5 p.m. CT, Berwyn, IL: Combined Veterans Community Lunch and Expo (VetFest)\n\nJuly 18, 2024, 5:30 – 7:30 p.m. CT, Mt.
