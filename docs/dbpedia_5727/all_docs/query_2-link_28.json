        "text": "The musical version of the beloved Herman Raucher novel and 1971 film about a teen's coming of age with a lonely war bride had developmental readings or performances at York Theatre Company, Goodspeed Musicals and elsewhere before having a brief commercial Off-Broadway run that began in December 2001.\n\nThe libretto is by Hunter Foster (widely known as a Broadway leading man), the music and lyrics are by David Kirshenbaum (Vanities). Its post-Off-Broadway life included a special May 2005 concert presentation (of the entire show) at the York, where the musical had an early reading. The cast stepped into a recording studio the next day.\n\nThe show is licensed by Dramatists Play Services and has enjoyed a regional life (Round House Theatre in Bethesda, MD, will stage the show this spring).\n\nThe recording features the talents of Rachel York as war bride Dorothy, Megan Valerie Walker (Miriam), Celia Keenan-Bolger (Aggie), Joe Gallagher (Benjie), Brett Tabisel (Oscy), Ryan Driscoll (as lovestruck Hermie), Ayal Miodovnik (Pete), Danielle Ferland (Gloria) and Bill Buell (Mr. Sanders, Walter Winchell).\n\nThere are 41 tracks on two discs, representing the score and script. According to Jay, \"Relive the summer you'll always remember! This show, which has played off-Broadway and around the country, comes home to the theatre where it had its first readingâ€¦\"\n\nMusical director is Lynne Shankel.
