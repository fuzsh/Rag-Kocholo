        "text": "Richard Gere (born August 31, 1949, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.) is an American actor and humanitarian, perhaps best known for his portrayal of genteel characters in romantic films.\n\nGere spent his childhood in upstate New York. In 1967 he enrolled at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship but left college after two years to work as a musician. He performed in numerous bands and began acting in summer programs throughout New England. After performing with the Provincetown Players on Cape Cod and with the Seattle Repertory Theatre, he was cast as an understudy in the rock musical Grease on Broadway in 1972. The following year Gere performed the leading role in a London production of the play. He had a small role in his first film, Report to the Commissioner (1975), but he gained recognition for his performance alongside Diane Keaton in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977), a dark character study of a troubled young woman. Gere became known as a sex symbol for his roles in such films as Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven (1978), about a young couple and their relationship with a farmer in Texas, and American Gigolo (1980), in which he played an escort for older women.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn 1982 Gere starred as the young navy officer candidate Zack Mayo in An Officer and a Gentleman. The film was a box office success, and it established Gere as a major star. After several poorly received films, he scored another hit with Pretty Woman (1990), portraying a wealthy businessman who employs and later falls in love with a prostitute (played by Julia Roberts). He earned critical praise for Primal Fear (1996), a courtroom drama in which he starred as an attorney who defends an altar boy (played by Edward Norton) accused of murdering a prominent priest, and in 1999 he reteamed with Roberts in the lighthearted comedy Runaway Bride.\n\nIn 2002 Gere starred as defense attorney Billy Flynn in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Chicago and won a Golden Globe for his performance. In The Hoax (2006), which was based on a true story, he portrayed Clifford Irving, a writer who pens a false biography of Howard Hughes. Gere later appeared as Billy the Kid, one of six pseudo-biographical embodiments of Bob Dylan, in the critically lauded I’m Not There (2007). In 2008 he reteamed with his Unfaithful (2002) costar Diane Lane in Nights in Rodanthe, a romantic drama based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks. Gere’s later films include Amelia (2009), a biopic about the American aviator Amelia Earhart (played by Hilary Swank), and the crime drama Brooklyn’s Finest (2009). During that same year Gere portrayed a college professor in the film Hachi: A Dog’s Tale that was based on the true story of a loyal Akita. He also appeared in the thriller Arbitrage (2012), in which he starred as a scandal-plagued venture capitalist, and the unsettling drama The Benefactor (2015), in which he played a wealthy drug addict who wheedles and bribes his way into the lives of a young couple. Gere earned critical praise for his portrayal of the title character in Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer (2016). His later credits included the eight-episode BBC series MotherFatherSon (2019)."
