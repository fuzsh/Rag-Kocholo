        "text": "Philippe Petit remembers it like it was yesterday. On Aug. 7, 1974, he made an illegal high-wire walk 1,350 feet above the ground between the Twin Towers.\n\nThe French high-wire artist will look back on his 131-foot walk between the buildings during a show called \"Towering.\" The event will take place on Aug. 7 and Aug. 8 at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine.\n\nâEvery detail, the wind, the vibration of the cable. Itâs in my body and soul, you know, itâs interesting, 50 years later,â he said.\n\nPetit has been an artist-in-residence at the cathedral for more than 42 years. He will walk across the nave of the enormous Morningside Heights cathedral 20 feet above the ground.\n\nâI will have a big stage underneath the wire and audience on both sides, but the thing is my friend Sting will play and sing while I am on the wire,â he said.\n\nSting, singer, songwriter and musician, will perform a world premiere of the song he wrote about Petitâs walk between the towers, which were destroyed during the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nPetit says he has been asked about his thoughts on that day.\n\nâI cannot really compare the loss of 9/11, the loss of two buildings, with the loss of thousands of human lives. You cannot mix that up, so I let people imagine how I felt that day,â he said.\n\nPetit says the performances are a celebration of his accomplishment at the buildings, which just like him, became known worldwide after his feat.\n\nA documentary on the walk called âMan on Wireâ was released in 2008, and a feature film called âThe Walkâ in 2015. At the age of 74, Petit says he has no plans to retire anytime soon.\n\nâIâm not a daredevil. Iâm the opposite. I am somebody who wants to affirm life and inspire people to look up, look at the birds and start flying,â he said."
