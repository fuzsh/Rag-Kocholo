        "text": "Violence & Scariness\n\na little\n\nA pitcher throws a baseball at someone's head and hits him (no lasting injury). Teammates nearly go fist-to-fist but are stopped by their fellow players. A White man threatens Black men by saying that he and a group of other White men will cause \"trouble\" if they don't leave town. One player spikes another in the calf; the wound is later shown being stitched up by a doctor (no blood visible). A character screams in frustration and breaks his bat against a wall. Almost all of this violence is racially motivated, which adds psychological distress to these physical acts of harm.\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Violence & Scariness in your kid's entertainment guide.\n\nGet started\n\nPositive Role Models\n\na lot\n\nJackie Robinson, as portrayed in 42, demonstrates exceptional courage and self-control in the face of virulent racism. He doesn't engage people who ridicule him, nor does he ever instigate any conflicts. Branch Rickey is shown as a man of faith and wisdom who knew he was breaking the \"color line\" in his desire to integrate Major League Baseball. Rickey calls people out on their racism and makes the other players see why whatever inconveniences they faced pale in comparison to the abuse and the threats Jackie faces. Dodgers Pee Wee Reese, Ralph Branca, and Eddie Stanky come around to be supportive of Robinson, and at least some of the characters who exhibit racism are punished/penalized.\n\nDiverse Representations\n\nsome\n\n42 centers around an important moment of progress in American civil rights history. Black actor Chadwick Boseman shines as Robinson, even if the script does make him out to be more \"perfect\" than human. But the film is written and directed by a White man, and White saviors populate the story to varying degrees -- most notably manager Branch Rickey, who \"discovers\" Robinson and spends most of his screen time heroically defending the Black player against racists. Overall, the film's take on racism is shallow and takes too many pains to ensure that its viewers come away feeling good about this moment in time rather than curious about how racism still exists in major league sports. In other areas of representation, Robinson's wife is a cookie-cutter housewife who exists solely to root for her husband from the stands, get pregnant, have a baby, give her husband endless emotional support, and look immaculate while doing it.\n\nDid we miss something on diversity? Suggest an update.\n\nParents need to know that 42 is a feel-good biopic about the two years in which Major League Baseball legend Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) broke the sport's color barrier. It's not a complete biography, just a snapshot of the 1946 and 1947 seasons. Expect many (many) instances of White characters using the \"N\" word and other racial slurs, including \"boy,\" \"monkey,\" and \"coon\"; other language includes \"s--t\" and \"a--hole.\" A White man threatens Black men by saying that he and a group of other White men will cause \"trouble\" if they don't leave town. A calf injury is shown being stitched up by a doctor (no blood visible). Fistfights nearly break out; a man is hit in the head with a baseball (no lasting injury). Several kisses, a few more passionate than others. Couples shown in a bedroom or in bed together, talking and embracing (men shirtless, women in chemises). Adults infrequently drink and smoke.The movie spotlights an important moment in American and civil rights history.
