        "text": "Fighting food waste and hunger with food rescue\n\nEvery day, millions of people in the United States struggle to access food while millions of tons of perfectly good groceries go to waste. As the nation's largest food rescue organization, we're changing that!\n\nWe connect stores, restaurants, farms, and food banks to save nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste. Every rescued meal means more food for our neighbors experiencing food insecurity. Together, we can make sure everyone has access to healthy food and good food never goes to waste.\n\nWe’re rallying people committed to ending hunger\n\nAs the largest food rescue organization, we have set an aggressive goal of $50 million to rescue 1 billion more pounds of food annually—for a total of 5 billion pounds. Find out how you can support the Food Rescue Fund.\n\nOn\n\nFood waste statistics in the US\n\nIn the United States, people waste 92 billion pounds of food annually, equal to 145 billion meals. They throw away over $473 billion worth of food annually. Shockingly, they waste 38% of all the food in America.\n\nWhat is food waste?\n\nFood waste is perfectly good, safe-to-eat food that gets thrown away instead of eaten. It happens at home, in stores, restaurants, and farms. Food gets wasted because of things like:\n\nUgly or oddly shaped fruits and veggies\n\nUpcoming sell-by or expiration dates (food is often still safe to eat)\n\nOverproduction at farms\n\nFood getting damaged during transport\n\nThe environmental impact\n\nFood waste is a major contributor to climate change. It's responsible for 8% of all global carbon emissions, making up most items in our landfills. Growing food requires lots of water, fuel, and fertilizer.\n\nBy preventing food waste and rescuing food at risk of being discarded, we can lessen our environmental impact and ensure that resources are used to nourish communities.\n\nHow food rescue works\n\nFood rescue is one of our most powerful weapons in the fight against food waste. We work side-by-side with food donors like grocery stores, farmers, and restaurants. Together, we find perfectly good food that’s nearing its sell-by date, has cosmetic imperfections, or just didn’t sell.\n\nInstead of ending up in landfills, this food gets a second chance.\n\nBenefits of food rescue\n\nBy supporting food rescue, you’re helping us create a future where no one experiences food insecurity and good food never goes to waste.\n\nJoin the movement!\n\nHelp us end hunger and stop food waste. Here's how you can get involved:\n\nDonate\n\nYour support helps us rescue even more food.\n\nDonate now ›\n\nVolunteer\n\nSort, pack, or even glean food from farms.\n\nGet involved ›\n\nReduce your food waste\n\nPlan meals, store food properly, and get creative with leftovers.\n\nLearn more ›\n\nInvolve your company\n\nPartner with Feeding America to start a food rescue program.\n\nLearn more ›\n\nExplore more about food rescue\n\nCheck out food rescue stories and learn how you can help reduce food waste.\n\nA personal mission to end food waste, one grocery store at a time\n\nMeet Tom Hong, a food bank employee who's made it his personal mission to help end food waste in the United States, one grocery store at a time.\n\nRead More\n\nWhat is MealConnect?
