This is just not a good film. Robert Mulligan was an excellent filmmaker but the time and effort he puts into making sure this film clatters through every bloody clichÃ© out there is almost incalculable.

This is just not a good film.\n\nRobert Mulligan was an excellent filmmaker but the time and effort he puts into making sure this film clatters through every bloody clichÃ© out there is almost incalculable. Even the one really good scene here, where Gary Grimes tries to buy some condoms, is, as you can see from that description of it, a huge clichÃ© in itself. If still quite funny.\n\nEvery single scene in this film could have been seen in dozens of other films. I'm not necessarily suggesting those are any better than this, but I've rarely seen a film so completely committed to unoriginality than this. Perhaps even more disappointing are the flat and unconvincing performances from Jennifer O'Neill and Gary Grimes, like they themselves didn't believe in what they were doing.\n\nCan't say I blame them."
