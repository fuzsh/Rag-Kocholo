        "text": "Aug 1, 2024 | Consumer Electronics\n\nApple iPhone sales revenue 2007-2024\n\nIn the third quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, Apple generated around 39 billion U.S. dollars in revenue from the sales of iPhones.\n\nApple iPhone revenue\n\nThe Apple iPhone is one of the biggest success stories in the smartphone industry. Since its introduction to the market in 2007, Apple has sold more than 1.5 billion units worldwide. As of the third quarter of 2024, the Apple iPhone’s market share of new smartphone sales was over 16 percent. Much of its accomplishments can be attributed to Apple’s ability to keep the product competitive throughout the years, with new releases and updates.\n\nApple iPhone growth\n\nThe iPhone has shown to be a crucial product for Apple, considering that the iPhone’s share of the company’s total revenue has consistently grown over the years. In the first quarter of 2009, the iPhone sales were responsible for about a quarter of Apple’s revenue. In the third quarter of FY 2024, this figure reached a high of roughly 50 percent, equating to less than 40 billion U.S. dollars in that quarter. In terms of units sold, Apple went from around 55.8 million units in 2010 to about 232 million in 2023, but registered a peak in the fourth quarter of 2020 with more than 90 million iPhones sold worldwide.\n\nAug 1, 2024 | B2C E-Commerce\n\nAmazon quarterly net sales revenue 2007-2024\n\nDuring the second quarter 2024, Amazon generated total net sales of nearly 148 billion U.S. dollars, surpassing the 134 billion U.S. dollars in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nFrom books to billions\n\nLaunched in 1995 in the United States as an online bookshop, Amazon has since grown into an international e-commerce giant. In April 2023 worldwide visits to amazon.com amounted to over two billion considering both desktop and mobile traffic.\n\nPrime time in the U.S.\n\nAlthough a global company, Amazon truly thrives in the United States where the company is the leading e-commerce platform by sales value. In the North American country, the number of subscribers using Amazon Prime services has been growing steadily over the last several years and is forecast to reach new heights in 2024.\n\nAug 1, 2024 | Social Media & User-Generated Content\n\nU.S. Facebook users 2024, by age group\n\nAs of July 2024, 24.2 percent of Facebook users in the United States were aged between 25 and 34 years, making up Facebook’s largest audience in the country. Overall, 19 percent of users belonged to the 18 to 24-year age group.\n\nDoes everyone in the U.S. use Facebook?\n\nIn 2021, there were approximately 240 million Facebook users in the U.S., a figure which is projected to steadily increase, and reach 260 million by 2027. Social media users in the United States have a very high awareness of the social media giant. Expectedly, 94 percent of users had heard of the brand as of the beginning of 2022. Although the vast majority of U.S. social networkers knew of Facebook, the likeability of the platform was not so impressive at 67 percent. Nonetheless, usage, loyalty, and buzz around the brand remained relatively high.\n\nFacebook, Meta, and the metaverse\n\nA strategic rebranding from Facebook to Meta Platforms in late 2021 boded well for the company in Mark Zuckerberg’s attempt to be strongly linked to the metaverse, and to be considered more than just a social media company. According to a survey conducted in the U.S. in early 2022, Meta Platforms is the brand that Americans most associated with the metaverse.\n\nAug 1, 2024 | Basketball\n\nNBA all-time scoring list 1946-2024\n\nIn February 2023, LeBron James broke the NBA all-time points record, scoring 38 points in the LA Lakers' 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Following the game, James' total stood at 38,390. The previous record holder, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, had scored 38,387 points for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Lakers in an illustrious 20-year career spanning from 1969 to 1989. As of August 2024, James had a total of 40,474 points, breaking the 40 thousand points mark in a loss to the Denver Nuggets.\n\nWho has scored the most points in NBA playoffs?\n\nThis statistic only shows points scored in regular-season NBA games and does not take the playoffs into account. Prior to breaking the all-time points record, LeBron James already held the record for the most points scored in NBA playoffs, which stood at 8,023 points as of June 2023. He is also the career leader for the Cleveland Cavaliers, for which he played a total of 11 seasons, in many important statistical categories like points, assists, rebounds, steals, and games played. James has been similarly dominant off the court, being the highest-paid player in the NBA, with total earnings close to 120 million U.S. dollars in the 2023/24 season.\n\nWho has the most NBA assists?\n\nAfter a career spanning 19 years with the Utah Jazz, John Stockton holds the all-time record for the most assists in the NBA. In his time with the Jazz, Stockton made a total 15,806 assists and was a 10-time All-Star, however, never won an NBA championship. Ranked second and third for assists were Jason Kidd and Chris Paul, respectively.\n\nAug 2, 2024 | Mobile Devices\n\nShare of mobile operating systems in India 2012-2023\n\nIn 2023, Android held a share of 95.17 percent of the mobile operating system market in India. This was followed by Apple's iOS, a distant second, with 3.98 percent market share. Android went from just above 10 percent in 2012 to more than 60 percent within four years.\n\nMobile operating systems in India - additional information\n\nAndroid gained its dominant position in the mobile operating system market in India since 2015 when it first reached more than 50 percent of the market share. The Indian OS market has seen a rapid transformation since the beginning of 2012 when Symbian held over 65 percent of the market. In the following few years, the operating system, which was used in most Nokia smartphones, has seen its market share fall to nothing.\n\nAndroid’s dominance in the Indian smartphone industry is echoed in the global market where the operating system held over 70 percent of the smartphone market at the end of 2023. In the United States, however, more than half of the smartphone users had an iPhone as of March 2024. Android’s closest rival in the global operating system market is Apple’s iOS, which held over 24 percent of the market share of smartphone shipments as of the fourth quarter of 2023. However, as yet, Apple has not broken into the Indian market, although its market share has grown steadily since the start of 2012, it still remained just below four percent.\n\nAug 2, 2024 | Passenger Cars\n\nBestselling SUVs South Korea 2023\n\nIn 2023, the Kia Sportage was the bestselling sports utility vehicle (SUV) model in South Korea with more than 69 thousand units sold. Kia Motors boasted the top four models featured on the list.\n\nOf the most popular SUVs shown in this statistic, the Sante Fe from Hyundai and the Carnival from Kia are considered large SUVs. In contrast, Kia's Seltos and Hyundai’s Kona are compact SUVs, with the Seltos being developed specifically to counter the success of Kona and Tivoli.\n\nMost popular models of SUVs\n\nThe four most popular models of SUVs in the Korean market are: the Santa Fe and Kona from Hyundai; the Sorento from Kia, and the Tivoli from SsangYong. The Tivoli played an important role in the popularization of compact SUVs. Since its introduction in 2015, as the first new model from SsangYong after its acquisition by India’s Mahindra & Mahindra, the Tivoli was the most-sold compact SUV. However, it was then overtaken by Kona in 2018. From 2015 to 2017, the Tivoli sold over 45,000 and then 50,500 cars each year. This was more than any other competitor on the market at the time. In its first year, it sold more than every other compact SUV competitor combined. The Kona was first released in 2018.\n\nWhy SUVs are popular in South Korea\n\nSUVs in South Korea have experienced a wave of popularity in recent years, ranging from large SUVs, such as the Sorento, to compact SUVs, such as the Tivoli. In fact, nearly half of the automobiles sold in South Korea were SUVs. A key reason being SUVs are simply bigger; they are versatile and can meet a wide variety of needs. They are especially attractive to the increasing number of people who want to enjoy their leisure time. Technological advances mean the traditional disadvantages of SUVs, poor comfort and fuel economy, have been overcome. Meanwhile, compact SUVs have surged in popularity, especially thanks to the SsangYong Tivoli. Hyundai developed the Kona specifically to challenge the Tivoli in the domestic market. In contrast to traditional SUVs, which are mostly popular among men in their 40s and 50s, the Tivoli is particularly popular among youths and women. This is possibly due to design variations and its reasonable cost and size.\n\nAug 15, 2024 | Key Economic Indicators\n\nQuarterly GDP growth of the UK 2019-2024\n\nGross domestic product in the United Kingdom grew by 0.6 percent in the second quarter of 2024, compared with 0.7 percent in the previous quarter, the strongest quarterly GDP growth since 2021. The UK economy ended 2023 in recession, with negative growth reported in the last two quarters of 2023. GDP growth in the third quarter of 2023 was -0.1 percent, followed by -0.,4 percent in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter of 2020 the UK experienced record setting growth of 16.8 percent, which itself followed the record 20.3 percent contraction in Q2 2020.\n\nSunak's economic struggles\n\nWith the next UK election set to take place by January 2025, the current Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, will have hoped for better economic news heading into 2024. One year earlier, at the start of 2023, he banked much of his credibility on turning the UK's economies woes around, pledging to halve inflation, while growing the economy and reducing the national debt. Although inflation did fall significantly, from 10.1 percent in January to four percent in December, annual economic growth was just 0.1 percent, and as already seen, was shrinking towards the end of the year. The national debt has also increased slightly, although it is expected to fall towards the end of the 2020s.\n\nStrong labor market defies weak economy\n\nAfter a robust 2022, the UK labor market remained resilient throughout 2023. The unemployment rate at the end of 2023 was 3.8 percent, the same as at the start of the year, and one of the lowest rates on record. While job vacancies have fallen from their 2022 peak, there were still 932,000 vacancies at the start of 2024 compared with around 820,000 in the months before the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if the recession at the end of 2023 will catch up with the UK's job market. Recent forecasts from the Autumn 2023 budget suggest a modest increase in 2024, and 2025, with an annual unemployment rate of 4.6 percent anticipated."
