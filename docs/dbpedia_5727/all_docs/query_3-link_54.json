        "text": "When I was 15, and my family\n\ncame to the island for the summer...\n\n... there weren't nearly as many houses\n\nor people as there are now.\n\nThe geography of the island\n\nand the singularity of the sea...\n\n... were far more noticeable then.\n\nAnd if a guy wasn't to die of loneliness,\n\nhis family made certain...\n\n... that other families from his neighborhood\n\ncontributed other kids to the island.\n\nLook out, Hermie.\n\nLook out.\n\nPresent with me in the summer of '42...\n\n... were Oscy, my best friend.\n\nAnd Benjie, my next to best friend.\n\nWe called ourselves \"The Terrible Trio. \"\n\nAnd that house up there...\n\n... that was her house.\n\nAnd nothing, from that first day I saw her...\n\n... and no one\n\nthat has happened to me since...\n\n... has ever been as frightening\n\nand as confusing.\n\nFor no person I've ever known...\n\n... has ever done more\n\nto make me feeI more sure...\n\n... more insecure...\n\n... more important...\n\n... and less significant.\n\nHe's gonna take her\n\nright into that bedroom.\n\nHe better put the wood down first.\n\nFunny.\n\nHey, come on!\n\nOscy, for Christ's sakes!\n\nHey, come on, Hermie.\n\nWill you move your ass, please?\n\nGive it back, Oscy!\n\nBoy, I'd like to feel every one of those girls.\n\nYou know, I should've tripped on them.\n\nThey'd never know I was getting a feel.\n\nThat's not the way to do it.\n\nSo what is the way to do it?\n\nYou have to say things.\n\nAll right, so I'll say, ''Excuse me. ''\n\nYou know what I mean.\n\nYou just can't go up to a girl\n\nand fall on her.\n\n- It isn't done.\n\n- Why not?\n\nI did it with Gladys Potter.\n\nShe was only 12 years old.\n\nWhat did she know?\n\nI don't know.\n\nShe didn't seem to mind though.\n\nWell, she was surprised.\n\nHell, so was I. She had nothing to feel.\n\nCome on, Benjie, stop dragging.\n\nI don't know what's gonna become of him.\n\nHe has no emotions.\n\nHe's just confused.\n\nYeah. So am I.\n\nI've been waking up lately,\n\nin the middle of the night.\n\nA lot.\n\nYeah, that's okay. I do, too.\n\n- You do?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nI wake up feeling crazy\n\nand thinking about Vera Miller.\n\n- So what?\n\n- So, I hate Vera Miller.\n\nJesus!\n\nYou think I'm in love with her?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI hope I'm not in love with her. I hate her!\n\nWhat kind of thoughts\n\ndo you have about her?\n\nWell, I forget.\n\n- Then how can I help you?\n\n- Who the hell is asking you to help me?\n\n- What are you guys talking about?\n\n- Nothing you'd understand.\n\nScrew you!\n\nYeah, that's your whole problem, Benjie.\n\nYou're only interested in screwing me.\n\n- Why don't you try screwing a girl?\n\n- Okay.\n\n''Okay,'' he says. Boy, that's something.\n\n- You wouldn't know the first thing to do.\n\n- I would so!\n\nOkay, what's the first thing you do?\n\nYou feel them.\n\nWrong! You kiss them.\n\nWe didn't kiss Gladys Potter.\n\nWe weren't in love with Gladys Potter.\n\nIf you're in love with a girl,\n\nyou're supposed to kiss her first.\n\n- Ain't that right, Hermie?\n\n- It's polite.\n\nIt's not required.\n\nIt's required, you ninny!\n\nIt is not!\n\nHow do you know?\n\nBecause I found a book.\n\nIf my mother knew I took that book...\n\nIt doesn't belong to me.\n\nIt doesn't belong to my mother.\n\nIt belongs to the house.\n\nIf you guys get your fingerprints\n\non those pages, it's your funeral.\n\nMy mother's gonna miss that book!\n\nIt's the biggest on the shelf.\n\nTen books fell when I pulled it out.\n\n- Hold it!\n\n- Will you hurry up?\n\nKill me. I don't read as fast as you do.\n\nOkay, turn.\n\nJesus! Do you believe all this stuff?.\n\nIt's a medical journal.\n\nWhy should they lie?\n\nHow do they take pictures like that?\n\n- They must have special cameras.\n\n- What drugstores would develop them?\n\nIf we took film like that to Sanders,\n\nwe'd be put in a reform school.\n\nI guess they develop them themselves.\n\nYeah, I guess that's what they do.\n\n- Let me look.\n\n- Go away. You'll foam at the mouth.\n\n- It's my book.\n\n- Come on, let him look.\n\nThere, they're doing it!\n\n- I don't believe it.\n\n- You'd better believe it.\n\nOne day your turn will come\n\nand you'd better know what to do.\n\nI don't believe it.\n\nMy mother and father never did that!\n\n- Never.\n\n- Why not?\n\nBecause it's stupid!\n\nI hate to break the news,\n\nbut that's the way it's done.\n\nYou better stop pushing me around.\n\nIt could be dangerous. It could.\n\nBenjie, if you just look at the pictures,\n\nit does look dumb.\n\nBut if two people are in love,\n\nit's supposed to be very pleasant.\n\nHow do you know? You've never done it!\n\nWell, it's right here in the book.\n\nIn black and white and color.\n\nThat's why people kiss first.\n\nIt gives them a chance to know each other.\n\nOnce they get to know each other,\n\nthey fall in love, then they make love.\n\nForeplay! It's called foreplay.\n\nEveryone takes off their clothes\n\nand they play foreplay.\n\nThen he does this and she does this,\n\nand he does this.\n\nAnd before you know it, they're screwing!\n\nNow what could be simpler than that?\n\nNow, listen, before I saw these pictures,\n\nI didn't think it was possible either.\n\nBut these are pictures, Benjie, pictures!\n\nThese aren't drawings.\n\nI've seen those drawings.\n\nThese are pictures!\n\nIn an emergency, it could mount...\n\n...350 caliber jobs.\n\nProbably handle about...\n\n...a dozen or so depth charges.\n\nIt'd sink if it hit a fish.\n\nStripped down it could do 30 or 40 knots.\n\nThirty or 40 knots?\n\nThirty or 40 knots straight down.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nTwo, three, four, five...\n\nOne, two, three, four, five...\n\nSixty-nine, seventy.\n\nI wish somebody\n\nwould invade this dopey island.\n\nI'm going mad!\n\nHey, Oscy, it's that lady again.\n\nHermie, you're not gonna go into\n\nanother deathlike trance again, are you?\n\nI swear, Hermie,\n\nI don't know what's come over you.\n\nThat's a very old person over there.\n\nI don't see the attraction.\n\nMaybe it's her mind.\n\nMaybe their minds meet and say, ''Hello. ''\n\nWhy don't you go\n\nand say hello to her mind, Hermie?\n\nGo on, go say hello.\n\nCut it out.\n\nCome on. If she's the love of your life,\n\ngo say hello to her.\n\nCome on, we want to see you go say hello.\n\nMaybe you're some kind of a hotshot lover\n\nwe don't know about.\n\n- Cut it out!\n\n- Say hello.\n\n- Knock it off!\n\n- Come on!\n\nCome on. Go say hello to her, Hermie.\n\n- Go say hello to her.\n\n- Yeah, go say hello.\n\nCome on, we want to see you go say hello.\n\nHey, lady in the pink suit!\n\nIt's Hermie the rape artist!\n\nIt's Jack the Ripper!\n\nIt's Herman the German, Nazi spy!\n\n- It's a sex fiend!\n\n- It's Hermie the rape artist!\n\nGoddamn!\n\nOscy, I'll...\n\nHey, come on, Herm.\n\nCome on.\n\nWe were only kidding.\n\nHermie, it was a joke!\n\nLook out, Oscy! Look out!\n\nKnock it off, Hermie!\n\nKnock it off! Cut it out!\n\nNow I'm gonna let you go, okay?\n\nOkay, now, I'll let you go.\n\nGoddamn it, Hermie! You're really crazy!\n\nYou're really crazy, you know that? Crazy!\n\nJesus.\n\nIt's enough, goddamn it! Enough!\n\nSon of a b*tch!\n\nJesus!\n\nJesus, Oscy, you killed him.\n\nOh, sh*t!\n\nHey, leave him alone, Benjie.\n\nLeave him alone!\n\nThe son of a b*tch threw sand in my face.\n\n- Goddamn it, I mean...\n\n- We'll see you later, Hermie, okay?\n\nBastards!\n\n- Hermie, where're you going?\n\n- The Planet Mongo.\n\n- It's not even 8:00!"
