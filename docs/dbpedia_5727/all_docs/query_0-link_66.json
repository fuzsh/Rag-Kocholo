        "text": "Visit the Embassy of Ireland’s website for the most current visa information.\n\nYou must have a valid passport to enter Ireland. U.S. citizens can enter visa-free for tourism or business stays of up to 90 days.\n\nThere is no minimum passport validity requirement for U.S. citizens entering Ireland. We recommend you have a passport that is valid for the duration of your stay, evidence of sufficient funds to support your stay in Ireland, and a return airline ticket.\n\nAn increased number of U.S. citizens have been refused entry to Ireland or granted a limited stay because they failed to sufficiently demonstrate their travel intent to Irish immigration officials at the port of entry. You may be asked to provide evidence of sufficient funds to support your stay in Ireland regardless of your purpose of travel. For any travel other than tourism, please ensure you obtain the appropriate documentation prior to travel. You can find more information at the Irish Naturalization and Immigration Service website or by contacting your nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate in the United States.\n\nWe cannot intervene on your behalf when applying for a visa or residency permit, nor can we assist if you are denied entry into Ireland.\n\nTraveling Through Europe: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.\n\nIreland is not a full member of the Schengen Area, which means that if you travel to Ireland from the Schengen Area, you are required to show your passport.\n\nYour passport should be valid for at least three months beyond the period of stay if you plan on transiting a Schengen country.\n\nYou will need sufficient proof of funds and a return plane ticket.\n\nFor additional information about visas for the Schengen area, see the Schengen Visa page.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to Ireland or for foreign residents of Ireland.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction, and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nTerrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\n\nHigh-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)\n\nHotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists\n\nPlaces of worship\n\nSchools\n\nParks\n\nShopping malls and markets\n\nPublic transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)\n\nCrime: Although Ireland has a low rate of violent crime, you should always follow common sense personal security practices and maintain awareness of your surroundings when traveling.\n\nRates of theft and petty crime have risen in recent years, and thieves often target tourists. In rare cases, these crimes involve physical assault or violence, more commonly in Dublin city center and in popular tourist areas.\n\nRental cars are frequently targeted. They are easily identifiable by the rental company stickers on the rear window of the vehicle. If possible, remove these stickers and always lock your car when leaving it unattended. Do not leave valuables unattended in vehicles. When visiting city center areas, park your car in a secure car park and retain the parking ticket on your person.\n\nKeep car doors locked while driving. Don’t leave luggage or valuables visible inside a parked car and don’t leave luggage on a roof rack. When picking up and dropping off your rental car, do not leave the keys in the ignition while loading or unloading luggage.\n\nWhen using ATMs, protect your PIN at all times and look closely at ATMs for evidence of tampering before use. Criminals may use small electronic devices attached to the outside of ATMs called “skimmers” to steal the ATM or credit card data.\n\nIn busy areas, thieves use distraction techniques at ATMs, such as waiting until the PIN has been entered and then pointing to money on the ground or asking for loose change. While the ATM user is distracted, another person will quickly withdraw cash and leave. If you are distracted in any way, cancel the transaction immediately.\n\nWhen using credit cards to pay at restaurants, a portable card reader should be brought to your table. Restaurant staff should not take your card elsewhere to process a charge.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and FBI pages for information on scams.\n\nVictims of Crime:\n\nReport crimes to the local police at 999 or 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(353) (1) 668-8777.\n\nU.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\n\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nHelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nAssist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys.\n\nProvide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States\n\nProvide information on victims compensation programs in Ireland:\n\nThe Irish Tourist Assistance Service (ITAS) is a free nationwide service offering support and assistance to tourists who are victimized while visiting Ireland. If you are a tourist victim of crime, report the incident to the nearest Garda (Irish police) station, and they will help you contact ITAS.\n\nProvide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nReplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our webpage on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nCurrency in Ireland: The currency used in Ireland is the Euro. U.S. dollars are not legal tender in Ireland and are not an accepted form of payment. There are limited locations to exchange U.S. dollars when in Ireland, should you travel with cash. Payment by credit card and Apple pay is widely accepted throughout Ireland. However, it is important to note that not all U.S credit cards are universally accepted. Most Irish banks will not accept U.S. $100 bills. Many Irish financial institutions no longer accept or cash traveler’s checks. ATMs are widely available, but some, particularly in rural areas, may not accept debit cards from U.S. banks.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTQIA+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQIA+ events in Ireland.\n\nSee our LGBTQIA+ Travel Information page and section 6 of the Department of State’s Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers with Disabilities: The law in Ireland prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. However, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation different from what is offered in the United States.\n\nGovernment Buildings: Irish law requires access to government buildings for persons with disabilities, and this requirement is enforced. Under Irish law, public service providers should ensure the service is accessible to those with mobility, sensory, and/or cognitive impairments.\n\nParking: On-street parking, public building parking lots, and internal parking lots always have a certain number of disabled spaces available. A permit is required to use these spaces, and information on applying for the permit can be found on the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland website. Local authorities and commercial premises, such as shopping outlets, have no legal obligation to provide external disabled parking facilities for their customers.\n\nBuses and Trains: The majority of buses and trains in the main city areas of Ireland are now equipped for those with limited mobility, sight, or hearing disabilities, although some train stations and pathways may not be as easily accessible.\n\nMainline and Suburban Trains: Portable ramps permit boarding from platforms to the carriages. These ramps are available at all terminal points and major junctions and stations that have staff on duty. They are also available on some trains. Travelers are advised to contact Irish Rail in advance to ensure such facilities are available. The website for Dublin Bus provides information on its travel assistance scheme. Regional and intercity bus services are provided by Bus Eireann\n\nPrivate Businesses: Accessibility in private businesses – such as hotels, bed and breakfasts, shops, and restaurants – varies widely. Travelers should inquire about accessibility issues with businesses before making reservations.\n\nDisability Allowance: People who live in Ireland and meet the medical conditions for a disability allowance may apply for free travel passes; there is also a blind/invalidity pension from the Irish Department of Social Protection for those who qualify.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nAs of March 6, 2022, the Government of Ireland removed all COVID-19 related travel restrictions to enter Ireland. Non-Irish citizens no longer need to complete a passenger locator form or provide proof of vaccination, or a COVID-19 test.\n\nPatients who do not receive benefits from Ireland’s Department of Social Protection are expected to pay all costs up-front at the time of treatment and apply for reimbursement from their insurance provider later.\n\nModern medical facilities and highly skilled medical practitioners are available in Ireland.\n\nExpect long waits for access to medical specialists and admissions to hospitals for non-life-threatening medical conditions. It is not unusual for emergency room services to be very busy or for post-treatment admissions to include a long wait (sometimes overnight) on a gurney in a hallway.\n\nWe advise you carry your medical history, along with a detailed list of any medication you currently take (including dosage and brand name) in your wallet or purse and luggage.\n\nMost types of over-the-counter medications are available, but many U.S. brands are not. Some medications available over the counter in the United States may require a prescription in Ireland.\n\nIrish pharmacists may not be able to dispense medication prescribed by U.S. physicians and may direct you to obtain a prescription from an Irish doctor.\n\nA list of Irish general practitioners in each area of Ireland may be obtained from the website of the Irish College of General Practitioners.\n\nAmbulance services are widely available.\n\nFor emergency services in Ireland dial 112 or 999.\n\nThe Department of State does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\n\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\n\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Government of Ireland to ensure the medication is legal in Ireland.\n\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPharmaceuticals:\n\nVisitors to Ireland may bring up to 3 months’ supply of prescription medicines with them for their own personal use. We recommend that travelers bring the prescription medicines in their original packaging, with their name clearly displayed. This should be accompanied by their prescription or a copy of it, and/or a letter from their doctor and/or dispensing pharmacist outlining their condition and stating that the medicines are for their own personal use. This information should be inside the package in which the medication is being transported, as a means of proving the legitimacy of consignment for importation to Ireland. It should be noted that the Irish Customs Authority has the final say in all such matters.\n\nSchengen residents are required to have an Article 75 Schengen Certificate for prescribed narcotics and/or psychotropic substances on entry into Ireland if travelling from a Schengen area country.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information.\n\nFurther health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nWater Quality\n\nTap water quality is potable and contains fluoride\n\nAir Quality\n\nAir quality is good. Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates\n\nGeneral Health\n\nColds and other upper respiratory infections are common, but no more so than in comparable climates of the U.S. However, due to the damp climate, common cold symptoms may last longer than expected and mold can be an issue in buildings.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic."
