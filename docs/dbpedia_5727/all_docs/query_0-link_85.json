When school is not in session, pickup on Friday at 6 p.m. and drop-off Sunday at 6 p.m.\n\nSummer Vacation\n\nThe noncustodial parent has 42 days of extended parenting time during the summer vacation.\n\nDefault:\n\nPickup at 6 p.m. on June 15 and drop-off at 6 p.m. on July 27.\n\nElection:\n\nThe noncustodial parent can pick when this 42-day extended summer parenting time period will occur but must send written notice to the custodial parent by April 1st. The time period may begin no earlier than the day after the child’s school is dismissed for the summer vacation and ending no later than seven days before school resumes at the end of the summer vacation. The extended summer parenting time must be exercised in no more than two separate periods of at least seven consecutive days each, as specified in the written notice. The extended summer parenting time must not interfere with Father’s Day parenting time. These periods of parenting time shall begin and end at 6 p.m. on each applicable day.\n\nUnder either of the above options, the custodial parent may pick one weekend for parenting time during this extended summer vacation parenting time period but must send written notice to the noncustodial parent by April 15th with the specific dates. If the summer vacation period of possession by the noncustodial parent is more than 30 days, then the custodial parent may have possession of the child on any 2 nonconsecutive weekends during that period. Pickup at 6 p.m. on Friday and drop-off at 6 p.m. on Sunday. The custodial parent is responsible for picking the child up from the noncustodial parent and returning the child for these selected parenting time period(s). The weekend or weekends cannot interfere with Father’s Day parenting time."
