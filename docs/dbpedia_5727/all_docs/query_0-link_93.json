        "text": "Who Is Eligible\n\nTo be eligible for the Student Program (SP) with the Navy JAG Corps, you must:\n\nbe a United States citizen of good moral character;\n\nbe younger than 42 years of age at the time you begin active duty;\n\nhave taken the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) or GRE;\n\nbe a law student with at least one year of school completed, attending an American Bar Association (ABA)-accredited school, or a graduate of an ABA-accredited law school who has not yet had the opportunity to take the first available bar exam following graduation. Students who attend law school part-time or intend to matriculate in a dual degree program must be within two years of completing all remaining degree requirements, and\n\nmeet the physical and medical requirements for commission in the Navy. If you have any questions about the medical qualifications or physical fitness standards, please contact a Navy recruiter.\n\nThe physical requirements include meeting Navy and DoD fitness standards.\n\nAdditionally, Navy officers are required to participate in at least one Physical Readiness Test each year. The test consists of completing as many pushups as possible in two minutes, a cardio test (typically a 1.5 mile run, but other options include a 500y/450m swim, 12-minute stationary bike, or 2,000 meter row), and a timed plank. Additional information is available at Physical Fitness Test.\n\nNOTE: If you are an active duty naval officer currently attending law school and interested in applying via the Student Program, please contact the Accessions Program Manager at navyjagaccessions@us.navy.mil.\n\nInterested in speaking to a recruiter? Visit www.navy.com.\n\nIf you have any issues with the application site, please contact NavyJAGAccessions@us.navy.mil.\n\nHow It Works\n\nBecoming a judge advocate is a two-phase process. The first phase is to apply for a Professional Recommendation to become a judge advocate. If you are Professionally Recommended you then apply for a commission as an officer in the U.S. Navy. Once accepted into the program, SP participants continue law school until graduation and take the first bar examination after law school. After passing the bar examination, SP participants start active duty and begin their Navy training.\n\nNew judge advocates first attend the five-week Navy Officer Development School (ODS) in Newport, RI. After ODS, new judge advocates then report to their permanent duty stations for approximately two months. They will then proceed to the ten-week Basic Lawyer Course at Naval Justice School (NJS), also in Newport, RI. Upon graduation from NJS, new judge advocates return to their permanent duty station and are committed to four years of active duty. For more information, visit the Path of a Navy JAG Corps Officer.\n\nApplication Deadlines\n\nThe deadline for submission of all application materials AND the completion of your structured interview will be September 30, 2024. Structured Interviews should be requested by September 23, 2024 to guarantee a scheduled time, but you may request an interview after that date without such guarantee.\n\nMake sure to read the application guide and checklist before submitting your application.\n\nIf you have questions, please visit FAQ/Contact.\n\nApplication Process\n\nStudent Program applicants can apply to both the Fall and Spring accession boards, as both a 2L and a 3L—there is no limit on how often you can apply. Application materials are not kept after selection decisions are final, so if you want to be reconsidered, you must reapply. Submitting an application doesn't mean you joined the Navy. Applicants are under no obligation whatsoever until they are offered and accept a commission with the Navy at the end of both phases.\n\nPhase One: Apply for a Professional Recommendation\n\nPrior to the application deadline, you must complete four steps:\n\nApply Online Complete the application by the deadline provided above. If there is a discrepancy between the information on this page and the Application website, please follow the instructions and guidance on this page and within the application guide. All applicants should download and read the application guide linked above in its entirety.\n\nSchedule an Interview Schedule and complete a structured interview by the deadlines listed above. You may schedule and complete your interview before you have submitted your application. Information for scheduling a Navy JAG Corps interview is located in the application guide above, linked here. Your interview must be completed before the application deadline. Applicants are responsible for contacting the appropriate office to schedule their interview. Your application will not be considered without a completed interview. Applicants are only permitted to interview once during law school.\n\nUpload Relevant Documents\n\nEnsure your letters of recommendation and all additional documents have been submitted by the deadline. Letters of recommendation and all other documents MUST BE SUBMITTED WITHIN THE ONLINE APPLICATION and will not be accepted if received by email or mail.\n\nSelection Board Process\n\nOnce applications are received, the accessions office completes a full review of all applications for completeness and ensures each applicant is eligible. The completed packages of all eligible applicants are then reviewed by a board of senior active duty judge advocates. The board typically takes place 4 weeks after the application deadline. The final selection of professionally recommended students must be reviewed and approved by the Judge Advocate General. Applicants who are professionally recommended will be notified individually, usually within 6-8 weeks after the application deadline. All applicants can check their status on the application website.\n\nNote: If you are not selected, you may reapply by each deadline as long as you remain eligible. You must submit a new application. The structured interview does not expire, however you are not allowed to have a new structured interview within a three year period. After three years have passed, you may (but are not required to) request a new structured interview.\n\nCommissioning\n\nPhase Two: U.S. Navy Commissioning Screening\n\nIf your application is selected, you will be considered Professionally Recommended for a commission and begin Phase Two. In Phase Two, the final screening and commissioning of applicants is conducted by Navy Recruiting Command. During this phase the following will occur:\n\nA Navy recruiter will work with you to complete the commissioning requirements, including a medical examination and security investigation. Upon successful completion of these requirements, you will be offered a commission.\n\nIf you accept your commission, you will then take the oath of office for a commission and sign a Service Agreement. Student Program officers will serve as ensigns (O-1) (in a non-paid status) during law school and will promote to lieutenant junior grade (O-2) after passing the bar exam and upon starting active duty. Officers with at least one year of prior commissioned service will promote to lieutenant (O-3) when starting active duty. Student Program officers will begin active duty at the October or January ODS courses that follow receipt of their passing bar exam results.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, please email navyjagaccessions@us.navy.mil.\n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nIncome\n\nThe Navy JAG Corps offers active duty judge advocates a competitive starting salary. The total compensation includes basic pay and certain non-taxable allowances, such as those for housing and subsistence. Housing allowances vary according to the cost of living in the area to which you are assigned. Pay increases come with promotion and longevity.

You can use retention bonuses for anything, they are not restricted to just loan repayments.\n\nEducation Financial Assistance\n\nSchool debt repayment: Military service in the Navy JAG Corps qualifies for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and an income-driven repayment plan. The income-based payment plans are only based on your base pay (not your housing or subsistence allowances), making your loan payments substantially lower than they would be under a civilian employer.\n\nFunded Graduate Education: Navy judge advocates have the opportunity for fully funded graduate education leading to award of a Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree. Navy judge advocates have attended graduate programs at civilian law schools such as Harvard, Georgetown, Columbia, George Washington University, University of Pennsylvania, Berkeley, University of San Diego, Lewis and Clark, University of Virginia, and many others. Areas of study include military law, international law, environmental law, and trial advocacy. Post-graduate opportunities also exist at the Army Judge Advocate General’s School, Naval War College, Defense Intelligence Agency, National Defense University, and the Army War College.\n\nGI Bill & Transferability: Transferability option under the Post-9/11 GI Bill allows service members to transfer all or some unused benefits to their spouse or dependent children\n\nRetirement\n\nThis system, called the Blended Retirement System, or BRS, blends the traditional legacy retirement pension, also known as a defined benefit, with government payments made into your individual Thrift Savings Plan, or TSP, account, also known as a defined contribution.\n\nTime Off\n\n30 days paid vacation each year.\n\n11 paid federal holidays per year.\n\nSick leave for personal medical needs or care of family members and adoption.\n\nLife and Work Balance\n\n18 weeks of paid parental leave for service members who give birth; 12 weeks of parental leave for service members that adopt children or whose spouse has given birth.\n\nSubsidized child care, an exceptional family member program, and youth programs.\n\nDepartment of Defense schools in some geographic locations.\n\nRecreational discounts and services through Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) programs.\n\nFamily support services include Family Advocacy, Parenting, Personal Financial Management, Relocation Assistance, Spouse Employment Assistance, Spouse Tuition Aid, and Transition Assistance Programs.\n\nTravel\n\nForeign duty and travel opportunities through temporary or permanent assignments.\n\nDiscounted travel.\n\nMoving Assistance\n\nThe Department of Defense will contract with a commercial mover for the movement of your household goods to your first permanent duty station. Both you and your family are reimbursed for travel expenses from home directly to your first duty station. Subsequent moves to other duty stations, including your final move returning you to your home of record upon release from active duty, will be at the Government’s expense.\n\nOf note, only the officer is entitled to travel expenses to Newport, RI for Officer Development School (ODS) and Naval Justice School (NJS) training, and household goods are not moved to Newport, RI. This is because of the short amount of time the officer will remain in this location before moving permanently to their first duty station.\n\nAdditional Privileges"
