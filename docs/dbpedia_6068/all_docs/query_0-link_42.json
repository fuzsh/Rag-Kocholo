        "text": "Trump's longtime adviser maneuvers in and out of Danish filmmaker Christoffer Guldbrandsen's grasp in this jaw-dropping portrait of a puppet master tangled in his own strings.The film captures the combination of toxicity, duplicity and candour that makes Stone such an influential and dangerous figure on the US political landscape. It’s a remarkable, at times terrifying, film. And, set against the potential for another Trump presidential campaign in 2024, it is an important one. It reveals that Stone and his set play at presidential politics like it’s their private game. And not the 3D chess they’d like you to believe, but something far less strategically sophisticated — a round of kids’ Monopoly, perhaps, in which the only things for sure are that Roger Stone always plays as the top hat and seems to have an endless supply of get out of jail free cards.\n\nThere is a social contract between citizens and politicians in democracies around the world - we accept that they lie. During the second half of the 20th Century, it became part of the deal between the people, the politicians and the media that connect them. We became almost comfortable with it. But in 2015 something was happening in America that felt very different. I was fascinated by the scale of the lying, and more specifically the manufacturing of entire narratives with the sole purpose of influencing political outcomes. I travelled to the United States and secured the opportunity to interview Roger Stone, and everything changed. Negotiations, fundraisers, strategy sessions, trials, gag orders, lawyers, billionaires, secret meetings, public hearings, we went on a wild ride through the halls of power, voting and the application of political influence in America today. It wasn’t pretty, and it almost took my life at one point. What I learned is that like all Democracies around the world, it is starting to feel like a very substantive transformation of Democracy is inevitable in America, and it’s frightening. The rise of the internet, social media and citizen journalism was initially heralded as good for spreading democracy and the values of free societies. It began to make us believe that the powerful can no longer hide behind controlled narratives. Now it has become the perfect place to overwhelm the truth. The loudest liar wins. Can American Democracy evolve in the face of such rapid change across the media landscape, and so much extreme wealth grabbing for power, or is it headed for an actual collapse into a more arcane form of governance? This is what I am left with after making this film, and it’s not a comfortable set of circumstances to contemplate.\n\n-CHRISTOFFER GULDBRANDSEN\n\n“a captivating out West fever dream that takes place across a surreal frontier. A patchwork tapestry of time and space, it follows the ill-fated duo Frank (Kiowa Gordon) and Bruno (John Way) on an inter-dimensional search for redemption along infinite timelines.”\n\n-Holly Jones, Variety\n\n“May I be the first to crown Quantum Cowboys the new king of the psychedelic western? Visually it beats El Topo to the draw. It makes your brain slide further across the theater floor than Greaser’s Palace. It even out weirds the legendary French western Blueberry, which contains the most realistic depiction of DMT hallucinations in cinema. Marslett reaches past the cinematic beyond with his one-two punch of the rotoscope animation and the time travel structure of his and Gelb’s script. The rotoscope variations result in a sensory impact that is oddly both retro and futuristic at once. There are times the night stars frame Linde, and I could swear I am watching a Ralph Bakshi picture.”\n\n-Michael Talbot-Hayes, Film Threat"
