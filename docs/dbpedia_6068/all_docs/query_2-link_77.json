I thought it would be really exciting to try something a bit different.”\n\nDean won the men’s 200m freestyle title at Tokyo 2020 and, last week, the 24-year-old from Bath, plus James Guy, Matt Richards and Duncan Scott, made history in the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay final.\n\nIn winning gold, they became the first swimming team ever to defend an Olympic relay title with the same quartet.\n\n– Wynne Evans\n\nBorn in Carmarthen, he was also crowned Celebrity MasterChef champion for 2023 and is a presenter on BBC Radio Wales.\n\nThroughout his 25-year career, he has had two number one classical music albums, has been a principal at many major opera houses around the world and has delivered more than 200 performances at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\n– Toyah Willcox\n\nShe has also performed in numerous stage productions and featured in various films including 1978 drama Jubilee, 2015 horror comedy Aaaaaaaah! and 2019 sci-fi Invasion Planet Earth.\n\nIn 2018, Sir Paul McCartney presented Willcox with a Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts Companionship for outstanding achievement in music, drama, performance and media.\n\nEarlier this year, she played at the Glastonbury Festival with her husband, musician Robert Fripp, on the Avalon Stage.\n\n– Dr Punam Krishan\n\nShe also regularly reports on health news as a broadcaster on TV, radio and national newspapers.\n\nThe TV doctor previously co-hosted a podcast titled The Medic Mum and is the author of the children’s non-fiction book How To Be A Doctor And Other Life-Saving Jobs.\n\n– Tasha Ghouri\n\nGhouri, who was born deaf and uses a cochlear implant, met boyfriend Andrew Le Page on the reality dating show and hosts the podcast Superpowers With Tasha.\n\nThe trained dancer hosted a beginners’ tap class with Strictly professional Johannes Radebe at a community hall in Cambridge, watched by the Queen, in February.\n\n– Pete Wicks\n\nHe has since appeared on Channel 4’s Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, where he withdrew early on on medical grounds, E4’s Celebs Go Dating, BBC’s Celebrity MasterChef and ITV’s The Real Full Monty.\n\nWicks also was among the celebrities trying to help one contestant succeed in recent Channel 4 series The Underdog: Josh Must Win, and hosts a podcast called Staying Relevant with I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! winner Sam Thompson."
