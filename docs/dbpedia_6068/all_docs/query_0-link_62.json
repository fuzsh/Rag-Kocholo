        "text": "“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is another Marvel movie that isn’t bad, but isn’t good either. It’s just boring. It was very “meh” for kicking off a new phase of Marvel movies, with the rating on rotten tomatoes currently sitting at 48%. Ever since the release of “Avengers: Endgame” the quality of marvel movies has gone down. Even though phase four had a promising start, it all quickly went down due to bad writing.\n\nThe story is very bland and there are several moments in the movie that don’t make any sense at all. Without saying any spoilers, it feels like none of the actors care anymore. Michael Douglass, the actor who plays Hank Pym, just seems like he’s happy his contract is reportedly going to end. The reason most people are watching this movie is because of the introduction of the next big villain, Kang. But, like Thanos, his design and dialogue make him seem weaker than he’s supposed to be by the characters. The performance from Johnathan Majors did feel menacing, however, and way by far the best performance in the whole film.\n\nThe decline of Marvel Studio’s CGI is just funny at this point. It looked like 90% of this movie was filmed with a green screen and ended up looking like a low-budget movie from 2005. The artwork and design are busy and overwhelming and it gives you a headache whenever you look at it. I couldn’t stop laughing whenever I saw Modok, who looks startlingly like Mr. Electric from “Sharkboy and Lavagirl.”\n\nQuantumania is nothing but junk food media. It’s very disappointing for the expectations Marvel and fans alike set for this film. Before phase four there were 23 movies and shows over three phases. In the past two years, we’ve gotten a whopping 17 films and movies — none of which affected the overarching story of the Marvel universe. Perhaps it’s time for the almighty superhero movie to die, just as the almighty Western did in the 1960s."
