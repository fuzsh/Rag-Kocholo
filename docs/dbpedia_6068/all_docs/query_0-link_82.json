        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nTinashe will put her stamina to the test on the extensive Match My Freak world tour. The musician has scheduled a 32-run through North America beginning later this year in support of her upcoming studio album Quantum Baby, arriving Aug. 16 with the viral summer single “Nasty.”\n\nThe Match My Freak tour will begin on Oct. 14 with an opening show at House of Blues in Anaheim. Tinashe will make stops in San Diego, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Nashville, Raleigh, Brooklyn, Boston, Montreal, Toronto, Seattle, Portland, and more. The North American leg is currently scheduled to conclude on Nov. 25 at Ace of Spades in Sacramento.\n\nPresale for the tour will begin on Wednesday, Aug. 7 at 10 a.m. local time ahead of a general sale beginning Friday, Aug. 9 at 10 a.m. local time.\n\nAdditional dates in Australia, Europe, and Asia will be announced at a later date, with plans for the run to extend through 2025. For North America, Tinashe will be joined on the road by the singer and songwriter Raveena.\n\nTrending\n\nTinashe kicked off the year on the road, touring a pre-“Nasty” setlist of hits and selections from her latest releases BB/ANG3L. “For an artist like me, who isn’t on a major label, I’m funding everything, pretty much. After I tour, I usually lose a couple hundred thousand dollars,” she told NYLON in April. “We have to hire new choreographers, new dancers. We have new screens, new production. That’s aside from the logistics — the bus, lighting directors, production design, people that put it up and take it down every night, people that load it onto trucks, different drivers. It ends up being a lot, but I also don’t have the luxury of being able to spend months in rehearsals. So we plan, we plan, we plan.”"
