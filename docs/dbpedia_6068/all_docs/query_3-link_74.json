        "text": "Semiconductors, as we noted above, are somewhat arbitrarily defined as insulators with band gap energy < 3.0 eV (~290 kJ/mol). This cutoff is chosen because, as we will see, the conductivity of undoped semiconductors drops off exponentially with the band gap energy and at 3.0 eV it is very low. Also, materials with wider band gaps (e.g. SrTiO3, Egap = 3.2 eV) do not absorb light in the visible part of the spectrum\n\nThere are a number of places where we find semiconductors in the periodic table:\n\nEarly transition metal oxides and nitrides, especially those with d0 electron counts such as TiO2, TaON, and WO3\n\nOxides of later 3d elements such as Fe2O3, NiO, and Cu2O\n\nLayered transition metal chalcogenides with d0, d2 and d6 electron counts including TiS2, ZrS2, MoS2, WSe2, and PtS2\n\nd10 copper and sliver halides, e.g., CuI, AgBr, and AgI\n\nZincblende- and wurtzite-structure compounds of the p-block elements, especially those that are isoelectronic with Si or Ge, such as GaAs and CdTe. While these are most common, there are other p-block semiconductors that are not isoelectronic and have different structures, including GaS, PbS, and Se.\n\nThe p-block octet semiconductors are by far the most studied and important for technological applications, and are the ones that we will discuss in detail.\n\nZincblende- and wurtzite-structure semiconductors have 8 valence electrons per 2 atoms. These combinations include 4-4 (Si, Ge, SiC,…), 3-5 (GaAs, AlSb, InP,…), 2-6 (CdSe, HgTe, ZnO,…), and 1-7 (AgCl, CuBr,…) semiconductors. Other variations that add up to an octet configuration are also possible, such as CuIInIIISe2, which has the chalcopyrite structure, shown at the right.\n\nHow does the band gap energy vary with composition? There are two important trends\n\n(1) Going down a group in the periodic table, the gap decreases:\n\nC (diamond) > Si > Ge > α-Sn\n\nEgap (eV): 5.4 1.1 0.7 0.0\n\nThis trend can be understood by recalling that Egap is related to the energy splitting between bonding and antibonding orbitals. This difference decreases (and bonds become weaker) as the principal quantum number increases.\n\n(2) For isoelectronic compounds, increasing ionicity results in a larger band gap.\n\nGe < GaAs < ZnSe\n\n0.7 1.4 2.8 eV\n\nSn < InSb < CdTe < AgI\n\n0.0 0.2 1.6 2.8 eV\n\nThis trend can also be understood from a simple MO picture, as we discussed in Ch. 2. As the electronegativity difference Δχ increases, so does the energy difference between bonding and antibonding orbitals.\n\nThe band gap is a very important property of a semiconductor because it determines its color and conductivity. Many of the applications of semiconductors are related to band gaps:\n\nNarrow gap materials (HgxCd1-xTe, VO2, InSb, Bi2Te3) are used as infrared photodetectors and thermoelectrics (which convert heat to electricity).\n\nWider gap materials (Si, GaAs, GaP, GaN, CdTe, CuInxGa1-xSe2) are used in electronics, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells.\n\nSemiconductor solid solutions such as GaAs1-xPx have band gaps that are intermediate between the end member compounds, in this case GaAs and GaP (both zincblende structure). Often, there is a linear relation between composition and band gap, which is referred to as Vegard's Law. This \"law\" is often violated in real materials, but nevertheless offers useful guidance for designing materials with specific band gaps. For example, red and orange light-emitting diodes (LED's) are made from solid solutions with compositions of GaP0.40As0.60 and GaP0.65As0.35, respectively. Increasing the mole fraction of the lighter element (P) results in a larger band gap, and thus a higher energy of emitted photons.\n\nColors of semiconductors\n\nThe color of absorbed and emitted light both depend on the band gap of the semiconductor. Visible light covers the range of approximately 390-700 nm, or 1.8-3.1 eV. The color of emitted light from an LED or semiconductor laser corresponds to the band gap energy and can be read off the color wheel shown at the right.\n\nThe color of absorbed light includes the band gap energy, but also all colors of higher energy (shorter wavelength), because electrons can be excited from the valence band to a range of energies in the conduction band. Thus semiconductors with band gaps in the infrared (e.g., Si, 1.1 eV and GaAs, 1.4 eV) appear black because they absorb all colors of visible light. Wide band gap semiconductors such as TiO2 (3.0 eV) are white because they absorb only in the UV. Fe2O3 has a band gap of 2.2 eV and thus absorbs light with λ < 560 nm. It thus appears reddish-orange (the colors of light reflected from Fe2O3) because it absorbs green, blue, and violet light. Similarly, CdS (Egap = 2.6 eV) is yellow because it absorbs blue and violet light.\n\nElectrons and holes in semiconductors\n\nPure (undoped) semiconductors can conduct electricity when electrons are promoted, either by heat or light, from the valence band to the conduction band. The promotion of an electron (e-) leaves behind a hole (h+) in the valence band. The hole, which is the absence of an electron in a bonding orbital, is also a mobile charge carrier, but with a positive charge. The motion of holes in the lattice can be pictured as analogous to the movement of an empty seat in a crowded theater. An empty seat in the middle of a row can move to the end of the row (to accommodate a person arriving late to the movie) if everyone moves over by one seat. Because the movement of the hole is in the opposite direction of electron movement, it acts as a positive charge carrier in an electric field.\n\nThe opposite process of excitation, which creates an electron-hole pair, is their recombination. When a conduction band electron drops down to recombine with a valence band hole, both are annihilated and energy is released. This release of energy is responsible for the emission of light in LEDs.\n\nAt equilibrium, the creation and annihilation of electron-hole pairs proceed at equal rates. This dynamic equilibrium is analogous to the dissociation-association equilibrium of H+ and OH- ions in water. We can write a mass action expression:\n\n\\(n \\times p = K_{eq} = n_{i}^{2}\\)\n\nwhere n and p represent the number density of electrons and holes, respectively, in units of cm-3. The intrinsic carrier concentration, ni, is equal to the number density of electrons or holes in an undoped semiconductor, where n = p = ni.\n\nNote the similarity to the equation for water autodissociation:\n\n\\([H^{+}][OH^{-}] = K_{w}\\)\n\nBy analogy, we will see that when we increase n (e.g., by doping), p will decrease, and vice-versa, but their product will remain constant at a given temperature.\n\nTemperature dependence of the carrier concentration. Using the equations \\(K_{eq} = e^{(\\frac{- \\Delta G^{o}}{RT})} \\) and \\(\\Delta G^{o} = \\Delta H^{o} - T \\Delta S^{o}\\), we can write:\n\n\\[ n \\times p = n_{i}^{2} = e^{(\\frac{\\Delta S^{o}} {R})} e^{(\\frac{- \\Delta H^{o}}{RT})}\\]\n\nThe entropy change for creating electron hole pairs is given by:\n\n\\[\\Delta S^{o} = R ln (N_{V}) + R ln (N_{V}) = R ln (N_{C}N_{V})\\]\n\nwhere NV and NC are the effective density of states in the valence and conduction bands, respectively.\n\nand thus we obtain\n\n\\[n_{i}^{2} = N_{C}N_{V} e^{({- \\Delta H^{o}}{RT})}\\]\n\nSince the volume change is negligible, \\(\\Delta H^{o} \\approx \\Delta E^{o}\\), and therefore \\(\\frac {\\Delta H^{o}}{R} \\approx \\frac{E_{gap}}{k}\\), from which we obtain\n\n\\[n_{i}^{2} = N_{C}N_{V} e^{(\\frac{-E_{gap}}{kT})}\\]\n\nand finally\n\n\\[\\mathbf{n= p = n_{i} = (N_{C}N_{V})^{\\frac{1}{2}} e^{(\\frac{-E_{gap}}{2kT})}}\\]\n\nFor pure Si (Egap = 1.1 eV) with N ≈ 1022/cm3, we can calculate from this equation a carrier density ni of approximately 1010/cm3 at 300 K. This is about 12 orders of magnitude lower than the valence electron density of Al, the element just to the left of Si in the periodic table. Thus we expect the conductivity of pure semiconductors to be many orders of magnitude lower than those of metals."
