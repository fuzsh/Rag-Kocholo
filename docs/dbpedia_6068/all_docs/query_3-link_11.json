        "text": "Pregis PolyMaskâ„¢: Protective Films for Any Application\n\nIn order to meet the needs of a variety of customers in a variety of industries, Pregis PolyMask protective films can be outfitted with a few different kinds of adhesive:\n\nWater-based: environmentally friendly and water-soluble, these adhesives create film that is quickly and easily removed\n\nSolvent-based: films with this kind of adhesive are resistant to aging and are convenient for the end-user to remove, produced using acrylic acid and an organic solvent\n\nRubber-based: with a high cohesion and little residual glue, rubber-based adhesive is perfect for protective film applications and can use both natural and synthetic rubber\n\nAdhesiveless: with a low tack level and no adhesive transfer on surfaces, adhesiveless films use a proprietary process that embeds the adhesive compound directly into the polyethylene-based coextrusion\n\nNo two surfaces are the same, which is why Pregis PolyMask films come in a variety of adhesives, materials, gauges, lengths, widths, and tack to cater to any customer."
