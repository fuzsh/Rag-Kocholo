We pioneer disruptive technologies and are continuously improving the fuel-efficiency of our products. We are committed to taking environmental responsibility, and are actively reducing emissions throughout our value chain to meet our Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets as validated by the Scientific-Based Targets initiative.\n\nThe legacy of Airbus is one of cutting-edge engineering and innovation that stretches back more than 50 years. For all the greatest European aerospace milestones – from the first flight of the Concorde in 1969 to the launch of the JUICE spacecraft in 2023 – Airbus or its predecessor companies played key roles.\n\nToday, we are innovating the future of flight, designing novel technologies that will make the next generation of aircraft the lightest, safest and most sustainable yet.\n\nThe Airbus brand is more than our logo, colours and advertising. Our brand is built every day by what we say and how we interact with others, deliver on our promises and stay true to our values. It is the reason that customers choose our products and solutions, and why promising talent chooses to pursue their career at Airbus. It is the result of all our work put together, and the reason why we can proudly say “We are Team Airbus”."
