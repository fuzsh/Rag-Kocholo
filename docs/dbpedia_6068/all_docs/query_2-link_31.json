        "text": "The Alabama A&M University Marching Maroon and White will be one of six HBCU bands to perform at the 2025 Honda Battle of the Bands at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. This week, the AAMU Band accepted a challenge invitation from the North Carolina A&T State University marching band to secure its spot in the event to be held Saturday, February 1, 2025.\n\nFor over two decades, the Honda Battle of the Bands has been a premiere stage for the showcasing of top HBCU band programs. Six invitations for the 2025 event are being selected in three phases. Last month, a Honda committee selected two HBCU bands. Each of those bands were then allowed to “challenge” an HBCU band to participate in a face-off in Inglewood.\n\nCommittee selections and challenge selections include: the Alabama A&M University Marching Maroon and White; the North Carolina A&T State University Blue and Gold Marching Machine; the Southern University Human Jukebox; and the Alabama State University band. The final two bands are being selected via fan voting through August 15 at www.hondabattleofthebands.com."
