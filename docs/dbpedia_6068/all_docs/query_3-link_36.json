        "text": "Interstellar is the first Hollywood movie to attempt depicting a black hole as it would actually be seen by somebody nearby. For this, our team at Double Negative Visual Effects, in collaboration with physicist Kip Thorne, developed a code called Double Negative Gravitational Renderer (DNGR) to solve the equations for ray-bundle (light-beam) propagation through the curved spacetime of a spinning (Kerr) black hole, and to render IMAX-quality, rapidly changing images. Our ray-bundle techniques were crucial for achieving IMAX-quality smoothness without flickering; and they differ from physicists' image-generation techniques (which generally rely on individual light rays rather than ray bundles), and also differ from techniques previously used in the film industry's CGI community. This paper has four purposes: (i) to describe DNGR for physicists and CGI practitioners, who may find interesting and useful some of our unconventional techniques. (ii) To present the equations we use, when the camera is in arbitrary motion at an arbitrary location near a Kerr black hole, for mapping light sources to camera images via elliptical ray bundles. (iii) To describe new insights, from DNGR, into gravitational lensing when the camera is near the spinning black hole, rather than far away as in almost all prior studies; we focus on the shapes, sizes and influence of caustics and critical curves, the creation and annihilation of stellar images, the pattern of multiple images, and the influence of almost-trapped light rays, and we find similar results to the more familiar case of a camera far from the hole. (iv) To describe how the images of the black hole Gargantua and its accretion disk, in the movie Interstellar, were generated with DNGR—including, especially, the influences of (a) colour changes due to doppler and gravitational frequency shifts, (b) intensity changes due to the frequency shifts, (c) simulated camera lens flare, and (d) decisions that the film makers made about these influences and about the Gargantua's spin, with the goal of producing images understandable for a mass audience. There are no new astrophysical insights in this accretion-disk section of the paper, but disk novices may find it pedagogically interesting, and movie buffs may find its discussions of Interstellar interesting.\n\nThe theory of general relativity predicts the existence of closed time-like curves (CTCs), which theoretically would allow an observer to travel back in time and interact with their past self. This raises the question of whether this could create a grandfather paradox, in which the observer interacts in such a way to prevent their own time travel. Previous research has proposed a framework for deterministic, reversible, dynamics compatible with non-trivial time travel, where observers in distinct regions of spacetime can perform arbitrary local operations with no contradiction arising. However, only scenarios with up to three regions have been fully characterised, revealing only one type of process where the observers can verify to both be in the past and future of each other. Here we extend this characterisation to an arbitrary number of regions and find that there exist several inequivalent processes that can only arise due to non-trivial time travel. This supports the view that complex dynamics is possible in the presence of CTCs, compatible with free choice of local operations and free of inconsistencies.\n\nThe simplest ΛCDM model provides a good fit to a large span of cosmological data but harbors large areas of phenomenology and ignorance. With the improvement of the number and the accuracy of observations, discrepancies among key cosmological parameters of the model have emerged. The most statistically significant tension is the 4σ to 6σ disagreement between predictions of the Hubble constant, H0, made by the early time probes in concert with the 'vanilla' ΛCDM cosmological model, and a number of late time, model-independent determinations of H0 from local measurements of distances and redshifts. The high precision and consistency of the data at both ends present strong challenges to the possible solution space and demands a hypothesis with enough rigor to explain multiple observations—whether these invoke new physics, unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors. A thorough review of the problem including a discussion of recent Hubble constant estimates and a summary of the proposed theoretical solutions is presented here. We include more than 1000 references, indicating that the interest in this area has grown considerably just during the last few years. We classify the many proposals to resolve the tension in these categories: early dark energy, late dark energy, dark energy models with 6 degrees of freedom and their extensions, models with extra relativistic degrees of freedom, models with extra interactions, unified cosmologies, modified gravity, inflationary models, modified recombination history, physics of the critical phenomena, and alternative proposals. Some are formally successful, improving the fit to the data in light of their additional degrees of freedom, restoring agreement within 1–2σ between Planck 2018, using the cosmic microwave background power spectra data, baryon acoustic oscillations, Pantheon SN data, and R20, the latest SH0ES Team Riess, et al (2021 Astrophys. J.908 L6) measurement of the Hubble constant (H0 = 73.2 ± 1.3 km s−1 Mpc−1 at 68% confidence level). However, there are many more unsuccessful models which leave the discrepancy well above the 3σ disagreement level. In many cases, reduced tension comes not simply from a change in the value of H0 but also due to an increase in its uncertainty due to degeneracy with additional physics, complicating the picture and pointing to the need for additional probes. While no specific proposal makes a strong case for being highly likely or far better than all others, solutions involving early or dynamical dark energy, neutrino interactions, interacting cosmologies, primordial magnetic fields, and modified gravity provide the best options until a better alternative comes along.\n\nThe LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration have cataloged eleven confidently detected gravitational-wave events during the first two observing runs of the advanced detector era. All eleven events were consistent with being from well-modeled mergers between compact stellar-mass objects: black holes or neutron stars. The data around the time of each of these events have been made publicly available through the gravitational-wave open science center. The entirety of the gravitational-wave strain data from the first and second observing runs have also now been made publicly available. There is considerable interest among the broad scientific community in understanding the data and methods used in the analyses. In this paper, we provide an overview of the detector noise properties and the data analysis techniques used to detect gravitational-wave signals and infer the source properties. We describe some of the checks that are performed to validate the analyses and results from the observations of gravitational-wave events. We also address concerns that have been raised about various properties of LIGO–Virgo detector noise and the correctness of our analyses as applied to the resulting data.\n\nTheoretical and observational challenges to standard cosmology such as the cosmological constant problem and tensions between cosmological model parameters inferred from different observations motivate the development and search of new physics. A less radical approach to venturing beyond the standard model is the simple mathematical reformulation of our theoretical frameworks underlying it. While leaving physical measurements unaffected, this can offer a reinterpretation and even solutions of these problems. In this spirit, metric transformations are performed here that cast our Universe into different geometries. Of particular interest thereby is the formulation of cosmology in Minkowski space. Rather than an expansion of space, spatial curvature, and small-scale inhomogeneities and anisotropies, this frame exhibits a variation of mass, length and time scales across spacetime. Alternatively, this may be interpreted as an evolution of fundamental constants. As applications of this reframed cosmological picture, the naturalness of the cosmological constant is reinspected and promising candidates of geometric origin are explored for dark matter, dark energy, inflation and baryogenesis. An immediate observation thereby is the apparent absence of the cosmological constant problem in the Minkowski frame. The formalism is also applied to identify new observable signatures of conformal inhomogeneities, which have been proposed as simultaneous solution of the observational tensions in the Hubble constant, the amplitude of matter fluctuations, and the gravitational lensing amplitude of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. These are found to enhance redshifts to distant galaxy clusters and introduce a mass bias with cluster masses inferred from gravitational lensing exceeding those inferred kinematically or dynamically.\n\nThis work re-derives and discusses non-Lorentz invariant variable speed of light (VSL) theories in the context of cosmological problems. Following a thorough introduction to the subject, an explicit solution demonstrating a possible dependence of the speed of light on the cosmological scale factor is presented and analyzed. The parameters of the initial ansatz, , are constrained by requiring the VSL formulation to be a solution to the flatness and horizon problems. The theoretical section is concluded with a derivation of the change of entropy in a VSL Universe. Even though such findings imply that the speed of light can vary only in non-flat spacetime, an adapted approach using the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics is shown to loosen this restriction. Further, in the experimental section, recent evidence for a temporally varying fine structure constant at significance is presented as a potential test for the VSL hypothesis. Overall, this work introduces and evaluates many aspects of non-Lorentz invariant VSL theories whilst encouraging future research and serving as a largely self-sufficient comprehensive overview paper.\n\nHorizon-scale images of black holes (BHs) and their shadows have opened an unprecedented window onto tests of gravity and fundamental physics in the strong-field regime. We consider a wide range of well-motivated deviations from classical general relativity (GR) BH solutions, and constrain them using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sagittarius A (Sgr A ), connecting the size of the bright ring of emission to that of the underlying BH shadow and exploiting high-precision measurements of Sgr A 's mass-to-distance ratio. The scenarios we consider, and whose fundamental parameters we constrain, include various regular BHs, string-inspired space-times, violations of the no-hair theorem driven by additional fields, alternative theories of gravity, novel fundamental physics frameworks, and BH mimickers including well-motivated wormhole and naked singularity space-times. We demonstrate that the EHT image of Sgr A places particularly stringent constraints on models predicting a shadow size larger than that of a Schwarzschild BH of a given mass, with the resulting limits in some cases surpassing cosmological ones. Our results are among the first tests of fundamental physics from the shadow of Sgr A and, while the latter appears to be in excellent agreement with the predictions of GR, we have shown that a number of well-motivated alternative scenarios, including BH mimickers, are far from being ruled out at present.\n\nGravitational waves modulate the apparent frequencies of other periodic signals. Low-frequency gravitational waves could therefore be detected by observing frequency modulations in signals from higher-frequency sources, e.g. those from binary white dwarfs detected with the LISA gravitational-wave detector. We propose a concrete method to extract these modulations by coherently adding the cross-spectra of a large number of well-resolved quasi-monochromatic signals. We apply this method to the case of LISA, and find this method would enable the detection of background gravitational wave strain amplitudes of, e.g. at a frequency , given current projections for the number and properties of Galactic binary white dwarfs and the sensitivity of the instrument. We also estimate (to within an order of magnitude) that this method could potentially compete with that of current pulsar timing arrays when using signals from binary neutron stars such as those expected to be observed with proposed detectors like DECIGO. Our results show that gravitational-wave detectors could be sensitive at frequencies outside of their designed bandwidth using the same infrastructure, which has the potential to open up unexplored and otherwise inaccessible parts of the gravitational wave spectrum.\n\nThe Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second-generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, USA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry–Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid and high frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.\n\nIn this paper, we provide a comprehensive study of asymptotically flat spacetime in even dimensions . We analyze the most general boundary condition and asymptotic symmetry compatible with Penrose's definition of asymptotic null infinity through conformal compactification. Following Penrose's prescription and using a minimal version of the Bondi–Sachs gauge, we show that is naturally equipped with a Carrollian stress tensor whose radial derivative defines the asymptotic Weyl tensor. This analysis describes asymptotic infinity as a stretched horizon in the conformally compactified spacetime. We establish that charge aspects conservation can be written as Carrollian Bianchi identities for the asymptotic Weyl tensor. We then provide a covariant renormalization for the asymptotic symplectic potential, which results in a finite symplectic flux and asymptotic charges. The renormalization scheme works even in the presence of logarithmic anomalies.\n\nIn this work, we examine the optical behaviors and thermodynamic phase structures using shadow analysis for four black holes. The study is conducted for four cases of charge configurations on the parameter space . As a matter of fact, both the electric charge as a parameter and the parameter space affect the geometry of the black hole shadow, particularly the size of the shadow. We also introduce a constraint on the charge of the black hole from the observational results of the M87 and Sgr A shadow. Furthermore, we show that the electric charge and the parameter space have a non-trivial impact on the variation of the energy emission rate. Interestingly enough, we find novel scenarios in which the evaporation is slower, which causes the lifetime of the black holes to be considerably elongated. On the other side, the phase structure of four black holes is explored for two cases of electric charge configuration. The findings show a perfect correlation between the shadow and event horizon radii. This correlation is, in fact, helpful in discovering the phase transition in terms of the shadow radius. In addition, the microstructure is being analyzed in terms of shadow analysis, providing similar behavior to the ordinary situation of the Ruppeiner formalism.\n\nThe next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers is expected to generate a bounty of new astrophysical discoveries, with sensitivities and bandwidths greatly improved compared to current-generation detectors. These detectors will allow us to make exceptional advancements in our understanding of fundamental physics, the dynamics of dense matter, and the cosmic history of compact objects. The fundamental design aspects of these planned interferometers will enable these new discoveries; however, challenges in technical noise, data quality, and calibration have the potential to limit the scientific reach of these instruments. In this work, we evaluate the requirements of these elements for next-generation gravitational-wave science, focusing on how these areas may impact the proposed Cosmic Explorer observatory. We highlight multiple aspects of these fields where additional research and development is required to ensure Cosmic Explorer reaches its full potential.\n\nThis work re-derives and discusses non-Lorentz invariant variable speed of light (VSL) theories in the context of cosmological problems.

Overall, this work introduces and evaluates many aspects of non-Lorentz invariant VSL theories whilst encouraging future research and serving as a largely self-sufficient comprehensive overview paper.\n\nIn this paper, we determine the relativistic and nonrelativistic energy levels for Dirac fermions in a spinning conical Gödel-type spacetime in -dimensions, where we work with the curved Dirac equation in polar coordinates and we use the tetrads formalism. Solving a second-order differential equation for the two components of the Dirac spinor, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation, and the relativistic energy levels of the fermion and antifermion, where such levels are quantized in terms of the radial and total magnetic quantum numbers n and mj, and explicitly depends on the spin parameter s (describes the 'spin'), spinorial parameter u (describes the two components of the spinor), curvature and rotation parameters α and β (describes the conical curvature and the angular momentum of the spinning cosmic string), and on the vorticity parameter Ω (describes the Gödel-type spacetime). In particular, the quantization is a direct result of the existence of Ω (i.e. such quantity acts as a kind of 'external field or potential'). We see that for , the energy levels do not depend on s and u; however, depend on n, mj, α, and β. In this case, α breaks the degeneracy of the energy levels and such levels can increase infinitely in the limit . Already for , we see that the energy levels depends on s, u and n; however, it no longer depends on mj, α and β. In this case, it is as if the fermion/antifermion 'lives only in a flat Gödel-type spacetime'. Besides, we also study the low-energy or nonrelativistic limit of the system. In both cases (relativistic and nonrelativistic), we graphically analyze the behavior of energy levels as a function of Ω, α, and β for three different values of n (ground state and the first two excited states).\n\nThis work re-derives and discusses non-Lorentz invariant variable speed of light (VSL) theories in the context of cosmological problems.

The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.\n\nIt is possible that primordial black holes (PBHs) constitute (or constituted) a significant fraction of the energy budget of our Universe. Terrestrial gravitational wave detectors offer the opportunity to test the existence of PBHs in two different mass ranges, from to . The first mass window is open via induced gravitational waves, and the second one is by gravitational waves from binary mergers. In this review, we outline and explain the different gravitational wave signatures of PBHs that may be probed by terrestrial gravitational wave detectors, such as the current LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and future ones like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We mainly focus on the associated Gravitational Wave background signals and provide rough estimates for their typical frequency and amplitude. We also discuss complementary probes for these PBH mass ranges.\n\nThe purpose of this review it to present a renewed perspective of the problem of self-gravitating elastic bodies under spherical symmetry. It is also a companion to the papers (2022 Phys. Rev. D 105 044025, 2022 Phys. Rev. D 106 L041502) and (arXiv:2306.16584 [gr-qc]), where we introduced a new definition of spherically symmetric elastic bodies in general relativity, and applied it to investigate the existence and physical viability, including radial stability, of static self-gravitating elastic balls. We focus on elastic materials that generalize fluids with polytropic, linear, and affine equations of state, and discuss the symmetries of the energy density function, including homogeneity and the resulting scale invariance of the TOV equations. By introducing invariant characterizations of physically admissible initial data, we numerically construct mass-radius-compactness diagrams, and conjecture about the maximum compactness of stable physically admissible elastic balls.\n\nA major challenge at the interface of quantum gravity and cosmology is to explain the emergence of the large-scale structure of the Universe from Planck scale physics. In this letter, we extract the dynamics of scalar isotropic cosmological perturbations from full quantum gravity, as described by the causally complete Barrett-Crane group field theory model. From the perspective of the underlying quantum gravity theory, cosmological perturbations are represented as nearest-neighbor two-body entanglement of group field theory quanta. Their effective dynamics is obtained via mean-field methods and described relationally with respect to a causally coupled physical Lorentz frame. We quantitatively study these effective dynamical equations and show that at low energies they are perfectly consistent with those of General Relativity, while for trans-Planckian scales quantum effects become important. These results therefore not only provide crucial insights into the potentially purely quantum gravitational nature of cosmological perturbations, but also offer rich phenomenological implications for the physics of the early Universe.\n\nThe no-boundary proposal by physicists Hartle and Hawking strives to build a model of the early Universe without the initial singularity. This approach introduces the concept of metric signature change, which has been addressed in various ways across the literature. Subsequently, Mansouri and Nozari tackled signature change by employing Colombeau formalism. However, in this context, the metric signature only changes for $t<0$ within the Euclidean regime, posing a challenge in providing coherent physical interpretations beforehand. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reinterpretation of the Mansouri-Nozari approach, ensuring that the sign change occurs for $t>0$ in the Euclidean regime. Our findings prove that the energy-momentum tensor does not vanish on the signature change surface, even when adopting conditions commonly used in the literature. Besides, we formulate a modified cosmology within the realm of signature change. We establish a constraint relating the state equation parameter and its singular part. Lastly, we determine an effective state equation parameter as a function of the redshift and its singular part.\n\nWe address the issue of inequivalent Fock representations in Quantum Field Theory in a curved homogenous and anisotropic cosmological background, namely Kantowski-Sachs spacetime, which can also be used to describe the interior of a nonrotating black hole. A family of unitarily equivalent Fock representations that are invariant under the spatial isometries and implement a unitary dynamics can be achieved by means of a field redefinition that consists of a specific anisotropic scaling of the field configuration and a linear transformation of its momentum. Remarkably, we show that this kind of field redefinition is in fact unique under our symmetry and unitary requirements. However, the physical properties of the Hamiltonian dynamics that one obtains in this way are not satisfactory, inasmuch as the action of the Hamiltonian on the corresponding particle states is ill defined. To construct a quantum theory without this problem, we need a further canonical transformation that is time- and mode-dependent and is not interpretable as an anisotropic scaling. The old and new Fock representations, nevertheless, are unitarily equivalent. The freedom that is introduced when allowing for this further canonical transformation can be fixed by demanding an asymptotic diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and a minimal absorption of dynamical phases. In this way, the choice of vacuum and the associated Fock representation are asymptotically determined.\n\nThe holographic principle suggests that regions of space contain fewer physical degrees of freedom than would be implied by conventional quantum field theory. Meanwhile, in Hilbert spaces of large dimension $2^n$, it is possible to define $N \\gg n$ Pauli algebras that are nearly anti-commuting (but not quite) and which can be thought of as ``overlapping degrees of freedom\". We propose to model the phenomenology of holographic theories by allowing field-theory modes to be overlapping, and derive potential observational consequences. In particular, we build a Fermionic quantum field whose effective degrees of freedom approximately obey area scaling and satisfy a cosmic Bekenstein bound, and compare predictions of that model to cosmic neutrino observations. Our implementation of holography implies a finite lifetime of plane waves, which depends on the overall UV cutoff of the theory. To allow for neutrino flux from blazar TXS 0506+056 to be observable, our model needs to have a cutoff $k_{\\mathrm{UV}} \\lesssim 500\\, k_{\\mathrm{LHC}}\\,$. This is broadly consistent with current bounds on the energy spectrum of cosmic neutrinos from IceCube, but high energy neutrinos are a potential challenge for our model of holography. We motivate our construction via quantum mereology, \\ie using the idea that EFT degrees of freedom should emerge from an abstract theory of quantum gravity by finding quasi-classical Hilbert space decompositions. We also discuss how to extend the framework to Bosons. Finally, using results from random matrix theory we derive an analytical understanding of the energy spectrum of our theory.\\ \\ The numerical tools used in this work are publicly available within the \\verb|GPUniverse| package, \\url{https://github.com/OliverFHD/GPUniverse}~.\n\nA major challenge at the interface of quantum gravity and cosmology is to explain the emergence of the large-scale structure of the Universe from Planck scale physics. In this letter, we extract the dynamics of scalar isotropic cosmological perturbations from full quantum gravity, as described by the causally complete Barrett-Crane group field theory model. From the perspective of the underlying quantum gravity theory, cosmological perturbations are represented as nearest-neighbor two-body entanglement of group field theory quanta. Their effective dynamics is obtained via mean-field methods and described relationally with respect to a causally coupled physical Lorentz frame. We quantitatively study these effective dynamical equations and show that at low energies they are perfectly consistent with those of General Relativity, while for trans-Planckian scales quantum effects become important. These results therefore not only provide crucial insights into the potentially purely quantum gravitational nature of cosmological perturbations, but also offer rich phenomenological implications for the physics of the early Universe.\n\nThe next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers is expected to generate a bounty of new astrophysical discoveries, with sensitivities and bandwidths greatly improved compared to current-generation detectors. These detectors will allow us to make exceptional advancements in our understanding of fundamental physics, the dynamics of dense matter, and the cosmic history of compact objects. The fundamental design aspects of these planned interferometers will enable these new discoveries; however, challenges in technical noise, data quality, and calibration have the potential to limit the scientific reach of these instruments. In this work, we evaluate the requirements of these elements for next-generation gravitational-wave science, focusing on how these areas may impact the proposed Cosmic Explorer observatory. We highlight multiple aspects of these fields where additional research and development is required to ensure Cosmic Explorer reaches its full potential.\n\nThis work re-derives and discusses non-Lorentz invariant variable speed of light (VSL) theories in the context of cosmological problems. Following a thorough introduction to the subject, an explicit solution demonstrating a possible dependence of the speed of light on the cosmological scale factor is presented and analyzed. The parameters of the initial ansatz, , are constrained by requiring the VSL formulation to be a solution to the flatness and horizon problems. The theoretical section is concluded with a derivation of the change of entropy in a VSL Universe. Even though such findings imply that the speed of light can vary only in non-flat spacetime, an adapted approach using the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics is shown to loosen this restriction. Further, in the experimental section, recent evidence for a temporally varying fine structure constant at significance is presented as a potential test for the VSL hypothesis. Overall, this work introduces and evaluates many aspects of non-Lorentz invariant VSL theories whilst encouraging future research and serving as a largely self-sufficient comprehensive overview paper.\n\nThe holographic principle suggests that regions of space contain fewer physical degrees of freedom than would be implied by conventional quantum field theory.

Within 4D discrete gravity, particularly based on triangulations, the area-length system establishes a relationship between area variables associated with triangles and the edge length variables. This system is comprised of polynomial equations derived from Heron's formula, which relates the area of a triangle to its edge lengths.&#xD;Using tools from numerical algebraic geometry, we study the area-length systems. In particular, we show that given the ten triangular areas of a single 4-simplex, there could be up to 64 compatible sets of edge lengths. Moreover, we show that these 64 solutions do not, in general, admit formulae in terms of the areas by analyzing the Galois group, or monodromy group, of the problem. We show that by introducing additional symmetry constraints, it is possible to obtain such formulae for the edge lengths. We take the ﬁrst steps toward applying our results within discrete quantum gravity, speciﬁcally for eﬀective spin foam models.&#xD;\n\nThermal annealing plays a key role in optimizing the properties of amorphous optical coatings. In the field of gravitational wave detection (GWD), however, the effects of annealing protocols on the interferometry mirror coatings have been explored primarily by ex post analysis. As a result, the dynamics of the coatings properties during annealing is still poorly known, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. Here, using real-time, in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) we have tracked the refractive index and thickness of a titania-tantala coating during controlled annealing. We have tested the material and the annealing protocol used in current GWD mirrors. The annealing cycle consisted of a heating ramp from room temperature to 500 ∘C, followed by a 10-h plateau at the same temperature and the final cooling ramp. SE measurements have been run continuously during the entire cycle. Significant variations in the thickness and refractive index, which accompany the coating structural relaxation, have been recorded during the heating ramp. These variations start around 200 ∘C, slightly above the deposition temperature, and show an increased rate in the range 250 ∘C–350 ∘C. A smaller, continuous evolution has been observed during the 10-h high-temperature plateau. The results offer suggestions to modify the current annealing protocol for titania-tantala coatings, for example by increasing the time duration of the high-temperature plateau. They also suggest an increase in the substrate temperature at deposition. The approach presented here paves the way for systematic, real-time investigations to clarify how the annealing parameters shape the properties of optical coatings, and can be leveraged to define and optimize the annealing protocol of new candidate materials for GWD mirrors.\n\nIn this study we prove that the Pauli interaction—which is associated with a length parameter—emerges when the minimal coupling recipe is applied to the non-degenerate version of the Dirac Lagrangian. The conventional Dirac Lagrangian is rendered non-degenerate if supplemented by a particular term quadratic in the derivatives of the spinors. For dimensional reasons, this non-degenerate Dirac Lagrangian is associated with a length parameter . It yields the standard free Dirac equation in Minkowski space. However, if the Dirac spinor is minimally coupled to gauge fields, then the length parameter becomes a physical coupling constant yielding novel interactions. For the U(1) symmetry the Pauli coupling of fermions to electromagnetic fields arises, modifying the fermion's magnetic moment. We discuss the impact of these findings on electrodynamics, and estimate the upper bound of the length parameter from the yet existing discrepancy between the (SM) theory and measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of light leptons. This, and also recent studies of the renormalization theory, suggest that the Pauli coupling of leptons to the electromagnetic field is a necessary ingredient in quantum electrodynamics (QED), supporting the notion of a fundamental nature of the non-degenerate Dirac Lagrangian. In a second step we then investigate how analogous 'Pauli-type' couplings of gravity and matter arise if fermions are embedded in curved spacetime. Minimal coupling of the Dirac field to the gauge field of gravity, the spin connection, leads to an anomalous spin-torsion interaction and a curvature-dependent mass correction. The relation of the latter to Mach's Principle is discussed. Moreover, it is found for a totally anti-symmetric torsion that an upper limit for the 'strength' of the torsion exists in order for a solution to remain causal, while causality for a vector torsion requires a lower limit for its amplitude. We calculate the mass correction in the De Sitter geometry of vacuum with the cosmological constant Λ. Possible implications for the existence of effective non-zero rest masses of neutrinos are addressed. Finally, an outlook on the impact of mass correction on the physics of 'Big Bang' cosmology, black holes, and of neutron stars is provided.\n\nThe Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) is of crucial importance to test the foundations of general relativity. When the particles involved in the test exhibit quantum properties, it is unknown whether this principle still holds. A violation of the EEP would have drastic consequences for physics. A more conservative possibility is that the EEP holds in a generalised form for delocalised quantum particles. Here we formulate such a generalised EEP by extending one of its paradigmatic tests with clocks to quantum clocks that are in a quantum superposition of positions and velocities. We show that the validity of such a generalised version of the EEP is equivalent to the possibility of transforming to the perspective of an arbitrary Quantum Reference Frame (QRF), namely a reference frame associated to the quantum state of the clock. We further show that this generalised EEP can be veriﬁed by measuring the proper time of entangled clocks in a quantum superposition of positions in the Earth gravitational ﬁeld. The violation of the generalised EEP corresponds to the impossibility of deﬁning dynamical evolution in the frame of each clock, and results in a modiﬁcation to the probabilities of measurements calculated in the laboratory frame. Hence, it can be veriﬁed experimentally, for instance in an atom interferometer.&#xD;\n\nGravitational waves modulate the apparent frequencies of other periodic signals. Low-frequency gravitational waves could therefore be detected by observing frequency modulations in signals from higher-frequency sources, e.g. those from binary white dwarfs detected with the LISA gravitational-wave detector. We propose a concrete method to extract these modulations by coherently adding the cross-spectra of a large number of well-resolved quasi-monochromatic signals. We apply this method to the case of LISA, and find this method would enable the detection of background gravitational wave strain amplitudes of, e.g. at a frequency , given current projections for the number and properties of Galactic binary white dwarfs and the sensitivity of the instrument. We also estimate (to within an order of magnitude) that this method could potentially compete with that of current pulsar timing arrays when using signals from binary neutron stars such as those expected to be observed with proposed detectors like DECIGO. Our results show that gravitational-wave detectors could be sensitive at frequencies outside of their designed bandwidth using the same infrastructure, which has the potential to open up unexplored and otherwise inaccessible parts of the gravitational wave spectrum."
