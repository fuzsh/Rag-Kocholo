        "text": "Degree Programs, Majors and Minors\n\nUCLA offers a vast array of degree programs and areas of study for undergraduate and graduate students. Your academic pursuits can flex to suit your needs. You can study abroad, pursue a minor in addition to your major or even earn two degrees at once. In some fields, you can pursue a master's degree as an undergraduate.\n\nUse the tool below to learn about the degrees, majors and minors that UCLA offers. Select the degrees that interest you to learn about their specific requirements.\n\nSome degree programs offer specializations that help you hone in on your specific area of interest. For example, you can earn an M.F.A. in film and television with a specialization in screenwriting, an M.M. in music performance with a specialization in jazz, or an M.S. in biology with a specialization in the ecology and evolution of medicine. Visit the departments for the programs that interest you to learn more.\n\nIf you're unsure what you want to pursue, attend New Student Orientation the summer before you start at UCLA. You'll learn about choosing a major, course planning, graduation requirements, graduate programs, professional schools and more.\n\nCookie Policy\n\nWe use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve your experience, including personalizing content and to store your content preferences.
