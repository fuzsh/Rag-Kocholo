Maybe covers or masterings or other.\n\nHere is the google drive link to a zip file that contains almost all my projects I ever worked on\n\nSemaphore Fruity Loops Studio projects\n\nit's a bit of a mess and I deleted most redundant projects. Sometimes there is ann older version I worked on years prior so I let it in the folder.\n\nMainly I used the VST's refX Nexus 2 and East West Quantum leap like Gold orchestra, Colossus, Symphonic choirs...\n\nand for drums Vengeance Soundspackets. I couldn't reacreate some projects because the old versions wont work anymore in FL Studio or because I'm terrible with instrument descriptions =D\n\nAnd I produced almost only in \"Pattern\" not in \"Song\" next to the play button, because I'm a FL Studio noob"
