        "text": "viscosity, resistance of a fluid (liquid or gas) to a change in shape, or movement of neighbouring portions relative to one another. Viscosity denotes opposition to flow. The reciprocal of the viscosity is called the fluidity, a measure of the ease of flow. Molasses, for example, has a greater viscosity than water. Because part of a fluid that is forced to move carries along to some extent adjacent parts, viscosity may be thought of as internal friction between the molecules; such friction opposes the development of velocity differences within a fluid. Viscosity is a major factor in determining the forces that must be overcome when fluids are used in lubrication and transported in pipelines. It controls the liquid flow in such processes as spraying, injection molding, and surface coating.\n\nFor many fluids the tangential, or shearing, stress that causes flow is directly proportional to the rate of shear strain, or rate of deformation, that results. In other words, the shear stress divided by the rate of shear strain is constant for a given fluid at a fixed temperature. This constant is called the dynamic, or absolute, viscosity and often simply the viscosity. Fluids that behave in this way are called Newtonian fluids in honour of Sir Isaac Newton, who first formulated this mathematical description of viscosity.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhysics and Natural Law\n\nThe dimensions of dynamic viscosity are force × time ÷ area. The unit of viscosity, accordingly, is newton-second per square metre, which is usually expressed as pascal-second in SI units.\n\nThe viscosity of liquids decreases rapidly with an increase in temperature, and the viscosity of gases increases with an increase in temperature. Thus, upon heating, liquids flow more easily, whereas gases flow more sluggishly. For example, the viscosities of water at 27 °C (81 °F) and at 77 °C (171 °F) are 0.85 × 10−3 and 0.36 × 10−3 pascal-second, respectively, but those of air at the same temperatures are 1.85 × 10−5 and 2.08 × 10−5 pascal-second."
