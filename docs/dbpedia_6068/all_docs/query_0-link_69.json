        "text": "Midnights-Ocean responds:\n\nHey thanks for the feedback. I've always been a bit of a rebel musically. Tis why I mixed an Indian drum grove with a Latin one. Adding retro synths was just \"normal\" for me. I guess you could say I'm the type who likes pineapple on their pizza lol. I love all the elements in this and I did what I could to make them play well together. I can see why it might be a bit of a weird flavor for some but I was pleased with how happy it came out. <:3"
