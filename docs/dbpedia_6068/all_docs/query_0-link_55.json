        "text": "Every Friday, Nevada Sports Net's Jared Brosnan, a lover of film and television, will review one movie or show and give you his thoughts heading into the weekend.\n\nThis week's asked Chris about his most anticipated movies that will be released in 2023. I helped him out with a top-10 list but wanted to delve further into that question with this week's Film Friday. February typically has a lull in releases as the industry focuses on award show campaigning with the Oscars looming. The first big movie of 2023 will be released this week with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The beginning of MCU's Phase 5 is a big bet on the future of Marvel and how the box office forecast will look this year. Let's look at the top-10 movies I'm most excited to see this year.\n\n10. Air (release date April 5)\n\nAs someone who thinks Ben Affleck is a solid actor with the right story and direction, I'm excited to see him and Matt Damon take on the story of how Nike landed the second-best basketball player of all-time, Michael Jordan. Affleck tends to shine when he's directing his own movies, such as Argo and The Town. He's directing Air. Add Jason Bateman and Viola Davis to the cast and you've got a great roster to work with. Damon and Affleck are well-known sports fans, so this isn't just another movie for them. We know all about Jordan's years on the Bulls after The Last Dance, but it'll be interesting to see the backstory behind Nike landing Jordan in the early 80s and propelled both entities to international fame.\n\n9. Scream VI (release date March 10)\n\nA sneaky good movie of 2022 was the revival of the Scream franchise. Now with a younger cast led by Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, the original remaining cast of Neve Campbell (who will not be in this movie due to contract issues) and Courtney Cox won't be as relied upon. The sequel to the revival looks to be an homage to all the movies and different Ghost-faces to come before. The best part of the Scream franchise is the movies don't take themselves seriously. They're parodies of horror movies while still giving a bit of scare to audiences. Before March Madness takes over weekends, the second week of March will be a good time to see this sixth slasher movie.\n\n8. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (release date February 16)\n\nMaybe I should have seen the early reviewers before ranking this in the top 10. This currently has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 50 percent. After a mediocre Phase 4 of Marvel, the fifth phase starts this weekend with the third Ant-Man movie. As someone who didn't enjoy any of the three major MCU theater releases in 2022, I'm hesitant about what Peyton Reed has in store. The most important part of this movie is the introduction of Kang the Conqueror as the new main Marvel villain. We'll see next week how I felt about this CGI avalanche taking Scott Lang and his family into the quantum realm.\n\n7. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (release date June 30)\n\nWe all remember how bad the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was with those CGI flying monkeys. Here's hoping James Mangold can send Indiana Jones into the sunset with one final great adventure. Harrison Ford returned to play Han Solo and now once more as Dr. Jones Jr. The fourth installment of this franchise and Ford reaching 80 years old is why this is not higher on the list. I'm unsure how much energy he's able to bring to the screen with plenty of action sequences expected to take place. The great parts of the Jones series are the horseback riding, fist-fighting Nazis and cracking that bullwhip. Let's see if he or the movie editors can make it still look like he's got it.\n\n6. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. (release date May 5)\n\nThis is the only title in the MCU other than Loki that all fans will not complain to see more of. Likely James Gunn's final time working with Marvel as he now runs DC over with Warner Bros., we saw the Guardians for a few minutes at the beginning of the atrocious Thor: Love and Thunder with them leaving to go on their own adventure. We will likely see Gamora reunite with Quill after being separated in Infinity War.\n\n5. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (release date June 3)\n\nThis is a big year for animated movies with two huge ones coming out two months from each other. Miles Morales is back, and so are so many other Spider characters. The animation concept is so unique, blending comic-book-style art in a 3D form. I'm in favor of any non-MCU storytelling when it comes to their most important character. The most fun part of these movies is the different Spider-Men. Expect to see the team return and more with Issa Rae and Oscar Isaac joining the different spidey characters.\n\n4. Super Mario Bros. Movie (release date April 7)\n\nFor anyone who had Nintendo systems as a kid, this is one of the biggest moments of our lives. We finally get to see the Mushroom Kingdom on the big screen. Except for Chris Pratt as Mario, this is a perfectly cast movie with Charlie Day as Luigi, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong and Jack Black as Bowser. I'm curious to see if there are more millennials/Gen-Zers in the audience than kids on opening weekend. This movie is Mario Bros., Mario Party and Mario Kart rolled into a super fun-looking adventure. I'm curious to see the box-office numbers for this with April not usually being a big month for theater releases. Good reviews will help boost opening weekends, but if fans love it, they will go see it multiple times.\n\n3. Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nWhen a Martin Scorsese film is set for release, it earns a top spot on the list. It just so happens he is collaborating with his two most famous leads: Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. Seeing the two of them together on screen in a Scorsese movie will be an incredible experience for longtime fans of his work. We know Marty and Robert from the mob-type movies of the 20th century with him joining forces with Leo over the last 20 years on some great biopics such as The Aviator and Wolf of Wall Street. No release date is set, but it will come out eventually this year on Apple TV+.\n\n2. Dune Part 2 (release date November 3)\n\nThis year's runner-up is the sequel to the best movie in 2021. Denis Villeneuve's reboot of the Frank Hebert novel, which has a cult classic David Lynch version released in the 1980s, was a spectacular sci-fi epic made to be seen in theaters. Timoth√©e Chalemet held his own as the leader of a big-budget action movie joined by a great supporting cast in Zendaya, Javier Bardem and Oscar Isaac. Even more star power has been added to the sequel with Austin Butler, Florence Pugh and even Christopher Walken. This must be seen in IMAX with Han Zimmer coming back to create another pulse-pounding score as Paul and the Freman of Arrakis continue their fight against House Harkonnen.\n\n1. Oppenheimer (release date July 21)\n\nIf there's any director that's earned the right to be seen opening weekend specifically in IMAX, it's Christopher Nolan. Tenet may not have been everyone's favorite movie, but Nolan is one of only a handful of directors who can say they've never made a bad movie. His long-time supporting role collaborator, Cillian Murphy, is finally in the lead spot as the director of the Manhattan Project. A stellar cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt. They should all be incredible to watch under Nolan's direction. After his take on Dunkirk in what saved the Allies before America's entrance into World War 2, Nolan now goes into the lives of the scientists who ended it in 1945. Knowing Nolan, the effects going into creating the bomb explosions will not all be on some CGI computer creation. This will be as realistic a nuclear detonation a film production has reproduced. This should be another summer smash from Nolan in his first project since leaving Warner Bros. for Universal."
