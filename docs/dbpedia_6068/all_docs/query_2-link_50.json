Why not try watching all the James Bond 007 movies in order, from its very beginning with “Dr. No” to Roger Moore’s first 007 movie “Live and Let Die” to Daniel Craig’s final outing as the superspy in 2021’s “No Time to Die.”\n\nThose who haven’t seen some of the earlier Bond films are in for a musical treat, with title songs from the likes of Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, Louis Armstrong, Sheena Easton, Duran Duran and of course, Paul McCartney & Wings’ iconic “Live and Let Die.”\n\nThe 007 films are also a prime place for spotting some of the best supporting actors, from villains like Javier Bardem and Rami Malek to romantic interests — and occasionally villains as well — like Halle Berry, Sophie Marceau and Michelle Yeoh.\n\nSo settle in with a bowl of popcorn and maybe a Vesper martini, and let the action begin.\n\nThis list includes all 25 films produced by Eon Productions, as well as the two Bond films that were produced by other production companies, the 1967 “Casino Royale” and “Never Say Never Again.”"
