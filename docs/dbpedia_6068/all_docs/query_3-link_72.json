        "text": "Pasadena, CA\n\nSite: California Institute of Technology\n\nSubject area: Material Science\n\nDescription:\n\nProject 1: The intern research will focus on designing irregular materials inspired by the peel of citrus fruits. The interns will be invited to study slices of the citrus fruit peel to characterize their microscopic structure. After studying and understanding the material structure of the peel, the intern will create computational tools to design synthetic materials that mimic the structural properties of natural fruits. The interns will analyze the network-like cellular architectures of the natural materials and study their response to fracture. After identifying the structural motifs protecting the fruit, the interns will reproduce the same motifs in 3D printable models that will be tested under quasistatic compression and tension. To test the energy absorption of the materials, the students will conduct dynamic testing by using a drop tower. During these tests, they will also use a digital camera to gather images of the fracture process and will use digital image correlation techniques and image processing packages to analyze the deformation of the samples.\n\nProject 2: The intern research will focus on the study of irregular metamaterials consisting of interlocking hierarchical structures formed by periodically linking prime knots (as in an arrangement of linked granular elements, or chainmail). Such structures exhibit different properties based on the direction and magnitude of forces applied because of the dynamic rearrangement of the linked elements (in this case, knots). The interns will test the relation of mechanical properties to the knot geometry and will characterize and quantify the role of disorder in these systems that lead to optimal energy absorption performance.\n\nProject 3: The intern research will aim at modeling and characterizing the role of interfaces on strength, energy dissipation, and damping in disordered interpenetrating two-phase metamaterials. One phase will consist of a continuous shell with programmed degrees of long-range order, with the other phase filling the remaining sample volume. The intern will design and additively manufacture (in polymer and/or metal) samples with different degrees of disorder, tuned via the shell topology, and interfacial strength, tuned by accurately controlling the offset of the two phases during the printing process (in the case of metal printing, the phases can be compositionally identical but can be printed to develop different microstructures). The intern will also characterize the samples via quasi-static compression and dynamic mechanical analysis, to measure strength, energy absorption, and damping. The overarching goal will be to quantify the optimal degree of topological disorder and interfacial strength on the most desirable compromises among these mechanical properties.\n\nRegistration opens: Dec 4, 2023\n\nRegistration closes: Feb 29, 2024\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nSite: University of California\n\nSubject area: Electrical Engineering\n\nDescription: Interns will engage in the design, fabrication, and characterization of the test structures. Throughout the summer, interns will be doing the following research: the fabrication of each generation, the devices will be characterized and necessary modifications (e.g. surface treatment, post-dielectric deposition annealing, etc) will be applied to improve the performance of the next generation of devices.\n\nRegistration opens: Dec 4, 2023\n\nRegistration closes: Feb 29, 2024\n\nSanta Barbara, CA\n\nSite: University of California Santa Barbara\n\nSubject area: Physics\n\nDescription:\n\nProject 1: Flexible optical potentials for quantum simulation. The precision and control that can be obtained in experiments on degenerate quantum gasses have advanced to the point where cold atoms can be used to study many-body quantum phenomena relevant to other systems, most notably condensed matter. This field, often called “quantum simulation,” is especially well-suited to undergraduate involvement both because of the field’s fundamentally interdisciplinary nature and because the diverse experimental techniques lend themselves to modularity. The Weld group’s research in this field and in the area of quantum dynamics is based on three main experimental platforms: two large Bose condensate experiments based around lithium and strontium, and an optical-tweezer experiment using ultracold potassium. The undergraduate intern on this project will work with one or more of these degenerate quantum gas experiments. The interns’ contributions will focus on the generation and control of optical potentials to enable new forms of dynamical quantum simulation. Specific project details will depend on the intern’s interests and background. The optical, electronic, and software infrastructure that the intern will create will enable the generation and optimization of shaped optical potentials for use in experiments exploring the response of quantum systems to nonadiabatic variations of the potential.\n\nProject 2: Nanofabrication of anyon interferometers. Quasiparticles arising from specific even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states are proposed to exhibit non-Abelian statistics and have the potential to be utilized as robust topological qubits, capable of performing protected quantum gate operations through braiding. This project aims to investigate graphene-based quantum Hall mesoscopic devices, including Fabry-P´erot interferometers, single electron transistors, quantum dots, and quantum Hall charge pump devices, with the overarching objective of probing and manipulating non-Abelian anyons within fractional quantum Hall states. However, integrating various nano-scale mesoscopic structures into all-Van-der-Waals heterostructures that probe both bulk and edge of these quantum Hall states without introducing additional disorder presents an experimental challenge, necessitating precise and ultra-clean fabrication techniques. The involvement of the undergraduate researcher focuses on exfoliating the appropriate material and assembling the all-van der Waals stacks with the dry-transfer technique. During the stack assembly, the undergraduate researcher will also perform gate-defining lithography through anodic oxidation, by an atomic force microscope, which allows nano-scale structures to be pre-patterned and integrated into the device in a minimally invasive fashion, reducing the amount of disorder introduced to the system.\n\nProject 3: Rotation-controlled transition metal chalcogenide heterostructures. Twisted homobilayers of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MoTe2 and WSe2 have been proposed to host integer and fractional quantum anomalous hall states of matter. Transport measurements of a well-designed Van derWaals heterostructure containing the aforementioned materials could demonstrate sharp and clear quantum hall physics that potentially includes fractional excitations such as non-Abelian anyons even at zero magnetic fields, opening the door to further probing of these phases using quantum mesoscopic devices. Making contact with and defining a conducting region with ultra-clean edges and low twist angle disorder presents an experimental challenge along with the encapsulation of air-sensitive TMDs in an effective manner. The involvement of the undergraduate intern focuses on exfoliating materials (graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, and the TMD) as well as designing and assembling the Van derWaals heterostructure using the dry-transfer technique. Fine alignment of layers into a usable stacking geometry as well as gate definition using lithography via Atomic Force Microscopy constitute the design process where feedback with a personal mentor as well as independent problem-solving and innovation are key components of the undergraduate’s success.\n\nProject 4: Optimizing photoconductive switches for on-chip THz spectroscopy On-chip spectroscopy in the Terahertz domain is useful for the measurement of quantum phenomena in 2D materials. Terahertz spectroscopy’s specific energy and time scale allow for experiments measuring superconductivity, strongly correlated phenomena and non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum materials. The addition of a specially designed chip allows these same measurements to be performed below the Rayleigh diffraction limit, particularly helpful for studying Van derWaals heterostructures and 2D materials such as graphene in ultra-cold environments. In this project, the difficulty lies in creating high-quality chips for the measurement of samples. The involvement of the undergraduate intern focuses on, but is not limited to the construction of complex optical arrays to generate and measure on-chip terahertz waves, dealing with analog and digital electronics for automated measurements and fabrication of custom parts necessary for measurements. By experimenting with different chip geometries and photo-conductive switches, the undergraduate researcher helps optimize the capabilities of on-chip spectroscopy.\n\nProject 5: Precise monitoring and control of Feshbach fields. Tunable interatomic interactions are a key tool for quantum simulation experiments with ultracold atoms. Magnetically tuned resonances between bound and unbound two-atom states offer the most straightforward way to control interactions, and our group commonly uses such ”Feshbach tuning” to create strong variable interactions or eliminate them. Currently, we are pushing up against the limits of our magnetic field control hardware: noise in the control electronics and power supplies is limiting the precision with which we can achieve the desired interaction strength. In the case of non-interacting samples such noise can even create attractive interactions which destroy the atomic sample in a so-called “Bose-nova.” The undergraduate intern on this project will design, develop, and deploy a system for monitoring and precisely controlling the magnetic fields applied to ultracold lithium atoms in our lab, to reach a hundredfold increase in precision.\n\nRegistration opens: Dec 4, 2023\n\nRegistration closes: Feb 29, 2024\n\nPlaya Vista, CA\n\nSite: U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory – ARL West\n\nDescription:\n\nARL regional sites create strong, enduring S&T partnerships–working together to solve the Army’s current and future challenges.

Our large projects will be broken down into small task segments to provide a full research experience for each of the interns. This is dependent upon the overall research project status when students arrive. Each of these subprojects will be directly related to “real world” research in which the principal investigators and key personnel are engaged but tempered to provide a suitable and full research experience.\n\nRegistration opens: Dec 4, 2023\n\nRegistration closes: Feb 29, 2024\n\nSite: University of Miami School of Medicine\n\nSubject area: Molecular Biology\n\nDescription:\n\nProject 1: Analysis of inducible T-SCs. The intern will be involved in screening the strain collection for the formation of inducible T-SCs by BN-PAGE upon growth in pBpa-containing media and cross-linking. Moreover, once identified TSCs, we will characterize their respiratory properties by high-resolution respirometry. To analyze SC function independently of their assembly and without introducing steric constraints, we aim to generate inducible T-SCs by crosslinking naturally occurring SCs. For this purpose, we will apply the non-canonical amino acids (ncAA)-mediated photo-crosslinking strategy. Briefly, the approach involves the incorporation of a photoreactive ncAA at a defined position of the target protein and UV-mediated protein-protein crosslinking. We have already generated in the lab yeast strains expressing an array of mutant forms of the CIII subunit Cor1, which mediates the interaction between CIII and CIV in SCs. The strains also express an engineered tRNA and aminoacyl tRNA synthetase pair, which will recognize amber codons and mediate the incorporation of the ncAA p-Benzoyl-Lphenylalanine (pBpa). The AEOP-UG Intern student will be involved in screening the strain collection for the formation of inducible T-SCs by BN-PAGE upon growth in pBpa containing media and cross-linking. Moreover, once identified TSCs, we will characterize their respiratory properties by high-resolution respirometry.\n\nProject 2: The undergraduate intern will cross-link.

The urban environment can modify surface exchanges with the atmosphere on a larger scale and thus affect flow fields in the area. Recovering mean profiles of wind speed, standard deviation of the vertical velocity, and turbulence intensity from acoustic propagation measurements is a well-known approach. However, the urban environment’s complex reverberation, multipath, diffraction, and signature masking by building structures make this a very harsh environment for robust acoustic measurements. Therefore, coupling acoustic measurements with seismic sensing data, to identify building structure and near-surface ground properties, would enhance the accuracy of the recovered flow field parameters.\n\nRegistration opens: Dec 4, 2023\n\nRegistration closes: Feb 29, 2024\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nSite: University of Maryland\n\nSubject area: Immunology\n\nDescription: Interns will do both theoretical and experimental components in basic concepts in Immunology relevant to Army research.

One way in which adversaries have responded is by perturbing inputs to cause misclassification to achieve their objective. This type of attack is known as adversarial machine learning (AML). Cybersecurity-related defenses to AML should strive to defend against unseen attacks and not require constant updating based on newly discovered attacks. Increasingly, supervised learning relies on a significant amount of labeled data to perform supervised learning. To avoid the requirements of a significant amount of labeled data, it is necessary to innovate self-supervised methodologies in a resource-constrained domain for network communications in the cyber domain. In the network/communications domain, machine learning-based classifiers are generally trained within a closed environment. Specifically, datasets used for training and evaluation are static and do not vary. Conversely, network environments are dynamic over time. Adversaries’ attacks become more sophisticated and change in response to defenders’ actions, requiring a defender to retrain a classifier to reflect the new attacks in the intended environment for deployment. This research seeks to address key research questions, such as: • How do we design ML for cyber classifiers using a limited amount of data in a resource-constrained environment? • How do we innovate network communication classifiers that are adversarial resilient?”\n\nRegistration: rolling basis\n\nSilver Spring, MD\n\nSite: Walter Reed Army Institute of Research\n\nDescription: WRAIR provides unique research capabilities and innovative medical solutions to a range of Force Health Protection and Readiness challenges currently facing U.S. Service Members, along with threats anticipated during future operations.\n\nThrough both times of peace and war, infectious diseases have killed, sickened, and disabled far more Service Members than bombs and bullets.

WRAIR, with its unparalleled expertise, facilities, and international network, has developed many vaccines and drugs in use today by military and civilian medicine around the globe.\n\nRegistration: rolling basis\n\nIthaca, NY\n\nSite: Cornell University\n\nSubject area: Material Science\n\nDescription:\n\nProject 1: Atomic layer deposition of high K dielectrics on AlGaN and MOSCAP characterization. In this project interns will deposit high K dielectrics (e.g. HfO2) by ALD and characterize and optimize the resultant films by making and testing simple capacitors. The intern will learn ALD, simple lithography, metal deposition, and C-V measurements.\n\nProject 2: Atomic layer etching of TMN, AlGaN and AlBN with emphasis on etch selectivity – Precision etching of the nitride heterostructures will be critical to the fabrication of the “epi-Hi-K + epi-Metal Gate” AlN based devices. Atomic Layer Etching (ALE), where layers are removed one by one, should be well suited for this precision process. CNF houses one of the few dedicated ALE systems in university laboratories. Interns will develop and characterize etch processes for enewpitaxial metals (mostly transition metal nitrides (TMNs), AlGaN and AlBN films.\n\nProject 3: Characterization of AlGaN/AlBN heterostructure interfaces. The proposed “epi-Hi-K + epi-Metal Gate” AlN-based devices require particularly flat and pristine interfaces. These films are grown within the Xing/Jena research group. Interns will use Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction to characterize the base films.\n\nProject 4: Characterization and Optimization of Ohmic Contacts to Nitride Semiconductors Project As the UWBG project proceeds to the fabrication of actual devices, reliable, high-performance ohmic contacts to the quantum well heterostructures will become an important issue. CNF has recently installed a load-locked Ultra-high vacuum electron beam evaporator specifically for clean metal contact applications. The system features a six-pocket electron gun, an ion beam, and sample heating, cooling, tilt, and rotation. For this project, the intern will optimize the ohmic contract process (materials, rates, thicknesses, cleaning, annealing temperatures ambient etc.) for contact quality and reproducibility. This will involve electron beam deposition, lithography, fabrication of transmission line structures, and electrical measurements.\n\nProject 5: LPCVD Nitride Passivation of AlGaN/AlBN Devices Project Host: Phil Infante Post-doc Mentor: Jimy Encomendero CNF is retrofitting/upgrading an existing horizontal tube furnace (one of 21 in CNF) to enable low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) of Silicon Nitride on compound semiconductors. Previously, this was limited to silicon substrates. LPCVD nitride will be used as passivation of the UWBG HEMT devices. The intern will characterize and optimize the deposition process (time, temperature, flows) on AlGaN/ALBN HEMT structures. Techniques user will include LPCVD, stress measurement, profilometry, ellipsometry, and breakdown measurements.\n\nRegistration opens: Dec 4, 2023\n\nRegistration closes: Feb 29, 2024\n\nSite: Cornell University\n\nSubject area: Material Science\n\nDescription: The intern will work collaboratively with the graduate research assistant to characterize the organization of confined fluids (e.g., water, hydrocarbon contaminants, water-hydrocarbon mixtures) using X-ray scattering measurements. Interns will work collaboratively to elucidate the crystallization of fluids in confinement, as discussed in a recent article on benzene crystallization. The anticipated scientific outcomes include the determination of the changes in freezing points as a function of pore size, fluid chemistry, water-hydrocarbon mixtures, and the crystallization behavior of confined fluids. During the first half of the 10-week summer experience, the interns will investigate the freezing behavior of single-component fluids. In the second half, the interns will build on this understanding and extend these studies to include two-component fluid mixtures.\n\nRegistration opens: Dec 4, 2023\n\nRegistration closes: Feb 29, 2024\n\nNew York, NY\n\nSite: New York University\n\nSubject area: Computer Science\n\nDescription: Interns will research single qubits, the idea of this topic is to familiarize interns with key concepts of quantum mechanics and learn to transpose them in terms of circuits using Qiskit. After getting familiar with what a qubit is, the intern will learn how to represent it and how to control it using Qiskit, we move on to a larger system. Interns will then look into Quantum State Tomography, this is how one can determine the effect of a circuit on an arbitrary state. Fully characterizing the state of a quantum state requires performing a tomography of the state. Finally, interns will learn about the impact of noise on a qubit with the methods that can be used to characterize a qubit. In the second half of the summer program, we focus on experimental realizations of basic quantum tools.\n\nRegistration opens: Dec 4, 2023\n\nRegistration closes: Feb 29, 2024\n\nSite: New York University\n\nSubject area: Biological Engineering\n\nDescription: Interns will biosynthesize, develop, and characterize conductive helical assembled fibers (CHAFs). CHAF will be engineered computationally with optimal phenylalanine residues positioned in the interior. To CHAF, interns will first study protein structures through techniques such as circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. They will be visualized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray fiber diffraction studies. The lessons learned from this proposed research will have implications for the creation of bioinspired bioelectronic materials with applications in fuel cells, biocompatible and portable power sources, miniature sensors, and neural interfaces relevant to the Army and society as a whole for the military.\n\nRegistration opens: Dec 4, 2023\n\nRegistration closes: Feb 29, 2024\n\nWest Point, NY\n\nSite: U.S. Military Academy at West Point\n\nDescription: At West Point, intern research is organized and executed through centers and institutes. These centers and institutes, along with the Academic Research Division provide the infrastructure necessary to tackle the Army and nation’s most challenging problems. Ongoing research is focused on solving current and future Army challenges using a diverse, interdisciplinary team of experts.\n\nRegistration: rolling basis"
