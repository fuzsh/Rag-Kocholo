        "text": "The center is named for President-emeritus T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Anne Hahn Hurst, and Marshall Hurst. T. Marshall Hahn Jr. was president from 1962 to 1974 and transformed VPI into a major research university before leaving to help lead Georgia-Pacific. Anne Hahn Hurst, who is President-emeritus Hahn's daughter, and Marshall Hurst, her son and his grandson, as well as Hurst's husband, Leigh Hurst, and mother, Peggy Lee Hahn, both of whom died in 2009, supported the project."
