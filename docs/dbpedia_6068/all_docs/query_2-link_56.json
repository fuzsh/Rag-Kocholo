The thrill-a-minute spy-jinks spirit him from Austria to Italy to South America as he seeks to avenge betrayal by a loved one while trying to stop a renegade environmentalist from monopolizing the \"world's most precious [natural] resource.\" Judi Dench returns as M, and Jeffrey Wright is again on board as CIA operative Felix Leiter. Olga Kurylenko costars as the Bond girl Camille."
