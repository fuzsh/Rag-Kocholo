        "text": "Cal Tech basketball team's story is subject of Rick Greenwald's captivatingly quirky Quantum Hoops, a film that's as smart as its subjects--the team of smart players who continue to push their game although they consistently lose.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Jun 27, 2009\n\nThe combination of David Duchovny's wry narration and the genuine charm of Greenwald's subjects is pretty tough to resist.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | May 16, 2008\n\nScratching your head because you don't know why David Duchovny provides narration for Rick Greenwald's Quantum Hoops? Hint: the truth is out there.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | May 8, 2008\n\nI'm not a basketball fan in the slightest, but I will admit to being wrapped up in the tension of this incredibly rousing finale. After watching this inspiring documentary, I'm sure you'll feel the same way.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Apr 16, 2008\n\nWhile it may not be the most absorbing subject for a feature documentary, the hoop dreams of a brainiac team that wants to win just once does make for an amusing diversion, especially with another season of college-bracket fever upon us.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Mar 28, 2008\n\nCouldn't the film have told the story of a single season or explored what it means for a team of genius scientists and math whizzes not to crack the code of their failure? We get glimpses and glosses but never a story.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Mar 28, 2008"
