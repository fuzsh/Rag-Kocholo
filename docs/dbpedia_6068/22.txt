Cal Tech basketball team's story is subject of Rick Greenwald's captivatingly quirky Quantum Hoops, a film that's as smart as its subjects--the team of smart players who continue to push their game although they consistently lose.

The combination of David Duchovny's wry narration and the genuine charm of Greenwald's subjects is pretty tough to resist.

I'm not a basketball fan in the slightest, but I will admit to being wrapped up in the tension of this incredibly rousing finale. After watching this inspiring documentary, I'm sure you'll feel the same way.

While it may not be the most absorbing subject for a feature documentary, the hoop dreams of a brainiac team that wants to win just once does make for an amusing diversion, especially with another season of college-bracket fever upon us.

Couldn't the film have told the story of a single season or explored what it means for a team of genius scientists and math whizzes not to crack the code of their failure? We get glimpses and glosses but never a story.
