        "text": "Arrow Films\n\nWith the advent of the talkies, The Marx Brothers - Chico, Groucho, Harpo and Zeppo - signed to Paramount Pictures and brought their stage act to cinema audience. They made five films in five years, all of which have become cornerstones of American comedy.\n\nIn their last film for Paramount the four brothers gave us what many regard to be one of the greatest comedies of all time, Duck Soup. Directed by one of the most exceptional of all Hollywood comedy directors, Leo McCarey, Duck Soup sees the Marx clan spinning a satirical tale of war and war-makers as Groucho's Rufus Firefly declares war on the neighbouring state of Sylvania.\n\nThe Paramount era represents the Marx Brothers at their absolute finest, retaining all of the energy and controlled chaos of their stage shows. Plots are unimportant, it's the gags, set-pieces and one-liners that matter!\n\nSpecial Cotents:"
