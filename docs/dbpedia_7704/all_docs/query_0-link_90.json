        "text": "May is Classic 30s Movie month. Today’s guest post comes from David Joyner.\n\nMovie Title: Duck Soup\n\nYear: 1933\n\nWriters: Bert Kalmar, Harry Ruby, Arthur Sheekman, Nat Perrin\n\nLead Actors: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, Margaret Dumont\n\nDirector: Leo McCarey\n\nPlot Summary: The small country of Freedonia is in financial trouble and before wealthy, and recently widowed, Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) gives them any more of her millions, she insists that Firefly (Groucho Marx) be appointed their leader. The Sylvanian Ambassador Trentino tries to foment a revolution and to woo Mrs. Teasdale, becoming the antagonist to Firefly’s protagonist. Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) act as spies who try to steal Freedonia’s war plans (but switch sides when it’s convenient), while Bob Roland (Zeppo) is Firefly’s secretary. It seems like every time war comes up, a song breaks out. A goofy and hilarious movie.\n\nWhy I Think This Is A Classic 30s Movie\n\nThis is an excellent example of a romantic musical comedy built around the theme of war. Film critic Roger Ebert said, “The Marx Brothers created a body of work in which individual films are like slices from the whole, but Duck Soup is probably the best.”\n\nMy Favorite Moment In The Movie\n\nThe mirror scene is a classic, copies in numerous films and TV shows. This scene was a contribution of director Leo McCarey, a revival of an old vaudeville act.\n\nMy Favorite Dialogue In the Movie\n\nI think Groucho and Chico have the funniest scenes. They are peppered with\n\npuns like this:\n\nFIREFLY: I suggest that we give him ten years in Levenworth, or eleven years in Twelveworth.\n\nCHICOLINI: I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll take five and ten in Woolworth.\n\nAnd they are also interspersed with lots of slapstick, like this:\n\nFIREFLY: You know, I’d be lost without a telephone. Now — where were we? Oh, yes — I just made you Secretary of War. The first thing you do is buy ammunition — you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.\n\nCHICOLINI: What do I get?\n\nFIREFLY: You get half mine and I get half yours.\n\nCHICOLINI: I don’t want to buy ammunition — we no gotta war.\n\nGROUCHO: Then we’ve gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?\n\nCHICOLINI: Sure, that’s easy. You gotta insult somebody.\n\nGroucho suddenly slaps Chico across the face with his gloves. Then he presents to Chicolini his card in the professional manner of an experienced duelist.\n\nFIREFLY: My card.\n\nCHICOLINI: (Laughing) That’s a-no good. You gotta insult somebody from another country.\n\nKey Things You Should Look For When Watching This Movie\n\nWhile the story is that of a lightweight romantic comedy (Firefly from Freedonia and Trentino from Sylvania both pursue Mrs Teasdale, leading to war between their countries), the key theme is not so much romance but funny/silly aspects of war.\n\nMovie Trivia\n\nBenito Mussolini took the film as a personal insult and banned it in Italy.\n\nWhen the residents of Fredonia, New York, protested the movie because they feared that the similar-sounding nation would hurt their city’s reputation, the Marx Brothers told them to change the name of their town to keep from hurting their movie.\n\nThanks, David!\n\nTo show our gratitude for your guest post, here’s a dash of creative juju for you.
