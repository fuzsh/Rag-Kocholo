        "text": "'Duck Soup' is a classic comedy movie made in 1933, directed by Leo McCarey and starring the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo) with Margaret Dumont, Raquel Torres, Louis Calhern and Edgar Kennedy.\n\nThe movie had a mixed reception when it was first released but it was rediscovered in the 1960's and is now generally regarded as a masterpiece of anarchic comedy and one of the greatest movies made by the Marx Brothers. The United States Library of Congress has declared Duck Soup \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and it is currently ranked at number 60 in the American Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest Films.\n\nIts poor reception has been blamed on the political and economic crisis in the 1930's, with the Great Depression in the US and growing concern over the rising power of Adolf Hitler in Germany which meant that audiences were just not ready for the disrespect, cynicism and brilliant satire in the movie. For similar reasons the film received no Academy Award nominations.\n\nSearch Amazon for 'Duck Soup'\n\nThe movie is full of jokes, both subtle and unsubtle, visual and verbal and contains some classic comedic scenes, such as the famous mirror scene, which are just as funny now as when the movie was made. Groucho gave his own strange recipe to explain the film's title: \"After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life.\"\n\nThe storyline is just what you might expect and indeed hope for from a Marx Brothers film - completely far-fetched and unbelievable. It revolves around Groucho playing Rufus T Firefly, the dictator of a small state called Freedonia. He attempts to win the hand of rich Mrs. Teasdale, played beautifully by Margaret Dumont, once again the perfect foil for Groucho's outrageous insults.\n\nGroucho and the Ambassador of neighbouring Sylvania declare war on each other because of the use of the word 'upstart' and everyone breaks into a negro spiritual song and dance number - \"All God's chillun got guns!\". To make matters even more chaotic, sylvania sends in the word's most inept spies, Chicolini and Pinky to obtain top secret information, creating more mayhem and of course, more opportunities for sublime anarchic comedy.\n\nThe movie's biting satire takes aim at deceitful governments, petty dictators and war in general and its irreverent message is universal. It is a piece of Marx Brothers magic.\n\nMain Cast\n\nGroucho Marx ... Rufus T. Firefly\n\nHarpo Marx ... Pinky\n\nChico Marx ... Chicolini\n\nZeppo Marx ... Lt Bob Roland\n\nMargaret Dumont ...
