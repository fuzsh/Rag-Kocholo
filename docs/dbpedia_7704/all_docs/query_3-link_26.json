King Kong \"The Eigth Wonder of the World\" standing on top of the Empire State Building, clutching the delicate Fay Wray with one hand, whilst swatting down planes with the other. This poster is reminiscent and pretty much identical to the most sought after poster in the hobby (at least for me) - The U.S. three sheet for King Kong. Which last sold at auction for $244,500 in 1999, and would probably fetch close to $1 million today. King Kong is especially noted for its stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and a groundbreaking musical score by Max Steiner. In 1991 it was deemed \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Considered by most as one of the greatest horror/fantasy films ever made, this is an amazing opportunity for poster collectors !\n\nYear: 1933\n\nNationality: Swedish\n\nCondition: Framed\n\nType: Oversized Poster\n\nSize: 25 X 47 Inches\n\nPoduct Code: P1540"
