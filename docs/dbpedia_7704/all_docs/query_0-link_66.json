        "text": "The American screwball comedy Duck Soup (1933) is considered to be among the Marx Brothers’ best films. Directed by Leo McCarey, the movie is especially noted for its anarchic style and for effectively satirizing war.\n\nGroucho Marx played Rufus T. Firefly, the cynical, sarcastic, and money-hungry leader of a fictional country called Freedonia. Margaret Dumont, who often appeared in the Marx Brothers’ films, was once again the butt of Groucho’s barbs, playing a rich widow easily wooed by his questionable charms. When the ambassador of neighboring country Sylvania attempts to overthrow Firefly—and win Dumont’s affections—Firefly declares war on Sylvania. Chico Marx portrayed a peanut seller elevated to secretary of war on the whim of Firefly, and Harpo played his characteristically silent sidekick."
