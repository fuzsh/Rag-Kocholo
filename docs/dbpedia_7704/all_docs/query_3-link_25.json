        "text": "42nd Street, American musical film, released in 1933, that featured innovative production numbers choreographed by Busby Berkeley. It was named for the Manhattan street that hosts many Broadway theatres. An instant and enduring classic, 42nd Street transformed the musical genre.\n\nThe story follows the lives and careers of numerous individuals involved with a big-budget Broadway musical. The director, Julian Marsh (played by Warner Baxter), is desperate for success, having lost his fortune when the stock market crashed. When the star (played by Dorothy Brock) suffers an injured ankle, ingenue Peggy Sawyer (played by Ruby Keeler) is chosen to take the musicalâ€™s lead role and becomes a breakout success. Ginger Rogers appeared in a supporting role as a wisecracking performer.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
