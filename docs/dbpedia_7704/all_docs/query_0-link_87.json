        "meta_description": "Purchase Duck Soup on digital and stream instantly or download offline. A pointed political satire, Duck Soup is the Marx Brothers' funniest and most insane film. Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, the hilarious dictator of mythical Freedonia. Harpo and Chico are commissioned as spies by Groucho's political rival, the calculating Trentino (Louis Calhern). The film contains many of the Brothers' famous sequences: the lemonade stand, a masterpiece of slow burn; the Paul Revere parody; the \"We're Going To War\" number, a beautiful spoof of '30s musicals; the hilarious mirror scene; and a final battle episode that has been copied by everyone from Woody Allen to Mad Magazine.",

        "text": "There’s no dense or intricate narrative in the film. It’s simply a basic story that allows Groucho, Harpo, and Chico to showcase their comedic chaos.\n\nAugust 20, 2022\n\nDuck Soup might be the only Marx Brothers film that feels completely in tune with their brand of humor, which, then and now, is downright radical.\n\nFebruary 12, 2022\n\nI found it tedious and not very funny. The fact that it was short was a relief but I don't think I will seek out any more films by the Marx Brothers.\n\nApril 1, 2021\n\nOne incidental sequence of slapstick in which Harpo smashes a mirror and then appears opposite Groucho as his reflection, is the funniest thing in any Marx film since The Cocoanuts.\n\nFebruary 3, 2021\n\nBabbling absurdity is the main ingredient and chaos is the result, with random jokes, skits, and sketches composing the bulk of the story.\n\nJuly 26, 2020\n\nThe Marx Brothers in one of their slighter divertissements. Funny and wild, but not wildly funny.\n\nJuly 23, 2019\n\nObviously desperate for material, the Four Marx Brothers tried everything from musical comedy sequences to a I-et 'Em Eat Cake burlesque revolution. An uneven production but some of the sketches are worth the money.\n\nJune 6, 2019"
