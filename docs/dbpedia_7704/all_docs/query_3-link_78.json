        "text": "The King Kong franchise, a monumental saga in cinematic history, began its journey in 1933 with the original film from RKO Pictures. Directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack introduced the iconic Kong to audiences, pioneering a legacy that now spans over a dozen films. The infamous kaiju’s first appearance in this still-revered classic, which premiered a full 21 years before Godzilla hit theaters, set the bar for monster movie storytelling. The King Kong series, known for its groundbreaking special effects, has drawn in top-tier directors like Peter Jackson and Ishirō Honda over the years. And as of late, Adam Wingard has taken the helm with Godzilla vs. Kong and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.\n\nOften hailed for its creative prowess and gripping tales, the Kong tale has ridden a rollercoaster of critical acclaim throughout its journey. King Kong's legacy stretches far beyond the silver screen, as the “Eighth Wonder of the World” has shaped storytelling across various mediums with its awe-inspiring mythology. This legendary chronicle showcases the sheer magnetism of grand-scale films that have the ability to captivate generations.\n\nIf you’re interested in becoming more acquainted with the King Kong narrative but don’t know where to start, then we can be your guide. In this article, we will detail the plot of each and every King Kong film and how to watch them in order. We will also preview the newest King Kong addition, which once again finds the giant monster paired up with Godzilla in a modern update of both franchises.\n\nKing Kong Movies In Order Of Release\n\nKing Kong (1933)\n\nSon of Kong (1933)\n\nKing Kong vs. Godzilla (1962)\n\nKing Kong Escapes (1967)\n\nKing Kong (1976)\n\nKing Kong Lives (1986)\n\nThe Mighty Kong (1998)\n\nKong: King of Atlantis (2005)\n\nKing Kong (2005)\n\nKong: Return to the Jungle (2006)\n\nKong: Skull Island (2017)\n\nGodzilla vs. Kong (2021)\n\nGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire (2024)\n\n1. King Kong (1933)\n\nDirected by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, and produced by David O. Selznick, King Kong stars Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot. The most groundbreaking giant monster movie of all time centers on director Carl Denham as he embarks on an expedition to Skull Island, where he stumbles upon the soon-to-be-legendary colossal primate Kong. Captured and brought to New York for public exhibition, Kong eventually escapes and wreaks havoc. This groundbreaking movie revolutionized the film industry with its pioneering use of stop-motion techniques, setting a new standard for visual storytelling. This film not only wowed audiences with its fresh narrative and technical mastery but also left a lasting mark on the movie-making world.\n\nHere’s where you can watch King Kong.\n\n2. Son of Kong (1933)\n\nReleasing just months after the original, Son of Kong, once agin directed by Ernest B. Schoedsack and produced by Merian C. Cooper, brings back Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham. Denham ventures back to the mysterious Skull Island and stumbles upon a surprisingly gentle giant, the offspring of the formidable Kong. Helen Mack and Frank Reicher join the cast, shifting gears to blend more humor with the thrills in this sequel. Although it couldn't replicate the immense success of the first film, Son of Kong was appreciated for its attempt to provide a lighter, more comedic angle to the saga.\n\nHere’s where you can watch Son of Kong.\n\n3. King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962)\n\nIn this monumental crossover directed by Ishirō Honda and produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka, King Kong vs. Godzilla epitomizes a clash of titans, thrusting two iconic behemoths of cinema into an epic showdown. In a thrilling mash-up of sci-fi and action, we see how a drug company's wild scheme to snatch King Kong leads to an epic showdown with Godzilla by sheer accident. Starring a trio of Japanese actors—Tadao Takashima, Kenji Sahara, and Yū Fujiki—the film focused more on visual extravagance than plot depth. The movie raked in profits, especially in its home country, but the critics were split—some dug the fun it brought to the table, while others wished for a meatier story. Reviewers often praised the film's sheer fun factor and its significant impact on monster movies, despite noting its over-the-top style.\n\nHere’s where you can watch King Kong vs. Godzilla.\n\n4. King Kong Escapes (1967)\n\nDirected by Ishirō Honda and produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka, King Kong Escapes is a unique installment in the franchise. Rhodes Reason, Mie Hama, and Linda Miller lead the cast in this franchise reboot, where the iconic King Kong faces off against his computerized counterpart, Mechani-Kong, masterminded by the nefarious Dr. Who (played by Hideyo Amamoto). As a sort of departure, the plot intertwines aspects of spycraft and escapade (undoubtedly influenced by the newly established James Bond franchise). Although the new approach didn't achieve the critical acclaim of earlier films, King Kong Escapes was notable for its imaginative premise and special effects, appealing to monster movie fans through its blend of creativity and camp.\n\nHere’s where you can watch King Kong Escapes.\n\n5. King Kong (1976)\n\nA modern reimagining of the classic tale, the 1976 King Kong was directed by John Guillermin and produced by Dino De Laurentiis. In this 1976 revival, the trio of Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange and Charles Grodin bring a fresh dynamic to this epic saga. Amid a pressing energy crunch, the film trails a team's voyage to Skull Island where they stumble upon Kong and witness an unexpected friendship unfold between Kong and the classic main female character (played by Lange). Critics had mixed feelings about the film. They were wowed by the lifelike Kong animatronic, but gave less enthusiastic reviews about the rather conventional storytelling. The film's stunning special effects snagged an Oscar, yet the plot and acting didn't quite hit the mark with critics.\n\nHere’s where you can watch King Kong.\n\n6. King Kong Lives (1986)\n\nKing Kong Lives was directed by John Guillermin and produced by De Laurentiis. In the follow-up to the box office hit, Linda Hamilton and Brian Kerwin join forces as King Kong not only beats death after his tumble but also faces a heart-stopping surgery and finds love with another of his kind. The sequel opted for a bolder, more love-driven narrative than the previous King Kong film. Although the movie swung for the fences with its bold storyline and visuals, it fell flat with critics and at the box office due to a hard-to-believe plot and uninspired delivery.\n\nHere’s where you can watch King Kong Lives.\n\n7. The Mighty Kong (1998)\n\nIn this animated musical adaptation, The Mighty Kong offers a family-friendly take on the King Kong story. Art Scott steers the show, with Dudley Moore and Jodi Benson lending their voices to jazz up the legendary King Kong narrative through song and choreography. Set in the 1930s, it follows a similar storyline of Kong being taken from Skull Island to New York. Although it didn't grab headlines like its big-screen counterparts, this take on the King Kong saga captured a younger crowd with its fresh twist.\n\nHere’s where you can watch The Mighty Kong.\n\n8. Kong: King of Atlantis (2005)\n\nDirected by Patrick Archibald, this animated film diverges from the traditional King Kong narrative. In Kong: King of Atlantis, Kong battles to protect the mythical city of Atlantis. Targeting a youthful crowd, the film found its niche away from the silver-screen spotlight that normally accompanied the big-budget live action extravaganzas. This rendition leans heavily into the fantastical, shedding light on imaginative aspects not grounded in the original narrative's reality. While the film struck a chord with kids, it didn't quite shake up the King Kong universe.\n\nHere’s where you can watch Kong: King of Atlantis.\n\n9. King Kong (2005)\n\nPeter Jackson's remake of King Kong starring Naomi Watts offers a passionate, modern take on the classic Ann Darrow character. The emotional depth displayed between Ann and Kong takes center stage, offering a nuanced perspective on their connection that brought new, invigorating life to the franchise. The movie not only raked in profits and won over critics, but it also snagged awards for its standout special effects, stellar acting, and top-notch directing. King Kong notched three Oscars, notably for Best Visual Effects, earning praise for its fresh yet faithful spin on a beloved tale.\n\nHere’s where you can watch King Kong.\n\n10. Kong: Return to the Jungle (2006)\n\nThis animated film, directed by Stuart Evans, presents a less traditional take on the King Kong story. In Kong: Return to the Jungle, the fabled giant monster is taken from his island to a city, where he must fight to return to his jungle home. This movie aims to capture the hearts of kids and takes a fresh path, steering away from the classic narrative we're used to. Critics weren't swept off their feet, but the animated spin on Kong did catch the eye for its bold approach to engaging a new, younger demographic.\n\nHere’s where you can watch Kong: Return to the Jungle.\n\n11. Kong: Skull Island (2017)\n\nDirected by Jordan Vogt-Roberts and produced by Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni, Mary Parent, and Alex Garcia, Kong: Skull Island offers a fresh perspective on the King Kong legend. The movie features a star-studded lineup, with the likes of Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson bringing new aesthetic to the saga. After the Vietnam War, an expedition explores the mysterious Skull Island and encounters the imposing Kong figure. Critics praised the film for its stunning visuals, gripping action, and standout portrayal of Kong, who was given an unprecedented level of emotional complexity. The movie not only raked in impressive earnings at the box office but also played a key role in expanding the \"MonsterVerse\" that has become so prevalent today, adding richness to its expansive narrative tapestry.\n\nHere’s where you can watch Kong: Skull Island.\n\n12. Godzilla vs. Kong (2021)\n\nIn this epic crossover event directed by Adam Wingard, Godzilla vs. Kong brought together two of cinema's most iconic monsters. Alexander Skarsgård, Millie Bobby Brown and Rebecca Hall headline the cast of this monumental clash between the two most famous kaijus in movie history. As Godzilla and Kong clash in a titanic struggle, humanity watches, its fate hanging in the balance as we wait to see which titan will rise as the supreme monster ruler. This franchise updated thrilled viewers with stunning visual effects and heart-pounding action sequences. Despite the challenges of a pandemic-era release, it performed well at the box office and was well-received by both audiences and critics, becoming a highlight of the MonsterVerse.\n\nHere’s where you can watch Godzilla vs. Kong.\n\n13. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (2024)\n\nGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire is the latest addition to both the King Kong and Godzilla franchises, and was released in theaters on March 29, 2024. Adam Wingard directs this highly anticipated sequel to Godzilla vs. Kong, which promises to escalate the MonsterVerse to new heights.
