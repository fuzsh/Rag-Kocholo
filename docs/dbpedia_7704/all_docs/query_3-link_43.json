        "text": "King Kong first scaled the Empire State Building in 1933, and he's back in theaters this weekend in Kong: Skull Island.\n\nThe first King Kong film was released in 1933 with great amount of success. The movie focused on a film crew who visited Skull Island and discovered a monster in their paths, also known as King Kong. The giant gorilla is captured and taken to New York City, where he develops a bond with a woman played by Fay Wray.\n\nAfter 1933, the movie's success resulted in several remakes, sequels and television series. The newest installment will tell the tale of a group of explorers who travel to an island and encounter Kong with a cast that includes Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston and John Goodman.\n\nCheck out how Kong has evolved over the years, from his very first big-screen incarnation."
