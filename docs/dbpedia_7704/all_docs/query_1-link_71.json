        "text": "Duck Soup is deserving of high praise 90 years later because it’s pure Marx Brothers, start to finish, without any tacked-on song-and-dance numbers, boring romantic storylines, sentimentalism, or reliance on plot that often bogged down many of their later movies. It’s a wall-to-wall machine of comedic efficiency and absurdist perfection.\n\nCrammed to the brim with verbal humor, slapstick, satire, and anarchic amusement over a mere 68 minutes, Duck Soup is the purest distillation of Marxist humor on film and is still regarded as one of the downright funniest flicks ever created. Declaring which Marx Brothers movie is the best is a very subjective exercise, but arguably this picture is more densely layered with jokes, gags, and witticisms than Horse Feathers, A Night at the Opera, Monkey Business, Animal Crackers, or any other contender for the crown."
