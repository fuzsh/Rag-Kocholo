Firefly, the hilarious dictator of mythical Freedonia. Harpo and Chico are commisioned as spies by Groucho`s political rival, the calculating Trentino.\n\nThe film contains many of the Brothers` famous sequences: the lemonade stand, a masterpiece of slow burn; the Paul Revere parody; the \"We`re Going To War\" number, a beautiful spoof of 30`s musicals; the hilarious mirror scene; and a final battle episode that has been copied by everyone from Woody Allen to Mad Magazine."
