A great portrait of The Four Marx Brothers in their last feature film together, before Zeppo exited to begin a new life as a theatrical agent and engineer. Photos showing all four of the then Marx Brothers are very scarce and here they are at the end of the climactic battle scene which ends the movie. Scene photo is coded 1453-76. Creases at all four corners. Photo was library used and has several stamps on the verso including one from Dell Publishing. Some tape remnants on back also. Original 1933 Paramount copyright material printed on the front bottom white margin. NEAR FINE.",
