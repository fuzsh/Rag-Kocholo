Duck Soup was the title of a 1933 zany Marx Brothers movie. When asked for an explanation of the title, Groucho quipped, “Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you’ll duck soup for the rest of your life.” Like the film, Duck Soup is a potpourri of the unexpected: Something old, something new, something weird and something groove. A mixture of folk, jazz, pop, blues, psychedelia and new age, with a pinch of classical, all in a mind expanding soup of flavorful tunes. With a little Marx Brothers zaniness in between.
