        "text": "Last week the community of Nhill was surprised to find the Nhill Railway Station fenced off and out of bounds to the community, without any consultation, after being deemed unsafe for public use by the Australian Rail Track Corporation.\n\nLocal resident Margaret Millington said it was a sad situation and that “Sadly, the Nhill station is now inaccessible to passengers wishing to travel on the Overland.\n\nToday [26 July 2023] it was completely enclosed by a wire mesh fence, having been deemed unsafe for public use. There is no seating or shelter at this stage, although I have been advised this is being discussed with relevant departments.\n\nHaving successfully ‘Saved the Overland’ when its continued use became threatened, I wonder what we can do as a community to ‘Save the Station’ or at least improve the current eyesore we have been left with! Whilst I appreciate public safety is paramount, I believe our community could have been shown more respect in the manner this whole issue has been handled. I am proud of our town and all that has been achieved in so many ways by so many, I think we deserve better!”\n\nA spokesperson from the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) said, “The Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) has fenced off the Nhill Railway Station due to safety concerns.\n\nA structural engineering report commissioned by ARTC has found the station is unsafe for rail passengers.\n\nAn alternate defined pathway, suitable for wheelchairs, has been constructed to allow passengers to access the platform to board train services.\n\nMember for Lowan and Deputy Leader of the Nationals, Emma Kealy, is calling on the Minister for Public Transport to immediately organise works required to allow Nhill Railway Station to re-open as soon as possible.\n\nWithout any warning to the community, Nhill Railway Station was closed and fenced off on Monday July 17, with locals unsure if the station will ever re-open.\n\n“It is unacceptable that travellers now have nowhere to sit or shelter over winter and no access to toilets or a waiting room,” Ms Kealy said.\n\n“Closing a train station in the city without notice simply wouldn’t be tolerated, yet this cruel blow is exactly what has occurred in Nhill.”\n\nAustralian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) engaged contractors to fence off the Nhill Train Station on Monday 17 July 2023 as an immediate measure following a heritage inspection that identified hazardous materials within the Nhill Facility, and to allow further assessments to be undertaken on the facility.\n\nARTC priorities are community safety and maintaining access to the platform in the immediate term. ARTC signage is posted at the station and according to ARTC notification was sent to stakeholders late on Friday 14 July. The works occurred Monday but they also expect further works in the more immediate term. They did apologise for the short notice, however once they became aware of potential hazardous materials they needed to act quickly and did have some issues securing a contractor to undertake the works.\n\nCouncil understands the building is leased by ARTC from Victorian State Government and they will need to work with them on next steps and longer term measures.\n\nCouncil understands there are no plans to change services, and in recent days the State Government has advised that another three years of funding has been committed to The Overland train service, however there are more works to be undertaken at the Station. Council has no immediate details on scope, timelines, or cost for the works.\n\nContacts for ARTC are located on the poster (as attached) with both a phone number and email address and all enquiries should be directed to ARTC in the first instance.\n\nCouncil will advocate to both ARTC & the State Government for the station works to be completed in a timely manner, and will also continue our advocacy for a daily passenger rail service through to Nhill.\n\nARTC will work with VicTrack, the Department of Transport and Planning Victoria and Journey Beyond to consider the future for the station."
