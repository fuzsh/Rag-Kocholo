        "text": "Regional city in Victoria, Australia\n\nHorsham ( )[2] is a regional city in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, Australia. Located on a bend in the Wimmera River, Horsham is approximately 300 kilometres (190 mi) northwest of the state capital Melbourne. As of the 2021 census, Horsham had a population of 20,429.[1] It is the most populous city in Wimmera, and the main administrative centre for the Rural City of Horsham local government area. It is the eleventh largest city in Victoria after Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Wodonga, Mildura, Shepparton, Warrnambool, Traralgon, and Wangaratta.\n\nAn early settler James Monckton Darlot named the settlement after the town of Horsham in his native England. It grew throughout the latter 19th and early 20th centuries as a centre of Western Victoria's wheat and wool industry, becoming the largest city in the Wimmera and Western Victoria by the early 1910s. Horsham was declared a city in 1949 and was named Australia's Tidiest Town in 2001[3] and Victoria's Tidiest Town in 2021.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPre-colonisation\n\n[edit]\n\nRecent archaeological research of rock shelters by La Trobe University in the Grampians found clear evidence of Aboriginal occupation 3–4,000 years ago, and the possibility of occupation up to 22,000 years ago.[5] The rock shelters would have provided reliable access to water and a base to hunt megafauna on the plains of the Wimmera.[5] Then \"around the time of the arrival of the First Fleet, the Jardwa people were being forced south by either a Murray or northern Victorian tribe called the Wotjol\".[6] By the time of European exploration and settlement, the Jardwadjali language (a dialect of the Wemba-wemba language group common across most of Western Victoria)[7]) was well established across the southern portion of the Wimmera region.[5] Wimmera Aboriginal people hunted and traded widely, with stone for their tools coming up from the Grampians in the Ararat district.[6] Relations between Europeans and Aboriginal people, as across much of Australia, were mixed, featuring both conflict[5] and cooperation.[8] One of the last Aboriginal missions in Victoria, Ebenezer Mission, was run successfully by the Moravian Order during the 1870s and 1880s, providing education and employment for the region's Indigenous people before it fell into decline in the 1890s and closed in 1902.[6]\n\nEuropean exploration\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor Thomas Mitchell was the first European to pass through the area, naming the Wimmera River on 18 July 1836.[9] After the explorer Edward Eyre passed through the region seeking an overland route between Port Philip and Adelaide, he reported to The Adelaide Gazette on 14 July 1838, that the region was \"well-watered and affording good pasturage for stock.\"[10]\n\nSettlement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe squatters were the first European settlers in the Wimmera. William J Bracewell made the first claim, claiming 100,000 acres at Dooen on 10 August 1842.[11] Although Captain Chris Lewis was the first resident of the Wimmera, settling at Ledcourt Station at Glenorchy in 1840. Charles Carter, a Squatter from Van Diemen's Land established his property \"Brim Springs\" nearby in 1845.[12] The Wimmera region was made part of the Portland Bay district in 1843 and then became its own district in 1846.[13] Land ownership was formalised in 1847, and the \"Wimmera squatters wasted no time in securing their land cheaply as leasehold.\"[13] George Langlands, a merchant from Melbourne was encouraged by James Darlot to move to the Wimmera region and open a store. Langlands reached the Wimmera and opened a general store in October 1849 on what is now the corner of Darlot and Hamilton Street. A Post Office had opened a year earlier on 1 July 1848.[14] By 1851 the small village of Horsham had been established, consisting of an estimated 18 homes.[13]\n\nTown\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1851 census counted 2,019 people living in the Wimmera region.[15] The Victorian gold rush connected Horsham with the rest of the state, when it became a stop-over point for the Gold Escort in 1851.[15] Governance was formalised in 1858 when the Wimmera area was included in region's first electoral district, covering an area from the Murry River in the north, then south to the Wimmera River and then east to the Grampian Range.[16] Then in 1862 the Horsham District Road Board was established, which later evolved into the Horsham Shire with the passing of the Local Government Act in 1864.[16] The electric telegraph was connected in 1875[17] and the main railway from Melbourne reached Horsham in 1879.[18] The Horsham Borough Council and the Shire of Wimmera operated the McKenzie Creek Tramway from the town to a stone quarry, approximately 8 kilometres (5 mi) to the south. The horse tramway opened within the town in 1885 but had ceased operating by 1927. Special picnic trains operated from time to time conveying residents in open wagons along the McKenzie Creek Tramway.[19]\n\nThe 1870s saw significant economic and demographic growth in Horsham. During this period the foundry, the hospital, and the Horsham Agricultural Society were established, with the first Horsham show held in 1876.[20] Geoffrey Blainey, notes in his History of Victoria, that the Victorian railway building boom of the 1870s enabled large-scale wheat production to begin in the Wimmera.[18] He also describes a unique migration of German farmers, mostly Lutherans from South Australia, who travelled across east in covered-wagons along with their families and herds of cattle and then settled in the Wimmera district.[18] Blainey writes that \"nothing in Australian history so resembles the opening of the American west as this trek of farmers to the Victorian plains in the 1870s'.\" Farming production in the region dramatically increased, and wheat was established as the dominant agricultural crop.[18]\n\nAlthough flooding along the Wimmera River was noted during the early period of the settlement, the first major flood was recorded in 1883 with the first flood causing serious damage occurring in 1889, when several buildings and the tramway were damaged.[21] Several serious floods then occurred along the Wimmera River over the next five decades, in 1894, 1903, 1909, 1915 and then in 1923. The flood in 1923 was the third largest on record.[21] In response to this history of flooding, the council successfully applied in 1946 for money from the State Parliamentary Public Works Committee for flood management.[21]\n\nMen from Horsham fought in the First World War. \"By mid-August 1914 the first of Horsham's soldiers were given a rousing civic farewell at the Town Hall.\"[22] However conscription \"divided the community\", with the Anti-Conscription League noting the high rate (6%) of conscription in the Horsham district.[22] The Discharged Soldier Settlement Act of 1917 was created to give returning soldiers a head-start establishing farms in regional Australia. According to the act returning soldiers with farm-experience could apply for a block of land. By 1919 2,933 ex-servicemen had taken up the opportunity.[23] The average size of the land grants were 250 to 500 acres (100 to 200 ha). When World War II started, men from Horsham again volunteered. The war effort was enthusiastically embraced, for example in May 1940, when King George VI made a Commonwealth-wide call to prayer, 1,800 people attended a religious service at the town hall.[22] Returning servicemen were again given the opportunity to take up land grants at the end of the war, with the average size of the blocks being between 650 and 750 acres (260 and 300 ha).[23]\n\nCity\n\n[edit]\n\nHorsham's population had reached 6,388 in 1947[24] and so it was declared a city on 24 May 1949.[25] In 1950 Horsham celebrated its Centenary with a parade through the city.[26] But then tragedy struck on 24 February 1951, when a train and bus collided at a level crossing on Dimboola Road, resulting in 11 deaths.[27] The Horsham Streetscape was dramatically remodelled in the 1960s when planning laws were changed and shopfront verandahs were removed from the Post Office, The Bull and Mouth, and The White Hart pubs.[28] The Horsham City council installed the first parking meters on Firebrace Street in 1963.[26] A major fire damaged the new State Public Office on McLachlan Street in 1971.[26] In 1995, the Rural City of Horsham was formed through the amalgamation of the Horsham City, Wimmera and Arapiles Shires.[24] Horsham was named Australia's Tidiest Town in 2001[3] and was also named Victoria's tidiest town in 2015.[29]\n\nThe Black Saturday bushfires of 2009 affected Horsham, with 5,700 ha (14,000 acres) area burnt around the city's fringe including the golf club and eight homes destroyed in the Haven area.[30] Horsham experienced significant flooding in successive years in 2010 and 2011 Victorian floods. During these events, the Wimmera reached 3.32 m and 4.71 m respectively. The 2011 event was particularly severe with the Wimmera River reaching a record peak; over 1,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters divided the city and damaged 600 houses pushing up to a metre of water into parts of the CBD.[31]\n\nTraditional ownership\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Victorian government has recognised the Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagik nations as the traditional owners for the Horsham area.[32] These five nations are represented by the Barengi Gadjin Land Council Aboriginal Corporation.[33]\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the 2021 census of population, there were 20,429 people in Horsham.\n\n49% Male\n\n51 % Female\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.8% of the population (Indigenous status not stated 5.1% and Non-Indigenous 93.2%)\n\nThe median age is 41\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nWimmera River\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Horsham is situated on the floodplain of the Wimmera River, south of the Dooen Swamp and north of the River's junction with McKenzie Creek.[34] The Wimmera River rises in the western slopes of the Pyrenees and then runs west towards Horsham before turning north at Quantong and heading north towards the Murray, but empties into Lake Hindmarsh.[34] The Wimmera River is dammed by a weir at the southern edge of the city. A recent study in December 2017, found that the Millennium drought decimated the Platypus population in the River leaving only a solitary colony south of the weir.[35]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nHorsham has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSk) with a mean annual temperature of 14.7°C (58.5°F) and a mean annual rainfall of 380.3 mm. It experiences one of the coolest climates of this type in Australia, due to its southern latitude and close proximity to oceanic and mediterranean climate zones.\n\nSummer\n\n[edit]\n\nMost summer days in Horsham are hot, clear and dry with low relative humidity. January is the warmest month with a mean maximum temperature of 30.6 °C (87.1 °F). Horsham is prone to experiencing extreme heat days, particularly for its latitude, and records about 25 days annually with maximum temperatures above 35°C (95°F). These are confined to the months of November to March, with most occurring in January and February.[36] On the other hand, overnight minimums during summer are typically quite cool. The resulting wide diurnal temperature variation is characteristic of the BSk climate type; in summer the difference between the daily high temperature and the overnight minimum is frequently greater than 20°C (68°F) and may exceed 25°C (77°F) on the hottest days.\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in Horsham of 47.9°C (118.2°F) on 20 December 2019 is the equal third-highest temperature ever recorded in the state of Victoria.[37]\n\nWinter\n\n[edit]\n\nHorsham typically experiences cool, relatively long winters where cloudy days featuring light, misty rain and drizzle are common. July is the coolest month with a mean maximum temperature of 13.6 °C (56.5 °F). Horsham records minimum temperatures below freezing (0°C/32°F) on about 26 mornings annually; these occur almost exclusively between the months of May and October, with the majority in the central winter months of June to August.[36] Rainy days - defined as days with any amount of rainfall - predominate in June to August, but the total winter rainfall received remains low relative to most locations in Victoria and is only slightly higher than that received in summer.\n\nStatistics\n\n[edit]\n\nLand use\n\n[edit]\n\nHorsham's topography is flat, approximately 128 metres (420 ft) above sea level. The central business district (CBD) is laid out in a grid plan south of the train line and is characterised by wide streets and several roundabouts.[34] Firebrace Street, running north–south through the middle of the CBD is one of Horsham's original \"thoroughfares\" (first surveyed in 1849) and is named after a soldier from the British Army, Major William Firebrace (1795-1856).[39] Residential areas extend north of the train line, west towards Natimuk and south-west towards Haven and south-east across Burnt Creek. A light industrial area is located south of the Wimmera River.\n\nDue to the flat topography and floodplain clay, there are very few multi-story buildings. The five most prominent buildings in the city are the State Government Offices on McLachlan Street, the T&G clocktower on Firebrace Street, St John Anglican church on the Western Highway, the Horsham Cinema and Horsham Town Hall, both on Pynsent Street.\n\nMining\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to Horsham's location in the Murray Basin, the area to the east and south of the city contain extensive deposits of Mineral Sands, primarily ilmenite, zircon and rutile.[40] Preliminary exploration was conducted in the 1980s at Drung, a locality 20 kilometres (12 mi) east of Horsham. However, the Conservation Council of Australia opposed the exploration citing the long-term consequences of mining activity and the possibility of inadequate rehabilitation.[41]\n\nIn June 2018 new mining exploration leases for the Wimmera region were granted by the Victorian State Government.[42]\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Rural City of Horsham\n\nIn 1993 the Kennett Government passed the Local Government (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill which resulted in council amalgamations across Victoria.[43] So in 1995 the City of Horsham merged with the Wimmera and Arapiles shires to form the Horsham Rural City Council, making Horsham the seat of local government.[43] The current Mayor of Horsham is Robyn Guilline.[44]\n\nIn the Legislative Assembly of Victoria Horsham is part of the Electoral district of Lowan and is currently represented by Emma Kealy. For the Legislative Council of Victoria Horsham is part of the Western Victoria Region and is currently represented by Jaala Pulford, Simon Ramsay, Gayle Tierney, Josh Morris and James Purcell.\n\nIn the Federal Parliament of Australia the city is represented in the Australian House of Representatives by the Division of Mallee. Currently held by Anne Webster and until the 2019 Federal Election was considered a very safe National party seat.[45]\n\nThe Horsham Police station on Roberts Ave, along with ordinary policing duties also handles traffic, firearm registration and crime investigation.[46] Next to the Police station is the Horsham Magistrates' Court.[47]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Horsham Botanic Gardens, managed by the Horsham Rural City Council, are located between the Horsham City Oval and Horsham Caravan Park and were designed by landscape architect William Guilfoyle. Sawyer park alongside the Wimmera River contains a sound shell and hosts the ANZAC day dawn service, Carols by Candlelight and Australia Day events.\n\nArts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Horsham Town Hall, rebuilt and enlarged in February 2016, is the city's main performing arts venue, attracting a wide range of national and international acts.[48] It is operated by the Horsham Rural City Council also contains the Horsham Regional Art Gallery. The Wesley Performing Arts Centre, once the Wesley Church, was, until 2018, a second performance venue. However, it was closed indefinitely in June 2018 due to safety concerns.[49] The Horsham Arts Council, formed in 1972 and based in Old Hamilton Road, regularly stages musicals.[50] Horsham also hosts the annual Art is...festival, some aspects of the biennial Nati Frinj Festival and Awakenings (Australia's only regional disability arts festival).[51] Centre Cinemas manage a movie theatre on Pynsent St.[52]\n\nCuisine\n\n[edit]\n\nAn item of food said to be unique to Horsham is the florrie. A variation of the cordon bleu, it consists of a piece of beef steak thinly sliced, wrapped around slices of ham and processed cheese, and then crumbed. Introduced by local chef Alfonso Baviello in the mid 20th century and originally dubbed the Florentine, it can be purchased fresh at Horsham butcher shops or as a cooked meal in cafes and pubs.[53]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nHorsham has community bands such as the Horsham City Brass Band and the Horsham Pipe Band with many towns surrounding the city having their own community bands. Some of the Horsham pubs host live music and the city hosts both the annual Kannamroo festival and Horsham Country Music Festival.\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nHorsham is served by three newspapers, the Wimmera Mail-Times (a tri-weekly paid publication), the Weekly Advertiser (a free weekly) and the Horsham Times (a weekly paid publication). Printed news from the Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) Wimmera is available on the ABC Wimmera Facebook page and is also broadcast via its local radio station. Other available national radio stations in Horsham are ABC Classic, Radio National, ABC NewsRadio and Triple J. 3WM 1089 AM and MIXXFM 101.3 are the local commercial stations and Triple H 96.5 FM is the local community radio station.[54]\n\nHorsham is also served by local transmission of free-to-air television networks ABC, Prime7 (Seven), Southern Cross (10), WIN (Nine) and SBS.\n\nReligions and faiths\n\n[edit]\n\nA total of 60% of people in Horsham identified with Christianity at the 2016 national census (which is higher than the national average) although nearly 30% identified as \"no religious affiliation\", which reflected the national average.[55]\n\nDenominational Christian churches Denomination Building name Building location Anglican Church of St John the Divine 162 Baillie Street Assemblies of God Harvest Christian Church 17 Florence Street Church of Christ 91 River Road Jehovah Witness Kingdom Hall 23 Dimboola Road Lutheran Holy Trinity Lutheran Church Cnr Baillie St and McPherson St Latter-day Saints 154 Baillie Street Presbyterian 16 Kalkee Road Roman Catholic Ss Ss Michael & John's Catholic Church 13 McLachlan Street Salvation Army 12 Kalkee Road Uniting Church 10 Pynsent St\n\nThe Horsham Ministers Association established the Christian Emergency Food Centre on Firebrace Street[56] and help organise the annual Carols by Candlelight.

Cricket and tennis are the most popular summer sports in Horsham.\n\nThe Wimmera Regional Sports Assembly Inc. is a volunteer based organisation established to support the growth, development and promotion of sport and recreation at the grass roots level.[61]\n\nThe assembly provides a vital link between local clubs and state and national bodies. It has formed a solid partnership with Sport and Recreation Victoria and other strategic partners (including VicHealth, Local Government, and health agencies) to provide a quality service for Wimmera sports clubs and associations which encompasses the needs and priorities of the region.\n\nThe assembly office is at 22B Pynsent Street in Horsham and staff can readily provide information and support on a variety of sports related topics.
