The Queensland Air Museum tells us \"It should be noted that for many years there was some doubt as to the correct military identity of VH-BIF which was thought to be W2472, but it is now believed to be AX305. Anson AX305 is understood to have a fuselage number of R3/LW/107500. This number is carried on a data plate which was found affixed to the fuselage of VH-BIF at the time of its recovery from Charleville. Anson W2472 is understood to have a fuselage number in the range R3/LW/88521 (W2434) to R3/LW/88569 (W2486). Anson W2472 has since been located at Miles, Qld. As these numbers were not allocated in strict sequence, it is not possible to extrapolate corresponding military serial numbers or vice versa. The weight of evidence now suggests that VH-BIF is ex AX305.\"\n\nNow known that AX305 became VH-BIF although this aircraft was officially ex W2472. As VH-BIF its subsequent history is: CoR No 2124 issued 15.7.55 to R.G. Carswell, Moorooka, Qld - change of address to c/- Carsair, Port Moresby, NG, .56.

Note: A letter from Alan Thomas of the Camden Museum of Aviation dated 10 April 2005 quoted on the Adastra Aerial Surveys Website states: \"Originally Moorabbin Air Museum were going to acquire an Anson from Adastra but when they acquired VH-FIA down in Melbourne they had no further interest in an Adastra Anson. This left the way open for Father (Harold Thomas - founder of the museum) and I to acquire VH-AGA. At the same time VH-BLF was at Mascot with no future owner so we were allowed to remove any parts we thought useful. We removed one Cheetah, the main instrument panel, throttle box, undercarriage fairings and many small items. Before we took control of AGA a strong wind went through Mascot and AGA and BLF actually hit each other on the aileron and trailing edge of opposite wings. So we removed the undamaged trailing edge and aileron from BLF and fitted it to AGA. So some pieces of BLF still exist today with the engine, panel and throttle box on display in the Museum. We gave the other airframe pieces to Colin Wear, now deceased, who was going to build a flying Anson, but the project literally never got off the ground and he eventually sold the BLF parts to the RAAF Museum at Point Cook.\" EG127 2 AD 8.2.43. 1 RCS 12.5.43. 15 ARD 12.11.43. 8 CU 8.2.44. 2 AP 30.6.44.

By 1966 only parts remained and rear fuselage was at Gulnare Lawn Bowls Club in use as a stepladder. By 1980s only parts and engine cowlings remained. LV298 This was the believed identity of the nose section of the Anson being restored by Alan Penhall at Ballarat Airport in which 80% of the fuselage is from LV284. However, RAF records indicate that LV298 did not leave the United Kingdom and no card for this aircraft is held by RAAF Records. As the nose section is believed to be from an aircraft that served in Ballarat with 1 WAGS and was sold for scrap in 1946, further investigation is needed.
