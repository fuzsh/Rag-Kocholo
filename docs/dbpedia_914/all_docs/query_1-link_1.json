        "text": "Nhill Airport in Victoria is located 1 nautical mile northwest of Nhill, about four hours northwest of Melbourne. The Nhill Aviation Heritage Centre is located there.\n\nIn the spring of 1924 Francis Birtles, noted Australian explorer, arrived over Nhill in an aeroplane piloted by Lieut. Briggs of the Royal Australian Air Force, and landed in Messrs Moll Bros. paddock, a mile east of the town. They were returning from an exploring flight over the Lake Eyre region of northern South Australia and were met in Nhill by Messrs Herbert Moll, S. C. Moll and F. K. McKenzie, who was intensely interested in aviation. Lieut. Briggs said, “Why don’t you make this an aerodrome? It is ideal for the purpose and is exactly half-way between Melbourne and Adelaide.”\n\nToday Nhill is not only the oldest inland airport in Victoria, but it is one of the chain of great aerodromes that extends from Brisbane to Perth. Herb. Moll said that he was prepared to grant the paddock at an infinitesimal rental to the aviation authorities. After protracted negotiations the ground was inspected by officers of the civil and military departments and the area was ultimately proclaimed a Government landing ground."
