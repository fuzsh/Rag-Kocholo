        "text": "Last updated 17 July 2023\n\nRYAN ST-M IN AUSTRALIA\n\nA listing compiled by Geoff Goodall\n\nRyan ST-Ms VH-AHC, VH-AHD and VH-CXR were based together on farming property Carnarney near Jerilderie NSW during the 1960s.\n\nThey were rolled out of their sheds for this group picture in May 1967. Photo by Geoff Goodall\n\nThe Ryan ST-M (Sport Trainer-Military) series was an export military version of the pre-war ST-A civilian sports aircraft, powered by a 150hp Menasco C4S Pirate engine. The ST-Ms were built at Ryan Aeronautical Co's works at Lindbergh Field, San Diego in southern California.\n\nAll Australian examples were STM-2 models, which had been previously delivered to the Netherlands Naval Air Service in the Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia). The Netherlands Government in Exile in New York had placed a series of orders for a total of 108 Ryan STM-2s between June and October 1940\n\n- 60 for Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL-ML): serials RO-120 to RO-69, c/ns 407 to 446\n\n- 48 for Netherlands Naval Air Service (Marine Luchtvaart Dienst) MLD: serials S-11 to S-58, c/ns 447 to 494\n\nThe Naval order included 24 aircraft with strengthened airframes with twin floats, designated STM-S2. These could be also fitted with landplane undercarriage and the orders included 12 additional sets of wheeled undercarriage. The Ryans were built at San Diego in three batches, then shipped to Java:\n\nNovember 1940: 18 built\n\nDecember 1940: 12 built\n\nJanuary 1941: 18 built\n\nRyan publicity picture of Netherlands East Indies Ryan STM-S2 S-11 on a test flight at San Diego in 1940.\n\nA formation of Naval Air Service (MLD) Ryan STMs in Netherlands East Indies with different markings.\n\nPhoto: Air History.net Archive\n\nMLD Ryan STM-S2 and Fokker floatplanes, Netherlands East Indies 1941 . Frank F. Smith collection\n\nBy the outbreak of war with Japan on 8 December 1941, the MLD had lost 8 Ryans in accidents, and more were lost during the Japanese advance through the NEI. During January 1942 as the NEI war situation worsened, the MLD Naval Flying School decided to move to Australia to continue its essential work of training Dutch pilots for a future fight against the Japanese occupation. At least 37 dismantled Ryans were loaded on the Dutch cargo ship MS Tjinegara which left Sourabaya Naval Air Station in Java on 17 February 1942 bound for Australia. Also shipped was a stock of Ryan spare parts which could have included damaged fuselages. Details of where the Ryans were off-loaded in Australia has not come to light, but Tjinegara arrived at Adelaide 4 March and Sydney Harbour 9 March 1942, indicating it had berthed elsewhere in the previous weeks. A small group of Ryans were off-loaded at Brisbane docks and, with outer wing panels still removed from shipping, were towed on their main wheels behind trucks in a convoy down Ipswich Road to Archerfield Aerodrome. The reporter confirms they were Dutch Ryans.\n\nFour months later the Tjinegara was sunk when torpedoed by a Japanese submarine between Brisbane and Noumea on 25 July 1942, however all crew were rescued.\n\nThe MLD Naval Flying School initially continued Dutch pilot training at RAAF bases Laverton and Point Cook near Melbourne, but it was decided that RAAF seaplane station Rathmines would bemore suitable especially for the floatplane Ryans. The MLD Ryans were flown by Dutch pilots at the RAAF Rathmines on Lake Macquarie NSW. However in the meantime the American Government agreed to assist the formation of a new Royal Netherlands Military Flying School at a USAAF airfield at Jackson, Mississippi which would train Dutch airmen scattered around the world for naval or air force flying. The MLD in Australia prepared to move to the United States and handed their aircraft over to RAAF. This was part of a military agreement that saw new Dutch aircraft being delivered by ships enroute to NEI diverted to Australia as \"refugee cargo\" being taken over by USAAF and RAAF. Types included Vought Sikorsky Kingfisher, P-38 Lightning, P-39 Airacobra, P-40 Kittyhawk, A-20 Boston, Brewster Buffalo.\n\nHans de Vries was a 17 year old schoolboy living with his parents in Java when he started flying lessos in Tiger Moths. When war broke out he was promptly co-opted by the MLD as a Cadet Flying Officer. He later recalled:\n\n\"In February 1942 we escaped by ship from the Dutch East Indies to Australia, docking at Fremantle, Western Australia. I was lucky as, from the three ships that started out, two got torpedoed and only one made it to Australia. The Netherlands Naval Air Force personnel were located at Lake Macquarie NSW where for two months we continued our flying training, on the water, and we were issued RAAF uniforms. We flew the Ryan STM on floats. The Ryan was a nice plane to fly and without the \"slippers\" could do stunts.\n\nIn April 1942 the Netherlands Navy Air Service contingent were transferred to the USA as training facilities in Australia were very scarce and the RAAF cadets were transferred for training to Canada. In the USA we reverted to our own Dutch uniforms when off-duty and were trained by American instructors at a number of different bases. As a unit we were integrated with the US Army Air Force and known as the Royal Netherlands Military Flying School, and the Dutch Navy and Army Air Forces were combined in one unit.\"\n\nThis page from a Dutch pilot's personal logbook confirms that MLD Ryan floatplanes were flown by Dutch pilots at RAAF Rathmines during March and April 1942. S-35, S-43, S-46 & S-55 are logged. Interestingly S-43 did not come on RAAF strength. Also of note is\n\nthe departure date from Soerabaja (Sourabaya) of 19 February 1942 on MS Tjinegara along with the Ryans. This is at variance with\n\nDutch military historical records, which quote the ship sailing on 17 February 1942. John Hopton Collection.\n\nRyan in MLD camouflage and markings, at a RAAF station early 1942. RAAF Museum\n\nAfter initial use by Dutch pilots in Australia, the 34 Ryan STMs were taken over by RAAF under the type designator Ryan Trainer and allocated RAAF serials A50-1 to A50-34. At least three other airframes were held in reserve as part of the spares sent to Australia. They were received by the RAAF in poor condition and in May or June 1942 the first 28 were despatched to Qantas Empire Airways at Rose Bay flying boat base, Sydney, the remaining 6 to Australian National Airways (ANA) at Mascot Aerodrome, Sydney for preparation for delivery to RAAF units.\n\nThe STM-S2 floatplanes had their floats removed and conventional landplane undercarriage installed. All Ryans operated by RAAF were landplanes. There were delays in their delivery from the civil contractors due to lack of parts, particularly tail wheel assemblies. Some aircraft were completed by Butler Air Transport, who also carried out other work on Ryans at their Mascot hangar, including applying RAAF camouflage paintwork.\n\nThe RAAF Ryan Trainers were in fact not used for pilot training but mostly communications and general flying duties, as shown in the individual aircraft histories listed below. Most were retired during 1944 and stored pending disposal. Towards the end of the war, discussions took place to determine payment for the Dutch aircraft and other assets taken over in Australia in 1942 by US and Australian military forces. In August 1945 agreement was reached between the Netherlands and Australian Governments, for training aircraft, which were covered in the following terms:\n\n\"34 Ryan aircraft at 70% of cost price £85,000 Australian Pounds\n\n29 spare engines at 70% of cost £11,600\n\nSpare parts at 50% of cost £3,700 : Total £100,300\n\n6 Tiger Moths, one Link Trainer, spare parts and tools acquired by RAAF - no charge.\"\n\nShort S23 Empire VH-ADU Camilla at Rose Bay flying boat base, Sydney in 1942.

John Hopton Collection\n\nCivil disposal:\n\nThe Ryan ST-Ms were among the first RAAF types made available to the newly-formed Commonwealth Disposals Commission early in 1945. 23 Ryans and 16 spare 150hp Menasco C-4S Menasco Pirate engines were on the first CDC aircraft list, tenders closing on 20 February 1945. A tender from Brown & Dureau Pty Ltd, Melbourne was accepted on 9 March 1945 for the complete RAAF inventory of Ryan airframes, Menasco engines and spares. The majority were stored at RAAF Evans Head, where a number of aircraft were damaged the following month by a cyclone, which caused a hangar to collapse. The damaged and unserviceable Ryans were dismantled and sent to Melbourne by rail.\n\nMr. Norman Adam, Manager Brown & Dureau Aviation Division wrote to DCA on 12 April 1945 referring to the storm damage: \"we have been advised that nine Ryans were damaged by the storm which destroyed the hangar in which they were housed at RAAF Station Evans Head. Three have only minor damage but the remaining six sustained substantial damage and will probably only be used for parts:\n\nMinor damage: A50-17, 29, 14\n\nMajor damage: A50-18, 23, 24, 25, 30, 34.\"\n\nBrown & Dureau Ltd was an established aviation agency, which had imported all Australian Lockheed airliners pre-war and the early RAAF orders for Lockheed Hudsons. The company held agencies with a number of overseas aircraft manufacturers as well as a wide range of aviation parts and accessories. B&D set up its own factory in Melbourne to manufacture aero engine spark plugs under licence, hundreds of thousands being delivered to RAAF and USAAF during the war. The company planned to enter the post-war civil aviation field and decided that the RAAF Ryans would be a good starting point. They established the Brown & Dureau Aircraft Service Depot on Belmont Common airfield at Geelong Victoria, to specialise in civil conversions of military disposals aircraft commencing with the Ryans. A variety of types followed, including Fairchild 24s which were fitted with Menasco engines from their Ryan spares stock. Chief Engineer David Bourke gained DCA approval to re-engine several Ryans with 130hp Gipsy Major engines, which were in plentiful supply from Australian wartime engine production.\n\nOn 28 November 1945 Brown & Dureau wrote to the Department of Civil Aviation, advising that they would be submitting Ryans for issue of civil Certificate of Airworthiness (CofA) \"at the rate of about one every 10 days commencing this week\". Although that rate was optimistic, they did complete 20 Ryans for the civil market over the next two years. Among the civil sales, three Ryans were ordered by Far East Flying Training School at Hong Kong fresh from civil conversion. They were shipped from Melbourne with a spare parts package and went into service as civil pilot trainers at Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong.\n\nKai Tak Airport, Hong Kong 1950: two Ryans with a Harvard and Sea Otter. Hong Kong Historical Aircraft Association\n\nBrown & Dureau later concentrated on civil conversions of former RAAF Avro Ansons before selling their maintenance operation to Chief Engineer David J. Bourke in 1948. B&D continued aircraft agencies for some years, as well as operating an aerial survey division based at Essendon Airport, Melbourne with a fleet of DH.84, DH.89, DH.90 and Beech C18S.\n\nDave Bourke took over the B&D Belmont Common hangars under new names Corio Air Engineers and Corio Air Freighters, operating Ansons. Bourkes maintenance arm CAE gained a reputation for high quality Anson civilian conversions but the business was wiped out in 1951 when the Barwon River flooded the airfield. A number of operational Ansons were written off from being submerged in flood waters for days. Dave Bourke continued to supply Ryan spare parts (including complete fuselages) for Australian civil buyers for well over the next decade. He flew Ansons for Flinders Island Airlines at Moorabbin and later worked as a ground engineer for Airland Improvements at Cootamundra NSW where he built up a Ryan STM from parts as a spare-time project over ten years, using the fuselage c/n 471: it was completed as VH-DBD.\n\nIn their new post-war civilian lives, the Australian Ryan ST-Ms were popular aero club and sports aircraft. By the 1960s the survivors were maintained by the growing vintage aircraft restoration movement, their value later soaring as genuine warbirds, some being restored in their original Netherlands East Indies Navy markings.\n\nThe Australian Civil Aircraft Register and DCA file paperwork use various presentations for Ryan ST-M2, with and without hyphen or the 2 suffix. By common usage, Australian civil Ryans are usually referred to simply as Ryan STM.\n\nFlying the Ryan:\n\nRyan owner Jeff Trappett, who flew in the RAAF The Roulettes formation display team, wrote:\n\n\"The STM is a pure delight to fly, the controls are beautifully harmonised (unlike the DHC-1 Chipmunk where harmonisation is not the best, particularly at low speed). It will fly hands-off for a long time without the need for concentration. It is a superb aerobatic machine (for its time) and is generally 10-15 knots faster than the DHC-1.The Menasco is a very smooth engine. The biggest problem with the Ryan is the ground handling. It is entirely \"twitchy\" and prone to ground loops.\"\n\nAustralian Ryan STMs presented in order of RAAF serial A50-1 to A50-34:\n\nAn additional STM imported in 2013 is listed at the end.\n\nc/n 473 STM-2 S-37, A50-1, VH-AGQ\n\n12.40 Built at San Diego, California by Ryan Aeronautical Co.\n\nSTM-2 to the order of Netherlands Navy/Marine Luchtvaart Dienst 10.12.40 First flight San Diego MLD serial S-37 Shipped to Netherlands East Indies 2.42 All available MLD Ryans were prepared for shipment to Australia ahead of the Japanese advance through NEI. 17.2.42 Shipped to Australia from Sourabaya NEI on board MS Tjinegara 7.42 Brought on RAAF charge as A50-1 Issued to Qantas Empire Airways, Sydney for assembly 13.7.42 Serviceable at 3CF ex QEA 28.8.42 Issued to Butler Air Transport, Mascot ex 3CF 1.12.42 Received 3CF ex BAT 16.12.42 Attached Nowra Station 4.1.43 Received 1EFTS ex Nowra 18.11.43 Received 2BAGS ex 1EFTS 20.12.43 Received 3AOS ex 2BAGS 4.2.45 Received 3AOS Stored Reserve, Evans Head 20.2.45 Included in Commonwealth Disposals Commission aircraft disposal list No.1.

He states that he then handed back control to the trainee pilot and accepted that the latter had control although he did not receive the usual response, \"taking over\". The trainee pilot states that he understood that the pilot-in-command continued to have control of the aircraft. The aircraft continued to fly in a wide shallow left turn at a low level and although each pilot thought that the other had control, each momentarily moved the controls to avoid an unsafe situation. Neither pilot observed that the aircraft was converging with a set of three power lines with which it ultimately collided. The wires did not break but the aircraft was flung sideways striking the ground with the port wing tip and rolling on to its back. There was no fire and the trainee pilot was able to vacate the rear cockpit unaided.

Aircraft destroyed and entirely unsalvageable. Pilot F/Sgt Clifford J. Gumbley parachuted clear without injury but passenger\n\nCpl Cameron H. Keys was struck by the wing as it passed over the fuselage and was knocked unconscious, killed. RAAF investigation found that the pilot began a dive from 3,500 feet at a speed of 130 knots and while easing out of the dive in order to commence a loop, aloud cracking noise was heard accompanied by a violent shuddering of the aircraft. The pilot eased the the pressure on the control column and closed the throttle immediately. The pilot called to Cpl Keys to jump from the aircraft using his parachute. At this time the port mainplane collapsed and both pilot and passenger ducked their heads into the cockpits as the mainplane detached and rested against the side of the fuselage then rolled over the top of the fuselage and fell away,\n\nThe aircraft immediately went into a violent inverted spin. F/Sgt Gumbley released the safety pin on his harness and was flung from the aircraft. Cpl Keys failed to release his harness and was killed instantly when the aircraft hit the ground.\n\nInspection of the wreckage found the port mainplane 1000 metres from the main wreckage and the port undercarriage 600 metres away. It was determined that the cause was a structural fault with the main anchor fitting that braced the flying wires between the wing and the undercarriage. The lug of the defective anchore fitting was retrieved for inspection by the Directorate of Technical Services.\n\nRAAF accident investigation report: \"fatigue failure of bracing wire attachment fittings led to the port wing coming adrift in flight. In this instance the undercarriage bracing wire attachment lug on the main bulkhead at fuselage frame no.2 broke completely across a short distance from the weld line attaching it to the bulkhead frame, and as the wires concerned formed part of the main lift wire system, this allowed the wing to fold upwards and backwards.\" 8.6.44 Issued 1CRD ex AGS 14.6.44 Approval given to Writeoff at salvage unit 96 Ryan N8146 c/n 457 was restored in USA reportedly with parts of c/n 463\n\nA50-12 at Schofields NSW in September 1942 while with 452 Squadron.

Jim O'Connell, who owns Dragon VH-AGC, and I repaired it to ferry status and flew it down from Jerilderie NSW where it had been located. This aircraft had a varied history and had been badly neglected until I purchased it. The aircraft was completely stripped and rebuilt. Main work required was extensive metal work repairs and fuselage renovation. Most of the repairs necessary were done to salvage ugly patch-ups from its past life.\n\nOf course all the flying surfaces were re-bagged, the interior re-upholstered and instruments replaced in both cockpits. Incredibly the aircraft has a total time of only 860 hours since new, and the engine is on its first life (400 hours since new).\"\n\n*Bristol 170 VH-SJQ ditched in Bass Strait on a cargo flight from Tasmania to Melbourne 10.5.75 Trappett was a RAAF pilot.

He was then in the RAAF. We talked Ryans and he saw my Stearman PT-13D with a 225HP Lycoming radial. As a result we began talking about a trade, the Stearman for his Ryan STM, since Jeff had two STMs. The trade was completed in 1981 and the Stearman N5047V became the first of its type to go to Australia.\n\nWhen the RyaN VH-AGR arrived at Montgomery Field in San Diego we dissembled the plane in the hangar and with help from others we restored the airplane. The Menasco C4S four cylinder inverted engine had been rebuilt in Australia so we did only cosmetic work on it.
