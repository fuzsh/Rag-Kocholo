        "text": "Airport in Nhill, Victoria\n\nNhill Airport (ICAO: YNHL) is located 1 nautical mile (1.9 km; 1.2 mi) northwest[1] of Nhill, Victoria, Australia, about four hours northwest of Melbourne. The Nhill Aviation Heritage Centre is located there.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWorld War II\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) commandeered the airfield during World War II.\n\nNo. 1 Operational Training Unit\n\nNo. 1 Operational Training Unit (1OTU) provided advanced operational flying and instruction. Formed on 22 December 1941, the unit was temporary housed at Nhill until RAAF East Sale at Sale, Victoria became available. Due to operational requirements the RAAF relocated 1OTU to RAAF Bairnsdale at Bairnsdale in June 1942.\n\nNo. 2 Air Navigation School\n\nNo. 2 Air Navigation School relocated to Nhill from RAAF Mount Gambier at Mount Gambier, South Australia in September 1941. The commanding officer was Wing Commander A.G. Carr (AFC). Airplanes used to train pilots in air navigation were Fairey Battles, Tiger Moths, Wirraways, Oxfords, Beauforts and Hudsons.\n\nRAAF Armament School\n\nOn 13 December 1943 the RAAF Armament School relocated from Hamilton to Nhill. The commanding officer was Wing Commander A.D. Garrison. Renamed as the Air Armament School on 15 January 1944 and later to the Air Armament and Gas School.\n\nProposed USAAF camp\n\nA USAAF advance flying unit camp was proposed in early 1942. Although buildings were constructed, the camp was never used.[2]\n\nPost-war\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008 the process began to create the Nhill Aviation Heritage Centre. As of 2017 it is restoring an Avro Anson and looking to purchase a CAC Wirraway.[3]\n\nEngineering heritage award\n\n[edit]\n\nNhill Aeradio and Airport received an Engineering Heritage Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.[4]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of airports in Victoria\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
