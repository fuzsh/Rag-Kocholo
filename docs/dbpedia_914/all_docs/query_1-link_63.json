        "meta_description": "Abstract This paper presents an extension of the operational consensus forecast (OCF) method, which performs a statistical correction of model output at sites followed by weighted average consensus on a daily basis. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) model forecasts are received from international centers at various temporal resolutions. As such, in order to extend the OCF methodology to hourly temporal resolution, a method is described that blends multiple models regardless of their temporal resolution. The hourly OCF approach is used to generate forecasts of 2-m air temperature, dewpoint temperature, RH, mean sea level pressure derived from the barometric pressure at the station location (QNH), along with 10-m wind speed and direction for 283 Australian sites. In comparison to a finescale hourly regional model, the hourly OCF process results in reductions in average mean square error of 47% (air temperature), 40% (dewpoint temperature), 43% (RH), 29% (QNH), 42% (wind speed), and 11% (wind direction) during February–March with slightly higher reductions in May. As part of the development of the approach, the systematic and random natures of hourly NWP forecast errors are evaluated and found to vary with forecast hour, with a diurnal modulation overlaying the normal error growth with time. The site-based statistical correction of the model forecasts is found to include simple statistical downscaling. As such, the method is found to be most appropriate for meteorological variables that vary systematically with spatial resolution.",

        "text": "b. Observational data\n\nThis study utilizes site-specific Automatic Weather Station (AWS) measurements of 2-m air temperature and dewpoint temperature, 10-m wind direction and speed, and QNH from 283 stations. Relative humidity values were derived from air temperature and dewpoint temperature observations. Although spurious observations may affect the verification and bias corrections of particular weather stations, the sites used within this study are used routinely for aviation and fire-weather forecasting. As such, systematic observation errors are likely to have been reported and the number of one-off errors is likely to be small in comparison to the overall national sample size. Therefore, extra quality control was not performed on the observational data.\n\nThis study is based on a dataset covering two 60-day periods: from 15 January 2004 to 15 March 2004 and from 1 April 2004 to 31 May 2004, including only the days that all models were present. The first 30 days in each period were used only to determine bias correction and weighting parameters; the last 30 days were used for forecast evaluation as well. With some data missing due to archival failure, we had 24 forecast days over the February–March period and 25 forecast days during May. The datasets were chosen, restricted by availability, to cover two different weather periods.\n\nDuring the April–May period there were generally 283 stations available for each variable except QNH, which had 262. The January–March period was similar apart from eight stations being unavailable during that period. A map of the station locations is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nb. Length of moving bias window\n\nOn an individual-station basis, a perfect bias correction scheme would result in zero median error and unchanged error variance. The impact of bias removal on the aggregate median error and error variance statistics was assessed using moving-window sizes of from 5 to 30 days in intervals of 5 days. The OCF BES bias correction [Eq. (1)] and weighting [Eq. (2)] strategies were applied on a station-by-station, hour-by-hour basis. Due to problems with observations and/or model data, corresponding errors were sometimes missing. To emulate an operational system, leeway was given to each bias window, allowing for three missing days. To investigate the relationship of the impact of bias correction and the spatial resolution of the NWP model, the analysis was repeated for a mesoscale (L1) and global (UK) model. QNH statistics were not generated. Station-based analysis was performed, but omitted from this report for brevity. The national statistics included represent an aggregation of the statistics from each of the individual stations that exhibit unique systematic and random errors.\n\nFigure 3a demonstrates the effect of bias window size on 2-m air temperature error statistics (DMO − observation) using median error and variance plots. The median error statistics after bias correction do not exhibit large variations with window size with similar values for windows sizes of 5–30 days. In comparison, the error variance statistics decrease as the window size increases. The initial reduction of the overall variance (using a 5-day window) reflects the overall error variance due mainly to individual stations biases. The further reduction in error variance experienced using larger window sizes was due to improved representativeness of the sample BES.\n\nWhile the reductions in error variance due to bias correction did not explicitly converge, the improvement monotonically decreased with increasing window size and was beginning to asymptote after a window size of 10 days. The reduction in error variance was more apparent in the global (UK) model (not shown) than in the mesoscale (L1) model. This reflects the larger systematic error component in the global model, related to its coarser spatial resolution and the simplicity of the downscaling method used. The findings were very similar for both dewpoint temperature and relative humidity (not shown).\n\nThe response to the bias removal procedure (for air temperature, dewpoint temperature, and relative humidity) was very similar in May (not shown) to the February–March period. While there were some variations in the median error and error variance statistics, the same bias window sizes were favored. Balancing requirements of skill, robustness to missing data, and processing time, the daily OCF window size of 30 days, allowing for 15 missing days, was found to be appropriate for the estimation of bias and weighting parameters. Bias correction of wind speed forecasts is discussed further in the next section.\n\nc. Wind speed and direction\n\nMeridional and zonal wind components are modeled directly by NWP models. These components can be combined to produce wind speed and direction forecasts. Glahn and Lowry (1972) highlighted the systematic underestimation of wind speeds when using separate regressions for wind components. As such, separate wind direction and speed bias equations were adopted.\n\nThere are two possible approaches for the bias correction of wind direction forecasts: first, bias correction of individual meridional and zonal wind components and second, bias correction of wind direction forecasts where wind direction errors are defined as the angle between the forecast and observed wind vectors. Bias correction was found to not be beneficial to wind direction forecasts using either approach; the latter was selected for further evaluation.\n\nWind speed on the other hand seemed to benefit from bias correction (Fig. 3b), with the improvement (due to bias correction) still increasing with a window size of 30 days. There was some variation of error statistics with forecast hour for all wind speed statistics (Fig. 3b). When viewing the subset of wind errors when the observed wind is above 5 m s−1, while bearing in mind the smaller sample size, there are biases remaining (Fig. 3c).\n\nFurther investigation into the relationship between the DMO forecast and the observed values was performed for all variables, using contour–scatterplots such as the one shown in Fig. 4. Plots for variables such as air and dewpoint temperature revealed that errors were only weakly dependent on the forecast value; these plots are not shown here. Some nonlinear characteristics were observed near the observational limit of the AWS instruments. In contrast, wind speed DMO errors were found to have a dependence on observed wind strength (Fig. 4).\n\nWeak wind speeds and directions are hard to both measure and predict. Figure 4a highlights the existence of two separate regimes, with a concentration of values along the forecast axis where the observed wind speed is around 0 m s−1. Given that these forecasts were from a 1200 UTC base time, a 6-h forecast corresponds to approximately 0400 LT (in the Australian region). The concentration of forecast–observation pairs indicates an inability to forecast still environments overnight, with corresponding forecasts varying from weak to strong winds. This may be due to the greater importance of localized small-scale processes, such as inversions, under these conditions. Although the DMO forecasts had problems with predicting extremely weak winds throughout the whole forecast period, weak winds occurred more often over the nighttime period.\n\nAWS anemometers have wind speed sensors that have a starting threshold of approximately 1 m s−1 (Potts et al. 1997). While the starting threshold of the anemometer wind speeds would contribute to the separate regimes, in particular the concentration on the 0 m s−1 observed axis, the observations would still correspond to weak winds. The corresponding forecasts, which are generally stronger than the possible 1 m s−1 observations, indicate deficiencies in the modeling and/or downscaling procedures that contribute to nonlinear characteristics of the wind speed errors.\n\nAnother important characteristic of wind speed forecast errors is the linear dependence on the forecast (or observed value). A cutoff wind speed of 5 m s−1, below which forecasters consider winds to be weak, is displayed in the plots in Fig. 4. The mean forecast for each observed value (the dotted line in Fig. 4) revealed that DMO forecasts tend to overpredict weak winds and underpredict strong winds. While instances of strong observed wind speeds are of importance to applications such as aviation forecasting, they are not well represented in the error statistics due to less frequent occurrence.\n\nGiven the complex nature of wind speed DMO errors, a bias correction scheme based upon constant (scalar) values representing all forecast values (section 3b) does not work well for these forecasts. Use of this type of approach will result in a residual bias for the least represented, but potentially more important, strong wind speeds. Future work will address this issue.\n\nb. Performance of blending scheme\n\n“Blended” hourly forecasts were produced, along with a naïvely interpolated forecast (where consensus forecasts are interpolated between fencepost hours by cubic spline functions). These were both compared against each other and the original “unblended” forecasts (where consensus forecasts are based on all forecasts available at a particular hour with no regard to consistency). The performance of the blending algorithm was investigated on three levels: exploratory analysis of the effect on single forecast runs (for specific stations), the impact on error statistics of specific stations, and the impact on the national error statistics over both the February–March and May periods.\n\nComparisons of national aggregate blended and unblended forecast statistics are displayed in Fig. 7. Sharp decreases in unblended MSE statistics (dash–dot line) at fencepost hours reflect the increase in consensus size. Blended forecast error variances (heavy black line) were more consistent across the forecasting period, similar to the uncorrected L1 model (dashed line). They were generally lower than, or of similar magnitude to, unblended forecasts. The interpolated forecasts (heavy gray line) had behavior specific to the meteorological variables.\n\nBlended forecasts outperformed both the unblended and interpolated forecasts for both air temperature and relative humidity. This reflected the inability of interpolation to reconstruct the diurnal cycle. Six-hourly forecasts sample the diurnal cycle with only four points. This is at the Nyquist limit for signal reconstruction. As a result, the interpolated forecasts dampened the diurnal cycle. Hence, the placements of fencepost hours had varied impacts on specific times during the day, as well as specific locations. There were forecast hours where the interpolated forecast performed very poorly, while at other times of day it outperformed the blended forecast for some variables. In comparison with the interpolated forecasts, the blending processes resulted in a reduction in average MSEs of 24% (air temperature) and 13% (RH) during February–March with slightly higher reductions in May (Table 3, column 2).\n\nThe blended wind speed forecasts outperformed the unblended forecasts, but the interpolated forecasts sometimes performed better (Fig. 7d). Even though finescale (mesoscale) models attempt to simulate hourly variability, the more constant interpolated forecasts verify better in some cases, especially in regard to the (implicit) timing of wind speed changes, which are hard to predict. In these cases, the mesoscale forecasts are penalized for timing (phase) errors. While smoother forecasts may verify more favorably, their usefulness to forecasters is questionable. This is especially true when events such as fronts are passing through. A mistimed event may be of more use than a missed one to an operational forecaster, as a kind of “heads up.” Interpolated wind speed forecast errors exhibited much more variability across the forecasting period, indicating that blended forecasts may be more reliable.\n\nThe statistics based solely on the occasions that the observed wind strength was above 5 m s−1 indicated that the interpolated wind speed forecasts outperformed the blended forecasts in general, with an average reduction in MSE of −10% over May (Table 3, column 2).\n\nLittle was gained by performing the blending procedure in comparison to a naïve interpolation for dewpoint temperature in May (0% average reduction in MSE). The interpolated forecast was often quite close to the blended forecast. This reflects the fact that dewpoint temperature generally has a smaller diurnal cycle than air temperature or relative humidity (Table 3, column 2).\n\nThe QNH consensus was composed solely of nested locally produced finescale models. Blending showed minor increases in skill accordingly. Improvement in QNH as a result of the blending process was due to the L1 and L3 QNH forecasts having a temporal resolution of 3 h.\n\nOverall, wind direction forecasts were not greatly enhanced by the addition of the international models (Fig. 5e; Table 2, column 3). This was reflected in the minor differences in skill (both positive and negative) attributable to the blending process (Fig. 7e; Table 3, column 1). When analyzing the subset of wind direction forecasts corresponding to strong observed wind strength (Table 2, column 3), the slightly more favorable response to the larger ensemble was seen (Table 3, column 1). In the later forecast hours, where the additional models appeared to have the best effect, the blending showed more skill. In the earlier periods, the blending both enhanced and degraded the forecast errors depending on the actual forecast hour (and month). Larger mean reductions in the MSE due to blending (in comparison with not blending) were experienced for wind direction forecasts when the observed wind strength was greater than 5 m s−1 (Table 3).\n\nWhile the blending algorithm helped with the consistency of error variance across forecast hours, the blended forecast error variances were still slightly more variable than those of a single model (such as L1), across forecast hours. Despite this, the comparative mean percentage reduction in MSE between blended forecasts and uncorrected L1 forecasts was above 40% for all meteorological variables except QNH and wind direction.\n\nIn summary, although the blending scheme achieved the aim of producing self-consistent forecasts, the accuracy of any particular feature was not guaranteed. The blending process resulted in more consistent error variances across forecast hours. Given the simplicity of the blending approach, the increase in the consistency of the hourly OCF forecasts was quite substantial in comparison with the unblended forecasts. The blended forecasts showed more skill than did the interpolated forecasts for air temperature and relative humidity, and QNH. There was little gained over a naïve interpolation for dewpoint temperature. Hourly OCF outperformed the hourly (uncorrected) L1 forecasts currently available in regional offices."
