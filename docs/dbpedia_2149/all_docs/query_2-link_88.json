        "text": "One of the few American films directed by a woman to be theatrically released in the early 1970s, Barbara Loden’s Wanda offers an authentic, verité-style vision of middle America. A former model and actress who appeared in a handful of her husband Elia Kazan’s productions, Loden’s directorial debut is considered one of the greatest indie films ever made. (102 mins., 35mm)\n\nIn Winter’s Bone, Jennifer Lawrence plays a tough-as-nails young woman forced to care for her younger siblings, her mentally ill mother, and criminal father. When her father disappears, she learns he has put their house up as bond, sending her into the meth underworld of the Ozark Mountains to bring him back. Winner of the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Film at the Sundance Film Festival. (100 mins., 35mm)\n\nWanda print courtesy of the UCLA Film & Television Archive."
