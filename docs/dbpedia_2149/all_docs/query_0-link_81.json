Began Sunday night … Oooo, that Thomas is even more despicable … Previous 3 seasons I rushed to buy the DVD as soon as it was available, half-way through the season. This time I feel like watching each episode as it unfolds. No need to purchase … Update, Feb. 15: It got better! Purchased DVD (on sale) this week\n\nInto the Woods, 2014 – Regal Cinemas, 801 C Street, downtown Vancouver … an actual THEATER! … It’s been YEARS! … Fri, Jan 9, 5:45 pm … Girls Night Out! … our 1st, Sally’s brainstorm … Sally Demos, Wendy Clark, Amanda Brown, Jaki King, Julie Austad … 4:45 pm, Brickhouse Bar and Grill, Main and Mill Plain … love the easy to get around and park downtown ‘Couv vs. Portland across the bridge … And the movie wasn’t bad! … Did I take advantage of the senior discount?

Also out of place in The Sea Hawk, 1940, with Errol Flynn. Maybe that’s it, she’s not Olivia de Havilland.\n\nChapter Two, 1979 – Marsha Mason, James Caan – TCM, Fri, Jan 16, 7:00 pm – rewatch … Couldn’t finish … “A widower risks his heart when he’s drawn to a young actress.” … Neil Simon script …\n\nOnly When I Laugh, 1981 – Marsha Mason, Kristy McNichol, James Coco – TCM, Fri, Jan 16, 9:15 pm – rewatch … Couldn’t finish … “An alcoholic actress fights to come back while trying to raise her teen daughter.” … Neil Simon script …\n\nMan in the Saddle, 1951 – Randolph Scott – YouTube, Fri, Jan 16, 2:00 am – rewatch, 1st half … First movie I saw after installed Comcast last July … Was it as good as I remembered?
