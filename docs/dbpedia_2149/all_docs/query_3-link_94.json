        "text": "Now that the nominations for the 89th annual Academy Awards have been announced, I’m taking a moment to reflect on my favorite category: Best Supporting Actress. The Academy added awards for supporting actress (and actor) in 1936, nearly a decade after they began, and for eighty years the category has been flexible enough to accommodate bright newcomers (Tatum O’Neal, the youngest competitive Oscar winner for Paper Moon, Kate Hudson in Almost Famous, and Lupita Nyong’o for 12 Years a Slave); veteran stage stars (Peggy Ashcroft, the category’s oldest winner for A Passage to India, Gloria Stuart in Titanic, and Helen Hayes in Airport; and the nearly unclassifiable (Linda Hunt’s mesmerizing performance as a man in The Year of Living Dangerously.) It’s found room to acknowledge glorified cameos like Beatrice Straight’s five-minutes in Network, as well as screen dominating star turns. On Broadway, characters played by Catherine Zeta-Jones in Chicago) and Jennifer Hudson in Dreamgirls were deemed leading roles. In their film versions, they were positioned in this presumably less competitive category—and won. Something similar is going on this year. Viola Davis won Broadway’s Tony Award for best leading actress in Fences six years ago. Now, in the softer Best Supporting Actress circle, she’s the shoo-in to take home the statuette for the same role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving each won twice, Shelley Winters (The Diary of Anne Frank and A Patch of Blue) and Dianne Wiest (Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway) sit tall among all the actresses in this group. But for me, the undisputed Queen of Supporting Actresses is the redoubtable Thelma Ritter. She made every movie she appeared in better (just watch her cut through Eve Harrington’s elaborate charade in All About Eve as she delivered zingers like “This bed looks like a dead animal act,” while surveying a pile of fur coats), and while she never won, she holds the record for most nominations—six, count ‘em six—in this category.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite all the celebrated women who have passed through this category, Oscar has ignored nearly as many worthy performances. So in honor of the late, great Thelma, here’s a completely biased list of a baker’s dozen supporting actresses who fully deserved—but didn’t get—Oscar love. Share your own overlooked favorites, and good luck on February 26th to this year’s nominees, Viola Davis, Naomie Harris, Nicole Kidman, Octavia Spencer, and Michelle Williams.\n\n1. Beulah Bondi, Make Way for Tomorrow (1937). As one half of an elderly couple who lose their home and are forced to live apart with various less-than-welcoming children, Bondi (only in her 40s at the time) is heartbreaking in Leo McCarey’s Depression-era family drama. She and husband Victor Moore spend a magical day exploring New York City before he boards a train for a new home with a daughter in California and she moves to a nursing home. Their farewell, knowing that this will be the last time they see each other, is one of the most wrenching of all cinema fadeouts.\n\n2. Mary Boland, The Women (1939). “L’amour, l’amour,” indeed! Boland’s luxuriously loony serial matrimonialist, the Countess DeLave, steals every scene she’s in. That’s saying something considering the competition from Rosalind Russell, Joan Crawford, and a slew of Hollywood’s golden era female stars and bit players. Boland’s daffy dowager is so definitive that Agnes Moorehead and Bette Midler in later remakes can’t touch it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Gladys George, The Hard Way (1943). George enlivened lots of films during the 1930s and 40s, like this women’s melodrama starring Joan Leslie as a young woman pushed to theatrical stardom by her driven older sister, Ida Lupino. George plays a past-her-prime musical comedy soubrette just vain— and thirsty—enough to fall for Lupino’s flattery and flowing cocktails to the point where she returns to rehearsal too drunk to function. She exits the show in high dudgeon, thus leaving her role for Leslie to fill. It sounds like a sketch from the old Carol Burnett show, but George gives this foolish woman a touch of battered dignity and just a flash of recognition that she’s been set up by Lupino.\n\n4. Joan Blondell, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945). Blondell only got one Oscar nomination, for 1951’s seldom seen The Blue Veil, but she gave nothing but award-worthy performances her whole career. (Just for fun, check out her juicy cameo as “Lady Fingers” in 1965’s The Cincinnati Kid, where she cuts Steve McQueen, Edward G. Robinson, and Karl Malden down to size on her way to the ladies’ room!) As Aunt Sissy in Elia Kazan’s beautiful film of Betty Smith’s novel, she’s a Brooklyn earth mother. Less a free-spirited hedonist than in the book, Blondell’s Sissy still has a spirited sexuality that, mixed with maternal warmth and wisdom, makes her the film’s vibrant life force.\n\n5. Mary Astor, Act of Violence (1948). After playing the ultimate femme fatale in The Maltese Falcon, Astor retreated to the security of an MGM contract and mother roles. Just before playing Marmie in the studio’s remake of Little Women, Astor let ‘er rip in Fred Zinneman’s film noir, Act of Violence. She was startlingly squalid as an aging prostitute who helpfully puts Van Heflin in touch with a hit man, bringing both toughness and pathos to what could have been a clichéd whore-with-a-heart-of-gold role. Brava Mary!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Miriam Hopkins, The Heiress (1949). Hopkins was a prestige star of the 1930s, but her star a dropped in the following decade, and she moved with little fuss into character parts. As the coquettish Aunt Lavinia she displayed all the romantic shrewdness lacked by her niece, the painfully shy and plain Catherine, in William Wyler’s film version of the Ruth and Augustus Geotz play, The Heiress, suggested by Henry James’ novel, Washington Square. It was a small but flashy role, and Hopkins wrung every ounce of juice out of it. Hopkins extended a middle finger to Hollywood by touring in the play the following year—as Catherine!\n\n7. Ann Dvorak, A Life of Her Own (1950). Dvorak was one of the great, unsung players of Hollywood’s studio era. She gave Bette Davis a run for her money when it came to go-to-hell intensity and was fearless in unleashing her sexuality in a series of pre-Code Warner Bros. films. (Check out her coke-snorting mom in Three on a Match.) As an aging fashion model too indolent and frightened of the future to resume her career, she wiped the floor with the film’s star, Lana Turner. Arriving at her modeling agency with chic bravado, she soon collapses into a pile of insecurities, begging for another chance and darkly hinting at the destructive behaviors that brought her down. It’s a two minute tour de force. She’s riveting in her brief scenes, like a train wreck in real time, and when she exits a half hour in, she takes all the air with her and A Life of Her Own never recovers.\n\n8. Agnes Moorehead, The Revolt of Mamie Stover (1956). Brought to films by Orson Welles as part of his Mercury Players (her first film was Citizen Kane) Moorehead quickly became one of the industry’s busiest character actresses and eventually earned four Oscar nominations. The Revolt of Mamie Stover was far from Moorehead’s finest film. But as the tough owner of a Honolulu clip joint (read whorehouse) on the eve of World War II, she’s a startlingly provocative boss lady. Sporting a blonde wig and a figure sleeker than that of star Jane Russell, Moorhead’s definitely has it goin’ on and gives the cliché role more variety and nuance than it deserves. An extended scene in which she offers to give Russell a large stake in her business is an object lesson in charging superficial material with urgency and just-under-the-surface pathos.\n\n9. Barbara Loden, Splendor in the Grass (1961). Loden worked her way up from Copacabana dancer to Actors Studio member, and had already worked once for Elia Kazan in Wild River (1960) before he cast her the next year as Warren Beatty’s sister in Kazan’s Splendor in the Grass. (She and Kazan later married.) Loden’s Ginny looks like she’s practically suffocating in the 1920s Kansas flatlands. Restless and emotionally needy, she’s the flip side of the carefree flappers Clara Bow played during this period. Her affairs with bootleggers and her heavy drinking give her little joy, and seem designed to infuriate her overbearing father, played by Pat Hingle. The film’s saddest moment is Ginny matter-of-factly giving in to a New Year’s Eve gang bang as if it were her last night on earth. Loden dives into the role with not a trace of actressy vanity, and in only a handful of scenes makes Ginny a tragic prohibition-era figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Dyan Cannon, The Last of Sheila (1973). Stephen Sondheim and Anthony Perkins’s overly complicated whodunit, directed by Herbert Ross, suffers from “blah” casting and is never as deliciously nasty or funny as it wants to be. The live wire in the cast is Dyan Cannon as a bulldozing Hollywood talent agent patterned after bulldozing Hollywood talent agent Sue Mengers. Sondheim and Perkins give her the sharpest lines (“My mouth is so dry, you could shoot Laurence of Arabia in it.”) and the most dramatic set pieces (she’s nearly cut to pieces when caught near a cruise ship’s motor while floating in the water). She even gets a brief moment of self-reflection about her route to the top of the agent game. It’s not a deep performance, but it’s loads of fun, and the best thing in the film.\n\n11. Sandy Dennis, Another Woman (1988). Dennis won in this category two decades earlier for Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? She hadn’t been in a film in several years when she turned up in a cameo role in this underrated Woody Allen effort. As an actress briefly reunited with her former friend, played by Gena Rowlands (another performance snubbed by Oscar), Dennis was the center of an excruciating scene. Slightly drunk, she confronts the super in-control Rowlands with the real reason for their estrangement, dredging up long-ago betrayals and forcing Rowlands to confront some nasty truths about herself. Allen holds the camera tight on the two women as Dennis keeps punching. She’s messy and maudlin, and makes the brief scene deeply unsettling for Rowlands and the audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Courtney Love, The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). Love was promoted for the Best Actress category, but maybe the producers should have tried the Viola Davis strategy and pushed her for supporting recognition. She’s that good as Flynt’s wife, Althea Leasure, a former stripper who helps run his Hustler magazine empire, develops a serious drug addiction, contracts AIDS, and later drowns in her bathtub. Like Barbra Streisand, Diana Ross, and Bette Midler (sorry, Madonna), Love was a singer who proved to be a powerhouse in front of the camera. Her performance was equal parts scabrous and lyrical, and she gave off real movie star heat. She’s never had another role anywhere near as good, which makes it sadder that she didn’t get some Oscar love.\n\n13. Bette Midler, Then She Found Me (2008). Midler is sometimes criticized for going all “Divine Miss M,” regardless of the role. But as an Oprahesque TV talk show host reunited with the daughter she gave up for adoption 39 years ago, she tones it down in a performance with welcome shadings of sensitivity and maternal concern. The character is self-centered and outrageous (at one point insisting that her daughter’s baby daddy is actor Steve McQueen) and Midler gives it her trademark oomph. But under the direction of star Helen Hunt, she also plays with discipline and control, and reminds us that she can be an actress of real power. If the film had had more than a cursory release in 2008, it might have reminded the Academy, too."
