The film received almost universally laudatory reviews – including one from the Los Angeles Times noting that she and costar Michael Higgins “deserve to be remembered in the next year’s Oscar® race.”\r\n\r\nVisit the AFI Catalog to learn more about WANDA.\r\nHave Get The Picture delivered to your inbox every day.",
