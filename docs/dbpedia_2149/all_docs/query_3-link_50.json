        "text": "Early life\n\nThe daughter of Jack Dennis, a salesman for a bakery and a railway clerk, and Yvonne (née Hudson) Dennis, Sandy Dennis grew up in Kenesaw and Lincoln, Nebraska. As early as elementary school, she began acting in and directing plays and skits. Dennis continued acting during high school and at the Lincoln Community Theater. After brief stints as a student at Nebraska Wesleyan University and the University of Nebraska, she moved to New York City at age 19 to pursue acting professionally. In New York she studied acting with Lee Grant and Herbert Berghof at HB Studio.\n\nFilm and stage career\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nDennis hit her stride during the 1960s, making her film debut in Splendor in the Grass (1961) and then winning Tony Awards for her Broadway roles as a social worker in A Thousand Clowns in 1963 and as the unconventional mistress of a tycoon in Any Wednesday in 1964. As the wife of the young college professor played by George Segal, she more than holds her own with Hollywood heavyweights Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in the emotional slug fest that is Mike Nichols’s 1966 film version of Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Her memorable performance earned her an Oscar for best supporting actress. She also gained critical acclaim for her convincing performance as an idealistic schoolteacher recruited to a tough New York City school in the film Up the Down Staircase (1967), winning the Moscow International Film Festival prize for best actress.\n\nDennis’s screen roles were mostly solemn ones, including the unstable women she portrayed in two Robert Altman films: That Cold Day in the Park (1969) and Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982). In Sweet November (1968), Dennis starred as a woman dying from an incurable disease, and in The Four Seasons (1981), she played a woman whose husband betrays her for a younger lover. She was at her comedic best opposite Jack Lemmon in Neil Simon’s dark urban comedy The Out-of-Towners (1970)."
