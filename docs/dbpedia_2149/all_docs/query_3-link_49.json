        "text": "Post by pacinoyes on\n\nI wasn't sure where to put this but I figured movies take up most of our thoughts and the Polls section seemed to limiting to elaborate.\n\nWho is the actor or actress you think has distinguished themselves the most across these all - usually an actor can't serve all of them with some of them suffering. But I think this is going to be an important thing for actors and the public for the future since film and TV are blurring anyway and many young actors seem excited to be back in theater (Gyllenhaal, Cooper, etc.)\n\nFor me, it's clearly Laurence Olivier for males who did it at a time when TV was far more limited too (and I know you may think his movie work is dated, but I don't agree). Certainly his stage work is staggering, much of his better and successful on film work is actually in TV (5 Emmy's, including a definitive Lear), and he's of course at 10 Oscar nominations so he had an extremely distinguished film career of 40+ years.\n\nThere's other contenders here, but none I think that served all 3 medium as evenly as him:\n\nRylance (monumental actor but still limited by amount in 2 of the 3 fields), Pacino (closer but he would really need to deservedly win a 3rd Emmy AND maybe even a 2nd Oscar to build a better case) are ahead of the next group - Spacey/Finney/Plummer etc. but Olivier just has so much quality work. If you go for the other British actors in the Olivier-era (Guinness, Gielgud, etc.) they're not equivalent to him stature-wise anyway. Olivier really was something else and all these years later I think it's almost inconceivable to us looking back to understand what he did.\n\nActress is really where it gets interesting to me because you have someone so far out in front in film acclaim (Streep) and she has dabbled in theater to some acclaim and TV too (2 (deserved) Emmy's) so she may tilt the scales so much in film as to win by default in the overall. But then again.......there's Lange/Mirren/Redgrave/Page who served all 3 deeper.\n\nWho is missing for females historically or is that more a clear case (I consider Huppert the greatest film actress but for these purposes I can't rank her #1 here even though she does theater, etc.)?\n\nPost by stephen on\n\nYeah good picks and Scott is an interesting one - he's up there for Americans with Jason Robards to me in some ways.\n\nLike I consider Scott to be the most talented American actor of the 60s in a certain kind of way - usually in that decade people love Newman, some love Beatty, some McQueen and I love them too - but everyone's looking for a star actor and he was weirder - sort of a character actor/star hybrid.\n\nAnatomy Of A Murder-Patton is a pretty stellar run (including The Hustler, Dr. Strangelove, Flim-Flam Man)\n\nHey now, you can't just leave out The Hospital like that!\n\nBut yeah, George C. Scott really does deserve more love. It also provokes an interesting discussion about actors who feel like forerunners/antecedents to other actors. Scott, to me, feels like Lee J. Cobb come again, and it's interesting that Scott wound up taking on two of Cobb's key roles later in life (Lt. Kinderman and Juror #3) and doing quite well with them. It's a shame we never saw Scott play Willy Loman, which was one of my favorite Cobb performances.\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nYeah good picks and Scott is an interesting one - he's up there for Americans with Jason Robards to me in some ways.\n\nLike I consider Scott to be the most talented American actor of the 60s in a certain kind of way - usually in that decade people love Newman, some love Beatty, some McQueen and I love them too - but everyone's looking for a star actor and he was weirder - sort of a character actor/star hybrid.\n\nAnatomy Of A Murder-Patton is a pretty stellar run (including The Hustler, Dr. Strangelove, Flim-Flam Man)\n\nHey now, you can't just leave out The Hospital like that!\n\nBut yeah, George C.

He had a pretty magnificent run of about 12 years, from Anatomy Of A Murder up until The Hospital. It was pretty standard for him in the early 70's to be named alongside Brando as the greatest working American actor. But his drop-off was damned steep, and there was no recovery. He eventually became a TV level actor, at a time when that was not regarded as a potentially good thing.\n\nCompare Scott to another great American actor with a burly physique and boxers mug, Gene Hackman. He managed to stay consistent and relevant for over 30 years before bowing out, but that prevented him from being as marginal as Scott sometimes is percieved to be.\n\nI mean, some people of a certain generation in the industry still hold Scott up as a gold standard in American acting (I believe Scott Rudin said in an interview last year that he regards Marlon Brando, Denzel Washington and George C Scott to be the three greatest American actors of all-time). But Rudin is probably rare to put Scott on that pedastal, and it may be a generational thing. A lot of actors under 40 may not even have any idea who George C Scott is or was.\n\nPost by stephen on\n\nHey now, you can't just leave out The Hospital like that!\n\nBut yeah, George C.

Scott has an iconic performance under his belt in Patton, to the point that when people think of Patton, they think of Scott's portrayal rather than the real man, but while he had an insane run in the films from 1959-1971, he seemed far more at home on the stage, and I think he probably eschewed a lot of movie opportunities in favor of that. And yes, he probably wound up losing possible job offers to Hackman, who was the same basic type yet was younger, fiercer, and more willing to \"play ball.\"\n\nPost by Viced on\n\nI think the marginalisation of George C Scott, legacy -wise shows the importance of consistency.

I listened to Paul Schrader's audio commentary on Hardcore recently and some of the things he said about old Georgey are just insane.\n\nHere's a sample:\n\n“And of course he had a drinking problem,” Schrader says about his star. Scott’s contract had five break days built in for “alcoholic problems” in case they were needed.\n\nSchrader’s first meeting with Scott was a bust when the actor didn’t show up, but a tip led the director to a particular bar in search of him. “George came out, and he was just wearing his undershorts, and he saw me in the distance and says ‘Where’s that cocksucker who thinks he can direct?’ At which point I said ‘That would be me George.’” They retrieved his clothes from the bartender and took him home.\n\nDrunken Scott sounds like the opposite of the life of the party. Their first alcohol-fueled meeting led the actor to ask Schrader why he’d hire “someone with a face as ugly as this.” It went on for a while, “and at one point a shotgun comes out” as Scott verbalized a wish to shoot himself or his father.\n\nmore here\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nI think the marginalisation of George C Scott, legacy -wise shows the importance of consistency.

If anything, it increased his cache as a serious artist, much like it does for DDL or Brando and his Littlefeather stunt. He was in demand and he probably turned down much better stuff than he took. One look at his IMDB, and it's clear that most of his choices post Patton/The Hospital stunk. Unless you are some crazy George C Scott completist, there's hardly a film of note that you'd go out of your way to track down (maybe Taps, but that's because of the novelty of a future generation of stars as kids in Sean Penn and Tom Cruise) before he drifts off in made for TV-land.\n\nPost by stephen on\n\nI don't think Scott's sociability or lack of it factored much in his decline.

Nobody wants to work with an asshole if they can help it, and it sounds like his reputation spread pretty quick. Even with Brando, he became notoriously tough to work with, but he also became pretty selective in taking on parts, and directors knew how to use him. I think a lot of the plum movie roles simply dried up for him.\n\nI would argue he still had good work post-1971. A lot of his TV work (his Scrooge is terrific, his works with Jack Lemmon stand mighty), his Percival McLeach is an underrated Disney villain (in one of my favorite Disney flicks, no less!), and Hardcore is pretty strong work.\n\nPost by Javi on\n\nVanessa Redgrave is hard to beat. An incredible career on stage with immense critical acclaim from a very early age. She also won a Tony in the US I believe.\n\nOn TV, she gave what's possibly the greatest female performance of that medium, in 1980's Playing for Time (for which she won the Emmy). She won another one for If These Walls Could Talk 2 in 2000.\n\nOn film, she may be the greatest supporting actress of all-time. From Julia to Howards End to Coriolanus... you name it. Won the Oscar in 1977. Her career as a leading actress was probably derailed by her politics but that says more about the stupidity of Hollywood producers than about her acting. Even so, she has 4 Oscar nominations for leading roles, plus unnominated work in iconoclastic classics like The Devils and stuff like Agatha, Wetherby, etc.\n\nShe's done everything from British New Wave to Shakespeare to box-office hits to hardcore auteur stuff. I don't think any of her contemporaries can touch her. Certainly not Judi Dench who had a thin filmography until recently, and while Maggie Smith has had success across all mediums she's more limited/conventional in the movies she chooses. Only Julie Christie has a more interesting filmography than Redgrave but Christie did very little theatre work so she can't compete.\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nNobody has mentioned Alec Guinness, who I think was probably superior to Laurence Olivier (his generational rival) on Film and TV, though he wasn't honored as much as Larry (he still won a lot though, so can't feel too sorry for old Alec). Olivier may have won Emmys for his TV work (which Guinness never did), but none of his TV work was ever as impactful as Guinness' portrayals of George Smiley in Tinker Tailor, Soldier Spy and Smiley's People.\n\nGuinness is obviously a legendary stage actor as well, though Olivier was more acclaimed. Without having seen either on stage, I wouldn't be suprised if Guinness was the better stage actor of the two either. Guinness seemed like an actor more likely to bring a naturalism to the stage that would be even more appreciated by theatre audiences today, than Olivier's skillfully mannered theatrics (which obviously went down a treat in his day, but might strike some theatregoers today as a bit hamfisted).\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nI mentioned Guinness in the opening post but it's nice to see mention of his George Smiley indeed.\n\nYes you did. Just looked back and saw it. Bit of a throwaway mention, but you're forgiven\n\nI do disagree with your initial statement somewhat that Guinness wasn't equivalent to Olivier stature wise. Olivier was more decorated in their lifetime, but Guinness Guardian obituary in 2000 when he died was pretty succint;\n\n\"The best known and loved English actor of the 20th century, Sir Alec Guinnesss who has died age 86\"\n\nThat statement may be arguable, but it's a very bold claim indeed from one of the major British newspapers.\n\nGieguld and Richardson have not really endured that much in public memory despite being considered stage titans comparable to Olivier in their era, because they never had the film careers to match. The likes of James Mason may have have indelible film careers, but lack of stage acclaim kept them from being comparable to Olivier. At the end of it, Guinness was Olivier's only true British peer, across all mediums. He's still a name widely admired today in the British acting fraternity (maybe moreso than Olivier, whose style can be considered a bit more divisive). Olivier may still have slightly more prestige today (particularly since his estate had the clever notion to allow Britain's main stage awards to name themselves after him), but Guinness today is pretty much up there.\n\nThe Old Vic Theatre did a Poll Of the Greatest British Actor in 2005. Anthony Hopkins won it, Olivier was in 2nd, and Guinness was in 4th. So Olivier and Guinness seemed to stay fairly close legacy wise, despite Olivier getting much more acclaim in theor liefetimes.\n\nPost by stephen on\n\nI mentioned Guinness in the opening post but it's nice to see mention of his George Smiley indeed.\n\nYes you did.

Olivier didn't really have anything quite on that level in terms of pop culture resonance (even with his Shakespeare works). Ironically, the role that Guinness probably loathed more than any other of his is the one that cemented him as the most beloved actor of his generation."
