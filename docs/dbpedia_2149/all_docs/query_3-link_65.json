        "text": "The 1966 TV broadcast of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie, part of the CBS Playhouse series, airs on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) December 8 at 8 PM (ET).\n\nThis adaptation of the Williams play was directed by Michael Elliot and had been considered lost for decades before being unearthed by a researcher.\n\nShirley Booth, the late actor best known for her long-running TV sitcom Hazel, stars in the role of faded Southern belle Amanda. Booth, who boasted a lengthy Broadway resume, was awarded three Tony Awards, for her performances in Goodbye, My Fancy; Come Back, Little Sheba; and The Time of the Cuckoo.\n\nBooth is joined in the TV production by Hal Holbrook as Tom, Barbara Loden as Laura, and Pat Hingle as the Gentleman Caller.\n\nGlass Menagerie, according to TCM, is Williams' “play about restless young warehouse worker and would-be poet, Tom Wingfield, his fragile, reclusive sister, Laura, and his colorful but overbearing mother, Amanda, all living together in a shabby apartment in St. Louis during the Depression and struggling to dilute the grim realities of daily living by way of memories, fantasies, and grandiose dreams about the future.”\n\nThe award-winning drama will return to Broadway in February 2017, starring two-time Academy Award winner Sally Field and two-time Tony Award winner Joe Mantello, at the Belasco Theatre.\n\nClick here for more information about the TCM broadcast."
