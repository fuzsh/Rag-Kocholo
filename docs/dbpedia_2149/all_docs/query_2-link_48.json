        "text": "Few women had the opportunity to direct and release their films theatrically in the ‘70s and ‘80s. But the ones who did, even briefly, blazed the trail for future female directors.\n\nIn the underseen WANDA from 1970, Barbara Loden wrote, directed, co-produced, and starred in what is considered to be one of the best independent American films ever made. Loden has been likened to the “female John Cassavettes” with her improvisational, directorial style. In this class, we’ll learn about Loden’s all-too brief career and the cultural impact her film still has today. Join us as we discuss and explore gender roles and the universal truth for understanding.\n\nThis course will be presented by Jenny Lee whose previous MMU classes include Wong Kar Wai, Yasujiro Ozu, Satyajit Ray and the Maysles documentary Salesman. Jenny Lee is a 2024 Oregon Literary Arts Fellow in Drama.\n\nClass size will be limited to 18.\n\nEmail us at education@moviemadness.org if you have any questions.\n\nIn general, the Hollywood Theatre does not provide content advisories about the subject matter shown in our theatre. Films exhibited don’t necessarily reflect the views of the Hollywood Theatre.
