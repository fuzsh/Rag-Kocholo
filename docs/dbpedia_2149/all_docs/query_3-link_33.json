        "text": "THE arc of the actress and filmmaker Barbara Loden’s life was dramatic enough to be a Hollywood movie. She survived a hardscrabble Southern childhood; moved at 16 to New York, where she was a pin-up model and nightclub dancer; then went on to win a Tony award, marry the director Elia Kazan, and in 1970, write, direct and star in her own film — the bracingly realist “Wanda” — before dying of cancer 10 years later at 48.\n\nYet her inner journey, from a girl with little to leverage but her looks and seductiveness to an artist with an urgent story to tell, was no doubt even more complicated. When “Wanda,” a portrait of a passive, disconnected coal miner’s wife who attaches herself to a petty crook, came out, Ms. Loden described it as partly autobiographical.\n\n“I used to be a lot like that,” she told The Los Angeles Times in 1971, adding: “I had no identity of my own. I just became whatever I thought people wanted me to become.”\n\nThe cinematographer and editor of the film, Nicholas T. Proferes, who also had an on and off romantic relationship with Ms. Loden, said this month in a telephone interview that she was driven by a desire to overcome her past and was fierce about becoming an artist. She fully inhabited her character in “Wanda,” he said, “because it was her story.”\n\nWith the film, which would ultimately be the only one she ever directed, Ms. Loden succeeded in leaving her past as eye candy far behind. Although some feminists objected to its central character’s weakness and victimization, other critics praised the film for its grittiness, the deeply authentic performances by Ms. Loden and her co-star, Michael Higgins, and the portrayal of a woman struggling, with almost no resources, to survive. After Ms. Loden’s death, the film was shown in France, where it attracted many admirers, including Marguerite Duras. In the United States the release of a DVD in 2006 brought the film to a somewhat wider audience.\n\nIt is about to get more attention with a full restoration from the 16-millimeter original that may be truer visually to Ms. Loden’s and Mr. Proferes’s intentions than any previous version. The restored version, the work of the UCLA Film & Television Archive, with support from Gucci and the Film Foundation, will be screened on Thursday in Venice and on Oct. 27 at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan.\n\nMs. Loden recalled her childhood as bleak and emotionally impoverished. She was born in 1932 in a small town in North Carolina. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother worked in another town, so she was raised by her maternal grandparents, whom she described as religious and not affectionate. In interviews over the years she described spending time as a child hiding behind the kitchen stove, wondering who she was and what she was doing there.\n\nShe came to New York and found work modeling and dancing at the Copacabana. In the early 1950s she married Larry Joachim, who worked in television and got her a job as a scantily dressed sidekick on “The Ernie Kovacs Show,” on which she would get pies thrown in her face or pretend to be sawed in half.\n\nThrough a friend at the Copacabana she started acting classes with the Method teacher Paul Mann that she later saw as the beginning of her intellectual development. He required his students to read the newspaper and certain books, and he pushed Ms. Loden to delve into her background and understand how it had shaped her.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was Mr. Kazan, who was 23 years her senior. She sought him out, either at a party or a rerecording session for his 1957 film “A Face in the Crowd,” depending on the version of the story, and they began an intense affair. In his memoir, published in 1988, he wrote about her with a mix of affection and patronization, emphasizing her sexuality and her backcountry feistiness.\n\nHe gave her a small part in “Wild River” (1960), and then a larger role in “Splendor in the Grass” (1961), as Warren Beatty’s rebellious, sexually promiscuous sister. When he and Robert Whitehead selected Arthur Miller’s new play, “After the Fall,” as the first production of Lincoln Center Theater, which they were founding, he cast her as Maggie, a thinly veiled version of Mr. Miller’s former wife, Marilyn Monroe. Her performance as Maggie, which ranged from childlike to feral, won her a Tony award in 1964.\n\nDespite the acclaim, she accepted few roles after that. In later interviews she said she wasn’t interested in the parts she was offered. By then she also had two young sons: one, Leo, by Mr. Kazan, and another, Marco, by Mr. Joachim. In the late 1960s Ms. Loden divorced Mr. Joachim and married Mr. Kazan, whose first wife had died in 1963. They would remain married, although with periods of estrangement, until the end of her life.\n\nMs. Loden got the inspiration for “Wanda” from a newspaper article about a woman who was convicted of being an accomplice in a bank robbery and who, when the judge sentenced her to 20 years in prison, thanked him. “That’s what struck me: Why would this girl feel glad to be put away?” she told an interviewer in 1974.\n\nMr. Kazan would later claim that he wrote the original script. At first, “it was like a favor I was doing for her, to give her something to do,” he said with characteristic condescension in an interview shortly after her death. Then she rewrote it many times, and it became hers, he said.\n\nMr. Proferes said that Mr. Kazan had suggested that he be the cinematographer, based on work he had done with the documentary filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker.\n\n“He said, ‘Can you work with a woman?’ ” Mr. Proferes recalled. “And I didn’t see any reason why I couldn’t.”\n\nMs. Loden made “Wanda” on a budget of $115,000, put up by an eccentric entrepreneur named Harry Shuster. Aside from Mr. Higgins, she used mostly nonprofessional actors.\n\nThe style of the film could not have been more different from Mr. Kazan’s style of psychological melodrama. In contrast to Ms. Loden’s hypersexualized performances in “Splendor in the Grass” and “After the Fall,” her performance in “Wanda” is understated.\n\n“She has such control,” the actress Isabelle Huppert, who released a DVD of \"Wanda\" in France in 2004, said of Ms. Loden’s directing. “For a first film it’s so amazing.”\n\nMs. Huppert said she saw Wanda’s attachment to the petty crook, Mr. Dennis, as a metaphor for Ms. Loden’s relationship to the movie world and to Mr. Kazan. “It was almost like the character could be a metaphor for her as an actress, or her as a filmmaker, being tied to the movie business and this man,” she said.\n\nLike her character, who is rejected by society, Ms. Loden ultimately found most doors in the film business closed to her.\n\nMr. Proferes said the initial response to “Wanda” was empowering. “She felt stronger about herself, more self-sufficient, that maybe she could go out on her own,” meaning possibly leave Mr. Kazan, he said. But although she and Mr. Proferes wrote several other screenplays, they were unable to get financing to make them. Then, in the late 1970s, she learned she had breast cancer.\n\nIn 1980, shortly before her death, she was interviewed for a German television documentary. She didn’t mention that she was ill but spoke about her work and how she hoped that it expressed something about the world she came from. After they left New York, the filmmakers learned she had died. In the last scene, Mr. Mann reads a letter from her.\n\n“There’s so much I didn’t achieve, but I tried to be independent and to create my own way,” she wrote. “Otherwise, I would have become like Wanda, all my life just floating around.”"
