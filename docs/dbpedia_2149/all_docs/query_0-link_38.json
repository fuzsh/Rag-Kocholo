        "text": "DeLillo Events of Interest\n\nThis page lists events that may be of interest to DeLillo readers.\n\nLast updated: 28-MAY-2024\n\nPast Events\n\nDeLillo and Auster in 2007. Photo by Andreas Brown\n\nApril 30, 2024 - Fellow author and friend of DeLillo, Paul Auster passed today at age 77. More details here: Paul Auster, Guardian obit, Forward obit. Note that Auster dedicated his 1992 novel Leviathan to DeLillo. See also the Nov. 1, 2012 and Nov. 29, 2011 event entries below. Published May 28, DeLillo provides a short remembrance of Auster, as part of a 'Tribute to Paul Auster' on LitHub along with pieces from Auster's wife Siri Hustvedt, JM Coetzee and others.\n\nPaul and I were the best of friends for many years. Walking, talking, traveling—from this distance it seems nonstop.\n\nOctober, 2023 - Publication of the second Don DeLillo volume from the Library of America, No. 374 edited by Mark Osteen. More details here: Mao II & Underworld.\n\nFeb. 3, 2023 - On February 3, a freight train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio involved 20 cars worth of hazardous materials. I'll let People magazine tell the tale, from the article by Johnny Dodd on Feb. 13 \"Ohio Train Derailment Evacuee Is Living a Real-Life Version of the Disaster Movie He Appeared in as an Extra\" (and do note the man's name!)\n\nOne of those chemicals was vinyl chloride, a toxic flammable gas. And shortly after the derailment, a massive fire erupted, sending enormous clouds of pitch-black smoke into the air, forcing evacuations on both sides of the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.\n\nTwo days later officials were so fearful that the rail cars filled with vinyl chloride would explode, potentially sending shrapnel over a mile-wide radius, that they vented the chemical into a trench and burned it.\n\nThis \"airborne toxic event\" and the related \"waterborne toxic event\" may have some continuing side effects. This CNN report \"CDC team studying health impacts of Ohio train derailment fell ill during investigation\" from March 31, 2023 says \"Because the investigators’ symptoms improved soon after they left the area, the incident was not reported to the public, the official said\".\n\nThe New York Times Book Review - Cover 2023-Jan-01\n\nJan. 1, 2023 - Dana Spiotta's appreciation of White Noise, \"Something In the Air\" gets front cover billing in the New York Times Book Review.\n\nWhite Noise is often reductively described as a satire of American consumer culture. And while of course it is satirical, I would argue that it is more deeply alchemic. When DeLillo notices and listens to the world, he arranges its \"codes and messages\" and transforms chaotic overload into forms that give us meaning and beauty.\n\nDec. 30, 2022 - Streaming of the White Noise film on Netflix begins.\n\nNov. 25, 2022 - Theater screenings of the White Noise film began, first in NYC (Angelika Film Center) and later in other parts of the US.\n\nNov 8, 2022 - Publication of Don DeLillo's Three Novels of the 1980s, Library of America #365 including The Names, White Noise and Libra, edited by Mark Osteen. More details here: Don DeLillo: Three Novels.\n\nLibrary of America's inaugural DeLillo volume also includes two hard-to-find essays directly related to the novels: \"American Blood,\" the 1983 Rolling Stone article that was DeLillo’s first effort to grapple with the JFK assassination, and \"Silhouette City,\" an assessment of extremist right-wing groups and the troubling presence of neo-Nazism in the United States. DeLillo joins Wendell Berry, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Gary Snyder as the only living writers in the Library of America series.\n\nTom LeClair wrote a retrospective piece on the Three Novels, published Nov. 6, 2022 at Open Letters Review. Here's his take on The Names:\n\nThe Names more resembles a Jamesian international novel such as The Ambassadors that relies on leisurely pace, long dialogues, and, paradoxically, linguistic texture to imply what language cannot express.\n\nCompared to the painterly surfaces of The Names, White Noise and Libra are like long-playing recordings of American speech, scrupulous aural artifacts but not the richly composed art of their predecessor. Very early in the novel, when Axton, the employee of a multinational corporation, first arrives in Greece, he says, \"Americans used to come to places like this to write and paint and study, to find deeper textures. Now we do business.\" During Axton’s quest, he meets an informant named Vosdanik, a model for the changing Axton and the author: \"Vosdanik was involved in the textures of place, in histories, rituals, dialects, eye and skin color, bearing and stance, endless sets of identifying traits.\"\n\nSept. 30, 2022 - New York City - the White Noise film opened the 60th New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.\n\nAugust 31, 2022 - Venice, Italy - the White Noise film opened the 79th Venice Film Festival, in the in the Sala Grande at the Palazzo del Cinema.\n\nMarch 28, 2021 - The 92nd St Y presents an online video showing of the October 3, 2019 reading of 'Pafko at the Wall' (on the anniversary of the \"shot heard 'round the world\") - details here: Don DeLillo's 'Pafko at the Wall'. The reading was performed by Billy Crudup, Zachary Levi and Tony Shalhoub.\n\nOctober 20, 2020 - Release date for the new DeLillo novella The Silence (128 pages) from Scribner (as per Amazon listing). Thanks to Rich, long-time friend of the site for the news.\n\nThe Angel Esmeralda opera\n\nFebruary 24 - March 2, 2020 - A new opera based on a DeLillo story will play at the Silk Street Theater in London, with booking details here: \"The Angel Esmeralda\" world premiere. Composed by Guildhall alumnus Lliam Paterson – Former Scottish Opera Emerging Artist Composer in Residence – this new opera is based on Don DeLillo’s captivating short story.\n\nDecember 2019 - 2023? - The slow then fast ramp-up of global pandemic Covid-19. New York City initially had the worst outbreak in the United States in Spring of 2020. As of 2022 it's become endemic in the U.S. By late 2022, China veered away from the zero-Covid approach, and was rather on the \"let 'er rip\" pandemic plan. U.S. deaths attributed to Covid still running about 1500/week in March 2023.\n\nOctober 3, 2019 - The 92nd St Y presents a reading of 'Pafko at the Wall' (on the anniversary of the \"shot heard 'round the world\") - details here: Don DeLillo's 'Pafko at the Wall' - A Literary Performance.

More details and tickets available here at Coronet site.\n\nSept 25, 2018 - DeLillo attended the memorial for Philip Roth at the New York Public Library, as reported in the AP story by Hillel Italie: Friends and fellow writers pay tribute at Roth memorial, dated Sept 26.\n\nPlayers, Mao II, The Names - Photo by Christophe Raynaud de Lage\n\nJuly 7-9, 11-13, 2018 - A grandiose adaptation using DeLillo's novels Players, Mao II, and The Names to examine terrorism is being staged by Julien Gosselin as part of the Avignon Festival in France, details and pictures here: Avignon Festival - Players, Mao II, The Names in France. The production runs 10(!) hours long, includes filmed segments, and got a nice writeup from the Financial Times in \"DeLillo at Avignon\" by Matt Trueman.\n\n\"The precision required by the staging's live-film format means it never lets loose, despite a throbbing dance score, but it's brilliantly conceived, impeccably acted and, thanks to Jérémie Bernaert and Pierre Martin’s crack cinematography, gorgeously executed.\"\n\nApril 19, 2018 - Don DeLillo read at the International Fiction Now conference honoring author Robert Coover, held on the Brown University campus in Providence, RI. Other visiting authors during the three day festival included Paul Auster, Richard Powers, Siri Hustvedt, Marlon James and more!

Also some interesting comments about Ratner's Star - Don said that while it was realistic to have a 14-year-old math genius, he was no literary genius (so perhaps the book was not all he'd hoped for).\n\nNovember 8, 2016 - Donald Trump wins U.S. Presidential election.\n\nNovember 5, 2016 - Don DeLillo appearing in Austin, TX for the Texas Book Festival, in conversation on Zero K with Noah Hawley.

Here's a bit:\n\nLooking back on his early books he sees \"an optimism and a vibrancy in my work that I’m not sure is still there. I'd like to think the sentences still hold up, page by page. But otherwise, it's a little different. Everything was ahead of me when I was 40, particularly since I started late – I didn’t publish my first novel until I was 35, I think, or even a little older. So in the 1970s, I was roaring through the decade publishing novels – five or six. And then I came to my senses with The Names and then things slowed down. And I’d like to believe the novels became more interesting, deeper, and better written from that point on. But it's hard for me – I can remember the experience of writing a novel better than I can remember the novel and the characters in it.\"\n\nMay 11, 2016 - Don DeLillo appearing with Rachel Kushner at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills, 7:30pm.

He is gracious, but recoils from joining in any dissection of his life's work. More than once he responds to being set upon with his own quotations with: \"I don't remember writing that, but I believe you.\" It reminds me of his novel Great Jones Street, when his rock star protagonist Bucky Wunderlick tells a reporter: \"Make it all up. Go home and write whatever you want and then send it out on the wires. Make it up. Whatever you write will be true.\"\n\nFebruary 17, 2016 - Don DeLillo appearing at Shakespeare & Company in Paris, France, 7pm.

Details at National Book Foundation, along with notes on the presenter, Jennifer Egan. Event at Cipriani, 55 Wall Street. Here is my transcription of DeLillo's comments:\n\nYes, I'm here to talk about myself.\n\nBooks. This is why we're here this evening.\n\nLately, I've been looking at books that stand on two long shelves in a room just down the hall from the room where I work. Early books, paperbacks every one. The first books I ever owned. And they resemble some kind of medieval plunder, old and scarred, weathered covers and sepia pages that might crumble at the touch of a human finger. I'm the human in this story, and when I lift the book from the shelf, gently, I understand again the power of memory that a book carries with it. What is there to remember? Who I was, where I was, what these books meant to me when I read them for the first time.\n\nThe House of the Dead, Dostoevsky, first Dell printing, June 1959, 50 cents.\n\nAdventures in the Skin Trade, Dylan Thomas, badly bruised copy, first printing, May 1956.\n\nCover illustration includes a woman wearing black stockings and nothing else. There are numbers scrawled in the front cover, did I write these numbers? Do I remember the naked woman more clearly than I recall the stories in the book? A Signet book, thirty five cents.\n\nWords on paper, books as objects, handheld. Each wrinkled spine bearing a title. The lives inside, authors and characters, the lives of the books themselves. Books in rooms, the one-room apartment where I used to live, and where I read the books that stand on the shelves all these years later, and where I became a writer myself. Many of these books were packed in boxes, hidden for years, maybe this is why I find myself gazing like a museum-goer, at the two long rows in the room down the hall.\n\nReflections in a Golden Eye, Carson McCullers. The margins of each page, resembling the nicotine stains on the smoker's hand back in the time when the book was written. Bantam Books, 4th printing, 1953, 25 cents.\n\nAre any of the writers of these old frail volumes still alive? I don't have to study the authors' names to think of recent departures: friends, Gil Sorrentino, and Peter Matthiesen, and Edgar Doctorow. Others I did not get to know nearly as well. Bob Stone and Jim Salter.\n\nBook - the word, a set of written, printed or blank pages, fastened along one side, and encased between protective covers. An old definition, needing to be expanded in the ectoplasmic drip of electronic devices.\n\nBut here are the shelves with the old paperbacks. Books still in their native skin. And when I visit the room, I'm not the writer who has just been snaking his way through some sentences on a sheet of paper, curled into an old typewriter. That's the guy who lives down the hall. Here I'm not the writer at all, I'm the grateful reader.\n\nThank you for this honor.\n\nTranscribed from the streamed video at http://www.nationalbook.org/ (DeLillo portion is audio only).\n\nNovember, 2015 - DeLillo is listed as a guest for the Lisbon and Estoril Film Festival, running Nov 6-15, 2015. Details at leffest.com, but it is not clear what his exact participation may be this time around (he was on the jury in 2011 & 2013).\n\nKarin Badt met up with DeLillo in Portugal and filed the report with the Huffington Post: \"A Rare Encounter with Don DeLillo\" posted Nov. 14, 2015. Here's a bit from Don:\n\n\"I did not read serious fiction early, not even as a child, when I only read books like I Escaped from Devil's Island. I did not read serious fiction until later when I discovered, in reading books like James Farrell's novels set in Chicago, that literature could be about the places where I was living. When I discovered that one could write about places I know.\"\n\nOctober 2, 2015 - DeLillo appeared as part of the New Yorker Festival in conversation with Deborah Treisman, fiction editor of The New Yorker. Event listing is here: \"Silence, Exile and Cunning\". A brief report on the event written by Katie Levingston dated October 3, 2015 for Vulture.com, \"Don DeLillo on Gun Violence, New York Life, and Writing\".\n\nJuly 21, 2015 - E.L. Doctorow passed away at age 84. George Saunders wrote a piece \"The Bravery of E.L. Doctorow\" dated July 23, 2015 for The New Yorker which harkened back to 2012 when DeLillo was one of the judges who awarded a PEN award to Doctorow, with a short quotation. See also the entry for October 23, 2012.\n\nApril 27, 2015 - DeLillo was scheduled to appear at the First Annual Gilbert Sorrentino Birthday Tribute in Brooklyn, NY. The event was hosted by former DeLillo editor Gerald Howard, and included Sam Lipsyte, Chris Sorrentino and others as well as DeLillo. Event at 7:30pm at St. Joseph's College, Tuohy Hall (245 Clinton Ave.), free.\n\nDecember 2, 2014 - DeLillo's annotated copy of Underworld was auctioned at the PEN America Center First Editions / Second Thoughts Auction at Christie's Saleroom, 20 Rockefeller Plaza, NYC. Link to the auction catalogue. The winning bid was $57K. See Underworld Annotated for more details.\n\nOctober 27, 2014 - DeLillo attended and spoke at the sixth annual Norman Mailer Center and Writers Colony Benefit Gala at the New York Public Library. He also received the Mailer Prize Lifetime Achievement, presented by Nan Graham. A short report with DeLillo photo at Page Six Writers honored at annual Norman Mailer Gala by Emily Smith on Oct. 28, 2014. Also attending: John Waters!\n\nSeptember, 2014 - News has appeared that indicates DeLillo sold his longtime residence in Yonkers. Phil Reisman, a neighbor and writer for lohud broke the news in a column dated Oct. 1, 2014, titled \"My dog once lunged at Don DeLillo\". The column may also shed some light on the origins of the DeLillo story \"Midnight in Dostoevsky\". My quick research indicates the real estate sale may have closed on Sept 11.\n\nApril 4, 2014 - DeLillo's longtime literary agent Lois Wallace passed away at age 73. She started her agency in 1974. Note that White Noise was dedicated to her. Publishers Weekly ran a short obituary dated April 14, 2014, with a quote from DeLillo:\n\nCan I think of myself as a professional writer without Lois Wallace as my representative? We were colleagues and friends for more than four decades and I learned eventually to understand what Lois was saying even when she was saying seven things simultaneously. A deep personal loss.\n\nThe New York Times noted that Wallace helped to shape both White Noise and Mao II.\n\nNovember, 2013 - DeLillo participated on the jury at the Lisbon and Estoril Film Festival, along with Paul Auster, Siri Hustvedt, Arto Lindsay and others.

Franzen asked how important meaning was to DeLillo’s writing. “Not much,” the older writer deadpanned. “I’m a writer of sentences... I don’t know where meaning comes from.” Franzen is visibly chastened by this anti-response.\n\nYou can hear the audio of the event, including a reading of parts of \"Human Moments in World War III\", at this NYPL link.\n\nOctober 23, 2012 - PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction was presented to E.L.

Here's a bit of it:\n\nBookCourt employee Anna Cory-Watson gave DeLillo a charmingly giddy introduction, pointing out that the bookshop had never hosted more people. Then DeLillo began, in a surprisingly old and phlegmy voice. But we were rapt. The huge crowed squirmed and shifted, trying to catch a glimpse; the room was becoming a sweatlodge. And of course, like every first date ever, things began to go wrong. A young woman at the front fainted and a kind of anxious, impatient concern took hold. Our whispers said, \"I hope she's OK.\" Our eyes said, \"If DeLillo freaks out and leaves because of the interruption, I swear I'll break her legs.\"\n\nFeb. 2, 2010 - Official release date of Point Omega in the U.S.\n\nDec. 31, 2009 - DeLillo appeared at a PEN event in NYC in support of Chinese dissident writer Liu Xiaobo, who was sentenced to eleven years in prison for \"inciting subversion of state power\".

Details at the UofW site here.\n\nHere's a nice blog post on DeLillo's visit to UofW at Wyoming Arts, with an excerpt below:\n\nHe also talked about living in Greece and the not-modest presence of terrorism, the representation of which took place every day with some kind of explosion on the street, sometimes within five blocks of where he was living. At the time, there were many refugees from Lebanon. There was a strong anti-American attitude. There was terrorist activity taking place in New York in the 1970s. When the events of Sept. 11 happened, the last thing on his mind was writing. Five days later, they were able to get into lower Manhattan, and he wrote an essay at that time about it.\n\nApril 25, 2009 - DeLillo received a 2009 Common Wealth Award for Literature, given by PNC Bank of Delaware. The event was held at the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington. See the Awards page for more details. Below is a shot of the 2009 award winners, in clockwise order, DeLillo, Kevin Spacey, Buzz Aldrin and Doris Kearns Goodwin.\n\nApril 6, 2009 - DeLillo participated in a celebration of the 100th birthday of Nelson Algren. The event was sponsored by the Steppenwolf Theatre and Seven Stories Press, and others who appeared include Barry Gifford and Willem Dafoe. This Chicago Tribune story \"Fighting from page to stage at Nelson Algren Live\" by Chris Jones on April 7, 2009 gives more details. A hitherto unpublished Algren story about a boxer was a highlight; here's the news on DeLillo's involvement:\n\nThe ubertext of \"Nelson Algren Live,\" a literary evening that had the great Don DeLillo happy merely to read little bits of narration, and featured the truly delicious casting of Martha Lavey as Simone de Beauvoir? Algren spent a life writing about others and kept this hitherto-unpublished story hidden, because Blackie Cavanaugh, a gaping, emotional, closed, taciturn wound, was far too much like himself.\n\nDavid Ulin filed a report on the event for the LA Times, \"Nelson Algren's legacy ebbs\" on April 26, 2009. He reports some talk about Algren at the event:\n\n\"He revealed in his writing a kind of isolation, loneliness and sadness that he had a hard time revealing in his life,\" Banks explains in the theater's ramshackle green room between the rehearsal and the performance. DeLillo agrees. \"I used to think of him alone,\" he says. \"He had friends, but he was not attached. I used to wonder what that was like.\"\n\nAs they talk, Gifford and Simon drift over, and soon they're all back-and-forthing about their favorite Algren books. DeLillo picks \"Never Come Morning\"; Banks prefers \"The Neon Wilderness,\" calling it \"a perfect book.\" Gifford splits the difference and opts for both, while Simon chooses \"The Man With the Golden Arm.\" Someone brings up \"Chicago: City on the Make,\" the 1951 \"prose poem\" that made Algren persona non grata in his own town. \"How many writers are there,\" Banks asks, \"about whom we could sit around and argue what's their best book? With him, you have four or five.\"\n\nAll this raises the question: Why hasn't Algren lingered more? Partly, Banks suggests that it has to do with the bifurcation at the heart of his work: \"The people he wrote about,\" he says, \"were different than those who read his books, which is a divide that's impossible to get around.\"\n\nMore details were at the Seven Stories Press site. Those who are wondering about the connection may want to take a look at the beginning of the first story in Algren's The Last Carousel, involving another boxer.\n\nYou can see a few minutes from the event, with a special bonus of a little bit of DeLillo reading along with Barry Gifford, at this site: https://vimeo.com/4706892 (check at about 2:40 in).\n\nOctober 23, 2008 - DeLillo spoke at a memorial held for David Foster Wallace at NYU. Others appearing included Jonathan Franzen, Mark Costello, George Saunders, Zadie Smith, Donald Antrim and editor Gerry Howard.\n\nImage grabbed from Band of Thebes blog.\n\nSome details on the event were provided in a story \"Friends and Colleagues Celebrate Foster Wallace\" by Lynn Andriani at Publishers Weekly. Another story on the event, \"Fellow authors memorialize David Foster Wallace\" by Hillel Italie on Oct. 23 (an AP story, this link to the Fox News), provides these notes on DeLillo's comments:\n\nDeLillo, whose \"Libra,\" \"Mao II\" and other dark takes on the modern psyche have been cited as influences on Wallace, praised the author for writing sentences that \"shoot rays of energy in seven directions.\" He called \"Infinite Jest\" a \"3-stage rocket to the future\" and said Wallace was a great writer, a \"brave writer.\" His death is a story of \"youth and loss,\" his writing one of hope for \"another world.\"\n\nThe January 2009 issue of Harper's Magazine has DeLillo's comments in full (about 1/3 of page 30 - a quick read at the newstand!). Here's a larger taste:\n\nEverything and More. This is the title of his book in infinity. It might also be a description of the novel Infinite Jest, his dead-serious frolic of addicted humanity. We can imagine his fiction and essays as the scroll fragments of a distant future. We already know this work as current news - writer to reader, intimately, obsessively. He did not channel his talents to narrower patterns. He wanted to be equal to the vast, babbling, spin-out sweep of contemporary culture.\n\nThere's a nice write up on the Ambiguities blog entitled \"DeLillo, DFW, and Places of Mortal Drama\" that covers some of the letters between DeLillo and Wallace that are held at the Ransom Center. Here's a taste:\n\nI wanted to see if I could find anything about DFW's thoughts on End Zone, especially after reading the chapter near the end that is clearly the ancestor of the Eschaton section of Infinite Jest, complete with a war game built on apocalypse scenarios and menacing all-caps alliances. Sure enough, in one of his first letters DFW says, \"part of a long thing I'm in the middle of has a section that I've gone back and seen owes a rather uncomfortable debt to certain exchanges between Gary Harkness and Major Staley.\"\n\nOctober 14, 2008 - DeLillo gave the Frances Steloff Lecture at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, NY at 8pm at Gannett Auditorium. Steloff founded the Gotham Book Mart in 1920, and was a native of Saratoga Springs. The event is open the public and free. DeLillo read from Falling Man and took questions. A story on the appearance, \"World-famous author gives lecture at Skidmore\" by Alex Stevenson appeared in the Skidmore News on October 17:\n\nWhen asked about his writing process, DeLillo said, \"I never know what I'm getting into - I never know the ending. I truly work sentence by sentence - the book begins to tell you where to go. You can't just plan ahead as if you were bridge building.\" DeLillo explained that, as he works, he likes to create \"a space for revelation\" in which \"the mind begins to discover things.\"\n\nAugust 24, 2008 - A performance of Don DeLillo's 'The Word for Snow' had been scheduled to take place in Kamenice nad Lipou, Czech Republic, directed by Jack McNamara, but it looks like this event did not take place - as per the Under the Linden website on 12 July 2008.\n\nJuly 16 - August 16, 2008 - A production of \"Love-Lies-Bleeding\" will be on in Melbourne, Australia.

The LA Times ran a story on the event, \"Mailer is recalled as a champion of the American novel\" on April 10, by Josh Getlin, who reports:\n\nNovelist Don DeLillo, recalling Mailer's obsessive belief in the power and mission of the American novel, described him as \"the writer in opposition, the individual who confronted power....\n\n\"Mailer was not just a voice but a force, a provocateur and, finally, a writer. He was a great novelist figuring out the world, sentence by sentence.\"\n\nWe get another report of DeLillo's appearance from an LA Times story \"Mailer remembered\" (was at: http://www.latimes.com/features/books/la-bkw-brown20apr20,0,6246751.story) by Liz Brown on April 20, 2008:\n\nDeLillo called Mailer \"not just a voice but a force\" and lifted a copy of The Naked and the Dead. A Signet paperback, 50 years old.\n\n\"75 cents,\" DeLillo said. Laughter. He continued reading the cover copy. \"14th printing. Over 2 million copies sold.\" Pause. \"Now a great motion picture,\" he intoned, and I remembered how with those old editions, the cellulose dried out and the paper stiffened and when you would bend the corner of a page to mark your place, the tip broke off in your fingers.\n\nDeLillo held up the small book. \"This is what gives a writer something to do after breakfast each morning,\" he said. \"Thank you.\"\n\nAnd then he turned and left the stage.\n\nFebruary 15 - 23, 2008 - Production of DeLillo's play Love-Lies-Bleeding in Boston, Massachusetts.

The evening was labeled \"Readings Against Torture, Arbitrary Detention & Extraordinary Rendition.\" A number of authors, including Salman Rushdie, Dave Eggers, Paul Auster and many more read from other people's work. DeLillo read one of the stories from \"Guantanamo: Honor Bound to Defend Freedom\" - a play created by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo from the 'spoken evidence' (interviews with the families of detainees at the prison). The piece is \"Dreaming of Richard\" from the interview with Jeanette Belmar. For more on the play, see this Guardian story by Brittain.\n\nI've taken the liberty of posting DeLillo's reading on the site (it's about 3 and a half minutes, 1Mb). You can also find the MP3 of the entire event at this site (DeLillo comes in at about 23 minutes, of an hour and a half total): http://nysoundposse.com/2005/11/event-state-of-emergency-110805.html\n\nOct 20 - Nov 5, 2005 - The Stone Soup Theatre Arts company of New York City presents 'Valparaiso'. The production is at Actor's Theatre Workshop, 145 West 28th Street, 3rd floor New York City. Nadine Friedman directs. See more info on the Valparaiso Productions page.\n\nSept 2-5, 2005 - DeLillo acted as 'Guest Director' of the Telluride Film Festival, participaing in festival selections and appearing at the festival. On Monday the 5th he was scheduled for a public conversation with Greil Marcus (this conversation is published in The Believer, June 2006; see Interviews for details).\n\nThe festival guide describes DeLillo as follows:\n\nThe power of the image and the presence of film culture have been consistent elements in DeLillo's fiction. That's in part due to his appreciation of great cinema. In 1988 he described in an interview the qualities he enjoyed in films by Godard, Antonioni, Fellini, Bergman, Kubrick and Howard Hawks: \"They seem to fracture reality. They find mystery in commonplace moments. They find humor in even the gravest political acts.\"\n\nIn the festival guide, DeLillo provides notes & presents three films: 'Wanda' (1971, dir. Barbara Loden); 'Spirit of the Beehive' (1973, dir. Victor Erice); and 'The Passenger' (1975, dir. Michelangelo Antonioni). The guide also notes that DeLillo is \"currently at work on a novel.\"\n\nMay 2, 2005 - An initial performance of Love-Lies-Bleeding performed at the Fulton Street Theater in Boise, Idaho, directed by Don himself. And there's a nice blog item on the event by Janet Holmes of Boise State, which explains how this happened (there's a connection through \"Game 6\" director Michael Hoffman). DeLillo apparently spent the preceding week in Boise.\n\nApril 28 - May 15, 2005 - The Garage Theatre Group of Teaneck, NJ, presents 'Valparaiso'. Details on the Valparaiso Productions page.\n\nFebruary 10, 2005 - Don DeLillo appeared at the University of Texas in Austin for a public lecture, in association with the Harry Ransom Center. Patrick Beach filed a report on the event for the Austin American-Statesman on Feb. 11, 2005, entitled \"Novelist leaves audience wanting more.\" He notes a sellout crowd of 330, and that DeLillo read from Libra and Underworld before taking some questions. From the article, a couple quotes from DeLillo on The Body Artist:\n\nThe change in prose style in The Body Artist \"was forced on me by the subject matter more than the fact that I wanted to do it consciously,\" he said. He said that slim work \"is more abstract. It deals with how we perceive time and how we may misperceive it in order to survive. In this book . . . I thought I was forced to elliptical.\"\n\nOf the book that many critics and fans found difficult to read, DeLillo said, \"The book was quite difficult to do. It's an acetic book, a very spare book and, in large part, involuntarily so.\"\n\nJanuary 22, 23, 24, 2005 - World Premiere of \"Game 6\" (script by DeLillo) at Sundance Film Festival in Utah. The film was shot in summer 2004 and directed by Michael Hoffman.\n\nJanuary 2005 - publication of Conversations with Don DeLillo, edited by Thomas DePietro, published by University Press of Mississippi. From the catalog:\n\nThroughout long profiles and conversations - ranging from 1982 to 2001 and published in The New Yorker, the Paris Review, and Rolling Stone - DeLillo parries personal inquiries. He counters with details of his work habits, his understanding of the novelists role in the world, and his sense of our media-saturated culture.\n\nNov 24 - Dec 19, 2004 - A production of The Day Room in Melbourne, Australia. Presented by Red Stitch Actors Theatre in St. Kilda, directed by Alyson Campbell. In a story in The Age, Campbell commented: \"It shows that people's grounds for accepting any given reality are very tenuous. It questions the value people place on appearance and even raises doubts about what is real.\"\n\nAugust 4, 2004 - DeLillo read at a PEN Writers event entitled \"State of Emergency\". This event took place at the Great Hall, Cooper Union, at 7 East 7th St at Third Avenue. Also at the event, among others, Paul Auster, Salman Rushdie, and Laurie Anderson. DeLillo read the Zbigniew Herbert poem \"Report from a Besieged City.\" The Village Voice ran a short report on the event, \"Heroic Restraint\" by Nick Catucci, on August 5, 2004.\n\nMay 5-23, 2004 - A production of Valparaiso in Philadelphia, PA.

Julian Barnes reports on the event in \"When Eriqui hit Parati\" in The Guardian, August 16, 2003. Here's a rather embarrassing bit on DeLillo:\n\nDon DeLillo also misread the temperature, as he admitted in his author session. \"This morning I gave a press conference. I'd never given one before, and I thought, well, press conferences always begin with a news announcement, so I said to the journalists, 'This morning America invaded Syria.' But nobody laughed, so I had to explain it was a joke.\" Given DeLillo's deadpan manner, and America's current bellicosity, the only surprise was that he was surprised they hadn't picked it for a joke. Or, more likely, they had but - given the strong anti-Americanism in Brazil - they declined to find it funny.\n\nJune 19 & 26, 2003 - The radio show \"Bookworm\" broadcast two hour-long DeLillo interviews in June. DeLillo discussed Cosmopolis on June 19, and The Body Artist on June 26. The interviews are also available online, in RealAudio format. More information at http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/bw\n\nJune 3, 2003 - DeLillo in Rome, Italy, for the Roma Festival.\n\nMay 29, 2003 - DeLillo interview on BBC Radio 3, Nightwaves program at 9:30pm London time.\n\nMay 27, 2003 - DeLillo in London, England. An event sponsored by Foyle's bookshop, the appearance is at 7pm at the Institute of Education, 20 Bedford Way, London. Tickets £8 (£6 students & OAPs). Here's a report from Arnaud Pelle:\n\nAfter gingerly crossing the stage to the pulpit under a thunder of applause he started abruptly with a brief overview of Cosmopolis and the motivations behind the novel. He then read several sections that illustrated more, as he explained later, the language and the style of the novel than the story and the characters.\n\nFrom (hopefully faithful but not necessarily orderly and certainly not complete) memory the discussion that followed included the following topics:\n\nHow the ever stretching limousine became a symbol of the 90's in New-York and how it caught people's eyes \"for about two weeks before becoming unnoticeable again to the jaded New-Yorker.\"\n\nAsked about whether the recurrent theme of the millennium present from Americana onwards was a particular focus of attention for him, Delillo replied that dates as such didn't matter and he was just guided by the historical events. He shared his observation about the shift from the cold war, which he described as an abstract threat of global destruction, to the current age of terror that targets \"you and me, on the streets, on planes, etc with its very real and palpable threat\" and how these changes have affected our lives.\n\nHe explained with a lot of humour how Eric's extravagant belongings in Cosmopolis were somehow all grounded in reality. Even for the nuclear bomber, which Delillo says he thought he had invented but found out later about someone who actually did privately own such an aircraft.\n\nGot the whole auditorium in stitches when to the question \"is Bob Dylan one of your heroes?\" he replied with deadpan humour: \"Someone from the Bronx doesn't have any heroes\" and added more seriously later that Dylan was indeed someone he admired greatly.\n\nHe dismissed any similarity between David Bell of Americana and Eric Packer of Cosmopolis claiming that it was a coincidence if they were both 28 years old and explaining why they were extremely different (Bell being under the influence of images and living in the \"third person narrative while Packer is smart, cunning, ruthless, etc.\"). Followed quite an interesting insight on how the details about the lives of the characters he creates seem to be \"dictated\" to him as he writes. Same comment applied to the length of the novels, which seems to be inherent to each book from the start.\n\nWhen asked if he was familiar and/or influenced by the works of Baudrillard at the time he was writing White Noise he replied, in a rather tongue in cheek way, \"oh yeah, I've read his name a few times.\" He dismissed any such influence on the novel, insisting that \"White Noise was merely based on observations of daily life and nothing more.\"\n\nOn the subject of whether the influence of cinema that fueled \"Americana was still as strong on his work he replied in classic Delillo style that even though there are still fantastic film makers around we now \"go to the movies to escape images.\"\n\nAs to visual art he deemed \"a legitimate observation that the reference to Rothko and pictures involving naked bodies in Cosmopolis might illustrate a stylistic shift to a more stripped form of writing.\n\nHe stressed that the creative process and the narrative approach for Underworld and Cosmopolis had been completely different. Cosmopolis was intentionally written with brisk short sentences to capture the pace that he wanted for the book and reflect the way New-Yorkers talk.\n\nDuring the signature session I asked him whether we could ever hope to see his earlier short stories published. He replied with a smile \"my publisher keeps asking me that but I haven't got enough good short stories at the moment (!!!) \"I will wait until I have written some more.\"\n\nWell, I will wait as well but not too long, please...\n\nMay 25, 2003 - DeLillo at the Hay Festival of Literature, Hay-on-Wye, UK. The site says, \"Hay is a tiny market town in the Black Mountains of the Welsh Marches. It has 1300 people and 39 bookshops.\" DeLillo is scheduled for 2:30pm on Sunday afternoon. DeLillo's talk and QA had been available (was at http://www.hayfestival.com/2004/ARCHIVE/archiveD.asp), but appears to be gone now. A short BBC Radio 4 interview was done at the festival, and a link is available on the Radio page. A story in The Guardian by Gordon Burn entitled \"After the Flood\" (Nov. 15, 2003), describes the reading:\n\nWhen Don DeLillo read from the main stage at Hay-on-Wye in May there was a Sunday afternoon audience of around 2,000 and a genuine sense of anticipation. It felt like it felt in the 60s, going to see Bob Dylan.\n\n...\n\nDeLillo's face flickered in close-up on a large screen on the stage behind him. He was wearing a Brooks Brothers button-down, a v-neck sweater, a professorial houndstooth jacket. DeLillo is 67 now, fit-looking and trim, probably a jogger. His hair is lustrous and his face is deeply pocked, possibly dating back to when he had chickenpox in the Bronx as a child.\n\nThese stray thoughts shouldn't have been intruding, but they were because, although it was a pleasure to be in the same room as Don DeLillo, and although the words he was reading were smart, beautifully put-together ones, they were just words - not words telling a story, or describing any kind of emotion, just unspooling words, abstract, drifting on the air like a piece of free-form jazz. Or - the criticism most consistently levelled at DeLillo - like the dream-language of a Cyborg; \"cold\" and \"heartless\" like a computer.\n\nApril 24, 2003 - DeLillo in Philadelphia: Free Library. Here's the recording from that appearance with QA: Don DeLillo - Cosmopolis (April 24, 2003).\n\nApril 14, 2003 - DeLillo in New York City at 7pm, at the Union Square Barnes and Noble, 33 East 17th St.\n\nMarch 25 - April 23, 2003 - A production of Valparaiso by the Sacred Fools Theater Company in Hollywood, CA. See Valparaiso Productions for full details and links.\n\nApril 11, 2003 - DeLillo in Cincinnati, at the Mercantile Library, 6pm. Here's a report courtesy Dan Johnson:\n\nHe did a reading a several passages of Cosmopolis, but he also read from a passages towards the end of \"Cocksucker Blues\" in Underworld where Klara and Miles see an illegal screening of the Zapruder film. He said he read this latter passage because we are approaching the 40th anniversary of the Kennedy assasination.\n\nHe gave a generous question and answer session. All quotes are paraphrased and keep in mind that my memory is rarely perfect. Here are a few highlights:\n\nHe said that the theme of the 90s in America was something like \"money and the growth of the internet.\" As such, Eric is a product of his times except that he's smarter than most of the people that got rich quick.\n\nHe gave a good explanation of his idea that novelists used to influence public consciousness but do not anymore. People once turned to novelists to give them a way of understanding a particular contemporary situation -- for example, people started to understand a certain situation as \"Kafka-esque.\" He noted that understanding a situation as \"Kafka-esque\" is, in a sense, a way of coping with that situation.\n\nOn what may be a related note, he said that he doesn't really want to use his fiction as a way of morally judging the present, but rather as a means of neutrally \"understanding\" it. \"I'm not a theologan,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked what he thought about the Oliver Stone film JFK, he said that his problem with the film is that Stone forced an incredibly enigmatic subject into the straight jacket of a typical Hollywood plot, the story of the hero solving the mystery and bucking the system. Sarcastically, he said, \"the Costner character begins to think that there was a conspiracy, and immediately after he has great sex with his wife.\" He added, resoundingly, \"Terrible movie.\"\n\nWhen asked why he's become less \"reclusive\" and giving more readings these days, he joked, \"how do you know I'm Don DeLillo?\" More seriously, he added, \"sometimes it's nice to meet your readers.\"\n\nHe said that with the possible exception of White Noise he doesn't think of his books as being postmodern but rather modernist. He mentioned Faulkner, Hemingway, and Joyce as examples of the sort of thing he's doing: \"It was particularly the experience of rereading Ulysses in my mid-20s that was important, although I would not want to read it again.\" People chuckled. \"No, I do not want to read it again.\"\n\nWhen asked what motivates him to write, he said nothing motivates him in the sense that nothing \"motivates\" a person to breathe.\n\nHe said that he does not speak any foreign languages very well: \"It's all I can do to speak English.\"\n\nApril 4, 2003 - DeLillo in Los Angeles: Writer's Bloc.\n\nApril 2, 2003 - DeLillo appears at the Herbst Theatre in San Francisco. The event begins at 8pm, and tickets ($18) are available from www.cityboxoffice.com or call 415 392-4400.\n\nMy report:\n\nDeLillo gave a quick introduction, telling the story of people burning themselves to death in Czechoslovakia 35 years ago, and that it happened again 2 weeks ago. Then he launched into a fairly long and strong reading from sections of Cosmopolis, with short labeled sections such as 'In the Limo.' 'Kinski,' 'The Burning Man,' etc. which seemed to go steadily forward in the book. He then answered some questions. To my mind the most interesting Q/A items were the following:\n\n1. Asked about the 'current situation' DeLillo said (paraphrasing from memory) that like everyone else he would like to see the conflict end quickly and with minimal loss of life, but that he is picking up on a sense that technology itself causes a need to use it. That the Cold War perhaps stayed 'cold' because the Americans and Russians were able to test their weapons in largely unoccupied spaces within their countries. And he noted how this war began with the 'precision strikes' on Bagdhad, in essence tests of our new technology. He sensed that there is almost a psychic pain if applied technology is not utilized.\n\n2. Asked what he would teach in a modern literature course, DeLillo mentioned that he had never taught, never liked school, and thus saw no reason to go back to it. He said he would probably try to come up with something new, but declined to mention any authors.\n\n3. Asked about 19th century literature, DeLillo talked about how he had not read much as a child, and that he really couldn't read those older works. He said he was fine with watching Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, but he didn't want to read the book!\n\n4. Asked about the future, DeLillo came back to technology, and said that he felt that it would continue to insert itself into our lives, perhaps in new and different ways than we are familiar with now.\n\nMarch 24, 2003 - DeLillo in Chicago: Steppenwolf Theater.

At 5 p.m. he read from his work in McCosh 50.\n\nGreil Marcus reported on the event in his \"Top Ten\" column (Nov. 4, 2002, item #2). Here are a couple snippets:\n\nRefusing to dramatize, letting the words carry the story, DeLillo read quietly, and the result was a dreamlike rhythm.... Later there were questions from the audience. \"What do you know about being fabulously wealthy?\" a woman asked. \"I can spell both words,\" DeLillo said.\n\nSept. 20 - Oct. 5, 2002 - The Dreamwell Theatre in Iowa City, Iowa is staging Valparaiso.
