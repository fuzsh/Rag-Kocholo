Wanda is a compassionate and wrenching portrait of a woman stranded on society’s margins.\n\nFestivals:\n\nVenice FF – International Critics Award\n\nBarbara Ann Loden (1932–1980) was an American actress and director of film and theater. Loden began her career at an early age in New York City as a commercial model and chorus-line dancer. Loden became a regular sidekick on the Ernie Kovacs Television Show. She appeared in several projects directed by her second husband, Elia Kazan, including Wild River (1960) or Splendor in the Grass (1961). She won a Tony Award for her stage role in Arthur Miller’s After the Fall (1964).\n\nIn 1970, Loden wrote, directed, and starred in Wanda, a groundbreaking independent film that won the International Critics Award at the 1970 Venice Film Festival. Throughout the 1970s, she continued to work directing Off-Broadway theater productions, as well as direct two short films. In 1978, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, of which she died two years later, aged 48."
