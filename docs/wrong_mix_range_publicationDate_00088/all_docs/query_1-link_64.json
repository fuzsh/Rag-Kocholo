        "meta_description": "This is a fresh examination of the â€˜intelligenceâ€™ gathered for the great train robbery.   The suggestion of an Irishman (â€˜The Ulstermanâ€™) was simply part of a package created by the robbers in time for their release from prison and to contribute to the subsequent book â€“ everything since has compounded the â€˜mysteryâ€™. Gordon Goody was one robber who â€˜metâ€™ The Ulsterman and speaks highly of The Ulstermanâ€™s information, but this information could easily be found elsewhere, and some of it is incorrect.   So who else might have given â€˜intelligenceâ€™? One by one, other â€˜suspectsâ€™ are identified and discounted, but with evidence for their defence.   To use the metaphor â€˜hidden in plain sightâ€™, one can identify another â€˜suspectâ€™ with all the attributes The Ulsterman was said to have. If the reader is willing to look at the evidence afresh, itâ€™s necessary to consider not what the robbers et al have said, rather what they havenâ€™t said.   The robbers were dishonest men who frequently lied â€“ but writers and commentators have followed what they have said. And it hasnâ€™t really led anywhere.   To unravel the yarn presented, it wasnâ€™t a senior official in either the Post Office or British Rail. It was an â€˜ordinary thiefâ€™ with an extraordinary ability to blend into the background, and have fingers in a great many pies.   Letâ€™s expound the myth.",
