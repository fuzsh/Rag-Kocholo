In fact, adventure comes looking for her—and finds her immediately at Hyde Park Corner tube station. Anne is present on the platform when a thin man, reeking of mothballs, loses his balance and is electrocuted on the rails.\n\nThe Scotland Yard verdict is accidental death. But Anne is not satisfied. After all, who was the man in the brown suit who examined the body? And why did he race off, leaving a cryptic message behind: \"17-122 Kilmorden Castle\"?\n\nTwisty, clever, and intriguing, The Man in the Brown Suit showcases Agatha Christie once again at her very best.\n\n# 2\n\nWe\n\n3.89\n\n99.2k ratings\n\n205k shelvings\n\nThe exhilarating dystopian novel that inspired George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadowed the worst excesses of Soviet Russia\n\nYevgeny Zamyatin's We is a powerfully inventive vision that has influenced writers from George Orwell to Ayn Rand. In a glass-enclosed city of absolute straight lines, ruled over by the all-powerful 'Benefactor', the citizens of the totalitarian society of OneState live out lives devoid of passion and creativity - until D-503, a mathematician who dreams in numbers, makes a discovery: he has an individual soul. Set in the twenty-sixth century AD, We is the classic dystopian novel and was the forerunner of works such as George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. It was suppressed for many years in Russia and remains a resounding cry for individual freedom, yet is also a powerful, exciting and vivid work of science fiction. Clarence Brown's brilliant translation is based on the corrected text of the novel, first published in Russia in 1988 after more than sixty years' suppression.\n\n4.13\n\n135k ratings\n\n197k shelvings\n\nThe Aldens begin their adventure by making a home in a boxcar. Their goal is to stay together, and in the process they find a grandfather.\n\n4.22\n\n73.9k ratings\n\n178k shelvings\n\nWhen it appeared in 1924, this work launched into the international spotlight a young and unknown poet whose writings would ignite a generation. W. S. Merwin's incomparable translation faces the original Spanish text. Now in a black-spine Classics edition with an introduction by Cristina Garcia, this book stands as an essential collection that continues to inspire lovers and poets around the world.\n\nThe most popular work by Chile's Nobel Prize-winning poet, and the subject of Pablo Larraín's acclaimed feature film Neruda starring Gael García Bernal.\n\n3.68\n\n81.3k ratings\n\n172k shelvings\n\nWhen Adela Quested and her elderly companion Mrs Moore arrive in the Indian town of Chandrapore, they quickly feel trapped by its insular and prejudiced 'Anglo-Indian' community. Determined to escape the parochial English enclave and explore the 'real India', they seek the guidance of the charming and mercurial Dr Aziz, a cultivated Indian Muslim. But a mysterious incident occurs while they are exploring the Marabar caves with Aziz, and the well-respected doctor soon finds himself at the centre of a scandal that rouses violent passions among both the British and their Indian subjects. A masterful portrait of a society in the grip of imperialism, A Passage to India compellingly depicts the fate of individuals caught between the great political and cultural conflicts of the modern world.\n\nIn his introduction, Pankaj Mishra outlines Forster's complex engagement with Indian society and culture. This edition reproduces the Abinger text and notes, and also includes four of Forster's essays on India, a chronology and further reading.\n\n4.13\n\n50.6k ratings\n\n143k shelvings\n\nIn this dizzyingly rich novel of ideas, Mann uses a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, a community devoted exclusively to sickness, as a microcosm for Europe, which in the years before 1914 was already exhibiting the first symptoms of its own terminal irrationality.\n\nThe Magic Mountain is a monumental work of erudition and irony, sexual tension and intellectual ferment, a book that pulses with life in the midst of death.\n\n3.94\n\n55.5k ratings\n\n80.5k shelvings\n\nThe Most Dangerous Game features a big-game hunter from New York who becomes shipwrecked on an isolated island in the Caribbean and is hunted by a Russian aristocrat.\n\n3.92\n\n66.2k ratings\n\n49.3k shelvings\n\nFirst there was the mystery of the film star and the diamond... then came the “suicide” that was murder... the mystery of the absurdly cheap flat...a suspicious death in a locked gun room... a million dollar bond robbery... the curse of a pharaoh’s tomb... a jewel robbery by the sea... the abduction of a prime minister... the disappearance of a banker... a phone call from a dying man... and, finally, the mystery of the missing will.\n\nWhat links these fascinating cases? Only the brilliant deductive powers of Hercule Poirot!\n\nThe short stories are: 1. The Adventure of 'The Western Star', 2. The Tragedy of Marsdon Manor, 3. The Adventure of the Cheap Flat, 4. The Mystery of Hunter's Lodge, 5. The Million Dollar Bond Robbery, 6. The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb, 7. The Jewel Robbery at the Grand Metropolitan, 8. The Kidnapped Prime Minister, 9. The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, 10. The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman, and 11. The Case of the Missing Will.\n\nLibrarian's note #1: besides the eleven above, there were three more included in the American version of the same title a year later: 12. The Chocolate Box, 13. The Veiled Lady, and 14. The Lost Mine.\n\nLibrarian's note #2: this is the entry for the collection of short stories, 'Poirot Investigates'. Entries for each of the stories are located elsewhere on Goodreads. All 14 can be found by searching Goodreads for: 'a Hercule Poirot Short Story'.\n\nLibrarian's note #3: in published order, the first 10 Christie mystery books featuring Poirot are: 1) The Mysterious Affair at Styles, 2) The Murder on the Links, 3) Poirot Investigates, 4) The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, 5) The Big Four, 6) The Mystery of the Blue Train, 7) Black Coffee: A Mystery Play in Three Acts [Charles Osborne novelized the play in 1998 under the title, Black Coffee], 8) Peril at End House, 9) Lord Edgware Dies, and 10) Murder on the Orient Express. Each has its own entry on Goodreads.\n\n4.24\n\n25.9k ratings\n\n36.2k shelvings\n\n“They're changing guard at Buckingham Palace – Christopher Robin went down with Alice.”\n\nCurl up with A.A.Milne’s classic book of poetry for children, When We Were Very Young. This is the first volume of rhymes written especially for children by Milne – as popular now as when they were first written.\n\nThis collection is a heart-warming and funny introduction to children’s poetry, offering the same sense of humour, imagination and whimsy that we’ve come to expect from Milne's favourite books about Winnie-the-Pooh, that Bear of Very Little Brain.\n\nThis book is all the more special due to E.H.Shepard’s decorations, which are shown in full, glorious colour. They are truly iconic and contributed to him being known as ‘the man who drew Pooh’.\n\nDo you own all the classic Pooh titles?\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh\n\nThe House at Pooh Corner\n\nWhen We Were Very Young\n\nNow We Are Six\n\nReturn to the Hundred Acre Wood\n\nThe Best Bear in All the World\n\nOnce There Was a Bear\n\nThe nation’s favourite teddy bear has been delighting generations of children for over 95 years. Milne’s classic children’s stories – featuring Piglet, Eeyore, Christopher Robin and, of course, Pooh himself – are gently humorous while teaching lessons about friendship and kindness.\n\nPooh ranks alongside other beloved character such as Paddington Bear, and Peter Rabbit as an essential part of our literary heritage. Whether you’re 5 or 55, Pooh is the bear for all ages.\n\n4.23\n\n15.1k ratings\n\n35.9k shelvings\n\nDickinson’s poetry is remarkable for its tightly controlled emotional and intellectual energy. The longest poem covers less than two pages. Yet in theme and tone her writing reaches for the sublime as it charts the landscape of the human soul. A true innovator, Dickinson experimented freely with conventional rhythm and meter, and often used dashes, off rhymes, and unusual metaphors—techniques that strongly influenced modern poetry. Dickinson’s idiosyncratic style, along with her deep resonance of thought and her observations about life and death, love and nature, and solitude and society, have firmly established her as one of America’s true poetic geniuses.\n\n4.1\n\n19.1k ratings\n\n35.8k shelvings\n\nThe last book published during Kafka's lifetime, A Hunger Artist (1924) explores many of the themes that were close to him: spiritual poverty, asceticism, futility, and the alienation of the modern artist.\n\nHe edited the manuscript just before his death, and these four stories are some of his best known and most powerful work, marking his maturity as a writer. In addition to \"First Sorrow,\" \"A Little Woman,\" and \"Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse People\" is the title story, \"A Hunger Artist,\" which has been called by the critic Heinz Politzer \"a perfection, a fatal fulfillment that expresses Kafka's desire for permanence.\"\n\nThe three volumes Twisted Spoon Press has published: Contemplation, A Country Doctor, and A Hunger Artist are the collections of stories that Kafka had published during his lifetime. Though each volume has its own distinctive character, they have most often appeared in English in collected editions. They are presented here as separate editions, in new translations by Kevin Blahut, each with its own illustrator from the Prague community.\n\n3.17\n\n18.2k ratings\n\n29.1k shelvings\n\nA handsome young sailor is unjustly accused of plotting mutiny in this timeless tale of the sea.\n\n--back cover\n\n4.01\n\n14.9k ratings\n\n28.8k shelvings\n\nAlthough less famous than Mikhail Bulgakov's comic hit, The Master and Margarita, The White Guard is still an engrossing book, though completely different in tone. It is set in Kiev during the Russian revolution and tells the story of the Turbin family and the war's effect on the middle-classes (not workers).\n\nThe story was not seen as politically correct, and thereby contributed to Bulgakov's lifelong troubles with the Soviet authorities. It was, however, a well-loved book, and the novel was turned into a successful play at the time of its publication in 1967.\n\n3.83\n\n8,024 ratings\n\n28.1k shelvings\n\nThe poetic style and sweeping grandeur of The King of Elfland's Daughter has made it one of the most beloved fantasy novels of our time, a masterpiece that influenced some of the greatest contemporary fantasists. The heartbreaking story of a marriage between a mortal man and an elf princess is a masterful tapestry of the fairy tale following the \"happily ever after.\""
