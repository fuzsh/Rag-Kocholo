Second draft of webfolios due. Be prepared to read aloud. Group discussions on \"How to find and develop good stories\" and \"The American Dream.\"\n\nNew York-- The Twenties versus the Nineties. Don DeLillo, Toni Morrison and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Even though they symbolize the American Dream, what are the prisons embedded in The Great Gatsby, Jazz and Cosmopolis? Is your American Dream just to be-- happy? Remember this when we get to Brave New World. In the twenties, the American Dream was Forbidden Fruit for many Americans. Langston Hughes captures this dilemma brilliantly in his poem, Harlem--\n\nWhat happens to a dream deferred?\n\nDoes it dry up\n\nLike a raisin in the sun?\n\nOr does it fester like a sore -\n\nAnd then run?\n\nDoes it stink like rotten meat?\n\nOr crust and sugar over like a syrupy sweet?\n\nMaybe it just sags like a heavy load.\n\nOr does it explode?\n\nThe following is my favorite descriptive passage from The Great Gatsby because I love the way he personifies the lawn and uses kinesthetic imagery to capture the brazen energy and grandiosity of the nouveau riche and the role the women, particular Daisy, play in this splendid charade-- \"Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walls and burning gardens--finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.\n\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggessively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage--a cruel body....\n\nWe walked through a huge hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew thorugh the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling-- and then ripple over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an achored balloon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.\" (11-12) Note the synesthesia--\"groan of a picture,\" the use of dashes to make the description dynamic, and the way these short passages show how completely Tom dominates the scene, physically, sexually, materially--but maybe not spiritually.\n\nNote how DeLillo deconstructs his journey through Manhattan. Is the author seeping in through Benito? Is this a naturalistic journey? DeLillo does not orchestrate his characters, although he is a fierce and fabulous social critic. Every word must succumb to his personal style--\n\nDeLillo simply and vividly describes his raison d'etre-- \"I am a sentence maker. Like a donut maker, only slower,\" or \"Every sentence has a truth waiting at the end of it and the writer learns how to know it when he finally gets there. On one level this truth is the swing of the sentence, the beat and poise, but down deeper it's the integrity of the writer as he matches with the language. I've always seen myself in sentences. I begin to recognize myself, word by word, as I work through a sentence. The language of my books has shaped me as a man. There's a moral force in a sentence when it comes out right. It speaks the writer's will to live....The words typed on the page have a sculptural quality. They form odd correspondences. They match up not just through meaning but through sound and look. The rhythm of a sentence will accomodate a certain number of syllables. One syllable too many, I look for another word. There's always another word that means the same thing, and if it doesn't then I'll consider altering the meaing of a sentence to keep the rhythm, the syllable beat. I'm completely willing to let language press meaning upon me. Watching the way in which words match up, keeping the balance in a sentence--these are sensuous pleasures. I type rather than write longhand because I like the way words and letters look when they come off the hammers onto the page--finished, printed and beautifully formed.\"\n\nFuturistic America-- Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. How do Huxley's predictions still apply to the world of clones and bioengineering? Have our values changed since the 1930s? Is happiness incompatible with art, science, monogamous love and family ties? What would happen if there were no death? If old age, suffering, weakness and disease were abolished, would that also mean the end of religion? If everyone were happy on earth, would we need God? What is your ideal designer baby? If you could stop aging at 50 and stay the same for the next fifty years, would you do it? What would happen if everyone did? What do you think of nursing homes and early retirement? Should people just 'hang out' for thirty years, living off the state?\n\nAt one point in most writers' careers, they tackle the unknown, ineffable and potentially blasphemous task of imagining god and personifying prophets. Like Nikos Kazantzakis, they can be a believing Christian who creates a more sensuous, tormented version of Christ tortured by temptation as he struggles with the demands of divinity. Or they can be like Aldous Huxley as he creates an alternative religion based on a distortion of science, bioengineering, and technology where people worship Our Ford instead of Our Lord. Where is god in books like The Bluest Eye, Lolita, The Sand Child, or The Patience Stone? In Saadawi's books, God often dies (or at least the personification of him or his embodiment in corrupt leaders), or resigns as in her censored play. But in God Resigns at the Summit Meeting, Eve, Bint Allah, and Isis offer humanity alternatives as female deities. Naguib Mahfouz and Salman Rushdie almost lost their lives for personifying Mohammad in Children of Gebelaawi (of the Alley) and Satanic Verses because they made him flawed--a womanizer and a hashish smoker. Where is god in books like The German Mujahid, The Kindly Ones, Night, and If This is a Man? God lets these stories be told but he also didn't stop the holocaust. In Gao Xi Jiang's Soul Mountain, God is a frog with one eye open and one blinking. Savoring the moment of falling snow is as close as we get to paradise.\n\nFor a scientific perspective on imagining god, I recommend Alan Lightman's new book Mr. G. Like Einstein's Dreams, this short novel is based on a lifetime of study as a prominent theoretical physicist and in its pithy prose poetry invites us to imagine the creation of our world, our galaxy, and an infinite number of galaxies. I met Lightman at an MIT conference in 2006 where I was invited to give a paper on the personification of particle physics in my narrators in my trilogy of novels published in 2006, now censored by the Dean. MIT was one of the few places that actually understood what I did in my novels, (London, Paris, and Tel Aviv were the others) in part because of the work Lightman has done for years as Humanities and Physics Professor and author of extraordinary compressed, brilliant prose poetry. I personally prefer longer, linguistically complex works, but Lightman is one of the few minimalist writers I adore probably because his intellect is so maximal. Even if you have no time at all because you are so busy with work and school, spend five minutes every night reading a chapter of this book and reflecting on it as you go to sleep. You will get a deeper understanding of science and religion as well as ideas to stimulate your own imagination and sense of wonder. Unlike Joyce and Rushdie, Lightman's writing is simple and clear, but it reflects the same depth of research, understanding, and knowledge, albeit in a different area. Lightman is one of the great writers of our century.\n\nLinks--1) Jihad vs McWorld-- Whose Paradise is Lost?\n\na)Jihad vs McWorld-- Only One Will Stand by Dylan Tucker\n\nb) Integrating Current Events with Twentieth Century Literature and Rhetoric-- Keefer's Course Syllabus Fall 2001\n\ni.

Course objectives are to expand our knowledge and appreciation of the style and structure of literary works, and to examine their didactic, aesthetic and entertainment values in terms of the cultural relativity of world literature.\n\nClasses are a combination of Meatspace as we bring selected reading to life through oral interpretation and performance; Deepspace as we do in-class writing on close textual analysis, subjective interactions and the relation of our unconscious, dreams, emotions etc. to the reading; and Cyberspace, investigating themes and multidisciplinary issues related to our weekly expository papers and the final research project. In addition we will design literary web sites on our chosen topics.\n\nTHEMES:\n\nAngst and Alienation: Selections from What is Literature and \"No Exit\" by Jean-Paul Sartre and\n\nPlaying in the Dark by Toni Morrison. \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" by Camus.\n\nAlienated Hells: Shoot the Kids... by Kenzaburo Oe, and News of a Kidnapping\n\nby Gabriel Garcia Marquez.\n\nAlienated Gender: God Dies by the Nile , The God of Small Things, and Things Fall Apart .\n\nGender and the Unconscious: A Room of One's Own by Virginia Woolf, \"Lethal\" by Joyce Carol Oates, Molly Bloom's soliloquy from Ulysses , and Red Azalea by Anchee Min.\n\nHeaven: Utopias and Dystopias: Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. and Mao II by Don DeLillo. \"Angels in America\" by Tony Kushner.\n\n\"The Red Detachment of Women\" and other operas from the Peking Revolutionary Opera.\n\nEinstein's Dreams. by Alan Lightman.\n\nLETHAL by Joyce Carol Oates\n\nI want to touch you a little.

Both require being mindful of the places where imagination sabotages itself, locks its own gates, pollutes its vision. Writing and reading mean being aware of the writer's notions of risk and safety, the serene achievement of, or sweaty fight for, meaning and response-ability.\n\nWhatever may be their use in civilised societies, mirrors are essential to all violent and heroic action.\n\nPoets are men who refuse to utilize language.\n\nSome say it is best not to go near the center of time. Life is a vessel of sadness, but it is noble to live life, and without time there is no life. Others disagree. They would rather have an eternity of contentment, even if that eternity were fixed and frozen, like a butterfly mounted in a case.\n\n\"Success prompts to exertion; and habit facilitates success.\" That is a man's sentence;...it was a sentence that was unsuited for a woman's use....Moreover a book is not made of sentences laid end to end, but of sentences built, if an image helps, into arcades or domes. And this shape too has been made by men out of their own needs for their own uses. There is no reason to think that the form of the epic or the poetic play suits a woman any more than the sentence suits her. The novel alone was young enough to be soft in her hands-- another reason, perhaps, why she wrote novels.\n\nThe \"engaged\" writer knows that words are actions.\n\nWriters are among the most sensitive, the most intellectually anarchic, most representative, most probing of artists. The ability of writers to imagine what is not the self, to familiarize the strange and mystify the familiar, is the test of their power. The languages they use and the social and historical context in which these languages signify are indirect and direct revelations of that power and its limitations.\n\nWhy write? Each one has his reasons: for one, art is a flight; for another, a means of conquering.\n\nOne of the chief motives of artistic creation is certainly the need of feeling that we are essential in relation to the world.\n\nAll our literature and art are for the masses of the people, and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; they are created for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use.\n\n...a great mind is androgynous. It is when this fusion takes place that the mind is fully fertilised and uses all its faculties.\n\nLike a domestic animal, time doesn't move without human beings' strict supervision.\n\nWhen the words form under his pen, the author doubtless sees them, but he does not see them as the reader does, since he knows them before writing them down. The function of his gaze is not to reveal, by stroking them, the sleeping words which are waiting to be read, but to control the sketching of the signs.\n\nWhat does death matter? Communism is the truth. Because they appear almost always in conjunction with representations of black or Africanist people who are dead, impotent, or under complete control, these images of blinding whiteness seem to function as both antidote for and meditation on the shadow that is companion to this whiteness-- a dark and abiding presence that moves the hearts and texts of American literature with fear and longing.\n\nImagine a world in which there is no time. Only images.\n\nRace has become metaphorical-- a way of referring to and disguising forces, events, classes, and expressions of social decay and economic division far more threatening to the body politic than biological \"race\" ever was.\n\nIt is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly. It is fatal for a woman to lay the least stress on any grievance; to plead even with justice any cause; in any way to speak consciously as a woman. And fatal is no figure of speech for anything written with that conscious bias is doomed to death. It ceases to be fertilised. ...Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before the act of creation can be accomplished.\n\nReading seems, in fact, to be the synthesis of perception and creation.\n\nIn this world, there are two times. There is mechanical time and there is body time. The first is as rigid and metallic as a massive pendulum of iron that swings back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. The second squirms and wriggles like a bluefish at bay. The first is unyielding, predetermined. The second makes up its mind as it goes along.... Where the two times meet, desperation. Where the two times go their separate ways, contentment. ... Each time is true but the truths are not the same.\n\nThere is no romance free of what Herman Melville called \"the power of blackness,\" especially not in a country in which there was a resident population, already black, upon which the imagination could play; through which historical, moral, metaphysical, and social fears, problems, and dichotomies could be articulated. The slave population, it could be and was assumed, offered itself up as surrogate selves for meditation on problems of human freedom, its lure and its elusiveness. This black population was available for meditations on terror-- the terror of European outcasts, their dread of failure, powerlessness, Nature without limits, natal loneliness, internal aggression, evil, sin, greed.\n\nIn order to know himself, each person carries his own Book of Life, which is filled with the history of his life. ...With time, each person's Book of Life thickens until it cannot be read in its entirety....Some have stopped reading altogether. ... Such people walk with the limber stride of their youth. Such people have learned how to live in a world without memory.\n\nI fear for you young people because you do not understand how strong is the bond of kinship. You do not know what it is to speak with one voice. And what is the result? An abominable religion has settled among you. A man can now leave his father and his brotheres. He can curse the gods of his fatheres and his ancestors, like a hunter's dog that suddenly goes mad and turns on his master.\n\nBack to Home Page\n\nBack to Self versus State"
