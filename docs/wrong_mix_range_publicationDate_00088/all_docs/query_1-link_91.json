        "text": "August 8 will be the 50th anniversary when, 16 (other sources say 15) men stole an estimated £2.6million (£45million today) from the Glasgow to London mail train at Sears Crossing in Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe driver Jack Mills was bludgeoned so severely that he never recovered from his injuries, dying seven years later. The bulk of the money was never recovered, three robbers were never found. Two, including the infamous Ronald Biggs, escaped and one of those convicted was possibly never involved – he died in prison. The standard tariff was 30 years.\n\nBiggs’s escape as well as myriad books, films and TV programmes have done nothing to diminish our lurid fascination.\n\nIn their book, Russell-Pavier and Richards set out to dismantle the myths, expose failings and shortcomings of the police and robbers, offer new revelations and provide the definitive account.\n\nAs TV writers and producers you can’t blame them for wanting a big dramatic opening.\n\nSo they have two. The first is the description of the 1962 BOAC wages heist masterminded by Gordon Goody, Charlie Wilson, Buster Edwards, Roy James and Bruce Reynolds. The second sets the scene of the gang’s next outing – the Great Train Robbery.\n\nWe start with the train leaving Scotland and cut to the thieves making their preparations, cut to the train stopping at Carlisle, cut to the robbers, cut to the train at Crewe picking up Mills and his fi reman David Whitby, cut to the robbers, cut to the train. Cut, cut, cut.\n\nWhat would work in a visual medium is simply confusing on the page. Thrown straight into the raid it is almost impossible to keep up. Part of the problem is the sheer number of people involved but the cluttered disorganised retelling doesn’t help. Apart from a couple of brief quotes from a 2009 interview with Reynolds most of the material has been cobbled together from others’ books. The authors find it hard to separate fact from rumour and mistake speculation for analysis.\n\nOne can’t escape the feeling that they harbour a sneaking admiration for the robbers. They find it “surprising”, “incredible”, “curious”, “unlikely” that police and robbers acted as they did, discredit sources and then quote them as reliable.\n\nThey pooh-pooh the claim, agreed on by all the robbers that someone was hired to clear up their hideout. Really? Surely getting 16 villains to agree on anything carries a reasonable element of reliability. There are no reference notes, just a list of films, TV shows and books. Are these sources or further reading? They claim to know what happened to the unrecovered money. Police take note.\n\nThere are however some endearingly domestic touches: in among the evidence found at the gang’s hideout were 18 tins of Senior’s pork luncheon meat, 15 tins of Fussell’s condensed milk and one box of Bachelor’s peas as well as Ludo, Snakes and Ladders and Monopoly – complete with fingerprints.\n\nNew facts are thin. The book does contain a complete previously unpublished list of police suspects but they don’t try to prove a case against any of them. Instead of getting to the truth Russell-Pavier and Richards succeed only in muddying the waters further."
