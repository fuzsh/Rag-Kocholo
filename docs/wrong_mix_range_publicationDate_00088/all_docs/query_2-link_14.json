        "text": "Fiction Book Reviews\n\nIf the speed of an aero equals zero, the aero is motionless; if human liberty is equal to zero, man does not commit any crime. That is clear. The way to rid man of criminality is to rid him of freedom.\n\nWhy Read This?\n\n“We” by Zamyatin is a thought-provoking novel that explores themes of individualism, totalitarianism, and the struggle between freedom and conformity. These themes not only mirror the repressive Soviet regime under which Zamyatin lived but continue to resonate in today’s world.\n\nAs one of the earliest dystopian novels, “We” has played a significant role in shaping the genre, inspiring iconic works like George Orwell’s “1984.” Getting familiar with this masterpiece gives valuable insight into the development and foundations of dystopian literature and encourages reflection on the ever-present and timeless concerns the novel addresses.\n\nWho is the Author?"
