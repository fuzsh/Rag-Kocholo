        "text": "It was called the crime of the century. The Great Train Robbers planned their heist pretty much flawlessly. But getting away with it was another matter. Most of the robbers got caught. Most of them leaving unanswered questions. Such as: who never got caught? And, most important: what happened to the money?\n\nPeter Guttridge, crime novelist and critic was commissioned by the National Archives in 2008 to write a short account of the August 1963 Great Train Robbery, ‘the heist of the century’, using police, court and other archives in the national collection. It remains the most objective account of the robbery and the robbers who committed it."
