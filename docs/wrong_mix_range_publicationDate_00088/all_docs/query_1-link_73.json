        "text": "Bruce Reynolds, who masterminded the Great Train Robbery, has died – just months before the 50th anniversary of the notorious raid.\n\nReynolds’s son Nick confirmed that his father died this morning aged 81 after being unwell for a few days.\n\nMr Reynolds added: ‘I really can’t talk at the moment. I can confirm that he has passed away and he died in his sleep.’\n\nHis father was the key player in the gang that held up a Royal Mail travelling post office on 8 August 1963, before making off with millions of pounds in a heist that is remembered as one of the most audacious crimes of the century.\n\nReynolds – nicknamed ‘Napoleon’ – used inside information about mail movements to plot the raid.\n\nWearing ski masks and helmets, the 15 robbers stormed onto the train and grabbed more than 100 bags of money after bringing it to a stop near Cheddington, in Buckinghamshire, by changing a signal to red.\n\nThey then made off with a haul of more than £2.5million – a record at the time and equivalent to £40million today.\n\nReynolds used a false passport flee to Mexico after the robbery and where he was joined by his family. He stayed on the run for five years but after the cash from the robbery ran out he was forced to return to England.\n\nHe was finally captured broke in Torquay in 1968, and sentenced to 25 years in jail.\n\nHe served 10 years before being released on parole but he has told how the robbery became a curse.\n\nIn his memoirs published in 1995 he wrote: ‘I became an old crook living on handouts from other old crooks.’\n\nFamily friend John Schoonraad paid tribute to Reynolds today, describing him as a ‘perfect gentleman’ and a ‘philosophical, gentle person’.\n\nHe said Reynolds told him that ‘crime doesn’t pay’, adding: ‘He’s done his time, and he turned into a very nice man. Fifty years ago they were all trying to feed their families – a get-rich-quick scheme that went wrong.’\n\nMichael Biggs, whose father Ronnie was another famous Great Train Robber, told BBC Radio 5 live that Reynolds was a ‘very intelligent man’.\n\nHe said: ‘Regardless of whatever mistakes Bruce made in his life, Bruce was a very, very kind person who was a true gentleman who made many friends in his life.’\n\nEddie Richardson, who spent time with Reynolds in prison, said: ‘He was all right. He was his own man.’\n\nTrain driver Jack Mills was hit on the head during the raid and died seven years later."
