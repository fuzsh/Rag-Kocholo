As we stand in the darkness of the morning, we remember them.

As we bow our heads, not a word is spoken. We remember them.

As the trumpet blares The Last Post, we remember them.

We remember the sons who sat in boats, unknowingly approaching disaster, as salty waves thrust them closer to the shores of Gallipoli.

We remember the brothers whose blood stained the white-sanded shores of ANZAC Cove.

We remember the fathers who lay fighting until their last breath.

We remember the husbands who never returned home.

On April 25, we remember them.

Private Claude Terrell Crowl of Stratford, 22, was among the 2000 Australian and New Zealand soldiers killed in action at ANZAC Cove on April 25, 1915.

Devastation engulfed the coast of Gallipoli for eight long months, far from the campaign’s intended objective to capture the Gallipoli peninsula, then Constantinople, quickly knocking Turkey out of the war.

As the ANZAC troops reached the shore, in what is now known as ANZAC Cove, they were about a mile north of the loosely planned landing site in steep, rugged terrain, meeting fierce resistance from the Ottoman forces.

Thousands of Australian and New Zealand fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons became separated from their units as they began moving up the tangle of complex spurs and ravines in the darkness, burning hot metal bullets cracking in the still dawn air.

Devastating artillery bombardments from the Ottoman forces proved too strong, and the ANZAC position became progressively more precarious after failing to secure their high-ground objectives.

Despite the slaughter transpiring on the Gallipoli beachfront, General Sir Ian Hamilton, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, denied the withdrawal of the ANZACs and ordered the troops to dig in.

The ANZACs remained in the same position they had taken on April 25, 1915, until their evacuation in late December 1915.

British forces completed the evacuation of Cape Helles on January 9, 1916, ending the Gallipoli campaign.

An estimated 8141 Australian soldiers were killed in action during the eight-month-long stalemate, with the Gallipoli campaign deemed a military failure.

For the vast majority of the 16,000 Australians and New Zealanders who landed at Gallipoli on April 25, it was their first experience of combat.

Of the more than 50,000 Australians who served at Gallipoli, some 18,000 were wounded, bringing home battle scars both internally and externally.

By the end of World War I, November 11, 1918, about 62,000 Australians were killed and 156,000 wounded, gassed, or taken prisoner.

Each year on April 25, Anzac Day, we commemorate, we remember, the 8141 Australian soldiers killed in action at Gallipoli, Australia’s first major action in World War I.

Since April 25, 1916, when more than 2,000 Australian and New Zealand troops marched through the streets of London, marking one year since the ANZAC’s landing at Gallipoli, we have remembered them.

Anzac Day became a national commemoration for the more than 60,000 Australians who died during World War I.

By April 25, 1927, every state observed some form of public holiday for the first time.

One hundred and eight years later, on April 25, 2023, we continue to remember them.
