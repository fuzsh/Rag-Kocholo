        "text": "Invasion History\n\nFirst Non-native North American Tidal Record: 1953\n\nFirst Non-native West Coast Tidal Record: 1961\n\nFirst Non-native East/Gulf Coast Tidal Record: 1953\n\nGeneral Invasion History:\n\nThreadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense) is native to the Mississippi and Gulf of Mexico drainages from Indiana and Illinois south to Guatemala (Page and Burr 1991). It may have been introduced to Gulf drainages east of the Mississippi River, and to the Florida peninsula in the first half of the 20th century (Fuller et al. 1999; USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program 2018). However, there is a museum specimens from the St. Johns River collected before 1877 (Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 2018). They were widely introduced as a forage fish to reservoirs in North America starting in 1950's (Carlander 1969). This was mainly due to the perceived need for a small, planktivorous prey fish to support stocked game fish in reservoirs, and some trial-and-error in matching prey and predators (Courtenay and Moyle 1989). They rapidly colonized estuaries in the southeastern US and the San Francisco Bay area, occasionally entering marine waters (Robins et al. 1986; Cohen and Carlton 1995; Dill and Cordone 1997). Tendencies for winter die-offs, 'boom and bust' population fluctuations, and unpredictable invasiveness has led to a decline in introductions in recent years (Courtenay and Moyle 1989; Jenkins and Burkhead 1993; Fuller et al. 1999).\n\nNorth American Invasion History:\n\nInvasion History on the West Coast:\n\nIn 1955 Threadfin Shad were stocked into Lake Havasu, Arizona. From there, the fish spread throughout the lower Colorado to River to the Mexican border. In 1959, they were introduced to reservoirs in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system and reached the Delta and San Francisco Bay by 1961 (Cohen and Carlton 1995; Dill and Cordone 1997). By 1967, Threadfin Shad had become one of the most abundant fishes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Dill and Cordone 1997). They have occasionally been captured in marine waters of the San Francisco Bay and adjacent coast, as far north as Yaquina Bay Oregon, and south of Long Beach (Miller 1972; Krygier et al. 1973; Lee et al. 1980; Eschmeyer et al. 1983). Additional reports have come from tributaries of Monterey Bay (Elkhorn Slough, Salinas and Pajoro Rivers) and from the Santa Clara River in Ventura County (Kukowski 1972; Yoakavich et al. 1991; USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program 2018), so it is possible that additional California rivers have been colonized.\n\nTheir population has gone through a series of peaks and crashes in the last 40 years, and dropped sharply after 2002, reaching a record low in 2012 (Feyrer et al. 2009; Latour et al. 2016). The decline of threadfin shad has been treated as part of the general phenomenon termed 'Pelagic Organism Decline', due in part to watershed modifications and the removal of phytoplankton by the invasive Asian Brackishwater Clam (Corbula amurensis) (Sommer et al. 2007; Mac Nally et al. 2010; Thomson et al. 2010). However, in a 2014 survey in the Delta, Threadfin Shad and Mississippi Silverside (Menidia audens together constituted 43% of the nekton biomass (Feyrer et al. 2016).\n\nInvasion History on the East Coast:\n\nThreadfin Shad was collected in the St. Johns River before 1877 and again in the 1940s, so it may be native in that system (Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 2018; USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program 2018). Introductions were made in the 1950s in the Altamaha River (Georgia), the Roanoke River and Back Bay-Currituck Sound (Virginia-North Carolina), the Potomac River probably in many other southeastern Atlantic states. Threadfin Shad were found in coastal waters in Georgia as early as the 1950s, and by the 1970s had been found in coastal and estuarine waters from Maryland to Florida (Lee et al. 1980; Lee et al. 1981; Jenkins and Burkhead 1993; USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program 2018). They’ve also been caught in upper Chesapeake Bay, in the Rhode River and Aberdeen (Lee et 1980; Rob Aguilar, personal communication 2012). This fish is likely to expand its range with climate change.\n\nInvasion History in Hawaii:\n\nOne source reports introductions of Threadfin Shad to the Hawaiian Islands in 1905 (Devick 1991, cited by USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program 2018), but other authors give the date as 1958 (Maciolek 1984; Randall 1987). It has become well-established in freshwater reservoirs on Oahu, Kauai, and Maui, but does not seem to have entered estuaries or marine habitats. In the Hawaiian Islands where they were established, an attempt was made in the 1960s-70s to acclimate large numbers of Threadfin shad to salt-water ponds so that they could be used as bait for the Skipjack Tuna (Euthynnus pelamis) fishery. This was unsuccessful, because this herring species did not tolerate the extensive handling involved in use as bait (Randall 1987).\n\nInvasion History Elsewhere in the World:\n\nThreadfin Shad were introduced as forage fish to reservoirs in Puerto Rico in 1963, and now are found in many reservoirs on the island USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program 2018).\n\nEcology\n\nGeneral:\n\nThreadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense) is primarily a freshwater resident, with most populations occurring in freshwater, but adults frequently disperse through estuaries and marine waters (Jones et al. 1978; Page and Burr 1991; Fuller et al. 1999). Sexes are separate. Adults mature in 1-3 years at 49-55 mm. Female fecundity ranges from 800-21,000 eggs, increasing with size. Spawning occurs twice a year, in spring and fall, at temperatures of 14 to 27 C. In the San Francisco Bay Delta, spawning occurs mostly in April and May (Wang 1986). Spawning occurs at night in fresh or 'almost fresh water', in open water, or over vegetation and coarse wood debris (Jones et al. 1978). Eggs sink and adhere to vegetation, rocks, and sticks (Wang 1986). Eggs hatch in 3 days at 27 C, or longer at lower temperatures (Jones et a1. 1978). The newly hatched yolk-sac larva is ~5 mm long and strongly elongated. The larvae are planktonic. By the time the fish reaches 25 mm, it is a juvenile approaching the adult body shape (Wang 1986).\n\nThreadfin Shad have many landlocked populations, but they are highly mobile, dispersing along rivers, entering estuaries, and dispersing along coastlines. However, they require fresh water for spawning and early development (Jones et al. 1978; Dill and Cordone 1997). Juveniles often move into brackish water, up to 15.5 PSU, but are most common in fresh and lower-salinity water. Adults have been collected at salinities of 32 PSU, probably higher (Jones et al. 1976). As a species with a warm-temperate subtropical range, populations at the northern edge of its range in reservoirs are often subject to diebacks, as in Virginia reservoirs, and the San Francisco estuary (Jenkins and Burkhead 1993; Dill and Cordone 1997). River and coastal populations can avoid low temperatures by migration. Threadfin Shad are pelagic fish, usually moving in large schools. They are planktivorous, filter-feeding on phytoplankton, copepods, and plant detritus (Murdy et al. 1997; Feyrer et al. 2003; Froese and Pauly 2018). As a small fish, low in the food chain, they have a wide range of predators. In the San Francisco estuary delta, Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis), is the major predator, but Threadifn Shad are also eaten by Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) and the native Sacramento Pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis) (Nobriga and Feyrer 2007). Likely predators in Atlantic estuaries include Striped Bass (native), Largemouth Bass and introduced Blue Catfish.\n\nFood:\n\nPhytoplankton, Zooplankton, Detritus\n\nConsumers:\n\nPredatory fishes\n\nTrophic Status:\n\nSuspension Feeder\n\nSusFed\n\nHabitats\n\nGeneral HabitatFresh (nontidal) MarshNone General HabitatGrass BedNone General HabitatNontidal FreshwaterNone General HabitatTidal Fresh MarshNone General HabitatUnstructured BottomNone General HabitatSalt-brackish marshNone Tidal RangeSubtidalNone Vertical HabitatNektonicNone\n\nTolerances and Life History Parameters\n\nMinimum Temperature (ºC)5Field Data- Winter die-offs have been reported at temperatures of 1-7 C (Jones et al. 1978).
