        "text": "The outbreak of World War I in 1914 spelled the beginning of a dark period for St Kilda.\n\nThe club entered a period of recession during 1916 and 1917, but not before changing their official colours to red, yellow and black to disassociate themselves from the colours of the German Empire.\n\nIt was also a sign of solidarity for Allied Force, Belgium, who stood with Australia and had several current and former St Kilda players fighting in their country.\n\nFourteen Saints were killed in action during the bloody war, which claimed the lives of over 40 million people.\n\nTen more Saints paid the ultimate sacrifice during World War II, including best-and-fairest Harry Comte, who fell at the Battle of Tarakan.\n\nWe pay our respects to the 286 former St Kilda footballers who served in the two world wars.\n\nLest we forget.\n\nSt Kilda Honour Roll"
