Oratrixes John B. Brake, Joseph Shreves and Elizabeth his wife and Isaac Reager and Mary Magdalene his wife which said John, Elizabeth, and Mary Magdalene are children and heirs of Jacob Brake claimed their brother Abraham Brake was fraudulent in obtaining a deed of Jacob Brake's property. Prior to his death in \"Feb.\" 1831 Jacob Brake had lived many years in the Buckhannon Settlement. Abraham W. Brake accused of being \"connected with a lewd woman\" had lived for many years with his parents. Plts. [plaintiffs] complained Abraham did not contribute to welfare of parents and was disrespective to them. Jacob Brake's wife [Mary Slaughter] died in 1830. It was claimed Abraham took advantage of his father's mental state and obtained a deed by fraud. Depositions were taken in Lorentz from Jesse Slaughter [Mary Slaughter's brother] who had known Jacob Brake about 40 yrs. Abraham Brake was the elder son of Jacob Brake. Abraham stated his father's death occurred in the year 1831 on or about 7 January abt seventy six years of age. Abraham W. Brake in his response stated he was married about 1806 and had one child, that he never left his father's residence. He lost his wife about eleven months after their marriage. Abraham stated that [from] about 1812 when his brother John married until death of their father, the respondent was the only male person who resided with their father. He stated he had to perform \"menial duties apertaining to females as well as the masculine labor of farming.\" It was understood that in consideration he was to have the home farm. He stated that the respondant's child never lived with him while he resided with his father but lived with and was maintained by their other friends. Abraham claimed his father deeded the property to him without his knowledge until completion of the transaction. Abraham Reger was mentioned as a son-in-Iaw to Jacob Brake [Abraham married Jacob's daughter, Leah Anne]. A deposition was taken from Jacob Brake's grandson Adam Shreves [Elizabeth Brake Shreve's son]. In the file, it was mentioned Jacob Brake went to Buckhannon to vote for the Constitution and this surprised his son Abraham. Jacob Brake departed life intestate and the essence of this case is that plts. claimed Abraham W. Brake deprived his siblings of equitable share of their father's property through fraud.\n\n***\n\nCensus: 1880 Upshur County lists Abraham Brake, white male, age 95, pauper, living in County Poor House.\n\n***\n\nMilitary service: According to West Virginians in the Revolution, Abraham served in the company commanded by Captain Bernion under Ensign Harrison and Lieutenant Stump.

Burial: Howes Cemetery, Lee Township, Brown County, Illinois. He married Lydia Gould 11 April 1815 in Lewis County, (West) Virginia, daughter of Aaron Gould and Lydia Gray. She was born 02 February 1794 in Charlemont, Hampshire County, Massachusetts, and died 04 January 1859 in Brown County, Illinois.

Davis d. 5 Nov 1850 age 57y10m4d. Calculated this would give his birth date as 1 January 1793, which conflicts with the typed copy of the Bible Record of E. J. Rohrbough, which gave his birth as December 31, 1791.\n\n***\n\nThe following is from a letter (January 1966) from Russell Sage Davis to Ann Noel Perkins: [George Perkins, 2007, submitter]\n\n\"Ann, the Davis branch of your family tree has been recorded for the last five generations with reasonable accuracy from family records, bible entries and published obituaries.\n\nDavis is an English name and most of it's families trace their origin in the USA to the Virginia colony; many of them to land grants from the Queen of England. The lineage is usually easily traced as far back as the Revolutionary War. But the tracing becomes difficult beyond that time. It is tradition in English law for the oldest son to inherit all his father's estate; the younger members of the family had to rustle for themselves. This tradition is the basis for much of England's colonial development. The Revolution, in fact, was a war between the younger members of the family who came to America and their elders at home. They were enemies now. This makes it difficult to couple up family ties across the Atlantic.\n\nSo far as I have been able to trace, our Davis lineage began with Joseph Davis, born May 9, 1757; died November 18, 1832. He married Sophia Jackson in 1874; she was six years the younger of the pair. He lived to be 75, she to 73. Ten children were born to this union: John, Mary, Elizabeth, William, Edward, Sarah, Henry, Joseph, Obedience, and Margaret, --- five boys and five girls. Their first born died at 18 years, and Mary at 11 years. All the others except Joseph married and produced the foundation for many other Davis families. I have heard my father speak often of his uncle Edward Davis. He settled somewhere in the midwest, but I don't know just where.\n\nWilliam Jackson Davis, fourth child of Joseph and Sophia, is the one from which our lineage continues. He was born December 31, 1791 (a New Year's gift) and died November 5, 1850, age 59. He married Lydia Gould, and to them were born four children: Jackson Gould, Isabel, Sophia, and Lydia. William Davis was a short, heavy man; his wife tall and slender. They lived near Wheeling, West Virginia; moved to a campsite in the Illinois River bottom not far from Versailles, Illinois in the fall of 1830; then on to a farm southeast of Clayton, Illinois in the spring of 1831. William was 39 years old at that time; his only son, Jackson was 14, and his youngest, Lydia, was nine (she died in November of that year).\n\nHow come this family moved to Illinois? A brother-in-law, Oliver Howes, a few years before had pioneered on 160 acres given him by the government. On March 21, 1831, Howes sold 97 acres of this tract to William J. Davis for $232.50. Today (1966) this tract would bring $38,500. Two years later, in May of 1833, Howes and William J. Davis bought an adjoining 160 acres for $200. This became the family homestead and is located half way between Timewell and Clayton, on the south side of U.S. 24. This man Howes must have been a real prince. I have heard my father speak well of him time and again.\n\nThe Davis line continues through William J. Davis' son, Jackson Gould Davis. He was my paternal grandfather. Jackson was born January 30, 1816; died 1893 (sic) age 77. He was 14 when his father's family moved to Illinois. He was a short, sandy complexioned man; and was 30 when he married Mary Chipman, she was 10 years younger. To them were born five sons: Cyrus Judson, Oliver, Eugene Seth, Jesse, and Oscar. Only three of this family of boys ever married.\n\nJackson Gould Davis took over the operation of the farm from his aging father. In addition, he was a skilled carpenter. Many of the seemingly indestructible, morticed-and-pinned, framed barns still standing in the community (Clayton, Illinois) are relics of his handicraft. The smaller barn at Glenhaven (Russell S. Davis' farm), built in 1880, is one of these. He was an artist in mortice, dovetail construction, and lathe operation. He made most of the cabinets, dressers, chairs and furniture in their home, and for his newly wed sons. Many of his dressers and chairs are still among today's antiques. Material for both buildings and furniture was sawed from native trees. He even made his own lathe, work bench, and vise; even the wood screw for his vise was turned out on his home-made lathe.\n\nMy father, Eugene Seth Davis, was the third son of Jackson Gould Davis' family. Born October 20, 1852, and died from cancer of the prostate, May 17, 1930, age 78. He married Rozina (Rosa) Hopper in February 1879. She was the oldest daughter of Harrel B. Hopper, a farmer living two miles west of the Davis'. The Hoppers moved to Illinois from Virginia in 1839, nine years after the Davis migration. Like his dad, my father didn't marry young. He was 27, and mother 24. Dad was a six footer, bald ever since I knew him, and a wore tightly twisted, sandy powderhorn mustache. He was a money maker --- enough to give each of his sons a good start and still leave a sizeable estate. He made more money feeding forty head of cattle a year than I have made on the same acres feeding 250 head.\n\nMy mother, Rozina Hopper, died of a stroke, July 23, 1907, age 52. I was just out of High School. Three years later, January 19, 1910, father married Agnes Hopper, younger sister of my mother. She was 47, (father 58), and had spent much of her early years caring for her aging parents. She was sure of hardy constitution --- outlived father by 24 years. She died at 90, of stroke, by far the oldest of the Hopper tribe.\n\nIn my father's family there were but two children: Fred Hopper Davis, born September 22, 1884, died 1958. He married Doral Marshall, out of a family of thirteen children, but they had no family; Russell S. Davis, born May 19, 1890. If family planning is a virtue, dad and mother earned a badge of merit. They were married 66 months when their first child was born, and another 66 months elapsed between the first and second birth.\n\nGetting back to the Jackson Gould Davis family lineage: Oliver Davis, born September 1, 1850, died February 28, 1904. He remained a bachelor, managed a grain elevator and feed enterprise at Bentley, Illinois. Jesse C. Davis, born November 22, 1858. He married Delia Lester, had on son Claude, lived on a small farm west of the Davis homestead until the early 1900s when they moved to California. He and his family are all buried out there. No record. Oscar Jay Davis, \"Yockey\" as he was called, born November 7, 1864. Being the youngest of the family of five, he was given the old homestead when his aging parents retired and moved to Clayton, Illinois. He was to care for his parents in exchange for the farm. Apparently he lacked the judgement and maturity of his elder brothers. He soon sold the old farm, for less than it was worth, took the money and disappeared. The only letter from his was postmarked in Hilo, Hawaii. If he lived out a normal life span, he did it under an assumed name. Other Clayton residents moving to California reported seeing a man they felt sure was Oscar, but he was never definitely recognized. Oscar's father died soon after moving to Clayton. His mother lingered several years and never gave up hope the \"Yockey\" would return. But he never did. He was a member of the Blue Lodge of Masons, even they were never able to trace Oscar's wanderings.\n\nCyrus Judson Davis, eldest of Jackson Gould's sons, married a neighbors daughter, Emma Watson. Their son, J. Otis Davis, married Pauline Hopper, a niece of my mother, and raised a large family. Cyrus J's two daughters, Lana, and Merle, both married but fell victims of cancer early in their married life and left no children.\n\nWilliam Jackson Davis, his wife Lydia and daughter Lydia, and son Oliver are buried in the family lot at Howes cemetery which joins the family homestead on the east. Cyrus J. Davis, his wife Emma, Eugene S. Davis and both his wives, Rozina and Agnes, Fred H. Davis and wife Dora, are all buried in their respective lots in Mound cemetery, a mile north of Timewell, Illinois.\n\nAnn, all of the above information is from family records, handed down from one generation to another.\" [George Perkins Genealogy, March 2007]\n\n***\n\nFrom Cemeteries of Brown County, IL [Perkins 2007]\n\nWilliam J. Davis came to Brown County in 1830, stopping at the Vandeventer settlement until the spring of 1831 when he came to Lee township. The first post office in the county was established at his house and it was called Davidson Post Office, and he was the first post master.\n\n***\n\n\"In some undocumented notes, source unknown, I have William Jackson Davis, b. 31 Dec 1791; died Oct 1850; married April 11, 1815 Lydia Gould, born Feb 2, 1794; died January 4, 1859, daughter of Asron and lydia (Gray) Gould.

In 1846 (possibly typo and should read 1836) they secured 108 acres on Rooting Creek. Later they bought a house and lot in Johnstown opposite the old blacksmith shop.

The deceased moved with his father to the residence on the Buchanan [sic] river and lived with his father until 1818 at which time he was married to a Miss Sarah Davis. Three years after his marriage he moved to Lewis County in what is now denominated West Virginia. While he was residing here he had the misfortune in the year 1839 to bury his wife, having been married about twenty one years. He only remained a widower for the space of about six months when he was again married to Emily E. Curtis daughter of Alexander Curtis who now survives him. In 1854 he and his family emigrated to Illinois and settled in Hancock County within a few miles of Carthage where he has continued to reside. At the age of 16 he embraced religion and joined the M. E. Church. He was a class leader for a number of years in the church and commanded the respect of all who knew him for his devotedness and Christian work. He has been sorely afflicted for fifteen years from a hurt from which he never fully recovered but from which at times he experienced the most intense anquish. His dying requests were in some degree peculiar. There was one certain spot in which he desired to be buried. He wished his pallbearers in carrying him out of his room to let the head of the coffin be in advance. He als selected the words, God is Love, from which he wished his funeral preached. After being confined entirely to his bed for eight weeks and undergoing the greatest sufferings he peacefully and unreluctantly passed from time to eternity leaving behind him a blessed assurance of his immortality beyond the grave. A large circle of friends and relatives are left to mourn his loss.

They moved to Clayton the same year, where she has since resided up to the time of her death, uniting at that time with the old Centerville, now Clayton Baptist church. The fruit of this marriage has been 3 sons and 2 daughters, all of whom are living and with us today. Sister Davis was left a widow, Oct. 9th, 1857- 29 years ago- yet she who trusted in the widow's God has not been disappointed in his merciful love and watchful care.
