Under non-rotor-synchronized conditions the rCW decoupling sequences provide more efficient decoupling, are easier to setup, and prove more robust towards experimental parameters such as radio frequency (rf) field amplitude and spinning frequency. This is demonstrated through numerical simulations substantiated with experimental results under different sample spinning and rf field amplitude conditions for powder samples of U-(13)C-glycine and U-(13)C-L-histidineÂ·HClÂ·H2O.

The method, called refocused continuous-wave (rCW) decoupling, is systematically established by interleaving continuous wave decoupling with appropriately inserted rotor-synchronized high-power Ï refocusing pulses of alternating phases. The effect of the refocusing pulses in eliminating residual effects from dipolar coupling in heteronuclear spin systems is rationalized by effective Hamiltonian calculations to third order. In some variants the Ï pulse refocusing is supplemented by insertion of rotor-synchronized Ï/2 purging pulses to further reduce the residual dipolar coupling effects. Five different rCW decoupling sequences are presented and their performance is compared to state-of-the-art decoupling methods. The rCW decoupling sequences benefit from extreme broadbandedness, tolerance towards rf inhomogeneity, and improved potential for decoupling at relatively low average rf field strengths. In numerical simulations, the rCW schemes clearly reveal superior characteristics relative to the best decoupling schemes presented so far, which we to some extent also are capable of demonstrating experimentally. A major advantage of the rCW decoupling methods is that they are easy to set up and optimize experimentally.\n\nRelative merits of rCW(A) and XiX heteronuclear spin decoupling in solid-state magic-angle-spinning NMR spectroscopy: A bimodal Floquet analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nEqubal, Asif; Leskes, Michal; Nielsen, Niels Chr; Madhu, P K; Vega, Shimon\n\n2016-02-01\n\nWe present a bimodal Floquet analysis of the recently introduced refocused continuous wave (rCW) solid-state NMR heteronuclear dipolar decoupling method and compare it with the similar looking X-inverse X (XiX) scheme. The description is formulated in the rf interaction frame and is valid for both finite and ideal Ï pulse rCW irradiation that forms the refocusing element in the rCW scheme. The effective heteronuclear dipolar coupling Hamiltonian up to first order is described. The analysis delineates the difference between the two sequences to different orders of their Hamiltonians for both diagonal and off-diagonal parts. All the resonance conditions observed in experiments and simulations have been characterised and their influence on residual line broadening is highlighted. The theoretical comparison substantiates the numerical simulations and experimental results to a large extent. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

K.\n\n2007-04-01\n\nRecently we introduced a radiofrequency pulse scheme for heteronuclear dipolar decoupling in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance under magic-angle spinning [R.S. Thakur, N.D. Kurur, P.K. Madhu, Swept-frequency two-pulse phase modulation for heteronuclear dipolar decoupling in solid-state NMR, Chem. Phys. Lett. 426 (2006) 459-463]. Variants of this sequence, swept-frequency TPPM, employing frequency modulation of different types have been further tested to improve the efficiency of heteronuclear dipolar decoupling. Among these, certain sequences that were found to perform well at lower spinning speeds are demonstrated here on a liquid-crystal sample of MBBA for application in static samples. The new sequences are compared with the standard TPPM and SPINAL schemes and are shown to perform better than them. These modulated schemes perform well at low decoupler radiofrequency power levels and are easy to implement on standard spectrometers.\n\nThe Structure of the Star-forming Cluster RCW 38\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWinston, E.; Wolk, S. J.; Bourke, T. L.; Megeath, S. T.; Gutermuth, R.; Spitzbart, B.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nWe present a study of the structure of the high-mass star-forming region RCW 38 and the spatial distribution of its young stellar population. Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry (3-8 Î¼m) is combined with Two Micron All Sky Survey near-IR data to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) by IR-excess emission from their circumstellar material. Chandra X-ray data are used to identify class III pre-main-sequence stars lacking circumstellar material. We identify 624 YSOs: 23 class 0/I and 90 flat spectrum protostars, 437 class II stars, and 74 class III stars. We also identify 29 (27 new) O star candidates over the IRAC field. Seventy-two stars exhibit IR-variability, including 7 class 0/I and 12 flat spectrum YSOs. A further 177 tentative candidates are identified by their location in the IRAC [3.6] versus [3.6]-[5.8] color-magnitude diagram. We find strong evidence of subclustering in the region. Three subclusters were identified surrounding the central cluster, with massive and variable stars in each subcluster. The central region shows evidence of distinct spatial distributions of the protostars and pre-main-sequence stars. A previously detected IR cluster, DB2001_Obj36, has been established as a subcluster of RCW 38. This suggests that star formation in RCW 38 occurs over a more extended area than previously thought. The gas-to-dust ratio is examined using the X-ray derived hydrogen column density, N H and the K-band extinction, and found to be consistent with the diffuse interstellar medium, in contrast with Serpens and NGC 1333. We posit that the high photoionizing flux of massive stars in RCW 38 affects the agglomeration of the dust grains.\n\nResolution enhancement using a new multiple-pulse decoupling sequence for quadrupolar nuclei.\n\nPubMed\n\nDelevoye, L; TrÃ©bosc, J; Gan, Z; Montagne, L; Amoureux, J-P\n\n2007-05-01\n\nA new decoupling composite pulse sequence is proposed to remove the broadening on spin S=1/2 magic-angle spinning (MAS) spectra arising from the scalar coupling with a quadrupolar nucleus I. It is illustrated on the (31)P spectrum of an aluminophosphate, AlPO(4)-14, which is broadened by the presence of (27)Al/(31)P scalar couplings. The multiple-pulse (MP) sequence has the advantage over the continuous wave (CW) irradiation to efficiently annul the scalar dephasing without reintroducing the dipolar interaction. The MP decoupling sequence is first described in a rotor-synchronised version (RS-MP) where one parameter only needs to be adjusted. It clearly avoids the dipolar recoupling in order to achieve a better resolution than using the CW sequence. In a second improved version, the MP sequence is experimentally studied in the vicinity of the perfect rotor-synchronised conditions. The linewidth at half maximum (FWHM) of 65 Hz using (27)Al CW decoupling decreases to 48 Hz with RS-MP decoupling and to 30 Hz with rotor-asynchronised MP (RA-MP) decoupling. The main phenomena are explained using both experimental results and numerical simulations.\n\nRCW 108: Massive Young Stars Trigger Stellar Birth\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2008-01-01\n\nRCW 108 is a region where stars are actively forming within the Milky Way galaxy about 4,000 light years from Earth. This is a complicated region that contains young star clusters, including one that is deeply embedded in a cloud of molecular hydrogen. By using data from different telescopes, astronomers determined that star birth in this region is being triggered by the effect of nearby, massive young stars. This image is a composite of X-ray data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory (blue) and infrared emission detected by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope (red and orange). More than 400 X-ray sources were identified in Chandra's observations of RCW 108. About 90 percent of these X-ray sources are thought to be part of the cluster and not stars that lie in the field-of-view either behind or in front of it. Many of the stars in RCW 108 are experiencing the violent flaring seen in other young star-forming regions such as the Orion nebula. Gas and dust blocks much of the X-rays from the juvenile stars located in the center of the image, explaining the relative dearth of Chandra sources in this part of the image. The Spitzer data show the location of the embedded star cluster, which appears as the bright knot of red and orange just to the left of the center of the image. Some stars from a larger cluster, known as NGC 6193, are also visible on the left side of the image. Astronomers think that the dense clouds within RCW 108 are in the process of being destroyed by intense radiation emanating from hot and massive stars in NGC 6193. Taken together, the Chandra and Spitzer data indicate that there are more massive star candidates than expected in several areas of this image. This suggests that pockets within RCW 108 underwent localized episodes of star formation. Scientists predict that this type of star formation is triggered by the effects of radiation from bright, massive stars such as those in NGC 6193. This radiation may cause the interior of gas\n\nA NEAR-INFRARED STUDY OF THE STAR-FORMING REGION RCW 34\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVan der Walt, D. J.; De Villiers, H. M.; Czanik, R. J.\n\n2012-07-15\n\nWe report the results of a near-infrared imaging study of a 7.8 Multiplication-Sign 7.8 arcmin{sup 2} region centered on the 6.7 GHz methanol maser associated with the RCW 34 star-forming region using the 1.4 m IRSF telescope at Sutherland. A total of 1283 objects were detected simultaneously in J, H, and K for an exposure time of 10,800 s. The J - H, H - K two-color diagram revealed a strong concentration of more than 700 objects with colors similar to what is expected of reddened classical T Tauri stars. The distribution of the objects on the K versus JmoreÂ Â» - K color-magnitude diagram is also suggestive that a significant fraction of the 1283 objects is made up of lower mass pre-main-sequence stars. We also present the luminosity function for the subset of about 700 pre-main-sequence stars and show that it suggests ongoing star formation activity for about 10{sup 7} years. An examination of the spatial distribution of the pre-main-sequence stars shows that the fainter (older) part of the population is more dispersed over the observed region and the brighter (younger) subset is more concentrated around the position of the O8.5V star. This suggests that the physical effects of the O8.5V star and the two early B-type stars on the remainder of the cloud out of which they formed could have played a role in the onset of the more recent episode of star formation in RCW 34.Â«Â less\n\nFermi Large Area Telescope Detection of Supernova Remnant RCW 86\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYuan, Qiang; Huang, Xiaoyuan; Liu, Siming; Zhang, Bing\n\n2014-04-01\n\nUsing 5.4 yr Fermi Large Area Telescope data, we report the detection of GeV Î³-ray emission from the shell-type supernova remnant RCW 86 (G315.4-2.3) with a significance of ~5.1Ï. The data slightly favors an extended emission of this supernova remnant. The spectral index of RCW 86 is found to be very hard, Î ~ 1.4, in the 0.4-300 GeV range. A one-zone leptonic model can well fit the multi-wavelength data from radio to very high energy Î³-rays. The very hard GeV Î³-ray spectrum and the inferred low gas density seem to disfavor a hadronic origin for the Î³-rays. The Î³-ray behavior of RCW 86 is very similar to several other TeV shell-type supernova remnants, e.g., RX J1713.7-3946, RX J0852.0-4622, SN 1006, and HESS J1731-347.\n\nThe formation of a Spitzer bubble RCW 79 triggered by a cloud-cloud collision\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOhama, Akio; Kohno, Mikito; Hasegawa, Keisuke; Torii, Kazufumi; Nishimura, Atsushi; Hattori, Yusuke; Hayakawa, Takahiro; Inoue, Tsuyoshi; Sano, Hidetoshi; Yamamoto, Hiroaki; Tachihara, Kengo; Fukui, Yasuo\n\n2018-05-01\n\nUnderstanding the mechanism of O-star formation is one of the most important current issues in astrophysics. Also an issue of keen interest is how O stars affect their surroundings and trigger secondary star formation. An H II region RCW 79 is one of the typical Spitzer bubbles alongside RCW 120. New observations of CO J = 1-0 emission with Mopra and NANTEN2 revealed that molecular clouds are associated with RCW 79 in four velocity components over a velocity range of 20 km s-1. We hypothesize that two of the clouds collided with each other and the collision triggered the formation of 12 O stars inside the bubble and the formation of 54 low-mass young stellar objects along the bubble wall. The collision is supported by observational signatures of bridges connecting different velocity components in the colliding clouds. The whole collision process happened over a timescale of Ë3 Myr. RCW 79 has a larger size by a factor of 30 in the projected area than RCW 120 with a single O star, and the large size favored formation of the 12 O stars due to the greater accumulated gas in the collisional shock compression.\n\nProtecting unknown two-qubit entangled states by nesting Uhrig's dynamical decoupling sequences\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMukhtar, Musawwadah; Soh, Wee Tee; Saw, Thuan Beng\n\n2010-11-15\n\nFuture quantum technologies rely heavily on good protection of quantum entanglement against environment-induced decoherence. A recent study showed that an extension of Uhrig's dynamical decoupling (UDD) sequence can (in theory) lock an arbitrary but known two-qubit entangled state to the Nth order using a sequence of N control pulses [Mukhtar et al., Phys. Rev. A 81, 012331 (2010)]. By nesting three layers of explicitly constructed UDD sequences, here we first consider the protection of unknown two-qubit states as superposition of two known basis states, without making assumptions of the system-environment coupling. It is found that the obtained decoherence suppression canmoreÂ Â» be highly sensitive to the ordering of the three UDD layers and can be remarkably effective with the correct ordering. The detailed theoretical results are useful for general understanding of the nature of controlled quantum dynamics under nested UDD. As an extension of our three-layer UDD, it is finally pointed out that a completely unknown two-qubit state can be protected by nesting four layers of UDD sequences. This work indicates that when UDD is applicable (e.g., when the environment has a sharp frequency cutoff and when control pulses can be taken as instantaneous pulses), dynamical decoupling using nested UDD sequences is a powerful approach for entanglement protection.Â«Â less\n\nA generalized theoretical framework for the description of spin decoupling in solid-state MAS NMR: Offset effect on decoupling performance\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTan, Kong Ooi; Meier, Beat H., E-mail: beme@ethz.ch, E-mail: maer@ethz.ch; Ernst, Matthias, E-mail: beme@ethz.ch, E-mail: maer@ethz.ch\n\n2016-09-07\n\nWe present a generalized theoretical framework that allows the approximate but rapid analysis of residual couplings of arbitrary decoupling sequences in solid-state NMR under magic-angle spinning conditions. It is a generalization of the tri-modal Floquet analysis of TPPM decoupling [Scholz et al., J. Chem.

By comparing the theoretical calculations with full numerical simulations, we show the potential of the new approach to examine the performance of decoupling sequences. We exemplify the usefulness of this framework by analyzing the performance of commonly used high-power decoupling sequences and low-power decoupling sequences such as amplitude-modulated XiX (AM-XiX) and its super-cycled variant SC-AM-XiX. In addition, the effect of chemical-shift offset is examined for both high- and low-power decoupling sequences. The results show that the cross-terms between the dipolar couplings are the main contributions to the line broadening when offset is present. We also show that the SC-AM-XIX shows a better offset compensation.Â«Â less\n\nA generalized theoretical framework for the description of spin decoupling in solid-state MAS NMR: Offset effect on decoupling performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nTan, Kong Ooi; Agarwal, Vipin; Meier, Beat H; Ernst, Matthias\n\n2016-09-07\n\nWe present a generalized theoretical framework that allows the approximate but rapid analysis of residual couplings of arbitrary decoupling sequences in solid-state NMR under magic-angle spinning conditions.

D.; Bonino, R.; Bottacini, E.; Brandt, T. J.;\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRCW 86 is a young supernova remnant (SNR) showing a shell-type structure at several wavelengths and is thought to be an efficient cosmic-ray (CR) accelerator. Earlier Fermi Large Area Telescope results reported the detection of gamma-ray emission coincident with the position of RCW 86 but its origin (leptonic or hadronic) remained unclear due to the poor statistics. Thanks to 6.5 years of data acquired by the Fermi-LAT and the new event reconstruction Pass 8, we report the significant detection of spatially extended emission coming from RCW 86. The spectrum is described by a power-law function with a very hard photon index (Gamma = 1.42 +/- 0.1(sub stat) +/- 0.06(sub syst)) in the 0.1-500 GeV range and an energy flux above 100 MeV of (2.91 +/- 0.8(sub stat) +/- 0.12(sub syst)) x 10(exp -11) erg/(sq cms). Gathering all the available multiwavelength (MWL) data, we perform a broadband modeling of the non-thermal emission of RCW 86 to constrain parameters of the nearby medium and bring new hints about the origin of the gamma-ray emission. For the whole SNR, the modeling favors a leptonic scenario in the framework of a two-zone model with an average magnetic field of 10.2 +/- 0.7 microG and a limit on the maximum energy injected into protons of 2 x 10(exp 49) erg for a density of 1 per cu cm. In addition, parameter values are derived for the north-east and south-west (SW) regions of RCW 86, providing the first indication of a higher magnetic field in the SW region.\n\nDeep morphological and spectral study of the SNR RCW 86 with Fermi-LAT\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nAjello, M.\n\n2016-03-02\n\nRCW 86 is a young supernova remnant (SNR) showing a shell-type structure at several wavelengths and is thought to be an efficient cosmic-ray (CR) accelerator.

SPI is a Bayesian modeling process that fits a population of gas blobs (\"smoothed particles\") such that their superposed emission reproduces the observed spatial and spectral distribution of photons. Emission-weighted distributions of plasma properties, such as abundances and temperatures, are then extracted from the properties of the individual blobs. This technique has important advantages over analysis techniques which implicitly assume that remnants are two-dimensional objects in which each line of sight encompasses a single plasma. By contrast, SPI allows superposition of as many blobs of plasma as are needed to match the spectrum observed in each direction, without the need to bin the data spatially. This RCW 103 analysis is part of a pilot study for the larger SPIES (Smoothed Particle Inference Exploration of SNRs) project, in which SPI will be applied to a sample of 12 bright SNRs.\n\nFurther perspective on the theory of heteronuclear decoupling.\n\nPubMed\n\nSkinner, Thomas E\n\n2014-11-01\n\nAn exact general theory of heteronuclear decoupling is presented for spin-1/2 IS systems. RF irradiation applied to the I spins both modifies and generates additional couplings between states of the system. The recently derived equivalence between the dynamics of any N-level quantum system and a system of classical coupled harmonic oscillators makes explicit the exact physical couplings between states. Decoupling is thus more properly viewed as a complex intercoupling. The sign of antiphase magnetization plays a fundamental role in decoupling. A one-to-one correspondence is demonstrated between Â±2SyIz and the sense of the S-spin coupling evolution. Magnetization Sx is refocused to obtain the desired decoupled state when â«2SyIzdt=0. The exact instantaneous coupling at any time during the decoupling sequence is readily obtained in terms of the system states, showing that the creation of two-spin coherence is crucial for reducing the effective scalar coupling, as required for refocusing to occur. Representative examples from new aperiodic sequences as well as standard cyclic, periodic composite-pulse and adiabatic decoupling sequences illustrate the decoupling mechanism. The more general aperiodic sequences, obtained using optimal control, realize the potential inherent in the theory for significantly improved decoupling. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Phase modulations, parameterised by DUMBO Fourier coefficients, were optimized using a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategies algorithm. Our method, denoted EASY-GOING homonuclear decoupling, starts with featureless spectra and optimises proton-proton decoupling, during either proton or carbon signal detection. On the one hand, our solutions closely resemble (e)DUMBO for moderate sample spinning frequencies and medium radio-frequency (rf) field strengths. On the other hand, the EASY-GOING approach resulted in a superior solution, achieving significantly better resolved proton spectra at very high 680 kHz rf field strength. N. Hansen, and A.

This method, called dynamical decoupling, is known to work for bounded interactions, but physical environments such as bosonic heat baths are usually modeled with unbounded interactions; hence, here, we initiate a systematic study of dynamical decoupling for unbounded operators. We develop a sufficient decoupling criterion for arbitrary Hamiltonians and a necessary decoupling criterion for semibounded Hamiltonians. We give examples for unbounded Hamiltonians where decoupling works and the limiting evolution as well as the convergence speed can be explicitly computed. We show that decoupling does not always work for unbounded interactions and we provide both physically and mathematically motivated examples.\n\nOptimal digital dynamical decoupling for general decoherence via Walsh modulation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nQi, Haoyu; Dowling, Jonathan P.; Viola, Lorenza\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe provide a general framework for constructing digital dynamical decoupling sequences based on Walsh modulationâapplicable to arbitrary qubit decoherence scenarios. By establishing equivalence between decoupling design based on Walsh functions and on concatenated projections, we identify a family of optimal Walsh sequences, which can be exponentially more efficient, in terms of the required total pulse number, for fixed cancellation order, than known digital sequences based on concatenated design. Optimal sequences for a given cancellation order are highly non-uniqueâtheir performance depending sensitively on the control path. We provide an analytic upper bound to the achievable decoupling error and show how sequences within the optimal Walsh family can substantially outperform concatenated decoupling in principle, while respecting realistic timing constraints.\n\nDetailed spectral and morphological analysis of the shell type supernova remnant RCW 86\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nH.E.S.S.

We aim for an understanding of the morphological and spectral properties of the supernova remnant RCW 86 and for insights into the production mechanism leading to the RCW 86 very high-energy Î³-ray emission. Methods: We analyzed High Energy Spectroscopic System (H.E.S.S.) data that had increased sensitivity compared to the observations presented in the RCW 86 H.E.S.S. discovery publication. Studies of the morphological correlation between the 0.5-1 keV X-ray band, the 2-5 keV X-ray band, radio, and Î³-ray emissions have been performed as well as broadband modeling of the spectral energy distribution with two different emission models. Results: We present the first conclusive evidence that the TeV Î³-ray emission region is shell-like based on our morphological studies. The comparison with 2-5 keV X-ray data reveals a correlation with the 0.4-50 TeV Î³-ray emission. The spectrum of RCW 86 is best described by a power law with an exponential cutoff at Ecut = (3.5 Â± 1.2stat) TeV and a spectral index of Î â 1.6 Â± 0.2. A static leptonic one-zone model adequately describes the measured spectral energy distribution of RCW 86, with the resultant total kinetic energy of the electrons above 1 GeV being equivalent to 0.1% of the initial kinetic energy of a Type Ia supernova explosion (1051 erg). When using a hadronic model, a magnetic field of B â 100 Î¼G is needed to represent the measured data. Although this is comparable to formerly published estimates, a standard E-2 spectrum for the proton distribution cannot describe the Î³-ray data. Instead, a spectral index of Îp â 1.7 would be required, which implies that Ë7 Ã 1049/ncm-3 has been transferred into high-energy protons with the effective density ncm-3 = n/1 cm-3. This is about 10% of the kinetic energy of a typical Type Ia supernova under the assumption of a density of 1 cm-3.\n\nStudies at high frequencies of the 30 Doradus and RCW 57 regions.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSabalisck, N.

Dynamical decoupling attenuates the destructive effect of the environmental noise, but so far, it has been used primarily in the context of quantum memories. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a general scheme for combining dynamical decoupling with quantum logical gate operations using the example of an electron-spin qubit of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We achieve process fidelities >98% for gate times that are 2 orders of magnitude longer than the unprotected dephasing time T2.\n\nRobust dynamical decoupling for quantum computing and quantum memory.\n\nPubMed\n\nSouza, Alexandre M; Alvarez, Gonzalo A; Suter, Dieter\n\n2011-06-17\n\nDynamical decoupling (DD) is a popular technique for protecting qubits from the environment. However, unless special care is taken, experimental errors in the control pulses used in this technique can destroy the quantum information instead of preserving it. Here, we investigate techniques for making DD sequences robust against different types of experimental errors while retaining good decoupling efficiency in a fluctuating environment. We present experimental data from solid-state nuclear spin qubits and introduce a new DD sequence that is suitable for quantum computing and quantum memory.\n\nThe effectiveness of 1H decoupling in the 13C MAS NMR of paramagnetic solids: An experimental case study incorporating copper(II) amino acid complexes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWillans, Mathew J.; Sears, Devin N.; Wasylishen, Roderick E.\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThe use of continuous-wave (CW) 1H decoupling has generally provided little improvement in the 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy of paramagnetic organic solids. Recent solid-state 13C NMR studies have demonstrated that at rapid magic-angle spinning rates CW decoupling can result in reductions in signal-to-noise and that 1H decoupling should be omitted when acquiring 13C MAS NMR spectra of paramagnetic solids. However, studies of the effectiveness of modern 1H decoupling sequences are lacking, and the performance of such sequences over a variety of experimental conditions must be investigated before 1H decoupling is discounted altogether. We have studied the performance of several commonly used advanced decoupling pulse sequences, namely the TPPM, SPINAL-64, XiX, and eDROOPY sequences, in 13C MAS NMR experiments performed under four combinations of the magnetic field strength (7.05 or 11.75 T), rotor frequency (15 or 30 kHz), and 1H rf-field strength (71, 100, or 140 kHz). The effectiveness of these sequences has been evaluated by comparing the 13C signal intensity, linewidth at half-height, LWHH, and coherence lifetimes, T2', of the methine carbon of copper(II) bis( DL-alanine) monohydrate, Cu(ala) 2Â·H 2O, and methylene carbon of copper(II) bis( DL-2-aminobutyrate), Cu(ambut) 2, obtained with the advanced sequences to those obtained without 1H decoupling, with CW decoupling, and for fully deuterium labelled samples. The latter have been used as model compounds with perfect 1H decoupling and provide a measure of the efficiency of the 1H decoupling sequence. Overall, the effectiveness of 1H decoupling depends strongly on the decoupling sequence utilized, the experimental conditions and the sample studied. Of the decoupling sequences studied, the XiX sequence consistently yielded the best results, although any of the advanced decoupling sequences strongly outperformed the CW sequence and provided improvements over no 1H decoupling. Experiments performed at 7.05 T demonstrate\n\nPreserving electron spin coherence in solids by optimal dynamical decoupling.\n\nPubMed\n\nDu, Jiangfeng; Rong, Xing; Zhao, Nan; Wang, Ya; Yang, Jiahui; Liu, R B\n\n2009-10-29\n\nTo exploit the quantum coherence of electron spins in solids in future technologies such as quantum computing, it is first vital to overcome the problem of spin decoherence due to their coupling to the noisy environment. Dynamical decoupling, which uses stroboscopic spin flips to give an average coupling to the environment that is effectively zero, is a particularly promising strategy for combating decoherence because it can be naturally integrated with other desired functionalities, such as quantum gates. Errors are inevitably introduced in each spin flip, so it is desirable to minimize the number of control pulses used to realize dynamical decoupling having a given level of precision. Such optimal dynamical decoupling sequences have recently been explored. The experimental realization of optimal dynamical decoupling in solid-state systems, however, remains elusive. Here we use pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance to demonstrate experimentally optimal dynamical decoupling for preserving electron spin coherence in irradiated malonic acid crystals at temperatures from 50 K to room temperature. Using a seven-pulse optimal dynamical decoupling sequence, we prolonged the spin coherence time to about 30 mus; it would otherwise be about 0.04 mus without control or 6.2 mus under one-pulse control. By comparing experiments with microscopic theories, we have identified the relevant electron spin decoherence mechanisms in the solid. Optimal dynamical decoupling may be applied to other solid-state systems, such as diamonds with nitrogen-vacancy centres, and so lay the foundation for quantum coherence control of spins in solids at room temperature.\n\nThe many sides of RCW 86: a Type Ia supernova remnant evolving in its progenitor's wind bubble\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBroersen, Sjors; Chiotellis, Alexandros; Vink, Jacco; Bamba, Aya\n\n2014-07-01\n\nWe present the results of a detailed investigation of the Galactic supernova remnant RCW 86 using the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope. RCW 86 is the probable remnant of SN 185 A.D., a supernova that likely exploded inside a wind-blown cavity. We use the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer to derive precise temperatures and ionization ages of the plasma, which are an indication of the interaction history of the remnant with the presumed cavity. We find that the spectra are well fitted by two non-equilibrium ionization models, which enables us to constrain the properties of the ejecta and interstellar matter plasma. Furthermore, we performed a principal component analysis on EPIC MOS and pn data to find regions with particular spectral properties. We present evidence that the shocked ejecta, emitting Fe K and Si line emission, are confined to a shell of approximately 2 pc width with an oblate spheroidal morphology. Using detailed hydrodynamical simulations, we show that general dynamical and emission properties at different portions of the remnant can be well reproduced by a Type Ia supernova that exploded in a non-spherically symmetric wind-blown cavity. We also show that this cavity can be created using general wind properties for a single degenerate system. Our data and simulations provide further evidence that RCW 86 is indeed the remnant of SN 185, and is the likely result of a Type Ia explosion of single degenerate origin.\n\nFertilizer Induced Nitrate Pollution in RCW: Calibration of the DNDC Model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEl Hailouch, E.; Hornberger, G.; Crane, J. W.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nFertilizer is widely used among urban and suburban households due to the socially driven attention of homeowners to lawn appearance. With high nitrogen content, fertilizer considerably impacts the environment through the emission of the highly potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and the leaching of nitrate. Nitrate leaching is significantly important because fertilizer sourced nitrate that is partially leached into soil causes groundwater pollution. In an effort to model the effect of fertilizer application on the environment, the geochemical DeNitrification-DeComposition model (DNDC) was previously developed to quantitatively measure the effects of fertilizer use. The purpose of this study is to use this model more effectively on a large scale through a measurement based calibration. For this reason, leaching was measured and studied on 12 sites in the Richland Creek Watershed (RCW). Information about the fertilization and irrigation regimes of these sites was collected, along with lysimeter readings that gave nitrate fluxes in the soil. A study of the amount and variation in nitrate leaching with respect to the varying geographical locations, time of the year, and fertilization and irrigation regimes has lead to a better understanding of the driving forces behind nitrate leaching. Quantifying the influence of each of these parameters allows for a more accurate calibration of the model thus permitting use that extends beyond the RCW. Measurement of nitrate leaching on a statewide or nationwide level in turn will help guide efforts in the reduction of groundwater pollution caused by fertilizer.\n\nA solar-type star polluted by calcium-rich supernova ejecta inside the supernova remnant RCW 86\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGvaramadze, Vasilii V.; Langer, Norbert; Fossati, Luca; Bock, Douglas C.-J.; Castro, Norberto; Georgiev, Iskren Y.; Greiner, Jochen; Johnston, Simon; Rau, Arne; Tauris, Thomas M.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nWhen a massive star in a binary system explodes as a supernova, its companion star may be polluted with heavy elements from the supernova ejecta. Such pollution has been detected in a handful of post-supernova binaries 1 , but none of them is associated with a supernova remnant. We report the discovery of a binary G star strongly polluted with calcium and other elements at the position of the candidate neutron star [GV2003] N within the young galactic supernova remnant RCW 86. Our discovery suggests that the progenitor of the supernova that produced RCW 86 could have been a moving star, which exploded near the edge of its wind bubble and lost most of its initial mass because of common-envelope evolution shortly before core collapse, and that the supernova explosion might belong to the class of calcium-rich supernovae â faint and fast transients 2,3 , the origin of which is strongly debated 4-6 .\n\nFaithful solid state optical memory with dynamically decoupled spin wave storage.\n\nPubMed\n\nLovriÄ, Marko; Suter, Dieter; Ferrier, Alban; Goldner, Philippe\n\n2013-07-12\n\nWe report a high fidelity optical memory in which dynamical decoupling is used to extend the storage time.

An interference experiment shows that relative phases of input pulses are preserved through the whole storage and retrieval process with a visibility â1, demonstrating the usefulness of dynamical decoupling for extending the storage time of quantum memories.

THE CASE OF RCW 49\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPaladini, Roberta; Ingallinera, Adriano; Agliozzo, Claudia\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThe detection of an excess of emission at microwave frequencies with respect to the predicted freeâfree emission has been reported for several Galactic H ii regions. Here, we investigate the case of RCW 49, for which the Cosmic Background Imager tentatively (â¼3Ï) detected Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) at 31 GHz on angular scales of 7â². Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we carried out a multi-frequency (5, 19, and 34 GHz) continuum study of the region, complemented by observations of the H109Î± radio recombination line. The analysis shows that: (1) the spatial correlation between the microwave and IR emission persistsmoreÂ Â» on angular scales from 3.â²4 to 0.â³4, although the degree of the correlation slightly decreases at higher frequencies and on smaller angular scales; (2) the spectral indices between 1.4 and 5 GHz are globally in agreement with optically thin freeâfree emission, however, â¼30% of these are positive and much greater than â0.1, consistent with a stellar wind scenario; and (3) no major evidence for inverted freeâfree radiation is found, indicating that this is likely not the cause of the Anomalous Emission in RCW 49. Although our results cannot rule out the spinning dust hypothesis to explain the tentative detection of AME in RCW 49, they emphasize the complexity of astronomical sources that are very well known and studied, such as H ii regions, and suggest that, at least in these objects, the reported excess of emission might be ascribed to alternative mechanisms such as stellar winds and shocks.Â«Â less\n\nSpatially resolved spectroscopy of WR ring nebulae. I - NGC 2359 and RCW 78\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEsteban, C.; Vilchez, J. M.; Manchado, A.; Edmunds, M. G.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nWe report detailed spatially resolved spectroscopy of the WR nebulae NGC 2359 and RCW 78 surrounding the WN 5 HD 56925 and WN 8 HD 117688 stars. The aim of this work has been to study possible abundance inhomogeneities and the ionization structure of the nebulae, as well as to derive reliable values for the degree of self-enrichment. In NGC 2359 the derived ratio O2+/O+ shows localized variations resulting from the compression of the gas in the filaments with respect to the shell gas. Effective temperatures for the central stars of both nebulae have been estimated on the basis of the ionization structure; the values found appear appropriate for their spectral types. Abundances of O/H, NIH, Ne/H, and He/H have been determined in twelve different positions in NGC 2359, covering its different morphological zones. No significant differences in the N/H and O/H abundances across the nebula have been found, although He/H shows marginal evidence for localized enhancements. In the case of RCW 78 the derived value of O/H is roughly solar, but He/H and NIH may be slightly overabundant. The results suggest that the amount of chemical self-enrichment of these WR nebulae is, at most, small.\n\nSequential Star Formation in RCW 34: A Spectroscopic Census of the Stellar Content of High-Mass Star-Forming Regions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBik, A.; Puga, E.; Waters, L. B. F. M.; Horrobin, M.; Henning, Th.; Vasyunina, T.; Beuther, H.; Linz, H.; Kaper, L.; van den Ancker, M.; Lenorzer, A.; Churchwell, E.; Kurtz, S.; Kouwenhoven, M. B. N.; Stolte, A.; de Koter, A.; Thi, W. F.; ComerÃ³n, F.; Waelkens, Ch.\n\n2010-04-01\n\nIn this paper, we present VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy of RCW 34 along with Spitzer/IRAC photometry of the surroundings. RCW 34 consists of three different regions. A large bubble has been detected in the IRAC images in which a cluster of intermediate- and low-mass class II objects is found. At the northern edge of this bubble, an H II region is located, ionized by 3 OB stars, of which the most massive star has spectral type O8.5V. Intermediate-mass stars (2-3 M sun) are detected of G- and K-spectral type. These stars are still in the pre-main-sequence (PMS) phase. North of the H II region, a photon-dominated region is present, marking the edge of a dense molecular cloud traced by H2 emission. Several class 0/I objects are associated with this cloud, indicating that star formation is still taking place. The distance to RCW 34 is revised to 2.5 Â± 0.2 kpc and an age estimate of 2 Â± 1 Myr is derived from the properties of the PMS stars inside the H II region. Between the class II sources in the bubble and the PMS stars in the H II region, no age difference could be detected with the present data. The presence of the class 0/I sources in the molecular cloud, however, suggests that the objects inside the molecular cloud are significantly younger. The most likely scenario for the formation of the three regions is that star formation propagated from south to north. First the bubble is formed, produced by intermediate- and low-mass stars only, after that, the H II region is formed from a dense core at the edge of the molecular cloud, resulting in the expansion similar to a champagne flow. More recently, star formation occurred in the rest of the molecular cloud. Two different formation scenarios are possible. (1) The bubble with the cluster of low- and intermediate-mass stars triggered the formation of the O star at the edge of the molecular cloud, which in its turn induces the current star formation in the molecular cloud. (2) An external triggering is\n\nA unified heteronuclear decoupling strategy for magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nEqubal, Asif; Bjerring, Morten; Nielsen, Niels Chr., E-mail: madhu@tifr.res.in, E-mail: ncn@inano.au.dk\n\n2015-05-14\n\nA unified strategy of two-pulse based heteronuclear decoupling for solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance is presented. The analysis presented here shows that different decoupling sequences like two-pulse phase-modulation (TPPM), X-inverse-X (XiX), and finite pulse refocused continuous wave (rCW{sup A}) are basically specific solutions of a more generalized decoupling scheme which incorporates the concept of time-modulation along with phase-modulation. A plethora of other good decoupling conditions apart from the standard, TPPM, XiX, and rCW{sup A} decoupling conditions are available from the unified decoupling approach. The importance of combined time- and phase-modulation in order to achieve the best decoupling conditions ismoreÂ Â» delineated. The consequences of different indirect dipolar interactions arising from cross terms comprising of heteronuclear and homonuclear dipolar coupling terms and also those between heteronuclear dipolar coupling and chemical-shift anisotropy terms are presented in order to unfold the effects of anisotropic interactions under different decoupling conditions. Extensive numerical simulation results are corroborated with experiments on standard amino acids.Â«Â less\n\nHigh-mass star formation possibly triggered by cloud-cloud collision in the H II region RCW 34\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHayashi, Katsuhiro; Sano, Hidetoshi; Enokiya, Rei; Torii, Kazufumi; Hattori, Yusuke; Kohno, Mikito; Fujita, Shinji; Nishimura, Atsushi; Ohama, Akio; Yamamoto, Hiroaki; Tachihara, Kengo; Hasegawa, Yutaka; Kimura, Kimihiro; Ogawa, Hideo; Fukui, Yasuo\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe report on the possibility that the high-mass star located in the H II region RCW 34 was formed by a triggering induced by a collision of molecular clouds. Molecular gas distributions of the 12CO and 13CO J = 2-1 and 12CO J = 3-2 lines in the direction of RCW 34 were measured using the NANTEN2 and ASTE telescopes. We found two clouds with velocity ranges of 0-10 km s-1 and 10-14 km s-1. Whereas the former cloud is as massive as Ë1.4 Ã 104 Mâ and has a morphology similar to the ring-like structure observed in the infrared wavelengths, the latter cloud, with a mass of Ë600 Mâ, which has not been recognized by previous observations, is distributed to just cover the bubble enclosed by the other cloud. The high-mass star with a spectral type of O8.5V is located near the boundary of the two clouds. The line intensity ratio of 12CO J = 3-2/J = 2-1 yields high values (â³1.0), suggesting that these clouds are associated with the massive star. We also confirm that the obtained position-velocity diagram shows a similar distribution to that derived by a numerical simulation of the supersonic collision of two clouds. Using the relative velocity between the two clouds (Ë5 km s-1), the collisional time scale is estimated to be Ë0.2 Myr with the assumption of a distance of 2.5 kpc. These results suggest that the high-mass star in RCW 34 was formed rapidly within a time scale of Ë0.2 Myr via a triggering of a cloud-cloud collision.\n\nOptimally combining dynamical decoupling and quantum error correction.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaz-Silva, Gerardo A; Lidar, D A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nQuantum control and fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) are two of the cornerstones on which the hope of realizing a large-scale quantum computer is pinned, yet only preliminary steps have been taken towards formalizing the interplay between them.

E.; Bamba, A.; Giordano, F.; Uchiyama, Y.\n\n2012-09-01\n\nContext. Several young supernova remnants (SNRs) have recently been detected in the high-energy (HE; 0.1 < E < 100 GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray domains. As exemplified by RX J1713.7-3946, the nature of this emission has been hotly debated, and direct evidence for the efficient acceleration of cosmic-ray protons at the SNR shocks still remains elusive. Aims: We study the broadband gamma-ray emission from one of these young SNRs, namely RCW 86, for which several observational lines of evidence indirectly point towards the presence of accelerated hadrons. We then attempt to detect any putative hadronic signal from this SNR in the available gamma-ray data, in order to assess the level of acceleration efficiency. Methods: We analyzed more than 40 months of data acquired by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope in the HE domain, and gathered all of the relevant multi-wavelength (from radio to VHE gamma-rays) information about the broadband nonthermal emission from RCW 86. For this purpose, we re-analyzed the archival X-ray data from the ASCA/Gas Imaging Spectrometer (GIS), the XMM-Newton/EPIC-MOS, and the RXTE/Proportional Counter Array (PCA). Results: Beyond the expected Galactic diffuse background, no significant gamma-ray emission in the direction of RCW 86 is detected in any of the 0.1-1, 1-10 and 10-100 GeV Fermi-LAT maps. The derived HE upper limits, together with the H.E.S.S. measurements in the VHE domain, are incompatible with a standard Ep-2 hadronic emission arising from proton-proton interactions, and can only be accommodated by a spectral index Î â¤ 1.8, i.e. a value in-between the standard (test-particle) index and the asymptotic limit of theoretical particle spectra in the case of strongly modified shocks.

K.; Agarwal, Vipin\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe performance of heteronuclear spin decoupling sequences in solid-state NMR severely degrades when the proton radiofrequency (RF) nutation frequencies (Î½1) are close to or at multiples of magic-angle spinning (MAS) frequency (Î½r) that are referred to as rotary-resonance recoupling conditions (Î½1 = n Â· Î½r). Recently, two schemes, namely, PISSARRO and rCWApA, have been shown to be less affected by the problem of MAS and RF interference, specifically at the n = 2 rotary-resonance recoupling condition, especially in the fast MAS regime. Here, we systematically evaluate the loss in intensity of several heteronuclear spin decoupling sequences at the n = 1, 2 conditions compared to high-power decoupling in the fast-MAS regime. We propose that in the fast-MAS regime (above 40 kHz) the entire discussion about RF and MAS interference can be avoided by using appropriate low-power decoupling sequences which give comparable performance to decoupling sequences with high-power 1H irradiation of ca.195 kHz.\n\nRange-azimuth decouple beamforming for frequency diverse array with Costas-sequence modulated frequency offsets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Zhe; Wang, Wen-Qin; Shao, Huaizong\n\n2016-12-01\n\nDifferent from the phased-array using the same carrier frequency for each transmit element, the frequency diverse array (FDA) uses a small frequency offset across the array elements to produce range-angle-dependent transmit beampattern. FDA radar provides new application capabilities and potentials due to its range-dependent transmit array beampattern, but the FDA using linearly increasing frequency offsets will produce a range and angle coupled transmit beampattern. In order to decouple the range-azimuth beampattern for FDA radar, this paper proposes a uniform linear array (ULA) FDA using Costas-sequence modulated frequency offsets to produce random-like energy distribution in the transmit beampattern and thumbtack transmit-receive beampattern. In doing so, the range and angle of targets can be unambiguously estimated through matched filtering and subspace decomposition algorithms in the receiver signal processor. Moreover, random-like energy distributed beampattern can also be utilized for low probability of intercept (LPI) radar applications. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the standard FDA in focusing the transmit energy, especially in the range dimension.\n\nAccuracy of dynamical-decoupling-based spectroscopy of Gaussian noise\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSzaÅkowski, Piotr; CywiÅski, Åukasz\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe fundamental assumption of dynamical-decoupling-based noise spectroscopy is that the coherence decay rate of qubit (or qubits) driven with a sequence of many pulses, is well approximated by the environmental noise spectrum spanned on frequency comb defined by the sequence. Here we investigate the precise conditions under which this commonly used spectroscopic approach is quantitatively correct. To this end we focus on two representative examples of spectral densities: the long-tailed Lorentzian, and finite-ranged Gaussianâboth expected to be encountered when using the qubit for nanoscale nuclear resonance imaging. We have found that, in contrast to Lorentz spectrum, for which the corrections to the standard spectroscopic formulas can easily be made negligible, the spectra with finite range are more challenging to reconstruct accurately. For Gaussian line shape of environmental spectral density, direct application of the standard dynamical-decoupling-based spectroscopy leads to erroneous attribution of long-tail behavior to the reconstructed spectrum. Fortunately, artifacts such as this, can be completely avoided with the simple extension to standard reconstruction method.\n\nProton-decoupled, Overhauser-enhanced, spatially localized carbon-13 spectroscopy in humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nBottomley, P A; Hardy, C J; Roemer, P B; Mueller, O M\n\n1989-12-01\n\nSpatially localized, natural abundance, carbon (13C) NMR spectroscopy has been combined with proton (1H) decoupling and nuclear Overhauser enhancement to improve 13C sensitivity up to five-fold in the human leg, liver, and heart. Broadhand-decoupled 13C spectra were acquired in 1 s to 17 min with a conventional 1.5-T imaging/spectroscopy system, an auxiliary 1H decoupler, an air-cooled dual-coil coplanar surface probe, and both depth-resolved surface coil spectroscopy (DRESS) and one-dimensional phase-encoding gradient NMR pulse sequences. The surface coil probe comprised circular and figure-eight-shaped coils to eliminate problems with mutual coupling of coils at high decoupling power levels applied during 13C reception. Peak decoupler RF power deposition in tissue was computed numerically from electromagnetic theory assuming a semi-infinite plane of uniform biological conductor. Peak values at the surface were calculated at 4 to 6 W/kg in any gram of tissue for each watt of decoupler power input excluding all coil and cable losses, warning of potential local RF heating problems in these and related experiments. The average power deposition was about 9 mW/kg per watt input, which should present no systemic hazard. At 3 W input, human 13C spectra were decoupled to a depth of about 5 cm while some Overhauser enhancement was sustained up to about 3 cm depth, without ill effect. The observation of glycogen in localized natural abundance 13C spectra of heart and muscle suggests that metabolites in the citric acid cycle should be observable noninvasively using 13C-labeled substrates.\n\nRCW 36 in the Vela Molecular Ridge: Evidence for high-mass star-cluster formation triggered by cloud-cloud collision\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSano, Hidetoshi; Enokiya, Rei; Hayashi, Katsuhiro; Yamagishi, Mitsuyoshi; Saeki, Shun; Okawa, Kazuki; Tsuge, Kisetsu; Tsutsumi, Daichi; Kohno, Mikito; Hattori, Yusuke; Yoshiike, Satoshi; Fujita, Shinji; Nishimura, Atsushi; Ohama, Akio; Tachihara, Kengo; Torii, Kazufumi; Hasegawa, Yutaka; Kimura, Kimihiro; Ogawa, Hideo; Wong, Graeme F.; Braiding, Catherine; Rowell, Gavin; Burton, Michael G.; Fukui, Yasuo\n\n2018-02-01\n\nA collision between two molecular clouds is one possible candidate for high-mass star formation.

A signal-decoupling algorithm was developed that can enable separation of multiple oscillation frequency contents and extraction of a âpureâ oscillation frequency mode that are fed into Power System Stabilizers (PSSs) as the modulation input signals. As a result, instead of introducing interferences between different oscillation modes from the traditional approaches, the output of the new PSS modulationmoreÂ Â» control signal mainly affects only one oscillation mode of interest. The new decoupled modulation damping control algorithm has been successfully developed and tested on the standard IEEE 4-machine 2-area test system and a minniWECC system. The results are compared against traditional modulation controls, which demonstrates the validity and effectiveness of the newly-developed decoupled modulation damping control algorithm.Â«Â less\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: Danks 1, Danks 2, and RCW 79 variables (Chene+, 2012)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChene, A.-N.; Borissova, J.; Clarke, J.

To that end we provide an analytical description of the intrinsic behavior of Cosine Modulation decoupling with respect to radio-frequency-inhomogeneity and the proton-proton dipolar coupling network. We discover through a Modulation Frame average Hamiltonian analysis that best decoupling is obtained under conditions where the heteronuclear interactions are removed but notably where homonuclear couplings are recoupled at a homonuclear Rotary Resonance (HORROR) condition in the Modulation Frame. These conclusions are supported by extensive experimental investigations, and notably through the introduction of proton nutation experiments to characterize spin dynamics in solids under decoupling conditions. The theoretical framework presented in this paper allows the prediction of the optimum parameters for a given set of experimental conditions.\n\nFRF decoupling of nonlinear systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKalaycÄ±oÄlu, Taner; ÃzgÃ¼ven, H. Nevzat\n\n2018-03-01\n\nStructural decoupling problem, i.e. predicting dynamic behavior of a particular substructure from the knowledge of the dynamics of the coupled structure and the other substructure, has been well investigated for three decades and led to several decoupling methods. In spite of the inherent nonlinearities in a structural system in various forms such as clearances, friction and nonlinear stiffness, all decoupling studies are for linear systems. In this study, decoupling problem for nonlinear systems is addressed for the first time. A method, named as FRF Decoupling Method for Nonlinear Systems (FDM-NS), is proposed for calculating FRFs of a substructure decoupled from a coupled nonlinear structure where nonlinearity can be modeled as a single nonlinear element. Depending on where nonlinear element is, i.e., either in the known or unknown subsystem, or at the connection point, the formulation differs. The method requires relative displacement information between two end points of the nonlinear element, in addition to point and transfer FRFs at some points of the known subsystem. However, it is not necessary to excite the system from the unknown subsystem even when the nonlinear element is in that subsystem. The validation of FDM-NS is demonstrated with two different case studies using nonlinear lumped parameter systems. Finally, a nonlinear experimental test structure is used in order to show the real-life application and accuracy of FDM-NS.\n\nHerschel observations of the Galactic H II region RCW 79\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Hong-Li; Figueira, Miguel; Zavagno, Annie; Hill, Tracey; Schneider, Nicola; Men'shchikov, Alexander; Russeil, Delphine; Motte, FrÃ©dÃ©rique; TigÃ©, JÃ©rÃ©my; Deharveng, Lise; Anderson, Loren D.; Li, Jin-Zeng; Wu, Yuefang; Yuan, Jing-Hua; Huang, Maohai\n\n2017-06-01\n\nContext. Triggered star formation around H II regions could be an important process. The Galactic H II region RCW 79 is a prototypical object for triggered high-mass star formation. Aims: We aim to obtain a census of the young stellar population observed at the edges of the H II region and to determine the properties of the young sources in order to characterize the star formation processes that take place at the edges of this ionized region. Methods: We take advantage of Herschel data from the surveys HOBYS, \"Evolution of Interstellar Dust\", and Hi-Gal to extract compact sources. We use the algorithm getsources. We complement the Herschel data with archival 2MASS, Spitzer, and WISE data to determine the physical parameters of the sources (e.g., envelope mass, dust temperature, and luminosity) by fitting the spectral energy distribution. Results: We created the dust temperature and column density maps along with the column density probability distribution function (PDF) for the entire RCW 79 region. We obtained a sample of 50 compact sources in this region, 96% of which are situated in the ionization-compressed layer of cold and dense gas that is characterized by the column density PDF with a double-peaked lognormal distribution. The 50 sources have sizes of 0.1-0.4 pc with a typical value of 0.2 pc, temperatures of 11-26 K, envelope masses of 6-760 Mâ, densities of 0.1-44 Ã 105 cm-3, and luminosities of 19-12 712 Lâ. The sources are classified into 16 class 0, 19 intermediate, and 15 class I objects. Their distribution follows the evolutionary tracks in the diagram of bolometric luminosity versus envelope mass (Lbol-Menv) well. A mass threshold of 140 Mâ, determined from the Lbol-Menv diagram, yields 12 candidate massive dense cores that may form high-mass stars. The core formation efficiency (CFE) for the 8 massive condensations shows an increasing trend of the CFE with density. This suggests that the denser the condensation, the higher the fraction of its\n\nDetailed CO(J = 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2) observations toward an H II region RCW 32 in the Vela Molecular Ridge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEnokiya, Rei; Sano, Hidetoshi; Hayashi, Katsuhiro; Tachihara, Kengo; Torii, Kazufumi; Yamamoto, Hiroaki; Hattori, Yusuke; Hasegawa, Yutaka; Ohama, Akio; Kimura, Kimihiro; Ogawa, Hideo; Fukui, Yasuo\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe performed CO(J = 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2) observations toward an H II region RCW 32 in the Vela Molecular Ridge. The CO gas distribution associated with the H II region was revealed for the first time at a high resolution of 22â³. The results revealed three distinct velocity components which show correspondence with the optical dark lanes and/or HÎ± distribution. Two of the components show complementary spatial distribution which suggests collisional interaction between them at a relative velocity of Ë 4 km s-1. Based on these results, we present a hypothesis that a cloud-cloud collision determined the cloud distribution and triggered formation of the exciting star ionizing RCW 32. The collision time scale is estimated from the cloud size and the velocity separation to be Ë2 Myr and the collision terminated Ë1 Myr ago, which is consistent with the age of the exciting star and the associated cluster. By combing the previous works on the H II regions in the Vela Molecular Ridge, we argue that the majority (at least four) of the H II regions in the Ridge were formed by triggering of cloud-cloud collision.\n\nMolecular gas in the H II-region complex RCW 166: Possible evidence for an early phase of cloud-cloud collision prior to the bubble formation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOhama, Akio; Kohno, Mikito; Fujita, Shinji; Tsutsumi, Daichi; Hattori, Yusuke; Torii, Kazufumi; Nishimura, Atsushi; Sano, Hidetoshi; Yamamoto, Hiroaki; Tachihara, Kengo; Fukui, Yasuo\n\n2018-05-01\n\nYoung H II regions are an important site for the study of O star formation based on distributions of ionized and molecular gas. We reveal that two molecular clouds at Ë48 km s-1 and Ë53 km s-1 are associated with the H II regions G018.149-00.283 in RCW 166 by using the JCMT CO High-Resolution Survey (COHRS) of the 12CO(J = 3-2) emission. G018.149-00.283 comprises a bright ring at 8 Î¼m and an extended H II region inside the ring. The Ë48 km s-1 cloud delineates the ring, and the Ë53 km s-1 cloud is located within the ring, indicating a complementary distribution between the two molecular components. We propose a hypothesis that high-mass stars within G018.149-00.283 were formed by triggering during cloud-cloud collision at a projected velocity separation of Ë5 km s-1. We argue that G018.149-00.283 is in an early evolutionary stage, Ë0.1 Myr after the collision according to the scheme detailed by Habe and Ohta (1992, PASJ, 44, 203), which will be followed by a bubble formation stage like RCW 120. We also suggest that nearby H II regions N21 and N22 are candidates for bubbles possibly formed by cloud-cloud collision. Inoue and Fukui (2013, ApJ, 774, L31) showed that the interface gas becomes highly turbulent and realizes a high-mass accretion rate of 10-3-10-4 Mâ yr-1 by magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations, which offers an explanation of the O-star formation. The fairly high frequency of cloud-cloud collision in RCW 166 is probably due to the high cloud density in this part of the Scutum arm.\n\nGeneral solution to inhomogeneous dephasing and smooth pulse dynamical decoupling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZeng, Junkai; Deng, Xiu-Hao; Russo, Antonio; Barnes, Edwin\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn order to achieve the high-fidelity quantum control needed for a broad range of quantum information technologies, reducing the effects of noise and system inhomogeneities is an essential task. It is well known that a system can be decoupled from noise or made insensitive to inhomogeneous dephasing dynamically by using carefully designed pulse sequences based on square or delta-function waveforms such as Hahn spin echo or CPMG. However, such ideal pulses are often challenging to implement experimentally with high fidelity. Here, we uncover a new geometrical framework for visualizing all possible driving fields, which enables one to generate an unlimited number of smooth, experimentally feasible pulses that perform dynamical decoupling or dynamically corrected gates to arbitrarily high order. We demonstrate that this scheme can significantly enhance the fidelity of single-qubit operations in the presence of noise and when realistic limitations on pulse rise times and amplitudes are taken into account.\n\nAccreting Compact Object at the Center of the Supernova Remnant RCW 103.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSanwal, D.; Garmire, G.

The complex light curve of the source shows a period of about 6.4 hours and two partial eclipses or dips per period, separated by 180o in phase. The variability of the source proves that it is powered by accretion, likely from a low-mass companion in a binary system. Deep near-IR observations of the source with VLT suggest a potential counterpart of the compact object about 2'' from the nominal Chandra position. The magnitudes of the potential counterpart are J â 22.3, H â 19.6, and Ks â 18.5, with an uncertainty of about 0.5 mag. We will discuss possible interpretations of the observational results.

Yet, in art consumption, the epitome of a strongly decoupled cognitive process, the artwork is a physical part of the environment and partly controls the perception of its target by the audience, leading to immersion. Hence, art consumption combines strong decoupling with situated cognition.\n\nDeep near-infrared adaptive-optics observations of a young embedded cluster at the edge of the RCW 41 H II region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNeichel, B.; Samal, M. R.; Plana, H.; Zavagno, A.; Bernard, A.; Fusco, T.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nAims: We investigate the star formation activity in a young star forming cluster embedded at the edge of the RCW 41 H ii region. As a complementary goal, we aim to demonstrate the gain provided by wide-field adaptive optics (WFAO) instruments to study young clusters. Methods: We used deep, JHKs images from the newly commissioned Gemini-GeMS/GSAOI instrument, complemented with Spitzer IRAC observations, in order to study the photometric properties of the young stellar cluster. GeMS is a WFAO instrument that delivers almost diffraction-limited images over a field of ~2' across. The exquisite angular resolution allows us to reach a limiting magnitude of J ~ 22 for 98% completeness. The combination of the IRAC photometry with our JHKs catalog is used to build color-color diagrams, and select young stellar object (YSO) candidates. The JHKs photometry is also used in conjunction with pre-main sequence evolutionary models to infer masses and ages. The K-band luminosity function is derived, and then used to build the initial mass function (IMF) of the cluster. Results: We detect the presence of 80 YSO candidates. Those YSOs are used to infer the cluster age, which is found to be in the range 1 to 5 Myr. More precisely, we find that 1/3 of the YSOs are in a range between 3 to 5 Myr, while 2/3 of the YSO are â¤3 Myr. When looking at the spatial distribution of these two populations, we find evidence of a potential age gradient across the field that suggests sequential star formation. We construct the IMF and show that we can sample the mass distribution well into the brown dwarf regime (down to ~0.01 Mâ). The logarithmic mass function rises to peak at ~0.3 Mâ, before turning over and declining into the brown dwarf regime. The total cluster mass derived is estimated to be 78 Â± 18 Mâ, while the ratio derived of brown dwarfs to star is 18 Â± 5%. When comparing it with other young clusters, we find that the IMF shape of the young cluster embedded within RCW 41 is\n\nRuddlesden-Popper interface in correlated manganite heterostructures induces magnetic decoupling and dead layer reduction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBelenchuk, A.; Shapoval, O.; Roddatis, V.; Bruchmann-Bamberg, V.; Samwer, K.; Moshnyaga, V.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe report on the interface engineering in correlated manganite heterostructures by octahedral decoupling using embedded stacks of atomic layers that form the Ruddlesden-Popper structure. A room temperature magnetic decoupling was achieved through deposition of a (SrO)2-TiO2-(SrO)2 sequence of atomic layers at the interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 films. Moreover, the narrowing of the interfacial dead layer in ultrathin La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 films was demonstrated by insertion of a single (SrO)2 rock-salt layer at the interface with the SrTiO3(100) substrate. The obtained results are discussed based on the symmetry breaking and disconnection of the MnO6 octahedra network at the interface that may lead to the improved performance of all-oxide magnetic tunnel junctions. We suggest that octahedral decoupling realized by formation of Ruddlesden-Popper interfaces is an effective structural mechanism to control functionalities of correlated perovskite heterostructures.\n\nCombining dynamical decoupling with fault-tolerant quantum computation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNg, Hui Khoon; Preskill, John; Lidar, Daniel A.\n\n2011-07-15\n\nWe study how dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences can improve the reliability of quantum computers. We prove upper bounds on the accuracy of DD-protected quantum gates and derive sufficient conditions for DD-protected gates to outperform unprotected gates. Under suitable conditions, fault-tolerant quantum circuits constructed from DD-protected gates can tolerate stronger noise and have a lower overhead cost than fault-tolerant circuits constructed from unprotected gates. Our accuracy estimates depend on the dynamics of the bath that couples to the quantum computer and can be expressed either in terms of the operator norm of the bath's Hamiltonian or in terms of themoreÂ Â» power spectrum of bath correlations; we explain in particular how the performance of recursively generated concatenated pulse sequences can be analyzed from either viewpoint. Our results apply to Hamiltonian noise models with limited spatial correlations.Â«Â less\n\nGazing at the ultraslow magnetar in RCW 103 with NuSTAR and Swift\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBorghese, A.; Coti Zelati, F.; Esposito, P.; Rea, N.; De Luca, A.; Bachetti, M.; Israel, G.

L.; Perna, R.; Pons, J. A.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe report on a new NuSTAR observation and on the ongoing Swift XRT monitoring campaign of the peculiar source 1E 161348-5055, located at the centre of the supernova remnant RCW 103, which is recovering from its last outburst in June 2016. The X-ray spectrum at the epoch of the NuSTAR observation can be described by either two absorbed blackbodies (kT_{BB_1}Ë 0.5 keV, kT_{BB_2} Ë 1.2 keV) or an absorbed blackbody plus a power law (kT_{BB_1} Ë 0.6 keV, Î Ë 3.9). The observed flux was Ë 9 Ã 10-12 erg s-1cm-2, Ë 3 times lower than what observed at the outburst onset, but about one order of magnitude higher than the historical quiescent level.

If such decoupling is possible, it means that GDP growth is a sustainable societal goal. Here we show that the decoupling concept can be interpreted using an easily understood model of economic growth and environmental impact. The simple model is compared to historical data and modelled projections to demonstrate that growth in GDP ultimately cannot be decoupled from growth in material and energy use. It is therefore misleading to develop growth-oriented policy around the expectation that decoupling is possible. We also note that GDP is increasingly seen as a poor proxy for societal wellbeing. GDP growth is therefore a questionable societal goal. Society can sustainably improve wellbeing, including the wellbeing of its natural assets, but only by discarding GDP growth as the goal in favor of more comprehensive measures of societal wellbeing.

The analysis of each epoch yielded five distinct plotted parameters for the left hand twist grip and right hand sidestick controller output time series. These two control devices allow the left hand to generate vertical translation, direct lift, or pitch-pointing commands that are decoupled from those of the right hand. Attention is given to the control patterns obtained for decoupled normal flight, air-to-air gun engagement decoupled maneuvering, and decoupled air-to-surface bombing run maneuvering.\n\nDensity-matrix description of heteronuclear decoupling in A mX n systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcClung, R. E. D.; John, Boban K.\n\nA detailed investigation of the effects of ordinary noise decoupling and spherical randomization decoupling on the elements of the density matrix for A mX n spin systems is presented. The elements are shown to reach steady-state values in the rotating frame of the decoupled nuclei when the decoupling field is strong and is applied for a sufficient time interval. The steady-state values are found to be linear combinations of the density-matrix elements at the beginning of the decoupling period, and often involve mixing of populations with multiple-quantum coherences, and mixing of the perpendicular components of the magnetization with higher coherences. This description of decoupling is shown to account for the \"illusions\" of spin decoupling in 2D gated-decoupler 13C J-resolved spectra reported by Levitt et al.\n\nTALE proteins search DNA using a rotationally decoupled mechanism.\n\nPubMed\n\nCuculis, Luke; Abil, Zhanar; Zhao, Huimin; Schroeder, Charles M\n\n2016-10-01\n\nTranscription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins are a class of programmable DNA-binding proteins used extensively for gene editing. Despite recent progress, however, little is known about their sequence search mechanism. Here, we use single-molecule experiments to study TALE search along DNA. Our results show that TALEs utilize a rotationally decoupled mechanism for nonspecific search, despite remaining associated with DNA templates during the search process. Our results suggest that the protein helical structure enables TALEs to adopt a loosely wrapped conformation around DNA templates during nonspecific search, facilitating rapid one-dimensional (1D) diffusion under a range of solution conditions. Furthermore, this model is consistent with a previously reported two-state mechanism for TALE search that allows these proteins to overcome the search speed-stability paradox. Taken together, our results suggest that TALE search is unique among the broad class of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins and supports efficient 1D search along DNA.\n\nDecoupling in linear time-varying multivariable systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSankaran, V.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for the decoupling of an m-input, m-output, linear time varying dynamical system by state variable feedback is described. The class of feedback matrices which decouple the system are illustrated. Systems which do not satisfy these results are described and systems with disturbances are considered. Some examples are illustrated to clarify the results.\n\nA Suzaku Observation of the Neutral Fe-line Emission from RCW 86\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nUeno, Masaru; Sato, Rie; Kataoka, Jun; Bamba, Aya; Harrus, Ilana; Hiraga, Junko; Hughes, John P.; Kilbourne, Caroline A.; Koyama, Katsuji; Kokubun, Motohide;\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe newly operational X-ray satellite Suzaku observed the supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 86 in February 2006 to study the nature of the 6.4 keV emission line first detected with the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astronomy (ASCA). The new data confirms the existence of the line, localizing it for the first time inside a low temperature emission region and not at the locus of the continuum hard X-ray emission. We also report the first detection of a 7.1 keV line that we interpret as the K(beta) emission from neutral or low-ionized iron. The Fe-K line features are consistent with a non-equilibrium plasma of Fe-rich ejecta with n(sub e) less than or approx. equal to 10(exp 9)/cu cm s and kT(sub e) > 1 keV. We found a sign that Fe K(alpha) line is intrinsically broadened 47 (35-57) eV (99% error region). Cr-K line is also marginally detected, which is supporting the ejecta origin for the Fe-K line. By showing that the hard continuum above 3 keV has different spatial distribution from the Fe-K line, we confirmed it to be synchrotron X-ray emission.\n\nUnderstanding the Links among the Magnetic Fields, Filament, Bipolar Bubble, and Star Formation in RCW 57A Using NIR Polarimetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEswaraiah, Chakali; Lai, Shih-Ping; Chen, Wen-Ping; Pandey, A. K.; Tamura, M.; Maheswar, G.; Sharma, S.; Wang, Jia-Wei; Nishiyama, S.; Nakajima, Y.; Kwon, Jungmi; Purcell, R.; MagalhÃ£es, A. M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe influence of magnetic fields (B-fields) on the formation and evolution of bipolar bubbles, due to the expanding ionization fronts (I-fronts) driven by the H II regions that are formed and embedded in filamentary molecular clouds, has not been well-studied yet. In addition to the anisotropic expansion of I-fronts into a filament, B-fields are expected to introduce an additional anisotropic pressure, which might favor the expansion and propagation of I-fronts forming a bipolar bubble.
