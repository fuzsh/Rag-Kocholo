I am a first generation American--one of five children born to Italian immigrants. My father left Naples, Italy in 1905 at 15 years of age and went to New York, where he moved in with a relative for a year or so. From New York he went to Milwaukee and then to Rock Island, Illinois, where he met my mother. She came to America in 1912.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nBelgian Neighborhood\n\nThe ethnic makeup of my neighborhood was mostly Belgian. There was a Belgian consulate in the next town over. My school mates and playground friends were mostly first generation Belgian Americans. It was a safe place to grow up. We were next to the Mississippi River and went swimming and fishing a lot. We were about five blocks from a city refuse center so we knew what trucks to follow to get a lot of good stuff. One day a pharmaceutical truck showed up and threw out a lot of old drugs, including several cases of Exlax. We peeled off the labels and filled our pockets.\n\nAlong came our friend, Peanuts Knoefrl. He walked and ran like he was climbing steps. He asked, \"What did you find?\" We said, \"Hershey bars.\" He asked for some so we filled his pockets and Peanuts started eating the stuff with both hands. We were all walking toward the park several blocks away when Peanuts said that he had to go to the bathroom. He started to run toward home, then he hesitated for a moment and then just kept on running. Peanuts did not go to school for several days. When we saw him later, he looked like a whooping crane. He told us that he had been in the hospital and the doctor had told him that the Hershey bars were Exlax. We pleaded innocent.\n\nPeanuts joined the Marine Corps after high school. One hot day in Korea our company was walking alongside of a road and the 5th Marines were on the road across from us. There was a guy walking toward us from the opposite side of the road and he walked like he was climbing stairs. I thought that it just had to be Peanuts--and it was. We met in the center of the road and hugged each other. I asked him if he would like a Hershey bar and he said, \"Hell no!\" Peanuts stayed in the Marines after the Korean War and was killed in Vietnam at DaNang.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nSt. Joseph School\n\nI went to St. Joseph School in Rock Island from 1st to 8th grade. This school was run by nuns who believed in quality education under strict discipline. They came from a religious order founded in Ireland in 1830. They had BVM behind their names. This was an abbreviation of \"Blessed Virgin Mary.\"\n\nThe nuns were meaner than junkyard dogs. They had 50 students to a class and you could hear a pin drop. We were all too scared to cause anything that would upset the teacher. The boys sat in one section of the class and the girls in the other section of the class. If a boy spoke to the girl across the aisle from him and the nun caught him, she made him carry a big ugly rag doll all day. If she caught one of the boys doing this for the second time, she not only made him carry the doll, but she let him out of class several minutes early and he had to stand outside of the building in front of the exit doors and 600 students walked by us. This made the boys hate the girls. If a girl was caught talking to a boy during class, both the girl and the boy had to go up to the head of the class, they had to put their hand out palm up, and the nun would smack both with a ruler.\n\nAfter the 4th grade the girls had to wear uniforms that all looked alike. The boys all had to wear ties. If by chance one of the boys forgot to wear a tie, the nuns had a replacement tie that they would pin on him. It was a huge red bowtie made out of paper and it stuck out past the shoulders. Boys who forgot their tie had to wear this for the rest of the day. I don't know of a boy who had to wear this more than once. The first thing that I put on when I was getting dressed for school was my tie.\n\nWhen the nun asked what we wanted to be when we were adults, most of the boys said they wanted to be a policeman or pilot or a fireman. I said I wanted to be a priest. I thought if I told them that, they would be gentle with me when they hit me with their ruler, but I don't think it worked.\n\nWe went home every day with an armload of books. We had about three hours worth of homework. While the kids in public school were having fun and enjoying life after the school day was over, those of us from St. Joseph's were locked in doing home work. It was very depressing.\n\nDuring mid morning we had a restroom break. We all walked down the stairs and stood at attention, one pupil on each step. The girls were on the other side of the stairway, and there was a wall in the center of the stairs. The nun positioned herself to watch both sides of the steps. First we took a drink of water. Then one student at a time went to the restroom. When the student in the restroom was done, he went back up the stairs and then the next student got a drink of water and went to the restroom. This was repeated until the last student had a drink and had gone to the restroom. I was never in the restroom with another student. We also did not get a second drink of water. If we did, we would get hit with the ruler.\n\nIn 1943 the boys and girls had a contest on the blackboard. When one or the other was done with the problem, they went to their desk in a military manner. The students did not go directly to their desks. They had to go to the end of the room, turn left to the next wall, then turn left and go up the aisle to their desk--never walking in front of anyone. There was a pretty girl named Rita who looked like Shirley Temple. I had kind of a hankering for her, although she didn't know it. One day she walked behind me and for some insane reason I stuck my foot out. She tripped over it and fell flat on her face. The nun who was in the back of the room sitting on a stool with a ruler came racing up the aisle toward me. I gritted my teeth, waiting to get the hell beat out of me. Instead, she beat the kid next to me into the ground like a tent peg. I think he thought he had made a mistake on the blackboard. I was petrified. I wanted to say, \"Stop. I did it\", but I was too scared. For several weeks this bothered me.\n\nOn graduation day from eighth grade we had a ceremony. Monsignor Durkin gave a little speech telling us we were the leaders of tomorrow and to go to Mass and obey our parents. After this little speech we were given a stale doughnut and a weak cup of cocoa. I was still bothered about the fact that someone else took a beating for tripping Rita when I was to blame, so as a matter of conscience I went up to the nun who did the beating. Her name was Sister Mary Judette. She was lanky and had bright red eyebrows. I said, \"Sister Mary Judette, remember when you beat Richard up for tripping Rita?\" She said, \"What about it?\" I said, \"Richard did not trip Rita.\" She asked who did and I said I did. She screamed, \"You did!\" and sucker punched me in the teeth. \"You let someone else take the blame?\" She said I was going to reform school. I said, \"I am in reform school.\" I do believe that if the room had not been crowded with people, she would have taken another punch at me. I went to 9th grade at a public school. FREE AT LAST!\n\nIn all fairness to the nuns, they did give us a good education and gave us a sense of values that endures to this day. We were thought to speak coherently, factually, and to be prepared to prove what we say before we say it. Now people make throw-away statements and they say, \"Prove me wrong.\" This is opposite of the way the nuns taught us. I know college graduates that would not have graduated from 8th grade at St. Joseph School. I would like to reach back in time, borrow Sister Mary Judette's ruler, and slap some of these retards along side of the head. St. Joseph School has been demolished now and on the site is the new Rock Island County Jail. If the nuns were in charge of the county jail, I know there would not be any repeat offenders in it.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nEnlisting\n\nI was one of three sons and all three of us served in the military. In 1940 one of my older brothers went into the Army and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. After he retired from the Army he went into teaching and received a Doctorate degree in history. My oldest brother joined the Navy in 1942. I became a member of the 21st Engineer Battalion when I joined the Marine Reserve in May of 1950 in Moline, Illinois. The USMCR center was located on River Drive in Moline.\n\nHow I happened to join the Marine Corps Reserve is that a friend of mine asked me if I would like to join the Marine Corps Reserve with him. I said, \"Okay. It sounds interesting.\" I found out later that his brother was doing some recruiting for the reserve center in Moline, Illinois. He said, \"I will meet you there at the next meeting night.\" I went to the reserve center and signed up. My friend never did show. When I called him later, he said he would make the next meeting. He never did show up for that one either. He did join the Naval Reserve.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nWar Breaks Out\n\nThe Korean War started June 25, 1950. The Marine Corps was short of troops and desperate to have boots on the ground as quickly as possible in Korea when communist North Korea invaded South Korea. Reservists activated in the early days of the war in August of 1950 were sent directly to Camp Pendleton, California, skipping basic training for rudimentary field drills. They joined the ranks of the World War II veterans sent to Korea.\n\nMy records show that on August 17, 1950, our unit--the 21st Engineer Company, was transferred into Casual Company, Headquarters Battalion, Training & Replacement Command. The next day we all boarded a train at Rock Island, Illinois for Camp Pendleton, California. I didn't know what was in store for me, but I was ready for almost anything, thanks to my pre-boot camp training by the nuns at St Joseph School.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nTrain Trip to California\n\nCamp Pendleton\n\nCamp Pendleton was one of the largest Marine bases in the world. The base was almost empty when we arrived. It had a fire brigade and little else. It had hundreds of barracks and other buildings, all with boarded-up windows. The water was turned off and there was five years of dust over everything. We had to turn on the water, knock the boards off the windows, wash them, scrub the decks, and light all the water heaters in all the vacant buildings.\n\nThere were armed guards at the mess hall to keep reservists out. There were no provisions to feed the thousands of reservists that arrived daily. Field stoves and picnic tables were set up to serve chow. For breakfast we got two pancakes, one orange, and coffee. For lunch we bought bread and lunchmeat at the PX. We shared with those who did not have money to buy their own lunch. For supper we got two baloney sandwiches, one apple, and coffee. I made a phone call to my brother in San Diego and asked to borrow $5.00 so I could purchase food. More mess halls were opened later.\n\nWe could not leave the base until we got assigned to a unit. One day they called us out on a parade ground where an officer with a bull horn asked for those with former military service to \"stand as you are.\" (I stood fast.) He said, \"Those who did not go to boot camp in any service fall out to the right.\" Those who had previous service went to Tent Camp 2. The camp actually had Quonset huts, not tents. They issued M-1 rifles to us and we spent a day or so taking the M-1 apart. We had to do it blindfolded. We then spent several days shooting the rifle at stationary and moving targets. It was a fun time.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\n\"Cruising\" on the Collins\n\nAround November 15, 1950, we, the third replacement draft, boarded the E.T. Collins at San Diego, California. There were about 1700 of us. I thought it was an ugly ship. To me it looked like a bunch of square boxes stacked on top of each other. We had to walk by crowds of civilians that were family members and friends of departing troops.\n\nAfter we boarded the ship we went down to troop bay to stow our gear. This ship was a four-stacker; that is to say, the bunks were stacked four high. I had the bottom bunk in my row. It was about a foot from the deck. After we put our gear away we all went on deck. The troops who had friends and relatives on the dock crowded the first two decks, all waving and yelling at each other. I had no one to see me off so I went up to the third deck, which was not crowded, to watch the interaction. After a while I heard my name called several times. I searched the crowd to see who could be calling my name. I saw a friend of mine who was a schoolmate from Rock Island. His name was John Dingeldine. It was a welcome surprise. He was in California with his sister to visit his brother-in-law who was a Marine Reservist who was activated and stationed at Camp Pendleton about 30 miles away. John being there to see me off is one of my fondest memories. It was the first time I had left home. I still see John.\n\nThe E.T. Collins pulled away from the dock after dark, maybe about 10 p.m. It was a moonless night and we could see the harbor lights. The song Harbor Lights was a popular song at that time. Someone had a battery-operated radio and the song playing was Harbor Lights. It was an emotional few minutes. I remember it yet and when I hear the song Harbor Lights, to this day I get a little nostalgic.\n\nIt was a 15-day voyage across the Pacific. I was sick most of the way. My friend John Fielding, who was in the bunk above me, was well enough to bring me back an orange from the mess hall every day. I crossed the Pacific, most of the way, on a dozen oranges. On Thanksgiving Day I felt better and got in the chow line. When it was my turn to be served they ran out of turkey, but the mashed potatoes, dressing and cranberry sauce were great.\n\nA couple of days after Thanksgiving, Chinese Communist forces attacked the U.S. 8th Army, starting the longest military retreat in U.S. history. They surrounded the First Marine Division. The Marines had to fight their way to the sea destroying a Chinese Army in the process. This was one of the greatest military achievements in our military history. By destroying this Chinese Army it gave relief to the U.S. 8th Army in their fight for survival.\n\nThose of us onboard the E.T. Collins were told that we were going directly to Korea to be replacements for the 1st Marine Division. The Marines practiced aboard ship, firing machine guns, mortars, and rifles off the fantail of the ship. We were told later that we were going to Japan instead of Korea to get cold weather equipment and clothing.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nStopover in Kobe\n\nWe arrived at the seaport of Kobe, Japan and went to an old World War II Japanese military base, Camp Otsu, 30 miles inland. It had a lot of stucco buildings and we were about ten to a room, but it was a snug and comfortable fit. The first day we just got adjusted and familiar with our surrounds. The next day we were given cold weather clothing (long underwear, heavy socks, gloves, parkas, fur-like hats and wood sweaters). We had no military training in Japan.\n\nWe had one afternoon to see the town, but had to be back at midnight. We boarded a train the next day and got off to a seaport where we boarded another ship and headed for Pusan, Korea. When we arrived at Pusan there was an Army military band waiting for us. One of the songs they played was, So Long, It was Good to Know You (a little gallows humor).\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\n3rd Replacement Draft\n\nI arrived in Korea with the 3rd replacement draft the first week of December 1950. Upon arrival we went to the \"Bean Patch.\" This was a very large field that was used for an assembly area for the Marine and Army divisions near the town of Masan, not far from the sea port of Pusan. There were no beans in this field when we were there, but there might have been at some previous time.\n\nWe waited there several days for the 1st Marine Division to show up. When we arrived we were lined up and assigned to infantry companies according to the first letter of our last names. If your name started with E, F, or G, you were assigned to Dog Company 7th Marines. Our MOS (military occupation specialty) made no difference in our assignment. Whether someone was formerly an aircraft mechanic, a signalman, a tank driver, engineer or artilleryman, didn't matter. Now we were all riflemen. We were assigned to tents with no cots or stoves. We just lay on the ground with our sleeping bags. Before Korea I had gone hunting with my .22 caliber rifle. In one way or another, you could say that we were all combat ready when the 3rd Replacement Draft arrived in Korea. Our combat record proves that we were the best troops in Korea.\n\nDog Company survivors of the horrific Chosin Reservoir campaign arrived at the Bean Patch about December 12, 1950 with 12 to 15 Marines and no officers. They looked like men who had been in combat too long--thin, tired, grateful they had survived, and proud of their accomplishments. I got to be personal friends with some of them as we served together for another six months. Jack Larson, Tom Cassis, Matt Davis and Larry Hickey got to be my personal friends.\n\nAnother of the Chosin Reservoir survivors was a machine gunner whose gun had been overrun. He played dead while a Chinese soldier took his watch and then started to take his ring. The Chinaman had trouble getting it off and was about to cut the machine gunner's finger off when a Chinese officer made him stop looting and get moving. The gunner walked back to Marine lines and was among the group of survivors. He told me that he would not go back on the line and said that if he had to, he would shoot himself in the foot--which he did. We helped him to the aid tent. The corpsmen were playing cards and did not even look up. They kept playing cards and said for us to set him in the corner next to another guy who had also shot himself in the foot.\n\nWe replacements were less than enough to fill the ranks, but the first of January 1951 we got the 4th replacement draft and that was about enough to go on line. As I remember, we had a Buck Sergeant who had been captured on Wake Island during World War II as our Company C.O. We had him for the first several weeks as our C.O. until we got officer replacements.\n\nOf the men in the startup of the 7th Marine Regiment, 35 percent were from the Marine Reserve units. Many Reservists had not been to boot camp or had prior military service. Those who were assigned to crew-served weapons held classes and training aboard ship. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd replacement drafts had large groups of men with no prior military training, including me.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nPohang Guerrilla Hunt - Mid January to Mid February\n\nIn the UN drive north from the Pusan Perimeter, the 10th North Korean Division was bypassed. They turned into a guerrilla force which caused havoc among UN forces and civilian population. They dressed like civilians and blended in with the South Korean refugees so they could receive cover from them. We watched the civilians for males of military age and had fairly good luck in finding some of them. We found radios on some of them that they were using to call mortar fire on us. We sent the found guerrillas to the rear under escort and they went to a compound for questioning and POW camp. Only adult males were captured.\n\nThe Marines received the 3rd and 4th replacement drafts and were then up to strength to go on line and eliminate this hostile force. This campaign was called the \"Pohang Guerrilla Hunt.\" It should have been named the \"freeze and starve hunt\". It was a physical nightmare. There was not much combat, but physically it was a test of human endurance. It was bitterly cold and the ground was frozen rock solid. We chased North Koreans from one hilltop to another. We had to dig in frozen ground, move to the next hilltop, and do it all over again. To make matters worse, we did not eat every day and supplies did not get to us because we were always on the move. We were very cold, very tired, and always hungry. Food is fuel and in the bitter cold we were near freezing. We did not know about wind chill then. The wind was always blowing on the mountain tops and we soon became aware of what \"wind chill\" was.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nFebruary 10, 1951\n\nWhile on a company combat patrol near Chigadong, Korea, I was in the point fire team, walking along a narrow path at the base of some very steep rock hills. A frozen creek was about five feet below the path. While walking around a sharp curve, some automatic gunfire hit the Marines behind us. The North Korean troops were disciplined in the fact that they let the point slip by and fired into the center of the column. This was where the forward observers and officers normally were. Those of us in the point dove into the frozen creek bed. Although we were banged up when we hit the ice, we survived.\n\nOne of the Marines hit and severely wounded during this action was a forward observer for artillery. Lt. Charles T. Hinman was a reservist from my reserve center, the 21st Engineer Company. Also wounded on Okinawa during World War II, Lieutenant Hinman was from my hometown of Rock Island, Illinois. He and the platoon leader were hit at the same time on February 10. Although Lieutenant Hinman was hit in his thigh and leg, he took over the platoon after the platoon leader was wounded. He directed artillery fire on the enemy position. He later received a Silver Star for his gallantry in action that day. The citation reads as follows:\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry...in action against the enemy while serving (as a forward observer) with a Marine infantry company in Korea on February 10, 1951. While proceeding along a narrow uncovered trail on an independent mission near Chigadong, Korea, was taken under fire by deeply entrenched, well camouflaged enemy positions located on the high ground less than 100 yards from the trail. He, with complete disregard for his own personal safety, continually exposed himself to savage enemy automatic weapons fire in order to gain a better position from which to direct artillery fire against the enemy positions. When the platoon leader was seriously wounded, Lieutenant HINMAN took over the platoon and skillfully deployed them and directed their fire against the enemy forces. Though painfully wounded in the thigh and leg, Lieutenant HINMAN refused to be evacuated and continued to direct the platoon and give instructions for the placing of the artillery fire on the enemy positions. His aggressive actions and devotion to duty materially contributed to the success achieved by his company.\"\n\nFebruary 12, 1951\n\nNight patrols were rare. The night time belonged to the opposition. Korea had no city lights to bounce off the clouds to give even the faintest illumination. The night time in Korea was black, black to blue/black on moonless nights.\n\nWe were patrolling this village in pitch blackness, hoping to find unfriendly troops. We had no luck. Because we had no flashlights, we had to go to the back of the houses, touch the ground-level chimneys, and feel for warmth. If the stack was warm, that meant that the building either currently was or recently was occupied. The houses had radiant type heat. A small fire pit was at one end of the building, the heat and smoke went through the flues under the floor out the back--cooled, and then out of a wooden board chimney at the other end of the house.\n\nWalking around to the side of the house, I saw a red glow. It was a charcoal fire. A human form went by the red glow toward me and I jammed my rifle into the midsection of the form. For some reason, I could not pull the trigger. It was like someone had a hold of my fingers. The form turned out to be an old man with an old woman next to him. They did not want to leave their home, so they had stayed behind. It was a miracle that I\n\ndid not shoot him. I know this old man had a sore spot in his midsection where I shoved my rifle.\n\nOne night the whole company was moving to a new location under the cover of darkness. We were humping up a rather steep trail on a moonless night when we stopped to rest. With 80-plus pounds on our back, it was difficult getting up if we were sitting on the ground with this heavy pack, so we looked for a rock to sit on or to lean against something to make getting up easier. I saw a blue-black round shape along the side of the trail that looked like a round rock. I sat on this round object and discovered that it was a round bush. I went straight down a cliff and lit on my pack and helmet. If I had not had them on, I may have been killed. I lay on my back with the wind knocked out of me for a while but I knew that I had to catch up with my group or I would be left behind. I climbed up to the trail with difficulty. My biggest worry was not to startle any of the troops and mistakenly get shot as an enemy combatant.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nNiles Gugliano\n\nLate one afternoon the word was out that a large force of North Koreans was in the next village. We left in a hurry, leaving our parkas and sleeping bags and wearing just our field jackets in hopes of catching them. We crossed a mountain stream that was covered with thin ice. We broke through the ice into almost waist deep water. This stream was at the base of a hill that was 880 meters high (about 2700 feet). When we started up the hill, the temperature dropped. The wind started to blow and our clothes started to freeze to us. By the time we got to the top of the hill it was dark and the wind was at gale force. The temperature kept dropping and there was no sight of the enemy. We just sat up on that hilltop and froze. Kids tougher than nails were near tears and there was no sight of the enemy.\n\nSeveral hours later a weapons company showed up with their parkas and sleeping bags. No offer was made to share a parka or sleeping bag. They could have shared at least one or the other. I became the best of buddies with a Marine named Niles Gugliano from the hill in St. Louis, Missouri. He had a .38 caliber Colt revolver with a shoulder holster. We were sitting in the cold freezing and he said to me that he was going over to one of the heavy weapons guys to see if he could trade his Colt for the use of a sleeping bag for the night. He made the trade and came over to me with the sleeping bag. He let me put my feet in it. This sleeping bag was a life saver. Niles paid a heavy price for a rental for about six hours, but it saved our feet. The next morning when we started to go back down the hill, the guys could hardly walk. Some could not walk at all. Talking with Gonsolo Garza about that night, he said that he froze his feet and is now getting a disability for frozen feet. He was one of many with frost bite. There were 1700 non-battle casualties from frost bite, 19 killed in action, and less than 200 wounded in action.\n\nI cannot say enough good things about Niles Gugliano. While we were on this guerrilla hunt, I got the flu or something like the flu. I could hardly walk, let alone carry my 80-pound pack. Niles was a horse. He carried me and my pack up those hills and dug our foxhole by himself. He kept me alive. Niles had a girlfriend named Toni, whom he later married. She was a great Italian girl. She sent him the best food packages and he shared them with me. Niles has since passed away, but I still stay in touch with Toni. Thanks again, Toni!\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nFertilizer Business\n\nWe were told that we were going to go against Chinese forces at a place near Hoengsong. We heard the Army's 2nd Division troops were overrun in this area. About February 15 the Division packed up to leave Masan. This took several days and on the last day we covered up the heads (Marine/Navy term for outdoor toilets). The local farmers gathered around to dig this stuff up when we left. We had to have an armed guard to keep them away until we left the area. I was ordered to be one of the guards to keep the farmers at bay. How embarrassing could it get? The farmers were sitting on their heels with shovels and buckets. they looked like a bunch of ducks. As the Marines passed us to load onto trucks, everyone had some sarcastic and insulting remark to make: \"Guard that stuff with your life.\" \"Shoot to kill.\" \"You make the Marines proud.\" \"Did you have special training to get that job?\" And on and on. I said to my Marine partner, \"I am going over to the farmers and see if I can sell this stuff to the highest bidder.\" He said, \"Why not? Everything has value.\" I went to a farmer, pointed to the stuff, and in my best pigeon English asked, \"How muchie won?\" They knew what I meant and broke up into a half dozen competing groups. One farmer representing one of the groups came over to me holding a wad of won that looked very impressive, so we sold it and guarded it for that group. It was a great feeling as we told the smartass, insulting Marines all the money we got for the stuff. They were in shock. The word went up and down the line that we had sold it to the farmers and that they were to stay away as we were guarding it for the new owners. I wrote home and told my folks that I was in the fertilizer business. They were very proud.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nOperation Killer - 15 February 1951\n\nDuring what was known as Operation Killer, the First Marine Division was on its way to the Chungju/Hoengsong vicinity about 200 miles by rail and then by truck as part of the 10th Corps that was placed under operation control of General Moore of the IX Corps. Chinese forces had taken Hoengsong and were now in the outskirts of Wonju, a rather large city. At Taegu, we waited for transport to move us to Wonju to be integrated with other units of the IX Corps: the 24th Infantry, the First Cavalry, the 6th ROK (Republic of Korea) Division and the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade.\n\nWhile waiting for our transport, we sat on our packs and watched a French army unit arrive by truck. They stopped and took a break across the road from us. A small Korean boy walked past them and a French truck driver took a hat the boy was wearing from him. It had a Marine emblem printed on the front. Marine utility hats with the emblem were in demand by UN troops. The kid tried to get his hat back, but the truck driver kept shoving him to the ground. We watched this happen a few times, then two of us walked over and took the hat away from the truck driver and gave it back to the boy. The French soldiers started milling round us and our fellow Marines started walking toward us. The French soldiers got back in their trucks and the Marines went back and sat on their packs. The boy got his hat back and was very happy, and we felt good about ourselves.\n\n24 February 1951 - General Moore, Commanding Officer of the IX Corps, was killed in a helicopter crash. General Matthew Ridgway named General Oliver Smith as his successor, pending a permanent appointment. Only twice before in Marine Corps history had a Marine General commanded major army units. We were proud of General Smith and felt he was deserving of the command.\n\n3 March 1951 - The 7th Marines held the high ground south of Hoengsong. We could see our objectives, Hills 536 and 222, in the distance. We took them and started to dig in for the night. The ground was frozen solid and with our light entrenching tools we knew that we would be lucky to dig a piece of dirt the size of a golf ball. The First Platoon dug in under some pine trees. They looked like evergreen tents with deep pine needles on the ground. We were upset that we were not that lucky. We were on the north slope with no cover and the wind was fierce. Before we could even get a flat spot of ground dug out, Chinese artillery started dropping on top of us. Heavy stuff and lots of it! We hugged the ground as the shells screamed in and detonated in the frozen earth. The rock hard ground slammed into our bodies and knocked the wind out of us. We hugged the ground with our elbows and hands between our bodies and the ground to cushion the shock. It was very terrifying.\n\nI was told that the artillery barrage lasted about two hours, but to me it seemed like forever. The lush pine tree cover the First Platoon dug under was reduced to broken and splintered poles stripped of branches. Hanging in the broken trees one could see sleeping bags and parkas. The First Platoon had 44 men before the artillery fire began and when it was over it had been reduced to 14 Marines. I made a lot of promises to the Man Upstairs during the barrage. If I had just kept one of them, I would now be living in a monastery.\n\nWe found out later that the Chinese got the artillery from the Army's 15th Field Artillery and the 503rd Artillery Battalion at Hoengsong. This was very troubling to us. If the artillery units knew that they were going to be captured, they should have destroyed their weapons before the enemy had the chance to capture them. This Army artillery was used to kill Marines and soldiers a short time later.\n\nThe following information is quoted from Chapter XIV, \"The Battle for Hoengsong\", U.S. Army records:\n\n\"General Ridgway initially considered these high equipment losses evidence of weak leadership. General Almond was equally disturbed by the heavy loss of equipment, especially the loss of fourteen howitzers by the 15th Field Artillery Battalion and five by the 503rd, and by what he considered excessive personnel casualties among all 2nd Division units. General Ridgway said, 'The loss or abandonment to enemy of arms and equipment in usable condition is a grave offense against every member of this command. I shall hereafter deal severely with commanders found responsible and shall expect you to do likewise.'\"\n\nDog 7 went into a rest area for a few days to receive replacements from the 5th replacement draft and rest. We dug in next to a food and ammo supply dump that had armed guards patrolling the supplies. When we spotted some boxes of ground beef across the road, two of us got between the guards and \"confiscated\" a 60-pound box of frozen ground beef. There were three 20-pound packs of ground beef in a box. That would be 20 pounds for each fire team in our squad. Perfect! We started to eat hamburger patties the next day with C-ration crackers. It was great! The best food we had had in a long time.\n\n6 March 1951 - We went on line and started attacking enemy objectives. Our objectives were not defended. We got a free ride. We were now just little south and west of Hoengsong. This was to be our objective the next day. We gathered pine cones to start a small and near-smokeless fire to cook hamburgers. The weather was nice. It was just a few degrees below freezing and there was no wind.\n\n7 March 1951 - Light snow during the night and early morning. The snow came straight down and there was no wind. With the pine trees covered with snow, it was very picturesque. We had a sack of mail to drop off to Easy Company when we passed through their positions on our way to Hoengsong, which was in the valley below us. When we got to Easy Company they were in a firefight with a heavily defended enemy position. It was a hill between the two mountain ranges blocking the approach to Hoengsong. We watched the firefight from a short distance and we could see black figures falling in the snow. Those figures were Marines.\n\nFour Navy A1 Sky Raiders showed up and napalmed the enemy-held hill. All resistance stopped after the air attack. We proceeded up the hill with the mail. We walked by some Marine casualties covered with ponchos. If I remember correctly, I counted six bodies. The Navy A1's took all of five minutes to destroy the enemy positions at a cost of just a few gallons of gasoline. To survive in combat is a matter of luck and timing. For instance, the position that our platoon assaulted the day before was not defended. If the air assault had arrived sooner, there would have been less or no Marine casualties.\n\nAs we climbed the hill, we walked through the trenches that the napalm hit. It was like a scene out of Dante's Inferno. The Chinese defenders were turned into charcoal statues. They were killed instantly while aiming rifles toward the attacking Marines. The statues were looking down the barrels of what used to be rifles; the napalm had consumed the wood in the stock. The Chinese in the trenches were also black statues. The Chinese that were away from the trench were burned black and red with their skin rolled up. What a horrible weapon napalm is.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nMassacre at Hoengsong\n\nAfter we dropped off the mail and we started down the valley, my fire team was in the point. We walked toward Route 29, an elevated road that went through Hoengsong. In the distance we could see vehicles and artillery lying in different positions along the roadside. As we got closer, we also saw tanks in the ditch. As we got next to the trucks, we started seeing bodies stripped to their underwear. There were lots of bodies. We were in shock. We kept saying to each other, \"How could this happen?\" Tom Cassis, machine gun section leader in our platoon, said he saw 50 bodies laying in a group in their underwear. The Chinese and North Koreans had stripped the bodies of their cold weather clothing. The soldiers that surrendered were executed for the cold weather gear.\n\nIn this cold weather, the battlefield had been preserved and frozen in time. This action had taken place approximately 25 days before we arrived. The stripped bodies were laid out on the road like railroad ties in near perfect rows. It looked like a mile of bodies. Most may have been killed in combat, but it looked like many were executed. The roadway looked like corduroy with the bodies covered with light snow. Some tanks came up the road and stopped where we were standing at the head of the bodies. We milled around in shock at the massacre. Without warning, the lead tank started moving and ran over several bodies before we could stop it. The bright red flesh between the tank treads looked just like the ground beef we stole from the supply dump. We threw the hamburger away. Our appetite for it was gone!\n\nWe found out later that the American Support Force 21, which consisted of artillery and infantry with tank support, was attached to the 8th ROK Division, a command structure that required the total dependence on the ROKs for command and control. The normal command, the 2nd US Infantry, had no position in the chain of command. The Force 21 was co-mingled with the ROKs in charge. This co-mingling of US and ROK forces was an experiment from MacArthur's office and enforced by General Almond. This order was suicide for the Americans because the ROKs were completely unreliable. They had a record of bugging out without warning. The Marines always had a communication team embedded with the ROKs when they were on our flanks because they were not trustworthy. The ROKs would bug out and not tell anyone on their flanks. Marines always had a radio team to constantly check on the ROKs. The 2nd Army Division's Force 21 did not have a team embedded with the ROKs when the ROK's 8th Division, whose assignment was to protect the Americans, bugged out without telling the Americans. The Army's 2nd Division was surprised by the collapse of the 8th South Korean Division and suffered horrible losses on account of the lack of communications with and about the ROKs who just ran away and told no one.\n\nMilitary authorities later tried to hide the extent of the casualties in the Hoengsong Massacre, so actual figures are somewhat jumbled. Checking army records in Chapter XIV, \"The Battle of Hoengsong\", between midnight February 11, 1951 and daylight on February 13, 1951, the total killed American and Dutch was shown as 2,018. The Dutch had a 100-man unit as part of Support Force 21. Of them, 99 were killed in action and one was wounded in action. In all of Dutch military history, this was the first time ever that one of their units suffered 100% casualties with 99% killed. The Army lost fourteen 105mm howitzers, six 155mm howitzers, 277 crew-served weapons, six tanks, and 280 vehicles. The ROKs lost six 105mm howitzers and 901 crew-served weapons. ROK casualties were 9,844 killed between the 3rd, 5th, and 8th ROK Divisions. American units suffering losses near Hoengsong included the 38th and 17th Infantry, 15th, 503rd, 49th, 96th and 674th Field Artillery Battalions; 82nd Anti-aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion; and the 187th Airborne RCT.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nGary Turbak's Write-Up\n\nHistorian/Vietnam veteran Gary Turbak was a freelance writer based in Missoula, Montana until his untimely death on August 21, 2004. He wrote an article entitled, \"Massacre at Hoengsong\" that appeared in the VFW Magazine in February 2001. The VFW gave me permission to reprint Turbak's article in this section of my memoir:\n\n\"The grisly scene, horrible almost beyond belief, shocked even the toughest men of the 7th Marine Regiment. Some averted their eyes. Others broke off their macho banter to talk in hushed, church-line tones. It was death that spooked them--death that hung like an eerie cloud over the narrow valley north of Hoengsong, Korea, that cold, quiet day in 1951.\n\nIn early February, with the Chinese offensive stalled, U.N. commanders prepared a counter assault across the center of the Korean peninsula. This time, however, Republic of Korea (ROK) troops were to do the bulk of the fighting--with elements of various U.S. infantry, artillery and other units supporting them. The notion of Americans supporting ROK troops was very much an experiment--one U.S. military leaders later regretted.\n\nWhat U.N. commanders didn't know was that Communist forces also were launching a major offensive and had moved four Chinese and two North Korean divisions into the area north of the village of Hoengsong. On February 11, ROKs tangled with Communist forces, quickly disintegrating the planned South Korean offensive.\n\nAt one point, GIs of the supporting 15th Field Artillery (FA) Battalion (2nd Division) encamped for the night, relying on ROK infantry for protection. When the Chinese attacked in the dark, the South Koreans fled. The enemy swarmed over the U.S. position. Some 204 artillerymen ultimately died, resulting in one of the most concentrated losses of American lives in the entire war, according to Joseph Gould in Korea: The Untold Story.\n\nRetreating ROKs streamed south past U.S. support forces, allowing the Chinese to flank American positions. Soon, the Chinese owned the narrow, twisting valley north of Hoengsong and the road that ran through it--the only escape route.\n\nSteep hills rose up on both sides of the road, turning the valley into a shooting gallery. The Chinese relentlessly rained mortar fire down on the withdrawing and vastly outnumbered GIs. Later came the hand-to-hand fighting.\n\n'At times,' said one battalion commander, 'U.N. troops lined up on one side of the road and tossed grenades at the enemy attacking from the other side of the road.'\n\nFighting Withdrawal\n\nDuring one withdrawal, forward observer (for the mortar platoon) Sgt. Charles Long of M Company, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Division, chose to remain at his position atop Hill 300. It was rapidly being overrun, so he wanted to better direct mortar fire on the Chinese. For a while, he held off the enemy with rifle fire and grenades, but his last radio message reported that he was out of ammo. He used his last words to call for 40 rounds of high explosive fire on his own position, by that time swarming with enemy soldiers. For his bravery, Long posthumously received the Medal of Honor.\n\nAmerican rescue forces fought their way north from Hoengsong to the besieged units only to find that a river of Chinese soldiers poured in behind them. Points secured just an hour or so earlier reverted quickly to enemy hands.\n\nU.S. infantrymen tried to clear an escape route for the howitzers, supply trucks and other vehicles, but Chinese soldiers were everywhere. U.S. artillery fired point blank into ranks of attacking enemy, but it did little good.\n\nAs soon as the withdrawing GIs pushed through one Chinese strongpoint, they would run smack into another--while enemy forces reformed behind them. Some 2,000 Chinese troops manned one enormous roadblock. But the route south was the only way out. So the Americans continued to run this meat grinder of a gauntlet toward Hoengsong, taking heavy losses all the way.\n\nFinally, the column of weary survivors reached Hoengsong. GIs who made it to the village joined a more general and less hazardous retreat farther south and lived to fight another day. Yet in the little valley to the north there was only death.\n\nEnormous Graveyards\n\nOn March 7th, the 7th Marines re-entered the area north of Hoengsong for the first time since the rout three weeks earlier. Frozen in time--and frozen literally--the battle scene remained eerily preserved.\n\n'Everyone looked into the valley and saw the smoke twisting toward the sky,' wrote Marine Bill Merrick in his book Tan Vat. 'The smoke came from overturned trucks and jeeps. They had burned so long only the frames remained. The area looked like an enormous graveyard with the bodies unburied. The troops lay in the road, in the rice paddies, and in the cabs of the trucks that had not caught on fire.'\n\nHundreds of GI bodies remained where they had fallen. 'We had to push arms, legs, and heads to the side of the road so vehicles behind us would not run over dead soldiers,' wrote Marine Rod Bennett. Some GIs had been stripped naked by enemy soldiers. One naked, dead soldier lay across the barrel of an anti-tank gun. In many trucks, dead Americans lay behind the wheel or hung out the doors. One truck contained two lifeless GIs and two dead Chinese soldiers.\n\n'The road was blocked by a Sherman tank with one set of tracks blown off,' wrote Merrick. 'The hatch was open and the tank commander was hanging out of it. His jacket was full of holes, and blood made a big design on his back. Two GIs with their hands tied behind them had been shot in the back of the head. There were powder burns on the back of the caps they wore.'\n\nMarines, sickened by the sight, erected a sign along the body-strewn road. It read: 'Massacre Valley, Scene of Harry S. Truman's Police Action. Nice Going, Harry!'\n\nU.S. units suffering losses in the Hoengsong debacle included elements of the 38th and 17th Infantry; 15th, 503rd, 49th, 96th and 674th Field Artillery Battalions; 82nd Anti-aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion; and the 187th Airborne RCT.\n\nSeveral outfits incurred severe battle deaths. Korean War vet Dick Ecker, using the Army's Adjutant General's Korean War Casualty File, determined the following breakdown by unit:\n\n15th Field Artillery Battalion - 208 (106 KIA & 102 in captivity)\n\n503rd Field Artillery Battalion - 56 (27 KIA & 39 in captivity)\n\n38th Infantry Regiment - 462 (328 KIA & 134 perished in captivity)\n\nAmong the 15ths dead was its commander, Lt. Col. John Keith, and MSgt. Jimmie Holloway, both of whom died after being taken prisoner. 'Holloway was recommended for the Medal of Honor, but it was downgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross,' according to the 15th historian, Dan Gillotti.\n\nEcker summed it up succinctly: 'It was, of course, the nature of the fatalities in this action that was the real tragedy--many of them MIA, never found and declared dead or captured and died in captivity.'\n\nBecause military authorities tried to hide the extent of the disaster, casualty figures regarding the Hoengsong massacre are extremely jumbled. But according to a Time war correspondent, 'It was part of the most horribly concentrated display of American dead since the Korean War began.'\"\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nFrom Changbong-ni to Hoengsong\n\nPaul G. McCoy was a member of the 82nd AAA, B Battery, serving in Korea at the time of the massacre at Hoengsong. His account of what he saw and experienced appears on The Patriot Files website and is reprinted below:\n\n\"On 11 February, prior to midnight, we received word that the 8th ROK Division was under severe attack by Chinese forces. This soon turned into a collapse of the ROK units. and SF-21 started a delayed effort to load vehicles and attempt our own withdrawal. Our delay was caused by the complete loss of communications with the ROK unit we were supporting and a lack of control of SF-21 by US Forces. Our withdrawal did not start until 0200 hours, 12 February. By this time, the Changbong-ni area was inundated with fleeing ROK forces being closely followed by elements of several Chinese divisions.\n\nBy the time our column started its withdrawal, it came under sporadic machine gun fire and, as the intensity of the fire increased, the movement of the column became more disparate. At this time, I was ranked out of the front seat of my jeep by Captain Joyce, who was acting as assistant to Captain Stevens, our Commanding Officer. As we were not moving, I left the jeep to move up the column to find out what was wrong. I was not certain that my actions were particularly brave, but it certainly saved my life and provided me with knowledge as to how soldiers can act when they are completely uninformed.\n\nAs I moved up the line of vehicles, I discovered that there would be a group of 5-10 vehicles with a huge gap between the lead vehicle and the rest of the column. Each lead vehicle did not have a person in the driver's seat. It wasn't that these drivers had been killed in their vehicle, for they had apparently abandoned their vehicles. My mission became a task of finding drivers to get that portion of the column moving. In one case, I found 10-15 men huddled in the rear of a truck as if the canvas top would provide protection from the rapidly increasing enemy fire. I asked them if anyone could drive and one soldier admitted he could, but didn't have a driver's license. I broke normal military procedure in order to get the column moving. I estimate that 10 percent of the vehicles in that column were without drivers and were blocking the road at a time when rapid movement would have placed them a long way down the road to Hoengsong and safety.\"\n\nI finally worked my way past an M-16 which was the third vehicle in the column, and climbed on the rear deck of a tank which was not moving. The tank commander told me that he was stopped because the Lieutenant in the leading vehicle was stopping every time the tank fired its cannon. The next time the lead tank stopped, I climbed onto its rear deck and discovered that it had no commander--the gunner reported that the Lieutenant had abandoned his tank. I gave orders that they were to shoot and scoot at the same time, and not stop scooting until I ordered them to do so.\n\nAbout a mile down the road, just south of Nongoi, we had outrun the enemy fire, and I directed the lead tank off the road and advised the sergeant, now tank commander, to take the lead as soon as the rest of the column caught up with us. We waited for 10 minutes, and no one came up to join us. I then ordered the sergeant to take the lead and head down the road toward Hoengsong. I stood on the rear deck of the second tank with intentions of jumping off when we reached the first US unit so I could report what was happening.\n\nAs we approached the bridge north of Haktam-ni, the steep side of hill 310 was on the left of the narrow road, and a deep gorge with a small stream was on the right. The lead tank was hit with a burst of machine gun fire from a Chinese roadblock at the bridge. The tank pulled to its left into the steep side of hill 310. The tank I was on attempted to pull around the halted tank which had every possible gun firing. As we came beside the tank, ours was hit with a rocket launcher missile. I was blown off the vehicle and inside that tank all the crew had been killed. Two survivors from the first tank joined me on the road behind the two knocked-out vehicles which now completely blocked the road approach to the bridge.\n\nWe three survivors dropped down into the gorge on the left side of the road, and headed south, parallel to the road toward Haktam-ni. We attempted three times to cross the road onto more level terrain but each time we ran into enemy forces. Finally, just north of the bridge, we ran up against a cliff which we could not climb. Again, we made a very cautious attempt to cross to the east side, but just short of the road we stopped and must have spent 10 minutes trying to figure out what a small glowing red light on the road meant to our survival. When we got near enough we discovered it was an abandoned jeep with a large radio which had not been turned off. We quickly moved across the road and started crossing the river between hills 206 and 333. When we reached the middle of the river, flares started popping over our heads. It was difficult to keep the other two men from moving while the flares were glowing.\n\nOnce on the other side of the river, we made our way to the east of hill 206, then south towards the road from Saemal. In the process, we turned the flank of an infantry company from the 3rd Battalion of the 38th Infantry, which was guarding Saemal. After a short and terrifying period of proving that we were not Chinese, we were escorted to the Battalion HQ where I reported what happened. At this point, nothing I had seen indicated a massive Chinese attack, and I could not understand why the Battalion would not immediately go to the rescue of SF-21. At this time I was informed that the road between Saemal and Hoengsong had been cut off. This information and what I had seen made me realize how critical the situation had become.\n\nStragglers from SF-21 started arriving about mid-morning of 12 February. I found out that D Battery now consisted of only 25 or so men, and not more than 4 or 5 of its M-16s were in operating condition. At the same time, the perimeter came under very heavy attack. About noon we started a breakout with an infantry company on each side of the road with the remaining M-16s providing support to the infantry.\n\nOn one point on the road, a Chinese mortar had zeroed in on a bottleneck which could not be avoided. My M-16 went through the impact area, but the vehicle behind me appeared reluctant to follow. So, I left my vehicle, counted the pop from the mortar, and attempted to encourage the commander to follow. However, I missed a pop, and a mortar round hit my left foot. My momentum was sufficient to propel me out of the impact area, and a bit of crawling into a ditch provided some protection, at least until the Chinese put a machine gun into position so as to be able to rake the ditch.\n\nAt that time, I suggested to several men around a corner and out of the line of fire behind a building, that it would be appropriate to haul the wounded around that corner. This they did and then administered a dose of morphine, loaded me into a jeep and the others into a 3/4 to vehicle, gave me an M-1 rifle and a bandoleer of ammunition, and headed us on our way to Hoengsong. On that trip, one Chinese grenade hit the support bars for the canvas top of my jeep--I watched it explode beside the rear wheel and then thanked God that it was only a concussion grenade. On the left side of the vehicle, an enemy soldier with a burp gun started firing at us. With only my M-1 in a jeep with a rapidly shattering windshield, I could only aim with the front of the muzzle in front of the driver's nose and wait until the jeep moved into a position so I could fire at the enemy. The last round he fired went across the driver's belly, and passed through the upper portion of my thigh. At this point, I was perched on the small fender outside the jeep, my right leg was still in good shape, when another bullet passed through my calf, then between the driver and myself, while I continued hanging on.\n\nSoon the driver saw an M-16 ahead which was lumbering down the center of the road. The road had a sharp drop-off into the rice paddies on each side. After I asked if he thought he could pass around the M-16, we decided that the enemy fire was so heavy that we had no choice but to try. With the morphine slowing my reflexes, I did not draw my right leg into the jeep before my foot hit the rear of the M-16. The impact broke my right ankle.\n\nMy memory of what happened after that is not too reliable, but both vehicles made it into Hoengsong. Furthermore, after reading such phrases as \"massacre valley\", I gather that the carnage just north of Hoengsong was worse than that of the initial attack on SF-231. If so, the retreat from Saemal must have been a horrible example of a command failure by X-Corps. Many of my comrades in SF-21 were the unfortunate who died under the control of an inept ROK command structure and without access to US support and control. As some contemporary US Senators might say, \"Shame on you, General Almond.\"\n\nI remain one of the fortunate soldiers of SF-21.\"\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nDale Erickson, W/2/7 Remembers:\n\nOn March 7, W/2/7 was advancing along with the rest of the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Marines to new positions in East Central Korea near the little village of Hoengsong. We had been on the move for two or three hours on foot when we spotted some American bodies along the road out in a rice paddy. Then we saw another and another, some closer to the road. As we walked on, more bodies showed up. We had no warning. Then on the road we came upon a military truck with Army markings. Checking further, we saw four frozen bodies in the truck--all American soldiers, then more trucks and tanks. We started seeing bodies all over by the hundreds. Some of them were burned and naked. For every ten American bodies we saw there was one Chinese body. Government records show that about 700 Army personnel were killed and maybe executed in this narrow valley. Army records show that 2,018 American and Dutch were killed there February 11-13, 1951. One hundred of the victims were Dutch. Also lost in this valley were fourteen 105mm Howitzers, six 155mm Howitzers, six tanks and 280 vehicles of various types. It is believed that the Chinese forces used some of this captured equipment against us soon thereafter.\n\nA write-up of this action was written by Gary Turbak and published in the VFW Magazine in February 2001. He wrote: \"The grisly scene, horrible almost beyond belief, shocked even the toughest men of the 7th Marine Regiment. Some averted their eyes. Others broke off their macho banter to talk in hushed church-like tones.\"\n\nI know about this. I was there. We had our own vehicles, trucks and tanks moving with us on the same road. We came to a place where the road dropped off sharply on one side and the other side had a rock wall. We saw bodies that were frozen on and beside the road. We had to walk alongside of our own trucks and tanks while our vehicles crushed the bodies with wheels and treads, creating a crimson carnage that repulsed the souls of everyone that witnessed it. It was the most horrifying scene that anyone can imagine. As we walked along, there was not much space between the trucks and tanks and the rock wall. We could not step without stepping on a face or arm or hand. The road was thick with this carnage and my boots were covered with blood. I could not bear to see this anymore, so I grabbed onto the shoulder of the Marine ahead of me, closed my eyes, and stumbled along with him that way for I do not know how long.\n\nI must have blacked out because I do not remember what happened after that. W/2/7 engaged the enemy two days after we walked through the carnage and we took some casualties. I did not find this out until later because I had been evacuated to the hospital ship Repose. I woke up on the ship two days later. My body must have reached its limit and it took me out. It was too much to see. I could not take all the death and dead bodies. I could never get the blood off my boots after that. Part of that experience has stayed with me all of my life.\"\n\nInvestigation of Massacre\n\nA list of the Army casualties in the Hoengsong/Chipyong-ni/Wonju/Chaum-ni area shows the name of every man who was killed there from February 12 through February 14, 1951. It can be found by clicking here on the Korean War Educator website.\n\nAn investigation as to the cause of the massacre was held afterward. At first, General Almond said that it was lack of leadership from the American command. Blame for the fiasco was later put on the co-mingling of ROK and US forces, and the finger pointed toward MacArthur and Almond. The two Generals were, in part, responsible for us not winning the brutal infantry war in Korea--and now (2009), North Korea has the atomic bomb.\n\nThe Korean massacre at Hoengsong was done by enemy action, but the massacre was set up by a military failure from the American high command: General MacArthur and 10th Corps Commander General Almond. Putting American forces under the command of incompetent and unreliable South Korean Army leadership was an untried experiment doomed to failure, thereby sacrificing the lives of thousands of American troops on the altar of stupidity. Generals MacArthur and Almond, however, would not admit that they were responsible for the massacre. They reversed the results of the investigation, putting the blame instead on General Choi Yong Hee, Commander of the 8th ROK Division. The Chinese forces had crushed the 8th ROK Division, then ran along both sides of elevated Route 29 to set up roadblocks and trap UN forces.\n\nWhen the blame for the Hoengsong Massacre pointed back to MacArthur and Almond, they hid this atrocity from the public. During World War II, on December 16, 1944 near Malmedy, a Belgian town in the Ardennes, 81 American soldiers were murdered by German SS troops during the Battle of the Bulge. This atrocity was in every newspaper and on every radio station in the country. It was the worst single atrocity committed against American troops in Europe during World War II, and the world knew about it. Six years and two months later in Korea, on February 12 and 13, 1951, over 1500 American soldiers and 99 Dutch soldiers were killed in combat or executed, yet this massacre has been kept a secret all these years.\n\nDuring the offensive in the spring and early summer of 1951, we fought Chinese soldiers wearing US Army jackets with the 2nd Division patch. We reached into the pockets of the dead Chinese soldiers wearing Army jackets and took out letters and pictures from the folks at home talking about all the plans that were in store when they returned home. It brought tears to our eyes as we read the letters and looked at the pictures. It was heart-wrenching. We wanted so much to write the friends and families of these US soldiers and say, \"We killed the sob's that killed your dad, son, husband, brother or friend.\" We were told not to write to the folks at home because it would just create problems. We were told to turn the letters into Company officers and they would forward them to Graves Registration. To my knowledge, all of us did as we were told.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nLong March Days\n\nJack Larson\n\n(Click picture for a larger view)\n\n10 March 1951 - Dog 7 had three rifle platoons used as three individual combat units, each looking for unfriendly forces wherever they might be found. About midnight, 1st platoon radioed Dog 3rd platoon for assistance because they were being attacked by enemy forces. While going to help the 1st platoon, the 3rd platoon was attacked by Chinese grenadiers. This was a unit of the Chinese Army whose purpose was to throw grenades only, followed by the infantry with automatic weapons trying to punch holes in the opposing forces to get behind them and destroy them.\n\nSergeant Jack Larson was the Squad Leader of the squad that was hit by the grenadiers. The Chinese could not have picked a worse adversary. Sergeant Larson was calm, cool, and effective. He was seriously wounded by grenades, but in spite of his wounds, Sergeant Larson kept arranging his squad in various defensive positions that stopped the superior enemy forces. For saving his platoon, Sergeant Larson was awarded the Navy Cross. (Citation follows.)\n\n\"The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Sergeant Jack F. Larson, United States Marine Corps Reserve, for service as set forth in the following citation:\n\nFor extraordinary heroism while serving as a Squad Leader of Company D, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces south of Hongch'on, Korea, on 11 March 1951. Observing an excellent avenue of approach leading directly into the forward portion of his position while arranging the defense of newly won high ground following a bitter fight, Sergeant Larson conducted one fire team to an area covering the lane of access and, while digging in, was forced to withdraw when a hail of hostile automatic-weapons and small-arms fire rendered the site temporarily untenable. Occupying an alternate position until darkness, he returned to complete his defensive preparations despite continued enemy fire. When a large hostile force subsequently launched a vigorous assault, inflicting serious wounds on his comrades and himself, he braved intense enemy fire to remain at his post and, by skillfully manning his weapon, prevented the hostile troops from penetrating the sector and jeopardizing the entire company position. Despite severe pain from his wounds, he single-handedly withstood all enemy assaults for approximately two hours and, after the hostile assailants had been repulsed and his wounded comrades had received aid, consented to submit to treatment for his own wounds. By his inspiring leadership, indomitable fighting spirit and steadfast devotion to duty, Sergeant Larson contributed materially to the security of the company position, thereby upholding the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\"\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nChinese Possums\n\n11 March 1951 - On this day north of Hoengsong, we were on a platoon combat patrol looking for unfriendly forces. Darkness was approaching and we thought we would be digging in a defensive position for the night. We got near to the top of the mountain where all the ridges ran together into a large flat area. Up from this flat area was a long trench line that covered all the ridges. We stared at the trenches for a bit and then we saw a brown wave of Chinese troops running down the hill toward the trenches. We dropped our packs and also started to run toward the same trench.\n\nIt was a race for survival. We did not want to be caught in the open with the Chinese in the trenches shooting at us. The Chinese were laying back expecting artillery fire and air attacks, then the infantry assault. We did not have any artillery or air support. When the Chinese figured this out, they came out of hiding to get to the trench. They beat us to the elevated trench line, but not by much. They had a problem deflecting their rifles down on us as we were too close to them.\n\nTalking about this later, some Marines said they pulled rifles out of Chinese hands. Several of us got to the end of the trench line, jumped in undetected, and shot into the Chinese. They started to fall over like dominoes. They were trapped and could only run back from us, as the high and wide trench held them captive. It was such an adrenaline rush that it is hard to remember all that took place in those few minutes. Things were a blur. It was fortunate that we did not shoot one another. I remember cut-outs in the trench line where troops could seek shelter from air attacks. They started diving into the cut-outs like diving into a pool. I remember saying to myself, \"I wonder where they think they are going?\" It was kind of funny. The Chinese soldiers kept falling over in front of us and we kept running over them like sacks of potatoes. It seemed like when we shot into them, two or more fell over. We got to the end of the trench very quickly. Looking down the trench we could see Chinese soldiers in their brown quilted cold weather uniforms covering the bottom of the trench. It was now getting dark and we started to dig in for the night. This run through the trench line was such an adrenaline rush I could not sleep when it was my turn to do so. We could not wait for daylight to check our work.\n\nAt daybreak we walked over to the trench and to our great surprise we could see the bottom of the trench! There were bodies, but not as many as we thought. Our platoon leader, a efficient and gung ho officer, walked by us upset and agitated. He said, \"Do you want to know where they are? I will tell you. At daybreak they were at the bottom of the hill walking around the Colonel's tent with their hands up trying to surrender.\" We could visualize this. It was hilarious and we started to laugh. He said that it was not funny. He could get court-martialed for this because the Chinese could have wiped out our command post. We did our best to stop laughing, but he just got more upset and said to us, \"You have bayonets. Start using them.\" He said, \"I want all bodies stuck with bayonets, do you hear me?\" When he left, the Marine I was with said he must be kidding. He was not going to stick any gooks with his bayonet because he used his bayonet to open his jelly can. I agreed. Our platoon leader had been watching too many John Wayne movies.\n\nIn taking this trench line we had two killed and six wounded. That was not many; however, any lose of life was tragic. Considering the many Chinese troops that we engaged, this was not considered excessive. We did good work that day, but we did not get any \"atta boys\". Instead, we got chastised because many of the Chinese that we thought were dead had played possum and during the night went down the hill. At daybreak they were walking around the Colonel's tent trying to surrender. The Colonel was not happy and he did some butt-chewing. This was passed on to us.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nDivision Reserve\n\n17 March 1951 - We went into Division Reserve. This is good because we got to be in camp with the General. We had not been in Division Reserve before. Mostly we had been in Battalion Reserve, which had few creature comforts, and sometime we just went back to where the artillery was. We listened to outgoing artillery all night long, but it was going in the right direction.\n\nWe were in the rest area and dug in next to the Army's 92nd armored artillery battalion, whose members called themselves, \"The Red Devils.\" They were giving us artillery support. We were next to a creek when several flatbed Army trucks pulled up. Soldiers got out and started setting up cameras, some on the flatbed trucks and some on the creek banks--with one in the water. Some jeeps showed up and in the lead jeep, wearing dark glasses, a crushed down hat and a trench coat, was General MacArthur. He was known to us as, \"Back Track Mac.\" His jeep drove into the shallow creek and stopped for several minutes. The cameras started rolling and flashbulbs flashed. Then his jeep turned around and left with the trucks following him. A week later his picture was on the front page of Stars and Stripes. The headlines read, “General MacArthur visits the front.” The General should have been in vaudeville.\n\nWhen we got to the reserve area we were told we were going to be guarding the General's compound. This compound consists of four or five tents, most with heating stovepipes out the tops. It looked nice and homey. We slept under the stars in rain or snow with nothing but ponchos for a roof. The compound had a snow-like fence around it made of strips of wood held together with wire. It was very easy to roll up and move. We soon found that one of the tents we were guarding was a food supply tent. This was like making Jesse James night watchman at the train depot. We made plans….\n\nThe plan was that the squad on duty would direct the requisition group to the food tent and point out the specials. The first night we requisitioned canned ham, bacon, butter, red raspberry jam, fresh bread, milk, apples, oranges, and fresh eggs. This was the food of dreams for a Marine infantryman, especially apples and oranges. This food was the best I had had since I arrived in Korea. We did not have field kitchens like the Army had--at least not for the Marine infantry. We had a very primitive lifestyle. In our chow line they served us warmed-up beans, corned beef hash, beef stew and canned peaches or fruit cocktail. The food was just like our C-rations, only from larger cans. The C-rations were left over from World War II. They had been frozen during winter and heated in the summer for seven or eight years. It turned this food into garbage. The chocolate bar was turned into a white powder. C-rations were our staple and we felt lucky if we had enough of them.\n\nAbout mid 1951, C-rations were changed from World War II silver cans to new C-rations in an olive drab-colored can with some good stuff like chicken and rice, hamburger and potatoes with gravy, sausage patties, spaghetti with meat balls, ham and beans, and ham with lima beans. It was new and it was pretty good. Later we got field kitchens when we went into reserve and we got fresh milk, fresh fruit, and bread and butter. It was a long time coming. We all sat around a small fire eating the General's food and agreed that he had a great pantry. I personally must have eaten five or more ham and egg sandwiches on fresh bread, washing them down with milk and orange juice. This was without exception my fondest memory of my stay in Korea.\n\nThat night was my turn to be part of the \"requisition team.\" I received orders for pancake mix and maple syrup. After dark we went up to the guard in front of the compound and gave him a password like \"Jesse James\" or \"Cole Younger.\" We got a counter sign and were told that the General's cook was in the tent sleeping on a cot next to the stove. We carefully filled our orders and quietly left so as not to wake the cook.\n\nThe next morning, we were gathered around our cooking fire enjoying pancakes with real butter and maple syrup with bacon on the side, washing it down with milk, when a tall, stern-looking 1st Lieutenant and two Marines showed up. They had like-new utilities on and we looked like mutts next to them. The Lieutenant said in a commanding voice, \"I am not going to ask where or how you got all this food. I am ordering you to take it back. NOW! You people could be in a lot of trouble.\" Someone asked, \"Do we have to take all the food back?\" The Lieutenant said, \"I want everything that has not been opened returned,\" which for us was a great deal because we got to keep the leftovers. We returned the food while getting dirty looks from the two cooks. Needless to say, we lost our positions as perimeter guards for the General's compound.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nThree-man Foxhole\n\n24 March 1951 - After approximately six days in reserve, Dog 7 went back on line, attacking and pushing the commies back. We dug in for the night in two-man foxholes with fifty-percent watch, setting out bobby traps with two-man outposts in front of each platoon to prevent enemy infiltration. The next day we did it all over again. It was now early spring and the weather was getting warmer and the digging of foxholes was getting easier as the frost left the ground. We were occupying ground that American troops had occupied in the past. We now had pre-dug foxholes on the north slope, which saved lots of digging.\n\nWe found the perfect pre-dug foxhole; it was wide, long, and deep. We put our sleeping bags in place and started to get comfortable. The weather was getting warmer and there was a terrible stench about the place. The Chinese and North Koreans buried their dead on the ground where they fell, covering them with branches, leaves, and maybe a little dirt so we could not count their casualties. We started to police the area and found a dead Chinese soldier under some branches not far from us. We moved him downwind and went back to our dugout but the smell got worse.\n\nMy foxhole buddy was Matt Davis from South Central Texas. He was a very interesting person. Matt's family was formerly from Missouri. After the Civil War his family was on the wrong side of history, so they moved to Texas. Matt was a historian as well as a philosopher. No matter how cold, hungry and tired we were, Matt could reach back in history and compare us and our hardships with another group of soldiers long past who had it much worse than we did. He made us feel that we were part of a military tradition steeped in a thousand years of history. I said, \"Someday they will be talking about us.\" Matt's philosophy and uncomplaining attitude lifted our spirits and helped create the bonding that combat soldiers can relate to. Matt was wounded at the Chosin Reservoir. Sometime later he was wounded for the second time. When he was released from the hospital he was offered a job out of harm's way in a rear unit that was safe and sheltered. These creature comforts were an infantryman's dream, but Matt turned this down and demanded that he be returned to Dog Company. When we asked why he came back, he said that he would not feel right if he left his unit to serve with any other group. That was called bonding. About September 1951, Matt was wounded for the third time. He was hit by machine gun fire and was gravely wounded. I helped put him on a helicopter that was taking the wounded to the rear for medical treatment. The medical corpsman who was there at the time said that Matt would be dead before he could get to the aid station. However, by some miracle Matt lived (and he lived another 47 years).\n\nWe were told we would be staying in place as currently held for several more days waiting for our flanks to catch up. We started recon patrolling in front of our positions up to the start of the next mountain range. We could tell if it was the Chinese or North Koreans who had been there because when they relieved themselves they did not bury their business. Instead, it was a gift to the local farmers to put on their fields. The Chinese used toilet paper and the North Koreans did not.\n\nWe left the commies little \"gifts\", such as our worst-tasting cans of C-rations. For me it was the beef stew. This World War II ration was so old it tasted like candle wax. We left a few cans of this lying about, but took one empty can, slipped a grenade in the can (which was a tight fit), and pulled the pin. The tight fit kept the spoon from flying off and arming the grenade. We then set the can straight up, bottom open. When this can was picked up, the grenade fell out and the spoon fell off, activating the grenade. The commies had about four seconds for small talk.\n\nBack in our foxhole, the stench was getting unbearable. We got out of our dugout, started moving leaves around, and saw a small rubber tip sticking out of the floor of our foxhole. We dug around the object with our shovel and dug up a foot--then a leg with a Chinese quilted uniform on it. We had been sleeping on top of a dead Chinese soldier. I said, \"Matt, we have a three-man foxhole but only two of us are keeping watch.\" We moved next door with a freshly dug foxhole and we threw the dirt on top of the Chinese soldier. We were victims of a stinking Chinese dirty trick.\n\nThere were other patrols of interest that seem to run together in my mind as to their timing. I know that after we took an objective we started to patrol the villages and the territory around our recently acquired property. The Marines had a fetish for patrols. We wanted to know what was out there in our front yard.\n\nOne day on patrol we came upon a village on a cloudy and cold day. The people were in a long row in front of their huts and some of the women and children were crying uncontrollably. The entire group of village people was kneeling on the bare ground. I went up to a young boy and handed him a stick of gum. The boy never saw or had gum before. He stared at it for a second or so, not knowing what it was. His mother kneeling next to him hit him for his hesitation. The boy then put the gum in his mouth, wrapper and all, and started chewing. The Chinese had told the villagers that the Americans would kill them if they came to their village. We gave them some of our meager rations and left as friends.\n\nWe patrolled the next village a few miles away and the people came out to meet us very nervous and scared. The Commies had told them the same thing about Americans. We calmed them down and asked them about several males of military age whose legs were amputated below the knees. They were sitting on some straw. They said they were Chinese soldiers that had had frozen limbs. The villagers took them in and amputated their feet and legs without anesthesia. We walked over to them and gave them our C-ration cigarettes. The Chinese soldiers knew the meaning of tough times. We left this village as friends.\n\nOn another patrol late spring/early summer 1951, we went into a farmhouse to check it over. Inside there was a women with two children who appeared to be about three years old. They looked like twins dressed in their finest clothing. The mother was also dressed in her finest clothing. They were laying in a bed under a fancy quilt with the mother in the center. All were dead--most likely from cholera. In the next room was a man who was hanging by his neck--an apparent suicide. He did not want to live without his family. This to all of us was very sad.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nA Hero on Hill 430\n\nOn about the last week in March 1951, our platoon leader asked me to be his runner. A runner carried dispatches from one unit to another under combat conditions. It could be a very necessary and dangerous job. We now have other means of communication and this job is mostly being the foxhole's buddy. I did not want this job because I was bonded with my buddies in my four-man fire team. There were three of these units per squad if it was up to full strength, and we become bonded with our buddies in the fire team. They were our family and to leave it was like leaving home.\n\nI had to take the job of runner and some other Marine took my place in my fire team. I was not happy. On April 1st we were told that our 7th Marine Regiment was to be placed under the operational control of the Commanding General of the 1st Cavalry Division. We are now in the Army. We told our medical corpsman, Richard DeWert, that we would now have to call him \"the medic\", like in the Army and not \"the corpsman\", like in the Marines. He said that would be okay and wanted to know if we would now get cherry pie with our C-rations! This was a standing joke. The Army had civilian work parties who carried supplies to the troops on line, including food in big canisters. We said the canisters had steak and cherry pie in them. Richard said he really liked cherry pie.\n\nOn April 5th we crossed the 38th parallel, which was the dividing line between North and South Korea. It was a joint operation between Easy and Dog Companies. We took the ridge toward the south and Easy Company took the ridge toward the west, both going up to the same objective, Hill 430. This hill was a piece of ground about 1300-1400 feet high--an easy climb. The day was bright to partly cloudy. As we climbed the hill, the cloud formation turned into fog which at times made visibility very limited. Then the fog would clear and the hill would be very bright. Where the ridges meet at the top of the hill was where it was usually defended. That way all approaches could be covered by enemy gunners. My old fire team was in the point and when it reached the top, heavy machinegun fire and grenade explosions could be heard.\n\nI was about 40 yards from the point with our platoon leader, as I was his runner. In most cases we went up the ridges almost single file because of the narrow paths on the ridges. The fog had moved in and visibility was again very limited. Bullets from the almost invisible enemy were clipping tree branches. The fog worked both ways and we could not see each other, so we got very close to each other. I had moved next to the Marines who were being sheltered by a small ridge not more than two feet high.\n\nThe machinegun fire was heavy and continuous. Along with the noise of it we could hear someone screaming obscenities like, ”You dirty sons of bitches,\" over and over. Suddenly the fog shifted and it was very bright. It was like a movie. I could see Richard DeWert almost falling on top of the Marine doing the cussing. The corpsman had gone to the aid of the cussing Marine, who was shot in the knees and in great pain and shock. A short way from the fallen DeWert was a bunker with the enemy machine-gunners. It had a large aperture and was covering all approaches. Corpsman DeWert had gone under enemy fire four times to aid wounded Marines during the firefight and he had been shot multiple times.\n\nWithout thinking I ran up to the bunker, slid on my knees, and shot into the faces that I could plainly see. I then checked on DeWert, who was dead. Then I went to the still cussing wounded Marine. I dragged him behind some rock formation and out of harm's way. He called me every cuss word he could think of. A tough, no nonsense corpsman by the name of Fred Hardy told this wounded Marine that if he didn't shut his dirty mouth, he was going to drag his ass back up the hill and leave him there.\n\nWe as a group charged up the hill past the now-silent bunkers and up the trail that led to a group of Chinese rifleman. These Chinese, who were protecting the bunker and shooting at us, had to be the world's worst marksmen and they bugged out before we could get to them. When we gathered up our dead and wounded, I saw Chuck Curly, one of our machine-gunners, now a stretcher bearer, lift Richard DeWert's body onto a stretcher. Water was running out of his canteen from the bullet holes in it.\n\nI also remember the dead from my old fire team being placed on stretchers. I looked at the Marine who took my place and who was now dead. Fate had traded his life for mine. I have mixed emotions about this trade to this day. I feel some consolation in the fact that, if I had been killed, the possibility was not remote that the Chinese would have killed more Marines that day.\n\nChecking the guns in the bunker, I found out that they were two water-cooled 30-caliber Brownings made at the Rock Island Arsenal. They had a brass tag that said, \"US ARMY\". Ironically, Rock Island was my hometown. The Chinese were shooting at us with weapons my friends and neighbors had made. The guns were possibly taken near Hoengsong about a month earlier when the Army's 2nd Division and supporting troops were sent to support the ROK troops, who had left and told no one. They were overrun and massacred by divisions of Chinese communists. The Easy Company commander, who was on the west ridge, radioed our platoon leader and thanked him for taking out the machine guns that had pinned down his company.\n\nWelcome praise? Yes. Was it consolation for the sacrifices of men like Richard DeWert, my fire team buddies, the man who took my place, and others whose remains we put in body bags that day? Not at all. Men who fight, bleed and suffer the agonies of battle find no comfort in such detached deliberation. They are too involved with their vivid and tragic memories.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nHearts Filled With Pain\n\nIn August of 1951, Richard DeWert's foster mother responded to a letter sent to her by Captain Mackin. In it she wrote:\n\nDear Captain Mackin,\n\nReceiving your letter was most comforting. Knowing that Richard died so honorably eases, somewhat, the pain that will always remain in our hearts. Although we are not his natural parents, being childless, we loved him more than words can describe.\n\nHe was brought up under atrocious conditions by a mother who was only concerned about herself. Richard had to fend for himself from earliest childhood. He could have gone just as bad as he was good, but God in His infinite wisdom gave him a pure heart. He came to us, we thought at the time quite by accident; but now we know different. God sent him to us so that we could shower him with the love and affection that he never had received in early childhood. He, in turn, returned that love and affection on us that we also never received from a child of our own.\n\nWe were never able to adopt him legally as his mother would never relinquish him. His and our big aim in life was for him to become twenty-one so that we could adopt him legally. It was not His will that it be so, however we will never forget Richard's memory and will always carry it in our hearts.\n\nKnowing that you are burdened with many and tedious duties, we thank you from the bottoms of our hearts for taking the time to write us such a comforting letter.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nMrs. Albertina Roy\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nMedal of Honor\n\nFor some unexplained reason, HM3 DeWert received no recognition for his heroic sacrifices. To me and others this was troubling. Sometime later we got two great officer replacements, Captain Alvin Mackin and Lieutenant Lealon Wimpee. Captain Mackin was a World War II Marine Air Corps veteran and 2nd Lieutenant Wimpee was a World War II Marine infantry enlisted man who was wounded on Okinawa. He was our new platoon leader. They were like a breath of fresh air. Captain Mackin was our new Company Commander and he personally introduced himself to the entire Company. For us, this was unheard of. He was like a big brother and we bonded instantly with him.\n\nA day or so after Lieutenant Wimpee took charge of the platoon, he asked ten of us to go with him to act as an honor guard for a ceremony honoring a forward observer who was getting a citation for valor. Lieutenant Wimpee wanted us to all be wearing utilities that matched. This was difficult as we got our clothing from a pile of laundered clothing from all branches of service. When we took a shower we just took off our dirty clothes and put them in the pile with other soiled clothes. After taking a shower we went to a clean pile of clothes and put on anything that fit. One Marine Private got to be an Army First Sergeant by just taking a shower! Mountain warfare was hard on the knees and seats of pants. The Marine Corps fought its wars on a budget. We were like Cox's Army. Our preferred article of clothing was an Australian wool sweater, but that day we swapped clothing so ten of us had matching utilities. At the ceremony, the forward observer received a citation for valor by putting himself in harm's way by being assigned to Dog Company and calling devastating mortar fire on enemy positions.\n\nWhile walking back to our unit after the ceremony, I did a slow burn. I thought about our medical corpsman Richard DeWert, who died a real hero but got no recognition for his sacrifice. This living forward observer received a citation for putting himself in harm's way by being assigned to Dog 7. It seemed to me that, if being assigned to Dog 7 put him in enough harm's way to deserve a citation, all Dog Company Marines should get citations for valor for being assigned with each other. We were all in harm's way.\n\nAfter I got to know Lieutenant Wimpee, I ran DeWert's action by him and asked him if it was possible for him as an officer to recommend someone for a citation, even though he had been killed some time before he (Lieutenant Wimpee) arrived. He replied in the affirmative, but wanted to know who the platoon leader was and why he had not written up the citation. I said that I could not answer that question. I then told him about Richard DeWert, who we all felt died a real hero, yet for some reason received no recognition. I also told him that I had witnesses to DeWert's action. Lieutenant Wimpee said to get the witnesses and he would write up a citation for DeWert. My two other witnesses were PFC John Alseth and PFC Robert Gentry. Both had seen DeWert when he was wounded and still trying to save Marines. The four of us sat down in the dirt and wrote up a panoramic view of Richard DeWert's final moments. Lieutenant Wimpee gave this information to Captain Mackin, and he sent it up the line, recommending that DeWert receive the Medal of Honor.\n\nA special thanks to Charles Curley for his efforts in raising a million dollar scholarship fund at Pepperdine University in Richard DeWert's honor. Curley did this unilaterally and out of his own pocket. This gave the DeWert legacy legs. Charles Curley also started an endowment fund at Pepperdine University in Colonel Mackin's honor--again out of his own pocket. Master Chief Fred Kasper, US Navy, pulled strings and got the Navy/Marines to name the clinic at Bridgeport, California as the Richard DeWert Clinic. The Navy Hospital at Newport, Rhode Island, was also named the Richard DeWert Medical Clinic. There is also a ship, the USS DeWert FFG-45 named in his honor and there is a school, a highway, and more named in his honor. My own \"claim to fame\" is being the catalyst to get Richard DeWert the Medal of Honor.\n\nRichard DeWert will receive recognition for generations to come. Those of us who served in Dog Company 7th Marines will also share in this recognition with pride. Without all concerned acting in unison to get Richard the recognition he deserved, he would have been just another dead Sailor in a box. Dog Company 7th Marines received one Medal of Honor and it was not a Marine. It was a Sailor.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nMedal of Honor Citation - Richard David DeWert\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a HC, in action against enemy aggressor forces. When a fire team from the point platoon of his company was pinned down by a deadly barrage of hostile automatic weapons fired and suffered many casualties, HC Desert rushed to the assistance of 1 of the more seriously wounded and, despite a painful leg wound sustained while dragging the stricken marine to safety, steadfastly refused medical treatment for himself and immediately dashed back through the fire swept area to carry a second wounded man out of the line of fire. Undaunted by the mounting hail of devastating enemy fire, he bravely moved forward a third time and received another serious wound in the shoulder after discovering that a wounded marine had already died. Still persistent in his refusal to submit to first aid, he resolutely answered the call of a fourth stricken comrade and, while rendering medical assistance, was himself mortally wounded by a burst of enemy fire. His courageous initiative, great personal valor, and heroic spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds reflect the highest credit upon HC DeWert and enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.\"\n\nSergeant Gonzalo Garza wrote to me that if Richard DeWert did not get the Medal of Honor on April 5, 1951, the sacrifices that Dog Company made that day would be just “dust in the wind.” This is so very true. Hundreds of firefights, patrols and battles take place in a war. Most are just fading memories in the minds of the survivors. Those killed are registered in the casualty reports. This also will fade to the backwaters of history, and, over time, to those who are remembered on Memorial Day as the War Dead. The personal sacrifices and pain will be just…..Dust in the Wind.\n\nBack to Memoir Contents\n\nSilver Star Citation - Fred Frankville\n\nI received a Silver Star for my own personal actions on April 5. The citation reads as follows:\n\nSILVER STAR\n\nSECRETARY OF THE NAVY\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Private First Class FREDRICK P. FRANKVILLE, United States Marine Corps Reserve, for service as set forth in the following citation:\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving as a Rifleman of Company D, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 5 April 1951. When his unit was subjected to intense and accurate hostile automatic-weapons and small-arms fire from cleverly concealed bunkers, during an attack against a strongly defended enemy hill position, Private First Class FRANKVILLE fearlessly charged forward through the heavy fire to aid a wounded comrade lying in an exposed position within a few feet of the enemy and boldly delivered point-blank fire into the aperture of a hostile bunker. Despite hand grenades bursting around him, he succeeded in carrying his wounded companion to a safe posit"
