        "text": "Zac Efron may have missed the High School Musical cast's 10-year anniversary reunion on Disney Channel earlier this year, but he made up for it in his own special way last night. Troy Bolton came out of nowhere with a selfie that included the rest of the boys from the series, Corbin Bleu and Lucas Grabeel (AKA Chad Danforth and Ryan Evans).\n\nHe captioned the post: \"@mrgrabeel and I saw @corbinbleu DANCE on AIR ala Fred Astaire last night. He tapped ‚ÄúFirecracker‚Äù and lit the stage on üî• with his moves!\" Zac and Lucas both supported Corbin by attending his latest Broadway appearance in the Holliday Inn musical.\n\nThough it would have been nice to see Vanessa Hudgens and the rest of HSM crew on the 'gram, maybe they'll see him perform together another day. Now, we're just holding out for that full-on HSM reunion with all of the actors!\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMovies\n\n161 Disney Trivia Questions for Every Level of Disney Fan\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a Disney diehard or a general pop culture fan, find Disney questions for every type of trivia night.\n\nPolitics\n\nInside the History of State Suppression of Abortion in the U.S.\n\nCommon pregnancy outcomes, like miscarriage and stillbirths, are now potential criminal offenses.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Crackdown on the Stop Cop City Movement Is a Warning Sign\n\nStop Cop City protesters are being charged with domestic terrorism."
