Fans instantly connected with Troy and Gabriella, whose different backgrounds were put to the test when they both decided to audition for their school musical.\n\nDespite threats to their happiness, Troy and Gabriella, and all of their friends (and frenemies) danced it out for three movies. In the 13 years since High School Musical 3: Senior Year premiered, the stars have changed so much.\n\nWe’ve rounded up the biggest stars of the trilogy to give you an update on where they are now, 15 years after the movie’s release.\n\nTo find out more about Zac, Vanessa, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Monique Coleman, Corbin Bleu, and Olesya Rulin, and their careers over the past decade-plus, scroll through this gallery. We’re all in this together!\n\n1 of 7\n\nVanessa Hudgens\n\n2 of 7\n\nZac Efron\n\n3 of 7\n\nAshley Tisdale\n\n4 of 7\n\nLucas Grabeel\n\n5 of 7\n\nCorbin Bleu\n\n6 of 7\n\nMonique Coleman"
