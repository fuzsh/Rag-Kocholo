        "text": "High School Musical is a movie that defined my generation. Everyone my age knows it, either because they grew up with it or through osmosis because it was huge in the years between 2006 and 2008. And perhaps I’m too removed from the tween Disney Channel demographic nowadays, but I don’t think that any other made-for-TV Disney movie has ever made nearly the splash that High School Musical did. (I remember there was all this hot buzz that Camp Rock would be the new High School Musical, and…it was not.)\n\nLove it or hate it, this is a film that pretty much anyone can quote, even if it’s just, “We’re all in this together” or “Get your head in the game.” It has received a fair amount of mockery over the years – some of it coming from myself – but, while its sequels have their problems, I will always defend this film. Of course it’s not groundbreaking cinema – but it’s harmless fun and contains a fair amount of charm. Also, compared with the quality of the other Disney Channel movies and TV shows that I’ve seen over the years, High School Musical comes out looking like high art.\n\nIn many ways, the High School Musical movies are far more fun to watch as an adult than they were when I was a child. Sometimes that comes from finding disturbing or hilarious subtext within them that I missed as a kid, and some of it comes from a profound sense of nostalgia – this is such a simple view of life and high school, and it has an undeniable magic and joy even if it’s cheesy and juvenile.\n\nSo, let’s take a look back at the original High School Musical.\n\nThis is so clearly a 2006 made-for-TV film. Just watching the opening credits is so endearing. Look at that generic font! Look at how they can’t even properly use apostrophes! Look, this is so old that Vanessa Hudgens was billed as “Vanessa Anne Hudgens”!\n\nThat “randomly selecting guests to perform karaoke, whether or not they want to” ruse is so rude. I don’t know if this is a thing that happens outside of movies or not, but that just offends my introverted heart. If I was forced to that party, I would have been Gabriella, just wanting to read my book in the corner in peace. But what do I know? Maybe I’m just a coldhearted killjoy because I never got selected for karaoke at a New Year’s Eve party and met my Troy Bolton singing “Start of Something New.” Maybe this karaoke guy is an all-knowing matchmaker and every couple that he selects to sing together become soul mates for life. He does smugly tell them, “Someday you might thank me for this.” Maybe he’s Cupid. Or maybe he’s just a jerk who likes to socially humiliate teenagers at ski resort parties. One or the other.\n\nHe’s totally thriving on their discomfort.\n\nIt’s downright musical manipulation, but “Start of Something New” is undeniably fabulous. Like the rest of the movie, it is totally corny, with Troy and Gabriella rocking out only thirty seconds after being completely uncomfortable and Troy taking off his jacket mid-song and all of the other teenagers clapping along in the background. But it completely conveys the giddiness and excitement of new love – or new anything, really.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily true in the sequels, but Troy and Gabriella are actually a really good screen couple. Maybe this is forgotten because of all the real-life Zanessa drama that surrounded these films’ release or maybe it’s just because people like to make fun of High School Musical, but I was really struck on this re-watch by how well these characters click. Maybe it’s the writing. Maybe it’s because the actors were dating offscreen. Maybe it’s because Efron and Hudgens were teenagers themselves when the movie was shot and they brought a level of naturalism that older, more experienced actors don’t. But for whatever reason these two consistently feel real to me, and not even in a romantic way – just as a boy and girl who unexpectedly bond amidst the awkwardness of adolescence.\n\nTroy calling Gabriella in the middle of class might be ruder than randomly being selected to sing public karaoke. I know teenage boys can be impulsive but could he really not have waited for all ten minutes of homeroom to find out if the girl fifteen feet behind him was the girl he sang with at the resort? Also, he landed Gabriella in detention on her first day of school. I’m surprised she wasn’t ticked.\n\nZac Efron is one of the best parts of this movie. I know he’s a bit of a joke nowadays, especially with all of the stupid frat-boy-humor comedies that he appears in, but he’s actually wonderful here, even when he’s technically “bad.” Troy spends most of this movie looking confused and dismayed that all of this stuff is happening to him and it is both unintentionally hilarious and deeply honest. He’s just some guy with a swoopy haircut who has been thrust into the role of basketball captain and school heartthrob but he simply wants to live his life undisturbed. Is that so much to ask for?\n\nTroy’s dubbed singing voice is so distractingly obvious. I am still baffled about why this was a thing – yes, I’ve heard the story that the songs were already written before Efron was cast and he couldn’t reach the high notes, but, in that case, why did the film cast an actor who couldn’t sing the songs in the first place? Or why didn’t they rewrite the songs so he could? It is so jarring during “Start of Something New” (and every other song, really) when Troy opens his mouth and the voice is clearly not Troy. The only way that would be Troy would be if he inhaled a whole lot of helium. I mean no disrespect to Drew Seeley, whose work here is awesome, but it briefly yanks me out of the movie each time. It also threatens to ruin a sweet moment when Troy reprises “Start of Something New” on Gabriella’s balcony a capella, and this is the only moment in the film where it’s actually Efron’s singing voice but it’s like, Dude, that is not what you sounded like when you sang that before. Also because you can hear the proof of why Seeley had to dub Troy’s voice: Efron’s straining to hit those notes in the fifteen seconds that he sings.\n\nWe need to talk about East High’s theater department. On the one hand, it’s clearly underappreciated and is so in need of assistance that it requires students in detention to paint the sets – but the place also seems to have crazy funding. I mean, LOOK AT THIS PLACE. That’s bigger than most professional stages. That auditorium is nicer than what you see at most college theaters, let alone high schools. It makes me legitimately angry – both because that was so not my high school theater reality and because, for some schools, it actually was.\n\nAlso, they have entire props and sets completed before auditions even start? Whoever is crewing this show is on point.\n\nMaybe the movie’s one accurate depiction of the high school experience: the high school drama and sports departments will always fight for privilege, priority, and funding. And, despite claims of equanimity, the principal will always favor the side of sports.\n\nWe learn in Ms. Darbus’s audition announcement that Kelsi has composed the entire show. And we all know that student composers can be problematic. And…it kind of shows. I mean, Ryan and Sharpay’s rearrangement of the “What I’ve Been Looking For” song is actually better than the slow one that Kelsi plays with Troy and Gabriella. It’s still not GREAT – those lyrics are just…not good – but at least it has some pep. The original version is slow and boring.\n\nAlso, Ryan and Sharpay’s relationship is so creepy. The characters that they’re auditioning for are clearly lovers and Taylor refers to them playing Romeo and Juliet and Sharpay says that they’ve been the lead couple for all of the school’s musicals. Which leads you to wonder how many times they’ve played each other’s love interests. How many times have they made out onstage? Add in Sharpay’s complete control of Ryan and their matching outfits and I am so seriously disturbed.\n\nThough Sharpay and Ryan are portrayed as the villains, they also kind of have a point? Anyone who is involved in high school theater knows to be wary when the class jock storms into their space and takes the leading role that the theater kids have been working toward for years, as well as their space to shine – while the jocks are stars in sports, the theater kids have their theater, and now one has both and one has neither. Obviously, I know that people can be more than one thing and Sharpay is clearly crazy, but on a surface level I completely get why they’re ticked at losing their spots.\n\nChad’s mother has Michael Crawford’s picture in her refrigerator. Chad uses this as an offhand comment to freak out Troy, but I really need to know the story behind this. Look at images of Michael Crawford and you’ll understand my fascination.\n\nThis whole story takes place over the course of one week. As a kid, it felt like so much time passed between Troy and Gabriella reuniting in homeroom and belting out “Breaking Free.” But really, for all of the drama that the screenplay implies and the montages of Troy and Gabriella rehearsing for extended periods, this was so small in high-school-time. And it makes all of the dramatic statements all the funnier: the team gives Troy an intervention and are super worked up, saying, “We’re going to get our butts kicked at the championships on Friday,” and all I could think was, “Dude, Friday is two days from now, so at this point it probably doesn’t matter what Troy does.” Maybe if this were two months before the championship and they were worried about Troy losing time to rehearsals, it would make sense, but now it’s like they’re ready or they’re not.\n\nWhat kind of school has giant, wall-spanning posters/murals of its basketball players? That is horrifying on so many levels, both for the people featured on the poster and the ones that aren’t. No wonder Troy is such an anxious, depressed mess for most of these movies.\n\nRescheduling callbacks is not a thing that would happen. Let me rephrase that – rescheduling callbacks in that way would never happen. Callbacks are rescheduled all the time: but if your lead auditioners couldn’t make it to the call, then the director and auditioners would sort it out and meet at another time or on another day. Is Ms. Darbus really that dumb? Or are the students really so dumb that they don’t just reach out and explain the situation to her? One conversation/e-mail would have probably saved them a whole lot of trouble.\n\nThis is actually a shot in a movie. It’s so preciously stupid.\n\nWhat on earth is this show that they’re auditioning for? Who even are Minnie and Arnold, the characters that Ryan/Sharpay and Troy/Gabriella are competing over? How could those characters sing both “Bop to the Top” and “Breaking Free” when the characterizations within the songs are totally different? And they’re Spanish, apparently? I would say that the Spanish stuff was a Sharpay improvisation, but the song definitely has a tango style to it so I think that they might be.\n\n“Bop to the Top” is a real jam. Its lyrics are so intentionally dumb and I love it: “zig zag zop, pop like a mop” is too good.\n\nDo you think Troy and Gabriella were cast for the wrong reason? Ms. Darbus wasn’t even going to let them audition until half of the school poured in to watch them. Given the drama department’s desire for a bigger audience, I can’t help but wonder if the casting had nothing to do with talent and everything to do with the fact that Ms. Darbus knew that the theater would make a whole lot of money if the star athlete and star brainiac headlined the show because then all of the athletes and brainiacs would turn out to watch them. I mean, look at that house. The amount of people watching the audition alone is a bigger turnout than you get for most performances at high schools. This show would make some serious bank.\n\nGabriella doesn’t even have the first line of “Breaking Free.” There’s the whole drama of her being too scared to sing and Kelsi stalls out, but she isn’t the one who starts anyway. Maybe Troy switched their parts at the last minute so she wouldn’t have to start? But that doesn’t make any sense given the rehearsal montages and the keys that each part is written in and…oh, whatever.\n\nTroy, Gabriella, and Kelsi have the theater techies on their side. You might never see the techies, but you know that they have them in their pockets, because someone flew in an entire moon right in the middle of their song and someone changed the lights so that they had a blue wash on them when they sang rather than just generic rehearsal lighting. You briefly see Kelsi exchange a look with a guy running the fly system at the end of the scene, and it’s the closest thing we get to an acknowledgement of technical theater in the whole film. They clearly had some minions to pull that performance off.\n\nThe unsung hero of High School Musical.\n\nThere are some serious feels in “Breaking Free.” Even my cold black soul melts when I watch it. There’s just something so happy and…free about it. And when we see Troy and Gabriella’s parents wander in and look so struck by their kids’ talent? Oh, my heart.\n\nTroy and Gabriella don’t kiss, and it’s perfect. It’s so pure and wholesome, and it ensures that we aren’t distracted from the simple joy and triumph of their success. It also emphasizes their friendship over their relationship and accurately depicts what teenagers would actually be like in that situation – kind of hesitant and shy. Plus, as the movie establishes, they’ve only known one another for a week or two – they wouldn’t be there yet. See why in this movie they actually feel like real people?\n\n“We’re All In This Together” is such a freaking anthem. I don’t know how you can listen to that song and not want to rock out, or at least smile. Though I know those people exist.\n\nIsn’t that what you wish high school was like? This is what every pep rally tries to be, except not completely pathetic.\n\nI don’t know, maybe I’m just blinded by nostalgia, but I don’t see how you can watch High School Musical and not come out of it in a good mood. That final scene’s enthusiasm is so infectious and that song will never escape your memory. Nor will the choreography, which I can still do to this day. This is a modern classic, everyone – no point denying it."
