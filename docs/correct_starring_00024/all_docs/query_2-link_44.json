        "text": "(Or, three trilogies and one underrated duology.)\n\nHere comes a co-authored (and absurdly lengthy) post, y’all.\n\nI personally was a huge snob about High School Musical as an actual high-schooler, and I’ll admit that. I was in my peak Broadway phase and I thought it was lazy and dumb and, y’know, gave people a bad notion of what musicals actually were like. I only watched it once, and avoided the sequels like the plague. Drift partner had enjoyed it, though. Unrelated to this, first she and then we watched Teen Beach Movie, another Disney Channel original musical, and found it absolutely delightful. I will go to bat for Teen Beach and its sequel all day long. She eventually showed me High School Musical removed from my jaded high school lens and I was able to genuinely enjoy it for what it was, and likewise the second film. They’re not high art, but they’re fun. We also, as I’ve mentioned, rabbitholed into the Descendants franchise, which maybe isn’t the classiest thing for two adult women to admit but this is a shame-free zone.\n\nLast weekend we saw High School Musical 3 on Disney+ and said “what the hell.” She’d only seen it once, a long time ago, and didn’t remember it; I’d never seen it and figured I might as well. We expected the experience to be middling, ultimately forgettable, but not insulting.\n\nIt took us like three hours to watch this one hour/twenty-two minute movie because we kept pausing to rant, which is why we’re writing this. It’s kind of about High School Musical 3 but it’s also kind of about the relative merits of Disney franchises and how the hell you make sequels to things, especially musicals.\n\n(And Pirates. Drift partner is a former Pirates fangirl, so this entered our discussion as well. We’re only discussing the first three Pirates films, because the other ones are irrelevant.)\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year is set in, of course, the characters’ senior year, largely focusing on the last few months in particular. They are all facing their own struggles: along with debating where to go for college, there is a Juilliard scholarship on the line for either Troy (Zac Efron), Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale), Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), or Kelsi (Oleysa Rulin); Troy is confused about whether he wants to pursue basketball or music in college; Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) is anticipating the issues a long distance relationship will bring; Ryan is finally starting to realize what a manipulative asshole his twin sister is; and Sharpay longs for the glory of starring in her final spring musical. These are (mostly) reasonable things to build a movie around, or at least they sound like it.\n\nUnfortunately, this movie does not seem to know how to address any of these problems meaningfully or in a way that makes emotional sense for these characters.\n\nAnd that’s just the tip of the problem iceberg.\n\nOne of the first things we noticed and continued to notice was that almost every song just felt like it was trying to rehash other, better High School Musical songs. That’s not how you write songs. For example, a lot of songs from the Descendants franchise sound like weird combinations of songs that already exist (“It’s Going Down” from D2, for example, is a weird mashup of the Fall Out Boy song “My Songs Know What You Did In the Dark” and the Cabinet Battles from Hamilton, with, actually, a little bit of “Bet On It” from HSM2) but none of them sound like they’re just trying to recreate the success of previous Descendants songs. It’s not like, as I said, “My Songs Know” is about a pirate ship-themed showdown in real life. It’s a repurposing of the style of a song in a new context, and it’s fascinatingly weird. The first song in HSM3, “Now or Never,” is not an objectively terrible song, but it sounds almost exactly like “Get’cha Head in the Game” from HSM. Both songs take place in the gym and star Troy and the other basketball players. Both are meant to represent playing basketball in a musical context. However, the second one is a letdown simply because it’s not attempting to do anything different. They’re so blatantly trying to recreate the success of the first movie and the first basketball song (which is, objectively, an iconic number) that it’s sort of sad. The Bad Lip Reading version of the first song (linked here) is more entertaining than “Now or Never” and it’s actual, complete nonsense. You can tell that they’re trying slightly more ambitious cinematography as befitting HSM3’s status as an Actual Theater Release, but it doesn’t really enhance the experience. It’s just sort of… there.\n\nHaving set up the basic conflicts (graduation impending, college, the upcoming final musical, etc.) the second song, “Right Here Right Now,” is set during Troy’s graduation party, when Troy and Gabriella sneak away for some quiet time in his treehouse. It should be cute, but unfortunately it is deeply boring. And I (drift partner) was ride-or-die Troy/Gabriella back in the day! I wrote fanfiction about them! I still think they are adorable! But oh man was this song just…dull as dirt. I think one issue with Troy and Gabriella is that a lot of their songs tend towards not being super visually interesting, because they’re ballads, so it involves a minimum of moving around. This is a particularly bad example because it’s just…in a treehouse. Which is pretty and all, there are some nice twinkle lights, but I just found myself waiting for it to be over, which is not what you want in a romantic ballad at all.\n\nThen at school, Ms. Darbuss reveals that the spring musical will be titled “Senior Year,” and focus on several of the graduating students specifically. She also announces the aforementioned Juilliard scholarship will be at stake for the four aforementioned students, at which point Troy freaks out because he never sent an application to Juilliard and tries to quit the play, but Gabriella gives a rousing speech and convinces everyone to sign up for it (everyone tries to give examples of why they’re too busy, ranging from valid – needing to study – to ridiculous – needing to work on your shitty truck). Sharpay, trying to ensure that she is given a prominent role in the musical, ropes Ryan into performing “I Want It All,” which is a Chicago-inspired number that is kind of fun until you realize that all of their friends, including and especially their Black and brown friends, are playing their literal servants, and then you get really uncomfortable, or at least we did. There were also a lot of confusing backup dancers wearing pink bob wigs and cat ears like they were meant to be some variety of Harajuku girl, which was odd. At the very least, this number was a hallucination, so that’s kind of funny proof of Sharpay’s delusions. (Ryan gets to sing this number in the musical they put on, and there’s a small reprise with the baffling Harajuku girls, but the parts where Sharpay wants her friends to be service workers isn’t anything but her own mental fuckery.)\n\n(Also, as a former theatre kid myself, I’m going to come out and say it: performing a spring musical that you’re writing as you rehearse, full of graduating seniors who are, as mentioned, otherwise busy, is the actual worst idea I’ve ever heard in my entire life. Kelsi, poor Kelsi, the unsung hero as we just took a five-minute break in writing to discuss, has to write a whole-ass musical in, what, two months? At the very least, she’d already written all of Twinkle Towne or whatever the fuck the fake musical in HSM was by the time auditions had begun. Also, I understand that they have to do student-written productions because otherwise the movie would need to get copyright permission to do previously existing musicals, but it’s a terrible idea purely because of the stress it puts on poor Kelsi. She’s apparently responsible for writing and orchestrating a whole-ass musical without anyone helping. In this one, it seems slightly more collaborative in that the others are suggesting… scenes? Song ideas? But she’s still the only one responsible for the songwriting, which is the obvious bulk of this musical because you never actually see any of the scenes that are just the spoken plot. It’s not fair.)\n\nThen there’s a bunch of prom drama. Oh no, are the established boyfriends gonna ask their established girlfriends to prom? Oh nooooo~~?~?~?~?~>~~*~ (That series of random punctuation marks is to represent the fact that I would have said this with a wibbly-wobbly ghost voice to make fun of how much this isn’t drama.) Troy and Gabriella have another boring duet, but at least this one takes place in the full rooftop garden at their school, which, surprise, isn’t just a small greenhouse but is actually a rooftop-wide sculptural and landscape installment with small trees and flowers and planters to hop on while dancing. They dance, and that’s kind of cute. I literally can’t remember what the song sounded like, even just a week later, but the dancing was alright.\n\nAt some point, a new character is introduced. Sharpay has apparently been advertising for a personal assistant and a random British girl appears, stepping into the role. Her name is, no kidding, Tiara Gold. She’s played by someone named Jemma McKenzie-Brown, and she could have been such a fun counterpoint. If they wanted to repeat conflict from the first movie, they could have had Tiara initially present herself as a rival to Sharpay, a freshman with natural talent who either shadowed her or immediately saw her as an obstacle. Instead she appears as a total yes-man until very late in the movie, when she is cast as Sharpay’s understudy, and proceeds to try to sabotage her literally as the musical is being performed. It’s very weird and we’ll touch on it again near the end, because how this turns out is just bizarre.\n\nThey do a prom song. It sounds sort of like “Like Me” from Teen Beach, but the less-good version (“Like Me” is a freaking gem of a song, and one of the best numbers in that duology). The song is part of their musical, so it doesn’t represent actual prom, because it’s not yet time for actual prom in the storyline. But it’s there. It’s sort of cute. It’s forgettable, but it didn’t make us want to tear the speakers out of the computer.\n\nRyan and Kelsi sing a song and Ryan asks Kelsi to prom. This is allegedly a plan to manipulate Kelsi into writing better songs for Ryan and Sharpay, but they never really follow through with that part of the plot. This exists to make us believe that Ryan is heterosexual, which is a hilarious joke. Ryan Evans is one of the gayest characters in… any teen movie, ever. Hot take. (It was around this time that I realized that HSM3 went out of its way to keep Ryan and Chad [Corbin Bleu], who had a charming duet in HSM2 called “I Don’t Dance,” from interacting. Obviously, Disney got wind of the fact that people were ~shipping~ Ryan and Chad and had to nip that in the bud. It didn’t really work, but they tried.) Kelsi is also probably gay. In our opinion, if they went to prom it was as each other’s beards, because that’s all they could ever be to each other. They’re gonna be best beard pals, forever united by being emotionally abused by Sharpay and being really gay in Albuquerque.\n\nThen one of the only good songs comes in, when Troy is at the junkyard collecting parts for his truck (given the actual plot point that is how Troy’s truck “needs work,” which is breathtakingly lazy) and Chad shows up to hang out with him. They sing an adorable song (“The Boys are Back”) about how they grew up playing around and pretending to be superheroes and knights and all the things kids pretend with their best friends. For a not-insignificant part of it, they cast tiny lookalikes to play their kid versions and it’s super charming. This was the only part of the movie where I felt joy.\n\nHere’s a weird thing. One of the weirdest, in terms of writing a plot that makes sense in the real world. Gabriella has been accepted to Stanford (we find out at the end it’s for “pre-law,” which is baffling because she’s never expressed an interest in anything remotely resembling law; I would have thought pre-med would be a closer fit, but go off, I guess) but for some reason she’s also been accepted into a special early-admissions program. This means that she’ll have to go to, and start living on, campus several weeks… before her senior year in high school is over? I guess this is to give her more time to get used to the school or… something, they never really explain it in any detail. It might be something designed to give advantages to students from lower-income families (Gabriella has a single mother and may or may not be lower-income, although between the house she lives in and the resort she spent winter break at I don’t think I entirely believe that she is). This creates conflict because if she goes to the early-admissions program, she’ll miss important events like prom and, gasp, the spring musical. She’s known this was a possibility the whole time they’ve been rehearsing this musical that she just automatically got the lead in, but she didn’t bring it up until she had to leave in two days. THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT EXIST. We looked it up just to be sure, but also, why would it? It makes negative amounts of sense. Come a few weeks early while it’s still summer, sure. That sounds fine. That’s reasonable. But asking people to derail the end of their senior year (and therefore, presumably, not take their senior finals? Which makes no sense either) is ridiculous.\n\nAnyway, this creates conflict because Gabriella can’t decide if she wants to go to Stanford early or do the musical. This is ridiculous. She could just go to Stanford on time and still do the musical, but nobody seems to consider this option. If she doesn’t go now, she can’t go, apparently. (She also discusses doing a year or two at a local university and then going to Stanford to save money, which makes sense to me. Don’t spend huge amounts of money while you’re burning through your gen ed courses, then transfer for the specific things that matter. Everyone talks her out of this, though, insisting that it’s not worth giving up on her dreams even though she’s not giving up on her dreams by doing that. It’s odd.) But she ultimately decides, after talking to Taylor (Monique Coleman) and her mom and Troy, to go to the program, so she leaves and Sharpay takes her place in the musical. Sharpay is thrilled because this means that she can continue to sexually harass Troy, something she’s been doing since HSM. You’re given clues in the first two movies that she’s decided to stop sexually harassing Troy, but then she just goes back to doing it because it’s… funny? Dramatic? I don’t really know.\n\nThen Troy, deep in his feelings, goes to the deserted school at ass o’clock and sings an emotional rock ballad (?) called “Scream” (I just commented that if they knew anything about musicals, they should have called it “Troy’s Lament,” but it’s HSM3 so it forgot everything ever) which is a pretty bad song, but at least it’s interesting to watch because Kenny Ortega decided to use the same techniques as the hallway scenes in Inception, except two years earlier. This song is sort of like a worse version of “Bet on It” but at least it had a pulse. Then Ms. Darbuss, who is there for some reason, reveals that it was she who sent the application to Juilliard on his behalf. They have a weird emotional moment where they kind of connect and it tries to humanize her a little. This scene is very weird because up to now Ms. Darbuss has been a mild antagonist whose entire character is “the THEAtre is the most important thing and fuck your sportball.” Trying to remind the audience that she’s more than a caricature at this point is just bizarre and a waste of screentime.\n\nMeanwhile, Gabriella is at Stanford, feeling very weird about not being at home, and then Troy shows up and they “have their own prom” and it cuts to a fantasy sequence where they’re dancing to a reprise of “Can I Have This Dance.” This should be cute except it is (again) boring as dirt. He then convinces her to come back and do the musical, which is currently going on at that very moment.\n\nSharpay is playing Gabriella’s role and she is…certainly doing something onstage. Troy’s understudy Rocket Boy has to cover for him, and we have not mentioned Rocket Boy but that’s because he is not a character and he doesn’t matter at all. Also Troy had pulled a prank on him earlier telling him that Sharpay has a crush on him and teehee it’s wacky because now he’s playing opposite her! I just wanted it to be over at this point. But then Troy and Gabriella run in and take their rightful (?) places onstage! I think this is bullshit because as much as I genuinely like Gabriella, there’s no way she should have been allowed back into the play literally in the middle of it after being gone for weeks. That just really wouldn’t happen (unless, maybe, the reason she had been gone was some great personal tragedy that was out of her control, like the death of her entire family that required her to fly to another country for a weeks-long wake, or like – here’s a tangent okay – they had a series of chapter books around the characters in the Barbie line the Generation Girls, and one of them was a shy English girl who liked to write music, and she was going to be in a show at their New York City high school that she’d written music for but then her dad tried to send her back to England because her focusing on music was Bad and Unserious or something but then at the last minute she didn’t go back to England and they obviously still let her be in the show when she came back at the last minute, but that wasn’t a choice, and Gabriella chose to leave).\n\nThen in comes Tiara’s random betrayal against Sharpay, which was not particularly developed at all, and it’s kind of funny watching them try and literally upstage each other but mostly it’s just awkward. It seems like if it was a production by anyone but Disney, they might have had a weird foe-yay sexual tension thing going on, like – okay, imagine if “Anything You Can Do” was two women, maybe. They’re upstaging each other but it also seems kind of like weird flirting. Except get the hell out of here, Sharpay, you don’t get to be a lesbian because you’re a bitch and actually you’re also probably a TERF.\n\nThe end of their musical is……… their graduation? Like, it’s not the actual graduation ceremony, because that takes place in the next scene, but they all wear graduation robes and the chorus stands behind them and does a slow, thoughtful chorus of “together, together, everyone” from “We’re All In This Together,” and we were both enraged. The only reprise of a song from a previous film and it’s that garbage? So Ms. Darbuss announces where the seniors are going and what they’re majoring in, and she announces that the Juilliard scholarship has gone to Kelsi! Good job, Kelsi. You’re the best character in these movies and the only person who’s never done anything questionable or annoying, and, again, you work the hardest. Ryan also gets a scholarship, a special extra one, which is good because he choreographed this whole musical by himself and he’s okay when you rip him away from his trash monster of a sister. Sharpay is going to state school, which I think is going to be good for her. She’ll ultimately be a big fish in a smaller pond, but she’ll have to start from the ground up in an unglamorous place, and hopefully she learns how to not be a terrible person in the process.\n\n(I’m also going to ask here why Taylor and Chad were even in the spring musical. They weren’t in the original musical. They’re in the movie doing their own activities, not the musical. I’m really not sure why they’re in this stage musical other than because the writers wanted to make sure they actually gave screentime to Black characters and the stage musical is a large part of the plot. But whatever, I’m not mad. They’re good actors, or good enough. It’s just weird.)\n\nIt is during this bizarre farce of a graduation scene that Troy announces to everyone that he is going to UC Berkeley, to be close to Gabriella, and that he wants to pursue both basketball and theater, a thing that we had paused the movie to yell at the screen as a possible solution twenty minutes earlier.\n\nThen they show actual graduation, like with the whole senior class, and they finish the entire trilogy with a song, I kid you not, called “High School Musical.” It is the actual dumbest song I’ve ever heard. It is an insult to the ears and eyes. It contains the actual lyrics “high school musical, who says we have to let it go? […] Let’s celebrate where we come from, the friends who’ve been there all along!” This is especially funny considering Zac Efron’s refusal to ever acknowledge anything to do with these movies. Anyway, it’s bad, and it’s unfortunately an earworm on top of being bad.\n\nAnd then they did a curtain call at the end of the movie, which made us both scream. Especially given that the curtain call was only Taylor, Chad, Sharpay, Ryan, Gabriella, and Troy. You’re really gonna do Kelsi like that, you assholes? Also, how dare you try to make us feel emotional after making us sit through that garbage.\n\nBut wait, I thought we were going to be talking more about the HSM franchise vs. other franchises (Teen Beach, Descendants, and also Pirates)? Well, buckle up.\n\nThe first comparison we’re going to make is about antagonists, and specifically the development of antagonists throughout the franchises. Teen Beach is exempt because, let’s be real, the only true antagonists of Teen Beach are peer pressure, societal standards, and heterosexuality, and while those all factor into HSM, there are also a lot of real antagonists. As we mentioned above, Ms. Darbuss serves that function, as does Sharpay (Ryan is more of her minion than anything else). Troy’s father is a lesser antagonist at one point. Tiara Gold is an eleventh hour antagonist. That’s… about it. Compare this to Descendants, where the protagonists sort of are the antagonists in the first movie but then again so are societal standards, but there’s also Maleficent (Kristin Chenoweth), then in D2 you get Uma (China Anne McClain) and her pirates, then in the third movie there’s Audrey (Sarah Jeffery). In Pirates of the Caribbean, we have Captain Barbossa (who shuffles around to “loveable scamp uncle” by movies 2 and 3) (Geoffrey Rush), Admiral James Norrington (who has a great redemption arc in 3) (Jack Davenport), Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), Tia Dalma to a lesser extent (Naomi Harris), and Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander).\n\nIn layman’s terms, this is: bitchy drama teacher, bitchy drama student, bitchy basketball coach, and other bitchy drama student; compared to literal fairytale witch who turns into a dragon, embittered pirate child who turns into a kraken, and embittered/jilted fairytale princess who takes up dark magic; compared to scorned cursed pirate captain, disgraced Navy officer, cursed sea captain who’s mad at his ex, justifiably vengeful goddess of the sea, and the embodiment of historical anti-piracy sentiments.\n\nThe stakes are basically nonexistent in HSM, is the point there.\n\nThe other villain problem is what they do with the villains. Descendants is about the children of villains learning to not be villains, so the core four (Mal [Dove Cameron], Evie [Sofia Carson], Jay [Booboo Stewart], and Carlos [Cameron Boyce]) learn that pretty quickly. Uma and her lackeys Harry (Thomas Doherty) and Gil (Dylan Playfair) learn it in D3, grudgingly but also pretty quickly. Maleficent just gets turned into a lizard. Audrey has sort of a reverse redemption arc, in that she goes from being a mean girl to a sort of half-assed supervillain and then turns allegedly nice at the very end of D3. There’s also Hades (Cheyenne Jackson), who’s barely a villain and gets with it after one (1) musical number (which is probably one of the greatest scenes ever committed to film). All of the antagonists experience change. None are static.\n\nIn Pirates, Barbossa, as mentioned, starts out as a mildly menacing figure (especially with regard to Elizabeth), but by the time he has returned in the second film everybody teams up with him to take down the “real” antagonists, i.e. literal eldritch/supernatural powers and also the British government. Norrington is a spurned ex who fell into professional disgrace in the second film, and works with Jack and then subsequently Beckett because he’s pretty deep in his feelings, but in the third movie he actually experiences regret and heroically sacrifices himself and it is very well done. Tia Dalma and Davy Jones’ stories are intertwined, as he is a man who fell in love with her/the sea, but she left because, well, she’s the sea, and he responded by throwing a colossal tantrum and getting himself cursed to sail the seas forever as a man with a tentacle face. He does not get redeemed and he just dies, good riddance. She explodes into crabs at the end and then causes a whirlpool which almost kills Our Heroes several times. And Beckett is just a dumb piece of shit British officer who represents everything bad about Britain and he ends up exploding without a shred of remorse for anything, but he doesn’t have to go on a journey because he sucks.\n\nAgain, for the most part, journeys. The HSM antagonists, meanwhile… don’t go on those. Ms. Darbuss and Mr. Bolton just spend the whole series trying to pressure kids into doing their extracurricular of choice and being jackasses, except that weird redemption moment of Ms. Darbuss’ and the brief moments in both HSM and HSM3 where Mr. Bolton, like, stares at Troy and nods respectfully at his life choices. Sharpay is actually incredibly frustrating because she spends the entire first movie being a raging shallow bitch, then at the very end goes “I guess I’m your understudy, uh, break a leg, shrug” and it’s vaguely implied she might hook up with the nice baking boy Zeke (Chris Warren Jr.). Then the second movie starts and everyone is working at a resort or something that her dad is a member of so she goes to hang out there a lot, and suddenly she’s back on her bullshit of being materialistic and trying to steal both Troy and the spotlight from Gabriella, despite Troy’s obvious disinterest. Then at the end, Troy tells her no and she gets hoodwinked by her brother and she gives Ryan an award, implying that she might be learning her lesson. Then the third movie starts and she’s dead-set on being the star of the spring musical and getting into Juilliard at any cost, and maybe dating Troy, just like she didn’t learn a single damn lesson. This would be different if we hadn’t seen beats where she literally did learn those lessons, or was suggested to have done. This is like if the first half of D3 happened as it did, with Uma and co. working with Mal and co., and then at the very end Uma just decided to be a kraken again and destroy things for no reason except ~it creates drama~. It’s like if at the end of the third Pirates Barbossa suddenly joined the Navy.\n\nThe next comparison on our list is with regards to relationships and their development. HSM3 spends a lot of time with Troy and Gabriella, and you believe that they like each other (though I’m going to give a hot take: I’m not entirely sure why they like each other), and they have the whole song about Chad and Troy being best friends, but we honestly don’t know why most of the friends are actually friends at all, other than we’re just shown them being. Gabriella and Taylor have multiple Serious Conversations about academia and relationships, and Taylor has a very distinct notion that she knows what’s right for Gabriella, but previous films haven’t really established them as best friends so much as people who run in the same circles and get along pretty well. In HSM she actively collaborates with Chad to deceive Gabriella, and that’s never really addressed, although she does make up for it. So the sudden portrayal of them as Best Friends Forever is jarring. The attempt to do Ryan/Kelsi is out of left field. Taylor and Chad are one of the most blatant “pair the spares” relationships I’ve ever seen. Etcetera.\n\nCompare this to Teen Beach, which is 1000% about friendship. Brady (Ross Lynch) and Mack (Maia Mitchell) are on-off boyfriend/girlfriend, but they clearly become that as a natural extension of friendship, and they behave like people who know each other really well would. (Brady throws tantrums sometimes, but he’s a teenage boy and he’s not nearly as awful as he could be.) I don’t believe the Lela/Tanner romantic relationship for one minute, but this is very possibly on purpose, because the whole point of Teen Beach is that it’s a deconstruction of goofy 60s romance musicals and the second movie ends with Lela (Grace Phipps) redefining her own destiny so she’s not just a love interest, and also one of the co-writers as much as said that Lela is into Mack, like in a gay way (and honestly Tanner [Garrett Clayon] is definitely gay too). But I believe that Lela and Tanner get along with each other. I definitely believe that Brady and Tanner are pals, based on multiple instances, and Lela and Mack are canonically “friends forever” joined by a magical necklace and also they’re probably girlfriends and the movies are at least ⅓ just scenes proving this. You also believe that all of the friendgroups in the movie are actually friends, because they’re shown enjoying each other’s company and stuff (as opposed to Gabriella and Taylor, who spend an odd amount of their shared screen time disagreeing about things).\n\nCompare this to Descendants, which is an entire three movies about the power of love and friendship triumphing over darkness. The core four start as established BFFs and help each other through problems instead of having stupid arguments (and Evie and Mal have an entire, also sort of gay, song about sticking together despite having their differences and being sad). Mal’s romance with Ben (Mitchell Hope) seems more like friendship than actual romance, sort of like Lela and Tanner with less deconstruction involved; Evie’s romance with Doug (Zachary Gibson) is kind of telegraphed, but again, I at least believe that they’re buddies. The core four befriend other kids in Auradon, including Jane (Brenna D’Amico) and Lonnie (Dianne Doan), and you see moments of them actively bonding with those characters. And while Uma and co. are antagonists through D2, D3 is at least ⅓ about those three bonding with the core four, plus Celia (Jadah Marie). You get to see these relationships develop, and when there are arguments they’re reasonable ones that are based on characters disagreeing and not just characters being forced into saying things to progress the plot.\n\nPirates is sort of a movie about love and friendship and general freedom, although it likes to pretend it’s more sophisticated than that. Our core three at the beginning of the series are Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who is just a chaotic neutral figure throughout, and the audience surrogates Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Will and Elizabeth fall in love during the first movie, and Jack bumbles around sort of becoming friends with each of them before betraying them a thousand times over the series because that’s just kind of what he does. I know some people think Will and Elizabeth are boring, and they’re allowed to think that, but also I think they’re wrong – I and an entire forum of other people found them very compelling as the films were coming out! Jack’s relationship with either of them fluctuates between tentative friendship, vague flirtation, and constantly betraying each other. Also Barbossa is there, and he and Jack have a hilarious rivalry after Barbossa mutinied against him. There are also assorted other secondary and tertiary pirates who are basically cartoon characters and they get nice moments with each main character as well. The point by the end of the movies, which I think is conveyed well, is that both Elizabeth and Will are decent leaders who understand how to get people to follow their orders, while Jack is truly chaotic neutral and only out for himself.\n\nAll of these relationships, the point is, are shown, not told, and they progress in reasonable fashions, not just dictated story beats. HSM3 especially was so focused on repackaging the flashily successful parts of the other two movies (the musical numbers, the obvious story beats) that it forgot to do a lot of character work.\n\nIn general, this ties into our complaints about pacing and escalation, too. HSM3 combines story elements from the first two into a tired rehash of plot points and arcs we’ve already seen these characters go through. Once again, Troy is torn between basketball and theater. Once again, Gabriella is feeling isolated due to her ambitions. Once again, Sharpay is fixated on Troy. The only character who actually grows at all is Ryan, but it’s almost too subtle to praise – it’s implied that he finally gets up the courage to start divulging from Sharpay’s orbit, but we the audience don’t really get to see him call her out on her manipulative behavior in any significant way. Everyone else barely gets to do anything, as usual. The other franchises escalate to varyingly ridiculous degrees – Teen Beach goes from “modern kids stuck in old movie” to “old movie kids stuck in modern world AND LITERALLY DISAPPEARING IF THEY STAY TOO LONG,” Descendants goes from cute referential stories about making your own destiny even if you come from something bad to babby’s first class struggles, Pirates goes from fighting the navy and societal standards to fighting eldritch creatures – but HSM3 is all too content to just tread water and give us boring rehashings of things we’ve seen before, which are in and of themselves not bad but also not particularly scintillating.\n\nFinally, as we’ve hinted at through the entire essay, HSM3 is just… uncreative. It feels like a cash grab in a really sad way; the songs are lazier and so unmemorable that a week later we don’t actually even remember how any of them except the godforsaken finale sound, the actors all seem like at least some of the time they’re phoning it in, the choreography is fine but not actually worldshaking (here’s a hot take, too: Teen Beach actually has more impressive choreography than HSM or Descendants, despite those two movies featuring larger dance numbers, because Teen Beach has dancers doing more complicated things that a child definitely couldn’t just learn from watching it over and over), and it’s just really boring to watch. We watched the extended cut on accident, which is 120 minutes, and we felt every single one of those minutes. (This was possibly exacerbated by all the times we paused to yell, because then we’d hit unpause and go “oh my god, we have forty minutes left, HOW” or whatever.) Say what you will about the latter Pirates movies, and plenty has been said, but you would be hard-pressed to call them “uncreative” in regards to plot points or lore."
