        "text": "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series season 4 reveals where Troy and Gabriella are now.\n\nHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series season 4 is finally here but are Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens in the show?\n\nEver since Disney+ confirmed that High School Musical: The Musical: The Series season 4 would bring back members of the original High School Musical cast, fans have been desperate to see if Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens will be in it. To add to the ongoing speculation, Zac and Vanessa shared Instagram posts of them hanging around the HSMTMTS set in 2022.\n\nREAD MORE: Is High School Musical 4: The Reunion a real movie? The new trailer explained\n\nNow, HSMTMTS season 4 is here and a scene reveals where Zac and Vanessa's characters, Troy and Gabriella, are now.\n\nAre Troy and Gabriella in High School Musical 4: The Reunion?\n\nFans of HSMTMTS will already know that the series is set in a fictional version of the real school where High School Musical was filmed. In the first season, the students put on a production of High School Musical, and the new season sees the kids play extras as the real cast of High School Musical return to East High to film a fictional fourth High School Musical film.\n\nAhead of season 4, Disney+ confirmed that Corbin Bleu (Chad), Lucas Grabeel (Ryan), Monique Coleman (Taylor), Kaycee Stroh (Martha), Alyson Reed (Ms. Darbus) and Bart Johnson (Coach Bolton) will play themselves all reuniting to film High School Musical 4: The Reunion. What about the two lead actors Vanessa Hudgens (Gabriella) and Zac Efron (Troy)?\n\nIn a scene in episode 1, Corbin, Lucas and Monique reveal the plot of HSM 4. They announce: \"It is our 15 year high school reunion. Chad is married to Taylor, Martha is a world-class choreographer, Troy and Gabriella are now in couple's therapy, Ryan is happily partnered with twins on the way and the future of the East High drama department is on the line.\"\n\nSo, Troy and Gabriella are still together but they're going through relationship issues! Reacting on TikTok, one fan wrote: \"NOT COUPLES THERAPY! They were supposed to be my one ship that's always happy and in love.\"\n\nAnother commented: \"them breaking up and then getting back together every movie. now this makes sense!\"\n\nUnfortunately for fans hoping to see Vanessa and Zac appear in the series, they do not show up in any capacity.\n\nTheories that Zac and Vanessa would star in the new season first surfaced back in 2022 when Zac and Vanessa both shared mysterious Instagram posts outside of East High. Zac also said that he would love to do a High School Musical reboot with the original cast.\n\nIn 2022, E! News asked Zac if he would be interested in a High School Musical reboot. Without hesitating, the actor said: \"Of course. Seriously, having the opportunity, in any form, to go back and work with that team would be so amazing. My heart's still there.\"\n\nLike Zac and Vanessa, Ashley Tisdale (Sharpay) and Olesya Rulin (Kelsi) sadly don't appear in season 4 either.\n\nLooks like we'll have to keep our fingers crossed for an actual High School Musical 4 to see a reunion.\n\nRead more High School Musical: The Musical: The Series news here:\n\nHigh School Musical series confirms Ryan is gay in new 'reunion' trailer\n\nHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series makes history with Disney's first LGBTQ+ love song\n\nHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series fans praise Ashlyn's coming out scene\n\nHas Olivia Rodrigo left High School Musical: The Musical: The Series?
