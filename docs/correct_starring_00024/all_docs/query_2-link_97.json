        "text": "It felt grand seeing an Indian in such a good role in the film — Nick Sagar as Kevin Richards.\n\nEver since High School Musical, Vanessa Hudgens has seemed like a perfect actor for everything romantic, simple, festive, and practical. In this piece, I will walk you through Vanessa Hudgens’ finesse in The Princess Switch and why she was the perfect pick for an actor, who would play double roles in the movie.\n\nThe Princess Switch is a Romantic Comedy, which was released in 2018. Although a 1 hour and 41 minutes long movie, it seems like it finishes in the blink of an eye, because everything seems to roll in a series of events quite hastily.\n\nA wintry Christmas watch, the movie opens in Chicago, where Stacy De Novo, an American baker who also owns a bakery, is in a state where she is getting over her 3-year long relationship with her ex, Paul. Her High School friend, Kevin Richards, helps Stacy run the bakery and has a cheerful little daughter named Olivia.\n\nThe movie, as if picking up pace in the first few scenes, shows Olivia telling Stacy and Kevin about a Christmas Baking Competition that is going to take place in Belgravia in a couple of days. Olivia really wishes to be a part of all the Christmas cheer in Belgravia, and somehow manages to persuade them both to participate in this Competition.\n\nWhile preparing her setup and meeting with a rival at the competition base, Stacy runs into the Duchess of Montenaro, apparently somebody who is quite looked up to in Belgravia. Surprisingly, the both of them have an uncanny resemblance. Well, Stacy quite literally meets her doppelganger, and not just someone who ‘resembles’ her. The story takes a turn when the Duchess, Margaret Delacourt, convinces Stacy to switch places with her.\n\nAmongst the Belgravia sightseeing, singing Christmas carols with Kevin and Olivia, wearing Stacy’s Baseball hat, living like a commoner, and finally letting her spirits fly freely, Margaret falls in love with Kevin, and lets him fall for her, too.\n\nQuite similarly (but with a different setup), Stacy, in her artificial but exquisite British accent, takes charge of some royal arrangements, goes horseback riding in the snow-capped mountains of Belgravia with Prince Edward (who is supposed to get married to Margaret), and brightens the Christmas of some orphans with toys wrapped in Christmas paper and home-made baking, all the while charming Edward and making the both of them fall in love with each other with every new thing they tried.\n\nWhy I mention High School Musical and the word practical together is because Vanessa Hudgens was portrayed to be a student with high intellect in the Disney movie and is shown as an organised American baker in The Princess Switch. The roles complement each other quite well, except for the other character Vanessa plays, of Duchess Margaret.\n\nVanessa Hudgens, with her slick hair, sharp calf muscles, short dresses (while she was a Duchess), never seemed haughty, but always looked magnetic — especially to the guys in the movie. Like in High School Musical (all parts), Hudgens played another role in The Princess Switch where she seemed to be the perfect wife material and never somebody a guy can date casually. Hence, the perfect pick for a movie such as this.\n\nHudgens’ sharp accents, both American and British, with her high-pitched voice, paint pictures of two flawless young women, Stacy and Margaret, who, as if, sing when they speak.\n\nWith the ideal smile for every situation, the childish innocence when she, as Stacy, discovers Margaret’s wardrobe, the motherly connection she shares with the little kids around her, she lets a person watching the movie feel warm, cosy, and at home.\n\nEverything about this Netflix movie is very Christmassy — two lovers curled up on a sofa watching another cosy Christmas movie, Christmas lights in a romantic gazebo with two lovers dancing the night away, a family-like trio engaged in a snowball fight, a toy store filled with Christmas toys, and two lovers again, playing Carol of The Bells on the pianoforte. The magic of the movie makes you want to smell the baking aromas and play in the snow yourself, while also making you want to find the love of your life in an affluent district in Central London.\n\nThe Princess Switch is the perfect Christmas watch if you’re looking for a happy-ever-after and indications of budding families and new romances!\n\nKudos to Michael Rohl for such a scenic and jolly Christmas direction!\n\nOn an ending note: It felt grand seeing an Indian in such a good role in the film — Nick Sagar as Kevin Richards.\n\nGo watch The Princess Switch. Happy Movies to you!"
