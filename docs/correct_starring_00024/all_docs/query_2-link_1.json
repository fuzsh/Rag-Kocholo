Hudgens has also recorded several other releases as her High School Musical character Gabriella Montez in the High School Musical film series' soundtracks. The songs she has recorded entered several international music charts and most of them were duets with the cast members of the High School Musical series. Hudgens' biggest hit song is the High School Musical duet \"Breaking Free\", which peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[1]\n\nIn 2006, Hudgens signed a record deal with Hollywood Records. Her debut solo studio album, V, was released on September 26, 2006 in the United States.
