        "text": "Seeing the ice show tomorrow I'll report back and let you know what it's like. It's got songs from both films apparently so I don't know how they're going to work that but it'll be interesting.\n\n0\n\nHave fun - it's fantastic.\n\nYes, they do the songs from both films; first half is HSM1, and second half is HSM2. I had a brilliant time.\n\nYes, it was great There were a few minor incidents - one of the supporting cast, the guy I presumed to be Jason, skated into one of the lockers by mistake with a quite audible crash, one of the skaters nearly fell off his table during \"Stick to the Status Quo\" and the 'winning basket' of the championship game didn't actually land in the hoop. Other than that it was really good I thought the people skating the parts of Ryan, Sharpay and Gabriella were the best skaters, Ryan especially managed to 'get' the character for me, though I thought the guy playing Zeke did too. Troy was too stiff and careful during the first part but he got better during the second act and he really came into his own from \"Bet On It\" onwards.\n\n0\n\nYES\n\nDo you know about the others?\n\nYupyup it's been comfirmed that all 6 main character have definately signed on for it!!! it will be out in the US in October, so it'll prob be in the uk around jan 2009 or the very end of this year!\n\n0\n\nApparently shooting has been put off until April and will also last 41 days, which is longer than either of the first two films.\n\nIt will apparently be called High School Musical 3: Senior Year.\n\nThere is a rumoured leaked song list but I think it's bull.\n\n0\n\nChanging the topic slightly now . Could you imagine 'HSM' remake in 20 years time! What would you think?\n\nIMO the newer version of Hairspray is more enjoyable, as I was not keen on the original.\n\nI'm not trying to get into a debate here but look at 'Hairspray' and it's only a matter of time that they dare (NOT) touch 'Grease'.\n\n0\n\nChanging the topic slightly now .

Grease, it would just be a remake whereas Hairspray was very different between film (first time round) and stage.\n\n0\n\nIf these movies are soo popular I dont understand why they dont get released at the Cinema, surely they would make more money that way then letting them go out on tv.\n\nHigh School Musical 1 was 100% bigger than Disney expected it to be. It was just another one of their Disney Channel TV Movies to them until it was released and took the world by storm.\n\nHigh School Musical 2 was actually going to get a cinema release but i think time restraints and the casts contracts(I think..) didnt permit it.\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year is going to the cinema, expected to be released in October.\n\n0\n\n^That's about right.\n\nHSM was just another DCOM (probably intended to be a Ashley Tisdale vehicle) but it just exploded into what it has become.\n\nWhen you think what HSM1 cost against what it alone has made, you now know why Mickey smiles so much!\n\n0"
