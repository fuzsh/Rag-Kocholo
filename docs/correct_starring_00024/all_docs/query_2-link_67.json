        "text": "Originally appeared on E! Online\n\nCoach said to fake right and break left—and the rest is TV movie history.\n\nZac Efron recently explained why working on the “Get’cha Head in the Game” scene from High School Musical first gave him an inkling that the 2006 film was destined for greatness.\n\n“Not many people know this but High School Musical was just a made for TV movie and it was very small, so we had a very condensed shooting schedule and very limited rehearsal time,” Zac revealed in a video for Vanity Fair published July 2. He noted that while director Kenny Ortega had big ambitions, \"I think he was pleasantly surprised when all the boys were excited to not only fulfill what he wanted but to take it one step further.”\n\nThe “incredibly motivated” crew that made up the East High Wildcats basketball team—including Corbin Bleu, Chris Warren, Ryne Sanborn and the film’s choreographer Chucky Lapow—were so game that the number came together surprisingly fast.\n\nMore from E!

After five takes, we nailed it.”\n\nHe added, “They didn't cut from start to finish and all of us were blown away. And I think that was the first time all of us went, ‘Is this gonna be cool?’”\n\nAnd the Family Affair actor, who admitted he hadn’t revisited the scene in years, still looks back so fondly of working on that now-iconic routine. “This felt really cool,” he recalled. “It was a really special moment and I'm still just proud of all those guys for doing that cause it was hard.”\n\nPlus, he remains impressed by his own basketball prowess at the time, emphasizing, “I really drilled all those shots. There's no CGI in there—I don't think we had the budget for that.”\n\nIn addition to marveling at the moment that proved to be a turning point, he expressed how much the cast and crew continues to mean to him, adding, “I love you, Kenny. I miss you guys.”\n\nSo, would Zac ever walk the halls of East High for a revival or reunion? You can bet on it.\n\n\"My heart's still there, so that would be incredible. I hope it happens,\" he told E! in 2022. \"And I think everybody would love to get involved. I'll try to keep them moving in the right direction.\"\n\nWhile Zac's head is always in the game when it comes to HSM, keep reading to see what his former costars—including Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel and Monique Coleman—are up to now.\n\nZac Efron (Troy Bolton)\n\nVanessa Hudgens (Gabriella Montez)\n\nAshley Tisdale (Sharpay Evans)\n\nLucas Grabeel (Ryan Evans)\n\nCorbin Bleu (Chad Danforth)\n\nMonique Coleman (Taylor McKessie)\n\nBart Johnson (Coach Jack Bolton)\n\nChris Warren Jr. (Zeke Baylor)\n\nAlyson Reed (Ms. Darbus)\n\nOlesya Rulin (Kelsi Nielsen)\n\nKayCee Stroh (Martha Cox)"
