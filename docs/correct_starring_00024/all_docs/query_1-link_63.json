        "text": "Wondering if Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens made our dreams come true by heading back to East High for the fourth and final season of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series? It’s now or never. So was the Disney+ series able to pull off an iconic surprise?\n\nWith former Wildcats Chad Danforth (Corbin Bleu), Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman), Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel), Martha Cox (Kaycee Stroh), Coach Jack Bolton (Bart Johnson), and Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) returning to their old stomping grounds to film High School Musical 4, fans can’t help but wonder if some of the film’s biggest stars — Efron, Hudgens, and even Ashley Tisdale (we need more Sharpay in our lives!) — will return for a final surprise.\n\nThough three fan-favorite actors were absent from Season 4’s star studded trailer, Efron and Hudgens sparked rumors of potential involvement in the series back in 2022, when they each shared mysterious Instagram posts of themselves back at East High. Hudgens posted a video of herself in front of the school in June 2022, and a month later Efron shared a photo of himself throwing the famous Breakfast Club fist up in the air from the same spot. Hmmm…\n\nHudgens attempted to squash High School Musical rumors by telling EW, “My boyfriend was playing in Salt Lake — he’s a baseball player… So he was at the field and I had rented a car and I was like, ‘I want to go check it out and take some pictures for old time’s sake.'” But was the story just a cover? Are she and Efron appearing in the final season of HSMTMTS? How about Tisdale? And while we’re at it, does HSMTMTS star Olivia Rodrigo return for the sendoff? What I’m asking is are we really ALL IN THIS TOGETHER?\n\nWe’ve got the answers below, but be mindful of HSMTMTS Season 4 spoilers.\n\nAre Zac Efron And Vanessa Hudgens In High School Musical: The Musical: The Series Season 4?\n\nIn the Season 4 premiere of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, Bart Johnson’s Coach Bolton asks if anyone has seen Sharpay, Troy, or Gabriella, to which another character replies, “Not yet coach. They have been silent in the group chat.” It seems like the perfect set up for a surprise cameo later in the series. And the return seems even more promising when you read the series finale description: “Act Two of HSM 3 Opening Night is shaken up by surprise guests and looming decisions.”\n\nIn an interview published August 4, creator Tim Federle confirmed to Trib Total Media that he reached out to High School Musical‘s original leads Efron and Hudgens about appearing on the show, but sadly neither of them are in the final season.\n\n“I got the feeling with Zac and Vanessa, who I don’t know personally but I’m a fan, reading the tea leaves, that by the time you get into negotiating what this would take, we’re gonna wrap and the show will be over,” he said. So what about Tisdale?\n\nIs Ashley Tisdale In High School Musical: The Musical: The Series Season 4?\n\nFederle also reached out to Ashley Tisdale about returning, and though her character Sharpay’s brother Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) returned for Season 4, Tisdale wasn’t in the farewell season either.\n\n“Ashley called me personally and was so lovely. She’s very busy launching brands and it just wasn’t the right timing,” Federle said. However, in a 2021 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Tisdale explained why we might not see her reprise her role again.\n\n“I just feel like I wouldn’t be able to really do that again and give it justice,” Tisdale said. “You know what I’m saying? I think at that moment in time, I was very unaware of myself and my surroundings, and I feel like that’s a big part of Sharpay. She is just not really aware, and so as I grew up and became more aware, I think that it’s just something that it wouldn’t be the same. It’s so good, and it’s like, for me, I would hate to ruin something that is perfect for that moment, and yeah, I don’t think I could go back to it.”\n\nOK, so no Troy, Gabriella, or Sharpay…but what about the return of Olivia Rodrigo’s Nini?\n\nDoes Olivia Rodrigo Return For High School Musical: The Musical: The Series Season 4?\n\nSorry to be the biggest letdown, but Rodrigo doesn’t appear in the Season 4 finale of HSMTMTS either. However, Ricky does reference her in the penultimate episode by handing out cards she wrote her former cast-mates on opening night of High School Musical 3: Senior Year.\n\nThough the four highly-anticipated cameos didn’t work out, HSMTMTS Season 4 still features a fair share of original cast members, along with a satisfying storyline for OG HSMTMTS character EJ Caswell (Matt Cornett)."
