        "text": "I see nothing wrong with her doing this. Granted, she's a celebrity so she'll catch some flak for it, but it's not like she was naked with 3 guys chugging vodka, with a joint in her hand. It's a flirty nude photo for Zac, she was obviously trying to spice things up a little in their relationship, and somehow someone got it and leaked it to the press. I think that the person who leaked it is a(n) $%@^&%#$%^ (Fill in explicative of your choosing).\n\nWhile I would not want my teenage daughter doing somthing like that (what mother would:shrug: ), I agree with your post. Its not like she posed for playboy....it was intended to be something personal between her and her boyfriend. It was stupid, but only because she should have known there was a chance the pictures could get out. I did stupid things when I was a teenager too. I really do not think this is going to hurt her career at all. In fact, as others have said it will probably help it because it is drawing attention to her name.\n\nNot an official statment from Disney, but close enough:\n\nDisney Backs 'High School Musical' Star\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The Walt Disney Co. is sticking with the 18-year-old star of its wildly successful \"High School Musical\" franchise, despite her \"lapse in judgment\" in posing for racy photos that were leaked to the Internet.\n\nVanessa Hudgens apologized Friday for the photos, which show her smiling as she posed naked and in underwear in a bedroom with a red curtain behind her.\n\n\"Vanessa has apologized for what was obviously a lapse in judgment,\" said Disney Channel spokeswoman Patti McTeague. \"We hope she's learned a valuable lesson.\"\n\nShe said negotiations were ongoing to land all the actors for a \"High School Musical 3\" feature film — including Hudgens.\n\nHudgens, who played the brainy Gabriella in the first two made-for-cable TV movies, told her fans she was sorry.\n\n\"I am embarrassed over this situation and regret having ever taken these photos,\" she said. \"I am thankful for the support of my family and friends.\"\n\nHudgens' publicist, Jill Fritzo, wouldn't say anything about who took the pictures and how they slipped out onto the Internet.\n\nThe bookworm Gabriella was the love interest of Troy, the basketball star played by pinup king Zac Efron. The sequel's premiere on Disney Channel last month attracted more than 17 million viewers, making it the summer's most-watched TV program.\n\nHudgen is a superstar among the preteen set, and Disney has spun a wide merchandising net around the series with albums and concert tours. She and Efron reportedly date in real life, making them big attractions for celebrity magazines.\n\nThe films' wholesome nature — for a company that has made its name on family-friendly fare for generations — is a big part of its success. Parents can relax with their children watching, knowing it won't make for any uncomfortable questions.\n\nGabriella and Troy coo, they make googly eyes, they barely kiss. Gabriella would doubtlessly blush at the idea of a young actress posing for nude photos.\n\nIf Disney executives had cut ties to Hudgens, not wanting the company's name associated with anything not G-rated, they would have run the risk of upsetting a formula that has made the company millions upon millions of dollars.\n\nHow would parents explain to the show's young fans that the old Gabriella was being replaced by another actress?\n\n\"That's her private life, not her public life. That picture got leaked by somebody who broke a trust with her,\" said Michele Smith of Westborough, Mass., whose 8-year-old daughter Kathryn is a devoted \"High School Musical\" fan.\n\nDropping her from future movies or other \"High School Musical\" projects would not only be unfair to Hudgens but to fans such as Kathryn, Smith said.\n\n\"If Vanessa is not in the movie, my daughter would not be so excited to see it,\" she said.\n\nSmith said she hopes that Kathryn doesn't hear about the photo but, if she does, she's prepared to talk about it. She'll say that it's something private for Vanessa that shouldn't have been shared.\n\nThe best thing for Disney was to do nothing, said Michael Levine, a Hollywood image consultant and author of 18 books.\n\n\"What they shouldn't do is make a bigger deal out of it than is necessary,\" he said. \"The picture is not salacious.\"\n\nMichael Sands, a publicist whose clients have included the divorce attorney for Britney Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline, said Hudgens should be commended for coming forward quickly and saying it was her pictures.\n\n\"She's very talented and this is a big cash cow for Disney,\" he said.\n\nhttp://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iRClhbahioyqolEF1TK3n5Rrc7tA\n\nWhile that article seems like Disney is on her side, it only says that they've acknowledged her apology, but not necessarily are \"backing her.\"\n\nI think that her role in the film is pretty safe, but Disney has only denied reports they were thinking about replacing her. But that doesn't mean that they might not do it later down the line.\n\nThey may not want to bring attention to the situation right now, especially since the High School Musical 2 Dance-A-Long premieres tonight and the DVD of HSM 2 still needs to be promoted (both of which Vanessa will take an active role in). But they might think about replacing here later down the line.\n\nBut I think she will probably still get the part. Maybe her admitting to the situation actually helper her, rather than hurt her, by presenting her in a better light for Disney and they will forgive her.\n\nWhy deny them?\n\nI wanna know why take them, but hey... She shoulda denied them. It may have slowly gone away had she. By telling people they were hers, she probably just lost one of the best gigs she'll ever get.\n\nFor the original question, I don't care about HSM, so I don't care if they get a new person. I do think it would be real stupid to replace her with the Cheetah Girl though. She looks nothing like the original at all. It would bug me in any other franchise I am a fan of that replaced a character with someone who looks nothing like the last one. That's just me though...\n\nUnkadug, it's bad because it's wrong morally. I think our country has become way to easy with the media and our morals. We all know it's wrong, we all know it's bad. 50 years ago you would've been called a criminal had you do this. The other thing is that she represents Disney now, and Disney is supposed to be family. It has the Disney name on it and goes to little kids. Would you let your children see these photos? Would you find it ok for anyone's kid to see this, or for someone to show there kid this?\n\nUnkadug, it's bad because it's wrong morally.

You have the right to your opinion, but keep in mind that others may not agree with you.\n\nNow if I were a parent, of course I wouldn't want my kids to see it. However, if they did, I wouldn't get ed at her for doing it, with the context it's in. Now, if it was a Lindsey Lohan-esqe photo, then I would be mad at her, but it was an innocent photo intended for her boyfriend only.\n\nI wanna know why take them, but hey...\n\nProbably because she is young and made a mistake. Her mistakes just happen to end up on the national stage when someone rats her out.\n\nShe shoulda denied them. It may have slowly gone away had she.

She took a private picture. The criminal is most likely the person that stole the picture and published it.\n\nThe other thing is that she represents Disney now, and Disney is supposed to be family.

She also showed some ability to learn from her mistakes and took responsibility (probably against advice). No, I don't want my kid seeing these and I would be very mad if something like this happened, but I would also be proud of them if they handled themselves in this manner after being embarrassed int he national media.\n\nProbably because she is young and made a mistake.
