        "text": "Out of our league! Vanessa Hudgens has accrued a massive net worth since her breakout role in Disney Channel’s High School Musical. The actress, who is engaged to baseball player Cole Tucker, has gone on to make a name for herself on and off camera. Keep reading for details on Vanessa’s net worth and how she makes money.\n\nWhat Is Vanessa Hudgens’ Net Worth?\n\nThe Spring Breakers actress is worth an estimated $18 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nVanessa Is an Actress\n\nProbably best known for her role as Gabriella Montez in the High School Musical saga, Vanessa got her big break when she was just a teenager. While it’s unclear how much Vanessa took home from starring in four HSM films, the franchise catapulted her into superstardom and led to many acting opportunities.\n\nShe went on to star in such films as Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, alongside Dwayne Johnson, Bad Boys for Life and Second Act.\n\nApart from her roles on camera, the California native showcased her talents on stage. In 2010, she landed the role of Mimi in the musical Rent, which was directed by actor Neil Patrick Harris. She later appeared in two live television performances, 2016’s Grease: Live where she starred as Rizzo and 2019’s Rent: Live as Maureen Johnson.\n\nVanessa Is a Singer\n\nIn addition to launching her acting career, High School Musical also allowed Vanessa to show off her vocal abilities. The Princess Switch actress recorded several songs for the film’s soundtrack, including “Breaking Free,” which reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nFollowing the success of the first film, Vanessa launched her own music career with the September 2006 release of her debut album, V.\n\nWith hits such as “Come Back to Me” and “Say OK,” V debuted at No. 24 on the US Billboard 200 chart and sold over 30,000 copies in its first week. After Vanessa’s second album, Identified, failed to reach the same success, she decided to step away from singing to focus on her film career.\n\nVanessa Is a Host\n\nVanessa’s personality shines through in her film roles, making her transition to hosting seamless. The Thirteen actress has hosted awards shows such as the 2022 MTV Movie & TV Awards, red carpets like the 2022 Oscars Pre-Show and talk shows like Live! With Kelly & Ryan."
