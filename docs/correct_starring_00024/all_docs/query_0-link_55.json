        "text": "Earlier this year, the Disney Channel classic High School Musical passed its 15th year anniversary. The made-for-TV movie surpassed expectations to become one of the most culturally defining franchises for the Disney network at the time. It jumpstarted the careers of still-famous actors Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens and became a memorable trilogy that concluded with a big-screen run for 2008’s High School Musical 3. Could we ever bet on a fourth film from the original cast?\n\nWhile there are no High School Musical sequels in development with the original cast, fans are certainly interested in the idea. A fan-made trailer of High School Musical 4 recently went viral on TikTok. Take a look:\n\n@tijani__\n\nOne TikTok user posted a snippet from a fake teaser trailer for High School Musical 4 that was uploaded on YouTube back in January to go along with the 15th anniversary and it got a lot of Disney fans excited for the idea. The TikTok has been viewed by over one million people since it was posted one day ago and tons of commenters agreed that it “needs” to happen. Here’s the full trailer:\n\nThe fan-made teaser uses clips from a number of different projects from the High School Musical cast’s careers to craft an emotional followup to their stories 15 years after the Wildcats first got together at East High School. Troy, Gabriella and the rest of the alumni would each be 31 these days and lead very different lives than they did in the Disney Channel trilogy.\n\nThe movie seems to imagine Zac Efron’s Troy and Vanessa Hudgens’ Gabriella reuniting after breaking up in the past. According to the trailer, Gabriella gets invited to her ex boyfriend’s wedding, but Troy can’t stop thinking about his high school sweetheart. It seems like the couple still has feelings for one another and contemplate risking it all for the start of something new.\n\nOf course there are restraints with stitching together clips from Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens’ other projects, but the trailer does a decent job of giving us a taste of what a High School Musical 4 could look like and it definitely sold some fans on it. One commenter said “don’t play with my emotions like this,” whilst another one tagged a friend and stated “our lives would be complete if this was true.”"
