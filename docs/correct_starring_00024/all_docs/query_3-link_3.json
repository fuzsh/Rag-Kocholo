The first High School Musical spawned a hit soundtrack, a worldwide concert tour, a show at Walt Disney World, and even a book series that helped Hudgens land in Forbes magazine's list of top-earning stars under 21.\" In the list, the 18-year-old Hudgens was No. 7 with estimated earnings of $2 million. Hudgens started concentrating on her music career by signing a record deal with Hollywood Records in 2006 as the start of her solo career, but first covered the song \"Colors Of The Wind\" for Disneymania 5 album in that same year.\n\nHudgens confirmed, in an October 2007 interview with Teen Magazine, that she has been dating her High School Musical series co-star Zac Efron, the actor who plays Gabriella's boyfriend Troy Bolton, and had been since the filming of High School Musical.

V debuted on the Billboard 200 in early October 2006 at number twenty-four on the chart, with 34,000 copies sold that week.

In the end of 2007, she had performed \"The Christmas Song\" along with Katharine McPhee and Ne-Yo for \"Christmas In Washington\" event.\n\nIdentified[]\n\nHer second album, Identified, was released on July 1st, 2008.\n\nOther Projects[]\n\nPrevious to High School Musical, she guest-starred on a number of television shows and played Tintin in the 2004 remake of \"Thunderbirds\". She also will be starring as Sam in the upcoming movie \"Bandslam\".\n\nThe long-format Sears video was shot by Grammy award-winning director Joseph Kahn, who is renowned in the world of music videos for his work with Britney Spears, Eminem, Mariah Carey, U2, Destiny's Child and Black Eyed Peas, among others. \"I like to make a fashion statement by changing up my look with different styles,\" explains Hudgens in the video. \"Sears is a great place for those heading back to school this year because you can find an entire wardrobe of fun 'looks' to suit any mood or fashion sense. Plus, since the clothes are so affordable, you can easily switch styles and really get noticed when you arrive back at school.\"\n\nHudgens is also currently a Neutrogena spokesperson. \"Vanessa Hudgens has an energetic, dynamic personality that will truly complement the spirit of Neutrogena. We are pleased to welcome her to our team\", says Neutrogena President, North America, Jim Colleran. As a new spokesperson for Neutrogena, Hudgens will be featured in both national TV and print campaigns. She joins fellow Neutrogena spokespersons Kelly Preston, Susie Castillo, Gabrielle Union, Hayden Panettiere, Julie Bowen, Kristin Kreuk and Paola Rey, each of whom will continue in their role as Neutrogena representatives. In September 2008, she appeared in the Neutrogena Fresh Face Concert.\n\nOn September 6th, 2007, controversy erupted after provocative photos of Hudgens surfaced online. Two showed her posing in suggestive lingerie, and another showed her nude. A statement from her publicist claims that the photo was taken privately and it was \"unfortunate\" that they were released on the Internet. Hudgens later apologized, saying that she was \"embarrassed over the situation\" and regretted having \"taken [those] photos.\" Disney Channel spokeswoman Patti McTeague indicated that Disney will still be working with Hudgens, stating, \"Vanessa has apologized for what was obviously a lapse in judgment. We hope she's learned a valuable lesson.\" After the scandal blew over, Hudgens was quoted as saying, \"I'm much better now. But truthfully I don't like talking about it. It was something that was meant to be private, and even though it isn't anymore, I'd still like to keep it as private as I can. It was very traumatic, and I am extremely upset it happened. I hope all my fans can learn from my mistake and make smart decisions. But I wouldn't have been able to get through it if it wasn't for my family, friends, and fans, who supported me all along the way\". Early speculation that Vanessa Hudgens would be dropped from High School Musical 3 due to her nude photo scandal proved untrue. Although it was reported by OK! Magazine that Vanessa would be replaced by Adrienne Bailon or Sabrina Bryan from the Cheetah Girls in High School Musical 3, Access Hollywood confirmed that the cast was still in negotiations and Vanessa would not be cut from High School Musical 3. \"Totally untrue. It is an old rumor,\" Vanessa's representative told Access, \"OK! Magazine never bothered to check the fact with me, but they did call Disney who said it wasn't true, but yet OK! ran it anyway. Apparently, OK! Magazine was having a slow news day.\"\n\nHudgens was sued by music producer Johnny Vieira, who claims she reneged on a deal to share her earnings with him after he helped make her a star. In the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Vieira accuses Hudgens and father, Greg Hudgens, of breach of contract and fraud, seeking more than $27 million in damages. Hudgens' record label, Hollywood, also is named as a defendant in the suit. Vieira said he was dumped from Hudgens's management team soon after she was cast in HSM. However, \"it became clear that Hudgens and her new 'team' ... all directed by her father ... would take every possible opportunity to deprive Vieira of the benefits to be derived from the settlement agreement,\" the lawsuit says. Hudgens' publicist could not immediately be reached for comment. A Disney spokesman said the company had not had a chance to review the lawsuit.\". According to the suit, they subsequently reached a settlement under which Hudgens agreed to pay Vieira a percentage of her earnings from her first three albums under her solo recording contract with Hollywood Records.\n\nRecently, Hudgens bought a home in Studio City, California for $2.75 million.\n\nDreamWorks Animation announced Vanessa Hudgens voice Bloom in the movie version of Tom and Jerry.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nUs Weekly said Hudgens and her High School Musical series co-star Zac Efron met in 2005 while making the first High School Musical flick, and became a romantic item about two years later.\" The two were paired together during the audition process and got the part because of their chemistry. The two ended their relationship in December 2010. Hudgens briefly dated Journey 2 the Mysterious Island co-star Josh Hutcherson, but the two are now \"good friends\". Vanessa dated fellow actor, Austin Butler from the fall of 2011 to January 2020.\n\nHudgens was represented by William Morris Agency but signed on to Creative Artists Agency in 2011.\n\nIn 2006, Hudgens's earnings were estimated to be $2 million.Hudgens was included in Forbes richest list in early 2007, and the Forbes article noted that she was included in Young Hollywood's Top Earning-Stars. On December 12, 2008, Hudgens was ranked #20 in the list of Forbes \"High Earners Under 30\", having reported to have an estimated earnings of $3 million in 2008. She was number 62 at FHMs Sexiest Women in the World of 2008 and number 42 in the 2009 list.Hudgens is also featured in Maxims lists.She was included in Peoples annual \"100 Most Beautiful People\" 2008 and 2009 lists.\n\nOn September 6, 2007, photos of Hudgens appeared online, one showing her posing in lingerie and another showing her nude. A statement from her publicist claims that the photo was taken privately and it was unfortunate that they were released on the Internet. Hudgens later apologized, saying that she was \"embarrassed over the situation\" and regretted having \"taken [those] photos.\"Hudgens subsequently released a statement indicating that she declined to comment further on the scandal. OK! magazine speculated that Hudgens would be dropped from High School Musical 3 as a result of the images, but The Walt Disney Company denied this, saying, \"Vanessa has apologized for what was obviously a lapse in judgment. We hope she's learned a valuable lesson.\"\n\nIn August 2009, another set of pictures showing Hudgens topless emerged on the Internet. Hudgens's representatives did not comment, though her lawyers requested the removal of the pictures from the Internet. In late 2009, Hudgens sued \"www.moejackson.com\" for posting nude 'self-portrait photographs of her taken on a mobile phone in a private home. Hudgens later commented on the photos' impact on her career in the October issue of Allure with, \"Whenever anybody asks me, would I do nudity in a film, if I say that it's something I'm not comfortable with, they're like, 'Bullshit, you've already done it.' If anything, it makes it more embarrassing, because that was a private thing. It's screwed up that someone screwed me over like that. At least some people are learning from my mistake.\" According to Us Weekly, further pictures were released on the Internet March 15, 2011 as well as a nude video.\n\nBrian Schall sued Hudgens in 2007 for an alleged \"breach of contract\"; according to the suit, Schall claims he advanced costs and expenses on Hudgens's behalf for her songwriting and recording career. Schall claims Hudgens owed him $150,000 after helping her earn more than $5 million for her music career. Hudgens argued that she was a 16-year-old minor when she signed the contract in October 2005, and therefore too young to do so. She subsequently disaffirmed it on October 9, 2008. Papers filed in court by her lawyer say California's Family Code \"provides that the contract of a minor is voidable and may be disaffirmed before (age 18) or within a reasonable time afterward.\" In 2008, Hudgens was sued by Johnny Vieira, who claims he was owed a share of Hudgens' advances, royalties and merchandising revenue in exchange for his management services. Vieira accuses Hudgens of abandoning her talent team as soon as she became a commercial name in the High School Musical era. In early May 2009, the case was settled.\n\nIn March 2020, Hudgens made a video in which she said it is \"inevitable\" that people will die from coronavirus. The video caused controversy because she appeared to be minimizing the impact of the disease and the need for preventative measures. She subsequently apologized for her \"insensitive\" remarks."
