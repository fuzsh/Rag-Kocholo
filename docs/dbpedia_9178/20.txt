Known to millions as one of the hosts of the "Today" (NBC, 1952-) show, Savannah Guthrie was born in Melbourne, Australia to an American family in 1971. By the time she was two, her family relocated back to the United States, making a home in Tucson, Arizona. Guthrie would graduate magna Cum laude from the University of Arizona with a BA in journalism in 1993, and began working as a broadcast journalist. She would take her talents to a number of network affiliate stations in Arizona, Missouri, and Washington D.C., before deciding on a career change and enrolling in law school at Georgetown University, graduating magna Cum laude again in 2002. After scoring first place on the Arizona Bar Exam, Guthrie worked mainly in litigation for a short time before she began melding the two halves of her professional expertise, becoming a trial correspondent for CourtTV in 2004. Three years later, she became a national correspondent for NBC News, where she was made the station's official White House correspondent. Then in 2011, Guthrie became a co-host on "Today," exposing her to a new audience and a new style of presenting news and interviews. She took to it extremely well, and was made the show's co-anchor when Ann Curry left the program the following year.
