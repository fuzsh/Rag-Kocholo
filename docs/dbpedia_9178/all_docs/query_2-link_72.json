Also how much we talk about our kids and how much we want to post pictures of our kids. We want to be really careful about that and thoughtful.\"\n\nSavannah added: \"We try to bounce ideas off each other. Our kids are the same age but we're also in a similar place in life and similar career.\"\n\nShe detailed how she and her NBC co-worker are “real resources for each other” and gab about their lives even in the seconds before they go live on air at the Rockefeller Center.\n\nSavannah said: \"Right before 'Today', we're talking about stories, we're talking about the news, but lots of mornings we're also talking about, 'Should I send my kid to all-day preschool or should it be half day?' 'What do you do when this one doesn't want to sleep and she's waking up the other one?'\"\n\n\"It's so unusual and it's so wonderful to have somebody who's your coworker who's not only a mom but a mom of kids of virtually the same age. And so we're kind of going through a lot of the same things at the same time.\""
