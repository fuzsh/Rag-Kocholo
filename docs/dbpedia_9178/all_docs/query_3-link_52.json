Angry and combative, Trump refused to denounce the QAnon conspiracy group — and only testily did so regarding white supremacists. Trump and Biden were supposed to spend Thursday night on the same debate stage in Miami. The presidential rivals took questions in different cities on different networks: Trump on NBC from Miami, Biden on ABC from Philadelphia.

The Detroit case was filed in 2016 on behalf of Hall and other students who attended rodent-infested, crumbling schools that lacked certified teachers and up-to-date textbooks. A similar case was filed on behalf of students in Rhode Island last year, asserting that they were denied a basic civics education. “It would lay down a huge marker in terms of how all the states across the nation fund or don’t fund their schools,” Black said. “Every school in the country would be affected,” said Michael Rebell, a Teachers College, Columbia University professor who brought the Rhode Island case.\n\nThis Oct. 31, 2019 photo shows former Fox News personality Gretchen Carlson during an interview in New York. \"It would be nice to be able to be able to tell my full story,\" Carlson said.
