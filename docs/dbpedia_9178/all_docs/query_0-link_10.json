        "text": "What is Savannah Guthrie's Net Worth and Salary?\n\nSavannah Guthrie is an American journalist and attorney who has a net worth of $40 million. Savannah Guthrie is best known for hosting the NBC's \"Today\" show. She has been a primary host of \"The Today Show\" since 2012 and currently co-hosts the program alongside Hoda Kotb. She previously worked as a journalist and a co-anchor for various networks, including MSNBC and CourtTV.\n\nSalary\n\nFor her various duties at NBC, most notably her work on \"Today,\" Guthrie is paid a salary of $8 million per year by NBC.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSavannah Clark Guthrie was born on December 27th, 1971, in Melbourne, Australia. At the time, her father was working in Australia â€“ but the family moved back to the States and settled in Tucson, Arizona, two years after Savannah's birth. After graduating from high school, Savannah Guthrie attended the University of Arizona. While there, she earned her B.A. in Journalism and eventually graduated cum laude.\n\nAlmost a decade later, Savannah Guthrie attended the Georgetown University Law Center and graduated in 2002 with a Juris Doctor Degree. Once again, Guthrie graduated with honors.\n\nCareer\n\nIn the early days of Savannah Guthrie's journalism career, she worked for ABC and NBC affiliates in Tucson and Columbia, Missouri. Towards the end of the 90s, Guthrie left Arizona and worked for an NBC affiliate in Washington, D.C. A highlight of her career during this time was covering the September 11th terror attacks.\n\nSavannah then decided to further her education and obtained her law degree. She also scored first place in the Arizona Bar Exam and gained recognition for her work with victims of domestic violence. After working for a law firm that specialized in white-collar criminal defense, Guthrie blended journalism experience with her legal knowledge and became a trial correspondent for CourtTV.\n\nWhile working for CourtTV, Guthrie gained attention for covering Supreme Court Judiciary Committee hearings, murder trials, and various celebrity cases involving figures like Martha Stewart and Michael Jackson. She then moved to NBC as a correspondent, covering various political events such as Sarah Pallin's vice presidential race. She eventually became NBC's White House correspondent.\n\nAfter appearing on NBC Nightly News, Guthrie began to appear in a more substantial role on Today. During this time, Savannah Guthrie also became NBC's chief legal analyst. By 2012, she had become a co-anchor for Today. During her time on Today, Guthrie has become well-known for interviewing various celebrities. In 2017, Guthrie became the host of Today alongside Hoda Kotb following the departure of Matt Lauer.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAlthough Savannah Guthrie married BBC News presenter Mark Orchard in 2005, the couple divorced in 2009. Following this, Guthrie began a relationship with Democratic political consultant Michael Feldman. They married in 2014. That year, Guthrie had her first child. She later had another child with Feldman in 2016. In 2019, Savannah Guthrie suffered a torn retina when her son thrust a toy into her eye. After receiving extensive surgery, she was able to return to work in 2020.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2012, two years before he married Savannah, Michael Feldman purchased a condo in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City for $3.5 million. In 2017, the couple listed the property for sale with an asking price of $5.995 million. They ultimately did not accept any offers and still own this property today.\n\nIn June of 2017, Savannah and Michael paid $7.114 million for a second Tribeca apartment. In January 2023, they listed this second property for $7.1 million. They reduced the price to $6.5 million in September 2023.\n\nIn 2014, not long after marrying, Savannah and Michael paid $2.7 million for a 7,000-square-foot home on 20 acres in the Catskills in upstate New York."
