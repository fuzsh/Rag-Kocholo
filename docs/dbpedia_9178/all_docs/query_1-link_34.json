        "text": "Savannah Clark Guthrie is an Australian-born American broadcast journalist and attorney. She is a main co-anchor of the NBC News morning show Today, a position she has held since July 2012.\n\nGuthrie joined NBC News in September 2007 as a legal analyst and correspondent, regularly reporting on trials throughout the country. After serving as a White House correspondent between 2008 and 2011 and as co-anchor of the MSNBC program The Daily Rundown in 2010 and 2011, Guthrie was announced as the co-host of Today's third hour alongside Natalie Morales and Al Roker. In that role, she substituted as news anchor and main co-host and appeared as the chief legal analyst across all NBC platforms. Guthrie ceased to be the third-hour co-host and chief legal analyst in 2012 when she replaced Ann Curry as co-anchor of Today.\n\nHistory with the Macy's Parade[]\n\nAfter gaining her spot as one of the main anchors on Today, starting on July 9th, 2012, Guthrie first hosted the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade telecast later that November, in addition to gaining the role as the host for the annual Rockefeller Centre Tree Lighting. After Matt Lauer was fired mere days after the 2017 Parade, Guthrie retained her hosting position, and it was later confirmed that Hoda Kotb would take Lauer's place the following year in 2018.\n\nTrivia[]"
