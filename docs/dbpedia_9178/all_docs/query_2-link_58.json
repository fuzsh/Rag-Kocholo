        "text": "Savannah Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Savannah is a girl's name of Spanish origin meaning \"flat tropical grassland\".\n\nA place name with a deep Southern accent, the once-obscure Savannah shot to fame, with others of its genre, on the heels of the best seller Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, which was set in the mossy Georgia city of Savannah. Originally a substitute for the overused Samantha, Savannah is now becoming overused itself, long among the top girls' names starting with S.\n\nBefore that, there were Savannahs in the novel and movie The Prince of Tides, in the Terry McMillan hit novel and film Waiting to Exhale, played by Whitney Houston and, even earlier, in a 1982 movie called Savannah Smiles.\n\nSavannah has actually been on the popularity list since records started being kept in the 1880's; she's been in the Top 100 since 1993. Desperate Housewives' Marcia Cross chose Savannah for her twin daughter, and it's the name of Queen Elizabeth's first great-grandchild. And Savannah Guthrie can be seen every morning on the Today Show."
