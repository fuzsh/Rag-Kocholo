        "text": "Her family spent all of Sunday at the local Baptist Church — for Sunday school, morning service, choir practice, and night service.\n\n\"Faith was so woven into our daily lives, we liked to say that God was the sixth member of the Guthrie family,\" she wrote in a blog post.\n\nUntil then Nancy had raised the family full time. But after her husband's death, she went back to work. She landed a job in public relations at the University of Arizona, which meant Savannah and her sister Annie could go to college tuition-free.\n\nAs for her father's death, Guthrie said it had made her more sensitive, gentler, and kinder.\n\n\"Of course it was terrible, and I think about him every day — but there's something about a dramatic event like that that makes you a bit more tender, a bit softer,\" she told Elle.\n\nGuthrie followed her mother's advice and earned a journalism degree from the University of Arizona, graduating cum laude in 1993.\n\n\"It was only in college when I started taking journalism classes that the fire was lit, and I really wanted to accomplish things. Before that, I was happy to hang out with my friends and listen to grunge music and wear my chunky heels,\" she told Refinery 29.\n\nWhile studying, she was published in the Tombstone Epitaph, a community newspaper, and \"Arizona Illustrated.\" She also interned with Arizona Gov. Fife Symington and Sen. Dennis DeConcini.\n\nAccording to NPR, she wanted bigger challenges than being a local TV reporter, so she enrolled in law school at Georgetown University.\n\nGuthrie had been inspired by the coverage of the Simpson and Menendez brothers trials on Court TV. But it was a stressful time for Guthrie.\n\n\"Each morning in D.C., I'd wake up and read the Bible. In a little notebook, I started writing down verses that particularly spoke to me,\" she wrote in a blog post. \"On nights that I worried about a tough exam or the future that felt so uncertain, I'd turn to those verses to help me sleep, or calm my anxious heart.\"\n\nAlthough this would be the extent of her law career, she said the legal training helped her journalism.\n\nStemming from her time as a lawyer, her goal in interviews is to always try to think of a question interviewees would rather not be asked, just to see what they would say.\n\n\"It wasn't a cliff; it was the federal courthouse here in Washington, DC,\" she said in a commencement speech.\n\nMonths before she was due to start as a law clerk for a federal judge, she had an epiphany.\n\n\"It wasn't my dream. What I really wanted was to go back to my roots in journalism. I still had that nagging hope that one day I could really make it in television news,\" she said.\n\nGuthrie went and spoke to the judge. He asked why she didn't come work for him for a year since it would help her career, especially since she didn't have a job lined up.\n\n\"And that's when I looked at him and told him: 'I know you're right. What you say makes perfect sense,\" she said. \"But I also know myself, and if I don't do this, right this minute, I will never have the guts again.\"\n\nShe covered the White House until June 2011 and was part of the NBC team that won an Emmy for their coverage of election night.\n\nAs for actually liking the job, Guthrie told The Hollywood Reporter, \"There's just so much news and information around the White House and Washington that you never can feel that you know it all. I always felt like I was cramming for exams. I loved it and I hated it at the same time.\"\n\nIn 2013, Feldman proposed to her while they were on holiday in Turks and Caicos, and in 2014, they got married in Tucson, Arizona. At the wedding, they announced she was four months pregnant with their first child.\n\nEach of the 80 guests received a handwritten personalized note, each with a monogrammed luggage tag, which was a joke about all the flights both Guthrie and Feldman have to take for their careers.\n\nShe told the Hollywood Reporter that the criticism she receives is often sexist.\n\n\"Everybody gets 'You're biased,'\" she said. \"But you may also get 'Why do you roll your eyes and make that face? Why does your voice sound so shrill?'\"\n\n\"Honestly, I'm interested in fair criticism. I'm not perfect. I try really hard to stay neutral. But often that's not what you're finding on social media. You're finding people who are very opinionated and detect bias in anyone who does not share that opinion,\" she continued.\n\nShe said, \"For the moment, all we can say is that we are heartbroken. I'm heartbroken for Matt — he is my dear, dear friend and my partner. And he is beloved by many, many people here, and I'm heartbroken for the brave colleague who came forward to tell her story.\"\n\n\"I know it wasn't easy for our colleague Brooke to come forward then, it's not easy now, and we support her and any women who have come forward with claims,\" she said. \"It's just very painful for all of us at NBC and who are at the Today show. It's very, very, very difficult.\"\n\nShe called in to 'Today' and informed viewers that Charlie \"threw a toy train right at my eye and tore my retina.\"\n\n\"I lost vision in my right eye about 24 hours later, and then it turned out to be kind of serious,\" she said. \"They were afraid my retina was detached, so they told me to take it easy.\"\n\nBut by December, her eye was on the mend. She had at least five laser surgeries to reattach her retina, which meant she didn't have to have undergo retinal surgery."
