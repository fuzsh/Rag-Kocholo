        "text": "Skeptical answer\n\nOne could give a skeptic's answer for any form of this question in the context of a political campaign: presumably the candidates feel this answer will be more likely to get them nominated by their party in their campaign for President of the United States.\n\nHowever, although this position is not made explicit, it is consistent with the idea included in the 2016 Democratic Party platform that describes healthcare as a right.\n\nStated reason\n\nSince you mention Joe Biden in particular, he has said in a recent interview:\n\n“I think undocumented people need to have a means by which they can be covered when they’re sick,” he said in a CNN interview, adding, “This is just common decency.”\n\n“In an emergency they should have health care. Everybody should,” he added. \"How do you say 'You're undocumented, I'm gonna let you die, man?'\"\n\ntext via The Hill, original interview at CNN.\n\nDemocratic party platform\n\nThe Democratic party platform from 2016 states (emphasis mine):\n\nDemocrats believe that health care is a right, not a privilege, and our health care system should put people before profits.\n\nThis could possibly be interpreted as health care being a right for American citizens, but it could also be interpreted as health care being a human right, and if illegal immigrants are humans then they would be deserving of that right. The latter interpretation is also consistent with the Democratic Party's position on immigration, which treats the current system as broken and acknowledges the role that undocumented immigrants play in the US economy:\n\nThose immigrants already living in the United States, who are assets to their communities and contribute so much to our country, should be incorporated completely into our society through legal processes that give meaning to our national motto: E Pluribus Unum.\n\nand specifically on healthcare:\n\nWe will work to ensure that all Americans—regardless of immigration status—have access to quality health care. That means expanding community health centers, allowing all families to buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges, supporting states that open up their public health insurance programs to all persons, and finally enacting comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nI would add that this platform position does not fit the promise of \"free\" health care in the title of this question, but that promise is not necessarily implied by the question asked of the candidates, either.\n\nStatus quo\n\nThe New York Times has a recent article discussing the status quo for healthcare for illegal immigrants. Currently federal funds are not supposed to be spent for healthcare for undocumented immigrants, and they are ineligible at the federal level for Medicare and Medicaid, although there are some states that do provide coverage.\n\nHowever, there currently is indirect federal funding for health care for undocumented immigrants through centers that treat everyone regardless of circumstance and indirectly through hospitals that are ethically and morally required to treat ill people, whose cost of care is absorbed by those who are insured. Essentially, people in the United States illegally who do not have insurance are in a similar situation to citizens who do not have insurance: the care they do have access to is emergency care rather than preventative care.\n\nBiden's position relative to the status quo is not entirely clear, because if he limits his stance to emergency care, then emergency care already exists. I am unaware of and did not find specific proposals from any of the candidates for how they would change the status quo.\n\nSummary\n\nIt seems like the field of Democrats running for President is moving towards treating healthcare as a human right. The candidates may also want to further separate themselves from US government policies that currently house immigrants, and particularly children, in poor conditions. At the moment, there are not specific policies proposed by the candidates to change the status quo, and their position is consistent with the Democratic Party platform from the last presidential election cycle.\n\nFirst off, the word \"free\" that was originally in the question is a complete misnomer at best (at worst it would be putting words in their mouths). Nothing is free. Most universal coverage schemes are paid for at least partially through some kind of income or payroll tax, which every employee/employer pays (even if the workers in question are not citizens or are using fake SSN's). So undocumented immigrants for the most part would be paying into these systems, and thus would not be getting anything for \"free\" any more than anyone else would.\n\nThat being said, there are three basic arguments for true Universal coverage. They are generally used together, so look at this as a complete philosophical package, not a menu. You may not necessarily agree with it all, but this is the logic I see used:\n\nIts the morally right thing to do. Jesus himself commanded his followers to treat the sick multiple times. He seemed quite insistent on it. See Matthew 25 (\"I was sick and you took care of me\"), and Matthew 10:8:\n\nCure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without payment; give without payment.\n\nSome Christians may think they have reasons to dismiss the relevance of these directions, but this is a big deal to Christian liberals like Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, and Corey Booker.\n\nOf course these values weren't pulled out of thin air. Nearly all other religions, philosophies, and ethics codes, have some version of the Golden Rule. The basic principles of humanism many atheists are philosophically aligned with demand taking care of the sick and injured. There are certainly some moral systems out there where's it just fine to deny people medical treatment because of who they are, but they are very few. This one is about as universal a human moral code as they come.\n\nIt is the safe thing to do for yourself and those you do care about.\n\nYou may think you and your family are a different class of person than immigrants, but diseases don't. If there are legions of untreated sick people running around the USA, that's a danger for all of us.\n\nIts the financially responsible thing to do.\n\nHospitals are required by law to treat anyone who shows up (see #1 above if you don't like that). Those who can't pay are essentially paid for by higher costs paid by those of us who have coverage. Hospitals are also the most expensive place in our entire medical system. This means the financially stupidest decision possible is to use hospitals as the only place where US residents have universal access to treatment (regardless of status or ability to pay), and that's exactly what we are doing right now.\n\nIt would save all of us collectively a lot of money* if everyone just had coverage down at the general practitioner level, which is the cheapest part of our system.\n\n* - Theoretically. However, the relative expense of our system against those of countries with universal coverage makes a pretty strong case.\n\nThere is another answer which should be more convincing to the right wing.\n\nIt's cheaper.\n\nIf you need to track who's eligible for treatment, deal with co-pays, and all the other paperwork associated with US healthcare, the administration involved is significant. So significant in fact that 30% of the cost of treatment is the cost of administration. The UK and Canada, both of whom have free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare, spend around 15% on administration, and both see that as something which they would like to reduce.\n\nOf course we don't know exactly how many illegal immigrants there are in the US, but the figure as of 2014 was estimated at 14 million, out of a US population of 318 million. If we (naively) assume that immigrants have roughly the same healthcare needs as US citizens, that would require a 4.4% increase in healthcare funding. However the cost saving from eliminating administration gives a potential benefit of 15%.\n\nSo the paradoxical net result is that you get 10% extra money for healthcare by treating more people, because the money you save on managers, laywers and accountants can be spent directly on healthcare."
