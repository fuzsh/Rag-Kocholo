The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:00 a.m., in Room 2525, Dirksen Federal Building and Courthouse, 219 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois, Hon. Rick Boucher [chairman of the subcommittee] presiding. Members present: Representatives Boucher, Rush and Buyer. Also present: Representative Waters. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK BOUCHER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA Mr. Boucher. Good morning to everyone. The Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet will come to order. Today, at the suggestion of our subcommittee colleague, Mr. Rush, we are in Chicago to conduct the subcommittee's second hearing on the proposed combination of two of our nation's largest media and entertainment companies Comcast and NBC Universal. I appreciate the outstanding contributions that Congressman Rush makes to the work of our committee. He is Chairman of our Subcommittee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, and in that role I've had an opportunity to work closely with him as we have together worked to fashion a set of privacy guarantees for internet users. And, of course, he is a member of this Subcommittee and makes a truly valuable contribution to our work. And I want to thank Congressman Rush and his staff for their excellent help in making the arrangements for today's hearing. It's truly been a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to be here. And I know that our focus today on the Comcast-NBC Universal Merger will be aided very much by the testimony that we receive from our witnesses this morning. Comcast is the nation's largest multi-channel video program distributor, the largest retail broadband provider, and the third largest home telephone service provider, as well as the owner of numerous cable channels and regional sports networks. As measured by annual revenues, NBC Universal is the nation's fourth largest media and entertainment company. It owns the NBC and Telemundo television networks, television broadcast stations in some of the largest markets in the United States, cable channels, a movie studio, as well as an interest in the online video programming provider, Hulu.com. The key question for this Subcommittee, as well as for the FCC, and the U.S. Department of Justice who are reviewing this proposed combination is how the proposed combination will affect consumers. And, of course, both of these companies deliver a range of services, and the question is with regard to those services how will consumers be affected. Some combinations benefit consumers by enabling a more efficient delivery of new and better products and services, but there also is the potential for consumer harm due to a limitation of choices that are available to consumers, or by limiting competition in a way that makes services more expensive than they would be in an open market. In our previous hearing, we examined the potential harms that could arise if the merged company restricts the internet delivery of NBC Universal-owned programs that are offered off- line to the public for free today, to web portals that are available only to the Comcast broadband subscribers. We sought and we obtained commitments and assurances from the companies that access to those programs would not be so restricted. Today, we will focus on other potential effects of the merger, including how it will affect the company's practices with respect to diversity and employment, procurement, media programming and philanthropy. I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses on these and other matters. And I want to thank each of our witnesses for taking time to join us here this morning. A number of them have traveled to Chicago for purposes of sharing their views with us, and I very much appreciate your doing so, and being here today. I'm going to recognize both members of the panel for their opening statements, and then we will turn to the testimony of our witnesses. And I'll begin by recognizing the Republican member of our Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet, the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Buyer. [The prepared statement of Chairman Boucher follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE BUYER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA Mr. Buyer. Thank you very much, Mr. Boucher. Welcome to Chicago, welcome to the Midwest. And, Bobby Rush, thank you for having us come here. I brought some Indiana folks with me last night, and I thought I would take in a White Sox game, and it rained. By my calculation, that was probably about an $80 beer, so we sipped it slowly and enjoyed it. And probably the best judgment of the night was during the clearing, we made a run for the taxi. Mr. Rush. Mr. Chairman, if I may add, we do have rain checks in Chicago. Mr. Buyer. Oh, OK. All right. Rain check. I would also like to welcome Maxine Waters for giving up her time in sunny California to come to the Midwest. Thank you, also, for being here. When this joint venture between Comcast and NBC Universal was first proposed, I was most interested in the reaction, or, I should say, the lack of reaction not only by policy makers, but also stakeholders and others within industry. My initial reaction, personally, was about the--in our culture we have something that we don't think about very often, but its silence can be interpreted as acquiescence or an admission. And it's part of our culture. So, when this merger first came out, there was silence. And I was--my curiosity was I did not believe that the silence would be interpreted as an acquiescence to the merger. And my commitment has been to keep an open mind regarding this merger, and to allow the parties to be able to come together and address concerns. And I thank my friend, Mr. Boucher, for doing this. I brought this to him. He also is feeling the same way I was, and he said yes, we're going to have some hearings on this, and we want to go into it, we want to dive into this. Now, the Chairman in his comments about concerns with regard to consumers, and he's correct. And the Department of Justice will do their review on--because of anti-trust and the impact on competition, but we also need an over horizon view. The over horizon view, when you do the long view and you look at the data points that are out there, you have to be really careful about trying to define an image based on what we know today. The reason I say you have to be very careful, because as policy makers, we've done this before. And we've tried to define what we thought it looked like at the moment of calling, and got it wrong. And we're in such a highly dynamic industry that we have to be really very, very careful. I decided to do my due diligence, just as, Mr. Chairman, you are doing yours, so since February, I've met with every industry representative out there from broadcasters, pay TV affiliates, non-affiliates, content providers, carriers. I've done big cable, small cable, satellite. I've met with all the stakeholders that I possibly could. But my take-away from all of these meetings is that, it came out of the hearing we had done in February, that there was a real need to define Comcast's commitment to the network affiliated model of free over-the-air broadcasting, especially as it pertains to localism. Also, protect the value of the network and preventing a cycling of key programming, and migration of this key programming. The other is prevent bypass of the affiliates for first call rights to competing platforms as it pertains to Comcast providing network programming. And, fourth, protect the integrity of the retrans consent process. And, primarily, my concern there lies with the small cable companies insuring that they not get lost by big cable in the retrans consent process leading to less competition and higher prices for consumers. I want to--also, as this began to unfold, I also watched how the non-affiliates began to work out their concerns. Rather than immediately rush to the FCC, they came together, the non- affiliates did, and then took their concerns to Comcast, and they were able to come together in the private marketplace agreement. And then not only was that done, but then Comcast-NBC Universal had come together with their own agreements on many diversity issues. So, it's pretty good. They recognize that there's federal oversight, not only by the FCC, by your Committee, Mr. Chairman, but also by DOJ, so there are a lot of eyes being placed on this. So, the private sector are proceeding, and my reading of both of these agreements that have been done in the private sector, actually, they go beyond what I was even thinking about and considering. So, I want to congratulate the parties for leaning forward and doing what I think is right. So, with that, I yield back. Mr. Boucher. Thank you very much, Mr. Buyer. Thank you for taking the time to take part during this hearing this morning. I, again, want to thank Congressman Rush and his staff for their excellent assistance in arranging for today's hearing, and making sure that we could use the ceremonial courtroom here at the United States Courthouse. And Congressman Rush, I want to recognize you for your opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BOBBY L. RUSH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Rush. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me begin by thanking you so much for the outstanding cooperation and leadership which you have provided to the Subcommittee. And you have really gone beyond what would be normally expected in regards to this hearing. You're in the middle of a tough campaign, and that you would take the time off to leave your district and come to Chicago to convene this hearing. I'm certainly grateful to be part of this. And it's a pretty significant moment in the life of the city of Chicago, here on the eve of the LeBron era. And I will note that I am an eternal optimist. (Laughter.) But, Mr. Chairman, I want to welcome you again, welcome your colleagues and welcome Congresswoman Waters, and my colleague on the Subcommittee, Mr. Buyer from Indiana. I want to welcome each of you to this hearing, and to the city that I love so much. Mr. Chairman, on that day that Comcast and NBC Universal secure their last approval from federal and state regulators to combine their highly attractive, and lucrative, distribution and video programming assets, a very powerful and influential media and information colossus will be born. When that will happen, immediate power to determine what our nation watches, what we read, from where we get our news, and even on which electronic and communications devices those images and data will appear. The $28 billion joint venture between Comcast and NBC Universal will give Comcast, already the country's largest cable and home broadband company, total say and control over the day-to-day operations of the NBC networks; the Telemundo network, NBC's two dozen national cable network channels, including MSNBC, Bravo, CNBC, and partial interests in the Weather Channel, A&E's History and Biography channels, NBC Network News, ``The Today Show,'' ``NBC Sunday Night Football,'' ``Meet the Press,'' and distribution rights to a library of more than 55,000 TV episodes, not to mention the Universal Pictures movie studio and distribution companies. Many of the purported benefits of this proposed combination have been framed in terms of when and where subscribers will realize benefits. Some of the more widely touted subscriber benefits put forward by the parties are that Comcast cable TV subscribers will be able to see movies more quickly after the first showing in theaters, or that because of this transaction TV shows will appear faster on subscribers' cell phones, video-on-demand web sites, and other digital media platforms and devices. These ``whens'' and ``wheres'' are very important, absolutely very important. And I am concerned about these when and wheres, but I'm also equally concerned, however, about what cable television, broadcast TV, news, public affairs, religious and community programs, sporting events and movie content will not be made available to subscribers of Comcast's competitors, or to the competitors of Comcast's new affiliates. And will the same content that is offered to Comcast broadband subscribers be made available to all broadband users, regardless of whom they subscribe to for broadband service? Despite the critical importance of program access and the equitable carriage of network affiliates on Comcast's cable systems, the most important issue of access, as far as I am concerned, the most important issue is minority ownership. As the largest media and information merger since AOL and Time Warner which, incidentally, disrupts community practices in cable and broadcast TV programming in so many markets, the significance of this transaction cannot be underestimated. This represents a real opportunity that minority businesses and investors must not miss. They must be fully engaged. And I am cognizant of the commitment that Comcast made publically last month for increasing diversity of ownership, and diversity in programming. Specifically, Comcast plans on adding these channels over the next three years. As you see, that half of these channels are minority owned or run represents an important and positive step for increased minority ownership. I am delighted with the developments. However, Mr. Chairman, I think that minorities can and will, and must have better seats at the boardroom table, and not just in the movie theaters and watching television in their living rooms. Mr. Chairman, this is an opportunity for us. And I would say during the course of the last few months, I am pleased and interested and somewhat delighted by the approach that Comcast and NBC have made towards satisfying our concerns. I'm still not satisfied. I'm still not there yet, but I want you to know that without any changes, we're just going to end up at the same place. And, Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back the balance of my time. [The prepared statement of Mr. Rush follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Boucher. Thank you very much, Congressman Rush. And we're pleased to have joining us today a gentle lady from California, Ms. Waters. She is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, and while she does not serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee, we're very glad to have her here. She has strong interest in the subject matter we're examining this morning. And, in fact, was a leading participant in a hearing the House Judiciary Committee had on this subject in Los Angeles earlier this year. Ms. Waters, we're glad to have you here, and I'm pleased to recognize you for your statement. STATEMENT OF HON. MAXINE WATERS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity that you've afforded me to come here today to be a part of this hearing. I'm especially appreciative to Congressman Rush for his assistance in making sure that I could participate as a panelist here today. And I'd like to thank all of my colleagues who are here today to participate in what I think is one of the most important hearings relative to media consolidation that we will have on this issue. Mr. Chairman, thank you for organizing this Field Hearing, and, again, allowing me the opportunity to participate. You're right, I have been involved with this issue for quite some time now, and my interest was basically triggered on June 7th, 2010 when the House Committee on the Judiciary held a Field Hearing. Well, it was prior to that time, but I've been in two hearings to date on this issue, and I do have some concern. What I'd like to do is just take a moment and try and explain what those concerns are, and why I have those concerns. Over the past couple of months, I've been active in advocating for a process in the Federal Communications Commission's review of this merger, the opportunities for minorities in media have been severely limited as a result of deregulatory policies, and large media consolidations. This has concentrated our media industry into the control of a mere handful of corporations, constraining opportunities for minority ownership of media licenses. While I'm not presently, and have not indicated direct opposition to the Comcast-NBC merger, I do recognize it as a critical opportunity for both companies to implement a plan of action to address their shortcomings with respect to minority inclusion within their programming, management, ownership, and advertising activities. Ultimately, these diversity considerations are taken into account within the FCC's review proceedings. While both the FCC and DOJ have the statutory authority to review new mergers under our Federal Anti-Trust Laws, the FCC's process allows for a more comprehensive public interest analysis, including a deeply rooted preference for preserving, and enhancing competition, and generally managing the spectrum in the public interest, in the public trust. Therefore, my concerns about this merger are based on the potential impact on diversity, competition, and whether consumers will enjoy diverse and alternative sources of news and entertainment. From what we have gathered about the companies' organizational structures, both Comcast and NBC have a lot of work to do. NBC Universal has 18 corporate executives, while two of the 18 are minorities, including Ms. Paula Madison, who's here today. Their primary responsibilities do not include managing networks, and producing content. Despite Ms. Madison's efforts to work with the key executives to promote diversity throughout NBC Universal, the company continues to fall short in setting tangible benchmarks, and achieving results in increasing minority representation among its high-level management and executive positions. NBCU does not have any African American show runners over its prime time, daytime, or late night programming. This means African Americans are not in positions where they oversee budgets, and the hiring of actors, writers, co-producers, and technical employees. It is important to have diversity in these management positions, because they create employment opportunities for other producers, writers, directors, and actors. Similarly, NBC's Universal Studios do not employee African Americans with the authority to decide which film projects are ultimately given the necessary support to make it to the big screen, that is green light. The President and COO of NBC Universal Studios is a white male. The President and Chairman of Universal Pictures and Focus Features also white. Of the 21 films NBC Universal Pictures released in 2009, only two simply had minority leads. The overwhelming majority of NBC TV content is produced by white individuals, or white- owned production companies. The Presidents of all 12 of the NBC cable networks are white. Ultimately, these individuals are influential in deciding what show runners are hired to produce the television shows that will air on these networks. Thus, it is important to have sufficient minority representation and programming to ensure diversity in content the network produces. Comcast Corporation also has problems with diversity and inclusion. Only one of Comcast's 13 member Board of Directors is an African American. Only two of Comcast's 28 corporate executives are African American. Comcast has 33 division executives, while three of these executives are minorities, there are no African American division executives listed on Comcast's Web site who head Comcast's programming group. When broken down further by each of Comcast's individual cable networks, only one has an African American President, and that is the Style network. There is one Latino executive; however, he is responsible for advertising and sales, not programming. The barriers to ownership for minorities and women have been studied by various universities and non-profit organizations. Currently, TV One is the only United States cable network with significant black ownership. That is Video One, Alfred Liggins, President and CEO, owns 37 percent of TV One. While Comcast carries the network on its mostly widely distributed tier, it is worth noting that Comcast owns 33 states in TV One. In 2007, minorities owned just 3.2 percent of the United States television stations, despite comprising more than 34 percent of the population. In fact, of NBC's more than 200 affiliated television stations, only one is black- owned. Ironically, while the National Urban League and its chapters, among the first of our nation's Civil Rights groups to support the merger, it, too, released a study in 2005 detailing the broadcast networks' failure to have diverse guests on their Sunday morning news shows. The studies included that 60 percent of the Sunday morning talk shows feature no black guest at all, and that 78 percent of the broadcasts contain no interviews with a black guest. Therefore, when we discuss NBCU or Comcast's lack of diversity, it is not merely isolated, or defined as the absence of minorities in front of the camera. Credible involvement of minorities start at the top, and trickles down through every job or position that is necessary to produce and distribute a television program, or motion picture. Therefore, it is imperative that NBC Universal and Comcast show its commitment to diversity, and negotiate, work with those groups to come up with a substantive plan that incorporates minorities in all aspects of its media programming and distribution activities. This begins with a strategy to extend opportunities for minorities in media ownership, management, programming, and advertising. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I yield back the balance of my time. [The prepared statement of Ms. Waters follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Boucher. Thank you very much, Ms. Waters. Appreciate your statement this morning. We now will recognize our panel of witnesses, and they are here by invitation. The witnesses are here by invitation only. Mr. Feldman. Mr. Chairman, I had submitted to your office a request to speak here. Mr. Boucher. Sir, you're out of order. We are recognizing our witnesses at the hearing at this time. Mr. Feldman. I ask you, please, to reconsider. I have testimony that I---- Mr. Boucher. Sir, I'm sorry. The witnesses are here by invitation only. And we will now recognize our panel of witnesses. Mr. Jonathan Jackson is the national spokesperson for the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, and is speaking today on behalf of that coalition. Mr. Will Griffin is President and Chief Executive Officer of Hip Hop OnDemand. Mr. Samuel DeSimone is the General Counsel for EarthLink. Ms. Paula Madison is Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer of NBC Universal. And Joseph Waz is Senior Vice President for Comcast Corporation. We welcome each of you, and without objection, your prepared written statements will be made a part of the record. We would welcome your oral summaries. And in the interest of time, because we only have this room until 11:00 today, we would ask that you try to keep those oral summaries to approximately five minutes. That will leave for us ample time to take questions. Mr. Jackson, we will be happy to begin with you. STATEMENT OF JONATHAN JACKSON, RAINBOW PUSH COALITION; WILL GRIFFIN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, HIP HOP ONDEMAND; SAMUEL R. DESIMONE, GENERAL COUNSEL, EARTHLINK; PAULA MADISON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF DIVERSITY OFFICER, NBC UNIVERSAL; JOSEPH W. WAZ, JR., SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC POLICY COUNSEL, COMCAST CORPORATION STATEMENT OF JONATHAN JACKSON Mr. Jackson. Thank you, Chairman. My name is Jonathan Jackson. I'm the spokesperson for the Rainbow PUSH Coalition here in my father's behalf, Reverend Jesse Jackson. First I'd like to say good morning, Mr. Rush, Ms. Waters and other members of the panel. I welcome this opportunity to speak to you today concerning the proposed merger between Comcast and NBC Universal. In the context of economic emancipation, I ask what is Comcast's return on investment in assisting the economic empowerment of African American communities, and the underserved communities? In other words, why is it good business for Comcast to address two of the nation's most important challenges; one, creating jobs, and, two, helping to connect every American, especially people that are marginalized in our country today, to vitally needed news, information, and broadband internet services? With this proposed merger comes a rare, and perhaps the last opportunity to address critical issues in the global communications landscape. Therefore, we take the following positions as this merger is considered. An opportunity exists to create a new global media platform now. The opportunity exists to create a new minority-owned venture that can be empowered to create sustainable opportunities now. Diversity should be a top down priority in every aspect of the merger. The merger should not hinder new media, but help support it by creating new, more easily accessible technological platforms. On to the point of ownership. There are three minority owners in the Chicago market, controlling a total of three stations, or less than 5 percent of all of the commercial radio stations in Chicago; WJOB-AM 1230, is controlled out of Hammon, Indiana-based Vasquez Development, a Latino-female-owned company; WLTH-AM 1370, controlled by WLTH Radio, an African- American-owned company; and WVON-AM 1690, controlled by Chicago-based African American-owned Midway Broadcasting Company. In a city that's over 40 percent African American, there's a dearth of media ownership happening in Chicago today. What was old media--what is new media is looking more like more of the old media. I encourage you to let's create the opportunity now, that the ship has now left the station, so to speak. And what we're experiencing now is less diversity than ever before. I can recall growing up when we saw an African American leading the news on CNN, we saw them at the White House years ago, and today it's none. In the City of Chicago, we have two, five, seven, nine, CLTV, what local networks that say you're proud to service the African American community. We know the power of images on television. Until those persons that have the power assume the responsibility to project positive images, how can a community develop and sustain itself? Some people need to be held accountable today. If we look at the music industry, we look at the film industry, I see that there's too much blame fixing on the children, and on the parents. Those corporate titans that have the power to shape the images, to shape the culture are not being held responsible for the music that's being produced, and the music that is being distributed. Some people would say they're only fulfilling the current need, that if people didn't like it, they wouldn't buy it. Well, if people don't have a choice, they succumb to whatever is left before them. That is what I would encourage you to do. Let's create opportunities today. We're going through, if you will, the third evolution, now into the fourth evolution of wireless technology. This Committee has missed it all. We have food banks for over 600,000 people do not have adequate supply of food in the City of Chicago. That's a major issue. We have broadband deserts where people cannot register online cannot take classes online, cannot look up information online. In the heart of Englewood, where we've seen something very tragic happen just yesterday of another officer being killed in as few as two months. So, gentlemen and ladies of the Committee, I ask you to have that in your consideration. I yield the rest of my time. [The prepared statement of Jonathan Jackson follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Boucher. Thank you very much, Mr. Jackson. Mr. Griffin, we'll be happy to hear from you. STATEMENT OF WILL GRIFFIN Mr. Griffin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, Congresswoman Waters, nice to see you again. Congressman Rush. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the proposed combination of Comcast and NBC Universal, and who benefits from it. By way of background, I have seen the inner workings of most of the major media companies. While in law school, my faculty advisor was current Deputy Commerce Secretary, Dennis Hightower, who was the first African American President of Walt Disney Television. As the Director of the Harvard Consultation Project, I was advised by former Motown Chairman, Clarence Avant, who opened the door of access into the CEOs of the major record labels which started my career in the media industry. Subsequently, at McKinsey & Company's entertainment and media group, I worked on project at Time Warner during its post-merger integration with Turner, and I remember a discussion with AOL and Time Warner the same discussion, which was lack of broadband access, lack of diversity, and it was going to be the end of life as we knew it for all media companies, and it didn't work out for AOL for all practical purposes. I think all those intentions didn't come to pass. But, subsequently, I joined News Corporate in the Strategy and Marketing Group, and for the past 10 years I've been an entrepreneur in African American media producing film with Reuben Cannon and Bishop TD Jakes, and ultimately running a film and television production company in partnership with Russell Simmons and Stan Lathan, where we created and launch Hip Hop OnDemand on Comcast five years ago. These experiences have led me to support this joint venture with Comcast as the controlling partner for two overwhelming reasons. First, Comcast has the best Infrastructure of Inclusion to build upon in the media industry. And, two, African American consumers and policy makers have more potential leverage over Comcast than any other media company. I do not come to this conclusion lightly, because there is no doubt that the history of African Americans and media consolidation creates a visceral negative reaction to any merger or consolidation. When I watch Congresswoman Waters' hearings or Congressman Rush president over the legislation for Wall Street reform to insure the Side Streets and main street are protected from the excesses of Wall Street, I applaud. Likewise, I applauded the field hearing in June in Los Angeles, and I believe this hearing is vitally important, because I remember sitting in my dorm room in 1992 when Bill Cosby expressed his desire to buy the NBC network, a network that he turned around with African American programming, and was told it was not for sale. It begged the existential question, ``Why?'' Many African Americans remember when Fox launched with a focus on African American programming. They had iconic shows like Queen Latifah in ``Living Single,'' ``Martin,'' ``Roc'', ``New York Undercover.'' Then through a series of acquisitions, mergers, stock swaps and expansions into Fox News, the company has morphed into the monstrosity that we see today. From Queen Latifah to Glenn Beck. Why? More recently, when Viacom's UPN and Time Warner's the WB merged, the first casualties were the African American shows, ``Girlfriends,'' ``Eve,'' ``All of Us,'' ``Everybody Hates Chris,'' that made up the bulk of UPN's line-up. Why? Here's my answer; because advertisers have only been willing to pay for a limited amount of African American impressions, and will not pay for every African American view generated. It is why African American icons like Chicago's legendary Johnson Publishing with Ebony/Jet are in decline, and it should be the subject of future hearings. We are just a few blocks from many of the companies that control the main source of revenue in the media industry, and I think that they should be held accountable. That's necessary if we are to remove the primary barrier to growth and sustainability in minority media companies. Your intervention and oversight of the advertising industry is sorely needed. This is true of my own experience with Hip Hop OnDemand. At about the same time that we launched on Comcast, three other African American channels also entered into long-term distribution agreements with Comcast, Video OnDemand, Quincy Jones III's channel, and TV One. Two of the other companies quickly folded because they couldn't secure advertisers. Fortunately, we had General Motors, the Coca Cola Company, and Reebok as charter sponsors. Then foreign-owned Adidas acquired Reebok and zeroed out their African American marketing budget. Then GM experienced their problems, came to Congress to bail them out, and re-emerged to profitability, and they have not come back to our channel, despite the fact that we have experienced viewership growth in each and every quarter. If my company was paid for every one of the 500 million potential ad impressions generated, I could have made my own run at NBC. The root of the problem is this, advertisers' unwillingness to allocate minority marketing budgets in proportion to viewership ratings, which brings me to why I supposed this transaction. Comcast has the best Infrastructure of Inclusion to build upon in the media industry. Some of the very systems at the core of the Comcast media empire were birthed by African American media owners. The Washington D.C. cable system was founded by Bob Johnson, and funded by Herb Wilkins and Syncom. Syncom in Chicago, along with John Johnson and George Johnson, founded the forerunner of Comcast's current Chicago Cable System. When the question is posed, ``who benefits,'' I think this history is important to note. This effort is all the more significant that a city founded by African Americans was the first to put broadband access within the reach for so many African Americans. Chicago was the first of the Comcast markets to go all digital. Analog boxes were able to be traded in for digital boxes at no additional cost to the consumer. This is particularly relevant to African Americans, because broadband access was considered an additional expense. When the digital boxes came in, it became easy to buy broadband access as part of a bundle, which I believe has contributed to helping increase broadband access in Chicago. Chicago is very unique in the United States in that respect in terms of the digital divide and the ability to use cable to get broadband access into African American homes. As more cable boxes are rolled out in other markets it will help bridge the digital divide. So, I think this history of Comcast corporate structure with African Americans is important, because I liken this corporate family tree to the Thomas Jefferson/Sally Hemming descendents, it's in your DNA, you might as well embrace it. I believe they have. I listened with great interest at the Field Hearing on June 7th, and I also listened with great interest to Congressman Rush's Opening Statement in a March hearing with FCC Chairman on the National Broadband plan and its omission of potential benefits to Small and Minority-owned businesses. In 2007, when Comcast allowed all of its Chicago analog subscribers to trade in their boxes, I believe they started going in the direction of what you were asking them in terms of the National Broadband plan. True, it's only a start, and more can be done, but I think this will be a big help in that direction. In minorities, there are substantial minorities in management positions among its tens of thousands of minority employees in Comcast. Moreover, in each of the last five years, that number has continued to grow at a rate greater than that of whites in the corporate structure. The minority composition is vastly superior to any other media company, and is eons ahead of the advertising, telecommunications, and financial services industries. That context is extremely important when we evaluate Congresswoman Waters' numbers, because what she's saying is true. But I think if you begin to look in terms of the direction of where Comcast is going, it's headed in the right direction. I'd also like to highlight some examples of how having thousands of minorities in leadership positions at Comcast has been invaluable to me as an African American media owner. When we launched along with three other channels, it was because Comcast Corporate Vice President, Payne Brown, came to dozens of African Americans in the creative community to educate us on the video on demand platform, and the multi- billion dollar investment that Comcast was making to become the industry leader in VOD. When we saw the ability to get distribution and programming directly to our core viewers, we were one of the few who actually raised the capital, and secured the advertisers to pursue the opportunity. Once we were on the platform, we began to market our channel and get support from the African American General Managers, who run the cable systems here in Chicago, Washington, D.C., Houston, South Florida, and the entire Western Region of the United States, are run by African American General Managers at Comcast. It is no coincidence in the markets with the larger African American populations, and African American GMs are our top performing markets. As part of our ongoing process of making viewers aware of our channel, we have supplied information to Comcast's customer service teams, who are largely African American, and supervised by an African American female Senior Vice President, it helps when explaining our channel to subscribers. The result is that according to a study conducted by Starcom Media Group, African Americans are more than twice as likely to use VOD than any other demographic. Mr. Boucher. Mr. Griffin, you have exceeded your allotted time. Now, if you could just wrap up, we would appreciate that. Mr. Griffin. Sure. Mr. Boucher. We will come back to you for questions. Mr. Griffin. Sure. Well, I was reading the pages, but I believe the proposed Comcast-NBCU joint venture is a step in the right direction. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Griffin follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Boucher. Thank you very much, Mr. Griffin. Mr. DeSimone. STATEMENT OF SAMUEL DESIMONE Mr. DeSimone. Good morning, Chairman Boucher, Chairman Rush, Representative Waters. Thank you for inviting me to testify today on behalf of EarthLink. EarthLink is one of the national's largest, oldest independent internet service provider. And by independent, we're not affiliated with facilities-based provider of telephone, cable, or satellite services. We serve nearly 2 million customers nationwide with dial-up, broadband, and other internet services, and frequently receive awards for our customer service innovation. I appear today to urge that the approval of the proposed merger between Comcast and NBC be conditioned on Comcast's entering into contractual arrangements with independent ISPs, like EarthLink, for wholesale, non-discriminatory broadband access, services at reasonable rates and terms. Since EarthLink's founding in the dial-up in the mid-1990, our mission has always been to provide consumers a fast, unfiltered direct connection to the content of the entire World Wide Web. EarthLink is one of the only ISPs out of thousands that offered dial-up access business that has been competing in the broadband market during the last decade. As we look at the emerging broadband services and the proposed merger, we believe independent ISPs can and should play an important role in the broadband marketplace. The proposed merger would significantly change the US media and internet landscape. A dramatic increase in the scope and scale of Comcast's control over the programming and content, combined with its dominant gateway control of the broadband network raises the risk that this will result in less competition, less consumer choice, decreased information diversity, reduced broadband investment and higher cost for consumers. The merger will create even broader economic incentives for Comcast to deny wholesale broadband access to competing ISPs. These enhanced incentives will flow from Comcast's need to protect the incumbent cable and anything you have to protect the growth of online video. It is reasonable to expect the push for Comcast to address these online stresses and formulate a business strategy, such as, one, tying consumer access to online content to a cable TV subscription so that the two can either break the bundle or cut the cord. Two, engage in broadband network practices that discriminate against competing online video distributors. Three, withhold information involving rivals from Comcast and NBC affiliated programming and content. Four, enforcing conceptual description of the current cable carriage agreements that prevent video programmers from offering further linkages to other online competitors. Five, increasing the slice of broadband access especially in areas where it's the only high-speed provider to discourage its use for online video. Whether distinctly or in combination, these strategies would harm consumers by forcing them to purchase bundles of services they do not need or want, and at higher prices for Wholesale Broadband Access Service. U.S. consumers would have more choices of broadband providers to access this new generation of internet services. In these difficult economic times, this choice would give consumers the option to break the bundle and purchase only the services they need. Independent ISPs will have strong incentives to bring consumers independent video without bundling of services that dominates the market today. In such an environment, a diverse array of independent video programmers will also benefit because independent broadband ISP will have no incentive to restrict access to their programming. The resulting competition for content diversity will help keep cable prices in check. These arrangements should be modeled on our successful arrangement with Time Warner Cable. Our original agreement with Time Warner arose from conditions imposed by the FCC on the AOL-Time Warner merger in 2000, under which Time Warner grants us the right to provide our award-winning service to consumers over their cable network, and in exchange we pay a mutually agreed upon fee to Time Warner. This agreement was renewed in 2006, and continues to be mutually beneficial today. We have found that bringing consumers a valuable, competitive alternative helps drive broadband adoption and usage. EarthLink's recommended solution is simple, narrow, low- cost, easy to implement, and has already proven to be effective in the marketplace. EarthLink believes competition would help U.S. consumers fully realize the power of diversity, and the possibilities of the internet. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. DeSimone follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Boucher. Thank you very much, Mr. DeSimone. Ms. Madison, we'll be happy to hear from you. STATEMENT OF PAULA MADISON Ms. Madison. Thank you. Chairman Boucher, Representatives Rush, Buyer, and Waters, it's a pleasure to be here today in Chicago to discuss the Comcast-NBC joint venture. As the home of two iconic African American-owned media businesses, a professional and personal friend and hero of mine, the late, great Vernon Jarrett, the Dean of Black Journalism, the windy city is a fitting backdrop for today's hearing. My written statement discusses in great detail the consumer- and innovation-related benefits of the deal, so I'd like to use my opening statement to highlight another important issue, the positive impact that this transaction will have on diversity. Although I currently serve as the Chief Diversity Officer for NBCU, and report directly to our President and CEO, Jeff Zucker, my career with the company began more than two decades ago in the newsroom as an Assistant News Director at WNBC, our flagship station in New York City. As I rose through the ranks of NBCU to become the first African American female President and General Manager of KNBC in Los Angeles, I experienced first-hand the company's commitment to diversity. During those years, I also made it a personal and professional priority to recruit, cultivate, and promote talented executives of color, so when Jeff Zucker approached me in 2007 about leaving the helm of KNBC to assume the role of Chief Diversity Officer, it was an opportunity that naturally complemented my career in the company. I decided to take on the new challenge, not because I needed to, but because I believe in NBC Universal, and remain deeply committed to helping people of color, both new hires, and existing executives succeed in the media and entertainment industry. One powerful example of the diversity issue within our company is my dear friend, Celia Chavez, the dynamic President and General Manager of WSNS Telemundo here in Chicago, who's here with us today. A 22-year veteran of the television business, Celia joined Telemundo in 1995, and has served in senior leadership roles in several major markets across the country, including Los Angeles, San Antonio, Los Vegas and Denver. Since joining WSNS here in Chicago, Celia has launched several new programs, including Hablando Claro, Speaking Clearly, a public affairs show focused on helping Chicagoans improve their daily lives. This city, NBC Universal, and Telemundo are all lucky to have Celia on their team. On the issue of diversity, enormous progress has been made in the five months since Mr. Zucker and Mr. Roberts testified at length before this Committee. Through a longstanding ongoing open dialogue, we've made real progress in addressing important issues raised by organizations representing communities of color, as well as some concerns members of Congress, as you heard here today. In early June, as an outgrowth of these talks and our own internal discussions, Comcast-NBCU announced a comprehensive series of formal joint diversity commitments covering a wide range of areas, workforce recruitment and career development, supplier diversity, media ownership, programming, and community investments and partnerships. In recent weeks, these important careers have been supplemented by an agreement among Comcast-NBCU, and several prominent organizations, including the National Council for La Raza, the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility and the National Hispanic Media Coalition. I'd like to take a minute to draw your attention to some key details of the joint diversity commitments, which are attached in full to Joe Waz's testimony. Although I hope you'll have an even closer look at these documents, which I have here with me in order to better understand the depth and breadth of the commitments, let me point out some of the highlights of this document. At their core, these commitments not only build upon the success of past efforts at NBCU, but break new ground. Whether it's the establishment of four new external diversity councils to advise senior management, or the commitment to increase diversity among executive ranks with the assistance of professional search firms with proven track records of success, or the continued expansion of the geographic footprint in original programming budgets at Telemundo, or the significant increases in minority procurement and community philanthropic investments. These deals include concrete and tangible benefits for those who, like me, care deeply about diversity. As a veteran of the broadcast news business, I also want to mention the positive impact the Comcast-NBC new joint venture will have on free over-the-air broadcast television and news. By permitting to invest going forward in Telemundo and NBC News owned and operated stations, Comcast is clearly demonstrating its willingness to support this important industry, which millions of families, a disproportionate percentage of whom are low-income and minority, continue to rely on for their news, weather, sports, and entertainment programming. This deal does not resolve all of the unanswered questions, or solve every problem industry faces, but one thing is clear. It is an important and significant step in the right direction. As Vernon Jarrett famously said in his last column before retiring, the struggle goes on. And just as I have for the past 20 plus years, I remain committed to continuing an open dialogue with anyone and everyone who is willing to work collaboratively and productively with NBC Universal, and the industry as a whole, as we take positive strides forward in advancing the cause of diversity. I look forward to answering the Subcommittee's questions. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Madison follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Boucher. Thank you very much, Ms. Madison. Mr. Waz. STATEMENT OF JOSEPH WAZ Mr. Waz. Chairman Boucher, thank you, and thanks again for the opportunity to be here with you and your colleagues this morning. You presented the topic of this hearing in the form of a question: ``Comcast and NBCU Universal: Who Benefits?'' I appreciate the opportunity to answer that question. I believe that the benefits of this transaction will promulgate to the nation's economy, to all subscribers, multi- channel video services, whether for Comcast or our competitors to all who rely on over-the-air broadcasting, to independent programmers, to creators of color, and to many, many others. I'd like to use my time to summarize some of these benefits. By bringing together content and distribution in this transaction, we see significant opportunities to grow our businesses, and to preserve and grow jobs in this sluggish economy. As our Chairman and CEO, Brian Roberts, has said on a number of occasions, ``This transaction is a bet on America at a time when few such bets are being placed.'' Consumers will benefit because this transaction will accelerate the anytime, anywhere digital video future the consumers want and demand. All consumers will benefit because as Comcast becomes more innovative, our competitors in satellite, phone company, and other video providers need to innovate, too. As Ms. Madison explained, this transaction will benefit households that rely primarily on over-the-air broadcast TV, which are disproportionately minorities, senior citizens, and low or fixed income. Although broadcasting is a challenged business, we have committed to invest in NBC and Telemundo to make them stronger and to make the services continue to meet the needs of over-the-air viewers, and all viewers. Independent content providers will also benefit. We can never possibly serve the needs of all viewers solely with the content that this company will own. This transaction will help open up new opportunities on our OnDemand and online platforms, as well as our traditional cable platform, that we'll be pleased to discuss. And we hope that this will make possible many more success stories like those of Will Griffin and other independent content creators and entrepreneurs. In addition, we committed to add 10 new independently owned and operated cable networks over the next eight years, and we will dedicate most of those new opportunities to channels that are already owned and controlled. Moreover, as NBCU divests one of its Los Angeles television stations, it has committed to do its best to insure that a minority owner will acquire this station. And in the event that any future divestitures of broadcast or cable assets, we will take special steps to seek minority purchasers. Diverse communities across America will benefit. We have set a series of diversity goals in procurement, employment, governance and philanthropy to build on our current records, to help implement and monitor these initiates. As Ms. Madison mentioned, we will establish a joint diversity council to work collaboratively with our combined companies. The joint council will comprise councils representing the African American, Hispanic, and Asian Pacific Islander communities, and a fourth council to include representatives of veterans, the LGBT community, and people with disabilities, among others. Labor unions and guilds who produce creative content will benefit. We have reached out to them to convey our commitment to honor existing collective bargaining agreements, and we are grateful for the favorable comments on our joint venture for the Teamsters and the Directors Guild of America. Also benefitting in the transactions and parents and care givers, minority entrepreneurs, and new technology, and many others. And I hope to be able to say more about this during question time. Many of the public interest benefits I described flow organically from this transaction. Others are the result of discussions we've had over the last six months with responsible organizations and leaders who have thoughtfully raised their concerns, and worked with us in good faith to address them. For example, as Mr. Buyer has noted, we had discussions with NBC network affiliates and non-NBC affiliates. They wanted to ensure that our commitments were sincere and we have reached a firm that they believe that. We've also met with diversity leaders, independent producers, and many others. We have reached a number of mutually satisfactory agreements with various stakeholders, and hope to announce more in the coming weeks. I think this shows how Comcast has always approached our business and our public interest responsibilities through a willingness to have open dialogue with reasonable people about legitimate concerns. And we always sought resolutions that are good for all sides. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to close by noting the massive record of support for transaction at the FCC. As of last Friday, over 860 organizations and leaders, including 84 members of Congress, eight governors, over 115 state legislators, over 40 mayors, and countless Chambers of Commerce, civil rights, civic and community organizations have filed supportive comments. More than 100 of these filings came from Greater Chicago, and, Mr. Chairman, with your permission, I'd like to ask that they be made part of the record. Mr. Boucher. Without objection, that will be included in the record. Mr. Waz. Thank you, sir. Mr. Boucher. Does that conclude your testimony? Mr. Waz. One last comment, if I may. Mr. Chairman, I'm also pleased to share with you, with Mr. Rush's and your acquiescence a letter that our Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer, David Cohen, has sent to Congressman Rush. The letter summarizes some further refinements of our diversity commitments that were brought up in our discussions with Congressman Rush. We also continue to discuss certain concerns that Congresswoman Waters has and were brought to our attention, as well. And we've very excited about this transaction. Thank you for the opportunity to share our views, and now I do look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Waz follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Boucher. Mr. Waz, thank you very much. And thanks to each of our witnesses for sharing your views with us on the matter this morning. I have just a couple of questions. Mr. Waz, I know that Comcast, as part of its voluntary undertaking on diversity matters has committed to add at least two independently owned channels to its lineup in each of the next three years. And it's also committed that at least half of those channels will have substantial minority ownership interest. Is it your intent to put those independently owned channels on all the Comcast cable systems, or only on part of them? Mr. Waz. Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me begin by just updating the commitment as we continue to have discussions with our diversity organizations, and the agreement we have reached with the Hispanic Leadership organizations. We plan to enhance the commitment so that we're now prepared to add 10 independently owned and controlled channels over a period of eight years. We intend for four of those to be owned by the Latinos. And per the letter that we were sharing with Mr. Rush this morning, we have also committed to make a minimum of four of those channels, channels that are owned and controlled by African Americans. We intend to give them substantial carriage according to what I'll call customary terms and conditions in the industry. Each new network needs an opportunity to establish itself, and we've worked with--I'll give you an example of a network in which we had an ownership stake, and that is TV One. I think TV One stands out as, actually, exactly the sort of opportunity that Congresswoman Waters and others are pointing to, which is what can a company, a significant media company do to help promote media ownership, media distribution opportunities for African American programming? And I think as he was alluding in his testimony in Los Angeles, he stated how important and how sincere the Comcast commitment was to help them grow that effort. Even that network at conception did not appear on all Comcast systems. And even today, we continue to add it on Comcast systems. So, I would anticipate in each case with each of these networks that we talk with, we will reach terms and conditions for appropriate levels of introduction of these new networks in markets as appropriate across the country. Mr. Boucher. Well, I guess my question is, have you determined what markets are appropriate, and what assurance do we have that while the commitment you have independently come to, for example, minority ownership interest in a number of these channels, new channels added, that we are given to understand that there are actually going to be carried on a very large majority of your cable systems. Can we get that assurance? Mr. Waz. I can assure that we intend to work with each independently owned channel, just as we work with several other new independently owned channels, more than a dozen of whom I believe have put letters on the record with the FCC saying that it's independently owned and operated channels. They work very successfully with Comcast in order to do this. Mr. Boucher. OK. Let me ask you another question. As was indicated by Mr. Jackson in his testimony earlier, there is a notable lack on major networks of prime time programming with a minority presence. And we don't have anything on any of the big four networks today that remotely resembles the ``Cosby Show,'' for example. I'm wondering if the diversity commitments that you have voluntarily made, which I view as extensive, would serve to increase diversity programming on prime time network programming, in your opinion? Mr. Waz. I'm hopeful that that will be among the many salutary results of--if I may, if I can defer to Ms. Madison, who will offer her opinion. Mr. Boucher. Ms. Madison, do you care to comment on that? Ms. Madison. Yes, Mr. Chairman. We entered into an agreement back in 2000 with four external watchdog groups, and we've been reporting up to them annually, and quarterly, actually, for the past three years. In that time period, we have continued to add diversity both up front and behind the counter. There's no question that the industry has a long way to go, and this is not a situation that's limited to just NBC Universal. But having said that, and specifically regarding the ``Cosby Show,'' we have at NBC Universal increased the numbers of on-camera actors who are diverse year over year, so much so that this season coming up beginning in September, we have our most high-profile new drama called ``Under Cover,'' which has two blacks as the leads in the show. There's a cast of four people, of that cast, two are leads, one is also African American, who is also in that cast, and there's one white male. We also have the President of the United States cast as an African American in a lead role in another program called ``The Event.'' And we also have a famous actor, Jimmy Smits cast as a former Supreme Court justice in another one of our major dramas that's called ``Outlaw.'' So, we are moving---- Mr. Boucher. So your answer is, the trend is positive. Ms. Madison. Yes, it is. Mr. Boucher. And we would see this confirmation on the voluntary commitments that it entails as, perhaps, accelerating that trend? Ms. Madison. Yes. I think that's reasonable. Mr. Boucher. Mr. Griffin, let me ask a question of you. As I'm sure you're aware, NBC, you, and Comcast have made a number of voluntary commitments respecting diversity in the areas of corporate governance, employment, procuring programming, et cetera. You support the confirmation. Is it your view that these voluntary commitments might encourage other media companies to step up and follow suit? Could we expect this to become an example that other media companies might be expected to follow? Mr. Griffin. Yes. I think that's the secondary benefit, but I think the primary benefit would be among advertisers and private equity and venture capitalists, because they will step up and say there is a distribution commitment to this type of programming. And then they will come into the market and say if it's over a decade, and we know we can invest our client's money into these companies and then they will get support, that's a direct benefit to the industry and the programming. Mr. Boucher. All right. So that level of investment would increase the volume of independent programming that might encourage, entice some of the other media companies, but select the programming they think is the most attractive and appealing. You have more volume and more companies might be willing to accept your content. Would that be a fair conclusion? Mr. Griffin. Supply and demand. Mr. Boucher. Mr. Jackson, would you care to comment on these letters? Mr. Jackson. Well, yes. I'd like to share with you that I tried to purchase Eye on Media this past December when they were in bankruptcy. I went in with a hedge fund to purchase the debtor in possession paper. The current management had offered $150 million. Our package was $250 million, at which time we went through appeal, and went through the courts in the New York area, and there were aggressive bankruptcy practices issues that they had. And we were unsuccessful. But here's another case where minorities, and I was leading the group, showed up with more money than the current organization that failed in its operation of 64 radio and television stations, but we could not have equal access. So, I'm just a little bit concerned about the conversation that's happening now, because I'm not really concerned talking about diversity, I'm talking about equal opportunity in that access to stations that affect the public interest. What I'm talking about is equal opportunity, not diversity. I think it would be too much of a burden to place upon the owners of Comcast and NBC to have, to be able to select philanthropy. I think there's enough entrepreneurs in the community that like to shape our own destiny without having someone else that needs to work up the bottom line for their company to be concerned about how they will diversify. If we had access to ownership, we can diversity ourself. We can hire, and we can reverse diversity where blacks can hire Caucasians, or not necessarily Caucasians have to put blacks in front of the screen. I think that's very important. And I will tell you that in Chicago, a community that's over 50 percent female, there's less than 6 percent ownership in television and radio by females. So, in order to move America forward, I think women and children have to have a place on the agenda. So, it's not about getting a black on the screen, or whatever. It's also effecting what the demographics are. I've seen more fictitious programming on a child that was not in a balloon, dealing with CNN and everybody running their programming that over 50 million Americans facing hunger, more than a million American students going to school that are technically described as homeless by the Department of Education, so where's the real news, where's the real content coming from, not just the window dressing. So, I would like the conversation to be about opportunity, not philanthropy, not about just diversity, but about the divestiture, so we can have equal opportunity, and equal access to create more. Mr. Boucher. OK. Thank you very much. My time has expired. The gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Buyer, is recognized. Mr. Buyer. Mr. Jackson, you kind of pulled me in. Do you want me to believe that minority ownership directly relates to minority programming? Is that what you want me to believe? Mr. Jackson. That minority? Say it again, I'm sorry. Mr. Buyer. Minority ownership directly relates to minority programming. Mr. Jackson. Could you further explain? Mr. Buyer. No, is that the statement that you want me to believe based on your statement? Mr. Jackson. Yes. Correct. Mr. Buyer. And in order to achieve that, are you saying that we're to ignore economics principles? Mr. Jackson. No. Mr. Buyer. OK. And if we say no, then how is it achieved? It's almost like with Mr. Griffin, your testimony. I was following you all the way up to where you made your comment, ``If my company was paid for every one of the 500 million potential ad impressions, I could make my own run at NBC.'' Well, that's if everyone would buy every widget every manufacturer made in my congressional district, they'd make a lot of money. I mean, I don't know how--I know I followed you all the way up until you made that statement, I want you to know. I also want to put this on the record, Mr. Griffin. I want to congratulate you. I think you've had an extraordinary career. And I read your statement last night. I've also followed you, so I want publicly to say, and I wanted to take the opportunity to say it personally, that I respect you, and congratulate you on your career. Mr. Griffin. Thank you. Mr. Buyer. Your statement with regard to some of the programming with regard to--that fell out, ``Girlfriends,'' ``Eve,'' ``All About Us,'' ``Everybody Hates Chris,'' there is something else in the marketplace, is there not, Mr. Griffin, that the total audience reach must be great enough to cover the cost of production. Isn't that a basic in your business? Mr. Griffin. Yes. Mr. Buyer. Yes. And if it doesn't work, they're going to cancel the show. That happens a lot, doesn't it? Mr. Griffin. Well, yes, but there are three parts of this. One part is the cost of the programming. The other part is the availability of distribution, and then the third is revenue generate, or here's the profit. Here's the problem. When you have a success, like when you have a ``Seinfeld,'' you make a--if there are 10 million viewers, advertisers will pay you for all 10 million viewers. If you have ``A Different World,'' which was as big as ``Seinfeld,'' but it was on and 10 million viewers, advertisers were only paying you for 8 million, because the African American budget stops at a certain amount, so the minority budgets at advertisers are smaller, which means their money runs out, so you don't get paid the same. So, you're actually being paid less money per viewer than you would for a white household because the budgets are smaller. And what that means is there's a defect in the market. Now, when there are market defects, it creates opportunities for some people to take advantage of. What we're trying to say, what we've been saying to Comcast, at least on the OnDemand platform, what should be independent areas, and what independent is, there is an opportunity now to capture more of that market because of the defect, but in order to solve the defect, we have to go to advertisers and get them to commit to pay us for every view or impression generated. I mean, what you're saying is a textbook argument, which is hey, not enough money, cancel the show. Yes, but the issue, you know, I think Congresswoman Waters said it, why isn't there enough money. Because Coca-Cola, General Motors, Johnson & Johnson will not pay for every African American impression. That's the bottom line. There's a defect in the market. It's not working efficiently, so that creates an opportunity for Comcast and Universal to go capture it. Mr. Buyer. Mr. Waz, in the non-affiliates agreements--first of all, let me also take the opportunity, once again also compliment what you did in the marketplace. Mr. Waz. Thank you, sir. Mr. Buyer. I got a lot of these different companies together, what I thought was going to happen, even those outside the non-affiliates would attach their concerns into the non-affiliates consortium, but you can't get everybody in the same room. And not everybody, necessarily, agrees, so you end up with sort of a, even though we have a non-affiliates agreement that made it to the table, those three only brought issues which were of consensus. So, even though there's a piece of paper in front of us, I believe that there's still work yet to be done. That's just my own personal sensing from this. And you have to believe that, too. Mr. Waz. As with all the agreements that we have reached, or hope to reach, I'm sure there will be continued discussions about this. Mr. Buyer. Is broadcasting still relevant in the new media environment? Mr. Waz. Broadcasting is still the way to attract mass audiences. It's the place where special events in America, where America still gathers collectively to watch major events: sports, inaugurations and other events. So, we believe broadcasting absolutely has a place, and we're investing to try to make broadcasting in the form of NBC and Telemundo stronger and sustainable in the future. And working with the affiliates today. Mr. Buyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Boucher. Thank you very much, Mr. Buyer. The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Rush, is recognized. Mr. Rush. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me, first of all, begin by asking Mr. Jackson a question. In your exchange with my colleague from Indiana, Mr. Buyer, what is your counsel for the need to have more minorities to own networks, media, and you said that if the minorities owned the media, then the possibility, or the proclivity, or reason for this conversation that more minority ownership would mean higher ads and there would be more minority programming. Is that correct? Mr. Jackson. Yes, sir. Mr. Rush. Now, that's very important, and I agree with you. But would you limit your ownership, or limit those same results to--let me put it like this. If an African American owned a station that was aimed at say a mostly white market, would that African American be successful owning that station, or is it just limited to an African American market to have to provide media opportunities and media services to the African American community? Mr. Jackson. That's a great question. It would speak to the local demographics, that the NBA can be majority owned by Caucasians, and predominantly having the players to be African American. They can have an international market appeal. Well, that speaks to the demographics as it relates to basketball. The same thing would happen, if you're in a rural area being mostly Caucasian, naturally, you would adjust the programming. And the same thing would happen here in the City of Chicago, where the local content and news, we have very pressing issues, could reflect the community interest. Mr. Rush. Just because it's African American owned network does not mean that that network should be, or has to be geared toward an African American demographic. Is that right? Mr. Jackson. Correct. And I would cite the example of Motown, and the music that it created. There are general markets that we--I don't know if Mr. Buyer was asking me a question, or made a statement, but I would say that as far as local, about African American ownership and content, that I would look at--I don't know if it was denied, or if it was an oversight, for the first time my son saw the word ``hate'', and asked me could I share with him how it was a bad word. He was looking at an outdoor billboard, and the billboard read ``Everybody Hates Chris.'' And he's a young African American male child, and he sees ``Everybody Hates Chris,'' but ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' So, if we had access to opportunity for ownership, we could help shape that imagery ourselves. And I would refer you to the FCC document that Mr. Griffin was---- Mr. Rush. No, you're on my time. Mr. Jackson. Sorry, sir. Mr. Rush. I'm being charged with it, so let me move on. Mr. Buyer. Mr. Rush? Mr. Rush. Yes. Mr. Buyer. Will you yield to me an extra minute? Mr. Rush. Yes. Mr. Buyer. I just want to touch this, because you referred to something that I would make comment on. The reason I had made that perhaps as a statement, I wanted to get a sense of what you're urging not just us, but people to believe based off your testimony. OK? Well, I can agree with you that you say a minority owner can increase minority programming, I do not believe that a minority owner would say that that only means minority programming. I don't believe that, because it's economics. You're a businessman. That's why I compliment Mr. Griffin. You're going to follow the dollar. You're going to also follow the eyes. You're going to also follow the advertising. You're also an artist, and you can build things, and want to be creative. You want to deliver into the marketplace. And that's what's important, especially capturing the new wave on the delivery of video services. And that's what Mr. Rush---- Mr. Rush. I'm reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman. I know my timing and I do have some very important questions I want to ask. First of all, I want to--after listening to, and discussing and sometimes heated exchanges with a number of interested stakeholders, Mr. Chairman, I want to ask for unanimous consent for this Committee to accept additional information in the form of a letter, as mentioned by Mr. Waz earlier as to the agreement that Comcast submitted to the FCC that outlines their specific plan for including the minorities in a more robust and regular basis. Mr. Boucher. No objection. Mr. Rush. All right. And a little more with the letter just entered into the record. Can you expound more on, if you will, on the Venture Capital Fund that you have included in terms of this letter? Can you expound more on that? What--can you give us more of the details, and what problems are you attempting to solve going forward? Mr. Waz. Mr. Rush, thanks for the opportunity to talk more about it. I've been a friend of David Honig, the Minority Media Telecommunications Council for probably three decades now, and he has fought and tried for many years to try to create more opportunities for minority ownership, pursuing policies such as tax certificates, which have been supported on a bipartisan basis at various points and other efforts to support minority ownership in traditional media. Over the last few years, he and I have been talking a lot about what are the opportunities in new media and in technology for minorities, and this is an excellent time to be moving forward to ways that in an internet-based world where frankly there are fewer barriers, fewer distribution barriers, that there could be more innovation, more opportunities for minority entrepreneurs. I know that Commissioner Clyburn of the FCC has mentioned on a couple of occasions that she knows someone, an African American who started a very successful Web site for, I believe the number is $256, that may be on the high side, those numbers she cited, but it was--you can do a lot with a little in this market. What we think would be beneficial is to create more opportunities specifically to seek attractive young talent, people who would be interested in moving into the new technology fields from the minority community, and coming up with appropriate funding base to get them started. So, the notion we've laid out in the letter to you this morning says that we are prepared to make $20 million of investment capital available through a new program within Comcast that will look exactly to those sort of opportunities, and work with a diverse leader of that fund effort to identify funding opportunities. Mr. Rush. Will you address and expound upon, or you have in your letter divestiture of 40 assets and minority ownership. What do you mean by that, and what is that aimed at? Mr. Waz. In connection with this transaction, the only anticipated divestiture of asset is the Station KWAY in Los Angeles. That station is currently owned by NBCU-Comcast until its closing and what happened at KWAY. But NBCU has made a special effort, in fact, has hired an NTC, which has a brokerage business, has been very successful at finding minority buyers, minority purchasers for radio, and cable and TV stations over the years to create that ownership opportunity there. In the event of any other cable divestiture, or broadcast divestiture in the future, which would be required out of this transaction, we will be similarly creative, and similarly destructive in looking for minority ownership opportunities. Mr. Rush. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Boucher. Thank you very much, Mr. Rush. Ms. Waters. Ms. Waters. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would like to preface my remarks by saying that my colleague was correct about this merger being under the radar screen, being very quiet, not being talked about until I requested and received from the FCC an extension of the comment period. I got 45 extra days for the comment period because it had been very quiet. And I also requested of the FCC to hold hearings, and one will be coming up. And I got the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, to hold a hearing, and I'm very appreciative for this hearing. Why is all of this important? It is important because neither NBC, nor Comcast, made any of these moves that they're describing until all of this began to unfold. Since we have been highlighting this merger, and talking about the lack of diversity, then we're finally getting some people coming forward to talk about doing some things. As a matter of fact, the Latino that was placed on the board of, what is it, NBC or Comcast? Comcast plans to add a Latino Board member amid proposed NBC deal. This happened in the past few weeks. The proposal that you just alluded to that you're giving to Mr. Rush today, I'm glad we're having this hearing, so that you can give it to him, because we've not heard about that until the last few days. The Memorandum of Understanding that you have with the Latino group came about in this period of time that we created to have more comment, and to have hearings. So, we have to keep up the pressure, because despite the fact that both NBC and Comcast talk about their commitment to diversity, it has not been evident. You don't have diverse companies. I don't know how many years you've been working at this, but you've not been successful. So, we've got to help you. We've got to help you to be successful. It is absolutely unacceptable. We're talking about some programming, and I think the Chairman asked a significant question, because the devil is in the details, about whether or not you create channels and opportunities. We're talking about distribution and carriage, and there's no commitment to that. He questioned you very closely, and you did not give him a specific commitment to distribution and carriage. Let me just go to another aspect of this that bothers me. Let's take a look at NBC News. Early today, Glen Berry, Bill Cowan, Fred--all white. Today we have some diversity, Matt Lauer, Meredith Vieira, Ann Curry who I guess is going to be gone, along with Al Roker, MSNBC, First Look, all white, Glen Berry, Thomas Roberts, Way Too Early with Willie Geist, all white. My friend, Morning Joe, Joe Scarborough, Mepa, Rasinski, Willie Geist, all white. All of this is MSNBC. The Daily Rundown, Chuck Todd, white. Savannah Guthrie, white. MSNBC Live, Chris Jansing, Tamron Hall, one black, Andrea Mitchell Reports, white. Hardball, Chris Matthews, the Ed Show, my friend Ed Schultz, all white. Countdown with Keith Olbermann, like him a lot, all white. The Rachel Maddow Show. Well, what is that? When you sit here and you talk about this vast audience that you have, that's depending on the news, you've got to ask yourself why, why don't we have more diversity in the news that's reporting from African American, Latino, Asian perspectives on what's going on. This can't continue. And if this merger takes place, if this consolidation takes place, and we don't have a way of enforcement by which we can force you to live up to commitments for diversity, we end up in a democracy with consolidation that does not serve the best interest or the images of all of the people who deserve, as citizens of this country and this democracy, to be served. I could go on, and on, and on about all of NBC shows. When the Chairman first came to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Zucker told me that they didn't have any African American shows in the new season because he couldn't find any producers and directors. And I said I know a lot of them, let me help you. I don't understand how this business works. And we have staff full-time working to discover exactly how you do work, and what you have, and what you don't have. And I want you to know you have failed miserably. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Boucher. Thank you, Ms. Waters. I want to say thank you to the witnesses for joining us here today. Ms. Madison, to you, in particular, congratulations on your long career, and commitment to diversity issues. To all of the witnesses, thanks for the constructive comments that you've made. You have made this hearing a success, and I very much appreciate the commentary you have shared with us today. Mr. Rush, did you want to say a word? Mr. Rush. Yes, Mr. Chairman, before we adjourn. I just would like to state for the record that as we proceed down this path, I'm not sure what is being filed. I'm not sure whether the FCC, what their final ruling will be. I'm not sure what the Justice Department's final ruling will be. My colleague from California, Ms. Waters, made some very profound statements. And one of the things that I know is that this is, or can be, or should be if the stakeholders, the affected parties, Comcast and NBCU, we can begin to rewrite the sordid history, particularly over the last eight years, continuing the trend in media ownership. I sat on this Committee for 15 or more years now, and the last eight years have been the most horrendous eight years that I've seen in terms of the FCC. Although the Chairman, who is the outgoing Chairman, always had a receptive ear, making empty promises and pledges that he was going to look for new ownership, he never engaged not one millisecond in pursuit of media opportunities for ownership for black people in media ownership. That day is over, and that time has past. He is gone. This is a new day, new time, new opportunity. And we have a new administration, new members of the FCC. We will work vigorously in terms from an oversight perspective, and also from an activist perspective to ensure that, whatever you are promising, it's those promises that you make. Whenever you return back before the appropriate authority and that you're going to be dragged through the mud and the world will know that you have broken your promises. So I want to know that these were just not being done in the back room. I hope that this is the beginning of the something meaningful and important, and we can try to level the playing field as it relates to minorities and media ownership. Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Boucher. Thank you very much, Mr. Rush. I'm going to ask unanimous consent to insert into the record a letter signed by Tracy Jenkins Winchester, the President of the Multi- Cultural Network. Without objection, this will be made part of the record. Our witnesses have done a great job today. Our thanks to you, our thanks to members of the panel for their decisive questions, and this hearing stands adjourned. [Whereupon, at 11:52 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.] [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]"
