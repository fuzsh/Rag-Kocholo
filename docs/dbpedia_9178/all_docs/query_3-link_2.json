        "text": "Background\n\nSavannah Guthrie, N.B.C.’s broadcast journalist and former attorney, was born on December 27, 1971, in Melbourne, Australia. When Guthrie was two years old, she moved with her family to Tucson, Arizona, where she grew up. Guthrie has always had an interest in journalism, and she immediately enrolled at the University of Arizona after graduating from Amphitheater High School in Tucson. She was a top university student, a 1993 cum laude graduate.\n\nThe young graduate started her career journey in Columbia, Missouri, as a broadcaster at A.B.C.’s television station, KMIZ, where she worked for two years. In 1995, she began working for N.B.C.’s KVOA and stayed there for five years before she moved to Washington, D.C., to work for WRC-TV. While there, she gained quality broadcasting experience as she reported on major stories such as the 9/11 attack on The Pentagon and the 2001 Anthrax attacks. During this time, the rising broadcaster decided to pursue a law degree and enrolled at Georgetown University Law Center, where she earned her Juris Doctor degree and graduated with a magna cum laude. Following her law degree, she became a bar member of the District of Columbia and Arizona after she scored first place on the Arizona Bar Exam. She was also a member of the Order of the Coif, where she received the International Academy of Trial Lawyers Student Advocacy award for her work with domestic violence victims. Guthrie also served as a litigation associate and specialized in white-collar criminal defense at a law firm. Combining her love for journalism and law, she became a trial correspondent for CourtTV in 2007, where she broadcast several trials across the country, some of them being the Michael Jackson trial and the Martha Stewart case. Later that year, she worked for N.B.C. News as a White House correspondent. Within the same year, she became an N.B.C. news anchor and substitute anchor for the channel’s Nightly News. She was also appointed as N.B.C.’s news chief legal analyst while serving as a co-anchor on the Today Show, replacing Ann Curry. In 2011, she became the show’s chief legal editor.\n\nIn addition to being a successful news anchor, Guthrie is also a mother of two and the wife of Michael Feldman, a public relations and communications consultant, whom she married in 2014. The couple welcomed their first child in 2014 and their second in 2016. Guthrie was married before her marriage to Feldman, to B.B.C. news presenter Mark Orchard, from 2005 to 2009."
