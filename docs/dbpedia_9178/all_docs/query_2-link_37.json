        "text": "New episodes of Hoda’s podcast are available every Wednesday — just search “Making Space” wherever you get your podcasts, or click here.\n\nHoda Kotb says Savannah Guthrie's new book gave her reassurance during an uncertain parenting moment.\n\nOn a Feb. 21 episode of the podcast \"Making Space with Hoda Kotb,\" the TODAY co-hosts unpacked Savannah's new book \"Mostly What God Does: Reflections on Seeking and Finding His Love Everywhere\". The book of essays, published Feb. 20, narrates Savannah's faith and how it's impacted her path as a journalist and mom.\n\n“You know, what’s funny, I read the book when you first sent me chapter by chapter and I reread it last night when I was going through a difficult time with my daughter,\" Hoda told Savannah during the podcast. \"And I was worried ... am I, um, enough? Am I doing it right?\"\n\nHoda is mom to daughters Haley, 7, and Hope, 4, whom she co-parents with her ex-partner Joel Schiffman. Savannah and her husband Mike Feldman have two children, daughter Vale, 9, and son Charley, 7.\n\nEarlier in their conversation, the TODAY co-hosts explored their relationships to God.\n\n\"Mostly what God does is love you,\" said Savannah. \"90 percent of it is him loving you. Am I doing the right thing? Did I marry the right person? Should I do this job or that job? Am I selfish? Am I insecure? Am I a basket case? Do I deserve love? Do I really love anyone? Am I hopeless? Am I a sinner? Am I deserving of shame?\"\n\nShe added, \"Mostly what God does is love you. Oh, what’s your question? There’s only one answer: God loves you.\"\n\nHoda has shared previously how her faith was restored with the adoption of her first child.\n\n“We were just brought up to believe in God,\" Hoda said during a 2018 episode of the \"Thrive Global Podcast,\" according to “People.”\n\n\"We were all about that, and I feel like when you have a relationship with God, and I feel like I’ve had endless, countless, abundant conversations about it,\" she said. \"Sometimes you think, can he hear me? Does he hear me? Am I just talking to myself? Is it for real?”\n\nHoda added, “But, I think when Haley arrived, I didn’t have any doubt in that belief, but when Haley arrived, it was personified. Literally when I watch her now, I just feel like she’s proof of everything. Like, everything. Yeah. She’s the best.\""
