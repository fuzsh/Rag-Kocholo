        "text": "(1971-)\n\nWho Is Savannah Guthrie?\n\nSavannah Guthrie got her start in television at NBC affiliates in Missouri, Arizona and Washington, D.C. Guthrie earned a law degree at Georgetown University and became a legal correspondent, first for Court TV, then NBC. In 2011, she began working at the Today show, and was named a co-host of the show in July 2012, replacing Ann Curry.\n\nEarly Life\n\nTelevision anchor Savannah Clark Guthrie, named after her great-great-grandmother, was born on December 27, 1971, in Melbourne, Australia, where her father was stationed for his job. When she was 2 years old, Guthrie and her family moved to Tucson, Arizona. She was one of three children, and learned to play tennis and the piano as a child. When she was 16, her father passed away, and her mother, a stay-at-home mom, returned to work. Guthrie later said that her mom was her biggest inspiration.\n\nEarly Career\n\nAfter high school, Guthrie attended the University of Arizona. She was initially unsure of what to study, and her mother suggested taking classes in journalism. While in school, Guthrie landed a job at a local public television station. When she received her Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism in 1993, she took a job at a local TV station in Columbia, Missouri, where she worked for two years before she was offered a position with an NBC affiliate in her hometown of Tucson.\n\nFive years later, Guthrie headed east to another NBC affiliate, WRC-TV, in Washington, D.C., where she covered the September 11, 2001, attacks on the Pentagon and anthrax mailings. While working as a freelance reporter, she was also earning a law degree from the Georgetown University Law Center. She graduated, magna cum laude, in 2002, and received the highest score on the Arizona bar exam.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2003, Guthrie practiced law with Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld, and specialized in white-collar criminal defense. She returned to TV journalism in 2004, as a legal affairs correspondent for Court TV.\n\nNBC's 'Today' Show\n\nIn 2007, Guthrie returned to NBC as a legal correspondent, before becoming the network's White House correspondent from 2008 to 2011. She covered the 2008 presidential election, and most notably traveled with the Sarah Palin campaign. Guthrie was part of the team that ultimately won an Emmy for their coverage on election night. In 2010 and 2011, she also co-anchored The Daily Rundown on MSNBC.\n\nIn June 2011, Guthrie joined the Today show as co-host of the third hour, as well as chief legal correspondent. In addition to interviewing subjects such as Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Meryl Streep, she courted controversy after an interview where she compared breastfeeding to going to the bathroom.\n\nOne year later, in July 2012, Guthrie became co-anchor of Today, replacing Ann Curry. On her first day, her co-anchor, Matt Lauer, gave her an enthusiastic welcome, and told the audience that she had a great attitude and \"weird\" sense of humor.\n\nIn November 29, 2017, with fellow Today personality Hoda Kotb by her side, Guthrie broke the news to viewers that Lauer had been fired over allegations of sexual misconduct. Audiences seemed to respond well to the subsequent pairing of Guthrie and Kotb, propelling Today's ratings past those of ABC's Good Morning America over a two-week period for the first time in a year.\n\nThe following March, Guthrie made headlines when a microphone caught her swearing before returning from a commercial break. The host seemed to take it in stride, tweeting, \"Check, check - is this thing on?\" and adding, \"guess it's good thing I don't wear a mic all day. #ohdarn\"\n\nPersonal Life and Children\n\nGuthrie met BBC journalist Mark Orchard while covering the Michael Jackson child molestation trial in 2005. She married Orchard in December of that year, and divorced in January 2009. In May 2013, Guthrie announced her engagement to media consultant Mike Feldman. Feldman proposed to Guthrie while the pair were on vacation in the Caribbean. The couple had dated for four years prior to getting engaged and got married in Tucson on March 15, 2014. They announced that they were expecting their first child at their wedding. Daughter Vale Guthrie Feldman was born on August 13, 2014.\n\nOn June 7, 2016, Guthrie announced that she was pregnant again, and that she would not attend the Summer Olympics in Rio over concerns about the Zika virus, which has been linked to severe birth defects. The family welcomed son Charles Max on December 8 of that year.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Savannah Guthrie\n\nBirth Year: 1971\n\nBirth date: December 27, 1971\n\nBirth City: Melbourne\n\nBirth Country: Australia\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Journalist and lawyer Savannah Guthrie replaced Ann Curry as co-anchor of the popular morning show 'Today' in 2012.\n\nAstrological Sign: Capricorn\n\nNacionalities\n\nAustralian\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"
