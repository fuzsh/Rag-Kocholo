        "text": "Her new book called, Mostly What God Does: Reflections On Seeking His Love Everywhere, was recently published. Kelly first asks her what she does to chill, especially since her job on The Today Show is talking about the news.\n\n“What I try to do is keep it in perspective. I mean I think that’s why, I mean faith has always been important to me but I really lean on it,” Savannah says. “I feel like faith gives me a perspective…”\n\nKelly then asks Savannah about a time in her life when faith really pulled her out when she was really down. Savannah talks about when her father passed away when she was 16. People would ask her if she still believed in God after that and she says that she remembered thinking, “This is when I need him the most,” which is so true.\n\nWhen we are going through a difficult time, that is when he need to reach out to God to help us through. We need to depend on him and know he is in control of the whole situation.\n\nShe goes on to talk about how her book is a journey of faith. She says that, “Mostly what God does is love you,” which is a really amazing sentiment. Focusing on God’s love is so important and a reminder of who God truly is.\n\nYou can tell from the video that Savannah is strong in her faith, has learned many lessons about life and God over the years, and is happy to share them with others through her latest book.\n\n“Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.” - 1 John 4:7\n\nThis content originally appeared on GodTube.com; used with permission."
