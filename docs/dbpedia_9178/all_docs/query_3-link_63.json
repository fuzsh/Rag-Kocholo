        "text": "Women in the World returned to Texas on Monday, November 5, at the Dallas Museum of Art.\n\nLiterary legend Isabel Allende, the American-Chilean novelist who has sold more than 65 million books, been awarded the 2014 Presidential Medal of Freedom and will receive an honorary National Book Award this month, joined us onstage. She had a candid conversation with Women in the World founder Tina Brown that touched on the art of storytelling, the loss of her daughter and mother, her years of living in political exile, the “joy” of her divorce after 27 years of marriage, and her attempts at online dating at age 73.\n\nOther notable figures who took the stage were two women who have been in the boiler room of American politics for decades: Minyon Moore, former CEO of the Democratic National Committee and director of White House Political Affairs, and Leah Daughtry, CEO of the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions as well as a preacher and political strategist. The first and often the only African-American women to wield such behind-the-scenes political power, they’ve written a new book calledFor Colored Girls who have Considered Politics. The panel also included Jara Butler, the political outreach director for the Senate campaign of Beto O’Rourke.The question of the night: Does the Democratic Party take women of color for granted.\n\nFor full story and video, click here.\n\nThe signature fundraising event of Gabrielle’s Angel Foundation, the AngelBall, stands out as one of the highlights of the New York social season and last night’s beautiful affair confirmed just that. This star-studded event boasted an audience of over 1,000 high-net-worth supporters, celebrities, influencers, executives and philanthropists at Cipriani Wall Street as they came together to support the quest for a cure for cancer.\n\nThe evening honored Dottie Herman, Douglas Elliman CEO; Monte Lipman, Founder and Chairman of Republic Records, Avery Lipman, Founder and President of Republic Records; and Harvey Spevak, Executive Chairman & Managing Partner, Equinox.\n\nQueer Eye host Karamo Brown emceed the evening, which featured an unforgettable line-up of performances – including an acoustic set by Ashlee Simpson-Ross and Evan Ross; Grammy nominated artist, Julia Michaels who performed her hits Issues and Heaven. At the end of the night, guests took the dance floor for performances by Daryl “DMC” McDaniels and the legendary Morris Day and The Time performed. They then danced the night away to DJ KISS.\n\nFor full story and event photos, click here.\n\nThe New Yorker is capitalizing on its iconic cartoons to bring the legacy of the publication and artwork to life.\n\nCartoons have always been at the foundation of the publication, even when it first launched as a humor magazine in 1925, said Risa Aronson, vp of revenue at The New Yorker.\n\nBut in the past 20 years, the magazine has, in partnership with brands, used the now familiar voice of its cartoons to create sponsored content in the magazine, online, in the app and as an animated cartoon series, Aronson said.\n\nThe annual New Yorker festival takes that one step further. The New Yorker, in partnership with Land Rover, will offer two custom cartoons at the three-day event this weekend.\n\nFor full story, click here.\n\nNearly 60,000 people gathered in Central Park’s Great Lawn on Saturday for the seventh annual Global Citizen Festival, featuring performances from Janelle Monae, John Legend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janet Jackson and The Weeknd.\n\nThe day-long event, hosted by husband and wife Hugh Jackman and Deborra-lee Furness, encouraged attendees to become active in social issues, including reducing the amount of single-use plastic, eliminating bail bond policies that unfairly target minorities and the poor and providing every child with access to quality education.\n\nIf you couldn’t make it to New York or didn’t get a chance to stream it online, here are the top moments from the 2018 Global Citizen Festival.\n\nFor full story, click here.\n\nTina Brown knows how to make an impact. She scaled the heights of publishing as editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, launched the Daily Beast and published two best-selling books. For the past nine years, Brown has organized the Women in the World Summit, which touches down in Toronto on September 10. This year’s attendees include Katie Couric, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, and Chrystia Freedland, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. “We’ve doubled the size of the event from last year,” says Brown, over the phone from New York. “It’s an extraordinary time for women. The mission and the movement have joined forces. It’s so important that we capitalize on this momentum.”\n\nThe #metoo movement has sparked a dramatic change in the cultural conversation about women’s power. Why is this change personal to you?\n\nAll my life, in all my jobs, I was almost always the only woman in the room with management. The number of women on the Fortune 500 in the last year has actually declined. The noise of #MeToo is resulting in genuine cultural change, but it’s not as seismic as you might think.\n\nFor full article, click here."
