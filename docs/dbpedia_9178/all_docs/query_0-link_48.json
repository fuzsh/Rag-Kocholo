        "text": "What’s in a name? And what’s the meaning behind the names of the TODAY show anchors? From Al to Willie, we took a deep dive to find out more about the origins and popularity of their names.\n\nSavannah Guthrie, co-anchor of TODAY\n\nSavannah Guthrie may have a name synonymous with the famous city in Georgia, but the TODAY anchor is Australia-born. The name Savannah, according to Nameberry, means “flat, tropical grassland.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie was born in 1971 and that year, “Savannah” didn’t even crack the top 1000 ranked baby girl names: That wouldn’t happen until 1983, when it ranked 466, according to the Social Security Administration. However, it’s grown tremendously in popularity since then — peaking at number 30 in 2006 and 2007. Most recently, it ranked number 92 in 2023.\n\nHoda Kotb, co-anchor of TODAY and co-host of TODAY with Hoda & Jenna\n\nNo doubt that Hoda Kotb is the most famous woman in America to have the name. According to MomJunction.com, “Hoda is a unique Arabic and Persian name primarily given to girls, although it may also be used as a masculine name. As a feminine name, it is an alternate spelling or the Persian form of the name Huda, which means ‘right guidance ‘ in Arabic. It is a popular name in Islamic countries and several Muslim families worldwide.”\n\nHoda remains a very unique name in the States, however. It has never ranked in the top 1,000 names for babies born in the United States, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe name “Hoda” did inspire a cute nickname for the TODAY anchor while she was in college at Virginia Tech. Her college friends and sorority sisters calle her “Hodie.”\n\nAl Roker, weather anchor for TODAY, co-host of 3rd hour of TODAY\n\nAlbert Roker — known as “Al” to TODAY viewers and weather watchers everywhere — seems to have a personality that perfectly matches the meaning of his given name.\n\nAlbert, according to TheBump.com, means, “Noble, bright and famous.” Well, that sure fits Al!\n\nThe name Albert peaked in popularity in 1910 when it ranked number 14 among baby boy names. Since then, the popularity of the name has fluctuated, dipping as far as number 612 in 2022, according to the Social Security Administration. When Al was born in 1954, the name was ranked number 73.\n\nCraig Melvin, news anchor for TODAY, co-host of 3rd hour of TODAY\n\nCraig Melvin sure is popular with viewers, but it turns out his name isn’t popping in the American baby name ranks in recent years.\n\nThe name “Craig,” according to Nameberry, is of Scottish origin and means “from the rocks.” It should be noted that Craig is still a popular name in its native Scotland. Here in the United States, the name last cracked the top 1,000 baby boy names in 2017 when it ranked 984, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe name Craig peaked in popularity in 1969 and 1970 when it ranked number 39 among baby boy names. When our Craig was born in 1979, then name came in at number 77.\n\nCarson Daly, feature anchor for TODAY\n\nHis name means “son of the marsh dwellers,” according to Nameberry, but TODAY’s Carson Daly is actually the son of parents who dwelled in Southern California.\n\nCarson’s longevity in popularity throughout his career is also reflected in the popularity of his name. “Carson” enjoyed a spot in the top 100 from 2006 — 2021 and peaked at number 70 in 2018. The name has also been in the top 1,000 baby boy names since 1900, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nCarson can also be used as a baby girl name, though use of the name for a baby girl is far less common: It’s only ranked in the top 1000 girl names 13 times between the years 1992 and 2004.\n\nJenna Bush Hager, co-host of TODAY with Hoda & Jenna\n\nThe name “Jenna” has a few meanings: According to TheBump.com, “Jenna” means “white shadow, fair one, or small bird.” The website speculates the name first came into popularity in the 1970s as a result of the show “Dallas” which featured a character named Jenna Wade. The show ran from 1978 to 1991 and during this time, jumped in popularity from 431 to 80, peaking in the year 1985 at number 50.\n\nIt was in 1981 that Jenna Bush Hager was born; fittingly, in Dallas, Texas. That year, the name ranked 196 among baby girl names, according to the Social Security Administration. However, Jenna Bush Hager wasn’t named after a character on a television show: According to People, she was named after her maternal grandmother, Jenna Hawkins Welch.\n\nSheinelle Jones, co-host of 3rd hour of TODAY\n\nIf Sheinelle seems like an unusual name it’s because it is! Sheinelle Jones was named for both her parents, TODAY reported in 2018.\n\n“Side note — my mom’s name is ‘Sheila,’ my father is ‘Darnell — put it together and it equals ‘Sheinelle,’” she wrote in an Instagram post that year.\n\nWhen the NBC News correspondent came to TODAY in 2016, she shared the sweet story about how her parents fell in love and later named their daughter after them.\n\n“Once upon a time, there’s a really nice lady, her name is Sheila,” she said. “And then she met this handsome man in college, his name was Darnell. Years later they had a baby, it’s me. And they came up with my name — it’s a merging of their two names.”\n\nDylan Dreyer, co-host of 3rd hour of TODAY\n\nDylan is a popular unisex baby name — perfect for a boy or a girl. But while viewer favorite Dylan Dreyer is one of the most famous “Dylans” around, the name itself is actually more popular as a baby boy name than a baby girl.\n\nIn 2023 the name Dylan ranked number 34 on the Social Security Administration’s list of top baby names. As a baby girl name, Dylan ranked 648.\n\nThe meaning of the name Dylan is “great tide” or “great flow” according to TheBump.com. “Inspired by the Welsh sea god Dylan, lending the meaning “son of the sea,” your little one can ebb and flow as they move through life. Sailing through the tranquil times, they will quickly learn to move swiftly,” TheBump.com said.\n\nPeter Alexander, co-anchor, Saturday TODAY\n\nPeter is a classic boy name that has stood the test of time. It has been in the top 1,000 most popular baby boy names since 1900, according to the Social Security Administration. The name Peter peaked in popularity at number 35 in 1955. In 2023, the name ranked 210.\n\nThe name Peter has Greek origins and, according to Nameberry, means “rock” and “stone.” Famous people named Peter include Saint Peter, Peter the Great, and of course TODAY’s very own Peter Alexander.\n\nLaura Jarrett, co-anchor, Saturday TODAY\n\nLike Peter, Laura is another name that has ranked in the top 1,000 names since 1900, according to the Social Security Administration. But even with all that longevity, “Laura” only cracked the top 10 list of baby girl names once — it came in at number 10 in 1969.\n\nIt’s been on a steady decline since, and in 2023 came in at 365.\n\nThe name Laura, according to Nameberry, is English with Latin roots. It means “from Laurentum or bay laurel.”\n\nWillie Geist, host of Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist\n\nOf all the TODAY anchors, William “Willie” Geist holds the title of anchor with the most popular name. According to the Social Security Administration, in 2023, it ranked number 10. It has been in the top 10 names nearly 100 times since the year 1900, peaking at number two in the early part of last century.\n\nIn 1979, when Willie Geist was born, the name was ranked at number 13. William is of German origin and means “resolute protection” according to Nameberry."
