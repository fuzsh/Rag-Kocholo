        "text": "MILWAUKEE, Wis. (WMTV) - One of the busiest women working in television this summer, Savannah Guthrie, took a few moments after the TODAY Show on Thursday to sit down with WMTV’s morning anchor, Gabriella Rusk.\n\nCOVERING THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION\n\nAfter the recent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump days ahead of the RNC, Guthrie says she was unsure about the tone and what this convention would be like.\n\n“We’re in uncharted territory,” said Guthrie. “Going in, I think none of us were really sure what we would encounter.”\n\nOver the past few days, Guthrie says she’s witnessed the excitement Republican supporters have for their nominee.\n\n“The convention has been remarkable for its unity, for the emotion that’s been shown. I think there’s been a lot of joy and gratitude,” explained Guthrie.\n\nLOOKING AHEAD TO THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION\n\nNext month, the Democratic delegates will gather in Chicago, where support for the candidate is not as unified.\n\n“Of course, President Biden diagnosed with COVID and self-isolating in Delaware right now, but [he’s] also politically isolated,” said Guthrie. “Increasingly, the Democratic leadership are suggesting that perhaps it’s time for the President to step aside, something so far he has been unwilling to do. So we’ll see how that plays out.”\n\nShe said there’s an obvious difference between the two parties and their current campaigns.\n\n“There’s definitely a stark contrast right now between the unity seen at this convention and the disarray and the questions that are looming over the Democrats,” said Guthrie.\n\nPREPARING FOR PARIS\n\nWhen she isn’t talking politics, Guthrie is gearing up for the Olympic Games in Paris, something she’s looking forward to after the convention.\n\n“It’s a little palette cleanser,” said Guthrie. “Why not go to Paris for a couple of weeks?”\n\nShe says fans of the Summer Olympics can expect to see the City of Lights in a whole new light.\n\n“Paris is a beautiful city under any circumstances, but it’s really cool what they’re planning to do, incorporating some of those famous landmarks that we all know, like the Eiffel Tower, into the venues, into the sporting events,” Guthrie explained.\n\nSome of those events include the Opening Ceremony, which will be a flotilla of boats down the River Seine.\n\n“It’s going to be really well-timed. These presidential campaign years, they get tough and people can feel divided,” said Guthrie. “It’s nice to be able to watch the Olympics, watch the best of us go out there, try to achieve dreams, and root for Team USA.”\n\nYou can watch Savannah Guthrie covering the Olympics in Paris starting on July 26 on WMTV 15 News.\n\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app."
