From record-breaking Olympians, like Simone Biles, to fan-favorite gymnasts, like Nastia Liukin, each Summer Olympics brings a new set of superstars to the forefront with an impressive amount of talent to match the hype.\n\nAfter the Olympic Games, the sky is the limit when it comes to what these women can accomplish. Many are still involved in gymnastics, whether they are coaching, opening their own gyms, commentating, or using their voices to spark change in a sport with a complex and often troubling history. Some have written books, started YouTube channels, or hit the motivational speaking circuit, keeping fans updated on their journey as it stands today. Others have pursued new careers altogether, in everything from politics to singing. And more than you think have tried their hand at ballroom dancing as competitors on Dancing With The Stars (and more than one has taken home that Mirrorball Trophy).\n\nOne thing is for sure: All 25 of these women have had truly legendary careers in the sport of gymnastics, with many Olympic medals, daring skills, and achievements outside of athletics to their name. Once you see what they're all up to after leaving the gym floor, you'll be oh so impressed.\n\nSo what happened to your favorite Olympians after the spotlight dimmed and competition wrapped? Here are all of our favorite gymnasts, then and now."
