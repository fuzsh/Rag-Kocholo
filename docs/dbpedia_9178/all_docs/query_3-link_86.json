        "text": "AL Roker has begged fans to watch his new movie outside of Today after going missing from the show for a few days.\n\nAl shared a clip of his new docuseries project Returning Citizens: Life Beyond Incarceration to his personal Instagram.\n\n\"PREMIERE ANNOUNCEMENT: Watch Episode 1 of our NEW docuseries, Returning Citizens: Life Beyond Incarceration (see PBS link in bio)!\" Al captioned the clip he shared to his account.\n\nIt was also shared to the official Al Roker Entertainment Instagram account.\n\n\"Returning Citizens sheds light on those navigating reentry after incarceration, offering hope amid a system often lacking opportunities,\" the weatherman wrote.\n\n\"The series, produced by Purple Sage Productions in proud partnership with Al Roker Entertainment, will be presented and distributed by American Public Television (check local listings nationwide for future air dates).\"\n\nThe clip showcased some of the individuals in the docuseries whose lives Al was following as they were leaving prison.\n\nThose in the documentary discussed the difficulties they had returning to regular life after getting out.\n\nAl has been working on this project for a while.\n\nFans seemed interested in the documentary, as they descended on the Instagram clip to let Al know what they thought.\n\n\"Thanks Al for promoting and highlighting important issues in the community. I love your usual jolly happy posts, however, with this post it’s good see your depth as a human being,\" one wrote.\n\nNOT TODAY\n\nIn late February, both Al and Carson Daly were replaced on a Friday episode of the Today show.\n\nIt was first revealed that Al was missing during his weather segment early on, with a replacement standing in for him.\n\nAfter the episode had been on for a while, Savannah threw the show over to the weather segment.\n\n\"Al's off, so Mr. Bill Karins is with us,\" she announced, welcoming the NBC News meteorologist to do the weather for the day.\n\nShe did not elaborate on where Al, 69, was for the day at that time though, simply that he was off.\n\nLater on in the broadcast after another weather forecast before Today had ended, it was time to acknowledge where Carson, 50, had been as well.\n\nIt was time for POPStart, which Carson normally hosts.\n\n\"Carson's got some time off,\" Savannah, 52, announced before Sheinelle Jones replied.\n\n\"Well-deserved time off,\" Sheinelle, 45, said.\n\nNo one explained anything further about Carson's absence, however.\n\nIt seems the two anchors simply needed a day off and Friday was the day they both chose to take it.\n\nARE THEY AL-RIGHT?\n\nRecently, Al and co-host Craig Melvin seemed to flirt with a '90s actress on Today.\n\nThey fought for her attention during an unhinged moment.\n\nAmy Yasbeck sat down with Al, 69, Craig, 44, and Sheinelle Jones during the Third Hour of Today.\n\nShe is best known for her roles in Wings and Splash, Too.\n\nHowever, Amy, 61, appeared on the morning show on Wednesday to talk about heart health.\n\nHer husband was John Ritter, who died in 2003, from an aortic dissection.\n\nShe talked about what to look out for and how she started the John Ritter Foundation after his death at 54.\n\nDespite Amy being on Today for a serious topic, she also added a little fun to her conversation."
