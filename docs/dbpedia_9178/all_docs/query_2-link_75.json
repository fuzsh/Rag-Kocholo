        "text": "Last night there were two town halls. Both starting at 8 P.M. ET, on different networks. That decision has been talked about at nauseum in the past week, but that doesn’t make it any less ridiculous. Regardless, though the debates were on at the same time, they were starkly different in every way possible. One was in Miami, the other was in Philadelphia. One was indoors, the other was outdoors. And one centered around an aggressively defensive old man, the other centered around a calm one. Can you guess which candidate was which.\n\nThroughout Donald Trump’s meeting, the President repeatedly clashed with the woman asking him questions, NBC’s Savannah Guthrie. Whether it was a question regarding Trump retweeting a conspiracy theory involving Biden having Seal Team Six assassinated, or one about Trump’s infamous tax returns (or lack thereof), Guthrie was met with the same dismissive anger, as if Trump were offended that they would ask him questions like those. Everyone took note of the almost debate like atmosphere of this town hall meeting, but many people did not believe Trump was to blame. Instead they felt as though Guthrie was treating Trump unfairly, and attacking him instead of asking questions. They pointed to ABC’s debate with Joe Biden and George Stephanopoulos stating that Stephanopoulos was babying Biden by comparison. But it’s important to remember what these moderators, especially in a town hall setting, are there to do. Their job is to ask the candidate questions, and if they avoid answering those questions, to press them on it. To be clear, at times Biden was pressed as well. But here’s where Trump and Biden differed, when Biden was pressed, he calmly answered the question. I’m not saying his answers were always perfect, but they were answers, not rebuttals.\n\nAmong certain conservative strands of Twitter, Savannah Guthrie was slammed for how she handled the meeting. But as you may recall, this isn’t the first time conservative media personalities were upset with a moderator. Chris Wallace, who moderated the first presidential debate, was also chastised by the right for allegedly favoring Biden throughout the debate. They believed he was too rude to Trump, and asked him significantly more difficult questions than he asked Biden (even though one of Trump’s questions was “Will you condemn white supremacy”). But here’s an idea to consider. Maybe all moderator’s are not biased against Trump, and instead Trump’s behavior is simply unacceptable in a professional setting. And maybe the questions that Trump is asked aren’t more difficult because of the media’s ‘leftist agenda’, but because his past behavior isn’t easily justified.\n\nAllow me to elaborate on those last points with two examples. First let me talk about the supposed difficulty of the questions. Both Biden and Trump were asked about their past statements or actions in the first presidential debate, as well as the town hall meetings. In the interest of fairness I’ll give questions that were asked to the candidates last night, and breakdown how they responded. Let’s begin with Joe Biden. George Stephanopoulos asked Biden how he would navigate the pandemic without crushing the economy. When Biden said that he would listen to science, Stephanopoulos pressed him, pointing to the fact that some scientists may disagree, and simply stating that you will listen to science doesn’t answer the question. So yes, this is a difficult question, but it’s a necessary one, and in pressing Biden, Stephanopoulos did the right thing. We need to know how Biden would navigate a pandemic, and what exactly he means when he says he’ll ‘listen to science’. Biden understood this, and rather than chastising his moderator or growing irritated with him, Biden laid out a few concrete steps that he believes could both curb the pandemic while keeping the economy alive. Stephanopoulos did not interrupt him because Biden didn’t lie throughout his answer, so there was no need to interrupt him. This isn’t to say that Biden’s answer was perfect, but again, it was an answer.\n\nLet’s pivot to Donald Trump. Savannah Guthrie asked him about to denounce the conspiracy theory QAnon, a theory that there is an underground pedophilia ring within the Democratic party, and Donald Trump is the only one who can stop it. Now in all honesty, I don’t think this question is too difficult. Stating that a dangerous and ludicrous conspiracy theory isn’t true shouldn’t be that tough. But then again, Trump is probably aware that anyone who believes in QAnon will definitely vote for him. So sure, why not, we’ll say this is a difficult question. However it is also about a dangerous conspiracy theory that looks to Trump as a literal superhero, so it is definitely necessary. However rather than denouncing them, Trump stated that he didn’t know enough about them to do so, all he knew is that they didn’t like pedophiles and neither did he. After Guthrie reminded him that she just explained it to him, he essentially said she could be lying. So, after Trump began to grow more and more irritable, Guthrie pivoted. She asked if Trump would simply be willing to definitively state that there was no pedophilia ring within the Democratic party. Instead, Trump said “I don’t know that, neither do you”. I will admit, after that statement Guthrie did show a bit of frustration. I mean she didn’t yell at Trump or really do anything close to that, but she did seem a bit annoyed, but can you blame her. Similar conspiracy theories led a man to show up, armed with an AR-15, to a Washington D.C. pizza place in 2016 because he was convinced they were keeping children inside. They were not, and fortunately nobody was injured, but nonetheless this incident alone proves that conspiracy theories like this can lead to tragedy. So not only was Donald Trump avoiding a question, meaning he was not saying he would or would not denounce the QAnon theory, but he was also further propagating these beliefs. So yes, Guthrie did seem to be a bit irked, but there was a clear reason for this. She didn’t simply show up with a vendetta against Trump. She wasn’t interrupting him without reason, or coming after a member of his family, or stating that he wasn’t smart. She was responding to his behavior, but then again its become a theme amongst the right to blame the reaction and not the cause.\n\nSo before we berate the next moderator for his leftist agenda, blatant bias, or just a rude attitude, let’s look at what preceded it. Was the moderator attacking Donald Trump from the start, or did something maybe precede Trump being reprimanded?"
