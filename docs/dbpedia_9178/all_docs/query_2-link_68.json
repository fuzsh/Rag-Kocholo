        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nSavannah Guthrie is celebrating the success of her latest career venture, but it looks like some people want to grab onto her coattails.\n\nThe Today show host released her new book Mostly What God Does on February 20, and fans are already raving about the essay collection. As word spreads, though, unauthorized workbooks are appearing on Amazon as related products for readers to shop. This led Savannah to take to Instagram to warn her followers that she was only promoting one project.\n\n\"PSA!!! üö® These 'workbooks' are not real and not by me!\" she wrote on February 21. \"Watch out (they spelled my name wrong - that‚Äôs the first clue). I haven‚Äôt done any work book - just the book which you can buy at mostlywhatgoddoes.com OR from any retailer or Indy bookseller!\"\n\nWhen fans caught wind of the fact that some folks were trying to capitalize on Savannah's literary achievement, they rushed to the comments to share their feelings of support.\n\n\"Amazon should take it down!\" one person declared on Instagram. \"Your actual book is on Amazon still though, correct? I want to download it to my Kindle ‚ù§,\" another asked. \"Thanks Savannah for warning us! These tricks are so frustrating üò´,\" a different follower added.\n\nDespite the slight snafu, Savannah has a lot to be thankful for. She is currently on a book tour promoting Mostly What God Does, with her Today co-stars moderating conversations throughout the U.S. What's more, when speaking to Good Housekeeping about the book, she opened up about showcasing a more vulnerable side people don't normally see.\n\n\"Faith is at the core of what drives me and animates me and interests me,\" she said for the March/April 2024 print issue. \"I'm nervous about it because it is really personal. When you write something like this, you hope that what you're writing is coming across in the way you hope it would, and that people will be touched by it.\"\n\nUpdate, February 27, 2024:\n\nAfter this story went live, a spokesperson from Amazon reached out to Good Housekeeping directly with a comment in regard to Savannah's post:\n\n\"We aim to provide the best possible shopping, reading, and publishing experience for customers and authors, and invest heavily to protect them from misuse of our services by bad actors,\" Amazon spokesperson Ashley Vanicek wrote via email. \"We have content guidelines governing which books may be listed for sale, and use proactive and reactive measures to evaluate content in our store. We both prevent books from being listed as well as remove books that do not adhere to our guidelines, including content that creates a poor customer experience.\"\n\n\"Customers can use the 'Report an Issue' section on a book's detail page on Amazon to report content they believe is inappropriate for sale on Amazon, or use our Report Infringement Form to notify us of alleged intellectual property infringements,\" she added. \"We are committed to reviewing everything that is referred to us.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like"
