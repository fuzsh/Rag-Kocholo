        "text": "President Trump’s most significant, and ominous, achievement in his first year in office is the corruption of the Republic. I don’t mean that he has succeeded in destroying the checks and balances on which American freedom rests. I mean that he has so soiled the discourse that a kind of numbness has set in, an exhaustion of outrage that allows him to proceed with the unthinkable.\n\nThe greatest danger from a man so unerring in his detection of human weakness, so attuned to the thrill of cruelty, so aware of the manipulative powers of entertainment, so unrelenting in his disregard for truth, so contemptuous of ethics and culture, so attracted to blood and soil, was always that he would use the immense powers of his office to drag Americans down with him into the vortex.\n\nTrump is succeeding in this. He is having his way, for all the investigative vigor of the free press he derides, for all the honor of the judiciary that has pushed back against his attempts to stain with bigotry the law of the land. Slowly but surely, the president is getting people to shrug.\n\nThe appalling becomes excusable, the heinous becomes debatable, the outrageous becomes comical, lies become fibs, spite becomes banal, and hymns to American might become cause for giddy chants of national greatness.\n\nThis is happening before our eyes. My grandson, Raphael, was born Feb. 1, in Gallup, N.M. Hours old as I write, he’s my fifth grandchild; they’re all four or under. I worry about what country they will find.\n\nToday the idea of America, empty if stripped of ethical foundation, is under assault from a man who envies the pliant courts, the adoring media, and the license to kill of dictators across the world. Ethics? Please.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
