        "text": "Maybe you’ve heard the rumor about the tattoos.\n\nSome people believe that Dolly Parton’s arms — which haven’t been seen bare in public for decades — are secretly covered in ink. Roseanne Barr claims to have once spied the elusive tats (“No black or blue lines,” she told Craig Ferguson in 2011, “all like, pastel gorgeous bows all over everything”), while Savannah Guthrie grilled Parton about the whispers in a 2014 “Today” show appearance. “People said the other day, the reason you wear sleeves is because you have snakes tattooed all over you,” she told Ms. Guthrie, “and I was like, ‘No I don’t!’” True believers took this only as evidence that she doesn’t have snake tattoos.\n\nParton’s popularity has endured, in large part, because even after five decades of stardom she remains an enigma in plain sight. Call it the Parton Paradox: Hers has been one of the most scrutinized female bodies in the history of modern celebrity, and yet no one can tell you for certain what her forearms look like.\n\n“Very often someone will wow you, but as you get to know them, the mystery wears off,” Jane Fonda, Parton’s co-star in the feminist film “9 to 5,” told Rolling Stone in 1980. “One of the things that just flabbergasts me about Dolly is the amount of mystery she has.”\n\nAnd at the moment, the magical mysteries of Dolly Parton seem to be captivating a whole new generation. The 73-year-old is riding high on a trifecta of millennial milestones: She’s the subject of a popular serialized podcast (WNYC’s “Dolly Parton’s America,” hosted by Radiolab’s Jad Abumrad), the inspiration for a forthcoming Netflix anthology series (“Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings,” premiering Nov. 22), and the featured vocalist on an EDM song (the Swedish duo Galantis’s “Faith,” on which Parton appears alongside a Dutch rapper named Mr. Probz). And, as her nearly 5 million Twitter followers will tell you, she knows her way around a “Jolene” meme.\n\n[Get TV and movie recommendations delivered to your inbox with our Watching newsletter.]\n\nIn some sense, though, 2019 is an odd time for a Dolly renaissance. It’s easy to see why someone like Fonda — a kind of octogenarian Greta Thunberg — is enjoying an uptick in intergenerational support from a politically aware cohort too young to remember her days of antiwar activism. Parton, on the other hand, has remained reluctant to make the slightest hint of a political statement, even in these urgent times.\n\nThe first episode of “Dolly Parton’s America” centers partly on the “9 to 5” songwriter’s reluctance to call herself a feminist. Earlier this year, Parton’s own sister, Stella, said she was “ashamed” of Dolly for not speaking out more about the #MeToo movement. In response, Parton told The Guardian: “I don’t feel I have to march, hold up a sign or label myself. I think the way I have conducted my life and my business and myself speaks for itself.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
