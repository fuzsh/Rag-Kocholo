        "text": "Artists of the Turkic World who came to Kastamonu within the framework of the Opening Ceremony of Kastamonu, the Cultural Capital of the Turkic World 2018 and Nevruz Celebrations organized by the International Organization of Turkic Culture TURKSOY paid a visit to the Governorate and Municipality of Kastamonu.\n\nOn the eve of Nevruz, artists who visited Kastamonu together with the delegation of TURKSOY headed by its Secretary General Dusen Kasseinov came together with the Governor of Kastamonu Mr. Yaşar Karadeniz and the Mayor of Kastamonu Tahsin Babaş in their respective offices where they offered them the traditional “Semeni” symbolyzing spring.\n\nArtists representing 13 countries and 18 regions inhabited by Turkic peoples were welcomed with great hospitality by officials of Kastamonu.\n\nTURKSOY Secretary General Dusen Kasseinov who delivered a speech on this occasion stressed that Nevruz is the common celebration of Turkic peoples and added: \"Nevruz is the most ancient and most important common celebration of the Turkic World. This year, we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the resuming of Nevruz Celebrations in Turkic republics. Indeed. Towards the end of the Soviet Regime we began celebrating this tradition again. With the contribution of its member countries, TURKSOY has held Nevruz Celebrations in the United Nations General Assembly Hall and in UNESCO Headquarters. Today, Nevruz has transcended the borders of the Turkic World and is being celebrated worldwide. On behalf of all Turkic peoples, let me stress that it is a great honour for us to celebrate this common feast of ours here in Kastamonu, the Cultural Capital of the Turkic World 2018\".\n\nIn the meeting, the Governor of Kastamonu Mr. Yaşar Karadeniz said that the declaration of Kastamonu as Cultural Capital of the Turkic World 2018 by TURKSOY is an impetus which brought new dynamism to the city and its citizens. The Governor further extended his gratitude to TURKSOY for activities it has been carrying out under the leadership of its Secretary General Dusen Kasseinov. Mr. Karadeniz who also stressed the solid ties between Kastamonu, the ancient city of the Turkic World and Turkic republics said that these ties will be strengthened even further every day from now on and added: \"We are welcoming nearly 290 artists from 18 regions of the Turkic World for the Opening Ceremony of the Cultural Capital of the Turklic World 2018 and this will give a strong impetus to the fostering of these ties as well as to the promotion of Kastamonu”.\n\nThe Mayor of Kastamonu Tahsin Babaş who also delivered a speech in the meeting said that Kastamonu is also a city of saints which has been preserving its traditions and customs throughout history and that it continues preserving its cultural heritage in a way which is worthy of a Cultural Capital. Mr. Babaş expressed his happiness to be hosting artists of the Turkic World in Kastamonu and further extended his gratitude to TURKSOY for the organization of this opening ceremony and Nevruz event.\n\nThe meeting which took place in the presence of country representatives dressed in their national costumes also featured colourful moments. As they took the floor to wish a happy Nevruz to everyone, artists of the Turkic World accompanied them, some with their instrument, some with their words and some with their music.\n\nSongs sung by artists from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Altai (RF) raised great enthusiasm among the audience which gave them standing ovations.\n\nIn the meeting TURKSOY Secretary General Kasseinov, the Governor of Kastamonu Mr. Karadeniz and the Mayor of Kastamonu Mr. Babaş also observed the 1000-year-old “egg-tossing” tradition which is an essential component of the Nevruz Feast.\n\nThe meeting ended with the mutual exchange of souvenirs and a group photograph as a remembrance of the day.\n\nFollowing the meeting, the delegation of TURKSOY and artists of the Turkic World planted saplings in the memorial forest of Gelesin together with the Governor and Mayor of Kastamonu."
