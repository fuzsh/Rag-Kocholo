        "text": "The Turkish wood-based panel producer placed an order for an 8' x 63.7 m MDF wood-based panel plant with a ContiRoll press. This makes it the longest of the 32 ContiRolls and the longest continuous press in Turkey.\n\nWith the new production plant at the Balikesir location, Kastamonu Entegre is effectively developing its second mega wood-based panels production site in Turkey. The total raw board production capacity with downstream finishing processes is over 1 million m3.\n\nSince 2005, Kastamonu Entegre has been operating a 7' x 42.1 m ContiRoll particleboard plant with an annual output of more than 600,000 m³ at the Balikesir site in the west of the country.\n\nThe other mega site is operated by Kastamonu Entegre at the location in Gebze, where HDF, MDF and particleboard are produced as raw boards on currently three continuous press lines and various plants are operated for further processing or finishing of these products.\n\nIn Balikesir, the new plant will also feature a significant drying operation – with a capacity of 65 tons/atro per hour, to be installed by Siempelkamp's subsidiary Büttner.\n\nThe Generation 9 ContiRoll press will realize a wide production range: standard MDF, as well as especially light MDF (L-MDF) and HDF are to be produced.\n\nThe scope of delivery for Kastamonu Entegre includes the special light-board package of the ContiRoll hydraulic system. It enables the production of L-MDF and U1-LDF with gross densities of less than 500 kg/m³.\n\nWith the latest two investments in Samsun and now in Balikesir, Kastamonu Entegre is believed to rise in global wood panels rankings (in terms of size) to No 5 in the world.\n\nThe successful cooperation between Kastamonu Entegre and Siempelkamp dates back to 1969 – at that time Siempelkamp supplied a belt-tray plant for particleboard production to the Kastamonu City location.\n\n\"Our thanks go to Kastamonu Entegre for more than 50 years of continuous trust in the Siempelkamp technology as well as in our team,” said Ulrich Kaiser, head of sales Siempelkamp.\n\n“We would also like to extend our thanks to the great investment and project team at Kastamonu Entegre, with whom we have paved the way for this project in an extremely constructive manner. We are looking forward to successfully realizing the current mega site project again with our partner and its team.”"
