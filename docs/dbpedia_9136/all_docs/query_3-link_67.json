        "text": "The Kastamonu Mansions\n\nThe historical Kastamonu Mansions (Kastamonu Evleri), which were built at the end of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century, are important examples of civil architecture that reflects Turkish society life to this day. The mansions can be visited through the narrow streets and also sometimes by stairs due to the uneven structure of the city. Due to safety reasons and the geographical structure of the city, the mansions were built close to each other.\n\nThe most important feature of the mansions, especially those situated in the city centre where the front facade of each building has its own architectural design and aesthetics. The basic idea in civil architecture is to prevent a blockage from the neighbour's sun, shadow or view, as well as to make the most of the area. The former structure was implemented in the best manner possible in the Kastamonu Mansions.\n\nIn terms of mansion density, the districts İnebolu and Taşköprü are ranked after the city centre.\n\nYou can visit the restored mansions, stay overnight in one of the mansions serving as a hotel, and enjoy the local Kastamonu delicacies in the warm atmosphere of the mansions."
