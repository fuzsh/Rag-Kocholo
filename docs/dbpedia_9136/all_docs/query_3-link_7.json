        "text": "Evogloss decorative panels by Kastamonu, the number one manufacturer of MDF and laminate floorings in Russia, were awarded the 1st degree diploma in the nomination of industrial consumer goods\n\nThe Center for Standardization, Metrology and Testing of Tatarstan has announced the producers of the best goods and services of the republic in 2023. The annual contest The Best Goods and Services of the Republic of Tatarstan is conducted in accordance with the order of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Tatarstan No. 1969-r dated December 26, 2003 as a regional stage of the All-Russia competition 100 Best Goods of Russia. The main objectives of the contest are as follows: encouraging manufacturers to produce high-quality and competitive goods, increasing consumer confidence, promoting domestic products in the market, creating an innovative and active production environment.\n\nBased on the results of the regional stage of the republican contest, the declared products of Kastamonu - Evogloss decorative panels, were determined as the 1st degree diploma winner in the nomination of industrial consumer goods. Further, these products will be nominated for participation in the federal stage of the program. We will remind that in 2022 Kastamonu took part in the competition with Floorpan laminate floorings and was determined as a diploma winner at the federal level in the nomination of industrial consumer goods.\n\n“As in the previous year, we are convinced that our products will prove themselves well in this competition,” said Ali Kılıç, CEO of Kastamonu Russia. “Working both for the domestic and foreign markets, we are closely following the quality of our products. This is where our reputation comes from, and therefore work in this area is one of the most responsible and significant. To date, we have been able to earn a reputation as a quality manufacturer, a reliable partner and a responsible employer. We value our name, and therefore we always strive to follow the latest international standards.”\n\nKastamonu decorative panels represent the highest quality and the widest design possibilities. Evogloss is used for the production of furniture fronts, cabinet furniture, open shelves and serves as a good tool for decorating modern spaces, both residential and commercial. They are characterized by high durability of materials, ease of care, uniform and rich color. They are resistant to scratches, microcracks and fading. The declared properties are verified by various tests and confirmed by international and Russian quality certificates, which are assigned to all Kastamonu products."
