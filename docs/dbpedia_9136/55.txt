Kastamonu

Turkey

Kastamonu, city, north-central Turkey. It is situated near the GÃ¶k (ancient Amnias) River. The city lies in a sparsely populated high basin south of the densely populated Black Sea coastal plain.

As Castamon, it was on the northern trunk route to the Euphrates River and was an important Byzantine town captured by the Seljuq Turks in the late 11th century. It was taken by rival emirs in the next century and was for a time the seat of another Muslim principality before its absorption into the Ottoman Empire in 1393. Notable buildings include a ruined Byzantine fortress on a rocky hill, around which the old town was clustered; a group of religious buildings containing a theological college, a mosque, and a hospice for the poor (16th century); and a colourful covered bazaar (16th century).

Modern Kastamonu is known for its copper utensils, and it has a sugar factory. The city has a small museum and a teacher-training school. Pop. (2000) 64,606; (2013 est.) 96,217.
