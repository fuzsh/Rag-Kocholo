        "text": "MANCHESTER CITY are set to announce the signing of Borussia Dortmund star Erling Haaland THIS WEEK after the German side allowed him to take care of \"personal matters\" on Monday.\n\nHaaland is believed to have already met with Man City officials in Brussels and COMPLETED a medical ahead of the move, which he wants done by the end of the week.\n\nHaaland, 21, has scored an impressive 85 goals in 88 appearances for the Bundesliga giants, making him one of the most highly sought-after talents in world football.\n\nDortmund told Sport1: \"The players have no training today and we allowed Erling to take care of personal matters.\"\n\nSources in Germany say Dortmund are now aware that the English champions plan to activate the release clause in his contract.\n\nHaaland, who has a £64million release clause and is expected to sign a five-year deal, is believed to have visited the Erasmus Hospital in Brussels on Monday for some tests connected to the move.\n\nThe Bundesliga club’s director Sebastian Kehl said at the weekend that he expects “clarity over the next week”.\n\nAnd Haaland is believed to be happy with the financial package on offer at the Etihad.\n\nSunSport understands these will fall in line with the wage structure currently in place.\n\nKevin De Bruyne is thought to be the top earner at the club at present — on around £385,000-per-week.\n\nFREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS\n\nSo it will just be a case of when the move is made official, although City boss Pep Guardiola may not want it to distract from his team’s title push with three huge games left.\n\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: “If Haaland goes there it will not weaken them, definitely not. A lot of people talk about the money but this transfer will set new levels — let’s put it like that.”\n\nReal Madrid were the favourites to get Haaland but recently decided to devote their full attention to landing 23-year-old Kylian Mbappe instead.\n\nBarcelona and Paris Saint-Germain have also shown interest while Bayern Munich also looked at him as a possible long-term replacement for Robert Lewandowski.\n\nBut Haaland will follow in the footsteps of his father Alf-Inge who played for City from 2000-03 and has been representing him during talks.\n\nHaaland is also said to be a boyhood City fan and has been pictured in the club's kid as a youth.\n\nHis agent Mino Raiola began negotiations but passed away last month after a lengthy illness.\n\nThe framework of the deal was worked out when a delegation from Dortmund visited the Etihad in the last few days.\n\nLanding the hottest young striker in Europe will be a huge boost for Guardiola after missing out on Harry Kane last summer.\n\nThe hope is the possibility of working with Haaland will persuade Pep to extend his stay beyond 2023.\n\nHaaland was linked with a move to Dortmund's rivals Bayern Munich, with star man Robert Lewandowski's future uncertain.\n\nBut Bayern director Hasan Salihamidzic ruled out a move for the striker.\n\nSpeaking to Sport1, he said: \"We won’t be Erling Haaland’s next club, that’s for sure.\"\n\nPREM AGAINST US\n\nMeanwhile, Pep Guardiola claimed the whole of the country is supporting Liverpool over Man City in their nail-biting race for the title.\n\nAfter the 5-0 thrashing of Newcastle, Pep said: “The people want Liverpool to win more than us. It’s not an issue, it’s normal.\n\n\"Maybe they have more supporters all around the world and in England maybe more support Liverpool than us.\n\n“Everyone in this country supports Liverpool — of course because Liverpool has an incredible history in European competition.\n\n“Not in Premier Leagues though — because they’ve won one in 30 years — but it’s not a problem at all.\n\n“Liverpool, alongside Man United, it’s the most famous team, with what they have done in history — in terms of titles, legacy, history, dramas, many things.\n\n“But we are, for the last ten, 11, 12 years, coming there. I know we are sometimes uncomfortable for people but I don’t care.”"
