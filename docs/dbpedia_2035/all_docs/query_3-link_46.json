        "text": "In a potential boost for Liverpool, Borussia Dortmund sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, has hinted that Jude Bellingham may not leave Dortmund this summer.\n\nLiverpool dropped out the race for Jude Bellingham last month and Real Madrid have been the frontrunners to sign the midfielder ever since.\n\nHowever, in an interview with Sky Sports via Marca, Kehl reiterated that Bellingham still has two years left on his current deal with Dortmund and that he may stay another season in Germany.\n\nThere is also no release clause for Bellingham, meaning Dortmund can put any price they want on the player and can make negotiations very difficult for Madrid.\n\nKehl said, “There is no termination clause and he still has two years left on his contract. He is a player who has a value for us and whoever wants him will have to pay for it,” Kehl told Sky.\n\n“There have been phases where I’ve had the feeling he’s leaving, others where I’ve thought he’s staying. The fight for him will intensify after the end of the season,” added Kehl, who is not ruling out even the possibility of a contract renewal for Bellingham.\n\nKehl also stated that the Bundesliga title race could be crucial in whether Bellingham stays or not.\n\n“I don’t see us without a chance. Because I think that if, for example, if we come out on top over Bayern it will be a sign,” he said.\n\n“We know Jude wants the title. He is totally focused and out of all the discussion about his future. Naturally I am in constant contact with his parents who come to the matches,” said Kehl.\n\n“We are calm as far as Bellingham is concerned, we are prepared for different scenarios. I have to be prepared for different scenarios,” he said\n\n“If he leaves, it will be possible for us to get a lot of money according to market prices. That is a variant in which we have found solutions (with other players) in the past,” he said.\n\n“However we know that Jude Bellingham is a player you can’t replace one-for-one. In the state he is in and with his potential he is an unbelievable player. He is not replaceable, not with a lot of money either,” he added."
