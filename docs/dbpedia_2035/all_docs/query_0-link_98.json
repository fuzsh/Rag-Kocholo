        "text": "Their margin of victory looks small until you consider referee Michael Oliver's curious take on the four penalty incidents: Marouane Fellaini on Sergio Aguero in two separate incidents; Marcos Rojo on Yaya Toure (which could well have resulted in a red card); and Michael Carrick on Aguero. Fact is, City could easily have had three or four goals.\n\nSo why the relatively buoyant vibe coming from Old Trafford?\n\nIt's probably a combination of factors. The red card issued to United's Chris Smalling can't be questioned -- Van Gaal himself called it \"stupid\" -- and under normal circumstances, it wouldn't have happened and the game might have taken a totally different turn. Angel Di Maria had his quietest game since joining United, but the rest of the side didn't seem to suffer, suggesting others are willing and able to step up.\n\nMost of all, that last half-hour simply felt different. United were pushing City back, and it was the defending champions who were on the back foot, defending the lead in their house. Wayne Rooney nutmegged Vincent Kompany, Di Maria forced a world-class save from Joe Hart, and Fellaini made his presence felt in the opposition box.\n\nIt's the sort of thing you can't bottle up and store away. It's intangible but, in its own way, no less real. There's a sense that progress is being made even if -- when you look at the cold hard numbers -- United's chances (Di Maria aside) didn't amount to much: Rooney's run resulted in nothing, Fellaini's \"header\" came off his shoulder. Yet it's the sort of thing that you can build on.\n\nWould the reaction have been the same with Moyes in charge? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it's part of the Van Gaal mystique. Maybe that's why he's Van Gaal and the other guy is Moyes. The table says this is United's worst league start since 1986, the pre-Alex Ferguson era. The fact that it doesn't feel that way to many says a lot about the man in charge.\n\nNo need for Barca to panic yet\n\nIf you were mean, you'd say Luis Suarez has already made history at Barcelona. On Saturday, he became the first Barca newcomer (excluding youth team products) to lose his first two games with the club since the Brazilian striker Bio in 1978 as Suarez's side fell 1-0 at home to Celta Vigo.\n\nBut when you hit the crossbar no fewer than four times and run into a goalkeeper (Sergio Alvarez) who saves everything in sight, it's probably unwise to throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet. Not when that \"baby\" -- the atomic front three of Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar -- costs you north of $70 million a season in wages.\n\nYet even if Barcelona had scored three or four goals and taken all three points, there are still plenty of issues for manager Luis Enrique to address.\n\nThe front three will get all the column inches, and that's understandable. Suarez and Neymar on either side of Messi are too much of a burden for the midfield to carry as it is configured right now, not unless you go back to some sort of high press, which is unlikely. But there's work to be done further back, as well. Celta were outstanding, but Nolito shouldn't be doing as he pleases in the final third, either.\n\nThe good news is that Sevilla's defeat in Bilbao means Barca don't slip three points off the pace. The bad news is that with Real Madrid, Valencia and Atletico Madrid all winning, it's a right mess at the top of La Liga, with five teams in the space of two points.\n\nMourinho calls out Chelsea fans\n\nManager Jose Mourinho called out Chelsea's own supporters for the lack of atmosphere at Stamford Bridge in Saturday's 2-1 win over Queens Park Rangers.\n\n\"I can clearly say we are the team to get less support in home matches,\" he said. \"At this moment, it's difficult for us to play at home, because playing here is like playing in an empty stadium. The team then starts playing like it's a quiet, soft game at home.\"\n\nYou can see where he's coming from. Chelsea had that same sluggishness earlier this season against Leicester and Swansea, failing to get into gear in a muted atmosphere. Yet poking your fans like that is always a dangerous thing to do. Mourinho's vast popularity among the supporters is what allows him to do it.\n\nHis words prompted all sorts of discussion about the changing demographics of Premier League crowds, the proportion of \"football tourists\" taking \"selfies,\" the high price of tickets, and the fact that the game has become more corporate and sanitized. All valid points, especially the fact that ticket prices mean crowds are skewing older. The more raucous age groups -- say, 16 to 25 -- are having trouble going because they can't afford to go on their own and don't really want to go with mom and dad (and, when they do, they tend to be a bit calmer).\n\nIn Chelsea's case, though, it may have something to do with changing expectations, as well. Mourinho said it was different back in 2004 when he arrived. The fact that the club hadn't won the title in 50 years surely had something to do with it. Many fans are so used to winning, they take it for granted. Few things generate atmosphere as much as a hungry fan base.\n\nRoma aren't a title-winning team yet\n\nRoma's stint atop the Serie A table lasted all of three days -- just long enough for their trip to Naples, where Rafa Benitez's Napoli side inflicted a 2-0 spanking that, frankly, could have been much greater. Roma manager Rudi Garcia said as much when he admitted: \"We were lucky to be just a goal down at halftime.\"\n\nGarcia said the problem was \"mental,\" blaming a lack of concentration and focus. Maybe so, but Roma also looked rather spent physically. And Benitez was there to capitalize. Tactically, Napoli dominated the game, putting the likes of Gonzalo Higuain and Marek Hamsik -- two guys who had a humdrum start to the season but are now clicking nicely -- into areas where they could exact damage.\n\nAnd then there's Jose Maria Callejon. A few days after what was perhaps the Miss of the Millennium -- yes, the sound effects are appropriate -- he ran rampant and notched his seventh goal in his last seven games. It's fair to ask whether there's a better uncapped player out there.\n\nUnderdogs win in the Asian Champions League\n\nTalk about Cinderella fare. Three years ago, Western Sydney Wanderers did not exist. And now, they've won the Asian Champions League.\n\nIt wasn't always pretty. On Saturday, they took on Al-Hilal and 65,000 rabid supporters in Riyadh and hung on for a scoreless draw which, coupled with the one-nil win they eked out in the first leg, made them champions of Asia.\n\nWSW enjoyed a bumpy run all the way. They lost twice in the group stage and twice more in the knockouts, needing the away goals rule to beat the likes of Guangzhou Evergrande and Sanfrecce Hiroshima. But in many ways, the potholed journey seems fitting for a scrappy outfit that at every turn confounded expectations.\n\nAlexis stepping up for Arsenal\n\nIt's a bit bizarre how some seem surprised at the flourishing of Alexis Sanchez, who scored twice against Burnley on Saturday in Arsenal's 3-0 win. Through no fault of his own, the Gunners' forward has spent most his club career deferring to -- or at least conditioned by -- the presence of a superstar on his team. It was like this with Lionel Messi at Barcelona, obviously, but also with Antonio Di Natale at Udinese. Because Sanchez is selfless, he has accepted the role of supporting actor.\n\nAt Arsenal, at least with Mesut Ozil sidelined and Aaron Ramsey coming off the bench, Sanchez has stepped it up and taken ownership of the side. Few can match his blend of intensity and technique, which is why, on Saturday night, some on British TV were comparing him to Luis Suarez -- in English circles, that's quite the compliment.\n\nWe knew Sanchez had the tools to become a superstar ever since Udinese plunked down $3 million to sign him at the tender age of 16. The question was whether he had the aptitude. He showed he could be a sidekick; now he's proving he can be the leading man.\n\nMilan and Inter in dire straits\n\nOf course, the city of Milan has had worse weekends than the one that just passed. It's just that nobody is masochistic enough to go that far back through the record books.\n\nOn Saturday, Inter traveled to Parma, a free-falling team decimated by injuries that had racked up six defeats in a row. The nerazzurri lost 2-0, and it could have been much worse.\n\nThen, on Sunday, Milan hosted Palermo, a newly promoted club that had amassed just one point all season away from home. The visitors won 2-0, but had it not been for some exceptional Diego Lopez saves, it could have been four or five.\n\nThere will be time to analyze just why these two clubs -- which, lest we forget, have won 10 European Cups between them -- have sunk so low. A lot of it has to do with years of mismanagement at club level, failing to change with the times, and sticking to an outdated business model (if you can even call having a wealthy patron cutting a big check a \"business model\").\n\nFor now, though, you're simply left to wonder just how, when playing against a Milanese club, Paolo De Ceglie turns into Gareth Bale and Paulo Dybala becomes Sergio Aguero.\n\nSad days for Blazer, FIFA\n\nSterling work by the New York Daily News in trying to make sense of the life of Chuck Blazer, the former CONCACAF general secretary and FIFA Executive Committee member. According to the Daily News, Blazer was \"turned\" by the FBI and IRS in 2012, becoming a confidential informant and wearing a wire at meetings with FIFA and IOC bigwigs.\n\nYou wonder how much of this is going to resonate at FIFA HQ. And how much of it might have been relevant to Michael Garcia's ethics investigation."
