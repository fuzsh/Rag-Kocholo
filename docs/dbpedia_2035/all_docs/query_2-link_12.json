        "text": "Borussia Dortmund will recover from their disappointing start to the season, veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl insisted following the 1-0 home defeat to Hamburg.\n\nThe result meant a fourth league defeat in seven games for Dortmund, while it was Hamburg's first Bundesliga away win for almost a year.\n\nBut the BVB players were applauded by their fans on the Sudtribune, the biggest terrace in Europe, who sang: \"When you lose and are rock bottom, we'll back you.\"\n\n\"That was a remarkable reaction from the fans and will surely help us,\" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said.\n\n#INSERT type:image caption:Klopp said the fans' reaction to the Hamburg setback had been 'remarkable.' END#\n\nMidfielder Kevin Grosskreutz said: \"We can proud of that, but not of ourselves,\" and Kehl told Ruhr Nachrichten that while the club \"are not going through an easy phase\" he was \"proud to be a Dortmund player.\"\n\n\"It does not help to bemoan or wallow in self-pity,\" he added. \"We need to accept the situation as it is.\n\n\"We will not give up. We will get up again. The players who are set to return [from injury] will help us, even though we did not field a B-team on Saturday.\"\n\nDortmund travel to Cologne in a fortnight, when Marco Reus, Henrikh Mkihtaryan and Ilkay Gundogan -- who has not played since August 2013 because of a back injury -- could be back in contention. But they will be without left-back Marcel Schmelzer, who broke his hand against Hamburg and is expected to be out for four weeks.\n\n\"Ilkay is training normally and could be a squad member after the international break,\" Klopp told his postmatch news conference.\n\nThe coach admitted that Dortmund's performance against struggling Hamburg had been \"miles from what we want,\" adding: \"We didn't play enough football and didn't exploit the space on the wings enough.\""
