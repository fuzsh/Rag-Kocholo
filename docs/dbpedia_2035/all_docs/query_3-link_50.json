        "text": "Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho has bought a new home just around the corner from United boss Erik ten Hag, it has been claimed.\n\nSancho, 24, last played for United in August 2023. A public falling-out with Ten Hag began when the winger was left out of the squad for a match against Arsenal in early September, and resulted in Dortmund re-signing Sancho on loan in January.\n\nThe Bundesliga club are pleased with his performances back at Signal Iduna Park, and he could end the season as a Champions League winner. Questions remain over Dortmund's ability to finance a permanent move, though, and he could yet be back at United next term.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Sancho has splashed out on a £3.8million property in Hale, Greater Manchester. And the same paper reports that it's just a stone's throw from Ten Hag's own home.\n\nSancho's new home is reported to have five bedrooms, as well as an indoor swimming pool and cinema room, among other features. It is understood to be 'a few minutes walk' from Ten Hag's place.\n\nIn early May, Ten Hag indicated United had sent representatives to a number of Dortmund games this season. While it wasn't quite an admission that the player will be reintegrated under the Dutchman, it at least served as recognition that Sancho is still seen as a United player.\n\nNo decision on the player's future is expected until the end of the season, though. United still have a chance to qualify for Europe through the Premier League or FA Cup, while Sancho has been tipped to start for Dortmund against Real Madrid in the Champions League final at Wembley.\n\nCan you see Jadon Sancho playing for Manchester United next season? Have your say in the comments section\n\n\"We are visiting games,\" Ten Hag said. \"We visited, I would not say all of the games, but we have seen more games from Dortmund where Jadon was performing.\n\n\"We also had a visit with him, we had a talk with him during his stay there and we will keep going with this process, we will continually be in contact and communicate. We have four important games in the league and then the FA Cup final, so we will see in the summer what's going to happen.\"\n\nThe same week as Ten Hag's comments, Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl was asked about Sancho's future. Speaking to TNT Sports, he also addressed what might lie ahead for fellow loanee Ian Maatsen, who could make a permanent summer move from Chelsea.\n\n\"We will see,\" Kehl told TNT Sports before Dortmund beat Paris Saint-Germain to reach the Champions League final. \"They are on loan, both of them, and at the end we need to make any decisions.\n\n\"Of course they are under contract with their clubs, that means we will at a specific moment get in touch and then we will see if it's possible or not. I know that the players feel pretty welcome in Dortmund, they feel at home, especially Jadon.\n\n\"I think it was a quite good decision to take them. But again, this is something for the future, and let's keep our focus on today.\"\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!"
