        "text": "Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl admits he is unsure if the club can reach an agreement with Manchester United over Jadon Sancho this summer.\n\nSancho joined Dortmund on loan in the January transfer window after he was frozen out of United’s first-team squad by Erik ten Hag last September.\n\nThe 24-year-old refused to apologise for a social media post which hit back at Ten Hag’s suggestion that he was not performing well enough in training.\n\nSince moving to Dortmund, Sancho has recaptured his form and the German club are now keen to extend the winger’s stay.\n\nHowever, United still have a decision to make over Sancho, who they signed from Dortmund for £73 million in 2021.\n\nWhen asked about the prospect of Dortmund keeping Sancho before the defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League final, Kehl told TNT Sports: ‘I don’t know yet, to be honest.\n\n‘It was great to have him the last six months, he increased our quality in the team and he’s looking forward to the final. He wants to win.\n\n‘Everything else will be decided afterwards, the situation is pretty clear. He still has a contract with Manchester, we have no buy option which means we need to discuss and we need to negotiate, I don’t know if that will work.\n\n‘But first of all I hope he will score one or two times tonight and then the price will increase.’\n\nMeanwhile, former United defender Rio Ferdinand believes Sancho has shown ‘character’ with his response at Dortmund after falling out of favour at United.\n\n‘A lot has been said about him, a lot of it negative, and I think it’s about time people really give him a little bit of credit,’ Ferdinand told talkSPORT.\n\n‘Because I think it’s been a really difficult period for him. He’s been criticised, rightly or wrongly.\n\n‘The situation that happened between him and the manager, we can debate who was right and who was wrong. But he has been criticised heavily, confidence has been very low, he went into a period of isolation in terms of training away from the squad.\n\n‘Now he’s gone away to Dortmund to rebuild himself, as a footballer, as a human being, and he has come out the other side.\n\n‘Whether he wins the Champions League or not, what he’s achieved in this short little period of time has to be looked at and you go, “you know what? This kid’s got character”.\n\n‘He’s got personality, he’s built of the right stuff and I think that’s where he needs credit.’\n\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\n\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nMORE : Champions League final interrupted by pitch invaders after less than a minute\n\nMORE : Arsenal make move for Barcelona prospect also wanted by Man Utd and Liverpool\n\nMORE : Jose Mourinho blames Erik ten Hag for Jadon Sancho’s struggles at Manchester United"
