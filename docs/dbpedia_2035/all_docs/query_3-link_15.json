        "text": "The 2023-24 season has ended, and the winds of change are sweeping through Borussia Dortmund. Hans-Joachim Watzke is gone. A new triumvirate watches over the Ruhr, and they are cleaning house and taking stock. Edin Terzic is gone. Sven Mislintat is back. A flurry of new names have assembled at the Westfalenstadion, ready to breathe new life into an organization that too long has suffered from stagnation.\n\nOnly... are they?\n\nGo down the list: Nuri Sahin. Sven Bender. Lukasz Piszczek. Potentially Marcel Schmelzer. Add this to an organization that already featured Sebastian Kehl and Lars Ricken, and Sven Mislintat, who while he never played for BVB, cut his teeth as a scout and analyst during the same era. I don’t know about you, but with each successive hire, a quiet, subtle nagging voice at the back of my mind, that keeps repeating something like this:\n\n“Hey... isn’t it weird that BVB management is seemingly turning into a group of old buddies who used to play together and now seem to be handing out jobs to each other like they’re candy?”\n\nAt this point, it’s really just a gut feeling that could turn out to be completely misplaced when the cards fall, but it seems like Borussia Dortmund are becoming more and more of an old boys club. What does that mean? To give you a sense of what I’m talking about, I will turn to the gold standard of all internet knowledge: Wikipedia.\n\nThe term originally referred to social and business connections among former pupils of male-only elite schools, though the term is now also used to refer to any closed system of relationships that restrict opportunities to within the group... In the United States, the “Old Boys Network” is a term more focused on the inside track with connections to powerful and ambitious individuals formed through work, professional and community service organizations, and private clubs.\n\nSo broadly speaking, the old boys club is a phenomenon in business, government, academia, and other organizations in which a closed network of well-acquainted individuals are able to maintain a stranglehold of power in an organization through mutual support and favoritism, primarily based off of shared characteristics and personal relationships rather than merit. It’s the type of organization where a phone call to an old friend accompanied by a, “Want a job?” is the norm, not the exception. This phenomenon has been observed in many different contexts including academic background (such as a shared history at an elite university or prep school), gender, race, social class, or more, but none of these factors are required either.\n\nOrganizations that become infected with an old boys club can suffer from a multitude of factors that can damage both the individuals within the organization and the organization as a whole. For individuals who are not a part of the old boys club, they suffer from career stagnation, a perceived lack of respect, and even tangible effects like lower pay. Organizations affected can suffer from group think, talent loss, and a lack of innovation as anybody with ideas against the narrative is cast aside or leaves of their own accord. Over time they can become stagnant and bloated, while organizations with more external-facing, open environments are more primed to innovate and evolve with the times.\n\nThis brings me to Borussia Dortmund. Anybody with eyes can see a clear pattern emerge amidst the flurry of changes in management roles over the last few years. Sebastian Kehl, Sven Mislintat, Sven Bender, Nuri Sahin, and others, are all individuals who were involved to some extent with Borussia Dortmund year before their return to the club in management roles. Now, Nuri Sahin is bringing in Lukasz Piszczek as an assistant coach, along with some of his assistant coaches from Antalyaspor. One could be forgiven for thinking that somebody at the Westfalenstadion opened up a time portal back to 2012, which only begs the question: can we bring back Neven Subotic too? Maybe he could run the merchandise department... and while they’re at it, can they bring Psy too?\n\nOf course, it’s too early to judge any of these moves individually, and I’m not even predicting that any of them won’t work out. Aside from Sahin’s limited experience in Turkey, which I suppose is fairly promising, we don’t have much information to go on. Maybe these moves will all work out, and it just so happens that Jürgen Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund was the 1929 Yankees of future footballing executives... but something tells me that not every single one of these hires was the result of an exhaustive search through every nook and cranny of world football for the most qualified candidate possible.\n\nUltimately, we can only speculate the circumstances surrounding each of these hires. It’s possible that the bosses in Dortmund genuinely believe that they’re bringing on the best possible candidates. Even if this is the case, I’m worried that this perception is woefully misguided, and based more on the belief that assembling a group of nebulous “winners” who “bleed BVB” can bring the club back to its golden era.\n\nWorld Football is in the middle of a revolution of sorts. Clubs everywhere are modernizing at a blistering pace. Football is becoming a game played as much in office buildings as on the pitch. Sporting and analytics departments are growing, and new, larger coaching staffs with groundbreaking tactics are continually changing the game. As successful as they were in their time, the departures of Hans-Joachim Watzke and Michael Zorc seemed to pose an opportunity to move in a new, modern direction. Instead, it feels like the club is moving backwards, doubling-down on a network of buddies who might have dominated the pitch during the Obama years, but whose chops at running a club in 2024 are far less certain."
