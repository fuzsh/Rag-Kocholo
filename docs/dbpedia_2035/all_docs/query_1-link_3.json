        "meta_description": "TweetSoccerBible caught up with Sebastian Kehl, captain of Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund. The midfield player has been with the club for over 10 years, and in that time has enjoyed winning the Bundesliga title on no less than three occasions. At the recent PUMA launch of the new BVB kit, we got the chance to sit down with Kehl...As well as getting Sebastian's opinion on the new kit, we wanted to look ahead to the new season, hear who Sebastian thinks is the best midfielder in the game, and what Manchester United fans can expect from new signing Kagawa.This is a first season for Dortmund with PUMA, what do you think of the\r\nkit?\r\nSebastian Kehl: I really like the new kit. It has a nice and classic design and the fit\r\nfeels comfortable. In general I am looking forward to the new partnership\r\nwith PUMA, because it is a great step forward for the club to have signed\r\nthis deal.\r\nIs the look, fit and feel important to the players on the pitch?\r\nSK:To the players, the kit is very important. Also because the technical\r\npartner does not only provide the kit, they also produce the whole training\r\nwear. So we wear it on a day-to-day basis and it is very important to feel\r\ncomfortable and to have enough freedom of movement.\r\nIs it important to connect the players with the fans through the shirt?SK: Absolutely. The kit presents the whole personality of the club. The shirt\r\nis very important to the fans and a nice design definitely helps to build a\r\nconnection to them.How did you feel the first time you saw someone wearing a shirt with your\r\nname on the back?\r\nSK: That is probably quite a while ago now, and I don t remember a specific\r\nsituation, but I am sure it was a great moment and it still makes me proud\r\nevery time I happen to see it.\r\nWho is your favourite midfielder in world football?\r\nSK: There are so many great footballers out there. I really like to watch the\r\nChampions League and in those matches we normally get to see the best of\r\nthe best. Players like Messi, Iniesta or Ronaldo; but there are many great\r\nplayers that I like to watch playing.\r\n Who was your sporting idol growing up?\r\nSK: It was always Lothar MatthÄus, because he really impressed me during the\r\nworld cup in 1990, which was the first tournament that I really followed.Which player do you enjoy having midfield battles against in the\r\nBundesliga?SK: There is no-one in particular. I have many good friends in the Bundesliga\r\nand we often get to play against each other, but in a match situation\r\neverybody wants to play well, so that is what counts. But in general I\r\nneither have a favourite opponent nor do I have someone that I would like\r\nto avoid in particular. As I am rather tall I prefer to not play against\r\nsmall and agile midfielders.Are you confident or defending your Bundesliga title?\r\nSK: Of course we have great ambitions for the upcoming season, but looking at\r\nthe fact that we have broke quite a few records during the last two years,\r\nI would be arrogant to expect it to continue just like that. In all three\r\ncompetitions we will do our best to achieve as much as possible.\r\n Who would you say is the best player in the Dortmund squad?\r\nSK: The team.\r\n Who's got the best tricks in training?\r\nSK: Obviously many players try tricks in training, which they wouldn t dare to\r\ndo in a match situation. Especially Mario GÖtze or Moritz Leitner often\r\nlike to try a few new tricks.\r\nWhich player at the club is the comedian who plays practical jokes?\r\nSK: The whole team is a great mix of different characters. Though the younger\r\nplayers are sometimes more open and easy-going than the more experienced\r\nplayers in the team. But there are always jokes in the changing rooms, even\r\nfrom players of which you wouldn t necessarily expect it.What can Manchester United fans expect from signing Kagawa?\r\nSK: They really can be looking forward. He is a great player that was important\r\nfor us and played a really good season. I believe that through his way to\r\nplay football he has good chances to build his profile in England very\r\nquickly. We will miss him.Is the Signal Iduna Park the greatest football stadium you've played in, as\r\nthe south stand, die SÜdtribÜne is certainly impressive?\r\nSK: The SÜdtribÜne and also the stadium itself are incredible. It cannot be\r\ncompared to all the newer stadiums and with an audience of 83.000 people it\r\nis just one of the kind. And we have best fans in Germany. I am already\r\nlooking forward to the new season.\r\n What's the favourite goal you've scored?\r\nSK: As I am not a real striker, there are more other moments that were\r\nimportant for my career. Of course I remember a few nice ones, but I don t\r\nhave a favourite goal.Do you have ambitions left to fulfil in your career?SK: Most importantly I hope to stay fit and healthy. Being a professional\r\nfootballer is probably one of the best jobs in the world and as long as I\r\nstay fit, I enjoy it a lot to play for a great club with amazing fans that\r\nstill give me goosebumps whenever I walk out onto the pitch.Would you consider a move to the MLS?SK: The idea to move to America became more and more popular and it also sounds\r\nattractive to me. Many German players made that move and who knows, maybe\r\nan opportunity pops up for me as well. SoccerBible was speaking to Sebastian Kehl at the launch event for the new BVB 2012/13 football kits, and don't forget to leave your opinions on Sebastian, Dortmund and PUMA online, on Twitter and on Facebook.",
