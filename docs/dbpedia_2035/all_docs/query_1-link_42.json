        "text": "Prefecture and commune in Grand Est, France\n\nThis article is about the city in France. For the place in Canada, see Strasbourg, Saskatchewan. For the city in the U.S., see Strasburg, Virginia.\n\nPrefecture and commune in Grand Est, France\n\nStrasbourg ( ,[5] ,[6] French: [stʁasbuʁ] ⓘ; German: Straßburg [ˈʃtʁaːsbʊʁk] ⓘ;[7][8]) is the prefecture and largest city of the Grand Est region of eastern France, at the border with Germany in the historic region of Alsace. It is the prefecture of the Bas-Rhin department and the official seat of the European Parliament.\n\nThe city has about three hundred thousand inhabitants, and together Greater Strasbourg and the Arrondissement of Strasbourg have over five hundred thousand.[9] Strasbourg's metropolitan area had a population of 860,744 in 2020,[4] making it the eighth-largest metro area in France and home to 14% of the Grand Est region's inhabitants. The transnational Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau had a population of roughly 1,000,000 in 2022. Strasbourg is one of the de facto four main capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Luxembourg and Frankfurt), as it is the seat of several European institutions, such as the European Parliament, the Eurocorps and the European Ombudsman of the European Union. An organization separate from the European Union, the Council of Europe (with its European Court of Human Rights, its European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines most commonly known in French as \"Pharmacopée Européenne\", and its European Audiovisual Observatory) is also located in the city.\n\nTogether with Basel (Bank for International Settlements), Geneva (United Nations), The Hague (International Court of Justice) and New York City (United Nations world headquarters), Strasbourg is among the few cities in the world that is not a state capital that hosts international organisations of the first order.[10] The city is the seat of many non-European international institutions such as the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine and the International Institute of Human Rights.[11] It is the second city in France in terms of international congress and symposia, after Paris. Strasbourg's historic city centre, the Grande Île (Grand Island), was classified a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988, with the newer \"Neustadt\" being added to the site in 2017.[12] Strasbourg is immersed in Franco-German culture and although violently disputed throughout history, has been a cultural bridge between France and Germany for centuries, especially through the University of Strasbourg, currently the second-largest in France, and the coexistence of Catholic and Protestant culture. It is also home to the largest Islamic place of worship in France, the Strasbourg Grand Mosque.[13]\n\nEconomically, Strasbourg is an important centre of manufacturing and engineering, as well as a hub of road, rail, and river transportation. The port of Strasbourg is the second-largest on the Rhine after Duisburg in Germany, and the second-largest river port in France after Paris.[14][15]\n\nEtymology and names\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil the fifth century AD, the city was known as Argantorati (in the nominative, Argantorate in the locative), a Celtic Gaulish name Latinised first as Argentorate (with Gaulish locative ending, as appearing on the first Roman milestones in the first century) and then as Argentoratum (with regular Latin nominative ending, in later Latin texts). That Gaulish name is a compound of -rati, the Gaulish word for fortified enclosures, cognate to the Old Irish ráth (see ringfort) and arganto(n)- (cognate to Latin argentum, which gave modern French argent), the Gaulish word for silver, but also any precious metal, particularly gold, suggesting either a fortified enclosure located by a river gold mining site, or hoarding gold mined in the nearby rivers.[16]\n\nAfter the fifth century the city became known by a completely different name, later Gallicized as Strasbourg (Lower Alsatian: Strossburi; German: Straßburg). That name is of Germanic origin and means 'town (at the crossing) of roads'. The modern Stras- is cognate with the German Straße and English street, both derived from Latin strata (\"paved road\"), while -bourg is cognate with the German Burg and English borough, both derived from Proto-Germanic *burgz (\"hill fort, fortress\").\n\nGregory of Tours was the first to mention the name change: in the tenth book of his History of the Franks written shortly after 590 he said that Egidius, Bishop of Reims, accused of plotting against King Childebert II of Austrasia in favor of his uncle King Chilperic I of Neustria, was tried by a synod of Austrasian bishops in Metz in November 590, found guilty and removed from the priesthood, then taken \"ad Argentoratensem urbem, quam nunc Strateburgum vocant\" (\"to the city of Argentoratum, which they now call Strateburgus\"), where he was exiled.[17]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Strasbourg\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Strasbourg.\n\nThe Roman camp of Argentoratum was first mentioned in 12 BCE; the city of Strasbourg which grew from it celebrated its 2,000th anniversary in 1988. The fertile area in the Upper Rhine Plain between the rivers Ill and Rhine had already been populated since the Middle Paleolithic.[18][19]\n\nBetween 362 and 1262, Strasbourg was governed by the bishops of Strasbourg; their rule was reinforced in 873 and then more in 982.[20] In 1262, the citizens violently rebelled against the bishop's rule (Battle of Hausbergen) and Strasbourg became a free imperial city. It became a French city in 1681, after the conquest of Alsace by the armies of Louis XIV. In 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War, the city became German again, until 1918 (end of World War I), when it reverted to France. Strasbourg was captured by the German army in June 1940 at the end of the Battle of France (World War II), and subsequently came under German control again through formal annexation into the Gau Baden-Elsaß under the Nazi Gauleiter Robert Wagner; since the liberation of the city by the 2nd French Armoured Division under General Leclerc in November 1944, it has again been a French city. In 2016, Strasbourg was promoted from capital of Alsace to capital of Grand Est.\n\nStrasbourg played an important part in the Protestant Reformation, with personalities such as John Calvin, Martin Bucer, Wolfgang Capito, Matthew and Katharina Zell, but also in other aspects of Christianity such as German mysticism, with Johannes Tauler, Pietism, with Philipp Spener, and Reverence for Life, with Albert Schweitzer. Delegates from the city took part in the Protestation at Speyer. It was also one of the first centres of the printing industry with pioneers such as Johannes Gutenberg, Johannes Mentelin, and Heinrich Eggestein. Among the darkest periods in the city's long history were the years 1349 (Strasbourg massacre), 1518 (Dancing plague), 1793 (Reign of Terror), 1870 (Siege of Strasbourg) and the years 1940–1944 with the Nazi occupation (atrocities such as the Jewish skull collection) and the British and American bombing raids. Some other notable dates were the years 357 (Battle of Argentoratum), 842 (Oaths of Strasbourg), 1538 (establishment of the university), 1605 (world's first newspaper printed by Johann Carolus), 1792 (La Marseillaise), and 1889 (pancreatic origin of diabetes discovered by Minkowski and Von Mering).\n\nStrasbourg has been the seat of European institutions since 1949: first of the International Commission on Civil Status and of the Council of Europe, later of the European Parliament, of the European Science Foundation, of Eurocorps, and others as well.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nStrasbourg is situated at the eastern border of France with Germany. This border is formed by the Rhine, which also forms the eastern border of the modern city, facing across the river to the German town Kehl. The historic core of Strasbourg, however, lies on the Grande Île in the river Ill, which here flows parallel to, and roughly 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from, the Rhine. The natural courses of the two rivers eventually join some distance downstream of Strasbourg, although several artificial waterways now connect them within the city.\n\nThe city lies in the Upper Rhine Plain, at between 132 and 151 metres (433 and 495 ft) above sea level, with the upland areas of the Vosges Mountains some 20 km (12 mi) to the west and the Black Forest 25 km (16 mi) to the east. This section of the Rhine valley is a major axis of north–south travel, with river traffic on the Rhine itself, and major roads and railways paralleling it on both banks.\n\nThe city is some 397 kilometres (247 mi) east of Paris.[21] The mouth of the Rhine lies approximately 450 kilometres (280 mi) to the north, or 650 kilometres (400 mi) as the river flows, whilst the head of navigation in Basel is some 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the south, or 150 kilometres (93 mi) by river.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nIn spite of its position far inland, Strasbourg has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb),[22][23] though with less maritime influence than the milder climates of Western and Southern France.[24] The city has warm, relatively sunny summers and cool, overcast winters.\n\nThe third highest temperature ever recorded was 38.5 °C (101.3 °F) in August 2003, during the 2003 European heat wave. This record was broken, on 30 June 2019, when it reached 38.8 °C (101.8 °F) [25] and then on 25 July 2019, when it reached 38.9 °C (102.0 °F). The lowest temperature ever recorded was −23.4 °C (−10.1 °F) in December 1938.[26]\n\nStrasbourg's location in the Rhine valley, sheltered from strong winds by the Vosges and Black Forest mountains, results in poor natural ventilation, making Strasbourg one of the most atmospherically polluted cities of France.[27][28] Nonetheless, the progressive disappearance of heavy industry on both banks of the Rhine, as well as effective measures of traffic regulation in and around the city have reduced air pollution in recent years.[29]\n\nDistricts\n\n[edit]\n\nStrasbourg is divided into the following districts:[32]\n\nBourse, Esplanade, Krutenau\n\nCentre Ville (Downtown Strasbourg)\n\nGare, Tribunal (Central Station, Court)\n\nConseil des XV, Orangerie\n\nCronenbourg\n\nHautepierre, Poteries\n\nKoenigshoffen,\n\nMontagne-Verte (Green Hill)\n\nElsau\n\nMeinau\n\nNeudorf-Musau\n\nNeuhof 1 (including Ganzau)\n\nNeuhof 2\n\nRobertsau\n\nPort du Rhin (Rhine's Harbor)\n\nMain sights\n\n[edit]\n\nArchitecture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is chiefly known for its sandstone Gothic Cathedral with its famous astronomical clock, and for its medieval cityscape of Rhineland black and white timber-framed buildings, particularly in the Petite France district or Gerberviertel (\"tanners' district\") alongside the Ill and in the streets and squares surrounding the cathedral, where the renowned Maison Kammerzell stands out.\n\nNotable medieval streets include Rue Mercière, Rue des Dentelles, Rue du Bain aux Plantes, Rue des Juifs, Rue des Frères, Rue des Tonneliers, Rue du Maroquin, Rue des Charpentiers, Rue des Serruriers, Grand' Rue, Quai des Bateliers, Quai Saint-Nicolas and Quai Saint-Thomas. Notable medieval squares include Place de la Cathédrale, Place du Marché Gayot, Place Saint-Étienne, Place du Marché aux Cochons de Lait and Place Benjamin Zix.\n\nIn addition to the cathedral, Strasbourg houses several other medieval churches that have survived the many wars and destructions that have plagued the city: the Romanesque Église Saint-Étienne, partly destroyed in 1944 by Allied bombing raids; the part-Romanesque, part-Gothic, very large Église Saint-Thomas with its Silbermann organ on which Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Albert Schweitzer played;[33][34] the Gothic Église protestante Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune with its crypt dating back to the seventh century and its cloister partly from the eleventh century; the Gothic Église Saint-Guillaume with its fine early-Renaissance stained glass and furniture; the Gothic Église Saint-Jean; the part-Gothic, part-Art Nouveau Église Sainte-Madeleine etc. The Neo-Gothic church Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Catholique (there is also an adjacent church Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Protestant) serves as a shrine for several 15th-century wood-worked and painted altars coming from other, now destroyed churches and installed there for public display; especially the Passion of Christ. Among the numerous secular medieval buildings, the monumental Ancienne Douane (old custom-house) stands out.\n\nThe German Renaissance has bequeathed the city some noteworthy buildings (especially the current Chambre de commerce et d'industrie, former town hall, on Place Gutenberg), as did the French Baroque and Classicism with several hôtels particuliers (i.e. palaces), among which the Palais Rohan (completed 1742, used for university purposes from 1872 to 1895,[35] now housing three museums) is the most spectacular. Other buildings of its kind are the \"Hôtel de Hanau\" (1736, now the city hall); the Hôtel de Klinglin (1736, now residence of the préfet); the Hôtel des Deux-Ponts (1755, now residence of the military governor); the Hôtel d'Andlau-Klinglin (1725, now seat of the administration of the Port autonome de Strasbourg) etc. The largest baroque building of Strasbourg though is the 150-metre-long (490 ft) 1720s main building of the Hôpital civil. As for French Neo-classicism, it is the Opera House on Place Broglie that most prestigiously represents this style.\n\nStrasbourg also offers high-class eclecticist buildings in its very extended German district, the Neustadt, being the main memory of Wilhelmian architecture since most of the major cities in Germany proper suffered intensive damage during World War II. Streets, boulevards and avenues are homogeneous, surprisingly high (up to seven stories) and broad examples of German urban lay-out and of this architectural style that summons and mixes up five centuries of European architecture as well as Neo-Egyptian, Neo-Greek and Neo-Babylonian styles. The former imperial palace Palais du Rhin, the most political and thus heavily criticized of all German Strasbourg buildings epitomizes the grand scale and stylistic sturdiness of this period. But the two most handsome and ornate buildings of these times are the École internationale des Pontonniers (the former Höhere Mädchenschule, with its towers, turrets and multiple round and square angles[36] and the Haute école des arts du Rhin with its lavishly ornate façade of painted bricks, woodwork and majolica.[37]\n\nNotable streets of the German district include: Avenue de la Forêt Noire, Avenue des Vosges, Avenue d'Alsace, Avenue de la Marseillaise, Avenue de la Liberté, Boulevard de la Victoire, Rue Sellénick, Rue du Général de Castelnau, Rue du Maréchal Foch, and Rue du Maréchal Joffre. Notable squares of the German district include Place de la République, Place de l'Université, Place Brant, and Place Arnold.\n\nImpressive examples of Prussian military architecture of the 1880s can be found along the newly reopened Rue du Rempart, displaying large-scale fortifications among which the aptly named Kriegstor (war gate).\n\nAs for modern and contemporary architecture, Strasbourg possesses some fine Art Nouveau buildings (such as the huge Palais des Fêtes and houses and villas like Villa Schutzenberger and Hôtel Brion), good examples of post-World War II functional architecture (the Cité Rotterdam, for which Le Corbusier did not succeed in the architectural contest) and, in the very extended Quartier Européen, some spectacular administrative buildings of sometimes utterly large size, among which the European Court of Human Rights building by Richard Rogers is arguably the finest. Other noticeable contemporary buildings are the new Music school Cité de la Musique et de la Danse, the Musée d'Art moderne et contemporain and the Hôtel du Département facing it, as well as, in the outskirts, the tramway-station Hoenheim-Nord designed by Zaha Hadid.\n\nThe city has many bridges, including the medieval and four-towered Ponts Couverts that, despite their name, are no longer covered. Next to the Ponts Couverts is the Barrage Vauban, a part of Vauban's 17th-century fortifications, that does include a covered bridge. Other bridges are the ornate 19th-century Pont de la Fonderie (1893, stone) and Pont d'Auvergne (1892, iron), as well as architect Marc Mimram's futuristic Passerelle over the Rhine, opened in 2004.\n\nThe largest square at the centre of the city of Strasbourg is the Place Kléber. Located in the heart of the city's commercial area, it was named after general Jean-Baptiste Kléber, born in Strasbourg in 1753 and assassinated in 1800 in Cairo. In the square is a statue of Kléber, under which is a vault containing his remains. On the north side of the square is the Aubette (Orderly Room), built by Jacques François Blondel, architect of the king, in 1765–1772.\n\nParks\n\n[edit]\n\nStrasbourg features a number of prominent parks, of which several are of cultural and historical interest: the Parc de l'Orangerie, laid out as a French garden by André le Nôtre and remodeled as an English garden on behalf of Joséphine de Beauharnais, now displaying noteworthy French gardens, a neo-classical castle and a small zoo; the Parc de la Citadelle, built around impressive remains of the 17th-century fortress erected close to the Rhine by Vauban;[38] the Parc de Pourtalès, laid out in English style around a baroque castle (heavily restored in the 19th century) that now houses a small three-star hotel,[39] and featuring an open-air museum of international contemporary sculpture.[40] The Jardin botanique de l'Université de Strasbourg (botanical garden) was created under the German administration next to the Observatory of Strasbourg, built in 1881, and still owns some greenhouses of those times. The Parc des Contades, although the oldest park of the city, was completely remodeled after World War II. The futuristic Parc des Poteries is an example of European park-conception in the late 1990s. The Jardin des deux Rives, spread over Strasbourg and Kehl on both sides of the Rhine opened in 2004 and is the most extended (60-hectare) park of the agglomeration. The most recent park is Parc du Heyritz (8,7 ha), opened in 2014 along a canal facing the hôpital civil.\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2020, the city of Strasbourg has eleven municipal museums (including Aubette 1928),[41] eleven university museums,[42] and at least two privately owned museums (Musée vodou and Musée du barreau de Strasbourg). Five communes in the metropolitan area also have museums (see below), three of them dedicated to military history.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe collections in Strasbourg are distributed over a wide range of museums, according to a system that takes into account not only the types and geographical provenances of the items, but also the epochs. This concerns in particular the following domains:\n\nOld Master paintings from the Germanic Rhenish territories and until 1681 are displayed in the Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame (MOND); old master paintings from all the rest of Europe (including the Dutch Rhenish territories) and until 1871, as well as old master paintings from the Germanic Rhenish territories between 1681 and 1871, are displayed in the Musée des Beaux-Arts; paintings since 1871 are displayed in the Musée d'art moderne et contemporain (MAMCS).\n\nDecorative arts until 1681 are on display in the MOND, decorative arts from the years 1681 until 1871 are on display in the Musée des arts décoratifs, decorative arts after 1871 are on display at the MAMCS, with items from each epoch also shown in the Musée historique.\n\nPrints and drawings until 1871 are displayed in the Cabinet des estampes et dessins, save for the original plans of Strasbourg Cathedral, displayed in the MOND. Prints and drawings after 1871 are displayed in the MAMCS, and in the Musée Tomi Ungerer/Centre international de l'illustration (the combined number of prints and drawings amounts to well over 200,000).\n\nArtefacts from Ancient Egypt are on display in two entirely different collections, one in the Musée archéologique and the other belonging to the Instituts d'Égyptologie et de Papyrologie of the University of Strasbourg.\n\nFine art museums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Musée des Beaux-Arts owns paintings by Hans Memling, Francisco de Goya, Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese, Giotto di Bondone, Sandro Botticelli, Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, El Greco, Correggio, Cima da Conegliano and Piero di Cosimo, among others.\n\nThe Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame (located in a part-Gothic, part-Renaissance building next to the cathedral) houses a large and renowned collection of medieval and Renaissance upper-Rhenish art, among which original sculptures, plans and stained glass from the cathedral and paintings by Hans Baldung and Sebastian Stoskopff.\n\nThe Musée d'Art moderne et contemporain is among the largest museums of its kind in France.\n\nThe Musée des Arts décoratifs, located in the sumptuous former residence of the cardinals of Rohan, the Palais Rohan displays a reputable collection of 18th century furniture and china.\n\nThe Cabinet des estampes et des dessins displays five centuries of engravings and drawings, but also woodcuts and lithographies.\n\nThe Musée Tomi Ungerer/Centre international de l'illustration, located in a large former villa next to the Theatre, displays original works by Ungerer and other artists (Saul Steinberg, Ronald Searle ... ) as well as Ungerer's large collection of ancient toys.\n\nOther museums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Musée archéologique presents a large display of regional findings from the first ages of man to the sixth century, focusing on the Roman and Celtic period. It also includes a collection of works from Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece, assembled and bequeathed by Gustave Schlumberger.[43]\n\nThe Musée alsacien is dedicated to traditional Alsatian daily life.\n\nLe Vaisseau (\"The vessel\") is a science and technology centre, especially designed for children.\n\nThe Musée historique (historical museum) is dedicated to the tumultuous history of the city and displays many artifacts of the times, including the Grüselhorn, the horn that was blown at 10 every evening during medieval times to order the Jews out of the city.\n\nThe Musée vodou (Voodoo museum) opened its doors on 28 November 2013. Displaying a private collection of artefacts from Haiti, it is located in a former water tower (château d'eau) built in 1883 and classified as a Monument historique.\n\nThe Musée du barreau de Strasbourg (The Strasbourg bar association museum) is a museum dedicated to the work and the history of lawyers in the city.[44][45]\n\nUniversity museums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Université de Strasbourg is in charge of a number of permanent public displays of its collections of scientific artefacts and products of all kinds of exploration and research.[46]\n\nThe Musée zoologique is one of the oldest in France and is especially famous for its collection of birds. The museum is co-administered by the municipality.\n\nThe Gypsothèque (also known as Musée des moulages or Musée Adolf Michaelis) is France's second-largest cast collection and the largest university cast collection in France.\n\nThe Musée de Sismologie et Magnétisme terrestre displays antique instruments of measure.\n\nThe Musée Pasteur is a collection of medical curiosities.\n\nThe Musée de minéralogie is dedicated to minerals.\n\nThe Musée d'Égyptologie houses a collections of archaeological findings made in and brought from Egypt and Sudan. This collection is entirely separate from the Schlumberger collection of the Musée archéologique (see above).[47]\n\nThe Crypte aux étoiles (\"star crypt\") is situated in the vaulted basement below the Observatory of Strasbourg and displays old telescopes and other antique astronomical devices such as clocks and theodolites.\n\nMuseums in the suburbs\n\n[edit]\n\nMusée Les Secrets du Chocolat (Chocolate museum) in Geispolsheim[48]\n\nFort Frère in Oberhausbergen[49]\n\nFort Rapp in Reichstett\n\nMM Park France, a military museum, in La Wantzenau[50]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe commune of Strasbourg proper had a population of 291,313 on 1 January 2021,[9] the result of a constant moderate annual growth which is also reflected in the constant growth of the number of students at its university (e. g. from 42,000 students in 2010 to 52,000 students in 2019).[51] The metropolitan area of Strasbourg had a population of 853,110 inhabitants in 2019 (French side of the border only),[4] while the transnational Eurodistrict had a population of 1,000,000 in 2022.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Strasbourg (a free imperial city since 1262), was an important town. According to a 1444 census, the population was circa 20,000; only one third less than Cologne, then a major European city.[52]\n\nPopulation growth\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population\n\nYearPop.±% p.a.1793 47,254— 1800 49,056+0.54%1806 51,465+0.80%1821 49,680−0.24%1831 49,712+0.01%1836 57,885+3.09%1841 70,298+3.96%1846 71,992+0.48%1851 75,565+0.97%1856 77,656+0.55%1861 82,014+1.10%1866 84,167+0.52%1871 85,654+0.35%1875 94,306+2.43%1880 104,471+2.07%1885 111,987+1.40%1890 123,500+1.98%1895 135,608+1.89%1900 151,041+2.18%\n\nYearPop.±% p.a.1905 167,678+2.11%1910 178,891+1.30%1921 166,767−0.64%1926 174,492+0.91%1931 181,465+0.79%1936 193,119+1.25%1946 175,515−0.95%1954 200,921+1.70%1962 228,971+1.65%1968 249,396+1.43%1975 253,384+0.23%1982 248,712−0.27%1990 252,338+0.18%1999 264,115+0.51%2007 272,123+0.37%2012 274,394+0.17%2017 280,966+0.47%2020 290,576+1.13%\n\nSource: EHESS[53] and INSEE (1968-2017)[54]\n\nPopulation composition\n\n[edit]\n\n2012 % 2007 % Total population 274,394 100 272,123 100 0–14 years 47,473 17.3 46,263 17.0 15–29 years 77,719 28.3 78,291 28.8 30–44 years 54,514 19.9 54,850 20.2 45–59 years 45,436 16.6 47,236 17.4 60–74 years 30,321 11.1 27,060 9.9 75+ years 18,931 6.9 18,424 6.8\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nStrasbourg is the seat of internationally renowned institutions of music and drama:\n\nThe Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg, founded in 1855, one of the oldest symphonic orchestras in western Europe.

Although Strasbourg had been annexed by the Kingdom of France in 1683, it still remained connected to the German-speaking intellectual world throughout the 18th century, and the university attracted numerous students from the Holy Roman Empire, with Goethe, Metternich and Montgelas, who studied law in Strasbourg, among the most prominent. With 19 Nobel prizes in total, Strasbourg is the most eminent French university outside of Paris.\n\nUntil 2009, there were three universities in Strasbourg, with an approximate total of 48,500 students in 2007, and another 4,500 students attended one of the diverse post-graduate schools:[56]\n\nStrasbourg I – Louis Pasteur University\n\nStrasbourg II – Marc Bloch University\n\nStrasbourg III – Robert Schuman University\n\nThe three institutions merged in 2009, forming the Université de Strasbourg. Its component schools include:\n\nSciences Po Strasbourg (Institut d'études politiques de Strasbourg), the University of Strasbourg's political science and international studies centre\n\nThe EMS (EM Strasbourg Business School), the University of Strasbourg's business school\n\nThe INSA (Institut national des sciences appliquées), the University of Strasbourg's engineering school\n\nThe ENA (École nationale d'administration). ENA trains most of the nation's high-ranking civil servants. The relocation to Strasbourg was meant to give a European vocation to the school and to implement the French government's \"décentralisation\" plan.\n\nThe ISEG Group (Institut supérieur européen de gestion group)\n\nThe ECPM (École européenne de chimie, polymères et matériaux)\n\nThe EPITA (École pour l'informatique et les techniques avancées)\n\nThe EPITECH (École pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies)\n\nThe ITIRI (Institute de traducteurs, d'interpretes, et de relations Internationales)\n\nThe INET (Institut national des études territoriales)\n\nThe IIEF (Institut international d'études françaises)\n\nThree IUTs (Instituts universitaires de technologie located in Schiltigheim, Illkirch, and Haguenau)\n\nThe ENGEES (École nationale du génie de l'eau et de l'environnement de Strasbourg)\n\nThe CUEJ (Centre universitaire d'enseignement du journalisme)\n\nTÉLÉCOM Physique Strasbourg (École nationale supérieure de physique de Strasbourg), Institute of Technology, located in the South of Strasbourg (Illkirch-Graffenstaden)\n\nOther tertiary institutions\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo American colleges have a base in Strasbourg: University of Syracuse, New York, and Centre College, Kentucky. There is also HEAR (Haute école des arts du Rhin) the celebrated art school, and the International Space University in the south of Strasbourg (Illkirch-Graffenstaden).\n\nThe European Center for Studies and Research in Ethics [57] is a tertiary establishment for research and education in Ethics. This center is located at the premises of the old faculty of medicine in Strasbourg. The Center’s name in French is CEERE (Centre européen d’enseignement et de recherche en éthique).\n\nPrimary and secondary education\n\n[edit]\n\nInternational schools include:\n\nMultiple levels:\n\nEuropean School of Strasbourg (priority given to children whose parents are employed at the European institutions)\n\nFor elementary education:[58]\n\nÉcole Internationale Robert Schuman\n\nInternational School at Lucie Berger\n\nRussian Mission School in Strasbourg[59]\n\nFor middle school/junior high school education:[58]\n\nCollège International de l'Esplanade\n\nFor senior high school/sixth form college:[58]\n\nLycée International des Pontonniers (FR)\n\nLycée International Jean Sturm\n\nLibraries\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire (BNU) is, with its collection of more than 3,000,000 titles,[60] the second-largest library in France after the Bibliothèque nationale de France. It was founded by the German administration after the complete destruction of the previous municipal library in 1871 and holds the unique status of being simultaneously a students' and a national library. The Strasbourg municipal library had been marked erroneously as \"City Hall\" in a French commercial map, which had been captured and used by the German artillery to lay their guns. A librarian from Munich later pointed out \"...that the destruction of the precious collection was not the fault of a German artillery officer, who used the French map, but of the slovenly and inaccurate scholarship of a Frenchman.\"[61]\n\nThe municipal library Bibliothèque municipale de Strasbourg (BMS) administers a network of ten medium-sized libraries in different areas of the town. A six stories high \"Grande bibliothèque\", the Médiathèque André Malraux, was inaugurated on 19 September 2008 and is considered the largest in Eastern France.[62]\n\nIncunabula\n\n[edit]\n\nAs one of the earliest centres of book-printing in Europe (see above: History), Strasbourg for a long time held a large number of incunabula — books printed before 1500 — in its library as one of its most precious heritages: no less than 7,000.[63] After the total destruction of this institution in 1870, however, a new collection had to be reassembled from scratch. Today, Strasbourg's different public and institutional libraries again display a sizable total number of incunabula, distributed as follows: Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire, ca. 2,120,[63] Médiathèque de la ville et de la communauté urbaine de Strasbourg, 349,[64] Bibliothèque du Grand Séminaire, 238,[65] Médiathèque protestante, 66,[66] and Bibliothèque alsatique du Crédit Mutuel, 5.[67]\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nTrain services operate from the Gare de Strasbourg, the city's main station in the city centre, eastward to Offenburg and Karlsruhe in Germany, westward to Metz and Paris, and southward to Basel. Strasbourg's links with the rest of France have improved due to its recent connection to the TGV network, with the first phase of the TGV Est (Paris–Strasbourg) in 2007, the TGV Rhin-Rhône (Strasbourg-Lyon) in 2012, and the second phase of the TGV Est in July 2016.\n\nStrasbourg also has its own airport, serving major domestic destinations as well as international destinations in Europe and northern Africa. The airport is linked to the Gare de Strasbourg by a frequent train service.[68][69]\n\nCity transport in Strasbourg includes the Strasbourg tramway, which opened in 1994 and is operated by the regional transit company Compagnie des Transports Strasbourgeois (CTS), consisting of 6 lines with a total length of 55.8 km (34.7 mi). The CTS also operates a comprehensive bus network throughout the city that is integrated with the trams. With more than 500 km (311 mi) of bicycle paths, biking in the city is convenient and the CTS operates a cheap bike-sharing scheme named Vélhop. The CTS, and its predecessors, also operated a previous generation of tram system between 1878 and 1960, complemented by trolleybus routes between 1939 and 1962.[70]\n\nBeing on the Ill and close to the Rhine, Strasbourg has always been an important centre of fluvial navigation, as is attested by archeological findings. In 1682 the Canal de la Bruche was added to the river navigations, initially to provide transport for sandstone from quarries in the Vosges for use in the fortification of the city. That canal has since closed, but the subsequent Canal du Rhône au Rhin, Canal de la Marne au Rhin and Grand Canal d'Alsace are still in use, as is the important activity of the Port autonome de Strasbourg. Water tourism inside the city proper attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.\n\nThe tram system that now criss-crosses the historic city centre complements walking and biking in it. The centre has been transformed into a pedestrian priority zone that enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable, safe and enjoyable. These attributes are accomplished by applying the principle of \"filtered permeability\" to the existing irregular network of streets. It means that the network adaptations favour active transport and, selectively, \"filter out\" the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip. This logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts – the fused grid.\n\nAt present the A35 autoroute, which parallels the Rhine between Karlsruhe and Basel, and the A4 autoroute, which links Paris with Strasbourg, penetrate close to the centre of the city. The Grand contournement ouest (GCO) project, programmed since 1999, planned to construct a 24-kilometre-long (15 mi) highway connection between the junctions of the A4 and the A35 autoroutes in the north and of the A35 and A352 autoroutes in the south. This routes well to the west of the city in order to divest a significant portion of motorized traffic from the unité urbaine.[71] The GCO project was opposed by environmentalists, who created a ZAD (or Zone to Defend).[72] After much delay, the GCO was finally inaugurated on 11 December 2021.[73]\n\nStrasbourg public transport statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting on public transport in Strasbourg on weekdays is 52 min. 7% of travellers on public transport travel for more than 2 hours every day.
