Everything else will be revealed in the near future. We are preparing for different scenarios.”\n\nBellingham joined the Bundesliga club in the summer of 2020 from Birmingham City. His current contract expires in the summer of 2025.\n\nThe 19-year-old made 42 appearances for the club in all competitions this season, scoring 14 goals, providing seven assists and captaining the side on several occasions.\n\nBut Dortmund missed winning their first Bundesliga title in 11 years after being held to a 2-2 draw by Mainz last Saturday, a game Bellingham sat out through injury.\n\nWhere would Bellingham fit best?\n\nMark Carey has looked in detail here at Bellingham’s skill set, focussing on his progressive passing, defensive work and attacking contributions and analysed which club he would be best suited to next with help from SentientSports…\n\n“At just 19 years old, the fact we need little convincing of Bellingham’s career trajectory shows just how talented he is — he is incredibly well-rounded in his playing profile.\n\n“Particularly as Edin Terzic has rotated between a 4-2-3-1, a 4-3-3 and a 4-1-4-1 system at Dortmund this season, Bellingham has showcased his versatility to play as a No 4, No 8 and No 10 — a “Jude of all trades”, if you will.\n\n“He is a generational talent, one of the most coveted midfielders in world football, and has earned the right to select his next career destination.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nPredicting which football club would best fit Jude Bellingham next season\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)"
