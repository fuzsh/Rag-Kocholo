        "text": "Borussia Dortmund’s Sebastian Kehl has kicked Arsenal while they’re down, saying that the Gunners ‘never really offered much’ against his Dortmund side, and that the German club ‘could easily have won 4-0.’\n\nArsenal were torn to shreds by an irrepressible Dortmund last night, and Kehl wasn’t particularly shocked by how the match played out.\n\n‘I’m not really surprised [by how dominant we were],’ he said.\n\n‘Arsenal never really got into the game, they never really got going, and in the end we scored and deserved to win based on the way we played.\n\n‘We were alert, in good form and that caused them a lot of problems’.\n\nDefensive midfielder Kehl had been called up to the Dortmund first-team as a response to the club’s injury crisis, but even though they were without the likes of Marco Reus, Ilkay Gundogan and Mats Hummels, the 34-year-old never felt the result was in doubt against a lacklustre Arsenal, and even thought his side could have won by more.\n\n‘I never really felt that [it wasn’t going to be our day] because they never got a hold in the game,’ Kehl said.\n\n‘Apart from one minor chance in the first half, Arsenal never really offered much.\n\n‘I was very confident after we got the first goal and I knew we’d be going for it again in the second half.\n\n‘We could easily have won three or four-nil.’"
