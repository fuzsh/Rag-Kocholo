        "text": "Today‚Äôs exclusive transfer round-up from Bundesliga insider Christian Falk, featuring Bayern Munich, Chelsea Dortmund, Leverkusen, Newcastle and more.\n\nToday‚Äôs top stories:\n\nDortmund won‚Äôt budge on Bellingham fee but no offer from Real ‚Äì yet‚Ä¶\n\nCarlo Ancelotti‚Äôs immediate future could have consequences at Leverkusen\n\nAnd further updates on Jadon Sancho, Ivan Fresneda, Mason Mount, and more!\n\nBayern Munich\n\nBayern are still looking for a striker and most recently they had scouts and technical director, Marco Neppe, at the Aston Villa game. They won‚Äôt be making an offer for Ollie Watkins, however, because they‚Äôve decided to continue to focus on Eintracht Frankfurt‚Äôs Randal Kolo Muani as a priority as well as seeking clarification on Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane‚Äôs intentions. Napoli‚Äôs Victor Osimhen is no longer a target for the club so Man United will be happy, though the Red Devils have an issue if they want to position themselves alongside the Bavarians for Kolo Muani.\n\nIt takes a lot of money to sign forwards of that calibre, and that‚Äôs why it could be interesting if Manchester United are actually taken over by Sheikh Jassim‚Äôs group. I heard there are three players on the Sheikh‚Äôs wish list with Kylian Mbapp√© at the top, as well as Eduardo Camavinga and Kingsley Coman.\n\nI can tell you categorically that Bayern will not allow Coman to be sold, but the situation with Sadio Man√© and Serge Gnabry is different. After his issue with Leroy San√©, Man√© now has problems with his team-mates, and furthermore, his level of performance has disappointed Thomas Tuchel. Bayern are hoping for an offer from Chelsea ‚Äì offers from Premier League clubs are welcome in Munich (!) ‚Äì but there are no seriously interested parties at this stage. Any potential interest from Newcastle doesn‚Äôt appeal to Man√© either.\n\nThe club would never sign Lionel Messi despite his potential availability. As well as his high salary, it would destroy the dressing room, which is why Bayern said no when Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs management team offered him to the club.\n\nBayern are also looking for midfield players and I recently wrote about the interest in Mateo Kovacic. The availability of Mason Mount is certainly of interest to Tuchel also, as he knows both players well from his time in London. Nestory Irankunda, a 17-year-old central defender who currently plays for Adelaide United, will be signed as an investment for the future, and the club are also keeping an eye on Ajax star, Edson √Ålvarez, who is also on Dortmund‚Äôs list as a replacement for Jude Bellingham.\n\nüí¨ Do you think Mason Mount and Mateo Kovacic can be a success at Bayern? Let us know your thoughts!\n\nLeave a comment\n\nAnother player who could make money for Bayern is Yann Sommer, a goalkeeper that Manchester United have previously been interested in. After a serious injury, Manuel Neuer is now back in training and if he‚Äôs considered fit enough for the coming season, Sommer is likely to be sold.\n\nBayer Leverkusen\n\n‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt answer by then, we‚Äôll activate plan B,‚Äù Ednaldo Rodrigues, the Brazilian football federation‚Äôs president, announced.\n\nWhat does Leverkusen have to do with it? Very simply, if Ancelotti agrees to manage the Sele√ß√£o, Bayer will have cause to worry because Los Blancos have their former player, Xabi Alonso, in their sights as his successor and are following his every move. Leverkusen had planned to work with Alonso long-term, to see him develop their young talent and then reap the fruits of his labour.\n\nDuring his time at Leverkusen you can see that this former world-class player first stabilised the team defensively, then helped them dominate the pitch and now lets them attack with pace and technique. Players like Florian Wirtz (who wants to stay for another season at Leverkusen), Jeremie Frimpong (a Manchester United target) and Moussa Diaby (a target for Newcastle) have all developed brilliant under Alonso which is why they are the focus of those Premier League clubs.\n\nFor Real‚Äôs president, Florentino P√©rez, Alonso is the ideal solution. Within the club, their former goalscorer Ra√∫l is considered the crown prince and next in line for the Santiago Bernab√©u hot-seat, however, P√©rez believes that Alonso has developed much quicker and would prefer him to take over from Don Carlo if that scenario came to pass.\n\nJude Bellingham\n\nI heard that Bellingham imagined playing for Liverpool for a few years before making the move to Real Madrid. That was the career plan but Liverpool didn‚Äôt have the money for this deal. Bellingham has always thought highly of Los Blancos, and the talks with the Spaniards convinced him to move there, dissuading him from moving back to England in the process. Those responsible at Real are planning a visit to Dortmund, whilst Mark Bellingham, who manages his son‚Äôs career as director of his own company, ‚ÄòBelloBall LTD,‚Äô definitely wants to finalise things this summer. It concerns high commission payments and the background to this is FIFA‚Äôs new statute, which is due to come into force on October 1. It will mean that only licensed player agents can issue invoices and they would only receive a share of three percent commission from the club and three percent from the player, based on their salary. The FIFA decision also applies to family members.\n\nIn the case of a transfer after this summer, Mark Bellingham would either have to take the difficult license test or hire a licensed consultant, and the former is out of the question as he wasn‚Äôt registered for the spring course. In simple terms: Real Madrid have already budgeted an annual salary of ‚Ç¨20m (‚Ç¨100m over a five-year contract) for Bellingham, and would have to pay ‚Ç¨3m to the licensed consultant, of which only a small part, minus taxes and deductibles, goes to Mark Bellingham ‚Äì and which in turn would have to be taxed. According to the current rule, the commission is still at 10%, and would flow directly from the receiving club to Mark Bellingham and would only have to be taxed once. Neither Jude could wait for Liverpool in a sporting sense, nor it seems could his father Mark in a financial one.\n\nNow Dortmund are waiting for Real Madrid‚Äôs offer. They want a fixed amount of ‚Ç¨120m which could rise to ‚Ç¨150m, and as they‚Äôve shown in the past with Dembele, Sancho and others, they have precise expectations when it comes to transfer fees and they‚Äôll stick to them.\n\nEintracht Frankfurt\n\nAnother argument for Glasner to leave the club is that it‚Äôs going to be very difficult to keep his team together. For example, Randal Kolo Muani is being hunted by top clubs like Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich. With that potential departure in mind, 22-year-old Keito Nakamura is on the list as a potential replacement. At Austrian club Linz he scored 16 competitive goals this season and and assisted eight more. If Eintracht are able to get the ‚Ç¨120m for Kolo Muani that they desire, then the fee for Nakamura would be easy to pay. William Pacho (‚Ç¨9m from Antwerp) and Omar Marmoush (free from Wolfsburg) have already been signed by the club too.\n\nüí¨ Julian Nagelsmann or Oliver Glasner? Who is the perfect option for Tottenham Hotspur? Let us know below!\n\nLeave a comment\n\nDaichi Kamada and Evan Ndicka will most likely leave Eintracht on free transfers. Kamada should go to Benfica though Ndicka‚Äôs potential destination is unknown at present. Talks with Markus Kr√∂sche are now pending for Ndicka and it‚Äôs expected that Eintracht will withdraw their contract offer, just as they did previously with Kamada.\n\nLast summer, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle were close to midfielder Djibril Sow, but this time around it‚Äôs West Ham doing the chasing. The Swiss star has been watched several times by the east Londoners, most recently in Dortmund by chief scout Rob Newman himself. The Hammers had already inquired about Sow in the winter window, but at that time sports director Kr√∂sche put a stop to it. Eintracht are now ready to talk, and would let Sow leave for ‚Ç¨15m.\n\nHe‚Äôs the engine room in midfield who loves to drive his team forward ‚Äì and he really wants to go to the Premier League. He joined Eintracht from Young Boys of Bern in the summer of 2019 for a fee of ‚Ç¨14m and has played 154 competitive games for the club so far. Capped 36 times by the Swiss national team, he has eight goals and 13 assists at international level. He won two league titles with Young Boys and last season‚Äôs Europa League success is the greatest of his career to date.\n\nIvan Fresneda\n\nIf Dortmund do want to bring the player to the Bundesliga, in order to have enough money for him they‚Äôll need to sell Thomas Meunier. The 31-year-old Belgian has a contract until 2024 but is only third-choice full-back and is also very injury-prone. No wonder that sports director Sebastian Kehl would like to save on his annual ‚Ç¨7m salary, whilst also commanding a small fee for his services.\n\nJadon Sancho"
