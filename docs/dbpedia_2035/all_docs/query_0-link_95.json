        "text": "Christopher Nkunku has a “three- or four-year lease” on his apartment, his RB Leipzig coach Jesse Marsch revealed on Saturday night.\n\nAs he and Nkunku live in the same apartment block, Marsch obviously has inside knowledge of the Frenchman’s accommodation arrangements but whether the length of his lease really translates into a long-term commitment to stay in Saxony remains to be seen.\n\nWith 11 goals in 17 games in all competitions this season, Nkunku is looking like the third-best striker in the Bundesliga behind Robert Lewandowski and Erling Haaland. Saturday saw another man-of-the-match outing that will raise his profile invariably higher still.\n\nNkunku did everything in the pulsating 2-1 win over Borussia Dortmund, and he did everything so incredibly well. He was the scorer of the opening goal after 29 minutes and the provider of the winner, for Yussuf Poulsen, on 68 minutes, as well as being a constant irritant and the near-scorer of what would have been the no-contest goal of the season — a double Zidane turn past Dortmund defenders Mats Hummels and Marin Pongracic, followed by a shot that bounced agonisingly back off the post.\n\nBut, quelle surprise, curmudgeonly France coach Didier Deschamps is yet to be fully convinced by the 23-year-old.\n\n“He’s a future candidate. I can only encourage him to keep doing the good things he’s doing,” said Deschamps (before Nkunku’s eye-catching display against Dortmund) to explain the Paris Saint-Germain academy product’s latest absence from his squad.\n\nSo, Nkunku will stay put this international fortnight while France play Kazakhstan and Finland, but there’s little doubt he’s going places.\n\nFortunately, so are his club: after weeks of indifferent results and plenty of nervousness behind the scenes, Saturday’s win over Marco Rose’s injury-depleted visitors — comprehensive, well-deserved and indicative of Marsch’s willingness to listen — felt like a momentous occasion that will continue to reverberate in Leipzig and Dortmund throughout the next few weeks, for different reasons.\n\nBut perhaps it’s an even bigger deal that, maybe, it is already the end.\n\nLooking at the table, broadsheet Die Zeit joked — or did they? — that Dortmund’s defeat had “finished the title race in November”.\n\nThe four-point gap to league leaders Bayern Munich, who had fought off Freiburg’s insolent challenge to win 2-1 at home earlier that day, isn’t insurmountable. But the Bundesliga’s sole credible contenders for disrupting the Bavarians’ 10-in-a-row title procession were so far off Leipzig’s pace at the Red Bull Arena it’s hard seeing them keeping up with Bayern’s Autobahn football for too much longer.\n\nWell-coordinated pressing from Leipzig had Dortmund rendered comically helpless in possession, their build-up play reminiscent of kindergarten kids having a go at Jenga during nap-time: it was all a shaky, combustible, tired mess. “I’ve never seen Dortmund make so many mistakes playing out from the back,” Poulsen said. “At times, they simply passed it into touch.”\n\nFor what felt like the 254th time in recent years, Marco Reus professed himself angry about his team’s “lack of aggression and readiness” in the face of more committed opponents. Dortmund’s captain and scorer of their 53rd-minute equaliser went further still, however, criticising new coach Rose’s system with remarkable openness.\n\n“Five at the back doesn’t work for us at all, it needs to be said,” Reus told Sky Germany. “That way, we’re missing a man in midfield to press. Things were better when we changed to four at the back (in the second half).”\n\nReus was right about Dortmund being a little more lively after the break but blaming the formation for their inertia was a little too easy. Leipzig had been perfectly able to press with three/five at the back, for starters. Rose has also been forced into fielding three centre-backs in the absence of a recognised left-back, as they were all injured. Thorgan Hazard did a decent enough cosplay job after moving back into defence from wing-back for the second half but one can forgive Rose for not going with him in that unfamiliar role from the outset.\n\nIn addition, Dortmund’s collective inferiority was more down to a lack of individual quality than any strategic deficits. Five starters (Haaland, Emre Can, Raphael Guerreiro, Mahmoud Dahoud and Giovanni Reyna) plus a few more fringe players being out were a good few too many for them to compete with the team who can arguably call upon the deepest squad in the division, Bayern included.\n\nThe contrast couldn’t have been starker in the second half when Rose brought on youngsters Ansgar Knauff, 19, and 16-year-old Youssoufa Moukoko to try to freshen up their attack while Marsch unleashing Dani Olmo, Andre Silva and Emil Forsberg — three top-class, established internationals, from his bench.\n\nReus realised that he had perhaps gone too far with his comments and immediately sought out Rose to explain his thinking after doing the TV interview.\n\nThe two Marcos “talked things over”, Dortmund’s head of professional football Sebastian Kehl said to reporters on Sunday, adding “there are no problems”. But the abject manner of the defeat won’t have helped Rose in this delicate situation. Dortmund are still far away from being a balanced side 18 games into his reign, and up front, there’s simply not enough going on if Haaland is absent.\n\nFor Marsch, on the other hand, Leipzig’s best performance of the season couldn’t have come at a more opportune time.\n\nMany had questioned the American’s coaching after a series of poor showings. Even Marsch himself, who joined from Red Bull Salzburg to succeed Bayern-bound Julian Nagelsmann in the summer, admitted to having had doubts.\n\nAfter the win, the 48-year-old praised “the investment” of leading players who had apparently backed his vision of a more direct, transition-based approach. But that’s only half the story.\n\nLeipzig pressed much better than they had in recent weeks, with everyone working hard, but the biggest improvement has come in possession.\n\nIt was obvious against Dortmund that Marsch has smartly moderated his ideas to suit the characteristics of the squad far better. After a few failed attempts to make a back four work — Leipzig don’t have good enough full-backs for that — their new coach quietly reverted to the 3-4-3 of predecessor Nagelsmann.\n\nThe extra security without the ball apart, that formation brings out of the best of Leipzig’s army of hybrid No 10s/forwards. They are all technically gifted but none of them is a true winger, and their instinct is always to move inside. When width is provided by the wing-backs they’re allowed to play closer together and, crucially, more slowly, with more precision.\n\nThe lovely move preceding Poulsen’s winner was a case in point. Forsberg, Dominik Szoboszlai and Nkunku combined well to set up the Dane’s winner. “The three boys can play football,” Poulsen said, admiringly.\n\nLeipzig can play football, too, if they just take a breather from the frantic verticality of the opening months.\n\nStatsBomb data shows they only manage about three passes per sequence on average so far this season, whereas Bayern and the other teams topping Europe’s big leagues register four or more passes before losing the ball. That doesn’t seem a lot at first but adds up to a third less controlled attacking play over the course of many games.\n\nAlso, Leipzig are only the eighth-best in the 18-team Bundesliga in terms of stringing passes together. In the Premier League, they would be 13th. Simply put, it’s tough playing well when you can’t keep the ball long enough to get yourself into decent positions.\n\nSaturday’s win should set the blueprint for Leipzig, especially against more defensive sides.\n\nTo thrive, Marsch-ball needs to decelerate further.\n\nTalking points\n\nFreiburg pushed Bayern harder than any of the champions’ Champions League opponents have done this season, but the league leaders battled and played until the visitors were quelled.\n\nGoals in each half from Leon Goretzka and Robert Lewandowski inflicted the first defeat on Christian Streich’s perennial over-performers, as Janik Haberer’s strike in second-half stoppage-time came too late to turn the tide. Bayern were good but third-placed Freiburg’s performance was truly something to behold: their courage and application should serve as a shining example for much wealthier sides.\n\nBayern’s first full stadium since the pandemic hit was also interesting for bold statements off the pitch.\n\nUltras put up a banner that depicted chief executive Oliver Kahn and president Herbert Hainer as laundromat operators. “For money, we wash everything,” it read — effectively calling Bayern’s sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways sportswashing. More on this soon.\n\nElsewhere, Anthony Modeste scored twice, including an equaliser on 86 minutes, to rescue a point for Cologne against Union Berlin. The Frenchman celebrated by snatching coach Steffen Baumgart’s trademark Peaky Blinders-style hat, putting it on and doing a little dance. It was a classic case of “If the (flat) cap fits…”, even if Baumgart looked less than pleased.\n\nSections of the Bundesliga table can resemble a particularly stuffy bric-a-brac shop this season: stacked with bits that no one really needs or wants.\n\nPromoted Bochum, however, are a very welcome addition. The Ruhr region club were one of the league’s least-heralded side in the good old days but in 2021, their old-fashioned set-up is almost a novelty. They embody the rare essence of community-based, salt-of-the-earth, working-class-area football. They are proudly unglamorous, hard-working, unfussy and in it for the right reasons. And they can play a bit, too.\n\nOn Saturday, they beat Hoffenheim — their exact opposites — 2-0 to go into the international break in the reasonable comfort of 12th place. The game itself was thrilling as well. Bochum goalkeeper Manuel Riemann missed a penalty (!) and Milos Pantovic secured the three points with a 97th-minute winner from deep in his own half into an empty net.\n\nI didn’t think I’d ever write this but: we need more Bochums.\n\n(Top photo: Jan Woitas/picture alliance via Getty Images)"
