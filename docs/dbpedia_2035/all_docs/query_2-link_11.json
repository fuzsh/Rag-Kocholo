        "text": "The computational modeling of the cardiovascular mechanics represents a powerful tool for describing and understanding the heart function and diseases as well as predicting the effect of medical procedures.\n\nThe 3D-0D coupled closed-loop model of the heart and the vascular system delivers valuable quantities of interest for the physicians, such as blood pressure, blood flow and the contraction of the heart muscle. The heart muscle is modeled as a 3-dimensional nonlinear anisotropic elastic solid with an active material component, which simulates the cardiac contraction. The patient-specific geometry of the heart is extracted from medical imaging data such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic image resonance (MRI) scans through a segmentation process. The entire vascular system is modeled with a reduced-dimensional lumped-parameter model, where each of the arterial and venous compartments of the systemic and the pulmonary circulation is described with a specific multi-element windkessel model.\n\nA research project in collaboration with the German Heart Center Munich aims at building individualized Digital Twin models of adult patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) in order to predict the outcome of a pulmonary valve replacement. One of the most common late consequences after repair of ToF is pulmonary valve regurgitation. Significant pulmonary valve regurgitation progressively induces right ventricular dilation and dysfunction and increases consequently the risk of sudden death. While it has been shown that pulmonary valve replacement improves symptoms and functional status in these patients, the optimal timing and indications for the replacement intervention after repaired ToF are still debated. Therefore, a patient-specific Digital Twin supports the physicians in their decision-making by estimating the postoperative performance of the right ventricle. The cardiovascular Digital Twin is initially calibrated using preoperative catheter-based pressure measurements as well as MRI-based flow and geometry measurements.\n\nHirschvogel, M., Bassilious, M., Jagschies, L., Wildhirt, S.M., Gee, M.W.

DOI.\n\nChristian Bilas, Tahar Arjoune\n\nOne fundamental challenge in the computational modeling of personalized cardiovascular mechanics problems is the uncertainty that is ubiquitous in the patient-specific geometry, boundary conditions and material parameters of such models. If computational cardiovascular mechanics is to be used as a predictive simulation tool for diagnosis, research and decision making in clinical practice, robust and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods that deal with this lack of knowledge in a consistent manner are imperative. To that end, we advocate a probabilistic approach, where all available data obtained from measurements or via inverse analysis are specified in terms of probability distributions. We focus on the development and application of UQ methods that are feasible for large-scale problems and high-dimensional stochastic dimensions, in order to be able to infer information about the quantities of interest of the particular problem in the presence of uncertainty.\n\nBiehler, J., Gee, M.W., Wall, W.A.

In our group, we are interested in monolithic solvers for fluid-structure interaction problems, where a fluid and a solid domain exchange coupling information at their common coupling surface. Starting from well-established physics-based block preconditioners, that are known to accumulate the error at the coupling surface, we developed a novel hybrid preconditioner. It is based on an overlapping domain decomposition, that purposely exhibits subdomains that span across the fluid-structure interface. By performing cheap, but accurate subdomain solves in an Additive Schwarz manner in combination with the existing physics-based block preconditioners, the number of iterations of the linear solver as well as the total solution time could be reduced remarkably. Furthermore, scalability of the proposed methods has been demonstrated.\n\nMatthias Mayr, Michael Gee\n\nModel Order Reduction (MOR) is a technique under current research, which aims at a decrease of computational effort in large scale problems. The basic idea is to find a low dimensional subspace for the problem’s solution, while at the same time the quality of the solution shall be retained in comparison to a direct solution of the large scale problem. We aim at developing a MOR framework for finite element mechanical analysis of vascular mechanics problems. The reduction shall be performed for material as well as geometric parameters determining the mechanical properties as well as the geometry of the structure under consideration. The intended framework faces several complexities such as model nonlinearities, patient-specific geometries and hyper reduction.\n\nAlexander Schein\n\nTopology optimization aims at the optimal distribution of material within a defined problem setting, that minimizes a given cost function and satisfies various constraints. Often the objectives are contradicting each other, such that a trade-off is required. A prime example is to create a structure that is stiff as well as light at the same time. Another optimization objective are the so-called compliant mechanisms. Those are structures that deform elastically to transfer energy from an input to an output port.\n\nFor three-dimensional problems, espacially considering geometrically non-linear mechanics, the designs obtained by an optimization algorithm are often against human-intuition. But the computer generated structures achieve better performance measures, than the classical designed counterparts.\n\nThe group focuses on efficient, parallel algorithms that enable the design of complex structures for general geometric non-linear structural problem formulations.\n\nLukas Rinderer\n\nChronic narrowing of the iliac arteries (IA) and/or femoral arteries (FA) due to atherosclerosis, is a common cause of the peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD symptoms include restricted blood flow towards the lower limbs, which can lead to leg pain, skin ulcers, tissue death, and other severe complications. Atherosclerosis is commonly treated using angioplasty combined with stent placement. Unfortunately, interventions due to restenosis or stent failure are relatively frequent.\n\nStents within the IA/FA are especially prone to failure. In daily activities such as walking or sitting, the IA and FA undergo large deformations. This leads to bending, twisting and compression of the artery and the stent. The stent structure has to be flexible enough to follow these deformations, while exhibiting high radial forces to guarantee for sufficient blood flow. Current commercial stents are based on uniform patterns in terms of geometry and shape, which do not take into account large deformations. Commonly used superelastic nitinol stents exhibit excellent flexibility but lack required radial force properties. Therefore, a novel stent design, which allows for the necessary flexibility, but is radially strong, is desired.\n\nWe employ topology optimization (TO) to generate structures which satisfy the requirements of a stent within an IA/FA and additionally can be individualized to patient-specific geometries. TO is a established structural design method, able to generate non-intuitive designs for complex problem settings. The key idea is to achieve the flexibility by means of the geometric layout, rather than by material superelasticity and thus allow for non-superelastic material choices. To achieve this, the optimization model considers geometrically as well as materially nonlinear mechanics.\n\nLukas Rinderer\n\nDue to decreasing number of transplantable hearts and deficiencies in current heart assist device technologies, novel concepts of extravascular heart assistance are developed in close collaboration between AdjuCor GmbH and MHPC. The collaboration aims at minimizing vulnerable impact to the heart and optimizing design and functionality of a novel device by use of computational models. Therefore, computational models of the heart, the vascular system and a novel epicardial augmentation device are developed and their interplay computed on patient-specific cardiovascular conditions in order to predict the increase in heart work required to maintain vascular perfusion. Furthermore, models of oxygen transport and ventricular disease progression after myocardial infarction should help to gain further insights into the specific device operating parameters required to sustain cardiac regeneration.\n\nHirschvogel, M., Bassilious, M., Jagschies, L., Wildhirt, S.M., Gee, M.W.

More patients survive but suffer from a resulting heart insufficiency. At the same time, heart transplantations are limited to the amount of donor organs, which has been declining during the past decade. A promising technology are efficient cardiac assist devices. However, the wide range of patient individual requirements makes it challenging to design an appropriate device. Together with AdjuCor GmbH, we develop a 0D model of the driving unit of a novel VAD and couple it to a 3D patient-specific heart model. This allows us to iteratively optimize device and implant in order to meet the individual patient needs.\n\nRobert Wohlfarth\n\nAtherosclerosis precipitates sequelae such as angina, heart attack and stroke, among others, and therefore is heavily involved in the leading causes of death in the western world. During atherosclerotic lesion formation, leukocytes, fatty substances, cholesterol crystals, cellular waste, calcium, platelets and fibrinogen accumulate in and on the intima and media of arteries, resulting in arterial wall thickening and subsequently continuous narrowing of the vessel lumen. Atherosclerotic plaque may rupture and expose its thrombogenic contents to the blood stream, leading to massive local blood coagulation and formation of a thrombus. Such thrombosis may lead to local and/or distal obstruction of blood vessels and gives rise to a major part of acute coronary deaths worldwide. The mechanical impact from blood flow and pressure imposed on the artery wall during atherosclerosis progression, its consequences on plaque composition and inflammation as well as the process of lesion formation with its interplay with biomechanical conditions, however, remain to be conclusively addressed.\n\nIn this project, a multiscale and multidisciplinary approach to the mechanobiology of atherosclerosis is taken that is based on computational techniques and experimental calibration and verification as well as in vivo molecular imaging. The biological processes involved take place at the (sub)cellular length scale and will be assessed experimentally by histology. Based on the imaged 3D geometries, macroscopic computational fluid-solid interaction models with transport and diffusion of species and cells supply an understanding of the local mechanical conditions which can then be correlated to the biological findings. A computational microscopic biological model will be implemented in a stochastic cellular potts model which will be coupled to the macroscopic continuum representation of the region of interest in a multiscale framework. Imaging of several stenoses in mice as well as carefully designed in vitro experiments are applied to test the hyphotheses of the model, calibrate its behavior and evaluate its predictive capabilities.\n\nMoritz Thon, Almut Glinzer, Moritz Wildgruber, Alma Zernecke, Michael W.

All these disciplines deal with highly dynamic problems, where a stable and accurate time integration is crucial in order to run useful simulations. The computational efficiency of the applied algorithms is of high interest, especially when it comes to real applications.\n\nFor some numerically very challenging FSI problems we could show that monolithic coupling schemes outperform partitioned approaches. The efficiency of the monolithic scheme is based on newly developed iterative solvers for the coupled linear system of equations.\n\nWe aim at developing time integration strategies for FSI problems with good stability, accuracy and efficiency properties. Implicit schemes seem to be appropriate for this type of problem. In order to gain more efficiency and reduce the computational costs, adaptive time stepping procedures are very promising, especially when large scale nonlinear problems are in the focus of interest.\n\nMayr, M., Klöppel, T., Wall, W.A., Gee, M.W.

In clinical practice, the classification between stable and rupture-prone AAAs is done according to one geometrical feature, i.e. the maximum diameter, a criterion that is well established, but proven to be not sufficiently accurate for rupture risk prediction. This project aims therefore at evaluating the rupture risk based on the whole patient-specific AAA abluminal surface. The groupwise statistics for the classification require the estimation of an averaged geometry, a template, of both the symptomatic/ known ruptured (rupture-prone) and asymptomatic AAA cohort found in the exemplary database. Then, each template is mapped to every AAA surface of both cohorts. The mapping properties are used for the classification and for understanding the shape variability of each cohort.\n\nMarina Bassilious\n\nEndovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a well-established technique to prevent rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). In this technology, a stent-graft (SG) is deployed inside the AAA to exclude the aneurysm sac from the main blood flow. However, EVAR involves some unfavorable complications such as endoleaks or SG migration. Such complications, resulting from wrong placement of the SG or incompatibility of SG design and AAA geometry, are difficult to predict. We aim at developing a predictive tool for the selection and sizing process of SGs depending on the patient-specific AAA geometry. A further objective of the predictive tool is a better risk assessment of the intervention indicating potential SG related complications already in the preoperative planning phase. The predictive, numerical tool based on finite element analysis requires the combination of various complex simulation components, such as contact mechanics between AAA and SG, mechanobiology of AAA, morphing strategies for the positioning of the SG and material modeling of the superelastic behavior of nitinol.\n\nHemmler, A., Lutz, B., Reeps, C., Kalender, G., Gee, M.W.

Gee, Christian Reeps, Brigitta Lutz, Günay Kalender\n\nIn many fields of our research there is a desperate need for fast and efficient solvers. Multigrid Methods are among the best methods for solving symmetric positive definite systems. However, for many applications (CFD, Transport) convective phenomena play an important role and may dominate the whole process. Convective terms result in nonsymmetric linear systems that often turn out to be very challenging for iterative solving methods. We develop a new framework for algebraic multigrid preconditioners that is also appropriate for these kind of nonsymmetric systems. Furthermore it provides flexibility that allows the continued development of robust AMG solvers.\n\nInspired by Petrov-Galerkin smoothed aggregation methods we use different Galerkin projections for the prolongation and restriction operators. The key idea for our transfer operators is connected to approximating a Schur complement. With special Galerkin projections we preserve important low-frequency error components and limit the sparsity pattern of the multigrid transfer operators.\n\nWiesner, T., Tuminaro, R.S., Wall, W.A., Gee, M.W.

Gee, Tobias Wiesner\n\nImage registration plays a key role in a broad variety of clinical and industrial applications whenever information is encoded by images. Especially in clinical applications the acquisition of information is highly based on imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) or Ultrasound. E.g. the study and classification of processes such as growth & remodelling of arteries, the cardiac motion of the beating heart or the deformation of the lung during respiration highly rely on deformation information encoded by follow-up CT-scans or motion-MRT respectively.\n\nHowever the bijective characteristic of a transformation, i.e. the unique and invertible mapping of material particles, is not captured by the above mentioned clinical imaging techniques. Thus image registration for deformation estimation constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem which is in need of regularization strategies. We focus on the application of “measurements” from image registration in material parameter estimation for finite element models.\n\nMarina Bassilious, Sebastian Kehl\n\nMaterial parameters for patient specific numerical models are subject to high inter-patient variability as well as to strong intra-patient spatial heterogeneity. Further it’s not possible to measure material parameters directly by means of non-invasive techniques. Thus accurate spatial representations of material parameters for the application in biomechanical models still pose a big challenge.\n\nInverse analysis methods provide a solution by trying to estimate material parameters according to a given reference solution, i.e. “measurements”. These measurements can be obtained non-invasively, e.g. by extracting deformation information from images using image registration techniques. Therefore these measurements are not only subject to noise but also subject to systematic sources of errors due to regularization in the image registration. Consequently the quality of the final estimation of material parameters highly depends on the quality of the measurements.\n\nOur interest is on the development of efficient inverse methods to accurately estimate patient specific parameter distributions. Special focus is on methods to avoid the error propagation introduced by errors in the measurements.\n\nKehl, S., Gee, M.W.
