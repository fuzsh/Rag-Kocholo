There’s nothing better than becoming a World Champion and he can be extremely proud of that,” said Kehl on Monday evening as the two BVB players attended a charity dinner for “Roter Keil” against child prostitution.\n\nGermany international Roman Weidenfeller spoke about particular moments in his career, winning the World Cup with Germany in 2014, the exciting Bundesliga finale for BVB as they battle for a place in the Europa League against Werder Bremen on Saturday (15:30 CEST) and the DFB Cup final on 30th May (20:00 CEST) in Berlin against VfL Wolfsburg.\n\nRoman Weidenfeller on…\n\n…the Bundesliga finale against Werder Bremen: I can’t imagine that we would throw it away. We have every possibility playing at home. We have had a good second half to the season and now we have the chance to pick up three points at home, which would mean we would qualify for the Europa League. I’m optimistic that we can achieve our goal.\n\n…the DFB Cup final: It might sound like a cliché but we are taking things a week at a time. That will be the same for the final in Berlin. There is no point doing anything other than that. We’ll come up against a brilliant team in Berlin and we saw that in Wolfsburg at the weekend. We’ll have to give our all in the final.\n\n…whether the 2-1 loss in Wolfsburg was planned to give them a false sense of security ahead of the final: We honestly didn’t plan to do that. But I can ensure that we’ll give our all again in the final and put ourselves in a different position. The cup final Berlin is special for everyone involved. We’ll bring together our strengths and will give our all.\n\n…the possibility of winning the DFB Cup after a stuttering season: If we manage to win the cup then you have to say that it’s been a good season and we’ll have won a title. We’ll then take pride and dignity into our summer break. We want to be celebrating on 30th May as a team and then travel to celebrate in Borsigplatz (Dortmund) the next day.\n\n…BVB without manager Jürgen Klopp: We all know that Jürgen Klopp fits in at Dortmund like a hand in a glove. We have had seven great, glorious years together. Now we have to rebuild for the club. Thomas Tuchel will bring a new input to the team. Everyone will have to adjust and it will be a challenge, especially to sit down and set out new aims and to achieve them.\n\n... the 2014 World Cup win in Brazil: It was something that even in your wildest dreams you could never imagine. Brazil was obviously very special I never would have thought that I was be travelling there with the national team, to be there for the whole tournament and then to hold the World Cup trophy afterwards. It was extraordinary. Even as a kid I would never have dared to dream of achieving so much.\n\n... the significance of the win: Even though I didn’t play, I was still part of the team. We did a lot to make sure we worked well as a team, that was our strength. The team spirit at our training camp (Campo Bahia) was incredible, credit to the DFB for finding this place before hand. Finally, the team obviously did their bit to bring the trophy home.\n\n... your potential dreams for the final years of your career: People always have dreams, but they’re never so fixed that I would talk about them. We’ll have to wait and see what the club does next year, with regards to the goalkeeper position. In any case, I still have a year left on my contract. Because of that, I can pretty confidently assume that I will continue to wear yellow and black. If there are any surprises, we will see where the road will take me.\n\n... his highlights after 13 years at Dortmund: My first championship win with BVB in 2011 was very special for me personally. It’s always a highlight to walk out into a sold out stadium and play in front of these amazing fans, and then to go on and win the league at home as well. The volume was especially high that year in the stadium, we couldn’t even understand our own words. The was a special moment.\n\n... your involvement \"guardian angel\" for the “Roten Keil”: It’s a really great role. It allows me to give something back and do something good for the kids. We are able to raise money to create new opportunities to sponsor kindergartens and schools in Sri Lanka or Rwanda.\n\ncreated by mmc/jm\n\nRoman Weidenfeller became a World Champion in 2014, whilst his Dortmund teammate Sebastian Kehl was a runner-up back in 2002.
