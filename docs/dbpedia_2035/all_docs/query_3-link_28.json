We have so many important games ahead of us, and my full concentration is on them. I don't know what will happen in the summer yet. There will surely be several options. What I can say is that I feel very comfortable in Dortmund and really enjoy being here at BVB. And I also feel that I am very welcome here.\"\n\nMaatsen on reports which suggests he has conveyed a wish to Chelsea bosses that he doesn't want to return next season: \"No, I haven't done that. At this stage of my career, my main focus is on playing a lot. That's the most important thing for me. I have a contract with Chelsea; it's a big club. As I said, I'm not thinking about my future right now. We'll see what happens.\" [@RNBVB] Maatsen on the the biggest differences between the Bundesliga and the Premier League: \"The games in the Premier League are even faster than those in the Bundesliga. Additionally, the schedule is even more packed. While the Bundesliga is similar in this regard, there is a bit more time to rest after matches and to prepare for the upcoming game with a bit more time. Even though the competitions in Germany are also demanding, I would say the intensity in England is a bit higher.\"\n\nSep 9, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 22 tweets ‚Ä¢ 15 min read\n\nüßµ‚ÄúAt 27, you are at the best age to be a leader. Wouldn't you like to become BVB captain?‚Äù\n\nBrandt: ‚ÄúI don't know if I'm the prototype for that. I come from the north, we are a little more reserved. I also define the role differently. It would be fatal if only the captain always took responsibility. He can't handle everything alone. I see the captain as a member of the team council, of which I am also a member. And I see it this way: everyone on this committee has to lead the way. I enjoy doing this too. And it's just as important that others speak their minds. I also have no problem with Marius Wolf complaining to me because I played crap.‚Äù [RN]\n\n‚ÄúHow does Emre Can perform as captain from your perspective?‚Äù\n\nBrandt: ‚ÄúI think Emre is a very good captain. He is someone who is driven by great ambition in every training session. He enjoys great respect in the team.‚Äù\n\nBrandt on his increased sense of responsibility: ‚ÄúYes. Maybe I too have grown up. At least that's what my old colleagues tell me. Emre Can, who has known me since I was 17, recently said: Why are you like this now? You used to talk completely differently!' For some it happens faster as the ripening process progresses, for me it took a little longer (laughs).‚Äù\n\nMay 24, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 47 tweets ‚Ä¢ 11 min read\n\nSebastien Haller on whether he has been to Borsigplatz often: \"I sometimes drive across Borsigplatz in my car. But I really want to see this square full of people. There are still 90 minutes left, the last step must follow now!\" Haller on whether Terzic has shown him the pictures of 2011-12 championships: \"Of course, I've already seen a few video clips from title parties. Pictures like this give me an extra boost. We all really want to be part of such a special club moment.\"\n\nMay 23, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 4 tweets ‚Ä¢ 2 min read\n\nMarco Reus on the fans: \"I can't put it into words. I don't know how many supporters were here today. Maybe a bit more than 10k. Difficult to put into words really. We need the fans too, there's no question about that. Without them we are only worth half.\" Reus: \"I don't have to tell you what's going to be going on next Saturday. Everyone will probably be on the South Stand waiting the day before. I am positive and I hope we get it done.\"\n\nMay 22, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 11 tweets ‚Ä¢ 3 min read\n\nHans Joachim Watzke about the joy of a possible championship title for Marco Reus: \"There's no question that he can set a milestone with that. But at the end of the day I'm happy for every player. Becoming German champion with Borussia Dortmund is a different category.\" [Sky] Watzke about his lucky jumper: \"We played against Augsburg in the first half of the season, it was cold, I was wearing this sweater and then there was this spectacular 4: 3. Then I said: 'I'll leave it on until we have our first game lost in the Bundesliga.'\"\n\nMay 22, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 17 tweets ‚Ä¢ 6 min read\n\nMarius Wolf on Haller: \"Of course it's incredible - I played with him in Frankfurt, and I fought for BVB to sign him. Obviously it was shit Situation for him at first, so I'm even happier that things are now going so well for him.\" Wolf: \"We shouldn't forget that he scored when he came back during the winter break, and obviously people immediately had high expectations, but he needed time after such a long time out - everyone does.\"\n\nMay 21, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 5 tweets ‚Ä¢ 2 min read\n\nSebastian Kehl: \"I don't want to put the brakes on euphoria. We took an important step today. In the end we deserved to win. We will absorb the euphoria and take it with us. We need another 90 minutes in our stadium with the power that we've shown in recent weeks.\" Kehl: \"Now we can't let that take us anymore. I'm really happy for the team. They coped very, very well. We had a difficult first series. Now we have used the favor. Yesterday's result obviously plays into our hands. But it wasn't easy, Augsburg were very aggressive.\"\n\nMay 21, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 4 tweets ‚Ä¢ 2 min read\n\nSebastien Haller: \"It was unbelievable. If someone had told me six months ago that I would be in this position, I would not have believed it. It's a great opportunity now, not only for me but also for the team. We have a good opportunity to achieve something big. I'm just proud.\" Haller on the game: \"Everyone knew that we missed a few chances. Today we stayed patient and positive. It worked. I'm happy and proud of the team. We have to stay with us, keep working so hard. It's not magic, it's a lot of work, it's a lot of effort, running and positivity.\"\n\nMay 21, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 8 tweets ‚Ä¢ 2 min read\n\nEdin Terzic about the possible title win: ‚ÄúThere is still this one step that we want to take together. After that we allow all emotions, whether it‚Äôs pride or euphoria. We‚Äôre not done yet. The season will be over in seven days.\" Terzic: \"Then the boys - they all earn good money - can buy whatever they want again: the next car, the next house, the next vacation - but you can't buy these moments Bring home to Dortmund.\"\n\nMay 21, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 4 tweets ‚Ä¢ 1 min read\n\nGregor Kobel on the win: \"It was a very emotional game. It was a very important win. We are now in pole position. We have our job to do now. Today there was a lot of pressure on the boiler. But the work is not done yet. The belief is huge.\" Kobel: \"We've done very well over 33 games, now we're missing a game. This is very important, we are aware of that. We do everything the same as usual. There's a lot of pressure, so we don't do crazy things.\"\n\nMay 17, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 4 tweets ‚Ä¢ 2 min read\n\nJ√ºrgen Klopp on the Bundesliga champions: \"It's probably no secret that I want BVB to be champions. Because what you experience then, you never forget: with the shell around the Borsigplatz, that's still one of the really big highlights of my career.\" Klopp: \"I would like to give that to the fans, club, coach and players this year. I believe in it: the boys can do it. The chance is great, they will seize it! I'll keep my fingers crossed in front of the Liverpool TV. After 11 years, the shell simply belongs back in Dortmund!‚Äù\n\nMay 17, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 4 tweets ‚Ä¢ 2 min read\n\nLothar Matth√§us via his column: \"I believe that both Bayern and Dortmund will draw at the weekend and that the decision will be made on the last day of the game, but then Bayern will get the trophy.\" Matth√§us: \"It was very unfortunate for Borussia Dortmund that Leipzig won against Werder Bremen at the last second and can therefore appear much more relaxed at Bayern and does not necessarily have to win. Bayern's remaining program is more difficult but my master tip remains.\"\n\nMay 16, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 15 tweets ‚Ä¢ 6 min read\n\nNiklas S√ºle on the pressure of the current situation: \"I feel positive pressure. When you're playing for the German championship and you've worked your way through the whole year, it must be a nice feeling.\" S√ºle: \"And we're in a good mood, we've been working hard for this opportunity for weeks. We still have eleven days together - and we want to crown the season. We've got two tough games ahead of us, but we'll do everything we can to become German champions.\"\n\nMay 12, 2023 ‚Ä¢ 25 tweets ‚Ä¢ 9 min read\n\nNico Schlotterbeck on the good run in home games: \"We'll keep it going. I'm confident. I think the stadium makes it tough for opposing teams when they come to Dortmund. There's a level of respect, and after Bayern lost at Mainz, you saw the energy when we were warming up.\" Schlotterbeck: \"The fans transmit that energy to us, and here in Dortmund, we get that extra 3-4% in our head, and we know nothing bad will happen today. No matter what our opponents do, we decide how the game goes. If we play well, we'll win.\""
