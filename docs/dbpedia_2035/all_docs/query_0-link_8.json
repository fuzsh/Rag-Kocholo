        "text": "Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl expressed confidence on Sunday that the team can achieve Champions League qualification via a top four finish in the Bundesliga despite a tough schedule in the final 10 matches.\n\nDortmund in fourth still have to play the top three of Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern and VfB Stuttgart, plus RB Leipzig who are one point behind them in fifth.\n\nLast season's runners-up Dortmund are going through an inconsistent season but a 2-0 victory Saturday at Union Berlin eased the pressure a little bit on the team and coach Edin Terzic.\n\nKehl told broadcasters Sport1 that \"I believe in the team\" and \"am convinced that this team will finish in the top four.\"\n\n\"We have the opportunity to show in these games that there is more to the team. I expect us to deliver,\" he added in reference to the matches against the top teams.\n\n\"For us, it's all about achieving direct qualification for the Champions League. In Stuttgart, Leipzig and [sixth placed] Frankfurt, we have teams around us that look very stable.\"\n\nKehl admitted that the season is not going according to plan, mainly in the Bundesliga while in the Champions League they won a tough group and drew 1-1 at PSV Eindhoven in their last 16 first leg game.\n\n\"There's no-one here who is glossing over the situation. I'm not satisfied with the performances and the situation in the table,\" he said.\n\n\"Every player can play better football. It's strange when I get through a great group in the Champions League and then experience such fluctuations in the Bundesliga.\"\n\nKehl also backed Terzic, saying: \"It's clear that there was a bit of unrest. But we still believe that we will be successful in this constellation. We are not having a coaching discussion.\""
