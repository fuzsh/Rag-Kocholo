Speaking exclusively to Kicker, Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl discussed the appointment of Edin Terzić as head coach and why the former interim is the right person for the role.

“Edin brings high quality, both professionally and personally,” said Kehl. “He’s good at communication and manages to get the boys excited and involved. He has a high degree of emotionality, will and willingness to work hard.

“In addition, despite his age, he has already gained a lot of experience in various roles, here at the club but also in other countries.”

Born on the outskirts of Dortmund, Terzić grew up in Menden, around 30 kilometres from the Westfalenstadion. The 39-year-old is BVB through-and-through and was appointed as a successor to Marco Rose in the summer after just one season in charge.

“He has a huge identification with the city, the region and the people,” added Kehl.

“He’s authentic, that’s the important thing. It usually doesn’t happen that the coach of a big club comes from the vicinity of your own city. People are looking forward to that.”

Terzić has brought in the well-respected Peter Hermann as assistant coach. Kehl added: “We’re very happy to have Peter Hermann on the coaching staff. He has a lot of experience, brings a different perspective on football, has a good knowledge of human nature and knows exactly how a group works in order to be successful in the end.”
