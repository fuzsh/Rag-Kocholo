        "text": "Inukai Tsuyoshi (born May 5, 1855, Okayama, Japan—died May 15, 1932, Tokyo) was a Japanese politician and prime minister whose assassination marked the end of party participation in the Japanese government in the period preceding World War II.\n\nOf samurai origin, Inukai began his career as a reporter. He became minister of education in 1898 and then founded a new political party, the Constitutional National Party (Rikken Kokumintō). In 1913 he headed a popular movement against the autocratic and unpopular government of the former army general Katsura Tarō. As a result of Inukai’s efforts, Katsura was forced to resign, opening the way for the gradual development of a cabinet selected by the majority party in the Diet (Japanese parliament).\n\nIn 1922 Inukai organized another new party, the Reform Club (Kakushin Kurabu), and the following year he again joined the cabinet, this time as minister of communications. In 1924, however, he destroyed this coalition government when he left it to join the Friends of Constitutional Government (Rikken Seiyūkai), the largest party in Japan; and in 1929 he became president of that party.\n\nIn 1931 Japanese troops occupied the Chinese provinces of Manchuria (Northeast Provinces), the first step in the process that led to the Pacific conflict of World War II. When the cabinet of Wakatsuki Reijirō fell, Inukai was able to organize a cabinet of his own, becoming prime minister in December 1931. His government immediately took the country off the gold standard and began efforts to reflate the economy."
