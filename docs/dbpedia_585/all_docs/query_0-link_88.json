WARD AND HAJIME WATANABE ANN ARBOR/THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN PRESS/ 1961 PUBLISHED FOR THE CENTER FOR JAPANESE STUDIES\n\nPage IV Copyright ~ by The University of Michigan 1961 All rights reserved Published in the United States of America by The University of Michigan Press and simultaneously in Toronto, Canada, by Ambassador Books Limited Manufactured in the United States of America\n\nEditor's Foreword\n\npp. v-vi\n\nPage V EDITOR'S FOREWORD ON THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERIES The Bibliographical Series of the Center for Japanese Studies has for its main purpose the listing and evaluating of the major Japanese works pertaining to the humanities and social sciences, particularly as they deal with Japan and the areas immediately adjacent to Japan. It is assumed that Western materials pertaining to Japan are adequately covered in the bibliographies of Pages, von Wenckstern, Nachod, Praesent-Haenisch, Pritchard, Gaskill, the annual bibliographies of the Association for Asian Studies (formerly the Far Eastern Association), etc., and that Westerr specialists in the several fields will know how to get at the Western materials in their respective fields, The bibliographies in the present series are intended to serve as an introduction to the native research materials in the several disciplines and hence as at aid to research for teachers and students. In each case an attempt has been made to desciribe or to evaluate each work that is listed, or at least to justify the inclusion of each item. Scholars and librarians will perhaps find that the several bibliographies in this series will serve as useful guides to buying programs which they may wish to initiate. The bibliographies are selective. Each item listed is believed to be of some value or interest to the scholarly user. In those cases in which it has been impossible to examine a book or article of known value, it still is included. A book or article is thus included if it is written by a competent scholar, if it is included in a bibliography which is itself competently compiled, if it appears to treat its subject matter in detail and with an approach to completeness, if it is frequently quoted, if it is well reviewed, or if it is referred to as being authoritative. Wherever possible, notes as to why an item seems to be of value have been given. The scope of each bibliography is defined by the compiler or compilers in their introductions, but in general each of the bibliographies lists (a) important source materials, and (b) secondary sources dating from a fixed date in the recent past, as, for instance, the Meiji Restoration, 1900, 1910, etc. Although the materials in most cases deal with the Japanese islands, each compiler has set the limits of the geographical area which his materials cover. In certain cases expansion into areas that lie outside Japan appears to be justified by the fact that Japanese research has been the dominant research for these areas. Hence one or more of the bibliographies will cover Japanese materials on Formosa, Korea, Manchuria, and the Mandated Islands. The format is uniform within each volume. In general the name of each author or compiler is given both in romanization and characters. The surnames are given first and the given names next, as the practice is in Japan. The names of corporate authors, such as government offices, are given in romanization and characters; they are then translated. The title of each book or article is given in romanization and characters; it is then translated. The place of publication and the name of the publisher are given in romanization alone, but a separate listing within each bibliography gathers together the names of the publishers, with the characters used in writing their names. This listing is found as an appendix in each volume. 1. Long a, o, and u are indicated by macrons over the vowels. 2. Only the first letters of initial words and proper nouns are capitalized. 3. In the bibliographical data, the compilers have given both the edition and the printing of the work cited. Significant textual variations sometimes occur between different printings of the same edition of a given work. 4. When dealing with an item composed of one volume, complete pagination is generally given for that volume, including all separately paged sections. If any title is in more than one volume, only the total number of volumes is given, without paging. 5. In the event that the item cited happens to be part of a series or collection, the compilers have given in brackets introduced by an equals sign the title, characters, and translated title of that series or collection and the number of the volume concerned. 6. Works such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, yearbooks, series, and collections are cited by title; the name of the editor or compiler, in romanization and characters, is usually given after the title. 7. In the case of articles found in journals, quotation marks surround the Japanese title, characters, and translated title. 8. Abbreviations are explained in lists, if necessary. 9. If any volume of a journal is continuously paged, number and month may be omitted. If it has both continuous volume pagination and separate pagination for each issue, only the volume, year, and the continuous volume pagination may be given. If more than one volume appears in any single year, and each is separately and continuously paged, the procedure has been to give the volume, inclusive months of the issues in the volume, year, and continuous volume pagination (the last where easilyascertainable). 10. If an article comprises a chapter or a section of a book which is a compilation of articles by a number of authors, this fact is shown by inserting the word \"in\" between the title of the article and the compilation in which it is found. Following the \"in,\" a complete citation of the book in question is given. 11. All descriptions, evaluations, criticisms, and comments pertaining to a volume or article follow the citations in separate, indented paragraphs. 12. A list of the standard professional journals is given whenever found to be convenient. v\n\nPage VI These remarks revise in a few particulars the Editor's Foreword appearing in numbers 1-6 of the present Bibliographical Series. When the Series was begun in 1950, it was hoped to indicate for each of the items listed in each bibliography, the American libraries which own it. However, Far Eastern libraries in the United States have recently made such substantial additions to their Japanese collections that it is no longer possible or necessary to show the location of each item. The key libraries today possess union catalogues that indicate where particular volumes may be found. Joseph K. Yamagiwa vi\n\nAuthor's Introduction\n\npp. vii-viii\n\nPage VII AUTHORS' INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION It has now been upwards of ten years since the publication of the first edition of this work in 1950. The earlier edition has been out-of-print for some five years and its contents and coverage seriously out-of-date for at least as long. During this period the number of American scholars and students making professional use of Japanese-language materials has been constantly expanding, and the size and quality of the collections of such works held by American libraries have increased astronomically. For an extremely interesting and useful analysis of the scope, strengths, and distribution of major Japanese-language collections in the libraries of this country, it is possible to point to Dr. G. R. Nunn and Tsuen-hsuin Tsien's \"Far Eastern Resources in American Libraries,\" The Library Quarterly, vol. XXIX, no. 1 (January 1959), pp. 27-42. Of even greater importance has been the resumption of professional contacts and work in Japan by American scholars since the lifting of the ban upon such travel by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers early in 1950. This has made available once more the vast resources of Japan's splendid libraries and research collections. Under these circumstances there seemed to be reason for a new edition focused primarily upon an attempt to provide that coverage of postwar publications in the field of political science which was impossible in the first edition. The present work was compiled under far more favorable circumstances than was the earlier one. The first edition suffered from a variety of limitations and problems described in its Introduction. Among these was the fact that it marked a pioneering attempt which, perforce, stood alone in the field without model and without support. Since 1950, however, the University of Michigan's Center for Japanese Studies has published some seven additional volumes in its Bibliographical Series. This has substantially simplified the problems of compiling the present revised edition. It has not only been possible to profit from the cumulative experience involved, but also to eliminate or reduce the attention paid to certain categories of general reference material which are more properly or better treated in other volumes of the series. This is particularly true with respect to Professor John W. Hall's admirable Japanese history: a guide to Japanese reference and research materials (Ann Arbor, 1954), to which the present volume is closely related. Again, it has been possible to do most of the research upon which the present edition is based under optimal circumstances in several of Japan's finest libraries, rather than relying upon the less definitive collections available in this country. The most important advantages have come from collaboration with a Japanese co-author, Professor Watanabe Hajime of Ritsumeikan University's Law Department. The bulk of the work done in Japan was carried out by Professor Watanabe and a group of very able Japanese assistants. The result has been, both authors hope, a work not only more accurate, complete, and broadly useful than would otherwise have been possible, but also a demonstration of a type of international scholarly cooperation capable of fruitful extension along a variety of other lines. A few words should be said to make clear the limits of what the present work attempts to do: 1. It is a guide to and annotated bibliography of Japanese reference and research materials in the field of political science. It includes 1,759 entries, of which 1,158 (66%) are new and did not appear in the first edition. The great majority of entries are annotated, some at considerable length. 2. It is confined largely, although not exclusively, to works written in Japanese. A few Western-language books or essays, primarily bibliographies, treating relevant Japanese literature have also been included. The bibliography of Western-language materials on Japan is regarded as a separate problem, which is, moreover, relatively well covered in a variety of sources readily available to interested students. 3. The phrase \"reference and research materials in the field of political science\" has been very broadly interpreted. The reader will encounter numerous entries of primary interest to historians, economists, sociologists, cultural anthropologists, or other social scientists. These also contain material of great interest to many political scientists. The boundaries between the social science disciplines are both vague and shifting, and the authors were reluctant to omit on such grounds any reference or research materials which seemed in their judgment of substantial political relevance or value. In practice, such decisions were tempered by the fact that the present work stands as but one of a series of bibliographies which includes volumes on most of the other social sciences, and by a realization of the ridiculousness of any pretense to completeness of coverage. It was hoped only to produce a work which would suffice interested political scientists for average or basic working purposes and might save substantial amounts of their time. It has also been quite difficult in practice to define with precision the boundaries which divide \"reference and research materials\" from items of more ephemeral or popular character. An attempt has been made to exclude the latter, but judgments are bound to differ on this score. The question is further complicated by variant definitions in Japan of the scope, nature, and objectives of political science as a discipline, and consequent differences in the focus, level, and aims of professional scholarship. 4. In point of time, the present volume is limited, with few exceptions, to titles which treat political science subjects and developments in Japan since the Meiji Restoration (1868). In practice, there is a tendency for coverage to concentrate at both ends of this time spectrum. Prior to 1945 in particular, there was in the political science field a marked clustering of scholarly attention and writing on developments occurring during the Meiji Period (1868-1912). Similarly, since the enforcement of the constitution in 1947 and the numerous and far-reaching political and other changes attendant upon this and the related reform projects sponsored by the Allied Occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1952, there has been a great efflorescence of writing upon contemporary and very recent developments. Actually, the focus of the present volume has been primarily upon the results of post-1945 Japanese scholarship. This is not to discount the merits of prewar scholarship. As a matter of fact a very sizable number vii\n\nPage VIII A GUIDE TO JAPANESE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH MATERIALS IN THE FIELD OF POLITICAL SCIENCE of such entries have been retained from the earlier edition. But obviously the present generation of Japanese scholars has not only benefited from the greater professional freedom in postwar times, but has also built and improved upon the products of prewar scholarship in many cases and ways. The most definitive and useful works are thus often those written since 1945, especially in the political field. In this connection, it should be noted that where the term \"postwar is used in the following text without further specification, it refers to the period since August, 1945. The basic research upon which this edition rests was carried out in Japan —largely in Kyoto and Tokyo — from 1956 to 1958, and supplemented by work in the collections of the University of Michigan. In general the cutoff date for entries is the end of 1958. A few outstanding items published in 1959 have also been included. 5. Practical considerations of time and expense have obliged the authors to limit their coverage to books. This has meant that all save a very few articles and special numbers of professional journals have had to be excluded from the following lists. This decision was made with great reluctance, since some of the finest products of current Japanese scholarship are to be found in article rather than book form. However, the volume of periodical literature is simply too great to permit its coverage. An attempt has been made to compensate in some measure for this omission by providing extensive listings of the major journals of professional interestr in Chapter III and elsewhere throughout the book. 6. An attempt has been made to examine all entries at first hand. In a large majority of cases this has been possible, and the annotations are based directly upon the observations of the authors or their research assistants. There inevitably remains, however, a minority of cases which eluded all searches and which have been included upon the basis of secondary evidence. 7. The readers' indulgence is begged where the beginning and terminal dates of serial publications are concerned. Such data are apt to be very elusive in Japan, especially where wartime cessations or lapses of publication are concerned. A serious effort has been made to provide this information, but in a sizable number of instances it is still either lacking or uncertain. Question marks in brackets have been used to indicate such cases. 8. It has not been possible to include in this edition, as was done in the earlier one, an indication of what libraries in this country hold copies of any given entry. The former system of library indicators has been a victim of progress. The size both of the outstanding American collections of Japanese materials and of their uncatalogued backlogs has increased so enormously in the intervening years as to render any such attempt quite impractical. The omission is perhaps not too serious, however, since the development of a union catalogue of Japanese-language materials has made a nationwide list of holdings and locations available for many categories of publications acquired since 1949. 9. The reader will note a certain amount of duplication of entries between this work and several other volumes of the Center for Japanese Studies' Bibliographical Series, particularly where Professor John W. Hall's Japanese history: a guide to Japanese reference and research materials is concerned. These occur especially with respect to entries in the bibliography and basic reference sections of these works. The authors are aware of these duplications and have included such items only where it was judged that their value for political scientists was great enough to require their inclusion in the present volume. 10. Finally, the reader will note that the coverage of this revised edition has been changed in several ways. The section on \"Library science and publishing\" has been dropped and the internal arrangement of the chapters changed in several respects. New chapters or sections have been added on public administration; social, scientific and economic policy, legislation, and administration; international law and organization; major national administrative and advisory agencies; socio-economic structure and socio-political groups and movements; public opinion and the, mass-media; the demilitarization controversy; the budget, tax system, and public finance; the courts; international relations and international politics; comparative government and politics; and the Allied Occupation of Japan. These additions reflect in some measure the many changes that have occurred in the discipline of political science in postwar Japan, and in part the more favorable circumstances under which the present edition was compiled. The authors hope that they will render the volume more useful. The authors would like to take this opportunity of acknowledging their indebtedness to a number of individuals and institutions. Our obligation is greatest to our research assistants: Miss Kodera Sayoko and Messrs. Alfred Clubok, Miyake Ichir6, and Murakami Yoshihiro. Professors Isomura Tetsu, Kataoka Noboru, Maeshiba Kakuzo, Miyata Yutaka, Nagahama Masatoshi, Nakagawa Jun, Sugimura Toshimasa, Taijudo Kanae, and Waki Keihei of Kyoto and Ritsumeikan Universities were kind enough to examine and comment upon preliminary lists of entries in their respective fields of specialization. Professor Inoki Masamichi of Ky6to University's Law Department was of particular assistance in a variety of ways. We would also like to express our gratitude to the National Diet Library of Japan, the libraries of the Universities of Kyoto, Ritsumeikan, D6shisha, and Michigan, the library of the Tokyo Institute of Municipal Research (T6kyo Shisei Chosakai), and their respective staffs for the facilities and generous assistance which made this work possible. Special thanks are due to Mrs. Mori Fusako of the Ritsumeikan University Law Library. The project was supported or assisted by grants from the University of Michigan's Center for Japanese Studies, the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, the United States Fulbright Commission, and the Asia Foundation, to all of which we extend our thanks. It is inevitable that errors of selection, omission, fact, and interpretation occur in a work of this type. Despite their best efforts, the writers are keenly and uncomfortably aware that numerous such errors and shortcomings doubtless lurk undetected in the following lists. They sincerely solicit corrections or comments on these scores, though at the moment both confess to a feeling of some satiety with their labors in the bibliographical vineyard.

With the passage of the centuries and the accumulation of a rich and complex national body of writings, it has increased in importance and productivity. But at no time in the history of Japan has the bibliographic output of her scholars approximated that of the Taisho and Sh6wa eras (1912- ). Today the student is faced in most social science fields with an embarrassment of bibliographic riches, the more difficult and annoying to cope with by reason of the excessive degree of duplication, inconsistency, and lack of continuity which characterizes this type of Japanese publication. The problem is not one of discovering bibliographies which treat a particular field or subject, but of ascertaining which work or combination of works will yield reasonably complete coverage. The present chapter is intended to provide some guidance and assistance in this task. An attempt has been made to furnish a fairly complete list of the more important Japanese bibliographies, plus a few bibliographical articles, which relate in whole or in part to the several fields of political science. Since this is quite extensive, the entries have been classified. From the standpoint of organization, the problem of classifying relevant bibliographic materials has been approached along three main and several subsidiary paths. Major sections have been devoted to: 1) bibliographies of bibliographies, 2) general bibliographies which include coverage of some aspect of the literature of Japanese government and politics, and 3) specialized bibliographies of political science subjects. The first of these sections has not been subclassified. The second has been further classified with respect to five specific types of Japanese bibliographical material (all of general coverage from a subject standpoint): a) general; b) library catalogues; c) publishers' and bookdealers' yearbooks and catalogues; d) guides to official publications; and e) guides to periodical literature. A further category of general bibliography, i.e., guides to series, collections, and miscellanies, has been judged to be of primarily historical interest and has, therefore, been excluded from the present work. Those interested are referred to pp. 17-18 of Professor J. W. Hall's bibliography for the essential information. The third major category-specialized bibliographies —has been subclassified into eight sub-categories according to subject. These are: a) the Imperial House and the national polity; b) the constitution, national Diet, and elections; c) local government and administration; d) political history and political thought; e) socialism and labor movements; f) biographical literature; g) statistical literature; and h) miscellaneous. The student is warned at the outset against undue dependence on the specialized bibliographies. Few, if any, of the entries in this category are definitive save for very limited purposes and periods of time. As a class the so-called general bibliographies are more comprehensive and reliable. In all instances, therefore, it is advisable to check the materials located in the specialized bibliographies hereafter listed against several of the better general sources to insure that satisfactory coverage of the pertinent literature has been obtained. As a general bibliographical technique to be applied to most research problems in thi field, the following steps are recommended. Emphasis will, of course, vary with particular problems. 1) Consult any specialized bibliographies on the subject which may be available. 2) Consult the relevant sections of several of the better general bibliographies, which are identified in the introductory paragraphs to Section 2a of this chapter. These are well classified and materials are easily located. 3) Expand and bring up to date the list of materials obtained from the above sources by consulting appropriate volumes of the Zen-Nihon shuppambutsu somokuroku (Entry 53) or of one of the better publishers' yearbooks (e.g., Entries 59 and 60). Only those numbers which postdate the last reliable general or specialized bibliography used need be consulted. 4) Some periodical literature will have been discovered in the course of the preceding steps, but as a rule the sources there utilized make no pretence at adequate coverage of articles in professional or popular journals. It is, therefore, usually necessary to consult one or more periodical indexes for such information. It is also helpful to identify through these indexes the principal magazines in one's field of research, and, if time permits, to survey these individually, since the majority of Japanese periodical indexes are highly selective and apt to be unreliable. 5) Few of the above-mentioned sources will devote more than cursory attention to government publications. It is necessary, therefore, to check these in special bibliographies of official publications. If the material sought was published during or since 1927, this is relatively easy to do; if earlier, it is apt to be exceedingly difficult. 6) If the research problem concerned falls within the field of political history, and especially if it concerns either the Restoration period or the early constitutional period, it is always advisable to consult one of the several excellent guides to biographical and bio-historical literature. Much of the best and, unfortunately, most neglected material on this era is to be found in such sources. The multiplicity of steps involved in the above process is admittedly inconvenient and time consuming, but, given the limited time range and specialization of most Japanese bibliographical literature, they represent a necessary minimum of bibliographical research, if adequate coverage is to be assured. If the nature of the research or the limitations of the available Japanese collection are such as to render a more superficial coverage possible or 1\n\nPage 2 2 A GUIDE TO JAPANESE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH MATERIALS IN THE FIELD OF POLITICAL SCIENCE necessary, the writers recommend reference to one or more of the excellent research bibliographies identified in Section 2a of this chapter. A word might also be added with respect to the professional vocabulary of Japanese bibliographers. Japanese social science categories differ sufficiently in content from those generally accepted in the United States to mislead the uninformed student. For example, proletarian political activities, socialism, or communism are not infrequently catalogued in Japanese bibliographies —together with trade unions, social work, and associated fields — under the inclusive head shakai und6, \"social movements.\" Again, bibliographies of economics or economic history usually contain substantial sections on law and politics, while financial history (zaiseishi) is freqently treated as a branch of political rather than economic history. The titles and organization of Japanese bibliographies can be confusing in such ways, and the student is urged to take such possibilities into account in his bibliographical research. Those desirous of more detailed information on such matters are referred to Entries 195-202 in J. W. Hall's Bibliography of Japanese history. 1. Bibliographies of Bibliographies Works completely devoted to the listing of Japanese bibliographies of a general or specialized nature are somewhat rare. Although students who wish to check on publications in this field will find information readily available, they will be faced with the necessity of consulting a considerable number and variety of sources. There are at least two general studies with which students should be familiar. Of outstanding value is a work by one of Japan's most eminent bibliographers, Amano Keitaro, entitled Hompo shoshi no shoshi (A bibliography of Japanese bibliographies). This is a largely unannotated but very extensive classified list of Japanese bibliographical literature, both books and articles, published from ancient times to the end of 1932. For most purposes this is so complete as to render unnecessary any further search for bibliographical materials issued between 1868 and 1933. A second source, far less detailed and general in scope but of excellent quality, is a bibliographical essay entitled \"Les bibliographies japonaises,\" by the noted French scholar, Emile Gaspardone. Gaspardone was primarily interested in bibliographies of pre-Restoration Japanese history, religion and literature, but his sections on general indexes and catalogues and the bibliography of modern Japanese law and economics are useful and reliable. Further bibliographical data and descriptions of these items may be found in the list which follows these introductory paragraphs. It will be noted that the above-mentioned works cover only bibliographical writings published prior to 1933. For similar coverage of later publications in this field, the student will be obliged to consult a number of sources. The most complete listings will be found in the annual editions of the better publishers' yearbooks (See Entries 57 -62) or in the several publications of the National Diet Library (Kokuritsu Kokkai Toshokan) listed as Entries 51 to 53. The former are sometimes more convenient to use, although apt to be less comprehensive. The writers recommend the bibliographical sections of Entries 59, 60, and 62, as well as the occasional notes in such bibliophilic or bibliographic journals as the Dokusho shimbun, Nihon dokusho shimbun, or Tosho shimbun (Entries 11, 34, and 43, respectively). More selective and specialized lists devoted to the bibliography of bibliographies may be found in works by Hatano and Yayoshi, Honjo, and Kurita (Entries 14, 16, and 29). In general, however, the more specialized literature in this field frequently appears in periodicals or other sources which are rare and difficult to find even in Japan. 1. Amano Keitaro 6 W' A T, Hompo shoshi no shoshi 4t fp (A bibliography of Japanese bibliographies), Tokyo and Osaka, Mamiya Shoten, 1933, 370pp. The most definitive of recent works in this field by one of Japan's most reputable bibliographical scholars. It covers all bibliographical literature from ancient times to December 31, 1932 in two major parts: 1) works published prior to the Restoration (1868), and 2) works published since the Restoration. The second part is divided into three sections, the first of which covers such general bibliographical works as bibliographies of bibliographies, general indexes, bibliographies of reference works, of series, of rare books, of proscribed books, of lost or destroyed works, of official publications, of magazine and newspaper indexes, of library catalogues, of Occidental studies of Japan, and of other classes too numerous for mention. The second and principal section treats of specialized bibliographies in eighteen fields, including political science, law, administration, history, philosophy, social studies, economics, finance, statistics, sociology, education, folk-lore, military science, physical sciences, arts and crafts, industry, fine arts, language, linguistics, and literature. The concluding section comprises a supplement to this with similarly arranged entries. It is unfortunate that the two were not integrated. There are both subject and author indexes. Bibliographic style of entries varies considerably, and important details are frequently lacking. There is little annotation. Nevertheless, this work is an unusually complete and useful account of Japanese bibliographical literature. It should not be confused with a series of articles by the same author entitled \"Ishin irai hompo shomoku no shomoku, which is more restricted in coverage. 2. Gaspardone, Emile, \"Les bibliographies japonaises, t Bulletin de la Maison Franco-Japonaise, v. 4, 1933, pp. 29-116. An outstanding bibliographical essay by an eminent member of the Ecole Francaise de l'Extreme Orient. The author's interest centers on pre-Restoration bibliographies in the fields of history, religion, and literature, but his sections on general indexes and catalogues and on the bibliography of post-Restoration law and economics should be of very considerable value to the political scientist. The essay is divided into nine major\n\nPage 3 BIBLIOGRAPHIES 3 sections each covering the bibliography of one of the following fields: 1) general indexes, 2) periodical publications, 3) biography, 4) history, 5) geography, 6) economics and law, 7) ethnography and linguistics, 8) religion, and 9) literature. An appendix treats the bibliography of more specialized subjects, e.g. mathematics, astronomy, calligraphy, rare books, etc. Sections 1 and 4 are outstanding, as is the treatment of the major bibliographies of economic and agricultural subjects in section 6. The treatment of post-Restoration politics is relatively weak and the general inadequacy of the bibliographical citations annoying. 3.

General Bibliographies The phrase \"general bibliographies\" is used somewhat loosely in the present work to designate books, articles, catalogues, or checklists too broad in coverage to permit their inclusion in any of the eight specialized bibliographic categories listed under Section 3. In general this means that they treat the bibliography of more than one specific field within the discipline of political science. Specific fields have been narrowly defined so that bibliographies of Japanese law, for example, are regarded as covering several specific political science fields and have, therefore, been categorized as general. Within this context it has been possible to distinguish some five subtypes of general bibliographies. These are listed and described under subsections a to e below. a. General The student of Japanese government and politics is particularly fortunate with respect to this category. There exist several really first-rate general bibliographies of Japanese reference books and research materials. At least four of these merit special notice (more detailed descriptions are provided in the entries proper). All save the last are extensively annotated and especially useful on that account. The most general in its coverage, and probably the best for the prewar period, is a monumental work by Hatano Ken'ichi and Yayoshi Mitsunaga entitled Kenkyu chosa sanko bunken soran (General survey of reference works for study and research). It is classified, covers the literature of all principal fields in political science in accurate and reliable fashion, and is well indexed and simple to use. The writers recommend it highly. Less general in scope but more intensive in its treatment is Kurita Motoji's Sogo kokushi kenkyu (General guide for research in Japanese history). Professor Kurita's emphasis was primarily on historical literature, but so broadly interpreted as to include numerous fields and subjects of direct interest to the political scientist. The sections on political history and biography and on such general research tools as dictionaries, encyclopedias, bibliographies, catalogues, and chronologies are especially good for items published prior to 1935. Professor Honj6 Eijiro's three-volume Nihon keizaishi bunken (Bibliography of Japanese economic history) should also be mentioned. This contains major sections on political, legal, and social as well as economic matters. The first volume covers items published prior to 1932 while the other two carry the coverage up to 1950. Finally, for postwar publications only, the student should be familiar with a two-volume publication of the Horitsu Jiho Henshubu entitled Sengo hogaku bunken somokuroku (A general bibliography of postwar legal materials). This is the single most satisfactory guide to Japanese legal and political writings published during the period from August 1945 to the end of 1953 with which the writers are familiar. Its\n\nPage 4 4 A GUIDE TO JAPANESE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH MATERIALS IN THE FIELD OF POLITICAL SCIENCE political science sections are numerous, broadly defined, and excellent in their coverage. (For further information on these four items, see Entries 14, 29, 16, and 18). In addition to the works already mentioned, there are several others of sufficient quality and usefulness to merit special notice. The best of these is a two-volume classified but unannotated bibliography entitled Keizai horitsu bunken mokuroku (Catalogue of economic and legal literature) compiled by the Kobe Koto Shogyogakko Shogy6 Kenkyujo. It affords a more complete coverage of books, pamphlets, and important articles in all fields of political science appearing from 1916 to 1930 than does any other single source. Kuroita Katsumi's Kokushi no kenkyu also includes extensive lists of important Japanese historical works and excellent essays on the scope and methodology of the social sciences. There exists further a general classified bibliography of the literature of the Meiji era (1868-1912) entitled Meiji bunken mokuroku by Takaichi Yoshio which is most useful. (See Entries 26, 30, and 41, respectively). In the somewhat more specialized field of legal literature,mention should be made of three other bibliographical sources of outstanding merit. The first is a regular section of the Horitsu nenkan (Yearbook of law) entitled \"H6ritsu chosho ichiran (Survey of legal publications).\" This is a list of important legal books and articles published during the preceding year which is keyed to the numerous divisions of the six codes of Japanese law. The second is a lengthy article in the Bulletin de la Maison Franco-Japonaise, \"Bibliographie des principaux ouvrages juridiques edites dans l'empire japonais.\" This gives a well-selected list of the most important monographs published in all fields of Japanese law from 1925 to 1936. The last is a work written by an eminent group of legal specialists at Tokyo University entitled Hogaku kenky5 no shiori (Guide to the study of law) published in 1950. This is a broad introduction to both the literature and major issues in all fields of Japanese public and private law. It provides an excellent orientation in these subjects. (For further information see Entries 17, 9, and 25, respectively). There also exist a number of weekly newspapers and other periodical publications which specialize in news about new publications of all types and in all fields. Three of the best known are described below (See Entries 11, 34, and 43). Others of the same general type include the Nihon Shoseki Shuppan Kyokai's Shukan dokushojin TWe-ekly reader), the Azusakai's Shuppan daijesuto (Publications digest), the Shuppan nyusu (Publication news) published by the Shuppan Nyususha, Osakaya's Hon no hon (Book of books), Bukkusu (Books) by the Bukkusu no Kai, and numerous others. Titles and publishers undergo not infrequent changes in this field. Finally, it should be noted that most of the professional journals and so-called \"general magazines (sog6 zasshi)\" contain regular review and new literature sections which are of considerable bibliographical importance. Such journals are listed and described in Chapter III below. A new but related undertaking of general bibliographical use is the Nihon shohyo kaidai sakuin gepp5 (See Entry 35), a monthly book review index which first appeared in March 1959. This provides a further and useful approach to the general bibliography of this field. 9. \"Bibliographie des principaux ouvrages juridiques 6dites dans l'empire japonais,\" Bulletin de la maison franco-japonaise, v. 7, nos. 3-4, 1935, pp. 55-208. A highly selective but excellent list of outstanding works in the major fields of Japanese law. Attention is focused on monographs and books published between 1925 and January 1, 1936. Works published prior to 1925 are cited only if considered to be of \"living\" value or to comprise an important evolutionary stage in the development of modern legal doctrine. Entries are classified as follows: 1) philosophy of law and juridical sciences in general, 2) anniversary publications, 3) history of law and Roman law, 4) collections of laws and legal dictionaries, 5) constitutional law, 6) administrative law and taxes, 7) public international law, 8) private international law, 9) criminal law, 10) law of criminal procedure, 11) civil law, 12) commercial law, 13) law of civil procedure, 14) social law, 15) industrial law, 16) law of industrial, artistic and literary properties, 17) medical law, and 18) laws of foreign countries. Appendix I - a list of French legal works which have been translated into Japanese; Appendix II - a list of the legal works of Professor Sugiyama Naojir6; Appendix III - a list of the principal works in French on Japanese law. Titles are listed alphabetically in r6maji with French translations. Characters are given for title, author, and publishers. The contents of series and collections are analyzed. Annotations are few. This article comprises supplement no. 4 to \"Bibliographies des principales publications dditees dans l'empire japonais (See Entry 78).\" 10. Dai shiso ensaikuropejia - - -- -/ 4 7 v - ' (Encyclopedia of great thoughts), edited by Kanda Toyoho ~ v I #.., T6ky6, Shunjusha, 1927-30, 36v. Volumes 22, 23, 34, 35, and 36 of this famous encyclopedia are collectively entitled An annotated bibliography of the works of famous thinkers. The extensive entries in the first four of these volumes, however, refer only to the works of non-Japanese philosophers, political scientists, economists, lawyers, etc. Volume 36 includes Japanese works as well, but only in the fields of religion, philosophy, and literature. The separate index volume to the set includes a good classified list of Japanese reference books. 11. Dokusho shimbun; $ h l (Readers' guide), T6ky6, Dokusho Shimbunsha, [?]. Weekly.

Categories\n\nPage 5 BIBLIOGRAPHIES 5 of interest to the political scientist are as follows: 1) Japanese history (pre-Meiji), 2) Japanese history (post-Meiji), 3) Japanese law and jurisprudence, 4) Japanese statistical works, and 5) Japanese reference books, i.e., dictionaries, encyclopedias, and chronologies. It should be noted that, although each section was compiled by a Japanese expert, the selection in the above noted fields is highly arbitrary and tends to list older works and editions which have long since been superseded by more definitive treatments. The bibliographical citations are often seriously incomplete. 13.

This journal is not to be confused with another of identical title published from 1928 on by the Seinen Toshokan'in Remmei (See Entry 44). The present journal was the organ of the Unsokai X$ 4' j, a separate organization. Copies have not been available for examination. 14.

Undoubtedly the most valuable single work in this field for the student of post-Restoration Japan. Other works with a similar purpose, such as Kamba Takeo's Kihonteki sanko tosho mokuroku (A catalogue of basic reference books) and Tanaka and Mori's Naigai sanko tosho no chishiki (q.v.), while excellent for elementary purposes, are most incomplete in comparison. Covers books, articles, and serial publications under the following major categories: 1) bibliographies, 2) yearbooks, 3) publishers' lists, 4) foreign and Japanese literature, 5) fine arts and crafts, 6) philosophy, 7) religion, 8) Japanese and foreign history, 9) geography, 10) sociology, 11) law, 12) politics, 13) administration and police, 14) colonial affairs, 15) foreign relations, 16) social affairs, 17) labor, 18) agriculture, 19) finance, 20) economics, 21) business, 22) foreign trade, 23) insurance, 24) statistics, 25) military affairs, 26) communications, 27) the natural and physical sciences. There is an additional section on foreign bibliographies and an appendix which discusses types of reference works, their use and limitations, the planning of research, and bibliographic style. It includes both general and detailed tables of contents, an index of all Japanese titles cited, and a separate index of foreign works listed by author. All entries are annotated. The quality of the work is marred only by a number of mistakes in bibliographical detail which may well be typographical errors. 15.

All volumes contain major sections on political, social, and legal as well as economic history, and cover both books and periodical materials. No. 1, entitled Kaihan Nihon keizaishi bunken (A revised bibliography of Japanese economic history), combines and brings up to 1931 two previous bibliographies published in 1924 and 1926. No. 2, entitled Nihon keizaishi shin-bunken (A new bibliography of Japanese economic history), was published in 1942 and covers the literature from 1932-40. No. 3 carries the coverage from 1941 to 1950. A very useful series. 17. \"H6ritsu chosho ichiran At 4 X $ -t (Survey of legal publications), Horitsu nenkan, v. 1, 1925+. This regular annual review section of the Horitsu nenkan presents a detailed classified list of all significant books and articles on legal subjects issued during the year. The arrangement is keyed primarily to the six codes of Japanese law with numerous subclassifications. A very useful bibliographical source. 18.

An exhaustive two-volume compilation purporting to cover all significant books, articles and collections in all fields of law published in Japan from August 1945 until the end of 1953. Entries are arranged by title in the order of the syllabary and classified into 22 fields. Title, author, publisher, and year of publication are given for books; title, author, journal, and volume number for articles. The contents of collections are analyzed. Relevant bibliographic and reference materials, as well as collections of legal source materials, are covered. Treatment of official publications is normally limited to outstanding collections of source materials. In addition to all fields of public and private, domestic and international law, major sections are devoted to law in general; legal history; economic and industrial law; labor law and labor problems; social legislation and social problems; international politics and the history of international relations; political science, public administration, and political history; and to a miscellany of publications in such fields as general social science, sociology, social thought, economics, and history, where these have legal or political relevance. The section on political science is broadly defined and is excellent in its coverage. In general this would seem to be the most definitive single treatment of works of political interest for these years.\n\nPage 6 6 A GUIDE TO JAPANESE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH MATEIHALS IN THE FIELD OF POLITICAL SCIENCE 19.

Ikebe Yoshikata -t it_; A, Nihon h6seishi shomoku kaidai e l -A t _ $ ~ (Annotated bibliography of the history of Japanese legal institutions), Tokyo, Daitokaku, 1918, lv. ed., 815pp. Although this work does not cover legal works published since the Restoration, its value as a source for materials on the immediate background of modern Japanese law is so great that it is cited anyway. It is divided into three parts: 1) important catalogues and bibliographies of legal materials; 2) general reference works; and 3) specialized reference works. Annotations give the tables of contents of works cited, and, in respect to a number of scholarly journals, a list of all articles on pre-Restoration legal history. 22.

Jimbun,K L (The cultural sciences), T6ky6, Jimbun Kagaku Iinkai, March 1947 —[?]. Quarterly. The group which published this journal was a committee of the Ministry of Education. Each issue contains seven or eight leading articles on philosophical, literary, anthropological, political, or historical topics, and regular sections devoted to news of the academic world, a who's who in current research, bibliography, and book reviews. The bibliographical section is extensive and classified and affords excellent coverage of current books and selected articles in the fields of politics, law, foreign relations, economics, history, literature, and philosophy. Entries are not annotated. Four or five new books are also given formal reviews in each issue. The news of the academic world section notes the foundation of new academic societies, committee membership, reports of academic meetings, and long lists of research projects in process. The who's who in current research is a serial listing of the outstanding academicians and writers of postwar Japan by disciplines with an indication of their special fields. Volume 2, number 1, for example, covers teachers and writers in the field of law. 24.

The most thorough and valuable of the unannotated bibliographies. Covers books, pamphlets, bulletins, official and statistical publications, and important articles and materials appearing in a wide range of magazines and newspapers during the years 1916-1930. It is based primarily on items listed in the bibliographic section (\"Naikoku bunken mokuroku\") of the Kokumin keizai zasshi and lavishly supplemented from many other professional journals, the Teikoku toshokampo, Naimusho nohon geppo, Kancho kanko tosho mokuroku, and numerous publishers' indexes and books. All major scholarly and professional journals have been scanned for significant articles, and a wide variety of newspapers, including the more important prefectural papers, have also been examined. A convenient checklist of all magazines and newspapers covered is prefaced to both volumes. Entries are classified according to thirty-six major, and a large number of minor, categories, the most notable among which from the political scientist's standpoint are the following: economic and social history; social and urban problems; naturalization, racial and population problems; agriculture and agricultural policy; commerce, commercial science, management and industrial associations; trade; domestic and foreign\n\nPage 7 BIBLIOGRAPHIES 7 commercial policy; statistics and statistical science; economic and industrial conditions; the intellectual sciences in general; politics and administration; foreign relations and international politics; law and jurisprudence in general; constitutional law; administrative law; international public and private law; civil law; commercial law; industrial and social law; criminal law and policy; law of procedure and administration of justice; miscellaneous laws; history of law; law of other countries; collections of laws and ordinances, and collections of judicial decisions. Each volume contains an excellent and very detailed subject index, to which volume 1 adds a separate alphabetical index of the names of occidental authors cited. Volume 1 covers publications during the years 1916-1925; volume 2 extends the coverage to 1930, but does not include newspaper articles. 27.

This journal is the organ of the Institute of Commercial Studies of the Commercial University of Kobe. All numbers from 1909 include a regular bibliographical section, usually entitled \"Naikoku bunken mokuroku (Catalogue of Japanese literature).\" This affords one of the most extensive and complete surveys of current publications in all social science fields available. Its coverage of new political, legal, and economic literature is particularly good. 29. Kurita Motoji.

This work, together with Hatano and Yayoshi's Kenkyui chosa sanko bunken soran is probably the best of the selective annotated bibliographies of historical and political literature. Its emphasis is primarily historical, but the sections on political history, legislative history, foreign relations, general histories, economic history, biographical literature, dictionaries, encyclopedias, indexes, catalogues, chronologies, genealogy, collections of essays, and historical journals are of outstanding value to the political scientist. The three volumes cover Japanese historical writings on all periods of national history published since 1868. It does not include local histories or Korean history. Volumes 1 and 2 are devoted to pre-Restoration history; consequently, volume 3 is the only one of direct concern to political scientists. It is devoted to the above-listed aspects of modern Japanese history. All entries are classified and extensively annotated. The brief essays prefacing each section are excellent guides to Japanese opinion on the scope and content of the major divisions of historical research. 30.

Volume I of this work, subtitled Sosetsu (General introduction) possesses the following sections of bibliographical interest to the student of political science: 1) a chronology of important Japanese works on Japanese history arranged by years of publication from 1868 to 1930; 2) a similar chronology of works in Western languages on Japan published from 1364 to 1930, which is extremely interesting for the earlier years but very fragmentary for more recent publications; and 3) the author's recommendations of books and articles on political history classified under three heads - foreign relations, law, and the imperial court. The majority of the entries are unannotated. 31. \"Meiji shoki seijigaku kankei bunken nempy6ryaku o;:/ tn WI at _ ]. f _ ~ i ~ (Brief chronology of literature on political science published during the early years of Meiji),\" in Seijigaku kenkyiu &;, e wU, Onozuka ky6ju zaishoku nijigonen kinen,- or - AC ^. a t- F e- ~ (Volume published in commemoration of Professor Onozuka's 25th anniversary), v. 2, 1927, pp. 499-520. 32.

Each issue of this new publication contains an index of book reviews appearing in Japanese newspapers and periodicals during a month or two month period. There is normally a time lag of two months between coverage and date of publication. Coverage is restricted to reviews of works of fairly general interest but this category is broadly interpreted and includes many books of political interest. This is the only publication of this type known to exist in Japan. 36. Osatake Takeki WA I d, \"H6ritsugaku bunken - ~ L _ (Legal literature),\" in Yoshino Sakuz5o 6 f t _, ed.

Pages 1-216 are devoted to a classified and annotated list of Japanese reference works, while the rest of the volume discusses occidental reference books. Political scientists will be primarily interested in the section on the social sciences - with subsections on legal systems, politics and foreign relations, law, economics, statistics, and sociology - and on history and biography. Entries are listed by title, with complete bibliographical data plus a brief description of the contents. The preface contains two interesting essays on the use of reference books.

Yamada Hideo 5 4 I /4, ed., Shakai kagaku nempyo k /,\\ J } k (Annals of the social sciences), Toky6, Dobunkan, 1956, v. 1, 23+560pp. This is the first volume in a projected series representing a unique type of combined chronology and bibliography of developments in the social sciences. The series is intended to cover works of importance in such fields as political science, law, economics, sociology, history, pedagogy, philosophy, literature, and those in natural science having a significant effect on social science thought and writing. The years 1401 -1918 are to be covered, but the present volume goes only to 1750. Facing pages are used as a unit, the first five columns of which are used for the purpose of listing in chronological order the relevant social science literature under the countries where it was produced: 1) Great Britain and the United States; 2) France, Italy, and Belgium; 3) Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands; 4) Russia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Rumania, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, Yugoslavia; and 5) Japan. The sixth and final column is devoted to a chronology of important social and cultural events in these countries. The bibliographical data is given in both Japanese and the original language. Indexes of authors, titles, and names occurring in the chronology are appended. 47.

Library Catalogues Since the war the task of compiling a national bibliography of Japanese publications has been taken over by the National Diet Library (Kokuritsu Kokkai Toshokan). Its catalogues replace those compiled in prewar times by the Ministry of the Interior (Naimush6). Articles 24 and 25, as amended, of the National Diet Library Law require the automatic deposit with the Library of practically all new publications of the Japanese government as well as those of private publishers throughout Japan. The Library's catalogues thus provide the most complete and definitive listing of all types of publication in postwar Japan. For the period since April 1948 the basic series (See Entry 53) entitled Zen-Nihon shuppambutsu somokuroku is well organized and relatively simple to use. Attention is also called to Entries 51 and 55, two other postwar library publications which focus more specifically on legal and political works. In prewar times Japanese law long required that copies of all commercially printed works be submitted to the Ministry of the Interior for copyright and censorship purposes. The appropriate bureau within the ministry, after processing these, was in the habit of issuing lists of all titles submitted. These provide an exhaustive and practically complete guide to all Japanese literature with the exception of official publications and magazine articles. Publication of such lists appears to have been intermittent in the early days but continuous since at least 1924. Despite their completeness these Ministry of the Interior catalogues are in general difficult to obtain in this country and very inconvenient to use. Save in the case of the most exacting or specialized research, it is usually possible to obtain equally satisfactory bibliographical information with far less effort from a variety of other sources. If it does become necessary to consult so detailed a reference work for information on materials published since 1908, the Teikoku toshokampo (Bulletin of the Imperial Library) contains the same titles and is simpler to use. For earlier materials, however, the Ministry of the Interior's catalogues entitled Toshokyoku shomoku and Daini toshoka shomoku, which cumulate the titles of publications issued in the 1870s and 1880s, do possess a definite value for the student of political history. They probably afford more complete coverage of printed works during these early years than does any other single source. These prewar catalogues of the Ministry of the Interior and the major series of prewar library catalogues have been completely described by J. W. Hall on pages 9-13 of the Japanese History volume of the present Bibliographical Series. The following items are, therefore, restricted to a few major catalogues, primarily postwar in date, which possess particular interest or importance to political scientists. 51.

They are located in the principal ministries and judicial organs of the national government. This unannotated catalogue lists books and other materials held in each such branch library. An index is appended. 52.

Annual. An annual national catalogue of books and periodicals published in Japan since April 1948. Recent editions have been divided into major sections on: 1) books, covering national and local governmental publications, ordinary books and children's books; 2) periodicals, covering national and local governmental periodicals, ordinary periodicals and newspapers; 3) special data, treating publications in Braille, records, motion picture films, slides, and certain illustrative materials; 4) supplements; and 5) appendices, which contain title indexes for books and periodicals, a table of publishers, and a table on the amount of publication being done in Japan. The data provided for entries usually include: author, title, publisher, date of publication, size of book, pagination, and price. This is the most authoritative and compendious catalogue of this type ever published in Japan. Coverage usually runs about two years behind the date of publication. 54. Minami Manshu Tetsudo Kabushiki Kaisha a7j:-.Jf Ad A - (South Manchurian Railway Co., Ltd.), Sakuin mokuroku. ~1 I (Index catalogue), Dairen, Minami Manshu Tetsud6 Kabushiki Kaisha, 1928-29, 1934, 3v. A catalogue of all books and data held by the General Affairs and Research Section (later the Data Section) of the South Manchurian Railway Company. Most relate to politics, diplomacy, and economic and social affairs in Manchuria and China. The first volume covers a period ending in 1923, the second volume the period from January 1924 to September 1927, and the third October 1927 to October 1933. The contents of each volume are classified as follows: geography, history, culture, economics, agriculture, forestry, the dairy\n\nPage 11 BIBLIOGRAPHIES 11 industry, fishing, mining, industry, commerce, transportation, finance, money and banking, colonization and immigration, social affairs and labor, cities, legal system, politics, diplomacy, military affairs, and the South Manchurian Railway, and relevant legislation. 55.

An author index is appended. See also Entries in J. W. Hall, nos. 53-82. c. Publishers' and Bookdealers' Yearbooks and Catalogues Japanese publishers' catalogues in general and the so-called shuppan nenkan (yearbooks of publications) in particular are exceedingly useful sources of bibliographical information. The latter, it should be noted, are largely issued by associations of publishing houses, not by individual publishers. The significance of this lies in the fact that they usually list only works printed or carried by their member firms. This, and the further fact that membership is apt to be localized in the Tokyo area, somewhat limit their coverage. Since, however, the Tokyo publishers print a vast majority of all Japanese books and most of the Tokyo publishers belong to the major publishing associations, the shuppan nenkan of these groups include a large majority of the new commercially printed titles issued during the year. They are, furthermore, well classified and simple to use. The best of the prewar shuppan nenkan is the series published annually since 1930 by Tokyodo. Its coverage is perhaps not quite so extensive as that of the similar and next ranking series published by the Toky6 Shosekish6 Kumiai since 1929, but this is more than offset by the brief but pithy description of each item's contents given in its listings. With this qualification, both series are highly recommended. Certain of the major publishing associations also publish additional types of catalogues of which the student should be aware. Both Tokyodo and Toky6 Shosekisho Kumiai, for example, also publish a monthly catalogue on which their shuppan nenkan was based. Of far more importance, however, are the catalogues known as Tosho s6mokuroku (General catalogues of books) issued at irregular intervals by the T6ky6 Shosekisho Kumiai. This great publishers index passed through nine editions between 1893 and 1940. Each issue represents a cumulation of the entries in those numbers of the association's monthly catalogue which had appeared since the preceding edition, plus older stock still on hand. Each edition thus represents a catalogue of books in print as of its publication date, with the qualification that only titles printed or carried by member firms are included. It is, therefore, of far broader scope than the shuppan nenkan. Students interested primarily in postwar publications will find the same types of publishers' catalogues available in two series. The Nihon shuppan nenkan (Entry 57) covers publications during the 1942-47 period, while the Shuppan nenkan (Entry 59) covers the years since 1950. There is a gap for the 1948-49 period. Many publishers and publishers' associations also publish periodicals of a weekly or monthly type containing reviews of new books and lists of recent publications. A number of the major ones have already been mentioned in the introduction to Section a above (q.v.). 57. Nihon Shuppan Kyodo Kabushiki Kaisha 9; i, L,~ [ ~ A / b (Japan Publishing Association), Nihon shuppan nenkan; JL L (Yearbook of Japanese publications), Tokyo, Nihon Shuppan Kyodo Kabushiki Kaisha, 1943-48. A wartime and postwar version of the familiar prewar publishers yearbooks issued by T&kyodo, T6kyo Shosekish6 Kumiai, etc., and very similar to these in makeup and contents. The 1943 edition covers publications during 1942, the 1947 edition, the period 1943-45, and the 1948 edition 1946-47. Part I consists of a general survey of activities in the book and magazine publishing fields; part II describes the organization and activities of various publishing associations; and part III, constituting the major portion of the volume, sets forth a classified list of outstanding works for this period selected by the Ministry of Education and the Japan Publishers' Association, followed by a classified list of books published during the years under consideration. Entries are arranged by author according to a detailed classification scheme, and are unannotated. Part IV is a classified list of magazines giving title, frequency of issue, measurements, average pagination, price and publisher; part V cites the texts of laws and ordinances which affect the publishing business; and part VI is a list of publishing houses and their addresses. This series continues the T6kyodo series and is succeeded by Entry 59. 58. Shuppan nyusu -- - - (Publishing news), T6ky6, Nihon Shuppan Haikyu Kabushiki Kaisha, 11 November 1946-[? ]. Every 10 days. A trade journal giving news of the publishing business plus an extensive list of new publications, both books and periodicals. The contents of all entries are briefly described.\n\nPage 12 12 A GUIDE TO JAPANESE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH MATERIALS IN THE FIELD OF POLITICAL SCIENCE 59. Shuppan Nyuisusha i~ ~ - - ~ A, Shuppan nenkan R L - 4L (Yearbook of publications), Tokyo, Shuppan Nyususha, 1951+. A very comprehensive publishers yearbook generally similar to the prewar Toky5do series (Entry 60), and to Entry 57 which it supersedes, save that it lacks annotations. It is the only publication of its type currently available. Contents and arrangement vary somewhat from year to year but a recent issue contains: 1) a general review of publishing; 2) a list of books published during the year prior to the publication of this volume; 3) a list of periodicals in print; 4) publishing statistics; 5) lists of publishers, libraries, presses, etc.; 6) a section on legislation and regulations affecting the publishing trade; and 7) a series of indexes. 60. TokyodO ~ ~ t, Shuppan nenkan i Kgz- 1 K (Yearbook of publications), T6kyo, Tokyodo, 1930-41. This is the most useful of the several prewar yearbooks of publications noted in this section. Each volume covers publications during the calendar year preceding its issue. Like the comparable yearbook of the Toky5 Shosekish6 Kumiai, it covers only works handled by member firms. This includes a large majority of the titles appearing in Japan. Subscription works, texts and government publications are usually not covered. Each issue is divided into seven major sections. Section 1 covers the following matters of possible interest: a) a month-by-month account of publishing news; b) a list of important books selected by the publishers; c) a list of books and magazines banned by the Home Ministry every month; d) news about magazines; e) a list of newspapers and publishing firms which regularly issue significant bibliographic articles or book reviews; f) after 1932, the Ministry of Education and the Library Association's lists of outstanding books; and g) after 1935, a classified bibliography section listing all major bibliographical books and articles appearing during the preceding year. Section 2 gives a great variety of current and historical publishing statistics. Section 3 provides an elaborately classified catalogue of the year's publications, with complete bibliographical data for every entry, plus identification of the author, and, of particular use, a brief but pithy description of its contents. Section 4 is a classified list of current Japanese magazines with complete bibliographical data, and, after 1933, a brief description of their usual interests and emphases. Section 5 furnishes a list of Japanese publishing houses and their addresses, while Sections 6 and 7 set forth respectively the constitutions and by-laws of the several publishing associations and the texts of laws and ordinances affecting the publishing business. This series is carried on by Entry 57. 61. Tokyo Shosekish6 Kumiai t ~ & * Sy 4 4, (T5ky6 Bookdealers' Association), Shuppan nenkan, ft- S (Yearbook of publications), Toky6, Tokyo Shosekisho Kumiai Jimusho, 1929-[? ]. Annual. This is the less useful of the two major annual publishers' indexes in prewar Japan. It is a classified but unannotated list of all books published by members of the Association during the preceding year. It thus covers most but not all books published in Japan during such a period. It lists relatively few official publications. The major part of any edition is taken up by a classified list of the year's publications. Categories vary somewhat from edition to edition, but usually the political scientist will find major or minor heads on the imperial house and the national polity; political science, the national political scene, foreign relations, political parties, the cabinet, politicians, the Diet, elections and local government; history and geography; economics, finance and social problems; collections and published lectures, subscription works, dictionaries, who's who and similar directories, and yearbooks. A number of editions during the 1930s follow the annoying practice of listing works within each of the preceding categories by month of publication. Complete bibliographical data are given for each entry. Separate sections of each edition contain a wealth of specialized information on the publishing business and related activities. Publishing and advertising statistics for the year are always given, plus a month-by-month account of publishing news, description of the organizations and activities of the several trade associations, texts of laws and regulations affecting the business,etc. Of greater bibliographical utility are the occasional surveys of scholarly journals and lists of officially proscribed books. In general the student will probably find this work less convenient to use and less informative than its major rival, the Tokyodo's Shuppan nenkan (q.v.). This series of publishers' yearbooks was really inaugurated by a shortlived Tosho somokuroku series first issued by the Association in 1926. 62.

The great publishers index of Japan which passed through nine editions prior to the war. Each edition represents a cumulation of the entries in those issues of the Association's Tosho geppo appearing since the previous edition plus older stock still on hand. In general, therefore, each edition represents a catalogue of books in print as of its publication date, with the qualification that only titles published or handled by members of the Association are included. This covers a large majority of all books published in Japan. Most editions consist of three parts, a title catalogue, a publisher's catalogue and a classified catalogue. After the 1929 edition, an author catalogue is also included. Complete bibliographical data - but no annotations - are given in all cases. A separate section lists alphabetically all foreign language works published by Japanese firms. The classified catalogue affords a detailed coverage of works in all major fields of political science and related subjects. There is a subject index. The first and second editions of this work, although issued by the same Association, bear the variant title of Tokyo shoseki shuppan eigy6sha kumiai shoseki s6mokuroku.
