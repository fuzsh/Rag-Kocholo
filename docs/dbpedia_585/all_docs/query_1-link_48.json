        "text": "Japan has the world's third-largest economy, having achieved remarkable growth in the second half of the 20th Century after the devastation of World War Two.\n\nIts role in the international community is considerable. It is a major aid donor, and a source of global capital and credit.\n\nMore than three quarters of the population live in sprawling cities on the coastal fringes of Japan's four mountainous, heavily-wooded islands.\n\nJapan's rapid post-war expansion - propelled by highly successful car and consumer electronics industries - ran out of steam by the 1990s under a mounting debt burden that successive governments have failed to address.\n\nJapan's relations with its neighbours are still heavily influenced by the legacy of Japanese actions before and during World War Two. Japan has found it difficult to accept and atone for its treatment of the citizens of countries it occupied.\n\nCrown Prince Naruhito succeeded to the throne as emperor when his father Akihito abdicated on the last day of April 2019, after a reign of 30 years.\n\nAkihito had no political power, but played an important role in working to heal the wounds of a war waged across Asia in the name of his own father, the Emperor Hirohito.\n\nHe also promoted a more approachable image of the imperial family among the Japanese public, a style that the new emperor is expected to continue.\n\nEmperor Naruhito, who studied at Oxford University, has said that his reign will bear the name Reiwa, which \"beautiful harmony\".\n\nPrime minister: Fumio Kishida\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in August 2024 that he would not seek re-election as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which he said needed a \"new start\".\n\nThe 67-year-old LDP veteran is expected to step down as PM after the party elects a new leader in September.\n\nSupport for Mr Kishida, who has been PM since 2021, has fallen in the wake of a corruption scandal involving his party, rising living costs and a slumping yen.\n\nHis approval ratings had plummeted to 15.5% in July 2024 - the lowest for a PM in more than a decade.\n\nHis diplomatic wins - an ambitious budget to expand the military, deeper ties with the US and a historic dÃ©tente with South Korea - could not save him.\n\n\"In the upcoming presidential election, it's necessary to show the people that the Liberal Democratic Party will change,\" Mr Kishida said at a press conference announcing his decision.\n\nWithin the party, some had doubted whether Mr Kishida could lead the LDP to a win in the next general election due in 2025. The party has been in power almost continuously since 1955.\n\nSome key dates in Japan's history:\n\n1853 - US fleet forces Japan to open up to foreign influence after over 200 years of self-imposed isolation.\n\n1868 - Empire of Japan proclaimed, and country enters period of rapid industrialisation and imperial expansion.\n\n1894-95 - Japan goes to war with China, and its better-equipped forces win victory in just nine months.
