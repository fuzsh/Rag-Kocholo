        "text": "TOKYO -- On July 8, former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was campaigning in the western city of Nara, ahead of close-fought elections for Japan's upper house two days later. It was a characteristically virtuoso performance: Abe glad-handed with onlookers and delivered a stump speech in support of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's candidate.\n\nMid-speech, two loud blasts were heard and Abe fell to the ground, fatally wounded by an assassin's homemade gun."
