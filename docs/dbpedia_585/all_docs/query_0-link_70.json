        "text": "第二政党制\n\n16. Second Party System\n\n1919-1920\n\n​\n\nThe Japanese political system had weathered an unbelievable number of blows after the Manchuria Incident in 1919. The Sakurakai, a coalition of liberal and centrist parties, had collapsed into itself, and the Imperial Alliance seemed fit to sweep the Parliament in the 1920 general election, and bring about the final blows to the constitutional democracy that had been cultivated for ages. That was, of course, on the assumption that their man with the ear of the Emperor would follow the party line. This is where the famed Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi took his position as one of the most Machiavellian men of the 20th century.\n\nHe had taken power in the Imperial Alliance's intricacies based on his pre-existing position within the Japanese genrō, and his ties to both centrists and ultra-nationalists.\n\nHowever, shortly after being appointed to the office of Prime Minister in 1919, he took immediately to flipping Japan's current system upside down.\n\nIn early 1920, Prime Minister Inukai and a large number of his supporters in the Diet forcibly withdrew from the Imperial Alliance, declaring the re-establishment of the Rikken Seiyuukai. This was motivated largely on the belief that their ideas were in conflict with those of Sadao Araki's faction within the Imperial Alliance, whom held the belief that Japan needed a full-frontal response to the insult delivered by Manchuria. For the 1920 election, it seemed that four major parties would be fighting to death for the rule over Japan.\n\nThe Rikken Seiyuukai postured themselves as a 'common sense conservative' alliance, modeled after classical liberalism and the rule of law and order. While at one time it had been supportive of the miltaristic goals of the Army and Navy for sake of votes, the sharp movement of public opinion against them, and the hardened views of Inukai Tsuyoshi, drove them to establish a concrete opposition to radical militarism. They did not refute the role of Japan as the 'liberator of Asia' and the 'establishment of a Japanese-dominated Asian movement for independence and anti-imperialism', but they refuted 'pursuing these goals without regard for international diplomacy and peace'.\n\nSlightly to their left was the Jiyuutou, lead by Ichirou Hatoyama. While Ichirō's political beliefs did not different that significantly from that of the Seiyuukai, he established the Jiyuutou as a party slightly to the left, which embraced further 'universal democracy' as a way to stabilize Japan. If every man had a stake in voting, then the system of the genrou and the landed elite could be ended. The Seiyuukai and the Jiyuutou, which differed only slightly on some issues, typically found common allies with each other.\n\nThe two 'odd man out' parties were the Minshutou and the Seigitou. The Minshutou was a reformed social democratic party that had reorganized with a more centrist perspective for the sake of avoiding being shutdown under the large number of anti-socialist laws that were being passed to cap on leftist insurrection. Tetsu Katayama, the 33 year old organizer of the Party, was advocating for a strong and unbreakable anti-militarist position. The Minshutou advocated a stronger pacifistic orientation for Japan, and a more cloak-dagger approach to forcing Europe to withdraw from their colonies. This party largely resembled Prime Minister Minobe's policies, and advocated economic and diplomatic strongarming over military strongarming.\n\nThe Seigitou were unapologetic ultranationalists. While toning down the violent behaviours, they were not quiet in advocating a Shouwa Restoration to restore the proper power of the Emperor over the state. Sadao Araki gained heavy support from militarists and traditionalists, whom looked down on Inukai for his traitorious actions towards the cause of restoring Japan's rightful balance of power. When the 1920 election arrived, the results did not surprise many.\n\n​\n\nNo party had achieved a majority, but Inukai's Rikken Seiyuukai had emerged the clear plurality victor. In a backdoor deal, the Jiyuutou and Minshutou both agreed to back Inukai's government in exchange for seats in his Cabinet.\n\nInukai would remain Prime Minister for the foreseeable future, barring coup d'etat, or an untimely and tragic death by natural causes. The election was a remarkable demonstration of the stability of Japan's democracy, and many heralded the 1920 election as the start as the Second Party System.\n\nOn his part, Inukai's master strategy to undermine the militarist cause was a successful one. He had played the part of a man endeared by the system, and had played their civilian front-man for as long as it had been necessary to get into power, and from there, the knife was plunged into the back. It was not dishonorable to do what was right for Japan, it was only dishonorable to plunge forth without concern for the future and what it might hold. If they were too stupid to look back through his history and see the man whom he truly was, that was their fault.\n\nHowever, Inukai was not pleased with the string of setbacks, and would have to invest effort to reverse Japan's misfortune...\n\n​\n\n天皇と国家\n\n17. The Emperor and the State\n\n​\n\nEmperor Hirohito was entering the cusp of adulthood at the time of the start of the Second Party System. He was incredibly eager to take the reigns of power formally as a full powered man, rather than a regency-limited young adult. On April 29, 1921, the Regency was dissolved as Emperor Hirohito formally reached legal age. The Emperor's 20th birthday was widely celebrated across Japan, and demonstrations of loyalty to the Emperor were shown in cities from Sapporo in the far-north, to Taipei in the far south. The Emperor had been kept abreast of the developments in the political system, and had eagerly wanted to continue the new 'stability' found in the Inukai government.\n\nWhile there had been an uneasy peace between 1919 and 1921, things grew tense again after the United States, under Theodore Roosevelt, approved a number of rapid ship-building orders, which would vastly expand the American navy to a size unseen before. This sent alarm in both London and Tokyo, whom were not sure how to take it. Similarly, Berlin, which had technically won World War I, began their own ship armament program to rebuild the revolution and war-damaged Reichskriegsmarine. London and Tokyo both took the natural response and started their own naval arms programs, which sent the world into a murmur that it could be the start of a new naval arms race, one that caused an immense amount of problems between Germany and Britain in the late 19th century, and early 20th century.\n\nA conference was called from Tokyo, inviting the representatives of Washington, London and Berlin to discuss a more 'mutual' method of dealing with this. While the Japanese delegation would not propose limitations on naval power, they would attempt to turn everyone away from each other, and forge a tenuous peace. While London and Tokyo were already firm and loyal allies to one another, Washington D.C. and Berlin were enigmatic--the democratic American system could not guarantee one isolationist President from an interventionist, as seen with William Borah and Theodore Roosevelt--while Berlin had been the war-time enemy of both London and Tokyo a scant 4 years prior. An alliance wouldn't happen, but perhaps some diplomatic wrangling on all sides could do well for business.\n\nThe Tokyo Treaty, which was heavily negotiated through the months of 1921 and into early 1922, was the Japanese attempt to push the issue of communism as a threat to monarchy and republicanism alike-- and turn the naval arm race into that of a mutual agreement to fight communism. The other three powers were enthralled by the idea--London and Berlin because they were the first targets of an aggressive France or other communist regimes in Europe, while America was simply itching for a fight to commit to--Japan would rather it be against the Reds than against them and their interests in China. The final result of the Tokyo Treaty was simply an affirmation of mutual interest--the four powers would dedicate themselves to combating communism where ever it decided to rear it's ugly head. Despite this, Japan was required to take light steps in their meddling in China, as the United States' new interventionist government was increasingly concerned about Japan's sphere of influence in the region, and rumors were spreading through Tokyo that the French exiles in Indochina, and the United States, were starting to support Jiang Jieshi's Chinese regime.\n\nAfter a number of successes for Jiang, and a great northern offensive against Mao and his cadre of soldiers, Japan decided that her worries held weight, and began to sell surplus military supplies to the Qing monarchy, and, strangely, to Mao Tse-tung's Republicans, hoping to keep Jiang down, and limited to Southern China, and away from their holdings in Manchuria, despite the gains made by the Manchurian warlord.\n\nThe Chinese communists were routed from their hold outs in the Fujian province, and were forced to retreat northwest. The Long March as it became known to communist propagandists was lead by Chen Duxiu through the Chinese countryside into the steppe, bringing them into direct conflict with the Yuan Empire. After seizing control of the majority of the Shaanxi province, they pushed north and west, expanding into both Inner Mongolia and the heart of the Yuan Empire.\n\nWith the Chinese communists scoring victories against the Yuan, and threatening the ambition of the Khan, Khan Sternberg put into motion his military invasion of China, focusing his efforts against the Yuan Empire, beginning in the summer of 1922--this effort was pronounced and focused on subjugating the collapsing Chinese imperial state, and setting a springboard from which the Khan could 'cascade' through the rest of China. The 'Imperial Army' was demoralized and incapable of putting up a fight against the Khan's troops, and rapidly folded in, despite uprisings and military attacks done by Turkestani and Tibetan nationalists.\n\nThe front-lines in China after the fact stabilized by 1923, with the various factions taking rest and recovery before the start of another campaign in the years to come. The situation in China was growing further out of Japanese control, and there were deep concerns that something would have to be done to secure a safe place for Japanese interests without drawing more ire from the Chinese population.\n\nIn early 1923, Britain's aegis was growing once more. Having converted the former Ottoman regimes of Assyria, Iraq and the Hejaz/'Hashemite Kingdom' into independent protectorate states, Britain looked to unite the Arab peninsula under a friendly, pro-British rule. This had begun in 1920 with the annexation of the Ha'il by the Hashemites, but the Saud family were a heavy burden in their side. In 1923, the Hejaz monarchy went to war with the Sauds for control of the Arab Peninsula, backed by British interests. The Saud lasted but a few weeks, and the Saudi monarchy was dissolved and forced to heel before the British protectorate.\n\nSatisfied with the situation, Britain created a new 'independent' Yemeni state to be part of the full control of the Arabian peninsula, with only Aden remaining under direct British authority. Similarly, they pursued a policy related to this in Asia. While Siam had been made a neutral zone between France and Britain in the 19th century, Britain began to once again chew away at the Siamese territory in the early 1920s, motivated by creating a security against the unstable French Indochina, and to further 'buffer' their interests in the Raj against Chinese radicals, should they start a southern march--the Shan States, which had mostly been annexed in the 19th century, were now fully integrated into the British Raj, with the southern parts of the country falling into a similar state of affairs.\n\nJapan wasn't pleased with the British move, but reserved their disfunction as, at the time, Japan was not having an easy day.\n\nSeptember 1, 1923 is a day that many Japanese citizens would recall as one of the most horrific. A brief two minutes before noon, the earth began to tremor beneath Sagami Bay. The 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake lasted, according to eyewitness, between 4 to 10 minutes, and caused a horrendous amount of devastation across the heart of the Japanese Empire. Over 140,000 people died in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, with firestorms ravaging downtown Tokyo, destroying almost everything in it's wake--followed shortly by the impact of a typhoon, and a resultant tsunami.\n\nThe Empress Nagako, whom had married Emperor Hirohito earlier that year, was killed in the resulting firestorm, with Emperor Hirohito managing to avoid injury, though he was pinned beneath rubble for three days. To make matters worse, many radicals in the state took advantage of the chaos and death following the disaster to spread negative rumors. Rumors spread that Koreans were taking advantage of the pandemonium to loot and rape as much as they could to 'make even with the Japanese occupier'. Violence escalated as ultranationalists began to attack and murder Koreans in the countryside.\n\nMany regional police officers and Imperial Japanese Army soldiers were using the violence and chaos as a pretext to murder and kill political dissents. Former Prime Minister Minobe Tatsukichi was murdered by Imperial Army soldiers in the early morning of September 2nd. The violence was quelled soon after by loyalist soldiers, called up by Prime Minister Inukai.\n\nThe Emperor was recovered from the rubble of the damaged palace on September 4, 1923. Upon being retrieved from the rubble, the Emperor was informed of the situation as it stood, and was hospitalized to ensure he was not in a bad state. Despite his hospitalization, he was outraged, and the Emperor ordered an immediate audience with Prime Minister Inukai.\n\nThe following seven days, known as the Week of Discipline, was ordered by Emperor Hirohito, in which Imperial Japanese Army officers, police officers and government officials whom participated in false rumors, extrajudicial murders, and criminal activity were rounded up by those in the IJA whom were against the militarists. By September 11th, over 750 people had been arrested in connection to the events of the earthquake.\n\nThose 750 were condemned as criminals, and sentenced to execution for crimes against the Emperor and treason. The criminal penalties were harsh, but Prime Minister Inukai defended it by saying that the Empire's need for unity was sacrosanct, and that men attempting to subvert it by creating false divisions were of no use to the people of Japan, and of no use to the Emperor. While the Emperor did not address the people (as such things were not done), it was heavily implied through the press that the Emperor was the mastermind behind the purge that targeted militarists.\n\nInukai's government weathered the 1923 earthquake disaster, and legislative action was taken shortly afterwards to 'enforce' new regulations to deal with disaster preparedness, and prevent another horrible disaster like September 1, 1923 from happening again.\n\nAfter the destruction of Tokyo's core, the implementation of a new architectural design plan was approved, and, with the Prefectural Reforms of 1918 in mind, a new Tokyo began construction almost immediately.​"
