This is necessary because these relationships determined the strength and ,iimitations of the constitutional system which was developed in Japan. Thus, this Unit focuses on the reasons leading to the formation of political parties and the position sthese parties occupied in the state structure.\n\n.22 CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT UNDER\n\n####### MEIJI OLIGARCHY\n\nI[n 1889 the Meiji Emperor granted to his pdmple a constitution which laid the basis for a constitutbnal government. The process by which this constitution was drafted imd its chardteristic features have been discussed earlier in Unit 16. Here it would I>e suffice to note that the constitutiori was drafted by the Meiji oligarchy who were profoundly anti-democratic in their thinking. The_,Meijileaders distrusted the idea of ;I popularly elected government and thought that such a system would lead to social imd political chaos. Yet they drafted a constitutional framework under which political parties functioned.\n\n'bambiguity in the Meiji constitutional model was noted by the constitutional t:xpert Minobq Tatsukichi who +rote in 1926: \"Our constitution has developed in a manner completely contrary to the expectations of its authors. Institutionally the system of cabinets responsible to the Diet has no place in the &stitdon, but it has been M y established as a customary practice.\"\n\nPOSI World War-l Japan This customary practice took time to grow and it was only in 1924 that because of a general election a cabinet with a majority in the lower house formed. This cabinet led by Kato Takaaki and known as the cabinet to protect constitutional government inaugurated an era of party governments. Thus, from June 1924 to May 1933 all the prime ministers represented the major parties in thetower house.\n\nThe questions which arise are why did it take so long for political parties to establish the principal that the majority party in the lower house has the right to form a government and why did this system last for so short a period? In looking at these questions we shall discuss the steps leading up to the formation of political parties and then the position these parties occupied in the state structure.\n\n22.2 Formation of Political Parties The accepted argument has been that the Tokugawa period was'an undemocratic political structure where political power was strictly confined. Today, however, many schdlars seeking for the roots of Japan's success in modernization have begun to argue that in the period before the opening of Japan by the Western powers, Japan had developed not only economic skills and institutions but had also begun to evolve a political structure in which discussion and debate was an integral element. The Shogun did not rule as an arbitrary despot but represented a depersonalized source of power which was exercised through deliberations. These were of course confined to a small section or class of society but because the exercise of power was not arbitrary modem Japan could adapt a constitutional government.\n\nScholars like Irokawa Daikichi seek the development of democratic ideas in the popular movements in rural and urban areas in the Tokugawa period. These movements challenged the authority of the Tokugawa state and created the beginnings of a political consciousness and the possibility of joining together to seek redress from the state. These movements were not politically successful in either bringing down the Tokugawa Bakufu or in putting forward an alternative to it. Yet, they built a tradition which was used by the Peoples' Rights Movement to press its demands for a popularly elected assembly.\n\nThe Meiji Restoration, which began a period when ~ a ~ a n e s einstitutions and practices were dramatically altered, saw the builqling of a centralized political structure. This has been discussed earlier in Unit I?. Here it may be noted that political associations and groups were formed tq demafid a constitutional government. In 1880, for instance, there were ,%r 1 SO local societies, such as the Kojunsha in Kochi or the Yashinsha in Gumma, demandik the establishment of a national assembly.\n\nThe Meiji state, on the other hand, preferred to create a political strudure which could be closely managed and controlled and where social pressures would &main within the framework desired by the leaders. Of course there were debates and differing views. The Meiji oligarchy wanted to, above all, preserve the sovereignty of the Emperor from being usurped by the people. However, steps to prevent the emergence of a body, like the Tokugawa Bakufu (the Bakufu had ruled in the name of the Emperor) led to a diffusiorr of authority among the organs of the state with; none of them exercising absolute power. Thus on the one hand the Meiji state , appear@ to be highly'centralized under an Imperial authority on the other, power was parcelled out leading to considerable autonomy for each group or institution. However, the direct authority of the Emperor could be used to advantage and it was so used by different groups such as the army or the bureaucracy. We must remember here that the constitutional system functioned not to protect the liberty of the people but to protect the sovereignty of the Emperor. However, in practice to coordinate these'institutions of the state, the oligarchy or hanbatsu emerged as a powerful fore.\n\nThe hanbatsu or oligarchy was composed of the leaders of the Meiji Restoration. These people were bound by regional ties and by the fact that they had led the country through the change from the Tokugawa to the Meiji period. The two dominant regions were Satsuma and ~ h o s h uand these regions supplied most of the members of the bureaucracy, the army, the Privy Council and the House of Peers, etc. The Meiji leaders came to be known as genro or elder statesman and they exercised the power embodied in the Imperial House.\n\nPost World War-1 Japan The cabinets so far had been formed by the genro or elder statesmen and they had alternatively nominated men from either the domain of Choshu or Satsuma. Thus-lto was from Choshu and Matsukata Masayoshi from Satsuma. Ito attempted to form a cabinet with party support but was opposed by the hanbatsu. In June 1898 the Kenseito, a party composed from earlier party elements, was formed and this represented a new force which provoked widely different reactions from the oligarchy. Ultimately the oligarchy chose to let the Kenseito form a cabinet. 1 The cabinet fonned by Itagaki and Okuma in June 1898 was consisted of members of the Kenseito and was the first party cabinet. This party had an absolute majority in the lower house with 244 of the 300 seats. However, in spite of the numerical strength the party was in a weak position. This was because: the ministers for the navy and the army, nominated by the respective services were opposed to the party, ' the party itself was formed by a merger of two groups who were divided over the question of raising taxes.\n\nTo meet the needs of military expansion the state needed to raise taxes. While the party was o p p e d to raisihg land taxes business and urban interests did not object this as long as the government followed a policy of economic expansion and greater public expenditure.\n\nThe collapse of the cabinet within four months demonstrated the fragdity of the alliance formed by these political groups who came together for very specific and i -temporaryreasons. Among the party ideologues there now emerged a view that it 4 was necessary to cooperate with the hanbatsu and Hoshi Tom, of the Kenseito, sought to work together with the hanbatsu. Yamagata,who formed a cabinet in November '1898,sought his support for an increase in the land tax. The party which had consistently opposed an increase in the land tax now bargained with the demand for nationalizing the railroads in return for which it supported the land tax bill. This bargaining represented the greater role played by the urban business and commercial interests.\n\nI\n\nThe parties upto now had been dominated by rural interests and they had pursued policies which reflected rural concerns and interests. The parties while vocal in their opposition to the hanbatsu also compromised when necessary. They were split by regional and personal loyalties. For example Itagaki was from Tosa and other factions were from Kyushu or Kanto. This regional and factional rivalry prevented unity and created intense rivalry. Moreover, the parties did not have any representation in the House of Peers and also, had no control over local politics as all key officials were appointed by the government. Thus the parties, themselves split and engaged in rivalry, were faced by the opposition of the oligarchy which controlled key institutions.\n\nThe importance of urban business interests is also seen in the revision of the electora law which lowered the tax qualification both for voters and candidates. This led to ar increase in the number of eligible voters from 502,000 in 1898 to 982,000 in 1900. The revision of the electoral districts also favoured urban areas where fewer people could elect a representative thus' increasing the urban presence in the Diet.\n\nIn September 1900 Ito Hirobumi formed the Friends of the Constitutional Government Party or Seiyukai as it was commonly known in Japanese. This represented Ito's goal which he had been arguing for that the government should form its own party and work to control the lower house. He had been opposed by Yamagata and other Meiji oligarchs. The alliance between the Kenseito and Yamagata had also proved to be short lived one as the party realized that no real concessions would be made by the oligarchy. Hoshi Toru, once he saw the futility of working with Yamagata, approached Ito and offered to work with him. Their interests coincided. The Seiyukai, formed by hanbatsu and party elements who sought stability in politics, was to dominate the political scene till the 1920s.\n\n..\n\nIto Hirobumi was opposed by Yamagaia Aritomo whose ideas of politics differed and Yamagata's faction remained important group within the h b a t s u or oligarchy. The groups now fi&ting for political power were the Seiyukai, the\n\nYamagata faction and the Kenseihonto which carried on the line from the Shimpoto. [n 1913 Katsura of the Yamagata faction formed the Constitutional Association 13fFriends and in 1916 it became the Kenseikai (Constitutional Association) which 13pposedIto's Seiyukai.\n\nFrom the Russo-Japanese war onwards (1904 to 1912) political power was alternatively shared by Katsura Taro, of the Yamagata faction who led' three cabinets and Saionii Kinmochi who had become head of the Seiyukai and who formed ~ w o cabinets. In this period the most important Seiyukai leader was Hara Takeshi who was to become the first commoner Prime Minister. He was a partyman and helped to build the Seiyukai as an influential party with a strong organization spread throughout Japan. His political strategy was to ally with the Yamagata faction rather than work with the other political parties. Hara and the Seiyukai pursued a \"positive policy\". Before the Shio-Japanese war the parties had tried to limit government spending but now Hara tried to increase government spending in building railroad lines, improving harbours and communiption networks. These expenditures served to channel finances to local communities and helped the Seiyukai to build up its influence. Hara also tried to build up support in the House of Peers though this policy was successful only in 1920 when some groups within the Peers came to support the Seiyukai.\n\nHara, while he built up the machinery and influence, did not support the demand for universal suffrage. The demand which first surfaced in the 1910s was again revived in 1919-20 and the country witnessed large scale demonstrations all over. Intellectuals as well as labour and party leaders were active in this movement. However, Hara was doubtful about supporting this demand because he thought that this would be giving in to popular pressure. He felt that such a step should be taken giadually. This led to the dissolution of the house and general elections in which the Seiyukai emerged as the largest party. The opposition parties increased their strength in urban areas suggesting that the demand for universal suffrage was largely an urban. demand.\n\nThe relationship between the Seiyukai and the Yamagata faction was not a stable and consistent one but rather marked by divergent pulls and pressures. The Yamagata faction had to rely on the Seiyukai because of its strength. It,could not form an effective anti-Seiyukai coalition with elements of the Kenseihonto and other small factions. The Kenseihonto was split with some favouring an alliance with the Seiyukai while others supported the idea of working with the Yamagata faction. The balance which was struck lasted till 1912- 1913 when the Taisho political crisis occurred.\n\nThe pattern of alliance and cooperation which was created in this period represents, according to some scholars, a policy of joi togo or implicit mutual understanding between two forces. This means that there was an implied understanding between the forces of the government and the political parties and they worked within this commonly accepted framework. However, it is also important to note that the oligarchy was drawn deeper into party politics and when Katsura Taro tried to break the Seiyukai domination he also formed a political party. The changes which Japan was passing through were also reflected ih the loss of power of the hanbatsu. In the early Meiji period the hanbatsu had been a closed and homogeneous group which had fought for common objectives and commanded widespread respect because of their role in the Restoration. Now this no longer held true and political power could be exercised by the political parties which could function to coordinate and reconcile conflicting interests.\n\nyour Progress 1 I. Discuss in about ten lines the attitude of Meiji oligarchy towards political parties.\n\nRiae of Political Parties\n\nIn 1921 y a r a Takeshi was assassinated and the cabinets formed after that had non-party members These three cabinets were formed after Takahashi Korekiyo, Hara's succesbr resigned after seven months in office. Kato Tomasaburo forrbed a transcendental cabinet and he was followed by Yamamoto Gomohyoe and then Kiyoura Keigo. During the Kiyoura cabinet the Kenseikai, Seiyukai and Reform Club started the second movement for the defense of the constitution and in the general elections of May 1924 they formed a coalition cabinet under the leadership of Kato Takaaki.\n\nIn this period some members broke away from the Seiyukai and in 1927 this group joined the Kenseikai to form the Rikken Minseito (Constitutional Democratic Paity). Earlier in 1925 the Reform Club had joined the Seiyukai. These two parties, the Seiyukai and the Kenseikai alternatively formed cabinets till 1932 when the Seiyukai Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated during the May 15 Incident. This period which is referred to as the period of \"party rule\" represented the flowering of \"Taisho democracy\".\n\nBy this time the genro who had been the political decision makers, making and breaking governments, had all died except for Saionji Kinmochi and the political parties had expanded their power and control. Mitani Taichiro argues that sii\n\n'\n\nconditions made it possiblefor the party cabinet system to function between 1924-1932:\n\ni) The House of Representatives had become by 1924 the \"chief arena for contests over control of the cabinet\" and it was more powerful than the House of Peers. The ideas of Minobe Tatsukichi, a constitutional expert, provided the ideological basis for party rule. He argued that the Imperial Diet was not an organ of state given power by the Emperor but \"representative of the people\". Towards this end he instituted small reforms in the selection of the House of Peers. Minobe's ideas were accepted in the bureaucracy and his work prescribed for entrance examinations for the judicial and bureaucratic services. iii) The Privy Council, established in 1888, had palyed a decisive role and served as a defense against the,growth of the power of political parties. Yamagata was the last powerful president of the Council and after 1924 its role declined. The last genro Saionji played a key role in reducing the role of the Privy Council. iv) There was gowing accommodation between the bureaucracy and the parties and the parties were being led by ex-bureaucrats such as Kato Takaaki, Tanaka Giichi, etc. I'his policy was begun in earnest by Hara Takeshi who actively cultivated the party-bureaucracy connection.\n\nv) The judiciary, which had been anti-party, was brought under party control by est'ablishing the jury system. Here also Hara cultivated judicial officers and through patronage won their support for the Seiyukai and for the jury system which became law in 1923, after Hara's death. vi) The relationship between the military and the parties was of crucial importance. The internataonal situation with the Washington Conference 1921-22 marked a period of arms limitation and this placed a curb on the army's plans for -expansion. In this context army leaders began to see the advantages of cooperating with the parties. Particularly after the death of Terauchi in 1919 and Yamagata in 1922 army leaders like Tanaka Giichi cooperated actively with Hara and the Seiyukai to build a modernized and technologically superior army. Along with this they helped to increase the importance of army reservist's associations. .Tanaka himself moved closer to the Seiyukai and in 1925 he became its president and remained so till he died in 1929.\n\nRise of Poltical Parties\n\nTanaka Giichi was not the only one to arrive at an accommodation with the army. There were others also but many opposed these moves and generals like Uehara Yusaku and his faction wanted to keep the army non-partisan and preserve its independence. As part of this they also advocated a policy of continental advance. These oppositions were kept under control and were to surface only later in 1930s whca a controversy arose over the London Naval Treaty. These conditions together made it possible for the political parties, according to Mitani Taichiro, to function till 1932 but once these conditions began to change party government became impossible.\n\nPost World War-I Japan 22 DECLINE OF POLITICAL PARTIES\n\nVarious factors contributed to the decline of political parties and in this Section we deal with some of these factors.\n\n22.5 External and Internal Factors The decline of the influence of political parties was created both by the changing international situation and the domestic pressures which strengthened the hands of the militarists. Externally the economic depression added to social tensions in Japan and the increasing strength of Chinese nationalism pressed on Japanese interests. In China Chiang Kai-Shek was gaining strength and Japan felt that her interests in Manchuria were threatened. The Washington system which had created a framework for cooperation and adjustment among the major powers was being undermined and Japan further felt that her interests were not being sufficiently protected.\n\nThe strength and influence of the army was expanding and this was happening at the expense of the political parties. The creation of Manchukuo showed the independence of the military. The internal situation was further complicated by the agricultural depression and the feeling that economic policies were benefiting the rich and big business.\n\nThese developments generated widespread criticism and debate. Criticism was directed against the weakness of political parties and their corruption. But much of the debate was concerned with the crisis facing the nation and how it could be resolved. In May 1932 the parties lost the post of prime minister and by 194 1 they had no place in the cabinets. The rapid decline and end of party rule was a product of these internal and external changes. The decade witnessed the rise to power of a new business elite as well as civilian and military bureaucracies and it also saw tensions in trying to build a national policy.\n\nIn 1926 there was a depression in the domestic economy and this was followed by a bank crisis in 1927 which forced the government: to carry out retrenchment in the government, to return to the gold standard, and rationalize and mechanize industry.\n\nThe situation worsened with the 1929 depression as incomes dropped and unemptoyrnent rose. The burden was felt with great severity in the rural areas and was further complicated by a bad harvest in certain areas in 1931.\n\nThe failure of the government led by Hamaguchi of the Minseito and its failure at the London Naval Conference (Japan did not want to accept any restriction on the tonnage of its navy but was forced to accept it) led to the assassination of Hamaguchi in 1930. The importance of right wing groups in politics and their terror tactics came to dominate the coming years. These groups were an expression of the sense of crisis that many felt the nation was facing and of the dissatisfaction with the policies of the political parties. Even though they were condemned many praised their actions as selfless and in the interest of the nation.\n\nIt was in this climate that army officers led the Kwangtung army and provoked the Manchurian incident in 1931 because they thought Japan's interests in Manchuria were being threatened. Manchuria became an independent state, Manchukuo, in September 1932 and though the League of Nations condemned the take over, the Wakatsukui cabinet was unable to do anything about it-rather many of its members- supported the army. Inukai Tsuyoshi who succeeded Wakatsuki was president of the Seiyukai and he was the last party prime minister. Inukai's attempt to negotiate with the Chinese and the worsening economic climate in Japan created a climate ripe for terrorism and he was assassinated on May 15, 1932.\n\nThe next cabinet came in a period perceived as one of national emergency and it was formed by Admiral Saito Makoto who was chosen by Saionji - the last genro. The cabinet was supported by parties in the hope that they would recover their 12\n\nPost World War-I Japan an agency for government's mass mobilization. In effect the various measures to , create new institutions to serve Japan as an expanding power did not succeed and the old institutions and ministries established under the Meiji government continued. The Second World War was qsed to build uniformity of opinion and stifle dissent but according to Gordon Berger they failed to create a new totalitarian order. Political competition was as present under the cabinet of General Tojo as it had been earlier. The decision to surrender in 1945 marked the collapse of this system for the political elites had to seek the direct intervention of the Emperor who had remained insulated from the political system.\n\nCheck Your Progress 2 1.

In this hostile environment political parties and their supporters deriving their strengths from native traditions as well as Western itleas built a system in which they could exercise some power. This, they were able to do by compromising with the Meiji oligarchy.\n\nThe Meiji oligarchy also found that within the constitutional framework to run the. country they had to work in concert with the political parties. Thus party governmeilts did not take radical measures but worked within the Meiji system.\n\n'The socialist and later communist parties and other radical groups were unable to build a widespread mass movement. Yet, they did function and were able to express the longings of the people who were undergoing the problems created by industrial development.\n\nThe military because of its independence from Diet control and its perceptions of Japanese security interests gradually undermined the democratic process and brought down party cabinets which did not subscribe to its views. But it too could not impose a truly totalitarian order and even during its heyday political competition went on. It is because of this that the nature of Japanese \"fascism\" is very different from what occurred in Europe. Whether Japan witnessed a period of \"fascism\" is highly debatable and most Western scholars do not subscribe to this view (S& Unit 23).. This is not to say that the system was not democratic and that Japan was not indulging in militarist adventures abroad. Finally, it should be noted that the party system was integrated into the Meiji structure and it did allow competing interests to negotiate thcir competing demands.\n\n22 KEY WORDS\n\nAmbiguity : Double meaning.\n\nOligarchy : State governed by small group of persons.\n\nRetrenchment : Reduce expenditure of the government\n\nUniversal suffrage :Adult franchise.\n\n22 ANSWERS TO CHECK YOUR PROGRESS\n\nEXERCISES\n\nCheck Your Progress 1 1.
