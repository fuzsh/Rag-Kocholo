        "text": "“Hanaseba wakaru” (literally, “If we could talk, you would understand”) were the famous dying words uttered by Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai (1855-1932) to his assassins, who gunned him down in the so-called May 15 Incident of 1932, an attempted coup.\n\nNo other words could have better revealed the persona of the quintessential statesman that Inukai was--a politician who knew his job was to use words to explain, persuade and get things done, even when confronted by violent, self-righteous terrorists.\n\nI used to think Inukai’s sense of duty was shared by politicians, by and large. But I was apparently wrong.\n\nReports of alleged slush funds created by a Liberal Democratic Party faction, once led by the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, have shaken me awake.\n\nThis issue obviously raises any number of questions. But strangely, nobody has uttered any coherent explanation, including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nAll I hear are inane comments, such as “we’ll deal with this appropriately,” which mean nothing. If this isn’t “empty talk,” then what is?\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno and other senior LDP members are resorting to a chorus of their go-to phrase for skirting around an inconvenient situation--“I refrain from commenting.”\n\nOnce politicians stop trying to speak meaningful words, they should know they will no longer be able to appeal to the hearts of the public at large.\n\nIt is pathetic in the first place that distinguished personages such as the public’s elected representatives are busy systematically amassing a slush fund.\n\nThey couldn’t be in need of money, what with their large salaries and the government’s generous subsidies for political parties. And let’s not forget that they can spend up to 1 million yen ($6,790) a month in what used to be called the postage, communication, travel and accommodation allowance--no receipts necessary.\n\nAnd if that’s not enough, then all they need to do is indicate their reasons and ask the public for more money.\n\nA passage from “The Analects of Confucius” popped up in my head and wouldn’t go away. It goes to the effect, “Status and wealth obtained by dishonest means are as unreliable and fleeting as floating clouds for me.”\n\nDoesn’t the LDP have any lawmakers who truly value their words and right the wrong?\n\n--The Asahi Shimbun, Dec. 6\n\n* * *\n\nVox Populi, Vox Dei is a popular daily column that takes up a wide range of topics, including culture, arts and social trends and developments. Written by veteran Asahi Shimbun writers, the column provides useful perspectives on and insights into contemporary Japan and its culture."
