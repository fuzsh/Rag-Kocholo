        "text": "Universal suffrage was enacted into law in Japan in 1925 under a coalition government formed the previous year by the two major parties, Kenseikai and Seiyūkai. The law abolished an existing tax qualification for voting, expanding the electorate from three million to twelve and one-half million adult males. The Kenseikai had endorsed universal suffrage in late 1919, after an internal debate which began about a year earlier. The Seiyūkai by contrast accepted universal suffrage only in 1924, after several years of expressly rejecting it. This article traces the stages whereby these parties became committed to the legislation, and also examines the reaction to the issue on the part of other elements which had at least a potential voice in this legislation: the nonparty cabinets which governed from 1922 to 1924, the privy council, the House of Peers, and the genro, or elder statesmen.\n\n2 According to one account, the Kenseikai leadership was able only with great effort to prevent universal suffrage from being adopted as party policy. Takayoshi, Matsuo, “Daiichiji taisengo no fusen undō, 1918–1920” [The universal suffrage movement after World War I, 1918–1920], in Kiyoshi, Inoue, ed., Trishōki no seiji to shakai [Politics and society in the Taishō period] (Tokyo: Iwanami, 1969), p. 165Google Scholar. Hereafter cited as Taishōkf In addition to the two-yen tax qualification, the Kenseikai bill proposed to enfranchise also males over twenty-five who had a middle school education, provided they were not dependent on others for their livelihood. The bill would have given the vote to an estimated 3,600,000.\n\n3 “Ingai yori futsū senkyo wo kyōyō seyō” [Let us persistently demand universal suffrage from outside the diet], Tōhō Jiron, IV (Jan. 1919), 32–7. In 1917 he had advocated a “tenfold” increase in the electorate. “Senkyoken kakuchō undō no kyūmu” [The urgent need for a suffrage expansion movement], Shin Nihon, VII (June 1917), 13–7. A 1904 graduate from Tokyo University, Imai went to Tientsin in 1907 at the invitation of the Chinese government to teach law. He was dismissed from this position by the Yuan Shih-k+Bai government in 1913 for his support of the southern revolutionaries. He went to China again in 1915 as an adviser to the military regime in Yunnan. After his return to Japan he opened a law practice in Osaka, and was elected to the diet in 1917. His activities on behalf of universal suffrage earned him the appellation of fusen no kami—idiomatically perhaps “Mister Universal Suffrage.”\n\n5 Shugiin Jimukyoku [House of Representatives, General Affairs Office], Teikoku Gikai Shugiin iinkai giroku [Minutes of the committee proceedings of the House of Representatives of the Imperial Diet], 41st diet, sec. 5·7, Feb. 28, 1919, p. 40, and Mar. 1, 1919, pp. 45–46. Hereafter cited as linkai giroku. Miki was a major protagonist of universal suffrage in the Kenseikai debates in January 1919. He had been elected to the Tokyo city assembly in 1914, and was elected to the diet from Tokyo in 1915. He exhibited a lifelong penchant for the mechanics of politics which earned him the sobriquet of yaji shogun—perhaps “king of the hecklers.” He played a leading role in the return to power after 1952 of conservative politicians purged during the allied occupation.\n\n6 Takao, Saitō, “Senkyoken kakuchō oyobi senkyo kusei ron” [Suffrage expansion and the electoral district system], Taiyō, XXV (Feb. 1919), IIIGoogle Scholar; Seizaburō, Shinobu, Taishō seiji shi [Political history of the Taishō era] (Tokyo: Kawade Shobō, 1951–52), III, 858Google Scholar. A member of the diet since 1912, Saitō Takao in later years held important positions in the Minseitō, successor party to the Kenseikai. He was also the author of several treatises on Japanese and comparative government. He gained a measure of international fame as a result of his expulsion from the diet in 1940 for his criticism of Japan's conduct of the war in China.\n\n8 Saitō, p. III. The same point was made by the Kenseikai's Takemura Yoshisada in the committee hearings, linkai giroku, 41st diet, sec. 5·7, Mar. 4, 1919, p. 68. In 1919, the number of persons paying taxes over ten yen was about the same in the land tax category as in the other two—business and income—combined (1,688,497 in the former; 1,620,676 in the latter). However, in the three to ten yen bracket, those paying land tax greatly outnumbered those paying the other two kinds (2,161,923 to 216,532). Ōkurahrō Shuzeikyoku [Ministry of Finance, Tax Bureau], Shuzeikyoku dai yonjūrokkaitōkei nempō sho [Forty-sixth annual statistical report of the tax bureau] (Tokyo, 1920), tables 22, 35. These figures do not permit precise inferences about the impact of the 1919 law, since some taxpayers could be represented in more than one category, and some by reason of age or sex may have been ineligible for the vote in any case. One can state that at the most 216,532 of the approximately 1,500,000 new voters under the 1919 law paid any tax other than the land tax.\n\n9 According to government estimates in 1919, the cities accounted for 12·3% of the total voters under the existing law, and this would drop to 10·1% under the government's 1919 bill, linkai giroku, 41st diet, sec. 5·7, Mar. 1, 1919, p. 46. At the end of 1918 the fifty-six cities which constituted separate election districts (as given in Yamazaki Kazuo, Dai Nihon seisen kiroku shi [A record history of Japanese political campaigns] [Tokyo: Seisandō, 1930], pp. 521–29) alone accounted for over 16% of the population. All cities accounted for over 18%. Naikaku Tōkeikyoku [Cabinet Statistical Office], Nihon Teikoku dai sanjühachi tōkei nenkan [Thirty-eighth statistical yearbook of the Japanese Empire] (Tokyo: Tokyo Tōkei Kyōkai, 1920), tables 18, 19.\n\n11 The Kenseikai bills in 1920 and 1921 restricted the vote to persons who were “earning an independent living” (dokuritsu no seikei wo itonamu). The Ministry of Home Affairs put the number of males over twenty-five meeting this requirement at 9,448,664 as of August 1920. (Asahi, Jan. 22, 1924, p. 2). The clause became a source of intraparty disruption, and was removed from the bills which the party presented in 1922 and 1923. By then, in the eyes of some including the Kenseikai, a proposal containing the clause was not acceptable as universal suffrage. In 1919, however, the issue was not phrased in those terms, and in this sense, from the perspective of the time, late 1919 marks the conversion of the Kenseikai to universal suffrage. The clause was indeed debated at that time among the party's universal suffrage supporters, but they were all inclined to regard it as a secondary detail. Most of them in fact favored the clause, and appear to have expected, incorrectly, that the Kokumintō universal suffrage bill would also include it (Hōchi, Nov. 28, 1919, p. 2). Real pressure on the Kenseikai leadership to remove the clause began only in 1920, and the most prominent argument was the tactical one that the clause prevented the party from joining forces on universal suffrage with the Kokumintō and other groups.\n\n16 I have discussed this subject in some detail in a paper, “The Safety Valve Argument for Universal Suffrage in Japan,” presented at the Columbia University Seminar on Modern Japan on May 14, 1971. To summarize briefly, this argument was a major preoccupation with many politicians at this time, and yet there were striking variations in the intensity of this concern—including refusal to accept it—and in the terms in which it was expressed.\n\n17 For general characterizations, see Rōyama Masamichi, Seiji shi [Political history], Vol. II of Gendai Nihon bummei shi [History of modern Japanese civilization] (Tokyo: Tōyō Keizai Shimpō Sha, 1940), p. 428, and Myōga Fusakichi, Nihon seitō no gensei [The present state of political parties in Japan] (Tokyo: Nihon Hyōron Sha, 1929), pp. 237, 253, and 287, as well as the statements by Imai Yoshiyuki and the Kenseikai members cited above. The proportion of urban to total support in elections from 1915 to 1924, in terms of both votes cast and seats gained, consistently runs higher for the Kenseikai than for the Seiyūkai, although there are discrepancies between various sets of statistics adduced on this point, and all are not equally conclusive. See for example Kanechika Teruo, “Dai yonjūni gikai e no fusen an no jōtei to kakutō no taido” (The Attitudes of the Political Parties toward the Universal Suffrage Bill presented before the 42nd Session of the Diet), Waseda Seiji Keizai Gaku Zasshi (The Waseda Journal of Political Science and Economics), No. 156 (Apr. 1959), p. 129; Shinobu Scizaburō, Taishō demokurashii shi [History of Taishō democracy] (Tokyo: Nihon Hyōron Shin Sha, 1954–59), III, 913; and Ōtsu Jun‘ichirō, Dai Nihon kensei shi [Constitutional history of Japan] (Tokyo: Hōbunkan, 1927–28), X, 1063–65, 1074–76. Statistics aside, the fact that this appears to have been the image, to some extent the self-image, of the Kenseikai, may have some relevance to speculation about urban support as a source of Kenseikai interest in universal suffrage.\n\n20 The pro-Seiyūkai bias of the districting system in Hara's election law may have stimulated some in the Kenseikai to favor universal suffrage as the best vehicle, although not logically necessary, for changing that law. But it too was already an accomplished fact in the spring of 1919. Moreover, as noted above (see footnote 12), that law was also cited in late 1919 as an argument for the Kenseikai not proposing universal suffrage.\n\n28 Inukai, a lifelong party politician, had been president of the Kokumintō, and headed the Reform Club at the time he became Yamamoto's minister of communications. Inukai's presence did not make Yamamoto's a party cabinet, much less a Reform Club one, quite apart from the fact that technically the Reform Club was not a political party. For Inukai's views on “national” parties, see Kumakichi, Uzaki, Inukai Tsuyoshi den [Biography of Inukai Tsuyoshi] (Tokyo: Seibundō, 1932), pp. 330–334Google Scholar. Gotō, who had been a physician, colonial official, and president of the South Manchurian Railway, was a major figure in the founding of the Dōshikai, predecessor of the Kenseikai, but pursued his political career mostly outside of the parties: as a member of the House of Peers, mayor of Tokyo 1920–24, and holder of several cabinet posts, including minister of home affairs under Yamamoto. For his views on party reconstruction, see Seizaburō, Shinobu, Gotō Shimpei (Tokyo: Hakubunkan, 1941), pp. 329–330.Google Scholar\n\n29 On the “independent living” qualification, see footnote II, above. The liberal view in the cabinet was ascribed to Gotō, Inukai, and the justice minister, Hiranuma Kiichirō. Asahi, Dec. 27, 1923, pp. 27–1, 27–2. Hiranuma was noted as a protagonist of traditionalist ultranationalism in the 1930's. His position on suffrage came as a surprise to Inukai who, upon broaching the subject to Hiranuma, was told forthwith that the latter had favored the measure for “many years.” Hisashi, Iwasaki, Hiranuma Kiichirō den [Biography of Hiranuma Kiichirō] (Tokyo: Kaisei Sha, 1939), p. 263.Google Scholar\n\n31 Shinobu, Taishō seiji shi, IV, 1112–14, describes such a meeting as taking place December 6. So also does Kisaka Jun‘ichirō, citing the newspaper Kyoto Hinode, Dec. 8 (P.M. ed.). “Kakushin Kurabu ron” [On the Reform Club], Taishoki, p. 310. Asahi, Dec. 13, 1923 (P.M. ed.), p. 3, reported a meeting “recently” with the same personnel. Shinobu also gives a direct quotation (without a source) in which the Seiyūkai's Okazaki Kunisuke expressed to Yamamoto vivid, if not hysterical, concern lest universal suffrage come into force immediately. Shortly thereafter, in early 1924, Okazaki sought unsuccessfully to persuade the Kenseikai to a more conservative view on universal suffrage. See below, footnote 37· Ironically, he played a key role, at some cost to his position in the Seiyūkai, in achieving passage of the universal suffrage law in 1925.\n\n34 Ishida Takeshi states that the parties did not get involved in the universal suffrage issue until after the formation of the joint movement against Kiyoura. Kindai Nihon seiji kōzō no kenhyū [Studies on the political structure of modern Japan] (Tokyo: Mirai Sha, 1956), pp. 168, 180Google Scholar. This appears to refer to the parties without exception, but it must be read in the light of the Kenseikai's official adoption of universal suffrage in 1919, and the subsequent yearly presentation of universal suffrage bills in the diet by the Kenseikai and the Kokumintō or the Reform Club. Ishigami Ryōhei outlines the situation precisely, in stating that at this time, the Seiyūkai alone did not come out for universal suffrage, and that therefore a joint three-faction universal suffrage plank could not be issued. Hara Kei botsugo [After Hara Kei] (Tokyo: Chūō Kōron Sha, 1960), p. 148.Google Scholar\n\n41 The peers also proposed to exclude heads of noble houses, which probably would have affected few people, the issue being largely symbolic (Shinobu, Taishō seiji shi, IV, 1253); and to raise the residence requirement from the government bill's six months, to one year. There were an estimated 13,400,000 males over twenty-five meeting the former requirement, and about 200,000 less meeting the latter. Koyama, p. 116; Saka Chiaki, “Futsū senkyo hō yōkō” [The gist of the universal suffrage law], Kaizō, VII (May 1925), 87. By contrast, the peers' livelihood qualification would probably have cut the electorate to about 9,600,000. Asahi, Mar. 25, 1925, p. 25–2 and Mar. 29, p. 29–2; Shinobu, Taishō seiji shi, IV, 1255."
