        "text": "The problem of historical explanation is presently engaging the deep interest of philosophers of history. Accepting the view that writing history partakes of the artistic in that the same material may be used, with controls, to support different conclusions, we will attempt to reevaluate certain premises on the early nature of parliamentary government under the Meiji Constitution. To facilitate the discussion, however, we should first present the traditional views on the development of parliamentary government prior to and soon after the promulgation of the Meiji Constitution.\n\n3 Hara Kei (Takashi) believed that this was the result of the limited franchise and public apathy.

Shigetaka, Fukuchi's “Kensei shoki no daigishi no seikaku” (“Characteristics of the Representatives of the First Phase of Constitutional Government”), Nihon rekishi, No. 79 (12 1954), 28–33Google Scholar is in the main a refutation of some of the findings in Suematsu's articles.\n\n6 Confusion may arise from two different dates which may be given as the beginning of the Diet session. Clement's “Table of Sessions of the Diet,” in Ernest W. Clement and Etsujirō Uyehara, M. P., “Fifty Sessions of the Japanese Imperial Diet,” TASJ 2nd Ser., II (Tokyo, 1925)Google Scholar, gives the date as November 29, 1890. See also, Yanaga, Chitoshi, Japan Since Perry (New York, 1949), p. 216Google Scholar. Uyehara Etsujirō's “Chronology” in his The Political Development of Japan, 1867–1909 (London 1910)Google Scholar, cites November 25. See also Scalapino, Robert A., Democracy and the Party Movement in Prewar Japan, The Failure of the First Attempt (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1954), p. 154Google Scholar. Uyehara arrives at the earlier date by dating the beginning from the time the Diet is convoked [shōshū], while Clement considers the session begins when the formal opening ceremony with the Emperor in attendance is held [kaiin shiki], Uyehara's practice in his “Chronology” is recommended since important Diet business, such as the election of officers, is conducted immediately after the convoking of the Diet. See, e.g., Dai Nikon Teikoku Gikai shi [The Records of the Imperial Diet], I (Tokyo, 1926) 417–429Google Scholar; cf. “Gikai shichijūnen no ayumi” (“The Diet's Seventy Years”), Asahi, 12 20, 1960.Google Scholar\n\n8 Yoshitake, Oka, “Teikoku Gikai no kaisetsu” (“Inauguration of the Imperial Diet”), Kokka gakkai zasshi, LVIII (01 1944), 46Google Scholar; Oka cites one good reason for equating the budget question with the first session: only six other bills were passed during this session. Oka, Gikai, pp. 74–76Google Scholar.

This thin volume is one of the richest sources on the first session, with articles by Kaishintō members who participated in it.\n\n13 Matsukata had, in the meantime, spoken again on February 5. Dai ikki Taikoku Gikai yōroku [A Record of Essential Matters in the First Imperial Diet], ed. Emori, Ueki (Tokyo, 1891), p. 280Google Scholar—a useful work which classifies events of the first session by subject matter. See also, Gikai shi, I, 835Google Scholar; Oka, Gikai, pp. 52–53Google Scholar. On January 20, the Diet building burned to the ground. The cause was apparently defective wiring. On January 29, the House of Peers began to meet at the Imperial Hotel and the House of Representatives at the former Engineering College [Kōbu daigakkō]. Oka, Gikai, p. 52Google Scholar; Kentarō, Kaneko, Itō Hirobumi den [Biography of Itō Hirobumi] II (Tokyo, 1943), 737Google Scholar; Wigmore, John H., “Parliamentary Days in Japan. With Illustrations,” Scribner's Magazine, X (08 1891), 244.Google Scholar\n\n15 Itō was at this time president of the House of Peers. He was clearly unwilling to serve as the president. See Kaneko, , Itō, II, 702–732Google Scholar. Itō's attitude underscores the growing antagonism between Itō and Yamagata. In a letter written to Nakai Hiroshi at the time of his acceptance, Itō complained: “Although I greatly deplore stepping forward as president, we have exhausted all possibilities for a compromise solution and the only (other) alternative is to open a major (political) fight. I would like to have you look with sympathy upon the unavoidable situation mentioned above.” Quoted in Kaneko, , itō, II, 731.Google Scholar\n\n17 Letter from Itō Miyoji to Itō, dated February 13, 1891, in Itō Hirobumi, compiler, Hisho ruisan: Takoku Gikai shiryō [Classified Collection of Private Papers: Materials on the Imperial Diet], I (Tokyo, 1934), 180Google Scholar. In this letter, Itō Miyoji is repeating back to Itō what he reported to Yamagata as Itō's original outburst. Hara Kei supports Itō's views. “Of late, the government's attitude toward the Diet has been extremely confused and its policy pronouncements have always been ill-timed. There is much room for concern about the future. Mutsu [Munemitsu] got up from his sick bed to visit Yamagata to discuss problems, but he still doesn't know what the government's policies are.” Hara, Nikki, I 522.Google Scholar\n\n18 Gikai shi, I, 927–928Google Scholar; Oka, Gikai, pp. 55–56Google Scholar; Ōtsu, Kensci shi, III, 583–587Google Scholar. In an extremely long footnote, Oka discusses Yamagata's speech. Oka says that the speech was based on a draft written by Itō Miyoji, and that it must have been written early in February because Yamagata showed the draft to Inoue Kowashi on February 4. In the meantime, Yamagata had made his February 10th speech. On February 11th and 12th Itō saw Itō Miyoji and the former had some harsh words to say about Yamagata. Said Itō: “Recently, I advised the prime minister that to prevent [the nation's] headlong plunge into danger, he should unequivocally set forth the government's fixed and unchanging national policies for the past twenty years. I did so, believing that this would have a most salutary effect. The prime minister did not avail himself of the golden opportunity. Rather, when he did speak, he gave a short, meaningless, valueless, ineffectual speech. He does not make use of the proper medicine at the right time as prescribed by the doctor. The first stage of the illness has passed, and the second stage is rapidly passing, and still he hesitates and doubts the orders of the doctor…. When opportunity is lost, wrong methods are used, and the patient is on the verge of death, it is then too late.” Oka, Gikai, pp. 57–62Google Scholar; Itō, Teikoku Gikai shiryō, I, 181–182.Google Scholar\n\n26 Oka, Gikai, p. 68Google Scholar. See also, Hakuai, Saiga, Ōe Tenya denki [Biography of Ōe Tenya] (Tokyo, 1926), pp. 572–576Google Scholar. There seems to be one piece of indirect evidence that bribery may have been used sometime during the first session. In a letter to Itō, dated December 12, probably in 1891, Mutsu speaks of “the customary method of corruption” with which the government hopes to inveigle the Diet members, and Mutsu expressed fears that this method would prove effective “in this session.” Quoted in Itō ke monjo [The Itō Papers] unpubl. LII, 190a.\n\n31 Itō appears to have contradicted himself when he ordered the consecutive dissolutions of the 5th and the 6th sessions of the Diet. These dissolutions were only indirectly related to contitutional questions. Japan at this time was on the verge of realizing treaty revision. The opposition was making matters uncomfortable for the government by attacking it for “weakness” in the face of foreign governments. Itō, therefore, had to show the foreign governments dramatically that he was master in his own house.\n\n33 “Mainly as a result of the Sino-Japanese War and the growing armament and colonial enterprises which followed in its wake, the expenditures of the national government tripled from 1893 to 1903.” Lockwood, William W., The Economic Development of Japan, Growth and Structural Change 1868–1938 (Princeton, 1954), p. 35Google Scholar. Cf. the problem of the Tokugawa rulers as described by John W. Hall with the budget problem faced by the Meiji oligarchs. Hall, Tanuma Okitsugu: Forerunner of Modern Japan (Cambridge, Mass., 1955), pp. 5–6Google Scholar. Even without an expanding budget, the government would suffer if a budget was not passed by the Diet and the previous year's budget had to be used. This argument was made by Miura Katsundo, another participant in the first session. His reasoning was: The Finance Law strictly stipulates that the respective ministries cannot spend money for any other purpose than for that which the money was specifically appropriated. The aims and structure of each year's budget differ from year to year, and that which is considered important one year may not be in another year. Hence the government, when it chooses or is forced to use the previous year's budget, will often find that it will have money to spare for activities it considers not vital while it faces fiscal starvation for critical projects. See his “Zennendo no yosan wo shikkō suru rigai” (“The Pros and Cons of Carrying Over the Previous Year's Budget”), in Dai ikki kokkai shimatsu, pp. 89–98.Google Scholar\n\n35 Ike, Nobutaka, The Beginnings of Political Democracy in Japan (Baltimore, 1950), p. 188Google Scholar. Scalapino tends toward this point of view, though less positively. For example, he cites Suzuki Anzō's view that the nine years between the announcement that a Constitution would be granted and the actual promulgation gave the government nine vital years “to mold die interpretation of the document so as to freeze the status quo.” Scalapino, Democracy and the Party Movement, pp. 86–87Google Scholar, footnote 129. See also his comments, pp. 86–87, 149–151. Cf. Scalapino, Robert A. and Masumi, Junnosuke, Parties and Politics in Contemporary Japan (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1962), p. 13.Google Scholar\n\n38 Kalō Seinosuke, describing a period slightly later than the time under consideration, recalled: “Those who belonged to government parties were extremely unpopular. There were incredible stories to the effect that [members of government parties] would wait for dark and cover their heads with hoods when they visited a state minister's residence. Even those who were disinterested felt sorry for the way government party men were rejected by the people.” Quoted in Itō Hirobumi Hiroku [Private Papers of Itō Hirobumi], ed. Atsushi, Hiratsuka, (Tokyo, 1929), p. 122Google Scholar. On June 25, 1892, Hara Kei was asked to join the Kokumin Kyōkai, a quasi-government party. Hara refused on the ground that, “these parties never succeed.” Hara, Nikki, II (a), 45Google Scholar. For other comments on the status of government parties in the eyes of the public, see Ōkuma Shigenobu, “Nihon no seitō” (“Japanese Political Parties”) in Meiji kensei keizai shi ron [Discourses on Meiji Constitutional and Economic History] (Tokyo, 1919), p. 140Google Scholar; Anzō, Suzuki, Jiyū minken undō shi [A History of the Movement for Parliamentary Government] (Tokyo, 1948), p. 90.Google Scholar\n\n48 McLaren, , Political History, pp. 130–131Google Scholar. Osatake Takeki cites the example of Nagasaki Prefecture, where no one opposed the prefectural governor when he decided that Matsuda Masahisa was to be the president of the Assembly. However, once Matsuda assumed office, the Nagasaki Prefectural Assembly ceased being simply an organ of inquiry, and even the governor was “treated as a child” by Matsuda.

It is memorable … that we have been able to demonstrate that the parliamentary system is not indigeneous (sic) to Europe and America alone, and that it can be introduced without shedding a drop of blood.” Quoted in Japan Weekly Mail, 12 6, 1890, p. 558Google Scholar. See also Itō's speech in the House of Peers, 1891, quoted in Kaneko, Itō, II, 741–742Google Scholar; Itō's speech at Ōtsu, 1898, quoted in Japan Weekly Mail, 05 4, 1898, p. 432.Google Scholar\n\n52 Kaneko was another of Itō's intimate supporters, and, with Inoue Kowashi and Itō Miyoji, closely connected with the drafting of the Meiji Constitution. He studied law at Harvard from October, 1876 to November, 1878. A promising young bureaucrat, Kaneko was working for Terajima Munenori in the Genrō-in when he first came to Itō's attention. Kaneko had drawn up a long list of questions on specific constitutional problems, probably to embarrass Itō, who was in Europe. The fact that Itō did not let this deter him from appointing talent where he found it is typical of him.\n\n53 Quoted in Uyehara, Political Development, pp. 220–221Google Scholar. Matsukata's February 16th speech, quoted earlier, should be recalled. See also Asahina, , Rōkjsha no omoide, pp. 24–25Google Scholar and Saiga, , Ōe Tenya denki, p. 570Google Scholar. National pride, of course, was also expressed in a more virulent manner. Sir Francis Piggot remembered: “And here is a curious illustration of this nationalist spirit. If this unfortunate translation [into English] of the Constitution is criticized, the ready answer of youthful officials today is … ‘Well, it does not much matter. What has been done for the foreigner is quite sufficient. Japan is for the Japanese.’” “New Japan;” The Fortnightly Review LII (New Series) No. 309, p. 337.Google Scholar\n\n56 The Kobe Weekly Chronicle, editorializing on the suggestion made later in the decade by Katsura Tarō that the Constitution be suspended, wrote: “Such a course would almost certainly mean the indefinite postponement of Treaty Revision, and in die view of Japanese of all shades of opinion, everything must be subordinated to the consummation of Japan's ambition in this respect.” July 2, 1898, pp. 577–578. See also, Tokio, Kimura, “Fukuzawa Yukichi no Meiji kempō kan” (Fukuzawa Yukichi's Views on the Meiji Constitution”), Shikan (06 1953) p. 48Google Scholar; Itō ke monjo, VII, 420a–420b.\n\n58 Ozaki Yukio had this to say about the relationship between the two men: “They constantly fought each other, and there was unending friction. Friends on the surface, bitter enemies below the surface … [One day] Yamagata and I were reminiscing. Yamagata was using extremely honorific terminology with a great deal of feeling. I thought that he was speaking about the former Emperor. However, on listening closely, I was surprised to note that Yamagata was talking about a clash with Itō. He must have used honorific language on purpose to convey a sense of ridicule.” Yukio, Ozaki, Minken tōsō shichijūnen [My Seventy-Year Struggle for Democracy] (Tokyo, 1952), pp. 33–34.Google Scholar\n\n60 “The friction within the Meiji government stemmed from the propensity of cabinet members to feudalistically adhere to their own spheres of influence. This was the situation since the Restoration. The aim of the cabinet system created by Itō was to unify and strengthen the cabinet and to eliminate these conflicts. However, because [Itō] merely created it to give the government a modern appearance without infusing it with a democratic foundation, he was unable to root out this deeply entrenched tendency toward factionalism.” Shisō, Hattori and Yoshinaga, Irimajiri, Kindai Nihon jimbutsu seiji shi [A Political History of Modern Japan as Seen Through the Personalities Involved], I (Tokyo, 1955–1956), 180.Google Scholar\n\n63 Japan Chronicle, 11 4, 1909, p. 805Google Scholar. “Ōkuma always said that Itō was a coward. I do not know whether Itō was a coward, but he was extremely prudent, thorough and conciliatory. He hated to do things by fighting with people.… He tried to accomplish everything with as much harmony as possible.” Watanabe Ikujirō, Meiji shi kenkyū [Studies in Meiji History] (Tokyo, 1944), p. 165.Google Scholar"
