        "text": "The structure of the Meiji constitution placed Hirohito at the top of the state with a wider range of authority and influence that made him the most powerful political figure in Japan. He had the authority to enact constitutional amendments, determine administrative organizations, grant pardons, and determine military organization. Chief priest of the nation, he could issue imperial ordinances without legislative check. He could conclude treaties and no parliamentary consent was required. He was able to declare war and make peace, and the Diet was not allowed to intervene. As stated in, Article 11 of the constitution, the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy were under the emperor’s direct control. Articles 11 to 13 took away matters from the civilian government and placed them under the responsibility of the emperor. The military was outside of the authority of the civil government, and consequently before any action or operation by military troops, the emperor was to be advised most notably by the Chief of the General Staff Office of the Army and the Chief of the Naval Staff Board.\n\nAt the start of his reign on December 25, 1926, Hirohito avoided implicating himself in the defense of the country. He relegated this role to the generals and admirals in the army and navy. With his entourage, he preferred to concentrate on domestic affairs. As he assumed control of the empire, Japan was at the stage of a crisis with a military-industrial complex that was seizing more and more executive power. The Diet had limited power and could not make important decisions. Generals and admirals were more powerful than the rest of the Diet. They had direct access to the emperor and could veto any policies that were unfavorable to them, for example opposing cuts to the military budget by the Diet, and more. The officers in the army and navy very often intervened to impose their choice when it came to governmental cabinet picks. As time passed, although Hirohito maintained a very low interest in military affairs, generals and admirals wanted him to participate more and more in questions related to the plan to strengthen Japan's military capability.\n\nThis senior seminar paper analyzes how Japan's foreign policy evolved during the Meiji Period to bring it from a developing nation into one of the few great powers of the world. Each of the ruling oligarchs of this period used their political power to steer Japan in the direction that they thought would be best for the future.\n\nAnnotation This article discusses the role of Emperor Meiji in modernization of Japan and her victory in Sino-Japanese War (1894-95). After the Sino-Japanese War the flow of history completely changed in East Asia and China lost its power in Far East. The author describes the reasons of the war emerged between a tiny island and giant China and the emperor`s contributions leading to victory. Moreover, the author talks about Japan`s position in international relations in that era worldwide.\n\nOn December 25, 1926, Emperor Taishō died. On November 10, 1928, at twenty-five years old, Hirohito came to the throne. He became officially the 124th emperor of Japan. This marked Japan’s entry into the Shōwa era, meaning “radiant or enlightened peace.” According to the 2,600-year-old tradition, the emperor was regarded as a monarch of divine essence, for whom Article 3 of the constitution of February 11, 1889, enshrined the “sacred and inviolable” character of his person.8 The structure of the Meiji constitution and the de facto divine status inherited by birth placed Hirohito at the top of the state. He was the nation’s highest spiritual authority and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. All branches of government, including the Diet and the cabinet, had to refer to him before making any important decision.\n\nThe emperor of Japan has always been occupied an important position. Sometimes the emperor ruled the country by himself as the legitimate ruler and quite often he was used by the actual rulers of the country as a source of legitimacy. This was because of the myth suggesting that the Emperor of Japan is the grandson of Sun Goddess Amaterasu and thus have a divine source of legitimacy. Shoguns, noble families like Fujiwara family and finally the Sat-Cho revolutionaries of Meiji restoration used emperors’ legitimacy to rule the country.This paper examines the change of the image of emperor in the eyes of ordinary people and the use of Emperor by Meiji officials to create a public image which will unite the people and which will reinforce the construction of nation in Japan.\n\nAt the end of the 1800s, the internal fight for political and economic power in Japan took an ugly turn, including riots and tax revolts, and even plots to assassinate high government officials. From 1881 to 1888, corporate moguls quarreled among themselves, jockeyed for personal gain, and maneuvered to achieve their political and moral goals. On February 11, 1889, at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, Emperor Meiji proclaimed the new Constitution called the Meiji constitution. It was a despotic charter that vested absolute power in the emperor. The people's right to vote was limited to property owners, approximately 500,000 men, thus only slightly more than 1 percent of the population at the time. The legislature limited personal freedom by voting special laws. For example, the courts considered a man guilty if arrested, unless he could prove his innocence.\n\nJapan’s longest-reigning monarch, Emperor Hirohito, was born Michinomiya Hirohito, on April 29, 1901, in the Aoyama Palace in Tokyo. Hirohito was the first grandson of Emperor Mutsuhito and the first son of Crown Prince Yoshihito (later Emperor Taishō) and Princess Sadako (later Empress Teimei). Being the first male child in the family, Hirohito was destined to carry on the tradition of an imperial line whose descent is traced in legend from Amaterasu Omikami, the sun goddess in the pantheon of Shinto."
