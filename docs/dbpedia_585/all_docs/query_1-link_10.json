As the original leader and one of the founders of the Constitutional Nationalist Party, Inukai was considered as one of the respected elders of the Nationalist Party and, along with Koizumi Matajiro, representing the party's right-wing faction against the left-wing party elders, including Ozaki Yukio and Abe Isoo. He became the members of Nationalist Party's General Political Office from 1919 until his death in 1936.\n\nInukai served as the first Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Japan (equally to the office of Prime Minister) from February 16, 1919 to April 12, 1923. He then served as Minister of Communications on First Suzuki Government from April 12, 1923 to April 17, 1925, Minister of Education on First Nakano Government from April 17, 1925 to June 9, 1933, and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers as well as Minister of Foreign Affairs on Second Suzuki Government from June 9, 1933 to December 25, 1936."
