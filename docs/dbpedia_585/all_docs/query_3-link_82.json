Powell who stated that Mamoru Shigemitsu \"did 'all he could' to restore peace in Shanghai after the outbreak of hostilities there in 1932.\" Powell also recounted the movements of the Chinese 19th Route Army around Shanghai after the Manchurian Incident.

Barrett who \"believed that the incident at Wanping, near Marco Polo Bridge, was the 'carefully prepared excuse for the second stage of Japan's undeclared war on China.'\" Also discusses the defense cross-examination of Wang Len-chai, magistrate of Wanpinghsian and the introduction of the prosecution's witness, A. A. Dorrance, \"formerly manager of the Standard Oil Company in Hankow.\"\n\nMore Facts Shown on Military Training News Article\n\nDescription:\n\nReports on the testimony of Yukitoki Takikawa and Hyoe Ouchi regarding graduation requirements for Kyoto Imperial University (including mandatory military training and lectures).

Names specific policies taken by the Tojo government and the Five Year Plan for Manchuoka. At one point, the article states \"Prosecutor Sackett then attempted to delve into the autonomous movements that were launched in Mongolia and North China. Lawrence J. McManus, defense counsel, objected heatedly to the devastating statements made by Tanaka on the ground of irrelevancy, but Justice Webb declared that the issues before the Tribunal were so vast, multitudinous, involved and co-related that he could hardly judge what is and what is not relevant.\"\n\nJap Schoolboys Taught to Love War, Court Told News Article\n\nContributors:\n\nDescription:\n\nReports on the testimony of Lt. Col. Donald R. Nugent (who served as the head of Gen. MacArthur's civil information and education section).
