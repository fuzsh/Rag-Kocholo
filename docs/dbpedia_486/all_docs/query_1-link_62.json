        "text": "Emma Jones\n\nSchool of Law\n\nSenior Lecturer in Law\n\nDirector of Student Wellbeing for the School of Law.\n\nProfile\n\nI joined the Law School in January 2020. I am currently chairing the modules Remedies in Private Law, Digital Lawyering (undergraduate) and Legal Tech and Lawyering in the Digital Age (postgraduate). I also teach on the Law of Obligations. I am also Director of Student Wellbeing for the School of Law.\n\nPrior to joining Sheffield, I worked at The Open University Law School for five years as a Lecturer and Senior Lecturer. During my time there I was the director of my facultyâ€™s scholarship centre and one of the founders of the Open Justice Centre. My last role was as Law School Teaching Director.\n\nBefore moving into academia I was a solicitor in private practice, specialising in construction law. I also taught in the further education sector.\n\nMy research interests focus on the role of emotions and wellbeing in legal education and the legal profession and I have conducted a range of empirical work on these topics, as well as writing from a theoretical perspective.\n\nQualifications\n\nSenior Fellow of the Higher Education Authority\n\nAccredited Mediator, Clear ADR\n\nPhD, Keele University\n\nPGCE in Post-compulsory Education and Training, Manchester Metropolitan University\n\nMSc in Construction Law and Arbitration, Leeds Metropolitan University\n\nMA in Politics and Contemporary History, University of Salford\n\nPost-Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice, Nottingham Trent University\n\nBA (Joint Honours) in Politics and Contemporary History, University of Nottingham\n\nResearch interests\n\nMy research focuses on the role of emotions and wellbeing in legal education and the legal profession.\n\nIn terms of legal education, I have written on multiple intelligences and the importance of emotion, and also conducted empirical research into the wellbeing of online distance learning law students. I am interested in wellbeing in higher education more widely and in 2019 I was a member of the research team for Student Mindsâ€™ University Mental Health Charter.\n\nIn terms of the legal profession, I have written on the importance of emotional competence and conducted empirical work on wellbeing in legal practice. I lead the Fit for Law project, in partnership with the charity LawCare, which seeks to promote psychologically and emotionally healthier ways of working within law. I was a member of the Research Committee for LawCareâ€™s Life in the Law Report (2021). I am also a member of the International Bar Associationâ€™s Presidential Taskforce on Lawyer Wellbeing.\n\nAreas of Research Supervision\n\nLegal Education\n\nThe Legal Profession\n\nLaw and Emotions\n\nLaw and Wellbeing\n\nDigital Lawyering and Law Tech\n\nPublications\n\nGrants\n\nTeaching interests\n\nI believe that teaching and learning are not only cognitive experiences, but also involve emotions and feelings. It is therefore important that legal education is underpinned by a focus on inclusivity and wellbeing to create a safe and positive environment for students and educators to explore new, and often challenging, concepts.\n\nI also believe that learning should be as interactive and enjoyable as possible and seek to integrate a wide range of techniques and experiences into my teaching.\n\nTeaching activities\n\nUndergraduate\n\nPerspectives on the Legal Profession\n\nRemedies in Public Law\n\nDigital Lawyering\n\nPostgraduate\n\nLegal Tech and Lawyering in the Digital Age\n\nProfessional activities and memberships\n\nProfessional activities and recognition\n\nDeputy Editor, The Law Teacher Journal\n\nVice-Chair and Executive Committee Member, Association of Law Teachers\n\nTrustee, Socio-Legal Studies Association\n\nCo-Convenor, Law and Emotion Stream,Socio-Legal Studies Association Annual Conference\n\nCo-Chair, UK Chapter, International Society for Therapeutic Jurisprudence\n\nCo-founder, UK Law and Emotion Network\n\nSecretary, Legal Education Research Network\n\nMembership Secretary and Executive Committee Member, Association of Law Teachers\n\nMember, Legal Education Committee, Society of Legal Scholars\n\nAssociate Academic Fellow of the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple (formerly Academic Fellow from 2016-2019)\n\nEditor of the Journal of Commonwealth Law and Legal Education (2015-2019)\n\nRecent Invited Papers and Keynote Lectures\n\nInvited speaker and panellist, Life in the Law launch, September 2021.\n\nKeynote, Legal Education Section, Society of Legal Scholars Annual Conference, University of Exeter, 2020.\n\nInvited panellist, International Bar Association Webinar, April 2020.\n\nInvited panellist, LegalEdCon North, 2020.\n\nInvited speaker, â€˜Responses to Errorâ€™, University of Portsmouth, 2019.\n\nInvited speaker, Legal Education Research Network, 2019.\n\nInvited speaker, Legal Education Roundtable, CILEx Regulation, 2019."
