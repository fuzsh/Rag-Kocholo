        "text": "Sharon—The Reverend Walter Lockwood Pitman, 72 peacefully entered the kingdom of heaven on July 20, 2024 surrounded by loved ones after battling Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nWalter was born on April 26, 1952 in Orange, New Jersey to Richard and Frances (nee Carlaw) Pitman. In 1965 the family settled in Newtown, CT where Walter excelled in academics and was a valued member of many Newtown High School sports teams. Walter’s passion for team sports, especially soccer, would carry through his college years at American International College in Springfield, MA and Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, CT where he graduated with a Bachelors in Speech and Theater with a Minor in Psychology.\n\nWalter spent many summers working at Silver Lake Conference Center in Sharon, CT. It was there that he gained a passion for and discerned a call to ministry, earned his lifelong nickname “Scooter” and met the love of his life Stephanie (Hall). As an adult, Scooter deaned conferences, spent weeks as the camp chaplain and for years made it to every Thursday night cookout where he made sure to entertain while feeding hungry conferees. Through his time at Silver Lake, he mentored young people, imparted his wisdom, and pushed those who he thought could become ministers themselves, just as Silver Lake had done for him.\n\nScooter was ordained in 1979, the same year that he married Stephanie, and he began his ministry at the First Congregational Church in East Longmeadow, MA. His ministry took him to The First Congregational Church in Darien, CT then to the First Congregational Church in Chatham, MA where he served the greater Chatham community and developed his love of golf. Then in 1994 his final calling brought him and his family to the United Church of Christ in Southbury, CT where he was the Senior Pastor until his retirement in 2019. After his retirement from Southbury, he remained active in his ministry preaching in several UCC churches around Connecticut.\n\nReverend Pitman took pride in his time in Southbury, not only as a Senior Pastor but also a leader in the community. He was one of the pillars of the Interfaith Community of Southbury, making sure to promote unity and commonality with the other religious leaders of the area. During his time in Southbury, he served as chaplain to the Southbury Volunteer Fire Association as well as Connecticut State Police Troop A. While coaching youth sports he was known for making sure that kids not only learned the game but that they had fun while doing it. He was well known for his attendance at many Region 15 activities and was especially proud of the successes of youth members in the church community.\n\nIn Scooter’s ministry, he considered himself an “old fashioned pastor” and always made himself available to anyone in the community, even those beyond the beloved members of his church congregation. Those who sought his counsel were met with understanding, honesty, and love. His joy of making connections spread throughout and he was often met with a greeting from someone he knew anywhere he went. Whether you knew him as Walter, Scooter, or Reverend Pitman, from Silver Lake, church, or sports, you knew him as a person you could turn to when you needed encouragement, warmth, or laughter.\n\nBesides Stephanie, his beloved wife of 45 years, Walter is survived by his sons Alexander (Hannah) Pitman of Mount Vernon, NY and Richard A. Pitman of Sharon, CT, his sister Virginia (David) Hogan of Bristol, CT, and brother Bruce (Sharon) Pitman of Milford, CT. He also leaves behind his nephew Douglas (Kathryn) Read of Marlborough, CT and nieces Sarah D’Autilio of Salem, MA, Laura Shinney (D’Autilio) of Gloucester, MA, Lauren Napoli of Melbourne, FL, Alison Read of Queens, NY, and Brooke Napoli of West Haven, CT. Walter was predeceased by his parents Frances and Richard L. Pitman, his sister-in-law Barbara D’Autilio, as well as his mother and father-in-law Jane and Allen Hall.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, Walter’s family asks that you consider donating to the Alex Archie Foundation, to help student athletes achieve their dreams or to the Silver Lake Conference Center Scholarship fund, to help young people experience camp.\n\nServices for Walter will be held at the United Church of Christ, Southbury, on September 14, 2024 at 1p.m.\n\nTo leave an online condolence please visit munsonloveterefuneralhome.com."
