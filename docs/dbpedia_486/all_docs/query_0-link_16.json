        "text": "Overview\n\nI am an Associate Professor of Law and Legal Education. I absolutely love teaching law and working with students in an active way where we all contribute to the experience. I specialise in ensuring that Criminal law, Environmental Law and Family law are taught as living interdisciplinary subjects through role play and project work. Ihave worked in several law schools in Russell Group universities over the last twenty years and have won awards for my teaching, including Academic Fellowship of the Inner Temple. I have convened a range of modules, at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, from large core subjects to small specialist group teaching. During this time I developed my interest in inclusion in the teaching and learning of law and active, student-lead learning. My research and practice now centres upon the supporting student learning at degree level, blending face-to-face and online environments.\n\nMy research has always been inter-disciplinary, examing how people use and understand law in action. I have conducted research for the Home Office which contributed to major reform of the law on sexual offences and in procedures relating to the prosecution of offences against children. I wrote (with Laura Hoyano) Child Abuse: Law and Policy Across Boundaries, which won the first Inner Temple Book Prize for Outstanding Legal Research. Most recently (2014-2017) I have been a Senior Research Fellow in the Environment and Sustainability Institute, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, Cornwall, researching human conflict relating to the environment. I have also practiced as a mediator, (from 2014-2018) specialising in family disputes.\n\nMy on-going current research projects are in learning design and delivery (with Dr Karen Kenny (Academic Development) and Dr Steph Comley (Technology Enhanced Learning) and in embedding skills learning into the curriculum with Yoshi Pakalkaite.\n\nQualifications\n\nPhD, University of Sheffield, 1994\n\nThe Development of the Law and its Implementation in the Investigation of Child Abuse\n\nESRC Postgraduate Scholarship and University of Sheffield Scholarship\n\nLLB (Hons. 2.1), University of Sheffield, 1991\n\nGraysonsâ€™ Prize for Family Law\n\nSenior Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy 2020\n\nHigher Practicing Certificate in Mediation (Legal Aid Board accreditation), Family Mediation\n\nCouncil, 2016"
