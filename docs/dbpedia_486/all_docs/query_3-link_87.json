        "text": "Entry requirements\n\nAn upper second-class honours degree in law. Applicants who do not have a law degree but have obtained a 2:1 in at least 3 modules/units related to law/international commerce can be considered. Previous or professional experience is not required. For applicants who are currently completing a degree, we understand that their final grade may be higher than the interim grades or module/unit grades they achieve during their studies.\n\nWe will consider applicants whose interim grades are currently slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements. We may make these applicants an aspirational offer. This offer would be at the standard level, so the applicant would need to achieve the standard entry requirements by the end of their degree.\n\nWe will consider applicants whose grades are slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements, if they have a relevant postgraduate qualification.If this is the case, applicants should include their CV (curriculum vitae / résumé) when they apply, showing details of their relevant qualifications.\n\nSee international equivalent qualifications on the International Office website.\n\nMonths of entry\n\nSeptember\n\nCourse content\n\nOur LLM in International Commercial Law will give you access to one of the most important legal fields for global business - an area of law that is constantly evolving and innovating. There is a growing demand for lawyers with the knowledge and skills to embrace the challenges and opportunities presented by law in a global environment.\n\nOur LLM programmes are well-respected by global law firms. This programme presents an exciting opportunity for in-depth, intensive study of specialist commercial law subjects, and includes a choice of units that build knowledge of the law relevant to international business transactions and contexts in which law operates at a transnational level.\n\nYou will be challenged and inspired by academics dedicated to progressive and innovative thinking in business enterprise as members of the Law School's Centre for Private and Commercial Law. The intellectually demanding, research-rich curriculum will allow you to demonstrate excellent legal, analytical and research skills and form a deep appreciation of the commercial context in which the law and lawyers function.\n\nEmpowered to pursue top-flight careers in a variety of sectors, our students have gone on to forge ahead in the legal, business and finance sectors, as specialist in-house lawyers or working within regulatory organisations. Find out how you can do more with law at the University of Bristol Law School.\n\nInformation for international students\n\nSee international equivalent qualifications on the International Office website."
