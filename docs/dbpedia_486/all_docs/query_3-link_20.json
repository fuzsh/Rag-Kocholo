        "text": "On July 18, I was thrilled to accompany Bristol Myers Squibb's Black Organization for Leadership and Development (BOLD) and Organization for Latino Achievement (OLA) People and Business Resource Group (PBRG) representatives on a visit to Capitol Hill organized by BMS’s Federal Government Affairs team. The purpose of these Hill visits was to highlight through the voice of the constituents the important work Bristol Myers Squibb is doing through its PBRGs to advance health equity and inclusion & diversity within our company and in the communities we serve. We met with the offices of Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), Representative Marilyn Strickland (D-WA-10), Representative Robin Kelly (D-IL-02), Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ-12), Representative Terri Sewell (D-AL-07), Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Representative Andrea Salinas (D-OR-06), and Representative Jennifer González-Colón (R-PR-01). It was an incredible opportunity to educate our elected officials and their staff on the many initiatives BMS spearheads to improve workforce representation, clinical trial diversity, and STEM education, to name a few. I am so proud to work for a company that 1) prioritizes giving back to the community with initiatives to educate patients, diversify clinical trials, and partner with the community to gain insights to improve the patient experience; 2) supports STEM education through mentorship programs and partnerships with universities, including HBCUs, and community organizations working with K-12 students and beyond, to ensure the success of a robust talent pipeline; and 3) fosters an inclusive environment for all, nurturing connections for employees at all levels to enable equitable access to career advancement. I was honored to join my BMS colleagues, BOLD Lead Monique Phillips, PMP and BOLD representatives Mariana Broussard, Dr. Yusuf Oni, Ashley Saunders, and Angela McCarty, as well as OLA Lead Nataly Manjarrez Orduño and OLA representatives Ricardo Sanchez, Wendy Camacho, Julia C. Hernández Prado, and Luzdary Ruelas, on this important day.\n\nAs Disability Pride Month ends, I am reminded of how proud I was to share on a DEI Spotlight Panel on Creating a Culture of Inclusion at the Pharmaceutical Compliance Congress (PCC) Canada the outstanding work that Bristol Myers Squibb is doing to address disparities in healthcare. Current clinical trial practices exclude a significant percentage of the U.S. population based on disability status. There are also barriers caused by inaccessible trial sites, inaccessible medical equipment, and ableist biases. In 2022, in an effort driven by BMS's Disability Advancement Workplace Network (DAWN) People and Business Group (PBRG), BMS launched a Disability Diversity in Clinical Trials (DDiCT) initiative in collaboration with Disability Solutions, a non-profit organization that supports companies globally achieve true disability inclusion. This initiative aims to make recommendations on how to effectively improve access, engagement, speed of enrollment, and participation of people with disabilities in clinical trials, to ensure all patient groups are reflective of the real-world population. We can only unlock the full potential of our medicines when the trials we conduct reflect the communities we serve. #bmsemployee Many thanks to my fellow panelists Eugenia Blackmon, Anne Mayrand, Amy Yuda, and Joanie Lapalme (pictured below) for the privilege of engaging in an important discussion and to my BMS colleague Litsa Kouroumalis for introducing me to PCC Canada and the fantastic Callie Mertel at Informa Connect!"
