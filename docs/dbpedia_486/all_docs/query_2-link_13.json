        "text": "The University of Bristol offers UT students an opportunity to take a variety of courses alongside local students. Specifically, this university is known for its academic rigor in Natural Sciences and Liberal Arts. Considered by many to be the UK's Ivy League, Bristol is one of the most competitive universities for British students.\n\nThe city of Bristol has a long history and is considered one of the most attractive in Britain. It was once a thriving port, second to London. Now, Bristol has become a vibrant city with a dominant youth culture and has made a name for itself in the music and film scene.\n\nParticipants earn UT in-residence credit. All grades earned for the courses undertaken are computed into the official UT Austin GPA, just as they would be for grades earned in courses taken on campus."
