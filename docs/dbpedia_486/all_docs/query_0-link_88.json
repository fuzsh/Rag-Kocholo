        "text": "VBI Vaccines Inc. (Nasdaq: VBIV) (VBI), a biopharmaceutical company driven by immunology in the pursuit of powerful prevention and treatment of disease, today announced that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) (“Court”) has issued an initial order (“Initial Order”) granting the company protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, as amended (“CCAA”). The Initial Order provides for, among other things: (i) a stay of proceeding in favour of VBI, (ii) approval of the DIP Loan (as described below), and (iii) the appointment of Ernst & Young Inc. (“EY”) to serve as monitor (“Monitor”) in the Court during the restructuring (“Restructuring Process”).\n\nThe decision to seek creditor protection was made in the best interest of its stakeholders after careful evaluation of VBI’s financial situation and all available alternatives following consultation with its legal and financial advisors. The board of directors of VBI will remain in place and VBI will remain responsible for the sale process under the supervision of the CCAA Court and the general oversight of the Monitor. VBI intends to fund the CCAA process from cash on hand as well as through the authorized interim debtor-in-possession financing (“DIP Loan”) entered into with K2 HealthVentures LLC (“K2HV”), as the secured creditor and DIP lender.\n\nVBI intends to seek approval of a sale and investment solicitation process (“SISP”), which, if approved, would allow interested parties to participate in the process in accordance with the SISP procedure. VBI intends to use this process to build on the work it undertook prior to the filing to identify one or multiple purchasers of its assets on an efficient basis. The SISP, if approved by the CCAA Court, will be administered by VBI, with the assistance of its financial advisor and the Monitor, EY. Additional detail relating to the SISP will be disclosed in due course.\n\nVBI intends to commence a case under Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code to seek recognition and enforcement in the United States of the CCAA Court’s orders, and to commence a case under the relevant provisions of the Israeli Insolvency and Economic Rehabilitation Law, 2018 (“Israeli Insolvency Law”), to protect VBI’s subsidiaries and assets located in the United States and Israel, respectively.\n\nThe Company has notified Nasdaq of the foregoing and expects its common shares will cease trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market upon such date that Nasdaq determines. The Company expects to cease reporting as a public reporting company.\n\nStikeman Elliott LLP, Haynes and Boone, LLP, Morris, Nicols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP, and Pearl Cohen Zedek Latzer Baratz are acting as legal advisors to VBI. EY is acting as financial advisor to VBI in connection with the CCAA process and the proposed SISP.\n\nAdditional information regarding the CCAA proceeding can be found on the Monitor’s website here, or by contacting the Monitor at vbi.monitor@ca.ey.com or 1-888-338-1764.\n\nAbout VBI Vaccines Inc.\n\nVBI Vaccines Inc.
