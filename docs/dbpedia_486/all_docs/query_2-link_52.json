Students residing in other states outside of Tennessee are not eligible to apply. Conditions must be met based on School Board Policy 6.204, including good attendance and discipline; satisfactory academic record; and in good standing regarding payment of any owed fees. All applications are subject to principal approval.\n\nWhy is the Tuition-Free Designated Elementary program being implemented at Fairmount?\n\nFairmount Elementary has a significant amount of programming space availableto serve additional students, more than any other school in the district. The move of sixth graders to Tennessee Middle School at the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year created even more space. The free tuition program is an opportunity to increase enrollment at Fairmount. Fairmount’s enrollment at the end of the 2021-2022 school year was 351 students. The school was originally constructed to serve approximately 600 students.\n\nHow do I apply for the program?\n\nParents or guardians applying for their child/children to attend Fairmount as tuition free students in Kindergarten for the 2024-2025 school year, must complete the online enrollment and include the completed 2024-2025 Fairmont Free tuition application(s) with the required Kindergarten enrollment documents.\n\nParents or guardians applying for their child/children to attend Fairmount as new tuition free students in grades 1 through 5 for the 2024-2025 school year, must complete the online enrollment, complete the 2024-2025 Fairmount Free tuition application(s), and submit records of attendance, discipline, and grades from their previous school when they submit their completed tuition application(s). The principal will review the records to determine if the student's tuition application will be approved.\n\nPrincipal approval is required before a tuition student's enrollment is finalized.\n\nIn order to complete the online enrollment and application process prior to the beginning of the 2024-2025 school year, families are encouraged to apply by June 1, 2024.\n\nThe 2024-2025 Fairmount Free Tuition Application can be found on the Student Services page, under the documents section. All completed applications must be turned in to Fairmount Elementary School for principal approval or denial.\n\nWhat is the timeline for application for the Tuition-Free Designated Elementary program?\n\nWhile families are encouraged to apply before June 1, 2024.

An official letter notifying parents of the outcome of the application will be emailed and mailed to parents/guardiansstarting after July 7, or as soon as possible as new applications are received. Parents are encouraged to apply as early as possible.\n\nWhat are the benefits of increased enrollment?\n\nState funding to school districts is based per student. By increasing enrollment, the district gets an increase in state funding, approximately $4,500 student. Additional funding benefits all students by allowing the district to provide increased programs and services. A gain of just over two new students through the tuition-free and staff discount programs will be budget neutral. All students gained above thiswill result in additional state funding, which will allow us to provide additional funding for programs and services to students.\n\nIncreased enrollment helps the district retain teachers.\n\nWe are still in a time of COVID-recovery where increased funding, programs, and retaining teachers is vital to helping students recover from the lost instructional time and other detrimental effects of the pandemic. This is another strategy by the board to support that effort.\n\nWhat are other potential benefits to families?\n\nBTCS provides a high-quality education to all students. We have the programming space available, and we want to serve as many students as possible.\n\nThe program will give families living near the city limits a choice where to send their children.\n\nParents or guardians who work in the city will have the opportunity to bring their children to school which may be closer to their workplace.\n\nIf I enroll my child in Fairmount with the tuition-free program, is there a possibility the program could change next year?\n\nThe effectiveness of the program will be reviewed annually by the board. However, once a student enters Fairmount in the tuition-free program, thestudent’stuition will remain free through fifth grade as long astheir enrollment status is consistent.\n\nWill tuition-free students be required to pay tuition upon transitionto Tennessee Middle School?\n\nThe program is only for Fairmount Elementary School. Families who attend Fairmount through fifth grade will be required to pay the appropriate tuition rates upon their child entering Tennessee Middle School in sixth grade.\n\nIf I have a tuition-free child at Fairmount with additional siblings at Tennessee Middle School or Tennessee High School, will the middle and high school children receive the multi-student discount?\n\nBased on the fee structure outlined above, the first paid student is considered “1st Student in Family” for fee purposes.\n\nWill transportation be provided?\n\nTransportation is not provided for any students who attend Bristol Tennessee City Schools and reside outside the city limits.\n\nWho do I contact for more information?"
