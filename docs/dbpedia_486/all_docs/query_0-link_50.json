        "text": "Dear Faculty, Staff and Students of the School of Medicine,\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Paul Bristol to Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine as Vice Dean of Finance and Administration.\n\nPaul was selected following an extensive national search and comes to us with a depth of healthcare and higher education experience leading administrative and finance teams. Most recently, he was the chief administrator for the Michael E. DeBakey Department of Surgery at Baylor College of Medicine. In this role, he was responsible for all the department's financial and operational activities, including quality and performance reporting, faculty productivity assessments and related key performance indicators/metrics.\n\nAs a member of the School of Medicine’s senior leadership team, Paul's expertise and leadership will be crucial in helping to advance the school's research and educational priorities. As vice dean, he is responsible for the overall stewardship of the school's financial management and its operational functions, including accounting, financial planning, budgeting, reporting, facilities management and administrative management. Paul will be a valued colleague whose counsel we will rely upon to guide us as we implement new strategic initiatives, including those in our five-year strategic plan.\n\nI asked Paul to share his thoughts on joining the school, and he shared: \"The CWRU School of Medicine has a prestigious history and continues to flourish in no small part due to the esteemed faculty innovations and commitment to research and education. My vision is to ensure the administrative functions support those innovations and staff are seen as valued contributors and partners to our mission and goals.\"\n\nPrior to joining Baylor College of Medicine, Paul was the associate vice president of performance services for the Academic Enterprise at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, Texas. He also held several leadership roles at UTMB, including chief administrator for primary care services and assistant vice president of performance services.\n\nPaul also spent more than a decade at the University of Michigan in several leadership roles of increasing responsibility, where he oversaw clinical, surgical and research operations; organized community outreach; managed space; and increased revenue and market share while improving patient care experience and supervised management staff.\n\nHe holds a certificate in Lean Healthcare Training, a BA in Communications from the University of Michigan and an MBA in Finance from Keller Graduate School in Atlanta.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Paul to the School of Medicine. We hope to see all of you at the Leadership Transition reception on Thursday, Sept. 7, from 3 to 5 p.m. at the Biomedical Research Building lobby.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStan Gerson, MD\n\nDean and Senior Vice President for Medical Affairs\n\nSchool of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University"
