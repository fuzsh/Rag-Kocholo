        "text": "After a surprising and abrupt exit from his radio show in 2022, Bristol Borough native Mike Missanelli is getting back on the air.\n\nMissanelli’s show will return to his old station, 97.5 The Fanatic, and will be heard Mondays through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. beginning Monday, August 12, according to Beasley Media Group.\n\nMissanelli, who currently hosts a podcast with BetRivers Casino, announced his return to Philly sports talk radio on Friday morning.\n\n“The Mike Missanelli Show” will replace a program hosted by Bob Cooney, who announced earlier this week he was no longer at the station.\n\n“Is this thing on?” Missanelli joked as he returned to the air Friday.\n\nHe added: “We’re starting a new chapter on 97.5 The Fanatic.”\n\nThe longtime sports talk host said he missed the phone calls from the listeners and was looking forward to starting back up.\n\nMissanelli’s return to the station is a little more than two years after fans heard his unexpected exit from 97.5 The Fanatic after 15 years, which included the early days of the station.\n\nAt the time of his departure, Missanelli said he had “some missteps” over his career but “hoped the good outweighed the bad.”\n\nThe sports talker later made statements that he felt pushed out from the station, which has recently undergone a management change.\n\n“We’re excited to welcome Mike Missanelli back to 97.5 The Fanatic,” said Beasley Media Group Philadelphia Vice President and Cluster Manager Paul Blake. “With over 25 years as an iconic sports radio talk show host, Mike’s insightful commentary and engaging style, along with his passion and expertise, make him the perfect fit to lead our station into an exciting new era.”\n\n“I am excited to welcome Mike back to the Fanatic,” said Station Program Director Scott Masteller. “I know that both previous and new listeners will be anxious to hear his insight and perspective on Philadelphia Sports.”\n\nMissanelli, who now lives in Montgomery County, has branched out into food and has also hosted a cooking show. He has released a kids’ book called “The Adventures of Shima The Shiba,” which details the human-like behavior of his Shiba Inu dog. He is also a part-owner of the Briganti By The Bay Vineyard in Cape May County, New Jersey.\n\nMissanelli is a graduate of Widener University Delaware Law School. According to the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, he maintains his license as an active attorney, though it is noted he has no private clients."
