        "text": "Thanks for the advice! And, yes, that's her passion and also a big strength. She already speaks German and Portuguese fluently (those are the languages at home) and she's doing French A-Levels. I have to admit that I discourage her a bit when she came home yesterday with that idea, after talking to the career advisor in her school. I was looking at it with the lenses of my country where a more traditional route is usually preferred. In the end, she felt that it was probably better to focus on Law; Modern Languages would be a bit self indulging. But I think I'll need to review that!\n\nJust another question trying to exploring the advantages of doing a Law degree. If you do a Law degree, would you chances to pass the SQE1&2 in the first sitting be probably higher? I know it's all very new, but taking into account how much you need to learn, is that doable self-studying or would you probably have to do a course? If you do Modern Languages, you will probably have to be quite focused to then prepare on your own for the two exams, right? She is focused, I'm just not sure how her life at the time will be like and I guess it does help when you have the structure of a course to keep pushing you. Another question is that I read people talking about students her age being quite aware of what they want to do in Law (barrister, solicitor? family law, corporate law?). She's far from making any sort of decision like that. I think her choice for Law is more to do with the way she thinks and sees the world (very analytical, able to step back), she's also very good at debating, so she has more of what I think are the basic skills. But not any refined knowledge about the profession at all. So with that in mind, would a Law degree help her by introducing her to the different areas for example? Thanks in advance!!\n\nThe SQE is so new it is hard to comment; but I know bigger city firms intend to still pay for some kind of training / prep for their future trainees to prepare for it, so I don't think she'd be particularly disadvantaged\n\nRe specialisms - no one knows this in year 12, and I certainly felt no disadvantage not having done a law degree. It's far more about academic law anyway. Most people don't know where they want to end up until they're in a training contract\n\n@Paeonia, yes, thanks for mentioning it. We have heard about that. She chose French as one of her A-Levels so she could show that ability to learn other languages too (although it's clearly easier for someone like her!). She said she would be interested in learning Arabic and French at university, for example. This would hopefully level the ground for her a bit. But maybe not!? I suppose the fact that she has the languages at home does put her at a disadvantage but hopefully she'll be able to show that she made a big effort as well to keep up with it all and be really fluent. But we will need to consider it all carefully.\n\nI believe that some Law degrees will include the SQE prep, an integrated approach. This may reduce the need for the SQE prep course post degree (of course people can have a shot at the SQE with no prep course!).\n\nLanguage skills would be a huge benefit to a legal career (though it sounds like she already has these!)\n\nI’d err against not applying based on worries about how competitive it is. She might be the strongest candidate for all we know! If she is really worried, could she do 4x Law choices and 1x Languages. She’d need to be really sure on her course choice for Languages though."
