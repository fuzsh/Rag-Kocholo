        "text": "Schools are a crucial part of communities, with memories of playground games and favourite teachers lasting well beyond childhood. Recent years have seen several closures in Bristol's primary sector, and last year a headteacher warned that more could follow as pupil numbers dwindle and budgets are stretched even tighter.\n\nBelow, we take a look back at some of the schools which have been shut down or demolished in decades past within the Bristol City Council boundary. The government's school information service lists all schools, existing and historical, with details of where they used to operate and when they closed.\n\nMany schools are listed as being closed due to the process of converting into academies, which technically involves closing down the school and reopening as another. We have not included those as they still exist as schools today, just with new names and new leadership.\n\nRead more: Inside the 'first net zero' school as lessons begin for the first time\n\nRead more: Diocese of Bristol Academies Trust schools face upheaval as it disbands\n\nFor example, Bank Leaze Primary School in Lawrence Weston is listed as closing in 2012, but is still operates now under the new name ofOasis Academy Bank Leaze. These are the schools that have been listed as being closed for 10 years or more - comment below if your former school is missing, and we will add it in:\n\nAmberley House School\n\nThis independent (private) school was located at 42 Apsley Road in Clifton, and closed in 2003. A planning application the following year sought permission to convert it into five flats.\n\nAvonhurst School\n\nAnother independent school - it used to be based inside one of the impressive buildings along The Promenade, near Clifton Down. It closed in February 1992.\n\nAccording to a Bristol Post article in 2007, the late headteacher Barry T Jones left £250,000 to Bristol Charities in his will, to fund annual education grants.\n\nClarks Grammar School\n\nYet another school in Clifton, this grammar school used to operate at 21 Alma Road. It closed in 1994 and, according to the city council's planning records, was converted into a house several years later.\n\nCourtlands Special School\n\nThis community special school used to teach pupils in Novers Road, Knowle, prior to its closure in 1994. That year the council granted permission to convert it from a hostel into a \"centre for integrated living for disabled people and for services for the community\".\n\nCutlers Brook Junior School\n\nThis primary school in Mogg Street, St Werburgh's, closed in 1998. It merged with Willow Green Infant School on Warminster Road to become St Werburgh's Primary School, which still operates now on James Street.\n\nDunmail Primary School\n\nThe Southmead primary school closed in 2006 and was succeeded by Little Mead Primary School in Gosforth Road. It was demolished and the land was earmarked for 161 homes known as Elderberry Walk.\n\nFilwood Park Junior School\n\nThe primary school used to teach pupils at Connaught Road in Knowle West, but closed in 1991. A city council planning application in 1998 sought permission to \"Demolish junior school. Building an 8 classroom extension onto the existing infant school. Extending the existing building to form main and nursery entrances. Landscape works throughout the site.\"\n\nThe location was logged as 'Connaught Infants/Queensdale Junior/Filwood Park School'.\n\nFulford School\n\nThis special school used to teach children aged 11-16, at Fulford Road in Hartcliffe. It closed in 2000 and reopened on another site under the Government's Fresh Start scheme.\n\nThe Bristol Post reported on residents' concerns after the council put forward the former Cutlers Brook junior school as the replacement site.\n\nHenbury Manor School\n\nAnother special school, Henbury Manor closed in 2000 and taught children and young adults aged 2-19. It was based at Rectory Gardens in Henbury, and there was backlash from parents when closure was first proposed in 1997.\n\nThe impressive building is now home to Woodstock Special School.\n\nLawrence Weston Comprehensive School\n\nThe school closed in 2002 despite protests from parents, as part of a review of all of Bristol's secondary schools. A report from the time quoted the city council as saying: \"This size school is considered to be stable, financially viable and, above all, able to offer pupils a wide range of subjects and choices\".\n\nIt had operated for 40 years and had capacity for about 1,000 pupils, but its numbers had dwindled to about 300 by the time it closed.\n\nLockleaze School\n\nThe secondary school closed in 2004 after 50 years teaching pupils, as part of a city-wide shake up of secondary education. It had been earmarked for closure for three years, despite continued protests from parents and pupils.\n\nAt the time of its closure, Bob Smith, who was then chairman of governors, said the council's decision to close was \"a disgrace and short-sighted\". The building has since been demolished to make way for a 268-home development, which is now nearing completion.\n\nMerrywood School\n\nThe secondary school in Daventry Road, Knowle, shut down in 2000 despite protests from parents. It had been a part of the community for more than a century, having opened as Merrywood Higher Grade School on January 27, 1896.\n\nIt jointly faced closure alongside Pen Park school in Southmead, as the council looked to cut surplus places. The Bristol Evening Post at the time covered furious council meetings as families fought to save Merrywood from closure, and a schoolgirl even took her case to the High Court arguing that the closure should be overturned, although she did not succeed.\n\nPen Park School\n\nThe Southmead secondary school shut in 2000, despite a hard-fought campaign. Our article from the time, on the last day, read: \"Students and staff held their heads high as they walked out of the gates for the very last time.\n\n\"The 58 remaining pupils and their teachers walked behind banners which read \"Goodbye\" and \"Thank you for your support\". Acting head teacher Tina Moon carried the school's bell while others clutched footballs, books and folders.\" Southmead Community Sports Ground opened on the former school site in 2012.\n\nRedhouse Primary School\n\nThe primary school in Withywood closed in August 1989. A planning application lodged with the council three years later sought permission to convert the former school building, which became home to the council's Redhouse Offices.\n\nSt Thomas More Catholic Secondary School\n\nThe school in Stottbury Road, Horfield, closed in 2005 and later the building became home to Fairfield High School.\n\nWhitehouse Primary School\n\nThe primary school in Fulford Road, Hartcliffe, shut down in 2002 due to falling pupil numbers. It had been educating pupils since opening in 1954.
