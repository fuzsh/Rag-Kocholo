Students want universities to provide an international experience, the opportunity to study alongside people from all over the world, and a truly global community in which to study.\n\nAs part of the data collected for the World University Rankings, Times Higher Education asks all institutions to provide figures on their percentage of international students. Using this data, THE has compiled a list of the top 200 universities with the highest percentage of international students.\n\nIn this table, and across our rankings, international students are defined as those who are studying in a different country to the country or region they usually live in.\n\nMacau University of Science and Technology is in first place, with nearly 92 per cent international students, while Near East University takes second place.\n\nCountries represented in the top 20 include the UAE, UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and Australia.\n\nTwenty universities from London feature in the top 200, making it one of the most represented cities in the ranking. In fact, the UK as a whole was the most represented country, with 64 universities in the top 200, compared with 18 from the US and 16 in Australia.\n\nThe top five universities with the highest percentage of international students 2024\n\nScroll down to see the top 200.\n\n1.
