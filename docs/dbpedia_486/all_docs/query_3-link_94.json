        "text": "HIGHLAND HEIGHTS, Ky. (WXIX) - The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing and it is likely, according to Forbes, that more than half of US educators use some form of AI in the classroom.\n\n“There’s so much information and opinions surrounding Artificial Intelligence and its place in the workforce and classroom,” explains Northern Kentucky University College of Informatics Dean Dr. Kevin Kirby. “Many educators and institutions are beginning to embrace technology, adding that it can help improve education as long as it’s used correctly.”\n\nComing this fall, NKU will be the first university in Kentucky and the region to offer a degree track in artificial intelligence.\n\n“What we did at NKU, most dramatically, is we created a minor in Artificial Intelligence,” said Dr. Kirby. “Whatever you are majoring in, there will be a chance to go deep in AI to help you in school and help in your career.”\n\nDr. Kirby says his stance along with the university’s is to embrace AI because it is the future and more than likely will be used in some form in every career field and even in industries that are currently trying to stop its use.\n\n“We have moved very quickly from saying don’t use AI to we encourage you to use AI, but if you do, you have to take responsibility for its accuracy, ethical content, understand how it was sourced, and don’t pass off AI work as your own,” Dr. Kirby explained.\n\nHow will this be taught in NKU’s classroom?\n\n“Understand, AI is simply a tool,” says NKU English professor Dr. Tamara O’Callaghan. “It’s not a replacement for critical thinking.”\n\nDr. O’Callaghan will be co-teaching the new AI course at NKU which will put a twist on typical assignments.\n\n“But we force them to use an AI to try and draft it,” Dr. O’Callaghan said.\n\nOnce that’s complete, the student will have to review it and correct the work AI did.\n\n“Well, there’s no thesis statement. The research materials aren’t accurate,” explained Dr. O’Callaghan. “Even if they exist, it’s not an accurate quotation or citation. There’s no development of an argument.”\n\nThe assignment is wrapped up with students cleaning up AI errors and then adding their resourced and properly cited thoughts to the project.\n\nEach university or school district will have to establish its own policies on AI usage. Some districts have yet to adopt an AI policy, saying there has not been a need.\n\n“Due to the nature of AI tools, there are age restrictions,” says Boone County Schools Director of Technology Kyle Berberich. “Normally for people under 18, you’re usually not allowed to use them.”\n\nBerberich says for now only teachers are engaging with AI to help save time and generate new and creative ways for teachers to educate children.\n\n“For example, we have a lot of practical living teachers that are unique to themselves in a building, so when it’s time for planning every day, they don’t have a person to sit down and plan with,” describes Berberich. “They could open a chatbot and start having a conversation and getting additional ideas and start having a brainstorming partner.”\n\nBerberich says that the use of AI is simply used to gather more information and ideas from around the web faster than a human could do it. As in the case of the folks over at NKU, a human being is responsible for the final outcome of what is released in the classroom.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
