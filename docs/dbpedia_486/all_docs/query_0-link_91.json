        "text": "Huge counter demo in Bristol sends clear message that far right not welcome – as it happened\n\nAfter the Bristol riot on Saturday, Cable reporters were live at the scene as counter protesters returned to the streets to stand up to the far right.\n\nIt was feared that the Bristol riots would continue tonight after the far right brought violence to our city’s streets on Saturday night.\n\nOn Saturday, our reporters Priyanka Raval and Sean Morrison were at the scene and in their special report documented how Bristol protesters resisted the far-right violence. They witnessed violent clashes in Castle Park as police struggled to keep the far-right protesters and counter-protesters apart.\n\nThen when the far-right rioters were pushed back onto Bristol Bridge by police, they headed to Redcliffe where a number of asylum seekers are living. There were more violent clashes, as anti-fascist demonstrators tried to protect the hotel before the police arrived. Eventually, tensions were diffused amid a heavy police presence.\n\nA total of 17 people so far arrested for their involvement in the Bristol riots, and three people have been charged. This comes in the national context of more than 400 arrests and 120 charges, as police forces have promised to crack down on the violence.\n\nRumours of a second far-right protest had been swirled since the weekend, prompting a counter demonstration to be organised, and businesses and shopfronts in Old Market to close early and board up their shop fronts in anticipation of more unrest.\n\nIt was expected that the far right would target the offices of immigration lawyers in Old Market on Wednesday nigh. In response, around 2,000 people took to the streets as part of a counter demo, sending a clear message that the far right were not welcome. In the end, there was no major far right presence.\n\nFor a recap of what happened, you can read our reporting from Wednesday’s counter protest below:\n\n9pm\n\nProtest winding down\n\nAfter protestors marched around the city centre, they have returned to Old Market and the counter demo is thinning out and turning into more of a party. There is a massive queue for the only offy on West Street that stayed open, as demonstrators line up to get a tinny.\n\n8:40pm\n\nMore photos from the counter protest\n\nWith no sign of the far right, thousands of counter protesters took to the streets in Bristol. Here are some more photos from the scene by Melanie Vaxevanakis.\n\n8pm\n\nPeople now marching towards Castle Park\n\nThe crowd has moved through Castle park and onto the Harbourside, and is now turning back up Corn Street towards the park again. There still seems to be no far-right presence.\n\n7:50pm\n\nSpeeches to the crowd\n\n7:40pm\n\nEnormous counter demo now underway\n\nSpeeches are ongoing at the counter-demonstration in West Street, where hundreds of people have turned out in solidarity to stand against far right, racist, xenophobic hatred.\n\nThere’s no sign yet in the area of any kind of far right presence. Their demonstration, if it were to go ahead, was scheduled rumoured to begin at 8pm\n\nThe police, in riot vans are stationed on the fringes of the crowds. Officers on horseback are patrolling the perimeter.\n\n7:05pm\n\nNo sign of the far right…\n\n6:45pm\n\nCounter protesters starting to arrive\n\nHundreds of counter protesters have now arrived at the east end of West Street in Old Market. The counter demo was originally publicised for 7pm by organisers. There currently seems to be no sign of far-right protesters arriving or any tensions.\n\n6:40pm\n\nCoordinated response\n\nEver since rumours of a second far-right demo coming to Bristol started swirling on Monday, locals have started coordinating a response. From organising a large counter demo via Whatsapp groups and nightly meetings and setting up a fundraiser for the children at the Redcliffe hotel, to clearing the streets of glass and other potential weapons, setting up a first aid hub on Trinity Road, checking in with businesses on Old Market and organising a community clean up tomorrow morning.\n\n6pm\n\nPolice presence growing in Old Market\n\nThe police presence in and around West Street in Old Market is growing, but otherwise the streets remain quiet, with the majority of shop fronts closed or boarded up.\n\nEarlier on in the day, police statements said they had very little information about what to expect tonight. Chief Inspector Vicks Hayward-Melen said: “The number of people who may show up or any intentions after getting to West Street are not clear. I want to reiterate that we have no information that suggests a march is planned on Stapleton Road or into Easton.\n\n“There is also information circulating that a neo-Nazi group from Kent are coming to Bristol tonight as well as those aligned to the far right wanting to march down Stapleton Road. This is not correct and we have no information to suggest this is the case.”\n\n3:30pm\n\nShops being boarded up in Old Market\n\nIn Old Market this afternoon, residents and business owners are preparing a second evening of far-right hatred and violence on Bristol’s streets. People are worried, and shops along West Street are being boarded up. It’s clear, however, that they feel supported by the solidarity shown by activists and the wider community.\n\nAli, a barber on West Street, says people have been popping into the shop throughout the week to warn about the far right’s plan and to offer advice. He says he watched what happened on Saturday at home on television and was proud to see that so many people standing in solidarity, willing to take a stand against racist hatred.\n\n“I have friends of mine who wanted to go, to come here tonight, but it would not be safe for them. It is important that so many other people, activists, here in Bristol are able to stand up for us, for all communities and say no to these horrible people,” he tells the Cable, as he prepares to close the shop early – its windows already boarded up.\n\nAnni, who runs a Bulgarian supermarket on West Street, tells us she has been amazed by the solidarity Bristol has shown to the targets of the far-right hatred. She’s had a similar experience – activists, people from all over Bristol, dropping by to warn her and show their support.\n\n“I have heard that there will be hundreds of counter-demonstrators tonight, which is amazing. We are worried, of course, it is horrible what is going on,” she says from the shop counter, also preparing to close early. “If people want to protest peacefully, fine, but all this violence is not acceptable. We hope it stays peaceful.”"
