Payment of Fees\n\n3.1 Payment of Fees\n\n3.1.1 Students shall pay the Tuition Fees in full for the first two Terms in advance of arriving at the College or commencing a Digital Programme or on the day of enrolment. Such payments shall be made by online payment, bank transfer or bank draft only. Cash payments are not accepted. Any Tuition Fee Deposit already paid by the Student shall be deducted from such payment.\n\n3.1.2 Students attending a Programme for more than two Terms shall pay for subsequent Terms in accordance with this clause. After payment of the first two Terms is made in accordance with clause 3.1.1 above, payment for a later Term shall be made at the beginning of the previous Term. For example: Tuition Fees for a third Term will be due at the start of the second Term. Tuition Fees for a fourth Term will be due at the beginning of the third Term.\n\n3.1.3 Sponsored Students must submit the Financial Guarantee covering Tuition Fees from their Sponsor before commencing the Programme.\n\n3.1.4 Kaplan reserves the right to charge VAT on Tuition Fees where necessary following a change in law or regulation. In respect of a Digital Programme, Kaplan shall charge any locally applicable taxes relevant to the Student’s place of study.\n\n3.2 Payments after arrival\n\n3.2.1 After the arrival at the College or commencing a Digital Programme, Students may pay any remaining Tuition Fees or Accommodation Fees by online payment, bank transfer, GBP cheque, international credit or debit card or UK debit card.

Kaplan reserves the right to suspend or cancel the Student’s participation on the Programme and to charge interest at 3% above the base rate of Barclays Bank plc per month or part thereof on the outstanding balance until such balance is paid in full. Kaplan further reserves the right to withhold any academic results or certificates if any Tuition Fees are outstanding at the end of the Programme.\n\n3.4 Other payment terms\n\n3.4.1 If it becomes necessary for the Student to repeat a Module, the Student shall pay a Module Fee. The cost of a repeat Module is GBP 2,000 per Module except for a Digital Programme which shall be GBP 1,500 per Module.\n\n3.4.2 If a Student, in the reasonable discretion of the College, does not make satisfactory progress in their learning, then the Student may be required by the College to repeat relevant Modules or the Term, as is appropriate in the circumstances, at an additional cost. If repeating Modules from the same Term, the Student shall pay either the total cost of the repeat Modules or the cost of the Term, whichever is the lesser amount. The College has discretion, acting reasonably, as to when the Student may repeat any Modules.\n\n3.4.3 Any discount, scholarship or bursary payment provided to the Student as a reduction on the Tuition Fees by Kaplan shall be discounted from any fees payable for the final Term of the Programme.\n\n3.4.4 Students shall be responsible for purchasing the core learning material to support their studying experience. Kaplan shall provide the Student with the core learning material at the start of each Term on commencement or continuation of the Programme.\n\n3.4.5 Except in relation to a Digital Programme, Students not ordinarily resident in the UK are obliged to maintain adequate accident, medical and travel insurance for the duration of the Programme. Students may either purchase the EduTravel Insurance Policy, details of which can be found at www.kaplanpathways.com/support-for-studying-abroad/health-and-safety/uk-student-insurance/ or from Kaplan, or provide proof of adequate cover from an alternative provider or a Sponsor upon acceptance of the Offer. Students who are ordinarily resident in the UK are not required (although are recommended) to have appropriate insurance.\n\n3.4.6 If a Student wishes to participate in a Pathways Extra Internship, the Student will be required to submit a separate application form and pay the relevant fees directly to Kaplan. Students will only be able to enrol onto a Pathways Extra Internship providing they have no outstanding Tuition Fees, Accommodation Fees or Other Fees overdue to Kaplan. Students will also be required to agree to Virtual Internship Partners Limited terms & conditions in order to enrol onto a Pathways Extra Internship.\n\n3.5 Banking Charges\n\nStudents are responsible for covering any applicable bank charges when making payments to Kaplan. Should the Student fail to pay any applicable charges, all such amounts shall be deducted from the Student’s Tuition Fee Deposit.\n\n4. Refunds\n\n4.1 Refunds before enrolment\n\n4.1.1 Right to cancel Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013): If the legally binding contract formed with the Student in accordance with paragraph 2.2 of these terms and conditions is not made in person with the Student at Kaplan’s premises (for example by exchange of e-mails), the Student shall have the right to cancel the contract if the Student gives notice of cancellation to Kaplan within the fourteen calendar day period beginning on the day following the day on which Kaplan first received the Student’s Acceptance Form or the Tuition Fee Deposit or Financial Guarantee. If a Student exercises his or her right to cancel during this fourteen day period, he or she will receive a full refund of all amounts already paid by the Student, including any Administration Fee, less the cost of any services already performed by Kaplan before the end of the fourteen day period. A cancellation form is attached as Schedule 1 to these terms and conditions. Please note that cancellation of any accommodation will remain subject to the cancellation terms contained in the Accommodation Agreement.\n\n4.1.2 Visa refusals: If the Student is unable to meet UK visa entry requirements and has complied with sections 4.1.3 – 4.1.6 below, the Student will be refunded the Tuition Fee Deposit and the Accommodation Payment. Any Administration Fee paid is not refundable in this circumstance.\n\n4.1.3 Students must provide an official refusal letter from the UK immigration authorities to Kaplan to obtain a refund. However, if the visa refusal letter refers to fraudulent, forged or counterfeit documents being submitted as part of the visa application or a visa refusal on the grounds of adverse immigration history not disclosed at the point of an application being submitted to Kaplan, Kaplan reserves the right to refuse a refund of the Tuition Fee Deposit and/or the Accommodation Payment.\n\n4.1.4 All requests for refunds due to visa refusal must be submitted in writing to the Kaplan admissions office together with a copy of the Student’s passport and the visa refusal letter.\n\n4.1.5 To minimize the risk of visa refusal, all Students planning to study in the UK are strongly recommended to follow visa advice offered by education agents or official visa agencies in their home country. Students planning to study in the UK who are not applying through education agents in their country will be offered free visa counselling from a Kaplan Visa Advisor providing they have a CAS issued by Kaplan. However, all students should be aware that the final decision for the grant of any visa is made by the UK Home Office. Accordingly Kaplan does not accept responsibility of any kind for either the counselling offered by the Kaplan Visa Advisor or any decision to reject, defer or otherwise not accept a visa application by the UK Home Office.\n\n4.1.6 In order to be eligible for a refund of their Tuition Fee Deposit or the Accommodation Payment on the grounds of visa refusal, Students must have followed the advice given to them by either a Kaplan Visa Advisor or a visa counsellor from a visa agency in their country. In the case of the latter, Students may be requested to prove to Kaplan’s reasonable satisfaction that they are receiving advice from such a counsellor.\n\n4.1.7 Other than in the circumstances set out at sections 4.1.1 (Right to cancel), 4.1.2 (Visa refusals) or 4.3 (Refunds and Compensation – Student Protection Plan), Administration Fees, Tuition Fee Deposits and the Accommodation Payment are non-refundable prior to enrolment. In circumstances where Kaplan decides to issue a discretionary refund prior to enrolment however, Kaplan will retain any Administration Fee already paid and deduct a fee of GBP 200 (“Student Course Cancellation Fee”) from the refunded amounts. Requests for refunds before enrolment will normally be processed within 4 weeks of receipt by Kaplan of a properly completed form. The Student Course Cancellation Fee reflects the cost of processing the refund.\n\n4.2 Refunds after enrolment\n\n4.2.1 Unless the Student is cancelling in accordance with section 4.1.1 (Right to cancel) or section 4.3 (Refunds and Compensation – Student Protection Plan) applies, once the Student has commenced the Programme, Accommodation Fees, Tuition Fees and Other Fees are all non-refundable, except where:\n\n4.2.1.1 the Student transfers to another recognised UK institution in which case Kaplan shall refund any Tuition Fees (less any amounts for tuition already provided) upon the Student’s provision of documents evidencing an offer for a full time Programme of study; or\n\n4.2.1.2 the Student returns to their home country due to extenuating circumstances as authorised at the College’s discretion in which case Kaplan may at its discretion refund any Accommodation Fees and/or Tuition Fees on receipt of a copy of the Student’s passport or other document proving return to the Student’s home country provided that the Student is not able to recover such amounts under his or her insurance policy; or\n\n4.2.1.3 in respect of Accommodation Fees only, the Student vacates his or her accommodation and Kaplan finds a replacement tenant for such accommodation; or\n\n4.2.1.4 the Student has paid Tuition Fees for a Remaining Term (being any future Term a Student is scheduled to complete which is not a Current or a Confirmed Term) in which case such fees shall be refunded.\n\n4.2.1.5 the Student is studying a Programme with an integrated placement / internship, in which case if the Student withdraws before the placement / internship starts then the Tuition Fees for the term in which the placement / internship occurs will be refunded.\n\n4.2.1.6 the Student is studying on a Digital Programme and cancels within 14 days of the official enrolment date (and not the actual date the Student enrols, if different) for the Digital Programme.\n\n4.2.2 Refunds relating to Accommodation Fees, Tuition Fees or Other Fees that are not subject to the provisions of section 4.2.1 above shall be considered at the College’s discretion. The Student shall submit a written request for such a refund to the College using the prescribed form available upon request from the College within three calendar months from their date of leaving the College. Any requests received at a later date may not be considered.\n\n4.2.3 Requests for refunds after enrolment will normally be processed within 4 weeks of receipt by the College of a properly completed form in accordance with section 4.2.2 above and a fee of GBP 200 (“Refund Fee”) shall be withheld from any refunds in excess of GBP 750 (other than those made in accordance with clause 4.1.1 above (Right to cancel)). The Refund Fee reflects the cost of processing the refund.\n\n4.3 Refunds and Compensation – Student Protection Plan\n\n4.3.1 Kaplan has published a Student Protection Plan which explains how continuation and quality of study will be preserved for current and potential Students should a risk to their continued study arise. The Student Protection plan can be found at: www.kaplanpathways.com/student-protection-plan/\n\n4.3.2 This section 4.3 sets out the circumstances in which Kaplan will refund fees and provide compensation should it be necessary to invoke provisions under the Student Protection Plan where Kaplan is no longer able to preserve continuation of study either for a Student who has already enrolled onto a Programme or for a Student who has accepted a place on a Programme but is yet to enrol.\n\n4.3.3 If Kaplan plans to withdraw a Programme or is forced to terminate a Programme due to unexpected circumstances, Kaplan will consult with any affected Student and will as a minimum:\n\n4.3.3.1 Offer the Student advice and support to help them decide whether or not to transfer to an alternative suitable Programme offered by Kaplan and assist with such transfer if applicable; and\n\n4.3.3.2 Put in place a compensation plan relevant to the circumstances of the particular withdrawal or termination which will include provision for refunds of applicable fees and / or compensation in respect of additional costs reasonably incurred by the Student.\n\n4.3.4 The compensation plan referred to at clause 4.3.3.2 above will seek to ensure that any proposed refunds or compensation returns the Student to the position that they would have been in had the circumstances not occurred. The compensation plan may therefore include appropriate provision for the following, where applicable:\n\n4.3.4.1 Refunds of Tuition Fees (including the Tuition Fee Deposit), Administration Fees and Other Fees;\n\n4.3.4.2 Refunds of any appropriate losses incurred in relation to accommodation or maintenance costs (depending on the student’s individual circumstances);\n\n4.3.4.3 Compensation for additional travel costs incurred by a Student affected by a change in location of the Programme;\n\n4.3.4.4 In exceptional circumstances, compensation may also be paid for additional tuition costs incurred by a Student transferring to another programme or for lost time.\n\n4.4 Other terms applicable to all refunds\n\n4.4.1 Subject to clauses 4.4.2 and 4.4.3 below, all refunds shall be processed in GBP to the originating bank account that the Student or the person paying on the Student’s behalf used to make his or her original payment to Kaplan and Kaplan will not issue a refund to any person other than the original payor.\n\n4.4.2 If the full refund amount is equal to or less than GBP 2000 and the Student holds a UK bank account, Kaplan shall process such refund to the Student’s UK bank account. The amount to be refunded may not be split into smaller amounts to allow a portion to be paid into a UK account.\n\n4.4.3 In respect of refunds to be made after enrolment only, Kaplan may, upon request from the original payor, forward the funds to the Partner University where such funds are owed by the original payor to the Partner University and not to Kaplan.\n\n4.4.4 If a Student wishes to request a refund before enrolment, the Student should contact the relevant Admission Manager or send an e-mail to pathways@kaplan.com. If the Student wishes to request a refund after enrolment, the Student should contact a member of the College services team or send an e-mail to pathwaysukaccounts@kaplan.com.\n\n5. Programme withdrawal\n\n5.1 In the event that the Student withdraws from the Programme, the Student shall notify the relevant College Director (or Kaplan in the case of a Digital Programme) in writing. Notice of withdrawal becomes effective once the College Director receives a copy of the notice.\n\n5.2 In the event that the Student withdraws from the Programme, the Student is no longer eligible to receive a Kaplan certificate of completion.\n\n5.3 If the Student is on a Tier 4 visa and sponsored by Kaplan, Kaplan shall notify the UK Home Office in the event that the Student withdraws or transfers from the Programme.\n\n6. Deferrals\n\n6.1 Once the Student has accepted the Offer, the Student may request to defer the start of the Programme. The Student should send such a request in writing to Kaplan no later than four (4) weeks prior to the Programme start date, setting out the reasons for deferral. Kaplan reserves the right to consider each request on a discretionary basis.\n\n6.2 Students may only request a deferral twice.
