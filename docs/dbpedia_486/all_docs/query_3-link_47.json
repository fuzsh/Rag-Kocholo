        "text": "Entry requirements\n\nAn upper second-class honours degree in law. Applicants who do not have a law degree but have obtained a 2:1 in at least three modules or units related to law/international relations can be considered. Previous or professional experience is not required.\n\nFor applicants who are currently completing a degree, we understand that their final grade may be higher than the interim grades or module/unit grades they achieve during their studies.\n\nWe will consider applicants whose interim grades are currently slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements. We may make these applicants an aspirational offer. This offer would be at the standard level, so the applicant would need to achieve the standard entry requirements by the end of their degree. Specific module requirements may still apply.\n\nWe will consider applicants whose grades are slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements, if they have a relevant postgraduate qualification.If this is the case, applicants should include their CV (curriculum vitae / résumé) when they apply, showing details of their relevant qualifications.\n\nSee international equivalent qualifications on the International Office website.\n\nMonths of entry\n\nSeptember\n\nCourse content\n\nAt a critical time in history, our LLM in International Law and International Relations provides you with an opportunity to engage in an exciting area of law that is complex and constantly evolving.
