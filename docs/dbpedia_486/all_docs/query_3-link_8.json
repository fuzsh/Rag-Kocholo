        "text": "Yes, the University can ask for whatever Grades they like. The \"typical offer\" is exactly that - based on what happened in previous years.\n\nIf this year they have had trillions of applications from pupils predicted higher grades than the \"typical offer\" was last year, then they will raise the bar. Equally, another course might have had fewer applications with predicted grades to make their \"typical offer\" from previous years, and might offer places to pupils predicted lower than their typical offer.\n\nOf course, come results day, some of the spaces might not be filled, and they might accept people with lower grades than the offer.\n\nUltimately they can ask for whatever they want. Universities have been giving out offers for a while now and may be managing demand on popular courses at this point. Is it likely to be very popular?\n\nDS has had a couple of lower than expected offers and a couple as expected. Still waiting for one, but he’s not so fussed about that one.\n\n@Pinkdafodils @Rejects\n\nIf you look at another Higher Education thread about Law at Edinburgh you will probably see why they are different. The Scottish government is, in effect, controlling access to courses. They need overseas students more than UK ones. They pay a lot more. So the university must control who is offered places to counter the Scottish government fees and deprivation policies. It fluctuates: but when DD was applying for university for 2010 start, her school said exactly the same. Don’t apply to Edinburgh. Hardly anyone is getting an offer. It’s wasting a space on the form. There are, fortunately, other great options.\n\nAre you sure that your dd wasn't looking at what the contextual offer would be. Often it will say AAB/ABB with the second being what a contextual would be. But as others have said if it is a popular choice with many presenting with A* then they may make a higher than standard/typical and take a chance on you if you hit the grades.\n\nTizerorFizz · 22/01/2023 12:21\n\n@Pinkdafodils @Rejects\n\nIf you look at another Higher Education thread about Law at Edinburgh you will probably see why they are different.

It's all very frustrating as my ds has been rejected by Oxford (as the Oxbridge thread knows!) and is really pinning his hopes on StA when it seems chances there are extremely slim if not slimmer than Oxbridge now. If he doesn't get an offer, he may have to start from scratch and reapply next year, because even though Bristol is fab and he is confident of getting three As it isn't 100 per cent the course he wants ...\n\nTo be honest, does he need to be so choosy on course content? I haven’t seen what he wants to study but Bristol is usually known for plenty of modules on offer. No one gets 100% what they want. StA still might offer! Don’t give up @Rejects\n\nDDs have friends at Bristol. Accommodation was a shitshow last year, with not enough available and no one getting what they asked for. Also, everything is so expensive, they say going out is London prices though they don’t get London grants. Something to be aware of.\n\nI think they give contextual offers to those sixth forms in the bottom 40% for A level results. A comp near us which sends 24% to Russel Group Unis does not get contextual offers. Dds comp which sends 10% to Russell Group Unis does get contextual offers from Bristol.\n\nIt's a complicated story - ds is under pressure from his school to reapply to Oxford and a gap year MAY be quite helpful to his longer-term career ambitions, so it might make sense if he doesn't get his first two choices but his four predicted A stars to start from scratch, as the Bristol option isn't a perfect fit in the way the other two are. But it's not a big deal in the scheme of things, I only joined this thread to give the context that his Bristol offer was three As and Scottish unis seemed to be offering even higher. He has more achievable offers from Newcastle and Leeds, which are also both fab"
