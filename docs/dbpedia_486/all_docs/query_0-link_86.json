        "text": "Are you looking to progress in your career, but wondering how you will be able to fund your studies? We understand that studying at university can be a challenging financial commitment, which is why we have over £3 million available in our scholarship fund to help you achieve your ambitions, whatever your background.\n\nApplying for scholarships and bursaries can sometimes feel overwhelming, and misinformation can make them feel inaccessible. We break down some of the most common myths students have around applying for our scholarships and bursaries.\n\nPlease note: Although most of our scholarships can be applied for by submitting one application, some of our Scholarships and Bursaries require separate applications such as the Career Changer Scholarship and Undergraduate Bursary.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nAm I eligible for a scholarship or bursary?\n\nOur wide range of scholarships and bursaries are awarded based on need or merit (or a combination of the two). As the number of available awards is limited, we would recommend that you plan where possible to ensure you can meet the costs associated with your course without the need for an award. You can find more information about other funding sources on our undergraduate or postgraduate fees and funding pages.\n\nThe awards listed below are available for students beginning a course during the 2023/24 and 2024/25 academic years\n\nIf you’re an international applicant, take a look at our International Scholarships and Bursaries\n\nHow do I apply for scholarship awards?\n\nThe majority of our awards are designed so that you only need to make one scholarships application in order to be considered for all relevant awards. We’ve created a grid for you to see all of this clearly. To apply for any of these awards, you will need to have received an offer for one of our courses. To get started, simply follow the link provided in your offer letter.\n\nWidening Participation criteria\n\nSome of our awards are needs based and have specific Widening Participation criteria. This is to ensure awards go to students whose backgrounds are under-represented in Higher Education. When you access the scholarship application form following the link in your offer letter, you’ll be asked to confirm which of the Widening Participation criteria you possess. For the 2023/24 and 2024/25 academic years, our Widening Participation criteria means that applicants will need to provide evidence of one of the following:\n\nAny experience in local authority care\n\nEstrangement from family\n\nRefugee status\n\nBeing the sole carer of a parent(s) or, if living away from home, the sole carer of a sibling\n\nHave a registered disability\n\nLow household income demonstrated by:\n\nBeing in receipt of Income Support, Job Seeker's Allowance, or Employment and Support Allowance\n\nBeing in receipt of Universal Credit\n\nBeing in receipt of, or living with a parent/Guardian in receipt of Asylum Support\n\nBeing in receipt of free school meals\n\nBeing in receipt of a 16-19 Bursary in England or EMA (Education Maintenance Allowance) in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland\n\nBeing in receipt of Learner Support (FE 19+) or equivalent FE funding for Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland\n\nLiving with a parent/Guardian in receipt of Child Tax Credit where the candidate is named on the award and the household income used to calculate the tax credits is less than £25,000.\n\nLiving with a parent/Guardian in receipt of Income Support, Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance or Income-based Employment and Support Allowance.\n\nLiving with a parent/Guardian in receipt of Universal Credit, if the annual household take-home pay as stated on the award is less than £25,000.\n\nLater in the process you will be asked to provide evidence of this before any award is confirmed.\n\nWhat is the online assessment?\n\nFor some awards, we use an online assessment designed by our Academic Team and tested by a student panel in order to help us identify successful candidates. The assessment does not require any prior knowledge or preparation and is intended to provide an objective assessment of critical thinking and reasoning. It is a timed test that lasts for 30 minutes which you can sit when you are ready. For students who usually receive additional time for assessments, this can be requested via the scholarships application form link within your offer letter in advance of taking the test.\n\nWhen you complete the test, you’ll be advised as to whether or not you have ‘passed’ the basic test threshold score of 10 for undergraduate or 12 for postgraduate. Students scoring below the pass mark will not be in receipt of any award that has the online assessment as one of the criteria. Passing the test does not mean that you have automatically secured an award. Instead your score, along with any other eligibility criteria will be compared to others once the application window has closed.\n\nUndergraduate Scholarships\n\nCareer Changer Scholarship\n\nApplicable for: All undergraduate degrees, excluding apprenticeship programmes\n\nOverview\n\nFirst Year Full Fee Scholarships and partial fee scholarships, are available for all undergraduate courses\n\nWhat are the eligibility criteria?\n\nYou need to:\n\nHave received an offer for one of our undergraduate degrees\n\nIn the application form you’ll need to evidence: previous work experience, transferable skills that will assist you to progress to a new career and motivation for a career change (T&Cs).\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nTo make a scholarship application you must complete the scholarship application form, which is an online form:\n\nFor courses starting in October 2024 – Closed\n\nFor courses starting between January 2025 and June 2025 – Apply now\n\nWhat is the application deadline?\n\nFor courses starting between in October 2024 – Closed\n\nFor courses starting between January 2025 and June 2025 – Sunday 3 November 2024\n\nWhen will the winners be announced?\n\nFor courses starting between in October 2024 – Winners have been announced\n\nFor courses starting between January 2025 and June 2025 – Monday 2 December 2024\n\nLord Blunkett Widening Access Scholarships\n\nApplicable for: All undergraduate courses, excluding apprenticeship programmes\n\nOverview\n\nAwards of £1,000 each are available to all undergraduate degrees, excluding apprenticeship programmes\n\nWhat are the eligibility criteria?\n\nYou need to:\n\nMeet the Widening Participation criteria\n\nHave received an offer for one of our undergraduate courses\n\nHave the highest score in the online assessment\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nFollow the scholarships link in your offer letter\n\nComplete the online scholarships assessment\n\nWe’ll add your final academic results to your submitted scholarships application when we have them\n\nWhat is the application deadline?\n\nFor courses starting in September 2024 – Applications are closed\n\nFor courses starting in January 2025 – Sunday 17 November 2024\n\nWhen will the winners be announced?\n\nFor courses starting in September 2024 – Thursday 15 August 2024\n\nFor courses starting in January 2025 – Thursday 12 December 2024\n\nSet for Success Scholarship\n\nApplicable for: All undergraduate degrees, excluding apprenticeship programmes\n\nOverview\n\nOne First Year Full Fee award is available for all undergraduate degrees, excluding apprenticeship programmes.\n\nAwards of £2,000 each are available to all undergraduate degrees, excluding apprenticeship programmes.\n\nWhat are the eligibility criteria?\n\nYou need to:\n\nHave received an offer for one of our undergraduate degrees\n\nHave the highest score in the online assessment\n\nHave a minimum of AAB at A Level (or equivalent)\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nFollow the scholarships link in your offer letter\n\nComplete the online scholarships assessment\n\nWe’ll add your final academic results to your submitted scholarships application when we have them\n\nWhat is the application deadline?\n\nFor courses starting in September 2024 – Applications are closed\n\nFor courses starting in January 2025 – Sunday 17 November 2024\n\nWhen will the winners be announced?\n\nFor courses starting in September 2024 – Thursday 15 August 2024\n\nFor courses starting in January 2025 – Thursday 12 December 2024\n\nThe Sherryl Kintu Scholarship\n\nApplicable for: All undergraduate degrees, excluding apprenticeship programmes\n\nOverview\n\nThe Sherryl Kintu Scholarship has been set up as a tribute to, and in recognition of, the passions and interests of Sherryl Kintu.
