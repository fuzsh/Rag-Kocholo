        "text": "Welcome to the ICwS - Introducing Associate Research Fellow Professor Han-Ru Zhou who joined us earlier this year. Han-Ru Zhou is an associate professor of public law at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. He has held visiting positions at the University of Ottawa, the University of California, Berkeley and McGill University. Han-Ru has published in leading journals, including The Law Quarterly Review, the International Journal of Constitutional Law, the American Journal of Comparative Law and the American Journal of Legal History. He received his legal education at Montr√©al, Harvard University and the University of Oxford. https://lnkd.in/eAzQgtCx #PublicLaw #HumanRightsLaw #Commonwealth #ComparativeConstitutionalLaw #RuleofLaw\n\nEthnic diversity, like all forms, is a vital aspect of any degree program, especially in the field of law. As the world becomes increasingly globalized, the legal profession is evolving to reflect and understand a wide range of perspectives and experiences. Which programs in the United States are recognized for their ethnically diverse student bodies? We take a closer look at schools like Harvard Law School New York University School of Law University of California, Berkeley - School of Law and Georgetown University Law Center. üëÄ üéì #LLMGuide #LawSchool #LegalStudies #LLMPrograms\n\nToday, 19.07.2024, the academic year has ended at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen, and with it my one-year studies at the LMU Faculty of Law, which I had the pleasure of undertaking thanks to scholarships from the Erasmus+ programme and the German association GFPS. üéì During two semesters of study, I completed courses in the LL.M. programme in German Law (das Aufbaustudium in den Grundz√ºgen des Deutschen Rechts), which included civil law, criminal law and public law. These courses concluded with written examinations, in which I achieved the highest grade (A). The completion of the program is confirmed by the certificate I received. ‚öñÔ∏è I also attended classes as part of the regular law studies: civil law (Grundkurs Zivilrecht I, II), civil procedure (ZPO I, II), international civil procedure (IZVR) and tort law (Delikts- und Schadensrecht). Without a doubt, it was a special year: marked by intensive learning, top-level classes, excellent professors, and the discovery of a completely different model of legal education and studying law. üîú (In any case) to be continued...ü•®\n\nGood afternoon LinkedIn family!! I am currently in the process of conducting my Senior Capstone Research Project, with the guidance of Dr. Marisela Martinez-Cola, about the sentiments of African-American legal students (current students and graduates) attending Ivy League schools. I decided to do this research primarily because I plan on attending law school. I want to apply to law school for the Fall 2025 cycle and have my eye on various Ivy League institutions. So, I want to learn firsthand African-American law students' attitudes towards their institutions and how they are socialized in that space. Secondly, I want to do this research because hardly any studies focus specifically on African-American law students. I would like to offer research that details African-American law students' experiences, trials, and successes to the academic community. To achieve this goal and write a robust study, I need your help. Please disseminate the attached survey link and flyer to current African-American law students or graduates and encourage them to complete it. I would greatly appreciate your help and hope you decide to oblige my request. Feel free to reach out with any questions. Thank you!
