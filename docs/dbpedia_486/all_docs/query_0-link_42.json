London and Cardiff can both be reached by public transport within an hour. Bristol’s proximity to Wales provides the opportunity to explore its capital city as well as its beautiful countryside.\n\nBristol is also a short distance from the county of Somerset, a popular tourist destination due to its scenic meadows, array of beaches and ancient sites to explore. Somerset is also home to the ancient city of Bath, getting its name from the Roman-build baths built around 70AD making them over 2000 years old.\n\nBargain shopper haven\n\nThe city is known for its open and progressive atmosphere, and the approach to sustainability is no exception.

You’ll find festivals for film, nature, live music, and food to name a few and events held year round to celebrate the communities which call Bristol home.\n\nOne of the most popular, and unique, events is the Bristol Balloon Fiesta – a free, three day event on the outskirts of the city – which sees over 100 hot air balloons take to the air overhead.

Located close to the coastal towns of Portishead and Western-super-Mare, you can take a walk along the seaside and explore the scenic local areas.\n\nIn nearby Somerset is the striking National Trust Site Cheddar Gorge. The gorge is an impressive sight with 40-foot-high cliffs, formed in the ice age.
