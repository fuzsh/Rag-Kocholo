        "text": "High School Essay Contest\n\nThank you to all participants in this year’s high school essay contest. We have made final decisions and notified finalists accordingly. We have also emailed all other participants announcing the end of the contest. Thank you again for your wonderful efforts and we look forward to your submissions next year. Enjoy the rest of your summer!\n\nFreedom of Speech and Social Media: The Battle Between Censorship and Misinformation\n\nFreedom of speech, a principle embedded in the First Amendment of the US Constitution, is regarded as a pinnacle of American freedom. The First Amendment allows one to speak against the government without consequence and to engage in discussion with those who hold differing opinions. In the current social media age, free speech frequently occurs on online platforms that are monitored by corporations such as Meta and X. An interesting case currently on the Supreme Court docket, Murthy v. Missouri, will analyze whether and how social media platforms can limit freedom of speech to reduce misinformation – an issue that would not have reached the docket 10 years ago.\n\nPrompt Question\n\nGiven the importance of the First Amendment regarding the freedom of expression and the right to access information, do you believe that removing harmful ideas is an adequate way to combat misinformation on social media platforms and the internet? Your essay should balance the principle of free speech with the value of suppressing speech that could lead to societal harm, such as Covid-19 medical misinformation or hate speech. Discuss in your response whether you think restricting speech, for any reason, should be allowed under the First Amendment.[1] [2] [3]\n\nPlease submit any questions via email to CULR’s Online Co-Executive Editors Andrea Ruiz ‘25 (acr2209@columbia.edu) and Devon Hunter ‘25 (dmh2226@columbia.edu) with the subject line “CULR High School Essay Contest Inquiry.”\n\nPast Results\n\n2023 High School Essay Contest\n\nPrompt: Education and the Law: A Way Forward\n\nEducation has long been viewed as the great equalizer, breaking boundaries that separate race, gender, and social class in the relentless pursuit of knowledge. While the law has served as a transformative force in how citizens interact with the educational system, it has also been weaponized to deny equal access to a vital public good to historically-marginalized groups. International treaties have been successful in helping eliminate unjust discrimination and in expanding equal access to education, especially for women and girls. Civil rights legislation, First Amendment jurisprudence, and other constitutional principles have all impacted the public education system in the United States. The proliferation of book bans and restrictions on the teaching of pedagogical theories attempt to use the law to restrict learning.\n\nGiven the various ways in which the law affects educational opportunities in the United States and around the world consider one of the following questions:\n\nHow has the law been used to expand or deny equal access to education, especially for marginalized groups?\n\nWhat should be the role of the law in determining school curricula?\n\nHow can schools strike a delicate balance between affording legal rights to their students while preserving an environment conducive to learning?\n\nDiscuss these questions with reference to at least one court case or legal document (treaty, legislation, etc.), which can come from any legal system (state or national courts in any country or international courts and tribunals). Please feel free to draw from any of the aforementioned topics and/or bodies of law in your response.\n\nFirst Place:\n\n“Prison Education: Laying the Groundwork for Accountability and Rehabilitation”\n\nAshwin Telang, West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South\n\n2022 High School Essay Contest\n\nPrompt: Reimagining Gender Justice in the Law\n\nThe problem of establishing gender justice in domestic and international legal systems has taken on renewed significance in recent years, both in light of gendered inequities worsened by the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing military and political conflicts, and work by activists across the world for legal recognition of gendered harassment, violence, and barriers to social mobility. In your view, in what ways—and to what extent—can demands for gender justice be realized in our legal system(s)? Discuss this question with reference to at least one court case or legal document (treaty, legislation, etc.), which can be from any legal system (state or national courts in any country, or international courts and tribunals). Your answer can focus on one or more aspects of gender justice, such as employment and labor law, gendered violence and harassment, and intersections of gender with race, disability, or religion. You can work within a context that is national (i.e. one nation’s state or constitutional law), comparative (i.e. comparing two or more countries’ legal systems), or international (i.e. studying international courts, tribunals, and bodies).\n\nThis contest was launched in collaboration with in partnership with the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) Project at Columbia Law School, advised by Katherine Franke, James L. Dohr Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, and Ting Ting Cheng, civil rights attorney and Director of the ERA Project.\n\nFirst Place:\n\n“Building A Gender-competent International Legal Framework on Sexual Violence”\n\nQirui Jiang, Desheng School"
