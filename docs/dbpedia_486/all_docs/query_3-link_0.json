        "text": "A typical offer for the LLB Law programme is A*AA at A-Level, or AAB for a contextual offer. Our standard offer for the IB is 38 points overall with 18 at Higher Level. The contextual offer is 34 points overall with 17 at Higher Level.\n\nFind out more about our contextual offers.\n\nYou can find out more about our entry requirements for international students (including English language requirements) on our admissions statement.\n\nFor law, we may interview mature students with old or non-standard qualifications. The interview will be conducted by at least two people, at least one of whom has been trained in fair and effective recruitment techniques, and undertaken in accordance with the University’s policy on equal opportunities. The criteria for assessing interview performance may include, for example: demonstrated interest in, suitability for, and commitment to the subject; evidence of clear thinking and understanding, problem solving and analytical skills; standard of spoken English; appropriateness of the Bristol course in relation to the applicant’s declared interests and aspirations; non-academic achievement and/or experience, or extra-curricular interests, that indicate the likely contribution an applicant will make to the life of the University; positions of responsibility held; other relevant skills.\n\nWe send out start of term information to new students in September/early Autumn once all places on the undergraduate law programmes are confirmed. We would advise students not to purchase any law books before you start the course, as we review the reading lists every year and there may be additional recommended texts or new editions on the list. If students would like to prepare themselves for studying law before starting the course, then they may find it helpful to read ‘The Successful Law Student: An Insider’s Guide to Studying Law’,written by Imogen Moore, a former colleague in the Law School.\n\nSection A consists of 42 multiple choice questions. You will have done well if you answer over 50% of them correctly. Section B, the essay, is assessed internally by each university and so you do not receive an official score for it. The overall LNAT grade used by the University uses the following weightings: 60% multiple choice questions and 40% essay. In exceptional cases (where a candidate’s A-level and GCSE results (or equivalent) together with MCQ results would meet the entrance requirements), the essay may not be assessed. We envisage that this would apply in only a small number of cases. The LNAT essay therefore remains an important part of the application process.\n\nThe Law School is committed to excellence and innovation in teaching, and to ensuring that law students’ learning experience is both stimulating and challenging.\n\nThe Law School is a top 10 UK law school (Complete University Guide UK 2024).\n\nThe University of Bristol is ranked 54th in the world (QS World University Rankings 2025) and is in the top 5 most targeted universities by top UK employers (High Fliers Research 2024).\n\nOur law degrees are underpinned by research from world-leading academics - ranked third in the UK for legal research excellence (THE analysis of REF 2021).\n\nIn the latest Teaching Excellency Framework (TEF), the University was given a silver award. From a student perspective, studying law at the University of Bristol means being taught by a range of talented academics working at the cutting edge of their research fields, bringing world-class legal expertise directly into the classroom.\n\nOur standard LLB programme lasts for three years, and programmes with a study abroad year last for four years.\n\nWeekly contact hours vary: they are made up of lectures, large group sessions, seminars, tutorials, and other meetings. Students are expected to undertake independent study each week to supplement taught activity - find out more about undergraduate study. In your first year, you can usually expect at least 8 hours of in-person contact time per teaching week.\n\nYes, large group lectures (or equivalent) are recorded and made available on our virtual learning environment, along with a variety of other learning resources to support your studies.\n\nIf you have a disability, you can find out more about study support and access available to you on our disability support pages. In addition to the University’s Disability Services, we have a Law School Disability Coordinator to respond to any queries and help put in place any additional support that you may need during your law studies.\n\nLaw is a subject that involves a lot of independent study and a large amount of reading. In total, students are expected to spend at least 40 hours per week on their studies. There is directed reading provided in advance to prepare for group sessions, with access to online learning resources, such as through our library and online learning portal. Your first year units will help you develop legal research and writing skills, including how tolocate and read legal judgments, academic articles and texts, as well as other key sources, such as parliamentary and government publications, and legislation.\n\nYes. If you are studying on our LLB programme, you can choose one optional unit in first year, and further optional units during your second and final years. We currently have a broad and diverse range of undergraduate units, which reflect the wide variety of approaches to legal research adopted by the academic staff in the Law School and provide insight into the diversity of career paths possible with a law degree. There may also be scope to study non-law optional units in other departments/faculties.\n\nIf you are studying on a joint honours programme, i.e. Law with French/German/Spanish, you will have fewer optional units overall. However, you will have the opportunity to study optional units both in Law and in Modern Languages.\n\nThe university is undergoing a major review of curriculums with the aim of reducing the number of units/modules studied at any one time and reducing the burden of end-of-year assessment.\n\nFrom 2024/25, some of our units will continue to be delivered as year-long units, assessed at the end of the academic year. Other units will be delivered and assessed within half-year ‘teaching blocks' or semesters.\n\nThe standard pattern will be to take two units throughout the whole year (in first year, this will be the Criminal Law and Law of Contract units). You will also take two additional units per teaching block.\n\nOur current intention is to continue to offer all the same subjects we currently offer.\n\nYes. Students have the opportunity to express their views through the Staff-Student Liaison Committee. The Staff-Student Liaison Committee meets five times a year giving student representatives the opportunity to engage directly with staff and feed into decisions about educational provision and support throughout the academic year. The Law School also has student representation on the Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity Committee (EDI), which meets throughout the year to develop and oversee EDI related initiatives and policies in the school. Students are also asked to provide feedback on teaching each year, by completing unit questionnaires and completing the University of Bristol Student Survey.\n\nStudents have the opportunity to express their views through the Staff-Student Liaison Committee. The Staff-Student Liaison Committee meets four times a year giving student representatives the opportunity to engage directly with staff and feed into decisions about educational provision and support throughout the academic year. Student representatives are also able to get involved with the Faculty of Arts, Law and Social Sciences student network and within the Student Academic Representation Network.\n\nThe Law School also has student representation on the Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity Committee (EDI), which meets throughout the year to develop and oversee EDI related initiatives and policies in the school. Students are also asked to provide feedback on teaching each year, by completing unit questionnaires and completing the University of Bristol Student Survey.\n\nBristol is a major centre for the study of modern languages and cultures, with the Law School offering three Law and Languages courses; Law and French, Law and Spanish and Law and German. On these four-year joint honours courses students will study language, linguistics, literature, history and culture to degree level alongside core units in law. This provides students with a valuable skill set, ideally tailored to the globalised workplace. Students also have the opportunity to spend a third year studying abroad at a partner university in the country related to the course (i.e. France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Chile). During this year abroad, students study law and law-related units in the language of that country.\n\nThe Law with Study in Continental Europe course offers the opportunity for students to study abroad at one of our partner universities in Europe. These currently include universities in Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, Italy*, Cyprus, the Netherlands and Poland - in addition to France*, Germany* and Spain*.\n\nStudents can apply to transfer to our Law with Study in Continental Europe degree from the LLB Law course at the end of their first year. Selection is based on first-year results (and language ability if students select a country where the course will not be taught in English).\n\nStudents on the Law with Study in Continental Europe course study only law during their three years in Bristol, while during the year abroad, students study law and law-related units. Visit our Global Opportunities website for more information about where you can study abroad.\n\n*indicates a country where the course is taught in the local language rather than English.\n\nOur Law with Study Abroad course offers students the opportunity to spend the third year abroad at one of our partner universities outside Europe, which currently include institutions in Australia, Chile*, Colombia*, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico* and Singapore.\n\nStudents can apply to transfer to our Study Abroad degree from the LLB Law course at the end of their first year.

The Bridge Programme consistes of two programme strands: 'Bridge to the SQE' for prospective Solicitors and 'Bridge to the Bar' for aspiring Barristers.\n\nFind out more about the routes to qualification, the programme and available scholarships.\n\nPlease note that the Bridge Programme is NOT an SQE prep course.\n\nWe welcome students from over 40 countries around the world each year, with some wishing to practice law in England and Wales afterwards – or take the knowledge of their legal education to apply in their home country or elsewhere. Some countries such as India share a legal system based on English common law, meaning it is easier to qualify and enter practice there. Students who wish to practice law in another jurisdiction should contact the regulatory body for that jurisdiction.\n\nGraduates from the University of Bristol are amongst the top 5 most targeted by top employers in the UK (High Fliers 2024). While many of our graduates go on to pursue legal careers in leading law firms and chambers, our research-informed curriculum and the diversity of research represented within the School means graduates have access to a wide range of alternative careers in areas such as policy, government, human rights and more. Find out more on our careers and employability webpages.\n\nAt the University of Bristol, we understand that, before students go into the professional world, it is important to receive quality training in the foundational elements of law and opportunities to develop key skills, such as critical thinking and analysis, as well as oral and written communication skills. As such, the majority of legal studies at the University of Bristol will be introducing students to key legal concepts and helping to refine the skills which are vital for future professional careers, whether in law or beyond.\n\nIn addition, we offer a range of practical opportunities during the degree to experience how law works in action. This could be by joining our award-winning Law Clinics and working with real clients, or participating in one of our various mentoring schemes, gaining valuable insights into a variety of legal and non-legal sectors. Find out more on our careers and employability webpages.\n\nWe have a dedicated Law School Employability Adviser available for one-to-one careers appointments and advice. Students are offered an extensive programme of careers focused sessions and networking opportunities each year. We aim to give our students wide exposure to a diverse range of employers (at our annual Law Fair - hosting over 40 legal employers) and career paths during their time with us. Students will have the opportunity to speak with different employers about the practical opportunities on offer to law students.\n\nWhether you wish to pursue a career in our outside law, we aim to equip you with a wealth of knowledge and skills to enable you to excel in your future career. Watch our careers support video to find out more about the ways we support you at Bristol.\n\nThe Law School's MA Law is an accelerated, postgraduate degree in law which is open to non-law graduates. The MA curriculum builds on the fact that students will have already benefited from a university-level education. Students will graduate with a wider legal knowledge and a deeper understanding of law and legal reasoning, than can be obtained in a one-year law conversion course.\n\nThe MA Law curriculum is based on the seven 'Foundations of Legal Knowledge', providing students with the skills associated with graduate legal work.\n\nThe route to qualifying as a solicitor has now changed, with the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) introducing a new Solicitors Qualifying Exam (SQE).\n\nThe route to qualifying as a barrister has also changed, with the Bar Standards Board having introduced the Bar Training Course.\n\nThe Law School has partnered with BPP University to offer the free BPP Bridge Programme to final year students.

We strongly encourage you to tell us about your disability so that we can prepare to support you before you join us. No applicant will be disadvantaged in the admissions process due to a disability, learning difficulty, health or mental health condition. When you disclose a disability, the admissions process we follow is identical to the process for all applicants. For more information visit the Disability Services web page.\n\nThe Law School is committed to sustaining a positive and mutually supportive working environment for staff and students, ensuring individuals are treated equally and are able to access the same opportunities. To support this, the School's Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity (EDI) Committee provides a point of contact for staff, students and external persons if they have issues or ideas concerning LGBT+, Income, Gender, Disability or Racial inequalities, and to address ways to improve Law School policies in these areas. We also have a Law School Disability Coordinator as a key point of contact and to help you with any additional support you may need for your academic studies.\n\nAs well as focusing on the accessibility of Careers support within the University generally, the University has a partnership with an organisation called EmployAbility allowing students to access a wide range of support in relation to their career aspirations as well as running events within the Law School examining the career experiences of alumni with disabilities and specifically careers within the law for those with a disability."
