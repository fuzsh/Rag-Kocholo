if we are unable to respond within the statutory time-frame, and we

Thank you for your Freedom of Information request.

In order for a request made under this legislation to be valid, it must

contain the requester's name, as stated in Section

8(1)(b). A requester may be an individual, a company or an organisation

but a name is required. Failure to provide this

invalidates the request and prevents the requester from seeking recourse

from the Information Commissioner's Office

(ICO) should they need to do so.

Therefore, before we can process your request, we require enough of your

real name to give anyone reading that request

a reasonable indication of your identity. It is sufficient to provide any

variation of title or first name combined with your

surname. Alternatively, a combination of middle name and surname will also

be acceptable. However, a first name or

surname in isolation, or the use of just initials, will be insufficient.

Kind Regards,

Freedom of Information team

confirm that the information requested is held by the University of

Bristol (the “University”).

five because these are personal data for this parties or, if linked with

other personal identifiers in the public domain, would be likely to become

personal data. This information has been withheld under section 40(2) of

the Act, on the grounds that disclosure would likely breach the data

protection principles enshrined in the Data Protection Act 2018.
