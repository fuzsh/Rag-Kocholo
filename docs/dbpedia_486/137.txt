Dear Matthew Johnson,

Freedom of Information Request (our reference FOI2385)

We refer to your Freedom of Information request dated 15/02/2023.

You requested the following information:

"Could you please provide a table of the numbers achieving each

degree classification (distinction, merit, pass, or fail) for every LLM

degree course and MA course offered by your University of Bristol Law

School and for each of the last 5 years separately.

Also, could you please provide a table of the number of application

received, number of offer been made, and number of new student registered

for every LLM degree course and MA course offered by your University of

Bristol Law School and for each of the last 5 years separately."

University’s Response

Further to Section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the “Act”) we

confirm that the information requested is held by the University of

Bristol (the “University”).

Please refer to the attached documents.

Please note that the University does not release exact counts of less than

five because these are personal data of third parties or, if linked with

other personal identifiers in the public domain, would be likely to become

personal data. This information has been withheld under section 40(2) of

the Act, on the grounds that disclosure would likely breach the data

protection principles enshrined in the Data Protection Act 2018.

Internal Review Procedure

If you are dissatisfied with the handling of your request, then you have a

right under Section 50 of the Act to request an internal review.

All such requests must be sent to us within 40 days, and must clearly

state our reference number (at the top of this email) and your reason for

requesting an internal review.

We will aim to respond to your request for an internal review within 20

working days of receipt.

Your request for an internal review should be sent to [University of

Bristol request email], quoting your FOI reference number. Alternatively,

you could post it to:

Director of Legal Services

Secretary’s Office

University of Bristol

Beacon House

Queens Road

Bristol

BS8 1QU

Information Commissioners Office

Should you remain dissatisfied with the final outcome of the internal

review then you may apply directly to the Information Commissioner (the

“ICO”) for an independent review. The ICO is the Government’s Independent

Body responsible for overseeing the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the

Data Protection Act 2018 and The Environmental Information Regulations

2004.

Please note the ICO will only review cases that have exhausted the

University’s internal review procedure. All correspondence to the ICO must

quote the University’s reference number and your reasons for your appeal.

The ICO’s contact details are as follows:

The Information Commissioners Office

Wycliffe House

Water Lane

Wilmslow
