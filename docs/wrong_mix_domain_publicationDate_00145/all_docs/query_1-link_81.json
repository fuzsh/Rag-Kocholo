        "text": "Current Issue • Departments • Bibliography\n\nRESULTS OF F&SF COMPETITION #76\n\n\"Childish Things\"\n\nIN OUR last competition, entrants rewrote their favorite genre stories in the style of the author as a child. As you can see, some children were less mature (and therefore more entertaining) than others. We're giving the funny ones a gold star.\n\nSpecial mention goes to Matthew King, whose entry almost but not quite mirrored the second place winner.\n\nFIRST PRIZE:\n\nDune, by Frank Herbert\n\nBad guys kill this kid's whole family, but he hooks up with the coolest guys on the planet: These bad-ass warriors in black leather cruising around the desert in boss dune buggies. No, wait! Better! They're cruising around the desert riding—GIANT WANGS!\n\n—Matthew Sanborn Smith\n\nPort St. Lucie, FL\n\nSECOND PRIZE:\n\nTime Enough for Love, by Robert Heinlein\n\nWhen I get older I'm going to be a soldier and fight in a war and come home and marry Mommy.\n\n—Michael D. Turner\n\nColorado Springs, CO\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\n\"The Lurking Fear\" by H. P. Lovecraft\n\nEven now being a full ten years old, I can hear the creaking of the swings swaying back and forth as they break the laws of geometry invented by that Greek guy whose name I keep forgetting.\n\n—Byron Bailey\n\nJonesboro, IN\n\n\"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\" by Harlan Ellison\n\nMy little brother bugs me all day when I am home from school. I hate him, but Mom says I shouldn't say things like that. So now I pretend I have no mouth and I scream as loud as I can with my mouth closed at my brother. Hah hah!\n\n—Steven L. Rosenhaus\n\nForest Hills, NY\n\nWhen Worlds Collide, by Philip Wylie\n\nThis big planet smacks into the Earth, splatt!! wham!! and the Earth explodes, wha-booom!! and everybody dies \"oh no! oh no! aaaaaaa!! aaaaaaa!!\" but these scientists built a spaceship, and everyone was like \"let us on! let us on!\" so they shot them, rattattatt!! and flew to the new planet, ka-whoosh!!\n\n—Mark Shainblum\n\nMontreal, Quebec, Canada\n\nF&SF COMPETITION #77: FOUND IN TRANSLATION\n\nTake a science fiction/fantasy story title and translate it into a different language. (We suggest you run potential titles through a translator like babelfish.yahoo.com.) Then rewrite the plot based on the new title, and make it as wacky as your imagination allows.\n\nYou have six chances to make us laugh. Make sure your entries are no more than fifty words apiece, and remember to include your address. Really. We mean it.\n\nExample:\n\nI, Robot by Isaac Asimov = Yo, Robusteza (Spanish)\n\nHerbie the Robot noticed Susan Calvin was attracted to Milton Ashe. Herbie suggested Ashe might notice her if she were stronger, more robust. Or just had a larger bust."
