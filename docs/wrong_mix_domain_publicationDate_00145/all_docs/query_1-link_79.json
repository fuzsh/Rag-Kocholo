        "text": "What pre-1985 science fiction are you reading or planning to read this month. Here’s March’s installment of this column.\n\nBefore we get to books and birthdays and writing plans…\n\nContinue reading →\n\n1. A complete unknown! As is frequently the case, I discovered it during a lengthy Internet Speculative Fiction Database browse a few weeks back. I’m not sure what to expect. Although the back cover is problematic –“In danger of losing her sanity, her virginity, and even her life”–is her sanity less important than her virginity? Who knows.\n\n2. John Brunner short stories! He’s a favorite and I buy his collections on site.\n\nA few John Brunner short fictions I’ve particularly enjoyed:\n\n“Nobody Axed You” (1965)\n\n“Lungfish” (1957)\n\n“The Last Lonely Man” (1964)\n\n3. In my late teens I read every Dune novel I could get my hands on—including those written by Frank Herbert’s son Brian (I don’t remember being impressed). And yes, I’ve decided to read some of Brian Herbert’s non-Dune related SF.\n\n4. I’ve enjoyed the two Marta Randall novels I’ve reviewed.\n\nA City in the North (1976)\n\nIslands (1976)\n\nMight as well grab the last one I didn’t own? Right? It’s the sequel to Journey (1978).\n\nLet me know what books/covers intrigue you. Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Pzyche, Amanda Hemingway (aka Jan Siegel) (1982)\n\n(Uncredited cover for the 1982 edition) Continue reading →\n\n1. John Varley’s fantastic mind trapped in a computer after an accident while a lion in an underground Mars safari park short story “Overdrawn at the Memory Bank” (1977) inspired me to pick a collection of his late 70s and early 80s short stories—including the Nebula and Hugo-nominated “Beatnik Bayou” (1980) and the Hugo-nominated “The Barbie Murders” (1979).\n\n2. Colin Greenland’s oblique Daybreak on a Different Mountain (1984) is my type of fantasy—sculpted landscapes, a Ballard-inspired entropy-filled world, surreal sequences…. I picked up volume two in the loose Daybreak sequence.\n\n3. I am slowly working through Marta Randall’s novels–see my favorable reviews of Islands (1976) and A City in the North (1976)–and, despite the awful cover, snagged the first volume in her Kennerin Saga sequence.\n\n4. An finally, a complete unknown quantity…. My friend 2theD (who, unfortunately, has long retired his blog) described it as impossible to paraphrase, nebulous, linguistically inspired….\n\nLet me know what books/covers intrigue you. Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n~\n\n1. The Barbie Murders, John Varley (1980)\n\n(David Plourde’s cover for the 1980 edition) Continue reading →\n\n(Vincent Di Fate’s cover for the 1976 edition)\n\n3.75/5 (Good)\n\nMarta Randall’s A City in the North (1976), is a work of anthropological SF that focuses on “authentic” relationships between its human and alien characters (see note). A commentary on the societal effects and cultural disconnects between natives, explorers, and colonizers, A City in the North refuses to provide easy answers. Although retreating into an occasional stock evil character to jolt the plot forward, on the whole Randall’s novel intrigues and provokes due to the underlying mysteries of native culture and ritual. Continue reading →\n\n(Norman Adams’ cover for the 1977 edition)\n\n3.25/5 (collated rating: Good)\n\nAccording to a list compiled by Ian Sales [here] only a handful of SF anthologies have hit print solely featuring women authors—none were published before 1972 and, surprisingly, few after 1980 (there seems to be a resurgence in the last few years). The Crystal Ship (1976) ed. Robert Silverberg, is one of these. It contains the three novellas by three important SF authors who got their start in the 70s: Marta Randall, Joan D. Vinge, Vondra McIntyre. The latter two achieved critical success: Joan D. Vinge won the Hugo for her novel The Snow Queen (1980) and Vonda N. McIntyre won the Hugo for her novel Dreamsnake (1978). Marta Randall, on the other hand, despite her Nebula nomination for the intriguing Islands (1976) remains to this day lesser known.\n\nAll three of the novellas feature impressive female protagonists and narratives that subvert many of SF’s traditional Continue reading →\n\nA nice mix with some gorgeous Powers’ covers—some 30s + 50s pulp, three novellas in one of only a handful of female SF author anthologies ever published, and another John Brunner novel for my extensive collections (it’s an expanded novel from one of his earlier pulp works, hopefully he improved the original version).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n1. After Worlds Collide, Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer (1933)\n\n(Richard Powers’ cover for the 1963 edition)\n\nFrom the back cover: “When the group of survivors from Earth landed on Bronson Beta, they expected absolute desolation. This Earth-like planet from another universe had been hurtling through space, cold and utter darkness for countless millennia. All life should have perished millions of years ago. But the Earth-people found a breathtakingly beautiful city, encased in a huge, transparent metal bubble; magnificent apartments filled with every luxury; food for a lifetime in the vast, empty kitchens; but with no trace either of life—or death. Then the humans learned they were not alone on Bronson Beta…” Continue reading →\n\nSome goodies (finally reaching the bottom of my large pile of unreported SF—holiday leftovers, one or two Half Price/Thrift store visits, birthday gifts).\n\nMy second collection (need more!) of Malzberg short stories eagerly wants to be read!\n\nAn Asimov collection, Buy Jupiter and Other Short Stories (1975), that was inexpensive and also low on my list of books to read. As readers know, one of my first SF novels I ever read was The Currents of Space (1952)… That said, Asimov has nostalgic allure but none of the many subsequent novels of his I have read have proved, in my opinion, his supposed “genius talent” and cult of “hero worship.”\n\nBoth the Malzberg and Asimov collections have brief intro essays to each story and random autobiographical fragments—smacks of filler. But, perhaps there will be some intriguing observations (although, I rather not know that Malzberg wrote a particular short story in only an hour, or that Asimov took a bet from a pretty female editor, blah, blah, blah).\n\nMarta Randall’s Islands (1976) was a solid read so it was only a matter of time before I acquired her superior (according to Ian Sales) A City in the North (1976). You have to feel for her, her books received some of the most horrid Vincent Di Fate covers possible….\n\nI suspect that The Sins of the Fathers (1973) by Stanley Schmidt is a forgettable 70s space opera but I am willing to give it a try.\n\nThoughts?\n\n1. The Man Who Loved the Midnight Lady, Barry N. Malzberg (1980)\n\n(Michael Flanagan’s cover for the 1980 edition) Continue reading →\n\n(Vincent Di Fate’s cover for the 1976 edition)\n\n3.5/5 (Good)\n\nNominated for the 1977 Nebula Award for Best Novel\n\n*Note: I read the 1980 Pocket edition which, according to Locus, was modified (to what extent I do not know) from the original 1976 first edition.\n\nMarta Randall, the first female president of SFWA, is one of numerous female science fiction writers from the 70s that are seldom read today. A while back Ian Sales alerted me to Randall’s work in his very positive review of A City in the North (1976) on SF Mistressworks. Recently, while looking for unread works on my immortality-themed SF list (here), I came across the Nebula-nominated Islands (1976).\n\nOne of the more effective ways to write about the ennui Continue reading →"
