        "text": "I grew up a voracious reader. In elementary school, I shared my classmates’ love for comic books – but, unlike my fellow classmates, I also had a passion for science fiction. It was a habit my mother fed, often surprising me with the books I would read through the summer months. From early July to late August, while all of my friends were out and about, my outdoor activities consisted of sitting poolside, flipping through sci-fi classics. There were a lot of terrific SF authors I discovered later in life (Octavia Butler, John Scalzi, Gene Wolfe) but, looking back, I really owe a lot to the following writers who helped shaped my imagination during those formative years where my creative output consisted of twisty short stories and The Robot Revolution, a 200+ page novel I handwrote on loose leaf during fourth grade…\n\n10) Pierre Boulle\n\nMakes the list purely on the strength of a single novel that gave birth to one of my favorite SF movie franchises of all time: The Planet of the Apes.\n\nFavorite book: Monkey Planet\n\n9) Michael Moorcock\n\nI discovered his science fiction work through my appreciation for his Elric of Melnibone fantasy series.\n\nFavorite Book: The Final Programme\n\n8) H.P. Lovecraft\n\nTechnically horror, yes, but with sci-fi underpinnings.\n\nFavorite short story: “The Colour Out of Space”\n\n7) Stephen King\n\nThough considered a horror author, it’s easy to overlook the fact he’s written some fabulous science fiction as well.\n\nFavorite short story: “The Lawnmower Man”\n\n6) Douglas Adams\n\nHis work greatly inspired my affinity for sci-fi with a sense of humor.\n\nFavorite book: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy\n\n5) Isaac Asimov\n\nOne of two SF titans who made multiple appearances on my mother’s Literary Gifts list.\n\nFavorite book: The End of Eternity\n\n4) James Blish\n\nHis Star Trek tie-in novels lined my bookshelves, but his original novels were equally great.\n\nFavorite book: A Case of Conscience\n\n3) Arthur C. Clarke\n\nThe second of the two SF titans who made multiple appearances on my mother’s Literary Gifts list. I loved the humanity in his stories.\n\nFavorite book: Childhood’s End\n\n2) Ray Bradbury\n\nIt started with an in-class reading assignment of “The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street” and continued with books like Fahrenheit 451 and The Martian Chronicles.\n\nFavorite book: The Illustrated Man\n\n1) Harlan Ellison\n\nLike Bradbury, a master of the short story. I’ve read everything he’s ever written twice over.\n\nFavorite book: I Have No Mouth & I Must Scream\n\nI’m sure there are more than a few sci-fi fans out there. Which classic authors inspired your love for the genre? Do tell.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays!"
