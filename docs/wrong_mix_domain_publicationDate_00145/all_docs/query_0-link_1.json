        "text": "March 3, 2012\n\nUnlike everyone else here, I really loved this book. I have read it at several times of transition in my life. As an African-American growing up and going to college in the Midwest, the title caught my attention. I liked the character development, from that persoective. Later, I felt that the Herberts were prophetic about the growing susceptibility of our political system and public opinion to manipulation by those with significant resources. There were also some interesting metaphors about the power of meditation and visualization.\n\nAugust 9, 2011\n\nI picked up this book hoping to further my appreciation of Frank Herbert's writing, but instead what I found was a Brian Herbert book. I read his book The Race for God which is a better story than this one but is still pretty typical. I've noticed the contrast between Brian Herbert' writing and his father's writing mostly in his continuation of the Dune series. Where his father's writing is deadly serious, imaginative and thoughtful, Brian Herbert's writings tends towards satire and a constant mocking of his own characters.\n\nThis novel seems unfinished. The blurb makes it sound like this is a chance to read a great 'buddy' or 'odd couple' story where an alien Dreen is trapped sharing a the body of the ambitious older son of the most wealthy man on earth presumably fighting over their body and making amusing mistakes along the way. The Dreens are pacifists and almost godlike in some of their abilities. The human son is damaged goods: crass and petty. The best the Dreen can do is act as his conscience for most of the novel as the human lurches from one unlikely scenario to another.\n\nThe authors make it pretty clear from the ending that the novel was intended as a monumental satire of greed and ambition, but the necessity of having the human as a sympathetic character for most of the novel seemed to be too awkward to fit into this story. Alot of it comes across as pointless or pointlessly obscene. The authors show no respect for the characters in the story. The plot isn't plausible. The action of the story is downright silly.\n\nI imagine in my head that maybe Frank Herbert died before he could shape the story into a proper novel, or that he was indulging his son by adding his own name to what was mostly his son's work. I've tried to see the Dune influence on this work and I can't. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone except someone who enjoys Brian Herbert's other work or for the Frank Herbert completist.\n\nSeptember 12, 2008\n\nIn \"Man of Two Worlds,\" an collaboration of minds between Frank Herbert of Dune fame and his son Brian Herbert, I found both pleasure and disappointment.\n\nFor anybody who's read Dune, they know Frank Herbert is capable of creating worlds and universes that are staggering in their complexity, economic focus, and mood.\n\nBut it's like Frank and Brian got together, created world(s), chose a plot, and purposely melded a serious universe with serious ideas onto unserious characters. All the characters in this novel are flippant, arrogant jerks (with a few notable exceptions).\n\nI did enjoy many ideas presented (idmaging, spirals, ambience of a Fifth Elementesque world). But overall I would call this experiement a failure because Frank Sr.'s seriousness does not meld well with Brian's apparent \"not so serious side.\" Ironically, it is somewhat like the main character in the novel -- the melding of Lutt/Ryll is comic in its dysfunction -- and so is the novel.\n\nAugust 11, 2021\n\nMan of Two Worlds just doesn't have any of Frank Herbert's poetic skill with language and world building in it. It actually reads like an early attempt at a novel by someone who grew up on pulp magazine sci fi, with a very Golden Age 1950s feel to it, bolstered by some actual 1980s hard science. If I had to guess, Brian Herbert wrote the bulk of the book very early on, then later collaborated with his father to try to polish it up for publication. The end result is still a slow slog of a story with selfish, unsympathetic characters I just couldn't bring myself to care about.\n\nMay 18, 2021\n\nUno de los peores libros que he leído. Se nota demasiado la mano del inepto del hijo.\n\nTodas las tramas son estúpidas. Los personajes igual. Aquella sutileza que impregna toda la obra de Frank Herbert aquí se torna vulgar, zafio, grosero, grotesco...\n\nNo podía dejar de pensar en como me recordaba las series infantiles de cadetes espaciales de Asimov y Heinlein pero para mal.\n\nLa idea no es mala pero el desarrollo es horrible y el final, precipitado.\n\nNo lo recomiendo.\n\nMarch 17, 2009\n\nFun story to read. Interesting take about responsibility for our creativity not only as a society but individually as well.\n\nSeptember 13, 2012\n\nMan what a weird, strange, dis-jointed, non-contiguous book!\n\nNo cohesive plot. Characters doing really weird things, for no apparent reason.\n\nBad, Bad, Bad.\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\nA student read it and I'm into Herbert but this didn't do it for me. An interesting premise but the characters never kept my attention.\n\nDecember 16, 2021\n\nI kept reading to the end because I became fascinated with how outrageously misogynistic and juvenile this book is. 1986, when it was written, seems like a foreign land now.\n\nMarch 23, 2023\n\n\"Man of Two Worlds\" by Frank Herbert is a fascinating and imaginative science fiction novel that explores the intersection between storytelling, creativity, and reality. The novel is set in a universe where the Dreens, a mysterious and enigmatic race of beings, possess the power to create entire worlds and realities through their storytelling abilities.\n\nThe novel follows the journey of Ryll, a Dreen who becomes intertwined with the human Lutt Hanson, creating a unique and compelling narrative that explores the complexities of identity, belonging, and the power of imagination. As Ryll and Hanson become more deeply entwined, the lines between reality and fantasy begin to blur, leading to an exhilarating and unpredictable adventure that will keep readers engaged until the very end.\n\nOne of the standout features of \"Man of Two Worlds\" is Herbert's masterful world-building. The novel is filled with rich, vivid descriptions of the various worlds and realities created by the Dreens, each one more fantastical and awe-inspiring than the last. From towering, crystalline cities to endless deserts and sprawling, sentient forests, Herbert's imagination knows no bounds, and readers will find themselves constantly in awe of the vivid and detailed worlds he has created.\n\nAt the same time, \"Man of Two Worlds\" also explores some deeper philosophical themes, particularly around the power of storytelling and the ways in which our imaginations shape our realities. Through the character of Ryll, Herbert presents a compelling case for the transformative power of creativity, showing how the act of telling stories can literally create new worlds and realities. This theme is particularly resonant in today's world, where the power of storytelling is more important than ever, as we grapple with issues ranging from climate change to social justice.\n\nAnother strength of \"Man of Two Worlds\" is the complexity of its characters. Both Ryll and Hanson are deeply flawed and multi-dimensional, with their own fears, desires, and motivations driving their actions. As the two characters become more deeply entwined, the tension between their two identities creates a powerful narrative engine, driving the story forward and keeping readers engaged.\n\nOverall, \"Man of Two Worlds\" is an excellent science fiction novel that will appeal to fans of the genre as well as anyone interested in exploring the power of imagination and storytelling. With its rich world-building, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes, this novel is sure to leave a lasting impression on readers and spark their own creativity and imagination.\n\nApril 21, 2023\n\nMan of Two Worlds may be the worst book signed by Frank Herbert that I've ever read. It features that nasty '50s newsroom trope, where single minded egotistical people (sometimes to the point of cruelty) get a pass because they are brilliant and they talk fast (and they own the newspaper). The characters are unsympathetic and rather not interesting, while the ideas in the book are dull and going nowhere. The plot itself is often inconsistent. I do suspect that this is more of a Brian than a Frank book, because none of the themes found in previous Frank Herbert books are found here (if one discounts the awkward depiction of women). Also the tiny Wikipedia page dedicated to the book lists Brian as the main author.\n\nIn short, the story is about a human and an alien merging accidentally and having to work together to get things done. Kind of like the authors were trying to do, huh? The setting is classic '50s sci-fi, with people living on Mars and Venus and going from planet to planet using vehicles that function like normal airlines, only in space. Meanwhile, the aliens are trying to destroy Earth because they fear humans - not sure how that would work since they already live on other planets, and the humans have their own familial issues to resolve - including an uncle with god-like powers but no apparent care about the outcome of anything he does.\n\nThere are many issues with the book that I am not going to go into. I almost did not finish it. However, someone else might enjoy it, so no need to rant in this review. Suffice to say that the book feels insulting when it is not boring, which is most of the time. I don't recommend it.\n\nMarch 2, 2023\n\nSomewhat amusing, though often sexist. On the surface, it is about the struggles of a very naive and pacifist alien who has to share a human's body after their spaceships collide. Beyond this, it is an intense criticism of the immorality and power struggles of extremely wealthy people.\n\nThe naive alien race called Dreamers represent good. The humans represent evil. But, of course, nothing is really that simple. Consider that the alien in the spaceship crash was a joyriding alien adolescent who had stolen the spaceship he crashed in. In addition, the alien's pacifist race created Earth and humans, and then decided the humans were dangerous and had to be completely annihilated/erased. On the other hand, the virgin from the prostitute ship is the most decent character in the book, although for a long time she pressured the eldest son of Earth's wealthiest family to marry her because she wanted his wealth.\n\nThis book was not as good as \"Dune,\" but it was much better than the last Frank Herbert book I read, \"The White Plague.\"\n\nJanuary 3, 2021\n\nThis book was a bit of a mess, but some of the ideas were interesting and I enjoyed reading it, so 3 stars anyway.\n\nIt could have been a much better book with more depth and backstory. Instead, there was a lot of stuff, which sometimes felt like it was added to move the plot along but without much explanation (e.g. the Soothers). This missing backstory made for more empty characters. The Dreens are mostly unbelievable, because they are summed up as idiot-savants. What? That doesn't explain anything. It just leads to a common trope that humans are special in some way (here crafty and devious) and aliens are missing something and are naive.\n\nFebruary 11, 2024\n\n07 August 2007 - **. Frank Herbert's last book, written in collaboration with his son Brian Herbert, is a very slow starter. I might have put it down if I hadn't been on an overnight train ride with little else to read. About half way through, I came to realize that it is not just cheesy bad writing, but satirical by intent. Every character in the book, alien and human alike, is driven by greed and a lust for power to an extreme degree. By the second half of the book, this finally propels the plot into bizarre and comic consequences. I appreciated learning that Frank Herbert did have a sense of humor, although it's a little too subtle to make this a really successful parody.\n\nJuly 2, 2024\n\nOK, I didn't understand all of this one, but it was pretty good. Could have used a bit more exposition, I guess. From my perspective, a bunch of people make all these random moves and I have no idea why. Why is Lutt obsessed with having sex with Nishi, thinking her his dreamgirl NiNi? And if the price of having sex with her is marrying her, why is that so furiously off the table? This could be called The Adventures of Lutt and His Big Swinging Dick, only there aren't really any sex scenes.\n\nLike I say, it doesn't necessarily make sense. But it's not bad.\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nThe nest thing to get from this book is knowing I don't ever need to read or watch Dune because it's the same author. This started out kind of interesting, then just became horribly boring & ridiculously rushed.\n\nApril 23, 2023\n\nclever and original conflict\n\nLiked that Earth and life were created by alien creatures that could rearrange matter by will alone. It never bothered me that no explanations were provided for the existence of the Dreens\n\nApril 9, 2018\n\nFunny and a nice collaboration between father and son Herbert.\n\nApril 2, 2019\n\nI missed reading Herbert's creations. Interesting ideas and concepts. Idmaging sounds like a good skill to have. A bit of an abrupt ending but overall a well written and captivating book.\n\nSeptember 6, 2020\n\nEven better than I remembered. There were so many things I had forgotten about this awesome story.\n\nJune 14, 2023\n\n3.5; some of the novel was thoughtful, some parts felt silly\n\nMarch 12, 2017\n\nUma engraçada colaboração pai filho que originou um livro com um estilo distinto dos 2 mas bastante divertido de ler.\n\nUm livro sobre a fusão de um terreno com um Dreen que tem a capacidade de idmaginar coisas. O hilariante é esse terreno ser filho de um milionário ambicioso e controlador no planeta Terra e isso representar um jogo de quem consegue controlar quem no final.\n\nMay 11, 2007\n\nThe whole time I was reading this book I couldn’t figure out whether I liked it, and then I couldn’t even really understand the ending, and I’m still not sure if I liked it. It’s certainly very different, and not as good as, Dune, but I didn’t expect them to be the same. The story is that there are these creatures called Dreens who live on the planet Dreenor, and everything in the universe is the result of their “idmaging,” which is creating things from the protoplasmic essence of the universe. They created Earth, but now some of them want to destroy it (“erase” it). A teenage Dreen who thinks he’s a hot-shot steals the ship that’s supposed to erase Earth and gets into a crash with an Earth ship carrying a spoiled rich jerk who’s father is extremely powerful and whose family is superbly screwed up. Both are injured in the crash, and they end up sharing the same body. The details of sharing the same body are pretty funny. Over the course of the book the Dreens try to decide whether to send additional Dreens to erase Earth, and the people on Earth struggle with each other for power and money. There is a war between the Chinese and the French on Venus. There are something called Spirals that carry Dreen spaceships through the universe, and which humans are beginning to discover. There is the very strange uncle, the Raj Dood, of the guy who shares his body with the Dreen, and his wife Osceola, who live in a swamp in Florida but use the Spirals to travel to Venus regularly. Overall a strange, somewhat humorous, but overall confusing book. It feels like a half-baked concept in many ways, as so much is never explained or not explained in time to make sense for much of the book. And the end is confusing; what ever happened to the Dreens? They went to another dimension or something, but they supposedly didn’t even know about different dimensions. And now the future of Earth lies on the two remaining Dreen left. Ryll, the teenage Dreen, doesn’t act like a teenager much; doesn’t he ever miss his family? Overall the book was fun but not great.\n\nJune 12, 2023\n\nUnbelievable\n\nThe really unbelievable part is I recall reading this book as a teen and liking it...\n\nMaybe I am being too harsh concerning this book, but I expected better than what's in this story. Especially when reading the foreword introduction it is discussed how the two Herberts would go over each chapter looking for inconsistencies and plot errors. Something was off in their review efforts, because I found plenty! Did not finish this time.\n\nBut I'll add 1 for the remembrance.\n\nDecember 19, 2007\n\nAn enjoyable read but i honestly think that this book was way over my head when i read it (early twenties.) i should re-read it now. i think i'm at least 25% wiser. ;-)\n\nThe plotting and characters are pretty out-there sci/fi. Probably too much symbolism and allegory for a young and inexperienced mind.\n\nNow, Frank Herbert gets the credit for writing this but from what i remember, i don't have the book any more, he had a co-writer.\n\nApril 6, 2022\n\n“It’s alright Martin, it’s over now” Alice said.\n\n“No. No. It’s not…” Martin replied, his flat affect a shocking counterpoint to the tears quivering in his eyes.\n\n“But you finished it, you never have to read Man of Two Worlds again. No one ever has to read it again!”\n\n“You don’t understand!” He replied, his emotion finally reaching his voice. “I think… Oh god, I think… they meant for it to be funny.”"
