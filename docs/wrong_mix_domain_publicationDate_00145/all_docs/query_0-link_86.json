Winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick Awards, this book is the OG of cyberpunk.\n\nWilliam Gibson created a future where hackers dive into a digital world called cyberspace. Sounds familiar, right? Well, this book did it first, that’s why it’s the OG!\n\nWe meet Case, a washed-up hacker, on one last job, which is quite a mind-blowing adventure.

Add it to your TBR list now, and get ready for an epic journey in the cyberpunk world.\n\n🪐 Dune by Frank Herbert\n\nUp next on the list, we have another classic you shouldn’t miss out on – no wonder it’s one of the best-selling science fiction books of all time.\n\nSome might call it a stretch, but we’re here to drop the mic: for us, it feels like “Game of Thrones” was set in space. 🌌\n\nWelcome to “Dune,” where giant sandworms, political intrigue, and a mystical substance called spice rule the desert planet of Arrakis. Here, we get to follow the main character, Paul Atreides, as he navigates power struggles and epic battles, until he finally becomes known as Muad’Dib.\n\nWith a new movie out, there’s no better time to dive into this epic saga. Trust us, it’s out of this world!\n\n🪐 Ready Player One by Ernest Cline\n\nWonder what life will be like 20 years from now? 👀 Enter the world of “Ready Player One”, where reality in the year 2044 is a bit bleaker than we’d like it to be.\n\nThe book is set in a future where everyone escapes the ugly reality they live into the exciting virtual reality universe called the OASIS.

Or better yet, for “Ready Player One” on steroids? 💪\n\nWritten in the year 1992, “Snow Crash” is set in a future where the virtual and physical worlds collide in a totally bonkers way. No wonder it foresaw the metaverse and sparked inspiration in Silicon Valley pioneers for years to come.\n\nFollow Hiro Protagonist (yep, that’s his name) as he hacks his way through corporate-controlled enclaves and a virtual reality network. Immersed in the Metaverse, Hiro’s avatar is legendary, but trouble arises when hackers at The Black Sun club start succumbing to a strange drug called Snow Crash.\n\nTeaming up with fearless skateboard courier Y.T., who totally stole the show, Hiro delves into the origins of the drug, uncovering ancient Sumerian secrets and facing off against a virtual villain set on world domination.\n\n🪐 The Martian by Andy Weir\n\nEver wondered how you’d survive if you were stranded on Mars? 🚀\n\nSix days ago, Mark Watney was strolling on Mars like it was no big deal. Now? Well, let’s just say things got a whole lot more interesting.\n\nStranded, alone, and unable to contact Earth, Mark’s got some serious problem-solving to do. But with his smarts, skills, and stubborn refusal to give up, he’s determined to beat the odds. It’s hilarious, suspenseful, and scientifically accurate.\n\nIf you love stories of human ingenuity and survival against the odds, this one’s a total page-turner. Add this epic adventure to your TBR list and join the ride!\n\n🪐 The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nWinner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards, Ursula K. Le Guin’s “The Left Hand of Darkness” is a groundbreaking piece of science fiction that should definitely be on your TBR.\n\nExploring psychology, society, and human feelings in a world beyond our own, “The Left Hand of Darkness” is like the brainy superhero of sci-fi books.\n\nReady for it?

Isaac Asimov’s “Foundation” series is like the trailblazer of sci-fi, with its epic blend of action, mind-blowing ideas, and mind-bending, reality-warping world-building. 😋😋\n\nAsimov takes us on a wild ride through the best (and worst) of humanity, showing us how even a handful of brave souls can make a difference in a galaxy full of chaos. Using psychohistory, a mix of math and history to predict the future, a group of scientists tries to save humanity’s knowledge.\n\nIt’s epic, it’s smart, and it’s one of the pillars of sci-fi literature. Plus, there’s a new TV series, so now’s the perfect time to read it.\n\n🪐 The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin\n\nWhat would you do if you discovered we’re not alone in the universe? “The Three-Body Problem” by Liu Cixin dives into that question with a gripping story about first contact with an alien civilization.\n\nIt paints a vivid picture of a fictional timeline, spanning past, present, and future. Packed with real-world science and mind-bending concepts, this book is a stellar choice. ✨\n\nOh, and guess what? They even turned this mind-bending series into a Netflix show called 3 Body Problem, released earlier this year. So, if you’re into epic sci-fi adventures, you’ve got both the books and the binge-worthy series to dive into!
