May be posted electronically provided that it is transmitted unaltered, in its entirety, and without charge.\n\nWe examine both works of fiction and important contemporaneous works on non-fiction which set the context for ecological Science Fiction and Fantasy. Some questions that we study include:\n\nHow do living organisms grow and reproduce? (Tribbles, TV: Star Trek)\n\nWhat forces shape the evolution of species, including our own? Could humans evolve into something very different? (novel: Galapagos, by Kurt Vonnegut)\n\nWhat kind of planet is needed for living things and ecosystems to evolve? (novel: Red Mars, by Kim Stanley Robinson)\n\nWhat would a desert planet look like? (novel: Dune, by Frank Herbert)\n\nHow does genetics create us–and recreate living things? (novel: Jurassic Park, by Michael Crichton)\n\nCould genetics make us immortal? (novel: The Children Star, by Joan Slonczewski)\n\nWhat if an alien invader tried to do us in–from within? (novel: Andromeda Strain, by Michael Crichton)\n\nWhat if the aliens decide they like us–too well? (novel: Dawn, by Octavia Butler)\n\nBiology in Science Fiction: Syllabus by Prof. Joan Slonczewski. Prof. Joan Slonczewski describes her required reading list as follows (the hotlink shows the color art for each book):\n\nBarlowe’s Guide to Extraterrestrials, by Wayne Douglas Barlowe [New York: Workman Publishers, 1979] “In his classic guide, Wayne Douglas Barlowe’s brilliant portraits bring to life 50 aliens from science fiction literature: Larry Niven’s Thrint and his Puppeteer, Arthur C. Clarke’s Overlord, Frank Herbert’s Steersman, Robert Silverburg’s Sulidor and more. Humanoids, insectoids, reptillians-even protoplasmic, gaseous, and crystalline life forms-are all faithfully and naturalistically depicted so that you can now visualize what could only before be imagined.”\n\nThe Time Machine, by H.G. Wells [New York: Bantam Books, 1895] “When the Time Traveler courageously stepped out of his machine for the first time, he found himself in the year 802,700 — and everything had changed. In another, more utopian age, creatures seemed to dwell together in perfect harmony. The Time Traveler thought he could study these marvelous beings — unearth their secret and then return to his own time-until he discovered that his invention, his only avenue of escape, had been stolen.”\n\nGalapagos, by Kurt Vonnegut [New York: Dell Publishing, 1985] “Galapagos takes the reader back one million years, to A.D. 1986. A simple vacation cruise suddenly becomes an evolutionary journey. Thanks to an apocalypse, a small group of survivors stranded on the Galapagos islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave new, and totally different human race. Here, America’s master satirist looks at our world and shows us all that is sadly, madly awry-and all that is worth saving.”\n\nDune, by Frank Herbert [New York: Ace Books, 1965] “Set on the desert Planet Arrakis, a world more awesome than any other in literature, Dune begins the story of the man known as Muad’dib-and of a great family’s ambition to bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream…”\n\nThe Children Star, by Joan Slonczewski [Analog magazine serial; New York: Tor Books, 1999] “The Children Star — A world so alien that only children can be lifeshaped to live there. The Children Star features mind-bending genetic engineering, and tire-shaped creatures that evolved with triplex DNA and exotic amino acids. And which of the many circular- shaped life forms is actually an intelligent species with its own plans for the human colonists?”\n\nDawn, by Octavia Butler [New York: Warner Books, 1987] “Xenogenesis: The birth of something new-and foreign. Lilith Iyapo awoke from a centuries long sleep…and found herself aboard the vast living spaceship of the Oankali. Alien creatures covered in writhing tentacles, the Oankali had saved every surviving human from a dying, ruined Earth. They healed the planet, cured cancer, increased human strength and disease resistance, and were now ready to help Lilith lead her people back to the Earth. But for a price. For the Oankali were genetic engineers. DNA manipulators. Gene traders. They planned to give us their alienness. They planned to take our humanity. They planned to interbreed. And there was no way to stop them.”\n\nRed Mars, by Kim Stanley Robinson [New York: Bantam Books, 1993] “For eons, sandstorms have swept the barren, desolate landscape of the red planet. For centuries, Mars has beckoned to mankind to come and conquer its hostile climate. Now, in the year 2026, a group of one hundred colonists is about to fulfill that destiny. John Boone, Maya Toitovna, Frank Chalmers, and Arkady Bogdanov lead a mission whose ultimate goal is to give Mars an Earth-like atmosphere. They will place giant satellite mirrors in Martian orbit to reflect light to the planet’s surface. Black dust sprinkled on the polar caps will capture warmth and melt the ice. And massive tunnels, kilometers in depth, will be drilled into the Martian mantle to create stupendous vents of hot gases. Against this backdrop of epic upheaval, rivalries, loves, and friendships will form and fall to pieces — for there are those who will fight to the death to prevent Mars from ever being changed.”\n\nJurassic Park, by Michael Crichton [New York: Ballantine Books, 1990] “An astonishing technique for recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA has been discovered. Now, one of mankind’s most thrilling fantasies has come true. Creatures extinct for eons now roam Jurassic Park with their awesome presence and profound mystery and all the world can visit them-for a price. Until something goes wrong…”\n\nThe Andromeda Strain, by Michael Crichton [New York: Ballantine Books, 1969] “What if there was a virus so lethal, it could kill people as quickly as they took a breath? What if it spared some people from instant death…but drove them hopelessly insane instead? What if the swiftest acting, deadliest, virus ever known to humankind could be spread, by no more than a gust of wind, from the remote desert site of its first massacre to the busiest cities in America…and the world? What, if anything, could stop it?”\n\nThe Cartoon Guide to Genetics, by Larry Gonick and Mark Wheelis [New York: Harper Perennial, 1991] “Have you ever asked yourself: Are spliced genes the same as mended Levis? Watson and Crick? Aren’t they a team of British detectives? Plant sex? Can they do that? Is genetic mutation the name of one of those heavy metal bands? Asparagine? Which of the four food groups is that in? Then you need “The Cartoon Guide to Genetics” to explain the important concepts of classical and modern genetics.”\n\nBrain Plague, by Joan Slonczewski [New York: Tor Books, 2000] “What if alien microbes could give us whatever our brains imagined–at a price? ‘Brain Plague’ gives new epic meaning to hearing voices inside your head. Tune in or you’ll be sorry.” — Eva, Fantastica Daily\n\nJoan Slonczewski's Book List\n\nThe following list is selected, permuted, and edited from: Themes/Genres in Science Fiction: An idiosyncratic and woefully incomplete list, by Kay Fowler ©All the material in this website is copyrighted to Kathleen L.

Powers ©1994 Woodrow Wilson Biology Institute \"Integration of disciplines that involve science, social issues, and literature is an increasingly attractive alternative in curriculum development today.\" \"Science fiction has great appeal to many students who do not necessarily think of themselves as readers nor as the stereotypical 'math/science student.'\" \"The following is a resource list of science fiction short stories and novels that might be used either as an interdisciplinary teaching unit for teachers, an enrichment exercise in your biology course, or possibly a summer reading list for students entering your course the following year.\" \"It also can serve as a starting point for students to create their own science fiction stories if only selections from these novels or short stories are read. \"Students can demonstrate their understanding of complex biological concepts by writing their own short science fiction stories on topics such as 'The Day Diffusion Stopped.' What a difference a gene makes: food in the future, medicine in the future, eugenics revisited, and restoring extinct species are possible genetics ideas that could be developed.\" \"Readings are listed by title rather than author because titles seem more useful.

Omni, Amazing Stories, Fantasy in Science, and Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact are four that are recommended.\" This is by no means a comprehensive list of science fiction that could be used at the secondary level. Hopefully, teachers will use this as a springboard to generate their own annotated bibliographies that might also include favorite biological literature (books, poems, stories, and essays) and film resources that are not science fiction.\" \"A sample writing exercise that might be done after students have read 'The Andromeda Strain': Support the truth of these quotes as demonstrated by events in the book: \"The survival value of human intelligence has never been satisfactorily demonstrated.\" \"Increasing vision is increasingly expensive.\" In the acknowledgments Crichton states, \"We can expect more crises on the pattern of Andromeda.\" How much truth exists in the novel? What evidence do you see to support his prediction?

Reporter John Strasheim, Captain Wallich, bioanalyst Renata Baucum, and the rest of the small crew of the space ship Louis Pasteur travel on a dangerous mission from Jupiter's moon of Ganymede and the Immunity, visiting the Gladholders in the asteroid belt, to the inner solar system, including Earth, which has been taken over by the feared Mycosystem. From the back cover: \"Mycora: technogenic life. Fast-reproducing, fast-mutating, and endlessly voracious. In the year 2106, these microscopic machine/ creatures have escaped their creators to populate the inner solar system with a wild, deadly ecology all their own, pushing the tattered remnants of humanity out into the cold and dark of the outer planets. Even huddled beneath the ice of Jupiter's moons, protected by a defensive system known as the Immunity, survivors face the constant risk of mycospores finding their way to the warmth and brightness inside the habitats, resulting in a calamitous 'bloom'\" But the human race still has a trick or two up its sleeve: In a ship specially designed to penetrate the deadly Mycosystem, seven astronauts are about to embark on mankind's boldest venture yet -- the perilous journey home to infected Earth. Yet it is in these remote conditions, against a virtually omnipotent foe, that we discover how human nature plays the greatest role in humanity's future.\" Denver Science Fiction & Fantasy Book Club SCIENCE FICTION BOOK SELECTION\n\nMiscellaneous Biological novels/films:\n\nFantastic Voyage, film based on novel by Isaac Asimov, where an (impossibly) miniaturized submarine explores the interior of a living human body.\n\nThem, film: radiation makes ants grow (impossibly) large.\n\nThe Thing, film (and remake of film) from short novel “Who Goes There” by John Campbell; an alien creature terrifies antarctic expolors with its ability to change shape.
