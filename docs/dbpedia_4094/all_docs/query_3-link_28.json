        "text": "You may have heard the term “thematic statement” when it comes to novel writing.\n\nBut what does it actually mean?\n\nDo you really need one?\n\nTheme can be a pretty complex topic. There are many different interpretations. Sometimes terms are used interchangeably, and discussions around topic, theme, and thematic statements can be a bit mind-boggling.\n\nThe first challenge for authors is understanding what a thematic statement is in the first place.\n\nThe next is learning how to apply one to your novel to make it more powerful — because it definitely will.\n\nA strong thematic statement can lift your novel from being a cracking yarn to truly moving work of fiction.\n\nSo let’s look at thematic statements in detail. This post will help clear up some of the confusion, give you some specific examples, and show you exactly how you can use them to write amazing stories.\n\nWhat is a Thematic Statement\n\nA thematic statement is a simple yet powerful message an author is trying to convey in their work.\n\nFor example:\n\nLove is the glue that binds the Universe together\n\nThere is no such thing as true love\n\nMaternal love is the most powerful of all types of love\n\nA thematic statement says something specific about the nature of life or the human condition, which the novel argues is true.\n\nMastering your Thematic Statement can give your novel heart, a deeper meaning, and resonance.\n\nThematic Statement Versus Theme\n\nThe difference between a Thematic Statement and a theme is that while a Thematic Statement is specific and contains a value judgement or opinion, themes tend to be more general, and may be explored from various angles.\n\nSo while the examples listed above are Thematic Statements, they are all incarnations of the theme ‘love’.\n\nThematic Statement Versus Topic\n\nWhile these terms are sometimes confused, they are actually quite different.\n\nThe topic of a story is akin to the premise (also sometimes known as the elevator pitch).\n\nIt is a bite-sized overview of what your book is about.\n\nIt summarises the key plot, character and setting elements that are obvious on the surface, rather than hidden between the lines.\n\nExamples:\n\nHarry Potter\n\nThematic Statement: Love and friendship always triumph over evil\n\nThemes: Love, friendship, family, belonging, social inequality\n\nTopic (premise): A boy wizard joins a magical school and has to battle the greatest wizard who ever lived.\n\nThe Hunger Games\n\nThematic Statement: Survival is not enough without control over your own destiny\n\nThemes: Control, power, loyalty, social inequality, love\n\nTopic (premise): A girl is forced to take part in a televised fight to the death.\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale\n\nThematic Statement: Sexist attitudes have consequences\n\nThemes: Gender roles, power, rebellion, the place of an individual in society, the power of language\n\nTopic (premise): After fertility in the human race crashes, women’s rights are revoked and they are forced to live as no more than breeding vessels.\n\nWhy Use a Thematic Statement?\n\nIn Story, Robert McKee calls a thematic statement the “central” or “controlling story idea,” the idea that guides you in writing your entire novel. It shapes the strategic choices you make as you write.\n\nIf used skillfully, a thematic statement will make the story feel deeper, and touch readers on an emotional level. It may even change how they view the world and how they behave.\n\nOne of the main themes in the Godfather, for example, is that as power shifts, it changes people.\n\nThis thematic statement is illustrated first by how Don Corleone changes from a nearly omnipotent crime boss to a devoted grandfather, and later, how reluctant Michael resigns himself to his position and becomes more ruthless.\n\nWithout this consistent, underlying theme, the Godfather stories would not be nearly as powerful or as memorable.\n\nDo’s and Don’ts For Writing a Thematic Statement\n\nSome authors might start writing with a thematic statement already in mind, but that’s probably rare.\n\nIt’s more likely that you will have a more general idea of themes you might want to explore.\n\nBut most writers start with something more solid, like an idea for a character and the conflicts they will face.\n\nIt’s natural to write your first draft without putting too much thought into themes or the Thematic Statement.\n\nThen, when you read through your first draft, you’ll see concepts emerge, and at that point, you might want to decide what your Thematic Statement is – or what you would like it to be.\n\nThen you can refine it by following the dos and don’ts here:\n\nDo: Base it on Universal Themes\n\nStarting with themes that touch us all, such as love, loyalty and freedom, is likely to lead you to a thematic statement that resonates with your readers.\n\nIf your Thematic Statement applies to quite specific themes or groups of people, it may not resonate with so many people.\n\nFor example\n\nEating shellfish will lead to poor health\n\nThe fabulously wealthy are often misunderstood\n\nTaking away people’s guns is akin to taking away their freedom\n\nDon’t: Turn it Into a Moral Directive\n\nA Thematic Statement is an assertion, or observation – it is not advice. It should not be telling people how to behave.\n\nSo avoid things like:\n\nAlways tell the truth\n\nLive for today because tomorrow might never come\n\nYou should be kind to old people\n\nDo: Use Consequences to Illustrate Your Thematic Statement\n\nA skilled writer will never use a character as their mouthpiece, and have them outright state the thematic statement.\n\nBut through the choices the character faces, the decisions they make and the consequences they endure – the assertion of the thematic statement should be driven home.\n\nFor example, taking this Thematic Statement:\n\nSurvival is not enough without control over your own destiny\n\nKatniss repeatedly chooses the things that are important to her over her own safety and survival: from volunteering for a death match in order to protect her sister, to choosing to eat poison berries rather than murder her friend.\n\nDon’t: Refer to the Specifics of Your Story\n\nA Thematic Statement should be something that could be transplanted and applied to another novel.\n\nSo avoid things like:\n\nHarry learns the importance of friendship and loyalty\n\nA girl in a dystopian future chooses death over obedience\n\nKeep it universal.\n\nDo: Analyse Thematic Statements of Other Works\n\nOne of the best ways to learn anything is to study the greats. So take some of your favourite books or movies and try to work out what Thematic Statement the writer had in mind.\n\nSee if you can find evidence in the behaviour of the characters and the results of their actions, which support your analysis.\n\nHere’s a good guide to working out the Thematic Statement of a novel:\n\nPick the main topic addressed in the story\n\nPinpoint the author’s view on the topic\n\nFormat that perspective using a theme statement template\n\nDon’t: Use Trite Cliches\n\nThe best Thematic Statements are unique and interesting philosophical ideas.\n\nUsing cliches such as ‘crime never pays’ or ‘love conquers all’ as the guiding controlling story idea, will likely result in a story that is just as cliche.\n\nDo: Be Consistent\n\nOnce you have your Thematic Statement, make sure everything in your novel supports it.\n\nThis could include the behaviour of your main characters and sub characters, how the settings are conveyed, and the events that take place.\n\nFinal tip!\n\nA good way to tell whether you’ve got a Thematic Statement or something else, is to put ‘The Author believes’ in front of it.\n\nSo this is okay:\n\nThe author believes that love and friendship always triumph over evil\n\nBut these don’t make sense:\n\nThe author believes Harry learns the importance of friendship and loyalty\n\nThe author believes always tell the truth\n\nIt’s not foolproof, but it’s a handy rule of thumb.\n\n9 Thematic Statement Examples\n\nHere are some more examples of thematic statements:\n\nHumans are not fixed personalities but a set of constantly changing contradictions\n\nValuing wealth over family will lead to misery\n\nIsolation leads to madness\n\nNo matter people’s culture we are all the same at heart\n\nTrue love is built over time and shared experience\n\nThe family we choose can be more loyal than those we are born with\n\nLove taken to extremes can become dangerous\n\nHaving a true friend can help you survive the worst atrocities\n\nOnly by releasing judgement of others can we find inner peace\n\nMore examples of Thematic Statements can be found here.\n\nUse a Thematic Statement to Write a More Compelling Story\n\nIf you can get to grips with Thematic Statements and learn how to apply them effectively in your writing, then you have a very powerful tool for ensuring your stories resonate with readers and stay with them long after they’ve finished reading.\n\nBut at the end of the day, they are art, not mathematics, so if the statement that helps you write doesn’t exactly follow the rules above — don’t get too hung up on the details. If it works for you, then it works.\n\nAnd not all novels need to express a unique, thought provoking philosophy. When it comes to genre novels in particular, they may express Thematic Statements that are common and often repeated. They can still be perfectly effective novels that readers enjoy.\n\nSo take a look at your own stories and see if you can identify the Thematic Statement.\n\nAre there tweaks you can make to the story to make it even more consistent and powerful?\n\nOr if you don’t have a Thematic Statement, could working to one make your novel more compelling?\n\nAnd don’t forget to take a closer look at some of your favourite stories and try to work out what key message the author is trying to express.\n\nHappy writing!"
