        "text": "It was called a “suicide mission” and “the most disaster-plagued film in the history of Hollywood.”\n\nNow a whole new audience is about to be exposed to a forgotten classic that just may be the most dangerous movie ever made — thanks in part to its incredible back story.\n\nDirected and starring Noel Marshall (you might know him from “The Exorcist”), “Roar” is being re-released in theaters and on DVD, 34 years after flopping at the box office and derailing Marshall’s directorial career.\n\nAccording to a blog post by Drafthouse Films CEO and founder Tim League, the movie “follows wildlife preservationist Hank (Marshall), who lives harmoniously alongside a menagerie of untamed animals, including cheetahs, elephants, lions and tigers on a preservation in the African plains.\n\n“When his wife and children arrive for a visit, a long-brewing battle for dominance between two lions erupts and threatens their very lives.”\n\nBut what audiences didn’t see was the behind-the-scenes drama that cursed the movie and its producers for years to come.\n\nCast and crew were attacked and mauled by lions 70 times. Some of the worst injuries included upcoming European cinematographer Jan de Bont (“Speed”) having his scalp torn off and child star Melanie Griffith needing reconstructive surgery during filming.\n\nHow it all began: ‘A suicide mission’\n\nAfter shooting a film in Africa, American actress Tippi Hedren and her manager husband, Marshall, were inspired by the idea of a movie that highlighted the plight of big cats in captivity.\n\nLeague writes that the couple were struck by the scene of an abandoned house which was overrun by lions. That image took hold, and they “became devoted to raising awareness about the over-hunting of wild lions, tigers and jaguars.”\n\nBut their big idea was shot down by animal trainers, who dubbed it a “suicide mission,” “brainsick” and “completely and utterly insane.”\n\nIt would take 11 years to complete the film.\n\nSleeping with a pride of lions\n\nKnowing the cats would only work together if they had been raised together, Hedren and Marshall set up a lion breeding program in their Los Angeles mansion.\n\nFor six years, the couple, along with their young actor daughter Melanie Griffith and Marshall’s three sons, built a pride of cats that numbered more than 100 and went about their daily lives, eating, sleeping and living, with the pride of lions in their own home.\n\nAs the pride grew, a Beverly Hills mansion became too confining for the cats, and the family moved to a ranch about 40 miles north of Los Angeles.\n\n“What followed was five years of the most terrifying and dangerous filmmaking ever committed to celluloid,” said League.\n\nLions scalp, maul and almost kill crew\n\nSeventy attacks were documented during the production’s 11 years of filming.\n\nThe cast consisted mostly of Marshall, Hedren and the four children due to their relationship with the cats, but that didn’t stop the blood from spilling.\n\nCinematographer de Bont was scalped by a lion, resulting in 220 stitches to his head.\n\nGriffith was mauled and needed reconstructive surgery and 100 stitches.\n\nHedren suffered “deep scalp wounds” and a fractured leg, while Marshall was “gored” so often, he eventually contracted gangrene.\n\nIf that weren’t dangerous enough, a flood wiped out the entire set and a feline-related illness decimated their lion pride.\n\nProduction spirals out of control\n\nAfter two years of attacks and near-misses, financiers pulled out of the production, leaving Hedren and Marshall to foot the bill. Refusing to give up, the couple sold almost all of their assets to personally finance the rest of the production.\n\n“Refusing to yield to the intense adversity, de Bont, Hedren, Marshall and their family continued to heal wounds, rebuild sets, and hire crew after crew to wrap the production,” said League.\n\nDebut disaster at the box office\n\nAfter forking over an estimated $17 million in production costs, the movie grossed a disappointing $2 million when it debuted in theaters in 1981.\n\nBut, League says, “the passage of time affords us the perspective to view ‘Roar’ for what it truly is: the most epic and amazing animal thriller ever made.”\n\n“The cast is in constant mortal danger as dozens of adult lions ‘improvise’ around them.\n\n“At numerous times Marshall drips blood as he fends off ferocious advances from jaguars and tigers alike.\n\n“Melanie Griffith’s real-life mauling is on display in the final cut. A jaguar licking honey off Tippi Hedren’s face was an untested idea that could have easily ended very, very badly.\n\n“Knowing the back story of the production, you can see perpetual terror in the eyes of the cast as an army of lethal predators close in around them.”"
