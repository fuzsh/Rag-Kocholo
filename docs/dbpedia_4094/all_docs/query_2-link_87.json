When the 7 year old daughter of director Alba Garcia fell in love with the book, Alba felt she had to make a film.\n\nAlba has assembled an amazing cast and crew who are building sets, props and puppets based on the original illustrations by Valeria Docampo. Now we just need the funds to print the 3-D faces and hire animators."
