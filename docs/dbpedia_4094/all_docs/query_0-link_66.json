        "text": "Deryle Perryman and Dangerous Highway, a Film About Eddie Hinton\n\nby Penne J. Laubenthal\n\nDangerous Highway is an amazing documentary about the life and music of the incredibly talented and tragically fated Eddie Hinton, called the \"greatest unknown musician you have ever heard.\" The film was made by my long-time friend Deryle Perryman (pictured on the left) and the distinguished filmmaker Moises Gonzalez (on the right). I had the privilege of seeing the premiere of Dangerous Highway at the ninth annual George Lindsey Film Festival and Gala in Florence, Alabama. Following that event, the documentary went on to be shown in film festivals coast to coast.\n\nHere is what JPW, an Alabamian living in San Francisco, had to say in his blog Alabama Ass Whuppin’ about seeing Dangerous Highway at the Noise Pop Film and Music Festival: “A fantastic look into the life and times of not only Eddie Hinton, but the remarkable music scene that occurred in Northwest Alabama during the last half of the twentieth century. Interviews with Jimmy Johnson, David Hood (hell, about all the Swampers) Dick Cooper (a lot of time is spent with Dick , who sports a Muscle Shoals Sound t-shirt through-out the doc) and a ton of other historical figures from that time and region. The accents were very familiar and comforting and the stories were sometimes sad but often very funny. Not only are these men able to produce amazing music, they are first class story tellers as well.”\n\nThe screening of the film Dangerous Highway about soulman Eddie Hinton brought Deryle back to his hometown of Florence, Alabama. I talked with Deryle at his home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, about his experience in making the documentary.\n\nWhat prompted you to undertake a film about Eddie Hinton?\n\nSerendipidity, a love of music, especially Southern Soul and a chance, providential meeting with Mr. Robert Cray in an elevator on the 7th floor of the Redmont Hotel in Birmingham, Alabama, back in '05--June, I think. Mr. Cray had just closed a stage at CityFest."
