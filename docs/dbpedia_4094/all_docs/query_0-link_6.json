Projector, projection booth and rewind-room equipment, procedures, safety precautions and classic errors are examined to show that almost all fires are the result of carelessness, and almost all damage the result of incorrect attack. Impressive film of a 20-can fire concludes the illustration: the film ends with a summary.\n\nPhysical description\n\n35mm\n\nObject Details\n\nCategory\n\nFilm\n\nRelated period\n\n1945-1989 (content)\n\nCreator\n\nAdmiralty (Production sponsor)\n\nBritish Documentary Films (Production Company)\n\nHaines, Ronald (Production individual)\n\nNoble, Charles (Production individual)\n\nPhillips, Frank (Production cast)\n\nProduction date\n\n1948\n\nPlace made\n\nGB\n\nDimensions\n\nwhole: Number Of Items/reels/tapes 2\n\nCatalogue number\n\nCOI 222\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.
