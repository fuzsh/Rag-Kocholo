        "text": "The most dangerous motion picture in America is “The Interview,” which was abruptly pulled from a planned Christmas Day release by Sony Pictures Entertainment on Wednesday after hackers threatened to launch terrorist attacks on U.S. theaters.\n\nIt’s a crazy real-life story that feels like a Hollywood movie, and the latest example of life imitating art when it comes to the motion pictures.\n\n{mosads}There’s a long history of films leading to violence, regardless of the intentions of the fimmakers.\n\nHere’s a look at arguably the 10 most dangerous movies ever made.\n\nThe Birth of a Nation\n\nHistorically ranked as a top film in American history, “The Birth of a Nation” glorifies the creation of the Klu Klux Klan and depicts a white-supremacist view of the nation that drew the ire of the NAACP and other civil rights groups. President Wilson, a friend of the author of the book that inspired the movie, saw the movie during a White House screening.\n\nUsing the film to recruit new members, the KKK reached a peak of about 4.5 million members in 1920, just five years after the film’s release, according to PBS.\n\nTriumph of the Will\n\nThe 1935 Nazi propaganda film directed by Leni Riefenstahl glorified the Nazi regime and Adolf Hitler. Riefenstahl, a famous German director, repeatedly defended herself by portraying the movie as a documentary and asserting that she was unaware of the Nazi leader’s true plans. While widely regarded as a tremendously produced film, it played a crucial part as one of the most famous in a wave of German films that sought to instill devotion to a regime that ultimately murdered millions.\n\nA Clockwork Orange\n\nThe violent film released in 1971 portrays the violence and rape perpetrated by the main character’s gang and is often called one of the most controversial films in history. It originally received an X rating before edits brought that down to an R rating, and the National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures condemned the film.\n\nAfter an outbreak of rapes and murders linked to scenes in the film, director Stanley Kubrick decided to ban the movie from distribution in Britain. That ban remained until the director’s death.\n\nTaxi Driver\n\nMartin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver,” released in 1976, is considered a classic and captures New York City at its grittiest.\n\nRobert DeNiro’s “you talking to me?” monologue to a mirror might be its most memorable moment, though anyone who has seen it will also not forget its bloody finale.\n\nIt’s infamous because John Hinckley Jr. cited it as a reason for trying to assassinate President Reagan. After watching the movie upwards of 15 times, Hinckley became obsessed with Jodie Foster, who played a teenage prostitute in the film.\n\nThe fixation culminated in an assassination attempt on Reagan in an attempt to win her love.\n\nReagan survived, although the shooting left press secretary James Brady paralyzed. The medical examiner in said Brady’s 2014 death was due to injuries sustained from the shooting.\n\nLater, Hinckley, in a letter to The New York Times and called the act “the greatest love offering in the history of the world.” He was found not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nThe Last Temptation of Christ\n\nAnother Martin Scorsese film, from 1988, centers on the life of Jesus Christ but strays from the Biblical story. In the movie, Jesus eventually marries Mary Magdalene and has children, departures from the canon that stoked furor among Christian fundamentalist groups. The outrage culminated in the firebombing of a French church that injured 13 people.\n\nBoyz n the Hood:\n\nThis 1991 drama portrays life in inner-city Los Angeles and its director became the first African-American to be nominated for an Academy Award for best director.\n\nWhile the movie shows characters trying to buck a cycle of violence in the community, reaction to the movie provoked violence of its own. A Chicago Tribune story from the movie’s release said that 20 theaters showing the movie reported violence and that eight had to stop showing the movie.\n\nA few years later, Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing” was also criticized for possibly sparking violence. But noted film critic Roger Ebert wrote at the time that the disapproval of the movie was just a way to avoid embracing the hard truths it brought to light.\n\nNatural Born Killers\n\nThis extremely violent Oliver Stone film from 1994, based on a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, has been cited as an influence in a slew of murders. The movie follows a murderous couple whose exploits become dramatized and sensationalized by the media.\n\nAfter two students killed 13 people in the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado in 1999, investigators found multiple references to “Natural Born Killers” in one of their diaries. In 1995, a teenage couple from Oklahoma went on a killing spree after taking LSD and watching the movie on a loop.\n\nThe 1996 horror film “Scream” also allegedly inspired a number of murders, some that were carried out while the killer wore the infamous mask from the movie.\n\nZero Dark Thirty\n\nThe highly anticipated film from 2012 that detailed the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden faced its share of criticism. Its inclusion of graphic torture scenes was seen by some as implicit approval of those methods.\n\nLawmakers bashed the CIA and the Defense Department for releasing what they believed was classified information to the filmmakers. A Defense Department inspector general report published by the Project on Government Oversight said that then-CIA Director Leon Panetta mentioned secret military information at an award ceremony attended by a “Zero Dark Thirty” filmmaker.\n\nInnocence of Muslims\n\nNot a classic by any means, “Innocence of Muslims” is a crude 2012 YouTube video that proved a movie doesn’t have to be on the silver screen to provoke violence.\n\nThe 14-minute-long video denigrates the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. Actors later said that anti-Islamic lines were dubbed into the film without their knowledge.\n\nIt quickly sparked deadly protests throughout the Middle East and Europe, and at one time was blamed for the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans.\n\nThe movie became a flashpoint of disagreement between conservatives and liberals who battled over whether the government didn’t adequately respond to the attacks. A New York Times report a year after the attacks asserts that the video motivated an initial protest in Benghazi that terrorists took advantage of to launch an attack.\n\nThe Interview\n\nThe now-infamous movie stars Seth Rogen and James Franco portray journalists who go undercover for the CIA to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The film provoked stark outrage from North Korea, which has called its making an “act of war.”\n\nJust weeks before its release, Sony suffered a massive hack compromising tons of internal documents and also threatening theaters that screened the movie. The U.S. reportedly believes that North Korea sanctioned the cyberattack.\n\nThis isn’t the first American movie to show the death of a North Korean leader. “Team America: World Police,” a cartoon satire made by the creators of South Park killed off Kim Jong-il, but the North Korean government didn’t have as strong of a reaction.\n\nIn 2006, “Death of a President” detailed an alternate universe where President George W. Bush is assassinated and a Syrian man is wrongly convicted for the crime. At the time, the White House refused to respond to it, while former Secret Service agents worried it could inspire attacks on the president."
