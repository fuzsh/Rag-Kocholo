        "text": "After a shaky start on land, this maritime thriller unexpectedly turns into a passable showcase for its young Israeli-American star Odeya Rush, who we see transform from sullen teenager to crack-shot commando in a little over 90 minutes. Claustrophobic family drama, survivalist ordeal and balls-to-the-wall action barnstormer – any one of these would have amply filled out a single film. But director John Barr chucks all three into an unsubtle and faintly ludicrous outing that at least is never boring.\n\nRose (Rush) gets an invite on board a Bermuda-bound yacht, via her mother Alma (Saffron Burrows) who is being romanced by private security consultant Derek (Eric Dane). Grossed out by their middle-aged canoodling, Rose is nevertheless chuffed for her mother, who has raised her solo. But she begins to have suspicions about Alma’s suitor’s past when she finds a heavy-duty assault rifle below deck – suspicions that are confirmed when they are stormed by a skiff full of thugs hunting for a suitcase on behalf of “the Captain”.\n\nBarr sensibly avoids freighting Dangerous Waters with too much unnecessary characterisation; a cleanness of line that sees it in good stead as Rose puts her newly acquired nautical knowledge into practice to survive on her own. But when she makes landfall, the film makes several erratic and over-determined course changes – with Derek’s deception and selfishness flagged up increasingly cartoonishly.\n\nRose’s later transformation aboard a floating brothel into Nikita, the female assassin, isn’t much more plausible – though at least it’s amusing to find yourself suddenly in the midst of a gender-flipped Steven Seagal film. The aforementioned Captain turns out to be Ray Liotta, who in his final performance (he died during production) still has an offbeat intensity, like a deranged William Shatner. Barr keeps things motoring with a baleful zip that mostly rides out the bumps and general daftness."
