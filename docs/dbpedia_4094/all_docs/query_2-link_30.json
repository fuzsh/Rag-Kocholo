        "text": "Nite Line;4296502 said:\n\nI believe that elements from You Rock My World video were inspired by the cancelled Dangerous music video.\n\nDangerous (song) is one of Michael&#8217;s best songs and had massive hit potential. It&#8217;s a shame that its single release was cancelled due to the allegations.\n\nI believe that Dangerous should have come out as a single at the time of its performance at the AMA 93. That would have been a good enough promotion to perhaps propel it to #1 on the charts. Unfortunately, they waited too long to release Dangerous and in the end, it didn&#8217;t end up getting a release.\n\nYes, I agree with you on all points. This is what I have heard and read, with regard to the Dangerous song and proposed video/short film.\n\nJust for members who don't know: it was rumoured, at one time, that Pamela Anderson was being vetted by Michael to appear in his proposed \"Dangerous\" short film - Pamela has been rather coy about this rumour and would never strongly confirm or deny, when asked, but rather just put hints and innuendos out there. She and Michael supposedly met twice for a date/discussion in Malibu.\n\nDebate within the fandom has always raged, as to whether we think this could be Michael, or not.\n\nHere at 00:56, when asked if she is actually dating MJ, Pamela says.... \"he just wants me to be in his video.\n\n[video=youtube;u20m2y_nH_8]https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&v=u20m2y_nH_8&feature=emb_logo[/video]\n\nMikky Dee;4296506 said:\n\nShe and Michael supposedly met twice for a date/discussion in Malibu.\n\nDebate within the fandom has always raged, as to whether we think this could be Michael, or not.\n\nThese are hardly debatable issues.\n\nFirstly, this guy with the mask is not Michael Jackson.\n\nYou can also see that in this guy&#8217;s body and movements, which have nothing to do with Michael Jackson.\n\nSecondly, Michael Jackson and Pamela Anderson did not meet twice for a date or a discussion in Malibu.\n\nActually, they never met in Malibu, and this was a fake story that simply came from the British tabloid &#8216;Daily Mirror&#8217; newspaper.\n\nBesides, the newspaper claimed that the first meeting took place at the Shutters Hotel on Malibu Beach, which does not make sense.\n\n&#8220;According to the Daily Mirror, Jackson and Anderson have been meeting at the Shutters Hotel on Malibu Beach, arriving separately so as not to raise suspicions&#8221; (Daily Mirror)\n\nShutters Hotel is actually located on Santa Monica Beach, not on Malibu Beach.\n\nWasn't it revealed later who that guy with the white mask actually was?\n\nI can't remember nor find anything about it online anymore, but it wasn't Michael.\n\nThe masked guy had turned up on more than one occasion... it was some kind of promotion stunt for something.\n\nApparently rumours that it is Michael Jackson were deliberately spread on scene.\n\n&#8220;Westwood&#8217;s personal assistant was overheard by a Reuters witness telling two members of the audience that Anderson&#8217;s mysterious plus-one was the reclusive King of Pop.&#8221; https://lacienegasmiled.wordpress.com/category/2008-pamela-anderson/\n\nI wish Dangerous had been a single with a proper short film. But I doubt that there was anything planned besides a Dangerous tour clip montage or so. Wasn't the single sheduled for late 1993? Michael was still busy on tour back then, so when would he have had the time to shoot a full video like You Rock My World.\n\nDavid Lynch also made several artsy short clips and short movies. The Dangerous teaser was likely just that.\n\nCould be, of course. But Dangerous is so \"visual\", it has so much potential to be made into a short film, I always had this feeling it was even created with this intention in mind. It's just my assumption though, which is reinforced (but not verified of course) by two more facts: the existence of the choreography and how heavily the song is influenced by Old Hollywood movies, to the point of borrowing some lines from The Bandwagon (starring Fred Astaire). Sure, that can be said about the Smooth Criminal video already, but still.\n\nEdited to clarify: I didn't mean to imply there was an MV in the making (sorry if my previous post was misleading), just the strong possibility of intending to make one.\n\nYes, I agree with you on all points. This is what I have heard and read, with regard to the Dangerous song and proposed video/short film.\n\nJust for members who don't know: it was rumoured, at one time, that Pamela Anderson was being vetted by Michael to appear in his proposed \"Dangerous\" short film - Pamela has been rather coy about this rumour and would never strongly confirm or deny, when asked, but rather just put hints and innuendos out there. She and Michael supposedly met twice for a date/discussion in Malibu.\n\nI remember hearing something about Julia Roberts potentially being in the video. Don't know how much truth there is to that. Would've been interesting to see what could have been had the single and video gone forward.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm a huge Lynch fan, but I see some Lynchy inspirations, for example...\n\nThe Pepsi \"Dreams\" commercial has a bit of a Twin Peaks feel.\n\nThe Dangerous demo (at the end from 5:50)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/57Em6_eoTac?t=350\n\n...includes the melody / harmonie from one of the reoccurring themes in the Twin Peaks score.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woUt7wPe8Ow\n\n(The one that's also sampled in Moby's \"Go\")\n\nMichael's Kirara Basso commercial always reminded me of Lynch's \"Dune\" movie.\n\nI wish they had done more together...\n\nI agree with this.\n\nTo be honest as good and as iconic is the Dangerous live performance with it's fedora/Gangster theme, I actually always thought that theme didn't ever suit the song.\n\nI too envisaged the theme and visuals of this song to be more along the lines of the Dangerous Teaser by David Lych. A music video part real/part animated, like the teaser, definitely along the lines of that Japanese desert commercial and the Pepsi dreams commercial. TBH I used to think the japanese commercial footage was unreleased footage of the Dangerous video dubbed over with Black Or White audio. MJs look in that video - all black, straight hair seems to suit the song more to me. When they made that commercial who knows what he was actually dancing to? I doubt it was BOW, unless behind the scenes footage exists online. I'd like to imagine it was Dangerous he was dancing to. (remember during the panther segment of BOW MJ is actually dancing to Dangerous audio, not BOW).\n\nI mean, when you see this it's basically the first 30secs of the Dangerous audio, so when the eyes come right at you I can totally hear the beat starting and MJ in the desert or something."
