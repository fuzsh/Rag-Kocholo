        "text": "If one was to be trapped on Ship-Trap Island, the chances of he or she making it out of the island alive are slim to none. Whether you are reading the story or watching the movie this fact reigns true in both. The Most Dangerous Game is a short story that was written in 1924 by Richard Connell. The story was later adapted into a movie with the same title in 1932. Both versions of the story use the same character names for the main characters and also have a very similar plot however one can see that there is many differences between the film adaptation and the short story.\n\nThe short story is about a famous big game hunter named Rainsford who while on his way to another hunt falls of his yacht very close to an island fabled by sailors for decades. …show more content…\n\nThe differences however are what jump out at you the most. For starters in the short story Rainsford falls off his yacht and that is how he makes his way onto Ship-Trap island. In the film adaptation Rainsford’s yacht crashes and that is how he ends up on Ship-Trap island. Another difference comes when Rainsford reaches Zaroffs chateau and meets two other people who were involved in an accident as well and they too ended up on Ship-Trap island. In the novel Rainsford is the sole survivor on the island and must survive the game. Another key difference between the story and film is the duration of the game; in the film the duration is just one night while in the story Rainsford must survive three days in the purgatory created by General Zaroff. The final difference is how Zaroff dies, in the film Eve and Rainsford make their way through the swamp and into Zaroff’s bedroom where he ultimately kills Zaroff. In the story however the plan to kill Zaroff is much more convoluted and Rainsford has to jump off a cliff into the water and swim to the Chateau and then just as in the film, Rainsford kills Zaroff. All in all there are many similarities as well as differences in ‘The Most Dangerous Game’. The story in a way makes the game seem as a terrible situation which all though it is a horrible situation in both cases, in the film adaptation you see the most dangerous game as being something that can be won. In the story as a reader you feel as though Rainsford is playing a game in which he cannot win. The setting, characters, and plot differed tremendously however this is what ultimately led to two very different and interesting versions of a great"
