        "text": "Benoit Blanc will return next year, with filmmaker Rian Johnson revealing the name of his next mystery film, Wake Up Dead Man.\n\nThe announcement was accompanied by a short animated teaser featuring narration from Daniel Craig as Blanc, recounting his past adventures in Knives Out and Glass Onion and setting the stage for his next big case. “In the beginning, the knives came out,” Craig drawls. “Then behold — the glass was shattered. But my most dangerous case yet is about to be revealed.”\n\nBeyond the title, the only other info Johnson shared about the movie was that they were “about to go into production.” No other casting or plot details were revealed, and it’s unclear exactly when in 2025 Wake Up Dead Man will be released.\n\nBut Johnson did seem to hint that the new movie might be slightly different from its predecessors, writing on Twitter: “I love everything about whodunnits, but one of the things I love most is how malleable the genre is. There’s a whole tonal spectrum from Carr to Christie, and getting to explore that range is one of the most exciting things about making Benoit Blanc movies.”\n\nTrending\n\nHe added that the title of the new movie, Wake Up Dead Man, “gives a little hint of where it’s going.”"
