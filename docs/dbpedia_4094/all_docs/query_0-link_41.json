        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n25 May 2024, 07:37\n\nCredit: Netflix\n\nNetflix has confirmed Bond star Daniel Craig will be back as eccentric sleuth Benoit Blanc in their third Knives Out movie.\n\nThe streaming giant unveiled the new Knives Out adventure will be titled Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, with Rian Johnson back in the directing seat.\n\nWake Up Dead Man will land on Netflix in 2025, three years after his last turn as private investigator Blanc, having last appeared alongside Edward Norton and Kate Hudson in Glass Onion in 2022.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nRebus fans are all saying the same thing after ‘absolutely brilliant’ BBC reboot\n\n‘We could have kept on going’ - Stephen Merchant explains why he and Ricky Gervais stopped making The Office\n\nCall the Midwife Series 14: Will Helen George return? When will it air? Casting news and more\n\n------------------------------------\n\nFans first met Blanc during the critically acclaimed whodunnit Knives Out in 2019, in which he was hired to investigate the death of best-selling author Harlan Thrombey, played by the late Christopher Plummer in one of his final film appearances. Glass Onion followed the curious crime fighter to a private Greek Island after being invited by a tech billionaire (Norton) to solve a murder mystery game gone wrong.\n\nThe mysterious Wake Up Dead Man teaser dropped on Netflix's social media accounts yesterday (24th May) and included the sultry tones of Blanc’s famous Southern drawl.\n\n“In the beginning, the knives came out,” a tense Blanc explains. “Then behold, the glass was shattered. But my most dangerous case yet is about to be revealed.”\n\nDirector Johnson, who was at the helm of the previous two Knives Out movies, shared his excitement on X, writing: “I love everything about whodunnits, but one of the things I love most is how malleable the genre is.\n\n“There’s a whole tonal spectrum from Carr to Christie, and getting to explore that range is one of the most exciting things about making Benoit Blanc movies.”\n\nJohnson then confirmed Craig and the currently unconfirmed cast are “about to go into production” and fans should use their own detective skills on the movie’s title as it “gives a little hint of where it’s going.”\n\nWhile it’s yet to be confirmed who Blanc will suspect of the next outrageous crime, director Johnson recently confirmed he’d considered making the third Knives Out movie into a Muppets movie after it was suggested by fans.\n\n\"It's a joke that I thought was pretty brilliant, and I ended up really giving [it] some serious thought,\" Johnson said back in 2023.\n\n\"As much as I take the murder mystery genre seriously, I take the genre of a Muppet movie seriously... I think those two things have very different rules.\n\n\"You can either have a Benoit Blanc mystery that has Muppets in it, but they'll feel out of place. Or you can have a Muppet movie that Benoit Blanc is in, but it'll feel like a Muppet movie.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want to compromise either of them,\" Johnson explained."
