        "text": "\"This island has a long history of accommodating dubious characters...\" Madman Films debuted the first official trailer for We Were Dangerous, an indie coming-of-age from New Zealand marking the feature directorial debut of filmmaker Josephine Stewart-Te Whiu. This recently premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival & BFI Flare, and it's screening next at the Sydney, Melbourne and Perth Film Festivals in Australia. No US release date yet, but it's set to open in NZ in August to start. Nellie, Daisy & Lou attend an institution for delinquent girls on an isolated island in 1954. The trio rail against the system, finding strength in their friendship but this is challenged when the school's matron divides them. We Were Dangerous is a powerful story of female friendship, by director Josephine Stewart-Te Whiu, winner of the SXSW Special Jury Award for Filmmaking. Starring Erana James, Rima Te Wiata, Nathalie Morris, and Manaia Hall. The film has plenty of positive reviews, stating that it's a \"heartwarming tale of friendship and rebellion that skillfully balances the humor and joy of youth.\" Well this looks fantastic! Keep an eye out for this film later this year.\n\nHere's the first international trailer for Josephine Stewart-Te Whiu's We Were Dangerous, on YouTube:"
