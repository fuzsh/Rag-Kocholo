        "text": "All the Dangerous Things, by Charleston-based New York Times bestselling author Stacy Willingham, is a fictional thriller and Willingham’s second published novel. It was released nationally Jan. 10, although Palmetto Brewing Company and Buxton Books in Charleston had a book launch party Sunday.\n\n“[A] lyrical thriller… this involving, thought-provoking page-turner raises disturbing questions about the nature of the stories people tell themselves to make sense of the world. Willingham remains an author to watch,” said Publishers Weekly, an international book review website.\n\nWillingham garnered acclaim with her debut mystery novel, A Flicker in the Dark, that was released last year.\n\nAnticipation surrounded the latest book release with media outlets including Buzzfeed and PopSugar placing it on their respective “Most Anticipated” and “Best of 2023” lists.\n\nThe novel is about Isabelle Drake, a woman whose life is forever altered when her toddler son is kidnapped from his room in the middle of the night.\n\nUnable to sleep, Drake obsesses over finding evidence or a witness to help her locate her missing son.\n\nShe agrees to an interview with a true crime podcaster in the hopes she’ll discover new information. But, amidst the podcaster’s unceasing questioning, Drake brings up uncomfortable memories from her past, causing her to question her memories of the night her son disappeared and second-guessing who she can trust — including herself.\n\nEarly positive reviews for All the Dangerous Things\n\nWillingham’s second novel has received positive early reviews so far.\n\nEntertainment news publication Vulture said that fans of Willingham’s first novel, or of suspenseful reads in general, would enjoy All the Dangerous Things.\n\n“Stellar suspense at its very best. More than a crime story (though it’s certainly that), the book is also contemplation of motherhood, sisterhood, womanhood. Rather than falling victim to the dreaded sophomore slump, the author takes the best elements of her debut (complex characters, atmospheric setting, faulty memory, toxic secrets) and amplifies them to dizzying effect. All the pieces are there, yet every time you think you’ve put them together, she rearranges them into something more salient and shocking,” said Vulture.\n\n“Simply put: If you liked A Flicker in the Dark, you’ll love All the Dangerous Things. It may only be the first month of 2023, but this one will rightfully find itself on many a year-end, best-of list.”\n\nAll the Dangerous Things is available for purchase online or at your local bookstore.\n\nRelated\n\nHelp keep the City Paper free.\n\nNo paywalls.\n\nNo subscription cost.\n\nFree delivery at 800 locations.\n\nHelp support independent journalism by donating today."
