        "text": "It takes an appealing cast and gives them unappealing characters, leaving them with the unenviable task of moving the audience to actually care about what we’re seeing. Sadly, we never do.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/5 | Aug 16, 2022\n\n… Surpasses its B-movie classification and delivers entertaining action that strikes the right chord at the right time. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6/10 | May 23, 2022\n\nThere isn't an awful lot about David Hackl's Dangerous that feels remotely original, least of all its stale, generic title that can't help but feel tragically ironic when the finish product is one that plays things entirely safe\n\nFull Review | Jan 5, 2022\n\nIt is worth the price of admission just to see how much Scott Eastwood is like his old man.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6/10 | Nov 24, 2021\n\nDangerous is a perfect storm of bad writing, bad acting, and bad directing. And it's a total celebration of violence.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Nov 9, 2021\n\nThere's clearly a limited budget here, where little depth is given outside the main character, and still Dangerous makes for a thrilling enough escape of entertainment.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Nov 9, 2021\n\nEven though it's formulaic, it is hard to get a handle on the plot. It is ridiculous, but also takes itself serious. Good idea in theory, if not practice.\n\nFull Review | Nov 6, 2021\n\nDangerous is an action movie with a unique premise, but its poor writing, stiff acting, and lack of charm make the 2021 movie borderline unwatchable.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Nov 6, 2021\n\nSave for that one confounding scene with Janssen, for the rest of the movie Gibson is alone, taking periodic phone calls from D and handing out absolutely horrible, uninformed, dangerous and irresponsible advice...\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/4 | Nov 6, 2021\n\nIt takes some chutzpah to name your siege thriller Dangerous, and unfortunately, there's not enough of it in the Scott Eastwood actioner of that name.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/4 | Nov 5, 2021\n\n[D]irector David Hackl is unaware of the obvious comedy in this material or is simply incapable of communicating a joke...\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/4 | Nov 5, 2021\n\nA shambles of a movie, with a plot so contrived yet abstract that you spend each scene asking yourself how it's all supposed to add up.\n\nFull Review | Nov 4, 2021\n\nIt's strange to say in 2021 that Mel Gibson is the only good part of a movie, but such is the case with Dangerous\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Nov 3, 2021"
