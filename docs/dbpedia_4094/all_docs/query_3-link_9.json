Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nThe Dressmaker is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nSummary\n\nSet in Dungatar, a barren wasteland of traditionalism and superstition, isolated amidst the rapidly modernising post-World War II Australia, acclaimed author Rosalie Hamâs gothic novel, The Dressmaker, provides a fascinating window into 1950s Australia. I find it to be one of the most intriguing texts of our time - managing to weave together a historical narrative with humour, wit, and modern-day social concerns regarding patriarchy, class, and the effects of isolation.\n\nThe Dressmaker is one of those texts which reinforces why studying English can be so great when you give it a proper chance. This subject isnât just about studying books and writing essays, itâs also about learning new insight youâll carry with you throughout your life. Specifically, The Dressmaker offers real insight into some of the most pressing issues that have been around for centuries - how communities respond to crisis, why certain groups are marginalised, and how we should respond to tyranny and intolerance. Hamâs novel is layered with meaning, character development, and a moving plot which really helps us reflect on who we are as people. Not every book can do that - and, seemingly, on a surface level, you wouldnât expect a novel about fashion and betrayal to do it either. But somehow, it just does, and itâs what makes The Dressmaker one of my favourite books of all time.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nBefore we move on to looking at The Dressmakerâs plot and delving deep into analysis, itâs really important to understand the main historical context which underpins the novel. By âhistorical contextâ, all we mean here is the factual background which tells us why Rosalie Ham wrote her novel, and why she chose the particular setting of Dungatar. After all, Dungatar is a fictionalised community, but its references to post-World War II Australia are very real. The main message I want you to take from this section is that understanding 1950s Australia is essential to understanding Dungatar.\n\nAustralian Geography and the Great Depression\n\nBefore we delve into talking about this historical theme, Iâd like to first acknowledge that Australia was colonised against the wishes of its First Nations peoples, and also recognise that sovereignty was never ceded. This discussion broadly reflects the experiences of colonised Australia because that is the frame which Rosalie Ham provides. However, at Lisaâs Study Guides, we acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which this study guide was written, edited, and published, and pay our respects to elders past, present, and emerging.Â\n\nHamâs fictional setting of Dungatar is a perfect example, as it is placed in the Australian Outback. The âOutbackâ doesnât exactly have any borders, so which regions of Australia count as part of the 'outback' will be slightly different from person to person. A general rule to help us understand the Outback is that it is way out in the centre of the country, far away from urban Australia. Its main industry is pastoralism, which refers to the grazing of cattle, sheep, and other species such as goats. This is a tough lifestyle, and as such small towns and a lot of room for livestock is preferable. These communities are often isolated, and donât really communicate with the outside world unless itâs about trading their livestock into the cities. Isolation tends to create its own culture, practices, and social standards. For Dungatar, we see massive economic divides and strict expectations around the role of men and women. For instance, the McSwineys live in absolute poverty, yet Councilman Evan and his family are relatively wealthy. Most of the women in the town either care for children or stay at home, reflecting the outdated idea that it is the role of the man to work, and the role of the woman to be a homemaker. As much as we can look at these ideas and realise how flawed they are, for Dungatar it is a way of life to which theyâve stuck for decades. Changing this way of life would be dangerous for them because it means they have to completely reconsider the way they live.\n\nPart 1: Plot\n\nMyrtle Dunnage arrives in Dungatar after many years, seeking to care for her mother Molly Dunnage.Â\n\nMyrtle, who now wishes to be known as Tilly, reconnects with Sergeant Farrat, Dungatarâs eccentric local policeman who is doing his evening lap in the town. He takes Tilly through the town and up âThe Hillâ, which is where Molly lives.Â\n\nWhile Tilly is caring for Molly, mental and physical illness causes her to believe that Tilly is an outsider who wishes to poison her. Tilly perseveres in order to shower, feed, and clothe the woman, as well as clear out the house.\n\nThe perspective changes to Sergeant Farrat, who is patrolling the town centre a day later. He sees a returned William Beaumont sitting in a car. Moving into Muriel and Alvin Prattâs General Store, Farrat claims to be buying fabric for his house. Their daughter Gertrude, who is reading a fashion magazine, realises that the material he is buying fits with the latest skirt designs across Australia.\n\nAfter learning about Mr Almanacâs pharmacy, the footballers move into Purl and Fred Bundleâs pub.Â\n\nThe readers are introduced to the McSwiney family, who with Edward and Mae as the father and mother, have 11 children. Theyâre said to live in the tip at the edge of town.Â\n\nThe following weekend Tilly and Molly leave The Hill to attend the football match played in Dungatar between the two neighbouring towns, Itheca and Winyerp. Lois Pickett and Beula Harridene give her an immediately negative reaction, taking offence when Molly questions whether their cakes are poisoned.\n\nAfter getting medicine from Mr. Almanac and his assistant Nancy, Tilly and Molly run into Irma, his sickly wife. Her arthritis makes mobility difficult, and as such she is found sitting on the bank of the river, where she asks Tilly not to let the town know that she had been cooking meals for Molly in Tillyâs absence.\n\nNancy and Sister Ruth Dimm are shown to be having a secret relationship in the back of the phone exchange building before the perspective moves back to Buela Harridene, who demands that Sergeant Farrat investigate the McSwiney children for supposedly pelting her roof with stones.\n\nTilly sits on the riverbank, remembering her memories and trauma in Dungatar, with the crucial event being when Stewart Pettyman attempted to headbutt Tilly, but she moved out of the way, causing him to ram into a wall, snap his neck and die.\n\nMarigold and Evan Pettyman are introduced to the audience, with Marigold being a nervous individual who is put to sleep by Evan with pills every night and sexually assaulted.\n\nFollowing Dungatarâs victory in the grand finale, which sends frivolity and celebration throughout the town, a package arrives for Tilly. Ruth reads through all its contents after picking its lock whilst Tilly reluctantly meets with Teddy, who continues to visit her.Â\n\nTilly and Molly visit the Almanacs for dinner, wherein Tillyâs medicine causes Irmaâs pain to disappear. Although Mr Almanac is unpleasant â stating that Tilly can never be forgiven for Pettymanâs death â the night moves on, Tilly returns home and is visited by Teddy yet again.Â\n\nPart 1: Quotes and Analysisâ\n\nâShe used to have a lot of falls, which left her with a black eye or a cut lip.â\n\nHere, Ham subtly hints that Irma Almanacâs injuries were not solely due to âfallsâ, as it is also said that once her husband grew old the âfallsâ progressively ceased. Abuse of women is common in Dungatar, and it is almost expected that women will be subservient to men and do as they demand.\n\nâHis new unchecked gingham skirt hung starched and pressed on the wardrobe doorknob behind him.â\n\nSergeant Farrat subverts social expectations placed upon 1950s men by adoring feminine fashion. However, the fact that he is forced to hide his passion reveals how, in conservative towns such as Dungatar, individuals are forced to suppress their true selves in order to fit in with the broader population. There is no room for individuality or creative expression, as this is seen as a challenge to Dungatarâs social order and the clear separation between the roles of men and women.\n\nâWhatâs the point of having a law enforcer if he enforces the law according to himself, not the legal law?â\n\nBuela Harridene pretends to care about the enforcement of the law, but her true concern is bending the law to her own will to make those who step outside of their socially defined roles suffer. She is at odds with Sergeant Farrat as he seeks to control the townspeopleâs worst instincts, yet people like Buela ensure that vengeance, rumour, and suspicion are still the defining features of Dungatar.\n\nâWell let me tell you if heâs got any queer ideas weâll all suffer.â\n\nAlthough this specifically refers to William Beaumont, it alludes to the broader picture that the people of Dungatar believe that any outside ideas fundamentally threaten everything about the way they live. Even before Beaumont has opened his mouth, he is already a threat since he may have witnessed another way of living disconnected from Dungatarâs conservatism.\n\nIf you'd like to see the all Chapter plots, their analysis, along with important quotes, then have a look at our The Dressmaker Study Guide.\n\nThemes, Motifs, and Key Ideas\n\nIsolation and Modernisation\n\nOne of the central conflicts in The Dressmaker is between the isolated town of Dungatar, and the rapidly modernising surroundings of post-depression 1950s Australia, as we established in Historical Context. Ham uses this dichotomy (meaning when two opposing factors are placed right next to each other) to question whether isolated communities like Dungatar really have a role in the modern world.Â\n\nOur clearest indication that Dungatar is not only traditionalistic, but absolutely reviles change and outside influence, is right at the start of the novel, when a train conductor laments that thereâs ânaught thatâs poetic about damn [progress].â Here, we see the overriding contention of Rosalie Hamâs novel - that because a community like Dungatar has been isolated for so long, it has become absolutely committed to maintaining its traditionalism at all costs. There are more symbolic reflections of how stagnant the town has become, such as the fact that Evan Pettyman, the townâs elected Councillor, has been in the role for multiple decades without fail - or that the same teacher who ostracised Tilly as a child, Prudence Dimm, is still in charge of the townâs school.Â\n\nSocial Class\n\nThe Dressmaker speaks extensively about social class. By class, what I mean is the economic and social divisions which determine where people sit in society. For instance, we could say that the British Royals are âupper classâ, whilst people living paycheque to paycheque and struggling to get by are âlower classâ.Â\n\nIt's also important to introduce the notion of a classist society. A classist society is one where all social relations are built on these aforementioned economic and social divides - in other words, everything you do in life, and everything you are able to do, is built on where you sit in the class structure.Â\n\nFor The Dressmaker, the question then becomes - \"how does class relate to Dungatar?\" Well, Dungatar is one of the most classist societies around, where societal worth is explicitly based on oneâs position in the class structure.\n\nFemininity, Fashion, and Patriarchy\n\nBy now, youâve probably realised that The Dressmakerâs title is significant. Fashion and âdressmakingâ are absolutely essential to understanding the life of Tilly Dunnage, and how she interacts with the people of Dungatar. Weâll go into this further, but Ham specifically delves into the power of fashion as a form of expression which empowers people and their femininity, yet she also examines how, in a community like Dungatar, fashion nonetheless ends up being entirely destructive.Â\n\nDungatar and Femininity\n\nThe idea of femininity describes, on a basic level, the ability of a woman to express herself independent of any man. Others would describe femininity in more definitive terms, but itâs really in the eyes of the beholder. Whatâs explicitly clear, however, isÂ that, in order to suppress femininity, women in Dungatar are repressed and kept under the control of men. Marigold Pettyman is raped by her husband, Evan Pettyman every night, while the âladies of Dungatarâ¦turn their backsâ when they see the Councillor coming - knowing his crimes, but being too afraid to challenge him. Above all else, Dungatar exists within a patriarchal framework, which is one where men hold structural power and authority, and that power relies on keeping women silent and subservient. In such a society, the role of women in Dungatar is vacuous (meaning that they donât have any real purpose) - they frill about, spread rumours, and otherwise have no set roles other than to be obedient to their husband.Â\n\nFashion as Empowerment\n\nWithin this context, Rosalie Ham explores the power of fashion to empower femininity, and, even if itâs in a limited sense, give the patriarchy its first real challenge. Gertrude is a perfect example, as Tillyâs dressmaking sees her eventually transform at her wedding, even though she is initially described as a âgood muleâ by Sergeant Farrat; symbolically being stripped of her humanity and beauty by being compared to an animal. However, Gertrude becomes the spectacle of the town at her wedding, wearing a âfine silk taffeta gownâ and presenting an elegant, empowered image. The townspeople even note that Tilly is an âabsolute wizard with fabric and scissorsâ, and, with the use of the word âwizardâ, it becomes evident that the women of Dungatar are absolutely unaccustomed to having any form of expression or individuality - a patriarchal standard which Tilly challenges through her work.Â\n\nThink also about Sergeant Farrat. Even if he isnât a woman, he nonetheless is able to embrace his feminine side through fashion. Indeed his âgingham skirtâ and secretive love of female fashion is utilised by Ham to demonstrate that, even in a patriarchal settlement like Dungatar, fashion is immensely empowering and important.\n\nFashion and Destruction\n\nHowever, as always, Ham elucidates that there too exists a dark side to fashion in a town like Dungatar. Ultimately, the women of Dungatar, in their elegant dresses, end up looking like a âgroup of European aristocratsâ wives who had somehow lost their wayâ. What this quote tells us is that, despite a temporary possibility for empowerment, the women of Dungatar did not fundamentally change their identities. As âaristocratsâ wivesâ, they are still tied to a patriarchal system in which, even if they were better dressed, nothing was ultimately done to overcome their tradition for rumour, suspicion, and ostracising outcasts. Indeed, this becomes most evident at the Social Ball, where, despite wearing Tillyâs dresses, her name is âscrubb[ed] outâ from the seating list - symbolically expressing a desire for Tillyâs modernising, urban, outside influence to be removed from Dungatar, even as they simultaneously wear her dresses!Â\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nTilly DunnageÂ\n\nTilly, or Myrtle Dunnage, is the protagonist of The Dressmaker, and an acclaimed dressmaker trained in Paris. Analysing Tilly requires an understanding that she believes she is cursed: starting with being exiled from Dungatar after the accidental death of Stewart Pettyman, and then finding her âseven month oldâ baby Pablo âin his cot...deadâ, as well as witnessing the deaths of Teddy and Molly. In her own words, she is âfalser than vows made in wineâ, and does not personally believe she can be trusted. This pessimistic perspective on life inspires Tilly to adopt an incredibly individualistic understanding of the world; believing that the only way for her to survive is embracing her individual worth and rejecting toxic communities. Indeed, although Tilly initially arrived in Dungatar to care for her mother - a selfless act - the town spiralling into vengeance only confirmed Tillyâs pessimism. Her modern dressmaking ultimately could not change a fundamentally corrupt community predicated on ânothing ever really chang[ing]â, and therefore the maintenance of a culture of rumour and suspicion. Indeed, in âraz[ing Dungatar] to the groundâ, Rosalie Ham reminds us that Tilly is an unapologetically individually-focused person, and will not tolerate anyone, or anything, which seeks to make her conform to the status quo and repress her individuality.\n\nMolly DunnageÂ\n\nMolly Dunnage is Tillyâs mother, a bedridden, elderly woman whose sickness drives Tilly back into Dungatar. Molly is commonly known as âMad Mollyâ by the townspeople, but what this hides is the fact that Molly was not born mentally insane. Rather, after being âtormentedâ by Evan Pettyman into having his illegitimate child and seeing Tilly exiled from Dungatar, the malicious actions of the community drive her into insanity. Even in her incapacitated and crazed state, Molly holds such love for Tilly that she attempts to stop her engaging with the community, and thus the symbolism of Molly âdismant[ling] her sewing machine entirelyâ was that, due to her experiences, she did not believe that the people of Dungatar would ever accept Tilly, either as a dressmaker or a person. Mollyâs death is ultimately a pivotal event, and awakens Tilly to the fact that only ârevenge [could be] our causeâ, and thus that Dungatar is fundamentally irredeemable.\n\nTeddy McSwineyÂ\n\nTeddy McSwiney is the eldest son of the McSwiney family, Dungatarâs poorest residents. Teddy is a unique case, as although heâs a McSwiney, he is noted for being incredibly well-liked in the town - even going so far as to be described by Purl as the townâs âpriceless full forwardâ in Dungatarâs AFL team. Nonetheless, as we discussed under the Social Class theme, Dungatar remains an unashamedly classist society, and as such, despite Teddy being valued in his usefulness as a footy player and the ânice girls lov[ing] himâ, he âwas a McSwineyâ - discounted from the townâs dating scene or any true level of social worth. Teddy becomes essential to the plot when he and Tilly spark a budding romance. Whereas the majority of Dungatar rejects Tilly or refuses to stand against the crowd, Teddy actively seeks to remind Tilly of her worth - saying that he âdoesnât believe in cursesâ. However, his death after suffocating in a âsorghum millâ reiterates a sad reality in Dungatar; it is always the most vulnerable townspeople who pay the price for classist discrimination, ostracisation, and suspicion.Â\n\nSergeant FarratÂ\n\nSergeant Farrat is one of The Dressmakerâs most interesting characters. On the surface, heâs nothing but a police officer who manages Dungatar. However, Farratâs position is far more complex than meets the eye - as a police officer, he is entrusted with enforcing the âlegal lawâ, yet must also contain the influence of malicious individuals such as Buela Harradine who would otherwise use the enforcement of that law to spread slander about individuals like the McSwineys, who she considers âbludgersâ and âthievesâ. Despite Dungatarâs complications, Farrat considers the townspeople âhis flockâ, and this religious, Christ-like imagery here tells us how he is essentially their protector. Farrat is, in essence, entrusted with preventing the townspeople from destroying themselves (by now, we all know how easily the townspeople slide into hatred and division!). Hereâs the interesting thing though - at the same time Sergeant Farrat is protecting Dungatar, he is also personally repressed by its conservative standards. Rosalie Ham establishes Farrat as a man with a love for vibrant, expressive, female fashion, and from his âgingham skirtsâ which he sews in private to his time spent with Tilly while she sews, Ham demonstrates to us that Dungatarâs conservatism affects everyone. Even though he tries to defend Tilly as the townspeople descend on her after Teddyâs death, Tilly destroys his house along with Dungatar anyway - signalling that, no matter how hard Sergeant Farrat tried to reconcile his position as protector of Dungatar and his own person, the town could not be saved.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nStructure\n\nThe Dressmaker is written in the Gothic style, which means it combines romance with death and horror, particularly horror of the emotional kind. The Dressmaker is divided into four sections, each named after a type of fabric Tilly uses in her work. You can use these in your essays to show how important dressmaking and fashion is to the plotâs progression, especially considering each section starts with fabric. The four types are:\n\n1. Gingham\n\nA fabric made from cotton or yarn, with a checkered shape. Gingham is often used as a âtest fabricâ in designing fashion or for making tablecloths. This gives it a rustic, imperfect feel signifying Tillyâs return to her hometown and complicated past. The name is thought to originate from a Malay word meaning âseparateâ, mirroring Tillyâs feelings of isolation from the rest of Dungatar. In this section of the novel, Sergeant Farrat also buys gingham fabric to secretly make into a skirt, symbolising how the town is still rife with secrets and a disparity between the public and private personas of its inhabitants.Â\n\n2. Shantung\n\nA fabric used for bridal gowns. Gertrude is married in this section and her dress, which Tilly makes, is the first instance where the town witnesses her work. Shantung originates from China, matching this notion of exoticism and foreignness which seeing the dress spreads among the townspeople.Â\n\n3. Felt\n\nA fabric noted for its ability to be used for a wide variety of purposes. This is the section in which the ball occurs and a variety of Tillyâs dresses are unveiled for the town to see.Â\n\n4. Brocade\n\nA richly decorative fabric made with threads of gold and silver. Brocade is used primarily for upholstery, drapery, and costumes. This is a reference to the costumes of Dungatarâs play, the climax of the novel which occurs in this section.\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1. âThey looked like a group of European aristocratsâ wives who had somehow lost their way.â Fashion is both liberating and oppressive.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nTheme-Based Prompt: Rosalie Hamâs The Dressmaker condemns fundamentally oppressive communities. Discuss.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nWeâve got a theme-based prompt here, which really calls for your essay to be explicitly focused on the theme at hand. That means that we shouldnât stray from the idea of âoppressive communitiesâ. Keep it as the centre of your essay and look at how events relate to this idea - weâll break it down more in Step 2 so you can properly explore it.\n\nBecause thereâs a âDiscussâ qualifier added to the end of the prompt, a clear and concise contention is really important. What youâre being asked to do is, again, stick with the topic frame. That means that going for the usual âtwo agree, one disagreeâ structure is decent, but I wouldnât suggest it as the most efficient way to go. Instead, what youâll see that I do with this essay is âdiscussâ how the topic is present throughout all three of our arguments.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nLetâs start by breaking down the key words of the topic.\n\nWe have the idea of an âoppressive communityâ, which refers to communities that are built on marginalising certain individuals so the majority can maintain power. This is quite a clear reference to Dungatar, but expect that most essay questions for The Dressmaker wonât directly reference Tilly or the town, even if theyâre quite clearly talking about them. Something for which you should look out â donât let the wording phase you!\n\nThe addition of the word âfundamentallyâ doesnât change that much, but what it does tell us is that the essay is asking us to agree that Dungatar is oppressive to its core. In other words, its âfundamentalsâ are based on oppression. I would not recommend trying to disagree with this basic premise, as it means youâre going against the topic in a âDiscussâ prompt which, as we discussed above, isnât the best option in my view.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nOne of the most logical ways to approach this topic is a chronological structure. By that, what I mean is following the text in the order events occur; before Tillyâs arrival, during Tillyâs time in Dungatar, and the consequences that arise after they make her an outcast once again.\n\nThis way, you can stay on topic and look at how Dungatar is oppressive even before Tilly shows up again, how that ramps up as she establishes her dressmaking business, and what Hamâs final message is on rejecting oppressive communities and embracing individual worth.\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our The Dressmaker Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nThemes\n\nAnalysing Techniques in Visual Texts\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe Complete Maus is a graphic novel that depicts the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Polish Jewish Holocaust survivor who experienced living in the ghettos and concentration camps during the Nazi regime. Vladekâs son, Art has transformed his story into a comic book through his interviews and encounters which interweaves with Artâs own struggles as the son of a Holocaust survivor, as well as the complex and difficult relationship with his father.\n\n2. ThemesÂ\n\nSurvivalÂ\n\nSurvival is a key theme that is explored during Vladekâs experience in concentration camps and his post-Holocaust life.Â\n\nFor example, Vladek reflects that âYou have to struggle for lifeâ and a means of survival was through learning to be resourceful at the concentration camps.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nResourcefulness is depicted through the physical items Vladek keeps or acquires, as well as through Vladekâs skills. For example, Vladek explains to Art that he was able to exploit his work constantly through undertaking the roles of a translator and a shoemaker in order to access extra food and clothing by being specially treated by the Polish Kapo.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHe even wins over Anjaâs Kapo to ensure that she would be treated well by not being forced to carry heavy objects. Vladekâs constant recounts and reflections symbolise survival, as Vladek was willing and able to use his skill set to navigate through the campâs work system.\n\nDuring the concentration camps, food and clothes also became a currency due to its scarcity and Vladek was insistent on being frugal and resourceful, which meant that he was able to buy Anjaâs release from the Birkenau camp.\n\nâGuilt\n\nAlthough survival is a key theme, the graphic novel explores how Holocaust survivors in The Complete Maus grapple with their deep psychological scars.Â\n\nMany of those who survived the war suffered from depression and was burdened with âsurvivorâs guiltâ. This can be seen through the character of Artâs mother, Anja, as 20 years after surviving the death camps, she commits suicide. After having lost so many of her friends, and families, she struggled to find a reason as to why she survived but others didnât. Throughout the graphic novel, her depression is apparent. In a close-up shot, Anja appears harrowed and says that âI just donât want to liveâ, lying on a striped sofa to convey a feeling of hopelessness as if she was in prison. Her ears are additionally drawn as drooped, with her hands positioned as if she was in prison in the context is that she must go to a sanatorium for her depression.\n\nIt is not only Anjaâs guilt that is depicted, but also Art himself who feels partly responsible. Art feels that people think it is his fault as he says that âThey think itâs MY fault!â and in one panel, Art is depicted behind bars and that â[He] has committed the perfect crimeâ to illustrate that he feels a sense of guilt in that he never really was the perfect son. He believes he is partly responsible for her death, due to him neglecting their relationship. Spiegelman also gives insight to readers of a memory of his mother where she asks if he still loves her, he responds with a dismissive âsureâ which is a painful reminder of this disregard.Â\n\nIntergenerational Gap\n\nArt constantly ponders how he is supposed to âmake any sense out of Auschwitzâ if he âcanât even make any sense out of [his] relationship with [his] fatherâ. As a child of Jewish refugees, Art has not had the same first-hand horrific experiences as his parents and in many instances struggles to relate to Vladekâs stubborn and resourceful tendencies. Art reflects on this whilst talking to Mala about when he would not finish everything his mother served, he would âargue til I ran to my room cryingâ. This emphasises how he didnât understand wastage or frugality even from a very young age, unlike Vladek.\n\nSpiegelman also conveys to readers his sense of frustration with Vladek where he feels like he is being treated like a child, not as an adult. For example, Art is shocked that Vladek would throw out one of Artâs coats and instead buy a new coat, despite Vladekâs hoarding because he is reluctant and feels shameful to let his son wear his âold shabby coatâ. This act could be conveyed to readers that Vladek is trying to give Art a life he never had and is reluctant to let his son wear clothes that are âinappropriateâ in his eyes. However, from Artâs perspective, he âjust canât believe itâ and does not comprehend his behaviour.\n\nSince we're talking about themes, we've broken down a theme-based essay prompt (one of five types of essay prompts) for you in this video:\n\n3. Analysing Techniques in Visual Texts\n\nThe Complete Maus is a graphic novel that may seem daunting to analyse compared to a traditional novel. However, with countless panels throughout the book, you have the freedom to interpret certain visuals so long as you give reasoning and justification, guiding the teacher or examiner on what you think these visuals mean. Here are some suggested tips:\n\nFocus on the Depiction of Characters\n\nSpiegelman may have purposely drawn the eyes of the Jewish mice as visible in contrast to the unapparent eyes of the Nazis to humanise and dehumanise characters. By allowing readers to see the eyes of Jewish mice, readers can see the expressions and feelings of the character such as anger and determination. Effectively, we can see them as human characters through their eyes. The Nazisâ eyes, on the other hand, are shaded by their helmets to signify how their humanity has been corrupted by the role they fulfill in the Holocaust.\n\nâ\n\nWhen the readers see their eyes, they appear sinister, with little slits of light. By analysing the depictions and expressions of characters, readers can deduce how these characters are intended to be seen.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nââ\n\nâ\n\nââ\n\nLook at the Background in Each Panel\n\nThroughout the graphic novel, symbols of the Holocaust appear consistently in the background. In one panel, Artâs parents, Anja and Vladek have nowhere to go, a large Swastika looms over them to represent that their lives were dominated by the Holocaust.\n\nEven in Artâs life, a panel depicts him as working on his desk with dead bodies surrounding him and piling up to convey to the reader that the Holocaust still haunts him to this day, and feels a sense of guilt at achieving fame and success at their expense.\n\nThus, the constant representation of symbols from the Holocaust in Spiegelmanâs life and his parentsâ past in the panelsâ background highlights how inescapable the Holocaust is emotionally and psychologically.Â\n\nSize of Panels\n\nSome of the panels in the graphic novel are of different sizes which Spiegelman may have intended to emphasise the significance of certain turning points, crises or feelings. For example, on page 34, there is a disproportionate panel of Vladek and Anja passing a town, seeing the first signs of the Nazi regime compared to the following panels. All the mice seem curious and concerned, peering at the Nazi flag behind them. This panel is significant as it marks the beginning of a tragic regime that would dominate for the rest of their lives.\n\nYou should also pay close attention to how some panels have a tendency to overlap with each other which could suggest a link between events, words or feelings.\n\nAlthough not specifically targeted at Text Response, 10 Things to Look for in Cartoons is definitely worth a read for any student studying a graphic novel!\n\nWeâve explored themes, literary devices and characters and development amongst other things over on our After Darkness by Christine Piper blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down an After Darkness essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nLetâs get into it!\n\nThe Prompt:Â\n\nâWhile Ibaraki clearly suffers the consequences of his actions, it is those closest to him who pay the highest price. Discuss.â\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThis is a theme-based prompt, and the keywords are: suffer, consequence, actions and highest price. You want to explore both the evidence that supports the statement and also any evidence that may offer a contradiction to the statement.\n\nFrom here you can find the definition of the keywords to help develop some questions to explore.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nTo suffer is to be affected by or subject to something unpleasant.Â\n\nIs Ibaraki the only one who suffers? Who else suffers?\n\nKayoko, Johnny, Stan, Sister Bernice.\n\nHow do characters deal with their suffering differently?\n\nKayoko and Sister Bernice abandon their relationships with Ibaraki, Johnny becomes agitated and spiteful, Stan becomes depressed.Â\n\nA consequence is a result of an action.Â\n\nAre the consequences negative or positive?\n\nJohnny being outspoken in the internment camp angers the traditionalist Japanese, but creates a sense of kinship amongst the half-blood Japanese.Â\n\nCan characters overcome these consequences or learn from them?\n\nIbaraki eventually learns from his mistakes and grows as a result.Â\n\nAn action is the process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim.Â\n\nIs it Ibarakiâs actions, or lack thereof that lead to consequences?\n\nIt is often his silence and obedience that cause trouble. For example, not telling Kayoko about his work leads to the failure of their marriage.Â\n\nIs it only Ibaraki who makes mistakes?\n\nSister Bernice ignores her religion to confess her love for Ibaraki.Â\n\nWhat are the factors that cause the characters to act in the way that they do?\n\nIbarakiâs guilt and fear of authority and judgement prevent him from speaking up on multiple occasions.Â\n\nHighest price refers to Ibarakiâs suffering being above all else.Â\n\nIs this true?\n\nIbaraki loses his dignity, his friends, his wife, his unborn child, his family, his job and his freedom. However, he does partially regain these.Â\n\nWho suffers the most?\n\nKayoko has a miscarriage and her marriage to Ibaraki fails. Stan is assaulted by other internees and is eventually killed by a guard. Johnny becomes an outcast in his community and is bullied by other internees.Â\n\nAt this point, you can begin to group your ideas and evidence from the text to support your claims.\n\nThroughout the novel, Piper uses a variety of literary devices including dialogue, simile and foreshadowing to convey her message of every action having a consequence. The most prominent of these is her use of imagery and metaphor which she uses to illustrate Ibarakiâs guilt and the way it impacts his actions. However, the story is not only centred around Ibaraki. Piper also highlights that people will often face consequences no matter what decision they make. She does this through her use of foil characters (characters who are used to highlight a particular trait in another character). For example, Ibarakiâs fear and obedience are emphasised by the courage of Kayoko and Johnny Chang. These characters, alongside Ibaraki, face suffering as a result of their actions.Â\n\nFrom these ideas, the main themes I am going to explore are what factors affect the characterâs actions, and how the consequences of these actions can lead to negative, but also positive change.Â\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nParagraph 1:\n\nWhilst the novel centres around Ibarakiâs actions and their consequences, he is not the only character that makes mistakes and is forced to face the repercussions.\n\nParagraph 2:\n\nIt is not necessarily Ibarakiâs actions, but lack of action that often results in the suffering of those around him. Consider the reasons for his lack of action: his blind devotion to authority, his fear of judgement, his ongoing guilt and regret from previous situations.\n\nIbarakiâs lack of action acts as a perpetuating factor for the suffering of those closest to him, but it is not the only factor.\n\nParagraph 3:\n\nIbaraki may pay the highest price for his actions. The structure of the storyline to include a chapter from Ibarakiâs perspective years later indicates that these consequences have ultimately led to positive change.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nNow it is time to write the essay!\n\nSet during the Pacific War, Christine Piperâs After Darkness explores the difficulties and misfortunes many face during wartime. Depicting the rise and fall of Japanâs war efforts (1), After Darkness highlights that all actions have consequences of varying severity, particularly those of protagonist Dr Ibaraki Tomokazu. Throughout the novel, Ibarakiâs lack of action perpetuates the suffering of those closest to him, however, this is shown to be one of many factors and often initiates positive change within him, allowing his character to develop. Fundamentally, After Darkness highlights that change can only occur if people face the repercussions of their actions. (2)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(1) In the introduction, it is important to introduce the text withcontext. As After Darkness is predominantly set in 1942 during wartime in both Japan and Australia, it is important to include this in the introduction in order to explore the essay topic with a complete understanding.Â\n\n(2) Another key part of the introduction is to briefly introduce the topics you will discuss throughout the essay.\n\nThroughout the novel, Piper emphasises the idea that all actions have consequences, however, this idea is not limited to Ibaraki. Across the three novel strands, protagonist Dr Tomokazu Ibarakiâs suffering as a result of his mistakes is depicted through both his internal and external dialogue. Ibaraki makes many significant mistakes throughout his lifetime, one of these being his failure to perform a dissection of a child when working at Unit 731. Despite ânot [being] [him]selfâ (3) when asked to perform the operation, Ibaraki is promptly fired. His termination of employment is not the only consequence of his failure, as shame continues to take over his confidence. This is illustrated when he was âunable to go onâ during an operation in Broome, despite being in a completely different scenario. Through Ibarakiâs flashback of âBlack dots on a childâs bellyâ, Piper indicates the torment and lasting effects of consequences on an individual (4). Whilst the novel centres around his mistakes, it is revealed that Ibaraki is not the only character who is forced to face the repercussions of their actions. Despite acting as foils for Ibaraki and presenting many different qualities, Australian internees Johnny Chang and Stan Suzuki also struggle immensely to overcome the results of their behaviours. Johnny Changâs outspoken nature is often shown to cause disruption among the camp, for example, labelling the imperialist Japanese as âemperor worshipping pigâs.â In standing for his beliefs, Johnny creates a tense division within groups, leading to the half Australian internees being treated like âoutcastsâ. Conversely, Stanâs introverted behaviour results in his eventual death (5). Piperâs contention that all actions have consequences is arguably enforced strongly through Stanâs death, as it results from the failure of many characters to act. Ibarakiâs inability to open up, Johnnyâs selfishness and Stanâs loss of self are inevitably all factors leading to his eventual demise. This is ultimately reinforced when Johnny states âIt shouldâve been me Docâ, indicating he has finally realised his role in the tragedy.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(3) In order to embed quotes, words, prefixes and suffixes can be added to ensure the sentence flows correctly. However, you must indicate that you have edited the quote by placing your changes in square brackets. Here, the original quote was ânot myselfâ but it has been changed to fit the sentence.Â\n\n(4) Whilst it is important to include quotes, it is even more important that you analyse how the author uses the quote to convey a message. In this case, the example of one of Ibarakiâs many flashbacks is used to bear Piperâs belief that one cannot escape the repercussions of their actions.\n\n(5) Comparison is a powerful way of exploring the authorâs ideas throughout the text. Here, Johnnyâs outspoken nature is contrasted with Stanâs âintroverted behaviourâ, yet both concede repercussions. This supports the idea that all actions have consequences, no matter their nature.\n\nIbarakiâs lack of action acts as a perpetuating factor for the suffering of those closest to him, however, it is not the only factor. After Darkness shows the faults in many of Ibarakiâs actions, suggesting his mistakes lead to the misfortunes of many of those around him but this is only partially true. Stan Suzukiâs death is a pivotal moment in the novel where Ibaraki begins to truly express his emotions and open up about the pain he feels (6). Ibaraki realises that he âcould have done somethingâ when opening up to the investigators of Stanâs death, leading to the conclusion that Ibaraki is to blame. Piper illustrates that suffering results as a combination of factors through the later revelations of Johnnyâs escape attempt and the instability of the âtrigger-happyâ guard who shot Stan. This idea is reinforced through the breakdowns of Ibarakiâs close relationships with Kayoko and Sister Bernice. Whilst Ibarakiâs emotionally distant nature catalysed the loss of these significant relationships, it was not the only factor. Both Kayoko and Sister Bernice are structured with similar characteristics in the novel, one being their confidence and strength in their beliefs. Nevertheless, both women lack this characteristic when it comes to their relationship with Ibaraki (7). Ibaraki admits his separation from Kayoko is his âgreatest regretâ, and whilst the first-person perspective does not give an insight into Kayokoâs side, she is shown to lack her usual self-assuredness. Similarly, Ibarakiâs allowance of âsilence [to] stretch betweenâ¦â him and Sister Bernice is hurtful and a failure on his behalf, yet she still willingly confesses her feelings, aware of the risks involved. This is evident when âher eyes dart away from [his]â, implying she is ashamed of her statement as it contradicts her religion and the terms of their work relationship and friendship. This results in an abrupt end to their friendship as the embarrassment of the repercussions of her actions overwhelm Sister Bernice. Whilst the series of mistakes that Ibaraki makes throughout the novel show that his actions cause grief for both him and the people around him, they also highlight that the misfortune of others is not always the fault of one individual.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(6) Referring to specific events in the text is extremely useful to support your ideas and claims. However, it is important that you avoid over-explaining the event, as this will lead to you retelling, rather than analysing the text. See How To Avoid Retelling the Story for more tips.Â\n\n(7) An often-overlooked literary device is the use of foils. A foil is a character that is used to highlight a particular trait in another character, often a flaw. In this case, Piper uses the similarities between Kayoko and Sister Bernice, and the ultimate failure of their relationships. This highlights Ibarakiâs repetition of his mistakes, which we can attribute to his ongoing guilt.Â\n\nIbaraki ultimately pays the highest price for his actions; although this is shown to result in positive change. Through her descriptions of Australia and Japan, Piper uses the juxtaposition of light and dark imagery to illustrate how suffering can lead to learning and growth. Facing racism in Broome when labelled as a âBloody Japâ¦â, trauma from his experiences in Unit 731 and hardship during his internment at Loveday, Ibaraki is constantly a victim of circumstance. Even so, the pressures and torment of these events force him to seek the support of others. The colourful descriptions of the âpink spur of land crested with greenâ foreshadow the positive change to come for Ibaraki (8). This becomes evident when Ibaraki finally opens up to Stan in the infirmary about his separation from Kayoko. Ibarakiâs development as a character continues as he learns to trust despite the unfair circumstances of being interned. Although memories of trees haunting the riverâs edge âlike lost peopleâ and the bark of red trees appearing âlike blistered skinâ continue to plague Ibarakiâs conscience, they force him to confront his past and in turn begin to heal. Through the retrospective novel, Piper describes Japan as where âdarkness crowded the cornersâ and Ibaraki worked âin the basementâ, indicating his misguided obedience and attachment to silence. This not only illustrates (9) Ibarakiâs trauma, but emphasises his drastic development through his experiences. The importance of the consequences Ibaraki has faced throughout his lifetime are reinforced in the final pages of the novel after he reads Sister Berniceâs letter and has an epiphany. The discovery that he had âclung to the ideal of discretionâ creates a sense of hope for Ibarakiâs future and emphasises his newfound understanding of life through the consequences he has faced. (10)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(8) Ensure you donât just randomly place quotes throughout the essay, but instead, analyse them to give them meaning. An easy way to do this is by including the quote, its connotations and what emotions or ideas they provoke, followed by why the author has used it. In this case, the quote was the âpink spur of land crested with green.â Its connotations were positive such as colour, happiness, and hope. These connotations were used to foreshadow positive change.Â\n\n(9) Using a variety of vocabulary such as âillustratesâ, âexploresâ and âdemonstratesâ shows that you are not only identifying what the author is doing but that you understand how and why they have done it in this way. This is ultimately the goal of a text response essay.Â\n\n(10) It is important to ensure the flow of your essay to show sophistication in your writing. It is not only the ideas you have, but the way in which you convey and explain them that ultimately indicates your understanding of the text. A simple way to do this is to use a summary sentence at the end of each topic that subscribes to the idea and links to the previous or following paragraph.Â\n\nEssentially After Darkness highlights the necessity of facing consequences for our actions to promote learning and growth. Whilst Ibaraki and many other characters suffered as a result of their behaviour, Piper asserts that Ibaraki is not the overall perpetrator but ultimately pays the highest price of all. (11)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(11) Just like the introduction, the conclusion is a brief summary of the discussion topics throughout your text response. Most importantly, after exploring all of the evidence you must form a stance in relation to the essay topic. Many students believe that this needs to be a simple and definite yes or no, which is not the case. Instead, I have suggested that Ibaraki is not the only one to blame for other characterâs suffering, but that ultimately, he paid the highest price.

Students tend to have strong feelings about it, some love the melodic rhythm and the eloquent way in which it encapsulates life and others hate it, either because they find it a snooze-fest and would rather read the dictionary, or they simply donât know how to approach analysing it. Whatever boat you may be in, by the end of your study of Peter Skrzyneckiâs New/Old World poems, youâre bound to have a new appreciation for the art that is poetry and find analysing poems less of a daunting prospect and more a something easy to nail.\n\nBefore we begin diving into Skrzynecki, Iâd highly recommend that you check our LSGâs Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response. Itâs jam-packed with awesome, FREE advice for how to ACE Text Response.\n\nAnalysing Poetry in Old/New World\n\nUnlike other forms of text, a collection of poems is not one continuous body of writing, instead a poetry collection is more like a series of vignettes, snapshots into poignant moments, in this case, of an authorâs life. Whilst many students may struggle with this form and ask âHow many poems do I analyse? Do I need to know all of them?â, poems are easier than most texts to prioritise and categorise into themes and often have a significant amount of metalanguage. And in answer to your questions, whilst its best you analyse the whole collection to some extent, knowing 10 or so strategically chosen poems really well, covering all themes and types should hold you in good stead for any question thrown at you in the exam.\n\nContext\n\nPeter Skrzynecki wrote his poems over a significant amount of time, starting in 1970 and ending in 2006. This has given the collection a unique perspective, not only demonstrating a migrantâs journey through narrative, but also by providing the different attitudes and feelings of belonging, experienced by one individual as they try to assimilate in their new world over a period of time. This gives us, as students, a wonderful opportunity to look deeper into the text and identify Skrzyneckiâs differing positions in regard to identity, family and belonging, through the perspective from which he writes his poems at different stages of his life.\n\nTo learn more about the importance of context in VCE English, check out this blog post.\n\nThe Structure\n\nSkrzyneckiâs collection tends to feature three types of poem, by identifying these, analysing each piece can be made easier as similar types of poem often focus on similar themes. The three categories of poetry to look for are:\n\nNature Poems\n\nPeter Skrzynecki showcases his connection to Australia through poems that depict often idyllic landscapes, or the lives of common fauna of Australia, such as birds and fish.\n\nThe Immigrant Experience\n\nThese poems such as Immigrants at Central Station, Migrant Hostel and The Polish Immigrant offer an insight into the emotionally turbulent and difficult journey migrants go through to live in Australia. These poems also demonstrate the experiences of relief and joy felt when arriving, as well as emotions of fear, trepidation and disconnect in regards to both their new home and their old world.\n\nFamily Poems\n\nOften the most emotionally pulling, these poems tug at the heartstrings and showcase the relationships between Peter Skrzynecki and his family, as well as his exploration of his heritage, his ties to his Polish background.\n\nThe new/old world structure, similar to the old and new testament of the bible are used to highlight the old world of Skrzyneckiâs Polish roots and childhood, whilst the new world is his new life in Australia.\n\nRecurring Characters in Old/New World\n\nPeter Skrzynecki\n\nThe author of this text, as well as a character in his own right, Peter describes his triumphs and struggles of immigrating to Australia in his poems.\n\nFeliks Skrzynecki\n\nThe Polish adopted father of Peter, a âgentle manâ who immigrated to Australia with him family from Germany often demonstrates the struggle of the older generation to fully âbelongâ, as they have grown up amongst different customs. This difference in the two generationsâ assimilation is depicted in the poem Feliks Skrzynecki, as we see Feliks as attached to his Polish customs and traditions, as he âreminisce[s]â with his Polish friends. We also discover that he struggles with the English language, is a hard worker and has had cancer twice in his foot. Peter in comparison is seen to have far more of a disconnect with his Polish ancestry he âinherited unknowinglyâ and forget his âfirst Polish wordâ as he learns of a culture âfurther South of Hadrianâs Wallâ.\n\nThemes in Old/New World\n\nAs we all know, themes are an integral part of Text Response overall, and that still rings true for Skrzyneckiâs poetry. To learn more about how to implement themes into different types of Text Response prompts, check out our blog on LSGâs Five Types of Text Response Prompts!\n\nBelonging\n\nOne of the most central themes of Skrzyneckiâs poems is that of belonging. As the poems detail an immigrantâs emotional journey, alternating between feeling that they belong and donât belong, we are invited to grapple with what it means to belong both mentally and physically as well as what elements are required to feel a sense of belonging in community and country.\n\nIdentity\n\nIdentity is another central theme, one that runs closely to that of belonging, as a main part of oneâs identity is the culture/place/family to which they feel they belong. Old/New World: New and Selected Poems explores the formation and changes in a migrantâs sense of identity as they try to find belonging in their new Australian home as well as later, when they try to reconnect with their European heritage. To explore the theme of identity itâs best to break it down into several influential factors, which are listed below:\n\nPlace\n\nThe surroundings in which a person finds themselves, as well as the place they call home is an essential part of identity, as it showcases what place one identifies with and feels safe in. Â Several of the poems are set in places of transition, such as at a train station, this helps to emphasize the displacement some migrants may feel as they struggle to acclimatise to their new home. In poems such as Immigrants at central station Skyznecki illustrates an environment of anxiety and trepidation, however, he finishes the poem with sentiments of hope of the new future, the new world the immigrants were travelling to, along âglistening tracks of steelâ.\n\nHeritage\n\nAn individualâs heritage, that is the places and people from which they come to identify with, is seen to have a profound impact on the characters in Skrzyneckiâs poems. There are several poems set in graveyards or in Europe where Peter questions his knowledge of where he came from, and his sense of connection to these people and places. One of the most interesting set of poems regarding heritage is the poems regarding the different sections of a graveyard for the different groups, through this Skrzynecki touches on how most will never fully part with their heritage, instead, even in death, most will reconnect with their upbringing and hold on to their roots.\n\nCustoms\n\nThe difference in a culturesâ customs is a struggle seen throughout the text. However, customs are also seen to be the way in which migrants make themselves at home whilst being able to still identify with their past. Through the generational gap between Peter and his father, we can identify the difficulty older generations may have in letting go of customs, whilst the younger new Australians often find it far easier to attach themselves to new traditions.\n\nLanguage\n\nAn integral part of identity and in cultivating a sense of belonging is the language that we speak, as the way in which we are able to communicate ourselves and who we have accessible conversation has a large impact on oneâs sense of belonging or disconnect from a culture . This is due to language barriersâ ability to foster or inhibit connection. We see this as Peter demonstrates his struggle at times to identify with his Polish roots, symbolised in his loss of Polish language as he âforgot [his] first Polish wordâ. Despite his father repeating it until he never forgets, this forgetfulness illustrates the effort which is often required to remain connected to heritage when physically distant from it. Languageâs ability to also expose the differences between people and make them feel like outsiders is also explored in First day of school and The Polish Immigrant as people such as teachers struggle with the pronunciation of Polish names and inevitably have to ask âboy, how do you pronounce that?â. We see through these poems how disconnect can be fostered due to the struggle of communication as the picking apart of their names make the new immigrants feel âtiredâ, âembarrass[ed]â and as if their name was that of a âEuropean diseaseâ. Language is also seen to hold migrants back as seen in Migrant Bachelor where a lack of a familiar language relegates a migrant to âfactory chimneys and punch card clocksâ which âask no proof of speechâ. Â This struggle with language, both the disconnect and joy that comes with communicating and the opportunities it affords individuals, is essential in determining how one identifies themselves.\n\nFamily/Ancestry\n\nHow connection to family members and knowledge of ancestry impacts sense of identity is investigated through many family poems and through Skrzyneckiâs somewhat frequent admissions of remorse in regard to not knowing the history behind objects or people. We also see how a difference in sense of belonging can affect relationships, in that we see Peter and his father donât have the closest of relationships, likely due to Peter feeling he belongs to Australia whilst Feliks still had strong connections to his Polish upbringing. Â We also see this regret of disconnect when Skrzynecki writes about his mother and the photograph he has of her and the man that was his father, and how he wishes he had asked about it more. Whilst Skrzynecki mainly describes the immigrant experience in his poems, we can also find an overarching warning to not take loved one, and their knowledge for granted, as often we donât have them for as long as we would hope.\n\nMemories\n\nSkrzynecki often reminisces about his childhood and uses it as a way to explore both his experience in his new world of Australia, and his old world of his Polish roots. We see Skrzynecki in Migrant Centre Site, revisiting the location where he first lived after arriving in Australia, noting that there was nothing to âcommemorate [their] arrivalâ, this perhaps demonstrates his desire for a legacy, to leave a footprint of the journey so many âthousandâ migrants travelled and not just a âslab of cementâ as if his home was a dead âcemeteryâ. He also reminisces in Old Hostel Site where he explores the âimmense souvenirsâ and âunclaimed baggageâ that is one of the first sites in Australia his parents arrived at. Using this jargon regarding travel, Skrzynecki reminds readers of the many miles migrants often have to travel to reach Australia.\n\nNature\n\nSkrzynecki often uses nature to symbolise the migrant experience, as demonstrated by the birds in his poem Migrant Hostel. In this poem migrants are compared to a âhoming pigeon/circling to get its bearingsâ as Peter remarks on the struggle of taking someone out of their previous home, like an animal out of its natural habitat.\n\nNature is also a major element in Skrzynecki's effort to become an Australian poet, his frequent referencing of Australian landscapes signposting his journey to identify as an Australian, as well as an Australian poet.\n\nHope and Loss\n\nNot only does Skrzynecki detail the hope for a new future and loss of home common in a migrantâs experience, his poems also cover other common situations of love and loss, such as his emotional poem Leukemia which details the journey of his father as a leukemia patient. This shows belonging and identity in a far different light, not in relation to a country but being identified by your sickness which âowns your nameâ. This explores the common experience where a patient feels defined by their condition and struggles to imagine/remember what life is like as a healthy individual.\n\nMetalanguage, Symbols and Motifs in Old/New World\n\nâ¢ Feliks Skrzyneckiâs garden: due to his strong bond to his Polish roots Feliks arguably never felt a sense of belonging in Australia. Instead we find he creates a sense of belonging by cultivating a home of his own, a garden.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki often uses the natural world such as fish and birds to mirror the migrant journey.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki litters his poems with heirlooms such as watches, hammers and photos, often to illustrate how despite having these possessions Peter frequently finds that he doesnât know the full story of his heritage and his parentâs life. In his rediscovery of the heirlooms we often see his disconnect from his background and his regret of not learning more about it.\n\nâ¢ The use of a colloquial idiom of âkept pace only with the Joneses'' in Feliks Skrzynecki, to reference how his belonging only feels surface deep. However, as they are only the Joneses of âhis own mindâs makingâ it also showcases his commitment to not simply copy and to still be individual.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki often uses places of transit such as train stations or hostels to showcase the uncertainty often experienced in a migrantâs journey.\n\nQuick Tips\n\nResearch the places referenced in Skrzynecki poems such as Mt Warning\n\nLearn to spell the authors last name\n\nDonât just analyse the poems individually, try and see the big picture and apply the overarching themes\n\nFor a more detailed guide on how to ACE VCE Text Response, I think youâd love the free sample of our top-rated eBook, How To Write A Killer Text Response!

Although, itâs important not to take Lewisâ development at face value. His growth is used to highlight many of Nowraâs values on issues surrounding love, fidelity, madness and reality, just to name a few. Itâs also important to look at the development (or lack of development) of other characters and think about why Nowra might have included them in the play. Luckily for you, CosÃ¬ is quite a short play and doesnât have a huge cast of characters. However, this means that itâs even more important to get a great understanding of each character â theyâre all there for a reason!Â\n\nTo fully understand this text, youâll need to move beyond analysing characters and dialogue and consider Nowraâs main messages. CosÃ¬ is essentially a social commentary, packed full of criticisms of conventional perspectives and values. Also, CosÃ¬ is full of symbols and imagery, which can help you score highly on your essays if you integrate them into your work. Lastly, it's vital to remember that CosÃ¬ is a play, not a book, and on top of that, it is a play within a play. This means that setting, structure and stage directions are all crucial, and make for a high-scoring essay.\n\nSetting\n\nMelbourne Mental Institution, Australia during the 1970s.\n\nAll of the action takes place inside a burnt-out, derelict theatre. This serves to create an atmosphere of confinement for the audience, encouraging them to reflect on the stifling experience of the patients.\n\nCosÃ¬ is divided into two acts and nine scenes. The play is dominated by Lewisâ development. Act 1 highlights his uncertainty and distance from the world of the asylum. Whereas by Act 2, we see Lewis become more invested in the patients and the asylum, as his relationships with the other characters grow. Lewisâ development is symbolised through the changing imagery throughout the play, specifically fire and water.\n\nCosÃ¬ also is a piece of metatheatre, which Nowra achieves through structuring it as a âplay within a playâ. Metatheatre means that the play draws attention to its distance from reality. This makes sense in relation to CosÃ¬, as Nowra is continually encouraging his audience to accept their own reality instead of falling into escapism. Including CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte in CosÃ¬ also serves to highlight the difference in popular opinion between Mozartâs era and the 1970s, while emphasising the continuity of love. This contrast also helps Lewis to come to terms with his valuation of love over war, which is at odds with the common opinions of his society.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe line between reality and illusion is explored through the characters who are labelled as âinsaneâ as well as those considered ânormal.â Nowra demonstrates that reality is unique for each person, and often people may slip into illusions in order to avoid the truth. It is suggested that although they may not have been completely ânormalâ, those considered to be âinsaneâ still possess great insight that ânormalâ people may overlook. Additionally, CosÃ¬ reminds the reader of the absurdities of a mental asylum shunned by society, which would only have added to patientsâ instabilities, especially as families dealt with the matter secretly. Furthermore, the issue of love and fidelity that was valued so highly in Mozartâs era, is proven to still be relevant in our modern times. Ultimately, CosÃ¬ is a play that criticises traditional structures and views of society â whether they be asylums, university education or harsh stigma. Nowra encourages his audience to accept both the complexity of people and of life, which begins with accepting your own reality.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nLewis\n\nThe protagonist of CosÃ¬, Lewis is a new university graduate who has agreed to direct a play cast with patients from a mental institution because he needs money. At first, Lewis shares the same values as his friends Nick and Lucy -Â that love is ânot so importantâ in the days of politics and war. During the time he spends with the patients, however, Lewis experiences a turning point in his understanding and perception of people. By the end of the play, Lewis learns to value love and friendship over war and politics, even stating that âwithout love, the world wouldnât mean as muchâ. In emphasising the development of Lewisâ values away from the social norm, Nowra highlights the confining nature of society and the danger of its limited focus, which fails to recognise the value of love and companionship.Â\n\nAdditionally, Nowra blurs the lines between insanity and sanity by portraying Lewis as a bridge between the ârealâ world and that of the asylum. At the beginning of the play, Lewis states that his grandmother was in an asylum. However, despite knowing that âshe had gone madâ, he reflects that âshe was still [his] grandmother.â This, alongside his passion for Julie, enables Lewis to see the patients as people, not their illnesses. Therefore, he subconsciously allows himself to be influenced by them, just as he influences them. This contradicts the traditional views surrounding the unproductivity of the mentally ill and instead highlights their value and worth. Therefore, Nowra warns against dismissing individuals who are mentally ill, instead highlighting their capacity to garner change and therefore be productive and valuable members of society.\n\nMoreover, not only is Lewis involved in directing CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, but he also finds himself playing the part of Fernando. This again further reinforces his role as a bridge between society and the asylum (and his connection to its patients), and he ends up embodying the role. Like Fernando, Lewis is unfaithful to his partner. While still in a relationship with his girlfriend Lucy, Lewis becomes intimate with a patient, Julie. Nowra uses his unfaithfulness as evidence of the indiscriminate nature of infidelity â it is not restricted only to women.\n\nFinally, CosÃ¬ explores how Lewis deals with a hardship that he essentially created for himself â he signed up to direct the play. This links to Nowraâs view of the senselessness of war, which he views as a problem that mankind has created for themselves.\n\nLucy\n\nGirlfriend and roommate of Lewis, Lucy cannot understand why Lewis is directing a play about love when thousands are dying in the war. She has an affair with Nick, who shares similar beliefs â that politics and the Vietnam War protest are more important than anything else. The flippant nature with which she regards her affair with Nick as purely sexual is also reflective of her lack of value towards love. Thus, Nowra portrays Lucy as a personification of the societal norms of the 1970s â she is political, into free love and challenges traditional notions of femininity.\n\nFurthermore, it is ironic that Lucy and Lewis have similar names. At the start of the play, Lewis allows himself to be influenced by Lucyâs values rather than his own, but by the end, Lewisâ true views prove to be very different from hers.Â\n\nLucy also acts as a catalyst for Lewisâ change and development. She pushes him to âmake a choiceâ between the world of insanity and fidelity that represents truth for Lewis, or the world of sanity, free love and politics that Lewis comes to view as restrictive and stifling.\n\nNick\n\nAn experienced student director, roommate and friend of Lewis who is heavily involved in the moratorium (a protest against the Vietnam War). He promises to help Lewis direct CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, however he quickly breaks this vow in order to spend time furthering his political career with Lucy. Lewis later discovers that Lucy and Nick are having an affair. Unlike Lewis, however, Nick views his relationship with Lucy as âonly sexâ, therefore suggesting his superficiality and lack of compassion.Â\n\nThis superficiality is further shown through his obsession with the moratorium and his disinterest in Lewisâ CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte. He criticises Lewis for prioritising theatre over politics, stating that âonly mad people in this day and age would do a work about love and infidelity.â This suggests that what drives Nick is a desire to be seen doing the ânormalâ and ârightâ things, rather than an intrinsic belief that what he is doing is good. He views life as a series of transactions and values activities based on the immediate benefit that they bring him. For example, he admitted to helping Lewis with his direction only âso [Lewis would] help [him] on the moratorium committeeâ.Â\n\nOverall, Nick lives up to his label of being an âegotistical pigâ who âlikes the sound of his own voiceâ. He is used by Nowra as a benchmark with which Lewisâ development is compared (i.e. we can see how much Lewis has developed by comparing him to Nick). For example, at the start of the play Lewis shares similar superficial values to Nick, admitting to only take the directing job for a bit of money; however, by the end of CosÃ¬, he holds vastly different views than Nick.\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nThemes\n\nFidelity & Infidelity\n\nAccording to Mozartâs CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, fidelity is depicted as an ideal that is never achieved. Since âwomen are like thatâ â the interpretation of âCosÃ¬ fan tutteâ, Mozart supported the belief that men should simply accept that women will inevitably be disloyal in relationships. Nowra echoes this view of women through Lewis and Lucyâs relationship. While Lucy is âsleepingâ with Lewis, she is also triflingly âhaving sexâ with Nick. When Lewis discovers Lucyâs betrayal, she waves aside his shock, defending herself, âit is not as if weâre married.â The revelation thus does prove Mozart right, that âwomanâs constancy is like the Arabian Phoenix. Everyone swears it exists, but no one has seen it.â\n\nAlthough the women in both CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte and CosÃ¬ are shown to be unfaithful, so are the men. While the men in CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte do not actively participate in adultery, they do fabricate their departure to the war and also disguise themselves as âAlbanians.â Their deception is also a betrayal to their wives. Meanwhile, Don Alfonso manipulates everyone. As seen in CosÃ¬, Lewis is unfaithful to Lucy as he kisses Julie during rehearsals. Julie later reveals that she has a girlfriend who she would prefer to be with, confirming that both men and women are unfaithful in relationships, despite whatever values they may claim to have.\n\nNowra considers many perspectives of love and fidelity, without offering a definitive opinion. Instead, he explores the progression (or stagnation) of charactersâ opinions on love and contrasts them to those of other characters, in the hope of highlighting its complexity. Nick and Lucy both view love as an indulgence that is incompatible with politics and secondary to lifeâs basic needs. Whereas Lewis claims, âwithout love, the world wouldnât mean that muchâ. These differences between Nick and Lucyâs view on love and Lewisâ, are major contributors to the deterioration of their relationships. Therefore, Nowra shows that communication and truthfulness are needed for healthy, and reciprocal, relationships.\n\nOverall, while CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte presents love and fidelity as wavering, Nowra provides a more practical view of love. Nowra suggests that love is complex and cannot be fully understood or tamed, instead portraying it as akin to madness. As love is universal, this view ties in nicely with his non-judgmental perspective on madness and insanity.\n\nSanity & Insanity\n\nThe line between sanity and insanity is explored through the juxtaposition of the patients and society. In the 1970s, those who behaved abnormally were declared to be âinsaneâ and placed in mental institutions that were shunned by society. As scientific developments have now informed us, these environments often failed to assist their patients. The use of electric shock therapy, for example, frequently led to severe, long-term negative effects upon patients.\n\nWhile the patients were viewed as âmadmenâ by outsiders, Lewis soon discovers that they are, in many ways, ordinary people. Although each patient has a mental flaw, all possess interesting opinions and beliefs on different matters. Additionally, Nowra encourages his readers to view insanity as more complex than a diagnosis or something that can be fixed with a âcoat of paintâ. Instead, he suggests that insanity is imposed on people through the judgment of others.\n\nNowra also attempts to blur the lines between sanity and insanity to emphasize the indiscriminate nature of madness. This is seen through Lewisâ character, who consistently bridges the gap between madness and normalcy. For example, despite his âsaneâ status, he is mistaken for a patient by Justin, joins Roy in imitating electric shock therapy, replaces Doug in the play, and stands with the patients against Justin.\n\nOverall, Nowra portrays insanity as a matter of perspective, rather than an objective diagnosis. He refuses to define madness, instead depicting it as somewhere on the spectrum of human behaviour. In doing so, he critisises traditional perspectives of sanity and insanity and instead encourages his audiences to consider the complexity of madness.Â\n\nReality & Illusion\n\nThe question of what is real or an illusion is weaved through the patientsâ state of mentality. As shown through Ruth who struggles to pretend like she is having real coffee on stage, it is difficult for some to distinguish reality from illusion, even if it is clear to everyone else. For others, they may willingly refuse the truth and succumb to an illusion. Lewis deluded himself into believing that Lucy was faithful, when all signs (such as Nick residing in the same home and Nick and Lucy spending time together) indicated that Lucy was, in fact, blatantly disloyal. Much like Lewisâ protective delusion, Roy uses illusions of a happy childhood to shield him from facing his reality. This builds upon his tendencies to blame others for his behaviour â he is inherently unable to face the truth of his âinsanityâ and so manipulates his reality to make it more bearable.Â\n\nThroughout CosÃ¬, Nowra also explores the relativity of reality. For the patients of the asylum, pretending to give electric shock therapy to others âseems realerâ than âkissing and stuffâ, whereas the opposite would be true in âordinaryâ society. However, CosÃ¬ also suggests that imagination has the capacity to empower. Through participating in the play, which is an illusory form of reality, the patients are able to explore their views on love and commitment.\n\nUltimately, the behaviour of characters such as Roy and Ruth encourages us to consider the reliability (or unreliability) of our own perceptions. Alongside this, Nowra stresses the importance of being able to accept your own reality, as he shows that characters who fail to do so, also fail to experience personal growth (e.g. Roy, Julie).\n\nSymbolism\n\nBurnt-Out Theatre\n\nThe setting of a burnt-out theatre depicts the miserable environment in which the patients of mental institutions are forced to live. As they are ostracised by the community, a lack of care and support is shown through the rejected and deteriorating theatre. The patientsâ considerable enthusiasm highlights their unfortunate circumstances, since even a chance to spend their time in an old building performing a play causes much excitement.\n\nAlthough we see the theatre being touched up with new lights and a âcoat of paintâ, it still remains derelict and run-down. Nowra uses this to symbolise the futility of surface-level treatments (such as medication and isolation) of mental illnesses, and how we should instead focus on seeing the person behind the illness.\n\nHowever, Nowra also uses the theatre as a symbol of hope. Despite its desolation, it is in the theatre that Lewis feels safe to grow and develop. Additionally, Julie and Lewisâ kiss takes place on the theatreâs stage. The kiss itself represents Lewis becoming more comfortable with himself and his increasingly counter-cultural views.\n\nArabian Phoenix\n\nThe women in both CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte and CosÃ¬ are compared with the Arabian Phoenix. The mythical creature is a representation of women, beautiful and enchanting, capturing men such as the god Apollo with its voice. This reflects the power of women to attract men. Nevertheless, its rarity, as often commented on in CosÃ¬ , is linked with the seemingly infrequent loyalty demonstrated by women.\n\nThe frequent reference to the Arabian Phoenix throughout CosÃ¬ continually reinforces the playâs misogynistic undertone. Its rarity is likened to the absence of womenâs fidelity, yet never male fidelity. Similarly, Nowra invites his audience to condemn Lucyâs unfaithfulness towards Lewis, yet we are not encouraged to feel the same way about Lewisâ unfaithfulness to Lucy. Â\n\nLight and Dark\n\nThe lights in Act 1, Scene 1 highlight Lewisâ entrance into a new world, where he befriends patients who will ultimately help him to learn and develop. At first Lewis, much like Lucy and Nick, possesses a âpitch blackâ perspective of the world. This is a representation of their modern beliefs that circulate around politics and war. When the lights are turned on, Roy is present, demonstrating that the patients of the mental institutions are the source for Lewisâ changing perspective throughout the play. Nowra also uses the lights to represent the hope for change that Lewis brings to the patients, and vice versa.\n\nLight is also used to directly juxtapose the chaos and desperation that darkness brings. Before Lewis entered the theatre, it was dark and derelict, symbolising the abandonment and hopelessness of the asylumâs patients. This desperation is viewed in another light during Julie and Lewisâ kiss (which takes place in the dark). In this instance, their desire for each other and the chaos that ensues is liberating for Lewis, as it enables him to come to terms with what he truly values.\n\nHowever, Julie notes that the wards are ânever really darkâ as âthereâs always a light on in the corridor.â In this sense, darkness symbolises autonomy and freedom, whereas light represents the constant monitoring and scrutinising that the patients are subjected to.\n\nEssay Topics\n\n1.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nCharacter-Based Prompt: It is not only Lewis who develops in CosÃ¬, but other characters as well. Discuss.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nSimply spot a characterâs name and there you have it, itâs a character-based prompt. However, itâs important to recognise that your essay does not need to revolve around only the character(s) in the prompt but should also incorporate discussion of other major and minor characters as well.Â\n\nIn this topic, it is important to incorporate other characters, such as the patients, into your essay, because they are crucial to Lewisâ development. To ensure that you stay on topic, it is best to include a paragraph (or paragraphs) that explore characters other than Lewis and their development. Also try and focus on different areas/types of development (i.e. not just Lewisâ changing values).Â\n\nHighlight Key Words:\n\nIt is not only Lewis who develops in CosÃ¬, but other characters as well.Â\n\nFind Synonyms:\n\nDevelops: learns, grows, changes, flourishes, progresses, maturesÂ\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nCosÃ¬ explores the development/growth of multiple characters, including Lewis.Â\n\nLewis is the central catalyst that enables other characterâs development to be seen (such as Ruthâs and Zacâs)Â\n\nHowever, we also see characters who fail to develop. This is either because they fail to accept their own reality (Roy) or they fail to accept the errors in their thinking (Lucy, Nick)Â\n\nNowra also uses Lewis as the benchmark against which the development of other characters is measured. For example, Nickâs lack of development is highlighted through comparing his stagnation/unchanging ways to Lewisâ growth.Â\n\nLewisâ development is facilitated by the patients. Nowra uses this to suggest the productivity of the mentally ill and challenge traditional stereotypes that label them as incapable.Â\n\nThrough Lewisâ development, Nowra highlights the falsity in societal stereotypes of the mentally ill (i.e. Lewisâs views change from being discriminatory and stereotypical to more compassionate, and well founded.)Â\n\nImagery and symbolism are used to represent development and growth (fire and water) as well as Lewisâ catalytic nature (light and dark).Â\n\nStep 3: Create a PlanÂ\n\nContention: Nowra encourages his audience to reconsider their perspective on the mentally ill by highlighting their capacity to not only change themselves, but enact change in others.\n\nTopic Sentence 1: Through his exploration of Lewisâ changing ideals during CosÃ¬, Nowra attempts to highlight the value of companionship and productivity of the mentally ill, which act to increase Lewisâ confidence when faced with adversity.\n\nExamples: Lewisâ changing ideas on love and fidelity, Lewisâ changing levels of subservience to Lucy and NickÂ\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Not so important.\"\n\n\"Without love, the world wouldnât mean as much.\"\n\n\"They are coming to take me away, ha, ha.\"\n\n\"Not sing that.\"\n\n\"I said, donât sing that song.\"\n\nLinking Sentence(s): In contrasting Lewisâ meekness to his boldness, Nowra alludes to the personal benefits that personal growth can have. Additionally, he ultimately encourages his audience to view Lewisâ learning as evidence against the common notion of the unproductivity of the mentally ill, as we see Lewisâ development flourish during his time at the asylum.\n\nTopic Sentence 2: Moreover, throughout CosÃ¬ we see Lewis develop a greater understanding of the complexity of madness due to his partnership with the patients.Â\n\nExamples: Lewisâ changing perspective of the patients, Lewisâ involvement with the patients beyond his role as director, fire and water imageryÂ\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Uncertain.\"\n\n\"Will go bezerk without their medication.\"\n\n\"Unable to believe he has found himself caught up in [directing].\"\n\n\"Water drip[ping] though the hole in the roof.\"\n\nLinking Sentence: Ultimately, through highlighting the development of Lewisâ views towards insanity, Nowra positions his audience to reflect on the complexity of madness and thus warns of the danger of stereotypes.\n\nTopic Sentence 3: Furthermore, as an outsider, Lewis assists the patients in their development, acting as their connection to the real world and ultimately providing a space for them to grow and flourish.Â\n\nExamples: Juxtaposition of light and dark, Ruthâs development.Â\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Chink of light.\"\n\n\"Burnt out theatre.\"\n\n\"Real coffee.\"\n\n\"Real cappuccino machine.\"\n\n\"Wasnât [her], it was the character.\"\n\n\"Time and motion expert.\"\n\nLinking Sentence: Ultimately, Nowra explores the learning and growth of characters in CosÃ¬ to not only highlight the necessity of a humanistic approach to treating mental illness, but also to illustrate the nature of mental health as a continuum, on which no one person needs to be stationary forever.â\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our CosÃ¬ Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!
