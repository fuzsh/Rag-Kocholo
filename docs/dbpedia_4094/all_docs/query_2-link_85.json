        "text": "Ray Liotta (Goodfellas) passed away back in May of 2022 while he was in the Dominican Republic for the filming of the thriller Dangerous Waters. That movie has since been completed and is scheduled to reach theatres and VOD on October 13th – and with that date just a month away, a trailer for Dangerous Waters has arrived online. You can check it out in the embed above.\n\nJohn Barr, who made his feature directorial debut with the 2020 thriller Blood and Money, directed Dangerous Waters and crafted the story for the film with screenwriter Mark Jackson. Here’s the synopsis: A sailing adventure spirals out of control in this tightly wound-survival thriller. 19-year-old Rose lives a tough, small-town life in Florida with her single mother Alma. Their luck seems to take a turn when Alma’s new businessman boyfriend, Derek, whisks them away on a sailing adventure to Bermuda. While at sea, Derek’s “business” is revealed to be less than legitimate when their boat is attacked by savage villains, set on fire, and Alma is viciously killed. Distraught and persecuted by Derek and The Captain, Rose unearths a primal instinct of survival and a terrifying need for vengeance. She will not yield until those responsible for her mother’s murder are dead.\n\nLiotta plays The Captain and is joined in the cast by Odeya Rush (Let It Snow) as Rose, Saffron Burrows (Deep Blue Sea) as Alma, and Eric Dane (Euphoria) as Derek.\n\nA collaboration between Signature Films and Rio Luna Films, Dangerous Waters was produced by Rio Luna Films’ Suza Horvat and Signature Films’ Marc Goldberg. Capstone Global’s Christian Mercuri and Signature’s Sarah Gabriel and Gareth Williams serve as executive producers, along with co-producers Brianna Johnson and Ben Jacques.\n\nWhat did you think of the Dangerous Waters trailer? Will you be watching this movie in October? Let us know by leaving a comment below.\n\nI wasn’t sure what was going to happen to this project after Liotta passed away, so I’m very glad to learn that Barr and his collaborators were able to finish the movie so we can see Liotta’s performance in it. I look forward to watching it."
