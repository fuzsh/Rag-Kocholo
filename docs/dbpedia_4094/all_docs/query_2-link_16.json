The trio rail against the system, finding strength in their friendship. But this is challenged when the school’s matron (Rima Te Wiata) divides them.\n\nDirector Josephine Stewart-Te Whiu said: “The story is set in 1950s New Zealand, in a world where, ridiculously, teenage girls were seen as a risk to society. It’s a film that celebrates the joy and power of female friendships.”\n\nProduced for Piki Films (Jojo Rabbit, The Breaker Upperers, Hunt for the Wilderpeople) by Morgan Waru and Polly Fryer; Carthew Neal, Taika Waititi, Bill Way, Elliott Whitton and Emily Gotto as Executive Producers. We Were Dangerous was shot on location in the South Island of New Zealand. Filming on Ōtamahua Island was done with the support of Te Hapū o Ngāti Wheke.\n\nWe Were Dangerous was made with investment from the New Zealand Film Commission, the New Zealand Government’s Screen Production Grant, Fit Via Vi, Screen CanterburyNZ, Department of Post, Native Audio, and Kiwibank, the film will be distributed in New Zealand by Madman and Piki Films, and by Madman in Australia.\n\nWe Were Dangerous will open the 2024 Whānau Mārama New Zealand International Film Festival in Wellington on Wednesday 31 July and Auckland on Wednesday 7 August, and go on to screen at other festival locations throughout the country ahead of its release in cinemas nationwide on Thursday 22 August.\n\nENDS\n\nImage download here\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nBex Martelletti // 818\n\nbex@818.co.nz\n\n027 528 6839\n\nEDITORS NOTES:\n\nJosephine Stewart-Te Whiu (Ngāpuhi, Te Rarawa) was one of nine Māori filmmakers on Waru (2017), which premiered at TIFF.
