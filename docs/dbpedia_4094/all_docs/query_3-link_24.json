        "text": "Introduction\n\nNot gonna lie, this novel is a bit of a tricky one to introduce. World War II, arguably one of the darkest events of human history, has been the basis of so much writing across so many genres; authors, academics, novelists have all devoted themselves to understanding the tragedies, and make sense of how we managed to do this to one another. Many reflect on the experiences of children and families whose lives were torn apart by the war.\n\nIn some ways, Doerr is another author who has attempted this. His novel alludes to the merciless anonymity of death in war, juxtaposes individualism with collective national mindlessness, and seeks out innocence amidst the brutality of war.\n\nWhat makes this novel difficult to introduce is the way in which Doerr has done this; through the eyes of two children on opposite sides of the war, he explores how both of them struggle with identity, morality and hope, each in their own way. Their storylines converge in the bombing of Saint-Malo, demonstrating that war can be indiscriminate in its victimsâthat is, it does not care if its victims are children or adults, innocent or guilty, French or German. However, their interaction also speaks to the humanity that lies in all of us, no matter how deeply buried.\n\nA very quick history lesson\n\nFast Five Facts about World War II:\n\nLasting 1939-1945, the war was fought between the Axis powers (Germany, Japan and Italy) and the Allies (basically everyone else, but mainly England, France, and later the US). Whilst it was Germany who started the war, the intervention of the US at the end of five long years of fighting ultimately helped the Allies win.\n\nVarious forms of technology were first used, or found new uses, during the war. Aircraft carriers and various planes (fighters, bombers etc.) became more important than ever, while Hitlerâs use of tanks allowed him to take over much of Europe very quickly.\n\nOther forms of new technology included one of the worldâs first electronic computers that was used to codebreak (stop reading now and watch The Imitation Game if you havenât already! Totally counts as studying, right?), as well as radio and radar, used to communicate and also to detect enemies in the field.\n\nWorld War II is also referred to as the Holocaust, the name given to Hitlerâs attempted genocide of the Jewish people. 6 million Jews died in the war, and as many as 15 million others died in total.\n\nGermanyâs initial conquest of Europe was swift and brutal. Within a month, Poland had already surrendered and within a year, so had France. However, there were also resistance groups all over these countries which sought to undermine the Nazi regime in a number of ways, both big and small.\n\nMy best attempt to give a general plot overview of this very long book\n\nâ\n\nDisclaimer: this is a very, very broad overview of the novel and it is absolutely not a substitute for actually reading it (please actually read it).\n\nChronologically, we start in 1934, five years before the war. Marie-Laure is a French girl who lives with her father Daniel Leblanc, working at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. As she starts to go blind, Daniel teaches her Braille, and makes her wooden models of their neighbourhood to help her navigate. Six years later, the Nazis invade France, and they flee the capital to find Danielâs uncle Etienne, who lives in the seaside town of Saint-Malo; Daniel was also tasked with safeguarding a precious gem, the Sea of Flames, from the Nazis.\n\nIn Saint-Malo, Daniel also builds Marie-Laure a model of the town, hiding the gem inside. Meanwhile, she befriends Etienne, who suffers from agoraphobia as a result of the trauma from the First World War. He is charming and very knowledgeable about science, having made a series of scientific radio broadcasts with his brother Henri (who died in WWI). She also befriends his cook, Madame Manec, who participates in the resistance movement right up until she falls ill and dies.\n\nHer father is also arrested (and would ultimately die in prison), and the loss of their loved ones prompts both Etienne and Marie-Laure to begin fighting back. Marie-Laure is also given a key to a grotto by the seaside which is full of molluscs, her favourite kind of animal.\n\nOn the other side of the war, Werner is, in 1934, an 8 year-old German boy growing up in an orphanage with his sister Jutta in the small mining town of Zollverein. They discover a radio, which allows them to listen to a broadcast from miles away (it was Henri and Etienneâs), and Werner learns French to try and understand it. One day, he repairs the radio of a Nazi official, who recruits him to the Hitler Youth on account of his ingenuity (and his very blonde hair and very blue eyes, considered to be desirable traits by the regime). Jutta grows increasingly distant from Werner during this time, as she questions the morality of the Nazis.\n\nWerner is trained to be a soldier along with a cohort of other boys, and additionally learns to use radio to locate enemy soldiers. He befriends Frederick, an innocent kid who was only there because his parents were richâFrederick would eventually fall victim to the brutality of the instructors, and Werner tries to quit out of solidarity. Unfortunately, he is sent into the army to apply his training to actual warfare. He fights with Frank Volkheimer, a slightly ambiguous character who a tough and cruel soldier, but also displays a capacity to be kind and gentle (including a fondness for classical music). The war eventually takes them to Saint-Malo.\n\nAlso around 1943 or so, a Nazi sergeant, Reinhold von Rumpel, begins to track down the Sea of Flames. He would have been successful ultimately had it not been for Werner, who stops him in order to save Marie Laure.\n\nAs America begins to turn the war around, Werner is arrested and dies after stepping on a German landmine; Marie-Laure and Etienne move back to Paris. Marie-Laure eventually becomes a scientist specialising in the study of molluscs and has an extensive family of her own by 2014. Phew.\n\nTheme/s\n\nWhat kind of questions does Doerr raise through this plot? To some degree, the single central question of the novel is one of humanity, and this manifests in a few different ways.\n\nFirstly, to what extent are we in control of our own choices? Do we truly have free will to behave morally? The Nazi regime throws a spanner in the works here, as it makes incredibly inhumane demands on its people. Perhaps they fear punishment and have no choiceâWerner, for instance, does go along with everything. At the same time, his own sister manages to demonstrate critical thinking and moral reasoning well beyond her years, and it makes you wonder if there was potential for Werner to be better in this regard. Thereâs also the question of whether or not he redeemed himself in the end.\n\nThat being said, Werner is far from the only character who struggles with thisâconsider the perfumer, Claude Levitte, who becomes a Nazi informer, or even ordinary French citizens who simply accept the German takeover. Do they actually have free will to resist, or is it even moral for them to do so?\n\nHannah Arendt famously coined the phrase âthe banality of evil,â referring to how broader movements of inhumanity (such as the Holocaust) can be compartmentalised until individual actions feel perfectly banal, commonplace and ordinary. This is what allowed people to do evil things without actually feeling or even being inherently evilâthey were just taking orders, after all. Consider the role of free will in this context.\n\nThis brings us to the broader âthemeâ of war in general: in particular, what kinds of acts are Â suddenly justifiable in war? Etienne and Madame Manec, for instance, even disagree on the morality of resistance, which can frequently involve murder. Etienneâs pacifist stance is a result of the scale of deaths in the previous world war. At the same time, the climactic event of the novel is an allied bombing of Saint-Malo, a French town, just because it had become a German outpost. Risking lives both French and German, this also highlights the ânecessityâ of some inhumane actions in times of war.\n\nOn a more optimistic note, a human quality that Doerr explores is our natural curiosity towards science. This is abundant in the childhoods of both protagonists, as Werner demonstrates dexterity with the radio at a very young age, and Marie-Laure a keen interest in marine biology. In particular, her blindness pushes her into avenues of science which she can experience without literal sight, such as the tactile sensations of mollusc shells. The title may hint at thisâfor all the light she cannot see, she seeks enlightenment through knowledge, which in turn gives her hope, optimism and purpose.\n\nAt the same time, the human desire to better understand the world can also be used inhumanelyâWerner used radio to learn through Etienne and Henriâs broadcasts, but he would later in life also use it to help his compatriots murder enemy soldiers. This alludes to the banality of evil again; by focusing on his very technical role and his unique understanding of the science behind radios, he is able to blind himself to the bigger picture of the evils he is abetting. Science is something that is so innately human, yet can also be used inhumanely as well.\n\nFor these reasons, Iâd suggest humanity is at the heart of the novel. There is a certain cruel randomness to death in war, but just because so many did perish doesnât mean that there arenât human stories worth searching for in the destruction. This is the lens that Doerr brings to the WWII narrative.\n\nSome symbols\n\nTo some degree, a lot of these symbols relate to humanity, which Iâve argued is the crux of the novel. Iâll keep this brief so as to not be too repetitive.\n\nOne major symbol is the radio, with its potential for good as well as for evil. On one hand, it is undoubtedly used for evil purposes, but it also acts as a source of hope, purpose, conviction and connection in the worst of times. It is what ultimately drives Werner to save Marie-Laure.\n\nAlong the same vein, whelks are also a major symbol, particularly for Marie-Laure. While an object of her fascination, they also represent strength for her, as they remain fixed onto rocks and withstand the beaks of birds who try to attack them. In fact, she takes âthe Whelkâ as a code-name for herself while aiding the resistance movement. Itâs also noteworthy that, given the atrocities of war, maybe animals are the only innocent beings left. As Saint-Malo is destroyed and the Sea of Flames discarded, it is the seaside ecosystem that manages to live on, undisturbed. In this sense, the diamond can be seen as a manifestation of human greed, harmless once removed from human society.\n\nFinally, itâs also worth considering the wooden models that Daniel builds for Marie-Laure. They represent his immense love for her, and more broadly the importance of family, but the models also attempt to shrink entire cities into a predictable, easily navigable system. As weâve seen, this is what causes people to lose sight of the forest for the treesâto hone in on details and lose track of the bigger picture around them. The models are an oversimplification of life, and an illusion of certainty, in a time when life was complicated and not at all certain for anyone.\n\nConclusion\n\nIdentity, morality and hopeâthese things pretty much shape what it means to be human. Throughout All the Light We Cannot See though, characters sometimes struggle with all three of them at the same time.\n\nAnd yet they always manage to find something within themselves, some source of strength, some sense of right and wrong, some humanity in trying times. Doerr explores this capacity amply in this novel, and in this sense his novel is not just another story about WWIIâitâs a story about the things that connect us, always.\n\nEssay prompt breakdown\n\nTranscription\n\nThrough the prompt that weâll be looking at today, the main message I wanted to highlight was to always try and look for layers of meaning. This could mean really being across all of the symbols, motifs and poetic elements of a text, and itâs especially important for a novel as literary as this one.\n\nYou might not have been particularly happy to find out youâre going to have to study All The Light We Cannot Seeâit is probably the longest text on the entire text listâbut itâs also a really beautiful, well-written book that deservedly took out the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2015.\n\nIn this novel, Anthony Doerr tells the World War 2 story through a unique lens, or rather a unique combination of lenses, as he sets a 16-year-old French girl and a 17-year-old German boy on an unlikely path of convergence. Through the dangers and difficulties that they face, Doerrâs novel is one of growth and self-assuredness in a time when this seemed virtually impossible.\n\nThe essay topic weâll be looking at today is:\n\nAll The Light We Cannot See is a literal title for the novel, in that it exposes the darkness, evil and cruelty of which humans are demonstrably capable. Is this an accurate interpretation?\n\nAs usual, letâs define some keywords.\n\nI want to leave âdarknessâ for a little later, but letâs start with âevil and cruelty.â By themselves, they generally just mean immorality or inhumanity, but also keep in mind how they come across in charactersâ actions, since those will be the focus of our analysis. The word âdemonstrablyâ highlights this, since it means that any âevilâ you discuss needs to be demonstrated or proven.\n\nWith âdarknessâ, thatâs a bit more of a tricky term because it can mean any number of things. Here, it might be taken to mean bad intentions, corruption or anything like that, because it fits with âevil and crueltyâ. However, this is where the âinterpretationâ aspect of the prompt comes inâan interpretation being a way of explaining meaning, how do you explain the meaning of âdarknessâ in relation to the title? Darkness in this sense could be any number of things.\n\nNow, how should we plan for this topic? Letâs first consider if thereâs any room to challenge, since the prompt seems to only focus on the more negative, pessimistic side of the book. Iâd argue that with darkness, there is also some light in the form of kindness, charity and hope. Â\n\nThis all sounds pretty profound, but Iâm just trying to link it back to the bookâs title! I mean, thatâs what the topic is asking about, right?\n\nLetâs break this down into paragraphs.\n\nFor our first paragraph, a good starting point might be analysing the literal forms of darkness in the novel, and seeing what other interpretations we can get from those. A character that comes to mind is Marie-Laure, the French girl who cannot see any âlightâ due to her blindness. The title could be seen as an allusion to her character and by extension, the hopelessness that blindness might cause in the midst of a war. We could compare Marie-Laureâs situation with that of Werner, who faces the industrialization of his childhood town, watching it become more and more enveloped in âdarknessâ and as such, hopelessness.\n\nFor our next paragraph, we might drill down to deeper levels of interpreting darkness, because itâs often used as a metaphor for inhumanity. It isnât difficult to find inhumanity in the novel. Thereâs plenty of it peppered throughout Wernerâs storyline, particularly at Schulpforta, where the Hitler Youth were âtrainedâ, (to put it lightly). He and his peers are routinely drilled to âdrive the weakness from the corpsâ in humiliating exercises led by cruel instructors. They are also sometimes driven to cruelty towards one another, and Frederick, Wernerâs bunkmate, is relentlessly bullied for his perceived weakness.\n\nSo by now, itâs clear that the novel demonstrates the human capacity for experiencing âdarknessâ as well as inflicting it upon others. But, across these two layers of meaning, could there perhaps be some room to challenge these interpretations? This is something we should look at for our final paragraph.\n\nHere, I would probably argue that just as Doerr explores various forms of darkness, there is also enough âlightâ which allows some characters to overcome or escape from the darkness. These manifestations of light also require you to think about the different symbolic layers of the novel. On one level for example, looking at light literally, thereâs the message on Wernerâs radio that teaches us that, even though the brain is sealed in darkness, âthe world it constructsâ¦is full of light.â A deeper level of meaning to this may refer to the sense of scientific wonder and discovery which sometimes brings light to Werner, and also Frederick, his bunkmate at Schulpforta, when their lives there are at their most dark.\n\nConsider how, just as darkness has levels of interpretation and symbolism in this book, so does light and hope and joy, rather than just evil and cruelty.\n\nAnd thatâs it! Always delving deeper for meaning helps you to really make use of the symbols, imagery and motifs in a text, and I hope this novel in particular illustrates that idea.\n\nâ\n\nIntroduction\n\nPoetry. Students tend to have strong feelings about it, some love the melodic rhythm and the eloquent way in which it encapsulates life and others hate it, either because they find it a snooze-fest and would rather read the dictionary, or they simply donât know how to approach analysing it. Whatever boat you may be in, by the end of your study of Peter Skrzyneckiâs New/Old World poems, youâre bound to have a new appreciation for the art that is poetry and find analysing poems less of a daunting prospect and more a something easy to nail.\n\nBefore we begin diving into Skrzynecki, Iâd highly recommend that you check our LSGâs Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response. Itâs jam-packed with awesome, FREE advice for how to ACE Text Response.\n\nAnalysing Poetry in Old/New World\n\nUnlike other forms of text, a collection of poems is not one continuous body of writing, instead a poetry collection is more like a series of vignettes, snapshots into poignant moments, in this case, of an authorâs life. Whilst many students may struggle with this form and ask âHow many poems do I analyse? Do I need to know all of them?â, poems are easier than most texts to prioritise and categorise into themes and often have a significant amount of metalanguage. And in answer to your questions, whilst its best you analyse the whole collection to some extent, knowing 10 or so strategically chosen poems really well, covering all themes and types should hold you in good stead for any question thrown at you in the exam.\n\nContext\n\nPeter Skrzynecki wrote his poems over a significant amount of time, starting in 1970 and ending in 2006. This has given the collection a unique perspective, not only demonstrating a migrantâs journey through narrative, but also by providing the different attitudes and feelings of belonging, experienced by one individual as they try to assimilate in their new world over a period of time. This gives us, as students, a wonderful opportunity to look deeper into the text and identify Skrzyneckiâs differing positions in regard to identity, family and belonging, through the perspective from which he writes his poems at different stages of his life.\n\nTo learn more about the importance of context in VCE English, check out this blog post.\n\nThe Structure\n\nSkrzyneckiâs collection tends to feature three types of poem, by identifying these, analysing each piece can be made easier as similar types of poem often focus on similar themes. The three categories of poetry to look for are:\n\nNature Poems\n\nPeter Skrzynecki showcases his connection to Australia through poems that depict often idyllic landscapes, or the lives of common fauna of Australia, such as birds and fish.\n\nThe Immigrant Experience\n\nThese poems such as Immigrants at Central Station, Migrant Hostel and The Polish Immigrant offer an insight into the emotionally turbulent and difficult journey migrants go through to live in Australia. These poems also demonstrate the experiences of relief and joy felt when arriving, as well as emotions of fear, trepidation and disconnect in regards to both their new home and their old world.\n\nFamily Poems\n\nOften the most emotionally pulling, these poems tug at the heartstrings and showcase the relationships between Peter Skrzynecki and his family, as well as his exploration of his heritage, his ties to his Polish background.\n\nThe new/old world structure, similar to the old and new testament of the bible are used to highlight the old world of Skrzyneckiâs Polish roots and childhood, whilst the new world is his new life in Australia.\n\nRecurring Characters in Old/New World\n\nPeter Skrzynecki\n\nThe author of this text, as well as a character in his own right, Peter describes his triumphs and struggles of immigrating to Australia in his poems.\n\nFeliks Skrzynecki\n\nThe Polish adopted father of Peter, a âgentle manâ who immigrated to Australia with him family from Germany often demonstrates the struggle of the older generation to fully âbelongâ, as they have grown up amongst different customs. This difference in the two generationsâ assimilation is depicted in the poem Feliks Skrzynecki, as we see Feliks as attached to his Polish customs and traditions, as he âreminisce[s]â with his Polish friends. We also discover that he struggles with the English language, is a hard worker and has had cancer twice in his foot. Peter in comparison is seen to have far more of a disconnect with his Polish ancestry he âinherited unknowinglyâ and forget his âfirst Polish wordâ as he learns of a culture âfurther South of Hadrianâs Wallâ.\n\nThemes in Old/New World\n\nAs we all know, themes are an integral part of Text Response overall, and that still rings true for Skrzyneckiâs poetry. To learn more about how to implement themes into different types of Text Response prompts, check out our blog on LSGâs Five Types of Text Response Prompts!\n\nBelonging\n\nOne of the most central themes of Skrzyneckiâs poems is that of belonging. As the poems detail an immigrantâs emotional journey, alternating between feeling that they belong and donât belong, we are invited to grapple with what it means to belong both mentally and physically as well as what elements are required to feel a sense of belonging in community and country.\n\nIdentity\n\nIdentity is another central theme, one that runs closely to that of belonging, as a main part of oneâs identity is the culture/place/family to which they feel they belong. Old/New World: New and Selected Poems explores the formation and changes in a migrantâs sense of identity as they try to find belonging in their new Australian home as well as later, when they try to reconnect with their European heritage. To explore the theme of identity itâs best to break it down into several influential factors, which are listed below:\n\nPlace\n\nThe surroundings in which a person finds themselves, as well as the place they call home is an essential part of identity, as it showcases what place one identifies with and feels safe in. Â Several of the poems are set in places of transition, such as at a train station, this helps to emphasize the displacement some migrants may feel as they struggle to acclimatise to their new home. In poems such as Immigrants at central station Skyznecki illustrates an environment of anxiety and trepidation, however, he finishes the poem with sentiments of hope of the new future, the new world the immigrants were travelling to, along âglistening tracks of steelâ.\n\nHeritage\n\nAn individualâs heritage, that is the places and people from which they come to identify with, is seen to have a profound impact on the characters in Skrzyneckiâs poems. There are several poems set in graveyards or in Europe where Peter questions his knowledge of where he came from, and his sense of connection to these people and places. One of the most interesting set of poems regarding heritage is the poems regarding the different sections of a graveyard for the different groups, through this Skrzynecki touches on how most will never fully part with their heritage, instead, even in death, most will reconnect with their upbringing and hold on to their roots.\n\nCustoms\n\nThe difference in a culturesâ customs is a struggle seen throughout the text. However, customs are also seen to be the way in which migrants make themselves at home whilst being able to still identify with their past. Through the generational gap between Peter and his father, we can identify the difficulty older generations may have in letting go of customs, whilst the younger new Australians often find it far easier to attach themselves to new traditions.\n\nLanguage\n\nAn integral part of identity and in cultivating a sense of belonging is the language that we speak, as the way in which we are able to communicate ourselves and who we have accessible conversation has a large impact on oneâs sense of belonging or disconnect from a culture . This is due to language barriersâ ability to foster or inhibit connection. We see this as Peter demonstrates his struggle at times to identify with his Polish roots, symbolised in his loss of Polish language as he âforgot [his] first Polish wordâ. Despite his father repeating it until he never forgets, this forgetfulness illustrates the effort which is often required to remain connected to heritage when physically distant from it. Languageâs ability to also expose the differences between people and make them feel like outsiders is also explored in First day of school and The Polish Immigrant as people such as teachers struggle with the pronunciation of Polish names and inevitably have to ask âboy, how do you pronounce that?â. We see through these poems how disconnect can be fostered due to the struggle of communication as the picking apart of their names make the new immigrants feel âtiredâ, âembarrass[ed]â and as if their name was that of a âEuropean diseaseâ. Language is also seen to hold migrants back as seen in Migrant Bachelor where a lack of a familiar language relegates a migrant to âfactory chimneys and punch card clocksâ which âask no proof of speechâ. Â This struggle with language, both the disconnect and joy that comes with communicating and the opportunities it affords individuals, is essential in determining how one identifies themselves.\n\nFamily/Ancestry\n\nHow connection to family members and knowledge of ancestry impacts sense of identity is investigated through many family poems and through Skrzyneckiâs somewhat frequent admissions of remorse in regard to not knowing the history behind objects or people. We also see how a difference in sense of belonging can affect relationships, in that we see Peter and his father donât have the closest of relationships, likely due to Peter feeling he belongs to Australia whilst Feliks still had strong connections to his Polish upbringing. Â We also see this regret of disconnect when Skrzynecki writes about his mother and the photograph he has of her and the man that was his father, and how he wishes he had asked about it more. Whilst Skrzynecki mainly describes the immigrant experience in his poems, we can also find an overarching warning to not take loved one, and their knowledge for granted, as often we donât have them for as long as we would hope.\n\nMemories\n\nSkrzynecki often reminisces about his childhood and uses it as a way to explore both his experience in his new world of Australia, and his old world of his Polish roots. We see Skrzynecki in Migrant Centre Site, revisiting the location where he first lived after arriving in Australia, noting that there was nothing to âcommemorate [their] arrivalâ, this perhaps demonstrates his desire for a legacy, to leave a footprint of the journey so many âthousandâ migrants travelled and not just a âslab of cementâ as if his home was a dead âcemeteryâ. He also reminisces in Old Hostel Site where he explores the âimmense souvenirsâ and âunclaimed baggageâ that is one of the first sites in Australia his parents arrived at. Using this jargon regarding travel, Skrzynecki reminds readers of the many miles migrants often have to travel to reach Australia.\n\nNature\n\nSkrzynecki often uses nature to symbolise the migrant experience, as demonstrated by the birds in his poem Migrant Hostel. In this poem migrants are compared to a âhoming pigeon/circling to get its bearingsâ as Peter remarks on the struggle of taking someone out of their previous home, like an animal out of its natural habitat.\n\nNature is also a major element in Skrzynecki's effort to become an Australian poet, his frequent referencing of Australian landscapes signposting his journey to identify as an Australian, as well as an Australian poet.\n\nHope and Loss\n\nNot only does Skrzynecki detail the hope for a new future and loss of home common in a migrantâs experience, his poems also cover other common situations of love and loss, such as his emotional poem Leukemia which details the journey of his father as a leukemia patient. This shows belonging and identity in a far different light, not in relation to a country but being identified by your sickness which âowns your nameâ. This explores the common experience where a patient feels defined by their condition and struggles to imagine/remember what life is like as a healthy individual.\n\nMetalanguage, Symbols and Motifs in Old/New World\n\nâ¢ Feliks Skrzyneckiâs garden: due to his strong bond to his Polish roots Feliks arguably never felt a sense of belonging in Australia. Instead we find he creates a sense of belonging by cultivating a home of his own, a garden.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki often uses the natural world such as fish and birds to mirror the migrant journey.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki litters his poems with heirlooms such as watches, hammers and photos, often to illustrate how despite having these possessions Peter frequently finds that he doesnât know the full story of his heritage and his parentâs life. In his rediscovery of the heirlooms we often see his disconnect from his background and his regret of not learning more about it.\n\nâ¢ The use of a colloquial idiom of âkept pace only with the Joneses'' in Feliks Skrzynecki, to reference how his belonging only feels surface deep. However, as they are only the Joneses of âhis own mindâs makingâ it also showcases his commitment to not simply copy and to still be individual.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki often uses places of transit such as train stations or hostels to showcase the uncertainty often experienced in a migrantâs journey.\n\nQuick Tips\n\nResearch the places referenced in Skrzynecki poems such as Mt Warning\n\nLearn to spell the authors last name\n\nDonât just analyse the poems individually, try and see the big picture and apply the overarching themes\n\nFor a more detailed guide on how to ACE VCE Text Response, I think youâd love the free sample of our top-rated eBook, How To Write A Killer Text Response!

For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFilm is art. And, art serves as a mirror that is a reflection of us as a society. Thus, a major function of art is to show society as it truly is - even if the image itself is unflattering.Â\n\nA film dâauteur; Sunset Boulevard portrays Billy Wilderâs (director) unique artistic personality. Through his cinematic choices, variety of individualistic styles and the use of innovative features (which we will be exploring in this blog) it is evident that Wilder exhibits the world of Hollywood in a very different and even ominous light to what was normally showcased in the 1950s.Â\n\nWe will now delve into Wilderâs world of film art and gain an insight into how he viewed the industry of Hollywood through his camera.\n\nâNote: There will be some sophisticated vocabulary used throughout the blog, so please refer to the glossary (at the end) or the bracketed definitions for the meanings of words that are bolded.\n\nThe Golden Era of Cinema\n\nThe 1950s Pax Americana social zeitgeist revealed an era in film where any social criticisms of the time were hidden behind the red velvet curtains and silver screens of Hollywood. In this post-war society, disillusionment was very much present within the American psyche. The dawn of the Cold War saw the rise of looming atomic threats, class wars, McCarthyism, spies and infiltrations burgeoning public fears and social paranoia.\n\nThus, cinema itself became a form of escapism from the bleak and depressing real world; crafting an illusion of reality where the line between the American dream and reality was deviously blurred.\n\nYet even such a glamorous industry could not conceal the moral ambiguities of the era. To what was originally a light-hearted comedy film, this cynical film noir is a Hollywood-on-Hollywood story that is far from an entertaining vaudeville act for the masses. Through the wide range of cinematic auteurist techniques that Billy Wilder utilises within the film, he portrays a dark edge to the folie de grandeur of Hollywood and its illusions.\n\nHence, while itâs essential that you use standard techniques like camerawork and editing (as it is a motion picture), it would further elevate your analysis if you interspersed a diverse range of cinematic features into your essay including features like sound, costuming, colour/spatial composition and broader themes which relate to the social context of that time. This is because it is important to notice that everything the director uses in the film is there for a reason.\n\nIf you would like to see more on camerawork and editing, you can refer to our Analysis of Film Techniques in Sunset Boulevard blog post.Â\n\nFilm Noir & German Expressionism\n\nThe Golden Age of Hollywood was a time when synchronous sounds and colour films were commonplace.Â\n\nSo, why did Wilder use black and white colour composition?\n\nPerhaps it was to pay homage to the previous era of silent film or it was just another mordant elegy to those decades. Either way, the truth lies within film noir.\n\nFilm noir (French for âDark filmâ) is a style of film with dark and pessimistic/cynical moods evoked through visual compositing using chiaroscuro (low-key lighting). It is perhaps one of the most important cinematic features used in Sunset Boulevard as it conveys an emotion and atmosphere within the film which cannot be done through scripted words or actions.Â\n\nThrough the restrictions of the Hays Code (a set of guidelines censoring what could be shown on screen), film producers were unable to easily question the moral codes and regulations of society. However, by using film noir, Wilder was subtly able to employ innuendos, double entendres and wit to satirise the dark underbelly of Hollywood and the underlying obsession with stardom exhibitionism and fame.\n\nWhile the burlesque American musicals and Western comedies reflected an illusionary reality for movie audiences of that time, the convoluted storylines/plots of film noir mysteries and thrillers reflected the complexities and hidden moral intransigence of society. More importantly, the characters arenât the ones who resolve the mystery but instead the audiences themselves.\n\nCommon Features of Film Noir Incorporated Within Sunset Boulevard:\n\nAnti-hero protagonists: characters who lack a moral centre and turn to corruption, like Joe Gillis who embodies a bitter, hard-boiled and cynical character who has deep flaws. Although he is confronted with the fact that the pursuit of the Hollywood dream is neverending, when he ends up at Normaâs garage he gives into her fantasies and forms his own tragedy.\n\nFemme-fatale: âdeadly womanâ who is manipulative using her femininity and sexual allure for her own goals. Norma Desmond upholds this sort of archetype as she entraps Joe Gillis as her editor for her Salome script, so she can make her âcomebackâ.\n\nLocation: Usually shot in New York or Los Angeles (like this film), revealing a city with a glamorous facade and a gritty underworld of lush morbidity and moral ambiguities.\n\nLighting: Stark/harsh while creating effective shadows which usually shroud the characters. Dark shadows and chiaroscuro lighting within Normaâs mansion emphasise her haunted nature as she is stuck in the dark of the past, unable to see the light of the outside world.\n\nNarration: Has a pessimistic and cynical undertone. The third-person omnipresent narration is from the ghost of Joe Gillis himself; witnessing his own murder, calling the dead man a âpoor dopeâ when in hindsight it is his past self whom he critiques.\n\nColour: The use of a monochromatic colour scheme (black and white) is the main idea of film noir, eliciting a feeling of the past.\n\nUse of flashbacks: At the beginning of this circular narrative, we are confronted with the present (which actually is the denouement - the murder); however, through the flashback in Joeâs perspective, we start from the beginning (the past) and travel through time to the present. The past and the present become one.\n\nGerman Expressionism (containing Gothic themes) is used in tandem with film noir. Originating in the late 1940s, the depressing aftermath of a post-WWII society had left a pervading sense of doom and dejection, striking a chord with those disillusioned throughout Europe. As a nod to the genre of Gothic Horror, Expressionism draws upon elements and symbolisms prevalent within horror stories such as Dracula.\n\nAs seen in Sunset Boulevard, Norma lives in a dilapidated mansion that mimics an archetypal haunted mausoleum; depicting her as a character from a horror story.Â\n\nLong shadows stretch eerily throughout vast dark hallways.Â\n\nA tall windy staircase, symbolic of the time portal she is stuck in.Â\n\nCurtains always almost fully drawn.Â\n\nâNoÌsferatu-like candelabras swaying in the dim light.Â\n\nA funeral for a dead monkey corpse.Â\n\nSuch filmic elements all add to the personality of Normaâs character - as an arch-ghost of the story from the buried past.\n\nWhile not every aspect of film noir and Expressionism will be relevant when you are writing for your given essay topic, it is important to try to occasionally refer to them wherever you can in your writing just like the example below:\n\nâThere is a dissonant tension in the mansion, referred to as the âgrim Sunset mansionâ; it works as a metaphor to the fatalistic and tragic meaning of Hollywoodâs own dangerous veneer which forever traps victims within their glorious âheydaysâ after rejecting them into its gutter. The Expressionist horror accompaniment of chiaroscuro in tandem with the mise-en-scene of the âghost of a tennis courtâ and an empty swimming pool, all shadow the haunting âparalysisâ of Normaâs own faded dreams. ââWhile obliviously sitting enclosed by her shrine of photographs, âcrowded with Norma Desmonds', Norma eventually becomes a prisoner of a carefully curated exhibit that Hollywood had set up, as she is seen signing headshots for fans, and eerily impersonating the performers of a bygone Hollywood.\n\nSound & Music in Sunset Boulevard\n\nSound and music in film create a specific atmosphere and mood which can sometimes be unattainable in the visuals of a black-and-white film like Sunset Boulevard. Thus, sound and music both play a vital role in the film by heightening mood and emotional responses from characters, foreshadowing narrative developments and placing emphasis and attention on certain actions and events.\n\nFranz Waxmanâs (Sunset Boulevardâs musical producer) music score morphs together variations of musical cues, composition styles and repetitive thematic notes. He stated that he had to enter and understand the charactersâ minds to write their music.Â\n\nââFilm music is heard only onceânot many times as concert music is. [â¦] It should have simplicity and directness. It must make its point immediately and strongly. The emotional impact must come all at once.â - Waxman\n\nHence, Waxman constructed leitmotifs as a representation of the main characters and the time in which they live. Below are some examples of the musical leitmotifs he uses:\n\nNormaâs theme - she receives a classical 1920s off-kilter tango during her dancing scene where she is stuck in the past dwelling on her heydays when she met Rudolph Valentino at parties. However, her musical motif mostly represents her declining state of mind emoted by solo alto flute mysterioso and low and pulsating string notes.\n\nJoeâs theme is characterised by bebop, (jazz-style music for the 1950s urbanite youth) conveying his nonchalant and breezy attitude with prominent saxophonic tunes.\n\nLove theme between Betty and Joe - being played as the pair are working away on their own script in a deserted studio and when they take a stroll through the studio backlot; the music accompaniment is a tender and lyrical string line, with a muted solo trumpet.\n\nFrom the onset of the film, the large orchestral brass-led sound gradually becomes the central theme of the film as it dramatises the initial rush of the homicide squad and newspapermen.\n\nBelow is an example of how you might talk about how the music aids the tensions of the scene:\n\nâWaxmanâs melodramatic and foreboding minor score establishes a sense of impending peril, while the allargando (broadening) of the brass sections heightens the initial tensions of the film. The underlying vibrato of the strings is unnerving and uncomfortable, as it acts in coalescence with the diegetic sound of the blaring sirens which echoes an eerie and unsettling tone.\n\nâNote: Waxmanâs music score is a non-diegetic sound (coming from outside of the film world), while the sirens blaring is a diegetic sound (coming from within the world of the movie).\n\nThere is a range of diegetic sound that comes from within the world of the film that you may hear as you are watching the movie. For example:\n\nJoeâs typewriter when we witness the serpentine glide of the camera into his exposed room\n\nThe camera flashes in the opening scene and the loud and abrupt car noises from the car chase scene\n\nThe telephone ringing as Max calls Joe at the party\n\nThe band playing tango music during Norma and Joeâs dancing scene\n\nFurthermore, musical repetition is also very common within the film as some themes are repeated but transformed or altered musically to convey a contrasting mood. For example, in the scene where Joe tries to flee from Norma but Norma eventually murders him; the music being played is a tortured, slow-motion version of the opening car chase theme. Hence, the musical repetition of Joeâs opening car chase theme signifies how it foreshadows the tragic ending that he faces as he continues to chase the unattainable dream of Hollywood.\n\nAnother example is when Norma prepares for her ending close-up and she descends the staircase into a complete state of megalomania - the music shares the harmony of the tango theme but is transformed into a distorted parody. Through the bombardment of notes, alternation of tremolos (reiteration of notes) and the use of dramatic chromaticism (interspersing of obscure chords) it represents the dramatic changes in emotion and the deterioration of Normaâs mental sanity in the finale.\n\nCostuming & Appearance in Sunset Boulevard\n\nIn contrast to a multicoloured film which can showcase a variety of decorative aspects within the setting and characters, creating a black-and-white film has its drawbacks. Especially with a vibrant and overly-decorous character like Norma Desmond, the production cast needed to go the extra mile with costuming to provide a clear visual portrayal of different moods, impressions, influences and the backgrounds of characters.Â\n\nEdith Headâs (Sunset Boulevardâs costume designer) costuming in the film plays an integral part in building characterisation and forming a clear contrast between the character personas.\n\nââFor black and white picture you must have more of everythingâ - Head\n\nIf we take a look at Norma Desmondâs clothing, hers reflects the Byzantine indulgences of the silent era. The garish avalanche of accessories, oversized jewellery and the prominence of fur and peacock feathers are typical of silent era glamour. It also aligns with the gaudy decorations and art nouveau of the interior of her mansion, representative of her conspicuous wealth.\n\nNorma also embodies a vampiric character which Head portrays through Normaâs hair concealed under a turban; her large, dark glasses; her dark, silk clothing and her long, looser silhouette gowns (emblematic of the antiquity of the 1920s). Normaâs showy indulgence in her decorative wealth and clothing is not only emblematic of her persona but is also portrayed through her over-dramatised theatrical gesticulations which accompany and further give insight to her deranged state.\n\nThe recurring motif of the leopard print (on her turban, her gowns and on her automobile), becomes significant, as Head purposefully uses this print to symbolise Normaâs predatory nature - Norma entraps and uses others like puppets for her selfish motives. The leopard print is portrayed mainly when she is with Joe, representing the way she has him like a âmonkey dancing for [her] penniesâ.Â\n\nOn the other hand, Betty completely contrasts in her appearance and her attire. Her simple wardrobe consists mainly of dull suits, coats and skirts. With clothing that is less garish and having higher, modest necklines with neat, simple makeup and hair and with very little jewellery or fabric embellishments, Head not only portrays Bettyâs young age but also her modesty and innocence.\n\nJoeâs wardrobe deliberately changes throughout the film. Early on in the film, he is seen jobless, trying to make ends meet, wearing a flimsy, ill-fitting jacket and baggy trousers seemingly cut from an early bolt of polyester. After meeting, Norma complains about Joeâs style and takes him on a shopping spree to the best tailor in Hollywood, loading him up with well-tailored suits, six dozen shirts and a masculine (vicuna) overcoat that emphasises his build. He is also accessorised with custom-made shoes, cufflinks, watches, a gold cigarette case and a platinum key chain. While Joeâs fancy wardrobe symbolises new wealth, itâs not his own, but Normaâs. His monetary dependence on Norma leaves him helpless and humiliated when the salesman at the tailor insultingly adds âas long as the ladyâs paying for itâ. With the continual allusions to menâs clothing rather than womenâs throughout the film, Joe becomes the one objectified as an object of Normaâs ownership. The contrast between Joe and Normaâs wardrobes shows the clear power imbalance between them, and thus, an overturn in gender norms.\n\nThe Legacy of an Eerily Timeless Film\n\nWithin the industry of Hollywood - whether in front of or behind the cameras - writers, producers, agents and stars (new and former) collectively are all victims of an exploitative and ruthless industry running on schadenfreude (thriving on individuals' misfortune).Â\n\nWhether itâs Bettyâs tale of rejection, Joeâs âlackâ of writing talent or Normaâs long-forgotten time of fame, Sunset Boulevard unveils the perils of unbridled star adulation, the pursuit of fame and celebrity culture.\n\nWhilst adopting auteurist principles, director Wilder paints a truthful and grotesque self-portrait of Hollywoodâs true face, highlighting the ephemeral nature of an industryâs sickening star system; one that creates and exults stars and just as quickly forgets them.Â\n\nThrough this seminal cautionary tale, Wilder seeks to confront a timeless audience with the intoxicating culture of the screens which has become a common reality nowadays and saturates many of modern-day social spheres.\n\nâSunset Boulevard ultimately poses a warning to the audience of a much wider cultural disturbance of Hollywoodâs addiction to the vanity of celebrity fame, excessive media consumption and the obsession of âneeding to be seenâ - a warning which reverberates louder than ever within modern society today.\n\nGlossary\n\nArch-ghost: main ghost-like character (like in a horror film).\n\nâAuteurist: (used for film directors) having a distinctive artistic style in their films.\n\nâBurgeoning: starting to increase or grow (rapidly).\n\nâByzantine: clothing and accessories that are richly patterned and coloured, yet conservative originating from olden-day Istanbul.\n\nâChiaroscuro: low-key lighting which produces an effect that contrasts light and shadow in black-and-white films.\n\nâDenouement: the finale/ending of the story arc, where conflicts and matters are revealed and resolved.\n\nâElegy: a poem that mourns the loss of something (the loss of the silent era in this case).\n\nâFilm Dâauteur: a film that reflects the artistic personality of the film director/screenwriter.\n\nâFoile de grandeur: delusions of grandeur.\n\nâIntransigence: refusal to change oneâs views and agree on a different reality.\n\nâLeitmotifs: A recurrent theme/motif throughout a musical/literary composition.\n\nâMegalomania: extreme state of delusional obsession with grandeur and of oneself.\n\nâNoÌsferatu-like: (Dracula-like), synonymous with vampire.\n\nâPax Americana social zeitgeist: the state of national prosperity in American Society after WWII.\n\nâRedolence: strongly emblematic or nostalgic.\n\nâSolo alto flute mysterioso: Solo flute played in a lower key that is guided to be played to evoke a mysterious mood.\n\nâSynchronous sounds: Audio coming from the screen that lines up with what is shown on the screen.\n\nâUrbanite: someone who dwells/lives in the city or enjoys an urban city lifestyle.\n\nâVaudeville: light musicals or entertainment acts popular in the 1900s, usually serving only a comedic or entertaining purpose.\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nIntroduction to Animal Farm:\n\n- Written in 1945 by George Orwell, Animal Farm is an allegorical novella about the 1917 Russian Revolution and the repressive Stalinist period which followed.\n\n- As a democratic socialist, Orwell was an adamant critic of Joseph Stalin and his totalitarian dictatorship over Russia. Â\n\n- Thus, Orwell wrote Animal Farm as a satirical fable against Stalinâs tyrannical control, stating that he wrote it with the intention of âfusing political purpose and artistic purpose into one wholeâ.\n\nSetting:\n\n- The novella is set in Manor Farm, located in Willingdon, England at an undisclosed time.\n\n- As the events of Animal Farm symbolise the power struggle of early 20th century Russia, this ambiguity of time is intended to prevent Orwellâs warning against repressive tyranny from becoming dated.\n\n- Orwellâs use of a farm as the main setting is also notable, as farms represent nations in Animal Farm; both require a vast amount of work in order to function properly. Thus, the act of the animals cooperating to cast the humans out of the farm symbolises a workersâ revolution against their oppressive leadership.\n\nMain Character Analysis:\n\nNapoleon (pig):\n\n- Based on Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, he emerges as the leader of the Farm after the Rebellion.\n\n- He consolidates his control over the farm with the violent force of his nine attack dogs, having raised them as puppies; these directly symbolise Stalinâs military force.\n\n- He never contributes to other animalsâ efforts at revolution, as he is only a corrupt individual who seeks to take advantage of opportunities created for him by others.\n\nSnowball (pig):\n\n- Based on Soviet rebel Leon Trotsky, he challenges Napoleon for control of the Farm after he takes control of the leadership.\n\n- Similar to the leader he is modelled after, Snowball is eloquent, charismatic, intelligent and persuasive - thus, he wins the loyalty and support of other animals easily.\n\nBoxer (cart-horse):\n\n- Extremely devoted to the farm and the Rebellion, Boxer symbolises what Orwell believed to be the best qualities of the proletariat, or the exploited working class, such as loyalty, strength, camaraderie and hard work, perceivable by his personal motto of âI will work harderâ.\n\n- However, he simultaneously suffers from typical weakness of the working class, such as a naive trust in the intelligentsia and a slow-witted oblivion to political corruption, represented by his other motto of âNapoleon is always rightâ.\n\nSquealer (pig):\n\n- Manipulative and highly persuasive, he spreads Napoleonâs propaganda throughout the farm to intimidate uneducated animals into supporting Napoleonâs ideas and policies.\n\n- Orwell uses the character of Squealer to warn against politiciansâ deliberate manipulation of mass media in order to gain social and political control.\n\nOld Major (boar):\n\n- Based on the socialist revolutionary Karl Marx, as well as Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin, Old Majorâs dream of a socialist utopia acts as a major motive for the Rebellion.\n\n- Majorâs death creates a political vacuum in the farm, leaving Napoleon and Snowball in a power struggle for control of his followers.\n\nThemes and Motifs:\n\nTyranny:\n\n- By allegorising in Napoleon dictator Joseph Stalin, Animal Farm is first and foremost a satirical critique of politiciansâ tyrannical misuse of power.\n\n- This is epitomised by the deceitful methods Napoleon uses to gain support, such as lying to the other animals that Snowball is a political traitor in order to banish him from the Farm.\n\nNaive Proletariat:\n\n- Animal Farm explores the need for the working class to be educated, as the inability of the farm animals to question Napoleonâs authority directly leads to the perpetuation of his oppression.\n\n- Thus, Orwell presents to his readership that the working class may suffer not only due to dictatorsâ abuse of power, but also from their own naive unwillingness to question the intentions of the authority.\n\nFalse Allegiance:\n\n- Orwell accurately exhibits treacherous aspects of the human condition in his portrayal of dramatised relationships between humans and animals.\n\n- Just as the pig rulers of the rebellion eventually betray their own idealistic visions, the theme of alliance is shattered between Frederick and Napoleon when the latter learns that the former has been forging banknotes while buying firewood from him.\n\n- Thus, Animal Farm depicts the idea that alliances formed in a tyrannical dictatorship are merely veneers of camaraderie, which hide each personâs capability to destroy others in their path towards control.\n\nAnalysis of Quotes:\n\nâFour legs good, two legs bad.â\n\n- From Chapter 3, this slogan is based off of Old Majorâs speech before his death about the need for animals to unite in the face of human oppression and tyranny.\n\n- The quote is a noteworthy example of propaganda in Animal Farm, as the leaders utilise language in order to essentially brainwash the working class animals.\n\n- Although it initially helps the animals to remember their goals, the phrase later loses its meaning of solidarity as it becomes a nonsensical noise made by sheep when used to drown out the voices of challengers to the regime.\n\nâAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.â\n\n- This quote exemplifies the pigsâ abuse of logic and language to keep their power over their followers.\n\n- The evidently senseless and illogical meaning behind this phrase is an example of the methods that the leader of the Farm takes in order to brainwash his followers.\n\n- The quote also suggests that the pigsâ real intention to create an animal utopia is not, in fact, to rise up against the oppression of the humans, but to become part of the elite; the âsomeâ that possess greater rights and power than the rest of the underprivileged society.\n\nâ\n\n5 Types of Essay Prompts\n\nYour approach to each essay will depend on what type of prompt is being asked. Be aware that not all essay prompts are the same, which means that sometimes your preferred essay structure simply wonât suit the type of prompt asked. That's why it's important to be aware of the 5 types of essay topics â what you should watch out for and how you could approach your essay writing. The topics used in this blog post have been curated by Lisa's Study Guides.\n\n1. Theme-based prompts :\n\nAnimal Farm is first and foremost a satirical critique of politiciansâ tyrannical misuse of power.\n\nUsually your paragraphs will be based around particular themes. For example in this case, paragraphs may be based on âloveâ, âescapeâ, âhorrors of warâ etc. These paragraphs can have character discussions embedded within them in order to demonstrate how the characters represent each theme. Discussion of the authorâs choice of language such as symbols or imagery can be essential to the analysis of a theme.\n\n2. Character-based prompts :\n\nBoxer is the only animal with redeeming qualities. Do you agree?\n\nThese prompts focus on one or more characters. In this case, you can structure your essay paragraphs based on particular characters or something in common with a set of characters. Essays can become quite repetitive if each paragraph is based around one character so try to add in discussion about themes or the characterâs relationships with other characters. Remember that minor characters can be just as important as major characters.\n\n3. How-based prompts :Â\n\nHow does Napoleon exert control over the farm?\n\nThese prompts are usually structured, âhow does the character do this,â or 'how does the author do this'. In this case, since the prompt is focused on one main character, try to weave in the main characterâs interactions with other characters and how other characters influenced them.\n\n4. Metalanguage-based prompts :\n\nThe language in Animal Farm is crucial to Orwell's storytelling.\n\nThese types of prompts are the rarest of the 5 prompts but donât be surprised if youâre asked one. They focus more on theÂ languageÂ part of the text; rather than the plot, themes or characters. Your discussion will revolve around the authorâs use of language (metaphors, prose, syntax etc.). These discussions are typically viewed as âharderâ prompts because you need to think about how the author achieves a particular message about character or theme through their choice of words. Check out our blog post onÂ metalanguageÂ and what you need to look out for.\n\nExtra helpful resource by the BBC: Form, structure and language in Animal Farm.\n\nâ\n\n5. Quote prompts :\n\n'All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.â How is this true in Animal Farm?\n\nThese prompts can be character- or theme-based. However, it differs from other essay topics because it includes a direct quote from the text. Remember that the quote is part of the prompt, so ensure that you address it. One of the best ways of doing so is to incorporate the quote into the essay itself.\n\nWhen faced with unknown prompts in a SAC or your exam, it's reassuring to have a formulaic breakdown of the prompt so that your brain immediately starts categorising the prompt - which of the 5 types of prompts does this one in front of me fall into?\n\nTo learn more, I discuss this and offer you practical strategies (so you never mind-blank again!) in my ebook, How To Write A Killer Text Response. Feel free to check it out, and good luck!\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf you, like me, grew up Asian in Australia, you might think you already know a thing or two about, well, growing up Asian in Australia. Our stories can be pretty similarâjust have a scroll through the âsubtle asian traitsâ Facebook group, or have a conversation with literally any Asian Australian about their parents.\n\nAt the same time, itâs also important to recognise that everyoneâs experiences are diverse, especially given how broad an identity âAsianâ can be. Also important is to recognise how broad and intersectional identity can be in generalâintersectional meaning that race isnât the only thing that defines any one of us. Things like gender, socio-economic status, ability, sexual orientation and religion can also be really central, for example. Each of these things can impact the way we navigate the world.\n\nCovering a broad range of these stories is Alice Pungâs anthology, Growing Up Asian In Australia. Some of the contributors in this volume include Sunil Badami, Matt Huynh, Bon-Wai Chou, Diana Nguyen, Michelle and Benjamin Law, and Shaun Tan, and already this cross-section is fairly diverse in nature. You can also click on their names to find out a bit more about each of their work. I think this is worth a few minutes, just to get acquainted with the sheer range of Asian-Australian creatives who are represented in this book, and to locate their work within the themes they write aboutâin other words, having a think about the ways that cultural heritage, or experiences with family, or economic hardship permeate their work, both in the anthology and in their lives outside it.\n\nThe anthology is (perhaps quite helpfully) divided into sections which revolve around key themes, which is also going to inform the structure of this guide. Iâll be using this guide to go through an exercise that I found really helpful when learning the text, which involves:\n\ntaking two stories per section and drawing up some dot-point similarities and differences\n\ntranslating two of those points into paragraphs, a bit like a âmini-essayâ\n\nWeâll go through some an example of what this might look like, and why itâs a helpful exercise to try.\n\nBefore we start diving into Growing Up Asian in Australia, I'd highly recommend checking out LSG's Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nStrine (Badami & Tseng)\n\nStrine is whatâs called a syncope, a shortened way of pronouncing Australian (a bit like âStrayaâ)âit refers to Australian English as itâs spoken by locals. This section of the book is all about language, and about the difficulties of juggling two languages growing up, and Badami and Tsengâs stories are great examples of this.\n\n1. Similarity: connections to oneâs mother tongue fade over time. Tseng recounts how, one by one, she and her sisters stopped learning Chinese as they progressed through their Australian education. Badami on the other hand compromises his name which stood out as too Indian when he âjust wanted to fit in.â\n\n2. Similarity: for âthird-culture kidsâ, losing knowledge of their language also strains their relationship with their forebears. Badamiâs mother is shocked to hear the anglicisation of his name despite the significance it carrie for her (âshe spat my unreal new name out like something bitter and stringyâ), and Tseng describes the experience of communicating with her father in âChinglishâ so that they can both understand each other.\n\n3. Difference: language can be an internalised, personal experience, or a highly exposed and interpersonal one. While Tseng feels her loss of her language as a âsense of shame, a vague uneaseâ, Badami is almost bullied into changing his name, âSunil? Like banana peel?â\n\nThe Clan (Law & Chau)\n\nThis section delves into the complex ties that hold migrant families together. Chauâs poems are starkly different to Lawâs story, so itâll be interesting to compare how these different narrative forms work to explore those ideas.\n\n1. Similarity: it can take at least one generation for migrant families to dig their roots into their new home. While Lawâs parents are proud tourists at Queensland theme parks, he and his siblings âgroanâ at their comportment. Chauâs poem âThe Firstbornâ traces his ancestry forward until he arrived, âan ABCâ and his son âby amniotic seaâ, both of them born into Australia.\n\n2. Similarity: family dynamics are still traditional and therefore gendered. Law notes how his motherâs health suffered when divorcing his father, and Chau notes that the women members of his family were âcast offâ the family tree âas if they were never born.\n\n3. Difference: family history and heritage can vary in importance. Chauâs family traces back âtwenty-eight generationsâ of history, whereas Lawâs family very much lives in the present, the only tie to older generations being his âMa-Maâ, or grandma.\n\n4. Difference: families show their love in different ways. Whether itâs dedicating a poem to his son about his life as one of âten thousand riversâ of Chinese diaspora into the Australian sea, or taking the kids to theme parks on weekends, all sorts of affection can hold families together.\n\nPutting it together\n\nSo Iâve tried to choose two sections (and four stories) that are all a bit different to try and mix it up and get some rich comparative discussion out of these. You might be studying this text alone, but even as one text, remember that thereâs a lot of diverse experiences being represented in it, so discussing how stories connect, compare and contrast is just as important as discussing the content of individual stories themselves.\n\nIf we do a mini-essay, we might as well go about it properly and pick some sort of contention. Without a fixed prompt though, it might be easier to start with those dot points and pick which ones we want to write out and string together. Letâs pick twoâconnections to mother tongue fading over time (Strine similarity 1) and digging roots into Australia over time (The Clan similarity 1). A contention covering these points might look like:\n\nWhile second generation migrants may struggle with loss of culture, they also constitute a unique and significant part of the diaspora.\n\nAn example\n\nMany migrants lose connections to their heritage over time, and these connections are often in the form of language. Particularly for Asian migrants, there is not as strong a need to preserve their mother tongue in the English-speaking Australia, and as such their knowledge of those languages can be easily lost. Ivy Tseng, for instance, recalls how she was never able to âgrasp the significanceâ of learning Chinese as a child, and eventually she and her sisters would prioritise âstudyâ and other academic pursuits over learning Chinese. Because tertiary study and education as an institution generally carry a lot of weight in migrant cultures, there is often a compromise made at the expense of heritage and language. These compromises can come from other factors as well, particularly the group dynamics of being in white-dominated Australia. Bullying is a frequent culprit, and Badami for example is indeed peer-pressured into resentingâand ultimately anglicisingâhis name, âSunil? Like banana peel?â More generally speaking, a sense of shame for oneâs difference is a common part of the migrant experienceâLaw experiences it as well at theme parks, where he and his siblings attempt to âset [them]selves apartâ from the faux-pas of their parents. Not always an intentional goal, but a general willingness to compromise connections to heritage underscores many Asian Australian migrant stories, particularly of second-generation migrants.\n\nHowever, the extent to which migrants feel socially integrated in society shifts generationally and over time as well. Second generation migrants are thus unique in that they have the closest connection to their heritage while also initiating this process of integration. Law and his siblings exemplify this, with their âAustralian accentsâ and âproper grammar and syntax.â While some loss of their native Cantonese takes place, they are also the first in their family to sound Australian, one step closer to being Australian. They constitute part of the distinct, third culture of âABCââAustralian-born Chineseâto which Chau alludes in his poem, âThe Firstbornâ. Distinct from first-generation migrants, ABCs are a product of diaspora and spend their formative years immersed in the Australian way of life. Chauâs poem goes on to highlight how sizeable this demographic now isââthe sea is awash with the unfathomable Chinese sons.â Thus, we can see how ABCs, or second generation Asian migrants, represent a unique and significant social group exemplified by great compromise, but also great change.\n\nWhy is this useful?/How can I apply this?\n\nI like this exercise because it gets you thinking creatively about the key implications of the stories. Within a section or theme, you want to identify similarities in how both stories contribute to our understanding of that theme. You also want to identify differences to explore how stories can be unique and nuanced, which will provide your essay with more depth when you ultimately need it. Then, putting it all together helps you synthesise new connections between themes.\n\nFor an analytical study of this text, youâd flesh out those ideas until they become paragraphs, introducing relevant evidence and mixing it up with explanatory sentences as you go. Explanatory sentences keep you analysing rather than story-telling, and they usually donât have any quotesâan example from above might be âbecause tertiary study and education as an institution generally carry a lot of weight in migrant cultures, there is often a compromise made at the expense of heritage and language.â\n\nFor a creative study, youâd take away those ideas and look at how else you might explore them in other stories. Feel free to challenge yourself for this; I remember falling back on more personal writing when studying this creatively, but donât neglect other genres or forms! If second generation migrants are in fact more on their way to belonging, write a speculative story about how an apocalypse tests those connections to white Australians. I dunno, but donât be afraid to really push the boundaries here and test the implications you draw from the stories.\n\nGive it a go\n\nTry it for some of these:\n\nUnAustralian? (Loewald & Law) and Leaving Home (Diana Nguyen & Paul Nguyen)\n\nBattlers (Dac & Law/Huynh) and Mates (Phommavanh & Ahmed)\n\nThe Folks (Lazaroo & Tran) and Homecoming (Beeby & Larkin)\n\nGrowing Up Asian in Australia Essay Prompt Breakdown\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nThe essay topic weâll be looking at today is short and sweet;\n\nTo belong is to sacrifice. Discuss.Â\n\nThe key terms are evidently âto belongâ and âto sacrificeâ, so these are the words and definitions that weâll have to interrogate.Â\n\nBelonging is a feeling of being accepted by someone or being a member of something, so weâd have to ask who is doing the accepting, and what are the writers seeking to be members of. On the other hand, sacrifice is loss, itâs giving something upâitâs implied that seeking belonging means you may have to navigate compromises to what you have, how you live, or maybe, who you are. Have a think about what sacrifices are made by whom, and why.\n\nWith that in mind, letâs brainstorm a contention. We usually want to avoid going fully agree or fully disagree to create a bit more âgritâ for the essayâand in this case, the prompt is pretty deterministic or absolute; itâs saying that belonging is all about sacrifice.Â\n\nIâd probably argue that belonging is sometimes about sacrifice, and for migrant children they often give up some of their culture or heritage for Western lifestyle or values. That being said, belonging in these cases is probably more about synthesis than sacrificeâitâs about being able to negotiate and bring heritage into increasingly Australian ways of life.\n\nThe brainstorming section of writing a killer essay is where my THINK and EXECUTE strategy comes in. If you havenât heard of it before, essentially, itâs a method of essay writing that emphasises the importance of really thinking about all aspects of a prompt and exploring all the different avenues you can go down. To be able to EXECUTE a well-reasoned, coherent and articulate essay that contains enough nitty-gritty analysis, you have to do enough THINKing to get some meat on the essayâs skeleton, so to speak. To learn more, check out my top selling eBook, How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nIn paragraphs, we could start by looking at some of the sacrifices people make in order to belong. The poem, âBe Good, Little Migrantsâ has a more of a cynical take on this, suggesting that migrant groups are expected to sacrifice economic mobility and even personal dignity in order to gain favour with locals: âgive us your faithful serviceâ, âdisplay your gratitude but donât be heard, donât be seen.âÂ\n\nEconomic sacrifices are seen across many stories, from the working class âdecent enough incomeâ in âFamily Lifeâ to the failing business in âABC Supermarketâ. Other forms of sacrifice might be less materialâfor example Benjamin Lawâs sacrifice of his Mariah Carey cassettes in an attempt to fit in at school from the story âTowards Manhoodâ. This example is interesting because it isnât a cultural sacrifice, but a gendered oneâitâs a good reminder that identity is always multi-layered.Â\n\nFor migrant children though, the sacrifices usually revolve around their race and culture. Diana Nguyen for example notes language as a key sacrifice: she quits Vietnamese school because she didnât feel like she belonged with the grade ones in her class, and her ultimate âlack of interest in learning [Vietnamese] created a lasting barrierâ between her mother and her. In Sunil Badamiâs story, âSticks and Stones and Such-Likeâ, the sacrifice is his name, as he Anglicises it to Neil. When his mother finds out, âshe spat my unreal new name out like something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow.â The common denominator here is that Asians growing up in Australia often have to navigate sacrificing some of their heritage in order to belong in western society.Â\n\nHowever, the challenges faced by the Asian diaspora growing up abroad are more complex and more nuanced than just sacrifice. More often than not, theyâre required to synthesise a âthird cultureâ identity that balances their heritage with western values and lifestyles.Â\n\nDiana Nguyen goes on to discuss her career trajectory in becoming a âworking actorâ in Melbourneâs entertainment industry, carving out a path for herself in spite of her parentsâ disapproval, and going on to represent a new generation of Asian Australians in the media. The story âWei-Lei and Meâ also points to this shifting demographic in Australia, as Gouvernel and her best friend stave off a racist primary school bully only to see their home change for the better as they grew up, with new restaurants from their home cuisines opening up. At the same time, they âhad become what [they] thought [they] could never be: Australian,â describing a way of life in Canberra that is unmistakably Australian.Â\n\nSo, belonging isnât necessarily all about sacrificeâit doesnât mean you canât pursue your passions or become âAustralianâ. Sure, sometimes sacrifice is necessary, but âthird culture kidsâ synthesise conflicting identities in order to belong.Â\n\nHaving arrived at the contention, letâs just have another think about the takeaway message - being able to bring other themes into an essay topic that only really raises one theme. To answer this topic fully, a good essay wouldnât just discuss belonging and sacrifice, but it would also bring in discussion about family, friends, careers and cultures, just to name a few. Hopefully this is something you can translate into your own future work!\n\nConclusion\n\nGrowing Up Asian In Australia is an anthology with a lot to unpack, but there are plenty of unique stories with plenty of interesting links to be made. However youâre learning this text, being able to draw conclusions from stories and extrapolate them into your writing is a really important skill.\n\nAs you go, ask yourself about the implications: âso what?â and âwhy?â. These sorts of questions will help you get richer insights and write about the anthology in a more interesting way.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany lawyers today would cite this 60-year-old story as an inspirationâHarper Leeâs To Kill A Mockingbird is, at its core, the tale of one attorneyâs quest against racial injustice in his Deep South home, and of his children coming of age in the shadow of their father.\n\nThe novel is narrated in two parts by his younger child, Scout, and along with her brother Jem and their friend Dill, she traces their upbringing as inspired by Atticusâ moral teachings of tolerance, courage and justice. The first part follows their childhood, and their interactions with characters such as Boo Radley, Walter Cunningham, Miss Caroline and Mrs Dubose, while the second part follows the Tom Robinson trial itself, testing the children on the moral lessons of their childhood and disillusioning them to the overwhelming racism of their community.\n\nWeâll be going through the novelâs major themes, and also looking at it a bit more critically within the historical context of civil rights and racial justice struggles.\n\nBefore we dive into To Kill A Mockingbird, I'd highly recommend checking out LSG's Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nPrejudice and Race in To Kill A Mockingbird\n\nAll throughout the novel resonate messages of tolerance over prejudice. However, before any question of race is introduced, the children must confront their prejudices about Boo Radley, a local recluse who was rumoured to have attacked his parents. While they (particularly Jem and Dill) lowkey harass Boo by playing around his yard, re-enacting dramaticised versions of his life, and sending notes into his house with a fishing pole, they undoubtedly get drawn into the rumours as well: he was âsix-and-a-half feet tallâ, he âdined on raw squirrelsâ and he had a head âlike a skullâ.\n\nWhat is prejudice, after all? In this case, it doesnât have to do with race necessarilyâitâs more about how the children judge Boo, form a preconceived image of who he is, before they really know him.\n\nAnd this happens to other white characters tooânotably Walter Cunningham, a boy from a poor family who Aunt Alexandra straight up derides as âtrashâ. Even when invited to dinner by the Finches, he is dismissed by Scout as âjust a Cunninghamâ, and this is where Calpurnia steps in as the moral voice, chastising her for acting âhigh and mightyâ over this boy who she hardly knows.\n\nThe racial dimension of prejudice is impossible to ignore thoughâas Atticus says, âpeople have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury boxâ. The word âresentmentâ has special significance here in the context of the Great Depression (in which the novel was setâmore on this in a later section) but the general idea is clear: Black Americans like Tom Robinson were guilty, and therefore doomed, the minute they stepped into a court because the white jury inevitably bore prejudices against them.\n\nAt the end of the day, the panacea Lee presents for prejudice is empathy, the idea that only by truly understanding someone, âclimb[ing] into [their] skin and walk[ing] around in itâ, can we overcome our own prejudicesâsomething that the jury isnât quite able to do by the end of the novel.\n\nJustice in To Kill A Mockingbird\n\nIn the second part of the novel, these moral questions around prejudice and empathy find an arena in the courtroom, where Tom has been unfairly charged with rape and is being defended by Atticus. The court of law is supposed to be this colour-blind, impartial site of dispute resolution, where anybody âought to get a square dealâ, but the reality we see in the novel falls dramatically short; Tom is indeed ultimately found guilty despite the evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe intersection of these themesârace, prejudice and justiceâforces us to confront the reality that our legal institutions may not be as colour-blind and impartial as we thought. As Atticus says in his closing statement, âa court is only as sound as its jury, and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up.â However, what we see is that the people who make up a jury are not necessarily as sound as he/we would hopeâScout later recognises that the true trial occurs in the âsecret courts of men's heartsâ, and that racist biases were always going to get in the way of a fair verdict.\n\nHeroism and Courage in To Kill A Mockingbird\n\nAll of that sounds pretty dire, so is the novel then purely pessimistic? Weâre going to complicate this a little here, and then (spoiler) a little more in the âPast the Basics (II)â section, but letâs say for now that even though the outcome may be cause for pessimism, the novel is not so pessimistic on the whole.\n\nThis is because of one central moral that stands out from all of Atticusâ other teachings, and that strings the entire story together, namely the idea that courage doesnât have any one single shape or form, that anybody can be courageous.\n\nIn Part One, we find an unlikely hero in Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose, who the children describe as âplain hellââwhen Jem takes out her flowers, Atticus makes him read to her as punishment. Only when she dies is it revealed that she was a morphine addict who had been trying to cut the habit in her last days, which Atticus sees as extremely brave: â[Real courage is] when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.â For all we know, this couldâve been about himselfâ¦\n\nAnother example of Atticus switching up what it means to be heroic is in the way he puts down Tim Johnson. Donât stress if you forgot who that isâTim is the rabid dog. Jem is blown away by his fatherâs marksmanship, which he had never actually witnessed. Atticus transforms this into yet another lesson about courage: \"I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand.\"\n\nWhat we see here is Lee trying to broaden the readerâs imagination of what a hero could be, or what courage could look like, and all of this momentum eventually builds to the trial in Part Two. Even Tim Johnsonâs name calls to mind parallels with Tom Robinsonâs legal battle, in which Atticus heroically takes up the huge responsibility of protecting the innocent, and in spite of his best efforts, both times he fails.\n\nYet maybe both times he knew it would be inevitableâcourage is âknow[ing] youâre licked before you beginâ, right? Â\n\nFatherhood vs Adolescence in To Kill A Mockingbird\n\nThis knowledge seems to be one of those unfortunate things that comes with age and life experience. While Atticus already understands this, it doesnât quite click for his children until the end of the novel. Jem is particularly shaken by the guilty verdict: âIt ainât rightâ, he cries.\n\nThe novel is sometimes referred to as a bildungsroman for this reason: at its core, itâs a coming-of-age story. Jem may have been really idealistic about law and justice and the court system, but this is the first time in his life that he has had to grapple with the reality that all these institutions might be flawed, and that his dad is a hero not because he always wins, but because heâs willing to get into the fight even when he knows he might lose. Even though these messages came through all across the novel, Jemâs personal investment in the Robinson trial brings it all together for him.\n\nThus, on the one hand, you have this disillusionment and loss on innocence, but on the other, you also have this shift in worldview that may well be valuable in the long run.\n\nItâs also worth noting that Jem isnât the only character who experiences this thoughâand also that heroism isnât the only theme that is affected. Scout experiences similar disappointments, and they both grapple with other questions of conscience, tolerance and conformity throughout the novel.\n\nPast the basics: Narrative Structure\n\nIâve hinted to this briefly throughout the themes, but the two-part structure of the novel plays a key role in delivering the key moral messages. While Part One isnât necessarily the story youâd expect (given that itâs very long and almost completely not about the trial itself), many of the characters and their interactions with Jem, Scout and Dill are incredibly meaningful. (Walter Cunningham and Mrs. Dubose are covered above, but try to form some of these connections yourself).\n\nBoo Radley is the key character who connects the two parts of the story. He spends much of the first part in hiding, occasionally leaving gifts for the kids in a tree (chapter 7), or giving them a blanket during a fire (chapter 8). However, heâs also victim to their prejudice and their gossipâthey donât see him as a person, but rather as an enigma whom they can harass and talk about at will. In the second part however, he emerges to save Jem from Bob Ewell and is actually a rather unassuming man. Here, Scout and Jem must reckon with the moral lessons theyâve been taught about prejudice, but also about innocence and courage. Itâs through these interactions as well that they come closer to understanding Atticus, and his brave quest to defend the innocent. In many ways, the first part of the novel sets up and drives these ideas home.\n\nPast the basics: Critical Racial Analysis\n\nAs foreshadowed, weâre going to complicate the heroism element of the novel here, and Iâll start with a quote from a New York Times review: âI donât need to read about a young white girl understanding the perniciousness of racism to actually understand the perniciousness of racism. I have ample firsthand experience.â\n\nSo is there an issue when a story of Black injustice only elevates white people as heroes? Not to say that Atticus canât be heroic, but what does it say that heâs the brave, stoic hero in a story about a Black manâs unjust suffering?\n\nI think to best understand these complexities, itâs worth situating the story in its historical context.\n\n1930s: Great Depression; when the novel is set. Economy had collapsed and masses were unemployed; with slavery abolished, Black people were competing with white people for labour, fuelling resentment. Harper Lee grew up in this time, so there are autobiographical elements to the novel.\n\n1960s: Civil Rights Movement; when the novel is published. For the first time in history, Black heroes were capturing national white attention and shifting the needle drastically towards racial justice. It was in this watershed wave of activism and social change that people read this book for the first time, and it was received as a deeply authentic voice within this movement.\n\n2010s: Present day; when the novel is currently being read. Weâre closer towards achieving racial justice now, but weâre also in a world where more and more young people are cognisant of these issues. While the novelâs image on the surface (of white kids being blown away by the existence of racism) is fading in relevance, there are underlying messages that are still relevant: racism and prejudice is inevitable, and can occur across and within racial lines; courage and heroism can take many forms (consider how Black charactersâsuch as Calpurniaâalso act in heroic ways); and the experiences of young people, whether experiencing racism firsthand or witnessing its divisive impact, undoubtedly shape their values and morals as they enter the adult world.\n\nIf the same story was published today, it probably wouldnât have the same impact, but think about what kinds of messages endure anyway, beneath the surface story.\n\nEssay Prompt Breakdown\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird argues that empathy is courageous. Discuss.\n\nWhich brings us to a topic that is a bit knottier than it might first seem. Although empathy is shown to be courageous, particularly in the context of its setting, part of the novelâs message is also that courage can be fluid. This means that you might agree for a paragraph or two, emphasising the importance of context, before expanding on this idea of courage in the third.\n\nParagraph One: empathy can be a courageous trait in divisive times. Atticus says from early on that itâs important to âclimb in [someoneâs] skin and walk around in itâ in order to better understand them. He initially says this about Walter Cunningham, but itâs a message that finds relevance all throughoutâwhich occurs in parallel, of course, with his other lessons about courage, and how it can take different forms (as in Mrs. Dubose). Understood together, Lee suggests that empathy can in itself be a form of courage.\n\nParagraph Two: weâve blended two themes together in the previous paragraph, but letâs bring in some context here. Empathy only stands out as being particularly courageous because of the historical milieu, in which people were not only racist, but allowed racist resentments to surface in the economic struggle of the Depression. In fact, these âresentments [were carried] right into a jury boxâ where people failed to display the very courage that Atticus consistently espouses.\n\nParagraph Three: that said, even if empathy is courageous, courage can take on many forms beyond just empathy. Consider Scout backing away from a fight with Cecil Jacobs (âI felt extremely nobleââand rightfully so) or the resilience of the First Purchase congregation in using their service to raise money âto help [Helen Robinson] out at homeâ. That these characters, Black and white, can hold their heads high and do the right thing in difficult times is also courageous.\n\nHave a go\n\nIn your opinion, what is the most central and relevant message from To Kill a Mockingbird?\n\nWhat is the role of innocence in To Kill a Mockingbird?\n\nLee argues that legal institutions are fraught with human biasâis this true?\n\nIn To Kill a Mockingbird, who pays the price for racism, and what do they lose?\n\nChallenge: In To Kill a Mockingbird, how are isolation and loneliness different, and what is Lee suggesting about society in this regard?\n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird Essay Prompt Breakdown Video\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nSomething that I want you to take away from this video is being able to develop a contention statement that is a complete, solid foundation for your essay. A lot of the time when I ask students what theyâre trying to say in a specific section of their essay, they canât really explain it, theyâre just trying to put relevant evidence down. Ideally, itâs worth bearing in mind when you plan that you should be able to follow your logic back to the contention at any given point, even if youâre not that confident with the topic, and even if it wasnât the topic youâre quite prepared for.\n\nThe topic weâll be looking at is:\n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird is a story of courage. Discuss.\n\nSo âcourageâ is the key word here, and the way we define it will shape our entire discussion. It generally means bravery and fearlessness, but what kinds of courage are explored in the novel? It could be anything from courage to do the ârightâ thing, or courage to tell the truth, or courage to treat people with dignity even when you donât know if theyâll treat you the same way.\n\nImmediately, we can see that this is a theme-based prompt. To learn more about LSG's incredible Five Types Technique and how it can revolutionise how you approach VCE Text Response essays, have a read of this blog post.\n\nFor a prompt like this, you start building your contention based on these definitions, and this is handy if youâre better prepared for another theme. Letâs say youâre better prepped to write an essay on discrimination...\n\nYou could contend that the novel is indeed about courage, as Atticus not only teaches it to his children but also applies it to his defence of Tom Robinson in the face of structural racism. However, courage is also linked more broadly to empathy, which is explored as a panacea for discrimination. A complete contention like this breaks up your points neatly, but also grounds everything you have to say in an essay that still addresses the question and the idea of courage.\n\nFor example, paragraph one would start by looking at the forms of courage he teaches to his children. Part One, the more moralistic and didactic section of the novel ends with the idea that âreal courageâ isnât âa man with a gunâ but rather âwhen you know you're licked before you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.â The section is characterised by these lessons of âreal courageââwhile Atticus âOne-Shotâ Finch downplays his marksmanship, he focuses the childrenâs moral instruction on characters such as Mrs Dubose, who he admires as courageous for fighting her morphine addiction.\n\nThe next paragraph would look at Atticusâ actions and also the trial in a bit more detail, as he embodies this idea that real courage exists outside of physical daring. In the racist milieu of the Deep South at the time, juries rarely âdecide in favour of a coloured man over a white man.â Yet, Atticus is determined to defend Tom even at the steep cost of his own personal honour or reputation. Not only does he teach his children about the importance of courage, but he goes on to exemplify those very lessons himself. Courage in this case reflects his commitment to the truth and to defending the innocentââthis boyâs not going till the truth is told.â\n\nHowever, in the final paragraph we might take a bit of a turn. Atticus, in having the courage to see Tom as an equal, is probably reflecting another very important value in the novelânamely, empathy. Though he admires Mrs. Dubose for her âreal courageâ, the white camellia he gives to Jem represents the goodness he sees within her despite her discriminatory attitudes. Though Jem struggles to empathise with the âold devilâ, Atticus posits that it takes a degree of courage to be the bigger person and see the best in others, rather than repeating cycles of discrimination and prejudice. The idea of empathy as a form of courage is also reflected in what he teaches them about Boo Radley. When Scout is terrified by the idea that he had given her a blanket without her realising, she ânearly threw upââyet Atticus maintains the importance of empathising with people, âclimb[ing] into another manâs shoes and walk[ing] around in itâ rather than ostracising them. In other words, he sees empathy as a form of courage in being the first to break social stigmas and overcome the various forms of discrimination that separate us.\n\nNow to touch base again with the take away message. We contended that the novel is about courage because Atticus teaches it to Scout and Jem while also representing it in the trial. We also contended that courage is linked to empathy, another key value that he imparts as it helps to overcome social barriers like discrimination. The aim was to build an essay on a contention that clearly props up the body of the essay itself, even when we were more confident with some other themes, and I think this plan does a pretty good job of covering that.\n\nCharlieâs CountryÂ is an Australian drama film directed by Rolf de Heer, starring David Gulpilil. The linear film, co-written by de Heer and Gulpilil, tells the story of Charlie, a middle-aged Aboriginal man living in the town of Ramingining. The audience follows Charlie as he sets off to reconnect with his Indigenous origins; choosing to abandon urbanised society, Charlie flees into the bush to live by his âMother countryâ. Much to his demise, Charlie subsequently becomes ill and is admitted to hospital in Darwin. After discharging himself from the hospital, Charlie is quickly arrested for assaulting a policeman. Charlie serves time in prison for his crime and the filmâs final scenes show Charlie, free and mentoring young Aboriginal boys in their native cultural traditions. As the audience follows Charlieâs everyday encounters, they gain insight into the harsh realities faced by Aboriginals in modern-day Australia. Through his individual plight for survival amidst illness and poverty, de Heer presents profound political commentaries on this very pertinent social issue, spanning decades in Australian history.\n\nThe film's critical acclaim upon its release in 2013 was the impetus in prompting conversations and debates about the politics of Indigenous Australians. De Heerâs depiction of this remote community grappling with issues as a result of government-imposed law serves to capture the oppression and deeply ingrained racism that continues to persist.\n\nTracksÂ is one Australian womanâs survival narrative. The 1980 autobiographical memoir by Robyn Davidson, recounts her courageous 1700 miles trek across Australia, beginning from Central Australia towards the Indian ocean. In the effort to escape the monotony of her daily life, Davidson travels to her first destination -- Alice Springs -- in 1973 to start preparations. In the 2 years she spends there, she learns how to train camels and live minimally, the former proving to be a challenge. Despite her vehement will to refuse any kind of donation or financial help, Davidson eventually accepts a writing deal in partnership with National Geographic, providing the much-needed funds to confirm her departure. It's through this deal that she meets Rick Smolan, whom under the conditions of her deal has been recruited to photograph this journey - an unsettling compromise for Davidson which she ruminates on frequently in the novel. With her beloved dog Diggity and her camels, Davidson traverses the Australian landscape, discovering more about herself, her country and the people.Â\n\nFundamentally, this book is as much about Davidsonâs internal transformation and personal frontiers as it is about exposing the colonial and masculine ethos that permeates Australian history.\n\nThemes (Similarities and Differences)\n\nAt LSG, we use the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy to help us easily find points of similarity and difference. This is particularly important when it comes to essay writing, because you want to know that you're coming up with unique comparative points (compared to the rest of the Victorian cohort!). I don't discuss this strategy in detail here, but if you're interested, check out my How To Write A Killer Comparative. I use this strategy throughout my discussion of themes here and in a later section, Sample Essay Plan.\n\nIsolation and Alienation\n\nCharlie, drawing on Gulpilil's own experiences, becomes profoundly alienated from his Ramingining community to the extent where he serves no major function in the community life. Charlie is alienated both physically and figuratively, not only does he live in a makeshift hut on the outskirts of town, but he is separated from the Aboriginal community in this town and resents the fact that white Australians have assumed power over his land. He is evidently neglected from the wider society, which causes much of the internal and external conflict he experiences in the film, an ordeal which many within the Indigenous minorities can empathise with.Â\n\nIn his efforts to escape his life within the confines of the intervention, Charlie sees isolation and social rebellion as a mechanism to rediscover his Indigenous roots, spending time in nature to fulfil his journey for self-discover"
