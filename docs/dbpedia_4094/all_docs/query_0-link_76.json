        "text": "“With regard to making Dangerous the 1st lesbian love/crime/action film in India, ever since the honourable Supreme Court repealed section 377, my intention is to give love its due respect, no matter between whom and also to send a message out there that love stories should not be restricted to heterosexuals and can be made in 4 other communities namely LGBT,” says Ram Gopal Varma about the film.\n\nKhatra is billed as the most erotic song ever from RGV’s stable which includes his like Sapne Mein Milti Hai, Rangeela Re and Hai Rama and it does not feature a male hero.\n\nThe maverick filmmaker has also put up Dangerous for sale as a non-fungible token that enables anyone to become a partner or buy the whole property of ‘DANGEROUS’ by investing in Danger Tokens.\n\nDangerous will release in theatres and also on a streaming platform on a pay-per-view model. The revenues generated will be received by all the partners as per their investment ratios.\n\nThis story is provided by ATK. ANI will not be responsible in any way for the content of this article.
