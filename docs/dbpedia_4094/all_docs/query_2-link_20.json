        "text": "Borderlands' road to the big screen hasn't been a smooth one. We first heard about the intention to make a movie not long after the success of the first two games, but the project took a very long time to actually take off. But with the movie finally launching this month, we're about to see whether it was worth the long wait. Here's everything we know about the Borderlands movie.\n\nHelmed by Eli Roth (though some behind-the-scenes rumors question that), the long-in-the-works adaptation of Gearbox's hit video game franchise will take moviegoers to the wild and colorful planet of Pandora, where opportunities to get rich are as abundant as life-threatening situations. The plucky team of heroes spearheading the Guardians of the Galaxy-like space adventure are willing to risk everything for nice loot (and maybe do some good while they're at it).\n\nIf you're in the mood for sci-fi adventures ahead of Borderlands, we highly suggest that you check out (or rewatch) some of the best sci-fi movies and TV shows of all time. And for fans of the series, we’ve also got our list of the Borderlands games ranked worst to best.\n\nAfter a lengthy period in limbo due to reshoots and Lionsgate reshuffling its theatrical release schedule, Borderlands is currently set to be released exclusively in theaters on August 9, 2024, in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of European countries, such as Denmark and France, will be getting it a day or two earlier, but most of the international rollout is planned for the same week. Some exceptions are Philippines and Germany, which won't receive the flick until August 21 and 22 respectively. The release dates for Asian markets like China and Japan haven't been shared yet.\n\nWhat is the plot of Borderlands?\n\nFrom the get-go, as soon as the big-name cast members and their respective roles were announced, fans knew the Borderlands movie wouldn't be doing a straight adaptation of one of the games or adding a new tale to the preexisting canon. Instead, it's remixing several characters, plot elements, and locations from all over the video game saga in an attempt to surprise both die-hard gamers and moviegoers new to the franchise.\n\nThe story follows an older version of Lilith (Cate Blanchett) as she returns to Pandora to find the daughter of business titan Atlas. Of course, things quickly get more complicated and Lilith is forced to team up with several colorful characters: Roland (Kevin Hart), a former mercenary; Tiny Tina (Ariana Greenblatt), a pre-teen who loves explosives a bit too much; Krieg (Florian Munteanu), Tina's giant protector; Tannis (Jamie Lee Curtis), a scientist with too many things in her head; and Claptrap (Jack Black), a robot with a big mouth.\n\nAccording to Jamie Lee Curtis, Tannis has “a connection back to Cate’s early past” in the movie, as she knew her mother. This might suggest flashbacks may be a thing too, especially if most (if not all) of the main characters either live or have lived on Pandora. Meanwhile, supporting characters like Atlas and Commander Knoxx (Janina Gavankar) represent the more spruced-up and civilized side of the Borderlands universe, which is dominated by giant corporations.\n\nDirector Eli Roth also elaborated on the tone the team was gunning for while talking to Entertainment Weekly: “I wanted to make something totally bonkers and bat-s--- crazy, that has the insanity of The Fifth Element or Escape From New York… I think there's a spirit of anarchy and absurdity in the game. I wanted the movie to have that same spirit as well: a movie completely made by lunatics.” Looking at the previews, he might have succeeded at channeling that raw energy, but will that be enough?\n\nBorderlands trailers\n\nThe first official trailer was finally released to the public on Feb. 21, 2024, giving a generous look at the movie's basic plot, distinct group of protagonists, and even some of the baddies making their lives harder. Watch it below:\n\nMore recently, on June 8, the first 'exclusive look' clip was shared online, giving us part of a close-quarters encounter with some bandits and goons looking to probably murder the gun-toting antiheroes. Check it out here:\n\nOn July 11, a special feature focusing on the main cast and presenting some behind-the-scenes footage arrived to kick off the final month-long countdown. You can check it out here:\n\nFinally, ahead of the TV spots that should cap off the marketing campaign, Lionsgate finally released a second and final trailer. It’s a bit on the short side, but definitely looks much sharper than the first one. Watch it below:\n\nBorderlands cast\n\nBorderlands' cast is led by Cate Blanchett (The Lord of the Rings) as Lilith, Kevin Hart (Jumanji sequels) as Roland, Jack Black (The Mandalorian) as Claptrap, Edgar Ramirez (Jungle Cruise) as Atlas, Ariana Greenblatt (Ahsoka) as Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) as Krieg, Gina Gershon (Thanksgiving) as Mad Moxxi, and Jamie Lee Curtis (Knives Out) as Dr. Patricia Tannis.\n\nThey're joined by Olivier Richters (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) as Krom, Janina Gavankar (Star Wars Battlefront II) as Commander Knoxx, Cheyenne Jackson (American Horror Story) as Jakobs, Charles Babaloa (Black Mirror) as Hammerlock, Benjamin Byron Davis (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as Marcus, Steven Boyer (Trial & Error) as Scooter, and Ryann Redmond (Heels) as Ellie, among others.\n\nBorderlands director, writers, and crew\n\nEli Roth (Hostel, Thanksgiving) is credited as director on the movie, with extensive reshoots handled by Tim Miller (Deadpool, Terminator: Dark Fate) to amp up some action sequences. The original script came from Craig Mazin (The Last of Us), with rewrites done by Juel Taylor (Creed II) and Roth himself. Avi Arad (Venom) and Erik Feig (Strays) are producing."
