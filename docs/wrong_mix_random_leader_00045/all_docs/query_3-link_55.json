        "text": "My Fred is grafted on Dr Huey. He grew pretty fast and began blooming right away. The blooms are mostly singles on long stems which make FM a great cut rose, along with his wonderful scent and long life in a vase. FM does grow huge, both wide and tall for me. He's been totally cut back, almost to the ground, twice. Once was because of cold damage and once for rejuvenation. The bloom cycle of my rose is very different from Michael G's. FM is the last rose to bloom in spring in my garden and loves to bloom in fall--he's blooming nicely right now. I wouldn't say he has masses of blooms during the season, but it's quite a healthy number that appear. Fred can be a bit of a \"primo don\" around here. He's prone to chlorosis in our alkaline soil--quite bad sometimes, and his blooms can spot in the rain, which we don't have much of. He's one of just two of my roses that has had some mildew in the past, occurring along with the chlorosis. Still, I love the guy, a great and beautiful rose.
