        "text": "Profession: Provençal Poet\n\nBiography: Frederic Mistral is a French writer of Occitan literature known for his work as a writer and linguist of the Provençal dialect.\n\nHe is best known for receiving the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature, which was awarded \"in recognition of the fresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production, which faithfully reflects the natural scenery and native spirit of his people, and, in addition, his significant work as a Provençal philologist.\"\n\nMistral made major efforts to revive the language of province by his work in creating a dictionary and transcribing the songs of troubadours that had spoken the language in its original form.\n\nAs for his own writing, Mistral's most significant single work was titled Mirèio (1859) and is a Provençal poem of twelve songs telling a tale of love thwarted by distance in social backgrounds.\n\nBorn: September 8, 1830\n\nBirthplace: Maillane, France\n\nStar Sign: Virgo"
