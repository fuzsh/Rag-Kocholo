She was born on April 6 1889 in VicuÃ±a (Elqui Valley).\n\nWhen she was 14 she started working as a school teacher's assistant and soon published her first articles in local newspapers. The grief caused by the suicide of his youthful love inspired his famous Sonnets of Death.\n\nIn 1914 she won the first prize of the Floral Games of Santiago and stopped using her name and adopted the pseudonym Gabriela Mistral, uniting her admiration for the poets, Gabriele DÂ´Annunzio and FrÃ©dÃ©ric Mistral.\n\nIn 1922 the Instituto de Las EspaÃ±as in New York published her first book Desolation, that initiated her recognition in Latin American literature: Poetry is in me, simply a lap, a sediment of my submerged childhood.\n\nShe carried out an important task in the educational reform of Mexico and, in 1926, she was elected Secretary of the Institute of Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, where she met Maria Sklodowska-Curie. In 1932 she started her diplomatic life; she was consul in Madridfrom 1933 to 1935. In 1938, impressed by the bombing of Gernika, she donated the rights of her work Tala to the fund for helping Basque children.\n\nIn 1945 she received the Premio Nobel de Literatura. Three years alter he wrote the well known as Appeal for Children, origin of UNICEF.\n\nIn 1951 she received the National Prize of Literature in Chile.
