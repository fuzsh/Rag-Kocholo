        "text": "TORONTO and BOUCHERVILLE, QC, July 8, 2024 /CNW/ - The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed several cases of potential contamination of Listeria monocytogenes linked to select Silk refrigerated beverages produced on a specific production line in a third-party manufacturer in Ontario and distributed by Danone Canada.\n\nUpon learning of confirmed cases of Listeria monocytogenes linked to these Silk refrigerated beverage products, Danone Canada, together with the CFIA, took immediate action to issue a voluntary recall on 15 Silk refrigerated plant-based beverage SKUs. Danone has also preventatively halted all production and shipments coming from this facility, until further notice, to carry out a thorough investigation.\n\nThe official recall notice of the CFIA detailing the product information and instructions for safe disposal is available here.\n\nThis recall is contained to certain Silk Canada refrigerated 1.75-1.89 L beverage products only and does not include other Silk items such as Silk shelf-stable beverages 946 ml including Silk Barista range, Silk coffee creamers (\"Silk for coffee\" & \"half & half\", all formats), Silk plant-based food (cheese, yogurt, whipping cream), Silk Nextmilk refrigerated, Silk Unsweetened Almond 940 ml, Silk Oat Original 890 ml, or anything not listed in CFIA's recall notice.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned about these reports, and we are taking this matter extremely seriously. We continue to focus our immediate efforts on protecting our consumers with care through this swift recall, and conducting a thorough investigation with our third-party manufacturer,\" shares Frédéric Guichard, President, Danone Canada.\n\nConsumers who have purchased these products are urged to follow the instructions provided by the CFIA and refrain from consuming them.
