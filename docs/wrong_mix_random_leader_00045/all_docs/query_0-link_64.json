The young man knew his stuff; his dissertation promised future research; his knowledge and personality, future teaching. \"Who is your favorite author,\" my colleague asked, at the end of things. Embarrassed silence. \"Oh, come on, you can think of someone -Steinbeck, Hemingway....0\" \"Well,\" said the Doctor of Philosophy, \"to tell you the truth, I haven't read anything for four years-working on my degree, you know-and before that I don't remember.\" \"Oh,\" said the interviewer. He would have gladly accepted Erle Stanley Gardner, or Ian Fleming, or even Mickey Spillane, he said. Not far from where the Diag passes Mason Hall is the office of Dr. Sashio Ashida, Lecturer in Psychology, master of Mishro-ryu (Flower Arrangement), Sekishu-ryu (Tea Ceremony), Seifuku-jitsu (Bone-Setting), and Judo (Judo). He is also a vigorous practitioner of a form of aquatic mayhem pursued at high noon, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of the year, in the Intramural pool by the Flounders' Club, an un clothed, loose-jointed, town-and-gown organization that plays a brand of water polo unknown elsewhere on land or sea. He is on the Board of Governors of the U. S. Judo Federation, chairman of a subcommittee on standards, and member of the Board of Examiners, who could be seen momentarily on TV last year judging the tryouts for the Olympic team. He himself is a Black Belt, Sixth Degree, of which there are only twelve holders in the United States. Tenth is highest, of which there are three in the world (there have been only about half a dozen all together, since Judo was founded in 1882). \"Judo was refined from jujitsu,\" Dr. Ashida explained. \"Kano, who founded Kodokan Judo College in 1882, eliminated the dangerous and hurtful techniques from jujitsu, and developed the central spirit, the high ideals already implied in jujitsu, which contains the general idea that 'gentle turns away sturdy'-maximum effect with minimum force. But from this simple idea of self defense grows idea of sport based on con 73\n\nPage 74 74 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW trol of spirit, control of physical self by mind, way of life conceived as gently controlling self, and others, for mutual welfare of all.\" Actually and literally, jujitsu is written in two characters: ju, meaning \"gentleness,\" and jitsu, meaning \"truth, reality, or sincerity\"-the gentle moment of truth, you might say, when you find yourself suddenly flat on your back, having thought you were only shaking hands. D5 means \"measure,\" or \"order\"; add do to ju, and you get something like \"the gentle discipline,\" or, to borrow a title from Thomas Deloney, a merry Elizabethan shoemaker, \"the gentle craft.\" There is something of the Buddhistic calm of mind in it, Ashida admits, as also in Tea Ceremony and Flower Arrangement, a psychological integration of the self within the circumstances of existence, however rough. But his field in psychology is, in fact, unrelated to his lifelong devotion to Judo. He is interested psychologically in the generalization of the variety of responses people make to the same problem, largely a mathematical matter, a stating in formulae of the probabilities and variations. His B.A. thesis on this problem caught the eye of William Arnold of Yale, to whom Ashida had written, and in 1953 Ashida came to the University of Nebraska to study with Arnold, who had moved there. He came not only as an aspiring mathematical psychologist, but as official representative of the Kodokan, the Judo association, personally appointed by President Kano, whose identity of name with the famous founder is a mere accident of Japanese nomenclature, not of biology. Dr. Ashida had been Assistant Instructor in Judo at the Nishinomiya and Isaka West Police Stations, and he has taught Judo ever since. From his base in Lincoln, Nebraska, he founded the Midwestern Judo Association, of which he is now Lifetime Honorary President. And this week, or any week, one may visit his various classes in Ann Arbor, at the Intramural Building, or Y.M.C.A.various ages and varieties, including a class for faculty wives-and there one may see some fellow or other in wide white pajamas, upside down, in mid-air, legs astraddle and bare feet like swastikas, being sturdily and truthfully pinwheeled over the gentle hip of Sashio Ashida. Dr. Ashida was one of eight children on a small farm near Kyoto, the fifty-fourth eldest son of a prominent family reduced in circumstances by the Meiji Restoration of 1868. He was born in 1924. At twelve, he decided to become a real man by beginning the study of Zen Buddhism and Judo. At fifteen, he earned his Black Belt, First Degree. At a technical school, he became a skilled mechanic and designer, was a foreman over 250 men in a machine shop producing airplane and submarine engines and gunsights, and had designed a 20mm. gunsight himself, all by the age of nineteen. He served briefly in the Japanese air force. He trained as a Kamikaze pilot, but fortunately the war ended before he did. After the war, he studied Chinese and German in night school, earned a B.A. in economics in 1948, and then earned his B.A. in psychology, at another college, in 1951, during which time he taught grammar school, and tutored the niece and nephew of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu. It took him ten years at Nebraska to complete the Ph.D., largely because of the linguistic barrier, which he finally hurdled with the aid of his teacher, Miss Eleanor Eliott, whom he married in 1955. In 1960, he became an American citizen; in 1963, a Doctor of Philosophy. With his wife and two daughters, he came to The University of Michigan on completion of his degree, as a National Science Foundation Post-doctoral Research Fellow in Psychology. Aside from Judo and the mathematical pursuit of human vagaries, Dr. Ashida claims two particular formative ideals: Tokugawa Ieyasu, the sturdy warrior and gentle poet who carved out the foundation for the two-hundred-and-sixty-year Tokugawa Era in 1542, and the rice plant, which, as it matures, bows to the earth in natural humility. You can see a good deal of both in this gentle, sturdy young man.\n\nPage 75 ON THE DIAGONAL 75 A young man and young woman enter the Periodical Room. He follows her attentively to some empty chairs at one of the long tables. He helps her, smiling, fresh as a rose from the fresh snowy air, out of her coat. She opens a textbook showing the innards of the human heart. He opens The Reader's Digest to an article entitled \"The Power Women Have Over Men.\" 0 After years of warbling and tootling among the aging bricks of Maynard Street, the University's School of Music finally opened shop on September 20, 1964, in a beautiful, sweeping building, designed by the late Eero Saarinen and set by him amid puffs of natural hill and woodland, on rolling lawns, and beside a spacious artificial lake, where two unseen fountains can be turned on to burst the surface like two widemouthed, shimmering funnels, or urns, made entirely of silver water. A misty, rainy, silvery day drove the elaborate ceremony inside, where it labored bravely on, with a jammed crowd and a kinked air-conditioner. Aaron Copeland and Leonard Bernstein, who received honorary degrees for the occasion, conducted the band unseen in another room. The rest of the crowd browsed through the halls, admiring the rooms for chorus, orchestra, quartet, and soloist, and the halls and halls of practice-rooms, some just the right size for Steinways and Baldwins, some for the black upright Hamiltons and brown upright Grinnells, and some for the single man with a fiddle. And then they discovered the pipe organs, ranging down in size and room from the one in the beautiful, small concert hall, to the one-man cells for practice, where Aeolian-Skinners and Reuters and M. Pekillers gleamed in dark-blond wood. 0 Jane, Jane, tall as a crane, The morning light creaks down again Dame Edith Sitwell is dead-on last December 9, at the age of 77. The strange, taunting nursery rhyming of that poem of hers has stayed with me since I first read it as a puzzled undergraduate. I also remember her hollow, gray voice intoning something about \"elephant's Ee-ahs\" in her \"Facade,\" a poem recited to music, and a fairly popular record among the cognoscenti of graduate school. The Jane of the poem is a poor hopeless English serving girl, skinny, ungainly, ugly, for whom the creaking dawn means nothing but more hopeless druggery about some huge mansion, about which the children of the rich had nothing to do but play. How odd it is to recall that Dame Edith was, herself, a very stick, or crane, of a woman, six feet tall, with an odd beaked face and slitted eyes, pale and cadaverous under a black, wimpled toque, for all the world as if Judith Anderson, playing Lady Macbeth, had somehow mistakenly sat for the familiar portrait of Erasmus. Dame Edith published a history of English eccentrics, and wrote a marvelous tribute to Dylan Thomas when he died. He was a whole generation younger, but she revered him as a poet and loved his free, eccentric spirit, from the depths of her avicular heart. Edgar Anderson notes, in scanning his botanical graphs for the next issue of the Quarterly, that there is no poet like her in the whole span of English poetry-a rare bird, alone along the whole wide shore, standing aloof and queer and tall as a crane. 0 And now T. S. Eliot is gone too, almost the last of the great literary names of the twenties, and of the twentieth centuryHemingway, Faulkner, Frost, Williams-all gone within a few years, all but their general overseer, Ezra Pound, the progenitor and survivor of a dazzling group.

It was great to hear the old bulldog growl, and to see what men could do. SATURDAY IN FINLAND They get up late, but the winter sun, later. We stand in the tentative gray of a new morning, A long line of infrequent voices, now Queuing like vague, uncertain spirits To buy the libations that affirm and redeem. Beside us, the liquor store, aseptic And legal, and locked till ten. Through the glass we can see the motherly Cashiers tidying their neat gray hair And the depraved young men poised by racks of bottles. Through the opening door we slink in good order, Like gnomes arisen from cracks in the sidewalk, Each Saturday face guilty with hope. Kaksi, they say, and the clerk obeys, Two colorless bottles reserved in a briefcase. I shall meet them again when the faint sun fails And the gentle drunks silently zigzag From storefront to curb and back again, Or topple from bicycles that spin a while And then lie in silence with the sprawling master. From the doors of small flats where workers exist The smell of potatoes and fish expands, And the patient wives reclaim their fallen, Knowing that Saturday is one in seven, And a Sunday asleep inters the dead week.

The First Step in a Long Journey By LAMMOT DU PONT COPELAND President, E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. For over a decade, Professor Maxwell H. Goldberg of the Center for Continuing Liberal Education at The Pennsylvania State University has been mixing the business man and the professor together in symposia to discover how a humanistic education works, or should work, in the workaday industrial world. The most recent of these was a three-day meeting at the University of Delaware, sponsored jointly with that university, the Wemyss Foundation, and Du Pont Company, at which your editor represented The University of Michigan. The theme for discussion was \"human competence in the world of change.\" We print the following papers by arrangement with Dr. Bruce Dearing, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Delaware, and Professor Marshall Fishwick of Delaware and the Wemyss Foundation, who together arranged the program, and with the permission of the Saturday Review, which printed versions or excerpts of the papers by Messrs. Copeland, Reese, Hechinger, and Donovan (December 12, 1964), and the permission of School and Society, which printed Mr. Peters's paper (Vol. XCII, October 31, 1964, pp. 304-305). The Humanities Center for Liberal Education in an Industrial Society, Inc., Dr. John Ball, Acting Executive Director, was co-sponsor. T SEEMS TO me most important that lution, chance, or deliberate choice, we in leaders in the world of higher education the United States have elected to rest our and leaders in the world of business fate on an industrial, rather than an agriculand industry have an opportunity to get tural, economy. Business and industry thus to know one another, and to exchange views stand forth, not as the only, but certainly on matters of mutual interest. First, I think as the chief mechanisms through which the we must recognize that, whether by evo- nation's wealth is produced. That is one side 77\n\nPage 78 78 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW of the coin. The other is that as the sophistication of business and industry increase, their need for educated men and women rises almost by geometric progression. And where can we look-where, indeed, should we look-but to the campuses and graduate schools of our colleges and universities? I doubt if this is an original thought, but were the world of higher education to be redefined as an industry, then its graduates would be regarded as its products, and business and industry as one of its chief customers. I advocate no such redefinition of higher education, but I make the point because it is so easy to grasp the strong mutuality of interest between customer and supplier. To carry this analogy a little further, I am very sure that you, as a production organization, can turn out a product more perfectly adapted to the needs of the user if you know something about that customer, and his needs. I suspect that the incentive to do so will be greater if your knowledge of the customer has led you to respect him, and even, perhaps, to like him. On our side, a relationship based on effective communication is certainly going to enable us to appreciate the problems and difficulties you face, and the skill and resourcefulness with which you have surmounted them. And this appreciation should, I think, make it easier for us to convey to you a clearer picture of our needs. But there is another aspect of this, and it must be understood. There is no group in this country that exerts a more powerful influence on popular thinking than do you and your fellow academicians. History will show, I believe, that what the intellectuals are thinking today is almost certain to be what the people generally are thinking tomorrow. The ideas that you and your colleagues are developing today have a very good chance of being the ideas that will influence the theory and practice of government tomorrow. The importance of this to us in industry is surely neither slight nor hard to read. If you, whose influence in the world of ideas is so pervasive, have an unfavorable reaction to business and industry, if you feel that it is antisocial, predatory, inhumane, it takes no great stretch of the imagination to think that the voters of tomorrow will share that belief. And if they do, considering how responsive government in a republic is to the will of the voters, it is not hard to visualize business and industry operating under a regimen of restrictive legislation and regulation that would make it well-nigh impossible for them to do their essential job of producing the nation's wealth. That this has significant implications for us in the world of business and industry is clear enough. Equally clear, I think, is the import of this for the future of our nation. World competition is such that our business and industry cannot hope to hold their own with their rivals in Europe and Asia unless they carry on their work in the most favorable climate, or atmosphere. We are no longer so superior technically that we can handicap ourselves. In what I have been saying you can, I hope, read something between the lines. It is a note of optimism, based on confidence that the minds and characters of American businessmen and industrialists are of such a nature that educators will like and respect them if they have the opportunity to know them, and understand them. This is not, you understand, a millennial claim. Some businessmen are smarter than others. Moreover, we have had, we have today, and we will have in the future, pirates, cheats, and sharpshooters, not to mention conspirators and crooks. On balance, though, I honestly believe that business people as a group merit your respect and your regard. My experience with educators has led me to the same optimism. They are, as a group, most worthy members of our national community. Here again, of course, perfection eludes us. It is, perhaps, paradoxical that a man can be a doctor of philosophy and a lineal descendant of Balaam's ass at one and the same time. But there have been cases. And there have been dishonest, unintelligent, and immoral educators. Human beings being human, there will be others. But on balance the teaching fraternity is notably, even outstandingly, intelligent, wellbalanced, perceptive-and stimulating and likable. And so you will see why I believe\n\nPage 79 BUSINESS AND THE HUMANITIES 79 meetings between educators and businessmen are so important to you, to us, and to the nation. Once effective communication has been established, once there is a solid foundation of mutual liking and respect between us, then it becomes far easier for each of us to acquaint the other with constructive criticisms designed to enable us to do a better job. Most of what I now have to say concerns that somewhat specialized part of the world of higher education, the part we broadly call the humanities. But I have no desire to sail under false colors, nor to appear to be preaching a doctrine that is at odds with the realities of industrial life in the institution with which I am connected. If I take as my text the importance of the humanities, of the liberal arts, and of the social sciences in modern life, it should be clearly understood that things have got to be kept in perspective. I am sure all of you recognize that the Du Pont Company's whole existence has been based on technology, on the physical sciences. The research we do, the production we carry forward, even the sales we make, depend to an overwhelming degree on the physical sciences. Were you to analyze the makeup of Du Pont's management, you would find that of the eight vice presidents, five hold the doctorate of philosophy in science or engineering, and two the bachelor's degree. Of the general managers, who head our twelve industrial departments, six have their doctorates and four their baccalaureates in the same disciplines. Superficially, you would hardly expect anything else. A chemical company staffed by English, French, or drama majors would have a rather difficult time competing with companies whose work was done by technically trained chemists, chemical engineers, and so forth. And so I would not have you leap to the conclusion that the Du Pont Company is about to staff its management with men trained in the liberal arts. Although the men who reach the upper rungs of corporate management no longer deal with the problems of their academic disciplines, their studies have trained them to keep a mentally tight ship, and to have conclusions follow facts. Such training is not unique to the physical sciences, but I do believe that those of you charged with academic curricula could give further consideration to a better integration of cause and effect. The scholar recognizes the interplays, but too many of our students have brains full of knowledge but no crossreference systems, too many facts but not enough imagination. Nevertheless-or perhaps in consequence -I believe in the great and growing importance of the liberal arts. As I look around, as I read my newspapers and my magazines, it seems to me that the problems that threaten to overwhelm our civilization, the problems that have got to be dealt with if we are to survive as human beings, let alone as civilized human beings, do not lie in the field of technology, of the physical sciences. This is true even though their roots may run deep into technical soil. The problem posed by the atomic bomb is an example. In the first instance, the problem grows out of the physical sciences. It all began with Professor Einstein's E=MC2. But today the technology of nuclear physics concerns us far less than what I suppose you would call the sociological problems that have come to exist because the bomb exists. It is possible to conceive of these problems being solved by technology-by, perhaps, some breakthrough by one side or the other so far-reaching as to make further competition hopeless. But such a development is, I should think, unlikely. And even if it came, it would promptly evolve into a social rather than a technical problem: What use do you make of your discovery? We in the United States had the problem in its purest form at the close of World War II. We had the atom bomb. No one else had it. This meant that we had in our hands the means to be the absolute rulers of the world. No one could have stopped us. This power the scientists had put into our hands. But the question as to whether, when, or how to use it was decided neither by the scientists nor by technical considerations. I cannot forbear to say, parenthetically, that one might have supposed that our refusal to use this power should have convinced the Soviet Union of our desire to\n\nPage 80 80 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW live and let live, and of the sincerity of our efforts to find a modus vivendi. This is perhaps naive on my part, for the Communists probably considered it the most childish stupidity on our part to refrain from exploiting our power to the utmost. And I must say I am glad it was we, and not they, who had the choice. But the nuclear issue is only one of our problems, of course. The racial question is a matter, not of the technical, but of the human, equation. The population explosion constitutes a tremendous challenge. The difficult and complicated problems involved in our relations not only with the Communist World, but with our friends and allies, are more sociological than technical. Man's impact on his environment-changing the balance of nature by diverting forest-land to crops, by switching agricultural land to housing developments, by polluting air and water-confronts us with many serious social questions the answers to which we do not have. Automation, stemming as it does from technical advances, offers an interesting problem. The problems and the challenges offered to us by automation are to a great degree social. They involve at least the temporary loss of employment by men and women who must have work or be supported by the state. They involve steadily rising standards of intelligence and education, as well as the resultant efforts to train men and women to meet them. The social dislocations implicit in these problems will be solved, when and if they are solved, by the best efforts of the social scientists and the humanitarians, working closely with the physical scientists. You might say, with a good deal of accuracy, that the physical scientists have been raising exceedingly knotty questions, and dumping them into the laps of the social scientists and the humanitarians. It might well be possible to write the history of our modern civilization in these terms, and without omitting any very significant episodes. Considering all these things, there can hardly be any doubt as to the importance of the humanities in our modern life. But are they important to a company like Du Pont? Of course they are. The Du Pont Company is certainly going to have to play some part, greater or less, in the solution of most of these tremendous problems. You can say as much of every company in the chemical industry, or indeed, any other industry. We are all of us in this boat together. We in Du Pont are well aware of this. I might even say we are at times somewhat regretfully aware of it, if we are to be wholly honest. For these problems make our existence a great deal more complicated than it was before they had, so to speak, got their full growth. But these regrets are nostalgic. There is no way of wishing time to a halt, nor of stopping progress, even if we wanted to. And I'm not sure we would want to. The difficulties with which the physical scientists present us are, I am sure, growing pains. They are inevitable as the expansion of our civilization brings within its scope millions of additional human beings, and forces us to adjust things to make room. As I said, we in Du Pont are well aware of this, as are managements in companies all across the country. When I say this, I narrow the focus down from the cosmic to the individual. What is the role of a member of Du Pont management in the solution of these problems? What can each of us contribute? What can we do to help you? What can you do to help us? I do not pretend to have the answers to these questions. I'm not sure anyone has, in the definitive sense. But it is time the questions were being asked, time all of us together were looking for answers. For it is abundantly clear that Americans are no nearer to solving these questions than are any other peoples. And there is a time factor. There is that about these problems which suggests that we cannot procrastinate. They won't wait for us. Let me, then, as the representative of a technically-minded company, volunteer one suggestion. It is that the solutions to our problems will not emerge as huge cosmic entities. Perhaps it would be easier if it happened that way, but in my opinion it\n\nPage 81 BUSINESS AND THE HUMANITIES 81 will not. The world's problems have historically not yielded to all-embracing solutions. It is true that efforts have many times been made to impose Procrustean solutions on great masses of people. This is, indeed, the easy way out, inevitably taken by authoritarian movements. There is one chief difficulty. It doesn't work. No, I believe solutions to these problems must rest upon the cumulative efforts of millions of individuals. It was not, after all, the Emancipation Proclamation that ended the institution of slavery in the United States. What ended slavery was the evolution, in the minds of millions of Americans, of the idea that it was wrong. Without that commitment on the part of the citizens of the North, it is doubtful whether Mr. Lincoln's proclamation would have survived as anything but a public-relations gesture that sounded good, but in the end proved little. So it will be, I believe, with our other problems. They will not be solved by the Congress of the United States, nor by the directives of any governmental agency. They will be solved, when they are solved, by small groups of intelligent men and women thinking about them, discussing them, and gradually distilling, in their intellects and their imaginations, the approaches that will ultimately yield success. This is not the easy way. There is no easy way. But it is a way that at least promises success, and I know of no other that does. And so, when we ask the question as to what the humanities have to contribute, it would seem that there are two answers. The first is the improvement of communication. It is easy to belittle this field. But the fact is that effective communication is an extremely difficult matter, complicated by all sorts of subtleties, as you know far better than I. You have much to contribute in this area, for communication between human beings is as much your province as the mechanical means for transmitting the human word is the province of the physical scientist. This is no slight mission. The future of the world may well hinge upon your success or failure. The second answer is less easily comprehended, but it is no less important. It is to arouse the minds of the millions of men and women with the intellectual capacity to do something about it. These are people who are not giving our civilization the benefit of their intelligence, who are sitting out anything not related to their immediate concerns. We have in them a tremendous natural resource. I think your work of educating young men and women should have as an important part the task of leading them to the realization of the necessity for them to interest themselves in these matters, to equip themselves to contribute something to their solutions. And of course there are three answers, not two. The third is not to be content with stimulating and preparing others to play their parts in solving our problems. It is to bring your own minds to bear, working sometimes alone, sometimes among yourselves, and sometimes with non-scholars who share your awareness of the problems and your determination to do something about them. This symposium gives evidence that a start has been made toward harnessing an impressive group of intellects for what will certainly be a long journey. But a Chinese philosopher-his name was Lao-tse-said, in approximately 550 B.C., that the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. (Please turn the page for Part 2)\n\nFrancis H.

Improving Humanistic Education By FRANCIS H. HORN President of the University of Rhode Island OVER THE PAST decade Max Goldberg's seminars on the place of the humanities in an industrial society have, I believe, been truly significant. They have succeeded in bringing together leaders from business and industry with professors and administrators from the academic world to consider ways of strengthening liberal education and more specifically, education in the humanities, in our colleges and universities. A concurrent objective has been to make such liberal education a more significant aspect of the training of those college graduates destined or selected for the perilous climb up the corporation pyramid toward the executive suite at its top. Certainly it has been sweet music to the ears of us who are committed to liberal education and who devote our lives to improving it in our colleges and universities to hear management people proclaim the importance to business and industry of the broadly educated graduate whose college experience is soundly based in the liberal arts. The trouble has been, however, that the more realisticallyminded recruiters whom business and industry send to our campuses in their highly competitive talent hunt want graduates whose collegiate education is soundly based in accounting, statistics, chemistry, engineering, or some other area of technical competence. As a matter of fact, top management has been begging the colleges and universities to turn out a product beyond the capacity of any institution of higher education. The corporation personnel directors, executive vice presidents, and chief executive officers who address themselves to this problem, generally call for a college graduate who combines the best qualities of a Socrates, a Leonardo, a Jefferson, and a Schweitzer. Corporation representatives at previous Humanities Seminars have asked for graduates who possess \"The imaginative comprehension which comes from understanding the whole condition of man,\" to quote one prominent industrialist. Or, to quote another, industry wants from us, \"men who understand the whole sweep of modem economic, political, and social life.\" I point out today, as I have on other occasions, that we in the colleges and universities have been remiss in not emphasizing strongly enough to industry that we cannot turn out such paragons of knowledge, ability, and virtue. In fact, if we in higher education are truthful, we must confess that we don't even know for sure even how to attempt it. Yet all too often we imply, if we don't actually state, that study of the humanities will produce the product sought. We are, indeed, perpetuating some academic folklore. But first, let me define the humanities. In terms of a body of knowledge, I find the recent definition of the Commission on the Humanities wholly acceptable: \"the study of history, literature, the arts, religion, and philosophy.\"' But I do not find that they hold to their definition when they include \"the social sciences, the visual arts, music, the performing arts as they are represented in the schools, and those aspects of science and mathematics which widen the understanding of man in relation to his environment as well as to other men.\" This gets almost everything under the umbrella of the humanities. And it further complicates the complicated question as to how humanistic education will more successfully develop human 1 Report of the Commission on the Humanities, 1964, p. 1. Subsequent references and quotations, as noted, are from this report.\n\nPage 83 BUSINESS AND THE HUMANITIES 83 competence, individually and collectively, to cope with rapid and extensive technological change. In the course of our deliberations here, we have examined some of the dimensions of such change, in fairly general rather than in specific terms, it seems to me; we have tried to define what we mean by competence and to delineate its nature; and finally, we have had from Professor Robert Lumiansky a discussion of an important proposal for channeling federal funds into the support of the humanities through a new independent government agency to be known as the National Humanities Foundation. There can be no doubt of the justification for greater federal support for the humanities, and I would hope, with Professor Lumiansky and his colleagues on the Commission on the Humanities, ultimately for the provision of substantial funds. Nevertheless, I am moved to make some critical comments about the lamentations of the professors of the humanities in general and of the Commission's report in particular. This commission, whose chairman, President Barnaby C. Kenney of Brown, is a colleague and friend of mine, consisted of as distinguished a group of scholars and university administrators, along with one outstanding lawyer and two outstanding corporate executives, as I have seen among educational commissions. I am greatly surprised, therefore, that these gentlemen, trained in the scholarly tradition of conclusions and generalizations based upon evidence, should have agreed and endorsed a report which seems to me to violate the very principles of objective scholarship for which the report urges federal support. The \"arguments for greater support and stronger development of the humanities,\" (the words are from the report) appear to me to be open to question. The claims made in the report for the humanities are not convincing, unsubstantiated as they are by any real evidence, and the repetition of the \"whining\" -the word was used by Professor Howard Meyerhoff yesterday and seems quite appropriate--of those in the humanities about the \"impoverishment\" of their disciplines is, in my opinion, quite unjustified. Let me quote from the report. \"The state of the humanities today creates a crisis for national leadership.\" The report then goes on to suggest that \"we appear to discourage creativity, to demean the fanciful and the beautiful, to have no concern for man's ultimate destiny, [if] in short, we ignore the humanities.\" It charges that the nation \"will spend billions on its outward defense and at the same time do little to maintain the creative and imaginative abilities of its own people.\" This in spite of the fact that there is renewed vigor everywhere in private, local, and state support of art, music, and the theater; that book sales are at an all-time high; that library support at every level, including assistance from the federal government, is increasing; and that church membership and attendance are at their peak in this country. The truth is that probably at no time in this century has the nation as a whole done more \"to maintain the creative and imaginative abilities of its own people.\" One may add, incidentally, that never before has the federal government recognized, and consequently, supported, the importance of artistic and cultural exchange as an instrument of foreign policy. It is about time that our professors in the humanities stopped the lamentations which contribute to the image of America as a nation of yahoos. This anti-intellectualism, for that is what it is, is unworthy of men devoted to the search for truth and the practice of rationality. The report of the Commission's Committee of the American Historical Association is typical of the attitude. \"Soberly we must say that in American society, for many generations past, the prevailing concern has been for the conquest of nature, the production of material goods, and the development of a viable system of democratic government. Hence we have stressed, both in our education and in our public support, the sciences, the application of science through engineering, and the application of engineering or quantitative methods to the economic and political problems of a prospering republic... by such one-sided choices we risk becoming in fact-what some European and Asiatic\n\nPage 84 84 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW commentators have always accused us of being-an overwhelmingly materialistic society. \"By contrast, our humanities... have been lightly regarded, or taken for granted, or left to the care of an underprivileged teaching class and the educational efforts (primarily) of our private colleges and universities.\" This last piece of intellectual snobbery belies the balanced judgment the historian is expected to bring to his pronouncements, and the statement is insulting to the efforts and achievements in the humanities and the fine arts of state universities such as California, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Indiana, Illinois, Texas, and others. But is it really true that we are neglecting the humanities in our colleges and universities; that the professors of the humanities are second-class, \"underprivileged\" citizens in the community of scholars; that the advancement of science \"was accomplished by the impoverishment of the arts and the humanities,\" as Dr. Gustave O. Arlt, then president, now, executive director, of the Council of Graduate Schools in America, has charged?2 Certainly, the humanities no longer occupy the position that they held in America for almost two and one-half centuries, when the classical languages, philosophy, and mathematics constituted most of the college curriculum. It is perhaps natural that humanistic scholars should protest and complain about the relative decline of their disciplines. But it should be remembered that the curriculum is always changing; that in the Renaissance, Latin scholars resisted the intrusion of Greek into the university curriculum; that until the middle of the last century, the classical languages resisted the acceptance of the modern foreign languages; that they both fought against the recognition of science; that at Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth, science entered the curriculum only through separately organized \"scientific schools,\" and at Yale, Sheff, the scientific school, was looked down upon by Yale College until their fusion some twenty-five 2 Congressional Record, January 10, 1963, p. 86 years ago; that later the social sciences had to fight their way for acceptance and academic respectability; and that even today, the vocationally oriented subjects like agriculture, engineering, home economics, business administration, and professional education, after a century of existence, are not accorded equal status in the groves of academe. In historical perspective it ill becomes the professors of the humanities to cry neglect, impoverishment, deterioration, and imbalance. But are the charges true? Hardly, it seems to me, to justify all the breastbeating. In two areas, I find imbalance, as charged: in federal financial support for research and for fellowships. But there is not truly \"an imbalance within academic institutions by the very fact of abundance in one field of study and dearth in another,\" as the report claims. The curriculum is not unbalanced. The National Education Association recently surveyed the faculty members in four-year colleges and universities teaching at least one course-some 138,000 in all. The survey showed the same percentage-27-in the humanities, in the social sciences, and in the natural sciences and engineering. The remaining faculty members were in vocational fields. The English and the history departments are among the largest on every campus. A rough examination of the University of Delaware's current catalogue lists 43 courses in the English Department and 25 in Speech and Drama, sometimes included in the English Department. History lists 40 courses; and Philosophy, 29. These three departments (placing English and Speech into one), with 137 courses, offer 43 per cent more courses than are offered in the Biological Sciences, with 46 courses, in Chemistry, with 33, and in Physics, with 17, for a total of 96. I know that in the university I serve, many students continue to major in English and History, and I suspect this is true elsewhere. Certainly, in most colleges and universities, because of general education or distribution requirements only English and History get all the students, whereas the sciences have to divide those available. I fail to find support for\n\nPage 85 BUSINESS AND THE HUMANITIES 85 the Commission's statement that \"the American practitioners of the humanities... are now prevented... from attracting enough first-rate individuals into their ranks,\" or for Professor Lumiansky's alarm about the \"shortage of properly qualified college and university faculty members in the humanities.\" Surely, the graduate schools are attracting a continuing flow of able students in the humanities, and I find the shortage of faculty here less alarming than in a number of other fields. I will admit that more fellowship funds in the humanities would help and should be provided as early as possible. I would point out, however, that the very generous federal support of graduate fellowships in the sciences has enabled the universities to use more of their own fellowship funds for awards in the humanities and the social sciences. Also, an increasing number of National Science Foundation fellowships are going to students in the nonscientific areas, and there is a generous program of fellowships available in some areas of the humanities under the National Defense Education Act. My own son is studying in UCLA's Institute of Near Eastern Studies under such a fellowship. I would, moreover, dispute the widely repeated charge that the humanities in universities have suffered because, as the Commission's report contends, \"Much of the federal money for science requires a proportionate commitment of general university funds to sustain the higher level of activity in the scientific departments.\" Actually, the vast outlays for scientific studies supported by federal funds improve the support of the non-scientific disciplines. In today's world, the universities will teach science and engage in scientific research whether federally supported or not. The heavy expense of instruction and research in the sciencesfor laboratories, electron microscopes, computer centers, atomic reactors, etc.-would have to be met one way or another. If the federal government did not provide for a considerable amount of such expense, the institution would really be forced to squeeze the non-scientific departments. Even if the universities actually lose money on their re search contracts, as they claim, the situation would be infinitely worse for the humanities without such contracts. As for the humanities faculty's being \"underprivileged,\" which generally means being less well paid than their scientific colleagues, this all-too often charge is absurd. Salary schedules do not differentiate between disciplines, although the demands of the market place are operative. Good professors in literature, history, or philosophy who are productive scholars are paid as much as good professors in the sciences who are productive scholars. In fact, if the specialized field in the humanities is in short supply, the professor of this specialty may get a higher salary than an equally good scientist in an area not in short supply. I am willing to concede, however, that because of critical shortages in most of the sciences, a mediocre science professor may receive more than a mediocre professor in the humanities. But this comes from the marketplace, not from discrimination against those in the humanities. It is also true that on many campuses the potential for extra compensation is greater for the scientists. But it just is not true, as Dean Peltason of the College of Arts and Sciences at Illinois wrote to Congressman John E. Fogarty, that \"in effect the salary of almost every university scientist is at least two-ninths more than that of comparable scholars in other fields.\"3 The non-scientist can, if he wishes, teach in the summer and with the two-term summer program becoming more common, can, when teaching both terms is allowed, earn more in the summer than his scientific colleague doing research. It is my impression, furthermore, that a well-known professor in the humanities can command a greater honorarium for lectures off campus than a scientist, whose reputation and drawing power, even if a Nobel laureate, is likely to be less than that of an outstanding writer, artist, critic, historian, or philosopher. Certainly, a Paul Tillich, a Henry Steele Commager, a Robert Penn Warren, or a John Ciardi-formerly a pro3 Congressional Record, January 10, 1963, p. 85\n\nPage 86 86 T8E MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW fessor and once active in these seminarsare flooded with opportunities providing extra compensation for lecturing. Those in the humanities, moreover, often get paid for what they write; the scientists seldom, if ever. Professors in the humanities have certain fringe benefits their scientific colleagues often do not share. Their research is seldom so demanding of time; they have, therefore, greater freedom and flexibility for travel, visiting professorships, and assignments overseas. It is time, I contend, for the professors of the humanities to be less sorry for themselves and for the subjects they teach. The humanities are not in a sad state nor their practitioners relegated to an inferior status amidst the halls of ivy. I suggest that for them to stop denigrating the humanities would be an important step toward \"improving, adapting, and supporting humanistic education.\" They should also, I believe, stop making extravagant claims for the humanities. The Commission's committee of historians stated that learning the humanities has given the individual \"intellectual humility.\" I see little evidence of it in the Commission's Report or in other pronouncements of the professionals in the humanities. The report suggests that it is only through the humanities that comes \"whatever understanding can be attained by fallible humanity of such enduring values as justice, freedom, virtue, beauty, and truth.\" That \"Upon the humanities depend the national ethic and morality, the national aesthetic and beauty or the lack of it, the national use of our environment and our material accomplishments.\" Finally, that \"the humanities are not merely our, but the world's best hope.\" The natural extension of this pride is the claim, made by the Committee on the Schools in the Commission's Report that \"men and women who have a thoughtful appreciation of humane studies understand more fully than others the complexities with which we all live, and they have the potential for dealing with these complexities more naturally and more successfully than people who are unaware of or indifferent to the humanities,\" by implication, I suppose, scientists, social scientists, engineers, pharmacists, and so forth. The statement goes on: \"Those who understand and appreciate the humanities also lead more rewarding lives both within their own hearts and minds and in their relations with their neighbors and associates, their communities and their country.\" Where is the evidence? What studies prove that professors of literature, history, and philosophy, for example, order their personal lives-even their domestic livesany more successfully than do their colleagues in the social sciences and the sciences? Is there not some evidence, furthermore, that the practitioners of the humanities-as distinct from the professors -the poets, painters, musicians, for example, actually order their individual and collective lives somewhat less successfully than do their average fellowmen? Professor Lumiansky himself referred to them as those \"crazy poets and artists.\" I wonder if the world would actually be governed better if it were governed by philosopher-kings, as Plato urged. Assuredly, the professors of science appear to be more modest than those of the humanities. The more science advances, the less positive scientists become about ultimate truth. Certainly, they do not claim that man's and the world's salvation lies in the study of the sciences. The report, I believe, is wrong about such salvation. The world's best hope is not just the humanities or the sciences, but education, broadly conceived, in all its aspects and at all its levels. The hope for the teeming people of Asia and Africa, for example, may be through education for agriculture and engineering and public health, not through the study of philosophy and history and literature. Until their bellies are full, their bodies not wracked by pain, and their children literate, they will have little use for the ministrations of the humanities. As a matter of fact, no continent has such a long and such a pervading tradition of the humanities as has Asia. But the improvement and extension of humanistic studies will not lick Asia's problems. For the immediate future, at least, they must\n\nPage 87 BUSINESS AND THE HUMANITIES 87 look to the applied sciences for the answers. I was impressed, incidentally, by Mr. Fred Hechinger's tribute to the scientist vis-a-vis humanistic scholars. \"It is among the scientists,\" he stated, \"that the questioning of the consequences of their actions to man's fate has been most evident... among the greatest of the scientists-because their competence has brought about the most world-shaking changes-the compassion for generations on the razor's edge of disaster has been most poetically outspoken.\" Actually, the greatest advances in the future in understanding the nature of men, and perhaps regretfully, controlling his destiny, may come not from humanistic studies but from studies in the biological and behavioral sciences. The work on the DNB molecule and other genetic studies and the new activity in psychology may well prove to be more spectacular than any achievements to date in the physical sciences. We may yet acquire the knowledge to enable us to control human heredity and human behavior. With such possibilities on the horizon, it is difficult to accept the basic assumption upon which much humanistic study rests: that human nature does not change; that past is always prologue; that, as Professor Reese expressed it, \"Whatever it would be to be competent as a human being is no different in this age from that it would be in any other.\" Robert M. Hutchins puts it this way: \"The function of a man as man is the same in every age and in every society, since it results from his nature as a man.'\"4 And as a corollary, he declares that \"the aim of an educational system is the same in every age and in every society where such a system can exist: it is to improve man as man.\" On this conviction, he proposed his version of the higher learning in America, a neo-Aristotelianism built solidly on the humanities. Assuredly, our goal is to \"improve man as man.\" But in the light of the bomb, by which civilization and much of mankind can be destroyed, and of the developments in biological and chemical warfare, perhaps 4Robert M. Hutchins, The Conflict in Education (New York, 1953), p. 68 just as deadly, the conditions for such improvement may have changed materially. But even if we forget the shadow of the bomb, even if we admit that the humanities may not hold the single key to man's future and a better life for all, surely we must concede that the humanities-that literature, history, philosophy, religion, and the fine arts-do have a significant role in our lives. The arts and letters, the Commission's report correctly states, \"are the immemorial answer to man's questioning\" and the study of them is therefore \"where we look most directly for enrichment of the individual's experience and his capacity for responding to it.\" But what insights do the humanities today actually offer to questioning man, or more specifically, to the questioning student? It is in seeking this answer that one becomes most discouraged about the humanities today. The study of the humanities has all too often succumbed to the techniques and objectives of other disciplines. Beginning courses are taught, as almost everywhere, but with greater loss to the student, as if every student were a potential major in the subject. Too much humanistic research is marked by the nit-picking characteristic of some scientific research. Professor Morris Freedman, in his excellent book, Chaos in Our Colleges (a misnomer, incidentally), points out that the teaching of English, even at the high-school level, has become the teaching of footnote citation.5 The study of literature is all too often a study of sources, indebtedness, literary trends. The sweep of history, its significance and illumination of contemporary events, is frequently lost in the dull recital of unrelated facts or occasionally in a quaint antiquarianism. Philosophy, once the queen of the sciences, has long ago been lost to mathematics, and according to Hutchins, at least, is generally in chaos. Theology is shunned; the teaching of \"religion,\" I learned at a recent conference on the subject, generally results in the student's ending up as an \"unconcerned agnostic.\" As for the fine arts, F, L. Lucas, in his Morris Freedman, Chaos in Our Colleges (New York, 1963), p. 31\n\nPage 88 88 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW brilliant essay, \"Testtuberculosis: The Menace of Science to The Humanities,\" has his advocate for the sciences say of the humanities in our time: \"And what has your literary and artistic world produced in this present century? A lot of synthetic inanities-of decadent, anti-rational maunderings. In fact, a general stampede from reason.\"6 In any case, what one regrets most about the present state of the humanities is the great gulf between what they can do for mankind and what they apparently actually do. Certainly they do not need pump priming to the extent of billions of dollars to initiate steps toward improvement. I have the feeling, however, that the professors clamoring the loudest for substantial federal support have their eyes on money for research and for research assistants. To me, what is most vital and what most merits our vigorous support of a federal aid program is the need rather to improve the teaching of the humanities. Somehow through experimentation, through financial assistance to help attract a fair share of the ablest young people going into teaching at the high school and college level, through in-service opportunities for upgrading and revitalizing experienced teachers, through sensible reductions of teaching loads, through commissions and studies designed to explore the role of the humanities in our education and our society, we must come to making the humanities more nearly approach the potential they have and the contribution they can make to our lives. With or without federal financial assistance, we must endeavor to put our humanistic house in order. Without such an attempt, all the money in the world will do little really to improve humanistic education and to make it more meaningful for our people and our time. Let me caution, moreover, against allowing amounts of federal funds for the humanities to result in reducing even further than at present the interest in effective undergraduate teaching. In the sciences, this has been a sad by-product of federal s F. L. Lucas, The Createst & Other Essays (New York, 1961), p. 106 largesse, although it might have developed by itself. Care must be exercised rather, to find ways of improving classroom teaching in the humanities. Let me emphasize that the humanities are not an end in themselves any more than science is. The end of humanistic education is, as Hutchins says, \"to improve man as man.\" \"Such improvement of men,\" he goes on to say, \"means the fullest development of their rational, moral, and spiritual powers.\" This is the task, not just of the humanities, but of all of liberal education. In this task, as the Commission's report states, \"The natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities are of their nature allies.\" The report of the history committee declares that \"we should seek ways to establish an interplay between the sciences and the humanities so that they may mutually complement and fortify each other.\" We must strive to bridge the gap between the two cultures. We must recognize that in today's technological society, true human competence depends upon knowledge and insights that come from all aspects of a liberal education, and we must strive to improve the teaching of all the liberal arts and sciences. But improving the quality of the teaching of the liberal arts and sciences is not enough. We must also improve the quantity. The human competence required to meet the ever greater technological changes that face us, can scarcely be developed in the traditional four-year college program. A year ago, at a meeting of the deans of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences in land-grant state universities, I proposed that the normal undergraduate program should be extended to five years. The idea aroused little enthusiasm; the papers reported that it went over like a ton of lead. But I am convinced that in the light of the explosion of knowledge in all fields, the development and inclusion in the curriculum of new areas of knowledge or older areas not previously considered-studies in nuclear science and non-Western cultures, for example-and the increasing specialized demands for occupational preparation or graduate school admission-all this in the\n\nC.

Some students will manage it in four, others in six, just as now some get through in three years, some take five. I realize that the trends are all in the other direction-for shortening the undergraduate college years. I recognize the possibility of squeezing a year out of the current twelve years of pre-collegiate education or of covering the present college freshman year in high school. But I am persuaded that even if this can be done, we would be better off to add the year to the current standard program. I recognize too that a student cannot be exposed to all knowledge while in college or acquire a liberal education in four or five academic years. A truly liberal education is the product of a lifetime of learning, study, reflection. Even then few individuals attain it. The best the college can do is to lay the foundation for a liberal education, to inculcate the habits of mind, breadth of interest, and enlargement of spirit which, when continued and enriched during the later years-and there will be more of these later years for most of us-can result in a truly liberal education. This foundation, however, can be laid more soundly, in my opinion, if we take five years to its building, rather than four as at present. I believe that the best way for higher education to assist in the process of producing human competence equipped to cope with the rapid and indeed even more revolutionary technological changes that are coming is to provide a normal undergraduate program of five years, devoted primarily-and whenever possible, exclusively-to the liberal arts and sciences, liberally and effectively taught by dedicated and inspiring teachers. I would hope that all those at this Humanities Seminar could find it in their hearts and minds to commit themselves to such a program and to such teaching. 3. The Education of the New Humanist By C. M. D. PETERS Assistant Manager, Shell Oil Co., New York City T SEEMS LOGICAL that, in the age of automation, the educational priorities should go to the prospective politician, businessman, and administrator. But what kind of education should they get? As a representative of middle management in a large business concern, I would like to give my personal opinion. A typical answer to the question is \"a broad general education that will make the student well informed about the environment we live in.\" But, in the perspective of the complex, modern, changing world, this is not enough. What is needed is an education that will refine, sharpen, and develop the faculties for critical appreciation of any aspect of our environment, with a view to wisdom of action. What we are talking about, of course, is a humanistperhaps a New Humanist. With science and technology and the quantitative concepts of mathematics figuring so largely in the modern world, there must be added to the usual faculties associated with humanismnamely, those of thought and expression in terms of words-the faculties of thought and expression in terms of mathematical symbols. A useful term that is becoming current is \"numeracy\" as a complement to \"literacy.\" Actually, the above contains nothing new. From the time of Charlemagne, through the Middle Ages and beyond, the Trivium (grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music) formed a sevenfold re\n\nPage 90 90 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW quirement for the Master of Arts degree all over Europe. What one is talking about is something akin to the Renaissance man. The vastly expanded storehouse of known facts and the complexity of the modern world do not make him an impracticality. The pruning, garnering, and selection of the essential principles is just a bit harder than it used to be. Accordingly, I would define the New Humanist as one who is literate, \"numerate,\" articulate, and human; excels in one or the other of the first two qualities; and has knowledge of a reasonable range of literature, philosophy (including politics and economics), and history in support of the quality to be literate, and of mathematical and scientific theory and practice in support of the quality to be \"numerate.\" Some amplification is perhaps worth while. In regard to being both literate and numerate, rare is the man who can be both a first-class essayist and a first-class mathematician. Words and numbers are different things and a high degree of skill with one appears to require a somewhat different bent of mind than with the other. The pure humanist or \"literate\" man has been trained to distill verbal judgment as to what is true-false, good-bad, beautiful-ugly, profitable-unprofitable out of the circumstances of human life. Language is the tool and the area of training is literature, philosophy, and history. The pure scientist or \"numerate\" man has been trained to distill from the massive data of observation in the physical world what is causative, etc., in the relationships of the components. Mathematics, and, to some extent, language, is the tool, and the area of training is physics, chemistry, biology, etc. The crux of the matter is whether, in trying to combine both \"literacy\" and \"numeracy\" for the New Humanist, one would get a school that is too broad to permit \"excellence.\" The answer is in the selectivity of the subject matter for the curriculum. The New Humanist who is headed for business should aim at being very proficient in numbers. So much of the business world is reduced to numbers. The advent of the computer is more and more translating all his information into mathematical symbols. And it is the products of science and technology that are very largely his stock in trade. By being grounded in the finest techniques of mathematics and in the major laws and principles of science, he should be able to maintain contact with the scientists and technologists, no matter how much these specialized fields may shift or be subject to obsolescence. In regard to being articulate and human, there is the danger of being \"sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought.\" And in these days of the specialist, man is inclined to lose the art of thinking and speaking on his feet. There is inclined to be a loss of confidence in the individual and an unwillingness to speak or act unsupported by specialized assistance. I would like to see the up-andcoming New Humanist a member of the university debating team. Secondly, I would like to see the New Humanist take part in sports-how ever bad his performance. In regard to excelling and a reasonable range of knowledge, as indicated above, excellence is incompatible with excessive broadness. And the most that one can expect, therefore, is excellence in limited areas and proficiency in the rest. Furthermore, since the main concern is the development of faculties-the ability to survey an area of experience, dig out the critical details, and form independent judgments, the curriculum need not stress the latest fad or cover a wide range. It should be classical in the sense of first class. It should be concerned with material where the thinking has been tested and acknowledged as first class, and there is no better tester than the passage of time. Furthermore, the prospective New Humanist should receive a plentiful exposure to serious study and creative thought. The educators still can say that they offer all the subjects, and it is up to the New Humanist to take them and then for business and politics to recognize him. But I think the educator should go further. The definition of the New Humanist offers a certain norm and standard but leaves open a great variety of ways to reach it. No educational institution can excel in everything. But perhaps the curriculum for the New Human\n\nJames N. GorringeGorringe, James N.Managerial CompetenceVol. IV, No.: 2, Spring 1965, pp. 91-94http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.act2080.0004.002:06\n\nPage 91 BUSINESS AND THE HUMANITIES 91 ist in each institution can be directed to those subjects where they have the finest experts and teachers. Perhaps, too, admission could be limited to those students who have the potential for reaching the highest standards by confining it to those who have proved themselves in prerequisites of the first two years. Recognition, too, could be advanced if there could be a common name for the school from one institution to another-something like \"Humanities Lit. Num.\"-with a common standard of excellence. The scientists and technologists inevitably will go on fragmenting the areas of their investigation into smaller and more esoteric units. But if the New Humanist is going to be \"numerate,\" then in the field of education the scientist will have to set out the critical principles in a reasonably tractable form in the same way that the men of literature, philosophy, and history have done. I believe that the new breed of historians of science can help. The graduate New Humanist will not be at any vocational disadvantage; on the contrary, there will be competition for him. Moreover, there are few starting jobs in business which he would not be able to handle with ease in very short order. Given the appropriate pertinacity and breaks from above, it should not be too long before he will be in some seat of power in some new or expanding institution in politics, business, or administration for which he will have been trained. 4. Managerial Competence By JAMES N. GORRINGE Employee Relations Department, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey FIND MYSELF equating competence with flexibility, balance, awareness, breadth of understanding, a capacity for constant growth. I think we have come to take for granted competence seen as mastery of one's own field. We have come to assume without question that the competent man can hoe a particular row efficiently. But we now expect him to be able to move beyond his own garden patch. We expect him, in a word, to be generalist as well as specialist. This afternoon we shall be concerned with the dimensions of technological change -the developments taking place that will put an ever increasing premium on these various facets of competence. I should like to pick up where we left off this morning, and perhaps lead into our afternoon's discussion by applying the theme of this conference to the development of sound industrial management. How can industry supplement the efforts of the academic world in educating for managerial competence in the face of technological change? And what should industry do to help maintain competence once it is achieved? I think you will agree that the successful company of today is chiefly a product of executive actions taken in the past to select the right people, to place them in jobs for which they were qualified, and to see to it that they were able to grow to meet the needs of the organization and at the same time to achieve that measure of personal growth and self-satisfaction so necessary to a well-rounded man. And I am convinced that even more time, effort, and imagination will have to be expended on these practices in the future, for competence is a moving target. We must constantly be taking new aim at it and finding surer ways of bringing it in range. Several conditions lend urgency to our efforts. One is the continued growth and increasing complexity of business and industry-the result in good part of rapid technological advance. It is a truism that if\n\nPage 92 92 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW a company is to survive it must grow. As it expands into new fields and markets, it needs men of initiative and flexibility, men not afraid to go out on a limb. It is no disparagement of current industrial management to say that in the years ahead we shall need executives even more resourceful than the best we have today. Another factor contributing to the importance of developing our management is the unsettled condition of the world. Twothirds of the business of my own company is conducted outside the United States. We work in many areas suffering from social, political, and economic instability. And we work in countries where excessive nationalistic feeling and leftist influences hamper desperately-needed economic growth. It is unrealistic to assume that the conditions inimical to free enterprise in these countries will happily reverse themselves in the course of our lifetime. The future managers of our operations in many areas overseas will need all the patience, ingenuity, and stamina of their predecessors-and more too. A third condition driving home the urgent need for competent managers is the increasingly competitive nature of all business and industry. Any company needs men who, in spite of complicating factors, will know how to make it more efficient, who will find ways both to improve products and services and to lower costs, and who will be alert to new concepts. Competitive pressures are such that the effective manager today must be willing to sacrifice for the job a good deal of time that he would normally spend with his family or friends. The stereotype of the highpowered executive knocking off on every pleasant summer afternoon for a round of golf has long since gone by the board. A managerial position in industry requires the same dedication that we have long associated with the professions. Like the truly able and outstanding lawyer, doctor, and teacher, today's industrial manager must fundamentally be a hard worker, willing to give unstintingly of his time and energy to the job. In essence, then, industry needs managers of judgment, imagination, and initiative. Few men are born with these three qualities in equally strong measure, but given a man with a capacity for growth-a not uncommon trait, fortunately-they can be developed. How, then, do we go about it? How do we achieve and maintain managerial competence? I am tempted at this point to give you a rundown on Jersey Standard's program of managerial development, of which I am understandably proud, but I shall resist and confine myself to a few broad principles applicable, I believe, to all industry. The first of these is our need to spot men with potential as early as possible in their careers-to become skillful enough, if possible, to sense management potential even as we recruit men fresh from college. We are nowhere near being knowledgeable enough about how to go about this, and industry has been investing a significant amount of time and money on its own, and in conjunction with social scientists, on ways and means to become better at it. But we have learned a few things. We have learned to be wary of being unduly impressed by the flash-in-the-pan performance. Under a certain set of circumstances a man can show great managerial promise that will not be borne out as he moves into new and different situations. I think we have learned to reserve judgment and to avoid jumping to conclusions until a man has been given the chance to prove he can conduct himself effectively in a wide variety of circumstances. On the other hand, and perhaps more significantly, we have learned the importance of giving a man a good deal of responsibility early in his career. In the past we have tended to feel that a man needed a long period of indoctrination before he was ready to take on serious responsibility in a job. We now know that it is responsibility that separates the men from the boys-that a man's potential can be most accurately estimated by the way he makes important decisions for which he is held accountable. A second principle that industry must keep in mind is the need for sound developmental programs, and I stress the word sound. I think we have to avoid an unusual\n\nPage 93 BUSINESS AND THE HUMANITIES 93 number of pitfalls in this area. In our desire to bring men along, we are all too likely to embrace programs that look good on the surface but that merely give the impression of accomplishing something. It is easy for us to be taken in by what I may call the \"accounting phase\" of managerial development-detailed reports, check lists, voluminous data in colorful form about a man's performance. We are too often bemused by what's in vogue-the training fad of the moment-which may or may not be what's best for our purposes. Fancy programs can easily give us the illusion they are accomplishing something, when in actuality they may be merely an amiable waste of time. Personally I am leery of programs that stress a large amount of reading about and \"observation\" of what other men are doing. They reminded me of Mr. Dooley's comment \"that readin' is th' next thing this side iv goin' to bed f'r restin' th' mind... Believe me, Hinnissy, readin' is not thinkin'.\" A good many developmental programs I have seen have been the next thing this side of going to bed for resting the mind. It seems to me that the best programs are protracted on-the-job assignments under conditions conducive to growth-where a man is asked to think as well as observe, and where he is given responsibility and held responsible. In brief, I feel that we should hang onto what horse sense we may be blessed with about all programs for development. We should never forget that development is selfdevelopment always-that it can be encouraged but not imposed. Perhaps the test of a good program is that it lays claim to no more than giving a man a chance to learn a few new things and to prove his capabilities-to himself as well as to his management-in a new situation. A third principle that industry should adhere to is the need for constant appraisal by management of a man's progress in terms of what he is expected to achieve. It is perhaps not enough that a manager sit down periodically with a man and review his performance. It seems to me that the important thing is that a manager understand a man well enough and be articulate enough to make sure that a man is conscious of his own needs for further development and advancement through the organization. I believe that a manager should be sufficiently sensitive and observant to distinguish between those personal characteristics that a man can do something about and those he can't, and then try in every possible way to make clear to a man how he can make the best use of his abilities. People differ naturally in intellectual ability, leadership, drive, initiative, motivation and the like. They often have distorted ideas not only about their own capacities, but about what they fundamentally want in their working life. They may earnestly believe, for example, that they are willing to make the necessary sacrifices when in actuality they are not. A good manager can be helpful in bringing a man to realistic terms with himself, and accordingly can aid in making him more effective. This is asking a good deal of a manager, of course, considering his many other preoccupations, but it seems to me one of his most important obligations. A fourth principle that industry should bear constantly in mind is the need for a sound policy of promotions. The whole purpose of development, after all, is to make men ready to fill key jobs. All too often, however, usually from needs of the moment, important secondary jobs-jobs offering the right challenges for advancement-are filled by men who do not have the capacity to advance further. Thus the avenues to the top become blocked, and the efficiency and morale of the organization suffers. Industry should be sufficiently forward-looking to avoid such traps. Finally, I think that top management should hold middle management accountable for the development of younger men. A manager himself should be judged in good part by how effective he is at bringing along a junior executive. As the head of one of Jersey's large refineries once said, people become managers only when they develop pride in the accomplishment of those working for them. Nevertheless, the principle of accountability, properly implemented, is probably the most important single force\n\nWilliam L.

We have been concerned thus far with the achievement of managerial competence. What about its maintenance? There can be no valid separation between them, of course. The good manager should continue to be in the process of becoming a better manager until the day he retires. He should be given every opportunity to become familiar with new developments and to broaden his horizons. In our large corporations today, with our seemingly inevitable emphasis on standardization of organization, procedure, and policies, we sow the seeds of obsolescence in every manager we allow to become more concerned with method rather than with objectives and goals. It is easy for him to become so engrossed with the trees that he loses sight of the forest, and this we should not let him do. Industry owes the academic world a debt of gratitude for its imagination and initiative in organizing in recent years a large number of useful courses and seminars for the established manager. It is very helpful for the manager to get away from his job now and again, to be exposed to the thinking of his peers in other organizations, and to learn of developments in a variety of fields from eminently qualified university people. Such courses, and similar educational efforts by industry itself, make for the maintenance of efficient management. And efficient management, in turn, makes for good morale. We know that a definite correlation exists between labor problemsmore people on hand than are needed to do the job-and low morale. In industry, the tight ship is always the happy ship, and it takes knowledgeable, sensitively aware management to keep it so. Both industry and the academic world face a real challenge in devising ways to help managers as well as other professional and technical people to keep abreast of the times and demands of their jobs. Our problem, when it comes right down to it, is seeing that we so educate our management people and so continue to educate them that technological development and the bewildering speed with which the world is moving today, will not make them obsolete. 5. Education for Human Competence By WILLIAM L. REESE Professor and Chairman of the Department of Philosophy, University of Delaware IWOULD LIKE to suggest that whatever it would be to be competent as a human being is no different in this age from what it would be in any other; at least it is difficult to see how the sort of change transmuting one age into another would change the goal of human life. But this unchanging goal must be realized under conditions more and more crowded, increasingly more artificial, substantially more noisy, more generally afflicted by a blight which has recently been identified as \"uglification,\" and in which new processes are altering the practical arts by which we live, thus promising to make most of our most tactile labor unnecessary-and also, apparently those workers who have only this to contribute to society. It can be argued that our human sense was more at home in the less crowded, more natural, more peaceful conditions, where long silences occurred, and man came into touch with the natural world through work. There are now areas where a long period of silence is enough to rouse a man from sleep. And everywhere, increasingly, machines do the work while man does only meta-work. If we are to ask how one goes about educating for human competence under these conditions, we must surely begin by asking\n\nPage 95 BUSINESS AND THE HUMANITIES9 95 what it means to be humanly competent. One exhibits competence as a physician when he heals his patient, competence as a businessman when he makes a profit, competence as a statesman when his rule results in the well-being of his people. And to be competent in one of these ways is certainly part of human competence. But I take it that a man might be competent as a physician and, at the same time, be quite incompetent in a human sense, so human competence goes beyond vocational or professional competence, although it includes that kind of competence as a part. And if we are educating for human competence and not merely for technical competence, we must include but go beyond the goal of technical competence. In what direction must we go beyond technical competence to reach human competence? At the outset I assumed that human life has a goal, an unchanging goal. If it has, human competence would consist of achieving this goal. But the language is very old-fashioned, and grave men have warned us often enough in recent years that life is meaningless and man a useless passion. Is life meaningless? Has human life, indeed, no goal? The questions seem hardly edifying. And I would like to avoid being painted into the corner where I sometimes find myself in the Introduction to Philosophy class, treating questions which later seem to me highly dubious; for example, \"Am I a man dreaming I am a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming I am a man?\" The position is uncomfortable, for all of the students oriented primarily toward technical competence, a not inconsiderable portion of any beginning class, think me in that moment stark, staring mad, and in my heart I half agree with them. And perhaps whether I am a man, as I think, or human life has a goal, as I think, depends upon something beyond philosophy investing the individual with a significance he did not himself simply make up. But I don't want to be painted into that corner either, even though, when it is time to stand up and be counted, I might well take my position there voluntarily. Suppose, in this extremity, we turn to an example where technical competence is related to values presumably more ultimate -the four ashramas, or stages of life, of Hinduism. The first stage, that of a student, is the stage of preparation for life; the second stage, that of the householder, is the stage in which technical competence is man's goal. The last two stages, the \"loosening of the bonds,\" and the quest for enlightenment, are to be the flowering of life, a fulfillment to which the earlier stages stand as means. This is, of course, an ideal of Hindu life, not a description. But as an ideal it is instructive. If we stress technical competence alone, ours becomes a life of three ashramas: the stage of the student, the stage of technical competence, and retirement, which could perhaps best be characterized as a stage of displaced technical competence, without point or meaning. It would do much for us could the end of life be its climax, and not its anti-climax. Education would then have as its concern the whole of life, and not merely its second stage. And yet our way cannot be the Hindu way, nor our enlightenment their enlightenment, for we are more earthy, more practical, more content-bound. What, then, are our stages on life's way, our equivalents to the four ashramas? This question too supposes that life has a goal; it implies that there is a way which for us would be ideal; hence, better than other possible ways. But I think we can avoid the question behind our question merely by starting at the point of our greatest certainty, for if any of the things we do are worth doing, it will be reasonable to believe in a more general goal locked up in this activity. So if there is value in medicine, business, and political rule, in any of the parts of life, we can derive through a sort of part-whole logic, the goal of human life. Consider, for example, the competence of the physician. By medical competence we mean a precise inter-working of knowledge, experience, and skill directed toward a specific goal, the health of the patient. And the passage from the boy dreaming of being a physician to the physician (dreaming, on occasion, one imagines, of being a boy) is a passage marked by an actualization of the\n\nPage 96 96 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW potentialities of the boy. If we generalize this notion, we are saying that the goal of life is the state of developed human capacity, and we shall take this to be the sense of the more general phrase \"human competence.\" And so it turns out that educating for \"human competence\" is to mean educating for the goal of developed human capacities. And we must add to the procedures ensuring technological competence in the education of our youth whatever will maximize the development of these capacities. Our statement, at this point, rules out educational programs and curricula featuring technological competence solely; all programs factually oriented solely; all programs featuring training in fellow-feeling, as the chief end of education; and all combinations of these, for, however such programs may be put together, an important ingredient will be missing. This ingredient is our goal of developed human capacity, and this goal is deeply based in Western thought. The developed human being, in the tradition of Western culture, is one who values wisdom, courage, temperance, justice, truth, beauty, goodness, integrity, and compassion. These are human potentialities brought to a peak of possible actualization. In another sense, they are the characteristics of an enlightened man, one possessing a luminous self-knowledge, resulting from a discriminating development of intellect, will, and feeling. They combine self-knowledge and self-fulfillment. The Western enlightenment, I suggest, remains deeply temporal. In theory, we shall identify this form of enlightenment with the final stage of life, but the quest for this goal begins in the first stage, and continues to life's end. If this is the goal, each of the other stages may be envisioned. Since Western freedom is not a freedom from the conditions of temporality, but a freedom within the flow of time, the third stage, \"the loosening of the bonds,\" will not exist separately. Nor should man's quest for freedom be separated from the life of the student. Our discussion has led to three ashramas projecting an ideal for Western life-a stage of preparation, a stage of technical competence, and a stage of enlightenment. In the Western ashramas, as we shall call them, a great weight rests upon the stage of preparation for life. In this connection the history of the phrase \"liberal arts\" is most instructive. Having its origin in Roman society where it distinguished the free man's higher education from the serving man's technological education, the phrase has gained a deepening significance through the centuries. Initially understood as the privilege of the free, these arts of the free manincluding the sciences, history, philosophy, languages and literature, and the fine artsare now understood as the way to freedom; not the effect of freedom but its cause. Freedom, then, becomes for us the attainment of a way of life, related to the development of our powers of intellect, will, and feeling-that is, an enlighted way of life. I suggest, in sum, that human competence requires both technical competence, and an understanding of the foundation of this competence in theory; that this understanding is part of the liberal arts; that it is through this tradition that the individual is enabled to understand his nature and his place, moving toward those more universal attitudes to which at last one's loyalty rightfully belongs. It is in this movement toward enlightment that some of us will become creative agents contributing items of worth to the development of our culture.\n\nJohn B.

Educating the Generalist By JOHN B. SHALLENBERGER President, Connellsville Corporation 97 T HE NEWLY appointed top manager, having ascended a ladder of specialist assignments, emerges eventually to the demands of a job quite different from any he has ever experienced, that of the generalist. Is it a foregone conclusion that a competent specialist, proven in one field after another up through the ranks, will display the other kinds of competence required for the \"total\" responsibility and \"general\" responsibility he will bear at the pinnacle? He may already have demonstrated some of the qualities of generalist by virtue of his ascendancy throughout his career toward ever broader responsibilities. But the last or perhaps final step-say from superintendent to vice president in a large company, or from executive vice president to president in a small company-is more abrupt than the earlier steps. The top manager is for the first time at the level of ultimate or total responsibility. He may discover that his education for the jobs he has held in the past has only secondary bearing on the job ahead; he may find that some of his education and experience and skill in specialized areas, for example in sales or production or law, have formed him almost indelibly into the pattern of a specialist, to his direct disadvantage in the role of generalist at the pinnacle of total responsibility. As technological change accelerates, a number of other rates increase-the rate of innovation, the rate of developing new products, the production cycle, t"
