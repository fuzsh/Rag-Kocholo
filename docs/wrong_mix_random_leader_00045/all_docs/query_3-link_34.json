        "text": "One of the things that caught my attention in this city was the fact that the streets had two names each. One is the French name, and the other is the provencal name. As I walked, I discovered a plaque dedicated to Frederic Mistral, the poet who won the Nobel Prize and reached his greatest success with the poem Mireio (Mireia or Mireille in French). Although she was not a native of this city, Saint Rémy have kept her figure. During the second half of the nineteenth century there was a revival of the language and culture of Provence, particularly traditional rural values, at the head of this movement was the poet Frederic Mistral."
