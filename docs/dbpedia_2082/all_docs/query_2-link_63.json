        "text": "Description Black & white panoramic photograph of the 56th Pioneer Infantry, Colonel A. T. Balantine, Commanding, Camp Wadsworth, Spartanburg, South Carolina, July 31st, 1918. Most of the men appear to be newly arrived recruits. They are wearing civilian clothes with hanging tags. At center are the commander, other officers and a military band. Permanent buildings and army tents are in the background. George J. Rolfs wrote a letter from Camp Wadsworth on August 4, 1918 while still in quarantine, so he is probably on the photo which belonged to him. The letter was written on the back of a photo of Camp Wadsworth 1999-0150-001.\n\nGeorge Jacob Rolfs was born May 13, 1894, son of Jacob & Augusta Draves Rolfs. He saw action in Germany during World War I. On October 21, 1919 he married Ella Albrecht. He worked as a mason and died January 26, 1955.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1919, Camp Wadsworth served as one of America's premier U.S. Army World War I National Guard Mobilization and Training Camps. First established in 1917 near Spartanburg, Spartanburg County, South Carolina and named Camp Wadsworth 18 Jul 1917, after Brigadier General James S. Wadsworth, U.S. Civil War General who was mortally wounded 6 May 1864 during the Battle of the Wilderness.\n\nCamp Wadsworth was one of sixteen U.S. Army National Guard Mobilization and Training Camps established in 1917 to train and integrate National Guard units for service in a U.S. Army division. It was established under the supervision of construction quartermaster Lt. Colonel John D. Kilpatrick on a site of about 2,000 acres. The camp was to have a capacity of about 56,000 officers and enlisted men that would become the 27th U.S. Infantry Division. The camp was completed in November 1917 at an eventual cost of $5,000,000.\n\nThe first commander of the camp was Major General John O'Ryan, NY National Guard, who formed the 27th U.S. Infantry Division and remained commander of the division until they mustered out. The New York Guard units arrived at the camp during September 1917 and the 27th was organized from these units at Camp Wadsworth on 1 Oct 1917. The 27th departed for France May-Jul 1918. Also trained at Camp Wadsworth: 6th U.S Infantry Division (10 May 1918 - 23 Jun 1918) and 96th U.S. Infantry Division (20 Oct 1918 - 7 Jan 1919)\n\nThe 56th Pioneer Infantry: Formerly 1st Heavy Maine Field Artillery. Arrived at Camp Wadsworth from Camp Greene on February 18, 1918, with 45 officers and 741 enlisted men. Commanded by Colonel Arthur Ballentine and filled to wartime strength with draftees. The regiment left Camp Wadsworth on August 30th with 3550 officers and men.\n\nTroops were organized or stationed at Camp Wadsworth, but were not a part of any division. They were sent overseas and attached to whichever American Army or Corps most needed them.\n\nAt the end of the war Camp Wadsworth became a demobilization center on 3 Dec 1918. The camp was ordered salvaged on 4 Feb 1919 and closed 25 Mar 1919. The post headquarters operated until September 1919."
