        "text": "Organisation on mobilisation\n\nOn mobilization on 2 August 1914, the Corps was restructured. The 28th Cavalry Brigade was withdrawn to form part of the 6th Cavalry Division[8] and the 29th Cavalry Brigade was broken up and its regiments assigned to the divisions as reconnaissance units. The divisions received engineer companies and other support units from the Corps headquarters. Unusually, the Corps retained its 5th Infantry brigade, making it the strongest active corps on mobilisation. In summary, XIV Corps mobilised with 30 infantry battalions, 10 machine gun companies (60 machine guns), 8 cavalry squadrons, 24 field artillery batteries (144 guns), 4 heavy artillery batteries (16 guns), 3 pioneer companies and an aviation detachment.\n\nMore information Corps, Division ...\n\nInitial wartime organization of the Corps[9] Corps Division Brigade Units XIV Corps 28th Division 55th Infantry Brigade 109th Life Grenadier Regiment 110th Grenadier Regiment 56th Infantry Brigade 40th Fusilier Regiment 111th Infantry Regiment 28th Field Artillery Brigade 14th Field Artillery Regiment 50th Field Artillery Regiment 5th JÃ¤ger zu Pferde Regiment 2nd Company, 14th Pioneer Battalion 3rd Company, 14th Pioneer Battalion 28th Divisional Pontoon Train 2nd Medical Company 29th Division 57th Infantry Brigade 113th Infantry Regiment 114th Infantry Regiment 58th Infantry Brigade 112th Infantry Regiment 142nd Infantry Regiment 84th Infantry Brigade 169th Infantry Regiment 170th Infantry Regiment 29th Field Artillery Brigade 30th Field Artillery Regiment 76th Field Artillery Regiment 22nd Dragoon Regiment 1st Company, 14th Pioneer Battalion 29th Divisional Pontoon Train 1st Medical Company 3rd Medical Company Corps Troops II Battalion, 14th Foot Artillery Regiment[10] 20th Aviation Detachment 14th Corps Pontoon Train 14th Telephone Detachment 14th Pioneer Searchlight Section Munition Trains and Columns corresponding to II Corps\n\nClose\n\nCombat chronicle\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, the Corps was assigned to the 7th Army on the left of the forces that executed the Schlieffen Plan[11] and fought in the Battle of the Frontiers. In September, it was transferred to the 6th Army. From November 1916 to March 1917, the corps took command of Group Hardaumont of the 5th Army. In March 1917, it was transferred to the 3rd Army and took command of Group Prosnes. In May, it was transferred to the 4th Army's control and took command of Group Dixmude. During this period, it fought in the Battle of Passchendaele.[12] Taking over from the XIX Corps at Wijtschate in November 1917, the XIV Corps formed a new Group Wytschaete, which it commanded until December 1917, after which it took over Group Busigny in the 6th Army. It remained in command of this group into 1918.[12]\n\nIt was still in existence at the end of the war[3] as part of the 18th Army, Heeresgruppe Deutscher Kronprinz on the Western Front.[4]"
