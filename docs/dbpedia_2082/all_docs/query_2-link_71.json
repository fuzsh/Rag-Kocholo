Action----Special Mention of Officers and Men by Various Commanding Officers.\n\nThe gallant Ninety-second Division, composed entirely of colored American troops, received a great number of citations and awards for meritorious and distinguished conduct on the battlefields of France, and besides those who earned the coveted medals there were many more members of the Division who were specially mentioned in communications from Headquarters and by the commanding officers of the various units, as appears hereafter. The lists given below, however, are necessarily incomplete, as many recommendations for awards were still under consideration when this volume went to press.\n\nThe following is reproduced from a January (1919) issue of the Army and Navy Journal:\n\n\"COLORED TROOPS OF THE A. E. F. VARIOUSLY HONORED.\n\n\"Colored troops forming the 92nd Division of the A. E. F. have recently been awarded many honors. The entire 1st battalion of the 367th Infantry have been cited for bravery and awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French military authorities.\n\n\"The citation was made because of the bravery and fine service of the battalion in the last engagement of the war, the drive toward Metz on November 10 and 11.\n\n\"Major-General Martin, U. S. A., commanding the 92nd Division, has cited a number of colored officers, noncommissioned officers and privates of the 365th Infantry for meritorious conduct in action at Bois Frehaut on 'November 10 and 11. The officers cited are Captain John L. Allen, Lieuts. Leon F. Stewart, Frank L. Drye, Walter Lyons, David W. Harris, Benjamin F. Ford, George L. Gains, and Russell C. Atkins, all U. S. A. In another order, Lieut. Nathan O. Goodloe, of the machine-gun company of the 368th Infantry, was commended for meritorious conduct in the Argonne Forest. In the entire Division, fourteen colored officers and forty-three enlisted men have been cited for bravery in action and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The total casualties suffered by the Division since its arrival in France number 1,748. Of officers, six were killed in action and one died of wounds; 46 officers were wounded and 39 gassed. Of enlisted men, 31 died of wounds, 203 were killed in action, 543 were wounded, 661 were gassed, 40 died of disease, and 28 were reported missing.\"\n\nThe following letter of commendation is self-explanatory:\n\nHEADQUARTERS FIRST BATTALION, 367TH INFANTRY\n\nFROM: Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion, 367th Infantry.\n\nTO: Commanding Officer, 367th Infantry.\n\nSUBJECT: Conduct of Company A.\n\n1. I wish to call attention of the regimental commander to the meritorious conduct of Company A on the night of November 2 and 3.\n\n2. Under intense shell fire of gas and H. S. lasting two hours, the company maintained its advanced positions, staying there without any shelter and finally repelling the enemy raid and capturing one prisoner.\n\n3. The conduct of Captain Peter McCall, his officers and men was such as deserves the highest commendation, and in my opinion merits mention.\n\n(Signed) CHARLES L. APPLETON,\n\nMajor, 367th Infantry.\n\nExtended space would be required to detail the meritorious work of the individual units of the Division throughout the several operations in which it participated. In the Argonne-Meuse offensive, after overcoming its first extreme difficulties, the 368th Infantry performed gallant service. Among the officers whose conduct was mentioned for gallantry in the Argonne, were Captain T. M. Dent, promoted after commendation for special bravery and heroism; Captain R. A. Williams, who also won commendation of his regimental commander for skillful handling of his troops in the crucial advance through the Argonne; Lieut. Charles G. Young and Captain Thomas E. Jones, of the 368th, who each won the D. S. C. for extraordinary heroic, service and gallant conduct in the Argonne Forest.\n\nOf the 367th Regiment, the unit organized and trained by Colonel James A. Moss, much could be said of its excellent record, both in the St. Die sector and in the Argonne and on the Moselle in front of Metz. In this last-named position it rendered its most distinguished service during the closing days of the war. On the 10th of November, an attack was made on Pagny, a stronghold of the German line opposite the Metz forts. In the general advance, two battalions of the, 56th Infantry, a white unit on the left of the 367th, after advancing a half mile abreast of the 367th, became hopelessly entangled in the enemy's wire entanglements and were being slaughtered by German machine-gun batteries. Our own advance was stopped, and a part of the 367th was sent to the rescue of the 56th in order to cover their withdrawal from the perilous position. The 367th dispatched two machine-gun companies, one of their own and the other from the 350th machine-gun battalion. A counter fire was turned on the German positions, which silenced their batteries, while the 56th retired leaving a third of their men dead or wounded. In the meantime the 367th held the position until relieved by reinforcements from the 56th and then resumed their advance toward Pagny. Doubtless the entire forces of the 56th would have been wiped out but for the timely rescue of the 367th. For this action the entire battalion was cited by the French commanding officer under whom the 56th was brigaded.\n\nAwarded the Distinguished Service Cross\n\nThe Distinguished Service Cross of the United States was awarded to the following officers and men of the 92nd Division, for the heroic deeds and exploits stated after their respective names:\n\nHORTON, VAN, Corporal, Company E, 366th Inf.

ATWOOD, 1974547, 325th Field Signal Battalion.\n\nThe Division Commander desires to call the attention of the entire command to the excellent work and meritorious conduct of Sergeant Rufus B. Atwood, 1974547, 325th Field Signal Battalion. On the morning of November 10, 1918, while returning to the switchboard in Pont-à-Mousson, a shell struck the house in which the switchboard was being operated, breaking all the lines. Sergeant Atwood rendered valuable assistance to the officer in charge in reconstructing the switchboard and connecting new lines under heavy shell fire. When the ammunition dump began to explode in the same neighborhood, he remained on the job, tapping new connections. After repairs were made from the first explosion, there were two to follow which completely wrecked the switchboard room and tore out all the lines which were newly fixed. Sergeant Atwood was left alone, and he established a new switchboard and the same connection they had at first. The coolness with which he went about his work and the initiative he took in handling the situation justifies his being mentioned in orders.\n\nII. PRIVATE CHARLES E. BOYKIN (Deceased), Co. \"C\" 325th Field Signal Bn.\n\nThe Division Commander desires to commend in orders the meritorious conduct of Private Charles E, Boykin, Company C, 325th Field Signal Battalion. On the afternoon of September 26, 1918, while the 368th Infantry was in action in the Argonne Forest, the Regimental Commander moved forward to establish a P. C. and came upon a number of Germans, who fled to the woods, which were found to be alive with machine guns. The Commanding Officer ordered the woods searched to the top of the hill, the officer in charge of the scouting called for volunteers, and Private Boykin, a telephone linesman, offered his services and set out with the rest of the detail. While trying to flank an enemy machine gun another opened fire, killing him instantly.\n\nBy command of Major General Martin:\n\n(Signed) ALLEN J.

F., France.\n\nSUBJECT: Decoration.\n\n1. It is with pleasure that I inform you that you have been awarded a Croix de Guerre with citation in the orders of the 157th Division. The approval of the award was received from the Personnel Section, G. H. Q., American E. F., on December 14th.\n\n2. The citation is as follows:\n\n1st Lieut. Clarence S. Janifer, M. C. Surgeon 3rd Battalion 372nd Infantry.\n\n\"Fearless to danger, established his First Aid Post on the battlefield in front of Bussy Farm September 28, 1918, following the Battalion in the open fields, giving help and relief to the wounded and dying at first hand.\"\n\nPending the receipt of the official citation from the 157th Division, this letter will serve as authority for the wearing of the Croix de Guerre with a silver star.\n\n(Signed) PRESTON F. WALSH,\n\nCaptain Infantry, U. S. A.\n\nI certify that the above letter is a true copy.\n\nT. T. THOMPSON,\n\n1st Lt., Inf., U. S. A.\n\nThere were many such commendations of individual soldiers issued during the period of the stay of the 92nd Division in France.\n\nNo officer in the 92nd Division won the respect and devotion of his men more completely than did Brigadier-General Malvern-Hill Barnum, commanding the 183rd Brigade. That General Barnum felt a deep attachment to his command is shown by the following letter addressed to the entire brigade:\n\nA. P. O. 714, France.\n\n22 December, 1918.\n\nFrom: Malvern.-Hill Barnum, Brigadier-General, U. S. A.\n\nTo: The Officers and men of the 183rd Brigade.\n\nSubject: Relief from command.\n\nThe order detaching me from command of the 183rd Brigade was unexpected and coming, as it did, just as the Brigade was moving, made it impossible for me to give expression to my regret at having to sever an association of over a year and one that will be one of the pleasantest recollections of my Army career.\n\nHaving organized and trained the 183rd Brigade and commanded it through its active service in the present war, I can speak for the willing compliance to all requirements that made the work very enjoyable. When men work with their hearts as well as their heads and hands, the best results are certain to follow.\n\nI feel that the officers and enlisted men of the Brigade may justly be proud of the record made and I believe that history will accord them no little credit.\n\nI trust that each one will do his utmost to insure to the Brigade the finest record possible during the remainder of its period of service.\n\nFinally in returning to their homes I trust that each one will take with him a high sense of responsibility as an American citizen and a keen desire to perform faithfully whatever duties fall to him in the future.\n\nWith such a heritage from his Army service each one will not only have helped win the war and thus rendered a great service to humanity, but will himself have become the gainer through the remaining years of his life.\n\n(Signed) MALVERN-HILL BARNUM.\n\nThis letter will be published to all members of the command at the earliest opportunity.\n\nBy order of Colonel Parrott.\n\n.............................Hq. 366th Infantry........................................(Signed) R.
