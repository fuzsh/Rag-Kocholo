Additionally the emblem has the welcome association with the image of the traditional lucky black cat. The badge was chosen in 1940 by the then Divisional commander, Major-General Claude F Liardet, the first Territorial Army (TA) officer to command a division. There is some doubt about whether a version exists with the cat's tail curled to the left. The badge was revived in an amended form in 1950 by 56th (London) Armoured Division TA. Until 1936 there were two London TA Divisions, 1st and 2nd (London) Divisions, respectively 56th and 47th Divisions. 2nd London/47th Division, a Second Line TA Division [qv], ceased to exist in 1936 before being re-formed as a motor division. 1st London/56th Division was a first-line Territorial Army formation in September 1939. It was organized as a Motor Division, that is with only two brigades and supporting arms decreased in proportion, but with integral transport for its infantry. It was reorganised as a standard infantry division in June 1940. On 18 November 1940 it was redesignated 56th (London) Division. It remained part of Home Forces until 1942 when it was sent to the Middle East as part of the Palestine, Syria, Iraq garrison. From 19 March to 19 April 1943 the Division moved overland some 2,300 miles to join the Central Mediterranean Forces in North Africa where it fought in the closing stages of the North African campaign. It subsequently took a leading part in the Italian campaign, including both the Salerno and Anzio landings. For the Salerno landings the Division had under command a fourth infantry brigade, (201st Guards), and although this Brigade formally left the Division in October it in fact stayed attached until the beginning of January 1944. As part of 8th Army the Division fought in the Po Valley campaign, winning the bridgehead over the Reno, and thence to Venice.\n\nObject Details\n\nCategory\n\nUniforms and insignia\n\nRelated period\n\nSecond World War (association)\n\nMaterials\n\nwhole: textile\n\nDimensions\n\nwhole: Height 49 mm, Width 36 mm\n\nCatalogue number\n\nINS 5460\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.
