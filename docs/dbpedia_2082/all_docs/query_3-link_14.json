        "text": "The history of 56th (1st London) Division\n\nThe London Division was a formation of the Territorial Force. It was formed as a result of the reforms of the army carried out in 1908 under the Secretary of State for War, Richard Burdon Haldane and was one of 14 Divisions of the peacetime TF.\n\n1914\n\nThe units of the Division had just departed for annual summer camp when emergency orders recalled them to the home base. All units were mobilised for full time war service on 5 August 1914. All of the infantry units left the Division during the period September 1914 – April 1915, most being sent independently to France as reinforcements for the BEF.\n\n1915\n\nThe Divisional artillery was selected for service in France and transferred in September 1915 to 36th (Ulster) Division.\n\n1916\n\nIn January 1916 the War Office authorised the re-formation of the London Division, now to be known as the 56th, in France.\n\nThe Division began to concentrate in the Hallencourt area on 5 February and was largely completed by 21 February. It then remained in France and Flanders and took part in the following engagements:\n\nThe diversionary attack at Gommecourt (1 July)*\n\nThe Battle of Ginchy (9 September)*\n\nThe Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15 -22 September)*\n\nThe Battle of Morval (25-27 September)* in which the Division captured Combles\n\nThe Battle of the Transloy Ridges (11 – 9 October)*\n\n* the battles marked * are phases of the Battles of the Somme 1916\n\nThe grave marker of Cedric Charles Dickens, grandson of the author Charles Dickens. A Major of the 1/13th Londons, he was killed in action on the Somme on 9 September 1916. His grave faces Leuze and Bouleux Woods, scene of the Division’s next attack, on 15 September.\n\n1917\n\nThe German retreat to the Hindenburg Line (14 March – 5 April)\n\nThe First Battle of the Scarpe (9 – 14 April)+\n\nThe Third Battle of the Scarpe (3 – 4 May)+\n\n+ the battles marked + are phases of the Battles of Arras 1917\n\nThe Battle of Langemarck (16 – 17 August)**\n\n** the battles marked ** are phases of the Third Battles of the Ypres\n\nThe capture of Tadpole Copse (21 November)^\n\nThe capture of Bourlon Wood (23 – 28 November)^\n\nThe German counter attacks (30 November – 2 December)^\n\n^ the battles marked ^ are phases of the Cambrai Operations\n\n1918\n\nThe First Battle of Arras (28 March)~\n\n~ the battles marked ~ are phases of the First Battles of the Somme 1918\n\nThe Battle of Albert (23 August)#\n\n# the battles marked # are phases of the Second Battles of the Somme 1918\n\nThe Battle of the Scarpe (26 – 30 August)+\n\n+ the battles marked + are phases of the Second Battles of Arras 1918\n\nThe Battle of the Canal du Nord (27 September – 1 October)”\n\nThe Battle of the Cambrai (8 – 9 October)”\n\n” the battles marked ” are phases of the Battles of the Hindenburg Line\n\nThe pursuit to the Selle (9 – 12 October)*\n\nThe Battle of the Sambre (4 November)*\n\nThe passage of the Grand Honelle ( 5 – 7 November)*\n\n* the battles marked * are phases of the Final Advance in Picardy\n\nBy the end of 10 November the Division had been withdrawn for rest, although the artillery was still in action up to the Armistice at 11am on 11 November. The forward infantry was on that date at Harveng.\n\nThe Division received orders to join the British force that would advance across Belgium and move into Germany to occupy the Rhine bridgeheads. These orders were cancelled on 21 November, at which time the Division was employed on road and railway repair work in the area of Harveng.\n\nIn all, the Division existed as such for 1010 days during the Great War; it spent 330 days at rest, 195 in quiet sectors, 385 in active sectors and 100 days in battle.\n\nDemobilisation began and he final cadres left for home on 18 May 1919. The Division reformed as part of the Territorial Army in April 1920.\n\nThe order of battle of the 56th (1st London) Division\n\nDivisional histories\n\n“The Fifty Sixth Division: 1914-1918” by Major C.
