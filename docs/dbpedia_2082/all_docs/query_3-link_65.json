        "text": "Forming a Battalion\n\nWhile the 2nd Rangers trained hard in the summer heat and humidity of Tennessee, Allied planners in England realized that another battalion of assault troops was needed for the D-Day invasion. This led to the formation of the 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was activated on 1 September 1943 at Camp Forrest, Tennessee. Major Owen H. Carter assumed command and chose Captain Richard P. Sullivan as the battalion executive officer. In three days they selected 34 officers and 563 enlisted men for the new unit. Many of the Ranger volunteers came from the 26th Infantry Division, a National Guard unit from New England (the “Yankee Division”), which was training at Camp Forrest.\n\nSince the unit had to be in England by the beginning of 1944, the 5th Ranger training in the United States was compressed. “The training was ten times more intense than training with the infantry. We were physically stretched to our limits and not all men passed. They were dropped,” said First Lieutenant (1LT) Charles “Ace” Parker, who transferred from the 98th Infantry Division to become a platoon leader in Able Company. After two months of accelerated combat training and hard physical conditioning, the 5th moved south by troop train to Florida. On 5 November 1943, the battalion began two weeks of amphibious training at the U.S. Navy Scout and Raiders School at Fort Pierce, FL. Once done the unit boarded trains on 20 November for Fort Dix, New Jersey.\n\nAt Fort Dix the 5th Rangers validated their fitness for combat. Long speed marches culminated in five-day tactical field problems at the company and battalion levels. Having been certified for overseas deployment the 5th Rangers “returned to camp and had a shakedown. We had our damaged equipment and clothing replaced. On 20 December, the battalion moved to Camp Kilmer [New Jersey], where all personnel were able to have six days of leave, which was rotated and limited to a distance of fifty miles,” said Staff Sergeant (SSG) Richard N. Hathaway, Jr., of Able Company.\n\nThose not sick enjoyed the voyage. “As an officer we had meal tickets for the 1st or 2nd seating [of a meal]. My roommate was seasick all of the way over. I used his ticket and ate both seatings all of the way across, I never had it so good,” said 1LT John J. Reville.\n\nThe ship made it across the Atlantic unmolested by German U-Boats and arrived in England ten days later. “The only scary moment was when we were held in the outer harbor of Liverpool, England, for twenty-four hours because the opening through the minefield was not wide enough to allow our ship to enter the inner harbor,” said SSG Hathaway. A minesweeper temporarily widened the harbor entrance to allow the ship to enter. “We docked in Liverpool on 18 January 1944 and saw for the first time the [German] bomb damage,” said Hathaway. Now in England the 5th Rangers were thrust into a demanding pre-invasion training regimen.\n\nTraining in Britain\n\nUnbeknownst to the 5th Rangers the planned invasion of Europe was just four months away. After the ship docked “we loaded a train and moved to Leominster, England, where we began extensive training in cliff scaling, rappelling, rope bridge crossings, and field exercises,” said SSG Hathaway. After two months of arduous training the unit moved by rail and ship to Tighnabrauch, Scotland for British Commando training.\n\nRangers who thought that stateside training was tough were in for a big surprise. SSG Henry S. Glassman commented: “It was this training in Scotland that the Rangers believe brought them through the invasion of France and all the difficult assignments that followed. The hills of Scotland proved to be more than anything that had been encountered before and here Rangers were made or lost.”\n\nOn the Scottish coast amphibious assault landings were practiced daily. Using Air Corps photographs of the projected Normandy landing beaches, sites with barbed wire, beach obstacles, and anti-assault landing devices had been specially prepared to train the Rangers. From different types of landing craft, the Rangers practiced the battle drill of assembling at a predesignated rally point and continuing the attack until it became second nature. “We did an awful lot of boat landings, coming in on the beach, dropping off in that ice cold water of the damn Scottish fjords, getting sopping wet and then going on to the objective,” said 1LT Parker, a platoon leader in Able Company.\n\nWhat was different from all previous Ranger training was being billeted in civilian homes. Families provided rooms for the Rangers during Commando training because barracks were short. “Every evening we were told where we were to meet for the next day’s training and what sort of training it was to be. A sandwich lunch with hot coffee was brought to us in the field, [and] often [eaten] in rain or snow,” remembered SSG Hathaway.\n\nApril 1944 was a tough month for the 5th Rangers. After finishing Commando training on 2 April, the battalion moved south to the Assault Training Center in Braunton, England. There they practiced amphibious landings in British and American landing craft in a region that closely matched the Normandy coastline.\n\nIn the midst of the hazardous training several company commanders complained about LTC Owen H. Carter’s leadership style. Technician 5th Grade James E. Kidwell recorded one incident: “No [Ranger] officer was to ask anyone to do anything he wouldn’t do. In Scotland our Battalion Commander had the entire battalion walking in a ditch chest deep in water â but he led from the bank.” Corporal Arden V. Mischke commented that, “several company commanders had lost confidence in Colonel Carter’s leadership qualities and had written a letter to higher headquarters about their problems. When Colonel Carter found out about it he shipped the officers out. Captain Heffelfinger must have been one of the officers because we had a new company commander … 1LT George Miller.”\n\nThe transfers proved to be temporary. “Within a couple of days all of the officers that had been shipped out were back with the 5th Rangers and Colonel Carter was transferred,” said Mischke. The “Captain’s Revolt” brought a new battalion commander with extensive combat experience. Major (MAJ) Max F. Schneider was one of the original company commanders of the 1st Ranger Battalion and later a battalion executive officer in Darby’s Rangers. After being wounded in Italy and medically evacuated, Schneider became LTC James E. Rudder’s 2nd Ranger Battalion executive officer. He took command on 17 April 1944.\n\nAfter Braunton, the unit moved to Swanage, England for additional training. “There we were introduced to the use of eight-foot sections of aluminum scaling ladders. We were quartered in a hotel on the top of an eighty-foot cliff. When we arrived at the beautiful wide front steps, our battalion commander [LTC Schneider] told us that we would use those stairs only once. At first none of us knew what he meant, but we soon found out. My men and I were quartered on the third floor in two rooms. In each room near the window was a coil of rope tied to a pipe. We were instructed to throw the rope out of the window, then rappel down the wall of the building to the yard, run across the yard, climb over an iron picket fence, and rappel down an eighty-foot cliff to the beach below,” said SSG Richard N. Hathaway, Jr. After just a few weeks of cliff climbing and rappelling, the 5th Rangers joined the 2nd Rangers to finalize preparations for the coming invasion.\n\nThe Normandy Invasion\n\nThe Allied plan to invade France was massive. Years of planning and training culminated on 6 June 1944. On five designated invasion beaches (Omaha, Utah, Gold, Sword, and Juno), six Allied divisions would assault into Normandy. Three airborne divisions, two American and one British, would land by parachute and glider beyond the beaches to secure routes into the interior. The combined Allied invasion force numbered over 2,800,000 men. Over 4,000 ships and almost 12,000 aircraft supported the landing. A total of 174,320 men and 20,018 vehicles had to be loaded aboard ships, airplanes, and gliders to make the D-Day assault.\n\nThe D-Day mission of the U.S. V Corps was to assault German coastal defenses on Omaha Beach and establish a beachhead three to four miles deep. The corps sector was a 6,000-yard wide stretch of beach located between Vierville and Colleville, France. Success would enable follow-on forces to push into the interior and continue the fight. The 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions, with engineer and armor attachments, would be the main assault. The Ranger Battalions, attached to the 29th Infantry Division, had a special mission on the corps right flank.\n\nOn 9 May 1944 the 2nd and 5th Ranger Battalions became the “Provisional Ranger Group” for Operation OVERLORD. Previously the European Theater G-3 (Operations) had controlled the two battalions, since there was no overarching “Ranger” headquarters. As the senior battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel James E. Rudder was designated the Ranger Group commander. The two battalions were divided into three Ranger task forces. Task Force A, made up of the 2nd Ranger Battalion’s Dog, Easy, and Fox Companies and elements of Headquarters Company, had the daunting task of destroying the six 155 mm guns at Pointe du Hoc. This mission was critical because the guns could fire on two invasion beaches, Omaha and Utah, as well as the massive invasion flotilla in the Channel. Led by LTC Rudder, Task Force A would land and use rocket-propelled grapnel secured ropes to climb the 90-foot cliffs below the guns. Simultaneously four specially-equipped amphibious DUKWs (a 2 Â½ ton amphibious truck) would land and place their fire ladders against the cliff. Once atop the cliff, the Rangers would destroy the guns and hold Pointe du Hoc until relieved.\n\nThe smallest of the Ranger units, Task Force B, was CPT Ralph Goranson’s Charlie Company, 2nd Ranger Battalion. After landing on “Charlie Sector” of Omaha Beach, Task Force B had two “be-prepared” missions. The first was to follow the assault of Able Company, 116th Infantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division, across the beach to seize Vierville and a German strongpoint at Pointe et Raz de la PercÃ©e. That element was reinforced with a platoon of amphibious tanks from Baker Company, 743rd Tank Battalion. The second contingency for the Ranger company was to attack Pointe et Raz de la PercÃ©e by climbing the cliffs, if the assault was stopped in Vierville. After clearing Pointe et Raz de la PercÃ©e, CPT Goranson would link up with LTC Rudder at Pointe du Hoc.\n\nTask Force C, commanded by LTC Max Schneider, was the largest Ranger force. The 5th Ranger Battalion and Able and Baker Companies, 2nd Rangers were the exploitation force. The eight-company force would wait offshore for a prearranged signal from LTC Rudder. The timing of the Ranger mission was critical. If the assault on Pointe du Hoc was successful, Rudder would send the message, “Praise the Lord.” Task Force C would then land at the Pointe du Hoc and move through Task Force A to secure the area and to attack Vierville from the flank. If Schneider did not receive the message by H+30 (30 minutes after the 0630 scheduled landing) or if the mission failure codeword “Tilt” was received, Task Force C would immediately land on Omaha Beach, fight its way through the Vierville draw, and then eastward to Pointe du Hoc.\n\nSince Task Force C was the exploitation force, LTC Schneider and his staff task organized the battalion with additional fire support. During the invasion, the assault units were expected to have significant casualties and were authorized fifteen percent over strength (about seventy extra men). Schneider used some of the additional manpower to form an 81 mm mortar platoon in Charlie Company and a 60 mm mortar platoon in Fox Company.\n\nIn the choppy English Channel LTC Schneider, a veteran of numerous amphibious landings, waited for the signal from Rudder. Receiving none, he ordered the flotilla to Omaha Beach at 0710, ten minutes past the deadline. Schneider was in a unique position as the only Ranger officer in his command who was a combat veteran. Off the coast he could see what was happening on the beaches and had the time, albeit a little, to evaluate the situation. He elected to land his force on the right flank of Omaha Beach, which was receiving relatively light fire (compared to the rest of the area). This decision resulted in Task Force C landing mostly intact.\n\nOn Omaha Beach the 29th Infantry Division was stalled. The troops had taken cover behind a seawall. Heavy German machinegun fire raked the beachhead. Brigadier General Norman D. Cota, the assistant division commander of the 29th, walked up to LTC Schneider and said, “We have to get the hell off this beach. Rangers, lead the way!” That was the catalyst. Soon small parties of Rangers, infantry, and engineers scrambled over the seawall to set explosive charges.\n\nOn LTC Schneider’s signal, the Rangers breached the barbed wire defenses using Bangalore torpedoes. Momentarily hidden from enemy observation by the clouds of rising smoke from the explosions and grass fires, the Rangers quickly moved through the gaps and up the hill. Dog Company, led by First Lieutenant Francis W. Dawson’s platoon, assaulted the hilltop and eliminated an enemy strongpoint, enabling the rest of the battalion to move inland. After working its way through the belt of German minefields, the battalion began attacking the formidable defenses around Vierville.\n\n1LT “Ace” Parker led Able Company, 5th Rangers to the prearranged rally point, the Chateau de Vaumicel, southwest of Vierville. When the unit stopped, Parker had only 23 men, less than half of his company. Undeterred, 1LT Parker continued on with his mission â the relief of the Rangers at Point du Hoc. On its own, the small force finally reached Rudder’s men at 2200 hours with 20 German prisoners captured during firefights along the way. However, the rest of Schneider’s force did not immediately follow.\n\nStill attached to the 116th Infantry Regiment (29th Infantry Division), Colonel Charles D. W. Canham, the regimental commander, ordered the Task Force C Rangers to assist his depleted unit in the defense of Vierville and protect the beachhead against an enemy counterattack. This mission delayed their movement to Pointe du Hoc. Once that mission was accomplished, Schneider’s force fought west to finally relieve Rudder’s battered contingent on 8 June (D+2).\n\nThe assault on Brest began on 3 September when the 5th Rangers assaulted Fort Toulbrouch, one of the many forts surrounding the harbor. Fighting was so intense that the battalion reserve had to be committed to stop a counterattack and Headquarters Company was reorganized into a rifle company and placed in reserve. The next day the 5th Rangers attacked again with coordinated artillery and air support. CPT Bernard M. Pepper’s Baker Company assaulted just 20 yards behind eight P-47 fighters strafing the German positions. “It was amazing to see the smoke and dirt and Rangers running into it and disappear out of sight. The Germans, before they could recover, found the Rangers on top of them and … the fort was captured,” said SGT Arden Mischke. The sixty-man Baker Company captured Fort Toulbrouch and over 300 prisoners within 6 minutes of the final attack. On 5 September, the entire 5th Battalion attacked Fort de Mengant supported by a platoon from Able Company, 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion. After heavy fighting, Fox Company took the fort with a bayonet charge.\n\nPulled off the line for a well earned one-day rest, the Rangers “were surprised to see two intoxicated German soldiers walking down the road toward us carrying a suitcase. When we coaxed them up to us we found the suitcase was full of French money. They told us they had robbed their supply store (Post Exchange to us),” said SGT Arden Mischke. The Germans were relieved of their money and left to sober up in a POW camp. The incident provided a brief humorous interlude from the tough fighting.\n\nHeavy fighting continued as the 5th Rangers were shifted to the Le Conquet Peninsula, west of Brest. The Germans, in anticipation of an Allied attack, had improved their defenses. “We didn’t know what to expect as we made our way to the town. Once in, it was dash from building to building, expecting any minute to be fired upon. At last, we had completed our task of securing it [Le Conquet]. At that moment there was a great rumpus and we were … ready to repulse whatever was coming. Lo and behold, here came the Free French [Forces] marching in with banners, and the populace now came out and cheered them,” said Sergeant “Baseplate” Miller. The Free French “liberated” Le Conquet at the cost of four wounded Rangers. Despite some machinegun fire from a neighboring town, the French continued their celebration into the night.\n\nThe Rangers moved along the coast reducing German fortifications. At Fort du Portzic the 5th Rangers developed a new technique to overcome the pillboxes. In the darkness of 17 September, Lieutenant James F. Greene, Jr. led an eleven-man Easy Company patrol to eliminate a pillbox that had resisted artillery, bombing, and repeated ground attacks. “We carried two 40-lb demo charges and a 50-lb charge, including 20 gallons of a gasoline and heavy oil mixture. We approached the pillbox cautiously, placed the charges around it, and started pouring our mixture into the air vents, then we all took cover … an enormous explosion followed at 2210 [hours] The pillbox erupted in bright flames, illuminating the area all around, while we watched full of awe â¦ it had worked!,” recalled Greene. The patrol suffered no casualties. The next day when the Brest garrison surrendered at 1200 hours, the 5th Rangers became the 12th U.S. Army Group reserve.\n\nConventional units fought the remainder of the campaign in Brittany. The two Ranger battalions were pulled off the line and allowed to recuperate. The 5th Rangers had suffered a 30% casualty rate (137), with 24 killed in action during its nineteen days of fighting around Brest. The Brittany Campaign received scant attention. The Allied armies were racing across France and Belgium and Field Marshall Bernard L. Montgomery’s Operation MARKET-GARDEN, the ground and airborne invasion in the Netherlands, was beginning. After Brest, the 5th Ranger Battalion was attached to Lieutenant General George S. Patton’s Third U.S. Army for the drive across France into Germany.\n\nThe assault continued and the company gained a toehold in the town. The Germans counterattacked with infantry supported by a Tiger tank. The tank smashed into a house forcing the Rangers inside to withdraw next door. From there, Corporal Andrew “Pappy” Speir fired his 2.36-inch Bazooka at the tank from the second floor. The tank fired back at him at point blank range, knocking him off his feet. He scrambled back up, unhurt, to load and fire more rockets. This went on until Ranger mortar and supporting artillery fire drove the German infantry out of town. Without ground support the tank retreated. But the fight was not over for the Rangers.\n\nOn 16 December 1944, the Germans launched a major counteroffensive in the Belgium Ardennes, known as the “Battle of the Bulge.” The Rangers, still attached to the 6th Cavalry Group, conducted screening operations to deceive the enemy as to their true size. The Ranger and cavalry patrols countered enemy patrols that probed the American lines for a weakness. On 24 December, the 5th Rangers moved to Metz to recuperate, reorganize, and refit. The battalion was then attached to the 94th Infantry Division as it attacked further into Germany.\n\nBy mid-January 1945, replacements were trained under the tutelage of veteran Rangers amidst sub-freezing temperatures and snow. Allowed to recruit fifty volunteers from rear echelon troops of the Twelfth Army Group, General Bradley said “It [the 5th Rangers] was almost trampled in the rush of a thousand applicants.” After selecting the best candidates, the 5th Ranger Battalion strength was still only 398 men and officers, still some 108 soldiers below its authorized strength. But, the unit in its depleted condition was deemed combat ready.\n\nLieutenant General Walton Walker’s XX Corps had managed to breach the Siegfried Line and needed to exploit this success. At Weiten, the 5th Rangers received the mission to infiltrate nine miles behind German lines and seize key terrain between the towns of Irsch and Zerf. At the intersection of four valleys, the road from Irsch to Zerf climbs up for two and a quarter miles eastward through open fields onto a treeless plateau. A Ranger blocking position two miles above Zerf provided an almost unobstructed view of the valley. In a double envelopment, an armored task force from the 10th Armored Division would assault from the north, while the 301st Infantry Regiment, 94th Infantry Division attacked from the west. The 301st would relieve the Rangers. Holding the plateau would prevent the enemy from using the Irsch-Zerf road network to launch counter-attacks against the American offensive and would block the best German withdrawal route from its defense along the Saar River. The Rangers had less than 24 hours to plan the operation.\n\nThe Irsch-Zerf Fight\n\nOn 23 February 1945 under cover of darkness, the battalion crossed the Saar River on a footbridge. Just before midnight, the 5th Rangers passed through the 302nd Infantry Regiment, 94th Infantry Division. Moving in two columns into enemy territory, each man was heavily burdened by extra ammunition and anti-tank mines. Night movement over the rugged, heavily wooded terrain was made more difficult by harassing enemy artillery fire and occasional ambushes. Captured Germans slowed down the Rangers. “The woods became so heavy we were confused. Then we called for artillery fire, two rounds, on our objective to help us establish our position. We listened to the rounds go over. After that we knew our position and directions,” recalled LTC Sullivan. The advance resumed through thick woods towards the objective.\n\nA break in contact between Baker and Easy Companies stopped the battalion. Patrols failed to reestablish contact between elements. Finally LTC Sullivan could not wait any longer and the unit continued movement. As a result, the separated 2nd Platoon, Baker Company would not rejoin the unit for a day, to further deplete the already under-strength battalion.\n\nAs the Rangers moved closer to the objective, contact became more frequent. Enemy patrols blundered into the Ranger formation and more prisoners were taken. The number grew to 110, further slowing movement. The Rangers happened upon a German aid station. “A doctor with a nice white medical vehicle who when captured said, ‘This is 4000 yards behind the lines â No, no! â you can’t be here!” recalled LTC Sullivan. “He stayed with us the next four days taking care of our wounded and the wounded Germans and did a good job.”\n\nThe Germans had no idea a battalion was moving behind their lines. By 0800 hours on 25 February, advanced elements of the battalion had reached the objective. LTC Sullivan ordered the companies to set up their defense as planned. Forming an egg-shaped defensive perimeter 200 yards wide and 1,000 yards long, the Rangers effectively blocked the Irsch-Zerf road on the plateau.\n\nOnce discovered, the Germans counterattacked the Rangers with rockets, artillery, and infantry. “We saw a Kraut SP [self-propelled gun] coming down the road from the west. The crew, upon seeing us, jumped out and ran like hell before we could get to them. We fired a bazooka [at it] but it didn’t seem to damage the SP. We finally poured gasoline on it and burned it,” said LTC Sullivan. “From that point we had trouble.” With ammunition, water, food, and medical supplies running low, a 94th Infantry Division artillery spotter aircraft dropped some supplies into the defensive perimeter. “I radioed … that we could probably hold out if someone came through to relieve us within 48 hours. I told them we did not have to eat, but we must have enough ammo for 48 hours. Our communications were also running out because of weak [radio] batteries,” said LTC Sullivan. The Germans launched repeated counterattacks to dislodge the Rangers.\n\nThe next day Task Force Riley (10th Armored Division) managed to reach the Rangers. With them was 1LT Louis J. Gambosi’s “lost” platoon (2nd Platoon, Baker Company). Gambosi had joined Task Force Riley, aboard its half-tracks and cleared three roadblocks for the armored element as it fought toward the beleaguered battalion. The reinforcements did not bring relief to the Rangers as planned.\n\nInstead, the Rangers received orders to attack further into Germany attached to the 301st Infantry Regiment. The 301st Infantry brought food, ammunition, and water for the Rangers. To boost its firepower, a platoon of tanks, a platoon of tank destroyers, and a section (two) of anti-aircraft “quad” .50 caliber machineguns on halftracks were attached to the battalion.\n\nThe next morning, the Ranger Battalion repositioned to higher ground further to the south to create a stronger defensive position. The Germans repeatedly counterattacked. The heavy artillery bombardments were brutal. During one attack on 1 March, the Baker Company commander, Captain Bernard M. Pepper, said that in one platoon alone, “10 men were casualties during the first 15 minutes of this fire. Only the platoon leader [1LT Gambosi], a radio man, and one rifleman remained [uninjured].” Finally, on 3 March it was over. The two-day defensive mission had lasted nine days and bled the 5th Battalion dry. Captain Charles H. Parker, the Able Company commander, reported that: “A Co. came out of this operation with one officer and 24 men. F Co. came out with two officers and 18 men.” Casualties for the battle at Irsch-Zerf were heavy for the battalion; 34 killed, 140 wounded, and 12 missing, putting the unit strength at only 212 men. Although seriously depleted from sustained combat, the 5th Ranger Battalion continued to serve.\n\nEpilogue\n\nThe World War II Rangers simply faded away during demobilization. For the next five years the Army was preoccupied with the postwar occupation and defense of Germany, Japan, and Austria from Communism. Constabulary and military government units assumed the post-conflict missions. Faced with budget cuts in early 1950, the Army eliminated units, delayed purchases of new equipment, and deferred maintenance on old equipment. Everything changed in late June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea.\n\nRealizing the need for Ranger-type units in Korea, the Army Chief of Staff General J. Lawton Collins ordered the formation of a Ranger Training Center at Fort Benning, Georgia. In October 1950 the first “Airborne Ranger” Infantry Companies began training at Fort Benning, Georgia. Several of these companies went to Korea to carry the Ranger legacy forward. However, in a surprising move the Army decided to deactivate the units in August 1951. Only the Ranger Training Center (later the Ranger Department of the Infantry School) was retained as a small unit leadership training course.\n\nThe Rangers were reborn in 1974 when the Army Chief of Staff, General Creighton W. Abrams, directed the formation of two Ranger battalions. The 1st Battalion (Ranger), 75th Infantry was activated at Fort Benning, Georgia on 31 January 1974 and the 2nd Battalion (Ranger), 75th Infantry at Fort Lewis, Washington on 1 October 1974. Both Ranger battalions spearheaded the invasion of Grenada on 25 October 1983. Following that success, the Army created a Ranger Regimental headquarters in July 1984, commanded by Colonel Wayne A. Downing. The 3rd Ranger Battalion was activated at Fort Benning, Georgia in October 1984. The first Ranger Regimental mission was Operation JUST CAUSE, where it conducted combat parachute assaults on Rio Hato airfield and the Torrijos-Tocumen Airport in Panama on 19 December 1989.\n\nThe author would like to thank Major General (Retired) John C.
