        "text": "For this very reason, “Avalanche” stumbled early. On September 9th, US 5th Army under General Mark W. Clark landed near Salerno, 150 miles up the western coast of the Italian boot. Since Italy had surrendered, Clark expected only light opposition, perhaps a few coastal defense units who hadn’t gotten the memo, but nothing serious.\n\nHe was as confused as anyone, therefore, when his troops ran into searing fire from the moment they hit the beach. Expecting Italians, Clark had met the Germans. The adversary was a veteran, battle-tested unit, the 16th Panzer Division, dug into strongpoints along the beach at Salerno, with artillery emplaced on the high ground. Clark’s shaken army managed to land, but the unexpected resistance penned it into a shallow, vulnerable semicircle along the coast.\n\nClark’s force was soon in big trouble. He had only three divisions on land (the 46th and 56th British on his left, U.S. 36th), with another U.S. division—the 45th--on the way, but the Germans moved quickly, rushing no fewer than six divisions to the sector in the first two days. As their iron ring tightened around Clark’s beachhead, it was just a matter of time before they launched a great counterstroke of their own.\n\nThat’s just what happened on day three: a powerful strike against the center of Clark’s line, concentrating on the valley of the small Sele River. As the Germans lunged forward, American resistance seemed to melt away. Assault columns of the 16th Panzer Division smashed one U.S. battalion, inflicting 500 casualties and taking hundreds of prisoners. Some American units tried to rally, and a brutal fight raged around a group of stone warehouses known as the Tobacco Factory. But the Germans had the momentum, and by evening their tanks were less than a mile from the sea. All that stood in their way was a motley U.S. force: a pair of artillery battalions, a few tank destroyers, a gaggle of rear echelon cooks and truck drivers, all standing, we might say, in the last ditch.\n\nThat night, the German commander wrote in his diary that “the battle of Salerno appears to be over.” His attacks had apparently crumpled the American beachhead. On the other side of the lines, General Clark was a worried man. He knew he’d “barely escaped disaster,\" and was thinking of evacuating the beachhead. Critics have accused him of having a case of the jitters.\n\nClark didn’t evacuate, however, and in the end, he didn’t have to. U.S. forces might still be unsteady in the field, but they had one advantage they were only starting to exploit: the industrial might of their homeland. The workshops and factories of the “arsenal of democracy” were already in high gear by 1943, churning out guns and tanks and aircraft in vast abundance, and providing the U.S. military with a level of firepower that no other contemporary force could match.\n\nSo it was at Salerno. Starting on the fourth day, the Americans (with steady assistance from their British allies) began to lay on the heavy metal. Army artillery on land, naval bombardment from the USS Philadelphia and USS Boise at sea, aerial bombing from heavy B-17 Flying Fortress bombers of the U.S. Army Air Forces: all poured a rain of death down on the Germans, preventing them from regaining their momentum and crushing Clark’s beachhead. One German commander at Salerno actually complained of the “unequal fight” his man had endured, and the phrase seems apt."
