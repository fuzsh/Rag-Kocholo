        "text": "King John\n\nReal Name\n\nKing John\n\nBorn\n\nDecember 24, 1166\n\nDied\n\nOctober 19, 1216\n\nHistorical Background[]\n\nJohn was the King of England from 1199 until his death in 1216. He lost the Duchy of Normandy and most of his other French lands to King Philip II of France, resulting in the collapse of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the French Capetian dynasty during the 13th century. The baronial revolt at the end of John's reign led to the sealing of Magna Carta, a document considered an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom.\n\nJohn was the youngest son of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was nicknamed John Lackland because he was not expected to inherit significant lands. He became Henry's favorite child following the failed revolt of 1173–1174 by his brothers Henry the Young King, Richard, and Geoffrey against the King. John was appointed Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent. He unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against the royal administrators of his brother, King Richard, while Richard was participating in the Third Crusade, but he was proclaimed king after Richard died in 1199.\n\nLegend & Folklore[]\n\nAccording to popular legend, Prince John was a cruel tyrant demanding unreasonable taxes from Richard's subjects, while the people longed for the return of their pious and honorable king, who was initially unaware of John's treacherous tendencies, and his desire to usurp the throne. Many heroes, including Robin Hood, rose up to fight Prince John while Richard was away.\n\nIn the story of Ivanhoe, Richard returned to England, hiding his identity from Prince John as the mysterious Black Knight. Later, King Richard aided Robin Hood in saving Ivanhoe and his companions from the castle.\n\nPublic Domain Comic Appearances[]\n\nBlue Ribbon Comics #4, 7, 9-15\n\nRobin Hood (1955) #1-5\n\nNew Fun Comics #3-5\n\nMore Fun Comics #19-20, 27-28\n\nJumbo Comics #47\n\nRobin Hood & His Merry Men #28\n\nIvanhoe (1963) #1\n\nPublic Domain Literary Appearances[]\n\nIvanhoe (1820)\n\nCœur de Lion (1822)\n\nThe Talisman (1825)\n\nPublic Domain Stage Appearances[]\n\nRichard Coeur-de-lion (1784)\n\nRiccardo Primo (1719)\n\nPublic Domain Film Appearances[]\n\nRobin Hood (1912)\n\nIvanhoe (1913)\n\nRobin Hood (1913)\n\nRobin Hood (1922)\n\nSee Also[]"
