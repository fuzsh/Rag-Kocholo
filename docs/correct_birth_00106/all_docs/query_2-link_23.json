        "text": "English: nickname from Middle English king âkingâ (Old English cyning, cyng), perhaps acquired by someone with kingly qualities or as a pageant name by someone who had acted the part of a king or had been chosen as the master of ceremonies or âkingâ of an event such as a tournament, festival or folk ritual. In North America, the surname King has absorbed several European cognates and equivalents with the same meaning, for example German KÃ¶nig (see Koenig ) and KÃ¼ng, French Roy , Slovenian, Croatian, or Serbian Kralj , Polish Krol . It is also very common among African Americans. It is also found as an artificial Jewish surname."
