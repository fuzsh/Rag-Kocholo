        "text": "John KING OF ENGLAND (1167-1216)\n\nSecond Generation\n\n2. Henry III KING OF ENGLAND, son of John Lackland KING OF ENGLAND and Isabelle Tallefer of Angouleme, was born on 1 October 1207 in Winchester. He was a Monarch. He died on 16 November 1272 in London. He married Eleanor de Provence.\n\nEleanor de Provence and Henry III KING OF ENGLAND had the following children:\n\n+4\n\nEdward I KING OF ENGLAND (1239-1307)\n\n+5\n\nEleanor of England ( - )\n\n+6\n\nEdmund, 1st Earl of Lancaster (1245- )\n\nThird Generation\n\n5. Eleanor of England was the daughter of Henry III KING OF ENGLAND and Eleanor de Provence.\n\n6. Edmund, 1st Earl of Lancaster, son of Henry III KING OF ENGLAND and Eleanor de Provence, was born in 1245. He appeared in the census. He married Blanche of ARTOIS.\n\nEdmund had the earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester and Derby. At his death they were inherited by his eldest son Thomas.\n\nEdmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster (January 16, 1245 ?June 5, 1296) was the second surviving son of Eleanor of Provence and King Henry III of England.\n\nEdmund was born in London, England. He was a younger brother of Edward I of England and Eleanor of England.\n\nIn 1253 he was invested by Pope Innocent IV in the Kingdom of Sicily and Apulia. At about this time he was also made Earl of Chester. These were of little value as Conrad IV of Germany, the real King of Sicily, was still living and the Earldom of Chester was transferred to his elder brother Edward.\n\nEdmund soon obtained, however, important possessions and dignities, for soon after the forfeiture of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester in 1265, Edmund received the Earldom of Leicester and of Lancaster and also the honour of the Stewardship of England and the lands of Nicolas de Segrave.\n\nIn 1271 he accompanied his elder brother Edward on the Ninth Crusade to Palestine. It was because of this he received the nickname Crouchback (or cross back) indicating that he was entitled to wear a cross on his back.\n\nHe was married twice, first to Aveline de Forz, Countess of Albemarle, in 1269, and then in Paris, France on February 3, 1276, to Blanche of Artois. That same year he became the Count of Champagne and Brie in France. With Blanche he had four children:\n\n* Thomas Plantagenet, Second Earl of Lancaster (b. 1278)\n\n* Henry Plantagenet, 3rd Earl of Lancaster (b. 1281)\n\n* John Plantagenet, Lord of Beaufort, (b. BEF 1286)\n\n* Mary Plantagenet\n\nHe died on June 5, 1296 in Bayonne, and was interred on July 15, 1296 at Westminster Abbey, London, England.\n\nBlanche of ARTOIS, daughter of Robert I, Count of Artois (1216-1249) and Matilda of BRABANT (c. 1225-1288), was born circa 1250. She married Henry KING OF NAVARRE in 1269. She died on 2 May 1302. She and Edmund, 1st Earl of Lancaster had the following children:\n\n7. Helen of Wales, daughter of Llywelyn \"Mawr\" ap Iorwerth PRINCE OF NORTH WALES The Great and Joan PLANTAGENET, died after [Julian] February 1294. She married Donald MAR."
