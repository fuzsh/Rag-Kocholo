        "text": "Oxford Inscriptions: Beaumont Palace site\n\nNEAR TO THIS SITE\n\nSTOOD THE KING’S HOUSES\n\nLATER KNOWN AS\n\nBEAUMONT PALACE\n\nKING RICHARD I\n\nWAS BORN HERE IN 1157\n\nAND KING JOHN IN 1167\n\nThis stone set into the wall at the west end of Beaumont Street is understood to have been erected by Alan Brown, a former Vice-Provost of Worcester College.\n\nIt was restored by Worcester College in 2004, after it was hit by a vehicle in 2003 and left lying in the hedge of 24 Beaumont Street.\n\nBeaumont Palace was built outside Oxford’s North Gate in c.1130 by King Henry I (Henry Beauclerc), and he came to stay here at Easter 1133, celebrating the birth of his grandson, the future Henry II..\n\nKing Richard I (also known as Richard the Lionheart), the third of the five sons of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, was definitely born here at Beaumont Palace in 1157, but there is some doubt about whether his younger brother King John was also born here.\n\nEdward I was the last king to use it as a palace, and in 1275 it became a private dwelling when he granted it to an Italian lawyer, Francesco Accorsi, who had undertaken diplomatic missions for him.\n\nBy the middle of the fourteenth century the Sheriffs had permission to remove stone and timber from the palace to repair the castle, and in 1318 the remaining buildings were granted to the Carmelite friars.\n\nAbove: Painting of the remains of Beaumont Palace in 1785\n\nBelow: Engraving of the remains of Beaumont Palace as they appeared in 1800"
