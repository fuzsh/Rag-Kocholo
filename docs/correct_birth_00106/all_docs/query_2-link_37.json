        "text": "Scene 2\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe rebellious English nobles swear to support the Dauphin in his attack on England. Pandulph tells the Dauphin to take his army back to France, since John has submitted to the Pope, but the Dauphin refuses. The Bastard is pleased that the Dauphin wants war, and announces that John is close by with his army.\n\nEnter, in arms, ⌜Louis the⌝ Dauphin, Salisbury, Melun,\n\nPembroke, Bigot, ⌜and French and English⌝ Soldiers.\n\nDAUPHIN, ⌜handing a paper to Melun⌝\n\n2231 My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,\n\n2232 And keep it safe for our remembrance.\n\n2233 Return the precedent to these lords again,\n\n2234 That having our fair order written down,\n\n2235 5 Both they and we, perusing o’er these notes,\n\n2236 May know wherefore we took the Sacrament,\n\n2237 And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.\n\nSALISBURY\n\n2238 Upon our sides it never shall be broken.\n\n2239 And, noble dauphin, albeit we swear\n\n2240 10 A voluntary zeal and unurged faith\n\n2241 To your proceedings, yet believe me, prince,\n\n2242 I am not glad that such a sore of time\n\n2243 Should seek a plaster by contemned revolt\n\n2244 And heal the inveterate canker of one wound\n\n2245 15 By making many. O, it grieves my soul\n\n2246 That I must draw this metal from my side\n\n2247 To be a widow-maker! O, and there\n\n2248 Where honorable rescue and defense\n\n2249 Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!\n\n2250 20 But such is the infection of the time\n\n2251 That for the health and physic of our right,\n\n2252 We cannot deal but with the very hand\n\n2253 Of stern injustice and confusèd wrong.\n\np. 179\n\n2254 And is ’t not pity, O my grievèd friends,\n\n2255 25 That we, the sons and children of this isle,\n\n2256 Was born to see so sad an hour as this,\n\n2257 Wherein we step after a stranger, march\n\n2258 Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up\n\n2259 Her enemies’ ranks? I must withdraw and weep\n\n2260 30 Upon the spot of this enforcèd cause,\n\n2261 To grace the gentry of a land remote,\n\n2262 And follow unacquainted colors here.\n\n2263 What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove,\n\n2264 That Neptune’s arms, who clippeth thee about,\n\n2265 35 Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself\n\n2266 And ⌜grapple⌝ thee unto a pagan shore,\n\n2267 Where these two Christian armies might combine\n\n2268 The blood of malice in a vein of league,\n\n2269 And not to spend it so unneighborly.⌜He weeps.⌝\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n2270 40 A noble temper dost thou show in this,\n\n2271 And great affections wrestling in thy bosom\n\n2272 Doth make an earthquake of nobility.\n\n2273 O, what a noble combat hast ⌜thou⌝ fought\n\n2274 Between compulsion and a brave respect!\n\n2275 45 Let me wipe off this honorable dew\n\n2276 That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks.\n\n2277 My heart hath melted at a lady’s tears,\n\n2278 Being an ordinary inundation,\n\n2279 But this effusion of such manly drops,\n\n2280 50 This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,\n\n2281 Startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed\n\n2282 Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven\n\n2283 Figured quite o’er with burning meteors.\n\n2284 Lift up thy brow, renownèd Salisbury,\n\n2285 55 And with a great heart heave away this storm.\n\n2286 Commend these waters to those baby eyes\n\n2287 That never saw the giant world enraged,\n\n2288 Nor met with fortune other than at feasts\n\np. 181\n\n2289 Full warm of blood, of mirth, of gossiping.\n\n2290 60 Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep\n\n2291 Into the purse of rich prosperity\n\n2292 As Louis himself.—So, nobles, shall you all,\n\n2293 That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.\n\n2294 And even there, methinks, an angel spake.\n\nEnter Pandulph.\n\n2295 65 Look where the holy legate comes apace\n\n2296 To give us warrant from the hand of ⌜God,⌝\n\n2297 And on our actions set the name of right\n\n2298 With holy breath.\n\nPANDULPH 2299 Hail, noble prince of France.\n\n2300 70 The next is this: King John hath reconciled\n\n2301 Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in\n\n2302 That so stood out against the holy Church,\n\n2303 The great metropolis and See of Rome.\n\n2304 Therefore thy threat’ning colors now wind up,\n\n2305 75 And tame the savage spirit of wild war\n\n2306 That, like a lion fostered up at hand,\n\n2307 It may lie gently at the foot of peace\n\n2308 And be no further harmful than in show.\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n2309 Your Grace shall pardon me; I will not back.\n\n2310 80 I am too high-born to be propertied,\n\n2311 To be a secondary at control,\n\n2312 Or useful servingman and instrument\n\n2313 To any sovereign state throughout the world.\n\n2314 Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars\n\n2315 85 Between this chastised kingdom and myself\n\n2316 And brought in matter that should feed this fire;\n\n2317 And now ’tis far too huge to be blown out\n\n2318 With that same weak wind which enkindled it.\n\n2319 You taught me how to know the face of right,\n\n2320 90 Acquainted me with interest to this land,\n\n2321 Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart.\n\np. 183\n\n2322 And come you now to tell me John hath made\n\n2323 His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?\n\n2324 I, by the honor of my marriage bed,\n\n2325 95 After young Arthur claim this land for mine.\n\n2326 And now it is half conquered, must I back\n\n2327 Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?\n\n2328 Am I Rome’s slave? What penny hath Rome borne?\n\n2329 What men provided? What munition sent\n\n2330 100 To underprop this action? Is ’t not I\n\n2331 That undergo this charge? Who else but I,\n\n2332 And such as to my claim are liable,\n\n2333 Sweat in this business and maintain this war?\n\n2334 Have I not heard these islanders shout out\n\n2335 105“Vive le Roi” as I have banked their towns?\n\n2336 Have I not here the best cards for the game\n\n2337 To win this easy match played for a crown?\n\n2338 And shall I now give o’er the yielded set?\n\n2339 No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.\n\nPANDULPH\n\n2340 110 You look but on the outside of this work.\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n2341 Outside or inside, I will not return\n\n2342 Till my attempt so much be glorified\n\n2343 As to my ample hope was promisèd\n\n2344 Before I drew this gallant head of war\n\n2345 115 And culled these fiery spirits from the world\n\n2346 To outlook conquest and to win renown\n\n2347 Even in the jaws of danger and of death.\n\n⌜A trumpet sounds.⌝\n\n2348 What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?\n\nEnter Bastard.\n\nBASTARD\n\n2349 According to the fair play of the world,\n\n2350 120 Let me have audience. I am sent to speak,\n\n2351 My holy lord of Milan, from the King.\n\np. 185\n\n2352 I come to learn how you have dealt for him,\n\n2353 And, as you answer, I do know the scope\n\n2354 And warrant limited unto my tongue.\n\nPANDULPH\n\n2355 125 The Dauphin is too willful-opposite\n\n2356 And will not temporize with my entreaties.\n\n2357 He flatly says he’ll not lay down his arms.\n\nBASTARD\n\n2358 By all the blood that ever fury breathed,\n\n2359 The youth says well! Now hear our English king,\n\n2360 130 For thus his royalty doth speak in me:\n\n2361 He is prepared—and reason too he should.\n\n2362 This apish and unmannerly approach,\n\n2363 This harnessed masque and unadvisèd revel,\n\n2364 This unheard sauciness and boyish troops,\n\n2365 135 The King doth smile at, and is well prepared\n\n2366 To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,\n\n2367 From out the circle of his territories.\n\n2368 That hand which had the strength, even at your door,\n\n2369 To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,\n\n2370 140 To dive like buckets in concealèd wells,\n\n2371 To crouch in litter of your stable planks,\n\n2372 To lie like pawns locked up in chests and trunks,\n\n2373 To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out\n\n2374 In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake\n\n2375 145 Even at the crying of your nation’s crow,\n\n2376 Thinking this voice an armèd Englishman—\n\n2377 Shall that victorious hand be feebled here\n\n2378 That in your chambers gave you chastisement?\n\n2379 No! Know the gallant monarch is in arms,\n\n2380 150 And like an eagle o’er his aerie towers\n\n2381 To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.—\n\n2382 And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,\n\n2383 You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb\n\n2384 Of your dear mother England, blush for shame!\n\n2385 155 For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids\n\np. 187\n\n2386 Like Amazons come tripping after drums,\n\n2387 Their thimbles into armèd gauntlets change,\n\n2388 Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts\n\n2389 To fierce and bloody inclination.\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n2390 160 There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace.\n\n2391 We grant thou canst outscold us. Fare thee well.\n\n2392 We hold our time too precious to be spent\n\n2393 With such a brabbler.\n\nPANDULPH 2394 Give me leave to speak.\n\nBASTARD\n\n2395 165 No, I will speak.\n\nDAUPHIN 2396 We will attend to neither.\n\n2397 Strike up the drums, and let the tongue of war\n\n2398 Plead for our interest and our being here.\n\nBASTARD\n\n2399 Indeed, your drums being beaten will cry out,\n\n2400 170 And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start\n\n2401 An echo with the clamor of thy drum,\n\n2402 And even at hand a drum is ready braced\n\n2403 That shall reverberate all as loud as thine.\n\n2404 Sound but another, and another shall,\n\n2405 175 As loud as thine, rattle the welkin’s ear\n\n2406 And mock the deep-mouthed thunder. For at hand,\n\n2407 Not trusting to this halting legate here,\n\n2408 Whom he hath used rather for sport than need,\n\n2409 Is warlike John, and in his forehead sits\n\n2410 180 A bare-ribbed Death, whose office is this day\n\n2411 To feast upon whole thousands of the French.\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n2412 Strike up our drums to find this danger out.\n\nBASTARD\n\n2413 And thou shalt find it, dauphin, do not doubt.\n\nThey exit."
