        "text": "Our guaranteed check-in time is 15:00. Check-out is until 11:00.\n\nEarly arrivals are welcome to store luggage at the hotel reception or provide an early check-in if a room is already available. A late checkout can be requested, but is always based upon availability and additional fees may apply. Late checkouts are charged at an hourly rate of £50.00, and late departure after 2 pm will incur a late departure fee equal to the nightly rate of the day. Please contact reception at your earliest convenience should you wish to request this.\n\nIn An Emergency…\n\nDial 999 for the police, fire or ambulance service. The John Radcliffe Hospital (JR) is the closest emergency room to our hotel.\n\nNearest Health Services\n\nWoodstock Road Chemist is the closest pharmacy to the hotel, just a five-minute walk away. If you are heading in the other direction towards the High Street, we recommend Boots Pharmacy. They both provide non-urgent medical advice and offer a variety of over-the-counter medications. In case of urgent medical assistance or advice, NHS 111 is available 24/7, 365 days a year; however, please be aware that NHS treatment is free only for UK residents. For those seeking private GP appointments on a walk-in basis, the Mayfield Clinic on Banbury Road comes highly recommended.\n\nTravelling From Abroad?\n\nBefore travelling to the UK, it’s crucial to check whether you require a visa based on your nationality. Stay informed about the latest entry requirements by visiting the official UK website. Additionally, ensure a smooth stay by packing adaptors for your electric appliances, as UK power sockets use three-prong plugs distinct from EU and US connections. When it comes to currency exchange, the city centre offers numerous options. Consider exchanging currency at the conveniently located exchange office, Oxford Post Office & Travel Money. Alternatively, several banks in the vicinity also provide currency exchange services for your convenience.\n\nGuest Wellbeing & Safety Procedures\n\nOur reception team is available 24/7 to assist you, with managers trained in basic first aid and mental health support. In case of an emergency, guests can use the phones provided in the rooms to contact our reception directly. Weekly fire alarm tests are conducted, and you can find a floor plan detailing the fire escape route behind every bedroom door. We also prioritise maintaining a high level of customer service and disability awareness among our staff, ensuring a welcoming and inclusive environment for all guests.\n\nThe Old Parsonage warmly welcomes families with children of all ages, offering spacious rooms and suites tailored to accommodate the whole family. Our child-friendly amenities include a variety of children’s books in our resident’s library, engaging board games, The Oxford Collection coloring book with crayons or pencils, and the option to purchase Colin the teddy bear. Families can also enjoy our exclusive bespoke children’s welcome pack, available with our Family InSpires package. Our family-oriented facilities and services encompass babysitting (at an additional cost), complimentary cots, and extra beds for children up to 16 years old (at £65 per day). Additionally, Parsonage Grill features a specially crafted children’s menu.\n\nFor delightful family outings in Oxford’s outdoors, explore our curated list of handpicked things to do.\n\nEnjoy seamless connectivity during your stay with our high-speed Wi-Fi. Whether you’re here for work or leisure, our reliable network ensures easy browsing, streaming, and staying in touch with those important to you. Simply connect to the ‘Guest Wi-fi’ network for quick access. We are dedicated to keeping you online, ensuring you make the most of your time with us. For business needs, meetings, conferences, and events, enquire with our reservation and reception teams for access to our dedicated conference network."
