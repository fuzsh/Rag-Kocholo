Why can’t England’s men win at their own game?\n\nThe team has the worst track record for penalties in the world, and manager Gareth Southgate knows he needs to open his mind and face up to the years of hurt to take team and country back to the promised land.\n\nWith the upcoming European Championship front of mind, writer James Graham (Punch, Nottingham Playhouse; Sherwood, BBC) and director Rupert Goold (Patriots, Cold War, Almeida Theatre) bring the story into 2024, with an updated version of this ‘thrilling’ (Sunday Times) examination of both nation and game."
