That has posed modern historians with a dilemma.\n\nAfter all, few figures in history are entirely “good” or wholly ”bad”, and there have been occasional attempts to rehabilitate John’s reputation. But 800 years of character assassination suggests there’s little hope now of markedly improving his image.\n\nPossessing the fierce Angevin temper which is described as a dominant Plantagenet family trait, John had also inherited the red hair and grey eyes of his forebears. Indeed, he inherited much more than merely the crown from Henry II and was short, stocky and prone to bouts of intense rage like his father [2].\n\nJohn was demonised by two powerful groups who wielded much influence on history and how it was written. The medieval monks portrayed him as a monster, swayed by the king’s bitter dispute with papal authority. And the rich and powerful of England weren’t overly keen on him either, because of the two certainties in life he wreaked upon them – death and taxes.\n\nEarly life & family\n\nKing John of England was born in Oxford at Christmas time in 1167. He was the youngest surviving son of King Henry II of England and Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine [2].\n\nJohn’s early life may well have influenced his later vengeful actions. Born into a fractious family soon to implode in rebellion and accession claims, the Plantagenet dynasties were built upon constantly shifting sands of shaky political alliances.\n\nAs the fourth child, there was precious little left for John to inherit, a situation which gave rise to his father nicknaming his youngest, Jean Sans-terre, or “John Lackland” – a moniker which stuck [2].\n\nJohn’s mother and father drifted apart after his birth and their relationship soon spectacularly disintegrated. Eleanor abandoned Henry II in support of her elder sons who led the Great Revolt of 1173-74.\n\nAs his brothers and his mother rose up against Henry II, John spent the conflict travelling with his father and naturally became the “favourite” son. Lands soon followed as did the title Lord of Ireland.\n\nAt the age of 12, John was married to Isabella, the heiress to Gloucester and daughter of a close ally of Henry II. The couple were close enough cousins for their marriage to be declared null by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Pope granted a dispensation but forbade sexual relations [3].\n\nThe marriage managed to last ten years but once John spotted an opportunity that meant ditching his princess would aid his ascent to the throne, he sought an annulment. Isabella never became queen but was probably just delighted to get away from her husband.\n\nThe Lionheart years\n\nAfter the death of Henry II, John initially made sure he was close to his brother who became Richard I. Their elder brothers had all died young. But once the “Lionheart” took off on another crusade, his younger sibling made the most of his glorious chance for power and set himself up as ruler with his own court.\n\nJohn’s next few years were spent positioning himself as regent and heir to the throne, though he could have saved himself a whole load of trouble with a little patience.\n\nOnce Richard returned from his eventful adventure, fighting between forces loyal to both brothers broke out, only for the Lionheart to drop down dead from gangrene in 1199 and hand his younger sibling the throne he had coveted for so long.\n\nJohn as king\n\nAfter Richard’s death there had actually been another claim to the throne, that of Arthur, son of John’s elder brother Geoffrey. Even worse, medieval laws offered little guidance on the matter. So more fighting commenced before everyone came back together for protracted peace talks and Arthur disappeared, presumed murdered by John.\n\nHistory would have been kinder to John had his reign been marked by progress at home and military success. But as it is, he managed to lose most of the empire his father had built up and became increasingly unpopular in England due to his manic requirement for raising taxes.\n\nJohn’s personal life adds little to his reputation either. During his first marriage there were continued allegations of the king forcing himself upon the wives of nobles, an unthinkable sin in an era when monarchs were assumed to take mistresses, but at least had the decency to do so from lower-ranking women.\n\nJohn took a second wife in Isabella of Angouleme, when she was as young as nine – immature even for the age – and the couple had five children who would later leave their own marks on history, so their father’s loins did at least leave some legacy.\n\nThe Magna Carta\n\nA protracted dispute with papal authority marred John’s later reign, though the Pope would later become a firm supporter before the king died. Further trouble with France followed but it was a baronial uprising which brought about John’s most significant contribution to English history.\n\nAs a rebel army marched on London, John needed a means of pacifying the leaders who had taken significant northern towns and were gaining support in the capital. The Archbishop of Canterbury was tasked with mediating peace talks and a charter was drawn up in 1215 to address baronial complaints and form a proposal for further reform.\n\nThis would become the Magna Carta, but John was not really inclined to implement its principles and after the Pope agreed with the king and the agreement failed, war followed. Initially, John enjoyed success in waging battle on the barons, but a nasty bout of dysentery hampered his progress and he would die within weeks of contracting the disease.\n\nKing John’s true legacy was that his death paved the way for reviving the Magna Carta which was reaffirmed as a basis for the future government as civil war fizzled out.\n\nThe great treaty which has given us the principles that all are subject to the law, the right to a fair trial and even the standardisation of weights and measures was refined and reinterpreted by later generations and its significance is still felt today [4].\n\nKing John’s other true legacy is that there has never been another King John. No royal family has ever felt inclined to create a John II. Perhaps that says it all.\n\nSources:\n\n[1] Turner, Ralph V. (2009) King John: England’s Evil King? Stroud UK. History Press.
