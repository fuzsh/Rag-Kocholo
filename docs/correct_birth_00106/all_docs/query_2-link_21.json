        "text": "Narrator:\n\nKing John was king of England from 1199 to 1216. He is often remembered as a cruel and power-hungry king whose reign ended in the middle of a disastrous civil war with the barons of England. Stories written after his reign helped create this view. Shakespeare wrote a play in the 16th century where the character of King John was weak and murderous.\n\nTales of the outlaw Robin Hood also feature John as the villain who treats his people terribly. The negative view of King John can be traced back to the writings of medieval monks and other religious writers. They frequently wrote that he was an evil man, but they may have had a reason to try to paint this picture of him. John tightly controlled the Church and had fallen out with its leader, the Pope.\n\nTo try to keep the peace with rebellious barons and landowners, King John agreed to the Magna Carta in 1215. It was the first written document that established the rule of law and limited the king's power and allowed the wealthy landowners to have a say on new taxes.\n\nHowever, John once again found himself at odds with the country when he broke the terms of the agreement. Today, the Magna Carta is viewed as one of the first steps towards democracy and some historians say he was wrong to break it.\n\nBut at the time, it might not have been seen as such an important document. John may simply have seen it as a temporary agreement that was meant to prevent a war. Also, the barons may have made deliberately extreme demands to provoke John to break the agreement, giving them a reason to go to war to try to seize his power.\n\nFrom a military perspective, John is frequently viewed as a cowardly king who was reluctant to engage in open battles with his enemies. But many other leaders of the time tried to avoid this type of fighting.\n\nMany historians point to John's successes at attacking towns and castles in France and England as a sign of his military skill. One historian even refers to his siege of Rochester Castle in 1215 as the greatest operation in England up to that time.\n\nKing John was certainly a tough and violent king, but his portrait as a cowardly and evil man has as much to do with those that wrote about him as it does with his actions."
