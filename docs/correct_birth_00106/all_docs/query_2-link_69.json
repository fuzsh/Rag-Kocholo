        "text": "Scene 1\n\nSynopsis:\n\nJohn, King of England, is told by a messenger from the King of France that the territories held by John should belong instead to John’s nephew Arthur. When John refuses to be swayed by this message, he is threatened with war; John counters with a warning that he will attack France first. John then judges a quarrel between Robert and Philip Faulconbridge that concludes with Philip’s decision to acknowledge the dead King Richard I as his natural father. Philip is knighted as Sir Richard Plantagenet and prepares to go with King John and the English army to France; Sir Richard’s mother, Lady Faulconbridge, confesses to him that Richard I was indeed his father.\n\nEnter King John, Queen Eleanor, Pembroke, Essex, and\n\nSalisbury, with the Chatillion of France.\n\nKING JOHN\n\n0001 Now say, Chatillion, what would France with us?\n\nCHATILLION\n\n0002 Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France\n\n0003 In my behavior to the majesty,\n\n0004 The borrowed majesty, of England here.\n\nQUEEN ELEANOR\n\n0005 5 A strange beginning: “borrowed majesty”!\n\nKING JOHN\n\n0006 Silence, good mother. Hear the embassy.\n\nCHATILLION\n\n0007 Philip of France, in right and true behalf\n\n0008 Of thy deceasèd brother Geoffrey’s son,\n\n0009 Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim\n\n0010 10 To this fair island and the territories,\n\n0011 To Ireland, Poitiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,\n\n0012 Desiring thee to lay aside the sword\n\n0013 Which sways usurpingly these several titles,\n\n0014 And put the same into young Arthur’s hand,\n\n0015 15 Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.\n\nKING JOHN\n\n0016 What follows if we disallow of this?\n\np. 9\n\nCHATILLION\n\n0017 The proud control of fierce and bloody war,\n\n0018 To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.\n\nKING JOHN\n\n0019 Here have we war for war and blood for blood,\n\n0020 20 Controlment for controlment: so answer France.\n\nCHATILLION\n\n0021 Then take my king’s defiance from my mouth,\n\n0022 The farthest limit of my embassy.\n\nKING JOHN\n\n0023 Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace.\n\n0024 Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France,\n\n0025 25 For ere thou canst report, I will be there;\n\n0026 The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.\n\n0027 So, hence. Be thou the trumpet of our wrath\n\n0028 And sullen presage of your own decay.—\n\n0029 An honorable conduct let him have.\n\n0030 30 Pembroke, look to ’t.—Farewell, Chatillion.\n\nChatillion and Pembroke exit.\n\nQUEEN ELEANOR, ⌜aside to King John⌝\n\n0031 What now, my son! Have I not ever said\n\n0032 How that ambitious Constance would not cease\n\n0033 Till she had kindled France and all the world\n\n0034 Upon the right and party of her son?\n\n0035 35 This might have been prevented and made whole\n\n0036 With very easy arguments of love,\n\n0037 Which now the manage of two kingdoms must\n\n0038 With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.\n\nKING JOHN, ⌜aside to Queen Eleanor⌝\n\n0039 Our strong possession and our right for us.\n\nQUEEN ELEANOR, ⌜aside to King John⌝\n\n0040 40 Your strong possession much more than your right,\n\n0041 Or else it must go wrong with you and me—\n\n0042 So much my conscience whispers in your ear,\n\n0043 Which none but ⌜God⌝ and you and I shall hear.\n\np. 11\n\nEnter a Sheriff, ⌜who speaks aside to Essex.⌝\n\nESSEX\n\n0044 My liege, here is the strangest controversy\n\n0045 45 Come from the country to be judged by you\n\n0046 That e’er I heard. Shall I produce the men?\n\nKING JOHN 0047 Let them approach.⌜Sheriff exits.⌝\n\n0048 Our abbeys and our priories shall pay\n\n0049 This ⌜expedition’s⌝ charge.\n\nEnter Robert Faulconbridge and Philip ⌜Faulconbridge.⌝\n\n0050 50 What men are you?\n\nPHILIP FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0051 Your faithful subject I, a gentleman,\n\n0052 Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,\n\n0053 As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,\n\n0054 A soldier, by the honor-giving hand\n\n0055 55 Of Coeur de Lion knighted in the field.\n\nKING JOHN, ⌜to Robert Faulconbridge⌝ 0056 What art thou?\n\nROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0057 The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.\n\nKING JOHN\n\n0058 Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?\n\n0059 You came not of one mother then, it seems.\n\nPHILIP FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0060 60 Most certain of one mother, mighty king—\n\n0061 That is well known—and, as I think, one father.\n\n0062 But for the certain knowledge of that truth\n\n0063 I put you o’er to heaven and to my mother.\n\n0064 Of that I doubt, as all men’s children may.\n\nQUEEN ELEANOR\n\n0065 65 Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy\n\n0066 mother\n\n0067 And wound her honor with this diffidence.\n\nPHILIP FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0068 I, madam? No, I have no reason for it.\n\n0069 That is my brother’s plea, and none of mine,\n\np. 13\n\n0070 70 The which if he can prove, he pops me out\n\n0071 At least from fair five hundred pound a year.\n\n0072 Heaven guard my mother’s honor and my land!\n\nKING JOHN\n\n0073 A good blunt fellow.—Why, being younger born,\n\n0074 Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?\n\nPHILIP FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0075 75 I know not why, except to get the land.\n\n0076 But once he slandered me with bastardy.\n\n0077 But whe’er I be as true begot or no,\n\n0078 That still I lay upon my mother’s head.\n\n0079 But that I am as well begot, my liege—\n\n0080 80 Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!—\n\n0081 Compare our faces and be judge yourself.\n\n0082 If old Sir Robert did beget us both\n\n0083 And were our father, and this son like him,\n\n0084 O, old Sir Robert, father, on my knee\n\n0085 85 I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!\n\nKING JOHN\n\n0086 Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!\n\nQUEEN ELEANOR, ⌜aside to King John⌝\n\n0087 He hath a trick of Coeur de Lion’s face;\n\n0088 The accent of his tongue affecteth him.\n\n0089 Do you not read some tokens of my son\n\n0090 90 In the large composition of this man?\n\nKING JOHN, ⌜aside to Queen Eleanor⌝\n\n0091 Mine eye hath well examinèd his parts\n\n0092 And finds them perfect Richard. ⌜To Robert\n\nFaulconbridge⌝ 0093 Sirrah, speak.\n\n0094 What doth move you to claim your brother’s land?\n\nPHILIP FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0095 95 Because he hath a half-face, like my father.\n\n0096 With half that face would he have all my land—\n\n0097 A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!\n\nROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0098 My gracious liege, when that my father lived,\n\n0099 Your brother did employ my father much—\n\np. 15\n\nPHILIP FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0100 100 Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land.\n\n0101 Your tale must be how he employed my mother.\n\nROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0102 And once dispatched him in an embassy\n\n0103 To Germany, there with the Emperor\n\n0104 To treat of high affairs touching that time.\n\n0105 105 Th’ advantage of his absence took the King\n\n0106 And in the meantime sojourned at my father’s;\n\n0107 Where how he did prevail I shame to speak.\n\n0108 But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores\n\n0109 Between my father and my mother lay,\n\n0110 110 As I have heard my father speak himself,\n\n0111 When this same lusty gentleman was got.\n\n0112 Upon his deathbed he by will bequeathed\n\n0113 His lands to me, and took it on his death\n\n0114 That this my mother’s son was none of his;\n\n0115 115 An if he were, he came into the world\n\n0116 Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.\n\n0117 Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,\n\n0118 My father’s land, as was my father’s will.\n\nKING JOHN\n\n0119 Sirrah, your brother is legitimate.\n\n0120 120 Your father’s wife did after wedlock bear him,\n\n0121 An if she did play false, the fault was hers,\n\n0122 Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands\n\n0123 That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,\n\n0124 Who as you say took pains to get this son,\n\n0125 125 Had of your father claimed this son for his?\n\n0126 In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept\n\n0127 This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;\n\n0128 In sooth he might. Then if he were my brother’s,\n\n0129 My brother might not claim him, nor your father,\n\n0130 130 Being none of his, refuse him. This concludes:\n\n0131 My mother’s son did get your father’s heir;\n\n0132 Your father’s heir must have your father’s land.\n\np. 17\n\nROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0133 Shall then my father’s will be of no force\n\n0134 To dispossess that child which is not his?\n\nPHILIP FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0135 135 Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,\n\n0136 Than was his will to get me, as I think.\n\nQUEEN ELEANOR\n\n0137 Whether hadst thou rather: be a Faulconbridge\n\n0138 And, like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,\n\n0139 Or the reputed son of Coeur de Lion,\n\n0140 140 Lord of thy presence, and no land besides?\n\nBASTARD\n\n0141 Madam, an if my brother had my shape\n\n0142 And I had his, Sir Robert’s his like him,\n\n0143 And if my legs were two such riding-rods,\n\n0144 My arms such eel-skins stuffed, my face so thin\n\n0145 145 That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose,\n\n0146 Lest men should say “Look where three-farthings\n\n0147 goes,”\n\n0148 And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,\n\n0149 Would I might never stir from off this place,\n\n0150 150 I would give it every foot to have this face.\n\n0151 ⌜I⌝ would not be Sir Nob in any case.\n\nQUEEN ELEANOR\n\n0152 I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,\n\n0153 Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me?\n\n0154 I am a soldier and now bound to France.\n\nBASTARD\n\n0155 155 Brother, take you my land. I’ll take my chance.\n\n0156 Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,\n\n0157 Yet sell your face for five pence and ’tis dear.—\n\n0158 Madam, I’ll follow you unto the death.\n\nQUEEN ELEANOR\n\n0159 Nay, I would have you go before me thither.\n\nBASTARD\n\n0160 160 Our country manners give our betters way.\n\np. 19\n\nKING JOHN 0161 What is thy name?\n\nBASTARD\n\n0162 Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,\n\n0163 Philip, good old Sir Robert’s wife’s eldest son.\n\nKING JOHN\n\n0164 From henceforth bear his name whose form thou\n\n0165 165 bearest.\n\n0166 Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great.\n\n⌜Philip kneels. King John dubs him a knight,\n\ntapping him on the shoulder with his sword.⌝\n\n0167 Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet.\n\nBASTARD, ⌜rising, to Robert Faulconbridge⌝\n\n0168 Brother by th’ mother’s side, give me your hand.\n\n0169 My father gave me honor, yours gave land.\n\n0170 170 Now blessèd be the hour, by night or day,\n\n0171 When I was got, Sir Robert was away!\n\nQUEEN ELEANOR\n\n0172 The very spirit of Plantagenet!\n\n0173 I am thy grandam, Richard. Call me so.\n\nBASTARD\n\n0174 Madam, by chance but not by truth. What though?\n\n0175 175 Something about, a little from the right,\n\n0176 In at the window, or else o’er the hatch.\n\n0177 Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,\n\n0178 And have is have, however men do catch.\n\n0179 Near or far off, well won is still well shot,\n\n0180 180 And I am I, howe’er I was begot.\n\nKING JOHN, ⌜to Robert Faulconbridge⌝\n\n0181 Go, Faulconbridge, now hast thou thy desire.\n\n0182 A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.—\n\n0183 Come, madam,—and come, Richard. We must\n\n0184 speed\n\n0185 185 For France, for France, for it is more than need.\n\nBASTARD\n\n0186 Brother, adieu, good fortune come to thee,\n\np. 21\n\n0187 For thou wast got i’ th’ way of honesty.\n\nAll but Bastard exit.\n\n0188 A foot of honor better than I was,\n\n0189 But many a many foot of land the worse.\n\n0190 190 Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.\n\n0191 “Good den, Sir Richard!” “God-a-mercy, fellow!”\n\n0192 An if his name be George, I’ll call him “Peter,”\n\n0193 For new-made honor doth forget men’s names;\n\n0194 ’Tis too respective and too sociable\n\n0195 195 For your conversion. Now your traveler,\n\n0196 He and his toothpick at my Worship’s mess,\n\n0197 And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,\n\n0198 Why then I suck my teeth and catechize\n\n0199 My pickèd man of countries: “My dear sir,”\n\n0200 200 Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin,\n\n0201 “I shall beseech you”—that is Question now,\n\n0202 And then comes Answer like an absey-book:\n\n0203 “O, sir,” says Answer, “at your best command,\n\n0204 At your employment, at your service, sir.”\n\n0205 205 “No, sir,” says Question, “I, sweet sir, at yours.”\n\n0206 And so, ere Answer knows what Question would,\n\n0207 Saving in dialogue of compliment\n\n0208 And talking of the Alps and Apennines,\n\n0209 The Pyrenean and the river Po,\n\n0210 210 It draws toward supper in conclusion so.\n\n0211 But this is worshipful society\n\n0212 And fits the mounting spirit like myself;\n\n0213 For he is but a bastard to the time\n\n0214 That doth not ⌜smack⌝ of observation,\n\n0215 215 And so am I whether I smack or no;\n\n0216 And not alone in habit and device,\n\n0217 Exterior form, outward accouterment,\n\n0218 But from the inward motion to deliver\n\n0219 Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age’s tooth,\n\n0220 220 Which though I will not practice to deceive,\n\np. 23\n\n0221 Yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn,\n\n0222 For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.\n\nEnter Lady Faulconbridge and James Gurney.\n\n0223 But who comes in such haste in riding robes?\n\n0224 What woman post is this? Hath she no husband\n\n0225 225 That will take pains to blow a horn before her?\n\n0226 O me, ’tis my mother.—How now, good lady?\n\n0227 What brings you here to court so hastily?\n\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0228 Where is that slave thy brother? Where is he\n\n0229 That holds in chase mine honor up and down?\n\nBASTARD\n\n0230 230 My brother Robert, old Sir Robert’s son?\n\n0231 Colbrand the Giant, that same mighty man?\n\n0232 Is it Sir Robert’s son that you seek so?\n\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0233 “Sir Robert’s son”? Ay, thou unreverent boy,\n\n0234 Sir Robert’s son. Why scorn’st thou at Sir Robert?\n\n0235 235 He is Sir Robert’s son, and so art thou.\n\nBASTARD\n\n0236 James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?\n\nGURNEY\n\n0237 Good leave, good Philip.\n\nBASTARD 0238 “Philip Sparrow,” James.\n\n0239 There’s toys abroad. Anon I’ll tell thee more.\n\nJames ⌜Gurney⌝ exits.\n\n0240 240 Madam, I was not old Sir Robert’s son.\n\n0241 Sir Robert might have eat his part in me\n\n0242 Upon Good Friday and ne’er broke his fast.\n\n0243 Sir Robert could do well—marry, to confess—\n\n0244 Could ⌜he⌝ get me. Sir Robert could not do it;\n\n0245 245 We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,\n\n0246 To whom am I beholding for these limbs?\n\n0247 Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.\n\np. 25\n\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0248 Hast thou conspirèd with thy brother too,\n\n0249 That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine\n\n0250 250 honor?\n\n0251 What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?\n\nBASTARD\n\n0252 Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.\n\n0253 What, I am dubbed! I have it on my shoulder.\n\n0254 But, mother, I am not Sir Robert’s son.\n\n0255 255 I have disclaimed Sir Robert and my land.\n\n0256 Legitimation, name, and all is gone.\n\n0257 Then, good my mother, let me know my father—\n\n0258 Some proper man, I hope. Who was it, mother?\n\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0259 Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?\n\nBASTARD\n\n0260 260 As faithfully as I deny the devil.\n\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE\n\n0261 King Richard Coeur de Lion was thy father.\n\n0262 By long and vehement suit I was seduced\n\n0263 To make room for him in my husband’s bed.\n\n0264 Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!\n\n0265 265⌜Thou⌝ art the issue of my dear offense,\n\n0266 Which was so strongly urged past my defense.\n\nBASTARD\n\n0267 Now, by this light, were I to get again,\n\n0268 Madam, I would not wish a better father.\n\n0269 Some sins do bear their privilege on Earth,\n\n0270 270 And so doth yours. Your fault was not your folly.\n\n0271 Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,\n\n0272 Subjected tribute to commanding love,\n\n0273 Against whose fury and unmatchèd force\n\n0274 The aweless lion could not wage the fight,\n\n0275 275 Nor keep his princely heart from Richard’s hand.\n\n0276 He that perforce robs lions of their hearts\n\np. 27\n\n0277 May easily win a woman’s. Ay, my mother,\n\n0278 With all my heart I thank thee for my father.\n\n0279 Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well\n\n0280 280 When I was got, I’ll send his soul to hell.\n\n0281 Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin,\n\n0282 And they shall say when Richard me begot,\n\n0283 If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin.\n\n0284 Who says it was, he lies. I say ’twas not.\n\nThey exit."
