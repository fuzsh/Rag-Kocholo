        "text": "CHAPTER VIII\n\nMAGNA CARTA\n\nON OCTOBER 13, 1214, a defeated and sadly disappointed king landed at Dartmouth.1 The campaign to which he had devoted years of preparation and enormous sums of money and which he had hoped would make him the undisputed master of western Europe had been a complete fiasco. His nephew Otto now had little chance of maintaining his position against Frederick of Hohenstaufen. The two most powerful of John’s French allies, the counts of Flanders and Boulogne, and his bastard brother Earl William of Salisbury were prisoners of King Philip. John had strengthened his position in Poitou, but he well knew how temporary any gain was likely to be in that turbulent region. He had also captured a cousin of King Philip—Robert, eldest son and heir of Robert II, count of Dreux. Even if one accepts John’s argument that the cousin of a king was a far more important capture than the illegitimate son of a king, his total accomplishment remains far from impressive.2 Philip Augustus had decisively won his life-long contest with the Plantagenets.\n\nJohn found his baronial foes bolder if not more numerous than before his departure for Poitou. There had been opposition to the collection of the scutage. The close rolls show that various sheriffs had distrained Eustace de Vesci, Roger de Montbegon, and Robert de Gresley, three of the northern barons.3 Sometime during the early autumn either John or Peter des Roches had complained to the pope that Eustace de Vesci was defying the king’s officers.4 Mr. Mitchell has pointed out that no scutage was paid in Lancashire, Essex, and Hertfordshire and very little in Norfolk and Suffolk. No account was rendered at Michaelmas 1214 for the scutage due from Yorkshire. While some of the dissident lords such as Geoffrey de Mandeville and Gilbert de Ghent had paid part of their scutage, the greater number seem to have refused.5 Shortly after the king’s arrival in England, his enemies met at the abbey of Bury St. Edmunds. Under the guise of a pious pilgrimage they discussed their grievances. The charter of liberties of Henry I was accepted as a statement of the rights of the king’s vassals. The barons assembled in the church and swore that if the king failed to grant them their just claims they would defy him and wage war against him.6\n\nObviously the composition of the baronial party that was to oblige John to issue Magna Carta is of major interest, but unfortunately our chief sources of information on this subject do not inspire one with unbounded confidence. The Histoire des ducs de Normandie gives us a brief list of barons who attended the meeting at St. Edmunds.7 While this chronicle is in general a reliable one, the meeting took place at a time when the chronicler was not in England, and he probably had no direct knowledge of who was there. At any rate the list is too short to be of great value. Then Roger of Wendover supplies a much longer roll of those who gathered at Stamford in the following spring.8 Wendover’s roll includes forty-two names and gives us our fullest picture of the baronial party. But one hesitates to take Wendover’s lists too seriously. A few pages further on he makes a statement so glaringly wrong that one is forced to question his knowledge of the subject. He says that after the barons had occupied London, they sent threatening letters to all who had not joined them and gives twenty-two names as a partial list of those to whom the letters were addressed. He then states that the majority of these men promptly joined the barons.9 Now seventeen of these men certainly did not join the barons before the granting of Magna Carta, and eleven of these stood by John throughout the civil war. This seems to justify a certain lack of confidence in Wendover’s lists. Finally Matthew Paris gives the names of the twenty-five barons chosen to enforce Magna Carta.10 Paris was not a contemporary, and we have no knowledge of where he got his list. While the fact that thirteen of his names can be confirmed from a documentary source suggests that his list is on the whole correct, it should not be accepted as above criticism.\n\nThe close and patent rolls supply us with the names of fifteen men of importance who were in rebellion before the issuance of Magna Carta. In the middle of May John ordered the seizure of lands belonging to Geoffrey de Mandeville, earl of Gloucester, William de Mandeville, his brother, Robert fitz Walter, Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, Henry de Bohun, earl of Hereford, Giles de Briouse, bishop of Hereford, William de Huntingfield, Henry de Braybrook, and Simon de Pattishall.11 Various documents show clearly that Roger de Cressi, William de Montaigu, William Malet, and Robert fitz Paien were in arms as rebels.12 A letter addressed to Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, in January seems to indicate that he was in the baronial group.13 While it seems clear that Saher de Quency, earl of Winchester, was not in revolt when the above letter was addressed to Earl Roger, he had joined the barons by May 25.14\n\nThus we have the names of fifteen rebels supplied by the patent and close rolls, twenty-five by Matthew Paris, and forty-two by Roger of Wendover. Hence our knowledge of the secondary leaders of the opposition comes from the weakest source. On the whole it seems likely that this particular list of Wendover’s is essentially accurate and can be accepted as a general picture of the baronial party. But the mere presence of a man’s name on Wendover’s roll should not be taken as conclusive evidence that he was a rebel at the time of the meeting at Stamford. It seems highly probable, for instance, that Wendover is mistaken in placing John de Lacy, constable of Chester, and his cousin John fitz Robert in this assembly. John de Lacy was clearly high in the royal favor on March 5 when all his extensive debts to the crown were forgiven.15 The king also regarded him as loyal as late as May 31.16 While John de Lacy was to show throughout the civil war a remarkable inability to make up his mind as to which side he wanted to support, it seems unlikely that he was at Stamford in mid-April. John fitz Robert was sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk at the time the charter was granted. While the shires seem to have been in the actual control of John’s half-brother, Roger de Cressi, one of the king’s bitterest foes, John retained the custody of Norwich castle and his master’s confidence.17 When on May 15 the king ordered the bailiffs of Hubert de Burgh to seize the son of Roger de Cressi, he directed them to deliver their prisoner to John fitz Robert.18 It seems most unlikely that John fitz Robert was at Stamford.\n\nUsing the names supplied by the close and patent rolls, Roger of Wendover, and Matthew Paris I have drawn up two lists to serve as bases for a discussion of the baronial party prior to the granting of Magna Carta. The first of these lists contains forty-five names and includes all those who by any stretch of the imagination could be described as barons. The second list of twenty-six includes those who seem to have been leaders of the party. As the chief purpose of the second list was to study the family connections of the rebel chiefs, the sons and younger brothers of rebellious lords were excluded. The following general remarks will be based on these lists.\n\nLet us first glance at the geographical distribution of the leaders of the revolt. The contemporary chronicles emphasize the importance of the “northerners” and they were indeed a significant group. Twelve of the forty-five had the major portion of their lands in Yorkshire, Northumberland, Lancashire, and Cumberland. While this group could not boast of an English earl, it included the count of Aumale, two great barons, John de Lacy and William de Mowbray, and the king’s bitter foe Eustace de Vesci. The barons of secondary rank were represented by Peter de Bruce, Richard de Percy, Robert de Ros, and Nicholas de Stutville. If one considers Lincolnshire a northern shire, as the contemporary writers probably did, six more names are added. One of these was the great lord Gilbert de Ghent whose claim to the title of earl of Lincoln was to be recognized by Louis of France. But this Lincolnshire group is less distinct than that in the far north. While William de Albini had extensive lands in Lincolnshire, his castle of Belvoir and much of his property was in Leicestershire. William de Huntingfield and Oliver de Vaux probably had their possessions about equally divided between Lincolnshire and East Anglia. Finally John fitz Robert was geographically a link between the northerners and the rebels of East Anglia and Essex. While his castles and baronies lay in Northumberland, he had important possessions in the east. Accepting Lincolnshire as a northern shire and including the borderline cases the northerners numbered twenty of the forty-five.\n\nThe next most important group consisted of twelve men whose lands lay in the easternmost shires—Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, and Kent. This group included in addition to the elected leader of the party, Robert fitz Walter, Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, Richard de Clare, earl of Hertford, Geoffrey de Mandeville who styled himself earl of Gloucester and Essex, and Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford. While the titles of the last two lords suggest possessions outside this region, it seems unlikely that Geoffrey de Mandeville ever obtained effective possession of the honor of Gloucester, and Robert de Vere’s lands lay almost entirely in Essex and Cambridgeshire Below these great lords were two secondary barons, Geoffrey de Say and Richard de Montfichet.\n\nA third somewhat less clearly defined group had its seat in the west of England—Shropshire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, and Somersetshire. Its most important members were Henry de Bohun, earl of Hereford, Giles de Briouse, bishop of Hereford, and the younger William Marshal. It included King John’s old enemy Fulk fitz Warin, a cadet of the great house of Fitz Alan, Robert de Berkeley, William Malet, William de Montaigu, and Robert fitz Paien. Maurice de Ghent’s lands were about equally divided between Gloucestershire and Somersetshire and Yorkshire. In all, this western group numbered ten.\n\nOutside of these three groups there were only two men of any importance—Saher de Quency, earl of Winchester, and William de Beauchamp. Saher’s ancestral possessions were insignificant and lay in Northamptonshire and Cambridge. He owed his power to his possession of half of the great honor of Leicester. William de Beauchamp’s large barony was almost entirely in Bedfordshire.\n\nWhile the location of the lands and castles of the rebellious barons was important from a military point of view, it seems unlikely that it can cast much light on the forces that created the baronial party. I can see no reason connected with geography that would make the lords of Essex and East Anglia more rebellious than those of Nottingham and Derbyshire. It looks as if the dominant factor was the attitude of the great barons. In Essex, East Anglia, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Northumberland the most powerful barons were, with some few exceptions, the king’s foes. In these regions there was a natural tendency for the lesser lords to join the baronial party. This was intensified with the beginning of actual hostilities as it then became actually dangerous to differ with one’s more powerful neighbors. There were few rebels in the shires where the great barons stayed loyal. Thus the great feudal power of Ranulf of Chester, William de Ferrers, and Earl Henry of Warwick discouraged rebellion in Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Warwickshire, and Leicestershire. The same was true of the earls of Arundel and Warren in Sussex and Surrey and Earl William of Salisbury in Wiltshire. Cornwall and Devon were kept in order by Earl William de Redvers, Henry fitz Count, Henry de Pomeroy, Robert de Cardinan, and Robert de Courtenay. In only one region does it seem probable that true geographic factors played a part in drawing the line between the king’s friends and foes. As the Welsh were the king’s enemies, the Marcher lords were strongly inclined to the royal party.\n\nA number of scholars have suggested the possibility that ties of blood led many men into the baronial party. There is ample evidence that the family played an important part in thirteenth-century politics, but we know little of how family was defined in the minds of the men of the time. Did a man feel that he had family obligations toward his second cousin? The fact that landed property descended by inheritance was enough to make the barons of England expert genealogists. The most obscure relationships seem to have been well known from this practical point of view. An examination of the list of rebellious barons indicates that fairly distant blood relationship may have played a part in forming the baronial party. The list of rebel barons contains the names of thirteen descendants of the first Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare—all except his son Gilbert second cousins of Earl Richard de Clare. If, as seems likely, William de Mowbray’s mother was a Clare, the roll of the clan comes to fourteen.19 Six of these were descendants of the marriage between Aubrey de Vere, the chamberlain, and Adeliza de Clare. With the exception of John de Monmouth and William de Percy who was a minor every descendant of Richard fitz Gilbert who was of baronial rank was among the enemies of King John in 1215. This correlation between the blood of the house of Clare and opposition to John seems too close to be mere coincidence.20\n\nWhile the importance of distant blood relationship may be open to some doubt, the closer ones, especially those of the family in the narrow sense, were clearly taken extremely seriously in the thirteenth century. When Roger de Lacy, constable of Chester, was taken in Chateau Gaillard, his uncle, Robert fitz Roger, was given the task of raising his ransom and became his pledge for a loan of £1,000 obtained from King John.21 After Robert fitz Walter’s capture in Vaudreuil, his first cousin, William de Albini, was authorized to mortgage Robert’s lands to obtain money for his ransom.22 When William de Briouse was in trouble with John, it was his nephew Earl William de Ferrers who tried to mediate between him and the king.23 Perhaps the best evidence for the closeness of the relationship between uncle and nephew is the fact that a nephew was frequently accepted as a hostage for his uncle. Naturally the ties between brothers and half-brothers were still more binding. Moreover the men of the time were very generous in according the term brother. Thus one finds King John calling Geoffrey de Buckland the brother of Geoffrey fitz Peter.24 Actually Geoffrey de Buckland was the brother of Geoffrey fitz Peter’s brother-in-law. There is no need to labor the point further. Mediæval literature abounds in examples of the importance placed on kinship.\n\nWe have seen that William de Albini of Belvoir was the first cousin of Robert fitz Walter. He had the same relationship to Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, and to Gilbert de Ghent. It is possible that Saher de Quency was his nephew. Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, Simon, father of William de Beauchamp of Bedford, Robert fitz Roger, father of John fitz Robert, and Alice, grandmother of John de Lacy, had all been first cousins. Geoffrey de Say had married Earl Robert’s sister. Peter de Bruce and William de Fortibus, count of Aumale, were first cousins, as were Geoffrey de Say and Earl Geoffrey de Mandeville, William de Mowbray and Gilbert de Ghent, Richard de Montfichet and Robert fitz Walter, and Eustace de Vesci and John de Lacy. In the relationship of uncle and nephew stood Gilbert de Ghent and Maurice de Ghent, William de Beauchamp and William de Lanvalay, and William de Albini and Robert de Ros. William de Lanvalay had married Robert fitz Walter’s niece. Young William Marshal was married to the half-sister of the count of Aumale and two of his sisters were married to Hugh Bigod and Gilbert de Clare. The count of Aumale’s wife was the sister of Richard de Montfichet. Eustace de Vesci and Robert de Ros had both married illegitimate daughters of King William of Scotland. Earl Henry de Bohun’s wife was the sister of Geoffrey and William de Mandeville who were in turn sons-in-laws of Robert fitz Walter. Nicholas de Stutville was the stepfather of Gilbert de Ghent. John fitz Robert and Roger de Cressi were half-brothers.25 In short it is clear that blood relationship may well have played an important part in forming the baronial party.\n\nIt is important to remember that our knowledge of the genealogy of the English baronage is extremely limited. While connections in the male line are usually fairly obvious, those based on marriage are frequently obscure. I suspect that William de Mowbray’s mother was a Clare, probably a sister of Earl Richard, but I can find no conclusive proof of this relationship. No one knows who was the wife of Roger de Lacy, constable of Chester. Geoffrey fitz Peter was the most important baron in England during John’s reign. Yet the identity of his second wife is shown clearly only by a pair of obscure charters hidden deep in the Calendar of ancient deeds.26 There seems little doubt that if our information were fuller, we should see many more blood relationships and marriage connections among the rebellious barons.\n\nWhile in mediæval society as a whole feudal ties were almost as strong as those of close relationship by blood, it is difficult to estimate their significance in forming the baronial party. With one or two possible exceptions all the forty-five baronial leaders on my list were tenants-in-chief of the crown and hence definitely owed their service primarily to King John. Yet the part played by William Marshal in the quarrel between William de Briouse and the king seems to show that mutual feudal obligations among tenants-in-chief were of some importance even when the crown was directly involved. William Marshal refused to surrender William de Briouse to the justiciar of Ireland. While the Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal suggests that he would have done so on a direct royal command, if King John’s official account of the affair is correct, he ignored royal letters directing him to surrender his guest. Then King John’s attitude toward two of William Marshal’s knights, John de Erley and Henry fitz Gerold, who were tenants-in-chief of the crown when they remained in Ireland in open defiance of the king’s command indicates that he himself regarded men whom he had, as he said, “loaned” to a great baron as being in a special category in respect to their obligations to him.27 Perhaps one may say that the custom of the time allowed a tenant-in-chief of the crown to go somewhat further in supporting against the king a man to whom he owed feudal obligations than one to whom he had no such relationship.\n\nIt seems quite possible that among the “northerners” feudal relations played a part of some importance. As we have seen William de Mowbray had good reason to hate King John. Peter de Bruce, Nicholas de Stutville, and Eustace de Vesci were vassals of William de Mowbray.28 Robert de Ros was an important vassal of William de Fortibus, count of Aumale, who was in turn a vassal of Earl Roger Bigod.29 Outside the northern group feudal relationships were scattered, but may well have had some significance. While the blood relationship between Robert fitz Walter and Saher de Quency is highly speculative, there is no doubt that Saher was Robert’s vassal.30 Nicholas de Stutville held several fees of the barony of Belvoir from William de Albini.31 Oliver de Vaux had married Petronilla, daughter and heiress of Guy de Craon, and held her barony of some twenty-two fees, but his ancestral lands consisted of a fief of thirty fees held from Earl Roger Bigod.32 Thomas de Moulton was a vassal of the Craon barony.33 While the bulk of William de Huntingfield’s lands were held of honors in the king’s hands, his castle of Frampton belonged to the Craon barony, and he was probably a distant relative of Petronilla.34 Again the major part of the lands of Simon de Kyme were fees of the earldom of Chester, but there is some reason for thinking that he considered his closest feudal relationship to be with Gilbert de Ghent of whom he held three fees.35 If one takes seriously Geoffrey de Mandeville’s possession of the honor of Gloucester, Fulk fitz Warin and Simon de Kyme must be listed among his vassals.36\n\nObviously there must have existed among the barons purely personal relationships based on simple friendship, but these we can rarely learn about. There are few sources like the Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal. We know that William Marshal was a close friend of Baldwin de Bethune, count of Aumale.37 There is strong reason for believing that he cordially hated Saher de Quency.38 But in general such personal likes and dislikes are unknown to us.\n\nA contemporary chronicler makes a generalization about the baronial party that has to some extent been accepted by modern scholars—that it was essentially a group of young men.39 Now we rarely have any information as to the date of a baron’s birth. As a rule one can merely say when he succeeded to his inheritance and whether he was over twenty-one at the time. When what information we possess is applied to an examination of the list of forty-five rebel lords, the result does not seem to justify the generalization. It is possible to guess rather closely the ages of three young men. William Marshal the younger was about twenty-five, William de Fortibus about twenty, and Maurice de Ghent about twenty-eight.40 There are eight others who may well have been in their twenties. While Hugh Bigod and Gilbert de Clare had not yet succeeded to their lands, their fathers had held their earldoms for thirty-eight and forty-two years respectively. Neither Hugh nor Gilbert can have been very young. Robert de Vere and Geoffrey de Say had succeeded to the family lands in 1214, but they too were middle-aged. Robert’s brother, Earl Aubrey, had held the earldom for twenty years. Geoffrey de Say’s father had clearly lived to a ripe age—his elder brother had died in 1177 and his two cousins, Earl Geoffrey and Earl William de Mandeville, in 1166 and 1189 respectively. Gilbert de Ghent was about thirty-five. Henry de Bohun was forty, Robert de Ros forty-three, and Eustace de Vesci forty-four.41 Robert de Berkeley, Peter de Bruce, William Malet, Simon de Kyme, Roger de Montbegon, William de Mowbray, and Richard de Percy, were all at least forty as they had held their fiefs for twenty to twenty-five years. Robert fitz Walter and Saher de Quency were over sixty-five.42 The earls of Norfolk and Hertford may well have been older. William de Albini had been holding his barony of Belvoir for forty-eight years. On the whole it seems impossible to say that youth was a distinguishing mark of the baronial party. The chronicler who made the comment was clearly thinking of a few well-known cases. The presence of William Marshal the younger in the rebel ranks while his father was a stanch supporter of John must have attracted wide attention. In the autumn of 1215 young William de Lancaster served in the rebel garrison of Rochester and embarrassed his father Gilbert fitz Renfrew.\n\nAnother extremely interesting question is the size of the baronial party in relation to the whole English baronage. In an earlier chapter I used a list of one hundred ninety-seven English baronies as representing essentially all that existed. The holders of thirty-nine of these baronies are known to have been among the rebels prior to the issuing of Magna Carta. Then I used another list of the twenty-eight most powerful barons of England in 1199. By 1215 the major part of the honor of Richmond and one-half the honor of Leicester were in the king’s hand. The original twenty-eight had been reduced to twenty-seven. Thirteen of these were rebels in 1215. The thirteen rebels held approximately 1,475 knights’ fees against the 1,580 of those who were not in revolt. Unfortunately the figures for the baronage as a whole are not very reliable. While only thirty-nine baronies are known to have been in the hands of rebels, one can only establish the loyalty of about as many others. In short the position of the majority of the baronage in this period before the issuing of Magna Carta is unknown. One might well argue that the true proportion among the barons as a whole probably followed that found among the great lords and that the baronage was essentially equally divided between the two parties. But at least the figures seem sufficient to destroy the old notion of a united baronage rising against King John.\n\nActually I suspect the true answer is more complicated. I am inclined to believe that there was a comparatively small group of rebels—say some forty-five men holding the thirty-nine baronies. Then there was another group, probably even smaller, who were ready to stand by John in arms. The great mass of the English baronage stayed out of the affair altogether. If one can judge by later events, most of the neutrals sympathized with the barons. By the time of John’s death the holders of ninety-seven baronies were in rebellion as against the holders of thirty-six who remained loyal. Only eight of the twenty-seven great barons were still on John’s side when he died. But even these figures are deceiving because they deal with technical allegiance. The earls of Arundel, Warren, Warwick, and Devon were loyal to John at the time of Magna Carta and remained so when the civil war broke out in the autumn of 1215, but they seem to have done nothing but protect their own estates. In 1216 the earls of Arundel and Warren transferred their allegiance to Louis of France and apparently ignored him as completely as they had John. Clearly all four of these earls were primarily interested in being left alone in their vast fiefs and followed whatever policy seemed best suited to attain that end. Actually it was the earl of Pembroke who sat on the fence most effectively. He himself was a stanch supporter of John while his eldest son and heir was a prominent rebel. The house of Marshal was safe whatever happened. Once the eventual defeat of the rebels was certain, the younger William Marshal rejoined the loyal camp in time to profit handsomely at the expense of some of his fellow rebels who had moved more slowly.\n\nIt is impossible to say much about the members of the rebellious party who were not of baronial rank. Our only source of information about the lesser foes of King John is the writs by which they were reinstated in their lands when they made their peace with the royal government. If all such writs were entered on the close roll, we have a complete list of all free-holders who participated in the revolt. As only one or two of the rebels of baronial status are missing from this list, it seems safe to assume that it is reasonably complete. It contains about 1,380 names. Thirty-five per cent of the barons who eventually joined the rebels were in revolt before the granting of Magna Carta. If this same ratio is applied to the free-holders as a whole, we have 480 in rebellion in this period. The geographical concentration of the rebels is more marked when all the free-holders are taken into account than when the barons alone are considered. A sample of 1,173 writs issued to individual sheriffs shows 20 per cent addressed to the north—Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland—and 40 per cent to the east—Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Kent. By adding the writs addressed to the sheriffs of Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, and Oxfordshire, 73 per cent of the total is accounted for. The same general result is obtained by examining a list of 724 rebels with lands in only one shire. The counties classified above as northern yield 27 per cent of the names and those considered as eastern 33 per cent. In contrast the counties of Shropshire, Staffordshire, Herefordshire Gloucestershire, Cornwall, Devon, Dorsetshire, and Somersetshire furnish but 9 per cent of the names.\n\nWhile I am convinced that the 1,380 free-holders who took part in the revolt against John were a very small part of the men of that status in England, I can produce no good evidence to prove my point. We have no way of determining the number of freeholders in the country. The most pertinent figure is that of existing knights’ fees—some 6,500. But many of the men in question held in demesne far less than a knight’s fee and some held more. Thus although I feel sure that the revolt was largely baronial and that only a small proportion of the lesser free-tenants took part, my conclusion must remain based largely on speculation.\n\nIt would be extremely interesting to know how many of the minor rebels were vassals who had followed their lords. In theory an English mesne tenant was under no obligation to follow his lord in rebellion—in fact his first duty was fidelity to the crown. At the same time it seems clear that a vassal who followed his lord into revolt was considered to have committed a less serious offense than a man who rebelled without such a feudal connection.43 Unfortunately it is impossible to determine the feudal affiliations of the vast majority of the lesser rebels. The fact that the percentage of rebel barons from the various shires was roughly the same as that of the free-holders as a whole might indicate that vassals tended to follow their lords. But it may also mean simply that it was unwise to remain loyal to the crown in a region where the rebels were dominant.\n\nWhile the barons who had sworn alliance at St. Edmunds postponed until January the presentation of their demands to the king and apparently hoped to keep their action a secret in the interval, it seems clear that John soon learned of the conspiracy. He despatched one of his favorite clerks, Walter Mauclerk, to Rome to seek the pope’s support and to combat the efforts of any baronial emissaries who might journey there.44 He also summoned to England a force of Poitevins under the command of the redoubtable Savaric de Mauleon.45 This was an extremely shrewd move. King John was appealing to the pope against the barons and in such circumstances wanted to have his own conduct beyond reproach. To have brought in additional mercenary captains would have weakened his position before the papacy and aggravated the discontent of his vassals. Savaric de Mauleon was an experienced soldier, a skilful if not too scrupulous politician, a poet of considerable distinction, and one of the great nobles of Poitou. The barons of England might dislike him as a foreigner, but he was their fellow vassal and social and political peer.\n\nDuring the second week of January 1215 a group of barons met John in London. They demanded that he carry out the oath he had taken when he was absolved. He was to abolish his own innovations and those made by his father and brother and restore the customs that had existed under Henry I—or more properly the customs that Henry I had so blithely promised to observe in his charter of liberties. The chroniclers are too vague to permit one to make out just what the barons wanted John to do. They demanded that he issue a charter of liberties, but whether this meant simply a re-issue of the charter of Henry I or a more extensive document cannot be determined. If the barons presented to John some definite schedule like the Articles of the Barons, the chroniclers give no indication of it. John told the barons that what they asked was very grave and postponed giving his answer until Easter-tide. The archbishop of Canterbury, the bishop of Ely, and William Marshal swore that the king would then give them satisfaction.46 The bishops of London, Winchester, Ely, Hereford, Bath, and Lincoln, the bishops elect of Coventry and Chichester, the earls of Surrey, Pembroke, Winchester, and Arundel, and Robert de Ros, Peter fitz Herbert, and William de Albini guaranteed the baronial delegation a safe journey home.47\n\nOn February 10 John learned that Savaric de Mauleon had landed in Ireland.48 That same day saw royal agents sent into many of the shires “to explain our business.”49 Unfortunately we do not know what the business was. Perhaps their mission was to spread the royal version of John’s dispute with his barons, but it is just as likely that their task was to prepare the king’s fortresses for defense in case of civil war. About this same time King John ordered the seneschals of Gascony and Poitou to send him more mercenary troops. Then on March 4 the king made a truly masterly move—he assumed the cross of a crusader.50 While it is difficult to define the privileges of a crusader in precise terms, in general he was entitled to be protected by the papacy and secured in the possession of all that he had when he took the vow until after his return from the Crusade. Barons who demanded concessions from a crusader monarch were in a very dubious position. If they rose in revolt, they were definitely defying the papacy. There seems no reason whatever for believing that John had the slightest intention of journeying to the Holy Land. His assumption of the cross was simply a clever maneuver.\n\nApparently King John’s next step was to have William Marshal and Earl William de Warren call the attention of the barons to the fact that he was a crusader as well as a vassal of the pope. He then asked Stephen Langton to compel the barons to perform the service they owed—presumably the payment of the scutage of Poitou. Stephen, according to John’s letter to the pope, agreed to act if the king would send home his foreign troops.51 On March 13 John informed his most recent Poitevin auxiliaries that the business for which he had needed them was finished and they were to go home.52 There is, however, no evidence that Langton did anything to discourage the barons.\n\nOn April 13 there was a fruitless conference at Oxford between the king and at least some of his disaffected barons.53 This may well have been the occasion when the barons hoped to receive the “satisfaction” promised them in London in January. Their failure to receive what they wanted led them to their first overt act of rebellion—they assembled in arms at Stamford.54 John then sent Stephen Langton and William Marshal to ask the barons to say exactly what reforms they wanted. The two emissaries found the barons at Brackley and received a schedule of demands that they bore to the king. After hearing the barons’ requests John indignantly refused to grant them.55\n\nWhen Stephen Langton and William Marshal informed the barons that their demands had been rejected, the rebellious lords formally defied the king and chose Robert fitz Walter as their leader under the pretentious and essentially irrelevant title of Marshal of the host of God and Holy Church.56 They then marched to Northampton and laid siege to its castle, one of the great royal fortresses of England. As they had no siege engines, they cannot have hoped to take the castle if it was vigorously defended, but they probably expected it to surrender.57 While it is not certain that Henry de Braybrook, sheriff of Northamptonshire, was actually in the baronial host, it is clear that he was one of those who sympathized with the rebels.58 Early in April John had learned that Henry was unreliable and had sent Richard Marsh to Northampton with power to make what dispositions seemed best for the safety for the castle.59 As a result Geoffrey de Martini, a mercenary captain, was made constable of the castle. But as Henry de Braybrook was still sheriff and probably at least nominally Geoffrey’s superior, the barons may well have hoped that he would arrange the surrender of the castle.60 Fortunately Geoffrey made an energetic defense and after a futile siege of two weeks the barons moved on in search of easier conquests. They did not have to look very far. Bedford castle was a royal fortress, but William de Beauchamp was its hereditary constable. As soon as his fellow rebels appeared, he admitted them to the castle.61 Bedford, however, was not a satisfactory substitute for Northampton. It was a second-grade fortress and far from a satisfactory refuge if the king moved against his foes with a large force.\n\nAt first glance King John’s policy during the early months of 1215 seems hopelessly feeble and vacillating. At one moment he would be negotiating with his barons—at the next sending for foreign troops. Then he would reopen negotiations and send the troops home. At times he would summon his loyal barons to a rendezvous and then make no use of them. Actually, however, when one considers John’s character and the general political and military situation, his policy becomes comprehensible and reasonable even if far from admirable. King John had one definite purpose—the preservation at its fullest extent of the authority of the royal government. He was determined not to weaken in any way the power of the English crown. He had no intention of making any permanent concession to the demands of his barons. John never had any scruples as to the means he used to attain his ends, and he rather preferred devious to direct methods. If one accepts these assumptions about John’s intentions and character, his policy fits well into the circumstances he faced.\n\nThe chief feature of the political situation in England in 1215 was the fact that the disaffected barons under the guidance of Stephen Langton had adopted a program that appealed to the feudal class as a whole. The leaders of the baronial party were the king’s personal enemies. Their chief object, I believe, was to avenge old injuries real or fancied and to secure their private rights—lands, castles, and privileges that they felt John or his predecessors had deprived them of. But they had sufficient good sense and political acumen to accept Langton’s broader ideas. First this new program had been little more than vague remarks about the charter of Henry I and the laws of King Edward. Then, probably in October 1213, they formulated the demands mentioned in the unknown charter. By April 27, 1215 they had a more elaborate list of what one can call constitutional demands. This put them in a strong political position. Many barons who had little interest in their private wrongs would sympathize with their general program. While I am by no means as sure as I once was that William Marshal actually had a hand in putting Magna Carta in its final form, I feel sure that he was in favor of its provisions. It was difficult for any feudal personage not to approve of a program that would strengthen him and his fellows against the crown.\n\nKing John on his side had few devoted servants on whom he could rely absolutely and only one of them could be classed as a great baron. Peter des Roches as bishop of Winchester was the lord of some eighty knights’ fees and four strong castles. Peter de Maulay by his marriage to the daughter of Robert de Turnham was a baron of secondary rank as was John’s bastard son, Richard, lord of Chilham. William Brewer, as we have seen in an earlier chapter, had built up a moderate sized barony. Robert de Vieuxpont was a powerful figure on the Scots border. But most of John’s creatures were men of no feudal position. Thomas de Eardington, Philip de Ulecotes, Geoffrey de Neville, and Brian de Lisle were able administrators and captains, but the king had to supply the resources with which they served him. The same was true of the foreign captains—Fawkes de Bréauté, Philip Marc, Engelard de Cigogné and their lesser colleagues. In short the men whom John could rely on to follow him without question whatever he might do were few in number and comparatively unimportant in the feudal world.\n\nThere was a small group of Englishmen who held a dominant position in the realm. Stephen Langton’s high reputation for ability and integrity, the prestige and spiritual power conferred on him by his exalted office, and the financial and military resources of the great archepiscopal barony made him the chief of these men. But close behind him came the earl of Pembroke. William Marshal’s reputation for integrity, for the chivalric virtue of loyalty, was fully as high as that held by Stephen Langton. He had also the enormous prestige that was conferred by wide fame for knightly prowess. If one takes into account his fiefs in England, Wales, and Ireland, he held well over two hundred knights’ fees, and his money incomes was probably far in excess of that enjoyed by any other English magnate. Moreover he was surrounded by a devoted group of friends and clients and was the leader of a powerful baronial group. As the greatest lord of South Wales and its marches and a well-known friend of the once great house of Briouse, he was the natural leader of the barons of that region. Two of King John’s ablest and most trusted captains, John Marshal and Thomas de Sanford, were almost completely under the great earl’s influence. In short William Marshal had everything that contributed to high position in mediæval society—advanced age, fame as a knight, and vast resources in men and money. Somewhat ahead of William Marshal in feudal power but well behind him in personal prestige was Earl Ranulf of Chester. The absolute master of his palatine shire of Cheshire and the greatest land-holder in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Earl Ranulf was an immensely powerful baron. With his brother-in-law and close ally Earl William de Ferrers he dominated the counties of Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire. With these three men must be placed the earls of Arundel and Surrey. We know little of their personal qualities, but both had immense resources in men, money, and castles.\n\nNone of these men had any reason to love King John. Stephen Langton, William Marshal, and Ranulf of Chester had all suffered from his hostility. The king had seduced the sister of Earl William de Warren—who was incidentally his first cousin. If these great magnates stayed faithful to John, it would be because they felt that their duty or their interest demanded such a course. In the cases of Stephen Langton and William Marshal there seems to be little doubt that duty was the predominant consideration. Hence it was extremely important for John to keep his position technically correct according to generally accepted feudal custom. He dared not place himself manifestly in the wrong lest he lose his few powerful supporters. As the mass of lesser barons who sympathized with the program advanced by the rebels but hesitated to join a revolt would almost certainly follow the lead of these great lords, the king’s whole position, his possession of the crown, depended on keeping their allegiance.\n\nKing John had one other mighty resource—the support of his overlord the pope. But here too he had to move with great care. Stephen Langton, the pope’s friend and officer, was a firm advocate if not the creator of the baronial program. While Langton’s concept of a realm governed by accepted law was of no great interest to Innocent III, and he was inclined to favor the man who had made him suzerain of England, the pope could not and would not support injustice against justice. He was inclined to listen to the arguments of John’s agents rather than to those of the barons, but the arguments had to be reasonably good. Hence this was another reason why John’s position had to be technically correct. The pope would aid him, but he had to appear to be worthy of aid.\n\nA few days before he examined the schedule of baronial demands John sent his justiciar, Peter des Roches, to see to the state of affairs in the north. Letters were despatched to the king’s chief agents in the region, Gilbert fitz Renfrew, John de Lacy, Robert de Vieuxpont, Geoffrey de Neville, Philip de Ulecotes, and Brian de Lisle, directing them to obey the bishop’s orders.62 At about the same time the lords of the southern marches of Wales were summoned to muster at Gloucester and then ordered to advance to Cirencester.63 Clearly John wanted troops available if he felt it desirable to use them. The levies of the Marcher lords combined with the Poitevins of Savaric de Mauleon who were in the same region probably made a fairly formidable force. While we do not know the purpose of Bishop Peter’s northern excursion, it seems likely that John wanted the lands of the northern rebels attacked if he decided to resort to force. It would appear that in the last days of April the king was planning to march against the baronial muster if his enemies committed an overt act. But when the barons laid siege to Northampton castle and thus placed themselves in open revolt, John did nothing very decisive. On May 5 the earls of Surrey, Salisbury, and Pembroke were sent out to perambulate the countryside with bodies of troops, probably to secure the royal castles near Northampton, but a few days later John was once again negotiating with his foes.64\n\nApparently a group of rebel barons that included Geoffrey de Mandeville and Giles de Briouse met John at Reading on May 10, and the king made a peace offer. He issued letters patent stating that he had promised the rebel lords that he would not arrest them or their men or seize their lands otherwise than by the law of the realm or the judgment of their peers until “consideracio facta fuit” by four men chosen by each party. The decisions of the four arbitrators would be subject to review by the pope. The bishops of London, Worcester, Coventry, and Rochester and Earl William de Warren would guarantee John’s good faith.65 Thus the king agreed not to use force against the rebels until some question had been considered by arbitrators and the decision reviewed by the pope. While this document does not state what was to be considered, a letter sent by John to Innocent III indicates that it was the whole schedule of baronial demands.66 Although no reference is made to any conditions that had to be accepted by the barons if this offer was to take effect, it must have been assumed that they would cease overt acts of revolt. Separate letters issued the same day promised Geoffrey de Mandeville and Giles de Briouse the judgment of the king’s court in regard to the heavy fines that placed them in debt to the crown.67 Once more John had strengthened his moral position—he had offered to submit to arbitration. Actually he was probably gambling on the advantages of delay and on his ability to sway the mind of Innocent III.\n\nThis attempt to make peace had no result. Either the barons rejected the offer or simply ignored it by continuing their siege of Northampton castle. On May 11 the king continued his military preparations. Fawkes de Bréauté and William de Harcourt were sent out to see to the defenses of the royal castles, and Winchester castle was turned over to Savaric de Mauleon to house his Poitevin troops.68 Then on May 12 John took a decisive step. He ordered the sheriffs of England to seize the lands of the rebels and sell their chattels for the king’s use.69 Two days later special orders directed the seizure of the lands of Robert fitz Walter, Robert de Vere, Henry de Bohun, Giles de Briouse, William de Mandeville, William de Huntingfield, Henry de Braybrook, and Simon de Pattishall.70 On May 15 the bailiffs of Hubert de Burgh were ordered to arrest the son of Roger de Cressi, but John with a characteristic chivalrous gesture forbade them to bother Roger’s wife.71\n\nDuring this second week of May disturbing reports and rumors reached King John. William de Montaigu, William Malet, and Robert fitz Paien were leading a rising in the southwest. On May 13 Henry de Pomeroy and John de Erley were appointed joint sheriffs of Devonshire and sent to suppress the revolt.72 The knights of the county were summoned to muster whenever Henry might direct and to obey his orders.73 But John was still moving cautiously. Peter de Maulay, constable of Corfe, was ordered to release William de Montaigu in bail if he had captured him.74 Meanwhile the main baronial army had given up the siege of Northampton castle and had been received in Bedford by William de Beauchamp. The king heard rumors that the rebels were negotiating with the citizens of London for possession of that city. On May 16 John sent Earl William of Salisbury to London to try to prevent its surrender and the next day he despatched William de Cornhill, bishop of Coventry, and Hubert de Burgh to reinforce the earl.75 As a member of the greatest of the London merchant families who had served for years at the exchequer in Westminster William de Cornhill had great influence with the Londoners. Hubert de Burgh had just returned from Poitou—presumably with a force of mercenary troops.\n\nIt seems unlikely that any of these emissaries actually reached London for the negotiations between the barons and the citizens and come to a fruitful conclusion. On the evening of Sunday, May 17, the citizens went to church leaving their gates unguarded so that the rebels could enter without difficulty. The barons occupied the city, plundered the dwellings of the king’s partisans and the Jews, and tore down the latter’s houses to obtain materials for repairing the city walls. The small but determined royal garrison in the Tower refused to surrender, but the rest of the city was in the hands of the king’s foes.76 On May 20 John ordered all his followers to do what harm they could to the traitorous citizens.77\n\nThe capture of London by the barons vitally changed the military situation. Before May 17 John could have crushed the rebels whenever he considered it politically feasible to do so. He had refrained from attacking them not because he lacked the force but in order to satisfy the pope and the rest of the baronage of the correctness of his conduct. As long as the rebel host lay in the open country, a rapid concentration of royal garrisons would have been able to destroy it. Few in number and for the most part inexperienced in warfare the rebel barons could not have withstood John’s hardy mercenary troops. If the mercenaries had been supported as they almost certainly would have been by the warhardened knights of the marcher lords, the rebels’ position would have been hopeless. But once sheltered behind the walls of London in alliance with its citizens the barons could defy a large army for a considerable time. Clearly John had waited too long. When the barons definitely put themselves in the wrong by besieging Northampton castle, the king should have massed his available forces and crushed them. It is, however, easy to explain John’s delay. His Flemish auxiliaries, by far the best of his mercenary troops, arrived in England just before the fall of London.78 With them on hand John could have destroyed the rebel army in the open field without endangering the safety of his castles by withdrawing too large a part of their garrisons for his field army.\n\nThe barons were prompt to exploit their victory. As soon as they were established in London, they addressed letters to all their fellow barons demanding their support. If they refused, the rebels would treat them as public enemies and ravage their lands.79 It is unlikely that these threats had any great effect. The fact that the barons held London might move men already strongly inclined to their party like the count of Aumale, William de Albini, and John de Lacy to take the final step and join the revolt. But the baronial army cooped up in London could do little to protect the lands of its partisans. Scattered over England were something like a hundred castles held by royal garrisons, to a large extent mercenaries. These garrisons were already plundering the lands of the king’s foes. The bulk of the English baronage waited quietly to see what was going to happen.\n\nJohn, as usual, had difficulty in making up his mind. When his Flemish knights under the command of Robert and William de Bethune joined him at Freemantle soon after the fall of London, he sent them with Earl William of Salisbury to put down the rising in the west. When Earl William and his allies reached Sherborne, they heard that the enemy was much more numerous than they were. To the great annoyance of the Flemings the earl retired to Winchester where the king was staying. John immediately sent them back to carry out their commission. This time the royal forces advanced against the rebels who fled without giving battle.80 It is impossible to discover who these western rebels were. William de Montaigu, William Malet, and Robert fitz Paien were rebels at this time, but the chronicles call the force against which the Flemish were sent “northerners.”81 Perhaps “northerner” was simply used as a synonym for rebel. On the other hand it is quite possible that Maurice de Ghent whose lands lay both in the north and the west was involved in this rising. Then it may be that Giles de Briouse had stirred into revolt the tenants of the honors of Barnstaple and Totnes.\n\nBy the last days of May King John had decided on his course of action. He would make a temporary peace with his barons relying on the pope to invalidate any concessions he might have to make to obtain it. Then he could muster his power and crush his foes when the time was ripe. On May 27 the king asked Stephen Langton to arrange a truce and ordered his officers to observe it.82 On June 15 John met his rebellious barons at Runnymede to begin the negotiations leading to the granting of Magna Carta.\n\nWhile he was reopening negotiations with his barons, the king was paving the way for his future appeal to the pope. John’s agent, Walter Mauclerk, had arrived in Rome on February 19. Ten days later Eustace de Vesci appeared to plead the baronial cause. He was commissioned to ask the pope to compel John to grant the barons’ demands.83 Apparently Walter won the argument. On March 19 Innocent wrote to Stephen Langton and his suffragans. He was greatly disturbed to hear of the dissensions between the king and some of his barons. He was particularly shocked at the report that Stephen and the bishops were involved and were said to favor the barons. The pope had no patience with armed conspiracies. The prelates were to work for peace, to declare the sworn alliances among the barons invalid, and to excommunicate any obdurate conspirators. They were to urge the barons to perform the service they owed the king and to placate him in every possible way. Then they might reverently ask him to grant their demands. The pope himself was asking John to grant his vassals’ “just petitions.” Similar letters were addressed to the barons.84 A separate mandate to the barons directed them to pay the scutage of Poitou. As the barons of England had always paid scutage, to refuse to do so was to deprive the king of his rights.85 On May 29 John despatched letters to the pope. He thanked Innocent for his letters to the prelates and barons, but regretted that they had been ignored by the recipients. John told his barons that England was part of the patrimony of St. Peter and that he was a crusader. He offered to abolish all the bad customs established by himself and Richard. When he asked the archbishop to force the barons to respect his rights as a crusader, Stephen agreed to do so if John sent home his mercenaries. But when the king kept his part of the agreement, the archbishop still did nothing. Finally John had offered to submit the disputes to arbitration, but this too had been rejected by the barons.86 John had spent several months placing himself in an impregnable position. In his letter he laid that position before Innocent III. It gave him a base to build on when he asked the pope to invalidate Magna Carta.\n\nWhile it is fairly easy to present a general account of the negotiations between King John and his disaffected barons prior to the issuing of Magna Carta, we have no precise knowledge of the issues that were under discussion at the various conferences. Three relevant documents have come down to us—the so-called Unknown Charter of Liberties, the Articles of the Barons, and Magna Carta itself.87 The Unknown Charter is by now extremely familiar to all students of Magna Carta, but no one has found any real evidence that would serve to show its place in the negotiations. Then there is no evidence as to how long the Articles of the Barons had been in existence when it was presented to John at Runnymede. I have discovered no new evidence, but it seems worth while to make a few comments with the distinct reservation that they are no more valuable than those made by my predecessors.\n\nThe Unknown Charter is a comparatively brief document. Mr. McKechnie has divided it into twelve short chapters and for the sake of convenience I shall follow his numbering in my comments. It is not actually a charter. The first chapter begins “King John concedes.” The second chapter and the rest of the document is in the first person singular—“If it happens that my baron.… I should.…” A formal charter would have been in the first person plural throughout. The document clearly represents someone’s informal notes. Nothing is known of its history except that it came into the possession of a king of France, presumably Philip Augustus, and now rests in the National Archives in Paris. It is appended to a copy of the Charter of Liberties of Henry I. Between the charter of Henry I and the Unknown Charter is the note “This is the charter of King Henry through which the barons sought their liberties and the following King John concedes.”88 The argument has been advanced that as most of the document is in the first person, it must have been dictated by King John. It is, however, perfectly conceivable that a man taking notes on oral promises made by the king or even one drawing up a list of suggestions for oral promises would adopt this form.\n\nThe substance of chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11 of the Unknown Charter is found in the Articles of the Barons and in Magna Carta. The substance of chapters 10 and 12 is found in the Charter of the Forest and presumably these questions were among those postponed in 1215. But these chapters of the Unknown Charter have interesting peculiarities. The first chapter reads “King John concedes that he will not take a man without judgment nor accept anything for justice, nor do injustice.” Thus these extremely important concessions that were relegated to the 29th and 30th chapters of the Articles of the Barons and the 39th and 40th chapters of Magna Carta are here in first place. Then the Unknown Charter provides that the lands of a minor should be in custody of four knights of the fief and a royal officer. The Articles of the Barons makes no such suggestion, but Magna Carta provides that in case a royal custodian is removed for wasting the fief he should be replaced by two vassals of the young lord. Then two of these chapters of the Unknown Charter are more radical than those in the Articles of the Barons. Chapter 5 provides that when a royal vassal died, his chattels should be divided in accord with his will. The parallel chapter of the Articles of the Barons gives precedence to debts owed the Crown. Then chapter 9 of the Unknown Charter provides for the deforesting of all forests created by Henry II, Richard, and John. The Articles of the Barons speak only of lands afforested by John, but lands afforested by his father and brother appear among the subjects reserved for later discussion in Magna Carta.\n\nChapters 7 and 8 of the Unknown Charter are quite different from those of the Articles of the Barons that deal with the same subjects. Chapter 7 reads “I concede to my men that they shall not go in the host outside England except in Normandy and Brittany and that decently and that if anyone owes the service of ten knights it will be alleviated by the advice of my barons.” Chapter 8 states “And if scutage happens in the land, one mark of silver will be taken from a knight’s fee; and if the gravity of the host necessitates it, more shall be taken by the counsel of the barons of the realm.” The Articles of the Barons make no reference to foreign service. The barons probably felt that the provision that scutage could be taken only with the counsel of the king’s vassals protected them adequately against all abuses connected with the host. Nor is there any mention in the Articles or in Magna Carta of the alleviation of military service. Yet we know that in practice this alleviation was taking place during the reigns of Richard and John and was to become definitely recognized under Henry III.89\n\nThere is no external evidence to indicate the place occupied by the Unknown Charter in the negotiations between John and his barons. I shall confine myself to advancing some very tentative conclusions based on internal evidence. First I shall glance at certain suggestions that have been made that seem to me to be clearly untenable.90 There are no grounds for calling this document “a forged charter.” If anyone wanted to forge a charter, he would have made a better job of it. No literate man of the day could mistake this document for a regular charter. If Philip Augustus wanted a copy of a charter of liberties issued by John, he could certainly have obtained a summary if not an actual copy of Magna Carta. Nor does it seem possible that the Unknown Charter represents an intermediate stage between the Articles of the Barons and Magna Carta. It is more primitive in form than the Articles and contains matter not in either the Articles or Magna Carta. At that stage of the negotiations John would hardly have offered anything not asked for in the Articles.\n\nTo my mind the internal evidence indicates that the Unknown Charter is either a set of notes made on an actual charter granted by John in 1213, notes made from oral promises given by the king at that time, or proposals for such a charter. It could well represent promises made by King John when he came to terms with the northern barons through the mediation of Langton and Nicholas of Tusculum.91 The provision that the barons owed no military service outside the realm except in Normandy and Brittany seems to me to make sense only if an expedition somewhere else was being contemplated at the time. The barons had refused to serve in Poitou—John agreed that they were not obliged to. The prominence given to the promise not to take anyone without a judgment also fits in well with this period. When John had sought to punish the northern lords for their refusal to go to Poitou, this right to a judgment was the argument advanced by Langton to halt the king’s vengeful expedition.92 And it was Stephen Langton, Eustace de Vesci, and Robert fitz Walter who would feel most keenly the need for such a promise, for their relatives and friends had recently suffered from the king’s anger. While I am still inclined to believe that it was Stephen Langton who saw that this right of a free man to a judgment was the most fundamental of all the baronial demands and who placed it first on this list, there is no proof whatever for this hypothesis.93 I simply feel that it took a more than feudal mind to place this provision ahead of those that were purely feudal in scope.\n\nFinally the presence of this document in the French archives seems to fit in with the theory that it represents promises made in 1213. King Philip had plenty of friends in England at that time. Stephen Langton, his fellow bishops, a number of lesser clergy, and Robert fitz Walter and Eustace de Vesci had just left his protection. While it seems unlikely that Langton’s sense of propriety would have allowed him to send valuable information to King Philip, there is no reason for believing that Eustace or Robert would have had any such scruples. And the document did contain immensely valuable information—that John had agreed that his vassals did not owe him actual military service in Poitou. One cannot but wonder if John’s desire to use Nantes as a base of operations in the summer of 1214 had some connection with his promise to his barons not to demand foreign service except in Normandy or Brittany.94\n\nThe Articles of the Barons was certainly presented to King John at Runnymede and the royal seal was attached to it by his command—probably on June 15. While I am inclined to believe that the Articles differed little if at all from the schedule shown John on April 27, my reasons are far from conclusive. Between the meeting at St. Edmunds in the autumn of 1214 and April 27, 1215, the barons had plenty of time and leisure to work out their demands in detail. After April 27 they must have been kept well occupied with their armed revolt and as a result had little opportunity to add to or modify their schedule. Then Roger of Wendover states that when John had heard the baronial demands as contained in the schedule he said that he would never concede them such liberties as it would make him a slave.95 Now as applied to the specific demands in the Articles this was a highly exaggerated statement, but it is reasonable if it referred to the forma securitatis—the provision for the twenty-five barons to enforce the charter. In the Articles of the Barons as in Magna Carta they were a body set above the king. As John was a man of violence in expression as well as in action and Wendover is not over accurate, this argument has not very much weight. I simply offer it for what it is worth.\n\nBy and large Magna Carta as issued by King John was the Articles of the Barons carefully worked over by highly intelligent men with a thorough knowledge of the English government. In the first place certain vagaries of arrangement were corrected. The Articles discuss in chapter 4 the right of a widow to have her dower and marriage portion without paying a fine and to remain in her husband’s house until she receives them. Then chapter 17 provides for the remarrying of widows. These two sections become chapters 7 and 8 in Magna Carta. The Articles insert the important section dealing with men who have been disseised of lands or rights by the crown between the chapter on the writ praecipe and that on inquisitions of life or members. In the great charter it is placed with similar provisions. Even more striking is the case of the last part of chapter 35 of the Articles that has little to do with the rest of the chapter but clearly belongs in chapter 3. It is put in its correct place in the great charter. Magna Carta in its final form was far from being a model of logical arrangement, but it was a great improvement in this respect over the Articles.\n\nThen throughout the men who drafted the great charter added precision and exact definition. Thus chapter 1 of the Articles says simply—“after the death of their ancestors heirs of full age shall have.…” Magna Carta puts in place of “ancestors” “any earl, baron, or other tenant-in-chief by military service.” This sort of improvement carried through the whole document turned the essentially vague and sloppy Articles into the clear and precise form for which Magna Carta is justly famous. In two cases this process was carried so far as to seem to change the meaning of the original provisions. Chapter 13 of the Articles states “assizes of nouvel disseisin and of mort d’ancestor shall be abbreviated and similarly of other assizes.” I am not sure what this meant and apparently the men reworking the charter were puzzled. Perhaps they asked the barons what they meant. At any rate the result was clearly chapter 19 of Magna Carta—“and if on the day of the shire court they cannot take the assizes, as many knights and free tenants shall remain of those who were present as shall be sufficient to be able to make judgment.…” It looks as if the barons told the drafters that too much time of too many men was wasted taking assizes and chapter 19 was an attempt to solve the need. Then chapter 14 of the Articles provides that no sheriff shall interfere with pleas of the crown without the coroners. Chapter 24 of Magna Carta forbids sheriffs, constables, coroners, or other royal bailiffs to hear pleas of the crown. How these two chapters serve the same purpose is beyond me, but they were clearly intended to. Mr. McKechnie has shown that this process of giving greater precision to Magna Carta went on even after the first formal copies had been drawn up.96\n\nMagna Carta contains two types of additions to the Articles of the Barons. Here and there clauses were added to make the provisions more workable. Thus the Articles provide that a custodian who abused his office should be removed, but made no provision for his replacement. Magna Carta corrects this defect by using an idea found in the Unknown Charter. Chapter 8 of the Articles directs the king to send justices to take assizes in the shires—Magna Carta adds “or the chief justice if we are outside the realm.” Chapter 31 of the Articles provides for the free entry of merchants into the realm—Magna Carta makes an exception of merchants from enemy lands in time of war. The last section of chapter 48 providing that the king or the justiciar be notified of the voidance of evil customs of the forest was added after at least one of the formal copies was completed. It seems unlikely that these additions required much negotiation. They may well have been made by the drafters on their own authority.\n\nThe men who drew up the Articles of the Barons foresaw that John might claim the privileges of a crusader. Apparently the decision as to this was left to Langton and his suffragans, and they seem to have decided in John’s favor. The restoration of lands and rights unjustly taken by Henry II and Richard was to await the king’s return from the crusade. Finally there are a few real additions to the Articles of the Barons. Two of these are of little importance and hard to explain. Chapter 21 of Magna Carta provides that earls and barons had to be amerced by their peers and according to the nature of their offenses. Chapter 54 forbids anyone to be taken or imprisoned on the appeal of a woman unless the charge was the slaying of her husband. Throughout John’s reign barons seem to have been accorded the privilege of being amerced by their peers. The second chapter would seem to be intended to make rape less hazardous, but that can hardly have been its chief purpose. A more important addition gives the king leave to postpone certain questions until his return from the crusade. Two of these do not appear in the Articles—the deforesting of lands afforested by Henry II and Richard and prerogative wardship. It looks as if the barons had an afterthought and asked that these be added. As John had no slightest intention of going on a crusade, he could cheerfully promise to consider them when he got back.\n\nBy far the most important addition to the Articles of the Barons found in Magna Carta is the chapter that establishes the procedure to be followed in obtaining the commune consilium regni for the levying of a scutage or gracious aid. It provides that the king should send individual writs of summons to the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and “major barons.” Then general writs were to be sent to the sheriffs summoning all other tenants-in-chief. The writs were to set a definite place of meeting, name a day at least forty days in the future, and tell the reason for the summons. On the appointed day those who were present were to proceed to do business even if all who had been summoned were not there.\n\nThe wording of this chapter leaves two interesting questions. What was a “major baron”? Was this term intended to describe the king’s tenants by barony as against other tenants-in-chief or did it simply mean the important barons? As I have indicated elsewhere, I prefer the second of these alternatives.97 It seems probable that “major barons” meant just that and that the petty tenants by barony were to be included in the general summons. Obviously this would leave the royal government some discretion as to who were to be summoned by individual writs. Then there is the question whether “all those who hold of us in chief” was intended to include the mesne tenants of baronies in the king’s hands—the tenants-in-chief de honore. As a number of rather important rebel leaders belonged in this category, it seems likely that they were meant to be included.\n\nSome writers have assumed that the assembly provided for in this chapter was the traditional great curia regis of the English kings. This would be in accord with feudal theory—a lord’s curia consisted of all his vassals. But there is no evidence that any such body had ever been summoned to serve as a council. Moreover the mere fact that the proposed assembly is described in such detail in Magna Carta indicates that it was an innovation. If the commune consilium regni was to be obtained from the great curia regis as it had previously existed, it would have been sufficient to say just that. While this innovation was sound in feudal theory, it was probably utterly impracticable. According to my calculations the king’s tenants-in-chief numbered about twelve hundred and included men who held only tiny fractions of a knight’s fee. An assembly of that size would have been extremely unwieldy and the smaller tenants-in-chief would have found attendance an unbearable burden. As this chapter was dropped when the charter was reissued along with the one it was meant to implement, it seems improbable that its provisions were ever put to the test of actual use.\n\nAs we do not know at whose behest this chapter was inserted in Magna Carta, it is hard to speculate effectively on the reasons for its inclusion. The barons may have wanted to deprive the royal government of any discretion in issuing summonses by basing eligibility on tenure. As no tenurial classification other than the very broad one adopted would have included all the rebel leaders, they felt obliged to insist on it. But if this chapter was drafted at the request of the barons, it was an afterthought on their part. It was not in the Articles they presented to the king. It seems almost as likely that this assembly was John’s idea. He may well have hoped to play off against the great lords the mass of lesser tenants-in-chief whom he believed to be more amenable to his control. The domination of such an assembly by the king would be particularly easy if, as seemed likely, few of the minor tenants-in-chief answered the summons. Then the council would consist of the great lords and the king’s servants. While comparatively few of the military and civil officials of the royal government were barons by tenure, practically all of them were tenants-in-chief of the crown. Finally one cannot neglect the possibility that this chapter was concocted by a neutral political theorist—perhaps by Stephen Langton himself. If a logical legal mind imbued with feudal custom set about providing for the assembly that could properly give the counsel of the realm on the subject of imposts to be levied on a feudal basis, it would undoubtedly have arrived at this result—an assembly of all tenants-in-chief of the crown.\n\nOne more divergence between Magna Carta and the Articles of the Barons deserves mention. The Articles state that aids and tallages could be taken from London and other cities only by the commune consilium regni. Magna Carta speaks only of London and makes no reference to tallages. This change may well have been the result of a bitter debate. As we have seen the whole military position of the rebel barons depended on their possession of London and they had to keep the good will of the citizens. But tallage was a seignorial rather than a feudal right. John could have insisted with sound reason that it was none of his vassals’ business how often or how heavily he tallaged his royal demesne. Moreover despite their desire to please the townsmen the barons would not be enthusiastic about pressing this question. Any limitation of a lord’s power to tallage his demesne would have been a serious blow to their own revenues.\n\nThe provisions of Magna Carta as issued by King John fall naturally into four groups. The first dealing with the relations between the crown and the church consists only of the first part of chapter 1. It guarantees the English church all its rights including freedom of election. As this guarantee is couched in the traditional vague phraseology, it seems of little practical importance. No English king, not even John, would have admitted that he meant to deprive the church of her rights—he would simply disagree with the clergy as to what those rights were. Again other kings of England had promised free episcopal elections but had never allowed their promises to interfere with their practices. Freedom of election could only be secured by outlawing the methods by which the crown exerted its influence on the chapters. But apparently it seemed worth while to Langton and his fellow prelates to have ancient assurances renewed.\n\nThen fifteen chapters deal with the feudal relations between the king and his vassals. Chapters 2 and 3 cover relief, 4 and 5 the right of custody, 6, 7, and 8 the right of marriage, and 12 and 14 the exaction of scutages and aids from tenants-in-chief. Chapter 15 states that the king will not “concede to anyone that he take an aid from his free men” except on the three recognized occasions. This does not mean that the king will not allow his vassals to take special aids from their men. It simply means that the king will not order his sheriffs to force the vassal’s tenants to pay. While this provision may have been intended to please the mesne tenants, it seems more likely that it was aimed at one of John’s fiscal devices. When a tenant-in-chief owed the crown a large sum, John was inclined to force him to ask an aid from his vassals to discharge the debt. The case of William de Mowbrays’ debt to the crown and the aid exacted from his vassals was undoubtedly fresh in the minds of several of the rebel barons. Chapter 16 forbids a lord to demand more service than a fief owes. Chapter 29 forbids the king to demand money payments in commutation of castleguard service if the vassal prefers to perform his service. Chapter 37 exempts certain serjeantries from prerogative wardship. Chapter 43 promises that tenants de honore will not be obliged to perform greater services to the crown than their fiefs had owed to the lords of the honors. Chapter 46 guarantees the barons their rights of patronage over the abbeys founded by their ancestors.\n\nThirty-two chapters deal with the procedures and policies of the royal administration. Ten of these have to do primarily with fiscal procedure. Chapter 9 requires the king’s officers to take a debtor’s chattels before they seize his land and to take all the property of a debtor before they distrain his pledges. Chapters 10 and 11 safeguard widows and children from usury. Chapter 25 promises that shires and hundreds will be farmed at the old farms without increments. This was an obvious blow at John’s efforts to increase the royal revenue from these sources. Chapters 26 and 27 deal with the king’s interests in the chattels of men who have died. Chapters 28, 30, and 31 limit the right of the king’s officers to requisition supplies, horses, carts, and wood for the king’s use. Chapter 32 guarantees that the crown shall enjoy the lands of a convicted felon for no longer than the customary year and a day.\n\nAnother twelve chapters are concerned with the administration of justice. Chapter 17 provides that common pleas, cases between subjects in which the crown had no direct interest, should not follow the king’s court but should be heard in a certain place—presumably at Westminster. For a number of years it had been John’s practice to have the major part of the judicial business of the realm performed by the justices that followed him from place to place. If his purpose was to keep personal control of the decisions rendered, this practice may well have annoyed the barons for that reason alone. But attendance at a migratory court must always have been both costly and inconvenient. Chapter 18 requires that the possessory assizes should be heard in the shires only and that royal justices should visit each county for this purpose four times a year. While it was undoubtedly desirable that these cases be settled promptly and it was a grave burden on all concerned to have to carry them to Westminster, this provision was entirely impracticable. To send two justices into each shire four times a year would have required a large increase in the number of justices and no shire really wanted these powerful royal agents to come so frequently. The issue of 1217 provided for one visit a year. Chapters 20, 21, and 22 regulated amercements. Chapter 24 forbade sheriffs, constables, and coroners to hear pleas of the crown. Chapter 34 forbade the use of the writ praecipe to remove a case from a feudal court. This provision should probably be classed as feudal rather than judicial in its purpose. It was an attempt to preserve some of the importance of the baronial curiae.98 Chapters 36 and 40 prohibit the sale of justice. Chapter 39 is the famous section that protects all free-men from punishment without due process of law. As we have seen this was the first chapter in the Unknown Charter. It was extremely close to the heart of all John’s foes both lay and clerical. But in attempting to safeguard themselves, their relatives, and their friends John’s enemies devised a most effective shield against governmental tyranny. It seems likely that Stephen Langton at least realized that this chapter expressed a principle that was fundamental to any reign of law.\n\nFour chapters of the charter are concerned with the administration of the king’s hunting privileges—with the forests and river banks. Chapter 23 promises that only where it is customary shall men be forced to build bridges over streams to facilitate the royal hawking. Chapter 44 frees men not living in the forest from attendance at its courts unless they have business there. Chapter 47 provides for the deforestation of lands afforested by John and the removal of restrictions placed by him on hawking meadows. Chapter 48 directs that twelve knights shall be chosen in every shire court to inquire into evil, that is new, forest customs and to survey the conduct of the king’s officers including the sheriffs. If they found evil customs and these were not corrected in forty days, the knights could correct them after notifying the king or the justiciar.\n\nFinally five chapters dealing with the practices of the government fall into the class of general legislation. Chapter 33 forbids weirs in streams—a delightfully optimistic attempt to improve navigation. It was probably a pleasant and totally ineffective gesture to please the Londoners. Chapter 35 decrees that common measures shall be used in all the realm—a worthy idea that can have met with little opposition from either crown or baronage. Chapter 41 seeks to protect foreign merchants. Chapter 42 provides free entrance to and exit from England for all travellers in time of peace. Chapter 45 promises that the king will appoint as officials only men who know the laws of the realm and mean to observe them. This may well have been aimed at the appointment of foreigners—or in fact at the appointment of anyone not pleasing to the barons.\n\nThese three groups of provisions have one general characteristic—they are aimed at what the barons considered abuses in the policy of the crown and the royal administration. Although a few of the forbidden practices were innovations made by John, most of them were long standing. These provisions would on the whole have been just as reasonable and pertinent if they had been made under Henry II or Richard. The fourth group was directly concerned with the immediate situation and with certain of John’s practices. John had taken hostages from the barons whose loyalty he doubted and had obliged them to make out charters promising fidelity to him. Chapter 49 provides that both hostages and charters shall be returned. Chapter 50 directs the removal from office of Gerard de Athies, Engelard de Cigogné, Andrew, Peter, and Guy de Chancelis, Guy de Cigogné, Geoffrey de Martini and his brothers, and Philip Marc and his brothers and nephew. These men were all Angevins who had followed John to England. They were able soldiers and efficient if heavy-handed administrators. Gerard de Athies had led the royal attacks on William de Briouse. Geoffrey de Martini had held Northampton castle against the rebel host. It is easy to see why these men were hated—the puzzle is to understand why the list is not longer. When Roger of Wendover came to insert the charter in his history, he seems to have felt that the list could stand improvement. He added Fawkes de Bréauté and “all the Flemings.”99 In chapter 51 John promises to send home all his foreign troops. Chapters 52 and 55 contain the provisions that were of greatest interest to the barons as individuals. In chapter 52 John promised to restore all lands, castles, or rights taken by him without a judgment by his court. If a debate arose on any such question, it was to be settled by the twenty-five barons. Chapter 55 provides that all illegal fines or amercements made by him shall be forgiven or settled by the twenty-five. Then chapters 56-59 give the Welsh and Scots allies of the barons what they themselves are promised. They are to receive anything taken from them, and their hostages are to be returned.\n\nThe barons had no confidence in King John’s promises. They felt sure that he would try to persuade the pope to declare the charter invalid. Even if he failed in that, they expected him to ignore its provisions. Hence they tried to devise a scheme for guaranteeing its execution. The barons, presumably the rebels, were to choose twenty-five of their number to act as a committee to enforce the charter. If John or one of his officers violated a provision of the charter, the offense was to be reported to four barons of the twenty-five. They would ask the king or his justiciar to correct the matter. If no action were taken within forty days, the case would be put before the full committee. Then the twenty-five cum communa totius terrae would wage war on the king until he complied with the request. Any Englishman who wished could swear to obey the orders of the twenty-five in enforcing the charter. In fact the king would command all men to swear to support the committee. If a vacancy occurred in the twenty-five, the others would choose a man to fill it. In case of disagreement in the committee, the issue would be decided by majority vote. Finally John promised not to seek the invalidation of the charter.\n\nThis plan has been criticized on the ground that it established revolt and civil war as the means of enforcing the charter. But the final sanction behind all contracts is force, and rebellion or the threat of rebellion was the only means by which the barons could hope to control the king. The deficiencies of the plan lay in the barons’ motives or lack of imagination—perhaps in both. In issuing Magna Carta John recognized formally the existence of a system of law that bound him as well as his people. The barons were unwilling to allow the royal government to interpret and administer that law. How could they expect the king to be willing to allow them to perform that function? The intelligent solution would have been some form of a tribunal that had the appearance at least of neutrality. A body composed of men like Stephen Langton and William Marshal might well have enforced the charter successfully. But the committee of baronial partisans could only lead to civil war. John could never trust his foes nor willingly submit to the humiliation of being ruled by them. Moreover the real interest of the barons, as they soon demonstrated, lay not in the general clauses of Magna Carta and their enforcement but in the recovery of the rights they claimed as individuals. The barons clearly thought of the committee of twenty-five primarily as a means of securing these private rights—lands, castles, and privileges. If one asks why the men who had sufficient imagination to devise the assembly of tenants-in-chief to give counsel in levying aids did not think of the possibility of having the committee to enforce the charter elected by such a body, the answer probably is that they did not want a neutral group. They wanted to secure their claims and they were fully aware that many of these claims rested on extremely tenuous legal foundations.\n\nMagna Carta has often been described as a “feudal” document. This is both true and misleading. The basic idea underlying Magna Carta—that there was a system of law and custom that governed the relations between lord and vassals—was essentially feudal. It is not, however, very far removed from the church’s conception of God’s law. As I have suggested before, Langton may well have thought of this feudal law as a sort of subsidiary to divine law in the realm of secular politics. But John and his barons were undoubtedly thinking in the feudal terms of the environment in which they lived. Then, as we have seen, a number of chapters of Magna Carta dealt with purely feudal relationships—the lord’s rights of relief, wardship, marriage, and the exaction of aids from his vassals. As the rebel barons were the king’s vassals, these chapters were perhaps the ones that interested them most next to those designed to secure their individual claims against the crown. Certainly the chapters dealing with feudal relationships came first in the charter. But it is extremely important to remember that John was king as well as feudal lord of England and that this distinction was fully understood by the men of his day. The minute he learned of Richard’s death John called himself dominus Angliae—that title was his by inheritance. But he was not king until he had been crowned with the assent of the barons of the realm. Now thirty-two of the sixty odd chapters of Magna Carta deal with the relations between the English king and his subjects. The charter defines these subjects who had rights that the king was bound to observe as liberi homines, free men. Thus the feudal concept of a system of law that governed the relations between lords and vassals was carried over into the realm of non-feudal political relationships. The rights of the freeman against the king were made as sacred as those of the vassal against his lord. Now this transference of a feudal concept into the field of non-feudal politics was not entirely new—it was implicit in certain chapters of the Charter of Liberties of Henry I. But the men who drafted Magna Carta consciously emphasized it. The last sentence of the first chapter states: “We grant to all the freemen of our realm, from us and our heirs forever, all the undermentioned liberties to have and to hold for them and their heirs from us and our heirs.” The charter was not a grant to the tenants-in-chief of the crown but to all the freemen of England.\n\nOn June 19 King John issued letters patent formally notifying his officers that peace had been made “between us, our barons, and the freemen of our realm” and directing them to carry out the provisions of Magna Carta. The charter was to be read publicly in every shire—presumably in the shire court. Each sheriff was to see that the men of his shire took the required oath to the twenty-five barons. The twenty-five or a majority of them were to set a day and place for the men of the shire to take this oath before them or their duly appointed representatives. At the first meeting of the shire court twelve knights were to be elected to inquire into bad customs maintained by the sheriff or other royal officials. The king’s servants were to see that all the provisions of the charter were observed.100 While this writ implies that a copy of the charter was being sent with it, it seems doubtful that enough copies of the charter were ready by June 19.101 Under the terms of the writ the sheriff would not actually need the text of the charter until the next meeting of his shire court.\n\nApparently these royal letters did not fully satisfy the barons. A week after they were issued, they were reinforced. Letters to the sheriffs and to the groups of knights elected to inquire into evil customs ordered the seizure of the lands and chattels of all men who refused to take the oath to the twenty-five barons. If anyone remained obdurate for two weeks more, his chattels were to be sold and the proceeds used for the crusade.102 The fact that these letters were considered necessary indicates that the freemen of the realm were not showing unrestrained enthusiasm for taking the oath to the twenty-five. In fact the barons were still troubled over this matter in August.103\n\nThe conclusion of peace between John and his barons involved changes in the personnel of the royal government. Although no reference to the office of justiciar is made in the great charter, it is clear that the removal of Peter des Roches was one of the conditions of the peace. On the day agreement was reached, John appointed to this high office Hubert de Burgh.104 This arrangement was obviously a compromise. Hubert had always been a loyal and, except for a brief period of estrangement, a trusted servant of John. Yet he was an Englishman and hence more acceptable to the barons than Peter. Moreover either because of ancient tenurial relations or because of relationship by marriage Hubert had the support of the powerful Earl Warren. Although he had had little experience as a judge and presumably no great knowledge of the law, he was an experienced administrator and a tried and able captain. He had been the king’s chamberlain, the constable of Chinon, and the seneschal of Poitou.\n\nJohn on his side was naturally disinclined to retain in office men who had been active partisans of the rebellious barons. On June 25 Reginald de Cornhill and Henry de Braybrook were deprived of their shrievalties. Hubert de Burgh replaced Reginald de Cornhill in Kent and Surrey while William de Duston took the place of Henry de Braybrook as sheriff of Northamptonshire.105 Four days later John Marshal was appointed sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in place of John fitz Robert.106 Then Magna Carta provided for the removal from office of certain foreign mercenary captains. Here King John showed no great haste. It was not until July 8 and July 19 that Engelard de Cigogné was deprived of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. In Gloucestershire he was replaced by Ralph Musard, a local baron, while Herefordshire was added to the group of shires in the hands of the new justiciar.107 When Hubert de Burgh took over Norfolk and Suffolk from John Marshal on July 25, he was sheriff of four counties.108 During July two foreigners mentioned in the charter were removed as constables of royal castles. Geoffrey de Martini was directed to surrender Northampton castle to the sheriff, Roger de Neville.109 Peter de Cancellis, constable of Bristol, was replaced by Philip de Albini, a loyal servant of John’s who was a relative of the lord of Belvoir.110 But Philip Marc, sheriff of Nottingham and Derby, remained in office.\n\nUndoubtedly the provisions of Magna Carta that were of greatest interest to the baronial leaders were those providing for the reduction of extortionate fines and amercements and the restoration of lands, castles, and privileges improperly held by the crown. King John was anxious to delay the execution of these provisions of the charter, but the barons insisted on immediate action. The reasons behind the baronial attitude are easy to comprehend—once they disbanded their forces and abandoned their stronghold, the city of London, any attempt to coerce the king would have to start all over again from the beginning. One cannot be so positive about John’s motives. He may well have had grave doubts about the justice of many of the baronial claims and a sincere desire to examine them closely before acting. On the other hand he may have already despatched messengers to Rome to persuade the pope to invalidate the charter. Certainly it was to his advantage to delay if he hoped to avoid making restoration.\n\nThe result was a series of compromises. Some claims, in general the most reasonable ones, were granted at once while the consideration of others was postponed. Letters close of June 19 addressed to Earl William of Salisbury make clear what was happening. John reminded his brother that he had promised to restore lands and castles that had been seized without proper legal action. He had asked Henry de Bohun, earl of Hereford, to allow him to postpone the restoration of the castle and barony of Trowbridge. Earl Henry had agreed that Earl William might hold the castle until June 28, but he had insisted on the immediate restoration of the “flat lands.” The earl of Salisbury was directed to put Earl Henry’s agents in possession of the barony.111 As we have indicated above the rights of the controversy over the honor of Trowbridge are hard to determine. The fact that eventually Earl Henry ceded part of the barony to his rival might be taken as evidence that there was justice on both sides, but it could also mean simply that the earl of Hereford was too slow about submitting to the government at the close of the civil war.112 Certainly the barony had been seized without final action in the curia regis and hence should have been restored under the terms of the charter. On August 1 Earl William received extensive grants from the royal demesne to compensate him for his loss of Trowbridge.113\n\nDuring the last half of June, 1215, King John placed a number of estates in the possession of their baronial claimants. Count William of Aumale received the manor of Driffield in Yorkshire.114 Henry I, Richard, and John had regarded this manor as part of the royal demesne, but count William’s grandfather, William le Gros, had held it under Henry II.115 As the highly inconstant count of Aumale shifted to the royal party during this period, the grant of Driffield may have been more of a bribe than a restoration.116 Earl Richard de Clare was given the town of Buckingham to which his claim was absolutely sound at least as a custodian.117 Earl Richard had given Buckingham, the caput of the honor of Giffard, to William de Briouse the younger in marriage with his daughter.118 The earl had a good claim to the custody of the town until young John de Briouse came of age. Roger de Montbegon was given some land that John had granted him as count of Mortain but had seized during one of Roger’s frequent periods of disgrace.119 The manor of Ailsbury and the honor of Berkhamsted were given to William de Mandeville.120 As these lands had been formally granted to Geoffrey fitz Peter, William’s claim was good.121 There is, however, some doubt as to whether he was actually given seisin.\n\nThe castle of Fotheringay which had been taken into the king’s hands at the time of Robert fitz Walter’s revolt in 1212 was restored to David, earl of Huntingdon.122 Saher de Quency received the fortress of Mountsorrel that belonged to his half of the honor of Leicester.123 The great castle of Richmond was restored to its hereditary constable, Ruald fitz Alan.124 These grants represented the recognition of unquestionable rights. Robert fitz Walter received the custody of Hertford castle.125 Robert’s claim to the custody of this castle was not very strong. His wife’s ancestor, Peter de Valognes, had been sheriff"
