        "text": "Norm Hewitt, who has died of motor neurone disease aged 55, was a rugby player who put in a series of dynamic displays at hooker for the All Blacks; he became best known in Britain for his angry confrontation with his English opposite number Richard Cockerill during the haka at Old Trafford in 1997.\n\nThe default setting when New Zealand perform the haka, their Maori war dance, before each match, is silent respect; teams often link arms in solidarity, but by and large meek acceptance is the norm as the opponents stand well away in their own half. But when England were the hosts at Old Trafford the atmosphere was febrile, and as the All Blacks began the haka, the hosts shifted up to the halfway line, dangerously close.\n\nCockerill took it further, moving to within an inch of Hewitt; words were exchanged and the English player pushed Hewitt away.\n\nThe England captain Martin Johnson, Cockerill recalled, turned to him. “I was hoping for some advice, but he said, ‘Cocker, what the f--- have you done?” Any fears Johnson had about motivating the visitors were well founded, as they went on to win 25-8.\n\n“It was like there were only two people on that field,” Hewitt recalled. “It was a big game and we were going to war, and he’s my enemy – a kill-or-be-killed scenario.”\n\nAfterwards, the All Blacks coach John Hart was scathing. “It was total disrespect on England’s part. All we ask is for some respect towards our culture. That kind of behaviour has got no place on the football field.”\n\nOf Maori descent, Norman Jason Hewitt was born in Hastings, New Zealand, on November 11 1968. In his 2001 autobiography Gladiator he wrote that he suffered abuse during his time as a boarder at Te Aute College, which he partly blamed for his problems with alcohol and anger management in adult life.\n\nHe made his debut for Hawke’s Bay in 1988, going on to contribute to two famous victories, the 29-17 win against the touring Lions in 1993 and the 30-25 victory over France the following year. He played for Southland from 1995 to 97, for Wellington from 1999 to 2001 and for the Super 12 team Hurricanes between 1996 and 2001.\n\nHe made his All Blacks debut in 1993, but found his appearances limited at first by the presence of the formidable Sean Fitzpatrick, and he went on to play in only nine Tests over the next five years – eight victories and a draw – as well as appearing in 14 non-Test matches and winning 15 caps for New Zealand Maori.\n\nIn 2000 he captained Wellington to the National Provincial Championship; for many observers, his performance in the 34-29 win against Canterbury in the final, playing much of the game with a broken arm, was his finest 80 minutes in rugby.\n\nDuring his career there had been several alcohol-related off-field incidents – his teammates were said to be wary of him when he had a drink inside him – and in 1999, Hewitt publicly and tearfully apologised after drunkenly breaking into a hotel room in Queensland.\n\nHis teammates felt he was crying wolf, he later admitted, but the experience proved transformative, and when Hewitt retired in 2001 he became a youth mentor working in drug and alcohol prevention and as an ambassador for several charities; he came to stand as a symbol of rugby union’s changing culture, moving away from the brutal, booze-sodden days of old.\n\nHis personal redemption seemed complete when he won the first series of Dancing with the Stars, the Kiwi version of Strictly Come Dancing, in 2005; he donated his prize money to a literacy charity.\n\nNorm Hewitt is survived by his wife Arlene, a former world aerobics champion, and by their daughter and son. His brother Rob, a naval diver, was rescued in 2006 after spending four days floating in the sea off the coast of Porirua on North Island.\n\nNorm Hewitt, born November 11 1968, died July 15 2024"
