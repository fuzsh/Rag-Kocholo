        "text": "John (24 December 1166 â 19 October 1216) was King of England from 1199 until his death in 1216. He lost the Duchy of Normandy and most of his other French lands to King Philip II of France, resulting in the collapse of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the French Capetian dynasty during the 13th century. The baronial revolt at the end of John's reign led to the sealing of Magna Carta, a document considered an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom. John was the youngest of the four surviving sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was nicknamed John Lackland because he was not expected to inherit significant lands. ... John was made Count of Mortain, was married to the wealthy Isabella of Gloucester, and was given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of Cornwall, Derby, Devon, Dorset, Nottingham and Somerset, all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the King was on crusade. ... John's decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of AngoulÃªme. In order to remarry, John first needed to abandon his wife Isabella, Countess of Gloucester; the King accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal dispensation to marry the Countess in the first placeâas a cousin, John could not have legally wedded her without this. ... John's personal life greatly affected his reign. Contemporary chroniclers state that John was sinfully lustful and lacking in piety. It was common for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses, but chroniclers complained that John's mistresses were married noblewomen, which was considered unacceptable. John had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage, and two of those mistresses are known to have been noblewomen. John's behaviour after his second marriage is less clear, however. None of his known illegitimate children were born after he remarried, and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point ... John and Isabella of AngoulÃªme had five children: 1. Henry III, King of England (1 October 1207 â 16 November 1272) 2. Richard, King of the Romans (5 January 1209 â 2 April 1272) 3. Joan, Queen of Scotland (22 July 1210 â 4 March 1238) 4. Isabella, Holy Roman Empress (1214 â 1 December 1241) 5. Eleanor, Countess of Pembroke (1215 â 13 April 1275) John had more than ten known illegitimate children, of whom the best known are: 1. Richard FitzRoy (c.â1190 â June 1246) whose mother was Adela, John's first cousin 2. Joan, Lady of Wales (c.â1191 â February 1237) also known by her Welsh name of Siwan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John,_King_of_England ------------------------------------------------------------------ Timeline for King John Year Event 1199 John accedes to the throne on the death of his brother, Richard I. 1204 England loses most of its possessions in France. 1205 John refuses to accept Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury 1208 Pope Innocent III issues an Interdict against England, banning all church services except baptisms and funerals 1209 Pope Innocent III excommunicates John for his confiscation of ecclesiastical property 1209 Cambridge University founded 1212 Innocent III declares that John is no longer the rightful King 1213 John submits to the Popeâs demands and accepts the authority of the Pope 1214 Philip Augustus of France defeats the English at the Battle of Bouvines 1215 Beginning of the Barons' war.
