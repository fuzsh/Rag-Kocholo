Where did you hear such a peculiar thing? Presumably no king would *want* to be called John, because of the unhappy associations (King John is traditionally regarded as a Weak Man but a Bad King, or possibly vice versa), but that's not the same. Prince Charles, similarly, apparently does not wish to be known as Charles III when he becomes king, because of the associations with Charles I. Of course, such concerns are pretty pointless because the average British person wouldn't have the faintest idea who Charles I was or what he did, far less King John.\n\nNow, if a king were *Catholic*, that would be a whole different matter...\n\nRoyal\n\nWarlord\n\nJoined\n\nOct 24, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n191\n\nDec 7, 2005\n\n#5\n\nMy dad said someone told him, so...\n\nI told him the John thing with the Magna Carter, but he wasn't convinced.\n\nSomethingWitty\n\nPrince\n\nJoined\n\nOct 19, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n533\n\nDec 8, 2005\n\n#6\n\nLord Cerberus said:\n\nThis is false.\n\nThere is one King John of England.

Robert the Bruce hated him for family reasons, and since he was credited as the saviour of Scotland, his opinion still held considerable sway, even though he was dead for about 60 years at that point. Also, John's son made several attempts (successfully, although it didn't last for long) to usurp the throne from the House of Bruce in the 1330s.\n\nAnyways, it didn't work. Robert III was a terrible king regardless."
