        "text": "About\n\nDuring the early thirteenth century, he served for nearly two decades as King of England. Though he spent much of his reign trying to reclaim land captured by France, he also instituted legal reforms that shaped England's common law judicial system. Near the end of his reign, in 1215, he signed the Magna Carta.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nHe was the favorite child of his father, who conferred upon him the title of Lord of Ireland.\n\nTrivia\n\nAfter he died of dysentery in 1216, he was succeeded by his son Henry III of England.\n\nFamily Life\n\nHe and his four older brothers were the children of Eleanor of Aquitaine and King Henry II. His two marriages -- to Isabella, Countess of Gloucester and Isabella, Countess of Angouleme -- produced a total of five children.\n\nAssociated With"
