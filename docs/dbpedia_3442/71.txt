The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is one of the most significant transport infrastructure projects under construction in Australia today. In these times of limited public funding available for such projects, it could not have been implemented without funding from the private sector. The project was developed at a time when there had been few precedents for handling such projects and consequently it has been an important influence on the way such projects have been handled since. The paper describes the history of the project leading to the acceptance of the Transfield Kumagai Joint Venture's proposal to design, build, own, operate and finance the Sydney Harbour Tunnel and outlines the influence that this project has had on other privately funded infrastructure projects in Australia. The paper also presents the engineering process undertaken, whereby a practical design was developed to solve a well recognised community transportation need.
