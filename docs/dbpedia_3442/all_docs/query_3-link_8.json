        "text": "In 2022, Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW) implemented the Asset Manager model for delivery of the Western Harbour Tunnel and Sydney Harbour Tunnel, pioneering a unique approach to infrastructure procurement. The Asset Manager model, the first of its kind, leverages the expertise and resources of the asset owner, design and construction contractor, and asset manager to achieve improved sustainability and whole-of-life outcomes, underpinned with an Infrastructure Sustainability rating.\n\nThe key features of this model include the early procurement of the Asset Manager, who contributes their expertise into the design, procurement, and construction phases. This ensures that whole-of-life considerations are incorporated from the beginning, leading to resource savings, knowledge sharing, and optimised performance.\n\nTfNSW recognised the importance of whole-of-life solutions for the long-term performance of the Western Harbour Tunnel. They sought an Asset Manager organisation with demonstrated expertise in tunnel operations, maintenance, and lifecycle management. By incorporating the Asset Manager's input early in the project, TfNSW ensured that their recommendations were appropriately incorporated when the cost and ease of change were still low.\n\nTo achieve early input, the Asset Manager needed to be involved in conjunction with the design and construction procurement. TfNSW considered various models such as DCOM, PPP, and the Asset Manager model. They recognised that the independence of the Asset Manager was crucial for obtaining the best whole-of-life advice. Consortia often have obligations that prioritise their own interests, which may not align with optimising whole-of-life outcomes. By pursuing the Asset Manager model, TfNSW could select the best Asset Manager based on merit alone.\n\nTfNSW also aimed to attract greater investment in asset management capabilities to Australia. They were concerned about the skills and capacity available in the market and wanted to retain the knowledge of the incumbent staff on Sydney Harbour Tunnel. The Asset Manager model addressed these concerns and provided a framework to encourage investment in asset management and sustainability capabilities over the long-term.\n\nSignificant work was undertaken to develop the business case, service delivery model, commercial model, contract model, and contract administration tools necessary to implement the Asset Manager model. TfNSW collaborated with a range of advisors, led by CBS Group. The advisors included Infrastructure Advisory Group, Ashurst, Firecone, and CICA, who provided technical specification, market advisory, project management, transition management support services, commercial advisory, contract administration tools, and lifecycle modelling toolset.\n\nThe client representatives for this nomination are John Hardwick, Executive Director, Transport for New South Wales; Peter Murphy, Commercial Lead, Transport for New South Wales and Jeff Dusting, Principal Advisor, CBS Group.\n\nThe implementation of the Asset Manager model for the Western Harbour Tunnel project has yielded several outcomes that the potential to transform the way projects are procured in the future. These outcomes encompass various aspects such as optimised performance, reduced risk, improved customer outcomes, and enhanced sustainability. The community stands to gain significant advantages from these outcomes.\n\nThe outcomes of the Asset Manager model included:\n\nOptimised Performance: By incorporating whole-of-life considerations from the beginning, the Asset Manager model achieves improved performance outcomes for the Western Harbour Tunnel. The expertise and knowledge of the Asset Manager contributes to better design, procurement, and construction decisions, leading to a more efficient and reliable infrastructure asset.\n\nThe public will benefit from E, S and G outcomes, with reduced travel times (and lower customer emissions), improved journey experiences, and increased accessibility. With optimised performance, the tunnel will be better equipped to handle the growing transportation demands of the community, ensuring smoother and more reliable connections between different areas. This contributes to a more connected and accessible community, facilitating economic growth, social interactions, and overall quality of life.\n\nReduced Risk: The early involvement of the Asset Manager helps to identify and mitigate risks throughout the project lifecycle. By considering the long-term implications of design and construction decisions, potential risks are addressed proactively, minimising the likelihood of disruptions and costly remedial actions in the future.\n\nThe community will benefit from increased safety and reliability. The Asset Manager model's risk mitigation efforts minimise the chances of incidents or unexpected failures, ensuring a safer transportation environment for users. This is especially crucial for a major infrastructure asset like the Western Harbour Tunnel, as it serves as a vital link for commuters and freight transportation. Reduced risk leads to increased confidence in the system, attracting more users and contributing to the overall well-being of the community.\n\nImproved Customer Outcomes: The Asset Manager model prioritised customer-centric solutions. By considering the entire lifecycle of the asset, including operation, maintenance, energy consumptions/emissions and user experience, the model ensured that the needs and expectations of the customers were met effectively. This resulted in enhanced safety, convenience, and overall satisfaction for the users of the Western Harbour Tunnel and Sydney Harbour Tunnel.\n\nThe community will benefit from enhanced convenience, comfort, and satisfaction. The Asset Manager model focuses on factors such as user safety, accessibility, and service reliability. By incorporating these considerations into the design and operation of the tunnel, the model aims to provide an improved journey experience for commuters. This includes factors like well-maintained facilities, effective signage, efficient traffic management, and user-friendly interfaces. The improved customer outcomes contribute to a more positive and seamless travel experience, enhancing the overall liveability of the community.\n\nEnhanced Sustainability and Resilience: Incorporating whole-of-life thinking into the project enables TfNSW to address sustainability and resilience challenges. The Asset Manager model facilitates the integration of sustainable practices, such as energy-efficient operations, eco-friendly materials, and proactive maintenance strategies. This approach ensured the long-term viability of the asset while minimising environmental impact.\n\nThe shared benefits from reduced environmental impact and increased resilience. Sustainable practices employed in the Asset Manager model lead to lower energy consumption, decreased carbon emissions, and minimised resource waste. This contributes to mitigating climate change and improving air quality, benefiting the overall well-being of the community. Additionally, the emphasis on resilience better prepares the tunnel to withstand environmental challenges such as extreme weather events, ensuring uninterrupted transportation services for the community even in adverse conditions.\n\nAll outcomes will be quantified and independently verified via the IS for Operations rating. An IS for Operations score of 50 is being targeted within the first three years, with progressively increasing performance to a score of 75+ by 2032, which should deliver the community some of the best performing infrastructure in Australia."
