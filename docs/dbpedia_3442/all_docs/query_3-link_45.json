        "text": "The Opera House epitomises the late 20th century’s daring use of modern concrete design and construction techniques. The building is famous for its innovative use of exposed structural concrete as a key architectural feature.\n\nThe concourse, which provides pedestrian and vehicle access to the building, is the most notable feature of the building’s concrete base. Ove Arup designed folded pre-stressed concrete beams to support the base structure. By integrating the techniques of folded plate structures and prestressing, he enabled the creation of expansive open spaces inside the podium, such as the Box Office Foyer, without the need for structural columns.\n\nThe wind loads for the sail’s curved surfaces were unknown and had to be determined. Our team pioneered the use of wind tunnel testing for buildings which is now common practice in design for large buildings all over the world.\n\nThe Opera House’s glass walls enclose the openings between the roof sails and the podium structure. Laminated glass was chosen for its toughness and ability to be shaped on site, yet little was known about its use for architectural design. Our team undertook a research programme to understand the structural behaviour of architectural laminates. Equipped with this knowledge, we designed the first large-scale example of using glass as a structural load bearing material in a building.\n\nPreserving and evolving the Sydney Opera House’s legacy\n\nThe structural engineering of the Opera House becomes increasingly more complex over time as it is progressively altered to accommodate modifications, upgrades and renewal projects, which are necessary to maintain the place as a functional public building and leading performing arts centre.\n\nFrom repairs and maintenance to major upgrades, our team continues Ove’s work preserving and evolving the Sydney Opera House for future generations of visitors, artists and performers so everyone can enjoy this global icon.\n\nFrom repairs and maintenance to major upgrades, our team continues Ove’s work preserving and evolving the Sydney Opera House for future generations of visitors, artists and performers so everyone can enjoy this global icon."
