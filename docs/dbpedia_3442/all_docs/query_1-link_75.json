        "text": "The paper examines the BOT (build-operate-transfer) projects as a viable model of public-private partnership. Its purpose is to reveal their conceptual framework, evolution, modern interpretations and implementation benefits. In view of the current economic realities of global financial deficit there are budget constraints at all levels of government in every country. The BOT projects can be considered as an alternative strategy for solving the financial and social problems of each government. They are a popular instrument of modernizing the transport infrastructure, energy sector, telecommunications, water supply, preserving of environment, etc. Key words: BOT projects, build-operate-transfer, concessions, project finance, infrastructure\n\nA full understanding of the implementation of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is essential. PPPs should be considered in sectors where there is need for improvement of infrastructure and service delivery. Every government should have legislation and a regulatory framework on PPPs to facilitate local and foreign investors to implement new projects. The absence of a legal and regulatory framework on PPPs hinders close collaboration between the public and private sectors. This article argues that the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project is an excellent model for governments in SSA where there is lack of infrastructure to provide better service delivery. Most BOT projects require sizeable fi nancial investment. Many governments prefer to use BOT for construction of specifi c infrastructure such as new electricity power plants, toll roads, prisons, dams and water plants. Experience shows that BOT agreements tend to reduce market and credit risk for the priv...\n\nIt is estimated that Africa needs $93 billion annually until 2020 in order to bridge its infrastructure deficit. It is through significant investment in infrastructure development that economic growth and poverty alleviation can be enhanced. However central to all construction projects is an effective and sustainable procurement system. There is a notable shift by some African governments to turn to the private sector to design, build, finance and operate infrastructure facilities previously provided by the public sector in the form of Public Private Partnerships (PPP’s). As an innovative financing model, PPPs present an opportunity to governments to improve service delivery. Accordingly, this paper focuses on assessing international best practices as to how some developing nations tap into the resources of the private sector in implementing their infrastructure projects. The study is a result of critical review, synthesis and contextualization of relevant academic literature, confe...\n\nThis Policy Discussion Paper should not be reported as representing the views of the IMF. The views expressed in this Policy Discussion Paper are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy. Policy Discussion Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. Prompted by tight budget constraints and by the desire to raise efficiency, governments around the world have increasingly delegated the provision of a variety of infrastructure services to the private sector. Involving the private sector, however, raises difficult legal and regulatory issues: public-private partnerships (PPPs) are more complex, entail longer-term arrangements than seen in traditional public procurement. This paper discusses four key questions: (i) What are the main legal issues that need to be addressed in order to create a favorable environment for PPPs, and how have these been tackled in various countrie...\n\nIn many developed and developing countries there has been a move toward increased reliance on Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure development. This involves an engagement with, or participation of, private companies and the public sector in the financing and provision of infrastructure. In most countries these PPP arrangements have been aimed at overcoming broad public sector constraints in relation to either a lack of public capital; and/or a lack of public sector capacity, resources and specialised expertise to develop, manage, and operate infrastructure assets. Public Private Partnerships are now commonly used to accelerate economic growth, development and infrastructure delivery and to achieve quality service delivery and good governance. The spectrum of nature and types of public private partnerships (PPPs) are overwhelming, making a definition of a PPP difficult. In addition, there have been tremendous developments in the use of PPP in many countries that has...\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to analyse Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in the developing and emerging economies as a multifaceted challenge from viewpoint of the 10 keys ‘for’ and ‘against’ PPPs: feasibility; planning; optimization; modernization and development; financing; project delivery; project operation; supervision; user satisfaction and accounting issues. The conceptual model and the reasons were formulated by the authors some 10 years ago, based on the literature and case-study reviews. Relevance of those reasons was verified in practice. The knowledge and critical perspective on the above-stated reasons are relevant for the implementation of PPP projects in any national economy developed, emerging or developing, but it is quintessential for the implementation of PPPs in the economies that are at the early stage of implementation of PPPs.
