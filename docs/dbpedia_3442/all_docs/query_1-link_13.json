        "text": "Itâ€™s been fun working on the Sydney Harbour Tunnel financing over the past couple of years, so yesterday we braved the wind and rain and walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge as a 'site visit' to mark a few milestones in Bridge / SHT history last week - both the 30th anniversary of the opening of 'the Tunnel' and also the expiry of the PPP concession, which meant ownership and operations were transferred back to the NSW Government. When the SHT contract was signed by the NSW Government and the Transfield / Kumagai Gumi JV in 1987, the $750m tunnel was the largest privately financed piece of infrastructure in Australia. At the time it represented a number of â€˜firstsâ€™ including the first Public Private Partnership in NSW and the first so-called Unsolicited Proposal in NSW (where the private sector proposes the project to government, rather than the government initiating the procurement process), which caused some controversy at the time. Living in Sydney most of my life, the SHT has featured heavily in day-to-day life. I remember the days before the Tunnel, when weâ€™d often sit in heavy traffic on the Bridge and any type of incident caused massive delays around the city. The SHT provided instant relief to traffic flow across the Harbour and tens of thousands of vehicles use it each day now. When I was in high school nearby in North Sydney, some schoolmates and I walked through the tunnel on its opening day on 30 August 1992. And more than once my old uni car broke down on the Bridge or in the SHT.. So when SHT General Counsel David East called me a couple of years ago to get Allens to act for the SHT financiers in relation to the hand-back arrangements, I was delighted to get involved (with my Allens colleagues Taylor Spensieri and Josh Graffi) just to be a part of it. Getting into the old documents and looking at early PPP (or then called â€˜BOOTâ€™) legal 'technology' was very interesting. Unsurprisingly the modern day documents are certainly a lot more complex and prescriptive, but a lot of it was familiar. The SHT was project financed by bonds and loans that matched the full term of the PPP concession, with the final instalments of debt only being repaid in recent weeks, as scheduled all the way back in 1987. Its project financing was also underpinned by a guaranteed minimum revenue stream from the NSW Government, unlike the later toll roads that were subject to (and in many cases over-estimated) the risk of patronage use / demand - so, paradoxically given its location, it is one of the few early tollroads around town that did not go underwater.. ðŸ˜‰ #infrastructure #PPP #projectfinance #Allens"
