        "text": "COMMENTARY\n\nBy Prof Stewart Clegg and Prof Shankar Sankaran\n\nUniversity of Technology Sydney\n\nSydney, Australia\n\nThis article will bring to the attention of the public the different views on megaprojects that are currently being advanced in Australia. Major infrastructure projects, such as the Lane Cove Tunnel, Cross City Tunnel, M5, Sydney Light Rail, Sydney Metro, Westconnex, Second Sydney Harbour Tunnel and the Inland Rail, have all been criticized for excessive spending.\n\nWhile the public can see many infrastructure projects being built and delivered and some that do provide benefits, regular news headlines about cost blowouts, delays and benefits’ shortfalls, all cloud the picture. Who is reaping the benefits? Businesses like Transurban, that receive an escalating toll revenue, or motorists like you, paying these tolls? When the benefits do not meet the expectations of the contractor, the contactor can declare the project bankrupt, with the state government ultimately bearing the losses. Each time a road is built a user pays a toll that adds to the cost of living. New roads are touted as a convenience by their promoters, which they certainly are for those that can afford them, at least in the short term. In the long term, new roads are well-known to concentrate and attract traffic that slows down the flow that they were built to improve. Increased traffic in the short-term also accrues to non-toll alternative routes. Those who pay, those that live furthest from central city areas, are a demographic not readily able to defray additional costs as they are mortgagees whose choice of residence is dictated by housing availability and affordability. Given these caveats, many people cannot understand how selling off state-owned assets to fund major projects has provided better value. Rather, they have resulted in additional costs that they have to bear.\n\nIt is not only state government megaprojects that are problematic. A recent national example presents itself, which is discussed in the independent report of Dr. Kerry Schott[1] on the Inland Rail project. In just a two-year period the cost has doubled to 30 million dollars from initial estimates as well as the completion date being extended by four years. According to the report, the reasons for the cost increase are “mainly an increase in scope caused by immature preliminary designs and approval requirements, delays due to the prolonged approval processes, and recent escalations”. In addition, the project commenced without knowing where it will either start or finish. Schott’s report held the Australian Rail Track Corporation responsible as the project owner, in large part because it lacked the project management skills necessary for project delivery. There were governance issues as well. The minister responsible for its establishment, as well as its chief promoter, Barnaby Joyce, did not appoint an appropriate CEO, according to Dr. Schott. The Inland Rail Board was composed of Coalition ministerial appointments in which skill and experience were not uppermost. The recommendation to the Federal government is that a subsidiary company be established for the sole task of delivering the project.\n\nMore…\n\nTo read entire article, click here\n\nHow to cite this work: Clegg, S., Sankaran, S.
