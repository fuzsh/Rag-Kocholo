        "text": "From the north west, metro rail is being extended under Sydney Harbour, through new underground city stations and beyond to the south west including 15.5 kilometre metro twin tunnels.\n\nSydney Metro will deliver new stations at Crows Nest, Victoria Cross, Barangaroo, Martin Place, Pitt Street and Waterloo, along with new underground platforms at Central Station.\n\nOur acoustic materials, specifically designed and engineered for rail tracks and tunnels, are part of the Sydney Metro City and Southwest project.\n\nPyrotek is supplying materials complaint to the acoustic specifications, to provide adequate noise reduction, improving safety for drivers, passengers and those neighbouring.\n\nDecidamp RTD is an Australian made, high-performance polymer composite which is installed to the rail tracks to help absorbs vibrations, reducing metal fatigue. The dampers are designed to effectively reduce rail-radiated noise generated during contact between the track and railway rolling stock wheels.\n\nViterolite 900 is a non‐combustible, concrete‐like material with high impact resistance and a broad range of frequency absorption to address the project’s difficult criteria. Viterolite 900 is cast into large tiles, custom designed to fit in between tracks.\n\nReapor provides an exceptionally high NRC of 0.95 and specified to be affixed to the tunnel lower walls. With high acoustic performance, it’s complimented by the fact it is made from recycled glass and is deemed non-combustible.\n\nIn 2024, Sydney will have 31 metro railway stations and a 66-kilometre stand-alone metro railway system, revolutionising the way Sydney siders travels."
