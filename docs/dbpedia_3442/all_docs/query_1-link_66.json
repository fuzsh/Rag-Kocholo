Public-private partnerships (PPPs) involve contracts between public sector authorities and private parties, where the private party provides a public service or project. The private party assumes substantial financial, technical, and operational risk. PPPs can involve designing, building, financing, maintaining, and operating projects like hospitals, roads, bridges, etc. Typically, a special purpose vehicle company is formed to develop and operate the asset for the contracted period. PPPs aim to take advantage of private sector expertise and efficiency while maintaining public accountability.",
