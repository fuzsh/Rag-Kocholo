        "text": "Supporting Sydney’s Transport Transformation: The Reinforced Earth Company Australia is honoured to have played a pivotal role in the transformative Rozelle Interchange project.\n\nFor the recently completed WestConnex Rozelle Interchange, NSW, project, we supplied various Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) wall structures, including TerraPlus®, TerraTilt® and TerraTrel®, alongside our TechSpan® bridge arches. We also supplied a range of precast items.\n\nThis massive project achievement marks a significant milestone in Sydney’s transportation landscape. It underscores Reinforced Earth’s commitment to delivering innovative solutions that shape the future of infrastructure. The WestConnex Rozelle Interchange is a major project that links the M4 to the Anzac Bridge and the M8 to the City West Link and Victoria Road, and boasts more than 24 kilometres of interwoven and overlapping tunnels.\n\nPrecast Concrete Infrastructure Solutions\n\nContributing to the development of the Interchange’s M4 section, Reinforced Earth supplied;\n\nfive MSE walls\n\ntwo TechSpan arch tunnels\n\nmore than 100 precast road and bridge barriers\n\ntwo wire walls and;\n\ntwo precast bridge headstocks\n\nThe WestConnex M4 links the M4 at Parramatta to the west, and Wattle Street and Parramatta Road at Haberfield to the east. The WestConnex M4 also connects to the M4-M5 Link Tunnels and Rozelle Interchange. The project is an example of engineering excellence, enhancing connectivity and reducing travel time for motorists. This is particularly prominent during morning peak hours and on trips between Parramatta and the Sydney CBD.\n\nLed by Transport for NSW, the WestConnex Rozelle Interchange opened to traffic on 26 November 2023. It stands as a testament to collaboration, innovation and dedication to improving the lives of commuters across Sydney.\n\nWe’re immensely proud to have contributed to this landmark project. As we celebrate 50 years in Australia in 2024, we look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of engineering and innovation in future endeavours."
