        "text": "ACCIONA has been awarded the contract to design and build Stage 2 of Sydney’s Western Harbour Tunnel.\n\nThe project design for this iconic third road tunnel in Sydney Harbour is an outcome driven by industry innovation and NSW Government collaboration.\n\nACCIONA explored an alternative design using tunnelling under the harbour floor with a Tunnel-Boring Machine (TBM), thereby avoiding the need to dredge. Working with Transport for NSW and the NSW Government, ACCIONA improved the design and developed a solution that delivers a reduced impact on the environment. It also significantly minimises the impact on recreational and commercial harbour users as well as marine biodiversity.\n\nBede Noonan, ACCIONA’s Chief Executive Officer for the Infrastructure business in Australia and New Zealand, said it was an honour for ACCIONA to be awarded such an iconic project that will be recognised for its significance in engineering and design on a global scale and, most importantly, for the positive impact it will have on the community and environment.\n\n“I am extremely proud of the ACCIONA team for being bold and presenting a creative solution that focused on the community and environmental impact of a project at this scale.\n\n“We would like to acknowledge the work carried out by Transport for NSW and thank them for the support and trust throughout the development of this alternative solution. We look forward to working with all parties over the coming years to successfully deliver this world-class project,” Mr Noonan said.\n\nNSW Minister for Metropolitan Roads Natalie Ward said, “We know our population is growing and this is how we make sure our infrastructure keeps pace, supporting a strong economy and a brighter future for everyone in NSW, not just those who use this tunnel.”\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel will sit alongside other engineering feats in ACCIONA’s national portfolio, including the Sydney Opera House, Anzac Bridge and WestConnex M4-M5 Link Tunnels, as well as its international portfolio including the Follo Line project in Norway and the Cebu Bridge in the Philippines.\n\nMr Noonan concluded, “With a rich Australian history and a global company’s expertise, ACCIONA has the knowledge and experience to deliver projects that are distinctive for their innovation, environmental sustainability, and social purpose. We aim to lead the transition to a low-carbon economy through technical excellence in all our projects, including the Western Harbour Tunnel.”\n\nThe contract is valued at an estimated AU$4.24 billion (€2.76B). Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2023 and will take about 5 years."
