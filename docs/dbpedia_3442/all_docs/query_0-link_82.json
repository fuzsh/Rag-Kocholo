But whether the project is on track to deliver the benefits forecast in the business case remains a mystery.\n\nRead More\n\nOwen Hayford Owen Hayford\n\nStanford University’s Carter Casady on the performance of Public Private Partnerships\n\nSummary of interview with Stanford University’s Carter Cassidy on the findings of his academic research into the performance of PPPs around the globe.\n\nRead More\n\nOwen Hayford Owen Hayford\n\nPublic private partnerships to ease the burden\n\nOwen Hayford was interviewed by The Australian Financial Review for this feature article on PPPs\n\nRead More\n\nOwen Hayford Owen Hayford\n\nThe state of Australia’s PPP market\n\nInfralegal was recently asked to share its insights on the state of the Australian PPP market with an international project finance publication. Here is an edited version of our responses to their questions.\n\nRead More\n\nOwen Hayford Owen Hayford\n\nPPP 2.0 - Towards Greater Collaboration\n\nThis paper and presentation consider the reasons why government interest in PPPs is waning and what governments and equity investors can do the reinvigorate the use of private capital to deliver public infrastructure.

Under Australian law, a partnership arises when two or more people agree to carry on a business in common, with a view to profit. Each partner shares in the risks and rewards of the business, is entitled to a share of the net profits of the business, and is jointly and severally liable for the liabilities and obligations of the business. Australian PPPs don’t actually embody any of these key features of a true partnership.\n\nRead More\n\nOwen Hayford Owen Hayford\n\nRevitalisation of Central Station using the Developer Partner Model\n\nSydney’s Central Precinct Renewal project provides the NSW Government with an opportunity to develop Public Private Partnership (PPP) structures that are more akin to true partnerships involving the sharing, rather than allocation, of risks and rewards. Partnerships that would enable the NSW Government to not only harness the expertise of the private sector in the development of business opportunities associated with these projects, but also share in the rewards associated with them.\n\nRead More\n\nOwen Hayford Owen Hayford\n\nThe Alliance PPP delivery model\n\nCan a privately finance PPP be combined with an alliance style risk allocation?\n\nRead More"
