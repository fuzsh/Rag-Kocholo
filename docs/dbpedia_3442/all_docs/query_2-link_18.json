        "text": "As Sydney continues to grow, with more and more trips being made, so will the challenges to our transport network. Western Harbour Tunnel is key to delivering the transport vision for Sydney. It will change the way people move around Sydney and how people travel between the North Shore, the central business district (CBD) and Western and Southern Sydney.\n\nWith the Western Harbour Tunnel, people will spend less time in traffic and have more time for themselves and their families. The Western Harbour Tunnel project includes over six kilometres of mainline tunnels as well as upgrades to over nine kilometres of surface roads. Largely underground, the Western Harbour Tunnel has been designed to have minimal impacts on communities and to minimise property needs.\n\nVICTOREM was engaged by enlisting specialist Ranbury and Slattery to support with the pre-tender estimate for the project.\n\nWorking closely with the TfNSW, Ranbury and Slattery, our team held a number of risks workshops to understand the threats and opportunities to the project. This information, along with the estimate was to support the provision of the Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA).\n\nOur team successfully achieved this key task within the desired timeframes, allowing TfNSW to move forward fully understanding the risks for the project and the contingency provisions required for successful delivery of the project."
