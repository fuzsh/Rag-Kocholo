        "text": "Australian governments are amongst the leading advocates of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) as a public procurement policy. After two decades of experience, it is timely to evaluate the effectiveness of the policy. At the aggregate level, PPPs were launched to induce private participation in public infrastructures to covertly contrive the removal of visible public debt. Drawing from the social dynamic framework of interests (Broadbent & Laughlin, 2002), this paper shows that PPPs are a powerful procurement device to legitimise the social existence of the state. This article explores the experience of the first hospital (the Port Macquarie Base Hospital) and a recent toll road (the Cross City Tunnel) delivered under the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) model in the State of New South Wales, Australia. The study shows that the policy has effectively established the market of PPPs in a variety of sectors. Lessons to be learnt from this paper include the need for policy makers to b...\n\nAbstract: Contemporary policy discourse as regards privatization deals, public-private partnerships (PPP), and similar contractual arrangements irrespective at what stage it may find governments, be it ‘fresh from the crib’ as one local economist might say, or a ‘maturing economy’ as another might perorate has to take into account the consequences that are set into motion by a supposedly well- thought out contract or concession forged between the public sector and the private sector. The mistakes committed in such joint infrastructure contracts find themselves at the intersection of social, economic, and political influences. Precisely, to approach the pitfalls of infrastructure contracts, at both local and national plains, this paper aims to formulate the Seven Deadly Sins of public-private partnership as pivot in negotiating or renegotiating contracts and the concomitant assumption that specifically, public sector decision making ought to proceed around the idea or paradigm called present value of revenue (PVR) as a matter of policy strategy given that it suitably prescribes across economies. Both ideologically and methodologically injected into government thinking, future infrastructure contracts and partnerships would then avoid the inherent problems in such antinomies as regulation or un-regulation, negotiation or renegotiation, and the like. In sum, the paper advocates against courts, not just setting new scales, weights, or parameters away from the true policy metric but effectively articulating public ideas best reposed to the vast, interdisciplinary field of public administration, theory and practice, as have been the case when major public-private partnerships are viewed from the inappropriate lenses of justices or judges."
