        "text": "Congratulations to the following three teams who were recognised at the Transport Awards recently, for delivering meaningful work. ❤️👷 Our ‘People at the Heart’ Award was won by our “Careers on Track” team (Finance and Investment Division, Greater Sydney, NSW TrainLink, People and Culture, Sydney Trains). This program provides essential guidance on navigating the complexities of career development and fosters a nurturing environment where employees are encouraged to explore new professional avenues, broaden career horizons and enhance skillsets. The program aligns with Transport’s ’Five Ways of Leading’, offering volunteer Career Coaches a unique platform to hone their leadership skills. 👷 🚧 Congratulations also to the Sydney Trains’ Major Works – Linden Derailment Recovery Team in the ‘Recovery & resilience’ category. They were recognised for their hard work in repairing rail and concrete sleepers, signalling equipment, and electrical assets after a derailment. The freight train caused damage to 10 kilometres of railway track and infrastructure between Linden and Lawson in the Blue Mountains. The team worked around the clock to balance access for passengers and freight customers, while managing many obstacles. The track was handed back just 35 days after the incident. 🚂👷 ‘Excellence in Service Delivery’ was awarded to Kangy Angy Maintenance Facility Soft Plastics Initiative (Infrastructure and Place). The Maintenance Facility at Kangy Angy is a purpose-built train maintenance facility that services and maintains the new Mariyung fleet. The fleet will provide a new level of comfort and convenience for thousands of customers who travel between Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle, the Blue Mountains and the South Coast. As part of Transport for NSW’s commitment to supporting sustainable practices, our delivery partners implemented a dedicated soft plastics recycling program during construction to produce Reconophalt. The program was recognised by the Infrastructure Sustainability Council (ISC) as a ‘World First’ innovation. Congratulations to all our winners and finalists, who go above and beyond to deliver for our people and communities! 👏👏👏 #Recognition #TransportForNSW #2024TransportAwards #Innovation\n\nThis week marks the 19th annual National Rail Safety Week. Transport for NSW, along with the TrackSAFE Foundation hosted a Moment of Reflection at the National Rail Monument & Museum at Werris Creek. Yesterday’s launch saw rail workers, family members, industry partners, and local and federal representatives come together with the Werris Creek community to pay tribute to rail workers and members of the public who tragically lost their lives on the railways. With more than 4,500 names inscribed on the wall of remembrance, Werris Creek stands as a sobering reminder of the need to come together and commit to building a strong safety culture. Each life lost on our railways represents a profound tragedy, affecting families, rail workers, responders and communities. Rail Safety Week is a timely reminder of the importance of prioritising a strong safety culture. NSW TrainLink #RailSafetyWeek #Safety #TransportForNSW\n\nMarma Box Creek Road is the ‘gateway’ to Mungo National Park, home to the world’s oldest human remains and a site of sacred significance to the local Aboriginal people. It’s also an integral freight route for the area’s mining interests and local farms. 💰 🚗 🚛 Through its Fixing Local Roads Program, Transport for NSW invested $2.65 million in improving the road’s surface, with an additional $700,000 from the Balranald Shire Council. This enhances safety, supports economic benefits, and boosts employment opportunities for nearby communities. Tanya Charles (pictured) is a proud Mutthi Mutthi woman who works as a Discovery Ranger and Coordinator at Mungo National Park. “The work on the road has been great for me because I drive 300 kilometres up and down every week. I’m so glad they tarred it. Sometimes it could take me three hours just to get off the dirt to a paved surface and in wet weather I was once bogged and waiting 24 hours for help.” Ms Charles said, adding that she felt very lucky to drive to work each day through such a stunning location. “This is an amazing landscape to drive through and it is a very, very ancient place. This place is where my story, and the story of my people, is told.” #TransportForNSW #FixingLocalRoadsProgram #MungoNationalPark #Investment\n\nThe draft Western Harbour Tunnel Place, Design and Landscape Plan (PDLP) is now on public display until midnight 28 August 2024. Western Harbour Tunnel will be a 6.5 kilometre road tunnel with three lanes in each direction. It will connect the Rozelle Interchange to the Warringah Freeway near North Sydney, crossing underneath Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Waverton. The Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Upgrade (WHTWFU) project will make it easier, faster and safer to get around Sydney. Our vision is to contribute to the community, giving back in meaningful ways through new open spaces and landmark features that acknowledge the Country they were built on. The Western Harbour Tunnel PDLP will be presented in three parts, with each part including its own key objectives and consultation period. We are asking for community feedback now on part 1 of the WHT PDLP. We want your feedback on a range of design elements including: • landscaping • tunnel interiors • tunnel portals • Cammeray facilities. All feedback received during the public display period will be considered and will help validate the final design decisions for the PDLP. To Have Your Say, please visit the PDLP on our project website at https://lnkd.in/gcjSDQ-D or by emailing the project directly at whtbl@transport.nsw.gov.au. You can also provide your feedback in person by visiting our Community Information Centre located at Level 9, 60 Miller Street, North Sydney 2060. Drop in anytime Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm or make an appointment by emailing us. #Infrastructure #SaferRoads #SydneyRoads #HaveYourSay #TransportForNSW\n\nTransport empowers every person to come to work and feel they belong, which builds stronger connections with our customers, and a happier and more productive workplace.

With an in-depth understanding of lone worker risks, Brad proactively seeks ways to mitigates these risks, ensuring they return home safely each day. He leads safety and process improvements, emphasising both physical and psychological safety. 🏆🤝 Our ‘Everyday hero for our people’ is Antriksh Raje (People and Culture), recognised for his dedication in implementing our inclusion and diversity strategy. Ant ran a series of Acknowledgement of Country training sessions across all branches at Transport, helping employees deliver genuine and respectful acknowledgements.

But our very own Customer Service Attendant (CSA), Peter Boukouvalas, from St Peters Station, is heading to Paris for his first Olympic Games! 🏹🇦🇺 Peter, one of 460 athletes in the Australian team, will compete in archery at the Esplanade des Invalides on July 25th and from July 28th to August 4th.
