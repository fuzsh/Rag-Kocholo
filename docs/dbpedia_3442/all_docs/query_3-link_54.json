        "text": "Sydney Metro is Australia's biggest public transport project. Stage 2 of the project will extend metro rail from the city's northwest under Sydney Harbour, through new stations in the CBD and southwest to Bankstown. Sydney Metro has two core components: - Sydney Metro Northwest -now under construction and to open in the first half of 2019 - Sydney Metro City and Southwest a new twin 12.5-km tunnel linking with Sydney Metro Northwest at Chatswood - then under Sydney Harbour, through the CBD to Sydenham and continuing 13. 4 km along the existing line to Bankstown due for completion in 2024. A joint venture between Parsons Brinckerhoff and AECOM (PB-AECOM JV) was appointed as the consultant for the Sydney Metro Technical Services project, which commenced in September 2014. The team will prepare a preliminary evaluation, scoping design, definition design and ultimately reference designs for the Sydney Metro Stage 2. In November 2014 the marine geophysics contract was awarded to Earth Technology Solutions Pty Ltd and the intrusive investigation followed in April 2015 by the Golders-Douglas Partners joint venture. As Sydney Harbour is a key element of Sydney Metro, early planning and design work included essential geotechnical investigations. Sydney Harbour is a busy waterway, so the investigation works began, after extensive consultation with all relevant harbour authorities, with standard marine geophysical surveys (reflection, 1 refraction, 1 magnetics and sonar) west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Land-based investigation began in April 2015 following extensive community consultation and services searches. The firstnole (BH015) began at Blues Point with a commissioning ceremony by the NSW Premier Mike Baird. This was the start of 27 boreholes that extend from Chatswood to Sydenham. These boreholes have been planned to target and intersect the Ashfield Shale, Mittagong Formation and Hawkesbury Sandstone to assess the rocks geomechanical properties.\n\nThis paper examines techniques used in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel Asset Protection program designed to ensure the tunnel&#39;s long-term serviceability. A comprehensive maintenance program was put into place shortly after the completion of construction. State-of-the-art techniques are being employed and developed for investigations and condition monitoring. A new analytical approach has been developed for more appropriate interpretation of half-cell potential test results instead of merely relying on the criteria contained in ASTM C876. Another technique, the injection of micro-cement grouts into concrete cracks, is currently being investigated for corrosion control. Laboratory research is also being undertaken to study the influence of cracks on the corrosion of steel reinforcement in submerged marine structures. The cooperative effort of the consulting and maintenance teams combined with the use and development of advanced techniques in an ongoing maintenance program has played an ...\n\nThe importance of the main geotechnical parameters affecting the results of two-dimensional plain strain tunnel analysis with the finite element method is presented. The effects on the surface settlement predictions of the strength and deformation parameters, the initial coefficient of earth pressure at rest, and the assumed relaxation factor of the rock mass before the application of the temporary support are examined for a typical configuration of the Athens metro tunnel. Settlements measured in the center of Athens are presented and combinations of parameters giving reasonable predictions are examined. The limitations and capabilities of back analysis are discussed."
