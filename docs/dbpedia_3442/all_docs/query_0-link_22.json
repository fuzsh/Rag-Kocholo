What is happening to Australia’s infrastructure investment? 3\n\n4. Public Investment share is falling as the private sector assumes a greater role 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% Sep-1959 Sep-1961 Sep-1963 Sep-1965 Sep-1967 Sep-1969 Sep-1971 Sep-1973 Sep-1975 Sep-1977 Sep-1979 Sep-1981 Sep-1983 Sep-1985 Sep-1987 Sep-1989 Sep-1991 Sep-1993 Sep-1995 Sep-1997 Sep-1999 Sep-2001 Sep-2003 Sep-2005 Sep-2007 Sep-2009 Sep-2011 Public Investment as a share of Total Investment, 1959-2013% Peak 35.5% in June 1975 Low 16.5% in March 1998 16.6% in Sept & Dec 2007 Greiner/Fahey (1988-1996); Goss (1989-1996) Kennett (1992-1999) - corporatisation and privatisation models - significant fiscal consolidation in Victoria and NSW - strong fiscal rules in Queensland Heavy Government Borrowing \"Nation Building\" , particularly Qld and C/W Peak 23% in March 2010 4\n\n5. - 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 - 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 $ billion (2013) $ billion (2013)Total Annual Public and Private Investment, (Constant $2013) Total Annual Public Investment ($2013) Total Annual Private Investment ($2013) 5 Private investment is now four times larger than public investment\n\n6. Public investment trends have reflected policy & governance reforms & asset renewal cycles $500 $550 $600 $650 $700 $750 $800 $850 $900 $950 $1,000 $1,050 $1,100 $500 $550 $600 $650 $700 $750 $800 $850 $900 $950 $1,000 $1,050 $1,100 $ Real Annual Total Public Investment per capita, 1983-2013 ($2013) Public Ownership Corporatisation Privatisation \"Nation Building\" $ rebuild electricity & water assets GFC 6\n\n7. Transport and Utilities investment is growing strongly $- $2,000 $4,000 $6,000 $8,000 $10,000 $12,000 $14,000 $16,000 $18,000 $- $2,000 $4,000 $6,000 $8,000 $10,000 $12,000 $14,000 $16,000 $18,000 Transport Electricity,Gas & Water $ $Capital Stock per Capita, selected capital-intensive service industries (Real $2013) The growth in both the Transport and Utilities capital stock ,in per capita terms, is well above trend. This suggests either a cyclical 'catch-up' or some poor incentives leading to overbuilding. 7\n\n8. Why has Australia been an early innovator with PPPs? 8\n\n9. • What Government can do: • Leverage their asset situation • Mix the established cash flows of old assets • Give private sector an obligation to replenish and build new infrastructure • Positively change the attractiveness of infrastructure investment • Brings on new projects, in shorter period of time Attracting Investment\n\n10. Four key elements define infrastructure investment opportunity type: 1. Project or Enterprise – economic/ social 2. Contractual approach – privatisation/ license/ concession/ partnership 3. Phase of asset development – existing & established/ new & tested/ new & innovative 4. Stage of development of the market – Undeveloped/ developing/ developed Source: World Economic Forum, Maximizing the Value of Private Finance in Infrastructure, 2010 Investment Opportunity Types\n\n11. • Whole of life (design, construct, operate) • Assigning risk to parties best capable of managing it. • Creation of an asset for public through private sector financing, and risk transference. • Contribution by the government through planning, capital works, capital contribution etc. What is a PPP?\n\n12. • No definite rule; Case by case basis. • PPPs are the natural choice for large, complex and high profile infrastructure projects. • Compared to traditional projects, PPPs deliver value-for- money to the state for complex projects in terms of cost and time savings. When to use PPP’s\n\n13. 13Source: Deloitte “Closing the Infrastructure Gap: The role of Public-Private Partnerships”\n\n14. 54 projects chosen from 206 identified • 21 were PPPs • 33 traditional projects Distribution of Selected Projects for the Study Project Sample Pool\n\n15. The study examined the project management and construction phases of infrastructure programs. Procurement efficiency is defined in terms of time and cost dimensions. Normalised cost – percentage change in cost incurred at next milestone in a stage compared with cost anticipated at beginning of stage. A cost overrun (over budget) expressed as +ve percentage Normalised time – percentage change in the time taken to achieve the next milestone in a stage compared with the timing anticipated at the beginning of that stage. A time overrun is expressed as a +ve percentage Project Stages FULL PERIOD Original approval Final budget Contractual commitment Actual final $ TIME (MILESTONES) STAGE 1 STAGE 2 STAGE 3 Efficiency Measures\n\n16. Full Period Stage 1 less outlier Stage 2 Stage 3 No. Obs. 35 22 21 36 37 Traditional 44.7% 62.1% 24.7% 24.6% 13.8% PPP 13.9% 11.5% 11.5% 3.0% 2.4% Difference 30.8% 50.6% 13.2% 21.6% 11.4% Confidence 96% 89.6% 87% 96% 99% Finding 1: PPPs demonstrate superior cost efficiency over traditional projects. • Ranging from 30.8% (from project inception) to 11.4 (from contractual commitment to final outcome) Key Findings\n\n17. Finding 1a: In absolute terms, the PPP cost advantage was economically and statistically significant • On a contracted $4.9 billion of PPP projects, the net cost over-run was $ 58 million • For $4.5 billion of Traditional procurement projects, the net cost over-run was $673 million Key Findings\n\n18. Finding 2: With respect to time over-runs on a value-weighted basis PPPs fared considerably better than traditionally procured projects • Between signing of the contract and project completion PPPs were completed 3.4% ahead of time on average • On an average Traditional projects were completed 23.5% behind time Key Findings\n\n19. Finding 3: • Approximately $400 billion is likely to be spent on Australian infrastructure over the next decade • If PPPs account for 10-15% share of this, PPPs would generate approximately $6 billion in potential benefit to the community on a conservative basis Key Findings\n\n20. Finding 4: • Project size and complexity has a marked (statistically significant) negative impact on time over-runs of Traditional projects • In contrast timeliness of completion of PPP projects were not negatively impacted by size and complexity of the project Key Findings\n\n21. Finding 5: In contrast to commonly held perceptions, PPP projects were far more transparent by Traditional projects, as measured by the availability of public data for the study Key Findings\n\n22. • There is a benefit from completing projects on time and enabling the community to have access to infrastructure facilities sooner. This study has not quantified this benefit. • The benefits identified in this study do not include the effect of PPP’s integrated provision of management, construction and on-going operations. Underestimation of Benefits\n\n23. What can be done about Australia’s Infrastructure Conundrum 23\n\n24. • Reality is that the government got exactly what it asked for – ‘an excellent outcome ?’ • Questions concerning ‘value for money’ persist, not from the viewpoint of government but the public – Urban amenity - always a significant element of CCT – Rich in externalities (third party free riders) – Point to point charging mechanism (is this the optimal revenue model) – If reducing CBD traffic congestion was a goal, then why not reward this as an outcome if it is achieved by the proponent. CCT – Policy Malfunction or not?\n\n25. • A fully electronic, distance-based toll road; one of the largest road projects in Australia • Completed and opened to traffic ahead of schedule and within budget • Contractual clarity; high degree of commitment on behalf of both parties-public and private; efficient contract management • Significant benefits to the community – good ‘value for money’ • Received wide spread acclaim and hailed as one of the best ever PPP projects in Australia Westlink – M7 Sydney\n\n26. • Enhances efficiency via: • Connecting market agents • Information broker • Liquidity enables better information discovery • Lowers transaction costs Case Study: Cross City Tunnel\n\n27. • A great hole in the ground or something much more? • Public Value equates with: – Better functioning city – Enhanced urban amenity – Less traffic on deck of CBD (travel time, air quality etc) – Greater traffic throughput (if choose tunnel) • Private Value – Time value of money versus toll (customers) – Greater choice ? – Traffic volumes (NPV of future revenue streams) Case Study: Cross City Tunnel\n\n28. • Forecasting costs & revenue over long term is difficult • NSW Govt led procurement • Primary objective: reduce through traffic for CBD • Resulting in: less congestion, improved amenity, better flows • 2.1Km long tunnel Sydney, Australia • Public-private partnership: design, build, finance, operate • Charge users a toll • Opened for traffic August 2005 • Never reached the levels forecast • December 2006, company insolvent, debts +$500 million Case Study: Cross City Tunnel\n\n29. • Lessons learned • Develop realistic & accurate forecasts • Assessment of project bids should include identification of key assumptions • Need to develop better and more flexible pricing models for PPPs • Need for greater transparency in PPP contracts • Need for governments to pursue PPP projects that are profitable plus protect and improve the public interest Case Study: Cross City Tunnel\n\n30. • How do you expand the port when the Govt. budget tight? • Sell the asset on a 99 year lease • couple the sale with an obligation to fund and build a new major road to the port • $2.1 billion to Government • plus the consortium will pay $200 million for the roadway upgrade • taxpayer also avoids future port infrastructure expansion costs of up to $1 billion. How do you expand the port when Govt. budget is tight? Case Study: Brisbane Airport\n\n31. Case Study: Brisbane Airport • How do you expand the port when the Govt. budget tight? • Sell the asset on a 99 year lease • Couple the sale with an obligation to fund and build a new major road to the port • $2.1 billion to Government • Consortium will pay $200 million for roadway upgrade • Taxpayer avoids future port infrastructure expansion costs of up to $1 billion.\n\n32.  The NSW Auditor General’s Office and NSW Treasury have also provided guidance, most recently in the reviews of the PPP for new government schools in western Sydney. Their reports endorsed the State’s decision to use private finance, finding that: o the nine schools were delivered two years earlier than if traditional public sector procurement was used; o innovation was advanced, like child care centres and on-site maintenance managers; and o the savings using PPP delivery were retained by the Education Department, with $7m of capital savings used for other school projects. New South Wales’ Experience\n\n33. • Onus is on private sector to demonstrate it can build and operate infrastructure (toll roads) better. – Faster delivery – Innovative design and ongoing management – Better service, smarter ways of doing it – It is not just about saving the government money – third order issue • Willingness to learn & improve – Admit mistakes – Prepared to acknowledge and front the community and share the political risk both upside and downside – Profit is a great motivator, but also innovation must be demonstrable and result in better service delivery – Celebrate and communicate the successes Even higher hurdle for proponents"
