In 1912, John Bradfield, a civil engineer, proposed the idea of building a bridge to allow transportation in order “to connect the people who lived on both sides of the Sydney Harbour”. (Khan, 2022). The plan was accepted and he was appointed as the Chief Engineer of Sydney Harbour Bridge the year after, however, the project was delayed for several years due to World War 1. Initially, Bradfield’s proposition of a cantilever bridge was accepted, but an arch bridge was ultimately chosen because “it was less expensive than a cantilever design and capable of handling heavier loads”. (Britannica, n.). The project officially began in 1923 under Bradfield’s supervision, with the first work on the bridge being the construction of the approaches and abutment towers. The bridge was originally designed in a way to accommodate six lanes for road traffic, four for railroad and two for pedestrian. In February 1932, tests were conducted to determine the safety and strength of the bridge by loading 96 locomotives on the rail tracks. Three weeks later, the bridge was announced to be safe for traffic and officially celebrated its opening on the 19th March 1932.\n\n3. PROPERTIES OF THE STRUCTURE\n\nFig 2: Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction, 1930. [Photograph]. National Museum Australia. nma.gov/defining-moments/resources/sydney-harbour-bridge-opens\n\n3 Bridge type &amp; Materials\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel through arch bridge, also known as a half-through bridge or a through-type arch bridge. This is a type of bridge in which the arch’s base is below the deck and the deck crosses through the arch, suspended from it via tension rods and cables.\n\nThe main materials implemented in the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge include prefabricated steel, reinforced concrete, and granite. By the arrival of the twentieth century, advancements in bridge engineering technology and developments in the local manufacture of steel and concrete made it practical for the bridge to be built.\n\nThe bridge was decided to be constructed out of steel because, apart from its cost effectiveness, the material was “durable and malleable enough to span wide tidal bodies of water” (Ellmoos &amp; Murray, 2016) due to its flexibility and strength. Border Watch (1928) mention that “steel, man’s masterpiece, [is] the strongest and most reliable material yet manufactured by him”. The Australian Workers’ Union (2021) suggest that approximately 20% of the steel used in the construction was produced in Australia, while the remainder was sourced from overseas.\n\nAnother important material implemented was concrete, which was used to build the abutment towers of the main arch and the piers of the approach span. Concrete is a popular material in majority of modern bridge constructions because of its desired engineering properties, which include strength, durability, energy efficiency and low cost. Cairns (2019) state that the material is a worthwhile investment as it requires minimal maintenance and resists any process of deterioration, such as weathering and erosion. The concrete used for the Sydney Harbour Bridge was made from a mixture of crushed granite quarried at Moruya, sand from the Nepean River, and cement.\n\n3 Dimensions\n\n3\n\nFig 3: Table of the materials and the total amount used in the construction of The Sydney Harbour Bridge\n\n Shipping clearance:\n\n49m\n\n Height of pylons:\n\n Total length:\n\n1,149 m (including approach spans)\n\n Length of arch span:\n\nMaterial Total Amount\n\nSteel 52,800 t\n\nGranite-faced concrete 95,000 m 3\n\nPaint 272,000 L\n\n5. LAYOUT OF ROADWAYS\n\nThe bridge currently has a total of 8 lanes, which consists of 6 lanes for traffic on the main roadway (Bradfield Highway) and two road traffic lanes. However, there were originally only 4 traffic lanes on Bradfield Highway, but two extra road lanes were later added to replace\n\nFig 4: The Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb. [Photograph]. Pickyourtrail. cntraveler/stories/2013-09-25/five-surprising-facts-about-the-sydney- harbor-bridge-climb\n\nFig 5: Repsher, K. The Sydney Harbour Bridge at night. [Photograph]. bootsandabackpack/the-sydney-harbour-bridge-at-night/\n\ntramways. The bridge also has a pedestrian pathway on the eastern side, and two railway tracks and a bicycle path on the western side.\n\nThe main roadway across the Sydney Harbour Bridge is called Bradfield Highway, named in honour of John Bradfield. The highway opened on 19th March 1932 and is one of the shortest highways in Australia, at approximately 2 kilometres in length. Wikimedia Foundation (2010) noted that The Bradfield Highway “begins at the end of the Western Distributor in the CBD, crosses the Sydney Harbour Bridge and ends at the Warringah Freeway in North Sydney (just North of the Pacific Highway intersection)”. Before Warringah Highway was constructed in 1986, all the traffic at the end of the Bradfield Highway was directed to and from the Pacific Highway. Today, the Bradfield Highway carries six lanes of traffic out of the 8 lanes on the Sydney Harbour Bridge; the other two lanes are used for the Cahill Expressway.\n\nThe Cahill Expressway was the first freeway built in Australia and officially opened to traffic in 1958. It was named after John Joseph Cahill, who was then the New South Wales Premier and also authorized the construction of the Sydney Opera House. The expressway allows travel between Sydney’s eastern and northern suburbs, by linking the Eastern Distributor to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Harbour Tunnel. It allows commute from the airport to the northern suburbs without any hindrance from traffic signals (Wikipedia, 2022). The Cahill Expressway also has a pedestrian walk near the traffic lanes that connects with the Sydney Harbour Bridge walkway. The pedestrian walk displays a scenic view of the bridge and the CBD, and is accessible by stairs from Macquarie St, or an elevator close to Circular Quay railway station.\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Tunnel is a twin-tube tunnel built under the Sydney Harbour, and its construction is regarded as one of the great engineering achievements of modern Australia. The purpose of the tunnel was to “provide a second vehicular crossing of Sydney Harbour to alleviate congestion on the Sydney Harbour Bridge” (Wikipedia, 2022) by up to 60, vehicles per day. The tunnel joins the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney, and the Cahill Expressway at the entrance to the Domain Tunnel, providing easy access between North Sydney and the CBD. It has a total of four lanes, two lanes in each direction, with a traffic capacity of 2,000 vehicles per hour.\n\nunderground tunnels on each embankment. After the two halves were connected together, the cables were removed as the bridge became strong enough to be able to support itself. Four cylindrical forged steel pins in the main bearings, one at each end of the two arches, support the bridge and prevent it from falling into the harbour. This allows movement in the arch and can cause the steel structure to rise by 18 centimetres in hot weather.\n\n6 Deck\n\nThere is a reinforced concrete roach deck placed underneath the arch that ties the two ends of the arch together, forming a tied arch. It is an integral structural element that carries tension or compression to support the span. The road deck is supported by tension members where the tension tie takes the horizontal thrust, therefore, leaving the foundations to only support the gravity loads on the bridge. The tied arch bridge involves a complex construction process, because the arch thrust is not resisted until the road deck is built, but the road deck is unsupported until the arch is created.\n\nThe Sydney Harbour bridge has a deck that is 1,149 metres long and 49 metres wide, currently carrying 8 lanes of traffic, two train lines, a footpath and a cycleway.\n\nFig 8: Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction between 4 July 1930 and 1 February 193.

They were designed by the Scottish architect Thomas S. Trait and were made near Moruya from concrete and granite.\n\nAn important aspect to the aesthetic of The Sydney Harbour Bridge are the two pairs of 89 m high granite-lined pylons, designed by Scottish architect Thomas S. Tait. The abutments at the base of the pylons support the weight of the arch and make the bridge more visually appealing. Even though the pylons were initially only included in the design to enhance the visual appeal and structural integrity of the bridge, they were, however, later put to use.\n\nAlthough initially added to the bridge entirely for aesthetic purposes, all four pylons are currently used for tourists. The south-eastern pylon contains a museum and tourist centre with a 360° lookout over the picturesque harbour. The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) employ the south-western pylon to assist its CCTV cameras that monitor the bridge and surrounding roads. Lastly, the two other pylons on the north shore include venting chimneys for fumes from the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.\n\nFig 9: the compression and tension forces acting in the bridge. [Diagram].

CONCLUSION ...................................................................\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel- arch bridge situated in Sydney, spanning Sydney Harbour from the CBD to the North shore (Wikipedia, 2022). It is one of the world’s most well-known landmarks and is a significant historical monument of Sydney. Under the direction of John Bradfield, the construction of the bridge started on 28th July 1923 and finished on 19th January 1932. The bridge officially opened on the 19th March 1932 with a grand celebration consisting of more than 750,000 people gathered around the harbour. The Sydney Harbour Bridge was originally designed in a way to fit six lanes for road traffic, four for railroad and two for pedestrian. However, today it carries a total of 8 lanes of traffic, two train lines, a footpath and a cycleway.\n\nFig 12: Table of the superstructure and substructure components of a bridge\n\nSuperstructure Substructure\n\nDeck Pier\n\nGirder Abutment\n\nTruss Foundations\n\nBearings Wing walls\n\nFig 13: Sydney Harbour Bridge Opening.
