        "text": "Sydney public transport\n\nTransport for NSW provides a variety of ways to get around the city, as well as information for motorists. Use the trip planner at transportnsw.info to plan your travel.\n\nOpal card info\n\nThe Opal card is an easy, convenient way of paying for your travel on public transport in Sydney. It can be used on all public transport, including trains, ferries, buses and light rail. There are daily and weekly caps on the Opal network, meaning you can travel as much as you like within the Opal network and you never pay more than the capped fare. The Sydney Airport station access fee isn’t included in the travel caps.\n\nOpal cards can be obtained from train stations and the domestic and international airport, as well as many retailers across the city. For more information, visit opal.com.au.\n\nYou can also pay with contactless-enabled American Express, Mastercard or Visa credit or debit cards or a linked device, by tapping on and tapping off at Opal readers. Contactless payments are available on all public transport in the Opal network and you will receive the same travel benefits of an Adult Opal card.\n\nSydney buses\n\nBuses form a key part of Sydney’s public transport system, connecting all areas of the city, including those without rail or water transport. There are also NightRide services replacing most train routes between midnight and 4:30am.\n\nKey bus routes include:\n\n333 – Connecting Circular Quay to Bondi\n\nB1 – Wynyard to Mona Vale\n\n373 – Connecting Museum to Coogee\n\n380 - Watsons Bay to Bondi Junction\n\nSydney rail\n\nSydney's main terminus for local and regional trains and buses is Central Station at Railway Square, close to Chinatown.
