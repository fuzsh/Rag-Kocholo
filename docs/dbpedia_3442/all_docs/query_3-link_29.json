        "text": "The Rozelle Interchange will complete an innovative motorway network linking several of Sydney's busiest commuter routes and is considered one of the most complex motorway projects ever undertaken in Australia.\n\nThe network comprises over 16 kilometres of driveable tunnels, four cut-and-cover tunnel portal structures, 12 bridges, and two ventilation facilities, all seamlessly integrated into the existing WestConnex network and future Western Harbour Tunnel.\n\nOur Fire Engineering team, led by Haydn Lewis, has worked on this project for the last six years, providing Fire Engineering services, including a detailed fire engineering study via deterministic assessments and risk analysis during the tender and design phases.\n\nKey elements worked through as part of this project related to the nest of merging and diverging carriageways and the resulting impacts on design for occupant egress, fire brigade intervention and smoke control.\n\nThe Rozelle Interchange project is expected to provide new travel options for residents of Sydney's Inner West and connect communities the city. The Rozelle Interchange has also repurposed a disused railyard site and been transformed into Rozelle Parklands which boasts almost 10 hectares of vibrant green space with fresh wetlands, walking and bike riding connections and recreational areas to be enjoyed by all.\n\nWe feel privileged to have been a part of the Rozelle Interchange project."
