Social infrastructure projects (schools, hospitals, prisons et al) are characterised as generally being smaller in scale than economic infrastructure projects (motorways, bridges, tunnels et al). However, by their very nature, social infrastructure projects also tend to be complex, particularly in terms of on-going involvement with the community. Thus, private sector bidders for social infrastructure PPPs are often presented with a situation where operational complexity, including government policy toward the sharing of revenue, is one of the key differences in whether PPPs are as attractive for social infrastructure compared with economic infrastructure.

Social infrastructure projects are generally smaller in scale than economic infrastructure projects, however, they tend to be more complex, mainly because of the on-going involvement with the community. Private sector tenderers for social infrastructure PPPs are often presented with a situation where operational complexity, including government policy towards risk allocation and the sharing of revenue, is a key difference in whether PPPs are as attractive for social infrastructure projects compared with economic ones. This paper focuses on the procurement selection process for healthcare infrastructure in Australia and the results are presented from a case study of a PPP hospital project in New South Wales.\n\nThe practice of implementing infrastructure projects through a public-private partnership (PPP) arrangement is widely employed around the world with successful outcomes. However, this practice is not without challenges related to cost, time and quality variations, which the public is forced to bear. This study aims to explore factors influencing the termination of the East West Link project in Melbourne and present time and cost variation challenges facing the Sydney Light Rail project. This paper utilizes literature, investigating the critical success factors (CSF) for PPP infrastructure projects in an international context, and other readily available data sources such as Australian government publications, the case projects’ reports, news articles, and websites as the sources of data. The data gathered from these sources was then analysed to understand the project challenges and to investigate the relationship between CSF and the challenges. Four challenges were identified, inclu...\n\nThe last two decades have seen the evolution of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) as an alternative procurement method to traditional methods of delivering public infrastructure. Gaining significant popularity in the UK during the 1990’s PPPs have gradually spread worldwide to become an accepted approach to infrastructure provision. In Australia, there would appear to be considerable growth potential for PPPs given that both the New South Wales and Victorian State Governments have recently developed policies to expand the application of PPPs to include social infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. This growth potential has lead to an ongoing debate on the nature of the bid requirements for social infrastructure PPPs, particularly in terms of the cost of bid preparation. This paper maps the historical development of PPPs in Australia and describes a recently commenced research project which is investigating current approaches to the identification and allocation of risks dur...\n\nThis paper makes three claims. First, in contrast to Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in many other industries, infrastructure contracts can be conditioned on the delivery of roads and railways of appropriate user quality. This eliminates one of the concerns in the literature of the welfare properties of PPPs. Second, the bundling of investment and maintenance into one single rather than several separate contracts may provide a way to bypass rigidities and contract incompleteness in PPP contracts. Third, having a private concessionaire organising the funding of a PPP project’s investment costs may increase financing costs. This is, however, balanced by the fact that it also enhances the agent’s commitment in long-term incomplete contracts. Taken together, these conclusions point to the possibility of using PPP as an instrument for improving the construction industry’s dismal productivity performance.\n\nThe last two decades have seen the evolution of PPPs as an alternative procurement method to traditional methods of delivering public infrastructure. Competing demands for public sector investment for new infrastructure has prompted Australian governments to increasingly turn to the private sector to form partnerships in the construction, ownership and operation of infrastructure assets. This has become a major challenge for both public and private sector stakeholders but the emergence of PPPs provides an alternate means for developing infrastructure using private sector expertise. There is considerable growth potential for PPPs given that the New South Wales Government has developed policies to expand the application of PPPs to include social infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Subsequently Local government has been investigating the delivery of infrastructure and services PPPs. A key argument for Governments to procure projects using PPPs is that the process would deliv..."
