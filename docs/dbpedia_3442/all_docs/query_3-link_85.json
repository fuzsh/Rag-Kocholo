        "text": "In this story we go back to the early 2000’s – life was simpler, yet remarkable engineering achievements were extremely prevalent. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel was one of those projects, an incredible structure with an impressively simple concept and clever design, it showed an array of beneficial results from the use of cement replacement methods. Take a read below.\n\nAMIDST the euphoria of the Olympics 2000 and its associated massive construction program, it’s easy to overlook some of the remarkable engineering achievements of the recent past such as the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.\n\nToday as we drive through, we tend not to think about this remarkable structure, but only watch our speedo with the certain knowledge of the speed cameras’ presence. However, the Tunnel proposal as recently as a decade ago was looked upon with much concern by some in the engineering fraternity. Although immersed tube concrete structures were relatively common in cities such as Hong Kong, this project was proposed for under our Sydney Harbour and somehow this was different.\n\nIt’s surprising that something that caused so much concern in the late 1980’s is now accepted so completely in the late 1990’s. It opened to traffic on 31 August 1992, a date that was set by the contractor Transfield-Kumagai Joint Venture well before the construction commencement date of January 1988.\n\nThe concept of the project was impressively simple. Tenders were called by the Government for a second vehicle crossing of the Harbour to and from North Sydney, which resulted in a variety of bridge designs, all of which had a common self-destructing component. That was because extensive resumptions of properties – most containing homes and commercial premises were required to provide road access on both sides of the harbour.\n\nThe Transfield-Kumagai proposal was an exquisite example of lateral thinking. It identified the bottleneck as the existing beloved Harbour Bridge with its eight traffic lanes. The constriction was created because there were twelve lanes on the North Shore and twelve lanes on the city side adjoining the bridge having to merge into eight.\n\nWe all know the hassles of the common road situation of two lanes leading into one – very few drivers are prepared to readily allow merging. The Transfield-Kumagai proposal simply offered the practical alternative of adding four more lanes to the bridge, which gave twelve uninterrupted vehicular access lanes from the city to the North Shore. The punch was that the lanes were not hung off the bridge as some had suggested but laid down beside it - but under water. Clever design meant that no resumption of properties was required which was a major positive factor in the tender evaluation process. This of course was only possible by using a precast tunnel across the floor of the harbour instead of the conventional bored tunnel which would have to be much deeper underground creating unacceptable grades to keep the new roadway within the existing publicly owned road system. Transfield-Kumagai had retained MacDonald Wagner (now Connell Wagner) to advise in structural design was in turn commissioned Freeman Fox (now Acer Consultants) to assist. The following extracts in italics are taken from a paper prepared jointly by Dr Lewis Gomes of Connell Wagner and Martin Morris of Acer Consultants.\n\nTheir paper was presented at a conference “Concrete for The Nineties” held in Leura, NSW 3-5 September 1990. The overwhelming concern facing the designers was that of durability with the then Department of Main Roads nominating that a minimum life span of 100 years was required of the structure. The problem of a submerged tube section is that it is subject to the “hollow leg” syndrome.\n\nSERVICEABILITY DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS DURABILITY\n\nThe chemical process of chloride and sulphate attack on the concrete matrix and the electro-chemical process of reinforcement corrosion has been well described by others (Eglington 1987). However, some aspects of durability are of particular relevance to immersed tube construction and are briefly reviewed below.\n\nIn a seawater environment, sulphate attack is diminished by the presence of chloride ions. This is because the expansive sulphoaluminate salts (ettringite) which result from sulphate attack on the tricalcium aluminate (C3A) content are more soluble in chloride solutions enabling them to be leached out prior to disruptive expansion.\n\nThe more serious concern is chloride penetration which neutralises the natural alkalinity of concrete and renders the reinforcement susceptible to corrosion, and subsequent spalling. The rate of chloride penetration is directly linked to the permeability of the concrete matrix\n\nso that durability requires a sound, dense mix. The presence of cracks accelerates the rate of penetration over local areas, and therefore crack control also forms an inherent part of designing for durability.\n\nReinforcement corrosion is dependent on oxygen supply and since in permanently submerged concrete this is dependent on dissolved oxygen and diffusivity through saturated concrete, the process is significantly inhibited relative to reinforced concrete in the splash zone.\n\nNevertheless, concrete exposed to seawater on one side and air on the other, as in an immersed tube, is a special case of the corrosion process. The mechanism was first postulated during the ‘Concrete in the Oceans’ research program by CIRIA/UEG on offshore gravity structures and applied to hollow legs of oil platforms.\n\nThe relatively free availability of oxygen at the inside surface enables the inner reinforcement to become highly cathodic and set up galvanic action with the outer layer of reinforcement. The resistance of the electrolyte is reduced by saturation by water and further still by chlorides, so that the true “hollow leg effect” has to be assessed from actual penetration of seawater chlorides into structural concrete.\n\nIt can be seen that whilst concrete totally immersed in seawater would normally be “low risk”, the presence of oxygen within the tube contributes to a greater than normal risk.\n\nIt is obvious that the cement used in a structure such as this will play a major role in achieving low chloride penetration, low heat of hydration and minimal drying shrinkage cracking. With prior knowledge that blended cements gave better performance with these characteristics than Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) it was decided to further investigate the following blends:\n\nThe aggregates used would also play an important role in the concrete particularly with drying shrinkage, which was one of the stringent requirements of the concrete specification for obvious reasons.\n\nFurther, good quality high density natural aggregates were readily available, but the use of slag as an aggregate might have cost and shrinkage advantages. Accordingly, a series of laboratory trials were set up to test these conclusions quantitatively.\n\nThe time/temperature plots showed that by using cement replacement methods, it was possible to simulate the approximate level of heat of hydration output from low heat Type C cement. The ACSE/ggbfs (50/50) mix using natural aggregate produced marginally the best result based on these particular tests. An ACSE/ggbfs (35/65) mix would be expected to produce a better result.\n\nAccordingly, it was decided to concentrate on ggbfs mixes, particularly with their high resistance to chloride attack, and wide use in Europe for marine structures. Despite the excellent shrinkage performance of the slag aggregates, no precedent for its use in major marine structures could be found outside Australia.\n\nSince the test results also confirmed its density to be about 3% less than equivalent Dunmore basalt mixes, it was reluctantly decided not to pursue the use of slag aggregate.\n\nCONCLUSIONS"
