        "text": "Dr. James N. Masterson, DO, of Greensburg, passed away unexpectedly on Monday, July 31, 2023.\n\nJames “Jim” is preceded in death by his father, Nicholas. He is survived by his mother, Mary; wife, Carrie; daughters, Carlie (Giovanni), and Lexi; brother, Peter (Theresa); nephew and nieces, Cole (Carmen), Bianca, Marina, Sophia, and Gina; family dog, Champ; and grand-dogs, Millie, Maeve, and Maia.\n\nJim was and forever will be beloved by his family and the community at large. Jim poured his heart and soul into his work, which provided a beautiful life for his family and healing opportunities for community members who suffered from concussions/brain injuries.\n\nJim was the Director of the Concussion Management Program of Excela Health Sports Medicine and Orthopedics. Due to his empathetic nature and compassion for his patients, Jim was the winner of career related awards, including several selections for the Patients Choice Award and the Compassionate Doctor Award.\n\nJim created an atmosphere where his patients felt heard, seen, and fully cared for. During their darkest hours, Jim gave his patients hope. Jim created the Westmoreland County Concussion Support Group, where patients could learn more about their injuries and create bonds with other community members.\n\nDespite his busy schedule, Jim never missed a tennis match, gymnastics meet, or pole vault competition for his daughters. His love and support for his family was genuine and will be cherished forever.\n\nJim left a positive impact on every member of the community who was blessed to meet him. To keep his spirit alive, we ask the community to live in kindness.\n\nThe family will be mourning his loss privately at this time and will invite the community to a Celebration of Life in the coming weeks. Further information about this celebration will be published at a later date. LEO M. BACHA FUNERAL HOME, INC., 516 Stanton Street, Greensburg is assisting with arrangements. www.bachafh.com\n\n***************************************************************************************************************************************\n\nCelebration of Life honoring Dr. James N. Masterson, DO, of Greensburg, who passed away unexpectedly on Monday, July 31, 2023.\n\nThe Masterson family welcomes all to join them for a Celebration of Life in honor of Dr. Jim Masterson on Sunday, October 1st from 1-3pm at the Hempfield Area High School Field House. This will allow attendees the opportunity to share memories and express condolences as well as gratitude for the great Doctor and man Jim was. Jim always felt that a life should be celebrated upon death, rather than grieved. We will try to honor his wishes at this event.\n\nJim was so proud of the Sports Medicine and Concussion program that he founded, grew, and tirelessly worked to make one of the best in the country. At the Celebration, there will also be several activities, allowing opportunities to make small donations in Jim’s memory. Proceeds will be used to fund an annual event prior to the start of the busy fall season promoting mental health awareness and suicide prevention for the Sports Medicine Team he worked with.\n\nPlease wear purple to the event in honor of Jim's favorite color and football team.\n\nIf you are unable to attend, but would still like to contribute, donations can be made through:\n\nCheck:\n\nTo: Carrie Masterson (Memo: Dr. Jim Masterson Memorial)\n\nMail: Sport Medicine and Concussion Office\n\nAttn: Dr. Jim Masterson Memorial\n\n410 Pellis Rd.\n\nGreensburg, PA 15601\n\nOr by Venmo: @Carlie-Masterson (subject: Dr. Jim Masterson Memorial)\n\nPlease look for a Facebook event page for additional details."
