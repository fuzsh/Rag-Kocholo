        "text": "While working as an actor, Masterson was also writing a story based on the Chicken Ranch in La Grange, a brothel that operated for decades with tacit law enforcement and political approval before being exposed in 1973.\n\nMasterson and Larry L. King wrote the book for the musical, and Masterson directed it with fellow Houstonian Tommy Tune. Masterson’s wife, Carlin Glynn, starred in the show and won a Tony Award for lead actress.\n\nThe musical became a hit, and Masterson and Tune won a Drama Desk award for direction, with Masterson sharing Tony nominations for best book with King and best direction with King for the show, which ran for more than 1,500 performances. It was later adapted for a 1982 film starring Dolly Parton and Burt Reynolds.\n\nIn 1985, Masterson directed the film The Trip to Bountiful, which earned him a best director nomination from the Independent Spirit Awards. The film’s star, Geraldine Page, won an Oscar for her work.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 58 years, Carlin Glynn Masterson; his children, Alexandra Masterson, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Peter Carlos Bee Masterson; and six grandchildren."
