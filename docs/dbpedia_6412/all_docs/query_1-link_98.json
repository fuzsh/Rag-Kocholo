This document is Petitioner Daniel Peter Masterson's reply to the People's answer to his petition for review by the Supreme Court of California. It argues that review is necessary for three reasons: 1) To determine whether the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine, which prohibits courts from interpreting religious texts, applies to criminal cases which has not been clearly established, 2) To assess whether the doctrine was violated when the magistrate interpreted Scientology scripture to evaluate witness credibility, and 3) To establish whether any error was \"structural\" and automatically reversible or if a harmless error standard applies. The reply contends the People's arguments that the error did not impact the case outcome ignore relevant legal standards for preliminary hearings.",
