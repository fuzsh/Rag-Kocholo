        "text": "Bijou Phillips is splitting up with Danny Masterson.\n\nThe “That ’70s Show” star's wife filed for divorce on Sept. 18 in Santa Barbara Superior Court, according to court records. The news comes less than two weeks after Masterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for rape.\n\nThe model and actor cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the split.\n\nPhillips' lawyer, Peter A. Lauzon, gave the following statement to NBC News:\n\n\"Ms. Phillips has decided to file for divorce from her husband during this unfortunate time. Her priority remains with her daughter,\" he said. \"This period has been unimaginably hard on the marriage and the family. Mr. Masterson was always present for Ms. Phillips during her most difficult times of her life. Ms. Phillips acknowledges that Mr. Masterson is a wonderful father to their daughter. She hopes that everyone will respect her family’s privacy in these difficult times.\"\n\nAn attorney for Masterson declined to comment.\n\nMasterson and Phillips have been married since 2011 and have one child together, 9-year-old daughter Fianna Masterson. According to the court documents, she is seeking spousal support, legal fees and to have her name restored to Bijou Phillips.\n\nShe is also asking for legal and physical custody of their daughter, with child visitation granted to Masterson.\n\nIn May, Masterson was convicted on two counts of rape at his retrial in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sept. 7, he was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for raping two women more than two decades ago at his Hollywood Hills home.\n\nPhillips attended her husband’s trials and submitted letters in support of Masterson during his sentencing, saying the actor is a doting father and “a life-saving partner to me.”\n\n“We need him more than you can imagine,” Phillips wrote in the letter dated just last month. “I know he has been convicted of serious crimes. But the man I married has only been an extraordinary husband to me and a devoted father to our daughter.”\n\nAfter Masterson's sentencing was announced, Phillips left the courtroom without a word.\n\nHere's a look back at their relationship.\n\n2005: Danny Masterson and Bijou Phillips meet\n\nPhillips, whose father is musician John Phillips and mother is actress/model Genevieve Waite, met during a celebrity poker tournament in Las Vegas in August of that year.\n\nThe actors were seated next to each other.\n\nThey start dating shortly after, attending various red carpet events together and showing off their PDA.\n\nMasterson and Phillips also co-starred in a number of films together, including \"Made for Each Other.\"\n\n2011: The get married\n\nThe two actors got married on October 18, 2011.\n\nPer People, they had an intimate ceremony with friends and family in the Irish countryside at a private castle.\n\n2014: They welcome their first child together\n\nTheir daughter, Fianna Francis Masterson was born on Feb. 14, 2014. Over the years, Masterson would share highlights from his life with his wife and daughter on his Instagram.\n\n2022: Masterson's final post with his family\n\nOver the years, Masterson would celebrate his wife’s birthday, special moments together as a family and more.\n\nOn Oct. 4, 2022, “The Ranch” actor shared a selfie of him with Phillips, their daughter and dog.\n\n“After a long two days in LA it’s coming home to these 3 perfect ladies that makes a boy smile,” he captioned the photo.\n\nThis would be the final post he would put on his grid amid his legal troubles."
