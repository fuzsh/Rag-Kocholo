        "text": "Masterson made his New York stage debut in \"Call Me By My Rightful Name\" in 1961 and has subsequently worked in films, theater and TV. He was one of the husbands in \"The Stepford Wives\" (1974), earned praise in the leading role in the stage production \"The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald\" (1967) and in the TV-movie \"A Question of Guilt\" (CBS, 1978). In 1978, Masterson co-wrote (with Carol Hall and Larry L King) and co-directed (with Tommy Tune) the Broadway musical \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,\" which brought Masterson's wife, Carlin Glynn a Tony Award as Best Featured Actress. He and King also wrote the 1982 feature adaptation and the unsuccessful 1994 stage sequel, \"The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public\" (co-directed by Masterson and Tommy Tune)."
