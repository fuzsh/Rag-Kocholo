        "text": "35 Years and still going strong! Having a father who just retired after 35 years at his company, and a mother who is beating his record and heading into more, these work-ethics have been all I've ever known, being only 27 myself. Like they say about education, \"It starts at home\" - and while it may seem like a stretch for me to reach 35 years at 1 company for my life, they have certainly instilled many valuable traits in me that I take to work daily. Just a few that have stuck with me are below. Its hard to go 35 years at a company if your attendance is poor. We show up every day ready to go. It wont always be easy - you've got to tough out the hard times, and sometimes the hard people, too. Nobody wants to see a negative-nelly for 35 years. You don't reach that milestone by being unpleasant. Show up with a smile. Thank you Janet Masterson for all the lessons you have shared with me over your 35 years at Kenyon!"
