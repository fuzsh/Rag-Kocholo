        "text": "Peter Masterson, who has died aged 84, was an actor, director and writer best known for co-writing and co-directing The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1978), a comedy musical concerning efforts by moral crusaders to close down a Texas brothel.\n\nThe show won mixed reviews but ran on Broadway for almost four years, toured the West End and was turned into a film in 1982, starring Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton.\n\nThe idea for the musical came to Masterson in 1974, when he was appearing on Broadway in That Championship Season and happened upon a copy of Playboy in the dressing room, containing an article by Larry King reporting on the Chicken Ranch brothel (so-called because some customers paid in chickens) in Texas, that had been closed down after 150 years, because of the agitations of a do-gooding television consumer advocate.\n\nFeeling there was potential to turn the story into a show, Masterson got together with King, the composer and lyricist Carol Hall, and the choreographer Tommy Tune – all native Texans – and set to work.\n\nThings did not go smoothly at first. King was a reluctant recruit to the project and would later write an account of the experience in a book called The Whorehouse Papers, in which he confessed that there had been times when he “most sincerely wanted to choke Peter Masterson, Carol Hall, or Tommy Tune – though not always in that order.”\n\nBut eventually the show, an audacious blend of spoof, sex, hoedown music and nostalgia, opened off Broadway and was such a hit that it transferred to Broadway’s 46th Street, where it ran for 1,703 performances. The show featured some of the real girls from the Chicken Ranch and even the real madam, a Miss Edna, who was given a small role.\n\nA 1994 sequel by the same team (minus Tune), The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public, did not do so well, however, closing after just 16 performances. And although he was hired to direct the film version, Masterson was fired before shooting began.\n\nCarlos Bee “Peter” Masterson was born on June 1 1934 in Houston, Texas, and brought up in nearby Angleton, where his father was the district attorney. After taking a degree in History at Rice University, and a brief stint with an oil company, he decided to become an actor, moving to New York to study at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting and polishing his skills as a member of the Actors Studio.\n\nHe made his professional debut on television playing an ape.\n\nDuring the 1960s and ‘70s Masterson appeared in several Broadway plays, winning favourable reviews as the lead in The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1967). He won a starring role as Walter Eberhart in the film The Stepford Wives (1972) and a supporting role in The Exorcist (1973).\n\nMasterson was nominated for two Tony awards for The Best Little Whorehouse, while his wife, the actress Carlin Glynn, won a Tony for her portrayal of Miss Mona, the madam of the improbably wholesome brothel.\n\nAfterwards Masterson turned to film directing, becoming best known for The Trip to Bountiful (1985), adapted from a play by his cousin Horton Foote. The film won a belated Best Actress Oscar for Geraldine Page, who played an elderly woman whose bus trip to the home of her youth ends in a ghost town.\n\nIn his teens Masterson had taken up sailing and he had success in competitions. In 1957 he and Bob Mosbacher won the Scandinavian Gold Cup for the US and in 1990 he skippered Above the Line, which took second place in the 5.5-metre World Championships off Torquay.\n\nMasterson is survived by his wife and by two daughters and a son.\n\nPeter Masterson, born June 1 1934, died December 19 2018"
