        "text": "Masterson's son, also called Peter, said his father died on Tuesday from complications from Parkinson's disease at his home in Kinderhook, New York.\n\nBorn Carlos Masterson, but known as Peter because his father preferred that name, Masterson often worked with family members.\n\nHis cousin was the-Texas born playwright Horton Foote, who wrote the stage version of The Trip to Bountiful, the lyrical story of an elderly woman in Houston who longs to return to her home community.\n\nGeraldine Page won an Oscar for her starring performance in the 1985 film, which also featured Rebecca De Mornay and John Heard.\n\nMasterson earlier had success in the theatre as one of the creators of The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, inspired by the real-life Chicken Ranch brothel.\n\nThe story began as a 1974 Playboy article by Larry L. King and was expanded into a musical after a dinner party conversation among Masterson, King and songwriter Carol Hall, who died last autumn.\n\nAlthough described by The New York Times as \"an erratic and ambling, if sleekly produced, business\", the play ran for more than three years on Broadway after opening in 1978.\n\nMasterson received Tony nominations for direction and choreography, while his wife, Carlin Glynn, won a best actress Tony.\n\nA 1982 film adaptation starring Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton was a box office success but also a troubled production.\n\nMasterson was supposed to help direct and write the movie but Universal replaced him with Colin Higgins.\n\nMeanwhile, Reynolds and Parton reportedly did not get along, with Parton later calling the film a \"nightmare\".\n\nMasterson also worked with his daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson, known for such movies as Fried Green Tomatoes.\n\nShe made her debut in The Stepford Wives, the 1975 film version of Ira Levin's novel about the extreme submissiveness of women in a Connecticut suburb.\n\nPeter Masterson and Katharine Ross starred as newly arrived residents of Stepford, with Mary Stuart Masterson playing one of their two children.\n\nHis other acting credits included In the Heat of the Night, The Exorcist and Gardens of Stone.\n\nMasterson also directed including Convicts, starring Robert Duvall."
