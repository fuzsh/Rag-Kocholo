        "text": "Brief History\n\nThe Jomo Kenyatta Foundation is Kenya’s pioneer publishing house that was founded in 1966. The company is a publisher and printer of quality school text books produced for the approved curriculum and general readers. JKF books are used in both primary and secondary schools. Several titles are also available for use in tertiary institutions. Since JKF publications are produced to the highest standards in terms of paper quality and binding, each time you buy our book you get the best product in terms of quality. In addition, by buying a JKF book you contribute towards the JKF Scholarships Fund which is dedicated to the education of bright but needy students in public secondary schools countrywide.\n\nMission\n\nOur mission is to advance education and knowledge for poverty alleviation through quality publishing and provision of scholarships.\n\nVision\n\nOur vision is to be the premier publishing house in Eastern Africa and a leading scholarship provider to the needy in Kenya.\n\nCore values\n\nProfessionalism – Doing our work to the best of our skills, training and professional ethics\n\nIntegrity – Conducting ourselves with honesty and dignity\n\nFairness – Giving service with equity and without favour\n\nInnovativeness – Always seeking to use methods that enhance performance and results\n\nTeamwork – Working with others for better results\n\nAccountability – Taking responsibility for our actions\n\nJKF Scholarship Programme\n\nThe JKF Scholarship Programme started in 1968 is an educational fund set up by The Jomo Kenyatta Foundation (JKF) to assist bright but needy students in public secondary schools in Kenya.\n\nThe JKF Scholarship Programme’s objectives are to break the poverty cycle, create smart future leaders, and to improve transition rate from primary to secondary and from secondary to tertiary levels of education as per the Vision 2030.\n\nFunds to run the Programme had for long been singly sourced from the sale of JKF publications. It was found, however, that the growing demand for scholarships could only be satisfied with complementary sources of revenue.\n\nConsequently, the Foundation embarked on fundraising from corporates, development partners, donors, Non-Governmental Organizations, institutions and individuals through:\n\n1) Joint funding initiatives\n\n2) Adopt a child initiative through JKF\n\n3) Buying JKF publications\n\n4) Hiring out the JKF grounds\n\n5) Participation in fundraising activities that include, and not limited to, annual walks, dinners and golf tournaments.\n\nContacts\n\nHead Office, Enterprise Rd.
