        "text": "African Institute for Capacity Development (AICAD) Strategic Plan 2019-2024 provides the road map for planning, operations and decision making for the period ahead. This is the Institute’s third Strategic Plan document since its establishment in 2000. It therefore sets out a realistic strategic programme that will allow the Institute to build on the achievements, lessons learnt and progress made to date. In addition, the Strategic Plan has been crafted to be responsive to the changing environment by recognizing and placing greater emphasis on public, private, people and Industry partnerships that are anchored upon an entrepreneurial approach.\n\nIt is on this basis that clear strategies and detailed activities have been developed to help achieve each of the set strategic themes, goals and objectives. The development of the Strategic Plan followed an all-inclusive and participatory process which included desk reviews of existing policy documents and other relevant publications; several workshops and discussions on the various strategic themes as well as consultations with various key stakeholders. The Institute’s Secretariat would, therefore, wish to give special thanks to the AICAD Governing Board members for their special interest, guidance, and support during the preparation of the Plan. The Secretariat would also wish to acknowledge and thank; The AICAD management and staff for their support, feedback and in puts that made this exercise possible. The three-member East African Governments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and stakeholders for the feedback and recommendations provided during the Strategic Planning process.\n\nThe team of consultants led by Prof. Henry Bwisa for their facilitation of the strategic planning process and guidance provided in conceptualizing the approaches and issues contained in the plan. AICAD’s success will depend on the Institute’s ability to generate the necessary resources needed for implementation of this strategic plan, our ability to work together at all levels of AICAD as a team and our ability to monitor and evaluate implementation of the plan. The least of the words to all is success. I wish everyone the very best in executing the stipulated plans."
