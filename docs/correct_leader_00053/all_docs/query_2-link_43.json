        "text": "The independent Republic of Kenya was established in 1964. This exhibition introduces many of the people who helped lay the foundation for the birth of the Kenyan nation from early freedom fighters to Jomo Kenyatta, the nation's first president. Each year Kenya's citizens celebrate and commemorate these founders on Mashujaa Day - the annual national holiday on October 20th.\n\nThe first Prime Minister of a self ruling Kenya, the first president of the Republic of Kenya and considered the founding father of the nation. Jomo Kenyatta was considered a Pan-Africanist, and one of the most pro-British of the African leaders despite the fact that he was imprisoned from 1952-1959 by the British court for his anti-colonialist activities. Throughout his years in leadership roles, first as the Prime Minister (1963-64) and then President until his death in 1978, he followed a policy of political consolidation. He engaged with European governments and the U.S., and saw Kenya's entrance to the United Nations. Kenyatta during his long tenure is credited with implementing post-colonial land reform, governmental institutions, and driving the development of capitalist infrastructure, and creating economic stability."
