        "text": "Latest figures show KANU has a majority in the House of Representatives - with 58 seats - over Ronald Ngala's Kenya African Democratic Union which has 28 seats. The only white candidate, Edward Hawkins, has lost his deposit.\n\nIn an address to the nation, Mr Kenyatta, aged 73 and known by his fellow Kikuyu as \"Burning Spear\", called for tribal and racial differences to be buried in favour of national unity under \"the principles of democratic African socialism\".\n\nHe said although his government aimed to free itself from British colonialism, it would not try to avenge past injustices.\n\n\"We are not to look to the past - racial bitterness, the denial of fundamental rights, the suppression of our culture... Let there be forgiveness,\" he said.\n\nTomorrow, he will be summoned by the British Governor, Malcolm MacDonald, to form a government in Government House.\n\n\"Leader to darkness and death\"\n\nIt was here just three years ago that Mr Kenyatta was described by former governor Sir Patrick Renison as \"the African leader to darkness and death\".\n\nTen years ago, Mr Kenyatta, was jailed and later sent into internal exile by the British for his alleged involvement in the Mau Mau movement, a secret society of the Kikuyu tribe bent on achieving independence from Britain.\n\nMore than 14,000 Africans and Asians and 95 whites died between 1952 and 1957 during the Mau Mau rebellion.\n\nThe pressure of other African states for independence led to Mr Kenyatta's release in 1961 after which he discussed a new constitution for Kenya with the British."
