        "text": "Yes, you can certainly take a tour of the space before signing up for a membership. In fact, it’s encouraged, to help you get a feel for what your workday will look like. to set up a time to come and see the space.\n\nThe open desk is the way to go if you’re looking for a flexible workspace in an open environment where you can socialize with other members. Or, choose a dedicated desk if you want a designated space that also allows you to keep in touch with the community.\n\nA private office works wonders if you or your team need a quiet, secluded space to conduct your work and interact with people in your organization.\n\nIt’s important to understand the different types of coworking arrangements available to you, depending on the type of work that you do and its duration, and whether you’re a solo worker or part of a team.\n\nMost, if not all, amenities are available to you as a member, regardless of the type of membership. Some shared spaces, like the meeting rooms, need to be booked in advance and private offices are only available for those with a subscription. However, all the other areas, like the lounge, kitchen and breakout spaces, are usable by every member. All complimentary services are available and anything ancillary can be purchased or negotiated with Dragon Pass."
