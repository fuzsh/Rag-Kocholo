        "text": "283. Memorandum From the Department of State Executive Secretary (Read) to the President’s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs (Bundy)1\n\nSUBJECT\n\nCongo (Leopoldville)\n\nA Congolese rebel message was intercepted this morning from the rebel commander in Stanleyville to the Commander-in-Chief located at Paulis, stating that five American planes had bombed rebel-held Burma and requesting authority to “kill all Americans who are in the liberated zone.” We have no indication as yet of what reply, if any, has been made, but we are continuing to monitor.\n\nWhile there is a possibility that the message may be another of several lesser warnings we have received, the source and nature of the communication lead us to believe that it should be treated as more than a threat.\n\nThe Department immediately dispatched an appeal to the Prime Minister of Kenya, Mr. Kenyatta in his capacity as Chairman of the Organization of African Unity Commission on the Congo, asking him to urge the rebel leaders not to harm Americans in rebel-held territories.2 As a result of Ambassador MacArthur’s representations made on telephonic instructions,3 the Belgian Foreign Office is trying to get a message to the rebel leaders through their Embassy at Bujumbura to use all persuasions to safeguard the lives of our people. Ambassador Godley in Leopoldville has seen Prime Minister Tshombe who states that he will issue an appeal to the rebels not to dishonor the Congo’s name by mistreating foreigners in the areas which they control. The GOC has since issued such an appeal over the radio in Leo.4\n\n[Page 412]\n\nWe are once again making certain that the T–28 fighters and B–26 bombers now on loan from the United States to the Congolese Government are under adequate control and following current guidance which is calculated to minimize risks against the lives of Americans in rebel-held areas.\n\nSince this matter will be in the news here at any moment we are consulting urgently what to advise the President when it breaks and we will be in touch with you on this subject shortly."
