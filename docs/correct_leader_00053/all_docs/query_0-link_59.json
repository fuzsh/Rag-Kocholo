        "text": "Nairobi has two main commercial airports. Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) is the main hub that major international airlines fly in and out of and is likely to be your first arrival port when entering Kenya. The smaller regional airlines, such as Air Kenya and Safarilink operate out of Nairobi’s Wilson Airport, which is 17km away from JKIA. The newly constructed byway has made travelling between these two airports much quicker, but it is still important to factor in an adequate amount of time between connections, as the city’s traffic situation varies significantly throughout the day.\n\nPlease note that all scheduled internal flights carry a luggage restriction of 15kg per person in soft bags, including carry-ons. The acceptance of excess baggage is at the sole discretion of the airline but some offer the option to purchase an additional freight seat for luggage weighing up to 75kg.\n\n–An approved Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA). All foreign travellers, including infants and children, must have an approved Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) prior to travel to Kenya\n\n–The eTA must be applied for through the online portal (https://etakenya.go.ke). Your eTA is valid for 90 days from the date of issuance\n\n–An eTA fee is applicable for many nationalities including the US and UK\n\n–An eTA is not required if you have a valid East African Tourist Visa (EATV) for travel to Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda\n\n–A valid passport for at least six months from the date of entry, recommended with at least two blank pages (temporary passports will not be accepted)\n\n–Passport holders from the following EAC countries are exempted from applying for an eTA: Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda\n\nThere are no compulsory vaccinations required for entry to Kenya.\n\n–Travellers arriving from an endemic country will be required to present a valid yellow fever certificate for all travellers older than one year\n\n–Vaccinations need to be administered 10 days or more prior to travel, and the certificate will need to be provided as proof. Depending on your onward travel plans, or country of residence, you may also be required to have a yellow fever certificate for entry\n\n–Yellow fever certificates now have a lifetime validity\n\nThe local currency is the Kenyan Shilling (KES). US dollars are widely accepted, though you may have some trouble with notes of larger denomination or those issued prior to the year 2000. At certain bank branches USD $ are available over the counter, but are not available for withdrawal from ATMs. We recommend travelling with some USD $ in cash, for any eventuality, and in multiple denominations. Many local restaurants will accept US$, though prices are shown in Kenyan Shillings and typically inclusive of all taxes and levies. All major credit cards are widely accepted: Visa, MasterCard, American Express & Diner’s Club.\n\nBased in Nairobi, Angama Safaris has a dedicated ground handling team ready to ensure your travels will be carefree, with the same high-touch approach to service that you have come to expect from Angama. With offices at Wilson Airport in Nairobi, we have two five-passenger WiFi-enabled, air-conditioned Hyundai vehicles and professional city driver guides.\n\nNairobi has a reputation for high levels of traffic congestion but the completion of several byways throughout the city has resulted in a significant improvement in jams and delays. It is strongly recommended, however, that you have an adequate amount of time between flight connections, as traffic remains an ongoing issue and is somewhat unpredictable.\n\nAngama Safaris offers a meet-and-greet service at Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. This service is on a par with a diplomatic meet-and-greet standards, is discreet and seamless. You will be met airside as you enter the terminal building and will be graciously escorted to the front of the queue at diplomatic immigration counter where formalities are finalised. The host will then accompany you to the luggage carousel, assisting with bags before escorting you through customs. The host is in constant contact with our city driver guide who will be waiting to collect you just outside the terminal building"
