        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nTrade centers such as Mombasa have existed along the Kenyan and Tanzanian coastlines, known as the Land of Zanj, since at least the 2nd century. These centers traded with the outside world, including China, India, Indonesia, the Middle East, North Africa, and Persia. By around the 9th century, the mix of Africans, Arabs, and Persians who lived and traded there became known as Swahili (\"people of the coast\") with a distinct language (KiSwahili) and culture. The Portuguese arrived in the 1490s and, using Mombasa as a base, sought to monopolize trade in the Indian Ocean. The Portuguese were pushed out in the late 1600s by the combined forces of Oman and Pate, an island off the coast. In 1890, Germany and the UK divided up the region, with the UK taking the north and the Germans the south, including present-day Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. The British established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which in 1920 was converted into a colony and named Kenya after its highest mountain. Numerous political disputes between the colony and the UK subsequently led to the violent Mau Mau Uprising, which began in 1952, and the eventual declaration of independence in 1963.\n\nJomo KENYATTA, the founding president and an icon of the liberation struggle, led Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when Vice President Daniel Arap MOI took power in a constitutional succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969 until 1982, after which time the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) changed the constitution to make itself the sole legal political party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and fraud. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA, the son of founding president Jomo KENYATTA, and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption platform.Â\n\nKIBAKI's reelection in 2007 resulted in two months of post-election ethnic violence that caused the death of more than 1,100 people and the dislocation of hundreds of thousands. Opposition candidate, Raila ODINGA, accused the government of widespread vote rigging. African Union-sponsored mediation led by former UN Secretary General Kofi ANNAN resulted in a power-sharing accord that brought ODINGA into the government in the restored position of prime minister. The power sharing accord included a broad reform agenda, the centerpiece of which was constitutional reform. In 2010, Kenyans overwhelmingly adopted a new constitution in a national referendum. The new constitution introduced additional checks and balances to executive power and devolved power and resources to 47 newly created counties. It also eliminated the position of prime minister. Uhuru KENYATTA won the first presidential election under the new constitution in March 2013. KENYATTA won a second and final term in office in November 2017 following a contentious, repeat election. In August 2022, William RUTO won a close presidential election; he assumed the office the following month after the Kenyan Supreme Court upheld the victory.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nEastern Africa, bordering the Indian Ocean, between Somalia and Tanzania\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n1 00 N, 38 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 580,367 sq km\n\nland: 569,140 sq km\n\nwater: 11,227 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 51\n\nArea - comparative\n\nfive times the size of Ohio; slightly more than twice the size of Nevada\n\nArea comparison map\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 3,457 km\n\nborder countries (5): Ethiopia 867 km; Somalia 684 km; South Sudan 317 km; Tanzania 775 km; Uganda 814 km\n\nCoastline\n\n536 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\n\nClimate\n\nvaries from tropical along coast to arid in interior\n\nTerrain\n\nlow plains rise to central highlands bisected by Great Rift Valley; fertile plateau in west\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Mount Kenya 5,199 m\n\nlowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m\n\nmean elevation: 762 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nlimestone, soda ash, salt, gemstones, fluorspar, zinc, diatomite, gypsum, wildlife, hydropower\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 48.1% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 9.8% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0.9% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 37.4% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 6.1% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 45.8% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n1,030 sq km (2012)\n\nMajor lakes (area sq km)\n\nfresh water lake(s): Lake Victoria (shared with Tanzania and Uganda) - 62,940 sq km\n\nsalt water lake(s): Lake Turkana (shared with Ethiopia) - 6,400 sq km\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nAtlantic Ocean drainage: (Mediterranean Sea) Nile (3,254,853 sq km)\n\nMajor aquifers\n\nOgaden-Juba Basin\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation heavily concentrated in the west along the shore of Lake Victoria; other areas of high density include the capital of Nairobi, and in the southeast along the Indian Ocean coast as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\nrecurring drought; flooding during rainy seasons\n\nvolcanism: limited volcanic activity; the Barrier (1,032 m) last erupted in 1921; South Island is the only other historically active volcano\n\nGeography - note\n\nthe Kenyan Highlands comprise one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa; glaciers are found on Mount Kenya, Africa's second highest peak; unique physiography supports abundant and varied wildlife of scientific and economic value; Lake Victoria, the world's largest tropical lake and the second largest fresh water lake, is shared among three countries: Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n55,864,655 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 27\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Kenyan(s)\n\nadjective: Kenyan\n\nEthnic groups\n\nKikuyu 17.1%, Luhya 14.3%, Kalenjin 13.4%, Luo 10.7%, Kamba 9.8%, Somali 5.8%, Kisii 5.7%, Mijikenda 5.2%, Meru 4.2%, Maasai 2.5%, Turkana 2.1%,Â non-Kenyan 1%, other 8.2% (2019 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish (official), Kiswahili (official), numerous indigenous languages\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nThe World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.

Almost 40% of Kenyans are under the age of 15 as of 2022 because of sustained high fertility, early marriage and childbearing, and an unmet need for family planning. Kenyaâs persistent rapid population growth strains the labor market, social services, arable land, and natural resources. Although Kenya in 1967 was the first Sub-Saharan country to launch a nationwide family planning program, progress in reducing the birth rate has largely stalled since the late 1990s, when the government decreased its support for family planning to focus on the HIV epidemic. Government commitment and international technical support spurred Kenyan contraceptive use, decreasing the fertility rate (children per woman) from about 8 in the late 1970s to less than 5 children twenty years later, but it has plateaued at 3 children as of 2022.\n\nKenya is a source of emigrants and a host country for refugees. In the 1960s and 1970s, Kenyans pursued higher education in the UK because of colonial ties, but as British immigration rules tightened, the US, the then Soviet Union, and Canada became attractive study destinations. Kenyaâs stagnant economy and political problems during the 1980s and 1990s led to an outpouring of Kenyan students and professionals seeking permanent opportunities in the West and southern Africa. Nevertheless, Kenyaâs relative stability since its independence in 1963 has attracted hundreds of thousands of refugees escaping violent conflicts in neighboring countries; Kenya was sheltering nearly 280,000 Somali refugees as of 2022.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 38.71% (male 10,412,321/female 10,310,908)\n\n15-24 years: 20.45% (male 5,486,641/female 5,460,372)\n\n25-54 years: 33.75% (male 9,046,946/female 9,021,207)\n\n55-64 years: 4.01% (male 1,053,202/female 1,093,305)\n\n65 years and over: 3.07% (male 750,988/female 892,046) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 70.2\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 65.3\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 4.8\n\npotential support ratio: 20.7 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 20 years\n\nmale: 19.9 years\n\nfemale: 20.1 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 195\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n2.12% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 38\n\nBirth rate\n\n26.39 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 43\n\nDeath rate\n\n5.01 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 196\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-0.19 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 111\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation heavily concentrated in the west along the shore of Lake Victoria;

Kenyaâs real GDP growth has averaged over 5% for the last decade. Since 2014, Kenya has been ranked as a lower middle income country because its per capita GDP crossed a World Bank threshold. While Kenya has a growing entrepreneurial middle class and steady growth, its economic development has been impaired by weak governance and corruption. Although reliable numbers are hard to find, unemployment and under-employment are extremely high, and could be near 40% of the population. In 2013, the country adopted a devolved system of government with the creation of 47 counties, and is in the process of devolving state revenues and responsibilities to the counties.\n\nÂ\n\nAgriculture remains the backbone of the Kenyan economy, contributing one-third of GDP. About 75% of Kenyaâs population of roughly 48.5 million work at least part-time in the agricultural sector, including livestock and pastoral activities. Over 75% of agricultural output is from small-scale, rain-fed farming or livestock production. Tourism also holds a significant place in Kenyaâs economy. In spite of political turmoil throughout the second half of 2017, tourism was up 20%, showcasing the strength of this sector. Kenya has long been a target of terrorist activity and has struggled with instability along its northeastern borders. Some high visibility terrorist attacks during 2013-2015 (e.g., at Nairobiâs Westgate Mall and Garissa University) affected the tourism industry severely, but the sector rebounded strongly in 2016-2017 and appears poised to continue growing.\n\nÂ\n\nInadequate infrastructure continues to hamper Kenyaâs efforts to improve its annual growth so that it can meaningfully address poverty and unemployment. The KENYATTA administration has been successful in courting external investment for infrastructure development. International financial institutions and donors remain important to Kenya's growth and development, but Kenya has also successfully raised capital in the global bond market issuing its first sovereign bond offering in mid-2014, with a second occurring in February 2018. The first phase of a Chinese-financed and constructed standard gauge railway connecting Mombasa and Nairobi opened in May 2017.\n\nÂ\n\nIn 2016 the government was forced to take over three small and undercapitalized banks when underlying weaknesses were exposed. The government also enacted legislation that limits interest rates banks can charge on loans and set a rate that banks must pay their depositors. This measure led to a sharp shrinkage of credit in the economy. A prolonged election cycle in 2017 hurt the economy, drained government resources, and slowed GDP growth. Drought-like conditions in parts of the country pushed 2017 inflation above 8%, but the rate had fallen to 4.5% in February 2018.\n\nÂ\n\nThe economy, however, is well placed to resume its decade-long 5%-6% growth rate. While fiscal deficits continue to pose risks in the medium term, other economic indicators, including foreign exchange reserves, interest rates, current account deficits, remittances and FDI are positive. The credit and drought-related impediments were temporary. Now In his second term, President KENYATTA has pledged to make economic growth and development a centerpiece of his second administration, focusing on his \"Big Four\" initiatives of universal healthcare, food security, affordable housing, and expansion of manufacturing.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$226.94 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$227.64 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$216.05 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 63\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n5.39% (2019 est.)\n\n6.32% (2018 est.)\n\n4.79% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 38\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$4,200 (2020 est.)\n\n$4,300 (2019 est.)\n\n$4,200 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 181\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$95.52 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n5.1% (2019 est.)\n\n4.6% (2018 est.)\n\n8% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 181\n\nCredit ratings\n\nFitch rating: B+ (2007)\n\nMoody's rating: B2 (2018)\n\nStandard & Poors rating: B+ (2010)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP -
