        "text": "Airport Overview\n\nJomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) is Kenya’s largest aviation facility and the busiest airport in east and central Africa. It serves as a transit hub for major airlines as well as the gateway for visitors to other Africa's airports. The airport also serves as a major cargo centre for both inbound and outbound goods. The Government of Kenya, in its Vision 2030, recognises that an improved and expanded airport infrastructure is critical to the realization of the long-term development aspiration of the Country. In line with its vision, the proposed modernization and expansion of the JKIA is aimed at strengthening the competitive position of the airport as a regional logistical hub and a key gateway into East and Central Africa. The airport currently operates a single runway, which was developed in 1978, and whose configuration is undermining operational efficiency at the airport in terms of delays to aircraft movements at peak hours.\n\nAirport Location and Contact\n\nCountry\n\nCountry Kenya.\n\nCounty\n\nEmbakasi sub- County in Nairobi County\n\nNearest Town or City\n\nwith Distance from the Airport\n\nNairobi City 18 km to the Airport\n\nAirport’s Complete Name\n\nJomo Kenyatta International Airport\n\nLatitude\n\nLatitude -1°19'5.40\" S\n\nLongitude\n\nLongitude 36°55'23.39\" E\n\nElevation (ft and m)\n\n5,327 Feet above sea level\n\nIATA Code\n\nNBO\n\nICAO Code\n\nHKJK\n\nManaging Company or Airport Authority\n\nKenya Airports Authority\n\nManagement Contact Person\n\nAlex Gitari, MD and CEO, Kenya Airports Authority\n\nOpen From (hours)\n\n00:00Hrs\n\nOpen To (hours)\n\n00:00 Hrs\n\nAirport Picture\n\nFormer International Arrivals\n\nTerminal 1A International arrivals and departures.\n\nTerminal 1B International Departures.\n\nTerminal 1C International Departures.\n\nTerminal 1D Domestic flights terminal.\n\nTerminal 1E International Arrivals.\n\nTerminal 2.\n\nDescription and Contacts of Key Companies\n\nKenya Civil Aviation Authority\n\nKenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) is a state corporation of Kenya that is responsible for regulating the aviation industry in Kenya and for providing air navigation services in the Kenya flight region.

Terminal 2 is used by low-cost carriers. The original terminal, sometimes referred to as Old Embakasi Airport is located on the north side of the runway and is used by the Kenya Defence Forces.\n\nFigures from KAA indicate that the airport's Terminal 1-A has a capacity of 2.5 million passengers. The Kenyan government is targeting over 25 million passengers annually by 2025 on the expansion of JKIA's terminals.

To import any goods such as cars or machinery requires the engagement of a customs clearing agent who will process the import documentation through Kenya Customs electronically on the Simba 2005 system and clear the goods on behalf of the importers. An import declaration fee (IDF) of 2% of the Customs Value is payable. When engaging with your preferred clearing agent ensure you always have: 1. Import Declaration Forms (IDF). 2. Customs declaration (Entry). 3. A Certificate of Conformity (CoC) from the PVoC agent for regulated products. 4. An import standard mark (ISM) when applicable. 5. Valid Commercial invoices from the exporting firm. 6 Valid pro forma invoices from the exporting firm. The customs clearing agent is then allowed to declare the goods you are importing on the customs portal known as SIMBA.\n\nFor more information on customs in Kenya, please see the following link:\n\nhttps://www.kra.go.ke/individual/importing/learn-about-importation/how-to-import\n\nStorage Facilities\n\nJKIA has four cargo facilities with a capacity to handle 1.2 million tons.

Strict measures are exercised to counter terrorism and ensure that there is ultimate security at all airports. Due to a well-documented case of lapse in security at JKIA in 2006, all security scanners have been upgraded and all personnel are screened at all check-in points and boarding gates. An ongoing security training exercise is undertaken for all airport workers as well as the National Security Intelligent Service, Kenya Airports Police Unit, Immigration, Kenya Revenue Authority, Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Civil Aviation Authority Port Health and all the Air Operators\n\nFor your safety and of travellers, all passengers as well as their carry-on and registered baggage are screened. Screening is conducted for metal objects such as keys, cell phones and coins. Coat or jacket are taken off and placed in the plastic tray, liquids and gels are presented separately, laptops are removed for separate screening and other instructions given by the security agents must be adhered to. For security reasons, all hold baggage is screened. If during this screening, the security agent suspects the presence of prohibited or dangerous goods, then the security team on the ground is allowed to open the traveller's bag or suitcase. As a rule, the passenger is confronted with their baggage in which case they will be opened in their (passengers) presence, and the security staff will explain the need for extra search being performed."
