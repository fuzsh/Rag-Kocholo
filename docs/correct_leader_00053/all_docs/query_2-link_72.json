        "text": "Lying on the east coast of Africa, shaped like a harp, the Republic of Kenya is a beautiful country with diverse topography. This varied topography divided by the equator contributes to an equally diverse climate since it includes warm coastal locales, temperate grassy plains, cooler highlands, tropical riverine forests and hot, arid desert regions.\n\nYou will also find snow-capped peaks here where the temperatures hover around sub-zero figures. Covering an area of around 224,962 square miles (582,650 square kilometers), it sits on the equator and shares borders with five other African countries – Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia.\n\nKenya’s geography is finely divided into four separate zones. With the Great Rift Valley running through it, Kenya is privileged to host some of the lakes of the valley, some alkaline while the others fresh with constant seismic activity still occurring under them. These avian inhabited lakes like Nakuru, often described as the 'the most fabulous bird spectacle on earth' are home to an astonishing plethora of birdlife, some of them on the endangered list and rare too, found only in Kenya.\n\nCentral Kenya comprises of an elevated, stunning green section spread around its three mountain ranges, Mount Kenya, the Mau and the Aberdares. A very fertile locale that includes lush forests, it produces many important crops that find their way into European markets. Besides the main crops of tea and coffee, Kenya also produces assorted kinds of flowers, fruit and vegetables that are evident of the gentle, temperate climate of its highlands. You will find both small and larger agricultural farms here.\n\nIn stark contrast, about one-third of Kenya is made up of hot arid regions that receive very little rainfall. Surprisingly though, this inhospitable terrain of scorching sands, solidified lava outcroppings and thorny scrubland also hosts the Ngoto, Nyiru, Kulal and Marsabit Mountains that have forests on their peaks watered by mist and frequented by speckled fauna. But Kenya has more.\n\nIts fourth zone features 298 miles (480 kilometers) of Indian Ocean coastline that extends from 10 to 18 miles (16-30 kilometers) inland. Incredible coral reefs with a host of unusual aquatic denizens, shimmering white sands, turquoise blue ocean waters and verdant shore vegetation make up yet another wondrous facet of Kenya’s magical topography.\n\nKenya has an interesting amalgamation of cultures thanks to the centuries of migrants that arrived here and made it home. Every one of these people brought something new to the present day country, and Kenya’s culture that you see today has elements of all. You will find more than 40 various tribes here, among them the Maasai, Samburu, Turkana, Kikuyu, Luo, Luhya, Kalenjin, Kamba, Meru, Kisii and many others, each having their linguistic trends.\n\nTheir languages and those of the Europeans, Asians and Arabs that arrived in Kenya around 1800’s have together melded to create the three main groups of languages. Majority speak their tribal Bantu along with Nilo-Saharan and Cushitic languages while the minority speaks a mixture of Afro-Asian-Arabic dialects.\n\nHowever, the most common voice that is also the national tongue is the Kiswahili language which is an eclectic combination of Bantu and Arabic with a tinge of Persian and also English knockoff words in the industrialized times e.g. busi for bus, koti as coat, baiskeli as bicycle etc. Kenya uses English as its official language.\n\nThe art forms in Kenya have also evolved to include elements of its native tribes’ music and dance with pop trends adopted from America, Europe, Asia and Arabian countries. Benga is a pop-genre of Kenya music created using African drums and modern musical instruments. You will also find strong influences of western dressing styles in the cities and major towns as the favored option of most Kenyans along with a minority of Arab-Swahili attire along the coast. However, in the more remote regions of Kenya, the Turkana, Samburu and Maasai people still prefer to dress traditionally.\n\nThe ethnic form of Kenya’s costumes are stunning to behold, though, most Kenyans save these elaborate clothing for special occasions. If you were to see a traditional Kenyan sporting the full regalia, you would see vibrant colors dominating with a combination of red, blue, black, green and yellow, gorgeous bead jewelry and other forms of ornaments for the body and a collection of traditional weaponries like spears and shields.\n\nMost Kenyans have adopted Christianity as their religion and you will also find Muslims here along with Hindus, Sikhs and a minority of Buddhists and Jews – a true melting pot of Africa living in complete harmony and peace. But the ancient tribal mysticism still prevails as a strong undercurrent in the beliefs of the people.\n\nKenya and the East Coast of Africa have been mentioned in historical records by Roman and Greek sailors dating back to the first century. There are also writings by Arab voyagers like Al Masudi and Ibn Batuta from the seventh and tenth centuries. On the other hand, Kenya’s history dates back to the time when hominids first appeared on earth and archaeological finds in the Great Rift Valley point to the fact that man probably originated here. Thus, Kenya has earned the name, “Cradle of Mankind.”\n\nThe earliest people to populate Kenya were possibly Cushitic-speaking tribes that arrived here from Ethiopia in 2000 B.C. As more tribes continued to arrive from different parts of Africa, the land witnessed much strife between them. It was not until the 900’s that Arab merchants settled here, setting up trading posts. They not only introduced Islam to the natives but over the next eight centuries, these traders assimilated into the native world by intermarrying with them.\n\nThe European advent in Africa began with the 1498 arrival of Vasco Da Gama in Mombasa. But by the onset of the 18th century, the Arabs had managed to drive out the first Portuguese settlers. Soon Christian missionaries and other explorers drawn by the country’s natural treasures began to arrive and slowly, the British began to make their presence felt.\n\nIn the year, 1884 to 1885, the Congress of Berlin spilt Africa among the different European countries and Kenya became a part of the British Empire. They built the Uganda Railway to connect Uganda to the coastal ports, and soon the region was flooded with Britishers looking to tap the country’s commercial possibilities. They pushed the natives into living in specific areas, and those that resisted were simply overcome by their more advanced military capabilities.\n\nThe early 20th century saw a Kenya struggling under economic slavery until the first revolutionary, Harry Thuku, began an unsuccessful revolt in the 1920’s. Kenya’s freedom struggle began with Jomo Kenyatta, who became the president of the independence organization, Kenya African Union in 1944. And thus began a movement that was bloody at times with both British and Kenyans losing their lives. With diplomatic support and sheer resistance, Kenya finally achieved independence in 1963 and Kenyatta was elected the first President in 1964.\n\nMost of Kenya’s land resources are under the control of the native government but in the years beginning from the 1990’s, the colonial government had been selling it to private and commercial investors. Under British rule, Kenyans were only allowed to grow food in the least fertile sections of farmlands. After independence, these farmers took over the land and formed small farm holdings or shambas.\n\nToday, Kenya’s economy is largely based on agriculture and makes up a third of its total domestic product. Many cash crops are produced here such as coffee, tea, cashew nuts and various grains, and the country processes them for sale in both domestic and global markets in Europe, Asia, America, Middle East and Australia. Kenyan farms also produce corn, fruits, vegetables and flowers that find their way into urban and international markets, and sold along with handcrafted goods and other items.\n\nKenya also has many manufacturing plants that produce a wide range of goods like chemicals, steel, paper, rubber, furniture, plastic goods, cement and many others. Petroleum products, vehicles, iron, steel, machinery and other such items feature in Kenya’s imports that come from the Americas, Europe and Asia. Besides agriculture, tourism travel plays a vital part in contributing to Kenya’s international currency reserves and the creation of local jobs.\n\nKenya has a number of terrestrial and marine wildlife reserves and parks that are a major attraction for tourists from all over the world. These vacationers also contribute by shopping for the Akamba handicrafts that Kenya is so famous for. The tourism sector employs millions of Kenyans directly and indirectly.\n\nMost common Kenyans work on a daily wage basis in industries such as construction, small crafts and mechanics. But the government and service sector as well as other industries also employ permanent workers. The mining industry is another source of income and employment for Kenyans. Most mining facilities are owned by international agencies; though, this is changing now.\n\nThe country has another very valuable resource, that of Kilindini Port in Mombasa that serves as a central harbor for importing and exporting goods to many inland countries like Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. The port is linked to the other countries through a network of roads and railway lines.\n\nFormerly under British rule, Kenya achieved independence on December 12, 1963, and Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, a highly revered, central figure of the freedom struggle became the first president after a nine year colonial-resistant imprisonment. Kenya also instituted a Constitution, and the political framework of the country works according to it. In August 2010, the country adopted a new Constitution and the general elections held in the year 2013 were conducted in accordance with its new regulations.\n\nThe Republic of Kenya is a unified country and democracy. Its National Assembly and Senate has careful representation from the people in every sector of Kenya’s population. The make-up of the members of the two houses has been outlined by the different articles of the Constitution. Kenya’s Senate comprises of 67 members aside from the Speaker, and the Constitution mandates that women, youth and disabled persons should also be represented in it. The National Assembly has 349 members excluding the Speaker, and all of these members are elected by the people from the different constituencies.\n\nWomen are also represented in the mandatory 47 members; while other sections of society like the youth of the country, people that are physically challenged and workers have representation in the 12 members elected to the National Assembly. Members of the National Assembly are called Members of Parliament or MPs while the members of the Kenyan Senate are called Senators. Each member holds post for a period of 5 years as does the President.\n\nAll general elections in Kenya such as the parliamentary, presidential and local are held once every 5 years in a fair and open environment, but questions on unfair play are always present. The President of Kenya, the Deputy President and the Cabinet Secretaries make up the executive section of the government. Though, the Cabinet Secretaries are not members of the National Assembly, and the President appoints only those personnel that the Assembly approves of.\n\nThe President is chosen in a direct election and needs more than 50% votes and an added 25% in half of the 47 counties of the country. After President Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya has had two other presidents -- Daniel Arap Moi and Mwai Kibaki, who served for two terms. In the March 2013 election, Uhuru Kenyatta got elected, the son of the first president of Kenya.\n\nYou can access Kenya from any part of the world by way of flights to Nairobi or Mombasa or even on a cruise ship that dock on the island of Mombasa. Since many international flights cater to global travelers, you could find varied options from Europe, America, Asia, Middle East and Australia. Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in the south of Nairobi is Kenya’s main hub.\n\nMoi International Airport in Mombasa is an alternate airport but this base is used more for domestic and chartered flights with beach holidayers and also for flying in and out of Zanzibar and other regional areas within East Africa. Advantageously, few international airlines like Turkish, Qatar, Ethiopian are now using the secondary Mombasa base to offer lower cost flights to Kenya.\n\nThe “Pride of Africa”, Kenya Airways, provides domestic, regional and international travel from Nairobi and Mombasa. Wilson Airport in Nairobi is the base for domestic and safari park flights but also serves few regional destination airlines within East Africa. Using Wilson Airport as a base, you can book scheduled or charter flights to reach the main lodges and camps in the many reserves and parks in Kenya.\n\nLightweight aircraft with either single, twin or four engines that can carry 3 to 50 passengers are available via AfricanMecca, and these planes can land on the private airstrips closest to your safari accommodation. Upon landing, your guides will meet and transfer you to your camp or lodge for check-in. If you would like to travel to Masai Mara, Amboseli, Samburu, Laikipia, Meru and other wilderness park destinations within Kenya or East Africa, it is most convenient and cheaper to fly from Nairobi Wilson.\n\nIf you would like to travel to Masai Mara, Amboseli, Samburu, Laikipia, Meru and other wilderness park destinations within Kenya or East Africa, it is most convenient and cheaper to fly from Nairobi Wilson. Destinations like Masai Mara and Amboseli are also accessible from Mombasa but with high flight costs due to the distance and lack of competition. You have the option of taking the train, and there are services that operate between Nairobi and Mombasa on fixed days and are usually overnight trips.\n\nAlthough, Kenya has a network of 1284 miles (2066 kilometers) of railway tracks, the operation service is dismal, and you are likely to experience delays, cancelled trains with inadequate accident insurance coverage for travelers. The cabins and customer services are of deprived standards. Buses connect the main towns of Kenya and most common Kenyans prefer to use them, but you also have the option of travelling by heavy duty safari vehicles like Range Rovers, Jeeps, Land Cruisers and other 4 Wheel Drives.\n\nDriving yourself is also an option but only recommended if you have experience driving in the East African environs since high traffic and road accidents in Kenya are prevalent. If you intend to do so knowing the risk, you need a license issued by the Kenya Road Transport Office that is valid for three months for visitors. Or you could get an International Driving License before arriving in Kenya. Do remember, though, that Kenyans drive on the left of the road and the speed limit for a public service vehicle is 50 mph (80 kph) on highways and 18 to 30 mph (30-50 kph) in built-up areas, towns and other city areas.\n\nIf you are traveling to Kenya with AfricanMecca Safaris, you will experience our superb meet and greet service on arrival at the airport, complemented with hotel transfers to and from the airport. Our representative will help you with your baggage; and if you have planned a safari and are headed to a park or reserve, we will introduce you to your guide that will be leading you to your wilderness destination.\n\nAt your accommodation, their porters will assist you with baggage drop-off service to your room. It is recommended that you carry a maximum of 15 kg or 33 pounds of baggage per passenger since that is the weight allowance on safari aircrafts and climbing expeditions. If you are using an accommodation in Nairobi or Mombasa as a base, you can request that they store your excess luggage at their front desk while you tour the parks, reserves or go mountain climbing. We can also safeguard it for you at one of our in-country team offices. Only make sure your baggage is securely locked before you give it in for storage.\n\nWhen touring Kenya, you will only need to take common-sense safety measures that you would take when visiting any other country the world. Keep careful watch on your belongings like cameras, purses, wallets and baggage when moving through crowded spaces.

This is a result of the institution of the multi-party political structure in Kenyan policymaking and the globalization of media. The radio always has been the main source of information for the locals in both urban and rural areas, and on your vacation in Kenya, you will be able to tune into local and global radio channels such as the BBC and Voice of America as well as over 80 FM stations that include channels in local languages but also English.\n\nMost channels are aired by companies such as the Nation Media Group and Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. Cities like Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa receive complete coverage of the BBC World Service.\n\nTelevision services are widely available in the urban towns and cities, and as yet, the issues with the availability of electricity had hampered access to television viewing in rural areas. However, this situation is also changing as digital TV is now being instituted. You can have access to South Africa's MultiChoice and Zuku TV. The Nation and Standard are the two primary newspaper companies while the Coastweek in Mombasa traditionally releases its newspaper every Friday.

Enjoy the pride with which every craftsman displays his wares, and above all, revel in the fascinating art of bargaining while vacationing in this buzzing region of Africa.\n\nBargaining is an expected and accepted part of the Kenyan shopping experience where most vendors are likely to quote a higher price. They expect you will haggle and settle at a lesser original asking price, sometimes even half. While you enjoy the feeling of a good deal, do respect the time and effort the craftsman must have put into the fabulous creation in front of you, and if you can afford it, pay slightly higher than the final negotiated price. You could also browse through the various small stores during your city day tours.\n\nSome of the stores are supplied the handicrafts by cooperatives, but there are also high-profile malls and shopping complexes where you can pick out ultra-distinct, top-notch quality products. Do remember though that products made from game trophies are illegal in Kenya so if you are offered one of those, they are probably imitations made from plastic and domestic animal produce.\n\nThe country's official currency is the Kenyan Shilling (KES or KSHS), and one shilling comprises of 100 cents. You can find currency notes of the denominations 100, 200, 500 and 1,000.

Typically, banks work from Monday through Friday between 9:00 in the morning and 3:00 in the afternoon. Few bank branches also operate on Saturdays.
