        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nTrade centers such as Mombasa have existed along the Kenyan and Tanzanian coastlines, known as the Land of Zanj, since at least the 2nd century. These centers traded with the outside world, including China, India, Indonesia, the Middle East, North Africa, and Persia. By around the 9th century, the mix of Africans, Arabs, and Persians who lived and traded there became known as Swahili (\"people of the coast\") with a distinct language (KiSwahili) and culture. The Portuguese arrived in the 1490s and, using Mombasa as a base, sought to monopolize trade in the Indian Ocean. The Portuguese were pushed out in the late 1600s by the combined forces of Oman and Pate, an island off the coast. In 1890, Germany and the UK divided up the region, with the UK taking the north and the Germans the south, including present-day Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. In 1895, the British established the East Africa Protectorate, which in 1920 was converted into a colony, and named Kenya after its highest mountain. Numerous political disputes between the colony and the UK led to the violent Mau Mau Uprising, which began in 1952, and the eventual declaration of independence in 1963.\n\nJomo KENYATTA, the founding president and an icon of the liberation struggle, led Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when Vice President Daniel Arap MOI took power in a constitutional succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969 until 1982, after which time the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) changed the constitution to make itself the sole legal political party. MOI gave in to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in 1991, but the ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and fraud. MOI stepped down in 2002 after fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA, the son of the founding president, and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption platform.Â\n\nOpposition candidate Raila ODINGA challenged KIBAKI's reelection in 2007 on the grounds of widespread vote rigging, leading to two months of ethnic violence that caused more than 1,100 deaths and displaced hundreds of thousands. African Union-sponsored mediation resulted in a power-sharing accord that brought ODINGA into the government as prime minister and outlined a reform agenda. In 2010, Kenyans overwhelmingly voted to adopt a new constitution that eliminated the prime minister, introduced additional checks and balances to executive power, and devolved power and resources to 47 newly created counties. Uhuru KENYATTA won the first presidential election under the new constitution in 2013. He won a second and final term in office in 2017 after a contentious repeat election. In 2022, William RUTO won a close presidential election; he assumed the office the following month after the Kenyan Supreme Court upheld the victory.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nEastern Africa, bordering the Indian Ocean, between Somalia and Tanzania\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n1 00 N, 38 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 580,367 sq km\n\nland: 569,140 sq km\n\nwater: 11,227 sq km\n\ncomparison ranking : total 51\n\nArea - comparative\n\nfive times the size of Ohio; slightly more than twice the size of Nevada\n\nArea comparison map :\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 3,457 km\n\nborder countries (5): Ethiopia 867 km; Somalia 684 km; South Sudan 317 km; Tanzania 775 km; Uganda 814 km\n\nCoastline\n\n536 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\n\nClimate\n\nvaries from tropical along coast to arid in interior\n\nTerrain\n\nlow plains rise to central highlands bisected by Great Rift Valley; fertile plateau in west\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Mount Kenya 5,199 m\n\nlowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m\n\nmean elevation: 762 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nlimestone, soda ash, salt, gemstones, fluorspar, zinc, diatomite, gypsum, wildlife, hydropower\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 48.1% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 9.8% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0.9% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 37.4% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 6.1% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 45.8% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n1,030 sq km (2012)\n\nMajor lakes (area sq km)\n\nfresh water lake(s): Lake Victoria (shared with Tanzania and Uganda) - 62,940 sq km\n\nsalt water lake(s): Lake Turkana (shared with Ethiopia) - 6,400 sq km\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nAtlantic Ocean drainage: (Mediterranean Sea) Nile (3,254,853 sq km)\n\nMajor aquifers\n\nOgaden-Juba Basin\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation heavily concentrated in the west along the shore of Lake Victoria; other areas of high density include the capital of Nairobi, and in the southeast along the Indian Ocean coast as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\nrecurring drought; flooding during rainy seasons\n\nvolcanism: limited volcanic activity; the Barrier (1,032 m) last erupted in 1921; South Island is the only other historically active volcano\n\nGeography - note\n\nthe Kenyan Highlands comprise one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa; glaciers are found on Mount Kenya, Africa's second highest peak; unique physiography supports abundant and varied wildlife of scientific and economic value; Lake Victoria, the world's largest tropical lake and the second largest fresh water lake, is shared among three countries: Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\ntotal: 58,246,378\n\nmale: 29,091,800\n\nfemale: 29,154,578 (2024 est.)\n\ncomparison rankings : female 26; male 26; total 26\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Kenyan(s)\n\nadjective: Kenyan\n\nEthnic groups\n\nKikuyu 17.1%, Luhya 14.3%, Kalenjin 13.4%, Luo 10.7%, Kamba 9.8%, Somali 5.8%, Kisii 5.7%, Mijikenda 5.2%, Meru 4.2%, Maasai 2.5%, Turkana 2.1%,Â non-Kenyan 1%, other 8.2% (2019 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish (official), Kiswahili (official), numerous indigenous languages\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nThe World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.

Almost 40% of Kenyans are under the age of 15 as of 2020 because of sustained high fertility, early marriage and childbearing, and an unmet need for family planning. Kenyaâs persistent rapid population growth strains the labor market, social services, arable land, and natural resources. Although Kenya in 1967 was the first Sub-Saharan country to launch a nationwide family planning program, progress in reducing the birth rate has largely stalled since the late 1990s, when the government decreased its support for family planning to focus on the HIV epidemic. Government commitment and international technical support spurred Kenyan contraceptive use, decreasing the fertility rate (children per woman) from about 8 in the late 1970s to less than 5 children twenty years later, but it has plateaued at about 3 children as of 2022.\n\nKenya is a source of emigrants and a host country for refugees. In the 1960s and 1970s, Kenyans pursued higher education in the UK because of colonial ties, but as British immigration rules tightened, the US, the then Soviet Union, and Canada became attractive study destinations. Kenyaâs stagnant economy and political problems during the 1980s and 1990s led to an outpouring of Kenyan students and professionals seeking permanent opportunities in the West and southern Africa. Nevertheless, Kenyaâs relative stability since its independence in 1963 has attracted hundreds of thousands of refugees escaping violent conflicts in neighboring countries; Kenya was sheltering nearly 280,000 Somali refugees as of 2022.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 35.8% (male 10,464,384/female 10,366,997)\n\n15-64 years: 60.9% (male 17,731,068/female 17,723,012)\n\n65 years and over: 3.4% (2024 est.)

this means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an âinfectedâ person who received oral polio vaccine; the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n7.1% (2016)\n\ncomparison ranking : 161\n\nAlcohol consumption per capita\n\ntotal: 1.68 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nbeer: 0.81 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nwine: 0.04 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nspirits: 0.81 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nother alcohols: 0.03 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 134\n\nTobacco use\n\ntotal: 11.1% (2020 est.)\n\nmale: 19.5% (2020 est.)\n\nfemale: 2.7% (2020 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 129\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n10.1% (2022)\n\ncomparison ranking : 56\n\nCurrently married women (ages 15-49)\n\n56.8% (2023 est.)\n\nEducation expenditures\n\n4.8% of GDP (2021 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : 83\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 82.6%\n\nmale: 85.5%\n\nfemale: 79.8% (2021)\n\nEnvironment\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nwater pollution from urban and industrial wastes;
