It is located in the suburb of Embakasi, approximately 9.3 miles (15km) from Nairobi’s central business district, and welcomes more than five million passengers each year.\n\nFlights to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport arrive from airports in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the UK, in addition to Madagascar, Mauritius and the Seychelles.\n\nComprising three units that serve arrivals and departures, the airport is undergoing a major expansion project which is set to quadruple its handling capacity. Passengers are urged to be patient until construction and renovations are complete.\n\nThe airport is highly accessible due to its close proximity to the adjacent Mombasa Highway and public transport options include taxis and buses. There are also plans to build a railway link. Facilities and restaurants at Jomo Kenyatta International are limited, but once expansions are finalised these too should improve.\n\nTerminal Transfer\n\nTerminals 1 and 2 are used for international flights while Terminal 3 is used for domestic flights.

Enquiries regarding lost luggage may be lodged at one of the information desks.\n\nConference and business: Besides services offered by the VIP lounges, there are no conference facilities at the airport.
