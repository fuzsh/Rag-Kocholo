Seasonal flooding and mudslides can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.\n\nIf you reside in or are travelling to affected areas:\n\nexercise caution\n\nmonitor local news and weather reports\n\nfollow the advice of local authorities\n\nVolcanoes and earthquakes\n\nNatural disasters are possible due to regional volcanic and seismic activity. While there have not been any recent incidents, pay careful attention to all warnings issued."
