Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) is an international airport serving Nairobi, the capital of and largest city in Kenya.

Located in the Embakasi suburb (18 km/11 mi) southeast of Nairobi's central business district, JKIA has scheduled flights to destinations in over 50 countries.

Originally named Embakasi Airport, the airport was renamed in 1978 after Mr Jomo Kenyatta, the country’s very first Prime Minister (1963-1964) who went on to become the first President of Independent Kenya (1964-1978).

In 2019 the airport served over 7 million passengers, which ranked it the 7th busiest airport on the continent of Africa at the time.

TOA’s EN-54 Certified SX-2000 Digital Voice Alarm / Public Address System and the TOA N-8000 IP Intercom System were installed at JKIA, which met the requirements of the airport for nearly 10 years.

Later, the airport was enlarged, and a new Terminal added to the airport, which required an expansion of the existing TOA Voice Alarm / Public Address System.

Magfre Enterprises Limited, certified TOA System Integrators under the management of Mr Fredrick Murathe (Managing Director), was appointed to supply and install the additional TOA equipment that was required for the new terminal which included the fire station and integration of the system with the Fire Detection System (FDS) at JKIA.

In addition to the SX-2000, JKIA utilises a wide range of TOA products including the SR-H2S Slimline Array Speakers, PC-1860EN Fire Rated Ceiling Speakers, BS-678BSB Fire Rated Cabinet Speakers, AN-9001 Ambient Noise Microphones and the DP-L2 Ambient Noise Controller.

TOA is proud of its long association with Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Magfre Enterprises Limited.
