Mzee Jomo Kenyatta served as Kenya's inaugural president, holding office until his passing on August 22, 1978, due to a heart attack. His final resting place is the Mausoleum, located in close proximity to the Parliament building. This site is under constant surveillance, and visitors are strictly prohibited from taking photographs.

Mzee Jomo Kenyatta's mausoleum is an architectural gem that is rarely accessible to the general public. If one is fortunate, they may have the opportunity to view the mausoleum during the annual commemoration of Mzee Kenyatta's death, which takes place every August 22.

The compound is impeccably maintained, featuring well-kept pavements and 22 evenly spaced flags - 11 on each side. To enter, visitors pass through a sturdy black gate made of metal grills and stroll past a bougainvillea hedge without flowers, five small palm trees to the left, and two more on the right.

The management and upkeep of the mausoleum fall under the jurisdiction of the Parliament. Since Mzee Kenyatta's demise, it has been safeguarded by soldiers from the Kenya Defence Forces. Jeremiah Nyegenye, the Senate's clerk, explains, "The mausoleum is protected to prevent any acts of desecration."
