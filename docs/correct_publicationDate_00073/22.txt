Idle, Eric

Entry updated 12 September 2022. Tagged: Author.

(1943- ) UK comedian, composer, actor, and author of a wide range of comic material, from skits for the famous UK Television series Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969-1974) to the book and libretto for the play Monty Python's Spamalot (2005), and of two novels, the second of which, The Road to Mars: A Post-Modern Novel (1999), is sf featuring an Android scholar in the employ of two twenty-second century comedians working the interplanetary vaudeville circuit known as the Road to Mars. The android's attempts to write a thesis on comedy, which its literal mind cannot comprehend, generates the Humour; the plot itself spirals into a spoof on terrorism. [JC]
