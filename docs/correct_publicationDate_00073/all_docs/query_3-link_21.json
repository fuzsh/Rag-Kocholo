        "text": "Coming of age as a writer and comedian during the Sixties and Seventies, Eric stumbled into the crossroads of the cultural revolution and found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of George Harrison, David Bowie, and Robin Williams, all of whom became dear lifelong friends.\n\nWith anecdotes sprinkled throughout involving other close friends and luminaries such as Mike Nichols, Mick Jagger, Steve Martin, Paul Simon, Lorne Michaels, and many more, as well as John Cleese and the Pythons themselves, Eric captures a time of tremendous creative output with equal parts hilarity and heart.\n\n'George Harrison once said to me, \"If we'd known we were going to be The Beatles we would have tried harder.\" I think the same could be said of Monty Python... Who decides these things? The gods of television, or a little old lady in a cottage near Luton? Well, obviously the latter, but she's very hard to find.' - Eric Idle\n\nIn Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, named for the song he wrote for Life of Brian and which has since become the number one song played at funerals in the UK, he shares the highlights of his life and career with the kind of offbeat humour that has delighted audiences for five decades."
