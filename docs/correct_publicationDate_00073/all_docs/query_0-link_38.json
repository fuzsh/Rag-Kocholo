        "text": "September 19, 1999\n\nBy GARY KAMIYA\n\nTHE ROAD TO MARS\n\nA Post-Modem Novel.\n\nBy Eric Idle.\n\nPantheon, $24.\n\nt's ironic that one of the central characters in Eric Idle's new novel is a robot who has written a dissertation on the nature of comedy. As lovers of the legendary British comedy troupe Monty Python's Flying Circus can attest, Idle is one of the least robotic men ever to wield the unspeakable power of the Comfy Chair, an inspired buffoon whose prissy, leering face and lunatic antics helped drive some of the best comedy of the past three decades. Yet in print he clanks dutifully along like a humanoid who needs a battery recharge. It isn't that Idle isn't smart. ''The Road to Mars,'' an offbeat futuristic thriller- comedy about the misadventures of two small-time comedians and their faithful robot on an interplanetary Catskill circuit, is filled with intelligent observations about comedy and comedians, and enough one-liners to keep a funnyman in gigs past Pluto. And Idle handles plot competently, even displaying some genuine narrative quirkiness. But the whole of the book is less than the sum of its parts: it's neither funny enough to take off as a comic novel nor meaty enough to be particularly provocative. In what may be an occupational hazard for actors turned novelists, this consummate showman doesn't perform as a writer. His terse prose lacks the robust, cunning, luxurious stupidity that comedy needs. (Does he respect the literary medium too much? Big mistake.) You want to laugh more than you actually do: his riffs feel detached, observed rather than realized. ''The Road to Mars'' has its merits, but it reads more like a script than a novel -- and if Idle's in the movie, it'll probably be hilarious."
