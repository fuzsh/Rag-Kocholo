        "text": "Condition: Fine. 'I still feel somewhat nervous encroaching on the Palin territory of writing a travel diary based on a journey. thought it is true, I reason, that all the Pythons have been involved in documentaries. So this must be a Python thing. What is this urge to probe and examine by ex-comedians? Are they tired of dressing up as women? Surely not.' - Eric Idle The man who brought you the anthems 'Always look on the bright side of life' and 'Sit on my Face and Tell me That You Love Me' shows his naughty bits - and much more! As he crossed the US on The Greedy Bastard Tour, Eric Idle kept a diary on the Monty Python website updating fans with his experiences, insights and observations. Inspired by those blogs, THE GREEDY BASTARD DIARY is an honest, hysterical and moving book - part travelogue, part memoir - that chronicles those 80 days on the road, offering Idle's thoughts on his career, personal life and the country he now calls his home. Reflective, ironic, and stamped with his renowned wit, this illuminating work takes readers on a personal tour with the legendary star and offers an intimate, close-up look inside the man as never before.\n\nPaperback. Condition: Very Good. Since the first episode of the television series was broadcast on BBC One on October 5 1969 Monty Python have gone on to become perhaps the best-loved and most influential comedy troupe in television history. After four series, five films and countless live performances, the Pythons have become global comedic legends with an adoring, cross-generational fan base and a list of sketches that have passed into comedic folklore. The first new book by all the surviving Pythons in thirty years, Monty Python Live! is a treasure trove of original scripts, personal photos from the live shows and illustrations from Terry Gilliam as well as new material from John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. Timed to coincide with the fortieth anniversary of their television debut, the book also includes never-before-seen archival material that gives a very personal and fascinating insight into the Pythons and the time they shared on the road. Presented as a glorious, full-colour hardback bursting with original material as well as classic memorabilia (dead parrot not included) Monty Python Live! is an essential addition to any Python fan's collection.
