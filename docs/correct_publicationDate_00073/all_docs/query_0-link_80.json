        "text": "Monty Python's Life of Brian — a biblical satire — is being re-released in theatres, 25 years after its first release. We feature archive interviews with four of the players from Monty Python's Flying Circus, starting with Graham Chapman. He was the straight man in the Monty Python troupe, who would come in and break up the skits. A physician by training, he was a writer and activist for gay rights. He died in 1989. (Rebroadcast from July 2, 1987.)\n\nPalin recreated the journey Jules Verne described in Around the World in 80 Days and turned his journey into a successful eight-part BBC television series. He is, of course, also known for his tenure as a member of Monthy Python and his appearances in The Missionary and A Fish Called Wanda. (Rebroadcast from April 17, 1990.)\n\nPost-Python, Cleese is best known for Fawlty Towers and a number of movies, including his 1988 comedy, A Fish Called Wanda. He's also written a book called Families and How to Survive Them with therapist Robyn Skinner, and he makes training films for corporations. (Rebroadcast from Sept. 22, 1990.)\n\nTim Curry's first movie was the 1975 cult classic The Rocky Horror Picture Show. He turned heads as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a transvestite mad scientist. This week, Curry opens on Broadway in Spamalot, the musical version of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. He plays King Arthur.\n\nActor Hank Azaria stars in the new Showtime series Huff, about an urban psychiatrist with troubles of his own. Azaria does the voices of Apu the convenience store owner, Moe the bartender and Chief Wiggum, among others, on The Simpsons. He directed and starred in the film Nobody's Perfect, and has acted in many other movies, including The Birdcage, Eulogy, and Shattered Glass.\n\nEric Idle was one of the six original members of Monty Python's Flying Circus which, by the way, celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. He wrote many of the songs from the show like, \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\" Since then, Idle has written a number of books. His latest is a comic science-fiction thriller, \"The Road to Mars: A Post-Modem Novel.\" (Pantheon books)"
