The group first appeared together in 1969 in the television series Monty Python's Flying Circus, which regularly featured such offbeat skits as \"Hell's Grannies,\" in which Idle and cohorts play obscene and rowdy old women, and \"The Upper Class Twit of the Year,\" in which aristocratic morons compete on an obstacle course. Among Idle's most memorable roles on the show are leering rogues, obsequious television hosts, and fussy old women. Idle has also undertaken a number of successful solo projects in writing and acting.\n\nMany of the Python troupe's most renowned skits from the Flying Circus's first two seasons, including \"Hell's Grannies\" and the twit contest, have been collected in the film And Now for Something Completely Different. This work contains such celebrated Python material as the \"Dead Parrot\" sketch, in which a pet store proprietor and a customer debate the state of a recently purchased parrot, and \"The Lumberjack Song,\" which begins with a lumberjack boastfully singing the virtues of manly work but ends with him confessing he is a transvestite. Blaine Allen, reviewing the film in Take One, called it \"one of the most hilarious and original movies to come along in a while.\"\n\nAs Monty Python's Flying Circus became increasingly popular, the Pythons began recording and publishing some of their material. Idle edited many of the Python books, including Monty Python's Big Red Book (which has a blue cover) and The Brand New Monty Python Bok, incorporating new and old material with graphics and stills from the series and films. The results provided Python fans with hard copy of their favorite sketches while giving the Pythons themselves enough additional revenue to work independently.\n\nTheir first independent venture was the 1975 movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which follows the legendary King Arthur and his knights on their quest to find the sacred cup of Christ. Idle is particularly memorable as Sir Robin the Not-So-Brave, who wets his armor at the first sign of danger and is accompanied by a troupe of minstrels who sing odes to his cowardice. While \"there are the usual sillies—phrases repeated endlessly, nonsense syllables, and sight gags plentiful enough to warm the cockles of a hitter's heart,\" Richard Goldstein commented in the Village Voice, there is also \"a great deal of gratuitous cruelty, much of it occasioned by the presence of poverty and plague. The film's anger at these occurrences adds dimension to its anarchy, and makes it matter more than the TV show.\"\n\nAfter the last season of Flying Circus was broadcast in 1974, Idle persuaded the BBC to air his program Rutland Weekend Television, a parody of a small independent television station. The show only ran for two seasons, but provided the idea for the \"Rutles,\" a takeoff of the Beatles. With the assistance of Neil Innes, a regular contributor of music to Python projects, Idle constructed a thorough \"re-creation\" of a pop music group's trials and triumphs. After the group appeared with Idle on an episode of Saturday Night Live in 1977, NBC offered Idle the chance to make a Rutles television movie. All You Need Is Cash features cameos by such recording stars as Mick Jagger, Paul Simon, and even former Beatle George Harrison. \"The growth of the ersatz quartet's career and ultimate breakup is followed in a take-off of that you-are-actually-making-history-this-very-moment approach to documentary reporting,\" Village Voice writers Howard Smith and Leslie Harlib noted. The reviewers also found that the program has a \"sneaky power\" to its satire and praise in particular its \"fifteen slyly brilliant parody songs of well-known Beatles tunes.\"\n\nIdle rejoined the Pythons to film Monty Python's Life of Brian, a satire along biblical lines. The title character is a poor fellow who is mistaken for the messiah and spends his life frantically trying to evade his \"followers.\" Notable among the Monty Python members—each of whom portrays numerous characters in the film—is Idle as a nonchalant crucifixion victim who jokes with his executioners and leads his fellow convicts in a sing-along of \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" (a song written by Idle) while dangling from a cross. The film, with its irreverent portrayal of religion and its followers, drew protesters in many places. But \"Jesus isn't singled out for ridicule,\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune observed, explaining that Life of Brian \"is simply the Python response to such pompous pictures as King of Kings.\" The critic added that \"the protests of religious groups against the film, however well-intentioned, are simply missing the point of the picture.\" Many people clearly agreed, since the film proved a success at the box office.\n\nAfter appearing in fellow Python member Graham Chapman's film Yellowbeard, in 1983 Idle and the rest of the Pythons completed another celebrated film, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. There were problems getting the script together, for the group had grown unaccustomed to writing in collaboration. Nevertheless, the difficulties helped to produce a stronger film. As Idle pointed out to George Perry in The Life of Python, the group's self-criticism was essential: \"I think it's the important thing—we do all keep a strong critical eye on what everyone else is doing. It's healthy, and if you're reading scripts out to everyone and something doesn't work, it's better to get that sort of criticism while you're still making the film than when it is out—at least you have a chance to make it better.\"\n\nMonty Python's The Meaning of Life, which was honored at the Cannes Film Festival, is comprised of sketches on topics such as birth, sex, and death. As in the previous films, members of the troupe play several characters, with Idle most striking as he emerges, clad in a pink long-tailed tuxedo, from a refrigerator to disrupt a \"live\" organ transplant by serenading the unwilling donor with facts about the universe. Siskel described the film as \"fresh and original and delightfully offensive,\" while Newsweek reviewer Katrine Ames called it \"the best movie to date from England's satirical sextet.\" The critic further praised the group's humor as \"never … more incisive—they've become savagely hilarious observers of the human condition.\" Time writer Richard Schickel believed that The Meaning of Life overcomes any minor flaws: \"In their assaults on conventional morality, [the Pythons] generate a ferocious and near Swiftian moral gravity of their own,\" the critic concluded. \"It is this quality that distinguishes their humor from the competition, rescues it from its own excesses and makes braving it an exhilarating experience.\"\n\nIdle ha undertaken solo writing projects, as well, since the 1970s. Hello Sailor, published in 1974, is his first novel. Frank Pike, writing in the Times Literary Supplement, described the novel \"as 'rude' and 'silly' as the [Monty Python] detractors would expect.\" In 1976, Idle released The Rutland Dirty Weekend Book. Listener contributor D.A.N. Jones felt that the book was not as funny as it intends to be: \"The Rutland Dirty Weekend Book is based on the television show and has many panto-dame jokes about sex—that is, 'sexy' sexlessness.\" More recently, in 1996 Idle published the children's work The Quite Remarkable Adventures of the Owl and the Pussycat. The book is a mixture of the familiar and the novel; Idle's Monty Python antics infiltrate the classic story in a much more subdued form appropriate for children.\n\nIn another medium, an Amusement Business article by Tim O'Brien regarding Idle's \"3-D Pirates Stranded at Sea World\" revealed what Sea World and Renaissance Entertainment and Creative Services Production stated about the fifteen-minute film written by and featuring Idle and Leslie Nielsen. Eric Miles, corporate manager of production for Busch Entertainment Company and executive producer of the film, said in the article, \"This film is instant magic. The energy between Eric Idle and Leslie Nielsen is amazing.\" The article reports that Jim Timon of Renaissance Entertainment and Creative Services Production and the executive heading the production of this film concurs with Miles: \"Unlike many 3-D films, this one has a progressive plot and is not used strictly to 'wow' viewers with effects.\"\n\nPursuing his solo work again, Idle published The Road to Mars: A Post-Modem Novel in 1999. Gary Kamiya, reviewing the title for the New York Times, commented that Idle's adept physical comedy makes an inadequate comic novel, but recognized the more favorable aspects in the book: \"Idle handles plot competently, even displaying some genuine narrative quirkiness.\" For Kamiya, the basic problem of The Road to Mars is the fact that an actor wrote the book, rather than a writer: \"His terse prose lacks the robust, cunning, luxurious stupidity that comedy needs.\" A reviewer for Publishers Weekly felt the writing was lacking as well: \"The narrative meanders for long stretches with scene after scene whose only point is to set up a weak joke—the sort of thing that works so well as TV farce but when passed off as a novel, is tedious.\" Devon Thomas, writing in the Library Journal, however, had a different view: \"Idle … has written an engaging and amusing work of speculative fiction with fully developed characters, a taut plot, and a thoughtful and entertaining analysis of humor's part in human development. A joy to read; highly recommended.\"\n\nIdle had one of the bigger hits of his solo career with the creation of Monty Python's Spamalot, a Broadway musical adaptation of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The award-winning musical expands the territory of the original film, spoofing not only the King Arthur legends but also the film itself, other Python sketches, and Broadway musicals in general. After Sir Robin (played on Broadway by David Hyde Pierce rather than Idle) insists that \"You Won't Succeed on Broadway (If You Haven't Any Jews),\" the cast takes a detour through Fiddler on the Roof; another song, \"The Song that Goes Like This,\" pokes fun at the formulaic power-ballads of famed Broadway composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. Monty Python's Spamalot also retains many of the most popular bits from the original film, including the Knights Who Say Ni, the hacked-to-bits but still fighting Black Knight, the French Taunter, and the killer rabbit. The result, Don Shewey commented in the Advocate, \"is a frothy frappe of popcultural references that's tastier but no more substantial than the canned slab of processed pork from which it takes its title.\" \"It gives off such irrepressible energy, it's contagious,\" Cathleen McGuigan commented in Newsweek, adding: \"Whether it's actually nutritious—well, who cares?\" At the same time that Monty Python's Spamalot debuted, Idle published The Greedy Bastard Diary: A Comic Tour of America, which recounts a backstage view of one of Idle's comedy tours and also discusses some of the creation of Monty Python's Spamalot. Idle's \"take on Hollywood is refreshingly unjaded\" in the book, noted a Variety reviewer.\n\nDespite his solo success, Idle looks back fondly at his days as a Python. Expressing amazement at the enduring popularity of the group, he told People interviewer Susan Schindehette: \"It's astounding. Here we are … years on, and people are still watching the same silly stuff. They're fascinated by the program.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Volume 21, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1982.\n\nHewison, Robert, Monty Python: The Case Against, Methuen (London, England), 1981.\n\nHewison, Robert, Footlights!, Methuen (London, England), 1983.\n\nJohnson, Kim Howard, The First 200 Years of Monty Python, St. Martin's (New York, NY), 1989.\n\nPerry, George, The Life of Python, Pavilion, 1983.\n\nThompson, John O., editor, Monty Python: Complete and Utter Theory of the Grotesque, University of Illinois Press (Champaign, IL), 1982.\n\nWilmut, Roger, From Fringe to Flying Circus, Methuen (London, England), 1980.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAdvocate, May 10, 2005, Don Shewey, review of Monty Python's Spamalot, p. 67.\n\nAmusement Business, March 17, 1997, Tim O'Brien, \"Eric Idle's 3-D Pirates Stranded at Sea World,\" p. 26.\n\nChicago Tribune, September 21, 1979, Gene Siskel, review of Monty Python's Life of Brian; April 1, 1983, Gene Siskel, review of Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, September 6, 1996, Erin Richter, review of Missing Pieces, p. 84.\n\nLibrary Bookwatch, June, 2005, review of The Greedy Bastard Diary: A Comic Tour of America.\n\nLibrary Journal, August, 1999, Devon Thomas, review of The Road to Mars, p. 139.\n\nListener, December 23, 1976, D.A.N.
