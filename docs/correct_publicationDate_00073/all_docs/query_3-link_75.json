        "text": "A Legend in his own lunchtime, and author of many books, some not half bad, some not even a quarter bad, Eric has finally entered his anecdotage, with the last word in Python memoirs. \"Hopefully,\" says Eric, nothing he is the last of the legendary group to tell his story, live in conversation with Dave Eggers.\n\nComing of age as a writer and comedian during the sixties and seventies, Eric Idle stumbled into the crossroads of the Cultural Revolution and found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of George Harrison, David Bowie, and Robin Williams, all of whom became lifelong friends. He’ll share his remarkable journey live with the best selling novelist and publisher, Dave Eggers, to make for a unique one-of-a-kind entertaining experience.\n\nWith anecdotes sprinkled throughout that involve such close friends and luminaries as Mick Jagger, Steve Martin, Paul Simon, Mike Nichols, and many more—let alone the Pythons themselves—Idle captures a time of tremendous creative output with equal hilarity and heart. In Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, named after the song he wrote for Life of Brian that has since become the number one song played at funerals in the UK, he shares the highlights of his life and career with the offbeat humor that has delighted audiences for five decades.\n\nTratto is one of the newest additions to our neighborhood and boy, are we happy that they moved in!
