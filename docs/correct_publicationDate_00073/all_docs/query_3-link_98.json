        "text": "Eric Idle is, perhaps, best known as a founding member of the iconic comedy troupe Monty Python, and he's continued writing and performing nearly nonstop since those early years. He has appeared in countless films, television, radio and theater productions. He penned the Tony and Grammy Award-winning Broadway hit musical Spamalot, and created the original parody rock band The Rutles. Eric is also the author of several books, including his most recent bestselling Always Look on the Bright Side of Life: A Sortabiography.\n\nAs he looks back on his storied career and as he looks ahead to his first West Coast tour in years, Eric says, “Unfortunately, I can’t find the exit.” Adding glumly, “My role in life seems to be cheering people up.”"
