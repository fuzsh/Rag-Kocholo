        "text": "When you have a tour guide as engaging as Eric Idle, you'll gladly go wherever he takes you. The writer and comedian best known as a member of the British sketch troupe Monty Python has curated an intimate journey of what it was like to be a writer who suddenly found himself a massively famous actor.\n\nIdle, who lives in Los Angeles, doesn't just provide a detailed account of his days with John Cleese, Terry Jones, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam; Idle's relationships with celebrities such as Robin Williams, Mike Nichols and Steve Martin also give readers a nuanced look into talented Americans whose love of what they do enriched Idle's path to stardom."
