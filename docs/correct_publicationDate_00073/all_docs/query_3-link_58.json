        "text": "Highlights from the private library of revered British actor Eric Idle, founding member of the Monty Python comedy troupe, will be on offer at the New York International Antiquarian Book Fair (NYIABF) by johnson rare books & archives. British history, literature, rock and roll, along with humor, comedy and musical theater are just a few of the subjects covered in Idle’s library, accumulated over the nearly three decades he lived in Los Angeles.\n\n“I’m never happier than when reading a book. I read a lot of books. I find books endlessly inspiring,” Idle says, pointing to a shelf of British history he referenced for sketch ideas. Among the books for sale are first editions of Winston Churchill’s four volume A History of the English-Speaking People (1956-58) and Gilbert Abbott à Beckett’s The Comic History of England (1847-48).\n\nAs for the new owners of the books, Idle’s advice is: “Enjoy them. I think books are there to be enjoyed. Read them with pleasure and share your pleasure with other people.” The collection includes books signed by several rock musicians, who Idle counted among his friends, such as George Harrison and Ringo Starr."
