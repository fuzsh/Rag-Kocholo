Former Toronto Raptors players Chris Bosh and Shawn Marion were named on Thursday among eight first-time nominees for induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame for 2020.

Should both players be inducted, they will be only the third and fourth players in Raptors history to be enshrined â€” joining Tracy McGrady (1997-2000) and Hakeem Olajuwon (2001-02). Lenny Wilkens, who coached Toronto from 2000-03, is the only former Raptors coach in the Hall.

The Raptors drafted Bosh, now 35, fourth overall in the 2003 NBA Draft. He played seven seasons in Toronto and earned All-Star honors five times before departing the team for the Miami Heat in 2010 to form the "big three" with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. Basketball-Reference lists Bosh as the second-best player in franchise history, trailing only current point guard Kyle Lowry.

Bosh averaged 20.2 points, 9.4 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game during his time with the Raptors and still holds franchise records for total rebounds (4776) and blocks (600).

Marion, now 41, played 27 games for the Raptors during the 2008-09 season after he was acquired from the Heat in a February 2009 trade. He scored 14.3 points per game and averaged 8.3 rebounds and 1.1 steals during his time with the organization. Before he donned a Raptors uniform, Marion made four NBA All-Star teams while he played for the Phoenix Suns. In total, he played in 16 seasons with five different teams.
