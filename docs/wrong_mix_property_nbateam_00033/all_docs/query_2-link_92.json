        "text": "The Matrix was one of the most versatile players on the court: the first player in NBA history to reach 15k points, 10k rebounds, 1k blocks and 500 3s, able to play almost any position. He's won an NBA Championship (2011, with the Dallas Mavericks), a Bronze Olympic medal (2004, Athens) and is a four-time NBA All-Star. Marion may have retired in 2015, after his Cleveland Cavaliers fell in the Finals to Golden State, but he's still got his pulse on the game.\n\nOn his first ever visit to India, Marion takes part in the Reliance Foundation Jr NBA Programme, inaugurates the ACG NBA JUMP Programme - which recently selected 40 kids for scholarships to the NBA's first ever Basketball Academy in India, opening in early 2017 - and finds the time to attend GQ Fashion Nights.\n\nWhat's the basketball scene like here in India?\n\nThere's so much room for growth. Working with Reliance and ACG has showed me there's talent here: kids are getting a chance to get training that a lot of kids in the US couldn't get. So I'm hoping it takes off.\n\nCan you see a basketball league in India taking off?\n\nIndia's an untapped resource, so it'd be great to get a league down here, whether it's an NBA or Euroleague thing. In a country of, what, 1.4 billion people, I think you can get at least 300-400 million basketball fans.\n\nLet's shift stateside. Who's your team?\n\nI grew up a Bulls fan. I've got a lot of respect for Cleveland, who I was with last. But I like to see them all do well: Phoenix, Miami, Dallas. It's difficult to pick just one team.\n\nIf you had to, though?\n\nIt could be the Cavs or Golden State - they've got the best records in the league right now. But with small ball [style of play] being used a lot these days, it'll get interesting. There may be some difficult match-ups. And with the post-season a long way off, anything can happen.\n\nWho's been killing it this season?\n\nOh, Westbrook's leading the way. He's unbelievable, destroying everyone out on the court.\n\nWhat about up-and-comers?\n\nThere's a lot of them right now. The University of Kansas has had a couple of strong years of classes: You've got Joel Embiid, who's doing amazing things in Philly. There's Andrew Wiggins. The league has gotten so much younger, so we'll see how all these talented players do in the next 3-5 years.\n\nThere's also the first Indian in the NBA.\n\nYeah, the first Indian player [Satnam Singh Bhamara]. The Mavericks took him, and he's in the D-League right now. But, you know, he could get a call up this year. Dallas have had a rough start, they've had a few injuries. If another guard goes down, he could just be called up.\n\nWhat did you think of Fashion Nights?\n\nI loved it. A lot of what the designers made could definitely be sold in the US, and that's great. There was a lot of stuff I'd consider wearing myself - actually, Nikhil [Mehra] made me a shirt to wear that night. But I love Indian fashion - I wore a full outfit the other day and, I have to say, I rocked it."
