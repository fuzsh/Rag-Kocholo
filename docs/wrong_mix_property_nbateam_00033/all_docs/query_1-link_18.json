        "text": "As three more of his contemporaries were chosen for Springfield orange jackets last month, Shawn Marion was left to ponder why he remains eternally overlooked. Marion’s versatility, ahead-of-its-time skill set and contributions on those super fun, ”Seven Seconds or Less” Phoenix Suns squads and the 2011 NBA champion Dallas Mavericks were lost on many.\n\nFolks chose to see what they wanted — or, in his case, didn’t want — to see during his 16-year NBA career. But Marion knew he was more than a catchy nickname with an unorthodox game.\n\n“I left a great imprint on the game and I’m at peace,” Marion said in a recent interview with The Athletic.\n\nMarion has one of the more complex arguments for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He wasn’t an elite scorer. He never made an All-Defensive team (more on that later). And his best moments came as either the second- or third-best member of one of the league’s more fascinating ring-less flirtations. When he finally captured that title, Marion was part of a complementary ensemble cast that helped Dirk Nowitzki shed nearly a decade of unfair and inaccurate criticisms of his heart and competitiveness.\n\nSo, when Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett were all chosen for the exclusive honor that currently eludes him, Marion remains confident that his day will eventually come. Asked what he would do if he ever got the call that he’s headed to the Hall of Fame, Marion offered a corrective retort.\n\n“What would I do, did you say when?” Marion asked. “When?”\n\nMarion then chuckled to himself, because when won’t ever come until a fair examination of his worthiness is followed by a well, actually…\n\nDallas Mavericks Coach Rick Carlisle once called Marion “one of the most underrated players in history.” And that’s not just hyperbole. His career was played in the shadows of other shinier objects — from Jason Kidd to Stephon Marbury to Amaré Stoudemire and Steve Nash in Phoenix, to Nowitzki in Dallas. But those who played alongside him, and especially those who crunched numbers, recognized what Marion did to accentuate and uplift the talent around him.\n\nNeed a slender 6-foot-7 perimeter defender with the gumption to guard four, perhaps five, positions in the same game? A floor runner who can catch lobs with rapid reflexes and step out to hit the occasional 3-pointer? An undersized yet tenacious shot blocker and steal collector? Marion could scratch off those demands and find whatever items on the box sheet that needed filling from game to game.\n\n“I think the legacy I left for the game is there. But who is it to decide? Who is making the decisions? What do they base it off of? If you look at all the numbers, to me, I should be a shoo-in. Should I not?” Marion asked. “What am I supposed to do? What am I not supposed to do? It’s out of my control. I know it’s a political thing. It’s a lot more other stuff going on. But certain things, you earn that. I earned that.”\n\nBasketball-Reference’s Hall of Fame calculator has Marion’s chances of reaching Springfield at 75.6 percent, in the same grouping as Hall of Famers Joe Dumars, Dennis Rodman and Gail Goodrich. Among eligible NBA players who haven’t received a Hall call, Marion’s probability percentage ranks fifth behind Chris Bosh (99.5), Larry Foust (94.2), Chauncey Billups (84.4) and Tim Hardaway (79.2).\n\nMarion is the only player in NBA history with at least 17,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals, 1,000 blocks and 500 three-pointers in his career. He is also one of just two to finish with career averages of at least 15 points, 8.5 rebounds, 1.5 steals and one block. The other? Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nJust four players have ever finished with season averages of at least 19 points, nine rebounds, two steals, 1.5 assists and one block. David Robinson and Charles Barkley both did it once. Olajuwon did it five times. Marion did it four straight seasons from 2002-03 to 2005-06. And with 13 more steals in 2001-02, Marion would’ve matched Olajuwon. He also displayed incredible durability during that stretch by never missing more than three games in any of those seasons.\n\n“I’m a big (reason) why the game is what it is today. And I can walk out of my house and hold my head held high and talk about this game, because I know what I was able to do on this floor. What I was able to do is the model of what everybody is trying to do right now,” said Marion, now a board member of the National Basketball Retired Players Association. “Everybody is trying to find somebody to do everything that I was able to do. Which they ain’t been successful. But they’ve found some bits and pieces to do some stuff.”\n\nMarion chuckled some more. He made four All-Star appearances, including a first that came two years before Nash’s arrival, and made all-NBA twice. But his resume is devoid of any other individual accomplishments. He also led the Suns in wins shares in each of the four seasons that preceded Nash, with a combined total from 2001-04 topped only by Duncan, Garnett, Nowitzki, Shaquille O’Neal, Bryant and Tracy McGrady.\n\nNumbers can be adjusted to make almost any argument work, but Marion also warrants consideration for what is now one of the more slept-on aspects of his do-it-all game. He reluctantly accepted the challenge of playing power forward at a time when the league was overloaded with talents such as Garnett, Duncan, Nowitzki, Rasheed Wallace, Chris Webber and Pau Gasol. He was one of the trash-talking, defensive mavens who helped confuse and fluster LeBron James during his worst NBA Finals performance. But with years of what he believed were disrespectful slights, Marion doesn’t even let an acknowledgment of those accomplishments slide without a challenge.\n\n“You sit there and telling me what I should be known for, giving me credit for, which I respect, but at the same time, where is the real validation from that?” Marion asked. “Think about it, though. I never made an all-defensive team. I never was defensive player of the year, which I should have been, couple years, honestly. Defensive player of the year, possibly, I should’ve been, maybe once or twice in my career. But I didn’t get that. All defensive team? I definitely should’ve been all-defensive team, four or five years, easily. Why is that?”\n\nPlaying for some fast pace, high-scoring teams during a muck-it-up era in which teams were rewarded for milking possessions and keeping point totals low made it harder for Marion to standout as a stalwart on defense. But his peers and opposing coaches recognized, even if it never reached media members who made end-of-the-season award selections. When Michael Jordan famously hit what should’ve been the game-winning turnaround fade-away in his final All-Star Game — before Bryant ruined it — in 2003, Marion had the defensive assignment and forced a tough shot.\n\n“I understand. I’m not knocking, but how do you justify giving Draymond Green, defensive player of the year? Same thing. Different era, same thing. I guarded way more people than he did. It’s easy to play small ball now and guard people. It’s not hard now,” Marion said, adding that he was the ultimate small-ball defender, “when it was really hard. When it was a challenge. When the most dominant position in the league was power forwards and I had to guard those guys. Every night. Tim Duncan. Kevin Garnett. The guys that just got elected into the Hall of Fame. I’m guarding these guys every night.\n\n“How many people actually play defense now?”\n\nGet it. Go. Jason Kidd shared those words to Marion upon his arrival in Phoenix and they would serve as the foundation for his rapid-bounce, playing style. Run the floor hard, aggressively and with purpose, and find yourself on the receiving end of easy baskets off lobs and bounce passes. Marion had the fortune of playing alongside two Hall of Fame point guards in Kidd and Steve Nash and another talent in Stephon Marbury, whose case was perhaps magnified by his success in China. Nash was the only one to win MVP — which occurred his first two seasons with Marion — but Marion carries a special reverence for Kidd.\n\nMarion credits Kidd and Penny Hardaway for teaching him how to be a pro and was disappointed when the Suns dealt Kidd to New Jersey in 2001. Kidd immediately led the Nets to back-to-back Finals appearances, finishing second to O’Neal for MVP honors in his first season in the Eastern Conference. Marion wouldn’t reach the Finals until he was reunited with Kidd in Dallas, where both claimed their only title.\n\n“He was a walking triple-double. His IQ for the game was unbelievable. You don’t get a chance to see it until you actually play with him,” Marion said of Kidd. “I was fortunate enough to re-join forces with J-Kidd in Dallas and was able to get over that mountain and win a championship. We could’ve won one earlier had he stayed in Phoenix. But that’s part of the game and you learn from all this.”\n\nMarbury was a quick, explosive player who had more of a scorers’ mentality but Marion still managed to make his first All-Star appearance playing alongside “an amazing talent” who was criticized for much of his NBA career for being selfish. Nash arrived in free agency in 2004, and, taking advantage of the Mike D’Antoni system he’d already been groomed to play, Marion became a lead character in one of the more entertaining teams of this millennium. With Nash probing and plotting and Stoudemire punishing rims, Marion was the gap-filler who focused on the little things and allowed small ball – or skill ball, as D’Antoni prefers to call it – to thrive. Marion was usually tasked with the toughest defensive assignment. No matter how tall. While he was just 6-feet-7, 225 pounds.\n\n“That don’t even sound right when you say it. If you got any kind of basketball intellect, it don’t even sound right – guarding 6-10, 6-11, 7-foot guys who are 280,” Marion said. “When they told me they was going to go small ball, I wasn’t too excited about it. A power forward was the most dominant position in the league at the time, so I really have to guard these big guys and I’m light. I was not very excited about it but I said, if we could win doing it, I was, Fuck it, let’s go. And then, before you know it. I had to really buy into. I wasn’t a big guy. I had to guard centers as well, but I was able to do it. And I played at such a high level and it helped us prevail.”\n\nThe Suns made it to the Western Conference finals three consecutive years but were undone by Joe Johnson’s facial fracture in 2005, Stoudemire’s knee in 2006 and Robert Horry’s hip check on Steve Nash in 2007. Although the Suns’ style has been imitated throughout the league in the years that have followed, Marion is upset by the misnomer that the first letter in D’Antoni’s name was absent on those teams.\n\nMarion believes their best shot came in 2005 but another factor that begins with the letter “d” — depth — led to their eventual demise. Phoenix was pushed to seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers and L.A. Clippers in 2006 and Marion said that by the time they faced Dallas, “I was wore out. The whole team was drained, because we was on a seven-man rotation. There was no way we was winning a championship with a seven-man rotation in the postseason. There’s no way. We was just done. We was gone. We didn’t have anything left in the tank.\n\n“Everybody starts a narrative and y’all buy into it because it sounds right. So, that’s no, no,” Marion said. “I was in these trenches. I’m telling you from a player standpoint, from a basketball standpoint, of somebody that knows the game and experienced it; you’re only going to go as far as your bench takes you. Look at your history. Ain’t no team won a championship on seven guys.”\n\nMarion would become the scapegoat for those playoff shortcomings, dealt off to Miami in 2008 for O’Neal and a year later to Toronto. After a few months with the Raptors, Marion moved on to Dallas, where he was relegated to a bench role in his second season until Caron Butler sustained a season-ending knee injury. Upon his return to the starting lineup, Marion settled into a role as a designated stopper who helped the Mavericks during a postseason conquest in which they vanquished Bryant and the two-time defending champion Lakers, the Kevin Durant/Russell Westbrook-led Oklahoma City Thunder and the heavily favored Big Three of James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami.\n\n“We knew our window of opportunity wasn’t opening, it was closing,” Marion said of that veteran Mavericks team, which also featured Tyson Chandler and Jason Terry. “Everybody that picked Miami to win it before it started, we was laughing. We thought y’all was full of shit, to be honest with you. We was one of the three or four teams at the time, that going into the season, legitimately had a chance to win a championship. If you didn’t see that, I don’t know what the hell you was looking at. I guess you wasn’t looking at the TV.”\n\nDuring that run, Marion said he and Nowitzki would regularly end practice by playing one-on-one. Teams like the “We Believe” Warriors in 2007 had added to Nowitzki’s postseason agony by putting smaller defenders on the game’s best-ever 7-foot shooter. Those matchups sharpened and prepared them for what they would encounter that postseason. Small ball didn’t work on Dirk. Marion hounded elite scorers. “I won some and he won some,” Marion said of Nowitzki. “It was amazing. Probably one of the best seasons ever because you won a championship. I had some great seasons where I really cared about my teammates and stuff like that but that year, it was something special about it. It was just time. We knew. I wish we had a chance to repeat.”\n\nWhat frustrated Marion most about his career was a perceived fixation on an irrelevant part of his game — his unique shooting form. Marion’s card-dealer release wasn’t textbook but nothing about his game could fit neatly into convention.\n\n“It’s really sad, because everybody used to make a big issue about my shot as certain points of my career. I’m like, ‘Why are you talking about my shot? That’s not important. I make shots. I get buckets,’ ” Marion said. “I was averaging 22 and 12, or something crazy. Like, why are you talking about my shot? Why aren’t you talking about the double-doubles I’m putting up? Why aren’t you talking about I’m leading the league, or second in the league in steals? I’m top five in rebounding? Why is the focus on what I’m doing on the other side of the floor? Why is that the narrative? Or something everybody is talking about. Because nobody’s release is the same. Nobody ever gave me a legit answer.”\n\nTNT analyst Kenny Smith gave Marion the nickname “The Matrix” during his rookie season and it stuck so well that Marion would often use the moniker while referencing himself in third person. Marion’s career has become an ignored glitch in the matrix that is slowly gaining more appreciation with how the NBA has progressed.\n\n“One of the things I’ve come to realize, it’s easy to shy away from the truth or to make something not as obvious as possible, or to overlook something somebody has done,” Marion said. “This is a business. You’re going to push who you’re going to push. People are going to hype who they’re going to hype. The numbers don’t lie. You can sit there and say this, this about certain people, but what do his numbers say? What did his numbers show? How can you overlook it?”\n\nSo, what would Marion do when the Hall calls?\n\n“I’m going to celebrate,” he said. “I live every day like it’s my birthday anyway. I’m going to really celebrate that day.”\n\n(Top photo: Andrew D. Bernstein / NBAE via Getty Images)"
