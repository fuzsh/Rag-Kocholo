        "meta_description": "Long before he was “The Matrix,” Shawn Marion was just a mere mortal, growing up in Waukegan, Illinois, about an hour-and-a-half drive from Chicago. But even though he still has family in Waukegan (and his own place in Chicago), Marion moved around quite a bit before being drafted with the ninth overall pick in 1999. He played his high school basketball in Clarksville, Tennessee and his junior college ball at Vincennes University in Indiana before transferring to UNLV before the 1998-99 season.",
