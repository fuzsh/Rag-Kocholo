        "text": "Even then, whole-body cryotherapy didn’t gain much notoriety until this year, when several Dallas Mavericks — including Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd, Jason Terry and Shawn Marion — used it during their NBA championship run. “It gives you a youthfulness,” Terry told a Dallas TV station, “and if you have any aches and pains, instantly when you step out of that chamber, you’re revived.” After Dallas won the title, Matorin said his company experienced an explosion of interest. He said that by the end of October, 19 offices in the U.S. would have cryosaunas.\n\nAs usual, the event is expected to attract celebrities and athletes. Past attendees have included Lupe Fiasco, Common, Tyrese Gibson, Lauren London, Jamie Hector (who played the memorable Marlo Stanfield on “The Wire”) and the New Orleans Hornets’ Chris Paul and Dallas Mavericks’Shawn Marion. Is Marion invited this year, even though his Mavs defeated Wade’s Heat in the NBA Finals in June? “He’s invited,” Wade said. “He’s a good friend. He’s actually a neighbor of mine. Even though he won the championship, that doesn’t take away from our friendship.”\n\nDallas Mavericks star Shawn Marion isn’t taking any chances with the NBA lockout — in fact, he just turned down “Dancing with the Stars” … to make sure he’s free to practice with his team this fall. Sources close to Shawn tell TMZ, “Dancing” sent him an official offer to appear on the show, but the NBA champ wants to make sure he’s 100% available in case the lockout ends early … so it’s a no go. “Dancing” would end in November and NBA season usually starts in October — which could put Marion in a difficult position if the upcoming season isn’t put on ice.\n\nDallas Mavericks star Shawn Marion isn’t taking any chances with the NBA lockout — in fact, he just turned down “Dancing with the Stars” … to make sure he’s free to practice with his team this fall.

Have you updated the car collection since the Finals? What are you driving around in now? Brian Cardinal: (laughs) Am I car a person? Hell, I just got a little Infiniti 35 X, or whatever the hell it’s called — no I’m not a car person. Dime: What about on the Mavericks, who’s got the nicest cars? Brian Cardinal: Oh, Shawn Marion. He’ll love me for saying that too. Shawn Marion’s got the best car collection hands down.\n\nThe website for AMS Pictures recently published a story announcing the idea of a Terry-based reality show called “Homecourt Advantage.” A statement on the site stated: “Set in the glitzy world of NBA basketball star Jason Terry, this is a comical, never before-seen look at his off-court life with high school sweetheart wife, four young daughters, crazy mom and pimp dad.” Two months ago, it was reported that when the NBA Finals concluded, Shawn Marion would be working on a similar show called “The Ladies in My Life.” “It’s just me, predicated about my life, about my mother, my sisters and me being single,” Marion said in May. “And how I help single mothers. My foundation is for single mothers. It’s a little bit of everybody.”"
