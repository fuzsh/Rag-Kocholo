        "text": "TORONTO – Josh Smith had 25 points and seven rebounds as the Atlanta Hawks used 11-for-22 shooting from three-point range to down the Toronto Raptors 118-110 at Air Canada Centre on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Hawks (44-34), who have a tenuous grip on the highly coveted No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference, also got 25 points from Joe Johnson and 17 from Maurice Evans. Mike Bibby added 13 points and 10 assists, while Al Halford chipped in 15 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nChris Bosh, with 21 points and 10 rebounds, recorded his eighth consecutive double-double for the Raptors, who lost their second in a row after winning six straight.\n\nIt was Bosh’s 40th double-double of the season.\n\nShawn Marion had 18 points and six rebounds, Jose Calderon had 16 points and 13 assists and Andrea Bargnani had 15 points for the Raptors (30-47).\n\nA Smith block on Bargnani that led to an Evans dunk, put the Hawks up 107-100 with 4:46 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nHalford then stole the ball from Calderon to set up a three-pointer by Johnson with 2:57 remaining put the Hawks up 112-102, to effectively sink the Raptors’ hopes.\n\nQuincy Douby, who came off the bench to lead all Raptors’ reserves, had nine points in just eight minutes of floor.\n\nThe Hawks went on a 14-8 run to begin the third quarter, erasing the Raptors lead and going up 67-65 at 6:05 before a Toronto timeout.\n\nThe Raptors trailed 85-84 going into the fourth after Smith hit a three-pointer to put the Hawks in the lead.\n\nBosh, who was a workhorse on the boards in the first quarter with seven rebounds, put in a monster dunk to give the Raptors a 31-26 lead at the end of the first.\n\nTwo Calderon steals in the Raptors’ early on turned into four points and also he was 4-for-5 from the floor, including two three-pointers, for 10 points.\n\nThe Raptors, who need at least three wins out of their next five games to avoid a 50-loss season for the first time since 2005, now go on the road to play the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday before returning home to take on the Washington Wizards on Friday.\n\nNOTES: Chris Bosh had averaged 26.0 points and 10.7 rebounds and 50.9 per cent shooting (28-for-55) against Atlanta in three games this season coming into Tuesday’s contest As part of the NBA’s Green Week initiatives, the Air Canada Centre dimmed some internal and external lights. As well, Direct Energy donated $100 for every free throw made by the Raptors, with proceeds going to the David Suzuki Foundation … The Raptors had outrebounded its opponents in eight straight contests coming into Tuesday night’s game. Since the all-star break Toronto is averaging 43.5 rebounds per game, compared to 39.0 before the break."
