        "text": "The Toronto Raptors are the only NBA team not located in the United States and Canada shows their support for them.\n\nDuring the postseason, fans show up and show out for their Raptors. With a sold out Scotiabank Arena and an overflow of fans outside the arena at ‘Jurassic Park.’\n\nOne of the most prominent fans in the entire NBA is Raptors Superfan Nav Bhatia. He has been a season ticket holder since Toronto’s inaugural season in 1995.\n\nBhatia is always seen sitting courtside at games cheering on the Raptors. Now, he is writing a book about his life:\n\n“I’m so excited to be able to share my story with the world. When I was growing up in India, I never imagined I’d end up where I am today. My optimism and faith have led me to extraordinary places beyond my wildest dreams. I hope basketball fans love reading all my behind-the-scenes stories from 28 (and counting) years as the Superfan.”\n\nBeing an avid supporter and face of a fanbase must be a surreal feeling. Other NBA teams have their superfans, but Bhatia is like no other.\n\nBhatia is an entrepreneur, philanthropist and motviational speaker from Toronto.\n\nHe runs the Nav Bhatia Superfan Foundation. It’s a foundation that is dedicated to raising money to build basketball camps and courts for kids in Canada and across the globe.\n\nBhatia is the first fan in NBA history to receive an official championship ring and has inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nBhatia has been supprting the Raptors for 28 years and counting with still plenty more years to come. His upcoming memoir The Heart of a Superfan is set to release on Feb. 27, 2024.\n\nScottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam lead Raptors to victory over Bulls\n\nWith Opening Night happening on Oct. 24, the anticipation for the NBA season is growing.\n\nToronto remains undefeated this preseason after beating the Bulls 106-102.\n\nScottie Barnes lead the way with 22 points, 6 rebounds, 4 blocks and 2 steals. Pascal Siakam chipped in 22 points, 5 rebounds and 3 steals."
