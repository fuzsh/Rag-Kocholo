These CHAT Teams, comprised of community leaders and those with experience across all sectors (government, public health, business, education, healthcare, philanthropy, non-profit, faith), help make sense of local health improvement opportunities and co-create innovative solutions for positive change.\n\nAt the heart of CHAT is an event called a “plunge,” a day-long field trip into the heart of the community to learn firsthand from those most affected by the health issue being studied. ThedaCare has conducted more than 35 plunges with the participation of over 2,000 community leaders to learn about the needs of our communities and find proactive ways to be part of the solution."
