        "text": "For those who are big fans of martial arts, listen up, this one’s for you!\n\nThe Toronto Raptors have collaborated with the Bruce Lee Foundation, Mitchell and Ness, and the Canadian Chinese Youth Athletic Association (CCYAA) to launch a new, limited edition apparel collection inspired by iconic martial artist Bruce Lee.\n\n“In many ways, Bruce Lee’s philosophy around teaching martial arts to all parallels CCYAA’s evolved mission to bring everyone together to celebrate Asian culture,” the CCYAA said in an Instagram post.\n\nTo promote the upcoming collaboration, the CCYAA posted a video titled “#EnterTheRaptor,” last week. The title pays tribute to Lee’s 1973 blockbuster Enter the Dragon and celebrates the 50th anniversary of the classic film.\n\nREAD MORE: Simu Liu and Jeremy Lin to host a celebrity basketball game in Toronto\n\nREAD MORE: Want to propose at a Raptors or Blue Jays Game? Here’s how much it costs\n\nOnce fans heard of the new apparel, they were quick to show their excitement.\n\n“Yessss! Can’t wait,” reads one comment on Instagram.\n\n“Yupppp need this,” another user wrote.\n\n“Gotta set the alarm,” another fan said.\n\nIn honour of the new line, notable actors Olivia Cheng and Chelsea Muirhead from the HBO show Warrior will be having a meet and greet at Real Sports, located at Scotiabank Arena, at 6:45 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nWarrior is an action/crime drama based on Lee’s original writings. It takes place in the late 1800s and follows martial arts prodigy Ah Sahm who arrives in San Francisco hoping to reunite with his family but soon becomes a hit man for one of Chinatown’s most notorious crime families.\n\nEarlier this year, the CCYAA hosted an annual celebrity basketball game hosted by Simu Liu and former Raptors guard Jeremy Lin."
