        "text": "New York still has about four weeks to start talks with Shumpert, but the feeling here is that it will be content to let him enter next summer as a restricted free agent. The Knicks are trying to keep their salary commitments at a minimum for the summer of 2015 and 2016, when they hope to be active in free agency. Inking Shumpert to an extension — which can be as long as four years — would eat up cap space for the 2015 and 2016 offseason.\n\nIman Shumpert is entering the fourth and final year of his rookie contract. He is eligible to sign a rookie scale extension between now and Oct. 31. According to league sources, the Knicks haven’t had any contact with Shumpert or his representatives about a possible extension.\n\nIt’s official … NY Knicks star Iman Shumpert’s in a full-on RELATIONSHIP with singer Teyana Taylor — and TMZ Sports has the video proof. There had been rumors the two were hookin’ up, but this week the two set the record straight — hitting up “The Equalizer” premiere together in NYC … with all sorts of PDA. Check out the clip — Iman bristles at the notion that their relationship was fake and solidifies the union by dropping the all important “bae” when referring to Taylor.\n\nSay, hypothetically, everyone in the NBA was capable of making an album. Whose album would you want to hear? Iman Shumpert: Cole Aldrich. I want Cole Aldrich to make an album. I would pay money to hear what he’s got to say. I think if Cole … because I know the type of thought process that Cole has on the NBA game, and how he goes through life. He likes to live life simple and he likes to shut things up, to work. I think that if he worked on music, he has a good and calm mind that he could really put some music together that he wants to hear."
