        "text": "Bookmark It's Just Sports or subscribe to our RSS feed.\n\nDespite a few new faces and Houston decimated by injuries, little should change in the top-heavy Southwest Division except father-time taking its toll on the Mavs and Spurs.\n\nThe Mavs and Spurs have to collapse eventually, don't they? Neither team has had a draft pick infuse energy and youth in the starting lineup since Manu and Josh Howard in 2003. Both teams either don't attract or target youthful free agents, opting instead for the 30-plus \"sure\" things (Dyess and Marion) who peaked years ago. Michael Finley is still playing - unbelievable. Yet each year both teams can be penciled in for 50 wins.\n\nTwo years ago it looked like the Hornets were ready to take over the division but poor signings (Posey), trades that make little financial sense (Chandler for Okafor) and bad contracts (Peja) have left them little flexibilty to compliment Chris Paul's dominance.\n\nAs much as the top three teams in the division are stained with stability, the bottom two generate the drama. Anything I write about the Grizzlies in a couple sentences won't do them justice.\n\ndeserve a 400-page book deal and that might not even be enough to sift through the inevitable chaos on and off the court this year.\n\nThe Rockets, I can handle.\n\nHouston is a team built for a superstar ... only without the superstar himself. Two penetrating point guards (Brooks, Lowry), two athletic defensive stoppers who can shoot the three and defend multiple positions (Ariza and Battier), a guy who can get to the basket at will (Ariza), hustling bigs (Landry and Hayes) and a back to the basket power forward who is good for 10-15 points a game with close to double digit rebounds (Scola).\n\nWith a healthy Yao Ming, they beat the Lakers last year in the second round and are favorites to win it all this year. Without Ming, they are searching for their star. They have cap space next year and from everything I've read about Daryl Morey, he's meticulous and calculated - there must be a plan in place. The Ariza signing is laying the foundation for his real target. My biggest fear is that target being Chris Bosh. The entire roster of slashers is setup for a scoring big man who controls the paint. Ming is perfect but I'm sure Bosh will suffice. I expect the Rockets to suffer this year but be dominant every year after that ... if Morey gets his man, that is.\n\nHow We Did Last Year:\n\nOnly five games separated the first place Spurs and fourth place Hornets last year making each team interchangeable with the other. At least that's my defense of\n\nI got Memphis' last place standing right. That's all that counts.\n\nProjected Standings:\n\n1) San Antonio Spurs:\n\nBy default really. With the additions of McDyess and Ratliff, they actually got older, which means they will try even less in the regular season.\n\n2) New Orleans Hornets:\n\nnot the first time he's had issues with his feet. It takes James Posey till the conference finals to finally get into game shape. Same problem as last year, if Chris Paul doesn't\n\nthey won't win.\n\n3) Dallas Mavericks:\n\nHow long can a mediocre team with only one dangerous player (Dirk) keep winning 50 games? I say no more. This is the year it all falls apart. Catastrophe follows Shawn Marion like a raincloud over his head.\n\n4) Memphis Grizzlies:\n\nAs much as I love Allen Iverson and Zach Randolph as cultural icons, both are seriously going to stunt the growth of the young core - Gasol/Thabeet/Gay/Conley/Mayo. Iverson and Z-Bone are blackholes, once the ball gets in their hands, it rarely comes out.\n\n5) Houston Rockets:\n\nI think they will set the record for most shot-clock violations in a single season. I don't know what the current record is but I can't imagine anyone on this team actually wanting to shoot. Part of me thinks they will surprise but that part also thought Jermaine O'Neal was going to be serviceable on the Raptors last year.\n\nPreviously\n\n:"
