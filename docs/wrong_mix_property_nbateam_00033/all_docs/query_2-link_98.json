        "text": "VINCENNES, Ind. -- Vincennes University great and NBA Hall of Famer Bob McAdoo is truly a Trailblazer -- the NJCAA is celebrating his outstanding contributions and accomplishments with a special honor.\n\nProbably regarded as the best VU player ever, McAdoo was inducted into the inaugural 2021 NJCAA Foundation Hall of Fame class on Thursday.\n\n\"It’s an honor to have been selected to the inaugural 2021 National Junior College Hall of Fame Class,” McAdoo said during his acceptance speech. \"I’m extremely appreciative of my time at Vincennes and to be recognized with this prestigious award. My time in junior college helped me lay the foundation for my hall-of-fame NBA career. The two years I spent at Vincennes not only helped me mature as a student but also prepared me for the biggest stage of NCAA Division I basketball. I won my first national championship at Vincennes University.\"\n\nTodd Franklin, who guided VU to the 2019 NJCAA championship, told the Courier & Press that McAdoo is one of the pillars that the greatness of the Vincennes basketball program is built on.\n\n\"He is arguably the greatest juco player of all time and was one of my favorite players when I was really young,\" Franklin said. \"He was the best player in the world when he was with the Buffalo Braves. He deserves the honor of being in the first class inducted into the NJCAA foundation hall of fame.\"\n\nMore: Franklin guides Vincennes basketball to record ninth consecutive trip to NJCAA tournament\n\nMore: Vincennes University honoring alum, NBA champion Shawn Marion\n\nMcAdoo is basketball royalty\n\nHe was enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Memorial Hall of Fame in 2000 following an illustrious 14-year NBA career. In 1984, McAdoo was inducted into the NJCAA Men's Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame.\n\nConsidered one of the game’s best shooting big men of all time, McAdoo played for VU from 1969 to 1971 and finished with 1,202 career points. His 27 points in the title game led the Trailblazers to their second NJCAA Division I men’s basketball championship in 1970. He was named an NJCAA All-American in 1971.\n\n\"During my freshman year, we won the national championship in Hutchinson, Kansas,” McAdoo said. \"It was a big deal for me and my teammates because it opened up a world of recruiting opportunities for me and my teammates. It was a big thrill for me because it marked the first time in my life playing in front of a packed arena of that size in Hutchinson. My teammates and I started receiving offers from prestigious Division I university programs, and I personally was invited to try out for the World Games and the Pan American Games where I was selected as a participant.\"\n\nVU athletics director and Hall of Fame women’s basketball coach Harry Meeks grew up not far from McAdoo’s hometown of Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\n\"Being a kid whose whole life has revolved around basketball, I knew of Bob McAdoo for quite some time,” Meeks said. “Then when I came here and started coaching, I began to realize just how much influence on VU he had even though he had not been here in so long.\"\n\nDuring his VU playing days, fans celebrated and cheered McAdoo in the historic Beless Gymnasium. His No. 50 currently hangs prominently over the court in the P.E. Complex down the street.\n\n\"Every player that comes in here gets a history lesson about the great players who have come through here, and they are all held to a standard that we now have to uphold, and it starts with Bob McAdoo,” said Franklin, VU's Hall of Fame coach. “Not only is he one of the 50 greatest players who ever lived, but he’s been the right kind of guy with it, too. The impact that has on Vincennes University, its name recognition and being associated with that, it’s immeasurable for our basketball program.\"\n\nAdded Franklin: \"We’re probably the most famous junior college program in the country, and that’s because of guys like Bob. He would have to be at the very top of that pyramid of ‘Who are your greats’. You can’t put anybody else above Bob McAdoo. I don’t know how you put a value to what Bob McAdoo has done for this school and the men’s basketball program, but we are all indebted to him.\"\n\nLife beyond VU\n\nFollowing his VU career, McAdoo played for Team USA at the 1971 Pan American Games in Colombia, then returned to his native state, where he played for the renowned University of North Carolina coach Dean Smith. McAdoo garnered first-team All-America honors and helped the Tar Heels reach the 1972 NCAA Final Four.\n\n\"The level of competition in junior college prepared me so well to make the smooth transition into Division I University of North Carolina under the guidance of legendary coach Dean Smith,” McAdoo said. “I became the valuable piece to their puzzle that made the Final Four the year of my transfer. The lessons I learned at Vincennes never left me and helped carry me through a long and successful NBA career, including two NBA championships and a successful European career where I won two EuroLeague championships.\"\n\nChosen by the Buffalo Braves, McAdoo was the second overall pick in the 1972 NBA Draft. He was the 1973 NBA Rookie of the Year and 1975 NBA Most Valuable Player and amassed three scoring titles, all in the first four years of his professional career. He won NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1982 and 1985. The five-time All-Star scored 18,787 points and averaged 22.1 points during his NBA career, scoring in double figures in all but one season.\n\nAfter the NBA, McAdoo played in Europe for seven seasons. He averaged more than 20 points or more in six of those seasons. He retired in 1992, yet his basketball journey continued.\n\nMcAdoo returned to the NBA as an assistant coach, winning three championships with the Miami Heat and helping them to five NBA championship series. McAdoo is currently the Heat’s scout/community liaison."
