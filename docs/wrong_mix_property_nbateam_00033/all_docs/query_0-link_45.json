        "text": "“Once again, let’s hear it for THE GREATEST TEAM OF ALL TIME… YOUR… TORONTOOOO RAPTORS!!!!! Let’s go for that three-peat!”\n\n- Raptors PA announcer Herbie Kuhn, Toronto Raptors 1999-2000 Championship Ring Ceremony, October 31, 2000\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nDespite all the hype surrounding the other teams in the Eastern Conference, once the season really started, the Raptors continued to look like the league’s best team.\n\nThe day after opening night, general manager Isiah Thomas traded backup center Mikki Moore to the Bulls for point guard Speedy Claxton, & swapped 2nd-round picks with the Milwaukee Bucks as part of a 3-team trade. Claxton would not play for the team this season.\n\nThe combination of this trade, the losses of Tracy McGrady & Darrell Armstrong over the offseason, and Kobe Bryant’s determination to be known as the “best player in the league” as he attempted to take over the “alpha dog” role on the Raptors, were felt heavily by the team. Sure, they started the season 18-5, which, for any other team, would be a good start. But for the Raptors, who had just gone 77-5, it was embarrassing. With the emergence of the Knicks and 76ers, many believed that the Raptors’ time was up, and that there would be a new king in the East, and for that matter, the NBA. And then, they would face a test that nobody expected.\n\n- Excerpt from Bleacher Report article, “The 2000-01 Season: When Greatness Became a Great Burden” in the series, “History of the Toronto Raptors”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nOpinion: Raptors fans, it’s time to panic\n\nToronto Sun\n\nDecember 16, 2000\n\n(MILWAUKEE) – Sure, the Raptors just survived a 109-105 nailbiter in Milwaukee. Sure, they’re 18-5, second only to the New York Knicks for best record in the league. Sure, Kobe Bryant has been absolutely tearing it up, averaging almost 30 points a game. And that’s where the problems start.\n\nIn the middle of the third quarter, while going for a dunk, Kobe landed awkwardly on his ankle, with the injury expected to keep him out until New Year’s. And while the Raptors did pull it together and manage to win the game, anyone who watches basketball could tell you something about the Raptors in the fourth quarter of that game: they looked like they had just lost their swagger. The swagger that comes with 2 championships, the best regular season record of all time, and a history free from injuries to its superstars until yesterday. In losing Kobe, the Raptors have not just lost their leading scorer and the league’s top MVP candidate; they have lost their identity, even if only for 2 weeks. Remember, Kobe is now recognized in the locker room as team leader, not Kevin Garnett, if Raptors insiders are to be believed.\n\nAnd it’s not just that. After two years of seeming to be absolutely unstoppable and terrifying the league, this whole offseason has been a reality check for the Raptors. Tracy McGrady has left for the Orlando Magic and turned out to be a megastar. Star point guard and former Finals MVP Darrell Armstrong also left the team on bad terms this offseason after a fight with Steve Nash. Former All-Star center Theo Ratliff has basically been injured since he got named to his first All-Star Game. The Knicks, not the Raptors, have the best record in the league right now. What is happening now just proves what a lot of people have been saying all along: the Raptors have been extremely lucky to have the fortune that they have had. Not every expansion team lands a megastar that manages to stay healthy in each of their first three drafts, and as hardcore Raptors fans remember, the trades that landed each of these megastars here (Kevin, Kobe, and Tracy McGrady) were very close to not happening. Now, this luck is beginning to run out.\n\nBut in spite of all of this, Raptors fans still believe that the trends that have doomed other fast-rising expansion teams, such as the Orlando Magic (Shaq & Penny) and the Milwaukee Bucks (young Kareem) will just not happen to the Raptors. And they are right to an extent: New starting point guard Steve Nash has improved with each game and made people forget all about Armstrong, especially after dropping 25 points in each of the last 2 games. However, they’re ignoring the evidence shown above: the problems that plagued expansion teams in the past are now beginning to plague the Raptors. Sure, Fred Hoiberg is taking over at shooting guard until Kobe gets back, and he’s pretty good: had it not been for his Game 5 performance in last year’s Finals, the Kings might be NBA champions. But still, he’s no Kobe, and everyone, even Fred himself, knows that.\n\nWhat Raptors fans need to be prepared for is the fact that Kobe’s injury might not just be a 2-week thing the Raptors shrug off on their way to another title: it could be a sign of uglier things to come. The ghosts of Penny Hardaway and the Orlando Magic are looming over the Raptors right now, and basketball fans must be prepared for the absolute worst, because as shown by Kobe’s injury, basketball tends to follow Murphy’s Law: Anything that can go wrong with a great team will go wrong.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nAfter Kobe’s injury, everyone was questioning the Raptors, whether or not we’d continue to stay the best team in the league. We went 9-2 against teams like the Lakers, Jazz, Pacers, Hawks, Knicks, Nuggets, and Mavericks, so, we were proving that we’d still be fine without him. Big credit to everyone on that team stepping it up in his absence. Steve (Nash) was playing like the best point guard in the league, Michael (Finley) and Kevin (Garnett) were taking over games, and Theo (Ratliff) was playing like the guy that got into the All-Star Game. People around the league saw this and were terrified of what we’d do when Kobe came back. And they had every right to be. We were 39-11 by the All-Star break, and never looked back from there.\n\n- Raptors head coach Brendan Malone, from the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “We the North”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2001 NBA All-Star Game Rosters:\n\nEast:\n\nStarters:\n\nPG Stephon Marbury (New York Knicks)\n\nSG Kobe Bryant (Toronto Raptors)\n\nSF Michael Jordan (Charlotte Hornets)\n\nPF Kevin Garnett (Toronto Raptors)\n\nC Marcus Camby (New York Knicks)\n\nBench:\n\nPG Baron Davis (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\nPG Jason Terry (Detroit Pistons)\n\nSG Allan Houston (New York Knicks)\n\nSG Jerry Stackhouse (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\nSF Grant Hill (Detroit Pistons)\n\nSF Tracy McGrady (Orlando Magic)\n\nPF Elton Brand (Chicago Bulls)\n\nPF Antoine Walker (Boston Celtics)\n\nC Elden Campbell (Charlotte Hornets)\n\nC Dikembe Mutombo (Atlanta Hawks)\n\nWest:\n\nStarters:\n\nPG Allen Iverson (Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nSG Vince Carter (Denver Nuggets)\n\nSF Chris Webber (Sacramento Kings)\n\nPF Karl Malone (Utah Jazz)\n\nC Shaquille O’Neal (Los Angeles Lakers) (All-Star Game MVP)\n\nBench:\n\nPG Steve Francis (Los Angeles Clippers)\n\nPG Gary Payton (Seattle SuperSonics)\n\nPG Nick Van Exel (Dallas Mavericks)\n\nSG Ray Allen (Vancouver Grizzlies)\n\nSF Shawn Marion (Vancouver Grizzlies)\n\nSF Donyell Marshall (Golden State Warriors)\n\nSF Peja Stojakovic (Sacramento Kings)\n\nPF Tim Duncan (San Antonio Spurs)\n\nC Vlade Divac (Sacramento Kings)\n\nC David Robinson (San Antonio Spurs)\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nDespite the Raptors’ best efforts, the combination of team chemistry issues, injuries, and a strengthened Eastern Conference resulted in the Raptors finishing with a 61-21 record, good for the second seed in the Eastern Conference. For any other team, this would be an amazing season; for the Raptors, however, this was an embarrassment. After going on the greatest 2-year run in NBA history up to that point, it seemed as if the Raptors took a step back in 2001, and were not quite the same team. As a result, the 2000-01 Raptors are often overlooked as one of the weaker teams during the Raptors’ “Dynasty Era”. Still, the 2000-01 season was a very successful season for the Raptors, and provided the foundation of the franchise’s future.\n\nAs a whole, the team finished 3rd in the league in offense (107 points/game), 12th in the league in defense (96 points allowed/game), and finished second only to the New York Knicks for highest point differential per game (+11.0 for the Raptors vs. +11.1 for the Knicks). The Raptors surprisingly went wire-to-wire atop the NBA’s Power Rankings for the 3rd year in a row. And although the Raptors sent only 2 players to the All-Star Game (Kobe Bryant & Kevin Garnett), it was in this season where the duo had finally fully developed & matured into the 1-2 punch that would terrify the league for the rest of the decade, thanks to a combination of freakish athletic ability and psychological intimidation the likes of which had never seen before (Bryant and Garnett are remembered as two of the game’s greatest trash talkers).\n\nStarting point guard Steve Nash, taking over for Darrell Armstrong, didn’t disappoint, averaging 16.6 points, 6.2 assists, and 1 steal on only 34.3 minutes per game. He also nearly completed a 50-40-90 season, shooting 49.8% from the field, 42.3% from three, and 88.1% from the foul line. Nash’s court vision, hot shooting, and flashy alley-oop passes made Raptors fans forget all about Darrell Armstrong, as he began to fully show the first signs of his future greatness. His long hair would become a trendy hairstyle among Toronto’s youth, and his Canadian background turned him into a national hero and lady magnet. At every Raptors game, you would see at least one sign on the Jumbotron written, “Marry me, Steve!”\n\nMeanwhile, Nash’s backcourt partner, Kobe Bryant, struggled through injuries and only managed to play 65 games. But during those 65 games, he was an absolute monster: he averaged 28.5 points (3rd in the NBA), 6 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.7 steals (tied for 8th in the NBA) on 39.8 minutes per game, and 51% shooting from the field. These numbers, combined with his highlight-reel dunks, made him start his third straight All-Star Game, and put him on the All-NBA Third Team. But those honours don’t tell the whole story, especially due to his injuries this season: until his first injury in mid-December, he was considered an MVP frontrunner, and throughout the season, he was considered the “best individual player in the league.” This season, Bryant made the leap from a supreme talent to a bonafide superstar and NBA icon.\n\nWhile Bryant jumped to iconic status, starting small forward Michael Finley took a backseat to Bryant’s emergence. He was not named to an All-Star Game or All-NBA Team, but continued to provide solid scoring as a third option on the Raptors. Averaging 17.8 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 4 assists on 39.7 minutes per game and 43% shooting from the field, Finley seemed to embrace his role as the Raptors’ third option next to the 1-2 punch of Kobe and Kevin Garnett, contributing wherever and whenever he could. As one of the original faces of the Raptors, having been around since the team’s first season in 1995, he could also be counted on to provide a calm voice in the locker room that contrasted with the fiery speeches of Kobe and Kevin.\n\nSpeaking of Kevin Garnett, he had another great season this year, averaging 20.1 points, 11.6 rebounds (fourth in the NBA), 4.4 assists, 1.4 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 37.9 minutes per game and 48% shooting from the field. He was named an All-Star Game starter for the fourth straight year, and was also named to the All-NBA First Team, carrying the Raptors through Kobe’s injuries. He continued to serve as the heart and soul of the team, rallying the team with clutch performances and fiery motivational speeches every time Kevin thought the Raptors were “slacking”. For all of this, Garnett earned significant MVP and Defensive Player of the Year consideration this season.\n\nStarting center Theo Ratliff managed to stay healthy this season (77 games played), and didn’t disappoint. Once again, he led the team (and entire NBA) in blocks with 3.4 per game, and added 10.3 points and 7.4 rebounds on 52% shooting and 29.5 minutes per game to that. Ratliff continued to show why he was the Raptors’ defensive anchor, and continued to be one of the league’s most intimidating interior presences, despite being a mere 6’10” and weighing only 225 pounds. He could also be counted on for putback slams and outlet passes that led to many of the Raptors’ fastbreaks. Sure, Nash, Bryant, Finley, and Garnett got all the glory, but according to them, Ratliff was “the guy that made it all work,” and being the Raptors’ glue guy was a role that Ratliff seemed to relish.\n\nHowever, production off the bench really took a hit, thanks to the losses of Darrell Armstrong and Tracy McGrady. Only two players averaged over 5 points per game off the bench (Fred Hoiberg and Brad Miller), and Hoiberg actually started 17 games taking over for the injured Kobe Bryant, while Brad Miller was out with injuries between the beginning of December and middle of January. Michael Redd, the Raptors’ 1st-round draft pick, was looking like a bust; he played a grand total of 1 minute in 3 games, scored no points, and grabbed only 1 rebound the entire season. Brevin Knight also turned out to be a huge disappointment after being traded from the New Jersey Nets, as he played in only 35 games, and averaged 4.7 points, 2.7 assists, and 0.8 stelas on only 15.8 minutes per game. Ben Wallace, Jermaine O’Neal, and Bruce Bowen, who had become mainstays on the Raptors bench, also had dips in production and minutes, with neither one of them averaging more than 11 minutes or 4 points per game. Stephen Jackson, who signed with the Raptors after playing 3 years internationally, played in only 3.7 minutes per game. Speedy Claxton never played a game this season.\n\nOverall, this season was marred by chemistry issues and a struggle to adjust to the Raptors’ offseason talent losses, despite Steve Nash’s growth into a star point guard, Kobe Bryant’s emergence as the best wing player in the league, and the ability of any player on the team to take over a game on any given night. They would head into the NBA Playoffs without the first seed in the Eastern Conference (or best record in the NBA) for the first time since 1998, when both those honours belonged to Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls. Many analysts were picking the New York Knicks, who had just signed Eddie Jones and gone 66-16, to beat the Raptors in the playoffs and win their first NBA championship since 1973. As the Raptors headed into the 2001 NBA Playoffs with the goal of a three-peat, they would have to answer all of these questions and more, especially because they would be beginning their journey against a former playoff rival hungry for revenge.\n\n- Excerpt from Bleacher Report article, “The 2000-01 Season: When Greatness Became a Great Burden” from the Bleacher Report article series “Raptors Dynasty: A Year-by-Year History of the Toronto Raptors, 1995-2015”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2000-01 NBA Awards:\n\nMost Valuable Player: Shaquille O’Neal (Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nRookie of the Year: James Posey (Denver Nuggets)\n\nDefensive Player of the Year: Marcus Camby (New York Knicks)\n\nMost Improved Player: Tracy McGrady (Orlando Magic)\n\nSixth Man of the Year: Horace Grant (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\nScoring Champion: Shaquille O’Neal (Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nRebounding Champion: Shaquille O’Neal (Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nAssists Champion: Jason Kidd (Minnesota Timberwolves)\n\nSteals Champion: Allen Iverson (Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nBlocks Champion: Theo Ratliff (Toronto Raptors)\n\nAll-NBA 1st Team:\n\nG Allen Iverson (Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nG Vince Carter (Denver Nuggets)\n\nF Tracy McGrady (Orlando Magic)\n\nF Kevin Garnett (Toronto Raptors)\n\nC Shaquille O’Neal (Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nAll-NBA 2nd Team:\n\nG Ray Allen (Vancouver Grizzlies)\n\nG Jerry Stackhouse (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\nF Grant Hill (Detroit Pistons)\n\nF Chris Webber (Sacramento Kings)\n\nC David Robinson (San Antonio Spurs)\n\nAll-NBA 3rd Team:\n\nG Stephon Marbury (New York Knicks)\n\nG Kobe Bryant (Toronto Raptors)\n\nF Peja Stojakovic (Sacramento Kings)\n\nF Tim Duncan (San Antonio Spurs)\n\nC Elden Campbell (Charlotte Hornets)\n\nAll-Rookie Team:\n\nJames Posey (Denver Nuggets)\n\nMike Miller (Milwaukee Bucks)\n\nKenyon Martin (Los Angeles Clippers)\n\nMarc Jackson (Golden State Warriors)\n\nMorris Peterson (Detroit Pistons)\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2000-01 NBA Standings\n\nEastern Conference\n\nAtlantic Division\n\nNew York: 66-16 (1)\n\nPhiladelphia: 53-29 (3)\n\nOrlando: 45-37 (6)\n\nNew Jersey: 33-49\n\nBoston: 32-50\n\nMiami: 26-56\n\nWashington: 25-57\n\nCentral Division\n\nToronto: 61-21 (2)\n\nCharlotte: 53-29 (4)\n\nDetroit: 51-31 (5)\n\nIndiana: 35-47 (7)\n\nCleveland: 33-49 (8)\n\nAtlanta: 33-49\n\nMilwaukee: 24-58\n\nChicago: 23-59\n\nWestern Conference\n\nMidwest Division\n\nDenver: 58-24 (2)\n\nSan Antonio: 56-26 (4)\n\nUtah: 41-41 (7)\n\nDallas: 40-42 (8)\n\nHouston: 36-46\n\nPhoenix: 22-60\n\nMinnesota: 20-62\n\nPacific Division\n\nVancouver: 60-22 (1)\n\nGolden State: 58-24 (3)\n\nLA Lakers: 54-28 (5)\n\nSacramento: 53-29 (6)\n\nPortland: 35-47\n\nSeattle: 33-49\n\nLA Clippers: 30-52\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2001 NBA Playoffs:\n\nEastern Conference Quarterfinals:\n\nNew York (1) vs. Cleveland (8)\n\nCharlotte (4) vs. Detroit (5)\n\nPhiladelphia (3) vs. Orlando (6)\n\nToronto (2) vs. Indiana (7)\n\nWestern Conference Quarterfinals:\n\nVancouver (1) vs. Dallas (8)\n\nSan Antonio (4) vs. LA Lakers (5)\n\nGolden State (3) vs. Sacramento (6)\n\nDenver (2) vs. Utah (7)\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2001 NBA Playoff Preview: New York, New York!\n\nSports Illustrated\n\nApril 29, 2001 issue\n\nEastern Conference Quarterfinals:\n\nKnicks over Cavaliers, 3-0\n\nHornets over Pistons, 3-2\n\n76ers over Magic, 3-2\n\nRaptors over Pacers, 3-0\n\nWestern Conference Quarterfinals:\n\nGrizzlies over Mavericks, 3-1\n\nLakers over Spurs, 3-2\n\nKings over Warriors, 3-2\n\nNuggets over Jazz, 3-0\n\nEastern Conference Semifinals:\n\nKnicks over Hornets, 4-2\n\nRaptors over 76ers, 4-2\n\nWestern Conference Semifinals:\n\nLakers over Grizzlies, 4-3\n\nNuggets over Kings, 4-3\n\nEastern Conference Finals: Knicks over Raptors, 4-3\n\nWestern Conference Finals: Lakers over Nuggets, 4-3\n\nNBA Finals: Knicks over Lakers, 4-3\n\n2001 NBA Champions (predicted): New York Knicks\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nRAPTORS VS.

You guys are underdogs in the playoffs for the first time since 1998, when the Bulls still had Michael Jordan. How does that make you feel?\n\nKOBE BRYANT (smirking): Great, actually. Being the favourite’s gotten kinda boring… you know, where’s the challenge in winning a championship when everyone expects you to? So we don’t have the best record in the league, so we might not have home-court advantage against the Knicks, so we can’t beat the best teams in the league on some nights in the regular season… big deal. That’s all talk. Save the talk until the playoff games are actually played. You know, when it actually matters.\n\nKEVIN GARNETT: We just won 2 straight championships and you’re throwing this at us… come on, really?\n\n(Audience erupts in laughter)\n\nKEVIN GARNETT: Next question.\n\nThe Raptors’ first opponent in the playoffs would be the Indiana Pacers. Like the New Jersey Nets the previous year, the Raptors would sweep the Pacers behind three straight 30+ point performances from Kobe Bryant, who embarrassed Indiana Pacers legend Reggie Miller so badly that Miller called Bryant “the best player in the world” in a post-series press conference, a title Miller had reserved for only one other player: Michael Jordan. Hours before the quote, Bryant gave Reggie Miller every reason why he deserved that title.\n\n- From the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “We the North”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2001 NBA EASTERN CONFERENCE QUARTERFINALS, GAME 3\n\nCourtesy of NBC\n\nAired April 28, 2001\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.\n\nMARV ALBERT: Raptors down by 1… 22 seconds to play.

Ask anybody on the Raptors… f**k the Pacers.\n\n- Kevin Garnett, from the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “We the North”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nAfter making the Indiana Pacers look like they didn’t even belong on the same court as the Raptors, it was on to the next round to face a Philadelphia 76ers team starring Baron Davis and Jerry Stackhouse. As a result, many anticipated the series being competitive and exciting. However, the 76ers series turned out to be just like the Pacers series: from the moment they stepped on the court, the 76ers also couldn't match up with the Raptors.\n\n- Excerpt from Bleacher Report article, “The 2000-01 Season: When Greatness Became a Great Burden” from the Bleacher Report article series “Raptors Dynasty: A Year-by-Year History of the Toronto Raptors, 1995-2015”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nI told the guys before Game 1 of the series that my gameplan was to just take Nash, Bryant, and Finley, and have them let it fly on the 76ers. I knew the 76ers, as talented as they were with Davis and Stackhouse, couldn’t play defense. Our goal was to make it a track meet… and it worked. Except it was a one-sided track meet. And I remember Kevin Garnett… he was mad going into that series. Back when he was drafted in ’95, everybody said the Raptors should have picked Stackhouse over him. Now, Kevin was going to get a chance to prove once and for all that we made the right decision.\n\n- Raptors head coach Brendan Malone, from the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “We the North”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2001 NBA EASTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS, GAME 1\n\nCourtesy of NBC\n\nAired May 6, 2001\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.\n\nMARV ALBERT: Raptors 23, 76ers 9… with 5 minutes and 24 seconds left in the 1st quarter.

Though it isn’t the Finals yet, it certainly seems like it: the two best teams by regular season record are matching up in this year’s Eastern Conference Finals, each with their own unique story. The Toronto Raptors are the current kings of the NBA; they are the 2-time defending champions, and went 77-5 last year en route to the greatest single-season run in NBA history. They are now on their quest for a three-peat, and so far, they are undefeated in that quest, having won all 7 of their playoff games. The New York Knicks made some crafty moves this offseason, and have a 66-16 record and home-court advantage to show for it. They also split their regular-season series with the Raptors. It’s the Raptors vs. the Knicks, Canada vs. the USA, “T-Dot” vs “The Big Apple.” The two biggest cities of their respective countries fighting for a trip to the NBA Finals! Game 1 is next!\n\n(cut to NBA on NBC intro)\n\nANNOUNCER: This… is the NBA on NBC! The 2001 NBA Playoffs! Tonight… Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Toronto Raptors and the New York Knicks!\n\n(cut to inside Madison Square Garden, where the crowd can be heard cheering loudly)\n\nMARV ALBERT: It is deafening inside Madison Square Garden in New York, where both teams are getting ready for what should be one of the NBA’s great playoff matchups… certainly, one of NBA history’s most-hyped! The two best teams in the league by regular season record, and arguably by talent, finally getting a chance to go at it for a trip to the NBA Finals, as we get set for Game 1 between the New York Knicks, and the 2-time defending NBA champion Toronto Raptors!\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nThe Knicks had the home-court advantage, the best record, the raucous crowd, and basically every basketball analyst in the world behind them. But the Raptors had a resilience that could only be found in teams that had already won a championship. They would prove it in Game 1 with a 30-point blowout over the Knicks, with Kobe Bryant providing 30 points and an emphatic exclamation point in the 2nd quarter.\n\n- From the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “We the North”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2001 NBA EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS, GAME 1\n\nCourtesy of NBC\n\nAired May 22, 2001\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.\n\nMARV ALBERT: Raptors up by 9… 10 and a half minutes left in the third quarter… Nash, to Bryant, Bryant double-teamed, fights his way out of it… to the rim!\n\n(Bryant proceeds to dunk on Marcus Camby, and draw the foul)\n\nMARV ALBERT: And the foul!

Unfortunately, Game 3 wouldn’t go the Raptors’ way.\n\n- From the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “We the North”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2001 NBA EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS, GAME 3\n\nCourtesy of NBC\n\nAired May 26, 2001\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.\n\nMARV ALBERT: 20 seconds left… Marbury the three… no good! Rebound Ewing, tries to post up… and he’s fouled on the shot! He will go to the line for two! And that’s Bryant’s 5th.\n\nDOUG COLLINS: Well, I think that’s a smart foul by Kobe Bryant. You’ve got 15 seconds left, Ewing is a 70% free throw shooter. Regardless of what happens at the line, you can get the ball back, get the last shot.\n\nMARV ALBERT: Ewing… puts up the first free throw… good. We’re tied at 108.\n\nDOUG COLLINS: If Ewing misses this shot, the entire game is in the Raptors’ hands.\n\nMARV ALBERT: Ewing, the second free throw… good! And the Knicks take a 1-point lead! Ratliff will inbound it to Nash… as Nash tries to dribble out the clock.\n\nDOUG COLLINS: Again, waste as much clock as you can here… you have to get that last shot… there’s no shot clock!\n\nMARV ALBERT: Nash, inside to Garnett… Garnett backing down… turnaround hook… no! Ewing the rebound, it’s stripped by Garnett! Garnett at the buzzer…\n\n(buzzer sounds)\n\nMARV ALBERT: No! And it’s over! The Knicks take it, 109-108! And the Knicks lead this series 2 games to 1!\n\nDOUG COLLINS: An amazing display of survival by the New York Knick defense, stepping up to the challenge when they needed it most! And this Toronto crowd is not happy!\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nGame 3 turned out to be an absolute heartbreaker for the Raptors, with the Knicks taking the game and the series lead. The Raptors would enter Game 4 in survival mode: if they lost this one, they would be heading to New York down 3-1, a situation almost nobody wanted to be in. They responded with a blowout win over the Knicks, stomping them by 29 points in front of a raucous Toronto crowd. The series had now turned into a best 2-out-of-3 affair. And while all that was going on, the Raptors’ expansion brethren, the Vancouver Grizzlies, made some history of their own.\n\n- From the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “We the North”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2001 NBA WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS, GAME 5\n\nCourtesy of NBC\n\nAired May 29, 2001\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.\n\nMARV ALBERT: Alright, so after the timeout, Grizzlies down by 1, 3.1 seconds to play!

Ray Allen with a game-winning 3-pointer, and the Vancouver Grizzlies are going to the NBA Finals!\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nThe Raptors would go on to blow out the Knicks in Games 5 & 6 behind unforgettable performances by Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, and Kevin Garnett, making it to the NBA Finals for the third year in a row, and setting themselves up for a chance to three-peat. But the Raptors’ win would mark more than just a chance at team history: it would also mark a big moment in league history. The Toronto Raptors won the East and the Vancouver Grizzlies won the West, setting up the first all-Canada NBA Finals ever, just 6 years after both teams were founded.\n\n- From the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “We the North”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nYou know, we didn’t buy into the whole Raptors vs. Grizzlies hype.

The NBA’s two youngest teams: the Toronto Raptors and the Vancouver Grizzlies, competing for the NBA’s ultimate prize. These two teams are also Canada’s only teams playing in the NBA. But while these two teams started at the same spot, success came at different speeds for each team. Thanks to savvy drafting and trading, the Toronto Raptors have already won each of the last 2 championships; many are calling them the greatest team ever. With their superstar duo of Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett, and great supporting pieces in Steve Nash and Michael Finley, the Raptors come in here looking to do what only the Lakers of the 50’s, the Celtics of the 60’s, and the Bulls of the 90’s did before them: three-peat. But don’t take our word for it. That’s all they’ve been talking about all season. The Vancouver Grizzlies, who used similar strategies to the Raptors, took a little longer, getting repeatedly bounced out of the first round. But this year, they finally managed to break through and ride their wave of momentum all the way to the NBA Finals. They’re going for their first championship, and they believe that they can do it against the juggernaut Raptors. Will that belief carry them to their first championship? Or will the Raptors make it 3 in a row? Raptors vs. Grizzlies, it’s the NBA Finals! Game 1 next!\n\n(cut to NBA on NBC intro)\n\nANNOUNCER: This is the NBA on NBC! The 2001 NBA Finals!

As you can see, the Grizzlies huddling, they come into these finals as 3-to-1 underdogs, but they do not lack for spirit! And as for the Toronto Raptors, the 2-time defending champion, seemingly unstoppable Toronto Raptors, they come in looking for their third straight!\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nOnce all the hype ended, it was time for the Raptors and Grizzlies to play basketball.

Kobe Bryant at the buzzer… and the Toronto Raptors will take Game 1 of this best of 7, 111-108!\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nAfter a Game 1 thriller, the Raptors would blow the Grizzlies out in Game 2 by 36 points, putting the Grizzlies down 2-0 going into Vancouver, culminating in an epic dunk by Kobe Bryant.

And Game 3 appeared to be more of the same, as the Raptors won that game on a 41-point performance from Michael Finley to take a commanding 3-0 lead in the series. Going into Game 4, it appeared as if the Raptors would sweep the Finals for the first time in their history, and achieve that elusive 3-peat. But the Vancouver Grizzlies came to play that day, and it ultimately showed, as the Grizzlies beat the Raptors 113-106.

Got it! And we are tied at 133!\n\nDOUG COLLINS: What a play by Steve Nash! Getting as open as he did and drilling it in the face of Damon Stoudamire!\n\nMARV ALBERT: Now, Stoudamire will bring the ball up court… on the perimeter… 9 seconds, clock is ticking… tries to get it to Abdur-Rahim… with the shot… he is… stripped by Garnett! Garnett stole the ball! And the Raptors call a timeout, 2.6 seconds to go!\n\nDOUG COLLINS: This is it, now, with 2.6 seconds to go, and the game tied, you only have to get one point and win this game. Go for the easiest shot possible… get it into either Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant or Kevin Garnett. Even though that’s what everybody will be expecting, they’ve been your most reliable guys all year in these types of situations to make the shot. If they do that, the Raptors might be coming home with another championship tonight. As for the Grizzlies, you have to go for a turnover. That’s the only way you’ll score, but even then, the only way you’ll stay alive. You cannot let the Raptors score. If you do, it’s all over.\n\nMARV ALBERT: Grizzlies facing what could be the end of their season. 2.6 seconds left, Raptors have the ball. Nash to inbound. Garnett catches, shoots… no good!

Sank a 3-point shot that won the game? Man, I have a hard time believing that. You know, to this day, I still believe he released the shot after the buzzer sounded… I still don’t think that really happened. And I was on the court… I saw it happen. It plays in my mind over and over again… and I still can’t believe it happened.

To this day, it’s still ranked as #1 on lists of “Greatest Moments in NBA History,” just because of the sheer improbability and timing of it. Ben Wallace, the team’s worst shooter, managed to sink a game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer in the NBA Finals to win the Toronto Raptors a championship. It seemed like something straight out of a Disney movie.\n\n- From the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “We the North”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nThree-peat! Game-winning 3-pointer caps off overtime thriller that sees Raptors win third straight NBA championship\n\nToronto Star\n\nJune 16, 2001\n\n(VANCOUVER) – In a game that looked and felt just like the epic championship battles of many sports movies, the Raptors came out on top, and claimed their third straight NBA championship in a 136-133 overtime victory in yesterday’s Game 5. This makes them only the fourth team in NBA history to win 3 titles in a row, after the Minneapolis Lakers of the 50’s, the Boston Celtics of the 60’s, and the Chicago Bulls of the 90’s, and makes them the only team in NBA history to follow up another team’s championship three-peat (Chicago Bulls, 1996, 1997, and 1998) with a three-peat of their own (1999, 2000, and 2001).\n\nDuring the trophy presentation at GM Place in Vancouver, the first in Raptors history not held at the Air Canada Centre (or in Toronto in general), David Stern called the Toronto Raptors “a team for the ages,” and congratulated them on an “unbelievable ending to an unbelievable championship run.”\n\nMeanwhile, Raptors owner John Bitove claimed that he saw this coming all the way, joking, “Only 3 championships? Man, I expected 6 by now.” He then expressed his admiration for the team, saying, “But seriously, this is a great organization from top to bottom: everyone here is committed to winning, committed to true greatness every day. We have the best coaching staff in the world, we have the best players in the world, we have the best fans in the world… all of that adds up, we have the best team in the world!” While taking some time to savour the moment, he also tried to predict where the Raptors would be next June: “All that’s left is for us to go for 4.”\n\nRaptors head coach Brendan Malone echoed Bitove’s sentiments, saying that “he counts his blessings every day that Isiah (Thomas) brought me here, that Isiah, Allan (Slaight, another owner of the Raptors), & John had faith in me from the moment I got here. They never gave up on me, never gave up on this team, and it shows. We’re raising another championship trophy to prove it. When we went for our first championship, I told my guys that they were a championship team every night. Once we won that first championship, I told them, ‘The winning only stops when you let it.’ And so far, they haven’t let it stop.”\n\nMeanwhile, Finals MVP Kobe Bryant, after averaging 27 points, 6.4 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 2.2 steals on 42.2 minutes per game, said that “it’s an honour to be a part of this team and this organization. Winning 3 straight championships at this young an age… it’s been a dream come true. And like John said, hopefully, we can go for 4 next year. It’s great to be here again and again.”\n\nBut the real hero of this game, and for that matter, the series, was Ben Wallace. With the game tied at 133 with 2 seconds left to play in overtime, Wallace rebounded a Kevin Garnett miss and drained an unbelievable buzzer-beating three-pointer that would give the Raptors the game, the series, and the championship. Wallace, a third-string power forward for the Raptors, came through when the team needed it most, and even though those were his only 3 points of the game, Wallace said that “it ultimately doesn’t matter when those 3 points win your team a championship.” Wallace also said that he was “still trying to wrap his head around what just happened” at the trophy presentation, but said that, “when the opportunity presented itself to be a Finals hero… I wasn’t thinking about that. I was just thinking about making the shot to help us win the championship.”\n\nWallace better be able to absorb the fact that his buzzer-beating 3-pointer actually happened, as it is already being called the “greatest play in NBA history.” As a result, he will likely overshadow Finals MVP Kobe Bryant in this year’s championship celebrations; he has been asked to appear on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in Kobe Bryant’s place, and has also been asked to appear on shows like The Oprah Winfrey Show, and The Late Night Show with David Letterman, honours that would usually be reserved for the NBA Finals MVP.\n\nWhen Bryant was asked about it, he laughed and told a reporter “not to worry about it, as he (Wallace) won us the championship, not me. If he doesn’t make that shot, we’re probably going back to Toronto without this trophy.” He also joked that the team “is gonna make sure the fame doesn’t go to Ben’s head.”\n\nThe Raptors’ championship parade will take place on Monday, starting at 12:00 PM, with the parade route being exactly the same as the parade route in previous years: it’ll start at Lake Shore Boulevard and Yonge Street, go west to Lake Shore & Spadina Avenue, then go up Spadina Avenue to Front Street, and then go down Front Street to Bay Street, where it will end just outside the Air Canada Centre. Excess fans will also be able to watch the parade inside Union Station, where the screens will show the championship parade instead of departure & arrival times for trains & buses.\n\nThe Raptors’ championship celebration is occurring under a calm environment for once: no expiring contracts, no trade rumours, no riots… just pure joy. It will be interesting to watch what that championship celebration looks and feels like, and just how long the carefree feeling surrounding this Raptors team lasts.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n2001 NBA Finals Results: Toronto Raptors (Eastern Conference) vs. Vancouver Grizzlies (Western Conference):\n\nGame 1 (@ Toronto): Toronto 111, Vancouver 108: Toronto leads 1-0 (Kobe Bryant hits buzzer-beating, game-winning 3 pointer)\n\nGame 2 (@ Toronto): Toronto 117, Vancouver 81: Toronto leads 2-0\n\nGame 3 (@ Vancouver): Toronto 117, Vancouver 109: Toronto leads 3-0 (Michael Finley 41-point game)\n\nGame 4 (@ Vancouver): Vancouver 113, Toronto 106: Toronto leads 3-1\n\nGame 5 (@ Vancouver): Toronto 136, Vancouver 133: Toronto wins 4-1 (Ben Wallace hits series-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer)\n\nToronto Raptors defeat Vancouver Grizzlies 4-1, 2001 NBA CHAMPIONS\n\nTotal NBA Championships: 3 (1999, 2000, 2001) (THREE-PEAT)\n\n2001 NBA Draft Lottery Results\n\nPhoenix\n\nOrlando (from LA Clippers)\n\nMiami\n\nMinnesota\n\nChicago\n\nMilwaukee\n\nWashington\n\nBoston\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlanta\n\nSeattle\n\nPortland\n\nHouston\n\n2001 NBA Draft Order\n\nPhoenix\n\nOrlando (from LA Clippers)\n\nMiami\n\nMinnesota\n\nChicago\n\nMilwaukee\n\nWashington\n\nBoston\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlanta\n\nSeattle\n\nPortland\n\nHouston\n\nCleveland\n\nIndiana\n\nDallas\n\nUtah\n\nToronto (from Orlando)\n\nDetroit\n\nCharlotte\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nSacramento\n\nLA Lakers\n\nSan Antonio\n\nDenver\n\nPortland (from Golden State)\n\nSacramento (from Vancouver)\n\nToronto\n\nCharlotte (from New York)\n\n2001 NBA Draft Results\n\nPhoenix: Tyson Chandler, C, Dominiguez (HS)\n\n*Minnesota (from LA Clippers via Orlando): Kwame Brown, C, Glynn Academy (HS)\n\nMiami: Pau Gasol, PF, Spain\n\nMinnesota: Shane Battier, SF, Duke\n\nChicago: Jason Richardson, SG, Michigan State\n\nMilwaukee: DeSagana Diop, C, Oak Hill (HS)\n\nWashington: Eddy Curry, C, Thornwood (HS)\n\nBoston: Eddie Griffin, PF, Seton Hall\n\nNew Jersey: Zach Randolph, PF, Michigan State\n\nAtlanta: Rodney White, PF, UNC-Charlotte\n\nSeattle: Vladimir Radmanovic, C, Serbia\n\nPortland: Joe Johnson, SG, Arkansas\n\nHouston: Troy Murphy, PF, Notre Dame\n\nCleveland: Steven Hunter, C, DePaul\n\nIndiana: Richard Jefferson, SF, Arizona\n\nDallas: Jason Collins, C, Stanford\n\nUtah: Kedrick Brown, SF, Okaloosa-Walton\n\nToronto (from Orlando): Gerald Wallace, SF, Alabama\n\nDetroit: Michael Bradley, PF, Villanova\n\nCharlotte: Brendan Haywood, C, North Carolina\n\nPhiladelphia: Samuel Dalembert, C, Seton Hall\n\nSacramento: Kirk Haston, SF, Indiana\n\nLA Lakers: Joseph Forte, SG, North Carolina\n\nSan Antonio: Tony Parker, PG, France\n\nDenver: Raul Lopez, PG, Spain\n\nPortland (from Golden State): Jamaal Tinsley, PG, Iowa State\n\nSacramento (from Vancouver): Jeryl Sasser, SG, Southern Methodist\n\nToronto: Gilbert Arenas, PG, Arizona\n\nCharlotte (from New York): Brandon Armstrong, SG, Pepperdine\n\n* Orlando trades 2nd pick in 2001 NBA Draft & PG Alvin Williams to Minnesota for PG Jason Kidd.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nToronto Raptors Draft Picks:\n\nFirst Round:\n\nGerald Wallace (18th overall), SF, Alabama\n\nGilbert Arenas (28th overall), PG, Arizona\n\nSecond Round:\n\nMehmet Okur (33rd overall), C, Turkey\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nThe Raptors would cap off their three-peat season with an unbelievable 2001 NBA Draft, scoring Gerald Wallace, Gilbert Arenas, and Mehmet Okur. While this draft was spectacular, everybody’s demands for playing time resulted in, again, several bench players from the Raptors’ championship teams being let go, and subsequently turning into stars elsewhere. By now, with the emergence of Tracy McGrady as a superstar, it was becoming obvious: the Raptors were so good at identifying & acquiring future superstars that they were essentially “breaking the NBA.” They were accused of “talent hoarding,” “cheating the system,” and many other terms implying that they somehow had an unfair advantage over the rest of the NBA. Some Internet conspiracy theories even claimed that the NBA was directly co-operating with the Raptors to make them the dominant team in the league to prove that Canadian basketball could be successful, using incidental images of innocent gestures made by David Stern, Isiah Thomas, John Bitove, & Allan Slaight as their “proof”. And while the Raptors were innocent of all these actions, the stigma remained.\n\n- From the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary “We the North”\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\n\nAired February 17, 2006\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.\n\nJAY LENO: You know, this is some scary stuff, I just read this on the Internet… 10 of this year’s NBA All-Stars are either current or former Raptors.
