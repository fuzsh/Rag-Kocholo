        "text": "In his first year in the NBA, Jonathan Kuminga is already making himself known throughout the big leagues.\n\nAt just 19 years old, the young rookie continues to learn and develop with the Warriors.\n\nAfter JK’s outstanding performance vs. the Chicago Bulls on Jan. 14, which included a game-high 25 points on 10-of-12 shooting, three assists and a career-high three blocks, coach Steve Kerr praised Kuminga.\n\nKerr compared Kuminga’s game to four-time All-Star Shawn Marion.\n\nAnd Marion said he sees the similarities.\n\n“That's a compliment. I really respect it,” Marion told Dorell Wright on \"Warriors Pregame Live\" before Tuesday’s Warriors-Mavericks game. “But we're always comparing current players to past players. That's the normal thing to do to give you a picture of some of the similarities they have. He's not necessarily going to be me or be anything like me, but he's got some Shawn Marion tendencies, which is awesome.”\n\nKuminga had another stellar performance at home on Tuesday vs. the Mavs.\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nAfter scoring just five points throughout the first three quarters, Kuminga scored 17 in the fourth and finished with a team-high 22 points on a nearly perfect 8-of-9 shooting from the field, 4-of-4 from behind the arc and making both of his two free-throw attempts in 18 minutes.\n\nOh, and he also put Mavericks guard Josh Green on a poster with an explosive monster dunk, just one of many so far this season.\n\nKuminga’s efforts show on both ends of the floor, as soon as he checks in. Which is one of the reasons Kerr brought up Marion’s name.\n\n“The only thing we’ve been emphasizing is running the floor hard,” Kerr said after the win over the Bulls. “Using [Kuminga’s] gifts, both ways. Every time, sprint the floor hard. When I was in Phoenix as a GM, we had Shawn Marion. One of the best athletes in the league. Every night, he’d just run the floor hard. He wasn’t the greatest 3-point shooter, wasn’t the greatest passer, wasn’t the greatest ball-handler. But he was an All-Star because he just played hard. By running the floor, all kinds of good stuff would happen.\n\n“That’s the first step for JK. To understand his gifts are so unique athletically. They jump out even in an NBA game. Taking advantage of those gifts now allows him to build a foundation, then from there, his shooting will improve, understanding of the game will improve, overall skill level will improve. But what I liked about the last two nights is it’s the hardest I’ve seen him run the floor on consecutive nights.”\n\nThough Kuminga still has a lot to learn, it’s pretty clear the rookie isn’t wasting any time in his first year and is taking advantage of getting to learn from those around him, including some of the best in the league.\n\nRELATED: Playing Poole with Steph, Klay could unlock Warriors' offense\n\n“I wish the young fella a great career because I've watched him play [and] I love his energy and effort,” Marion said. “That's what's getting him over the hump. He plays hard when he comes down the floor and he's setting the tone right then and there. He's not trying to go into the emotion of the game. No, he's coming in there going hunting, hard.\n\n“And that's why he's able to do the things he can on the court because everybody else is half-assing it. He's going straight at their yanks, he's rebounding, getting two and three tips while everybody is sitting there watching. They just thinking it's going to fall in their lap, no one want to go get it. He's going to get that ball. He's hit a few threes, he's working on his jumper. He has a knack. He's playing harder than everyone on the court right now. That's why he's able to separate himself and I'm happy for the young guy.”"
