        "text": "“We’re here. Nobody’s moving the team. We’re in Auckland, baby.”\n\nThe 45-year-old has been in Auckland over the last week for the first time since before the pandemic to support the team on their current home stretch. He was courtside for their 31-point win over the Southeast Melbourne Phoenix at Spark Arena last Saturday and is expected to be in the building when the Breakers host the third-placed Tasmania Jackjumpers at the not-yet-sold-out Eventfinda Stadium on Friday night as they continue to fight for a spot in the playoffs.\n\nThe Breakers currently sit one spot out of the playoff places in seventh with a 9-11 record, two wins back from the Cairns Taipans but with three games in hand on them.\n\nOf the seven games left on their schedule, three of those are against teams currently outside the playoffs, with the other four against the teams currently occupying the top four spots on the ladder.\n\nAsked if he offered any wisdom or pointers to the team when he was able to link up with them in person, Marion said their most recent performance spoke for itself.\n\n“If you watched the game [last week] what pointers am I going to give them? They won by 30 points. All I can say is repeat that action and play that same way every night,” he said.\n\n“We’ve got a great group of guys and they definitely put it out on the floor. You see it, they play hard, they compete, and sometimes you just fall short. There are situations where sometimes the ball doesn’t bounce your way, but for the most part, if you go out there and play with your energy and effort, a lot of times you reap the benefit of it.”\n\nMarion’s resume would make him more than qualified to share his feedback should he wish.\n\nDuring an 18-season NBA career, Marion was an NBA champion, a four-time All-Star, a two-time All-NBA third-team selection, and an Olympic bronze medalist. Last year, he got arguably the greatest honour in the sport when his No 31 jersey was retired by the Phoenix Suns.\n\nMarion said it was a moment he knew would happen at some stage given his contributions in a nine-season run with the team.\n\n“Yeah, I knew that. I mean, c’mon, man. I’m not going to sit here and be over-cocky or anything, but I earned that. It wasn’t given, I earned that and it was very much appreciated. I truly earned that, and there’s not even a question about that.”"
