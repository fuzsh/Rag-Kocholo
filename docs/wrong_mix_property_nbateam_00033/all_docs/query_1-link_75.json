        "text": "Former NBA forward Shawn Marion is making his case for induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile speaking with The Athletic's Michael Lee, the one-time NBA champion, who made four All-Star and two All-NBA appearances, said he believes he's not in the Hall for reasons that have nothing to do with his on-the-court contributions.\n\n\"I know it’s a political thing,\" Marion explained. \"It’s a lot more other stuff going on. But certain things, you earn that. I earned that.\"\n\nAs noted by the official Dallas Mavericks website, Marion was the first NBA player to accumulate 15,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 1,000 blocked shots and 500 drained three-pointers. He, along with Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone and Kevin Garnett, are the only players to tally 17,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals and 1,000 blocks.\n\nOlajuwon and Malone are already in the Hall. Garnett was elected in April."
