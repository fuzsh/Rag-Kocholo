Register a team and join the Third Annual West Park Tournament of Stars celebrity basketball event, in support of West Park Healthcare Centre. On March 29 and March 30, 2019, play ball alongside Toronto Raptors alumni and other NBA stars for a great cause – rebuilding a hospital.\n\nPresented by Raymond James, the Tournament of Stars joins together teams of hoop-loving celebrities and West Park supporters in a five-on-five basketball tournament. Proceeds from the event will support the life-changing work done every day at West Park, a Toronto rehabilitation hospital that helps people with serious injuries and illness – including amputation, stroke, lung disease, and severe trauma – get their lives back.\n\n\"The care that people receive at West Park helps them overcome enormous health challenges to lead productive and independent lives,\" said Joanne Cole, CEO of West Park Foundation. \"We are the next step following a stay in acute care, helping people get out of the hospital and back home with their families.\"\n\nThe West Park Tournament of Stars gets underway the evening of Friday, March 29, 2019 with the celebrity draft party where teams draft a celebrity teammate – the more money a team raises, the higher they pick in the draft. Games take place the following day at the University of Toronto's Goldring Centre for High Performance Sport (100 Devonshire Place) – tip-off is at 9:00 a.m.\n\nCelebrities playing this year include Toronto Raptors alumni Jerome \"Junk Yard Dog\" Williams, Morris Peterson, Tracy Murray, Alvin Williams, Antonio Davis, Shawn Marion, Reggie Evans, Matt \"Red Rocket\" Bonner, Roger Mason Jr., Charlie Villaneuva, plus more stars to be announced. Returning as Honorary Ambassador is Jack Armstrong, TSN and NBA TV Sportscaster.\n\nThe Tournament of Stars is quickly becoming one of the most-anticipated events in the city as the event has been nominated for the \"Most Outstanding Event Award\" by the Canadian Event Industry Awards (CEIA) – a testament to the uniqueness, impact, and momentum of this marquee event.\n\n\"The Tournament of Stars is a fun-filled event for the entire family – not only do participants get to meet such stars, they also get to play alongside them, all in support of a great cause\" said Daniel Simunac, Head of Raymond James Bank's Canadian subsidiary, a member of the hospital's board, and returning Organizing Chair of the tournament. \"West Park plays a critical role in our healthcare system and Raymond James is proud to support it by serving as the Presenting Sponsor of this special event in our community.\"\n\nDo you have \"game?\" If you think you can play with the pros, visit westparktournamentofstars.ca to register a team and prepare to draft your celebrity teammate.\n\nAbout West Park Healthcare Centre\n\nWest Park Healthcare Centre helps patients get their lives back by providing specialized rehabilitative and complex care after a life‐altering illness or injury such as lung disease, amputation, stroke, and traumatic musculoskeletal injuries.
