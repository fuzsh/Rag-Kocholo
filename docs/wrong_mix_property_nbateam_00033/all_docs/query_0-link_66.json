        "text": "Netflix released a documentary chronicling the rise and fall of the brand which, for lovers of the brand, is a trip down memory lane well worth taking. For fans of Weartesters, keep your eyes peeled for a cameo by your favorite internet sneaker guy. We will leave an image here so you can look for the exact moment. It is a small moment but is crazy to see how far Weartesters has come.\n\nAND1: Origins\n\nAND1 began its journey in 1993 when Jay Coen Gilbert, Seth Berger, and Tom Austin started a t-shirt company out of the trunk of a car while studying at the University of Pennsylvania. The t-shirts featured the legendary faceless hooper and different trash talk phrases typically heard on the blacktops across America. The shirts were such a hit that they were snatched up by Foot Locker. Within two years of its launch, AND1 products were available in 1,500 stores across the US.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, AND1 was chugging along as just another basketball brand. That is, until a fateful day in 1998. A tape was delivered to AND1 containing blurry, homemade streetball footage by a high school basketball coach from Queens, New York. The tape featured a spectacular New York City point guard by the name of Rafer Alston, aka Skip To My Lou. Having an “aka” was about to get wildly popular. And the videotape would soon be known as the “Skip Tape”.\n\nEarly in 1999, after a failed traditional marketing campaign, AND1 decided to use the “Skip tape” as a marketing tool and reprinted 50,000 copies. Over the next eight weeks, it was distributed to basketball camps, clinics, and record labels. The tape would become the first basketball mixtape, and quickly made Alston an underground celebrity.\n\nIn the summer of 1999, AND1 created a clever marketing strategy that would prove pivotal to the brand. A free highlight tape was given to everyone who purchased AND1 products. The tape was known as the AND1 Mixtape. Approximately 200,000 tapes were distributed in three weeks, making this promotion one of the most successful in U.S. retail history.\n\nThe effects of this tape were felt in the NBA and in the basketball world for over a decade as a generation of players copied and introduced this new school of streetball into the zeitgeist. Dunks and handles became “a must” in the NBA, while FG% and threes were an afterthought. Think of Jamal Crawford, Allen Iverson, Jason “White Chocolate” Williams, T-Mac, KG, Paul Pierce, Marbury, and Larry Hughes, just to name a few.\n\nAs the 2001 season rolled around, AND1 was closing in on Nike. In only eight years, they had become the second-largest basketball brand in the United States.\n\nThe AND1 Mixtape became a cultural phenomenon. Many streetball players reached legendary status. They were known around the world exclusively by their nicknames: Hot Sauce, Half Man Half Amazing, AO, Black Widow, the Professor, Escalade, Alimoe, Spyda, The Air Up There, Skip to My Lou, and Main Event. If you lived through that era and didn’t try that Hot Sauce move with the spin and tucking the ball under your shirt, we can’t be friends. Just sayin’.\n\nThe soundtracks to the mixtapes were incredible, featuring artists like Snoop Dog, Mobb Deep, CNN, MOP, Method Man, GZA, Common, Talib Kwali, and more.\n\nAND1 also created a world streetball tour, which was sort of like a hip-hop Harlem Globetrotters. They then added a reality TV show and even released a video game. The success of AND1 had the basketball shoe market on their heels scrambling to ride the streetball wave.\n\nEA Sports released the NBA and NFL street video games series (some of the most fun games ever made, in my opinion). Nike put out their battleground product line and video series, while the NBA released the NBA street, ankle breakers, and dunk DVD series. The born-to-ball DVD was even a thing. It wasn’t the best era for technical basketball, but damn, it was fun.\n\nAND1 Quest Mid\n\nThese bad boys were worn by several NBA players back in 2003. Ben Wallace, Shawn Marion, and Desmond Mason all got personalized colorways of this shoe even though the marketing was primarily centered around Marbury. The shoe featured very shiny synthetic materials and the heel and the forefoot were two different colors.\n\nAND1’s slogan for that year, “Get Yours”, was featured on the forefoot in a typeface that would make the Clippers proud. This shoe’s moment-in-the-sun was when Seattle Supersonics highflyer Desmond Mason rocked them during an epic but underrated dunk contest.\n\nAND1 KG 2\n\nYes, that KG, The Big Ticket, Kevin Garnett! Kevin Garnett, who had been Marbury’s teammate, also signed with AND1 and rocked a number of different AND1 models.\n\nThe most iconic was the KG 2. These guys are so early 2000s it’s not even funny. Red iridescent accents, KG’s thumbprint on the tongue, and a sleek swooping design…just awesome! KG won the 2003 NBA All-Star game MVP that featured an almost 40-year-old MJ. He knocked down an amazing shot to send the game to a second OT. Classic!\n\nAND1 Silky Smooth\n\nThe AND1 Silky Smooth dropped in 2001. They were worn by a variety of NBA players including Stephon Marbury, Kevin Garnett, Shawn Marion, and Larry Hughes. The shoe was meant to be versatile so guards and agile big men could both be covered.\n\nThe AND1 Silky Smooth featured a dual-density, compressed EVA midsole, a large partially-exposed heel counter, and full-grain leather. They were conceived (like many AND1 models) to be used both indoors and outdoors. But these land on this list because of Jerry Stackhouse, who personally pioneered the custom shoe job by slapping on a makeshift Nike logo on his pair.\n\nIt was actually a touching, sneaker nerd move. Kobe had beef with adidas dating back decades. Harden, as an adidas athlete, had to find a pair of shoes within the brand with which to pay tribute to Kobe.\n\nAs luck would have it, Reebok was purchased by adidas and James got his hands on this iconic pair of the Question Mid.\n\nHarden would actually go on to release his own colorway of the Question Mid later in 2020.\n\nAND1 Spree Mid\n\nThe Spree Mid premiered in 2003. This was Sprewell’s first true signature shoe and the first shoe from AND1 to feature a visible version of the company’s Harmonix cushioning system.\n\nIt also featured what AND1 called the Springz Geometry midsole that was supposed to provide cushioning directly under the heel and the Duraspring polyurethane foam that the visible Harmonix airbags are encapsulated within.\n\nDuraspring was a dense polyurethane used to give the sneaker responsive cushioning that would last. AND1 really tried to create a top-notch performance model and, by all accounts, they did.\n\nLike the Adidas Kobe 1, the Spree Mid design was inspired by performance cars. The two shoes actually look like they could be brothers. They had Jordan 14-esque ventilation scoops, a shroud, and came in a box with spinner rims. 2003 was a hell of a time.\n\nAND1 Chosen One Mid\n\nThe AND1 Chosen One Mid was an ugly shoe, there is no denying it. It looks like a cross between a pair of crocs and Formula One racing shoes. But, they did stand out. You have to give them that. They deserve a slot on this list because of their outlandish design and for withstanding the incessant pounding of Big Ben Wallace during the 2003-04 season.\n\nThat year, Big Ben was second in the NBA in boards (12.4 per game), was second in blocks (3.0 per game), was named to the All Star team, and won an NBA championship. And he did it all while wearing these guys right here.\n\nAND1 Desire\n\nThe AND1 Desire felt like the successor to the Tai Chi back in the day. They both shared the two-tone design, and they incorporated updated “performance features” such as the velcro strap, AND1’s Harmonix cushioning, a Springz Geometry heel, Poron inserts (forefoot & heel), and an internal bootie construction. They might not have made our list, if it weren’t for one important detail: they graced the feet of the great Black Mamba.\n\nWhile Kobe was a sneaker free agent in 2002-03, he laced up a bunch of legendary PEs from a variety of different brands. One of the shoes he reached for was the AND1 Desire. He chose the blacked-out colorway and the white/silver version. He even got a white and yellow PE. Personally, I would have loved to see a black and yellow colorway, but it was not to be. If they were good enough for Kobe, they are good enough for this list."
