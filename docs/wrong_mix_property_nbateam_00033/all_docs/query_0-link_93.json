Who are their 25 best?\n\nBasketball: NBA Playoffs: Phoenix Suns Amar’e Stoudemire (1) and Steve Nash (13) during Game 3 vs Los Angeles Lakers. Phoenix, AZ 5/23/2010 CREDIT: John W.

Because of their lack of a championship, it’s easy to talk about the Boston Celtics, Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs first while laughing about even suggesting the Suns in that conversation.\n\nBut did you know Phoenix is the NBA’s winningest team to have never won a title?\n\nSince they were founded in 1968, the Suns have been to the playoffs 29 times, they’ve posted 19 seasons of at least 50 wins and have been to the Western Conference Finals nine times. The Suns became the fourth fastest team to reach 2,000 wins in January 2013 and they are also the fourth winningest franchise in NBA history.\n\nThat lack of a championship has long haunted Suns supporters everywhere, but make no mistake about it: this team has seen its fair share of all-time NBA greats. In order to add some perspective to this team’s history, here’s a look at the 25 greatest Phoenix Suns of all time.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Cliff Robinson, Cedric Ceballos, Grant Hill, Channing Frye, Boris Diaw, Jason Richardson, P.J. Tucker, Eric Bledsoe\n\nPHOENIX – MAY 02: Raja Bell #19 of the Phoenix Suns looks on during a freethrow in Game Five of the Western Conference Quarterfinals during the 2007 NBA Playoffs at US Airways Center on May 2, 2007 in Phoenix, Arizona.

(Photo by Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images)\n\nRaja Bell\n\nSG, 2005-08\n\nI know what you’re thinking. Raja Bell is only revered by Suns fans because of that one time he clotheslined Kobe Bryant. While it was a perfectly executed clothesline, that admission doesn’t make up for the fact that it was a dirty play, nor is it the reason Bell cracks the top 25.\n\nThough he only played four seasons in Phoenix, they were easily the best years of Bell’s career. As a three-point specialist who made 42.2 percent of this attempts from downtown, Raja helped the Suns reach the Western Conference Finals in 2006, where Phoenix might have prevailed had a calf injury not held Bell out for two and a half games.\n\nBell is the second in three-point percentage on the Suns’ all-time career leaders list and in 2006-07, he led the league in made three-pointers (205), tying Gilbert Arenas.\n\nHe’ll be remembered among Suns fans for his three-point touch, his clutch shot-making, his two NBA All-Defensive Team selections and yes, that Kobe clothesline.\n\n24\n\nMaurice Lucas\n\nPF, 1982-85\n\nMaurice Lucas played for two ABA teams and six different NBA teams during his 14-year career, and his three seasons with the Suns came well past his prime. Still, the 6’9″ power forward averaged a near double-double at 15.4 points and 9.7 rebounds per game, and he got the Suns to the playoffs in every season during his time in Phoenix.\n\nNicknamed “The Enforcer” for his physical playing style, Lucas loved to bang bodies in the paint, which helped him outwork bigger frontcourt players. He’s first all-time in Suns history for defensive rebounding percentage (26.0) and second in total rebounding percentage (18.0).\n\nHis time with the Suns was extremely limited, which is why him impressive numbers don’t move him higher up the list. He was an All-Star his first season in Phoenix, but suffice it to say the Suns would’ve loved having the Enforcer during his prime.\n\nPHOENIX – JUNE 1: Joe Johnson #2 of the Phoenix Suns walks on the court during the final moments of their loss to the San Antonio Spurs in Game five of the Western Conference Finals during the 2005 NBA Playoffs at America West Arena on June 1, 2005 in Phoenix, Arizona. The Spurs defeated the Suns 101-95, winning the series 4-1 and will advance to the NBA Finals.

(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nJoe Johnson\n\nSG, 2002-05\n\nJoe Johnson‘s best years didn’t come until he joined the Atlanta Hawks, and his departure from Phoenix was a messy one when he felt the Suns were lowballing him in contract talks. But regardless of the way it all ended (and how he subsequently became one of the most overpaid players in the NBA), Johnson was, without question, a player on the rise during his time with the Suns.\n\nDuring the 2004-05 season, his final season with the team, Johnson helped the Suns to to a league-best 62-20 record, but Phoenix’s playoff hopes were dashed when Joe went down with a left orbital bone fracture in the second round. Johnson averaged 17.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game while shooting an absurd 47.8 percent from three-point range that year.\n\nJohnson would probably be a few spots higher had his departure not been so unpleasant, and he’d probably have cracked the top 15 had he chosen to stick around in Phoenix.\n\nStill, with averages of 14.0 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game on .432/.393/.757 shooting splits, Johnson’s developmental years in Phoenix were clearly the foundation of a long and successful NBA career.\n\n22\n\nGar Heard\n\nPF, 1976-80\n\nLike Raja Bell, Gar Heard is best known for one memorable play during his time with the Phoenix Suns. Unlike Bell, Heard’s “Shot Heard ‘Round The World” is a more positive memory.\n\nIn double-overtime of Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals, a game that is often called the greatest NBA game of all time, Heard hit a 20-foot turnaround jumper to tie it at the buzzer and send the game to triple-OT.\n\nThe Suns wound up losing that game, and the series, but Heard had 17 points and 12 rebounds in the classic Game 5 performance. He is Phoenix’s all-time leader in defensive rating (95.2) and in the season he was traded from the Buffalo Braves to the Suns, he played 86 games — still an NBA record.\n\nHeard’s numbers — 7.5 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 1.0 BPG — certainly don’t leap off the page, and he only spent five seasons with the Suns, but he was a driving force in the 1976 NBA Playoffs, helping to lead Phoenix to one of two Finals appearances in franchise history. For that, and for perhaps the greatest shot in team history, he makes the top 25.\n\n21\n\nMark West\n\nC, 1988-94, 1999-00\n\nAt 6.9 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game in his eight seasons with the Suns, Mark West has the least impressive stat line of anyone on this list. But his outstanding defensive contributions in limited minutes were significant enough to to garner him some recognition in our top 25.\n\nFor six straight seasons, West played all 82 games for the Suns and averaged 2.8 blocks per 36 minutes. Though his offensive game was as limited as his minutes often were, West was extremely efficient on what touches he did get, converting 61.3 percent of his shots. That percentage makes him the all-time franchise leader in that category.\n\nAs a member of that 1993 Suns team that went to the NBA Finals, West’s impact off the bench was often overlooked. But there’s a reason the NBA’s sixth all-time leader in field goal percentage makes this list.\n\n20\n\nTruck Robinson\n\nPF, 1979-82\n\nHow could a name like Truck Robinson NOT be on the list of top 25 Phoenix Suns players? Ok, so maybe his actual name was Leonard, but he gained his more popular nickname because of his sheer strength that made up for his status as a “tweener” — too big to play small forward but not quite big enough for being a power forward.\n\nHowever, Robinson was one of the best power forwards in the NBA during his prime. He was strong enough to bang with power forwards, but his ball-handling skills and extremely efficient shot made him a a tough assignment for other team’s small forwards as well.\n\nIn four seasons in Phoenix, Robinson averaged 18.1 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game while shooting 51 percent from the floor.\n\nThe Suns advanced to the Western Conference Finals in Truck’s first season with the team, but they lost to the Seattle SuperSonics in seven games. He wasn’t much of a playoff performer and he only spent four seasons with the team, however, so this is as high as he climbs — cool nickname and all.\n\n27 Apr 2001: Head coach Paul Silas of the Charlotte Hornets looks on in game three of round one of the NBA playoffs against the Miami Heat at the Charlotte Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Hornets won 94-79 to sweep the series 3-0. DIGITAL IMAGE. Mandatory Credit: Craig Jones/Allsport\n\nPaul Silas\n\nSF/PF, 1969-72\n\nIt’s unfortunate that Paul Silas wound up playing for the very Boston Celtics team that would defeat the Phoenix Suns in the 1976 NBA Finals, but his three seasons in the Valley of the Sun and his reputation as an NBA head coach were still impressive enough to earn him a spot in the top 25.\n\nIn his three years in Phoenix, Silas put up 14.1 points, 12.1 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game. In his best season with the Suns, he averaged 17.5 points, 11.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game and was selected to the All-Star team. He was a nightly double-double and is Phoenix’s all-time leader in rebounds per game at 12.1.\n\nSilas was an All-Defensive Team selection twice in Phoenix and though his time with the Suns was extremely limited, those three years he spent with the team were too statistically relevant to ignore.\n\nFeb 28, 2014; Phoenix, AZ, USA; Phoenix Suns shooting guard Goran Dragic (1) celebrates a three point basket against the New Orleans Pelicans during the second half at US Airways Center. The Phoenix Suns won the game 116-104. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\nGoran Dragic\n\nPG, 2008-11, 2012-15\n\nIt might seem a bit premature/downright wrong to put Dragic on this list, especially after the way he left the Valley of the Sun by stating he wouldn’t re-sign with the team a mere 48 hours before the trade deadline.\n\nBut ignoring his prime with the Suns just because he followed the disturbing trend of a Phoenix star getting fed up and moving on would be a mistake. After all, it wasn’t long ago that he was well on his way to becoming one of the most beloved Suns in recent memory.\n\nFour seasons ago, Dragic was the team’s best player on a Suns squad lost the second most games in franchise history. A year later, under Jeff Hornacek, Dragic vastly improved his numbers and led the Suns to 48 wins — one game shy of the playoffs.\n\nAveraging 20.3 points and 5.9 assists per game while shooting 50.5 percent from the field and 40.8 percent from downtown, the Dragon won the NBA’s Most Improved Player of the Year award and earned All-NBA Third Team honors.\n\nAt his peak, Dragic was a one-man fast break and as the spiritual successor to Steve Nash, but his time in Phoenix didn’t last long enough. However, anyone who puts up 23 points in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the San Antonio Spurs deserves a spot on this list.\n\n17\n\nCharlie Scott\n\nSG, 1972-75\n\nLike nearly every player we’ve covered thus far, Charlie Scott‘s time in Phoenix was limited. But in taking a look at the raw numbers, you can easily tell he was one of the most talented players to ever wear the purple and orange.\n\nIn his four seasons with the team, Scott averaged 24.8 points, 5.3 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 1.7 steals per game, with a Player Efficiency Rating of 18.5.\n\nScott represented the Suns in three consecutive All-Star games and in his best season, averaged 25.4 points, 5.2 assists and 4.3 rebounds per game. He’s also the franchise’s all-time leader in points per game at 24.8.\n\nUnfortunately, by trading Scott to the Celtics after the 1974-75 season, the Suns gave Boston yet another weapon that would help the Celts best Phoenix in the ’76 Finals. Had Scott stuck around in Phoenix longer and, you know, NOT actively prevented the Suns from winning a championship, he’d be higher up our rankings. That hurt, Charlie.\n\nLANDOVER, MD – CIRCA 1982: Dennis Johnson #24 of the Phoenix Suns passes the ball against the Washington Bullets during an NBA basketball game circa 1982 at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. Johnson played for the Suns from 1980-83. (Photo by Focus on Sport/Getty Images)\n\nDennis Johnson\n\nPG/SG, 1980-83\n\nHey look, another terrific player who only stuck with the Suns for three or four seasons!\n\nsuns\n\nValley of the Suns 1 wIt's Time to Let Brandon Knight Lead the Suns\n\nMore headlines around FanSided:\n\n1 w - NBA: 2016-17 Predictions For The Pacific Division1 w - Phoenix Suns Release Schedule Hype Video2w - Northern Arizona Suns Head Coach Tyrone Ellis Introduced2w - Phoenix Suns: NBA Insider Predicts Unordinary Starting Five2w - NBA Insider Says Phoenix Suns are Playoff TeamMore News at Valley of the Suns\n\nHad Dennis Johnson not clashed with coach John McLeod, he might have gone down as one of the best guards in Suns history. But alas, Phoenix had to trade him after just three seasons, which led to the Suns finishing with 12 fewer losses in their first year without him.\n\nD.J. was a two-time All-Star, earned an All-NBA First Team selection and made the NBA’s All-Defensive Team three times during his stint with the Suns. After being a second option with the Sonics, D.J. played shooting guard in Phoenix and became the team’s first option on offense.\n\nIn his three seasons in the Valley, Johnson averaged 17.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game.\n\nThe Suns made the playoffs all three seasons with Johnson at the helm, but his knack for winning wouldn’t be fully recognized until after he was traded to…(drumroll)…the Boston Celtics. At least those Celtics weren’t responsible for defeating the Suns in the Finals, though.\n\nDec 13, 2014; Bloomington, IN, USA; Grand Canyon Antelopes head coach Dan Majerle reacts during the second half against the Indiana Hoosiers at Assembly Hall. Indiana defeated Grand Canyon 94-66. Mandatory Credit: Pat Lovell-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDan Majerle\n\nSG/SF, 1988-95, 2001-02\n\nIt only took us 10 players, but we’ve finally reached someone who played a considerable amount of time in the Valley of the Sun! As our longest-tenured Sun so far, Dan Majerle was a fan favorite because of his stout defense, his three-point touch and, of course, his thunderous dunking ability, which earned him the nickname “Thunder Dan.”\n\nIn eight total seasons with the team, Majerle averaged 13.5 points, 4.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.4 steals per game while shooting 36.3 percent from three-point range.\n\nMajerle made three All-Star teams and was chosen for the NBA’s All-Defensive team twice. He’s also second all-time in made three-pointers (800) for the franchise and was the starting shooting guard for that 1993 Suns team that went to the NBA Finals and won a league-best 62 games.\n\nHe would ultimately fail the biggest challenge of his career in being tasked with defending Michael Jordan in that championship series, but it wasn’t because Majerle wasn’t good enough; MJ was simply that much better than everyone else.\n\nBut Thunder Dan was a hard worker who helped the Suns reach the playoffs in each of his first seven years with the team, which more than makes up for his so-so numbers.\n\nNov 9, 2014; Phoenix, AZ, USA; Phoenix Suns head coach Jeff Hornacek talks with Phoenix Suns guard Goran Dragic (1) and Phoenix Suns guard Eric Bledsoe (2) during the second half at US Airways Center. The Suns won 107-95. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJeff Hornacek\n\nSG, 1986-92\n\nIt’s tempting to move Jeff Hornacek up this list considering that memorable 2013-14 season when he served as head coach of the Phoenix Suns, but by looking just at his time as a player, No. 14 feels appropriate.\n\nNot only did he play valiantly alongside Kevin Johnson in his time there, but he also became a crucial trade piece that helped Phoenix acquire Charles Barkley and take the next step forward. Hornacek averaged 13.7 points and 5.4 assists per game on .510/.390/.854 shooting splits during his time in Phoenix.\n\nHornacek was a terrific third option behind K.J. and Tom Chambers, and the trio led the Suns to four playoff appearances, including two trips to the Western Conference Finals. In his final season with the team, Hornacek averaged 20.1 points, 5.1 assists and 5.0 rebounds per game, earning him the only All-Star appearance of his career.\n\nAn extremely efficient shooter, Hornacek spread the floor with his three-point touch and was a bothersome defender who made life less enjoyable for opposing backcourts.\n\nTrading him ultimately made the Suns better, but his time in Phoenix was significant enough to make him want to return later as a coach, a move that was embraced by Suns fans everywhere until a parting of ways was necessary during the tumultuous 2015-16 season.\n\nStill, Hornacek is widely respected by the Suns fan base, both for his playing days and his time coaching a team that ultimately proved too dysfunctional to manage.\n\nUNITED STATES – JANUARY 05: Basketball: Multiple view of Milwaukee Bucks Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (33) in action, playing defense vs Phoenix Suns Dick Van Arsdale (5), Blur, Milwaukee, WI 1/5/1974–3/11/1974 (Photo by Heinz Kluetmeier/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images) (SetNumber: X18472)\n\nDick Van Arsdale\n\nSG/SF, 1968-77\n\nAs the first star of the Phoenix Suns, Dick Van Arsdale is third all-time in minutes played and fifth in points for the franchise. In his first five seasons with the Suns, he averaged 20 points per game and was a three-time All-Star.\n\nKnown as one of the best free throw shooters in the NBA at the time, Van Arsdale played nine seasons in the Valley of the Sun and was a member of that 1976 team that went to the NBA Finals. Van Arsdale’s nickname, “the Original Sun,” should tell you why he’s earned a place in the Suns Ring of Honor.\n\nIn nine total seasons with the franchise, Van Arsdale averaged 17.6 points and 3.6 rebounds per game, shooting 47.1 percent from the floor.\n\nFor his durability, his solid numbers and the fact that he scored the first points in the history of the franchise, Van Arsdale earns the 13th spot on our list. It also doesn’t hurt that he was the first player in Suns history to play with his brother, identical twin Tom Van Arsdale, paving the way for the Dragic and Morris brothers later on.\n\n12\n\nLarry Nance\n\nPF, 1981-88\n\nWhen you hear the name “Larry Nance” you probably think of the first winner of the Slam Dunk Contest, but that’s unfortunate, because Nance actually sported a very well-rounded game.\n\nHe was best known for his high-flying dunks, but he was also a great rebounder, an imposing shot-blocker and an extremely efficient scorer, posting a field goal percentage of 56.1 percent. In seven seasons in Phoenix, he averaged 17.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.9 blocks per game.\n\nNicknamed the “High-Ayatolla of Slamola” after winning the 1984 Slam Dunk Contest, Nance was an excellent midrange shooter who could operate from the post as well. Nance is the franchise leader in blocks and fourth in total rebounds. He made one All-Star team during his seven seasons with the Suns.\n\nIn his final season in Phoenix, Nance averaged a career-high 22.5 points per game. It should also be noted that because of his stellar play, the Suns were able to trade him in a package to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kevin Johnson, Mark West, Tyrone Corbin and a draft pick that became Dan Majerle. Considering three of those players are in our top 25, that’s not a bad haul.\n\nPHOENIX, AZ – APRIL 18: Phoenix Suns’ Jason Kidd(L) and Shawn Marion(R) cheer on their team against the Utah Jazz during the fourth quarter 18 April 2001 in Phoenix. The Suns won 98-93. (Photo credit should read MIKE FIALA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nJason Kidd\n\nPG, 1996-01\n\nOh, what might have been. If it feels like we’ve said that a lot on this list, it goes extra for Jason Kidd, who might have been able to lead the Suns somewhere special if not for an ugly domestic violence incident that led the Suns to panic-trade him away after five seasons. Penny Hardaway staying healthy might have helped matters too.\n\nStill, Kidd was sensational during his limited time with the Suns. In his first full season with the team, he helped Phoenix improve by 16 wins from the season before.\n\nHe earned three All-Star selections (it would have been four, but there was a lockout in 1999) and led the league in assists for three consecutive seasons during his time in Phoenix. Kidd ranks first in assists per game and fifth in total assists for the franchise.\n\nIn his five seasons, he averaged 14.4 points, 9.7 assists, 6.4 rebounds and 2.1 steals per game with an18.8 Player Efficiency Rating.\n\nHe also made the All-NBA First Team three times and was selected to the NBA’s All-Defensive Team three times. J-Kidd was an excellent defender, a versatile walking triple-double, and one of the best passers to ever suit up for the Suns. It’s a pity that despicable domestic violence incident derailed what might have been.\n\n(GERMANY OUT) Trainer, Basketball, NBA USA (Phoenix, Suns) – in Trainingsjacke beim Training, – 1995 (Photo by Claus Bergmann/ullstein bild via Getty Images)\n\nPaul Westphal\n\nSG, 1975-80, 1983-84\n\nLike Hornacek, it might be tempting to boost Paul Westphal‘s placement in the top 25 because he came back to coach the Phoenix Suns after his playing career was over, but in looking just at his time as a player, No. 10 feels right.\n\nThe six seasons Westphal spent in Phoenix were easily his best, as he racked up four All-Star appearances and four All-NBA team selections. He averaged 20.6 points, 5.2 assists, 2.2 rebounds and 1.6 steals per game while shooting 51.6 percent from the field in that time.\n\nWestphal was a member of that 1976 Finals team and averaged 20.5 points, 5.4 assists, 3.2 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game that season. He has the third best Player Efficiency Rating, the second highest usage rate and the eighth most points in team history.\n\nThough his only championship came with the Boston Celtics before he was traded to the Suns, Westphal’s time in Phoenix, not to mention his service coaching the 1993 Suns to the Finals, makes him a mainstay on this list.\n\nBasketball: NBA Finals: Phoenix Suns Alvan Adams (33) in action, boxing out vs Boston Celtics. Boston, MA 5/23/1976–6/4/1976 CREDIT: Manny Millan (Photo by Manny Millan /Sports Illustrated/Getty Images) (Set Number: X20559 )\n\nAlvan Adams\n\nPF/C, 1975-88\n\nWe didn’t get here until the top 10, but we finally have a Phoenix Suns player who spent the entirety of his career wearing the purple and orange! It makes sense, then, that Alvan Adams is the franchise leader in games, minutes, total rebounds, steals and defensive win shares. He’s also second in points, third in assists and fourth in blocks.\n\nIn his 13 seasons, he averaged 14.1 points, 7.0 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 49.8 percent from the floor.\n\nAs you can probably tell, Adams was an extremely well-rounded power forward on offense and an excellent defender on the other end. He might have peaked in his rookie season, when he won the Rookie of the Year award, All-Star honors AND All-NBA honors, but his numbers were still excellent for most of his career.\n\nAdams averaged 19.0 points, 9.1 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.5 blocks per game in that stellar rookie season.\n\nOh, and one more thing about that excellent rookie season? It was 1976, the year the Suns went to the Finals. Adams’ No. 33 was rightfully retired, though he did grant (get it?) Grant Hill permission to wear it once he joined the Suns years later. For his versatility and long tenure in Phoenix, it’s impossible to leave Alvan Adams out of the top 10.\n\nBasketball: Phoenix Suns Tom Chambers (24) in action vs Cleveland Cavaliers at America West Arena.\n\nPhoenix, AZ 2/28/1993\n\nCREDIT: John W.

His first season in Phoenix, the Suns improved by a staggering 26 wins from the season before.\n\nChambers led the Suns to the Western Conference Finals twice, but even though he was putting up amazing numbers, he couldn’t quite get them over the hump as the team’s alpha dog. Once the Suns added Charles Barkley and Kevin Johnson, however, he seamlessly adjusted to a sixth man role and helped the Suns reach the 1993 NBA Finals.\n\nChambers made the All-Star Game three times as a Sun and is sixth in points per game in team history. Oh, and his epic dunk over Mark Jackson that looked like he jumped off a trampoline? Quite possibly the most badass white boy dunk in NBA history.\n\nNew York Knicks vs Phoenix Suns – Knicks’ Cazzie Russell lets go with one-hander but Connie Hawkins of the Phoenix Suns goes up to grab it during action at the Garden last night.

(Photo By: Walter Kelleher/NY Daily News via Getty Images)\n\nConnie Hawkins\n\nPF, 1969-73\n\nNicknamed “The Hawk,” Connie Hawkins unfortunately spent most of his prime in the ABA. Still, he probably had the most style of any player on this list and was excellent during his four-plus seasons with the team, putting up a well-rounded 20-9-4 stat line.\n\nIn his first season in Phoenix, Hawkins was at his finest, putting up big numbers and carrying the Suns in a first round playoff series with a Los Angeles Lakers team that sported the likes of Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor.\n\nHe put up 25 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists per game during that epic seven-game series, even though the Lakers were ultimately triumphant.\n\nIn all four of his full seasons in Phoenix, Hawkins made the All-Star team every time. He’s eighth all-time in points per game for the Suns and though Phoenix missed out on his ABA years, he’s still easily one of the best players in franchise history.\n\nUNITED STATES – FEBRUARY 09: Basketball: Phoenix Suns Walter Davis (6) in action, taking shot vs Atlanta Hawks, Phoenix, AZ 2/9/1978 (Photo by James Drake/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images) (SetNumber: X22115 TK1)\n\nWalter Davis\n\nSG/SF, 1977-88\n\nSimilar to Alvan Adams, Walter Davis peaked in his rookie season, when he averaged 24.2 points, 6.0 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.4 steals per game, earning him the Rookie of the Year award and All-NBA Second Team honors. He didn’t fall off the map, as his career numbers indicate, it’s just unfortunate he never got any better.\n\nStill, Davis’ place among the all-time Suns greats is unquestionable. Nicknamed “Sweet D” for his pure jump shot, Davis shot 51 percent or better from the floor in each of his first seven seasons, earning him six All-Star appearances and another All-NBA Second Team designation.\n\nFor his career in Phoenix, Davis averaged 20.5 points, 4.4 assists, 3.2 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game while shooting 52.0 percent from the floor.\n\nDavis was also nicknamed “The Greyhound” for his slender build, but this skinny guy could play. He’s the Suns’ all-time scoring leader (15,666 points) and he’s also in the top five for games, minutes, assists, steals and defensive win shares.\n\nEven though a recurring back injury and a drug controversy led to a messy departure from Phoenix, Davis and the Suns have since repaired their relationship, which makes him an easy selection for the top 10.\n\nPHOENIX – MAY 23: Amar’e Stoudemire #1 of the Phoenix Suns in action during Game Three of the Western Conference finals of the 2010 NBA Playoffs against the Los Angeles Lakers at US Airways Center on May 23, 2010 in Phoenix, Arizona.

Nash was the finesse and intelligence of those great Suns teams; Amare was the brute force and dominant will in the paint.\n\nIn his eight years with the Suns, STAT averaged 21.4 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game.\n\nStoudemire also racked up the Rookie of the Year Award, five All-Star appearances, four All-NBA selections, and two Western Conference Finals appearances in his time in Phoenix. In the 2005 WCF Finals, he averaged an absurd 37 points per game. He never brought the Suns to the promised land, but he was too explosive during his prime to be left out of the top five.\n\nPHOENIX – JUNE 03: Shawn Marion #31 of the Phoenix Suns stands on the court as the Dallas Mavericks come from behind in the second half of game six of the Western Conference Finals during the 2006 NBA Playoffs on June 3, 2006 at US Airways Center in Phoenix, Arizona.

However, because of his excellent defense, his impressive rebounding and his athleticism on the wing, The Matrix is far too well-rounded to leave out of the top five.\n\nHe didn’t win a title until he was past his prime with the Dallas Mavericks, but Marion was a terrific glue guy for those Suns teams that were regular contenders in the West.\n\nMarion’s versatility allowed him to play both small forward and power forward, which helped him make four All-Star games and and two All-NBA teams. In 2005-06, Marion filled in for an injured Amare Stoudemire and led Phoenix in points, rebounds, steals AND blocks. He made four All-Star Games and was selected to the All-NBA Third Team twice.\n\nIn his nine seasons with the team, Marion averaged 18.4 points, 10.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.9 steals and 1.4 blocks per game, all while shooting 48.1 percent from the floor and 34.2 percent from downtown.\n\nThe Matrix ranks first in total win shares, second in rebounds, second in steals, third in blocks and fourth in points for the Suns. It’s unfortunate he felt that management undervalued him, but even after a less than savory departure, Shawn Marion is still one of the greatest players in franchise history.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY, UNITED STATES: Jacque Vaughan (back) of the Utah Jazz fights through a pick set for Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns Thursday evening April 6, 2000 in Salt Lkae City. (Photo credit should read GEORGE FREY/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nKevin Johnson\n\nPG, 1988-98, 2000\n\nIt’s easy to remember how Kevin Johnson wasn’t ready for basketball’s biggest stage during the 1993 NBA Finals, but focusing on that would be overlooking just how damn good he was despite his inability to stay healthy later in his career.\n\nIn his first three injury-free seasons with the Suns, K.J. averaged 20 points and 10 assists per game, but from there he had frequent problems staying healthy.\n\nA lightning-quick point guard who always found his teammates and wasn’t afraid to go in amongst the trees in the lane, Johnson earned the NBA’s Most Improved Player of the Year Award during the 1989-90 season. He ranks second all-time in assists, win shares and offensive rating for the Suns, and he’s also third in scoring.\n\nIn his 12 seasons in Phoenix, KJ averaged 18.7 points, 9.5 assists, 3.4 rebounds and 1.5 steal per game.\n\nThe Suns reached the playoffs 11 times in Johnson’s 12 seasons. He made the All-Star team three times. He earned five All-NBA Team selections. He even banged home a legendary dunk on freaking Hakeem Olajuwon. So forget about that one bad playoff series, because Kevin Johnson is still one of the best players in Phoenix Suns history.\n\nPHOENIX, AZ – MAY 4: Phoenix Suns players Charles Barkley (L) and Danny Manning (C) battle San Antonio’s Will Perdue (R) for the ball during first half playoff action at America West Arena 03 May 1996. (Photo credit should read PAUL GERO/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCharles Barkley\n\nPF, 1992-96\n\nIf this list were more along the lines of “greatest NBA players to ever play for the Suns,” Charles Barkley would undoubtedly be at the top. But since it’s more about the greatest Phoenix Suns ever, Charles Barkley’s four seasons with the team limit him to No. 2.\n\nHowever, the fact that he’s even in the top five at all after only four seasons should tell you just how prolific he was during his time in the Valley of the Sun.\n\nIn his first season with the Suns, Barkley accomplished something Steve Nash never could: he took the Suns to the NBA Finals. There, Sir Charles went toe-to-toe with the greatest player in NBA history. Though Michael Jordan was ultimately just a hair better, Barkley was elite that season, earning his lone regular season MVP Award and giving those Chicago Bulls everything they could handle in the championship series.\n\nIn just four years with the team, Barkley climbed to seventh on the Suns’ all-time leaderboard for rebounds and he still ranks first in Player Efficiency Rating. His memorable moments include a Game 4 triple-double in the Finals, a 56-point outing against the Golden State Warriors and a 44-point, 24-rebound performance against the Sonics in the playoffs.\n\nHe averaged a monstrous 23.4 points, 11.5 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 1.6 steals per game with the Suns, posting a 24.7 PER as well.\n\nBarkley also made the All-Star team and All-NBA team every season he was a Sun. Injury issues limited his time in Phoenix, but the Round Mound of Rebound was easily the best individual to ever don the purple and orange.\n\nPHOENIX, AZ – APRIL 25: Steve Nash #13 of the Phoenix Suns reacts during the NBA game against the San Antonio Spurs at US Airways Center on April 25, 2012 in Phoenix, Arizona. The Spurs defeated the Suns 110-106.

Ok, so maybe he didn’t deserve either of those awards. Shaquille O’Neal probably should have won in 2005 and Kobe Bryant was more deserving in 2006, but Nash actually should have won in 2007, so I guess it balances out.\n\nIn 10 seasons with the team, Nash averaged 14.4 points, 9.4 assists and 3.1 rebounds per game — all while averaging a 50-40-90 club appearance with .504/.435/.907 shooting splits.\n\nIn any event, Nash giving the Suns 10 years of his prime and remaining loyal despite never making a Finals appearance makes him the lasting face of the franchise. Teaming up with Amar’e Stoudemire, Nash made the Seven Seconds or Less Suns one of the most dominant offenses in league history and a regular title contender whose elite status was vindicated by the Golden State Warriors’ championship in 2015.\n\nThe high pick and roll with STAT was diabolically difficult to stop, and it all started with Nash’s craftiness. Those Suns never got over the Western Conference Finals hump, but Nash and that offense revolutionized the game of basketball.\n\nMore from Hoops Habit\n\nHe was a minus defensively, and his lack of playoff success hurts his standing among the all-time greats.\n\nBut we can’t talk about his lack of postseason accomplishments without mentioning all the bad luck he experienced, which included Joe Johnson’s postseason injury in 2005, questionable playoff suspensions for key players in a 2007 series with the San Antonio Spurs and a missed box-out that led to a Ron Artest game-winner in the 2010 Western Conference Finals.\n\nHowever, Nash made the 50-40-90 club a jaw-dropping six times, averaging those percentages over his 10-year tenure in Phoenix. He made the All-Star team six times, was selected to an All-NBA team five times and ranks first in franchise history in three-pointers, three-point percentage, free throw percentage, assists, offensive rating and offensive win shares.\n\nHe never won a title, and the last few years of his career have made for a depressing end (see what happens when a Sun joins the Lakers?). But Steve Nash is without question the greatest and most influential Phoenix Suns player of all time.\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
