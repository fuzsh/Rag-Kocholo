        "text": "Shawn Marion of the Dallas Mavericks, would love to give one of Bossip’s single moms a wonderful Christmas! It’s supposed to be “the most wonderful time of the year,” however, it can be quite a struggle for many … single mothers, in particular. Support for a child or children should never be a one-person task, however, we all the know that single motherhood is reality for so many. Having been raised by his single mother, Marion makes a point to “put a smile” on children’s faces this Christmas through the Shawn Marion Foundation.\n\n“Christmas is all about the kids, you know? I love to do this because I love kids and I want to put a smile on some faces on Christmas day. My mom was single and she raised me and my sisters by herself, so I know how rough it can be. In these times, it’s hard enough to keep food on the table let alone buy gifts for Christmas, so I’m going to personally deliver gifts to the children of 10 single moms. This is my third year doing this through my foundation and I plan to continue because it means a lot to me to give back. I’m blessed to be able to do this.“\n\nMarion will provide a “Christmas to Remember” to one Single Mom who is a Bossip reader. If you’re a single mom or know a single mom who could use some support this holiday season, please write in 200 words or less why she should be considered as one of the finalist for a “Christmas to Remember” and e-mail to christmasgiveaway@bossip.com! The mom selected will be asked to submit an official Christmas list. It could be toys, groceries, clothing, food, bills paid etc. All entries must be received by December 17, 2010 and a winner will be announced on December 18."
