        "text": "- 2024 Enshrinement Ceremony to be held on Saturday, August 17 -\n\nSPRINGFIELD, MASS. – The Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame announced the list of eligible candidates for the Class of 2024, including several high-profile, first-time nominees, including the 2008 U.S. Olympic Men’s Basketball Team (“Redeem Team”), Vince Carter, Seimone Augustus, Bill Laimbeer, Rick Barnes, Mike Fratello and Penny Taylor.\n\nA first look at the list of eligible nominees will be provided by “NBA Today” on ESPN, hosted by Malika Andrews, with Class of 2023 Hall of Famer Becky Hammon, Kendrick Perkins, Chiney Ogwumike, and Brian Windhorst.A complete list of eligible candidates can be found below.\n\nFinalists from the Honor’s Committee for the Class of 2024 will be announced on Friday, February 16, in Indianapolis, Indiana, during NBA All-Star Weekend.\n\nThe entire Class of 2024 will be unveiled during the NCAA Final Four in Phoenix, Arizona, on Saturday, April 6, in a nationally televised broadcast.\n\nThe announcement time and broadcast network for both the Finalist and the Class Announcement will be announced in the near future.\n\nEnshrinement weekend will begin at the Mohegan Sun on Friday, August 16, with the Tip-Off Celebration and Awards Gala, followed by the Enshrinement ceremony on Saturday, August 17, at Springfield’s historic Symphony Hall.\n\nVIP Packages for the Hall of Fame Enshrinement Weekend will go on sale on Friday, February 16. All single-event tickets to the Ceremony, Tip Off Celebration, and Awards Gala, as well as other ancillary events, will go on sale on Saturday, April 6, at 12:00 p.m. EST. All packages and tickets will be available for purchase at hoophall.com.\n\nThe complete listing of events and pricing will be released by February 1.\n\nThe Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame also announced changes to its election process that will more carefully examine candidates from the International, Men’s Veteran’s, Women’s Veteran's, and Contributor Committees. Since 2011, the Hall of Fame has allowed these categories to be stand-alone ‘direct-elect’ committees with the objective of ensuring candidates who may have ‘fallen through the cracks’ received focused and specialized consideration in these various categories. The Election Process Committee has determined that this objective of more acute consideration has been met during this 12-year period, and now candidates put forth from these categories will revert back to the previous and traditional process of being presented for final consideration to the Honors Committee for election.\n\nFor the latest news and updates, follow @hoophall on X (formally Twitter) and Instagram.\n\nAbout the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame\n\nLocated in Springfield, Massachusetts, the city where basketball was born, the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame is an independent non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to promoting, preserving, and celebrating the game of basketball at every level – men and women, amateur and professional players, coaches, and contributors, both domestically and internationally.
