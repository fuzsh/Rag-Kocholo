        "text": "DALLAS — A person with knowledge of the deal says the Dallas Mavericks will acquire forward Shawn Marion from Toronto.\n\nThe trade is not official, but the person told The Associated Press on Wednesday it should be completed. The person was granted anonymity because the deal was still being worked on.\n\nThe Raptors couldn’t afford to re-sign Marion because they need to clear salary cap space for Hedo Turkoglu. They are close to an agreement with the Orlando Magic free agent.\n\nThe deal was first reported by The Dallas Morning News.\n\nMarion is a versatile player who can be used at either forward position. He spent just half a season in Toronto after being traded from Miami.\n\nThe trade is expected to include at least one other team to make the salaries work. Oklahoma City and Memphis are likely candidates because they are far enough under the salary cap to facilitate a deal.\n\nThe Mavericks have been busy during the offseason, agreeing to give point guard Jason Kidd a three-year contract for more than $25 million to remain in Dallas. They also are trying to reach a deal with Marcin Gortat, Orlando’s backup center.\n\nMarion was a four-time All-Star in Phoenix but is facing a major pay cut from the $17.8 million he earned last season. He scored 12.9 points per game, well below his career average of 17.8.\n\nMarion will join Kidd, Dirk Nowitzki and Josh Howard, giving the Mavericks four former All-Stars."
