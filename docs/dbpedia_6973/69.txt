British film-maker Peter Yates, who directed such movies as Bullitt and Summer Holiday, has died aged 81.

According to his agent, he died in London on Sunday after an illness.

Bullitt, released in 1968, featured a famous chase scene in which Steve McQueen drove a Ford Mustang through San Francisco.

He is survived by his wife Virginia Pope, a son and a daughter.

The family will hold a private funeral, his agent Judy Daish continued.

A graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Yates started out as an actor before becoming an assistant director on such films as The Guns of Navarone and A Taste of Honey.

He made his directorial debut in 1963 with Cliff Richard vehicle Summer Holiday, going on to make episodes of The Saint and Danger Man.

In 1967 he wrote and directed Robbery, a heist film inspired by the Great Train Robbery of 1963.

Bullitt, his first US film, followed a year later, casting McQueen as the head of a police unit guarding a man about to testify against his mobster brother.

His other films included The Friends of Eddie Coyle with Robert Mitchum, Mother, Jugs & Speed with Raquel Welch and The Deep starring Jacqueline Bisset.
