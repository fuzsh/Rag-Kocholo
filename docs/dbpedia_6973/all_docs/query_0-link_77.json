        "text": "PAOLO AND VITTORIO TAVIANI, the Italian film-making brothers who won international renown as the writer-directors of ''Padre Padrone'' and ''The Night of the Shooting Stars,'' recently embarked on their first English-language film, ''Good Morning, Babylon.'' The movie, which takes place between 1910 and 1917, tells the story of two Italian brothers - artisans in their father's cathedral-restoration business - who come to America to ply their craft and end up building sets on D. W. Griffith's epic 1916 silent movie, ''Intolerance.'' Vincent Spano and Joaquim De Almeida play the brothers, and Charles Dance the legendary director.\n\n''The birth of cinema is one of the great myths of our time,'' Paolo Taviani said recently, speaking through a translator. ''What fascinated us about the subject is that pre-World War I Hollywood was a pioneer community whose members were collectively inventing something. When someone discovered a new technique, he would invite all the crews from other movies to share the knowledge. One of the themes of the film is the legacy of the great Italian craftsmen through the centuries who were actually involved in the creation of the cinema. There's a scene in which Griffith explains to the brothers' father that making a certain kind of film is like building a cathedral, and that the only difference is the medium - marble versus celluloid.''\n\n''Good Morning, Babylon'' is being shot in Italy and the United States. The sets depicting pre-World War I Hollywood actually were built in Tuscany. The New York sequences, which were shot last week, depict the brothers' earliest days in America.\n\nThe screenplay was written by the Tavianis and then translated into English. While that may sound odd, the Tavianis insist that the language barrier was no problem for them."
