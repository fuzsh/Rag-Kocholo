        "text": "The director Peter Yates, who has died aged 81, helped Steve McQueen achieve iconic status with the cop movie Bullitt (1968), enjoyed a massive box-office success with The Deep (1977) and made one of the most beguiling of all youth movies in Breaking Away (1979). He maintained a steady career throughout five decades, initially in the theatre and then in mainstream cinema, but he suffered the critical neglect so often accorded those who tackle a variety of subjects and genres and become known, somewhat disparagingly, as journeyman directors.\n\nPauline Kael described him as a competent director \"with a good serviceable technique for integrating staged movie action into documentary city locations\". David Thomson suggested that, in America, Yates had \"done nothing more profound than send hubcaps careering around corners\". Bullitt's famous San Francisco car chase (later revived by Ford as part of an advertising campaign) became one of cinema's most influential action sequences.\n\nThe movie itself was a tribute to Yates's consummate professionalism. He was born in Aldershot, Hampshire, to Colonel Robert Yates and his wife, Constance. After attending Charterhouse school, Surrey, he opted for Rada. His notions of acting were soon forsaken for theatre direction, first in the regions, and then at the Royal Court in London, where he directed plays including The American Dream and The Death of Bessie Smith (both 1961).\n\nHe gained valuable film experience in the dubbing studios in Wardour Street, central London, and worked as an assistant director on films as varied as Cover Girl Killer (1959), Sons and Lovers (1960), The Guns of Navarone (1961) and A Taste of Honey (1961). In 1960 he married the film publicist Virginia Pope. Later that decade he gained experience in television, directing episodes for the series The Saint and Danger Man.\n\nHe made his debut as a film director with the amiable Cliff Richard musical Summer Holiday (1963), which was unfortunately sandwiched between two better-choreographed Richard vehicles and the arrival of the Beatles on screen in A Hard Day's Night (1964). Undeterred, he returned to his theatrical origins to film NF Simpson's One Way Pendulum in 1964. The play's nonsense humour, which had delighted audiences at the Royal Court, failed to engage film audiences increasingly used to a diet of realist drama.\n\nYears of graft and a period Yates had spent as a racing driver gave him the break he needed when he was hired to direct Robbery (1967). The heart-stopping opening car chase and climactic action sequence made the film, which was inspired by the great train robbery, a turning point in his career. It brought box-office success, critical plaudits and an invitation to Hollywood. Nudging 40, Yates was offered Bullitt, starring McQueen as a cool, laconic cop. The film launched a busy career on both sides of the Atlantic as both director and producer.\n\nIn a move characteristic of his career, Yates next directed an oddly simple charade, John and Mary (1969), starring Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow as a couple who meet in a Manhattan singles bar, have sex and find love, then in the film's closing moments discover each other's name.\n\nHe then tackled a second world war movie, Murphy's War (1971), with Peter O'Toole as a zestful Irishman who revamps an old fighter plane and uses it to destroy a German U-boat in the last days of the conflict. With its Orinoco river locations, eccentric hero and Si√¢n Phillips as a plucky doctor, it gave a passing nod to The African Queen (1951) and proved commercially successful.\n\nAfter the engaging, if overlong, 1972 crime caper The Hot Rock (also known as How to Steal a Diamond in Four Uneasy Lessons), Yates made his best thriller, The Friends of Eddie Coyle (1973). This crime story was as low-key and realistic as its predecessor had been capricious. Robert Mitchum, wonderfully laconic as a small-time hood, headed a brilliant cast. The gritty script, Boston locations and authentic details made it a classic of the genre.\n\nHis next films lacked individuality, suggesting a director for hire. The lumpen comedy For Pete's Sake (1974) starred an ill-at-ease Barbra Streisand, while Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976) made the best of an indifferent screenplay. He then made the underwater saga The Deep, commenting that with Bullitt he had given America the car chase and with The Deep he gave them Jacqueline Bisset in a wet T-shirt.\n\nYates produced and directed Breaking Away from a witty and observant, Oscar-winning screenplay by Steve Tesich. Although the joyous ending was predictable, the charm of its players, the warmth of the relationships and Yates's fine sense of atmosphere made it his most fully achieved work. It brought him his first Oscar nominations for best picture and best director. Yates and Tesich reunited for the intriguing political thriller Eyewitnesss (1981), which was markedly more successful than the sword and sorcery epic Krull (1983), in which special effects and lush sets were no compensation for dull plotting.\n\nYates's versatility was exercised on his return to work in Britain, where he filmed The Dresser (1983). Based on Ronald Harwood's play about his experiences working for the actor-manager Donald Wolfit, the film was a poignant character study of a man (Tom Courtenay) living his life through his exuberant star employer (Albert Finney). Yates was again nominated for best director and best picture Oscars.\n\nThe thriller Suspect (1987) had a starry cast including Cher and Liam Neeson in a routinely effective courtroom drama. A year later Yates produced and directed The House on Carroll Street (1988), another political thriller. Rather far-fetched, it was entertaining in the sub-Hitchcock style that characterised his work in cloak and dagger movies.\n\nHitchcock's The Wrong Man (1956) might be perceived as an influence on the storyline of Yates's next project, An Innocent Man (1989), starring Tom Selleck, which similarly told of wrongful imprisonment and its devastating effect on the victim and his family.\n\nThe sentimental Roommates (1995) was salvaged only by Peter Falk's virtuoso performance, and Yates inspired equally fine work from Finney in the Irish-set The Run of the Country. After the woeful supernatural comedy Curtain Call (1999), Yates returned to television with a lavish production of Don Quixote (2000), adapted by John Mortimer and starring John Lithgow as the eponymous hero, and the coming-of-age drama A Separate Peace (2004), based on John Knowles's novel.\n\nYates, whose lucrative, big-budget movies allowed him to indulge enthusiasms for skiing, tennis and sailing, is survived by Virginia, his son Toby, his daughter Miranda, and two grandchildren."
