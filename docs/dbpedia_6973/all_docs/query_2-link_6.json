Peter Yates directed it to show he could make a film without cars. Why is Mia Farrow in it? The devil must have made her do it.\n\nJohn and Mary is one of those films whose best scene is the first one, with the characters waking up after a night of sex and trying to make sense of where they are.

Of course, this leads them to make their own calculated moves in order to get the upper…"
