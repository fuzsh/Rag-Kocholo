        "text": "For the longest time I thought the titular \"Bullitt\" was the name of the car because the only thing I knew about this film was the famous San Francisco car chase scene. I thought Bullitt was going to be a fun little action movie about an outlaw who loves his car and drives fast like a bullet or something. Turns out I was wrong and \"Bullitt\" is the name of the cop that drives the car. I guess that means the car's actual name is \"Bullitt's Monster.\" A brilliant directorial choice by Yates, to make this film a modernist adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein– though I worry that aspect will be lost on most audiences, as said subtext requires you…\n\nIt's very interesting reading how Steve McQueen, in preparing to play the titular Bullitt, modelled his performance on San Francisco detective Dave Toschi, because of course Toschi was heavily involved in the hunt for the infamously unresolved Zodiac Killer, and later immortalised by Mark Ruffalo in David Fincher's Zodiac - a film which Bullitt reminds me of in a way, despite focusing on very different areas of crime. It wouldn't surprise me if Fincher didn't take a cue from Peter Yates' much earlier film because they both share a deep commitment to portraying the procedural, rigorous elements of the police force. Bullitt is a hard-nosed, near documentarian cop thriller adaptation that gets in, does it's job and gets out, leaving…\n\nOkay, yeah, McQueen is cool. I mean, cool. Enough so to rock that sweater into popularity, sure. (Enough so to be considerate, too.)\n\nMy other thought, you know, besides the car chase being also cool, is that it's interesting how the cowboy cop thing has meandered through our culture. Here, we have a cop who pushes limits, but he's up against a politician, and he does things by the book. At times, this loose cannon trope is more about getting the \"bad guy\" no matter what, meaning in the course of a film (not this film), the cop murders and violates civil rights and whatnot until the random villain is dead or arrested. At other times, the rogue cop is…\n\n74/100\n\n[originally written on my blog]\n\nAstonishing to think that a movie like this could have been a hit once, thrilling car chase or no. (Adjusted for inflation, it grossed roughly $120 mil.) I'd dimly remembered it as being faintly dull whenever hubcaps aren't flying, and now I see why: Yates deliberately flattens everything into a near-autistic level of procedural concentration, creating a stealth character study that grows steadily in power as McQueen's canny non-performance just keeps yielding nothing. That car chase acts as a single enormous spike in an EKG that's otherwise strictly horizontal; even Robert Vaughn's unctuous, interfering pol, last seen perusing the Wall Street Journal in the back of a limo, brushes the movie off his trousers…\n\nPeter Yates's stylish direction, the slick editing and sheer cool factor of Steve McQueen elevate what would otherwise be a somewhat plodding police procedural to greater heights. I don't know if it's the fault of the screenplay or the original novel its adapted from, but the plotting seems unnecessarily convoluted. Whilst Bullitt's nemesis - Robert Vaughn's shady DA - draws out the main theme of politics versus justice, 'two sides of the street', the details were murky. Maybe I'm just being dumb but I found the various plot machinations poorly explicated and the critical reveal revolves around a contrivance that's hard to swallow.\n\nNone of that really matters though when you've got a director who knows how to use McQueen's…\n\nIt starts very slow. Almost leisurely. Replicating the pace of the movie in general. But more on that in a minute.\n\nThe driver of the Charger spots Bullitt's Mustang. Decides to take the upper hand. Follows the detective at a distance. It carries on like that for a moment, but only for a moment. Bullitt turns, drives up a road, the Charger follows.\n\nAt the top of the hill the Mustang isn't in sight. The man in the thick-framed glasses looks both ways. Guesses left. In a moment the Mustang appears. In his rear view mirror. He's the one being followed now.\n\nStill the pace doesn't increase, not quite yet. This is all still prologue.\n\nThen it's a bit faster.…"
