        "text": "Post by teleadm on\n\nBritish-born director who made movies in different genres, but maybe most remembered for car chases through London and San Francisco, and for making bycycle racing popular.\n\nPeter Yates was born 90 years ago, in Aldershot, Hampshire, England.\n\nThe son of an army officer, he attended Charterhouse School as a boy, graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and worked for some years as an actor, director and stage manager. He directed plays in London and New York. He also spent two years as racing manager for Stirling Moss and Peter Collins.\n\nIn the 1950s he started in the film industry doing odd jobs such as dubbing foreign films and editing documentaries. He eventually became a leading assistant director.\n\nHe was an assistant director to Mark Robson on The Inn of the Sixth Happiness 1958, Terence Young on Serious Charge 1959, Terry Bishop on Cover Girl Killer 1959, Guy Hamilton on A Touch of Larceny 1960, Jack Cardiff on Sons and Lovers 1960, Tony Richardson on The Entertainer 1960 and A Taste of Honey 1961, J. Lee Thompson on The Guns of Navarone 1961 and José Quintero on The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone 1961.\n\nThrough the influence of Richardson, he directed Albee's An American Dream and The Death of Bessie Smith at London's Royal Court Theatre.\n\nSummer Holiday 1963 was Yates directorial debut, starring British teen idol Cliff Richard. It was the second most popular movie at the British box office in 1963.\n\nOne Way Pendulum 1965, a comedy movie that was not widely seen.\n\nDuring the mid sixties Yates directed episodes for television, notably The Saint and Danger Man.\n\nRobbery 1967, a fictionalised version of the 1963 Great Train Robbery. a critical and commercial success in Britain, but little seen in America, though Steve McQueen did and was impressed and wanted Yates to direct his next movie.\n\nBullitt 1968, it became the 5th highest-grossing film of 1968.\n\nHere follows the rest of Yates movies, a career of ups and downs:\n\nJohn and Mary 1969, romantic drama starring Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow.\n\nMurphy's War 1971, starring Peter O'Toole.\n\nThe Hot Rock 1972, a heist comedy starring Robert Redford, George Segal, Zero Mostel and others.\n\nThe Friends of Eddie Coyle 1973, gangster drama starring Robert Mitchum.\n\nFor Pete's Sake 1974, a \"screwball\" comedy starring Barbra Streisand and Michael Sarrazin.\n\nMother, Jugs & Speed 1976, a black comedy starring Raquel Welsh, Harvey Kietel and Bob Cosby.\n\nThe Deep 1977, action drama starring Jaqueline Bisset, Nick Nolte and Robert Shaw.\n\nThough critically lambasted, it was a commercial success\n\nBreaking Away 1979, coming-of-age comedy. Yates used the money he had earned from his previous movie to finance this movie to get it started, employng relatively unknown actors at the time. It became the sleeper of the year.\n\nYates was Oscar nominated both as producer and director.\n\nEyewitness 1981, thriller drama starring Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt and Christopher Plummer.\n\nKrull 1983, a lighthearted science-fiction adventure. A huge commercial failure at the time, but has been re-evaluated over the years, reaching cult status.\n\nThe Dresser 1983, drama starring Albert Finney and Tom Courteney.\n\nYates was Oscar nominated both as producer and director.\n\nEleni 1985, starring Kate Nelligan and John Malkovich.\n\nSuspect 1987, a court-room thriller starring Cher, Dennis Quaid and Liam Neeson.\n\nThe House on Carroll Street 1988, thriller starring Kelly McGillis and Jeff Daniels.\n\nAn Innocent Man 1989, drama thriller starring Tom Selleck.\n\nYear of the Comet 1992, comedy adventure starring Tim Daly, Penelope Ann Miller and Louis Jourdan.\n\nThe Run of the Country 1995, romantic drama starring Albert Finney and Matt Keeslar.\n\nRoommates 1995, comedy starring Peter Falk and D.B. Sweeney.\n\nCurtain Call 1998, romantic comedy with ghosts starring James Spader, Polly Walker, Michael Caine and Maggie Smith. It was later re-released under the title It All Came True.\n\nIt was to be Peter Yates' last film made for cinema, although in most markets it went directly to TV or home video.\n\nDon Quixote 2000, made for Hallmark Television, starring John Lithgow.\n\nA Separate Peace 2004 made for television, about the strong friendship between students that slowly turns into bitter rivalry with fatal consequences.\n\nThis was Peter Yates final as director in any filmed medium.\n\nIn his later years he provided audio commentaries for DVD's to a few of his old movies, like Summer Holiday, Bullitt and For Pete's Sake.\n\nPeter Yates left us in 2011, aged 81.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nThoughts, ideas, comments, favorites, lists and anything Peter Yates are as always very welcome!\n\nPost by vegalyra on\n\nFunny, I just picked up Robbery on bluray a few days ago but have yet to watch it. I'm looking forward to it.\n\nBullitt is just a classic. I love this film. I agree that it's much more than a car chase although I'm a car geek so that doesn't hurt... The chase through the tarmac at the closer was copied in Mann's Heat.\n\nMurphy's War is a great \"little\" film just as all the action happens in a fairly small area. One of my more favorite O'Toole films. Wish it had a bluray.\n\nKrull is one of those films I loved as a kid but I just can't watch it today. I even was obsessed with the arcade adaption and got quite good at it back in the day."
