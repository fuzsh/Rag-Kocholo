The car chase came in Bullitt (1968), his first American film, and featured Steve McQueen roaring up and down the hills of San Francisco in pursuit of the men who had killed a witness in his charge.\n\nMounted with great technical skill, and shot on the streets using a lightweight Arriflex camera, the sequence was not only much imitated, to the extent that the car chase soon became a cinema cliché, but it helped to establish Yates at a stroke as one of the leading British directors in Hollywood."
