        "text": "Lots of horror films in this latest chunk as my (and many other fellow film freaks) seasonal Halloween viewings come to a close. Tragic, I know. Another year where I’m reminded that October is my favorite time of the year, not just for that transition into the autumnal bliss that is late-year New England, but because everyone in the online film community is watching, considering, and discussing horror films with the consideration and passion the genre deserves.\n\n#189. This Is the End (2013, Rogen & Goldberg)\n\nCompletely outlandish in its very existence, this is self-indulgence done largely right, a grand scale look at the raunchy things that amuse these actors. It’s also very much about their relationship to fame and friendship. Unsurprisingly, this was not a film I was looking forward to (though I actually really like Seth Rogen and most of these guys for that matter), because as if we need more of this kind of exclusively male club of comedy. It sold me because these guys know how to construct, depict, and exploit their own dynamic for laughs. It even uses an Emma Watson cameo to boldly reveal just why there is no room for women within the group (hint: they can’t see past their own vanity) Simply put, I laughed harder during this than any film I’ve seen in a long time. But it crumbles to pieces in the final third. From stellar set-up to entertaining down-time, the last third goes into spectacle mode, drowning out any of its humanistic remnats with bawdy effects-driven broadness. I don’t like spectacle-driven comedy so unfortunately Rogen & Goldberg’s experiment in meta-examination crosses the finish line in overblown fashion.\n\n#190. Opera (1987, Argento)\n\nFeatures some of the most memorable kill scenes in any horror film I’ve seen, made further abrasive through its unconventional use of metal to contrast a soundtrack otherwise filled with opera. One moment in particular, a gunshot through a keyhole, reaches a state of rare brutal divinity that left me beside myself. Notable for the way Argento reaches into his more experimental side, (about half this film is a playful and genuine accomplishment about the act of seeing) unfortunately leaving the lame non-stories that often accompany giallo on fuller-than-normal display.\n\n#191. The Boxer’s Omen (1983, Chin-Hung Kuei)\n\nHong Kong horror that ranks alongside Hausu and Freaked as the full-stop craziest and most demented films I’ve ever seen. Absolutely loved this because it attains a very peculiar level of being at once extremely over-the-top and silly but also deeply unsettling in the way it spotlights goo, slime, sludge, ooze and the like in relation to the body. There isn’t a ton of blood in The Boxer’s Omen (relatively speaking; I mean yes a crocodile gets cut open, its entrails taken out only to be replaced by a mummified woman which they then stitch into the carcass to reanimate it), but the constant fixation on gook, and then the skeletal, in relation to the body really gets under the skin after awhile. It recalls of an article I once had to read (for what I don’t remember) which discussed these kinds of liquids in relation to the body, mortality, and decay; why these kinds of images get at something indescribable and irreconcilable. In its truly out-there and awesome way, The Boxer’s Omen gets at this with its hokey anything-and-I-mean-anything goes credo.\n\n#192. Magic Magic (2013, Silva)\n\nDeserving of far more than its unfortunate direct-to-DVD fate, Chilean director Sebastian Silva makes an uncomfortable fray into mental collapse. It toes the line between treating Temple’s mental illness as such, staying true to her experience without embellishing too much for genre convention. What I love about Magic Magic is the way that it depicts the group of young people she is surrounded by as assholes. Her experience of them is paranoiac and completely different, and yet the components are all there; her initial isolation justifiably felt. The way Silva balances the social aspect of these off-putting folk and the way Juno Temple (in a fucking great piece of acting) distorts her mindset in relation to them is a different kind of subtle concoction than I’m used to seeing. Michael Cera performance is genuinely creepy-crawly. His natural ineffectual awkwardness is tilted left-of-center for an extremely unsettling character named Brink who seems at the start like he is either one extremely annoying/creepy individual or an outright sociopath. He makes the performance extremely naturalistic and seemingly on-the-fly which is what makes it so effective. But the last third takes a completely nosedive and undoes most of what came before for a blunt and distancing climax that is thrown in with all sense of control removed from every character, not just Temple, resulting in most interest lost. It’s a shame because the first two-thirds features some really strong material, acting, and dynamics through atmosphere and subjectivity created by Silva and Christopher Doyle.\n\n#193. Valley Girl (1983, Coolidge)\n\nI was so hoping to love Valley Girl, but I didn’t even like it. It really all boils down to the fact that there was nothing for me to grasp onto, even in a superficial sense. Except for E.G Daily who should have been in every 80s teen film ever. I expect more craziness from an early Nic Cage performance. Peggy Sue Got Married clearly spoiled me on that front. The soundtrack is great and I find it compelling as a cultural touchstone (was the ‘valley girl’ subculture widespread at this point? still regional? It also seems to both occupy an exaggerated stereotypical space as well as a fairly grounded one) but this was uninteresting in its vapidity.\n\n#194. Zelig (1983, Allen)\n\nA delightful yet somber high concept anomaly from Allen that pushes its themes of neurosis and Jewish identity completely outside of the box. It may deal with ideas of cultural assimilation but that wanting to fit in urge makes it universally relatable. It’s a curious piece of work; not one I fell head over heels for, but one I spent most of my time admiring.\n\nThe technical achievement of Zelig is, well, to be facetious, fuck Gravity. I’m going to spend my time being in awe of what Allen accomplished 30 years ago. He and cinematographer Gordon Willis spent years perfecting a wide variety of techniques getting the newsreel period footage to look accurate from the cameras they used, bluescreen technology, applying damage, etc. It’s absolutely seamless. On a final note, Mia Farrow channeling Liv Ullman is just a lovely thing.\n\n#195. Gothic (1986, Russell)\n\nGothic never comes together as a compellingly over-the-top take on what inspired Mary Shelley to write Frankenstein during her famed stay in Geneva but it does scar you in the way logic quickly disappears from the evening, replaced by Freudian fears and imagery which feel inescapable. There are a lot of images that are going to stay with me from Gothic, none more than the entirety of Timothy Spall as Dr. John Polidori in a feverishly repressed performance that becomes more and more revealingly skinned.\n\n#196. The Dresser (1983, Yates)\n\nI’m not sure I’ve ever seen two more exhausting performances in a film. And I don’t mean this in a good way. The craft of the work is impressive in a sense, with Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay getting double lead actor nods at that year’s Oscars. But both are dialed up to ‘11’ from start to finish. This is ACTING in the most thespian of manners with both playing to the nosebleed sections at all times. It makes for an ineffectively abrasive experience with side effects that include not being able to hear myself think and an inability to appreciate the macabre tone of the piece and the meat of the story. They feed off each other and the basic components of storytelling such as dialogue, direction, and build-up so all that is eventually left is a collection of raving, screaming, hand-wringing, crying, and ineffectual mannerisms.\n\n#197. Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984, Zito)\n\nSurprisingly enjoyable, especially considering I don’t care for this franchise at all. Basically it comes down to Crispin ‘dead fuck’ Glover, whose presence elevates every single scene with the group of teenagers to something damn near holy. I also greatly enjoyed Corey Feldman and his origin story-of-sorts as well as the family unit in general, all of which makes for a relatively fun slasher.\n\n#198. From Beyond (1986, Gordon)\n\nSay hello to one of my new favorite films because From Beyond is kind of the greatest. A follow-up to Re-Animator with outrageously disgusting (and thus awesome) practical effects work, a purple-pink color scheme you won’t soon forget, the perfect lead trifecta of Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, and Ken Foree and so much more. These are the kinds of films we have to cherish because they don’t really exist in this particular combination anymore. You feel the work and the personal touch amidst and within the way the story’s limits are pushed on. It is at once ridiculous yet darker in tone than Re-Animator. I love the Combs/Crampton role reversal and the ways in which each embody their characters. Lastly, the ending is a perfect moment to close on, one of a series of stellar endings in the horror films I’ve been watching lately. Basically, yes to everything about From Beyond.\n\n#199. Asylum (1972, Baker)\n\nSilly anthology film with an absurd, and thus fantastic, framing story. Most of the vignettes are flat and undercooked and at least one is outright boring (despite the presence of Charlotte Rampling and Britt Ekland). However, there is something to latch onto for each segment whether the crinkly sound of a head wrapped in paper, the empathy Peter Cushing is able to bring to anything, or Herbert Lom’s army of automatons.\n\n#200. Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982, Wallace)\n\nOne of those horror films that seems like it would improve exponentially in a crowd setting. I really love Carpenter’s idea about making Halloween an anthology franchise. It’s something that should have been implemented right after the first one. I’m weirdly fond of this even though I can’t say I liked it all that much as a whole. The leads are laughably miscast (oh Atkins and your manly man ways) and there are whole sections that fail to stir the imagination or even the basic attention a film asks of a viewer. But then there is a moment or a shot that would take me by genuine surprise every fifteen minutes or so. These bursts of creative or, at the very least, violent flair uprooted me enough to feel oddly fond of it. It is completely removed from the rest of the franchise with a Twilight Zone-esque story that is deceptively offbeat. Its best moments genuinely fucked with my head and it ends on an impossibly high note, a horror movie capper for the ages, that I walked away from it giddy, severe warts and all.\n\n#201. The Right Stuff (1983, Kaufman)\n\nLooks at the the mythmaking hero by contrasting the idealized and unrecognized sage cowboy with the manufactured boyish build-up and media frenzy (the press are portrayed as a pack of fiendish animals complete with snake hissing and rattling on the soundtrack) of the Mercury Seven (miraculously without actually denigrating the men or their accomplishments). It takes a conventional model of the rah-rah USA historical film and does something very astute with it.\n\nThis is a surprising film in so many ways. I often found myself amazed by the way it takes on different sections of story, not worrying so much how it relates to the rest but concentrating all energy on making the section at hand seem front-and-center. I think of, for example, how much time we spent on the testing done for all Mercury Seven candidates. This section is treated as its own entity seemingly without the before or after in sight (of course it is), so you get distinctly wrapped up in each portion on its own terms. So during the testing section, while there a concentration on the ongoing theme of the childish one-uppmanship between comrades, there is also a vignette-like dynamic between Dennis Quaid and the cold nurse in charge of testing. It bears no storytelling drive to anything but itself, and for those ten minutes it becomes the entirety of content within the film. That’s just one of the many reasons and examples on why The Right Stuff gathers impact as it accumulates history, moments, and the idea of myth within American history. It smartly starts at the roots, with the test pilots and with Yeager, portrayed as incomparable forefather of everything that follows.\n\nI’ve come to realize that nobody does vulnerability better than Dennis Quaid in his heyday. His hotdog hotshot persona and endless smile, whether in roles squeaky-clean or rough around the edges, belies an open heart I often find myself extremely moved by. See also; Breaking Away.\n\n#202. In the Mouth of Madness (1994, Carpenter)\n\nTruly the most inescapable fictional scenario of them all. There are many ways to interpret this film, because its events are so tenuous and loopy. But I took it as the meta-trap it presents as the very non-existent reality. Characters have no agency in the sense of their fiction and creation. In the Mouth of Madness throws this in the mix which is an inescapable mind warp for everyone involved. Carpenter filters his deceptively simple methods into something increasingly unnerving. It has stuck with me really well and the end (completing my streak in incredible endings) is one of the best ever. Ever. EVER.\n\n#125. The Friends of Eddie Coyle (1973, Yates)\n\nRelentlessly melancholic film where chess pieces are moved through quiet back-dealings and dialogue exchanges infused with ever-maneuvering fatalism. Peter Yates’ camera gets deep into the grubby everydayness parts of Boston and its surrounding towns. Having lived in Boston during graduate school, seeing and recognizing the location work here was a high point. The camera acts as eavesdropper, always cautiously close to the proceedings. We see all relevant players and how they connect to each other and we’re never given a true access point. Because of this the film took a while to get into. But as it progressed, I found myself engaged. Robert Mitchum does some of his best work but my personal favorite was Steven Keats as gunrunner Jackie Brown (obviously Tarantino is a fan), with his neon green ride and considerable street instinct.\n\n#126. The Driver (1978, Hill)\n\nWalter Hill takes the stripped-down moral code, business-only characters and sparse dialogue of Jean-Pierre Melville and marries it into American crime films. Here is an instance of ‘using Melville as a prototype of cool to build off of’ which I mentioned in my thoughts on Le Cercle Rouge. The characters don’t have names; they are defined by their predominant role within the narrative; ‘The Driver’, ‘The Detective’, ‘The Player’. Dialogue is minimal, especially on Ryan O’Neal’s end, who speaks only when it’s essential and even then in as few words as possible. These characters seem to exist only within this scenario; Adjani’s character is the only one who talks about her past, or anything personality-driven, albeit briefly. These people are fused into a world where the rules are laid out. We respect The Driver because he never breaks his code within the lawless criminal world. We don’t respect The Detective because he does break his code, that being the law that he works for.\n\nO’Neal basically replicates that Melville idea of ideal cool, which would then be replicated and slightly modified by, to name an obvious example, Ryan Gosling in Drive (as well as much of the film). Someone who is stoic, who never sweats, knows the score, and is always in control even when he’s not. It’s a type of masculine fantasy that always has a level of masturbatory wish fulfillment to it, yes with Melville too. But! it’s a preferred mode of idealized masculine cool over other oppositional hothead macho types. Though Hill tries to push Isabelle Adjani into the uncomfortable femme fatale role, I found myself saying ‘good on her’, as I tend to do when the women we’re supposed to see as bottom of the barrel for daring to betray men go on and do just that.\n\nThe Driver’s makeup is a bit less interesting than its whole. Far and away my favorite parts are the car chase scenes, full of skidding and squealing tire with front-view and rear-view shots from the cars involved. The street lights look like floating orbs and the gleam of the road give the visuals a finishing shine. Few things satisfy me more than a great cinematic car chase. The Driver has a couple of them.\n\n127. Thief (1981, Mann)\n\n1980’s American filmmaking gets an early peak with one of the most electrifying debuts ever made. Where The Driver and Le Cercle Rouge are atmosphere-driven studies in the controlled ‘cool’ of masculinity within criminal activity, Thief comes striking out from the opposite direction. It is the character study of Frank, ex-convict hothead and maker of his own destiny. His dream life exists in crumply collage form. In prison he was forced to attain a state of mind where time didn’t exist, where investment in one’s own life disappears. Now he wants a wife, children, a wealthy lifestyle. When he’s got those he’ll retire. But he’s spent enough time in prison and has to make up for lost time. He’s going to hightail his success through sped-up propositions and heisting skills learned in the cooler thanks to surrogate papa Willie Nelson. Its all over for Frank the minute he compromises his code, his independence.\n\nThere are so many things to talk about with Thief. Like the title supports, Thief defines and introduces Frank by his criminal occupation. The brand of heist work depicted in the film strives above all for authenticity and the hard-edged industrial machinery that parallels Frank’s rough-and-tough masculine nature.\n\nI can quickly get bored/unnerved of studies in hotheadedness, mainly because there are countless films that explore this type of man and at a certain point it just gets tiresome. For a girl like me, dick measuring gets extremely uncool and boring immediately if there’s nothing to support it. And to be sure I wasn’t exactly a fan of Frank. But the minute understanding of his psychology and the fact that this is without a doubt James Caan’s best performance makes it work.\n\nMichael Mann streaks the canvas with nightlights establishing his now well-known aesthetic right off the bat. He takes the glowing orbs and gleaming streets of Walter Hill’s nighttime and pushes it into an abstract realm where streetlights become fuzzy blurs and streets are always wet so light and color bounces off of the frame creating endless mixing pools. There is so much going on in his nighttime compositions and I spent a lot of time simply looking at the textures Mann was able to create.\n\nThe use of daytime and nighttime are used as a battleground for Frank’s hopes and realities. We begin with a lot of nighttime scenes but once Frank starts to fill in those missing domestic pieces, getting closer to what he wants his life to be, the film shifts to mostly daytime. By the end when it all (as it must go) slips through his fingers, he is dragged back into the alleys, the seedy dark. We end in the middle at ground zero. At night in a domestic setting; Leo’s house. With the only way men like this know how to settle scores; with firearms and bloodshed.\n\nSo with a neo-noir film about a guy like Frank made by Michael Mann of course the woman is a mere appendage. Something to acquire. Luckily, though this is her role, that objectifying is used to make a point about Frank’s psychology, by acknowledging the quickened and put-upon circumstances, which is at least better than this being the case without it serving any other means. And Tuesday Weld’s Jessie does get to participate in arguably the film’s highlight. That remarkable mammoth of a diner scene.\n\nThe Tangerine Dream score (one of about a billion things Drive lifts from this film but that’s not news to anybody) gives everything a hypnotic New Wave underscored hum. In a scene like the final heist, where close-ups of molten bliss combine with the electronic score and a hyper-attention to the process of thievery, Thief enters a separate standalone realm outside of its own story.\n\n#128. Body Heat (1981, Kasdan)\n\nThe quintessential postmodern noir in its direct inspiration from certified classic Double Indemnity and taking sexual foreplay through wordplay into the bedroom for some longtime coming release. The best femme fatale populated noirs where sexual tension provided energetic fuel still surpass the steaminess we see in Body Heat. But Body Heat is still damn steamy (those wind chimes! Hurt breaking through the door! Turner just standing there!) and writer/director Lawrence Kasdan even gives the sex a backdrop of Florida heat wave. There’s a washed out glow to the visuals whether drenched in sun, fog, or sweat.\n\nIt would just be a well-executed salacious throwback if not for William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. Hurt is the perfect womanizing stooge. You even feel kind of bad for him…actually, no you don’t. Kathleen Turner, in her film debut (!), husks it up. You get it. You just get it. She sells Matty’s supposed sincerity, her one-of-a-kind lure. The ambiguous ending is a highlight and it was nice to see a to-the-victor-goes-the-spoils end to the femme fatale for once. I’m still waiting to see a film told from the woman’s point-of-view that actually commends or at least complexifies their decision to dupe and manipulate sad sacks as opposed to simply representing the ultimate threat for men. But this was still a nice update. Matty is fabulous.\n\nBody Heat is solid all-around. I added it to the end of my neo-noir set once I realized none of my choices took on femme fatale-driven noir. Plus, seeing Body Heat had been a long time coming anyhow.\n\n#128. The Love Goddesses (1965, Turell)\n\nA really basic introduction to the types of women in American film’s various phases up through 1965. Lots of generalizations and clips that go on for far too long, this was interesting but flat.\n\n#130. Frances Ha (2013, Baumbach)\n\nNoah Baumbach revisits the comical sharpness of his roots and the result is a youthful and delectable collaboration with new squeeze Greta Gerwig. Baumbach is an all-time favorite director of mine, and though I’m a massive fan of his more polarizing works, it’s nice to see that Gerwig’s involvement brings him around full circle to the Kicking and Screaming quarterlife crisis territory. More specifically, this one is about the intricacies and intimacies of female friendship and the slow emergence of self-aware maturity. And it ties the two together beautifully.\n\nThere are very few films, in the grand scheme of things, that are actually about the complex nature of intimate female friendship. All of us women have these friends in our lives; it’s a singular thing full of competitiveness, comfort, self-comparison, support, undying love and memories. Frances’ world basically starts to fall apart once her best friend moves out and the splinter effect takes hold. She’s too busy talking about getting her life together, judging her own life solely through the context of Sophie’s and unwilling to compromise herself in her own deluded fashion. It’s a tough thing to make a living as an artist, yes even if you come from a white middle-class place of privilege. As one character astutely and accurately points out, pursuing the arts in NYC to begin with is only an option for the rich (the reveal that Benji is writing a spec script for Gremlins 3 had me in near-tears). Frances has to realize that you do what you can when you can do it and that it takes time. Everyone else around you who says they have their shit together are putting on a show.\n\nFrances Ha has a makeshift flighty structure completely coated in French New Wave sensibilities. It’s comprised of equal parts full scenes and montage where exchanges and moments are pared down to their minimum for maximum effect. It paints a fairy tale-like picture where the underlying sadness of it all can be overcome because let’s face it, the only thing holding her back from putting her best foot forward is herself. She makes some poor decisions along the way in order to live in the past and retain a sense of control but they are ill-advised. Has there been a more pitiful Paris excursion in film?\n\nGreta Gerwig is the fuel, driving it forward in facial tics, dopey interactions, awkward overcompensation and a sunny infectious energy. If you aren’t a fan, boy oh boy are you out of luck. She is this film. The reliably static camera keeps on her as we watch Frances try and commit to moments.\n\nFrances Ha is a reminder of how just purely satisfying Baumbach can be with his collaborative skills, relentless ear for dialogue and master of the art of modern social exchange. This would make an excellent double feature with Walking and Talking.\n\nTwo final notes: – Dean and Britta (!) show up again here and this time they have lines! I have to admit this was extremely distracting for me and I think I missed a lot of that long dinner scene because I was too busy gaping happily at the two of them. – I know we’re all justifiably fawning over the usage of “Modern Love” (though knowing there’s another usage featuring Denis Lavant out there makes me salivating for the latter), but can we stop for a second and appreciate the multiple usage of Hot Chocolate’s “Every 1’s a Winner”?"
