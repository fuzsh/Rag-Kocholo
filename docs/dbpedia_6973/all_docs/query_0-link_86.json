But film makers are usually much more concerned with making an entertaining film rather than a historically accurate depiction. The films I suggest here will, I think, give some insight into the periods studied in modern history courses, but they are far from perfect!\n\nIn general, I recommend seeing foreign language films in the original language with subtitles rather than dubbed into English. [Try watching John Wayne dubbed into French someday - and you'll see why dubbing almost never works.]\n\nWhat seems to be accurate in the film? What sources are you using to assess accuracy?\n\nIn what ways does the film impact your reading of any of the documents you have been assigned in this course.\n\nWhat liberties does the film take with the past? Why?\n\nIs the film primarily entertainment, or is it really trying to work within a historical period? How can you determine the film maker's intention?\n\nIs the film primarily entertainment, or is it really trying to work within a historical period? How can you determine the film maker's intention?\n\nWhat, if any, modern point is the film trying make?\n\nMy essay Thinking about Historical Film (PDF) or here (HTML) may be of interest for readers of this web page.\n\nNotes\n\nBy \"clicking\" on the title of the movie, you will be taken to the Internet Movie Database record on that movie.\n\nMovies are in English unless otherwise noted.\n\nOther Lists like this\n\nWikipedia: List of historical films set in Near Eastern and Western civilization\n\nWikipedia: List of historical films set in Asia\n\nIMDb: List of Movies Concerning the History and Literature of the Colonial and Revolutionary Period (1600-1800AD)\n\nIMDb: List of Movies Concerning the History and Literature of the 19th Century\n\nThe Roots of Western Culture\n\nEuropean Expansion and Colonization\n\nChristopher Columbus 1985 (TV)\n\nDir.

William Dieterle, With Paul Muni\n\nOn the life of the great French liberal writer, and his involvement in the Dreyfus affaire. It won Oscar as best film in 1938. Although it alters history to some extent, it is well worth viewing. (Specifically: Zola's love life is cleaned up; his early career is heavily fictionalized; and portions of his \"J'accuse\" letter become courtroom speeches.) The major problem is that, except for one fleeting reference, the film completely avoids that central issue of Anti-Semitism in the Dreyfus affair.\n\nBack to Index\n\nThe 19th Century: The Nationalist Dream\n\nThe Leopard [aka Il Gattopardo] 1963 205/165 mins cut\n\nDir.

With Liam Nelson\n\nSet in the 1920s, but just about the best film on Nationalism and Nationalists. Americans might find the accents tough going, but for those who know anything about Irish history, this is an excellent film.\n\nBack to Index\n\nThe 19th Century in America\n\nAmistad\n\nDir. Steven Spielberg., Wiith Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins,Djimon Hounsou\n\nThis film represented Steven Spielberg's response to what happened at a showing to young people in Los Angeles of Schindler's List - some of them laughed. In trying to understand why, Spielberg evolved this project on the Amistad revolt.\n\nGlory 1989 122 mins\n\nDir. Edward Zwick. With Denzel Washington\n\nHighly praised account of Black soldiers in the US Civil War.\n\nThe Day Lincoln was Shot TV 1998 95mins\n\nDir. John Gray\n\nCitizen Kane 1941 119mins\n\nDir. Orson Welles\n\nPerhaps the most widely praised of all Hollywood movies, and not usually thought of as a history movie. Nevertheless, as an account of Golden Age capitalism, there is something for this.\n\nAmerica America 1963\n\nDir. Elia Kazan\n\nThe story of a Greek immigrant in America. The director was widely reviled for cooperating with McCarthy.\n\nBack to Index\n\nThe Socialist Analysis\n\nRosa Luxemburg 1986\n\nDir.

Michael Curtiz. With Erol Flynn\n\nThe story is mostly set in India, with detestation of an Indian princes atrocities inspiring the final charge. The real destruction of horses shown -- using trip wires -- began the moevment to protect animals during filming. The movie is historically inaccurate, and focuses on racial distrust. The actual final charge scene is very effective.\n\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade (1968) 145mins\n\nDir. Tony Richardson, With Trevor Howard and Vanessa Redgrave.\n\nA much more accurate historical account by a british director. As might be expected, unlike the racial motifs of the US film, social class is the major factor here.\n\nFitzcarraldo 1982 158mins\n\nDir. Werner Herzog, With Klaus Kinski\n\nAn opera lover builds an Opera house in Manaus.\n\nShaka Zulu 1987 300mins.\n\nThe life and rise to power of Shaka, the greatest Zulu king.\n\nZulu Dawn 1969 115mins\n\nDir.

Basil Dearden, Eliot Elisofon, With Charlton Heston and Laurence Olivier (as the Mahdi)\n\nGeneral Gordon and the Mahdi never met face to face, but they do in this film.\n\nOut of Africa 1985\n\nDir. Sydney Pollack. With Meryl Streep, Klaus Brandauer\n\nIsak Dinesen's life in 1910's Kenya.\n\nBlack and White in Color [aka Noirs et blancs en couleur] 1976.\n\nDir.

Ashutosh Gowarika,With Amir Khan,\n\nAn Indian film about British imperialism and a village uniting to resist the land tax (lagaan). The film is interesting in that, unlike even British movies that are critical of the Raj, it is not at all nostalgic about British rule. It is nostalgic, on the other hand, for an India where religious and communal divsions were rejected in favor of the fight against the Empire.\n\nBack to Index\n\nCultural Anxiety\n\nSong of Bernardette 1943\n\nDir. Henry King (I), With Jennifer Jones,\n\nJennifer Jones won an Oscar for her portrayal of the Catholic girl who claimed to have a vision of a \"beautiful lady\" at Lourdes.

John Brahm.\n\nAn account of the 1917 apparitions of the Virgin Mary to three children at Fatima in Portugal. Extremely sentimental -- it makes Song of Bernardette look like realist cinema.\n\nBack to Index\n\nWorld War I\n\nMayerling 1968, 127 mins.\n\nDir. Terence Young, With Omar Sherif and Catherine Deneuve.\n\nThe downfall of the Hapsburg family is connected to the the personal tragedy of Crown Prince Prince Rudolph. The story focuses on the lead up to the great scandal of 1889, when Prince Rudolph took his teenage mistress,Baroness Maria Vetsera, to a hunting lodge called \"Mayerling,\" where both were to end up dead. The film now looks very dated.\n\nOberst Redl 1985 [aka Colonel Redl][In German]\n\nDir. IstvÃ¡n SzabÃ³. With Klaus Maria Brandauer\n\n-Based on a play by John Osbourne, this film looks at the corrupt nature of the Austrian army and state on the eve of World War I.

Stanely Kubrick. With Kirk Douglas\n\nA coutroom movie [compare with Breaker Morant]. The futility and irony of the war in the trenches in WWI is shown as a unit commander in the French army must deal with the mutiny of his men and a glory-seeking general after part of his force falls back under fire in an impossible attack.\n\nSee also summary [with spoilers] at filmsite\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front 1930\n\nDir.
