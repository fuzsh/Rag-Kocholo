        "text": "By 1973, Barbra Streisand was strategizing about her next film role. She had just come out of two back-to-back drama films: Up the Sandbox , which was made by her production company, First Artists; and The Way We Were for her Funny Girl producer Ray Stark. For her next film, Barbra was looking for some lighter material.\n\nBarbra’s manager, Marty Erlichman, was also looking to produce his first film. In April 1973, it was reported that they were considering a property called With or Without Roller Skates for Paramount Pictures. With Marty producing, Streisand would play a New York nurse who worked in war veterans’ hospitals. “Barbra and I met with the nurse from the book twice,” Erlichman told the press. “She is a fascinating woman – hilariously funny and very realistic about her running battle with hospital authorities over what she considers the rights of her patients.”\n\nBut by June, it looked like Marty and Barbra had settled on a film comedy unfortunately titled July Pork Bellies.\n\nWith a screenplay developed specifically for Barbra’s talents by Stanley Shapiro and Maurice Richlin, Erlichman told the press, “Barbra will play a cab driver's wife who becomes terribly involved in money matters and other things when she tries to help him, after he's invested in pork bellies on the futures commodities market, in an effort to better their lives,” he stated. “The picture may be shot here in New York, but that hasn't been decided.”\n\nShapiro, who was set to co-produce July Pork Bellies with Erlichman, won an Academy Award for the Doris Day film Pillow Talk, which he shared with his writing partner, Richlin.\n\nErlichman took the picture to Ray Stark at Columbia Pictures where Barbra had made Funny Girl. “I felt more secure; that everything was being looked after, since it was my first picture as line producer,” Erlichman said. “So, Stanley and I coproduced it under Ray’s auspices.”\n\nBritish director Peter Yates was hired to helm July Pork Bellies . Yates had impressed audiences in 1968 with the big car chase he staged for his film, Bullitt. Yates said Barbra & Marty “wanted to make a comedy where she didn’t sing. Because up until now she’d only made films where she had to sing because people felt that’s why people went to see Barbra Streisand. So, the whole idea of this film was that she never sing.”\n\nJoseph Maher was cast as Henrietta’s first date, Mr. Coates – the man who wanted to pretend he was the T.V. repairman, and who ended up getting hit in the nose when Henrietta struggled too hard. He recalled rehearsing the scene with Streisand, who “kept asking me, ‘What do you think of this? How do you think that can be improved;’ Well, I didn’t want to say anything, but she said, ‘No, no, don’t worry. What do you think?’ So, I gave her some suggestions, and she calls over to Peter Yates, ‘Hey, he thinks we should do this!’ and I thought that was just hilarious. The bit about my having an icepack on my nose when I leave her apartment – that was one of my ideas.”\n\n“I’d been very impressed by Barbra in What’s Up Doc? ,” Peter Yates said. “I’d wanted to have her hair cut because up until now she’d always had that long, long hair, and she’d always worn—except in What’s Up Doc?—clothes that hid her figure. This was really because Barbra does like to eat, I’m glad to say. But I wanted her to show off her figure because she has, basically, a very good figure. And I also felt she was going to look much younger and much more attractive with a short haircut.”\n\nStreisand saw the exact hairstyle she wanted to wear in the movie when she was at a party thrown by her friend Mitzie Welch. “Well,” Welch said, “before the party I had had my hair done at a chic beauty salon in Beverly Hills owned and run by Jon Peters. So had Donna Korman.”\n\nDonna Korman, married to the comedy actor Harvey Korman from The Carol Burnett Show , was spotlighted in several West Coast newspapers in a photo in which she wore “the butterfly hairdo,” created by hairdresser Jon Peters. The newspapers reported that Peters’ “clientele numbers among the top screen stars in the country, created the closely-cropped hairstyle that he says will lead the way for short styles for the next two years.”\n\n“I called myself Henry for the character,” Streisand explained. “Short for Henrietta. The hair was perfect—half an inch all over the head. Meanwhile, I got a message from a friend that Jon Peters wanted to meet me.”\n\nJon Peters was a maverick – an entrepreneur who, at 28 years old, had opened a successful chain of high-end beauty parlors in Beverly Hills, Encino and Woodland Hills, California. According to reports at the time, the parlors grossed $100,000 a week and Peters had acquired an impressive list of Hollywood clients.\n\nPeters recalled, “[Barbra] told me she was doing For Pete’s Sake and she wanted a new style for her hair. That was easy because I was good and I could do that for her. Then we started talking about the clothes she’d be wearing in the film. She showed me some pictures of them, and I said I didn’t think much of them. ‘I hate them, too,’ she said. ‘Okay, let’s go shopping,’ I said. Two days later, I picked her up in my car and we went shopping. We bought the clothes together and after that I used to go on the set with her. For four months we worked together, and we became closer and closer. First in a work sense, then in a total way.”\n\n“She was going through a phase where she wanted to wear muumuus,” Peter Yates said. “And I found Jon extremely helpful because he helped persuade Barbra that she in fact could look marvelous in jeans and tighter clothes.”\n\nPeters ended up styling a short wig for Streisand to wear in the film and also received screen credit for it. Their personal and professional relationship produced Barbra’s Butterfly album as well as the 1976 blockbuster film she made with Peters, A Star is Born.\n\nFor Pete’s Sake has a title sequence at the beginning of the movie. Streisand sings an up tempo theme song that plays over a cute, animated sequence in which Barbra is a cartoon character.\n\nPeter Yates stated, “This film … well, it’s fun. It was made for fun, we had fun making it, and you can tell by the fact we start with cartoons that it’s not to be taken seriously.”\n\nPete ’s theme song was composed by Artie Butler with lyrics by Mark Lindsay, and Streisand sang the song. Despite the desire to have Streisand in a film in which she did not sing, “They couldn’t resist having her sing the song under the titles,” laughed Peter Yates, “and I’m glad she did, I think it’s a lovely song.”\n\nArtie Butler recalled, “I wanted to write a much more contemporary song for the main title, but the producers needed to have ‘For Pete’s Sake’ in there. I tried to explain to them that ‘For Pete’s Sake’ wasn’t a contemporary phrase to use in the title song, but they wanted it. I remember specifically playing the song for Barbra, and she said to me, ‘I know the records you’ve made, and I know ‘For Pete’s Sake’ shouldn’t be there. I know it and you know it, right?’ I said, ‘Right.’ I remember her saying it with a smile … Working with her is many times a challenge and always a thrill.”\n\nThe animation was created by Sandy Dvore, an Emmy-winning logo and title designer best known for the title animation on TV’s The Partridge Family .\n\nThe song “For Pete’s Sake” has never been commercially released, nor has it appeared on a Streisand album or collection."
