        "text": "SATURDAY NIGHT AT THE MOVIES – I thought I had seen every possible permutation of World War II film until I happened upon director Peter Yates’ tense, exciting “Murphy’s War” (1971) starring Peter O’Toole. This is a very cool story. In the final days of the war, O’Toole plays the only survivor of a U-Boat attack on a British freighter in the Caribbean. Not only does the sub sink Murphy’s ship, but the U-Boat commander (a youthful Horst Janson) orders the survivors machine-gunned in the water. Murphy somehow survives, makes it to shore, and starts a one man counter-offensive against the Germans. Murphy has three compatriots on the island – Sian Phillips plays Hayden, a kindly lady doctor (and O’Toole’s wife at the time), Brezan, a French ferry operator and dock foreman, and a Grumman Duck – a float plane that was originally attached to the sunken freighter, shot down by the Germans, and refurbished by Murphy. The Duck is a full-fledged character in the story, and Murphy and Brezan’s efforts to use it against the U-boat is captured in great detail. I enjoyed this movie very much. O’Toole is terrific, the story is nail-biting and Yates’ direction is on target. Also, a cool nod to stunt pilot Frank Tallman who flew the Duck to glory. Stay safe."
