I’m sure we’ll know more tomorrow as more information is made available.\n\nWhile you can’t currently stream Friends Of Eddie Coyle (we’ll be covering the film very soon on the podcast) on Netflix Watch Instantly, they do currently have all of these available to watch right now, if you’re in the mood to celebrate this fantastic director, and remember him fondly:\n\nBreaking Away\n\nCurtain Call\n\nThe Deep\n\nThe Hot Rock\n\nJohn And Mary\n\nKrull\n\nSuspect"
