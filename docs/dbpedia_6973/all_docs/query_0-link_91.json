The new drama, which follows a gay romance over several decades, is the first TV series created by the Oscar-winning writer of “Philadelphia.” - New York Times\n\n\"A complex, intimate, captivating and visually stunning portrait of anguish and desire, “Fellow Travelers” is an expansive tale set primarily at the height of the U.S. government’s war on communists, “subversives” and “sexual deviants” and ending amid the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s. What begins as a helpless attraction and intense lust transforms into a lifetime of longing that never has a chance at a happy ending.\" - Variety\n\nOscar and Emmy nominee Ron Nyswaner has been writing and producing film and television drama for over thirty years, while documenting LGBTQ history in the second half of the twentieth century.

Moderated by Jason Fine, editor of Rolling Stone.\n\nLITTLE RICHARD: I AM EVERYTHING tells the story of the Black queer origins of rock n' roll, exploding the whitewashed canon of American pop music to reveal the innovator -- the originator -- Richard Penniman. Through a wealth of archive and performance that brings us into Richard's complicated inner world, the film unspools the icon's life story with all its switchbacks and contradictions. In interviews with family, musicians, and cutting-edge Black and queer scholars, the film reveals how Richard created an art form for ultimate self-expression, yet what he gave to the world he was never able to give to himself. Throughout his life, Richard careened like a shiny cracked pinball between God, sex and rock n' roll. The world tried to put him in a box, but Richard was an omni being who contained multitudes — he was unabashedly everything.\n\n\"As well as making a convincing case for Little Richard’s pioneering songwriting, Cortes’s film also offers a fascinating take on his role as a cultural revolutionary.\" — Daily Express\n\n\"Does an impressive job of reminding us how much generations of rock stars, from Tom Jones to Mick Jagger, Elton John and Prince, have owed to Little Richard, and how radical his presence was in a world not yet ready to pay for his talent.\" — Observer UK\n\nAward-winning director and producer Lisa Cortés generates bold, explosive art that shines light on important stories hidden from view. Little Richard: I Am Everything (CNN Films), which she directed and produced, had its world premiere in January 2023 as the opening night selection in the US documentary competition at the Sundance Film Festival. Also premiering at Sundance was Invisible Beauty, the documentary about Black fashion industry pioneer Bethann Hardison, which she produced. In June 2023, The Space Race (National Geographic Documentary Films) premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. Cortés directed and produced this gripping saga of African-American astronauts at NASA and in space. Cortés founded her own production company, Cortés Filmworks, and is committed to telling complex, powerful stories from new perspectives and elevating the talent often overlooked by the mainstream.\n\nView Event →\n\nHoliday Shopping at Woodstock Film Festival!\n\nGreat holiday gifts for film lovers.

Yet there is beauty in the daily rituals – sweeping water over a tiled floor becomes poetic, birds in flight lift us up, a giggling baby gives a moment of relief from the daily battles families endure. “The injustice of oppression can be felt everywhere,” says one father, symbolic of the hundreds of thousands of people living in the most difficult of circumstances in contemporary Lebanon. Impossible choices are made under immense pressure: your young daughter promised as a bride, the inability to secure healthcare for your dying child, having to send your 8-year-old son to work rather than get an education. Yet this film highlights the incredible power of love. At the end we are left with hope for the next generation. - Sabina Barach\n\nView Event →\n\nHer Story: Empowered & Engaged\n\nA symposium bringing together five film initiatives in the region that work to empower, celebrate and elevate female-identifying and non-binary folks in the film industry.\n\nHUDSY,Moonshot Initiative,Stockade Works,UPWIFT, and theWoodstock Film Festival will each present about their organizations, some of their past work, and the opportunities that each provides to engage with and encourage the continued expansion of diversity in the industry.\n\nWe will end with a Q&A and some time for networking and connecting.\n\nView Event →\n\nWFF Live Online Auction\n\nThe Woodstock Film Festival is celebrating 25 years of nurturing and supporting independent filmmakers from near and far, sharing their creative voices to promote diversity, community, culture, educational opportunities and economic growth.\n\nItems include:\n\nLunch for Two with Fisher Stevens\n\nRenowned Animator Bill Plympton’s Original Artwork of the 2023 WFF Poster\n\nVirtual Meditation Session with Emmy-Award Winning Actor Michael Imperioli\n\nPrivate Acting Lesson or Private Cello Lesson with Golden-Globe winner, actress, musician Lori Singer\n\nNow is your chance to not only experience these unique opportunities, but to do it knowing you are helping support the Woodstock Film Festival's mission.
