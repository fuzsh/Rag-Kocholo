        "text": "Between AIP’s THE SAGA OF THE VIKING WOMEN AND THEIR VOYAGE TO THE WATERS OF THE GREAT SEA SERPENT (1957); DR. STRANGELOVE OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB (1963); OH DAD, POOR DAD, MOMMA’S HUNG YOU IN THE CLOSET AND I’M FEELING SO SAD (1966) and THE EFFECTS OF GAMMA RAYS ON MAN-IN-THE-MOON MARIGOLDS (1972), the film that holds its own in the longest title ever sweepstakes might be WHO IS HARRY KELLERMAN AND WHY IS HE SAYING THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT ME? from 1971. In William Froug’s essential book of interviews, “The Screenwriter Looks At The Screenwriter” Nunnally Johnson (THE THREE FACES OF EVE; THE DIRTY DOZEN) says, “I don’t care how good a movie is, if it has a title like WIHKAWIHSTTTAM? I know that fellow is not a secure man who wrote that.”\n\nWell, he has one point but playwright Herb Gardner (A THOUSAND CLOWNS) probably did not consider his jangled script “secure” when he wrote and co-produced this rarely-seen or screened 1971 Cinema Center Films release, a late lamented production company from CBS in the heyday of New Cinema. Stylishly helmed by the unique stage director, Ulu Grosbard, the very theatrical writing of Gardner combined with Grosbard’s obvious love for actors makes this a very New York Off-Broadway movie. I’m enamored of its crisp early 70’s look, featuring sleek penthouse production design by Harry Horner and well-shot by the one of the best City Grit chroniclers, Victor J. Kemper (THE HOSPITAL; DOG DAY AFTERNOON). Along with the cool credits, there are vivid, memorable character moments among an elliptical, distant, languid film that received scant praise upon release and another fallen through the reels of time. Until now.\n\nThe story is classic 8 1/2 cinematic metaphoric, dealing with the suicidal breakdown of songwriting superstar George Soloway and his hunt for one “Harry Kellerman,” an invisible foe causing havoc in his personal life, sending Soloway on a fantasia through his past and future with his psychiatrist Dr. Moses (Jack Warden) as guide. We watch George go from cynical hit-maker louging in a Manhattan skyscraper and back to idealistic troubador strumming on the “E” train. Ulu Grosbard is an intelligent director who lets scenes breathe, possibly to the detriment of a certain rhythm here, but that could also be due to the stagey dialogue (“I was 18 and knew how to live forever”) that favors repetition for effect and pop quips for depth. I find the ending too easy and oblique, but hey, it was the 70’s, man.\n\nWIHKAWIHSTTTAM? is more sedate than you might imagine given the subject matter and my main critique is that Soloway doesn’t represent an actual cultural persona or attitude. He writes army marches, protest songs and ad jingles yet is somehow seen as a “man of the people.” Gardner has deliberately or unintentionally fudged any real pop or rock sensibility with a broad theatricality that probably worked against the film’s success. The songs by Shel Silverstein aren’t all that memorable and the scene where Soloway comes up to jam with Dr. Hook in concert (prior to an actual Grateful Dead show) doesn’t have any emotional verisimilitude. We never bond with Soloway since he’s such an abstract construct. As Nunnally Johnson said, “I would have found some reason for the audience to be concerned…to have some feeling about this man.”\n\nActually, WIHKAWIHSTTTAM? resembles and plays like ANNIE HALL minus Woody Allen’s witty satirical observations. Still, it’s a minor tour-de-force for the versatile Dustin Hoffman, one of my favorite actors, and while I never quite believe the character of Georgie Soloway, I believe in Hoffman’s whimsical portrayal. He’s always a pleasure to watch, particularly in a role that most people don’t even know exists. Fortunately, his next film with Grosbard, the superior STRAIGHT TIME (1978), might be Hoffman’s best onscreen performance.\n\nEven better, Grosbard and Hoffman are generous with the supporting cast, allowing the pixie powerhouse Barbara Harris to fully steal the movie as an anxious actress auditioning for a Soloway show on her 34th birthday. Dismissed as old fashioned, she ponders aloud her stagebound life and Where Did The Time Go? It’s a poignant paen to actors who willingly sacrifice to the machineries of time; Hoffman gives great silent support and Grosbard frames the shots around Harris’s heartbreaking face and performance — that ironically gave her a Best Supporting Actress nomination.\n\nAmong the others, Jack Warden is terrific as Dr. Moses and his Ray Charles lip-sync is the funniest moment of the film. Dom DeLuise plays Soloway’s sleepy accountant, who must answer if he thinks of George as a friend or just a business. It’s nice to see DeLuise and Hoffman work together and you’re reminded how subtle an actor can be given the right role and direction. Also memorable is Soloway’s 5 am visit to his dying father’s restaurant. David Burns is excellent as the pragmatic business owner who feels cheated out of time. Since the paperback script edition is dedicated “To Pop,” there’s no doubt this is indeed a gentle tribute. These empathetic key-hole speeches are Herb Gardner at his best and quiet, thoughtful scenes like this are what make WIHKAWIHSATTTAM? worthy of a visit along with a proper DVD release. UPDATE: Speaking of the “machineries of time” the film has finally arrived on DVD in a bare-bones but proper widescreen transfer.\n\nAs a dedicated cultural archivist, I’m always fascinated by major studio films that slip from the reels of time without a trace on video or the collective consciousness. I can’t think of a more sterling example than JOHN AND MARY, a 20th Century Fox production directed by Peter Yates, hot off BULLITT (1968), and starring Dustin Hoffman in his first role since his star-making performance in THE GRADUATE along with Mia Farrow, fresh her own huge success in ROSEMARY’S BABY (1968). Pretty heady pedigree for an intimate portrait of a day in the life of a one-night stand, based on the novel by Mervyn Jones, with adapted screenplay by Sir John Mortimer.\n\nThat the film’s plot about two young people hooking up for a night of casual sex was considered “controversial” and garnered the film an “R” rating (also due to nudity) shows the different tenor of the era. JOHN AND MARY is very much a product of its year, the tail end of the groundbreaking 60’s, and its mod, “now” style replete with nouvelle vague flashbacks and fantasies. The film presses these cine-references to act as instant connector to youth, though as Roger Ebert noted, they don’t define, they over-simplify. But you have to love a Hollywood film that opens with characters debating Jean Luc Godard’s WEEKEND (1967) in a Greenwich Village bar. The movie is almost the equivalent mash-up of LOOK or LIFE magazine, with a focus on contemporary morals. The movie’s chic production of pads and happenings reflects this stylistic ambition, the cool European minimalism of Hoffman’s designer loft with wide windows, perfect for framing alienated people like the stars. Peter Yates might have been attracted to the story solely because it was the opposite of San Francisco police action. Forced to confined spaces, Yates perhaps over-directs the compositions, but in a way I always find appealing; I’m a sucker for Antonioni white space.\n\nWith such stage-bound material, the success of the film would have to rest on Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow, at the arch of their celebrity. Hoffman is always a magnetic, fascinating actor, and his character, a mod furniture maker, could almost be Benjamin Braddock a few years wiser with less neuroses. What’s his hang-up you ask? Thanks to a leftist organizer mom (Olympia Dukakis in a funny bit) who fought for Biafra but left the ice-box empty, John is an anal-obssessive control freak afeared of women who care too much about others. His flashbacks reveal a pop-art model who moved in and shattered his Zen pad with pink slacks, teddy bears and barking dogs. We get to see John among the New York “underground” represented by a party replete with Keystone Kop films projected on a nude woman’s body and backed by the sounds of Quincy Jones subtle score. Hoffman’s next ’69 film, MIDNIGHT COWBOY, would feature a more gritty and verite Warhol plastic happening. Hoffman is good though limited by the script, and while some critics don’t like the external monologues between the characters, I think them an effective way of showing the difference between behavior and thought.\n\nMia Farrow is keyed naturalistic here, with a slight habit of repeating words, a method tic that would serve her well in her career in Woody Allen films. Her flashbacks to an affair with a liberal Senator are interesting inasmuch as the cuckold husband is presented as a decent man who Mary won’t let leave his wife. Tyne Daly and Cleavon Little pop up briefly as her wacky roomie and neighbor to show her carefree spirit life as gallery manager. Mary is a more obtuse character, but she’s good when she lets John know she’s not a pushover and it’s ironic that she finds his taste in organic foods weird. They have a good bantering chemistry, but some of the issues raised seem silly, like Hoffman getting upset that Farrow calls her roommate before they make love. The pairing does seem like Hollywood’s attempt at the slick romantic espirit de corps of A MAN AND A WOMAN (1966), but Yates holds off on the archetypal 60’s musical montage. The long silent opening scene is quite masterful, with Hoffman and Farrow feeling out the awkward intimacy of their morning after. This moment is probably the most true thing in the film. And as such makes it worthy of your viewing time.\n\nAlthough heavily publicized, JOHN AND MARY didn’t set any box-office records and might have been too slight and elliptical for even 1969. Hoffman was savvy enough to resist being cast as the next symbol of confused youth by taking on Ratzo Rizzo. Farrow never regained her movie footing until Woody Allen began writing specifically for her against type. And Peter Yates never found his niche, likely due to a desire to not repeat himself, but there was still BREAKING AWAY (1976) in his future. I’ve been wanting to see this film for years, but its unavailability prevented that. Fortunately, Fox snuck the DVD out last year, utilizing the nifty original poster art on the cover and though there are no extras outside the trailer and gallery, the print looks gorgeous in 2.35:1 Panavision, with crisp wide shots you could frame. It’s great the studios are finally releasing these vital, overlooked movies that can be seen as evolutionary steps or misfires. Like other forgotten films of the era, JOHN AND MARY is required viewing for anybody interested in the secret history of the Golden Age of New Cinema."
