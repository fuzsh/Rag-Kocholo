        "text": "Ben Stiller, James Woods, John Ales and more Hollywood notables have taken to social media to pay tribute to Dabney Coleman, who died at 92.\n\nThe legendary comic actor known for his roles in 9 to 5, Tootsie and Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, died Thursday at his Santa Monica home, his daughter, singer Quincy Coleman, told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n“My father crafted his time here on Earth with a curious mind, a generous heart and a soul on fire with passion, desire and humor that tickled the funny bone of humanity,” she said in a statement. “As he lived, he moved through this final act of his life with elegance, excellence and mastery.”\n\nFollowing the news of his death, fellow actor Stiller took to X (formerly Twitter) to write, “The great Dabney Coleman literally created, or defined, really – in a uniquely singular way — an archetype as a character actor. He was so good at what he did it’s hard to imagine movies and television of the last 40 years without him.”\n\nWoods, who also lent his voice to the 2001 animated movie Recess: School’s Out alongside Coleman, shared on social media, “I’ve gone to Dan Tana’s restaurant regularly all my adult life. Dabney Coleman was always there, sitting in booth number one (appropriately), having his trademark steak. I had always loved him as an actor, and loved him more as we became friends. ##RIPDabneyColeman.”\n\nThe Emmy winner’s Madman of the People co-star John Ales wrote in a tribute, “As a kid I don’t think I found any villain more likable than mean Dabney Coleman. We shared a birthday. Months after my dad passed away, Dabney played my dad for the 1st time. We had countless dinners together. He was a complicated, hilarious genius who was so sweet to my mom.”\n\nOn Saturday, NBC’s Saturday Night Live also paid tribute to Coleman with a title card at the end of the live season 49 finale.\n\nRead more reactions and tributes to Coleman’s death below."
