        "text": "35mm at the Music Box as part of the Chicago Critics Film Festival. Almost 48-year-old me was there, as was 8-year-old me. We both left exhilarated. This is a first ballot entry into the 'They Don't Make 'Em Like They Used To' Hall of Fame. My brain actually can't reconcile that the man who wrote and directed this isn't one of the first 5-7 names mentioned in the discussion of greatest directors ever; the choices Philip Kaufman makes are that striking. I need to find a platform to discuss this more. Hell, I may need to record a commentary. But a few thoughts:\n\n-How about the fact that we don't meet even one of the future astronauts for at least 20-25 minutes?\n\n-Want to know what a movie star is? Watch Dennis Quaid as the best pilot you ever saw, Gordo Cooper.\n\n-Want to know what a movie star isn't? Watch Sam Shepard as Chuck Yeager. Let me be clear: I feel the same about the quality of their performances, but the renegade, outside-the-system energy that's so crucial for Yeager just oozes from every pore of the uncannily masculine Shepard.\n\n-Kaufman eerily places death – in the form of Royal Dano's lanky, black-clad minister – lurking in the background of every early test flight. When Kaufman shows him standing there, applauding while Alan Shepard processes to the rocket to take America's first manned space flight, I literally gasped.\n\n-You know everything about the movie is working properly when the Music Box crowd erupts in applause for a scene that isn't one of the rousing flight scenes. No, it's the moment just after Ed Harris's John Glenn – another incredible performance – is on the phone with his wife (Mary Jo Deschanel – fantastic) and he tells her that he will back her 100% if she doesn't want to meet with the vice president (LBJ is outside in a car frustratingly waiting to get a network TV moment with her). The NASA suit threatens to change the order of flight assignments and bump Glenn down, which prompts Scott Paulin's Deke Slayton – yep, also really good! – to counter: \"Oh yeah? Who you gonna get?\", as the men all gather around to support their guy. I'd argue the entire movie has been building to this moment, as minor as it is compared to the other heroics we witness."
