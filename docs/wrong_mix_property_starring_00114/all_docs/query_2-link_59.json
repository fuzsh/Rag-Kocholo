        "text": "'Farmhouse Fixer' star Jonathan Knight met his spouse, Harley Rodriguez, before his singing career took off\n\nJonathan Knight and his husband, Harley Rodriguez, married in 2022 — but their relationship goes back much further to when the pair met in 2008 through a mutual friend.\n\n“We were rehearsing the day I met him,” the New Kids on the Block member told Entertainment Tonight in June 2016, “He’s a trainer at Barry’s Bootcamp, so I would be with the band all day, then the only time I got to see him was to go take his class. I’d take his class then we’d go for dinner afterward.”\n\n“He’s been around from the beginning and seen [NKOTB’s comeback] morph into what it is today,” he added.\n\nThanks to the Rock the Block alum’s busy schedule, the couple spend a lot of time apart, but in a 2023 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Knight shared his belief that the separation only makes things better when they reunite.\n\n“It’s great. We’ve been together 14 years. It’s nice to find love. We found each other later on in life, which makes it even better. We both understand each other,” he said.\n\nSo who is Jonathan Knight’s husband? Here's everything to know about Harley Rodriguez and his relationship with the singer.\n\nRodriguez started his career as an actor\n\nLike his partner, Rodriguez is no stranger to the spotlight: From 1994 to 1997, Rodriguez starred as Manny Lopez in the TV show Sweet Valley High. He also had a small role in the 2001 movie The Price of Glory.\n\nSince then, Rodriguez has traded his acting roles for fitness ones. Nowadays, Rodriguez teaches group fitness classes at a Barry’s Bootcamp in Boston.\n\nHis bio describes his teaching style as “cool, calm, and collected” while his classes are “concise, and effective so you can expect detail-oriented, challenging, old-school movements with a new school twist.”\n\nKnight and Rodriguez competed on The Amazing Race together\n\nKnight and Rodriguez were cast as a couple in season 26 of The Amazing Race.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight, the reality star admitted that competing on the show with Rodriguez helped him with his anxiety.\n\n“That was one of the main reasons I did it,” he said. “I did it to prove to myself I could do it. Being in a group with five guys it was always easy for me to just fall behind or not speak up at interviews and stuff like that.”\n\n“He had a show a few weeks ago. He was on stage just talking to the audience, and I looked at my friend and said, ‘Who is that guy up on stage?’ This is a new guy, so it [competing on The Amazing Race] really has helped him” Rodriguez jokingly added.\n\nKnight proposed to Rodriguez on a family vacation to Africa\n\nIn 2016, the Farmhouse Fixer star proposed to Rodriguez on a trip to Africa with their families.\n\n“We were in Africa, our parents were there — our moms were there — and I just figured this was the time to pop the question and make it official,” Knight said in an episode of Sirius’ The Jenny McCarthy Show.\n\n“We were on the Zambezi River — it’s right above Victoria Falls,” he said. “We took a nighttime raft dinner, just the four of us on the river, there was like a hippopotamus in the background. There was a super moon on top of that. It was just absolutely beautiful, it was so romantic. I thought now is the time to do it.”\n\nWhen asked how the proposal happened, Knight admitted that they had been waiting for the other to ask.\n\n“That’s the funny thing, with two guys it’s always hard,” he said. “Like who proposes? Who asks? And I think that was our problem. I’ve been waiting for him to ask, he’s probably been waiting for me to ask.”\n\nThey secretly wed during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nLike many couples during the COVID-19 pandemic, Knight and Rodriguez couldn’t put on their picture-perfect farmhouse wedding, so they decided to improvise.\n\nAccording to an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Knight admitted to marrying Rodriguez in a small intimate ceremony surrounded by family and friends. Despite making things official, the NKOTB member insisted that a larger celebration was in the works.\n\n“It’s coming,” he explained.\n\nThey live in a small town in Massachusetts\n\nThroughout the span of their relationship, Knight and Rodriguez have lived in major cities like Los Angeles and New York City. That was until June 2020 when the couple decided to give up their big city lives for small town living.\n\nIn a heartfelt Instagram post, Knight wrote, “This amazing man traded in his life from the big city of LA and our home in NYC to join me at our small farm in Massachusetts...he has adjusted perfectly to the life we have created and now he’s right at home!\"\n\nHe continued, \"I adore you @harley.rodriguez to the moon and back, and back, and back 😘.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
