        "text": "Each year offers a handful of surprising celebrity couples to analyze, 2021’s first arrived early with the new romance of Olivia Wilde, 36, and Harry Styles, 26. They met while she was directing him in the upcoming film Don’t Worry Darling. Multiple outlets reported that the celebs were an item after they held hands at his manager’s wedding in early 2021.\n\nTheir offscreen relationship began after Wilde’s split from longtime fiancé Jason Sudeikis after nine years and two children—seven-year-old Otis and four-year-old Daisy. As for Styles, his love life before meeting Wilde was characterized as “pretty nonexistent during lockdown” by an Us Weekly source. His dating drought ended with Wilde...for almost two years.\n\nOn November 18, 2022, People reported that the two were on a break from dating. Their break became a breakup, and Styles went on to date Taylor Russell.\n\nAhead, everything we know about Styles and Wilde’s relationship, from how they met and why they broke up to whether it inspired the 2024 movie The Idea of You at all.\n\nSept. 11, 2020\n\nNews broke that Styles had been cast in Don’t Worry Darling, Wilde’s directorial follow-up to . Styles reportedly replaced Shia LaBeouf following his “poor behavior” and violation of Wilde’s “zero asshole policy” on set, a source told Variety. Although earlier reports cited a scheduling conflict for LaBeouf's departure, his exit also came amid his ex-girlfriend FKA twigs’s lawsuit against him on charges of “sexual battery, assault, and infliction of emotional distress.”\n\nWilde announced Styles and Florence Pugh’s casting on Instagram, writing, “Jack and Alice. Very proud to work with these fine folks. #DontWorryDarling.”\n\nOct. 15, 2020\n\nFilming began in mid-October with Wilde posting a photo of the Don’t Worry Darling director’s slate. “Blank slate. Full heart. Let’s do the damn thing, @libatique. 💪 #pressureisaprivilege,” she captioned the post.\n\nNov. 13, 2020\n\nThe first time Wilde publicly spoke about Styles was for his cover interview with Vogue. “To me, he’s very modern, and I hope that this brand of confidence as a male that Harry has—truly devoid of any traces of toxic masculinity—is indicative of his generation and therefore the future of the world,” she said in the profile. “I think he is in many ways championing that, spearheading that. It’s pretty powerful and kind of extraordinary to see someone in his position redefining what it can mean to be a man with confidence.”\n\nShe also spoke about the moment she and the film’s costume designer, Arianne Phillips, found out Styles would be joining the cast. “She [Arianne] and I did a little victory dance when we heard that we officially had Harry in the film, because we knew that he has a real appreciation for fashion and style,” Wilde told the outlet. “This movie is incredibly stylistic. It’s very heightened and opulent, and I’m really grateful that he is so enthusiastic about that element of the process—some actors just don’t care.”\n\nIf those weren't ringing endorsements enough, Wilde also defended Styles’s gown on the cover against conservative commentator Candace Owens. After Owens said, in part, “Bring back manly men,” Wilde replied, “You’re pathetic.”\n\nJan. 4, 2021\n\nOnly a few days into the year, Styles and Wilde’s relationship was revealed at his manager Jeffrey Azoff’s wedding. The pair was photographed holding hands in masks by The Vampire's Wife, he in a black suit with white ribbon and she in a pastel floral dress. People reported that Wilde and Styles were, in fact, a couple after meeting on the set of Don’t Worry Darling. “They were in Montecito, California this weekend for a wedding,” a source explained. “They were affectionate around their friends, held hands and looked very happy. They have dated for a few weeks.”\n\nMeanwhile, an insider told TMZ that Styles officiated Azoff’s wedding and brought Wilde as his plus one to the wedding. Per the outlet, the couple looked “very much together” at the nuptials, attended by just 16. The Sun’s source said that Wilde and Styles “clicked immediately—they’re both very artistic, passionate people and it was one of those things where straight away everyone could see they had a spark. It’s no surprise something has happened, but now they’re quite open about it and out and about as a couple. They went to a wedding together with a lot of their friends there.”\n\nJan. 5, 2021\n\nThe following day, several outlets had intel on Styles and Wilde’s dynamic, which ELLE rounded up. A source told Us Weekly that Styles had referred to Wilde as his “girlfriend” during a speech at the wedding. Another source said the pair “had chemistry almost instantaneously on set [of Don’t Worry Darling]. It was only a matter of time before they got together.”\n\nA Page Six source claimed that none other than James Corden helped facilitate the relationship by allowing Styles and Wilde to stay at his California home while shooting their movie. “Harry had been staying at James Corden’s house near Palm Springs during filming, and so they were able to be alone and keep their relationship very secret,\" the outlet's source said. \"So everyone was really surprised—and rather delighted—when Harry brought Olivia as his date to the wedding, and introduced her as his girlfriend.”\n\nMeanwhile, a source told Entertainment Tonight that Wilde “wouldn't let a romantic relationship get in the way of a professional one, so anything they're doing is being done thoughtfully.” The insider also claimed that “Olivia and Harry are together for long days on set and have gotten to know each other really well, so it's all very organic.” As for implications that Wilde moved on too quickly with Styles following her Sudeikis breakup, the source said that they split early in 2020, although the news wasn't announced until November. “Olivia and Jason talk all the time and are still close because of the kids,” the source added. “It's highly unlikely he was blind-sided by this news.”\n\nWilde and Sudeikis at the 2016 Vanity Fair Oscars party.\n\nJan. 7, 2021\n\nPhotos emerged of Styles and Wilde out and about in Santa Barbara. Both were masked up as Styles put his arm around Wilde. He wore a pink beanie, bandana, and black hoodie. She wore dark brown pants, a white mask, and a tan argyle sweater.\n\nJan. 8, 2021\n\nWhen Sudeikis and Wilde’s split was first revealed, a source told People that the breakup was “amicable and they've transitioned into a great co-parenting routine.” Entertainment Tonight further reported that the couple “just fell out of love in a romantic way, but still have love towards one another as people,” per a source. Another insider added that “there was absolutely no drama or scandal, they just didn’t work as a couple anymore. If you’re looking for a juicy story, there just isn’t one.”\n\nBut after her romance with Styles became public, a source told People that Sudeikis “is absolutely heartbroken about the split. There is still a lot of love there, and he would like to have hope that maybe there’s a way for them to repair things. But what happens next remains to be seen.” A Page Six source went one step further, claiming that Styles and Wilde had been dating for longer than “the past few weeks.” The insider said, “Jason found out about Harry and pushed the conversation. Olivia then asked for a separation and news of the split was made public.” Neither party has commented directly on reports concerning their breakup.\n\nJan. 9, 2021\n\nIt’s unclear when exactly things turned romantic between Wilde and Styles. But a source told Us Weekly that they “were able to keep their relationship under wraps for a bit before it became public knowledge,” adding, “They were very careful about it and even sleuthy at times, although the small group of people who were on set with them every day eventually figured it out.” The insider further clarified that “Harry did not break up an engagement.”\n\nJan. 10, 2021\n\nAnother day, another conflicting report about the timeline of Sudeikis and Wilde’s split: “Olivia called off the engagement in early November but only after she already had gotten close to Harry,” a source told Us Weekly. “Whether Harry knows it or not, he was a reason for the split and it blindsided Jason—he totally adores Olivia and is devastated. Family is his biggest priority.”\n\nStill, another source insisted that “the engagement was called off early last year, as was previously reported. Harry was in no way the reason for their split.”\n\nFeb. 14, 2021\n\nOn Valentine’s Day, Wilde posted a tribute to Styles, ostensibly about his role in Don’t Worry Darling .\n\nShe wrote:\n\nLittle known fact: most male actors don’t want to play supporting roles in female-led films. The industry has raised them to believe it lessens their power (i.e financial value) to accept these roles, which is one of the reasons it’s so hard to get financing for movies focusing on female stories. No joke, it is harrrrrd to find actors who recognize why it might be worth it to allow for a woman to hold the spotlight. Enter: @harrystyles, our 'Jack'. Not only did he relish the opportunity to allow for the brilliant @florencepugh to hold center stage as our 'Alice', but he infused every scene with a nuanced sense of humanity. He didn’t have to join our circus, but he jumped on board with humility and grace, and blew us away every day with his talent, warmth, and ability to drive backwards. 👊 #dontworrydarling.\n\nFeb. 17, 2021\n\nE! reported that the duo traveled to London together on February 16 after wrapping production on Don’t Worry Darling.\n\n“Harry and Olivia loved being on the road and have gotten very comfortable spending all of their time together,” a source told E! “They are rarely apart and it made sense to go to London together.”\n\nWilde’s two children were in London with Sudeikis and she planned to spend time with them. “Olivia will mostly be spending time with her kids while Harry sees family and friends,” the source added. “He also wants to show her around and go to some of his favorite spots.”\n\nApril 14, 2021\n\nAfter two months out of the spotlight, Styles and Wilde were seen at a west London pub. An eyewitness told The Mirror that the two had a dinner date outside with drinks.\n\n“They looked very cozy on an intimate table for two away from other diners,” the source said. “They were grinning like Cheshire cats at each other all night.”\n\nThe two appeared pretty in love, the source added: “[Olivia] had her legs crossed and gently nudged against him. They looked completely smitten.”\n\nApril 21, 2021\n\nEntertainment Tonight got an update from a source about how Wilde and Styles' time in London has been. The couple, the source said, have deliberately avoided public places and keep a low profile. “Their idea of a good time is going for a long walk and ducking into a neighborhood pub,” the source said.\n\nThe two have enjoyed having more downtime now that their film Don't Worry Darling has wrapped. “Filming during a pandemic in L.A. was pretty all-consuming,” the source said. “Now they're able to unwind, relax, and really enjoy some one-on-one time.”\n\nJune 4, 2021\n\nEntertainment Tonight got a rare look at Wilde and Styles' relationship in London—and confirmation the two are still going strong as summer begins. The outlet ran a photo of the two on a lunch date together. A source spoke to Entertainment Tonight about how well things are going between them.\n\nWilde and Styles are \"having an awesome time [in London],” the source started. “[They've] been going on walks outside in the park and not hiding their relationship [and have] grown even closer as a couple.”\n\n“Yesterday, [June 3], they enjoyed lunch outside and looked incredibly cute together,” the source said. “They were both in a great mood and left the restaurant holding hands. Harry put his arm around Olivia as they walked back to her house.”\n\nLater in the month, they were seen on what was reportedly a vacation in Italy, following their time in London.\n\n“Harry has been seen taking a break on the beach in Porto Ercole after he finished filming My Policeman in London,” a source told Page Six.\n\nFollowing the vacation report, a source told Entertainment Tonight that what Wilde and Styles have is “not a short fling.”\n\n“It’s obvious that this was not a rebound or a short fling,” the source said. “They care so much about each other and have a deep connection.” The source continued: “They’re pretty low-key and have enjoyed being somewhat out of the public eye.”\n\nDec. 9, 2021\n\nWilde did her first in-depth interview since starting to date Styles with Vogue. The actress demurred from speaking at detail about him or their relationship, but she did address the scrutiny she received for their 10-year age gap and how happy she is now.\n\n“It’s obviously really tempting to correct a false narrative,” Wilde said of those critical of a woman in her 30s dating a man a decade younger. “But I think what you realize is that when you’re really happy, it doesn’t matter what strangers think about you. All that matters to you is what’s real, and what you love, and who you love.”\n\n“In the past 10 years, as a society, we have placed so much more value on the opinion of strangers rather than the people closest to us,” she added. “[But] I’m happier than I’ve ever been. And I’m healthier than I’ve ever been, and it’s just wonderful to feel that.”\n\nMarch 15, 2022\n\nThe couple was seen holding hands in the streets of London in mid-March, once again wearing coordinated outfits in blue. They looked comfy and casual in jeans, Wilde wearing a blue knit pullover on top of her striped button-down, while Styles wore a classic white T-shirt under a blue jacket.\n\nApril 2, 2022\n\nHarry Styles released his new single “As It Was” and during an interview on SiriusXM’s The Morning Mash Up to promote it, he talked a whole lot about how the process of making this music was “easily the most joyous of anything that I've kind of experienced so far while making music.”\n\nHe didn't say what (or who) was causing all this happiness, but he did elaborate, explaining, “I think if you're an artist and you're making something, there's always gonna be part of you that is questioning yourself and questioning the work and I think that can be a good thing if you use it the right way, but, you know, I also feel really happy at the moment and I feel like it's the first time I feel like I'm kind of making music and putting music out from a real place of kind of personal freedom and that is a really liberating place to be kind of creating from.”\n\nAug. 18, 2022\n\nThe couple were seen in New York City on a date night at Italian restaurant Rubirosa. As they left the establishment, Styles reached back to grab his girlfriend's hand, pulling her closer. The rocker was wearing a crocheted shirt with rolled sleeves in white with yellow and lavender details, leaving the buttons open to mid-chest. He wore it with striped brown trousers and white shoes and had his hair half up in a tie.\n\nStyles wore a black face mask and a small silver cross on a chain. Wilde was wearing a dark navy blue shirt over a long flower print toile skirt in white and different shades of blue, featuring a row of brown buttons up the front. Peaking out from the skirt, Wilde could be seen wearing a pair of the adidas x Gucci Gazelle sneakers.\n\nAug. 24, 2022\n\nIn an interview released by Variety, Wilde discussed her decision to keep her relationship with Styles private. “I’m not going to say anything about it because I’ve never seen a relationship benefit from being dragged into the public arena,” she said. “We both go out of our way to protect our relationship; I think it’s out of experience, but also just out of deep love.”\n\nShe also addressed the tabloid attention on their relationship and her breakup from Jason Sudeikis more candidly, saying, “The last two years, my family has gone through this kind of restructuring and a revolution that should be a totally personal experience. And it’s not. The most painful element of it has been women shaming me for making a decision that was for my own health and happiness.”\n\nStyles spoke about working with Wilde in the interview. The best piece of advice she gave him was “the first step is to lose the Oscar you won in the shower that morning. Listen, and do the scene with your partner, not at them. Be a human, tell the truth,” he recalled.\n\nHe added that “as a director, Olivia is incredibly focused. She communicated what she was looking for from the cast with both clarity and respect. I think transitioning from acting into directing has made her a director who knows how to get the best out of everyone.” He did not address their dating.\n\nSept. 24, 2022\n\nOn a Friday night in early fall, the couple were seen eating at Truck, a Mexican restaurant a town in upstate New York called Bedford. Styles wore an Adidas track suit with shoes from the same brand, while Wilde was dressed in a white t-shirt. The couple has been facing break-up rumors after the release of Don't Worry Darling and the ensuing drama around its promotion.\n\nDuring the movie's premiere at the Venice Film Festival in early September, they had very little public interaction, causing fans to think there might be an issue in their relationship. However, Wilde was seen on September 22 dancing at Styles' sold out show at Madison Square Garden in the very front row.\n\nOct. 20, 2022\n\nA source told Entertainment Tonight that couple is closer than ever after the drama of the last few months, including the press tour for Don't Worry Darling.\n\n“The press tour was stressful,” the insider said. “The goal was to let their work speak for itself — but that backfired.”\n\nAccording to the source, they apparently feel closer having walked through the fire together. They have been very busy and are now looking for more opportunities to connect with quality time, the source said.\n\nIt's good that drama brings them closer, because a week earlier, Wilde and her ex, Jason Sudeikis were the subject of a Daily Mail exposé with their former nanny, who alleged that Sudeikis discovered that Wilde had kissed Styles by reading emails on her old Apple watch. He subsequently became infuriated with Wilde when he saw her prepare a salad for Styles using the family's “special dressing” and then lay under her car to stop her from leaving the house.\n\nFor the first time in a while, the former couple came together to refute the story.\n\n“As parents, it is incredibly upsetting to learn that a former nanny of our two young children would choose to make such false and scurrilous accusations about us publicly,” the exes said in a joint statement. “Her now 18-month long campaign of harassing us, as well as loved ones, close friends and colleagues, has reached its unfortunate apex. We will continue to focus on raising and protecting our children with the sincere hope that she will now choose to leave our family alone.”\n\nOct. 21, 2022\n\nThey're also managing the drama around Wilde and Sudeikis well, according to a source speaking with People on October 21, 2022.\n\n“Harry and Olivia are great,” said the source. “They're better than ever. They rise above this sort of thing all the time and they're just moving forward with their relationship and are happy and thriving.”\n\nThe couple are spending October in Los Angeles together, according to a second insider.\n\n“Olivia is happy that Harry is around. All the drama is a lot and definitely affects her,” they said. “Olivia and Jason don't have very much contact. When they do, it's all about the kids. They co-parent as best as they can.”\n\nSomeone close to Styles said that he is pretty upbeat about the whole situation.\n\n“He likes to live a pretty care-free, happy life. Olivia has been stressed about [the drama] and it affects Harry too,” they said. “But he has been very focused on enjoying their special relationship.”\n\nNov. 11, 2022\n\nOn Friday, November 11, Wilde and Styles were seen at the gym in LA together. For their gym wear, Wilde was in a black cropped tank-top and matching leggings, with black sneakers. Styles was in a more colorful outfit, with a green dufflebag and patterned socks, a blue top and black shorts. The singer is just recovering from a flu that ravaged his musical team and forced him to cancel three concerts.\n\nThe canceled concerts were sold out and scheduled to take place at the Kia Forum in Inglewood on November 5, 6, and 7. They have since been rescheduled for January. He announced the news in an Instagram Story, saying he was “devastated.”\n\n“Towards the end of the show on Wednesday I started feeling ill and I've been in bed with the flu ever since,” Styles said. “I've been doing everything I can to be able to sing tonight, but I'm leaving the doctor now and I'm devastated that it's just not possible. Until very recently I haven't had to postpone a show due to illness in the 12 years I've been touring. I'm so sorry to do it, and if there was anyway I could do the show I would.”\n\nHe added, “I'm sorry this news is coming so close to show time, but it was my sincerest hope to be able to play for you tonight. I know several of you have planned trips to LA to see the show, and it means the absolute world to me.”\n\nAnother of Styles' shows was postponed in Chicago in early October, due to illness in the band and crew. It seems it finally reached the star a month later.\n\nNov. 18, 2022\n\nPeople reported that Wilde and Styles had decided to put a pause on their romance for now. Multiple sources said the two were “taking a break” from dating because of distance and different priorities.\n\n“He’s still touring and is now going abroad. She is focusing on her kids [Otis and Daisy, with ex Jason Sudeikis] and her work in L.A.,” one source said. “It’s a very amicable decision. They’re still very close friends.”\n\nA friend added that “right now, they have different priorities that are keeping them apart.” Wilde and Styles were last photographed together on Monday, November 14.\n\nAug. 4, 2023\n\nOn Friday, August 4, Harry Styles was photographed with friends on a boat in Bolsena, Italy, while wearing a revealing bathing suit. On his thigh, eagle-eyed fans noticed a tattoo that seemed to be a reference to Wilde. It read “Olivia” in italic font.\n\nFans argued over whether or not the tattoo is for Wilde, since Styles' former band One Direction had a track called “Olivia” on their 2015 album Made in the A.M.\n\nStyles was on the boat with late night host James Corden and Victoria’s Secret model Jacquelyn Jablonski.\n\nMarch 19, 2024\n\nAnne Hathaway shut down theories that her upcoming rom-com film, The Idea of You, was based on Styles and Wilde’s romance. The film’s story is centered on a 40-year-old divorced mom who finding love with a 24-year-old boy band singer.\n\n“No, just no,” Hathaway told Extra when asked about the fan theory.\n\nShe explained her character “had her heart just absolutely smashed by her ex-husband, and it wasn’t just that her heart that got broken. She invested so much in her family. You know, there’s a line in the piece about how she’s a former people pleaser, and I think she made a lot of kind of grown-up choices throughout her life. She got pregnant really young and she’s like, ‘I’m gonna raise this baby,’ and she took it really seriously. And you know what? She did great. She’s raised a great kid, she’s built a business... She’s doing like a lot of things right, and then when her husband does this awful thing to her, she has to wonder if she was ever really loved in the first place, and so that’s a long time to live with that question.\n\n“And so, in this relationship, I think she begins thinking it’s just gonna be a bit of fun, and then she realizes it’s something more, and if she’s gonna actually participate in it, she’s gonna have to let some other things go.”"
