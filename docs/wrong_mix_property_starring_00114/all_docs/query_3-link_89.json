        "text": "Want to hear something incredibly depressing? There will never be another Robin Williams movie. Deep down, we all know that. When actors die, they stop appearing in movies and immediately if they weren't still working. Williams was still working when he passed away ten years ago (!), and his handful of unreleased efforts all materialized by the end of 2015. But when you stop and really think about it -- no more Robin Williams movies EVER -- it's terribly sad.\n\nThis realization gives meaning and weight to whichever of the seventy Williams movies you've yet to see. Even movies that are not that appealing or good. Like A Merry Friggin' Christmas. Can I Do It 'Till I Need Glasses? The‚Ä¶\n\nMartin Mull Marathon #03 üßîüèº\n\nOur boy died a few days ago on the 27th of June, 2024. He was a great comedian, and one of my biggest celebrity crushes, but I basically only knew him as Willard Kraft from Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996-2003) and as Colonel Mustard from Clue (1985). He did a lot of respected TV shows, but he was fairly unknown in the movie world. Therefore, I will take this opportunity to celebrate his life by submerging myself into his strange and obscure filmography. Rest in peace, dear king!\n\nThis is the strangest trilogy I've ever seen. The third film completely abandons the mockumentary angle and it simply works as a romantic comedy.\n\nThe husband has‚Ä¶\n\nFinal installment in Martin Mull and Harry Shearer‚Äôs History of White People in America trilogy, and the best by a lot. Instead of the vignette mockumentary style explored in the first two, this hews closer to Real Life (which Shearer co-wrote) in a full-length narrative film about how boredom and otherness manipulate the square, male-dominant lives of a middle-class, middle American couple (Fred Willard and Mary Kay Place, both excellent) in the presence of a celebrity (Mull, playing himself as a daytime talk show host). There‚Äôs nothing new about the story but everyone involved is game, and there‚Äôs a lot of established talent in here (Shearer as Mull‚Äôs producer, Michael McKean back as my namesake, the Rev.
