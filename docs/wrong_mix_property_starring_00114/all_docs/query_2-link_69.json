        "text": "Harry Kane has a love story that not many other footballers can replicate.\n\nThe England superstar is married to his childhood sweetheart, Kate, with the couple being together since they were in school.\n\nFollow England vs Spain LIVE HERE\n\nKate has been by Kane’s side throughout his incredible football career as she supported him while he became his country’s and Tottenham’s all-time top goalscorer.\n\nKane's move to Germany with Bayern Munich originally saw the pair live separately with Kate staying in London to look after their kids, while the forward made himself at home in a Munich hotel.\n\nHowever, the family all moved into a new house in Bavaria around Christmas last year to offer him their support as his career continues to go to new heights.\n\nAs Euro 2024 is now effectively a new home tournament for Kate, she has been spotted cheering on her husband at England games and will be there for the final this Sunday.\n\nWho is Harry Kane’s wife?\n\nKane and wife Kate have been married for five years after being together since their school days.\n\nThey grew up only streets away from each other when they were younger and attended the same school in east London.\n\nThe couple went on to get engaged in 2017 when Kane proposed on their holiday to the Bahamas before their wedding took place in 2019.\n\nThe striker celebrated their special day by posting on social media saying: \"Finally got to marry my Best Friend! I love you.\"\n\nKate is a sports science graduate and fitness instructor who also boasts a following of over 298,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nShe is regularly at Kane’s games, showing her support on the sidelines with their children and they have all been there throughout Euro 2024 as England close in history in Germany.\n\nHowever, Kate is said to find Kane’s fame ‘crazy’ now that he is considered one of the greatest strikers in football history.\n\nSpeaking about their relationship, Kane told Esquire: “We went to school together, so she's seen my whole career.\n\n“Of course, she's finding it a little crazy. I think she's even been in the papers a couple of times taking the dogs out.”\n\nHow many kids do they have?\n\nKane and his wife have four kids together.\n\nThey had their first child, Ivy, in 2017 before their second daughter, Vivienne, was born a year later in 2018.\n\nKane and Kate then welcomed their first son, Louis, to the world in 2021.\n\nTheir fourth child, Henry, was then born in August with Kane writing on social media: \"Welcome to the world Henry Edward Kane. 20/8/2023.\n\n\"Love you baby boy!\""
