        "text": "Beyond the glitz and glamor of red carpets, silver screens and theater stages, famous celebrity couples share a bond that feels larger than life. We look to these iconic couples to entertain us through the parts they play and the work they do, but sometimes it's their real-life roles as married partners that capture hearts the most. When two people come together to make the perfect match—be it your married-for-decades grandparents or one of many famous couples embracing on the big screen—it sparks all the feels. Here, we highlight 45 of the most heartwarming celebrity couples throughout history, from historical duos to modern pairings. Look back on their love stories and relive their sweetest moments together.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z\n\nWe can't kick off a list of the most iconic married celebrities without mentioning Beyoncé and Jay-Z. The musical powerhouses have been together for over 20 years, and their top-secret New York City wedding in 2008 was one that completely reshaped the industry. They're still married today and share three children together: Blue Ivy, and twins Rumi and Sir.\n\nBlake Lively and Ryan Reynolds\n\nThe same goes for Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. The actors met on the Green Lantern film set in 2010 where they played on-screen lovers—and by 2011, their scripted romance transferred to real life. Today, they're one of the most beloved celebrity couples in Hollywood, thanks to their endearing sense of humor and the love they publicly share for each other. After getting married in a private wedding in 2012, they're now the proud parents to daughters James, Inez, Betty, and a fourth whose name has yet to be publicly shared.\n\nZendaya and Tom Holland\n\nAlthough Zendaya and Tom Holland aren't engaged or married just yet, they're one of the most talked-about Gen Z couples. The actors met on the set of Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2016 and embarked on a years-long friendship before their romance was made public in 2021. While this iconic couple tends to keep the details of their relationship out of the public eye, fans can't help but hope these two get engaged in the near future.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry\n\nThe world was captivated by Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's 2018 royal wedding, and for good reason. The American actress began dating the British prince in 2016, and their bi-continental romance elicited a flurry of excitement, buzz and curiosity. Their highly-anticipated nuptials were watched by an estimated 2 billion people around the world, and the Duchess's custom Givenchy gown instantly became one of the most iconic wedding dresses of all time. In early 2020, Prince Harry and Meghan expressed their desire to step down as full-time members of the royal family. In the years since they relocated to Santa Barbara, California, they've forged a path as trailblazers in their respective careers, dedicating their time to humanitarian work and parenthood; The royal parents have since grown their family to include son Archie and daughter Lilibet.\n\nGeorge and Amal Clooney\n\nIt doesn't get more glamorous than George and Amal Clooney. This iconic couple had a meet-cute for the ages at a dinner party Clooney hosted at his Lake Como villa in 2013. The Oscar-winning actor sparked up a fast friendship with the successful human rights lawyer, and their relationship turned romantic later that year. By 2014, Clooney popped the question. The couple got married at a star-studded wedding in Venice, Italy that same year, which brought out scores of onlookers and paparazzi all trying to catch a glimpse of the luxe affair. The Clooney twins, Alexander and Ella, joined the family in 2017.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka\n\nThis iconic couple has stood the test of time. Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka met on a street corner in New York City in 2004, and their friendship grew into something more. The actors took their romantic relationship public in 2007 and welcomed twins Harper and Gideon via a surrogate in 2010. After gay marriage was legalized in New York in 2010, this famous couple formally announced their engagement. They were officially married in 2014 during a private (yet lavish) ceremony in Italy.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama will go down as one of the most famous couples in history. Years before they became President and First Lady of the United States, they met when they were both working at a law firm in Chicago.

They made history the following year by becoming the first same-sex couple to star on the cover of ESPN's The Body Issue.

Upon the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, the famous couple assumed the titles of Prince and Princess of Wales.\n\nJoe Jonas and Sophie Turner\n\nWe can't have a list of famous married celebrities without including Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner. The singer began dating the Game of Thrones actress in 2016, and they got engaged one year later. Although they attempted to have a top-secret Las Vegas wedding in May 2019, their plans were foiled when a guest live-streamed the chapel ceremony on Instagram. They held a lavish sequel ceremony the following month in the South of France, and have since grown their family with the birth of two daughters in 2020 and 2022.

The singer first came out as bisexual in a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, and in another interview with the publication in 1992, he confirmed he was \"quite comfortable about being gay.\" He began dating Furnish, a Canadian filmmaker, in 1993. On December 21, 2005, the day that the Civil Partnership Act was introduced in the UK, John and Furnish were among the first same-sex couples to form a civil partnership.

Bessette moved into her boyfriend's NYC apartment in 1995, and the duo got engaged later that year. They succeeded in keeping their September 12, 1996 wedding a top-secret affair, thanks to their choice to get married on the remote Georgia island of Cumberland. Their intimate nuptials took place amid candlelight in a small wooden chapel, and Bessette wore a trendsetting slip wedding dress with a cowl neckline. This popular love story was tragically cut short when the couple died in a plane crash on July 16, 1999.\n\nNick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra\n\nWhen it comes to memorable celebrity weddings, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra's nuptials top the list.

Their first official date was at Outback Steakhouse, and the rest is history. They were married on September 14, 2013, in California and share two sons and one daughter.

They often attend award shows together arm-in-arm and frequently share heartfelt posts about each other online.\n\nJohnny Cash and June Carter Cash\n\nIt's easy to remember the influence Johnny Cash and June Carter had on country music, but it might not have been possible had she not been the positive force that changed his life. The musical artists first met backstage at the Grand Ole Opry, and 13 years later, Cash proposed to his love during a live performance in Canada.

Although the two never did end up tying the knot, their decades-long partnership demonstrates their dedication to one another.\n\nGoldie Hawn and Kurt Russell\n\nNot seeing the need to make their relationship official through marriage, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell have been inseparable for more than three decades.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis\n\nHow can you not love when an on-screen romance becomes an IRL romance? Long before this celebrity couple got married, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis were Kelso and Jackie—the vain, not-so-bright couple on That '70s Show. In fact, Kutcher was Kunis' first kiss… and it just so happened to be captured on camera. They didn't begin dating until 2012, and Kutcher proposed two years later.
