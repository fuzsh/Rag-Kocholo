        "text": "SHEARER, CHRISTOPHER\n\np. 724\n\nSurnames: SHEARER, RAPP, PHILLIPPI, DRAYER, EBLING, MAURER, BULL, DEEM, LEASE\n\nAmong the representative citizens and leading agriculturists of Berks county, none is more worthy of mention in this publication than Mr. Christopher Shearer, whose excellent farm is located in Muhlenberg township. Mr. Shearer was born Nov. 8, 1820, in the city of Reading, son of Jonathan and Polly (Rapp) Shearer.\n\nChristopher Johan Shearer, grandfather of Christopher, was the founder of the family in America. He came from Holland and settled at Reading, Pa., where he followed his trade of shoemaker until the outbreak of the Revolutionary war. With other neighbors he was drafted for service and participated in the battle of Long Island, and the retreat through New Jersey to Philadelphia. Here his regiment's term, with nearly all of the other bodies of militia, under the three months enlistment period, expired. It is probable the farmers would have all returned to their homes and the tradesmen to their trades, had not General Washington made a stirring speech to them in which he demonstrated that all would be lost unless the militia re-enlisted, contracting to serve six months longer, giving them a hope that the struggle might then see an end. We are accustomed in these days to look on all the Revolutionary soldiers as unselfish patriots, but that all of the militia did not belong to this class was shown when in spite of the commander's appeal, the larger number returned to their homes. Among the few who again offered his life and liberty to the country was Christopher Johan Shearer, and he was one of the soldiers that took part in the historic Crossing of the Delaware and the fight with the Hessians. After the expiration of his six months service, he was drafted again into the militia, and fought in the battle of the Brandywine, on which occasion the militia was placed in the front as reserved troops. The grandfather in after years described this battle as having taken place on a calm, smoky day. The firing was done in platoons, each platoon stepping backward after they had discharged their guns. Soldier Shearer knelt down to get a view of the English troops under the cloud of smoke and in this action was wounded in the left forearm. The next morning news reached General Washington that the British had made an incursion into the farming country for provisions, and the commander said that the Reading militia had done such good service that he would accord them the honor and pleasure of capturing this foraging party. In spite of his wounded arm, Mr. Shearer determined to assist in this effort and accompanied the body of soldiers that met the British, who were well prepared for the assault. Just at this time General Washington discovered that instead of a foraging party, he had sent his brave Reading militia to attack the entire British army. He immediately sent General Wayne's division which soon checked the English and caused their retreat and thus saved the militia from complete annihilation. Mr. Shearer's enlistment, or draft, had now expired, and he returned for a rest of several months, but subsequently re-entered the army and did guard duty at Royersford, being then a non-commissioned officer in his company. After being here for some time the Reading militia found a platoon of British cavalry endeavoring to cross and the former wisely took shelter in a small wood near by, and by rapid firing drove the enemy back. One of the British dropped to his saddle after the firing.\n\nLike in our own days political feeling ran high and the German element was largely in sympathy with the British soldiers at that time. Mr. Shearer and wife were members of the German Reformed Church, and while he was absent in the army one of his children died and the church refused burial privileges on account of his serving with Washington, and not having paid the last year's assessment of tax on its members. In her extremity his wife turned to the Lutheran denomination, asking from them a burial lot, which they readily granted, and when Mr. Shearer returned to his home and learned the facts he said: \"From this time on we are Lutherans.\" He again engaged in shoemaking, which he followed until he was appointed justice of the peace, an office which he held until his death in 1827. Mr. Shearer was married to Julia Phillippi, who, according to family traditions, was the first female child born in Reading. There was a boy child born in Reading named Drayer, being the first born, but she was the second child and the first female. To Christopher Johan Shearer and wife were born a number of children, of whom but four lived: Jonathan, John, Solomon and Benjamin. In political belief Mr. Shearer was a Federalist.\n\nJonathan Shearer, father of Christopher learned the shoemaker's trade with his father, and followed it for a few years, After which he became an artist, and some of his paintings can be found in Reading to this day. Subsequently he learned the tanner's and currier's trade with Abel Ebling, and this he carried on for some time but in 1832 he engaged in farming, in which he continued until his death, when he was aged sixty-four years. His wife lived to be eighty years of age, and had a family of eleven children, as follows: Peter, Christopher, Benjamin, Joseph, Julian, Solomon, Mary, Hannah, Daniel, Jonathan and Rebecca. The family were Lutherans in religious belief, and Whigs in politics.\n\nChristopher Shearer was educated in the pay schools of Reading, also spending two terms in the common schools. He learned the carpenter's trade, which he followed for fifteen years, and then located in Muhlenberg township and purchased the old Daniel Maurer farm, which he converted into the Tuckerton Fruit farm. This property became famous throughout the county, a season crop including from 3,000 to 5,000 bushels of potatoes, 1, 000 to 1,500 bushels of Bartlett pears, 3,000 to 4,000 bushels of apples, many bushels of cherries and 3,000 to 4,000 baskets of peaches, not to mention hay, corn, etc. In addition to the crops mentioned about one hundred tons of tobacco and from eighty to one hundred barrels of Clinton grape wine are produced annually. When the Early Rose potato was first offered for sale at one dollar a pound by its producer, Mr. Shearer bought one pound, and planted it to a single eye. He dug them up in July, having developed very early and he planted them again, getting a full harvest of seventeen bushels. These were all planted the following year, and were sold at a high figure, thus introducing the fine potato to this section of the country. When Mr. Bull of Massachusetts advertised three different grapes-Concord, Clinton and a raisin grape-at three dollars per stalk, or nine dollars, Mr. Shearer sent for one of each kind, and the Concord and Clinton grapes have proved very valuable. The Globe peach was a standard variety, and was produced on the Tuckerton Fruit Farm, some of the trees yielding thirteen baskets each of 5/8 measure. These large peaches were exhibited at county fairs, always drawing premiums. They won the first premium at the State Fair at Philadelphia, over Jersey and Delaware peaches, and at the close of the Fair was sold at twenty-five cents each to Jersey and Delaware peach growers.\n\nMr. Shearer has done more, perhaps, to build up this section of the country than any other citizen. He petitioned the court to open Muhlenberg street, which was granted, and here he made a draft and laid out the solid block between Eighth and Ninth streets, Bingaman and Muhlenberg, named Spring Garden street, purchased a half-square of land on which he built twenty-one houses, bought the acre of land from Eighth street to Lemon alley and from Cherry to Franklin, building eleven houses on Lemon alley, two on Eighth street, and four south of Franklin street. He also purchased the corner of Penn and Eighth streets, where he built a number of houses and bought land on Walnut, Elm and Buttonwood streets. He petitioned the court to open Elm and Buttonwood streets, both being granted, and built a number of houses, being both a contractor and builder. finally he purchased a five-acre lot below the Charles Evans cemetery.\n\nIn 1843 Mr. Shearer was married (first) to Catherine Deem, and to them were born these children: Peter D., Christopher H., Esther, Oliver R., Edmond L., Rebecca, Mary, Catherine and Rose. Mr. Shearer was married (second) to Fietta M. Lease, and to them four children were born: Clara, Sylvan, one who died in infancy, and Gay Y. Mr. Shearer was a Lutheran in religious belief, but is now a Spiritualist. In politics he was first a Whig, then a Republican and now is independent. He was a candidate for lieutenant governor on the Greenback ticket, and was nominated for congress in the Berks county district, was defeated by the old party, though receiving a satisfactory vote. Though now eighty-eight years old he is still well and strong, and is actively engaged in looking after his truck farm and his numerous properties.\n\nSHEARER, CHRISTOPHER HIGH\n\np. 1566\n\nSurnames: SHEARER, DEVLAN, RASER, ECKERT, SCHEARER, DIEHL\n\nChristopher High Shearer, a landscape painter of national reputation, whose artistic creations are in numerous prominent homes in Pennsylvania and other states of America, was born at Reading, May 18, 1846. After receiving a general education in the local schools he manifested an inclination for the study of art, which resulted in frequent visits to the studios of F. D. Devlan and J. Heyl Raser. Upon one occasion, whilst in the studio of the latter, watching the development of a landscape on the easel, he remarked innocently to Mr. Raser, \"I believe I can paint,\" when the artist looked up and replied pleasantly, \"Yes, a man can do anything if he tries.\" The ambitious boy tried and the result of his first endeavor was so satisfactory that he was encouraged to continue. He persevered in his studies and in ten years, when twenty-seven years of age, produced a picture which attracted great public attention and won the favorable opinion of art critics. It was a large woodland scene which he entitled \"Schwartzbach\" and it found a place in the art gallery of a prominent manufacturer and banker at Reading, Henry S. Eckert. Shortly afterward Mr. Shearer went to Europe to pursue his studies in the great art schools of Dusseldorf and Munich and remained there several years. He also visited the principal art galleries of Germany. Upon his return he painted a number of foreign subjects one of which was an admirable picture of the Bavarian Alps and was given a place of honor in the Academy of Fine Arts at Philadelphia. In 1878, he went again to Dusseldorf and spent a year in that city. Later he visited Paris and studied French art for a time.\n\nOf the many remarkable productions from his prolific brush during the past thirty years, which give abundant evidence of his creative genius, the \"Smoky Range\" (1889) in the Reading Free Library, is admittedly one of his best, as well as one of his largest, paintings.\n\nMr. Shearer is also a naturalist, and his large and superior collection of butterflies, numbering 35,000, both in their natural state, and as painted by him in the various stages of development from the egg on the leaf to the \"full-blown\" butterfly, prove him to be a persevering student of nature.\n\nFor some years Mr. Shearer has cultivated a farm in Muhlenberg township, along the east bank of the Schuylkill river, near Stoudt's Ferry Bridge, and has manufactured considerable quantities of grape wine as a diversion from his art work. Another pastime is the study of music, and he is a pleasing performer on the violin.\n\nMr. Shearer's father is Christopher Shearer, now over ninety years of age, and who was a large fruit grower for many years in Muhlenberg township, near Tuckerton. His grandfather was Jonathan Shearer, fruit-grower and builder, of Reading, who was a son of John Christopher Schearer, a Revolutionary soldier in the company of Captain John Diehl, and a justice of the peace at Reading from 1813 until his decease in 1830.\n\nSHEARER, DAVID R.\n\np. 1222\n\nSurnames: SHEARER, RUBRIGHT, MUNTZ, LINK, BREHAN, WERTZ\n\nDavid R. Shearer, a leading contractor and builder of Reading, Pa., was born March 13, 1850, in Perry township, Berks county, son of David and Sarah (Rubright) Shearer, and grandson of John Shearer.\n\nJohn Shearer was a farmer of Perry township, and was also engaged as a stone mason. He married a Miss Lesher, and to them were born these children: David; John; Hannah, who died in 1906, at the age of ninety-three years; Kate; Caroline; Anna; Sarah; Mary and Elizabeth. In religious belief the family were members of the Reformed Church., David Shearer, son of John, was born June 24, 1819, and was a farmer and carpenter in Perry township, following the latter occupation until eighty years of age, since which time he has lived retired, he now being in his ninetieth year. His wife, Sarah Rubright, died in December, 1905, when seventy-eight years old. Their children were: Daniel, William, David R., Samuel, Frank, Catherine, all living, Joel, Sarah and Anna, deceased. In religious belief the family were Reformed, and in politics David Shearer was a Democrat.\n\nDavid R. Shearer was educated in the schools of Perry Township, and as a young man learned the carpenter's trade with his father, an occupation which he has followed since his eighteenth year. Until 1892 he engaged as a journeyman, but since that year he has been engaged in contracting, his present holdings being fourteen stone-front houses on North Eleventh street, the block between Robeson and Marion streets. Mr. Sheerer employs an average of six men, and his buildings have been mostly confined to the northeastern section of the city, where he has erected many building blocks.\n\nMr. Shearer was married to Catherine Muntz, also a native of Perry township, and to them were born five children, as follows: Annie, m. to William C., Link; Charles D., who is associated with his father in business, m. to Flossie Brehan; Sallie, m. to Harry Wertz; and Katie and Elizabeth, single. Mr. Shearer is a Democrat in politics, and he and Mrs. Shearer attend the Reformed Church, of which he as been an elder since 1895.\n\nSHEARER FAMILY\n\np. 1222\n\nSurnames: SHEARER, PHILLIPI, TOBIAS, HERBINE, REIGEL, SOUDER, ZIEMER, YORGEY, HAIN, DUNDORE, WEITZEL, HIESTER, LEINBACH, HORNBERGER, BRYAN, FLEISHER, GOOD, WALLACE, LIVINGOOD, WITMAN, POTTEIGER, MADEIRA, SCHWARTZ, LEHR\n\nFor many years the Shearer family has been prominently identified with the best interests of Berks county, and its members have been associated with the general development and prosperity. Among those to whom special attention is called are William Y. Shearer, justice of the peace of Bern township, and Dr. James Y. Shearer, a physician of Spring township.\n\n(I) Christopher Shearer, the founder of the Shearer family in America, when seventeen years old came from Germany to Reading, Pa., when that city was but a small town. He was a justice of the peace, and had his office at what is now the corner of Eighth and Penn streets. His wife was a member of the Phillipi family. These two spent the remainder of their lives in Reading, dying there. Their children were: John P., Jonathan P., Benjamin P., and Solomon P., all but John dying at Reading.\n\n(II) John P. Shearer was born at Reading, but in early manhood he removed to Bern township, locating on the farm now owned by Judge Shearer. He took up 100 acres of land in 1799, and there spent the remainder of his useful life, dying in 1847, when seventy-four years of age. He is buried at Epler's Church. During his residence in the township he became prominent in local affairs, was constable, and later justice of the peace. Under his management his farm was improved and he erected necessary buildings, which were rebuilt by his son, Samuel T. Shearer. His first wife was Sophia Tobias, a daughter of Christian Tobias, and of this marriage the following children were born: Esther T., who died unmarried; John T.; Jacob T.; Abraham T.; William T.; Samuel T.; George T.; Elizabeth T., who died unmarried; Mary T., who married John Herbine; Annie T., who married Joseph Reigel; and Sarah T., who married David Souder. After the death of his wife Sophia, John P. Shearermarried a Miss Lehr, by which union there was no issue. By his third wife, Lydia Ziemer, widow of William Ziemer, he had two children: Senator Edward, an attorney of Reading, and Susan, who was killed in a railroad accident when a girl.\n\n(III) Samuel T. Shearer, the father of William Y. and Dr. James Y. Shearer, was born in Bern township, where he engaged in farming. In 1829 he was married in Reading, to Catherine Yorgey, a daughter of Henry Yorgey, of Exeter, and twelve children were born to them: William Y. and James Y. are mentioned below; Catherine married Emanuel Hain; Eliza married Benneville Dundore; Sarah married Weitzel; Gettie married Evan Hiester; Benjamin Y., Esq., of Reading, married Clara Leinbach; Aaron married Emma Hiester, and, after her demise, Mary Ann Hornberger; Amos has his home with his brother William.; three died young.\n\nWhile not a public official, Samuel T. Shearer always took an interest in public affairs, and was a good farmer and business man. He lived on the home place, further improving it, and when it passed into the hands of William Y. Shearer it was considered one of the best pieces of property in the township, and is still so regarded.\n\nWilliam Y. Shearer was born in Reading, Pa., Jan. 12, 1830, but when seven years of age he was brought to Bern township, where he completed the education begun in the public schools of Reading. Later, from 1864 to 1869, he taught school in Bern township, being engaged at the Eplers, Albright and what was then known as the Mine Hole (now the Shearer) schools. However, the better portion of Mr. Shearer's life has been spent in farming, and he is regarded as one of the representative farmers of his township. For over half a century he has also been a surveyor, and has been employed in surveying much of the county. During his term of service as auditor of Berks county, to which office he was elected in 1869, the county was cleared of debt, and his financial foresight gained him a high reputation as a public official. In politics he is a Jeffersonian Democrat, and firm in his belief in the future of his party. His religious affiliations are with the Reformed faith.\n\nOn Oct. 27, 1853, Mr. Shearer married Caroline C. Bryan, a daughter of Jeremiah and Elizabeth Bryan, born Dec. 8, 1829, died Oct. 19, 1897, at the age of sixty-seven. She is buried at Epler's Church. No children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Shearer, but they took a little girl of eleven, Ellen Fleisher, and reared her as their own. Miss Fleisher is also a native of Bern township.\n\nOne of the old landmarks of Berks county was the court-house built in 1761, and torn down in 1840, and Mr. Shearer remembers it well, as he does many very interesting events connected with local and national affairs. He is a man of unflinching principle, true to his best ideals, and a citizen of whom the county may well be proud.\n\nJames Y. Shearer, M. D., A. M., of Sinking Spring, a successful practitioner of medicine in Berks county for upward of forty years, was born at Reading Oct. 5, 1836. When he was a child his father removed to Bern township, and he there received his early education in the public schools. Later he attended the normal school at Reading, conducted by Rev. Dr. William Good, who afterward became the first county superintendent of common schools. At that institution he acquired a further knowledge of books, making a specialty of Latin and Greek. When but fifteen he began to teach school, and he thus continued for five years, spending three years at Tuckerton and two years in Upper Tulpehocken township, near Strausstown. In 1860 he determined to study medicine, and after successfully passing a severe literary examination under Dr. Edward Wallace, to demonstrate his fitness, he entered the office of this eminent physician, with who he remained for three years, accompanying him in his daily work among his patients. During the fall and winter months of 1860-61-62 he attended lectures at the Jefferson Medical College, and was graduated therefrom in 1862. Immediately thereafter he located at Strausstown, entering into an introductory practice among the people whose confidence he had gained as a school teacher, and there remained for three years. Learning then of a larger and in every way better opening at Sinking Spring, caused by the removal of Dr. Michael T. Livingood to the West, he determined to take his place in an office which had been started by Dr. A. H. Witman about 1840, and has been carried on continuously ever since. Since his removal to Sinking Spring, Dr. Shearer has been in active practice. His patients are scattered over an area of many miles. At the request of many of his patients he opened an office in Reading, where he sees office patients upon stated days.\n\nIn 1862 Dr. Shearer became a member of the Medical Society of Berks county; in 1868 he joined the Pennsylvania State Medical Society, and in 1880 he became associated with the American Medical Association, and is still a member of all three bodies. He was president of the Berks County Medical Society for several terms, and has represented the society as delegate to the state and national associations more than once. His papers upon various professional topics have aroused favorable comment. In 1887 he was the only accredited representative from Berks county to the International Medical Congress at its ninth annual convention, held at Washington, D. C., and received one of the handsome medals specially prepared to mark the occasion. This medal is one of Dr. Shearer's most valued possessions. In 1884 Franklin and Marshall College conferred the degree of Master of Arts upon Dr. Shearer by reason of his acquirements in Latin and Greek. Twelve men who afterward became successful physicians studied medicine under Dr. Shearer and learned to love as well as respect and admire him. He is the best known physician in lower Berks county, where he has witnessed many changes in social and industrial progress.\n\nWhile Dr. Shearer was practising at Strausstown he was selected to act as school director of Upper Tulpehocken township, and he officiated as secretary of the board for one term. This was during the Civil war, and as secretary he raised the necessary funds to fill the quota of soldiers from the township to avoid the draft, levying the tax, according to law, to meet the obligation. As director of the Farmers National Bank, of Reading, for twenty-five years Dr. Shearer has given the bank the benefit of his sagacity and business foresight.\n\nDr. Shearer married Eliza G. Potteiger, daughter of Jacob Potteiger, of Upper Tulpehocken, and they had one daughter, Alva, who married Dr. J. D. Madeira. Dr. Madeira was one of Dr. Shearer's medical students, and thus met his future wife; later he graduated from Jefferson College, and is now a successful physician of Reading. In 1879 Mrs. Eliza G. Shearer died aged forty-nine years. In 1882 Dr. Shearer married Susanna Schwartz, daughter of James Schwartz, a miller, who for many years resided at the mouth of the Wyomissing creek, in Cumru township, opposite Reading.\n\nFrom this brief chronicle can be readily gathered the importance of the services rendered by the Shearer family to Berks county, both in their capacity as public officials and as private citizens. The name has come to be associated with all that is best and most public-spirited, and the present representatives of the family hold the esteem and admiration of their neighbors in the several communities in which they are to be found.\n\nSHEARER FAMILY\n\np. 1598\n\nSurnames: SHEARER, DIEHL, SNYDER, PHILLIPPI, PRINTZ, HIGH, RAPP, DIEHM, WITMAN, RITTER, RIBBLE, KEISER, SELLERS, MCNULTY, BURKEY, STIRL, POTTS, ZACHARIAS, MCCALLUM, ROTHERMEL, HESSER, BREINER, HETRICH, LUDEN, HELLER, ROBINSON, WARLEY, EISENBERGER,\n\nThe Shearer family has been settled in Berks county for over one hundred and forty years and is still represented among the best elements of its citizenship. Its members have during all this time contributed their full share toward maintaining the high standing of the name for honor in business and social relations.\n\nJohn Christopher Shearer, the emigrant ancestor of this family, was born in Germany in 1752, and emigrated to America, sailing from Rotterdam. He was a shoemaker by trade. Settling at Reading, Berks Co., Pa., which was then a very small town, he there passed the remainder of his life, except for the time he was serving as a soldier in the Revolutionary war. He was in the colonial forces, enlisted as a private in the company of Capt. John Diehl, of Reading, and took part in the battle of the Brandywine in which he was wounded, a bullet passing through his forearm and breaking it. He became one of the most prominent men of Berks county in his day, and long served as justice of the peace, holding that office for nearly twenty years. He received his commission from Governor Snyder. He died in 1830, at the age of seventy-eight years, widely known and respected all over his portion of the State. His wife was Juliana Phillippi, a daughter of John Phillippi, of Reading and a member of a French-Huguenot family; and she was the first white female child born at Reading, and died Dec. 28, 1831, aged seventy-eight years.\n\nJonathan Shearer, son of John Christopher, was born Sept. 18, 1780, and was brought up at Reading. He received such education as the average schools of his day afforded, and was well prepared to make his way in the world, having a knowledge of three different trades, shoemaking, tanning and the painting of clock dials. He also farmed out-lots, being what was then known in Reading as a town farmer, having about fifteen acres of land now included in the city, which he cultivated successfully. He and three other enterprising young men of Reading (his brother Solomon Shearer, John Printz and Abraham High) started the cultivation of the first vineyards in Berks county, each for himself on half-acre adjoining lots, situated on South Eighth street, between Bingaman and Muhlenberg streets. Thus it may be judged that he was a man of energy and resource, and he became a citizen of excellent standing. Jonathan Shearer married Mary Rapp, daughter of Peter and Hanna (High) Rapp, of Reading and she survived him many years, dying in 1879, at the advanced age of eighty-two. Mr. Shearer had died in 1845, at the age of sixty-five years. They had a family of eleven children, namely: Peter, an attorney of Reading who died unmarried; Christopher A., now a retired contractor and builder of Reading who married Catharine Diehm; Benjamin, who died unmarried at the age of twenty-nine years; Joseph, who is mentioned below; Solomon, mentioned, below; Jonathan, who married Mary Witman; Daniel, mentioned below; Rebecca, unmarried; Juliana, wife of William S. Ritter; Mary, married to William Ribble; and Hannah, who married David Keiser.\n\nJoseph Shearer, who has lived retired for the past few years, is one of the oldest residents in his part of the city of Reading, having occupied his present home, at the corner of Eighth and Franklin streets, since 1858. Fifty years is a long period of residence in one spot, and involves a test of good citizenship which Mr. Shearer has stood well. He was born Feb. 13, 1828, in Reading, and there received his education in the common schools. He attended the very first day of free school. Carpentry, which trade he learned early, has been the principal business of his life, and he followed it off and on the greater part of the time during his active years, doing considerable building and selling for himself. For about four years he was also engaged in the mercantile business, and for may years following was greatly interested in the culture of fruit and truck, but for several years past he has lived retired, enjoying the competence he laid away in his younger days. Mr. Shearer is particularly fond of good literature and has a good supply in his home, which his leisure enables him to enjoy as never before. He has always been an industrious man, and deserves the esteem which is everywhere accorded him. His acquaintanceship is wide, and he is favorable known wherever he has had dealings with his fellow-men, whether in business of other relations. In his political faith Mr. Shearer is a Republican, and though he has not been active in party affairs he served in the council in 1859-60. Mr. Shearer can relate many stories of the early days in Reading, which have been handed down from his father and grandfather, and which are particularly interesting to those who have a taste for folklore and characteristic incidents of old times in Berks county.\n\nMr. Shearer was united in marriage with Louisa Sellers, a daughter of Nathaniel Sellers and granddaughter of Dr. Tobias Sellers, of Montgomery county, who practised medicine in the county, where he died. Nathaniel Sellers followed the trades of cooper and potter, and was engaged in business for several years. He died in Reading at the age of fifty-eight, and his wife, Magdalena (McNulty), died at the age of fifty-six. Six children have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Shearer: John Christopher died in infancy; Charles Oscar and Joseph Sellers died in childhood; Louisa M. is the wife of William C. Burkey, who is engaged in the contracting and building business in Reading; Helen Mary is the wife of George S. Stirl, of Reading; William J., a farmer in Alsace township, Berks county, married Ellen Potts, and they have six children, William, Charles, Mabel, Irene, Irvin, and Emily.\n\nSolomon Shearer, for fifty years one of the most enterprising and successful farmers and fruit growers of Berks county, residing at Vinemont, was born at Reading March 16, 1830, son of Jonathan Shearer. He received a limited education in the public schools of Reading (the free system having just been started when he began going to school) and then learned the trade of carpenter. He had followed that pursuit as a journeyman but a short while when he directed his attention to the cultivation of trees and fruits of various kinds, beginning at Reading in a small way. He remained at Reading two years, but wishing to engage in the business more extensively purchased a farm in Muhlenberg township, near Tuckerton, where he could carry out his plans, enlarging the business year after year for twenty-seven years, which evidences the success of his enterprising efforts. Then in 1881, having purchased a large farm in Lower Heidelberg, a short distance beyond Fritztown, his operations were developed to still greater proportions, and were extended year after year until he came to own three farms embracing 375 acres, all under active cultivation, and to produce valuable and wonderful crops, as the following particulars will show most conclusively; Seven acres of strawberries; four thousand to eight thousand bushels of picked apples; two thousand to eight thousand bushels of peaches (varying according to seasons); hundred of barrels of wine, of five different kinds; and great quantities of cider. The looking after all these productions annually from the beginning to the end through the several seasons, undoubtedly required exceptional ability, and Mr. Shearer displayed such ability in a manner as remarkable as it was most successful. Besides these great operations, he took upon himself the burdens of other persons involving many thousands of dollars, which he also mastered, but only by the exercise of the greatest possible skill, economy and determination in the management of his multitudinous affairs. His life has been one continuous struggle against adverse circumstances, if not the natural enemies to farmers and fruit growers on the one hand, then the financial embarrassments of others on the other, which a sympathetic disposition led him to assume; and he has the proud satisfaction of known that he survived them all, making of himself a free and independent man.\n\nIn 1857 Mr. Shearer married Amelia Zacharias, a daughter of John A.
