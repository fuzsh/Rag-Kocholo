        "text": "Maureen Lipman and Harry Shearer will reprise their performances as husband and wife Joe and Elli from the play's premiere run, with Cotton himself replacing John Bowe as the husband's long-absent brother Billy.\n\nSet in New York in 1986, \"Joe and Elli share a love of ballroom dancing and are practicing their routines for the next big competition. Despite constant bickering, the love they have shared for nearly fifty years is clear. Then one night, out of the blue, Joe's long-lost brother Billy bursts back into their lives with an extraordinary story to tell.\"\n\nLipman's extensive theatre credits include When We Are Married at the Garrick Theatre, A Little Night Music for the Menier Chocolate Factory and in the West End, Aladdin at the Old Vic, Old Money and Peggy For You (both at Hampstead Theatre) and Re-Joyce in the West End, on national tour and in the U.S. Credits at the National Theatre include Oklahoma!, Macbeth, Long Day’s Journey Into Night, Jumpers, The Front Page and School for Scandal. On television, her work includes \"Ladies of Letters,\" \"Skins,\" \"He Kills Coppers,\" \"Sensitive Skin,\" \"About Face,\" \"All at No. 20,\" \"Agony,\" \"Cold Enough for Snow\" and \"Eskimo Day.\"\n\nShearer, who will be making his West End debut in the play, is best known for providing character voices for \"The Simpsons\" since it began in 1987, most notably as Mr. Burns, Principal Skinner and Ned Flanders. He co-created, co-wrote and co-starred as bassist Derek Smalls in the 1984 mockumentary \"This is Spinal Tap,\" with Christopher Guest, with whom he also worked on \"A Mighty Wind\" and \"For Your Consideration.\" Previous U.S. theatre credits include Loose Lips, Tinkle Time and Accomplice. His radio show \"Le Show\" has been broadcast throughout the U.S. on National Public Radio every week for the past 30 years.\n\nCotton’s previous plays include Wet Weather Cover at the King’s Head and Arts Theatres, The Incredible Journey of Sir Francis Younghusband and The Enoch Show for the Royal Court, Scrabble for the National Theatre and Man Falling Down for Shakespeare’s Globe. As an actor, his credits include Passion Play at the Duke of York’s Theatre, A Flea in her Ear at the Old Vic, The Syndicate and The Grapes of Wrath for Chichester Festival Theatre and Henry IV parts 1 and 2 for Shakespeare’s Globe. The production is directed by David Grindley, who was most recently represented in the West End by Our Boys. Other West End credits include Journey's End (also Broadway, where it won the 2007 Tony for Best Revival of a Play), The Philanthropist (Donmar Warehouse, subsequently also on Broadway for Roundabout Theatre Company), Honour, What the Butler Saw and Abigail's Party (both of which transferred from Hampstead to the West End), Loot (transferred from Chichester's Minerva) and Some Girls. Other recent credits include The American Plan (Bath's Ustinov Studio and London's St. James) and A Steady Rain (Bath's Ustinov).\n\nDaytona is produced in the West End by TRH Productions, Lee Dean and Jenny Topper in association with Park Theatre."
