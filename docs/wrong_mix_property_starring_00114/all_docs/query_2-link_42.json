        "text": "SAMUEL SHEARER, a general blacksmith and justice of the peace of Sugar Creek township, Armstrong county, was born in East Franklin township, Armstrong Co., Pa., Oct. 26, 1850, a son of John Shearer.\n\nJohn Shearer was born in South Buffalo township, this county, and grew up there, receiving a limited educational training and learning farming in all its details. He married Elizabeth Cornman, born in North Buffalo township, this county, daughter of George Cornman, who came from some point east of the mountains to Armstrong county. After their marriage, John Shearer and wife settled on the farm of one hundred acres owned by his mother, who was a widow, the father having died when John Shearer was a small boy. Later, however, John Shearer bought a farm of one hundred acres in East Franklin township, Armstrong county, where he and his wife spent the remainder of their lives. At the time of his purchase this land was all woodland, but he developed it into a valuable farm, and was successful as an agriculturist. John Shearer and wife had children as follows: George, Isaiah, Annie, Andrew, Mary, John, Absalom, Sarah Jane, Samuel, Peter G., and Catharine (who died in infancy). Politically John Shearer was a Democrat, but he did not take an active part in public affairs.\n\nSamuel Shearer, son of John Shearer, attended school in East Franklin township until he was seventeen years old, and then began learning blacksmithing. After completing his apprenticeship he located at Foster Mills, where he has since continued to reside. For twenty-four years he was postmaster at this point, continuing as such until the office was abandoned, mail now being delivered by the Star route.\n\nIn 1873 Mr. Shearer married Kate E. Kaufmann, a daughter of Henry Kaufmann, and the following children have been born to them: Maggie E. is deceased; John P., who married Cora Jenkins, resides in Sugar Creek township, where he is engaged in farming and teaming; Harry resides at Ellwood City, Pa.; Nannie B. is the wife of Harry W. Rose, of Craigsville, Pa.; Jesse Lee, who married Effie Porterfield, resides in Sugar Creek township with his father; one son who died in infancy.\n\nIn addition to working at his trade Mr. Shearer is also a farmer, owning four and a quarter acres of land and for a number of years renting 200 acres, all at Foster Mills. Fraternally he is a member of the Odd Fellows lodge at Cowansville, the Encampment, I.O.O.F. at Kittanning, and the Knights of Malta at the same borough. Since casting his first vote, he has been a Republican, and he has served on the school board for twelve years, now being secretary of that body. Elected a justice of the peace for Sugar Creek township, he gave such satisfaction that he was reelected and is now serving his second term, which expires in 1914. The M. E. Church holds his membership and profits by his liberality, and there as elsewhere he is highly esteemed as an upright man."
