He is the creator and bandleader of instrumental music ensemble Snarky Puppy and world music group Bokanté, founder of the record label and music curation source GroundUP Music, and artistic director of the GroundUP Music Festival.\n\nMichael attended the University of North Texas' jazz studies program for 4 years, then moved to nearby Dallas for another 3 years, where he worked with some of the most influential figures in modern gospel, R&B, and soul music, and was mentored by legendary keyboardist Bernard Wright (Miles Davis, Chaka Khan) before moving to Brooklyn, New York, in 2009, where he spent 9 years, then relocated to his current home of Catalonia, Spain.

It has played host to artists like Béla Fleck, Esperanza Spalding, Andrew Bird, The Wood Brothers, Robert Glasper, Concha Buika, Terence Blanchard, Joshua Redman, Jacob Collier, Tank and the Bangas, Chris Thile, Knower, and Pedrito Martinez, among many others.\n\nMichael is passionately committed to music education and outreach, having given clinics and masterclasses at over 200 schools around the world. In 2020, alongside GroundUP Music Festival Director Paul Lehr, Michael formed the GroundUP Music Foundation, which seeks to advance music education incentives throughout the world. He is active as a guest speaker in international music business panels and works regularly with non-profit organizations in an effort to better serve the community at large through the arts.\n\nBill Laurance\n\nKeyboards\n\nBill Laurance is a five-time Grammy Award winning pianist, composer and performer.

As a trumpet player, keyboardist, composer, and producer, Justin has developed a reputation as a multi-faceted musician who can serve an essential role to whichever artist he is contributing, both onstage and in the studio.\n\nJustin attended the prestigious University of North Texas, where he performed for two years in the One O'Clock Lab Band, recording three albums as well as performing at major festivals throughout Europe. While at North Texas, Justin joined Snarky Puppy and has appeared on the majority of their numerous studio and live recordings since 2007.\n\nIn addition to Snarky Puppy, Justin maintains an active schedule performing, recording, and writing with a variety of original artists and groups, including his newest project with Becca Stevens, Gisela João, Louis Cato, and Michael League entitled Mirrors. Recorded over two weeks in Portugal amidst the many challenges presented during the pandemic, each person co-wrote a song with one another, yielding ten songs that are personal to the respective pair of songwriters yet are all unified through the collaborative co-production and recording process.\n\n​\n\nJustin appears on recordings with artists as diverse as David Crosby, Donald Fagen, Harry Shearer/Derek Smalls, Larry Carlton, Randy Brecker, Robert Glasper, Trombone Shorty, Kirk Franklin, Laura Mvula, and Salif Keita.

Shaun’s prodigious gifting noticed and nurtured at an early age led him to begin playing the drums and piano at four years old and his mother placing him under the tutelage of Carolyn Campbell, who taught him to read and write music. At age five he was already playing the piano and organ at church. Later, he learned to play trumpet, trombone, tuba, French horn and flute.\n\nAs a music major at the University of North Texas, he joined fellow student musicians to add his special brand of creativity to Snarky Puppy, an award-winning, chart-topping jazz fusion band - committed to music performance and education. In an effort to give back to the community that shaped the very depth, dimension, and dynamics of his sensational sound, Shaun plans to one day create a fine arts academy and after-school program for urban students who have little access to music education and training. Shaun is currently working with various artists and music producers on a plethora of projects, and is the owner of Shaun Martin Music, LLC (formerly Shunwun Music) - all while living his creativity.\n\nHe is married to Monica Wilson Martin and they have one son, Harlem.\n\nBob Lanzetti\n\nGuitar\n\nBob Lanzetti is a Brooklyn, NY based professional guitarist, composer, producer, and educator.

At 13 he joined RedHeaded Stepchild, a western swing kid band, and started gigging around Austin and learning how to solo from bandmate and guitar prodigy Will Knaak. This interest in improvisation led to a fascination with jazz; he joined and composed for the Westlake High School jazz band, and attended the University of North Texas to study with Fred Hamilton. In 2005-2006 he played in the One O’Clock Lab Band and wrote the piece “Foe Destroyer”, which was recorded for the band's Lab 2006 album.\n\nChris remained in the Dallas area for four years after college, co-leading the rock band Oso Closo with singer/songwriter Adrian Hulet, and studying music with Bernard Wright and other members of the Dallas R&B/jazz/Gospel scene.

Before meeting his Snarky family at the University of North Texas, Jay grew up in the small town of Grapevine, TX. He was lucky to have a piano in the house growing up, which he considers his introduction to music education. Jennings started playing the trumpet at age 11, and by 15 he was already playing professionally. In high school he was selected to the Texas All-State Jazz Ensemble both sophomore and senior years and was selected for the High School Grammy Jazz Ensemble, which performed at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, CA. Jennings auditioned as a college freshman and was selected for a jazz soloist chair in the world renowned One O'clock Lab Band at UNT. When he was 22 he joined the Dallas based, symphonic rock band The Polyphonic Spree. He recorded and toured with them until moving to Brooklyn, NY in 2009. Jennings eventually began touring with capital records artist Eli \"Paperboy\" Reed in 2010 and over his career has backed up some of the world's finest artists such as Aretha Franklin, Michael McDonald, David Crosby, David Bowie, Lalah Hathaway, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Lee Fields, Bobby Rush, Harry Shearer (Spinal Tap), The O'Jays, Jimmy Buffet, James Taylor, Jon Bon Jovi, Billy Joel, The Four Tops, and many more. Currently, Jay is touring with country music star Toby Keith and is currently living in Los Angeles, CA. He continues to record and tour with the Grammy Award winning band, Snarky Puppy.\n\nUpon his move to Los Angeles in February of 2017, Jennings began composing for his own band, The YAYennings Quartet. This marks the beginning of Jay’s solo career as a band leader. The bebop driven quartet began during the Snarky Puppy recording session for Culcha Vulcha in 2016. Jennings and fellow Snarky Puppy band mate, Bob Reynolds(tenor), spent much of the session’s “off time” jamming in a room with a grand piano playing duets. After realizing they share a similar interest in early 1950’s west coast bebop, Jay started composing for his own band. Jay called upon his west coast UNT alumni Jose Perez (Pancho Sanchez, Bokanté) on drums and Ross Schodek (Pancho Sanchez) on bass to be the back bone in the “chordless” quartet. The YAYennings Quartet album “Scott Ave” will be released in February of 2019. Jay Jennings is a member of the Yamaha artist family and proudly plays Yamaha trumpets.\n\nChris Bullock\n\nTenor Saxophone, Flute, Clarinet\n\nChris Bullock is a New York City based saxophonist, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. He's had a distinguished career performing with a plethora of artists across all musical styles, most notably being a long-time member and composer of the genre-bending ensemble Snarky Puppy. With the Pup’s, he has been awarded five Grammys and frequently travels performing at the major concert halls and music festivals around the world.\n\nChris's musical journey started as a child when he discovered the Beach Boys, hip-hop, four track cassette recorders and instruments such as the clarinet and electric guitar - all of which continue to inform his musical voice even today. In 2018 he released his debut solo album Boomtown: a hybrid of improvisation, jazz, chamber music, electronic music and hip hop production elements. With his Boomtown band he has toured across the US and Canada bringing a groovy, synth heavy ensemble that includes some of the musical leaders of his generation.\n\nOver his career Chris has collaborated on numerous projects and performances with artists like David Crosby, Michael McDonald, Lalah Hathaway, The Los Angeles Philharmonic, Charlie Hunter, Chris Thile, Robertinho Silva, Metropole Orkest, Phish, & Soulive.
