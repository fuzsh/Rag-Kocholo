        "text": "For someone who has made his living from comedy for more than 50 years, Harry Shearer is very serious about politics.\n\nTogether with his wife, the Welsh singer-songwriter Judith Owen, Shearer - who does the voices of more than 20 of the characters in The Simpsons, including Mr Burns, Principal Skinner and Ned Flanders - does an annual music and comedy benefit gig for the homeless in the UK and US.\n\nAnd as a self-described \"political animal\", homelessness is one of Shearer's major concerns - something he ultimately links to the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nIt is not the only impact that crash had, he argues.\n\n\"There's a reason why the US, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Italy, Turkey and a few other countries have veered towards a populist strongman kind of leader,\" Shearer told me.\n\n\"It has to do with the fact that when you have a serious economic downturn people lose homes and jobs by the million.\"\n\nShearer argues that that only a few people responsible for the financial crash have been held to account for their actions, and that has exacerbated the situation.\n\n\"We're basically reliving the lessons of the 1930s,\" says the 75-year-old, whose Jewish parents left Austria and Poland, respectively, for the US before he was born.\n\nThe Simpsons has already had politicians, such as the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair, voice their cartoon characters on guest appearances on the show.\n\nSo would Shearer like to hear, for example, Donald Trump do the same?\n\nSlipping seamlessly into Trump's voice, he says: \"I hate the media. I hate even having to answer that question. I hate to tell you, but you're fake.\"\n\nShearer impersonates him on his syndicated public radio programme, Le Show, in a slot called The Appresidentice, where Donald Trump learns to be president.\n\nAs himself, Shearer adds: \"We don't need politicians to be on a comedy show. We can make fun of them more wittily and wickedly behind their backs.\n\n\"We would be serving them because it helps them to humanise themselves. Particularly these days, some dehumanising is necessary.\n\n\"Let's have one of the talents do a Donald Trump impression, not make him look like he's got a sense of humour about himself.\"\n\nShearer says with a mock sigh that he has been doing the Simpsons for more than 30 years.\n\n\"No one expects, unless you work at the BBC, a job to last that long,\" he jokes, adding that he still has \"the same passion and enthusiasm I always had\" for it.\n\nThe London Christmas show raised money for the West London Mission, which helps the homeless, and the American shows, in Chicago and New Orleans, will raise funds for similar organisations.\n\n\"It's an annual event to help with the rampant homelessness crisis that we have in the States as well as here,\" he says.\n\nOwen adds: \"The homelessness in LA is like nothing you have ever seen. Skid Row downtown is a cityscape in itself.\" She adds that New Orleans, where they have a home, has similar problems.\n\nShearer and Owen have been following the election campaign in Britain, but it is Prince Andrew's recent interview on the BBC, rather than a politician, that has caught their attention."
