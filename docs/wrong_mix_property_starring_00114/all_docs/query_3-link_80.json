        "text": "Harry Shearer will play 'Joe' in Daytona at the Haymarket Theatre Royal, from 30 Jun to 23 Aug 2014.\n\nDate of birth?\n\n23 December 1943\n\nPlace of birth?\n\nLos Angeles, USA\n\nDid you go to training school, if so which one?\n\nDid not attend training school.\n\nBriefly tell us how you became involved with Daytona.\n\nI had gotten to know Maureen [Maureen Lipman, actress, and Harry's co-star in Daytona] socially just a little bit - we'd been to dinner a couple of times with mutual friends and had lively, funny conversations. And then I got sent the script for \"Daytona\" with the info that Maureen had recommended me for the part. That was it.\n\nBriefly tell us about the character of 'Joe' you play in Daytona.\n\nHe's an Austrian Jewish refugee living in Brooklyn. Both he and his wife had spent time in camps - not the good kind - as had his brother. He and his wife have built a new life together, based partly on keeping the past at bay and partly on their shared love of ballroom dancing.\n\nWhat was your first stage performance?\n\nI was in a production of Christopher Durang's \"Beyond Therapy\" in Los Angeles in the mid 80s.\n\nWhat roles would you most like to play?\n\nActually, I'm fascinated by two roles, both in musicals: Fagin in \"Oliver\" and Pangloss in \"Candide\".\n\nWhat's the best advice you've ever received?\n\nMy mom told me to use every talent I'd been given. You never know which one will pay off.\n\nWhat has been your most embarrassing moment?\n\nAs a child actor, I came out onstage in the warm-up for the Jack Benny Show when I heard the announcer beckon me from the wings. Except he hadn't said 'Harry\", he'd said \"Mary\", introducing Jack Benny's wife. I got a big laugh, and I was mortified.\n\nWhat is the most annoying part about your job?\n\nA lot of show-biz executives think being in this particular business gives them blanket immunity for bad behaviour.\n\nIf you had not become a performer, what might you have done instead?\n\nWorked with children.\n\nWhat are your favourite after-show haunts?\n\nI really tend to go have a nice little meal nearby the theatre and then scamper home.\n\nWho are your favourite actors/actresses/singers/groups?\n\nWell, here's a way to make enemies, leave someone off this list. I love Alison Steadman, Jennifer Saunders, Andy Serkis; big fan of XTC, Squeeze, Fountains of Wayne, Alice Russell, Celso Fonseca, Lenine, Jon Cleary, Galactic, Charlie Wood, The Meters.\n\nIf you could meet anyone in the world dead or alive who would it be and what would you say to them?\n\nJack Benny, and I'd just say \"thank you\".\n\nWhat was the last book you read, and name some of your favourite authors?\n\nReading three right now: The Circle by Dave Eggers, 1945 Year Zero by Ian Buruma, and Bare-Faced Messiah by Russell Miller. Long a fan of Stanley Elkin and John Gregory Toole.\n\nWhat was the last film you saw, and name some of your favourite movies?\n\nLast film I saw was \"Grand Hotel Budapest\" - won't do that again. Love \"Dr. Stangelove\" and the original \"To Be Or Not To Be\", \"Sex, Drugs and Rock'n'Roll\", \"Singin' in the Rain\", anything by Laurel & Hardy. Really liked \"American Hustle\", and a beautiful Indian film called \"Water\".\n\nFavourite TV programs?\n\nI mainly watch NBA basketball and the news. I do like \"Episodes\", and \"Harry and Paul\" and \"Armstrong & Miller\".\n\nFavourite holiday destinations?\n\nHome.\n\nDo you have any hobbies?\n\nI love to play basketball. I'm learning to bow the upright bass. I love to cook.\n\nDo you have any superstitions?\n\nNo, I'd be afraid to have any.\n\nIf you were stranded on a desert island, what three items would you take with you?\n\n1. A major continent. That would be sufficient."
