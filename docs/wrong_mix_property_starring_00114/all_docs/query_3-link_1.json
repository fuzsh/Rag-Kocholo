        "text": "1998 American comedy-drama film by Andrew Niccol\n\nThe Truman ShowDirected byPeter WeirWritten byAndrew NiccolProduced byStarringCinematographyPeter BiziouEdited byMusic by\n\nProduction\n\ncompany\n\nDistributed byParamount Pictures\n\nRelease dates\n\nRunning time\n\n103 minutes[1]CountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$60 million[2]Box office$264.1 million[3]\n\nThe Truman Show is a 1998 American psychological comedy drama film[4] written and co-produced by Andrew Niccol, and directed by Peter Weir.\n\nThe film is the story of Truman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey), a man who is unaware that he is living his entire life on a colossal soundstage, and that it is being filmed and broadcast as a reality television show which has a huge international following. All of his friends and family and members of his community are paid actors whose job it is to sustain the illusion and keep Truman in the dark about the fiction he is living.\n\nThe movie's supporting cast includes Laura Linney, Ed Harris, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone, Holland Taylor, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Delate.\n\nNiccol's original spec script was more of a science-fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Producer Scott Rudin purchased the script and set up production at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million—$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle.\n\nThe Truman Show held its world premiere in Los Angeles on June 1, 1998, and was released in North America on June 5. The film was a financial success, grossing $264 million worldwide, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards, 52nd British Academy Film Awards, and 25th Saturn Awards. The Truman Show has been analyzed as an exploration of simulated reality, existentialism, surveillance, metaphilosophy, privacy, and reality television, and described as a genre-blending work that features elements of dystopian fiction, meta fiction, psychological drama, romantic comedy, satire, and social science fiction.\n\nSelected at birth and legally adopted by a television studio following an unwanted pregnancy, Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of The Truman Show, a reality television program filmed and broadcast worldwide, 24/7, through approximately five thousand hidden cameras.\n\nTruman's hometown, Seahaven Island, is set inside an enormous soundstage, which allows Christof, the show's creator and executive producer, to control most aspects of Truman's life, including the weather. Truman's world is populated by actors and crew members who serve as his community, while carefully keeping him from discovering the truth. They also earn revenue for the show by cleverly-disguised product placement. To prevent Truman from escaping this world, Christof orchestrated scenarios to instill thalassophobia, such as the \"death\" of Truman's father in a boating disaster. The rest of the cast reinforces Truman's anxieties by messages about the dangers of traveling and the virtues of staying home.\n\nTruman is intended by the producers to fall in love with and marry fellow student Meryl, but during his college years he develops feelings for Sylvia, an extra. Sylvia sympathizes with Truman's plight and tries to tell him his life is a fiction, but she is fired and forcibly removed from the set before she can convince him. Truman marries Meryl, but his marriage is stilted and passionless, and he secretly continues to imagine a life with Sylvia; he dreams of traveling to Fiji, where he was told she had moved. Meanwhile, in the real world, Sylvia joins \"Free Truman\", an activist group that calls for Truman's liberation from what they see as a prison.\n\nAs the show approaches its 30th anniversary, Truman begins to notice unusual occurrences: a stage light which serves as the star Sirius in the night sky falls and nearly hits him; an isolated patch of rain falls only over him; he accidentally overhears the crew's radio transmissions describing his movements through town; and the reappearance of his supposedly drowned father, who is rushed away by crew members before Truman can confront him. Truman suspects that the city revolves around him, and begins questioning his life and asking who he sees as his closest confidants to help him solve the mystery.\n\nTruman's suspicions culminate in an attempt to escape the island as increasingly implausible occurrences attempt to block his path. Eventually, he is caught and returned home under a flimsy pretext. There he confronts Meryl and challenges the sincerity of their marriage. Panicking, Meryl tries to change the subject by performing a product placement, causing Truman to snap and hold her at knifepoint. In the ensuing confrontation, Meryl breaks character and is later removed from the show.\n\nHoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof reintroduces his father to the show under the guise of him having developed amnesia after the boating accident. The show regains its ratings, and Truman seems to return to his routines. One night, however, Christof discovers that Truman has begun sleeping in his basement. Disturbed by this change in behavior, Christof sends Truman's best friend Marlon to visit, and discovers that Truman has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel in the basement. Christof suspends the broadcast for the first time in its history, leading to record viewing numbers.\n\nChristof orders a citywide search for Truman and is soon forced to break the production's day-night cycle to optimize the hunt. Truman is found sailing away from Seahaven, having apparently conquered his fear of water. Christof resumes the transmission and creates a violent storm in an attempt to capsize Truman's boat. Truman nearly drowns, but he continues to sail until his boat strikes the wall of the dome.\n\nHorrified, Truman looks around and finds a staircase leading to an exit door. As he contemplates leaving, Christof speaks to Truman directly in God-like fashion from the \"sky,\" reveals the truth about the show, and encourages him to stay—claiming that there is no more truth in the real world than his artificial one. Truman utters his catchphrase: \"In case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night\", bows to the audience, and exits. Viewers around the world celebrate Truman's escape, and Sylvia races to greet him. The executive producers end the program with a shot of the open exit door, leaving Christof devastated.\n\nAfter the broadcast ends, Truman’s viewers look for something else to watch.\n\nJim Carrey as Truman Burbank.\n\nThough Robin Williams was considered for the role, Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, citing that Carrey's performance reminded him of Charlie Chaplin.[5] Gary Oldman did test footage for the role.[6] Carrey took the role so he would be known as a multifaceted actor, rather than being typecast in comedic roles.[7] Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do The Truman Show for $12 million.[8] Carrey also said it was the fastest that he ever accepted a role.[9] The scene in which Truman declares \"this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy\" to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.[10]\n\nLaura Linney as Hannah Gill, acting as Meryl Burbank, Truman's wife.\n\nLinney studied Sears catalogs from the 1950s to develop her character's poses.[11]\n\nEd Harris as Christof.\n\nDennis Hopper was originally cast in the role, but he left in April 1997 soon after filming began.[8] Hopper later stated that he was fired after two days because Weir and producer Scott Rudin had made a deal that if they did not both approve of Hopper's performance, they would replace him.[12] A number of other actors turned down the role after Hopper's departure, until Harris agreed to step in.[10] Harris considered making Christof a hunchback, but Weir did not like the idea.[5]\n\nNoah Emmerich as Louis Coltrane, playing Marlon, Truman's best friend.\n\nEmmerich has said, \"My character is in a lot of pain. He feels really guilty about deceiving Truman. He's had a serious drug addiction for many years. Been in and out of rehab.\" Very little of this is shown in the finished film, but several deleted scenes depict Louis actively expressing guilt over Truman's situation, and in one sequence, he spots Truman during his escape and purposely says nothing. His name is an amalgamation of two jazz musicians, Louis Armstrong and John Coltrane.\n\nNatascha McElhone as Sylvia, playing Lauren Garland, Truman's college schoolmate who was originally just a background character, but who Truman fell for. This relationship was the only real moment of Truman's life in Seahaven.\n\nHolland Taylor as Alanis Montclair, playing Angela Montclair, Truman's mother.\n\nBrian Delate as Walter Moore, playing Truman's father Kirk Burbank.\n\nPaul Giamatti as Simeon, the control room director.\n\nUna Damon as Chloe, Christof's control room assistant.\n\nPeter Krause as an unnamed actor playing Laurence, Truman's boss.\n\nHarry Shearer as Mike Michaelson, a TV talk-show host.\n\nPhilip Baker Hall as the network executive.\n\nJoel McKinnon Miller as a garage attendant.\n\nAndrew Niccol completed a one-page film treatment titled The Malcolm Show in May 1991.[13] The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City.[11][14] Niccol stated, \"I think everyone questions the authenticity of their lives at certain points. It's like when kids ask if they're adopted.\"[15] In the fall of 1993,[16] producer Scott Rudin purchased the script for slightly over $1 million.[17] Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute. Part of the deal called for Niccol to make his directing debut, though Paramount executives felt the estimated $80 million budget would be too high for him.[18] In addition, Paramount wanted to go with an A-list director, paying Niccol extra money \"to step aside\". Brian De Palma was under negotiations to direct before he left United Talent Agency in March 1994.[16] Directors who were considered after De Palma's departure included Tim Burton, Sam Raimi, Terry Gilliam, David Cronenberg, Barry Sonnenfeld and Steven Spielberg before Peter Weir signed on in early 1995,[5][19] following a recommendation of Niccol.[15] Bryan Singer wanted to direct but Paramount decided to go with the more experienced Weir.[20]\n\nWeir wanted the film to be funnier, feeling that Niccol's script was too dark, and declaring, \"where [Niccol] had it depressing, I could make it light. It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7.\" Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later in 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star,[11] but because of commitments with The Cable Guy and Liar Liar, he would not be ready to start filming for at least another year.[5] Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role.[11] Niccol rewrote the script twelve times,[5] while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history. He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same.[11]\n\nWeir scouted locations in Eastern Florida but was dissatisfied with the landscapes. Sound stages at Universal Studios were reserved for the story's setting of Seahaven before Weir's wife Wendy Stites introduced him to Seaside, Florida, a \"master-planned community\" located in the Florida Panhandle. Pre-production offices were immediately opened in Seaside, where the majority of filming took place. The scenes of Truman's house were filmed at a residence owned by the Gaetz family, which included Florida State Senator Don Gaetz and U.S. representative Matt Gaetz.[21] The scene at the Seahaven Nuclear Power Station was filmed outside the front entrance of the Lansing Smith Generating Plant at Lynn Haven, operated then by Gulf Power. Other scenes were shot at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California.[10] Norman Rockwell paintings and 1960s postcards were used as inspiration for the film's design.[22][23] Weir, Peter Biziou and Dennis Gassner researched surveillance techniques for certain shots.[22]\n\nFilming took place from December 9, 1996, to April 21, 1997.[24][25] Its overall look was influenced by television images, particularly commercials: Many shots have characters leaning into the lens with their eyes wide open, and the interior scenes are heavily lit because Weir wanted to remind viewers that \"in this world, everything was for sale\".[22] Those involved in visual effects work found the film somewhat difficult to make because 1997 was the year many visual effects companies were trying to convert to computer-generated imagery (CGI).[23] CGI was used to create the upper halves of some of the larger buildings in the film's downtown set. Craig Barron, one of the effects supervisors, said that these digital models did not have to look as detailed and weathered as they normally would in a film because of the artificial look of the entire town, although they did imitate slight blemishes found in the physical buildings.[26]\n\nThe Truman Show: Music from the Motion Picture is a soundtrack to the 1998 film of the same name and was composed by Burkhard Dallwitz. Dallwitz was hired after Peter Weir received a tape of his work while in Australia for the post-production.[27] Some parts of the soundtrack were composed by Philip Glass.[28] Philip Glass also appears in the film as an uncredited cameo playing his composition \"Truman Sleeps\".\n\nAlso featured are Frédéric Chopin's second movement (Romanze-Larghetto) from his first piano concerto, performed by the New Symphony Orchestra of London under the direction of Stanisław Skrowaczewski with pianist Arthur Rubinstein, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Rondo alla turca from his Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major, performed by Wilhelm Kempff; Wojciech Kilar's Father Kolbe's Preaching performed by the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra; as well as the song 20th Century Boy performed by rockabilly band The Big Six.[29][30]\n\nAlthough not part of the soundtrack, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Horn Concerto No. 1 and \"Love Is Just Around the Corner\" by Jackie Davis were also featured in the film.\n\nIn 2008, Popular Mechanics named The Truman Show as one of the 10 most prophetic science fiction films. Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story reflects the falseness of reality television. \"Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real.\" He deemed it an eerie coincidence that Big Brother made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program The Joe Schmo Show: \"Unlike Truman, Matt Gould could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as The Truman Show.\"[31] Weir declared, \"There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? Or are we filmmakers patronizing them? Is this what they want? Or is this what we're giving them? But the public went to my film in large numbers. And that has to be encouraging.\"[15]\n\nRonald Bishop's paper in the Journal of Communication Enquiry suggested The Truman Show showcased the power of the media. Truman's life inspires audiences around the world, meaning their lives are controlled by his. Bishop commented, \"In the end, the power of the media is affirmed rather than challenged. In the spirit of Antonio Gramsci's concept of hegemony, these films and television programs co-opt our enchantment (and disenchantment) with the media and sell it back to us.\"[32][33]\n\nIn her essay \"Reading The Truman Show inside out\" Simone Knox argues that the film itself tries to blur the objective perspective and the show-within-the-film. Knox also draws a floor plan of the camera angles of the first scene.[34]\n\nAn essay published in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis analyzed Truman as\n\na prototypical adolescent at the beginning of the movie. He feels trapped into a familial and social world to which he tries to conform while being unable to entirely identify with it, believing that he has no other choice (other than through the fantasy of fleeing to a far-way island). Eventually, Truman gains sufficient awareness of his condition to \"leave home\"—developing a more mature and authentic identity as an adult, leaving his child-self behind and becoming a True-man.[35]\n\nFor the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, its official poster pays homage to the film and its final scene with their website stating that \"Peter Weir and Andrew Niccol's The Truman Show (1998) is a modern reflection of Plato's cave and the decisive scene urges viewers to not only experience the border between reality and its representation but to ponder the power of fiction, between manipulation and catharsis.\"[36]\n\nParallels can be drawn from Thomas More's 1516 book Utopia, in which More describes an island with only one entrance and only one exit. Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to The Truman Show because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's Utopia and real-life groups such as the Shakers and the Oneida Community.[37] It is clear that the people in Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban \"picket fence\" appearance of the show's set is reminiscent of the \"American Dream\" of the 1950s. The \"American Dream\" concept in Truman's world serves as an attempt to keep him happy and ignorant.[37]\n\nOriginally set for August 8, 1997, the film's theatrical release was pushed back initially to November 14, 1997, and then to the summer of 1998.[38][39] NBC purchased broadcast rights in December 1997, roughly eight months before the film's release.[40] In March 2000, Turner Broadcasting System purchased the rights, and now airs the film on TBS.[41]\n\nParamount Home Entertainment released the film on VHS on January 12, 1999,[42] followed by DVD on January 26 that same year,[43] and a \"Special Edition\" re-release on August 23, 2005.[44] It was later released on Blu-ray on December 30, 2008.[45] A Ultra HD Blu-ray was released on July 4, 2023, in celebration of the film's 25th anniversary.[46][47][48][49][50]\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Truman Show holds a 94% approval rating based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"A funny, tender, and thought-provoking film, The Truman Show is all the more noteworthy for its remarkably prescient vision of runaway celebrity culture and a nation with an insatiable thirst for the private details of ordinary lives.\"[51] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[52] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[53]\n\nGiving the film a perfect four star score, Roger Ebert compared it to Forrest Gump, claiming that the film had the right balance of comedy and drama. He was also impressed with Jim Carrey's dramatic performance.[54] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"The Truman Show is emotionally involving without losing the ability to raise sharp satiric questions as well as get numerous laughs. The rare film that is disturbing despite working beautifully within standard industry norms.\"[55] He would name it the best movie of 1998.[56] In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly named Truman one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.[57]\n\nJames Berardinelli liked the film's approach of \"not being the casual summer blockbuster with special effects\", and he likened Carrey's \"[charismatic], understated and effective\" performance to those of Tom Hanks and James Stewart.[58] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, \"Undeniably provocative and reasonably entertaining, The Truman Show is one of those high-concept movies whose concept is both clever and dumb.\"[59] Tom Meek of Film Threat said the film was not funny enough but still found \"something rewarding in its quirky demeanor\".[60]\n\nAward Category Nominee(s) Result Ref.

This was his pitch:[83][84]\n\nThere has been talk of doing a musical – believe it or not – or a series. When it's a different art form, I don't think it takes anything away from the original. In my version of a series, I thought it would be fun, if after Truman walked through the sky, the audience clamored for more (which you sense at the end of the film). I imagine there would be a network with multiple channels all starring a subject born on the show. If I set it in New York City, there would be girl living on the Upper East Side, a boy from Harlem, a kid from Chinatown, etc. Since they are all on their own channel and move in their own circles, they are never meant to meet. But at the end of the first season, the boy from Harlem and the rich girl find themselves drawn to each other. They both sense that the other is acting differently from anyone they've ever met...because for the first time, they've met someone who is not acting! (In the second season, the Network would desperately try to kill off their romance.)\n\n— Andrew Niccol\n\nMain article: Truman Show delusion\n\nJoel Gold, a psychiatrist at the Bellevue Hospital Center, revealed that by 2008, he had met five patients with schizophrenia (and had heard of another twelve) who believed their lives were reality television shows. Gold named the syndrome \"The Truman Show delusion\" after the film and attributed the delusion to a world that had become hungry for publicity. Gold stated that some patients were rendered happy by their disease, while \"others were tormented\". One traveled to New York to check whether the World Trade Center had actually fallen—believing the 9/11 attacks to be an elaborate plot twist in his personal storyline. Another came to climb the Statue of Liberty, believing that he would be reunited with his high school girlfriend at the top and finally be released from the show.[85]\n\nIn August 2008, the British Journal of Psychiatry reported similar cases in the United Kingdom.[86] The delusion has informally been referred to as \"Truman syndrome\", according to an Associated Press story from 2008.[87]\n\nAfter hearing about the condition, Andrew Niccol, writer of The Truman Show, said: \"You know you've made it when you have a disease named after you.\"[88]\n\nFilm portal\n\n1990s portal\n\nArticles\n\nList of films featuring surveillance\n\nPotemkin village\n\nMedia\n\nSeducing Doctor Lewis, 2003 film\n\n\"They\", a 1941 story by Robert A.
