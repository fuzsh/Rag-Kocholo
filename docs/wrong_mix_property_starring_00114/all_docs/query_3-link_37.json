        "text": "(Does This Tree Make Me Look Fat?)\n\nNew York, NY: Get ready for the Christmas party of the year!\n\nIn a series of intimate evenings full of music, laughter and special guests, musician Judith Owen and her husband, actor and humorist Harry Shearer (The Simpsons, Spinal Tap), will once again spread their special brand of yuletide cheer for the 10th anniversary of the Christmas Without Tears Tour.\n\nA tradition that began in Shearer and Owen's Santa Monica home, these annual gatherings have grown into a heartwarming house party around the piano that involves and entertains fellow performers and audience members alike. Since 2005, when the first public performance was staged at the Walt Disney Concert Hall to aid the people of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, Christmas Without Tears has been a guilt-free way of having fun and giving back: ALL proceeds go to charities, with performances from the 2015 Tour benefiting the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF), My Friend's Place, the New Orleans Musicians Clinic & Assistance Foundation and Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre.\n\nA reverent and irreverent antidote to the most stressful of seasons, each evening includes both invited performers and surprise guests who drop into Harry and Judith's onstage living room and share a song or a joke to bring the holiday spirit to all. Song selections range from the sentimental (\"Winter Wonderland\" and \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\") to the irreverent (\"F&*k Christmas\" and \"Jesus Was a Dreidel Spinner\"). Comics, magicians, female impersonators and even a somber clown have been welcome additions, adding the perfect mix that makes this a true variety show.\n\nPast revelers have included Donald Fagen, Christopher Guest, Tom Hanks, Jane Lynch, Steve Martin, Stephen Merchant, Tim Minchin, Catherine O'Hara, Martin Short, Richard Thompson and Weird Al Yankovic, to name but a few. This year's guests include Fred Willard, Mario Cantone, Alan Cumming, Olympia Dukakis, Bela Fleck, John Michael Higgins, Paul Shaffer and many more!\n\nWatch Highlights of 2014 Christmas Without Tears Performances\n\nAs an added holiday treat, Judith, Harry and friends will release 'Christmas Without Tears' EP on November 20th, a new collection of original songs, which carries on the reverent and irreverent tradition of the Christmas Without Tears performances. The EP will include songs by Judith Owen, Harry Shearer, Amy Engelhardt, Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara. All sale proceeds will be donated to the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nA throwback to simpler times, this homespun variety show is both festive romp and salve for the soul, serving as a reminder to all that Christmas is a time to be with the ones you love...and sometimes, even family!\n\nChristmas Without Tears 2015 Tour:\n\nTuesday December 1 - Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York City\n\nFriday, December 4 - S.P.A.C.E. in Evanston, IL\n\nSaturday, December 19 - Largo at the Coronet, Los Angeles\n\nSunday, December 20 - Largo at the Coronet, Los Angeles\n\nWednesday, December 23 - Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre, New Orleans\n\nChristmas Without Tears EP Track Listing:\n\n1.

(Live at Largo) - Catherine O'Hara\n\nAbout Harry Shearer\n\nThe multi-hyphenate Harry Shearer is an author, actor, director, and musician. For the past two decades, he has voiced the characters of Mr. Burns, Smithers, and Ned Flanders on America's longest-running sitcom, The Simpsons. Among his many film roles, he is best known for his collaborations with Christopher Guest in several \"mockumentary\" films including This is Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind, and For Your Consideration. In 2010, Shearer wrote and directed The Big Uneasy, an investigative documentary feature about Hurricane Katrina, which was selected for numerous film festivals and won several awards. His albums CD Songs of the Pointed and Pointless and Songs of the Bushmen, full of bitingly satirical songs and impersonations of political figures, were both nominated for Grammys. He is a co-founder, with his wife Judith Owen, of Twanky Records and the host of Le Show, a weekly syndicated radio show.\n\nAbout Judith Owen\n\nWelsh singer-songwriter Judith Owen has released eight albums, beginning with her 1996 debut Emotions On A Postcard and most recently, Ebb & Flow. Over the years Owen and Shearer have joined forces on numerous comedy albums, satirical videos, and theatrical productions. In addition to her prolific solo work, she has been musician Richard Thompson's female foil of choice for many years. Both have appeared on each other's albums and Owen played a leading collaborative part in Thompson's projects 1000 Years Of Popular Music and Cabaret of Souls. She also co-created Losing It with Ruby Wax, a funny yet devastatingly honest two-woman show chronicling the descent into mental illness, which became a box office hit in London's West End in 2011. Owen has been touring worldwide for the past two years in support of her current critically acclaimed album, Ebb & Flow, a love letter to Laurel Canyon and the halcyon days of the great 1970s troubadours."
