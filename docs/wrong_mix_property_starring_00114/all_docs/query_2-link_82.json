Jamie Lee Curtis was smitten with now-husband Christopher Guest before they even met.\n\n“I married Chris five months after seeing his picture in Rolling Stone. I said out loud to my friend, the late, great Debra Hill, ‘Oh, I’m going to marry that guy,’” the Everything Everywhere All at Once star recalled to Sigourney Weaver during a February 2015 conversation for Interview magazine. “It was a picture of Chris with Michael McKean and Harry Shearer from Spinal Tap, but just as regular guys. Debra said, ‘Oh, I know him, and he’s with your agency. I tried to get him in a movie.’ So I called the agent, left my number, but Chris never called me. And then I ran into him at a restaurant.”\n\nDespite being excited to see Guest at the dining establishment, Curtis did not introduce herself.\n\n“He was sitting about 10 feet away and he looked at me and kind of nodded. I made a gesture, like, ‘Hi, I’m the one who called you,’” the Freaky Friday actress explained to Interview. “I was sitting with Melanie Griffith and Steven Bauer, and I looked down at my plate and whispered, ‘Oh my God, I called this guy and he never called me back and there he is.’ At that moment, Chris got up to leave. He shrugged his shoulders, and basically waved goodbye. Not a word was exchanged.”\n\nShe added at the time: “And then he called me the next day. He had kept my number. That was June 28, 1984, and I married him four months later, on December 18. He didn’t save my shoes, or what did you say Jim stayed late to do?”\n\nCurtis and Guest went on to adopt daughters Annie and Ruby, who were born in 1986 and 1996, respectively.\n\n“I spend a lot of time dropping my children off and picking them up — it’s a very regular life,” the composer previously told The Guardian in January 2004 of parenting.\n\nAs the pair balanced parenting with their relationship, Curtis has found their connection to be a source of great comfort.\n\n“One of the longest relationships I’ve had seeking comfort and contact and connection is with Chris,” Curtis wrote via Instagram in December 2020. “Today marks the 36th anniversary of our wedding. My hand in his. Then and now. Connected through our children and family and friends it became the links in our human emotional chain that have seen each of us through triumph and tragedy.”\n\nScroll below to see the pair’s complete relationship timeline:\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nJamie Lee Curtis and Husband Christopher Guest: A Timeline of Their Relationship\n\nAn everlasting love story!
