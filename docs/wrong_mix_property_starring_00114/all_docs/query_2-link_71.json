His other major books include The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon; The American Inquisition, winner of the Silver Gavel Award from the American Bar Association; Privilege and Creative Destruction: The Charles River Bridge Case; and Judicial Power and Reconstruction Politics. In addition, he has authored or edited more than half a dozen books in various fields of American history, including The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War; The Dictionary of American History; The Supreme Court and the Constitution and Looking for America.
