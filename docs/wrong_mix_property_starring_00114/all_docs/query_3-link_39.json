I'm Terry Gross.\n\nMy guest is actor and satirist Harry Shearer. He starred in the\n\nmockumentaries \"This Is Spinal Tap\" and \"A Mighty Wind,\" and with many of the\n\nsame actors made the new movie comedy \"For Your Consideration\" which opens\n\nthis month. He also does many of the voices on \"The Simpsons,\" including Mr.\n\nBurns, Smithers, Principal Skinner, and Ned Flanders. On Public Radio he\n\nhosts a program of music and satire called \"Le Show.\" And now he has a new\n\nsatirical novel called \"Not Enough Indians.\" It's set in the fictional town of\n\nGammage, New York. Just as Gammage is about to declare bankruptcy, the town\n\ncouncil comes up with a scheme to save it. Gammage will petition for Indian\n\ntribal status and try to open a casino. The only problem is, Gammage doesn't\n\nhave many Native Americans so it takes some fancy lobbying to get Indian\n\ntribal status and transform the town into the Filaquonsett Reservation.\n\nHarry, welcome back to FRESH AIR. I want you to do a short reading from the\n\nbook and this kind of describes what happens in the casino once they open it.\n\nMr. HARRY SHEARER: (Reading) \"Ladies and gentlemen, the management of the\n\nFilaquonsett Casino welcomes you and reminds you that at no time during the\n\nshow should flash photography be used as it may panic the snow leopards. And\n\nnow, first up, please welcome the Elvis of Bangkok, Szughat Thunicorn.\"\n\n\"I thought this place used to have big-time entertainment. What the--\"Tony\n\nSilotta put a firm hand on the forearm of Vince Wynn-Stanley.\n\n\"The price of front row comps is you don't knock the talent,\" he hissed\n\nthrough his new mustache. Then he flashed the $10,000 Silotta grin at Eileen,\n\nand with a flourish poured some more Dom in each of their glasses while\n\nSzughat Thunicorn began a rousing rendition of what sounded like \"Fats alyde\n\nmon mon.\"\n\n\"By the way, Eileen, the Warhols really jazz up the fashion arcade. I never\n\nknew he painted Geronimo and those guys.\"\n\n\"He didn't,\" Eileen Wynn-Stanley said while sipping her Dom, \"but Studio\n\nWarholia does, by the hundreds. All the NADAM casinos are buying them. Not,\"\n\nshe added proudly, \"at the price we got them for.\"\n\nGROSS: That's Harry Shearer reading from his new novel, \"Not Enough Indians.\"\n\nSo did you go to Indian gambling casinos to see what they're actually like?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yeah, I wanted to absorb some, as they say, local color, so I\n\nwent to some casinos. There's a fabulous Indian casino in eastern San Diego\n\nCounty, and I went to some casinos along the Mississippi Gulf Coast before\n\nthey got whacked by the hurricane. And I did a lot of reading on the subject\n\nof Indian--they like to call it gaming, of course we would understand it to be\n\ngambling.\n\nGROSS: What did you see there?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Well, I saw the sort of--everything from the most utilitarian\n\nkind of get-in-here-and-gamble-and-get-out, to fairly lavish, if mismatched,\n\nyou know, arrays of tapestries and carvings and, yes, Indian lore up the\n\nwhazoo, as you might say.\n\nGROSS: So is it a landmine to write a book about Native American gambling\n\nwithout feeling like you're inadvertently insulting Native Americans? Do you\n\nknow what I mean? Like you have to walk a line here between figuring out what\n\nit is you're satirizing and what it is that you want to just respect.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Well, you know, in many cases when I satirize something that\n\nmay seem like it's walking the line, I'm really satirizing the way that it's\n\nbeing exploited or treated by the modern American media-political universe.\n\nAnd I think that's true here, you know. I'm satirizing the way white folks\n\nhave discovered that it's now hip to be an Indian or a Native American and how\n\nto do that in a hurry, you know. And I guess I draw that from the way I had\n\nmy bar mitzvah on the fly, you know? I had the...\n\nGROSS: Wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\nMr. SHEARER: I had the quick...\n\nGROSS: Exactly how does your bar mitzvah fit in?\n\nMr. SHEARER: I had the quickie bar mitzvah, you know. I didn't go to Hebrew\n\nschool. I just studied the thing that you're supposed to read real fast and\n\nthen had a bar mitzvah so I could get the gift. And it's sort of the same\n\napproach that these white folks are taking to how to be a Native American.\n\nThat's the similarity.\n\nGROSS: Oh, that's a funny similarity. They don't have to learn the HafTarah\n\nto do it.\n\nMr. SHEARER: That's correct.\n\nGROSS: You don't gamble, so what do you do when you visit casinos?\n\nMr. SHEARER: I appreciate.\n\nGROSS: Not very risky, is it?\n\nMr. SHEARER: I'm an appreciator. No, I just, you know, I'm a fan of--I'm a\n\nstudent of how they have been students of human psychology. And a lot of that\n\nis reflected in the book. So, you know, the absence of right angles in the\n\narchitectural planning of casino buildings always fascinates me because they\n\nhave learned--they have mastered the art of decontextualizing you. You know,\n\nthe early version was no clocks, but they've gone way beyond that. As I ask,\n\nnow there are no right angles. And they've just learned the ways to make you\n\nfeel so disoriented and so apart from your normal environment cues that you\n\nwill be--that your inhibitions will be loosened as a result even before you\n\nstart drinking.\n\nGROSS: Well, Harry, this is a busy time for you. In addition to your new\n\nnovel, you've got a new movie coming out called \"For Your Consideration.\"\n\nThat's the same crew that also did \"Best in Show,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"A\n\nMighty Wind,\" and also some of the same people who were from \"Spinal Tap.\"\n\nMr. SHEARER: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: But this is not a mockumentary. This is, what?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Well, it's a mock-you-very-much. Christopher Guest always\n\nbridles at the term mockumentary because he doesn't think he's mocking in\n\nterms of the tone of those films. But in terms of the camera technique, it is\n\nnot a mock documentary in the sense that it's not a handheld camera that's\n\nmoving around a lot. Chris wanted to make a movie that looked more like a\n\nformal narrative film, so the camera is more in place, except when it's on a\n\ndolly. But in terms of the acting, we're still improvising. The actors are\n\nstill doing the same thing that we've been doing in in all these films, which\n\nis taking the story that's written by Chris and Gene Levy and improvising our\n\ndialogue. The only twist to that is this movie has a movie within the movie.\n\nAnd in the movie within the movie we have scripted dialogue, so there's\n\nscripted dialogue and then there's improvised dialogue. And we would have\n\ndays where, you know, the morning is scripted and the afternoon is improvised,\n\nand as an actor, you can't think of a better day than that.\n\nGROSS: So what's the story and what's the movie within the story?\n\nMr. SHEARER: The story is about a group of independent actors of, let's say,\n\nsecond or--let's be realistic--third tier, who finally get a break and get to\n\nmake this fairly OK film, question mark, called \"Home for Purim.\" That is the\n\nmovie within in a movie. A warm family drama that takes place during World\n\nWar II. And now we're outside the movie within the movie, and we realize that\n\nat some point in the filming of this, there's some Internet buzz about Oscar\n\npossibilities for one or another of the actors in this film. And our story\n\nwas really the story of Oscar buzz and how weird and silly it is and the\n\neffect it can have on people's lives and psyches.\n\nGROSS: And you play one of the third tier actors?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yes. I'm one of the stars of \"Home for Purim,\" Victor Allan\n\nMiller, an actor who--although he's worked for many years in the theater as\n\nwell as film--he's best known for his work as Irv the foot-long wiener in the\n\nFelber hotdog commercials.\n\nGROSS: And did you pattern yourself on anybody in particular? Do you feel\n\nlike you know a lot of actors who are like the actor that you're playing?\n\nMr. SHEARER: No, this is the first time as an actor that I've really\n\npatterned myself after me. I basically realized that if I just stripped away\n\nall of the parts of me that I liked, I would have Victor. If I just took away\n\nwhat I--and may be conceited to regard as--my coping mechanisms, Victor would\n\nbe the quivering pile of protoplasm that resulted. So this really is the\n\nfirst time than I looked inward to create a character rather than outward.\n\nGROSS: And what about your ego vs. Victor's ego?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Equally vulnerable, just equally fragile. It's why my friend\n\nChristopher Guest said to me at one point, in sort of horror, `You don't read\n\nreviews, do you?' And I realized, yeah, that's kind of a stupid thing to do\n\nwhen you have a vulnerable ego, so I stopped and I'm happier. You know,\n\nthey're usually, I guess, they're usually good, people tell me. But I mean\n\nit's just never a good thing for people in this psychic environment to read\n\nreviews. But, yeah, I mean, actors, you know, the only people who are more\n\nperpetually afraid of rejection than actors are salespeople, and unfortunately\n\nthey're the people who run America's major corporations, which tells you why\n\nour economy's in the shape it is today.\n\nGROSS: You know, by working with this repertory company all the time...\n\nMr. SHEARER: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: ...you know, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean and, you know, the\n\npeople who you've made a lot of movies with.\n\nMr. SHEARER: John Michael Higgins, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Jennifer\n\nCoolidge, Jane Lynch. Yes, go ahead.\n\nGROSS: You were all insulating yourself from the kind of rejection that you\n\nwere just talking about, because you're making your movies together, only what\n\nyou need is the money to make the movie but you're not submitting yourself to\n\na casting director, or to a director who's never met who will completely\n\nmisunderstand the true Harry Shearer and where your true genius lies.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Well...\n\nGROSS: You know what I mean?\n\nMr. SHEARER: ...that...\n\nGROSS: It's like, they're not--you don't have to...\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yeah. You're correct. It's a safe zone we're in when we work\n\ntogether and certainly that's one reason why when we sit around, when we know\n\nthat Chris and Gene are working on another script, waiting for the phone to\n\nring so that we get to do it again. But I would possibly substitute another\n\nword for \"safety\" and that's the word \"trust.\" Christopher trusts us as actors\n\nto be able to take a story that he and Gene have written and improvise the\n\nlife of dialogue into it. He trusts the audience to get a comedy that's not\n\nshrill and exaggerated. And we trust Christopher not to put us in situations\n\nthat we don't think are, you know, our areas of best expertise. So I think we\n\nfeel safe, yes, but it's because something very rare in the business is\n\nhappening, which is this atmosphere of trust. Normally, yes, you've gone\n\nthrough these processes and you're working with somebody you may never have\n\nworked for before. My fear is a director will make me--the last take he'll\n\nalways say, `Can we have one that's bigger?' And I know that's the one he's\n\ngoing to use and I'm in dread of that because I don't think I'm good big. I\n\nthink I'm good at this kind of low-key realistic comedy and fortunately that's\n\nthe style that Christopher likes to work in, as well.\n\nGROSS: You have another movie coming out and this one's coming out next year.\n\nIt's a new \"Simpsons\" movie. Can you tell us what the premise is?\n\nMr. SHEARER: I can't tell you anything about it, except that it's coming\n\nout. There is such a penumbra of secrecy that surrounds this movie that it\n\nhas a code name. I went to the studio one day...\n\nGROSS: Oh.\n\nMr. SHEARER: ...and it didn't say \"The Simpsons,\" and I was there for a\n\nrecording session for the movie, and I went to every studio we possibly used\n\nand none of them said \"The Simpsons,\" and I called my office and said, `What's\n\nthe deal?' And it turned out they had adopted a code name and just forgotten\n\nto tell me, which is good code. And I was recording. We were still recording\n\nthe dialogue for the movie and I was in the studio last week in New York, and\n\nat the end, I said to the guy in the studio, `Now are you going to shred the\n\nscript pages?' Because that's sort of the common practice. And he said, `No.'\n\nAnd I was a little surprised. He said, `I have to send them to LA for them to\n\nshred them there.' They didn't even trust him to shred his own pages.\n\nGROSS: Well...\n\nMr. SHEARER: So...\n\nGROSS: ...did you each have your names written on the scripts so they could\n\ntell who the scrip is...\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...absent and...\n\nMr. SHEARER: Oh, yeah. We would be...\n\nGROSS: ...and hold you responsible if your script doesn't show up for the\n\nshredding.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Oh, I think would be shredded if there were a copy that made it\n\nout, but we were made to give them back every time, even though, yes, our\n\nnames are imprinted. Our names are imprinted so frequently on a script page\n\nthat it's sometimes hard to read the dialogue because our names are all over\n\nit. So if you hear my...\n\nGROSS: OK. So I understand that. So tell us the premise anyway. No, just\n\nkidding. I mean right.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yeah, right. No, but if you see the movie and you hear Mr.\n\nBurns just saying, `Shearer, Shearer, Shearer,\" over again, it's because all I\n\ncould read was my name. The premise is that they want to make a lot of money.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Harry Shearer. We'll talk more after a break. This is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: My guest is actor and satirist Harry Shearer. He's written a new\n\nsatirical novel called \"Not Enough Indians.\" He stars in the new movie comedy\n\n\"For Your Consideration,\" which opens this month, and he does many of the\n\nvoices on \"The Simpsons,\" which started its new season last night.\n\nHarry, as a satirist you do a lot of political voices, including the\n\npresident. You also always do the voices of TV news anchors.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: You're in a new era now because...\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...on broadcast news all the voices have changed, you know. It's no\n\nlonger, you know, Ted Koppel and Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather...\n\nMr. SHEARER: I know.\n\nGROSS: ...Peter Jennings, who I'm not sure you did.\n\nMr. SHEARER: I never did Peter Jennings, and Peter made fun of me for not\n\ndoing--he turned the tables and made fun of me for not doing him. I knew the\n\nmelody of Peter Jennings but I never quite had the thing. But I know...\n\n(As Ted Koppel) ...Ted--Ted Koppel, if you will, has gone to cable Vineyards,\n\nto plow new territory, if he might.\n\nMr. SHEARER: And Dan is in even weirder territory now with HDNet. And I'm\n\nsitting by my television trying to work on my Katie Couric impression. How\n\nsad is that? But there we are.\n\nGROSS: What are you getting from her?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Well, a certain corn-fed earnestness. I can't even begin to\n\nstart doing it. My vocal impression of her yet, it's really still a work in\n\nprogress. But there's a sort of roughness and sweetness to her voice, and a\n\nlot of nose in it, too. It's like a whine, if you like. A big nose in that\n\nvoice. But I must say I'm equally fascinated by the Katie Couric dance, the\n\nchoreography of that broadcast. You know, she's--at least in the early weeks\n\nof it--she started off standing. The first segment, she's standing next to\n\nthe desk, right side, just touching her desk. Then the next two segments\n\nshe's sitting at the desk, in the traditional anchor pose, shuffling papers\n\nlike a pro. And in the next two segments she's standing nowhere near the\n\ndesk, in the Tom Brokaw...\n\n(As Tom Brokaw) \"I'm an anchor but I'm standing pose.\"\n\nMr. SHEARER: And then, because you've waited 20 minutes to see her legs, the\n\nlast two segments, she's sitting on the desk. It's so remarkable. If they\n\njust played music to that, they'd have a broadcast.\n\nGROSS: Well, what about Brian Williams? Do you feel like you can get his\n\nvoice?\n\nMr. SHEARER: I feel like I probably can if I can ever get past my grudging\n\nadmiration for him, which I'm working on.\n\nGROSS: Is that a problem, does it get in your way?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yeah. Yeah. Of course it is. You know. The thing that makes\n\nme want to do people's character is something about them drives me crazy. And\n\nI've always recognized the big distinction between people like me, who are\n\ndrawn to satirize those they have a critique of, and other people that have\n\nbeen on shows that I've been on who seem to want to do characters because they\n\nwant to be those people. They're doing characters they admire or had admired\n\nas kids. You know, the names supplied on request.\n\nGROSS: Like?\n\nMr. SHEARER: Oh, you know, when you saw Billy Crystal doing Muhammad Ali.\n\nThere was no critique of Muhammad Ali. Billy, you know, in another life would\n\nhave loved to be Muhammad Ali. When you saw Joe Piscopo do Bruce Springsteen\n\nand Frank Sinatra...\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. SHEARER: ...there was no critique there. Just Joe wanted to be those\n\nguys, would have loved to have been those guys. I don't particularly want to\n\nbe anybody I've done. I'm doing them because there's something about what\n\nthey do or the way they do it that bothers me, and humor is my way of making\n\nthat critique.\n\nGROSS: Harry, you've been living for several years in New Orleans a good deal\n\nof the time.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: As your listeners know cause your show is often broadcast from there.\n\nHow did you first decide to move there?\n\nMr. SHEARER: It was a weekend that I took off from doing a movie in Seattle\n\nand flew down to New Orleans for the jazz fest. And I'd--New Orleans was one\n\nof those places like Rio or like Brazil, generally, that I thought, `Well,\n\nyeah, I'd love to go there. I've heard such great things about it.' And the\n\nminute I finally got there, my instantaneous response was, `What has kept me\n\nfrom being here so long?' It was an almost instantaneous falling in love with\n\nthe place. And finally, when I met my wife--met the woman who was to become\n\nmy wife, Judith Owen, and took her down there for the first time, I was just\n\npraying that she would love it as much as I do. And, fortunately, she loves\n\nit, if anything, even more. And so we bought a place there.\n\nAnd it's a very deep place. It's 300 years old, and it hangs onto tradition\n\nand history in a way that no other American city really does. It doesn't have\n\na little oldie townie section. It is an old town. And so when what happened\n\nlast year happened, it was like seeing a loved one mugged, and you were angry\n\nand sad, and yet your love had, if anything, strengthened and deepened. And\n\nit's going through a mental health crisis right now. It's going through a\n\nslow motion disaster that's comparable to the flooding disaster in the erosion\n\nand disappearance of the wetlands, which protect us from hurricanes, and so\n\nthere's a lot still to be done.\n\nGROSS: Did you feel like you've been changed as a person by living in New\n\nOrleans and seeing your adopted city through, you know, just really a\n\nhorrible, tragic period? It's a really sobering thing for someone like you\n\nwho always kind of, you know, professionally dwells on the funny side of\n\nthings.\n\nMr. SHEARER: Yeah. It's changed my public persona. You know, I've always\n\nbeen a fairly serious person with a funny front to me. You know, one of the\n\nreasons I love New Orleans is because the city never lost its sense of humor.\n\nThis year's carnival was a spectacularly moving public ritual in which\n\npeople--who had been having these incredible arduous days gutting their houses\n\nand fighting with insurance adjustors and all the other stuff--came out in the\n\nstreets to laugh at this two-week parade of editorial cartoons making vicious,\n\nwicked, bawdy fun of all the miscreants that had created their disaster. And\n\nto see that as a civic response, you know, that laughter could really be a\n\ncivic response to a disaster, you know, that's my town. I'm so proud of it\n\nfor having been able to do that, and for, you know, facing down everybody who\n\nsaid, `Oh, Mardi Gras. Why should you be doing that when you've got serious\n\nbusiness to do?' It was really serious business to be able to laugh at the\n\npeople who had put us in this mess.\n\nGROSS: Well, Harry Shearer, thanks a lot for talking with us.\n\nMr. SHEARER: My pleasure, Terry. Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Harry Shearer's new satirical novel is called \"Not Enough Indians.\"\n\nHis new film, \"For Your Consideration,\" opens next month. He also has a new\n\nCD of his satirical sketches from his Public Radio program \"Le Show,\" and a\n\nnew DVD of his sketches from \"Saturday Night Live\" and his comedy specials.\n\nI'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Lebanese TV anchor May Chidiac discusses her life,\n\ncareer and the bombing where she lost an arm and a leg\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nIn spite of the bomb that was planted in her car a year ago, and in spite of\n\nthe fact that she lost an arm and a leg in the explosion, May Chidiac is back\n\non the air. She's a journalist who works for the Lebanese Broadcasting\n\nCorporation and had hosted its popular morning program. She believes that\n\nSyrians were behind the bombing and that the murder attempt was retribution\n\nfor interviews she conducted that were critical of Syria's involvement in\n\nLebanon. On the last broadcast she did before the bombing, she spoke with an\n\nanalyst from the Lebanese daily paper Al-Nahar and discussed the possible\n\ninvolvement of Syria in the assassination of the former Lebanese prime\n\nminister, Rafik Hariri. After several months of recovery in France, she's now\n\nback on the air, hosting a weekly program. Last month she came to the US to\n\naccept a Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media\n\nFoundation.\n\nMay Chidiac, welcome to FRESH AIR and congratulations on your award. When you\n\nwere speaking out on your program, did you think that you were risking your\n\nlife? Did you think that you were going to be hurt as punishment for what you\n\nwere saying on your broadcast?\n\nMs. MAY CHIDIAC: So many persons were threatened by that time. We were\n\nhearing a lot about a list, meaning that the list was about the persons who\n\nwere supposed to be killed next. But I thought that everybody was threatened\n\nexcept me, because it was not a habit in our country to target women\n\njournalists, so I was a pioneer. And I know they were not happy about what I\n\nwas saying, but I never thought that that they would reach that point of\n\nkilling me and putting explosives under the seat of my car.\n\nGROSS: So you thought that because you were a woman, you would be safe? This\n\nis like a strange form of chivalry, or etiquette, to not kill a woman?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: I didn't hear before about a journalist woman killed in Lebanon\n\nfor her outspoken. And maybe because I was not really involved in politics,,\n\nbecause the journalists who were killed before me were really activists in the\n\nCedar Revolution, and I was only a journalist covering what was going on and\n\ngiving comments on the situation. So I was really astonished. I really\n\ndidn't believe that they could attack me because I was just doing my job as a\n\njournalist. I was not an activist in the politics so.\n\nGROSS: You said that there was a list of journalists...\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Exactly.\n\nGROSS: ...who...\n\nMs> CHIDIAC: Not only journalists, politicians. I mean politicians, even\n\njournalists involved in politics.\n\nGROSS: Were you on the list? Did you know if your name...\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: No, I didn't. Nobody told me I as on the list. I had some\n\nfriends who, for example, a friend of mine asked me once to pick him up from\n\nhis house because we were invited to have dinner at another friend's house, so\n\nhe asked me to pick him up and take him with me. So when I arrived to his\n\nhouse, I saw many in security guards. I asked him. `Why are these men here?'\n\nHe told me because, `I'm threatened,' Knellis told me, `I'm on the list and I\n\nneeded some protection.' And after a few days, I was the one to be targeted,\n\nthe one who they wanted to finish with and to kill. So, you know, they were\n\ntalking about a list, but nobody told me that I was on this list.\n\nGROSS: What happened when you got into the car on the day that you were\n\nbombed?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: That day, after finishing my show, I asked a friend if he would\n\nbe interested in going with me to visit St. Charbel Monastery. You know, I'm\n\nChristian and I felt that I needed to go and to pray. So I went with my\n\nfriend and we had--it's a very beautiful region, so we had lunch there after\n\nfinishing praying. And I came back to take my car and to go back home. My\n\nmother was waiting for me to have coffee with her. So I got into the car. I\n\nclosed the door. I turned towards the backseat to be able to put the candles\n\nI brought with me, and suddenly the explosion took place.\n\nI heard the blast and I wondered what was happening. It was terrible. I was\n\nturning around myself like a chicken, when you cook it in the oven. I saw\n\nblack snow around me, and I passed away for a few seconds. And I heard a\n\nvoice telling me, `Get up, my girl. Get up, my girl.' And suddenly I woke up.\n\nI found myself laying on the backseat, and I was pushing myself out of the\n\ncar, pulling myself out of the car. I wanted just to have fresh air. That\n\nsecond I was feeling better, I had to put my head out of the car just to be\n\nable to breathe.\n\nIt was so painful, but I didn't realize at that moment that I lost already my\n\nleft leg and my left hand. I was pulling myself out of the car, and I as\n\nshouting, maybe someone could hear me, because, you know, on a Sunday\n\nafternoon in Lebanon, especially in the Christian area in Jezzine, nobody is\n\nin the streets. Everybody's having rest at home. So I felt it was really an\n\neternity before somebody heard me and before I saw somebody coming to help me.\n\nBut the most terrible thing is that I saw my left hand still attached to my\n\nleft arm with a small piece of...(unintelligible)...and I was pointing at my\n\nhand just hoping that maybe in surgery they would be able to save it. I\n\ndidn't know that a big part of my left arm was damaged and that it was\n\nimpossible to save it. So after a few days, when I woke up, I knew how much\n\nmy body was damaged.\n\nGROSS: Do you have any idea who bombed you, who attacked you?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: I'm confident, I'm sure, that the Syrians are behind it, but\n\nI'm sure...\n\nGROSS: The Syrians.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: ...at the same time. Yeah. I'm sure at the same time that\n\nthey gave orders to local agents, pro-Syrian people in Lebanon, who placed the\n\nexplosives under the seats of my car. And it was a cold-blooded person who\n\nsaw me getting into the car and who decided at that time, at that second,\n\nminute, that he had to push the button to kill me.\n\nGROSS: So it was a remote control bomb.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Exactly.\n\nGROSS: It wasn't a bomb that was set off by your car ignition.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Exactly. Exactly.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm. So when you say you think the Syrians were behind that, do\n\nyou mean the Syrian government?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: The Syrian regime. The people on the head of this regime.\n\nBecause they wanted to keep their control over Lebanon, be certain that there\n\nwould be chaos in Lebanon after they leave. And I as threatened once even\n\nbefore they left Lebanon. After one of my shows, they called my boss and told\n\nhim--the big officer, the Syrian officer in Lebanon, whose name was Biston\n\nBizali. And we used to call him in Lebanon \"Abu Abdu.\" And he told my boss,\n\n`I will drink from her blood.' But really, I thought at that time that it was\n\njust for intimidating me. I didn't think it was that serious, and at the end\n\nthey would try to kill me.\n\nGROSS: OK, you thought that they would try to intimidate you, but not\n\nnecessarily try to kill you.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Exactly. Exactly.\n\nGROSS: Well, they tried to kill you but it doesn't sound like they've\n\nsucceeded in intimidating you because you're back on the air, you're talking\n\nabout this here and in other places. Did you considering being intimidated?\n\nIn other words, did you consider backing down? Did you consider leaving\n\nLebanon? Did you consider staying out of sight...\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Never ever.\n\nGROSS: ...and not speaking out, not going back on TV?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: No, no, no. Because all my suffering would have been for\n\nnothing. You know, after you go through all what I had to suffer from. I had\n\n26 surgeries in less than nine months. I had 26 general anesthesia, so I had\n\nvery terrible moments. I suffered a lot. So I never, never could imagine\n\nthat I'll hide in a corner and prefer to stay away of the danger, because all\n\nof my suffering would have been for nothing. And I considered that I have a\n\nmission in one way or another because I have to be the voice of those who\n\ndisappear, who were killed and didn't have the chance to escape. So even\n\nthough I lost my left arm and my left leg, I have now prostheses which are so\n\nperfect, and I'm back on air.\n\nI was on air exactly 10 months after the attack. It was quite a miracle to be\n\nable to be back on air. Thank God, my face was saved. It was not damaged, so\n\npeople were looking at me and were saying, `Oh, God, how come she's even more\n\nbeautiful than before?' This is what I heard after being on air, and it's\n\nbecause I have an aesthetical hand. It doesn't show that have problem with my\n\nhand. I cannot move it the way I want, but at least it's beautiful. It's not\n\na problem if I appear with it on air. And I'm still an outspoken journalist,\n\nand I still consider that I have to defend the freedoms of sovereignty, the\n\nindependence of my country, and I consider that Lebanon deserves to have this.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Lebanese journalist May Chidiac. We'll talk more after a\n\nbreak. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: My guest is May Chidiac. A journalist who hosts a program on the\n\nLebanese Broadcasting Corporation. Last year a bomb was planted in her car\n\nand she lost an arm and a leg in the explosion.\n\nSo how do you think your mission as a journalist has changed since the attack?\n\nWhat do you do on your show now? Do you speak out yourself? Do you have on\n\nother people who are outspoken? Do you take a point of view on the show or\n\nhave on both sides?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: You know...\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: ...I do the same--my job the same way I used to do it, that\n\nmeans I really consider that I have to be objective, in a way or another.\n\nThat means I'm a professional, after all. But, you know, the difference\n\nbetween a journalist and another is that when you put the light on some issues\n\nand some other journalist may be afraid to do so, or prefer not to put the\n\nlight on this because it's dangerous. So I take all the information I can\n\nfind in the newspapers, all the information I can get from everywhere, and I\n\ndare to put the light on all these informations and to ask my guests to do\n\nsome comments on this. And I think that this is the best way of clearing\n\nthings and the best way to attract the attention on some delicate issues that\n\nmaybe some other journalist won't dare to do.\n\nGROSS: You say you're a journalist and not an activist, but I know you were\n\nconsidering a run for Parliament.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Exactly.\n\nGROSS: And I believe you postponed that for medical reasons, but you're still\n\nconsidering running sometime in the next few years. Why do you want to run\n\nfor Parliament?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Because I have a place to express myself and it is on air, but\n\nmy role is to ask questions and have the answers from others. Sometimes I\n\nfeel like if I would like to give the answers myself, to be free to give the\n\ncomments on the situation. And I consider that I am a part of a certain\n\nenvironment. That means I'm a Christian Lebanese woman, and I consider that\n\nour presence in Lebanon is really threatened because everything has been done\n\nto push people to leave the country because they are so desperate they want to\n\nleave. They have no more hope in Lebanon, and they want to go abroad to find\n\nsome opportunities to be able to work safely without having to rebuild\n\neverything. So maybe I'll have to be the voice of these people, and maybe the\n\nthe Parliament would be a place where I can be the voice of all those who lost\n\ntheir voice or of the voice of all those who don't have the way of expressing\n\nthemselves directly on air.\n\nGROSS: When you're talking about how a lot of people feel forced to leave\n\nLebanon now, are you referring to the war over the summer between Israel and\n\nHezbollah, in which Israel bombed Lebanon? Is that what you're referring to?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: During the last 30 years, many Lebanese left Lebanon, but\n\nespecially during this last war in July. The Lebanese people were not\n\nexpecting this war. They were expecting to have a prosperous summer. They\n\nwere expecting to have many tourists coming to Lebanon. They were thinking\n\nthat we'll have peace at the end and the situation in Lebanon will come back\n\nto its normal status. But what happened is that the war started, we didn't\n\nhave a word to say about it because the Hezbollah was the one who decided this\n\nwar. And Israel responded in a very terrible way, killing so much, so many\n\npeople, but Hezbollah was the one to start and they attacked Israel.\n\nWe had the example of what happened in Gaza when they kidnapped an Israeli\n\nsoldier, and we saw how Israel responded to that. So when Hezbollah attacked\n\nIsrael because the Arabs consider themselves as resistance and that we still\n\nhave the Shebaa Farm to free, because it's Lebanese land which is still under\n\nthe Israeli control, so it was an excuse to attack Israel and to kidnap two\n\nsoldiers, two Israeli soldiers.\n\nAnd then Israel decided to respond. We found ourselves stuck in the middle.\n\nWe didn't know what to do. That means that Hezbollah can declare war whenever\n\nthey want and Israel is here, ready to answer and to destroy all the\n\ninfrastructure in Lebanon. So the Lebanese people found themselves in the\n\nmiddle. They didn't have a word to say between Israel and Hezbollah. We were\n\nhere and watching what was going on in our country, losing our hope in\n\nrebuilding our country because it was not a decision made by the Lebanese\n\ngovernment.\n\nGROSS: I believe that you returned to Lebanon in July after having had\n\nmedical treatment in France. So did you return just in time for the war?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: It's really amazing. I arrived to Lebanon on the 11th of July,\n\nwhich means a few hours before the war started. So I don't know if I was the\n\nlucky one or if it was meant to be. That means if I had to go back to work in\n\nan urgent way, this is why I was in Lebanon anyway, I wouldn't have been happy\n\nto be outside.\n\nGROSS: Can you talk about what it was like to return home, planning to\n\nfinally go back on the air, you know, months after you were attacked? You\n\nwere in a very fragile state when you get back. You know, you've lost a leg,\n\nyou've lost an arm, you're still recovering from that. So in this fragile\n\nstate, you're now facing a war. I don't know if your neighborhood was bombed\n\nor not. I'm not sure where you live and where you work.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: My neighborhood was not bombed, but where I was, where I live,\n\nI heard every, every bomb that fall on the southern suburbs of Beirut. So it\n\nwas terrible. You know, the last explosion I heard was the one that took a\n\npart of my body away, and I was really tense when I was hearing all these\n\nexplosions beside me. But I considered that since I was in Lebanon, I had to\n\ngo back on air and to resume my work, and this is what I did. It was the 25th\n\nof July. And it was a coincidence, but the last time I was on air was the\n\n25th of September, and I resumed my work on the 25th of July.\n\nGROSS: So did you ever think to yourself that you had possibly survived the\n\nattack on you only to come home just before a war and then possibly die in the\n\nbombing? I mean, did you think that maybe you'd survived only to die in the\n\nwar?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: You know, I believe in God and God's will. That means,\n\nwhenever my hour will come, I will die. Because it was a miracle I survived\n\nthat blast when my car exploded. So if I was meant to die in that war, I\n\nwould have been killed. So I consider my life will continue until God will\n\ndecide that my life has to stop somewhere, and I'll die at that time.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Lebanese journalist May Chidiac. We'll talk more after a\n\nbreak. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: My guest is May Chidiac, a journalist who hosts a program on the\n\nLebanese Broadcasting Corporation. Last year a bomb was planted in her car\n\nand she lost an arm and a leg in the explosion. Now from what I read, it\n\nsounds like before you were attacked, before the car bomb, you hosted a show\n\ncalled \"Good Day.\"\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Exactly.\n\nGROSS: But now you're hosting a show called \"With Audacity,\" which is...\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Yes.\n\nGROSS: ...a different tone than \"Good Day.\" So is the show changed or is it\n\njust the title that's different?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: No, the show changed, because I used to present a political\n\ntalk show, but it was a morning talk show on LBC, and it's a daily program.\n\nThat means we are three to present it. And I didn't choose the name. I\n\nstarted in this program and the name was--like if it's \"Good Morning,\n\nAmerica,\" or something like that.\n\nGROSS: Exactly.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: So when I came back to work, you know, it's not easy to me to\n\nbe able to be ready on air at 10 in the morning. I have some preparations, I\n\nhave to put the prosthesis, and I'm still really fragile, so I prefer to have\n\nan evening talk show. And it was my talk show, that means once a week. And I\n\nhad to choose the name. I've chosen it because of the spirit of my program,\n\nbecause I used to say things with audacity, without being afraid, and I invite\n\nmy guests and ask them to speak freely and with courage. So it's related to\n\nmy personality and to the way I want the program to be.\n\nGROSS: Are more guests willing to come on your program now that they know\n\nwhat happened to you? I mean, I'm sure that made you even more famous in the\n\ncountry. I'm not saying you were looking for that kind of fame, don't get me\n\nwrong, but I'm sure you're quite famous now. So does it make it easier for\n\nyou to get people to come on the show who you want to talk to?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: No, I used to have all the guests I wanted in Lebanon because\n\nin Lebanon everybody is interested in politics, and I used to have my Sunday\n\nmorning show, and Sunday morning, it's like a big time. It's a prime time,\n\nlike in the evening because everybody's resting at home and everybody is\n\nwatching the TV, especially in winter. And they used to watch it so I was\n\nable to have all the guests I wanted. But now it's different because when you\n\nhave one weekly talk show, you can have special--and cover special events or\n\nhave special guests. That means I was able to do an interview last week with\n\nMs. Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state. So it makes things different and\n\nanother caliber of guests and of interviews so. And I wanted from the\n\nbeginning all the guests and all the audience, the viewers, to forget what\n\nhappened to me. That means, when I'm on the air, I look exactly the same way\n\nI looked before. And this makes people forget what happened to me, and I'm\n\nhappy about it because I don't want them to say, `Oh, pity.' No, what I want\n\nthem to do is I want them just to give their comments on my show as a\n\njournalist, not as a journalist who suffered and who lost her arm and her leg.\n\nGROSS: Do you still face threats against you?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Yes. I'm still on the list. Now they've told me, I am on the\n\nlist.\n\nGROSS: So what does that mean? That means there's no safety for you as long\n\nas you're in Lebanon.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: No, there is no safety for anybody in Lebanon. All those who\n\ndare to speak on behalf of the freedom of Lebanon are still threatened.\n\nGROSS: Do you have bodyguards?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Before the accident, I prefer to be on my own all the time.\n\nEven though I was attending social occasions, I used to go back home, maybe\n\nsometimes at 2:00 in the morning, alone. I'm really independent. And now\n\nthings changed, especially because I cannot drive anymore. I need to have a\n\ndriver with me, so and I need somebody to help me to get into the car. So now\n\nI have two men with me all the time because I really need them to help me to\n\ndrive and to get into the car. But they are at the same time as bodyguards,\n\nif you want, and as drivers, but it's not a way to protect yourself. You\n\nknow, whenever you'll be targeted, they'll find a way to kill you.\n\nGROSS: You've resumed your life as a journalist. Do you feel comfortable and\n\nadjusted to your prosthetics?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: You know, it's not easy to sit on the chair because they have a\n\nlong talk show. It's a two hours talk show, so sometimes it's really painful\n\nbecause I feel a backache, and especially that I had a surgery in my back. It\n\ntook 12 hours and I have a metal stick in my back. And, you know, whenever\n\nI'm tired I feel this very painful and--but nobody--I don't show it to the\n\npublic. I try to keep things as normal as I can till I finish, and then when\n\nI go back home, sometimes I'll start crying because it's so painful. But I\n\nwanted to go back to work and I wanted to do my job the best way I could. So,\n\nanyway, it's OK with me.\n\nGROSS: Do you ever watch videotapes of the broadcasts that you did before you\n\nwere attacked, and is it difficult for you to watch yourself before you were\n\nattacked?\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: You know, the IWMF, who is giving me this award for Courage in\n\nJournalism, they are showing a small report on me, and they put inside some\n\nfeatures, some tapes before the accident. So really, believe me, I still look\n\nthe same, but the problem is when I look to myself in the mirror, when I'm not\n\ndressed, you know?\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: I'm another woman right now, a half of me is not here anymore,\n\nso it's not that joyful but I accept what happen to me and I have to continue.\n\nGROSS: Well, good luck. Thank you very much.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: And congratulations on your award.\n\nMs. CHIDIAC: Thank you. Thanks a lot."
