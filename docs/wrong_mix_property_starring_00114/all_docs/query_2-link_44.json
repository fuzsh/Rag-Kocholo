        "text": "E. G. & Mrs. Stella\n\nHarriman ELLIOTT G. HARRIMAN, who now maintains his home in the attractive little village of Alger, has been a resident of Hardin county since his childhood days and has long been known as one of the substantial and representative citizens of the county, where he has been identified with agricultural pursuits and other lines of productive business enterprise objective appreciation of sterling worth of character. He is a representative of one of the honored pioneer families of Ohio and one that was founded in America in the colonial epoch.\n\nElliott G. Harriman was born in Delaware county, Ohio, on the 5th of February, 1851, and is a son of William and Evaline (Johnson) Harriman, whose marriage was solemnized in Logan county, this state. William Harriman was born in Logan county on the 6th of April, 1829, and was a son of Simpkins Harriman, whose father, David Harriman, was born in 1755, being a son of David Harriman, who was born in 1710 and died in 1778. The latter was a son of John Harriman, who was born in 1680 and whose death occurred in 1740; his father was Rev. John Harriman who was born 1647 and died in 1704. This honored ancestor was graduated in Harvard College as a member of the class of 1667, was a man of distinguished attainments and for twenty years served as pastor of a church in New Haven, Connecticut. He devoted thirty-four eyars to the work of the ministry and in the archives of New England history his name finds honorable mention. He was a man of John Harriman, who was born in Rowley, Yorkshire, England, in 1608, and who was the founder of the family in America, whither he came in 1638, settling in New Haven, Connecticut, and becoming a man of prominence and influence in the colony. His death occurred in 1681.\n\nSimpkins Harriman, grandfather of the subject of this review, was a native of the state of Pennsylvania, and came to Ohio about the year 1825, and he became one of the sterling pioneers of Logan county, where he secured a tract of wild land and reclaimed a farm, continuing his residence in that county until his death. There his son William was reared to manhood under the conditions and influences of the pioneer days and there was identified with agricultural pursuits until he moved to Delaware county, which continued to be his home for a few years. About the year 1853 William Harriman came to Hardin county and purchased a farm in Dudley township, where he became a successful agriculturist and stock-grower and a citizen who wielded no little influence in local affairs. He was a man of sturdy integrity, of strong individuality and of indefatigable industry, so that he attained to a due measure of success in connection with his business affairs. He lived an labored to goodly ends and his name merits a place on the roll of those who have contributed to the social and material upbuilding of the county. He continued to reside on his old homestead farm until 1878, when he moved to Kenton, where he died, on Mar. 7, 1895, at which time he was sixty-five years and eleven months old; his devoted wife, who had been a cherished companion and helpmeet, passed to the life eternal in 1900, at the age of seventy years, both having been members of the United Brethren and later of the Disciples church. Of their children Elliott G. was the first born; Sarah J. is the wife of Ray B. Thompson, of Kenton, this county; John E. died at the age of seventeen years; Mary E. is the wife of William Saunders and they reside near Marysville, Union county, Ohio; and Lydia A. is the wife of John McMahon, a prosperous farmer near Kenton, Hardin county.\n\nElliott Green Harriman, the immediate subject of this sketch, was about three years of age at the time of the family removal from Delaware county to Hardin county, and on the home farm in Dudley township he was reared to years of maturity, early beginning to assist in the work of the farm and in the meanwhile attending the district schools in which he continued his studies during the winter terms until he was about eighteen years of age. That he made good use of the advantages thus afforded him is evident when we revert to the fact that he became a successful and popular teacher in the district schools of his home county, having initiated his labors in the pedagogic profession when eighteen years of age. In the year 1871 he was a student in the Ohio Northern University at Ada, and after leaving this institution he continued teaching, to which vocation he devoted his attention for a total of about six years, being identified with farming during the summer seasons and acting as schoolmaster during the winter terms.\n\nThe active career of Mr. Harriman has been one of close and successful identification with agricultural pursuits until within recent years, and he is still the owner of a farm in Marion township. He took up his residence on his farm in that township on the 10th of January, 1892, and there he continued to live until 1903, when he moved to the village of Alger, where he is now successfully engaged in the real-estate and insurance business. Besides his farm in Marion township, near Alger, he is also the owner of a well improved farm of eighty acres in Allen county, this state. He has been enterprising and progressive as a farmer and business man and has not been denied a generous measure of success in connection with his well directed endeavors. His hold upon popular confidence and esteem is most secure, being based upon sterling elements of character and genial and kindly attitude in his relations with his fellow men. He and his wife are zealous and valued members of the Methodist Episcopal church in their home village, and in a fraternal way he is affiliated with Ada Lodge No. 344, free and accepted Masons, at Ada, this county.\n\nIn politics Mr. Harriman has ever found the Republican party worthy of his unqualified allegiance and he takes a lively interest in the\n\nquestions and issues of the hour, besides which he is essentially progressive and public-spirited in connection with civic affairs of a more localized order. While residing on his farm he served two terms as clerk of Dudley township, and for eight years he was a member of the board of trustees of Marion township. In Alger he has served as a member of the village council and as president of the board of education.\n\nOn the 6th of March, 1873, was solemnized the marriage of Mr. Harriman to Miss Nancy E. Richey who was born in New Dover, Union county, Ohio, on the 9th of November, 1854, and who is a daughter of Joseph N. and Edna (Farnum) Richey, both of whom were born in Union county, Ohio, the former on the 12th of March, 1822, and the latter in 1837. Joseph Richey was for many years successfully engaged in business as a buyer and shipper of live stock and he passed the closing years of his life in Union county, where he died on the 11th of May 1882. His wife survived him until the 1st of February, 1907, when she too was summoned to the \"land of the Leal.\" William Richey grandfather of Mrs. Herriman, was a native of Scotland. Mr. and Mrs. Harriman became the parents of four children, concerning whom he following brief record is entered: Calvin A. who was born Feb. 9, 1874, is now a successful and popular teacher in the public schools of Allen county, this state; William G. who was born on the 27th of November, 1875, died on the 1st of the following May; Charles E., who was born Nov. 27, 1879, is a telegraph operator, employed by the Erie Railroad Company at Boone Grove, Indiana; and John E., who was born Oct. 27, 1896, is a student in the graded schools of Alger.\n\nSource: A Twentieth Century History of Hardin County, Ohio - Vol. II - Publ.

Hiestand\n\nALFRED HITES - A man of industry, enterprise and ability, Alfred Hites, of McDonald township, occupies an assured position among the successful agriculturists of the Buckeye state, of whom, mayhap, no other county can boast so large a number in proportion to its population as Hardin. A son of the late George Hites, he was born in this township Mar. 3, 1848, coming from German ancestry.\n\nA native of Rockingham county, Virginia, George Hites was born July 14, 1815. As a young man he migrated to the western frontier, locating in Carroll county, where he lived until after his marriage. In 1839 he bought sixty-two and one-half acres of wild land in McDonald township, Hardin county, and having by dint of sturdy pioneer labor cleared a large part of it he subsequently bought another timbered tract of equal area, and continued his agricultural work. On the homestead which he redeemed from teh wilderness he spent the remainder of his life, passing away May 15, 1898. He married, in Carroll county, Ohio, Elizabeth Hatfield, who was born Mar. 15, 1815, and died Nov. 10, 1896. To them six children were born, namely: William of Kenton, married Caroline Spencer, and of the seven children born of their union four died in infancy, Adam died at the age of three months, and the other two, Anna and Arthur Banning, are residents of Hardin county; Mary Ann, born June 9, 1840, died in 1842; Marianna, born Sept. 30, 1849, died in the same year; Alfred, the special subject of this sketch; Nancy Jane, who was born June 4, 1852, and died Mar. 2, 1874, married P. Sumner, of Roundhead, and had one child, now deceased; and George Westley, born July 20, 1857, died Aug. 14, 1857.\n\nEducated in the district schools, Alfred Hites was early initiated into the mysteries of farming, and finding that occupation congenial to his tastes as well as profitable he has since devoted his attention to the pursuit of agriculture. He now owns forty-eight and one-half acres of the land belonging formerly to the parental homestead, and in its care and management has met with most satisfactory results. Politically a stanch supporter of the principles of the Republican party, Mr. Hites has never shirked the responsibilities of public office, but has served as township supervisor and as a school director. Religiously he is a valued member of the Baptist church.\n\nOn Dec. 2, 1875, Mr. Hites was united in marriage with Alice Willard, who was born, May 24, 1858, in Mercer county, Missouri, a daughter of the late Joseph Willard. Mr. Willard was twice married, by his first wife having three children, namely: John Henry, who served in the Civil war, and was killed in battle; Martha Jane; and Mary Elizabeth. Mr. Willard married for his second wife Elizabeth Hudnut, and of the children born of their union six grew to mature life, as follows: William; James; Emeline; Joseph Fremont, deceased; Alice, wife of Mr. Hites; and Jennie. William Willard, a resident of Holmes county, Ohio, married first Mary Berry, who died in early womanhood, leaving one child, Jennie, of Cleveland. William married for his second wife Minnie MacLean, and they have had the following children: Delmar; Jennie, deceased; Harry; and Fannie. James Willard, who lives in Iowa, married Rachel McGinnis, and to them five children have been born, Thomas; Clara Belle; Effie, Robert; and a child that died in infancy. Emeline Willard, of Wayne county, widow of the late John Saunders, born him six children, Frank, deceased; Thomas, a resident of Wayne county; Idell, deceased; Jennie, wife of Harvey Burnett, has two children; Hazel, wife of Harry Cliff, has one child; and Maggie residing with her mother.

Shearer, living at home; Edna Shearer married John Stink, of Pittsburg, and has four children; Charles Shearer, single, resides with his parents; Harry Shearer, single, resides with his parents; Harry Shearer, also living at home; Walter, living at home; and Rachel Shearer, deceased.\n\nSeven children have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Hites, namely: a child that died in infancy; Rosette; Erma Virginia; Bertha; Homer Emerson; Leslie Harrison, living with his parents; and Blanche, living at home. Rosette Hites, the oldest daughter, married Charles Hannakrat, of Logan county, Ohio, and into their home five children have been born, namely: Grace Reed, living with her grandparents; Myrl; Daisy Verona; Alice Odessa, deceased; and Ethel Virginia.

HIVELY, who owns and occupies a fine farm of ninety acres in Washington township, Hardin county, Ohio, is one of the representative farmers and highly respected citizens of this locality. Mr. Hively was born on the farm on which he now lives, June 1, 1853, son of Samuel and Mary (Lower) Hively, natives of Columbiana county, this state. At an early day in the history of Hardin county, Samuel Hively came here and purchased three eighty-acre tracts, built a log house of his family, and in true pioneer style settled down to the work of clearing and cultivating his land. In time, his primitive cabin gave way to a substantial resdence of modern construction, and in place of the forest were well cultivated fields. To him and his wife were born six children, namely: Malinda A., Amanda A., George A., Elizabeth, David and Emma, all now living in Hardin county. The parents died here in 1899, the father's death occurring two weeks before the mother's. Her parents, Daniel and Barbara E. (Obenour) Lower, were prominent early settlers of Columbiana county. Daniel Hively entered two eighty-acre tracts from the government and gave the land to his children.\n\nGeorge A. Hively grew up on his father's farm and received his education in the district school, and here he has continued in the same occupation in which his ancestors were engaged. His father cleared two of the three eighties above referred to, and he has cleared the other. Since 1875 he has owned the farm on which he lives.\n\nIn 1874, George A. Hively married Miss Mary Lentz, daughter of John and Mary (Daniels) Lentz; and the fruits of this union are three sons: Anthony S., born May 16, 1876; David P., February 11, 1879, and William A., May 31, 1887. Anthony S., the eldest son, is a prosperous farmer and has eighty acres of valuable land adjacent to his father's which he has owned since 1902. He was married in 1900, and has two children, Paul M. and Corlean M. His wife, formerly Miss Lena Casper, daughter of John M. and Minnie Casper, was born on her father's farm in Washington township, Hardin county, Oct. 15, 1875; David F. married in March, 1909, Gertrude Slater, of Henry county, and they have one child Esther E., born Nov. 7, 1909, William A. was married June 3, 1909 to Mary Haub of Washington township, Hardin county.\n\nSource: A Twentieth Century History of Hardin County, Ohio - Vol. II - Publ.
