Insurgency in Burma has been a problem for the government since independence in 1948. Originally the chief threat to Rangoon's con- trol came from two separate Communist forces --the Red Flag (extremist) Communists and the White Flag (orthodox or moderate) Communists whose base of operations was in central Burma. Both groups drew their personnel from the Burman ethnic majority. The Red Flag and White Flag Communists gained relatively lit- tle support from the peasant population and were largely eliminated from their strong- holds by the end of 1950. They maintain the ability to launch sporadic raids and ambushes on the main lines of communications in the Irrawaddy valley and in the Irrawaddy delta area, but are based in the sparsely popu- lated hills. These two Communist insurgent forces are estimated at 500 for the Red Flags and 1,500 for the White Flags. There is no evidence of significant assistance or direc- tion of either of these forces by outside Communist authorities. 2: The insurgency of ethnic minorities is a more serious matter. There are insur- gent movements in each of the three largest of the ethnic minority communities-.the Karens, Shans and Kachins--and similar move- ments threaten among other ethnic elements. The basic cause for the ethnic insurgency is the historical antipathy of the minori- ties to the dominance of the Burman majority. This has been augmented by the arrogance of Burman officers and men stationed among the minorities and by the government's effort to \"Burmanize\" the country--to develop a single linguistic and cultural base. 3. The largest and most serious of the minority forces is the Karen National Defense Organization, which went into revolt in De- cember 1948. It numbers about 6,000 and the core of its fighting force is made up of former army personnel trained under the Brit- ish. Driven out of the Burman-dominated Ir- rawaddy basin, it has fallen back on positions CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO 1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 CONFIDENTIAL of strength among its fellow-Karens in the hills of eastern Burma along the Thai border. The Karen antagonism for Burmans is so deep- seated that military conquest appears to be the only hope for the elimination of the KNDO. Of the various ethnic insurgent forces in Burma, only the KNDO appears to have been infiltrated to any degree by the Communists --and then only in the isolated delta area below Rangoon. There appears to be no con- nection with alien Communist groups. 4. The Shan State Independence Army and the Kachin Independence Army, operating in the eastern Shan State and in the Kachin State, oppose the Rangoon Government for the same reasons as the Karens do. Their revolt started later, in 1959 and 1960, and has been centered in the ethnic states where Burmans are few. The two forces are estimated at 3,000 and 2,000 respectively, and are still in the early stages of organization. Through a Nationalities Liberation Alliance, they are associated with the Karens, and thus, indi- rectly, with the Burmese Communists but have no known connection with foreign Communist organizations. Other ethnic minority in- surgent bands, the Mons, Kayahs and Moslem Mujahids, have remained too small to be of much significance. 5. The government of Burma, currently under the domination of General Ne Win and the army, is intolerant of opposition and is expected to demand discipline and effi- ciency. Despite this, it is probably con- siderably less stable than were the previous civilian administrations of U Nu. It is also reportedly divided on policy. Thus, its sta- bility depends largely upon the continued unity and loyalty of the army to General Ne Win. The orientation of the government is essentially one of narrow nationalism, sus- picious and fearful of foreign intervention. Its program is one of developing a purely Burmese, and largely undefined socialist state.

The government's program for dealing with its current and potential insurgents has been a combination of long-range educa- tion and reorientation of the ethnic minori- ties toward a Burman cultural pattern and an extended war of attrition against the exist- ing insurgent forces. While the government should be able to contain the insurgents militarily, over the coming months the proba- bility is that the insurgency will continue at its present costly but not dangerous level. 7. The principal, danger is that the govern- ment's policy toward the minorities will be so heavy-handed as to increase rather than reduce disaffection. US ability to influence this situation is not great. The Burmese are suspicious of Western advice, and are particularly sensitive in the case of the US, which because of its previous involve- ment with the Chinese Nationalist irregulars in Northern Burma, is suspected of favoring minorities against the Burmese government. Hence US counsels of moderation run the risk of being counter-productive. CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80B01676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80B01676R000600090002-7 SECRET SUBJECT: Insurgency in Cambodia 1. Cambodia has no serious internal se- curity problem at the present time. Prince Sihanouk enjoys broad popular support, and he has identified himself closely with the people's interest. His all-inclusive Sangkum political movement has absorbed potentially dissident elements and he has suppressed any semblance of an effective political opposi- tion. The local Pracheachon (Communist) party is small in number (1,000?3,000) and influence. External Communist subversion is minimal due to the bloc's tactics of avoiding offense to Sihanouk. The Chinese and Vietnamese minorities, although oriented toward the left, are mainly interested in maintaining their preeminent commercial po- sitions. 2. Sihanouk has been the dominant figure in Cambodian politics since 1941. The 30,000? man national army is loyal to the government and is not active in politics. The peasants, for the most part, own the land they till, and food is abundant. The younger intellec- tuals in Phnom Penh make up the one group of malcontents. They were educated in France after World War II and received considerable aid and political guidance from French Commu- nists. Sihanouk is aware of their attitudes but has done little to satisfy their demands for reform. 3. Sihanouk has stated that Communism is \"the wave of the future\" in Southeast Asia. He does not hesitate to look to Communist China for diplomatic support and he threatens to seek military aid from that quarter when- ever relations with Thailand, South Vietnam, and the United States become seriously strained. However, he has taken steps to suppress Com- munism within Cambodia, and he is increasingly concerned with the growing Communist presence in neighboring countries. He fears the crea- tion of a united Vietnam under Communist rule and is concerned over the future direction of Laotian neutrality.

Cambodia has had an effective civic action program for several years. The Cam- bodian army has been active in construction projects, village health, provincial admin- istration and settlement particularly in the northeast, a region Sihanouk recognizes as a likely center of disaffection and subver- sion. He has received indications of US sup- port for three additional infantry battalions and one engineer battalion to protect this border, aid the local minorities, and en- courage \"homesteading\" by Cambodian refugees from South Vietnam. The armed forces and the para-military Provincial Guard (11,000 strong) are capable of assuring internal se- curity. Cambodian forces, however, have not been very effective, or very diligent, in patrolling border areas against Viet Cong infringements. 5. Recurring rumors that Bangkok and Saigon are plotting against Sihanouk jeop- ardize the standing of the United States in Cambodia.. Sihanouk takes the view that Wash- ington condones such plotting. 6. The internal situation is likely to remain stable under Sihanouk's leadership. He has not provided for a successor, however, and should he die a period of political in- stability might follow until senior advisers and the royal family could agree upon a leader. During this period leftist elements might create unrest. If Sihanouk's death were to occur by assassination, and South Vietnam or Thailand appeared involved, Cambodia would react sharply against the United States.

For a decade the Pathet Lao has been exerting military and political pressure upon the constituted government. The Pathet Lao insurgents now exercise de facto control over almost half of Laos, ancU_P_athet Lao representatives hold key positions in the recently formed coalition government. 2. The Pathet Lao is an arm of the North Vietnamese Communist apparatus. Its impetus and backing come from Hanoi. While the move- ment is headed by Laotians, the key leaders --Nouhak, Kaysone and Souphannouvong.-all received their indoctrination under Ho Chi Minh, and returned to Laos at the time of the Indochina War. Nouhak and Kaysone are completely responsive to Hanoi. Pathet Lao operations over the years reflect Hanoi's programs and policies which are designed to bring the former Indochina states under North Vietnamese hegemony. 3. The Pathet Lao draws much of its sup- port from non-Lao ethnic minorities. Consti- tuting almost half the Laotian population, these groups have for centuries been treated as inferiors, and have been isolated from the Lao of the Mekong River valley. 4. In recent years, students returning from France have been increasingly attracted toward the movement, no doubt in reaction to the conservatism and corruption of the Vientiane government and in sympathy with the \"anti-colonialist struggle\" in neighbor- ing Vietnam. 5. The Pathet Lao has developed signifi- cant support in the areas which it has con- trolled. Its \"grass-roots\" appeal was strongly evidenced when candidates of its political arm, the Neo Lao Hak Sat, made a strong show- ing in the 1958 elections. Other factors, such as the existence of protected base areas contiguous, to North Vietnam, major re-supply routes from North Vietnam, airlift support, SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80B01676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 SECRET and the augmentation of the Pathet Lao mili- tary capability by North Vietnamese technical and military personnel, have played an impor- tant role in past Pathet Lao operations and presumably would in the future should the Pathet Lao assume a more militant posture. 6. The Pathet Lao, as an integral part of the coalition government, will henceforth play an increasingly influential role in the direction and implementation of government policies and programs. At the same time, the Pathet Lao will probably receive covert support from North Vietnam and other Commu- nist powers for the enlargement of their in- fluence and control over the Laotian country- side. 7. The United States, which has played a major role in Laotian affairs during the past few years, will retain a major interest in Laos in view of the impact Laotian \"neu- trality\" will have throughout Southeast Asia. While Souvanna will welcome US aid programs, it is likely that--in consonance with his policy of strict neutrality--he will restrict any activities which might be construed as an attempt to exert political influence. 8. The future course of events will be greatly influenced by the attitude of the Souvanna administration. As members of the coalition, the Pathet Lao will try to change Souvanna's neutralism into a pro-Bloc policy, rather than resorting to a renewal of mili- tary action. However, if they are unable to accomplish this by political means, the chances of renewed military or paramilitary activity by the Pathet Lao would be signifi- cantly increased.

The principal internal threat to South Vietnam is the Communist (Viet Cong) military and political drive to overthrow the Diem government. The core of this move- ment is the Viet Minh apparatus left in South Vietnam after the country was divided by the 1954 Geneva settlement, but overall direction is from Hanoi. The failure to hold reunifi- cation elections as provided in the 1954 Geneva accords has led Hanoi to step up its support of armed insurrection in the South, with the aim of replacing Diem by a govern- ment willing to negotiate unification on Hanoi's terms. 2. Hanoi has infiltrated military cadres and some materiel, but the bulk of Viet Cong strength is made up of local peasants, re- cruited voluntarily or by force. Viet Cong strength has increased from an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 guerrillas in mid-1960 to a present level of 17,000 to 19,000 in regular units, plus up to 100,000 part-time military supporters. The Communists hold several \"base\" areas from which government authority is virtually excluded; they partially control or influence perhaps half of the villages in South Vietnam and have cells in major cities. They are influential among minority tribes in the highlands where government control has never been firm and among some remnants of the political-military sects, whose dissi- dent armies were crushed by Diem shortly after South Vietnam's independence. 3. President Diem is staunchly anti-Com- munist and top leaders share his determina- tion to resist a Communist takeover. While individual Vietnamese are strongly pro-Ameri- can or even pro-French, the government is nationalistic and feels little kinship with democratic practices. A vocal intellectual group has scored Diem's autocratic and highly centralized rule, and even government offi- cials have voiced concern that interference in military command and inadequate administra- tion have contributed to growing Viet Cong -8- SECRET Annroved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 SECRET success. Suppression of political opposition and curbs on civil liberties have led to wide- spread apathy, and have forced the more active opposition elements into irresponsible and con- spiratorial activity. Coup or assassination attempts have occurred in the past and pose a constant danger. The Diem government's widespread counterinsurgency effort, both military and socio-economic, is being assisted by US financial and logistic support and US military personnel. US prestige is heavily committed to South Vietnam's effort. 4. Although South Vietnamese army opera- tions have stepped up pressure on the Viet Cong and destroyed many Communist installa- tions and food stocks, Communist military capability does not appear so far to have been seriously weakened. Recent Viet Cong attacks show increased military professional- ism, and there is evidence that the Commu- nists are continuing to build up regular units. The largest units now identified are battalions, but regimental formations may eventually appear. There is evidence sug- gesting that North Vietnam has decided to in- crease its support of such a build-up in re- sponse to larger US aid to South Vietnam. The most suitable area for a build-up is in the northern part of the country where remote trails provide access directly from the North and from across Laos, and where the mountain- ous terrain is less advantageous for use of the government's superior equipment. The Viet Cong probably will continue smaller- scale erosive attacks in coastal provinces and the Mekong delta, attempting to capture rice supplies and weapons, as well as to sever road and rail communications and to interdict government aircraft, possibly em- ploying ground sabotage and antiaircraft weapons. The Viet Cong at any time may in- tensify its efforts to destroy the govern- ment's \"strategic hamlets\" and other rural projects which seek to isolate the peasantry from the Communists, and may increase terror- ism in the cities both for psychological and economic effect.

A constant possibility in South Vietnam is the assassination or overthrow of President Diem by non-Communist opponents or by such groups in cooperation with the Viet Cong. Diem's death probably would lead to some form of military rule, possibly through a civilian facade. To be successful, a coup probably requires military backing. There is,however, no apparent popular or strong alternative leader to Diem on the horizon; Diem's removal might result in an early internal struggle for power or a rapid deterioration of govern- mental stability. Such a situation would pre- sent the Communists ready-made opportunities for military or political exploitation. SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT: Insurgency in Thailand 1. There is at present no insurgency as such in Thailand. There are, however, two principal areas of discontent where active insurgency could develop. These areas are the northeastern provinces of Thailand bor- dering on the Mekong River and Laos, and the southern provinces along the Malayan border. In the northeast, where the residents con- sider themselves Thai but are closely related to the Lao, the cause for discontent is the poverty and undeveloped economy. In the south, it is ethnic and religious differences: the people are Malay Moslems who resist gov- ernmental efforts to assimilate them linguis- tically and religiously. 2. In both areas there is a built-in alien Communist minority--in the northeast the Viet- namese refugee communities, estimated at about 45,000 and currently in the slow process of repatriation to North Vietnam, and in the south, a handful of Malayan Communist Party insurgents who use the Thai-Malay border area as a refuge from Malayan security forces. Ethnic minorities of the hill country of north- ern Thailand could become dissaffected through Thai efforts to modernize their forms of liv- ing. By themselves, however, they are too few and too weak to cause much concern at this time. 3. Bangkok has long recognized its diffi- culties in the south and has handled the prob- lem by permitting a great deal of autonomy to the Moslem minority. Furthermore, the Malayan government has persistently discouraged anti- Bangkok action on its side of the border. 4. In contrast, Bangkok took steps to al- leviate the long-standing discontent of the northeastern Thais only recently when the spread of Communist influence in Laos became significant. Bangkok's neglect, combined with inter-marriage and easier communications with the Mekong peoples, has created close identification with Laos and isolation from CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 CONFIDENTIAL the capital. As a result, the local peoples are relatively easy targets for Laotian-based Communist propaganda and subversion. The government's present program of dealing with the discontent in the northeast consists of a three-pronged approach: increased super- vision of the Laotian border, increased police surveillance of known and suspected Communists, and a newly launched (and United States sup- ported) program of economic development for the area. For the short range and depending on developments in Laos, the Thai government should be able to contain its discontented elements and, perhaps, decrease their com- plaints. 5. The present Thai government is basi- cally stable and faces no organized internal opposition. So long as Marshal Sarit's health remains adequate, there is little likelihood of a significant domestic change. The Thai government has been a close partner to the United States since SEATO was founded in 1954. The United States has staked much money and prestige on military and economic development, and Thailand has been quite amenable to United States influence. Re- cently, however, and especially since the extension of Communist influence in Laos, Thailand has become increasingly irritated by US policy and it is probable that, while both countries will continue their efforts to contain Communist expansion, relations between them will become increasingly diffi- cult.

Cameroon's moderate regime is plagued with an armed rebellion which has been in progress in the southwestern region of the country since 1956. It began as an effort by the Cameroon People's Union (UPC), then the largest nationalist party in the French trust territory of Cameroun, to win independence and reunification with the adjoining British- administered segment of the old German colony of Kamerun. When French Cameroun achieved independence under the moderate French-sup- ported Cameroon union party (UC) in January 1960,; many UPC adherents abandoned terrorism and returned to legal political activity. The rebellion's political appeal declined further last fall with the reunification of former French Cameroun and British Southern Cameroons. However, a small faction of UPC irreconcilables, who regard President Ahmadou Ahidjo as a puppet controlled by Western \"imperialists\", has continued in active insurrection, exploiting widespread unrest among youthful elements of the important Bamileke tribe. 2. The bases of this tribal unrest--and thus of the rebellion today--are largely economic and social rather than political. They are overpopulation, a rigid social structure in which the chiefs remain powerful, and, especially, a traditional land tenure system which fails to provide profitable employment for thousands of young Bamileke reaching maturity each year. Unable to find work in their own tribal area and un- wanted in others, many of these young men drift into the largely autonomous small ter- rorist bands which comprise the UPC's rebel \"National Liberation Army.\" 3. Although insurgency has been on the wane in Cameroon for the past two years, Cameroonian authorities estimate that there are still about 2,100 active terrorists based in inaccessible areas of the dense rainforests and rugged mountains of the SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80B01676R000600090002-7 SECRET southwest. They are largely armed with home- made guns and crude ammunition, but have oc- casionally received limited amounts of more professional material, including some weapons of Czech origin, via a pipeline controlled by UPC leaders operating out of Cairo, Conakry, and Accra. A small number of the terrorists have been trained in guerrilla warfare tech- niques in Communist China. Supplying arms clandestinely to the rebels has always pre- sented a major logistics problem to foreign sympathizers and has recently become even more difficult as a result of Cameroonian pressure on Nigeria to control its borders more effectively. Moreover, Nasir, Nkrumah, and Sekou Toure all have been curbing their overt support for the rebellion in recent months and at least the UAR appears to have reduced its covert assistance as well. 4. All of the rebellion's top external leaders and a few of those operating within Cameroon are strongly pro-Communist. This orientation results from the UPC's many years of close association with the French Communist apparatus, which provided important organizational and financial support. 5. At present Ahidjo and his party, the Cameroon Union (UC), appear to be firmly in the saddle at the federal level and in Eastern (former French) Cameroon. While the regime is still based essentially on the support of the traditional Moslem rulers of the northern region, Ahidjo has won over many individual tribal leaders of the more politically volatile Christian-pagan south. The legal opposition is badly fragmented and its political vehicles appear to be crumbling under increasing regime pressure. However, the government still lacks real broad-based popular support and little has been done to transform the UC into the spearhead of a genuine mass movement. Heavy dependence on France for economic and tech- nical assistance continues to alienate many students and other politically dynamic elements. The government has yet to develop a meaningful program attacking the basic causes of the ter- rorist problem. -14- SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 SECRET 6. Cameroonian security forces, totaling about 7,800 men, evidently are completely loyal to the present government. They are, however, heavily dependent upon a large French military mission which provides officers and non-corns for key positions in the Cameroonian forces in addition to training and technical addistance. There are also two French infantry battalions based in the country. The French commander of the Cameroonian Army believes his troops would be very hard pressed should the terrorists acquire any significant quantity of arms. 7. The Ahidjo regime's present close ties with France narrow the potential for exerting US influence. Moreover, the government was disappointed in the US response to its initial bids in 1960 and 1961 for economic, military, and diplomatic support. Nevertheless, rela- tions now are generally cordial and Ahidjo would still like to offset the French presence with an increased US aid commitment. US na- tional interests revolve around the desirability of promoting stability in the area under an essentially Western-oriented regime. 8. Assuming that the terrorists do not acquire substantial new arms supplies, it seems unlikely that they will be able to step up their operations over the next few months. On the other hand, terrorism has probably reached an irreducible level until the govern- ment deals effectively with its basic causes. SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80B01676R000600090002-7 SECRET SUBJECT: Insurgency in 'Iran 1. The main threat to stability in Iran lies in the antiquated and reactionary nature of its social, political and economic structure and the inability of successive governments to achieve significant reforms. The bureaucracy is top-heavy and corrupt; the entrenched ruling class is devoted primarily to pursuing its own interests; the military officer corps is inef- ficient and faction-ridden; and the nationalist opposition works persistently to embarrass the government. All of this contributes to the progressive deterioration of the monarchy as a unifying force in the country and increases the long-range chances of a violent upheaval. 2. However, active insurgency'is unlikely in Iran in the near future. The nationalist opposition is small, poorly organized, and largely ineffective. The masses of peasants are lethargic and without an effective voice. Articulate expression of dissatisfaction comes only from a relatively small group of educated, politically aware Iranians; University of Tehran students spearhead most violent expressions of dissatisfaction. Urban workers, primarily in Tehran and to a degree in Isfahan and Abadan, can, under certain circumstances, be moved to violence, and are natural targets for anyone wishing to whip up expressions of mass support. Demonstrators and organizers can also be bought if a genuine issue is lacking. Tribal groups, which historically have sparked uprisings, have declined in influence and power, as the Tehran government has extended its control into the remoter areas, but the tribes, especially the Kurds, could still be a source of trouble if they received large-scale outside support or if tribal uprisings concided with disturbances in the cities. 3. Although Iran has many ex-Communists and Communist sympathizers, some of them in government offices, Communist forces do not now appear capable of action against the govern- ment. The leadership and the best-organized elements of the party are outside Iran, mainly in Europe. During a period of chaos, however, Communist capabilities would probably increase rapidly. -16- SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80B01676R000600090002-7 SECRET 4. The present government of Asadollah Alam is only a few days old. It appears, however, that it will be no better, and perhaps somewhat worse, than the governments which held power from 1953 until last year, when Amini took over. In all these the Shah pulled the strings and the prime minister acted as his mouthpiece. Little progress was made in meeting the rising expectations and demands for economic improvement, social reform and more representative government. Although Alath's government has announced that it intends to carry on the program of land reform, anti-corruption measures and other activities set afoot by Amini, it seems unlikely that it will do so effectively unless the Shah dem- onstrates a greater willingness to oppose the entrenched interests than has so far been the case. 5. Government forces, police, gendarmerie, military and civilian security, have the capa- bility of controlling any foreseeable disturb- ances short of a country-wide armed uprising. If ordered to fire on rioting civilian crowds, the army's reliability might be questionable. Indeed, any excessive violence against demon- strators could snowball into widespread disturb- ances in the Tehran area, but organized or prolonged fighting would be unlikely. 6. The Iranian government is Western oriented and linked with the United States through CENTO and a bilateral defense pact. It depends on American military and economic aid and accepts and sometimes seeks American advice and guidance. The Iranian government has supported American 25X1 policy on most international issues and has SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80B01676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 SECRET SUBJECT: Insurgency Threat in Colombia 1. Armed bands have terrorized rural areas of central and western Colombia since 1948 and continue to cause more than 200 deaths each month. An estimated 75 groups of varying size are active, some of them remnants of former guerrilla bands that participated in Liberal-Conservative hostil- ities from 1948 to 1953, but most of them are simply bandits without political affil- iation. 2. The existence of most of these groups is due largely to the absence of adequate police forces in the remote areas where the bandits operate. The bands form the private \"armies\" of local bosses who exert political control over the small communities from which they derive their support. Although there has been some evidence of Communist attempts to coordinate the bandits into a unified revolutionary movement, most of the bands operate independently. Communist in- fluence has been confined to several small enclaves which the Communists have controlled for more than 20 years. Even in these re- doubts Communist influence is declining. 3. In early 1962, a group of leftist ex- tremists formed an organization known as the United Front for Revolutionary Action (FUAR). It is engaged in a campaign to form a guer- rilla movement aimed at the overthrow of the government. Leaders of the organization have had contact with the Castro regime and have probably received financial aid from Cuba on a regular basis. The FUAR has succeeded in drawing members from the extremist wing of the Colombian Communist Party (PCC) who are dissatisfied with the PCC's reluctance to engage in armed revolution. An increasing number of Communist university students is joining FUAR. 4. Colombia is enjoying a period of political stability. The National Front coalition, under which the presidency is SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 SECRET ' to alternate between the Conservative and Liberal parties every four years with all appointive and elective offices divided on a parity basis, was strengthened in the re- cent congressional and presidential elections. 5. Colombia has enthusiastically endorsed the Alliance for Progress, and has made con- siderable progress in restoring representa- tive government since the overthrow of dic- tator Rojas Pinilla in 1957. Prospects for stability will depend to a large extent on the incoming administration's success in executing the \"General Plan for Economic and Social Development.\" The plan is con- sidered a sound and potentially effective socio-political reform. Declining world coffee prices threatenL:to disrupt Colombia's coffee-based economy, but steps are being taken to diversify exports. 6. The only security force in many rural areas is the local army garrison, but it gen- erally is inadequate and lacks the proper training to combat armed bands. Moreover, the army does not consider'the suppression of banditry to be its mission. 7. Unless and until the army decides to eliminate rural violence, the bandit groups will continue to dominate much of rural Colombia. Although no large-scale insurgency is likely to develop in the immediate future, the Communists and FUAR are expected to step up subversive activities. Leftist agitation, particularly among student groups, will prob- ably increase.

President Arosemena's administration continues to be threatened by both the left and right. There is general dissatisfaction among conservative groups with the govern- ment's inability to quell the growing unrest resulting from leftist agitation. Military leaders are concerned that government poli- cies and reform programs may result in politi- cal gains by the left. 2. The Communist Party of Ecuador (PCE) has succeeded in forming the nucleus of a guerrilla organization. Members of the guer- rilla group were drawn largely from the pro- Castro Revolutionary Union of Ecuadorean Youth, which was involved in a two-day battle with government forces last April. The Com- munists have stepped up guerrilla warfare training, including special courses in the use of explosives. PCE members are report- edly stockpiling arms in rural areas in prep- aration for a general insurrection. There is some evidence of Cuban arms assistance, and several PCE members have received train- ing in Cuba. 3. While the threat of a military coup has abated somewhat, the political situation in Ecuador remains unstable. President Arose- mena is attempting to effect a reform program, but he faces resistance from rightists in Congress who may be able to muster independent support and to block his proposals. Those whom the reforms would benefit are dissatis- fied with the lack of progress. Widespread strikes and Communist-inspired demonstrations have added to the tension. 4. The administration supports the Al- liance for Progress, but any indications of external attempts to influence Ecuador's policies are likely to arouse the country's extreme sensitivity to apparent encroach- ments on its sovereignty. Arosemena is struggling to follow an independent line in international politics.

Government security forces successfully suppressed the only recent leftist outbreak and arrested those involved. However, the National Civil Police (NCP), responsible for internal se- curity matters, lack the capability to deal ef- fectively with widespread insurgency. Coopera- tion between the NCP and the military is vir- tually nonexistent. 6. There is no immediate threat to Ecuador's internal security. However, the Arosemena ad- ministration will face continued leftist efforts to discredit the government through agitation and possibly violent demonstrations. Rightists may attempt to impeach Arosemena. There is also the possibility that the military will become convinced that a takeover by the armed forces is necessary to restore order.

The Communists' Guatemalan Labor Party (PGT) has favored a policy of \"active insur- rection\" for about a year, but PGT leaders have recognized that the party is too weak to take decisive action by itself and that it must therefore secure the collaboration of other revolutionary groups. 2. The PGT has a hardcore membership of about 1,100 (in a total population of nearly 4,000,000) and is able to control perhaps another 1,000 among the members of the Com- munist-front United Revolutionary party (PUR), Communist-dominated labor unions, and various student organizations. It also has connec- tions with the \"13 November\" group, a small group of ex-army personnel which has engaged in sporadic guerrilla activity since early this year. It has succeeded only partially in influencing and directing this group. 3. The \"13 November\" group, led by Major Marco Antonio Yon Sosa, engaged in guerrilla activity in Guatemala's northeast region dur- ing February. In March and April, Cuba sent the group at least $10,000 through contacts in Mexico. Presently inactive, it probably had no more than 50 members at the height of its guerrilla activity. 4. When the Communists attempted to launch their own guerrilla movement, under the leader- ship of pro-Communist former Guatemalan army colonel Carlos Paz Tejada, the attempt was a fiasco. The 15- to 18-man band was routed quickly by the Guatemalan army. 5. Though opposition groups presently lack unity and strength, their importance is potentially great because of the widespread, though still unchanneled, public dissatisfac- tion with the regime. The government lacks any well-defined political orientation, and its position is weakened by the corruption and maladministration that has discredited it publicly and led the more able Guatemalan SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 SECRET civilians to shun any association with it. It appears incapable of a significant attempt to fulfill the aspirations for social and economic progress which animate many Guatemalans. Eco- nomic stagnation since 1957, resulting largely from the lower world prices for coffee, the chief Guatemalan export, turned into recession in 1961, when per capita real income declined an estimated 3.5 percent. 6. The armed forces are the ultimate locus of political power in Guatemala. While they are presently supporting the regime, they are responsive to public opinion and would probably remove Ydigoras' if public pressure against him assumes major proportions. 7. The 7,000-man army showed up poorly in action against the \"13 November\" group last February. It is widely deployed throughout the country and lacks an effective intelligence capability. Police forces consist of about 3,000 non-administrative officers and men in the National Police and about 800 in the border patrol force. While these forces are not badly trained and are improving, they are deficient in riot control methods and, outside the capi- tal, are thinly distributed. 8. Events in Guatemala are important to US interests since developments there have often in the past had significant ramifications in neighboring countries. Also, the US is widely held responsible for the revolution of 1954 which ousted the pro-Communist regime of Presi- dent Arbenz. Arbenz now resides in Cuba, and the Castro regime evidently considers the Guate- malan government one of its primary targets for subversion in Latin America. 9. Any new incident, such as the death of a student at the hands of the police, could quickly arouse the public against the regime to such an extent that the armed forces would feel obliged to seize control. A military coup would be explained as necessary to restore order and \"prevent a Communist takeover.\" SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 SECRET SUBJECT: Insurgency Threat in'Venezuela 1. The guerrilla movement in Venezuela has a substantial potential in terms of organ- ization, equipment and finance. Numerous en- counters between guerrilla and Venezuelan se- curity forces have occurred in recent months, resulting in several deaths on both sides and the capture of more than 100 insurgents. How- ever, peasant support is essential to the suc- cess of any insurrectionary movement, and at present President Betancourt enjoys the sup- port of the peasants. 2. It has been clearly established that the Venezuelan Communist Party (PCV) with the aid of its ally, the Movement of the Revolu- tionary Left (MIR), is directing the guerrilla movement. Aware that President Betancourt's downfall would remove one of Castroism's lead- ing enemies and encourage future revolutionary activities in the Hemisphere, the Communists are determined to overthrow the Venezuelan government. 3. The Communists appear to be concentrat- ing on the procurement of arms and the forma- tion of a well-trained cadre before undertaking any major effort to gain mass support for wide- spread armed action. While conditions in rural areas are not suitable for insurgent ac- tivities the economically depressed' urban areas are susceptible to Communist exploitation. Aside from the PCV paramilitary group of some 200 men, the Communists rely largely on students for recruits, primarily from the Central Uni- versity in Caracas. 4. The guerrilla effort is believed to be part of the Communist strategy to create un- rest throughout Venezuela by the use of terror, sabotage, and armed action. The ultimate ob- jective is to seize power either directly or by provoking a military coup and subsequently exploiting mass resentment to oust the mili- tary. SECRET Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 Approved For Release 2006/07/20: CIA-RDP80BO1676R000600090002-7 SECRET 5. Venezuela's political situation has re- mained unstable since the abortive revolts by leftist marine units in May and June. The military continues to press Betancourt for firm measures to halt the growing terrorism, much of which is aimed at military personnel. Betancourt is extremely concerned that recent action taken by the armed forces in Peru and Argentina will encourage Venezuelan military leaders to demand a greater political role. 6. The government is hampered by an oppo- sition-controlled Chamber of Deputies which refuses to approve severe restrictions against the Communists and other extremists. Dissen- sion within the government coalition over the means to be used 'in combating violence further aggravates the situation. 7. Government security forces appear capa- ble of preventing the present insurgency from becoming a serious threat to the survival of the government. The National Guard is particu- larly effective in suppressing violence in rural areas. While a small number of leftist and rightist extremists in the armed forces continue to plot Betancourt's overthrow, the majority of the officers are believed to be loyal. 8. Much depends on the continued support of the rural population. Relations between the peasants and the military are good, and the peasants: will probably continue to coop- erate against the guerrillas as long as Betan- court remains in office. The government con- tinues to effect its moderately successful land reform program. 9. The present Venezuelan government is strongly anti-Communist and is prepared to cooperate with the US to forestall the spread of Castroism in the Hemisphere. However, Betancourt is sensitive to criticism that he is overly influenced by US policy, and be will be careful to avoid any position that indicates compromise with Venezuela's independence.

Venezuela's value to US policy derives primarily from its position as probably the most staunchly anti-Communist country in Latin America, and from its bitterly anti-Castro at- titude. The country's position as the world's leading exporter of crude oil is also signifi- cant. 11. The political situation in Venezuela will probably become more unstable as the country approaches a presidential election in 1963. Communist efforts to exploit the situation by fomenting popular unrest and provoking disturbances are likely to increase. Incidents of sabotage, terrorism, and armed violence will become more frequent as the Com- munists and other leftist extremists increase their paramilitary capability. However, sus- tained guerrilla warfare on a national scale is not likely to break out in the immediate future.
