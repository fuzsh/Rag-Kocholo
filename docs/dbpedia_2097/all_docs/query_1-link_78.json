        "text": "Israel\n\nThe U.S. will soon begin shipping to Israel the 500-pound bombs that the Biden administration had previously suspended, ending a two-month pause it had imposed in a bid to reduce civilian casualties in Gaza, U.S. officials said. – Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Israeli military issued a sweeping call for residents of Gaza City to leave the area after days of punishing airstrikes across the enclave, moves that indicate Israel’s high-intensity campaign against Hamas isn’t over even as the risk of full-scale war with Hezbollah militants grows on its northern border with Lebanon. – Wall Street Journal\n\nA backlog of 1,150 truckloads of humanitarian aid is waiting to be collected from the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing in the southern Gaza Strip, Israel said on Wednesday, prompting the United Nations to say: “We’re doing what we can.” – Reuters\n\nThe United States was “cautiously optimistic” about Gaza ceasefire talks, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told CNN on Wednesday, adding that gaps between the two sides could be narrowed. – Reuters\n\nIsrael and the United States agree on the importance of seizing the opportunity for a Gaza ceasefire deal but challenges remain, Israel’s Defence Ministry said on Wednesday after its minister, Yoav Gallant, met U.S. Middle East envoy Brett McGurk. – Reuters\n\nIsraeli tanks and artillery on Wednesday struck Syrian army targets that had violated the 1974 demilitarisation deal in the area of the Golan Heights, the Israeli military said. – Reuters\n\nThe window for US President Joe Biden’s administration to broker a long-sought normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia before the November presidential election has closed, a Democratic lawmaker and a senior Republican Senate aide told The Times of Israel on Wednesday. – Times of Israel\n\nIsrael has been advised that establishing a state commission of inquiry into alleged war crimes committed by the military during the ongoing war against terror group Hamas in Gaza would help prevent the International Criminal Court from issuing arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, Kan news reported Wednesday. – Times of Israel\n\nTerrorists threw three firebombs on Wednesday evening towards the vehicle of a woman who was driving with her seven children near the community of Ateret, located in the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. – Arutz Sheva\n\nIDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi spoke on Wednesday at the graduation ceremony of the National Security College and said that a deal that would see the release of the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza “embodies the basic values required for an exemplary society and a society that values life.” – Arutz Sheva\n\nSoldiers of the Paratroopers Reconnaissance Unit encountered a terrorist cell and engaged them in close-quarters combat. During the battle, the soldiers directed a drone and identified two armed terrorists hiding among the rubble. The terrorists tried to shoot at the drone and were eliminated by tank fire. – Arutz Sheva\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant said that the majority of Hamas terrorists in Gaza have been killed or injured during the nine months of the war against Hamas. – Arutz Sheva\n\nDavid Ignatius writes: The Gaza war has been a nightmare for all the combatants — starting with the horrific Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack through to a shattering Israeli retaliatory campaign that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. It was a searing test, too, for Biden, who tried to be Israel’s stalwart ally even as he clashed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the war’s civilian toll. “Every war must end,” as strategist Fred Iklé wrote about Vietnam. Gaza isn’t over. But as one White House official put it late Wednesday: “fingers crossed. – Washington Post\n\nIran\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz warned against the dangerous activity of Iran and China, as he held a high-level meeting on the sidelines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s summit in Washington. – Jerusalem Post\n\nEditorial: News reports have said the U.S. opposed the IAEA’s censure before finally going along with the Europeans. The White House has also failed to help the public understand Iran’s role as the head of the terrorist hydra of proxy militias behind the war in Gaza, Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, and attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq, Syria and Jordan – Wall Street Journal\n\nEditorial: Considering that Avril Haines, the US Director of National Intelligence, said on Monday that in recent weeks “Iranian government actors have sought to opportunistically take advantage of ongoing protests regarding the war in Gaza, using a playbook we’ve seen other actors use over the years,” Khamenei’s words take on new meaning. Khamenei was essentially praising the fruits of his own handiwork. – Jerusalem Post\n\nHolly Dagres writes: Even if the president-elect is able to deliver on his agenda — which would happen only with the blessing of the supreme leader — he is unlikely to satisfy those Iranians who already see the Islamic Republic as irredeemable. This is especially true of Nasleh Zed, who will not easily forget the faces of those killed and brutalized by the state over the years. To them, as long as an octogenarian cleric and his allies continue to rule over their country, Iran can’t be free. – New York Times\n\nHamidreza Azizi writes: To equip their militaries to respond quickly to asymmetric naval threats in the future, European governments must increase the number of forward-deployed vessels in their fleets and improve logistical support. As Iran’s maritime forward defense takes shape, the United States and its allies need to be prepared. Iran’s strategy is designed to be nimble, allowing it to raise the stakes of regional conflict and to threaten U.S. interests in many places at once. Washington will need to draw on the full range of its diplomatic and military tools in order to deny Tehran the advantage it seeks at sea. – Foreign Affairs\n\nArash Azizi writes: Lenin once admonished that those who want obedience will get only obedient fools as followers. Khamenei never heeded that warning. Time and again, he pushed out independent-minded but impressive figures in favor of obedient fools. As he looks at the ragtag team of tinfoil-hat conspiracists and dour fundamentalists that surrounds him today, he must be somewhat embarrassed. Just five years ago, on the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, he spoke of cultivating a government dominated by “devout young revolutionaries.” By opening up the political space to technocrats and centrists, he is perhaps admitting the defeat of that dream. – The Atlantic\n\nRussia & Ukraine\n\nThe Excalibur artillery round performed wonders when it was introduced into the Ukrainian battlefield in the summer of 2022. Guided by GPS, the shells hit Russian tanks and artillery with surgical precision, as drones overhead filmed the resulting fireballs. That didn’t last.. – Wall Street Journal\n\nMore than a year after President Biden vowed to provide F-16 jet fighters to Ukraine, the first planes are being delivered, boosting Kyiv’s capability to shoot down Russian missiles and attack its ground forces. – Wall Street Journal\n\nBritain’s new Labour government will make supporting Ukraine’s war against Russia a top international priority, the country’s incoming defense chief said, as he takes on a mission to counter Kremlin adventurism and bolster British military might at a time of fiscal constraints. – Washington Post\n\nEurope has in the months since been grappling with a rapid increase in Moscow-led sabotage attacks or plots as Russia turns its focus to increasing the cost of Western support for Ukraine. – Washington Post\n\nRussia has designated the Moscow Times, a leading English-language media outlet focused on covering Russia, an “undesirable organization,” effectively banning its operations within the country and exposing anyone collaborating with it to potential criminal charges. – Washington Post\n\nThe United States and its NATO allies have agreed that Ukraine should have an “irreversible” path to membership in the alliance, enshrining the phrase in a document that was released on Wednesday during the alliance’s summit in Washington. – New York Times\n\nA lawyer for the jailed Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza said his client is in “stable” health after being moved to a Russian prison hospital last week without explanation and out of contact for six days. – New York Times\n\nUkrainian air force said Russia launched two Iskander-M ballistic missiles and six Shahed drones in an attack on Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday. – Reuters\n\nNorway will donate six F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine to help it in defense efforts against Russian air attacks, the Norwegian government said in a statement on Wednesday as NATO leaders attended a summit in Washington. – Reuters\n\nRussia said on Wednesday that its military was still working to create a “buffer zone” in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region but this would take time. – Reuters\n\nLeading figures in Russian artistic and intellectual circles have expressed shock and dismay after a theatre director and playwright were jailed for six years on charges of “justifying terrorism”. – Reuters\n\nUkraine’s top prosecutor accused Russian forces on Wednesday of killing two Ukrainian servicemen who were captured in June in the partially-occupied southeastern Zaporizhzhia region. – Reuters\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto during talks in Washington on Wednesday that any initiatives to try to put an end to Moscow’s war in Ukraine should not be based on Russian narratives. – Reuters\n\nThousands of Ukraine’s deadliest weapons were made on the top three floors of a residential high-rise in Kyiv. The space, which used to be an office for an IT company, contained workstations littered with quadcopters in various stages of assembly, accompanied by clusters of electronic components and circuit boards strewn about the desktops. – Bloomberg\n\nRussia has promised to discharge Indian nationals who were “misled” into joining its army to fight in Ukraine, India’s foreign secretary said Tuesday. – CNN\n\nAdrian Bonenberger writes: The next step in making Ukraine resilient against Russian attacks depends partly on weapons and air defense systems against missiles, and partly on getting homes and communities the energy they need before winter sets in. This could be a boon for U.S. and European manufacturers of home batteries, and of solar panel arrays made in the U.S. and in Europe. Right now, China has an iron grip on this market and is uninclined, for reasons of their own, to assist the Ukrainians. – The Hill\n\nAndrei Kolesnikov writes: In the late twentieth century, Moscow’s militarization of the economy and belief in the magical power of massive state investment helped precipitate the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thus far, Putin has avoided the same kind of fate for today’s Russia by maintaining the remnants of an open market and keeping his financial agencies in technocratic hands. But now that old-school economists are leading the military parades, it is unclear how long this economic rationalism can continue to survive. – Foreign Affairs\n\nMiddle East & North Africa\n\nMore than 80 lawyers, academics and activists in the United Arab Emirates who had been convicted in shadowy national security trials years ago, after they had called for political reforms, had expected to soon be released from prison as, one by one, their sentences expired. – New York Times\n\nMorocco plans to acquire a spy satellite from Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI) in a $1 billion deal, Moroccan media reported on Wednesday. – Reuters\n\nHeading for Turkey to the north and Iran to the east, hundreds of oil tankers snake each day from near Kurdistan’s capital Erbil, clogging the Iraqi region’s often winding and mountainous highways. The tankers are the most visible aspect of a massive operation to truck oil from the semi-autonomous region of Iraq to Iran and Turkey in murky, off-the-books transactions that have boomed since an official export pipeline closed last year. – Reuters\n\nLibya’s eastern-based parliament approved what it called an additional budget of 88 billion Libyan dinars ($18.3 billion) on Wednesday to its appointed government for the rest of the current year, the parliament spokesman said. – Reuters\n\nThe United Nations Libya mission (UNSMIL) called on Wednesday on Libyan authorities to free political activist Al-Moatassim Al-Areebi and to end arbitrary detentions. – Reuters\n\nAn Iraqi court issued a death sentence against a wife of the late Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, for working with the group and detaining Yazidi women in her home, the Iraqi judiciary said on Wednesday without naming the woman. – Reuters\n\nAn aid group that rescues migrants in the Mediterranean says one of its missions was interrupted by armed bandits who boarded the overloaded smugglers’ boat and sped away with it after the migrants threw themselves into the sea. – Associated Press\n\nRegular flights between the Syrian capital of Damascus and Saudi Arabia resumed Wednesday for the first time in more than a decade as part of a thaw in relations between the countries, Syrian state media reported. – Associated Press\n\nA suspected attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted a Liberian-flagged tanker in the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait on Wednesday, as authorities acknowledged the rebels launched their longest-range attack yet on a U.S.-flagged vessel near the Arabian Sea. – Associated Press\n\nChina\n\nAfter decades of viewing China as a distant threat, NATO on Wednesday accused Beijing of becoming “a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine,” and demanded that it halt shipments of “weapons components” and other technology critical to the rebuilding of the Russian military. – New York Times\n\nTaiwan defence ministry said on Thursday it was closely watching Chinese military movements after a surge in warplanes joined drills with China’s Shandong aircraft carrier in the Pacific. – Reuters\n\nThe NATO summit in Washington’s planned statement is full of “belligerent rhetoric” and the China-related content has provocations and lies, a spokesperson for the Chinese mission to the European Union said. – Reuters\n\nThe launch of a Hyperbola-1 rocket developed by China’s private aerospace company i-Space failed on Thursday, the official Xinhua news agency said. – Reuters\n\nChina sent a record number of warplanes across a US-drawn boundary in the Taiwan Strait — a move that comes as the new president of the archipelago mulls a trip that may include a stop in America. – Bloomberg\n\nMichael Schuman writes: So far, Xi has been unwilling to temper his government’s xenophobic rhetoric or rein in his security state to avoid such geopolitical fallout. He appears to believe he can erect barriers that protect his political interests but permit the foreign capital and technology China still needs. From outside, however, China appears to be sinking into isolation and paranoia that endanger the country’s future. Xi is building walls when he should be building trust. – The Atlantic\n\nEurope\n\nNow the votes are in, and France is saddled with the most divided National Assembly in the history of its modern republic. After taking a few days to ponder this outcome, Macron broke his silence on Wednesday with a public letter that called for yet another period of national soul-searching—this time to identify principles that might guide the new lawmakers. – Wall Street Journal\n\nThe French government has put thousands of homeless immigrants on buses and sent them out of Paris ahead of the Olympics. The immigrants said they were promised housing elsewhere, only to end up living on unfamiliar streets far from home or flagged for deportation. – New York Times\n\nPoland needs to prepare its soldiers for all-out conflict, its armed forces chief of staff said on Wednesday, as the country boosts the number of troops on its border with Russia and Belarus. – Reuters\n\nThe European Commission on Wednesday said it welcomed the one year extension roaming between the European Union and Ukraine has been extended for another year – Reuters\n\nBritain’s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, on Wednesday hailed the special relationship between the UK and U.S. at his first one-on-one meeting with President Joe Biden, where the two also celebrated England’s soccer win in the semi-finals of Euro 2024. – Reuters\n\nThe pending NATO summit statement in Washington will include an intention to bolster air defences along the eastern flank of the alliance, Romania’s president said on Wednesday. – Reuters\n\nThe passage of trucks over the border into Poland from Belarus has been slowed by new sanctions, a Polish customs spokesperson said on Wednesday, after Minsk said Warsaw had stopped allowing lorries to cross. – Reuters\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday he will wait for the country’s political parties to build a “Republican” majority at the National Assembly before he can decide on a new prime minister, after no party won a majority in Sunday’s legislative elections. – Associated Press\n\nEditorial: Critics may not like it, and Mr. Farage is complaining that Britain’s system is “unfair.” But as with America’s Electoral College, first-past-the-post helps provide a majority that can govern. The reminder to the victors is that in a democracy you govern on borrowed time. The message to insurgents is that anger isn’t enough to win. Challengers need to invest the hard work and time of building broader coalitions in enough geographic areas to win seats in addition to votes. Ms. Le Pen is getting better at this, which explains her party’s steady gains, and now it’s Mr. Farage’s turn to try. – Wall Street Journal\n\nLionel Laurent writes: The longer this mess drags on, the greater the risk of lost growth, lost investment and lost faith in democracy — all good news for Le Pen, who is biding her time and who clearly remains the politician to beat in 2027 even as she faces a new campaign-finance probe. France has a huge task addressing issues like productivity, purchasing power, demographic decline and the bloated size of its state. No one person can lead France out of its crisis — and maybe, for a while, that’s no bad thing. – Bloomberg\n\nTom Rogan writes: The Polish army is designed and increasingly equipped to deliver penetrating maneuver warfare in mass and at scale. As such, it would constitute the U.S. Army’s primary ground combat partner in any war in Europe. At the start and at the finish, it would primarily be the Polish and U.S. armies breaking Russian lines and annihilating their formations with aggression and effect. In other words, it would be Polish and American soldiers doing the winning. – Washington Examiner\n\nMatthias Matthijs writes: Regardless of who is in the White House come January 2025, there is sure to be more, not less, transatlantic discord over trade, industrial policy, and defense. The EU faces pressure to do more on all fronts. That would have been a daunting challenge for the EU, even with France and Germany leading the charge. But with Paris and Berlin now locked in major domestic battles, it will be an even steeper hill to climb. – Foreign Affairs\n\nIlan Berman writes: The second problem plaguing the Alliance is the trajectory of its only Middle Eastern member, Turkiye. During the decades of the Cold War, Turkiye played an indispensable role in safeguarding the bloc’s southeastern flank against Soviet encroachment. But in the post-Cold War era, shifting policies on the part of the country’s long-serving strongman, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have made Turkiye the Alliance’s most grudging member—and arguably its weakest strategic link. Today, it’s easy to forget that NATO cohesion was sorely tested by Ankara’s policies in the not-so-distant past. – American Foreign Policy Council\n\nNorth America\n\nCanada, looking to shore up its defense of the Arctic, is moving ahead to acquire up to 12 submarines and has started a formal process to meet with manufacturers, the defense ministry said on Wednesday. – Reuters\n\nMexican navy officials running the country’s biggest port are increasingly concerned about the rising flows of unregulated “dual use” chemicals used to produce synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and fentanyl, four Navy officials told Reuters. – Reuters\n\nThe Biden administration took steps on Wednesday to prevent China from circumventing American tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum by routing those imports through Mexico. – New York Times\n\nEditorial: Yet to Mr. Trudeau the Arctic might as well be the Indian Ocean. Europe slept even as Vladimir Putin rearmed and threatened Ukraine. Canada is still sleeping, and if it doesn’t meet its alliance obligations, it will have no cause to complain if the alliance wonders if the country should remain a member. – Wall Street Journal\n\nAlexander B. Gray writes: ​Canadians have fought and died alongside American servicemen and women in two world wars and throughout the Cold War and its aftermath. The bonds of friendship and strategic alignment between Ottawa and Washington run deep. Yet the current trajectory of Canadian strategic and defense priorities is forcing an abrupt rupture with both NATO and the United States. Without an urgent refocus on its multilateral and bilateral defense commitments, Ottawa risks undermining the basis of the trans-Atlantic defense partnership and U.S. homeland defense. NATO leaders have an obligation to speak out strongly in support of a change in course. – The National Interest\n\nCybersecurity\n\nGermany will remove Chinese components from the country’s 5G mobile networks by the end of 2029, ending years of debate that had left the country dragging far behind allies in addressing what the U.S. has warned was a key vulnerability. – Wall Street Journal\n\nSeveral Macau government websites were hacked and police have launched a criminal investigation to trace the source of the crime, Chinese state media reported late on Wednesday. – Reuters\n\nMicrosoft has clinched a 20-million-euro ($21.7 million) deal to settle an antitrust complaint about its cloud computing licensing practices, averting an EU antitrust investigation and potential hefty fine. – Reuters\n\nAustralia has instructed all of its government entities to take stock of their entire technology estates and identify any assets that could be controlled or manipulated by foreign states. – The Record\n\nChina’s national cybersecurity agency was accused on Wednesday of misrepresenting research from Western cybersecurity companies in an ongoing attempt to deny allegations that a Being-backed hacking group is behind attacks targeting critical infrastructure in the West. – The Record\n\nCatherine Thorbecke writes: If Temu presents a threat to consumers or is engaged in illegal activities, lawmakers should work together to gather much stronger evidence than he has assembled. They should also focus on developing comprehensive digital privacy laws and broader oversight of supply chains. An escalating tech war with China is not the answer. – Bloomberg\n\nDefense\n\nThe United States will start deploying long-range fire capabilities in Germany in 2026 in an effort to demonstrate its commitment to NATO and European defense, the United States and Germany said in a joint statement on Wednesday. – Reuters\n\nNATO has signed a nearly $700 million contract to have member countries produce more Stinger missiles, one of many steps the alliance is pressing at its summit in Washington to get each country to boost its own weapons production capabilities. – Defense News\n\nSenate lawmakers want the Defense Innovation Unit to expand its presence across the U.S. and are calling on the Pentagon’s commercial technology hub to develop a plan to partner with universities and tech companies around the country. – Defense News\n\nThe joint, biennial exercise that ran June 7 to June 18 played out on the South Pacific island nation of Palau, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and at sea across the Navy’s Marianas Island Range Complex. This year marked its first time as a multinational exercise, and the exercise force included about 4,000 from Japan’s self-defense units. – USNI News\n\nFor the first time in more than a decade, the Marine Corps has published official doctrine on how it employs deception — a tactic used by militaries throughout history to deliberately deceive the enemy through decoys, demonstrations, ruses and manipulation of information. – Military.com"
