There has long been a need for a survey analysis of the way the Communist Party organizes for military action. There are many places where the Party is already engaged in armed rebellion. Existing world tensions and unstable internal conditions may encourage re- bellion in other areas in the near future. Non-Communist governments may have to face such action directly: it is important to know how the action is begun and directed and to know something of the problems that the Communists themselves face in raising, maintaining and controlling an armed force. 2. For these reasons the present paper has been prepared. It deals with the Commu- nist armed insurrection in advanced capitalist countries and in \"backward\", agrarian (\"colonial\") countries. A section also has been included on Communist armed resistance to foreign military occupation. This is of interest for two reasons: (a) it supplements the infor- mation on military organization for Communist insurrection; and (b) it shows what might be expected to follow should non-Communist forces be obliged to occupy a foreign country in which the Communist following is significant. 3. The conclusions developed in the survey are tentative. In many cases there is not ? sufficient information to draw reliable conclusions: for obvious reasons the Communist Party does not publish details on the techniques and organization of its military effort. In the case of city insurrections in the manner of the Russian Revolution of November 1917, they have been unsuccessful; and failures are not generally recorded in objective detail by the Commu- nists. Much more information is available on the Communist revolution in colonial countries because they have occurred at a time of general public awareness and interest in Commu- nist activities, and because, by their very nature, they cannot be kept secret. 4. Such shortcomings aside, it is believed that the present paper will enable its readers to foresee more clearly what the Communists may be expected to do by way of pre- paring and carrying out armed action. The \"pattern\" of organization and action cannot, of course, be rigidly applied in every conceivable detail and there are many places where details have been set forth to cover the actual situation in a particular country. It is hoped, however, that alternative variations have been furnished that will suggest to the reader what he may ex- pect in a given place, time, and set of conditions. There are natural limits to the variations possible at any point in the pattern. The Communists are bound by conditions beyond their control: their doctrine prescribes adherence to certain standards of organization(Parties are modelled after the CPSU); they exchange experiences and thereby develop certain \"school solutions.\" 5. Two limitations have been imposed on this interim study: (a) no attention is given to the organization of state armies in Communist countries; (b) military tactics are treated only so far as they affect organization. The study is focused on the military organizations of Parties not yet in power. 6. While this paper is primarily concerned with the efforts of the Communists to organize a military force of their own, a section is devoted to penetration and subversion of \"enemy\" armed services (i.e. the existing army, police force, etc. of the state). Penetration and subversion operations of Communist Parties, especially in the city insurrection, contri- bute directly and in a large proportion to their military potential. The organization for this activity is discussed in greater detail, paragraph 176. 7. Several \"case histories\" of particular Communist military actions are appended to the study. They should be referred to when illustrations are wanted on the application of a \"principle\" as set out in the three general analyses of -- Organization for colonial revolution, Organization for armed resistance, and, Organization for proletarian revolution.' 1 Communist military operations in conjunction with an invading Communist army have not been considered separately in this study. It is believed that in the event of invasion by the Soviet Union or its satellites, CP military action would fall into one of the categories dealt with in the paper. It would, perhaps, range from resistance type operations to isolated sei- zures of power in cities in the advanced countries. An example of such aid already exists in the colonial areas: the help of the South Korean guerrillas to the North Korean and Chinese Communist armies, which is discussed in paragraph 130. - 1 - Sanitized - Approved ForIMINMONCIA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 Sanitize - Appr 8. These three types ofIRIPArtrefitilaril.me ac itgligg7ii&MARAPPLZOW cal periods of Communist strategy. They are -- a) The period of unsuccessful city insurrections based on the BolShevik model, roughly from 1917 to 1935, with a rash of attempts immediately following the Bolshevik Revolution, Insurrections were attempted in Germany in 1921 and 1923; in Bulgaria in 1923; in Hungary in 1919; in Lativa in 1924; in Finland in 1918; in China, repeated attempts until 1928; and in Brazil, in 1935. b) The period of armed resistance to Axis occupation: in occupied Europe from 1941 to 1944; in China, from 1937 to 1945; and in Southeast ASia, from 1942 to 1945. c) The period of armed rebellion in colonial Southeast Asia and Greece. Al- though the principles employed in these revolutions had been applied as early as 1928 in China, it was not until World War II that their development had reached its height and their validity had been proved. The CP's of Indochina, Malaya, Burma, the Philippines, Indonesia and India following the war adopted them. 9. The breaking of the Communist strategy into three historical periods has largely been the result of \"objective conditions\", i.e. social-political-economic factors outside the control of the Communists, but providing them exploitable situations. The success of the Bolsheviks in 1917 was achieved by a combination of factors that is not likely to be repeated again in any other country. Nevertheless, Communists in other \"advanced\" countries have long been taught the \"lessons\" of the Bolshevik Revolution, and they include some military tactics that would appear to be applicable to a city uprising anywhere. The special conditions required for resistance operations are evident: the presence of enemy military forces and a general patriotic hatred for them. There are many similarities between military resistance and colonial insurrection. The application of the \"lessons\" of the Chinese Communist Revolu- tion in colonial countries has been the main feature of the post-war period. It cannot be said at this time that the lessons are more, or less, likely to succeed than the application of the techniques of the Bolshevik Revolution. In Greece, the attempt failed; in Malaya, Burma, Philippines and Indochina the attempts are apparently at stalemates. In Indonesia and India, they have failed. 10. It is interesting to note that CP India, having unsuccessfully tried both the tactics of the Bolshevik revolution and the tactics of the Chinese Revolution, now atteinpts to formu- late a program which calls for a combination of the two. If it succeeds (and it seems doubtful If the two types of revolution can be combined) it will be another major contribution to Commu- nist revolutionary practice. 11. The three types of Communist military effort defined. The principles for the re- sistance organization were develop during World War II, mainly to help the USSR in the war with the Axis. They had limited objectives: to harass the occupying Axis armies, to collect intelligence for Allied use and to deny the economic potential of the country t9 the Axis. The organizational structure reflected these missions. Communist resistance formations were generally small and mobile and only in rare instances did they engage Axis nlilitary formations head on. In two cases (Greece and Yugoslavia) the resistance military formations went beyond these objectives and during the resistance laid the groundwork for a later attempt to seize power. The cases examined were the Communist resistance operations of the USSR, France, Italy and Greece. The tactics developed by the Communists would be applicable by any Com- munist Party fighting a non-Communist occupation army.1 12. The techniques of the Communist revolution in colonial areas ha4e developed over the past twenty years, largely as a result of the experiences of the Chinese qommunists. The distinguishing features of the colonial revolution are: a) the creation of a large army based on the peasantry. The army is first cre- ated from isolated detachments of armed peasantry, but as the revolution succeeds the number of troops increases. 1 A current example being the utilization of Communist guerrilla forces be Korea in direct support of the North Korean forces.

The Chinese effort took over 20 years. Case histories for the preparation and conduct of a colonial revolution by the Chinese, Malayan, Philippine and Greek Communist Parties have been included in this study. The tactics appear to be applicable to all Southeast Asian countries, some areas in Latin America, the Near East and Africa. 13. The model for the city insurrection, which takes place in \"advanced\" capitalist countries, is the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. The highly centralized communications of an advanced country with strong, mobile coercive forces call for tactics very different from a resistance operation or a colonial revolution. The main features of a city insurrection are: a) the necessity to penetrate and subvert the state coercive forces, to win them over to the support of the Communists or to neutralize them during the seizure of power. b) the creation of armed detachments of workers, and obtaining the support of the proletariat for strike action and demonstrations. c) The close timing and coordination of the forces of the Communists. The in- surrection must be completed in a few days, before the opposing forces have time to rally, although the political preparation for the insurrection precedes it for years. The Bolshevik Revolution in Petrograd in 1917 was examined in detail for this study. An account of the Brazilian Communist Revolution of 1935, which bears many similarities to the Bolshevik model, is also included. Similar tactics would probably be employed by Com- munists staging an insurrection in any \"advanced, capitalist country\", particularly in Western Europe. 14. The general patterns of the colonial revolution, the resistance operation, and the city insurrection are set forth in detail below. IL COMMUNIST COLONIAL UPRISINGS A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES 15. Basis of the post-war insurrections. The numerous Communist military uprisings In the countries of Southeast Asia following the war were undertaken on the basis of several complex factors: (a) events and conditions at home and abroad which the Parties considered favorable for revolution (i.e., the \"objective situation\" in Communist parlance); (b) enhanced political strength of the Parties and the existence of at least the nucleus of a Party military force (i.e., the \"subjective\" conditions); (c) existence of a body of practical doctrine about strategy and tactics in \"colonial and semi-colonial\" countries developed during the Chinese Communist Revolution. 16. \"Objective Conditions.\" In the eyes of the Communists the war had a profound effect on the political and social stability and economies of the countries of Asia, on their relations with the \"imperialist\" homelands in Europe, and on the world balance of power be- tween the democratic \"imperialist\" countries and the Soviet-satellite \"camp.\" The Commu- nists thought that these effects worked in their favor, as was stated by Andrei Zhdanov at the Inaugural session of the Cominform in 1947, and they believed that the favorable trend would go on indefinitely, eventually leading to crises in which the Parties could seize total power. The strongest manifestation of the changed situation in Asia was the rise of nationalism, upon which the Communists had long tried to capitalize. Not until the end of the war, however, did they consider the ferment strong enough and the colonial governments (and their principles) weakened enough to capitalize fully on it. - 3 - Sanitized - Approved For RTIPMPITIA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 .L 1../1?1 J. 1%,\\J IJ. 1 A...01i MIN1991.151\" Sanitized - Approlififiliiiiihr\"--AA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 17. Party Strength. The Communist Parties participated actively in the anti-Japanese resistance during the occupation. By doing so, they developed military forces, which they were able to carry over in one form or another into the post-war period and Which provided them with the nucleus Qf an insurrectionary army. The Party leadership had gained valuable experience from underground operations during the occupation, and from the Military opera- tions. Many of the Parties also emerged from the resistance with stores of arms, ammuni- tion, and other supplies. 18. Lessons of the Chinese Communist Revolution. Out of necessity by way of his- torical accident, the Chinese Communists hit upon a formula for revolution that was radically different from the \"classic\" Bolshevik tradition and that, by extension, seems applicable to other Asian countries. Following an abortive uprising in the cities, they organized an army of peasants to protect themselves against the military forces of the Nationalists; they used the army to seize and hold an inaccessible region in the far Northwest (Shensi, Province); after consolidating their position there -- aided by the neighboring USSR?they used the army to \"politicalize\" the peasantry in adjoining areas particularly through land redistribution and, gradually, to expand their base, finally accumulating enough strength and resonrces to engage and defeat the forces of the Government and to take over complete state power. From their experiences, a formula for revolution in what the Communist call the \"colonial and semi-colonial\" countries was developed with the following termS: a) The most immediately revolutionary section of the population is not the city proletariat, but the peasantry; b) By raising a military force and seizing a safe base in the countryside, the Communist Party can begin a political-military struggle aimed principally at the enlistment of the peasantry for the armed struggle: the principal rneans of, in- ducement is the distribution of land among the poor peasants; c) The Communist Party can begin a military struggle with limited military and political resources because communications difficulties will impede counter- measures by the government;1. d) By a combination of military action and political organizing among the peas- ant masses, the Party can gradually accumulate forces large enough and suffi- ciently seasoned to engage eventually the forces of the enemy; e) Even a limited military struggle will tax the strength of the gOvernment, throw its economy out of balance and, consequently, cause frictionls to grow among the social groups supporting the government and thus lead to a crisis. 19. The Safe-base, Rough terrain, dense vegetation, and primitive roads common in \"colonial and semi-colonial\" countries of Asia make it possible for Communislt Parties to do what the Chinese Communists did when they seized part of Shensi -- capture a defensible area where the military force can be built up, trained, and sustained. Having an armed force, the Communists can relinquish an area that proves untenable and seize another. Several small bases can be taken simultaneously, later to be consolidated into one, or given up as conditions and strategy dictate. It is essential, however, that some kind of a safe area be secured. 20. Combination of Military and Political Action. The main functions of the Commu- nist military force are -- a) capture a defensible area; defend it; b) aid in the expansion of the political basis of the revolution: facilitate land distribution; protect organizers; attract or coerce peasants to support the insur- rection by show of force; 1 Conversely the existence of an effective communications system will impede the efforts of a \"colonial or semi-colonial\" CP to begin and sustain military operations. See the recent complaints of CP India to that effect.

The political apparatus of the Party is largely stripped down to provide cadres for the military force and the supporting mass organizations. It becomes a control and servicing apparatus for the military force: it posts cadres in key military commands, forms mass organizations among the peasants to provide food, intelligence, and recruits for the military force; and creates special directing organs (staffs) and servicing elements (intelligence, courier communications, weapons and ammunition production, supply, etc.). 22. \"Phasing\" of the Insurrection. Because colonial Communist Parties begin their insurrections before they have gathered preponderant political strength, and use military action as a politicalizing instrument, they expect the struggle to be long. (The Chinese Com- munists fought for over twenty years.) Military forces will be accumulated gradually; the enemy is reduced by political, economic, and military attrition. Communist military opera- tions are adjusted to tactical and political conditions prevailing at any given time. If neces- sary, the force can be withdrawn to the safe area for long periods and confine itself to de- fensive actions. Communist military tactics in colonial countries can be much more flexible than in \"advanced\" countries, where the military effort must be quick and overwhelming, or be crushed. 23. There are two main phases in the colonial insurrection: the military defensive, when the Communists are trying to accumulate forces and establish productive and military strategic safe-bases; and the military offensive when sufficient forces have been accumulated to launch the by-then developed regular army in powerful attacks on the main body of enemy forces. 24. The period of the military defensive is marked by the use of guerrilla tactics. It is divided, according to a document issued by the CP Brazil entitled \"Guerrilla, Arm of the People,\" into three phases: a) \"Acts of sabotage and terrorism, performed by individuals or small groups native to the region, who usually work under the very eyes of the enemy.\" During this phase, the Party must organize numerous small secret groups, whose duties consist of \"sabotage of transportation, communications and supplies; the collection of information for friendly troops or for the guerrilla organization; and finally, propaganda aiming at the complete revelation of the true character of the enemy and the preparation of the people for the fight.\" \"Little by little, the enemy avoids the most warlike regions, moves its troops and sup- plies over other routes, changes its depots to other places, begins to leave behind only key garrisons or send punitive expeditions from time to time. Then the guerrillas become more and more masters of the region, progressively armed and organized into military-type bands, attack the remaining enemy bands, attack the remaining enemy soldiers, and finally launch more energetic attacks on neighboring areas.\" b) \"Next, larger groups are formed which have a military organization and are generally based in mountains, forests, or other relatively inaccessible regions, whence they can launch constant attacks on the enemy.\" c) \"Finally, the groups of guerrilla warriors, now having available considerable resources, are organized into a regular army and establish a definite front and begin the occupation of the territory.\" Progress from one \"phase\" to another is not sharply defined: irregular guerrilla bands continue to exist right up to the final, all-out offensive; the forces of the Communists through- out these phases are of varying sizes and shapes; small-scale harassing operations are car- ried on even when the military force has begun to be reorganized into a \"regular army;\" the first \"phase\" is skipped over in some cases. - 5 - Sanitized - Approved For Riaitisiir1410WDP78-00915R000200110001-6 Eurcr,1NJLJ A 0 ONLY Sanitized - Approveliefferfteiteemotel4RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 The Brazilian document has this to say about centralized control of military operation: \"Coordination is relatively easy in the third phase of the fight, when the existence of the regular army and of a territory dominated by it allow the full development of a central command. In the first two phases, however, such coordination and the establishment of the central command are extremely hard: this can, never- theless, be greatly aided through the previous existence of an organized..Commu- nist Party.\" 25. The period of the military offensive consists in (a) consolidation of Party-military control within the safe-base area; (b) completion of the reorganization of the Communist forces into a \"regular army;\" (c) expansion of the safe-base in the surrounding countryside; (d) attacks in force on individual enemy strongholds, then on major provincial cities, then on the national capital; (e) creation of a national Communist government and consolidation of political and territorial control over the entire country. 26. Adjustment of the Party to \"Phasing.\" The role of the political apparatus of the Communist Party and its ancillary (\"mass\" or front) organizations is adjusted to the stages of the military strategy. In the early stages, the Party mobilizes its military elements, organizes them into tactical units, makes plans for the initial operations, and turns its regular committees into military staffs. Later, when the military forces have grown sufficiently and conditions afford an oppor- tunity for major operations, they are organized as a separate military auxiliary, divorced from the control of local Party committees, but still, however, under the control of the central Party headquarters. When this happens, the political apparatus becomes primarily a serv- icing organization for the Communist army and its operations. The civil administrations that are set up in \"liberated\" areas under Party control are also aimed at supporting the military effort. 27. In cities under enemy control, the basic function of the (underground) political apparatus of the Party is to penetrate governmental agencies, trade unions, and other social and political groups to agitate within them, subvert as many city dwellers as possible with a view to raising insurrections in the cities when the final, all-out clash is feasible. The extent to which cadres are pulled out of city organizations and sent to the field depends upon the military requirements and priorities at any given time. 28. In organizational terms, the insurrectionary colonial Communist Party must pro- vide for the creation and equipping of an armed force, coordination of the political and mili- tary programs (and organizations), and constant supervision of all organizations and opera- tions, revising plans and organizational forms in the light of \"phase\" requirements. The in- surrection is organizationally fluid and complex, maturing, in case of success, into a Party government and dictatorship. 29. The discussion which follows treats the problems faced by the insurrectionary colonial Communist Parties in organizing and carrying on their revolutions under the follow- ing headings: PROBLEMS OF THE SAFE BASE THE DECISION TO BEGIN MILITARY ACTION ADJUSTMENT OF THE PARTY APPARATUS DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMUNIST ARMY ORGANIZATION OF SUPPORT The discussion is based upon a study of Communist insurrections in China, Malaya, Philippines, and Greece, and upon partial examination of the uprisings in Indochina, Indonesia, Burma, and India. The rebellion in Greece does not fall in all details into the colonial pattern. However, it is decidely closer to the colonial formula than to the \"classic\" Bolshevik pattern of a city insurrection based on the proletariat.

PROBLEMS OF THE SAFE BASE. 30. The Party's choice of an area to capture and hold for the building up of its mili- tary force depends upon chance, balance of forces, and only partly upon calculation. A base may combine several desirable features or it may be simply the only area the insurgents are capable of taking at the time. 31. Ideally, from the Communist point of view, a safe area would have the following features: a) Political value: large population, generally susceptible to the revolutionary appeal, to be drawn en masse into the Communist army and into support activities; b) Economic productivity: food production in appreciable excess of the basic needs of the population; any manufacturing industry is desirable; it is also desir- able that the economy of areas under Government control depend upon the pro- duction of the Communist base area; c) Military defensibility with minimum effort: a matter of immediate and neigh- boring terrain and character of approaches; d) Strategic location within the country: located so as to threaten enemy econ- omy, communications lines, political resources, and military security; at the same time, give the Communist maximum advantages for expansion into surround- ing areas and cover for more distant expeditions. 32. The Communists are seldom able to take an area that combines all these features ideally. They must usually be content in the early and intermediate stages of the insurrection, with securing an area that is merely defensible and reasonable adequate in food production, hoping to improve their position later. 33. In many cases, the Communist forces have taken areas close by a foreign country to secure their rear. Preferably, of course, the area will be adjacent to a friendly state in order to facilitate outside support. Thus, the Indochinese Communists concentrated in areas adjoining neutral countries (Thailand and China), and are expected to obtain substantial assist- ance from Communist China, as soon as possible. The Greek Communists established their safe-base in YUgoslavia, Albania, and immediately adjacent Greek territories; one of the rea- sons why they gave up their attempted revolution was the defection of Tito, which left their rear exposed and deprived them of a substantial part of their logistical support. There have been recent indications that the Communist insurgents in Burma are moving to the Northeast, so as to be close to friendly China. The capture of Tibet by the Chinese Communists may eventually enable CP India to set up a safe-base there. 34. An important element in the defensibility of the base area, aside from the military strength of the enemy, is the condition of communications in the surrounding countryside. If they are primitive (as in China), the forces opposing the Communists will find it difficult to maneuver for effective attacks, and to coordinate operations of separated forces. 35. Uses of the safe base. The military usefulness of the safe base is that -- a) It provides a place where a military force can be built up and maintained -- recruited, equipped, trained, and indoctrinated; b) It provides a center for the coordination of military operations: a planning, reporting, communications, and administrative center. Schools, hospitals and convalescent facilities; storage places for all kinds of supplies; shops for the manufacture and repair of weapons and ammunition and other equipment are estab- lished in the safe area. Food is raised there on Party-controlled farms. By controlling a share of the national food supply, the Party is able to interfere with the economy and thereby disturb the political equilibrium of the state and the government's staying power. If the safe base adjoins a friendly foreign country, the Communists will have access to its productive resources and military supplies. - 7 - Sanitized - Approved For ROMILB\"FMOIDA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 6JUt(J1 LUIN nut, u. J. OHL- Sanitized - Appramaisolilassest001A-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 36. The political utility of the safe base is that -- a) It provides a center for the establishment of a \"democratic,\" people's\" or \"liberation\" government; b) It provides a jumping-off place for military-political expansion into sur- rounding areas (politicalization of the peasants). 37. The \"Liberation Government.\" The \"Government\" set up by the Communists in the safe base area,has bpth a political and a practical organizational purpose.I Politically, it serves as a rallying-point for non-Communist elements opposed to the regime for various reasons and it lends prestige and an aura of legality to the insurrection -- a distinct propa- ganda asset. There is no question but that such alucade is useful in winning favor with non- Communist, nationalist elements: it was amply demonstrated in China. Practically, the setting up of a pseudo-national government relieves the Party of a large part of the burden and the onus of civil administration in \"liberated\" areas: administrative posts can be given to non-Communists, thereby relieving Party cadres for more important work The practice of creating a \"government\" seems confined to Parties wlth substantial forces and a proven territorial base (Greece, China, Indo-china). Some insurrectionary Parties have not yet attempted it (Philippines, Malaya). 38. There are some disadvantages to the strategy of the safe-base. (1) The base is, perforce, unstrategically located in an area remote from the centers of power which must finally be seized. (2) The base is far from the centers of industrial production (arms, clothing, other equipment). (3) Its distance from population centers deprives the Communists of a large section of the potentially revolutionary population, and of the services of technicians (medicos, mechanics, communications personnel etc.). C. THE POLICY DECISION TO BEGIN MILITARY ACTION. 39. The decision to take the Party into a military revolt is serious: it means a con- siderable structural reorganization of the Party, a painful readjustment in the way of living of Party cadres p.nd ranks, and thorny problems of raising and maintaining a military force. 40. The decision is made, of course, by the top Party leadership. For example, it was made b,y the Secretariat of the CP Philippines and then endorsed by, and put out in the name of, the Political Bureau. 41. The Chinese Communists were forced into an insurrection by enemy action (pro- voked by their own action, of course). In the post-war period, however, the decision has been deliberately made on the basis of calculated prospects, and has not been forced upon the colonial Communist Parties. In some cases, the Party leadership has simply reversed its previous policy and has stayed in office to carry out the new policy (Greece, Malaya). In the Philippines a bitter factional division arose between Party leaders favoring anted insurrec- tion and those favoring continuation of \"legal\" methods, with the former finally prevailing and suppressing or expelling from the Party the advocates of \"legal\" struggle. 42. The influence of more authoritative or stronger fraternal Communist Parties may be a powerful stimulant to the decision in favor of armed uprising. Thus, the leaders of the CP Greece sounded foreign Communist leaders before beginning the insurrection of 1947-1949. The leaders of the CP Mayala canvassed Communist spokesmen of China, Great Britain, and the USSR during 1945-1946, and, receiving no encouragement, postponed their uprising until later. The Zhdanov statement to the Cominform in October 1947 (see above, para 2) was a striking example of the leadership role of the CP Soviet Union. It was elaborated at the Second Congress of the CP India and the Southeast Asia Youth Conference. The CP'S India, Burma, and Malaya,all adopted resolutions in favor of a more militant policy. In the Philippines, the faction of Party leaders favoring armed action got control of the leading Party offices in May 1948., just a few months after the Zhdanov thesis had been given general circulation.

There are indications that two decisions are actually made by the Party: the first, a preliminary decision that a \"revolutionary situation\" is developing and that the Party should prepare itself to begin fighting in the not too-distant future; and a later decision to actually begin fighting. The CP Philippines decided in May 1948 that there was a \"heightening of the revolutionary flow\" and shortly thereafter carried out some reforms in the Party organiza- tion: the decision to take to the field was not made until January 1950, when it was estimated that a \"revolutionary situation\" already existed. The CP Greece, when it accepted the Varkiza Agreement in February 1945, must have decided that a Revolutionary situation was not too far off, for it sent most of its military cadres into camps in Albania and Yugoslavia in 1945, and made a number of personnel and structural changes in the Party organization during the next two years. It gave some indication of having reached a decision to begin fighting in September 1946, but did not undertake serious military operations until the summer of 1947. 44. Content of the Policy Decision. It would be reasonable to suppose that the Party leadership would make a thorough assessment of its own capabilities and resources as part of the basis for the decision. It is surprising, then, to discover that such is not always the case. In its resolution of January 1950, for example, the CP Philippines treats the \"objective situ- ation\" in some detail, and from the document itself, it appears that the decision was made entirely on the basis of an evaluation of external conditions: the condition of the Party itself is not even mentioned. Again, the CP India, during its recent crisis, issued resolutions and discussions in which the \"situation\" is described as being \"revolutionary,\" and the task of the Party to be one of setting the masses \"on the rails\" of an armed uprising, but in which the resources of the Party are not merely glossed over as being good, but actually admitted to be at low ebb. 45. In any event, the colonial Communist Party puts more stock in the external politi- cal, economic, and social trends than it does in its immediate resources: provided the trends appear to be revolutionary, the Party will be ready to go ahead with an armed uprising on quite limited political and military resources. As is shown in the resolution of the CP Philippines of January 1950, a \"revolutionary situation\" has two main features: (a) conditions are not merely bad, but (b) will continue to get worse, because the \"bourgeoisie\" are divided and per- manently unable to unite and solve the crucial economic and social problems. With the \"situation\" already developing towards a crisis, the best the Communist Party can do is to aggravate the ills of the country by carrying on an armed struggle and to prepare itself mili- tarily and politically to stage an all-out campaign when the crisis arrives. 46. The major portion of the resolution of the CP Philippines is devoted to a discussion of the existing social, economic, and political conditions, including an estimate as to what each of the major enemy political parties will be able to do to remedy them (conclusion, negative). The last part of the resolution sets forth the \"concrete tasks\" for the Party to improve its own organization. These \"organizational, military and educational tasks\" are included in the Philippine Appendix. Briefly, they consisted of strengthening internal discipline and control, raising the level of political understanding within the Party and its armed force, improving the work of the Party among the peasants, and reforming the supporting services (finances, communications, publications). D. ADJUSTMENT OF THE PARTY APPARATUS 47. In addition to the arguments bolstering the decision to begin military action, the Party also formulates a strategy and prescribes the \"concrete tasks\" for the implementation of the decision. It takes time to get the Party in shape for a military insurrection. The military force has to be mobilized, Party cadres have to be given definite assignments, new organizations have to be created to handle problems peculiar to military operations, old offices of no use when the Party takes to the field have to be closed down or be put underground for \"stay- behind\" operations. Security measures must be put into effect in anticipation of police sup- pression. If a preliminary decision had been made, the Party would already have accom- plished some of these things, and need only wind them up after making the final decision. 48. Nevertheless, there is always a \"time lapse\" between the making of the decision and the beginning of major operations. The duration of the time lapse in each case studied was a matter of months: from January to 29 March 1950 in the Philippines; from September 1946 (?) to mid-summer 1947 in Greece; and, in Malaya, from mid-March to late July 1948. - 9 - Sanitized - Approved For RVINKAW161A-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 TELnierreempumppmgmeitair# Sanitized - Approveshisiblj-00915R000200110001-6 To some extent, the Party may be able to pick the time for beginnineits major opera- tions: the CP Philippines picked the? date of the eighth anniversary of the founding of its resistance-born army; the CP Greece seems also to have begun operations at what it consid- ered to be the most propitious time. The CP Malaya, however, with its army in \"moth-balls\" hit upon the idea of a campaign of terrorism as a means of shocking its peope into action, and is believed to have counted on having a longer preparatory period and to have been caught short when the Government took vigorous countermeasures. 49. The main changes which the Party makes in its organization immediately prior to the insurrection are: Decentralization of authority to lower (Regional or District Party) organs. This usually occurs early, in some cases (Greece and Malaya) before the making pf the final de- cision, possible as a result of a preliminary decision. In Malaya, Regionalureaus were cre- ated to direct all Party operations in prescribed areas, later, direction of operations passed progressively into the hands of lower Party committees (State Committees, then District Committees), this latter development probably resulting from increasing communications dif- ficulties. In Greece, City Committees were given greater authority, under the supervision of an \"Instructor\" from the Politburo, which had removed to the safe base. Regional Committees in the countryside were dissolved. Military operations were directed by \"area\" or \"regional\" commands in seven prescribed areas in \"liberated\" country until October 1947 when they were replaced by Division Headquarters, presumably under a more centralized diOction exercised by General Headquarters through three regional Headquarters. In the Philippines, several members of the Politburo were individually assigned to act as \"supervisors of the most important of the newly created Regional Committees. Also, the General Headquarters of the army was dissolved. Later, it was re-established when conditions made it feasible to begin the reorganization of the guerrilla army into a \"regular army.\" Reassignment of cadres from political to military work takes place. lc ?Ionial CP's are generally small numerically and short of completely reliable cadres. MFly of them had cadres with experience in guerrilla fighting during the resistance. But a Communist uprising is a different matter: it lacks the unifying and disciplining appeal of patriotic resistance and it may last a very long time. Consequently, the shortage of absolutely politically reliable cadres means that those who are available must be carefully conserved and Utilized with maxi- mum efficiency. The \"best\" cadres are sent into the field and only skeleton organization are left behind to do what they can in \"enemy\" areas and these are put deep underground. (A fre- quent complaint of the CP Philippines was that its \"stay behind\" organizations were so far underground that they were practically worthless; the same difficulty afflicted the city organi- zations of the CP Greece, which were completely paralyzed by Greek police action.) Discipline and security are greatly increased, even before the formal decision to begin military action is made. In a period when the Party is fighting for its life, it can tolerate as cadres only those individuals who are reliable and efficient. All others become a liability and while they might be allowed to hang on in a less critical period, they must be'purged in anti- cipation of military action. The decision to take to the field inevitably throws up numbers of previously satisfactory cadres who oppose the decision for one reason or another. These are disciplined by suspension or expulsion: they are rehabilitated if possible, but are always under a cloud. Purges are undertaken, in extreme cases, to rid the Party of those opposed to the de- cision to take military action. The National Control Commission, the central disciplinary organization, is strengthen- ed and control commissions are set up on local levels. In Greece, the Party 'instituted a sys- tem of \"vigilantes\" to spot indications of back-sliding and inefficiency in its cadres. Stricter qualifications for positions of leadership are instituted and readmission to the Party or to committee positions is made more difficult. All or part of the Party apparatus is placed underground. This move is made in anti- cipation of repressive measures which will come as a result of the CP military operations. In some cases the Party is forced underground as a result of government action, as in Greece. - 10 - Sanitized - Apwved For Release : CIA-RDP784915R000200110001-6 Sanitized - ApphKed For Release : CIA-RDP78-01W15R000200110001-6 SECRET CONTROL / U. b. urrIiiti 111 L \"SeeenintrAMIIPSIMMONSOn The Politburo and other central executive organs are moved from the city to the safe- base, and many of the members are reassigned to the various regional organizations. New Party organs are created, such as military staffs and support sections to direct and control the military operations. In Malaya, Armed Forces Departments were established in each State Committee. The Min Yuen (People's Movement) was organized. In the Philip- pines various technical sections were created. Other Party organs are strengthened and increased in size. In the Philippines the National Finance Committee and the Regional Finance Committees were placed under close cadre control. The Organizational Bureau was expanded. Some Party functional sections are dissolved to release cadres assigned to these sections for reassignment to more important functions. Increased emphasis is placed on Party schools. The cadres have to be trained for their new tasks. CP Philippines began training of special cadres to secure the cooperation of other armed groups who were non-Communist.) The communications system is strengthened. Courier service is better organized on a more regular basis. More people are assigned courier duties and regular message centers and lay-over places are established along courier routes. Plans are sometimes made (Philip- pines) for getting communications equipment and trained personnel and for establishing a wireless or land-line net. 50. Vulnerability during transition period. The Party is particularly vulnerable to counteraction in the period between the making of the decision and the time when its forces have been mobilized sufficiently for it to undertake a major military operation. The apparatus of the Party is in flux and its personnel often at loose ends, doing things at which they are still relative amateurs, and undergoing in most cases severe emotional and/or ideological crises. The machinery for conducting and supporting military operations is still imcomplete. Its supplies, particularly of weapons and ammunition, are likely to be limited. The propaganda build-up and the act of recruiting are necessarily semi-overt, at least locally. Party offices are physically being moved into the field or to safe-places for underground stay-behind opera- tions. Party records are destroyed or moved, and are subject to capture or loss in the pro- cess: it may be difficult for the Party's security apparatus to check the bona fides of new re- cruits. All these factors provide opportunities for surveillance of functionaries, seizure of records, penetration, defection, and provocation; An alert security force might very well be able to squash a colonial insurrection before it had developed, but any action would have to be thorough and ruthless. E. DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMUNIST ARMY. 51. Recruitment of Communist military forces was simplified for Communist Parties beginning revolutions after World War II. The nucleus of their military organization was the wartime resistance movements which had been sponsored by them and equipped and supplied by the Allies. As new recruits were channelled to the military forces, the Party was able to seize and maintain a base of operations from which further political-military expansion could be launched. Thus, there has been first an army, and then a safe-base. The Chinese Commu- nists learned their lesson the hard way, by experience. They organized an area by political means alone and then organized a military force. Not until the experience of the Long March and the establishment of the safe-base in Shensi did they begin to utilize systematically their military force in expansion. 52. The size and structure of the regular units of the Communist Army depends, on the stage of development of the safe-base and the type of operations being carried out. In the be- ginning, squads and platoons undertake guerrilla operations on a small, loosely coordinated scale. At that time, they live entirely off the countryside with infrequent communications with each other. As the scale of operations grows, these small units are incorporated into larger formations, (e.g., regiments and divisions) with regular service elements, coordinating staffs, and comprehensive communications. As a rule, however, units are kept small, to simplify supply and to reduce vulnerability to enemy attack. Sanitized - Approved For RVONIMIA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 r,rin 'Its /W. 11. NWT 84445 Sanitized - Approwitikatipti#Nifeleisigekik-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 Three available examples of post-war colonial Communist armies--Greece, Philip- pines, Malaya--show how resources and events influence the general organization of the army: a. Greece. Began with rather large forces about 10,000), well-equipped, well- led, and safely based. Conversion from small-scale operations by small bands to tactical employment of Brigades and Divisions early in the struggle. Regression to guerrilla operations with unfavorable conditions. b. Philippines. Began with relatively large force ? (about 10,000), already in the field and presumably adequately equipped. Passed to impressive Seizures of towns in apparently battalion strength within seven months of deeision and planned conversion to orthodox (\"regular arm?) operations in near future. c. Malaya. Began with few forces, not adequately equipped, not fully mobilized, and with little actual combat experience. Apparently comtemplated ambitious operations in at least regimental strength at early date. However, unfavorable conditions forced progressive disintegration of tactical organization and diminish- ing operations. 53. The troops of the colonial Communist force in the beginning are \"regulars\" --that is, they are full-time fighters and are, on the whole, politically \"reliable.\" As goon as opera- tions are begun, efforts are made to draw in non-Communist peasants?first, into political and support activities, then into part-time or \"irregular\" fighting formations, and eventually, into the full-time, \"regular\" army. Even when the build-up consists of a campaign of terror- ism, as in Malaya, the first fighting units are select military cadres, and in every case stud- ied, some kind of irregular fighting groups were formed later. 54. The most important general conditions limiting the size of regular formations used tactically, and consequently, the organization of the army are: a. Supplies. If inadequate, operations must be small and aimed at obtaining (small raids ambushes). If no supply organization exists, then forces must spend time foraging and will not be able to concentrate for the time necessary for careful planning, briefing, and rehearsal of large operations. Heterogeneous weapons and necessity to refit ammunition limit firepower and feasibility of large operations. b. tnemy tactics. Until final stage (full-scale engagement of enemy), Commu- nist tactics are in direct response to enemy tactics; flight and temporary disin- tegration at advance of superior enemy; concentration and larger tactical opera- tions against small enemy forces and areas temporarily free frOm enemy. c. Condition of leadership, extent of training; morale of ranks. For example, the Chinese Communists had great dikficulty in solving logistical problems of large tactical deployment because leaders had been trained in small operations. d. Terrain. Particularly difficult terrain makes use of large units impossible or unprofitable. 55. Special and irregular units in the Communist Army are organized for two main purposes: to serve as training organizations for combat-able men who will eventually be ab- sorbed by the regular units and to organize non-combatants to give support to the regular forces, In China, for example, the combat-able persons were organized in Youth Vanguards and in Model Detachments, and many of them, when trained, were placed in units of the Field Forces. Self Defense Detachments, made up of older men, and Women's Detachments per- formed intelligence, medical and protective functions. In general, the first responsibility of the special and irregular units is to aid the reg- ular forces in military operations, engaging. in small battles, diversionary Moves, supplying food, caring for wounded, etc. They also protect Communist Party and front organizations and installations (Malaya), not only in the safe area, but in areas which have not yet been secured. They are called upon to carry out occasional acts of terror, such ,as assassinations, sabotage and intimidation. They take over local police authority in the early stages of consol- idation of newly won areas. They also serve to militarize those segments of the population - 12 - Sanitized - Apcved For Release : CIA-RDP78-W15R000200110001-6 Sanitized - ApphOed For Release : CIA-RDP78-041015R000200110001-6 3 which are unqualified for regular military service, thus exerting military control over them, and insuring their complicity in the Communist operation should there be any doubts concern- ing their loyalty to the cause. Formation and control of irregular units is often the responsibility of the local Party organization in its own name (e.g., the \"wide self-defense\" groups in Greece), or in the name of a controlled mass organization (e.g., \"Self-Protection\" squads of the People's Movement in Malaya). Sometimes (China), the Party organization in the regular army units organizes such units. 56. Organization and functions of staffs. The Communist military force consists of tactical formations performing military operations; and various staffs for planning, coordination and control, and the management of special support and technical services required for operations. The character of the military staff--their competence, composition, and relations with the Party political apparatus--varies with the actual situation as it is reflected in the \"phases\" of the insurrection. In the early stages, when the military force is being accumulated and is carrying on operations of a purely guerrilla nature, local staffs, responsible for tactical formations in a relatively small area and closely connected with corresponding organs of the Party's political apparatus, are most essential. At this time, whatever central direction may be given to the military forces is likely to be quite general, and exercised through the chan- nels of the political apparatus. The Secretariat of the CP Philippines, for example, took over the problems of centralized direction of HMB formations, serving as a General Headquarters for several months after the decision had been made to begin fighting. HMB units were direc- ted by the Regional Committees of the political apparatus, and the general control over them exercised by the Secretariat was achieved by courier correspondence and by posting members of the Political Bureau with the Regional Committees. Similarly, the Political Bureau of the CP Malaya is believed to have constituted itself as a \"Military High Command,\" while the State Committees of the political apparatus (through their Armed Forces Departments) took over the functions of area military staffs. 57. When conditions have permitted the numerical expansion of the military force and the acquisition of a safe base, or at least, prospects of one, it will be necessary to establish a firm central directing staff if operations are to progress beyond the guerrilla stage and the army to be satisfactorily serviced. Then, military operations become more technical and the military force will have to be reconstituted as a centralized auxiliary of the Party and its di- rection divorced to a large extent from local organs of the political apparatus. Conversely, if conditions prevent the expansion of the military force and its utilization in large-scale operations, direction may remain indefinitely in the hands of local organs of the political apparatus (cf. Malaya). 58. Central direction of a (military) technical nature is achieved by the creation of a General Headquarters, comprising a commander-in-chief, chief of staff, and varying numbers of chiefs for particular staff functions (intelligence, supply, communications, etc.), the estab- lishment of regular communications, and the regularizing of command channels through the military service (from General Headquarters through area headquarters to the tactical com- mand staffs). The Party may also organize a Military Committee or Commission, or similar body, at national Party headquarters for political control and coordination between the political and military (GHQ) programs. Thus the CP Philippines organized a Military Committee of 15 members to coordinate political and military work and to plan for the future reorganization of the HMB and the creation of its GHQ. There was a substantial overlapping of personnel be- tween the Military Committee and the GHQ, both being manned by top leaders of the political apparatus. 59. When a \"liberation\" government is created, the Communist military force oper- ates as a nominal agency of the Communist government. Thus the CP Greece organized a \"Supreme War Council of the Democratic Army\" in August 1948 to supervise the army's - 13 Sanitized - Approved For RerelieMIA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 Sanitized - Appreaktmlpfietlylilialimeenriel+A-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 General Headquarters. It consisted of ranking Party leaders, and its purpose has been de- scribed as an effort by the Party to water down the authority of General Markos, who was Commander in chief of the army, Minister of War in the \"Democratic Government\" and head of the General Headquarters, and who was suspected of Titoist nationalist deviationism. As first constituted, however, the President of the Supreme War Council was none other than Markos. 60. The same kind of overlapping of cadres between political and military organs occurs in the area staffs. It is sometimes difficult to tell where one leaves 'off and the other begins. Thus, even in the internal correspondence of the CP Philippines, no consistent at- tempt was made to distinguish between the (political) Regional Committees and the (military) Regional Commands, both being designated RECO's. Such a condition is most likely to be en- countered in the earlier stages of a colonial insurrection, when the military and political programs are practically one. Later, as conditions make it feasible to organize the military forces into a separate and centralized auxiliary, there will be a more clearly defined sep- aration between area military staffs and local organizations of the political apparatus. The reversal of this is to be seen in Malaya, where many units of the \"regular\" MRLA gradually were detached from any kind of central military direction and put under the local (District) committees of the political apparatus. Members of local Party committees are often given military command positions. They may continue to hold both jobs as long as the military unit stays in the home, area. 61. Party Control of the Military Organization. The establishment of firm control over the actions and loyalties of Communist troops in colonial insurrections is a difficult task. If the object of military operations is to facilitate political work in these insurrections, it is also a fact that military operations tend to defeat the political efforts. A guerrilla force must live off the countryside to a large extent and must have general public sympathy with it to do so. However, the force is a natural haven for mere brigands, whose activities, if not controlled with an \"iron discipline,' will bring discredit to the Communist movement as a whole, and make it increasingly difficult for the force to obtain supplies, intelligence, and recruits from the people. The guerrilla life itself tends to breed indiscipline--laziness, arrogance, immorality, greed, and disregard not only for life, but also for property that the Communists may greatly need at a later point in the struggle. It tends to develop political independence on the part of leaders, and to encourage personal, rather than organizational loyalties. The meanness of guerrilla life and its danger; its long periods of inaction, and the remoteness of victory--all make for unrest in the ranks. This is partly the reason for the exhortations the Parties make for some kind of operation, no matter how small, every day. In addition to the above, and numerous other factors, the Party must establish effective controls and constantly strive to maintain morale to prevent treachery and Suppress dissent- ers. it must prevent hostile penetration and defections, and cope with cadres who opposed the policy decision or accepted it with reservations. 62. Cultivation of discipline takes two lines: raising the political loyalty of the troops through Marxist study and propaganda; and organizing a control-supervisory-tale-bearing apparatus within the army. The task is the more difficult for the fact that colonial CP's consist of a mass of political semi-literates and a very small number of fully indoctrinated cadres. The control and indoctrination organization must make maximum economical use of the reliable cadres. 63. It is necessary, of course, to have military specialists in chary of military oper- ations. But military men are often shaky in their political convictions. The;: Party tries to overcome this by indoctrination, but has another solution: the Political Commissar. 64. The Political Commissar is an agent of the Party's political apparatus, assigned to a military command to ensure the political reliability of the military commander and su- pervise the political indoctrination of the troops.1 He sees to the proper application of orders 1 The institution of the Political Commissar was originated by the Russian Bolsheviks in 1917 for the October Revolution and the ensuing civil war. It was used by the *ed Army during World War II.

He may also be responsible for local civilian Party organizations in the section of operations of the command, and for mili- tary security and counter-intelligence. The Political Commissar has authority superior to that of the military commander in all political matters, and may even interfere in purely military matters. The CP Philippines suggested that, in the final, all-out battle, the Military Commander may take over full control, but presumably by then the political preparation will have been completed and the military campaign will be crucial. According to the size and shape of the command and availability of cadres, the Politi- cal Commissar may work alone or with assistants. In Greece and in China, the Political Commissar had his own staff organization. In the Chinese Communist 8th Route Army, for example, this staff was called a \"Political Department\" and consisted of five sections-- Organization Education People's Movement Enemy Services (POW's) Work Against Traitors (Counter-espionage) The functions of each of the above are described in more detail in China Appendix. The development of a Political Commissar System is illustrated in the case of the CP Philippines (q.v.): Political Bureau members were assigned to supervise the most important Regional Committees and key headquarters sections (Education, Finance) with the making of the policy decision. As the struggle developed and Regional cadres became more competent, it was decided to recall the PB members to staff national headquarters and to \"advance promising personnel boldly.\" Political Commissars, however, were to continue to be assigned to military commands until the final battle. 65. When the situation and condition of the army impose a decentralization, the local Party organization may be expected to assume the control function over a Communist mili- tary force in the area. This is the reversal of the practice of the Chinese Communists after the Long March, but it is what seemsAo have happened in Malaya. It may be expected in the beginnings of resistance struggle or insurrection, but if it happens later in the struggle after a greater centralization had been instituted, it is probably retrograde: the military force is not being utilized to maximum advantage. 66. Another control practice is the creation of a Party organization within the mili- tary force. It consists of cells in the lowest units, and is directed through a normal system of committees (company, battalion, regimental, etc.), in each case probably responsible to the Political Commissar. F. ORGANIZATION OF SUPPORT 67. The Communist military effort in colonial countries can grow only by drawing to itself popular support. In adverse circumstances, the rebel forces can break down into small bands capable of foraging for themselves, carrying on operations that require neither commu- nications with each other nor more intelligence than can be obtained from immediate recon- naissance. However, such defensive military tactics are politically sterile. For any advance to be made, the Communists must produce larger operations by larger units, whereupon problems of supply, manpower, communicatOns, and intelligence will have to be met by organizations out- side the military. Therefore the Party must organize the civilian population (usually peasants and villagers) to fulfill these needs and also, to bring more and more people into the revolu- tionary movement. - 16 - Sanitized - Approved For RergatirtIA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 iiii1FLiT ~10***NepreOPP/ia Sanitized - AppromMarrelemeiwillOPROP78-00915R000;200110001-6 68. In the safe-base area, practically the entire non-combat population is mobilized into the fighting force itself, or into support organizations. CP China is probably the best example of the extensive organization of civilian support groups. The support units of the Chinese revolution were so well organized that often one individual was a member of more than one organization. Support functions were concentrated in the Peoples' Militia (although this organization was also responsible for some combat duties), and included Women's Groups, Youth Groups, Self Defense Detachments (made up of older?though able-bodied-- men) and were assigned tasks commensurate with their abilities. Specialized groups growing out of these units were formed, such as the Model Detachments, which were especially capa- ble members of the youth groups. All of the civilian groups performed mai* different sup- port functions: supply, communications, intelligence, medical work, etc. During the Japan- ese resistance period, the activities of these groups and of the Peoples' Militia were directed by local People's Committees for Anti-Japanese Armed Resistance. 69. In Malaya, the various civilian support organizations were grouped under the Min Yuen (People's Movement). These included the Races Liberation Alliance, Village and Squatter Area Committees, Peasants Union, Women's Union, and various Anti-British Leagues and Associations. Organizationally, they were similar to the MCPJ The type of support function expected of each group was, as in China, according to their; abilities. The success of the organizations outside the safe base was, of course, considerably less because the Communists lacked the coercive hold-on the civilian groups. 70. Most of these organizations existed within the safe base area. In areas outside the safe-base, organization of \"mass\" support was achieved by local organs of the political apparatus, by the political organizers attached to the military force, or by rhixed teams, such as the \"expansion\" teams of the CP Philippines (political organizers assisted by small armed detachments). 71. In some cases, it may be profitable for the Party to organize an apparatus for collecting and bringing money and other supplies from abroad, as the CP Greece did through its Mutual Aid (EA) and seamen's union (OEN0). 72. Manpower. The original military complement is obtained by a rhobilization of the members of the Party, from such still active guerrilla forces as it may have from resistance warfare (e.g., the Huk in the Philippines), and/or from mobilization of controlled veterans organizations (Malaya, Greece). The Chinese Communists obtained their original force by drafting peasants in the name of the soviets which the Party had set up by pOlitical means. 73. Later recruits for reinforcement and replacement are obtained by forced mobili- zation in the safe-base area, by propaganda-recruiting drives in other areas, and by transfer from the \"mass\" support organizations. 74. Coercion is common practice. In the safe-base area, it is automatic (see the \"mobilization\" proclamations issued by the Greek Communist \"Democratic Army\" promising punishment for failure to respond). In areas outside the safe-base, roving guerrilla bands often impress civilian youths or threaten reprisals to villages if the young Men refuse to come out for the insurrection. The Communists also try to get neutral civilians involved in the movement by degrees, threatening to expose them should they balk at an step. The pea- sant is forced or awed into giving a little food or making a small money co4ribution or giving information on the movements of an enemy troop, and is then drawn more closely into the work of local \"mass\" organizations, eventually passing into part-time \"self-defense\"actions, and finally, into full-time fighting. 1 75. The main recruiting function of underground city organizations in enemy areas is apparently (cf. Philippines) to recruit technical personnel -- mechanics, drivers, communi- cations men, medical personnel, automatic and heavy-weapons technicians, dtc. 76. Intelligence. The Communist force needs information on enemy movements, iden- tities of enemy agents, terrain, and popular sentiments for its own defense. It needs infor- mation on the disposition of enemy forces, character of defenses of enemy installations, lo- cation of assailable convoys, etc. for its offensive operations. (See Malaya, paragraph 65, for items considered by the MRLA in planning an attack.) - 16 - stirrItTota.

All members of the Party and its mass organizations act as informants. Their product is channeled through whatever organizational channel may be available. Local \"mass\" organizations may even have a particular person charged with collecting and trans- mitting intelligence items. 78.. Secret reporting points may be established into which information obtained by all sources in a given area is funneled for collation and further transmission. In Greece, such \"Intelligence Centers\" were organized and manned by intelligence specialists of the regular Communist army. In Malaya, \"District Information Centers\" appear to have been established by the District Committees of the political apparatus, but a military representative was stationed at them to transmit information to the nearest Communist army unit. 79. The military force itself produces intelligence by reconnaissance, command ob- servation, and prisoner interrogation. The extent to which military intelligence is special- ized depends upon the organizational condition of the Communist force and the magnitude of its operations. In a centralized army, such as that of the CP Greece, the intelligence function may be performed by a special service, with intelligence sections an integral feature of the military staffs, and with intelligence teams attached to combat units (for reconaissance and prisoner-interrogation). 80. Communications. For lack of technical equipment and trained personnel, the colonial Communist military force is usually reduced to courier communications. 81. Couriers are frequently recruited from the \"mass\" organizations, women and children being favored because they are less likely to excite suspicion. 82. Each political and military organization has its own courier pool. High-ranking functionaries frequently have their own personal couriers. 83. In Malaya, and probably elsewhere, regular courier runs were organized, with a chain of safe-resting places and message centers where messages could be delivered or picked up. 84. Special courier services are frequently organized. The Communist military staffs in Philippines and Greece included communications sections. In tlie Philippines, a special Communications Department of the Party existed before the current uprising and needed only expansion to make it usable for military operations. 85. Radio and telephone communications are normally beyond the capabilities of Communist colonial forces. The CP Greece had fairly comprehensive W/T nets (W/T issued to units down to brigades, and to battalions on special missions). The Chinese Communists gradually developed extensive W/T and land-line systems. In the beginning of their revolu- tion, they had only occasional wireless communications between Juichin and the Central Committee in Shanghai. The CP Philippines considered the establishment of a wireless net in 1950, one feature of which was a proposal to plant a Communist in a standard broadcasting station in Manila: he would broadcast carefully camouflaged coded messages in the course of his regular announcements. 86. Supply. Supply of food is no great problem in a period of decentralized military operations. Interdiction of the regular food supply can hamper the expansion of a Communist force, but need not mean its defeat, for the guerrillas can live off the countryside to a large extent. When the tactical formations have been enlarged and are operating away from home, a regular food supply service becomes essential. 87. Local \"mass\" organizations furnish supplies of food. See, for example, the People's Movement in Malaya. Special production, storing, and distribution services may be organized by the Party or the military force, usually on a local basis. The CP Philippines planned to create \"Production Departments\" on a Regional Committee level and it was pro- posed to organize \"Harvest Struggle Committees\" in military commands. The Greek Commu- nists had a regular quartermaster corps, with supply trains running down from Yugoslavia and supply service elements in tactical formations and a transport service. One of the rea- sons for the defeat of the Greek uprising was the inability of the Communists to supply their forces at some distance from the safe base. - 17 - Sanitized - Approved For algAM.4JWNIA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 FLINCPFLITCRserITIffegifisPWINNIMANWPIPM Sanitized - ApprefreliftrikellowasplielA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 88. Armaments. An adequate supply of arms and ammunition is a more difficult pro- blem for the colonial Communists. They depend to a large extent on what they can capture from the enemy. As the CP Philippines put it, \"our main source of weapons ultimately is Washington. . . .\" In some cases the Party may have appreciable quantities of arms left over from the anti-Japanese resistance. In Greece, the Party had free access for some time to weapons produced in the neighboring satellites. The CP China is expected to provide arms and ammunition in quantity to the insurgents in Indochina when it can afford to do so, and may do the same for the Communists in Burma. 89. The Party may be able to buy some arms in the general black market and from corrupt Government troops. Communists in the Greek Army in the early stages of the in- surrection there furnished some arms to the guerrillas by deserting with as many weapons as they could carry. The CP Philippines hoped in the final stages of its revolution to be able to subvert Government troops and get them to bring over their heavy weapons fOr the Party. 90. One difficulty is that the colonial party's arms are of many different sizes and types. This means that ammunition supply is complicated and Communist fire-power often very limited. The CP Malaya set up armorers' shops in safe areas where disparate ammuni- tion could be refitted and weapons repaired. Bombs, mines, and general explosives are also manufactured by the Communists in safe areas. (The CP Philippines had a Technological Group of specialists at its headquarters for the production of such weapons.) The Party is sometimes able to establish arsenals across the frontier: for example, the Buljkes camp of the CP Greece; the Viet Minh forces in Indo-China were at one time reported to have had shops in Thailand. HI. THE COMMUNIST RESISTANCE ORGANIZATION A. OBJECTIVES AND LIMITATIONS 91. Communist Parties in countries overrun by the Axis during the last War carried on military and political resistance to the occupation forces. The Commilmist aims were-- (a) to render maximum assistance to the USSR by harassing her Axis enemies; (b) to strength- en the Party for the resumption of the class struggle in the postwar period. Tactically and organizationally, the Communist military resistance was similar to the Communist armed uprising in colonial countries. The Parties began fighting with limited Party membership and limited mass support. The Communist aim was to harass the enemy, not to overwhelm him, or even, in the first stages, to attack his forces directly. Fighting formations were generally small and were not closely controlled by a central headquarters in their operations. Guerrilla tactics were used, and safe bases were established where possible. 92. The fighting resistance, begun by small forces, attracted numerOus non-Commu- nists who were moved by patriotism. In some countries, the Communist Party rallied so many supporters and built up such a good military force that it was able to turn the resistance struggle into an armed insurrection after the Axis forces had been driven out. In other coun- tries, although unable to turn immediately to an insurrectionary effort, the Parties emerged from the resistance with greatly enhanced political prestige and with reserves of trained fighters who could be used in an insurrection when conditions became favorable. 93. Communist resistance was not exclusively military. The Parties also carried on political resistance and economic sabotage: Political resistance: agitation against the enemy; encouraging sabotage of occupation administration by passive non-cooperation and inhibiting cooperation on the part of those inclined to submit; stimulating minor political unrest--protest demonstrations, slow-down movements in production, violation of commodity control procedures. Economic Sabotage: organization of secret sabotage groups in productive centers, utilities, etc. to damage equipment, waste materials, cause snarls in production traffic, produce faulty materials, etc. - 18 - Sanitized - Apwed For Release: CIA-RDP78-W15R000200110001-6 Sanitized - Apprbeed For Release : CIA-RDP78-01341115R000200110001-6 bectu iLy 1111W. 1114LLUli Military Resistance: creation of a military force to make attacks on enemy forces, installations, and supply lines for purposes of weakening morale of occupation troops; to make it more difficult to realize full economic and military value of the occupation; to make it necessary for the enemy to divert forces to militarily unproductive duties, etc.; aid Allied armies by providing intelligence and limited tactical support. 94. In non-industrial countries, the Parties concentrated largely on military resist- ance. It was more profitable for them to do so, and terrain and other factors made it possi- ble to establish and hold the safe-bases necessary to substantial military operations. 95. In industrial countries the Communists divided their efforts among military, political, and economic resistance, not only because it was most profitable in political terms and in terms of how much it benefited the USSR, but also, because it was practically impos- sible to build up and hold areas safe enough and large enough for serious military operations. 96. It is difficult to gauge the actual effectiveness of Communist military resistance. There is no question but that the military and economic resistance carried out in France was of considerable help to the Western Allies, but it is impossible to say how much of this was owing to the Communists. The military resistance of the Soviet Partisans was probably of even more help to the Red Army: it kept large numbers of German troops busy in protecting duties, deprived the Germans of a large share of needed agricultural produce, interfered with German military communications, assisted the intelligence work of the Red Army and other Soviet agencies, and was of some use in direct tactical support of advancing Red Army forces when the Germans retreated. B. ORGANIZATION OF MILITARY RESISTANCE 97. In the countries where the Party concentrated on military resistance, the bulk of the Party was put on a military footing and a single or several safe-bases were organized. Offices of the political apparatus of the Party were transformed into central and area (mili- tary) staffs. Most of the fighting formations were composed of \"regulars\" (i.e., full-time guerrillas). 98. In occupied industrial countries, where military resistance was less exclusively the form of resistance engaged in, only a portion of the Party was put on a military footing and the remainder was employed in other forms of resistance action (political action, econo- mic sabotage). Fighting units were more often made up of \"irregulars\" (i.e., part-time fighters). 99. The Party often carried on military resistance in the name of a \"roof\" organi- zation (\"liberation front,\" etc.) which included forces of non-Communist organizations. The Party tried to get full control of such fronts. When it could not, it was sometimes obliged to accept general direction from the (non-Communist) headquarters of the organization (Italy), or it accepted only nominal direction, actually retaining full organizational and operational independence (e.g., the relationship of the FTPF of the CP France to the National Council of Resistance). 100. Initial military resistance complements were obtained in the following ways: a. The Party set up organizing committees in the offices of the political apparatus to mobilize able Party members: assigned cadres to take command of military groups, arranged for arming them and sending them into military opera- tfonal bases in the countryside (e.g., the \"War Commissions\" set up by the CP Yugoslavia on a national and on Regional and District levels). b. The Party dispatched individual organizers and organizing teams to the field to take over already existing resistance formations (Greece, Italy). c. Outside agencies sometimes assisted the Parties to set up and maintain mili- tary resistance forces: In the USSR, agents of the Party, Red Army, and State Security services stayed behind or were sent into occupied areas to organize fighting resistance units. - 19 - Sanitized - Approved For RXEMMICA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 Sanitize.\" - 9910 ? lialleriar -: . 1 ;-'9-- ; 7.\": R000200110001-6 n In Malaya, the British and the Party cooperated to organize forces prior to the Japanese invasion, and the British Army later sent organizing and tech- nical advisory teams to aid the Communist guerrillas. 101. Some Parties (Yugoslavia, France, Italy) had a mobilizable nucleus of men who had fought in the Spanish Civil War. Considerable numbers of soldiers and officers of the state army defeated by the Axis also joined the Communist guerrilla forces in some countries (Yugoslavia in particular). 102. Parties that had had considerable experience in underground operations (France, Yugoslavia, Greece) had some advantage over non-Communist organizations in establishing their first resistance bands. The non-Communists, particularly in France, were more dis- turbed by the repressive measures taken by the occupying forces. The Communist Party, which already had workable secret communications lines, contacts, safehouses, and cadres who know how to work effectively and still preserve their own freedom, was able to establish active guerrilla bands as soon as its policy made it profitable to do so. On the other hand, in Italy, where the Party had been thoroughly repressed for years, it had not been able to preserve its cadres and may have been unable to organize a central resistance staff independ- ent of non-Communist organizations. 103. Additional recruits were obtained by the organizational and propaganda efforts of underground political organs of the Party and the political resistance fronts established by it; by the actions of the fighting units themselves; and by getting control of spontaneously formed groups and of those organized by non-Communists. The CP France, for example, published instructions to patriotic youths to form their Own groups and carry on actions that would quickly get the attention of regular FTPF cadres, who would then get in touch with the new bands. One strong reason why the Party was alway? anxious to obtain supplies from the Allies was the fact that adequate armaments a.nd other supplies were a good recruiting argu- ment. C. STAFFS 104. The Party created staffs to control and give technical support to the combat for- mations. Tactical formations had their own command staffs, and staffs were organized on an area basis also, to coordinate the operations of tactical formations within the area., Staffs were manned by Party members as far as poSsible, but non-Communists were also utilized in tactical command positions, under close political supervision of Party cadres. In countries where the Party concentrated rather exclusively on military resistance, regular organs (com- mittees and working offices of committees) of the political apparatus were converted into military staffs; for example, the Political Bureau, or a part of it, became a General Head- quarters, while a Regional Committee would transform itself into a regional military staff. In France, a central Staff and various lower area staffs were organized parallel to the politi- cal apparatus, which was retained, but independent of it below the Inter-Region (?) level. It is possible that a similar practice was followed by the Party in other countries where the re- sistance effort was divided among political, military, and economic resistanee activities. The organizational pattern should not be viewed as having been mechanically applied by the Party. The political apparatus of the Party continued to exist, trimmed down to underground operations, in areas held by the enemy even in countries where the military resistance was by far the most important effort of the Party. Committees of the political apparatus that were converted to military staff duties were sometimes revamped prior to the conversion, with a view to the most efficient utilization of specialist cadres: men were assigned and reassigned according to their talents and the military needs of the moment. Special organizing commit- tees were sometimes created by higher headquarters of the Party's political apparatus to go to an area and instruct the area committee in the setting up of military staffs and to super- vise personnel selections made by the area committee. In at least one case (Philippines), the headquarters of the military resistance was set up and manned by a regional committee of the Party, the reason being that that particular regional committee (Central Luzon Committee) had assumed the leadership of the whole Party when the members of the normal headquarters organ were arrested by the Japanese. 105. Communist resistance staffs had approximately the same composition as Commu- nist insurrectionary staffs in colonial countries. Technical services were represented in the General Headquarters and in lower area staffs, and in the case of large, safely-based forces, - 20 - Sanitized - Anwed For Release : CIA-RDP78-W15R000200110001-6 Sanitized - ApphKed For Release : CIA-RDP78-011015R000200110001-6 n in higher tactical command staffs (Division, Brigade) as well. Political Commissars were customarily attached to area and larger tactical command staffs. A typical General Head- quarters, duplicated in most respects by higher area staffs, would have the following com- positon: Commander Political Commissar Vice-Commander Supply Officer Communications Officer Intelligence Officer Ordnance Officer Administrative Officer Medical Officer D. TACTICAL FORMATIONS 106. The size, shape, and articulation of military units used tactically depended upon particular missions, capabilities of the military resistance as a whole, and the degree to which the Party concentrated its efforts on the military resistance form. In countries where military resistance was most important and safe bases had been established, Brigades and even Divisions were employed. In France, on the other hand, most attacks were made by squads and platoons. In general, enemy strength being what it was, it was found impractical to try to use elements larger than a Brigade in a tactical operation. The Hubalahaps of the CP Philippines, for example, suffered a devastating loss when they concentrated large numbers in a single area where the Japanese found it profitable to attack in force and to em- ploy aircraft against them. Even when relatively large units were used in an operation, it was customary to stick to guerrilla tactics, and the effect was more that of a number of small units taking part in the operation under fairly loose control, rather than of a closely coordi- nated action of an orthodox large unit. 107. As in the Communist colonial insurrection, there were both \"regular\" (full-time) and \"irregular\" (part-time) units in the Communist resistance armies. In the FTPF in France, for example, the \"francs-tireurs\" were people who lived outwardly peaceful lives in the villages And towns and who came together on call to carry out operations, returning to their homes when the mission was completed. The \"partisans,\" on the other hand, were people who lived in small camps in the woods and who were full-time guerrillas. The Chi- nese Communists organized both full-time resistance forces and \"irregulars\" (the People's Militia, which furnished intelligence to the regular units, did sentry duty, acted as guides and stretcher bearers for the regulars, and carried out harassing operations against isolated Japanese strong-points). The seizure and maintenance of a safe base does not mean the end of recruitment and utilization of irregular forces in areas under full or partial enemy control: the Yugoslav Partisans continued to raise part-time detachments outside the safe-base area for harassing operations at the same time that their regular units?were making larger attacks out of the safe base. Irregular units were often organized for defense, as well as support functions; the SAP's in Italy and the People's Militia in China stood guard while farmers brought in their crops for the resistance; the Soviet Partisans also organized self-defense groups among the peasants for the same purpose. In France, the Party organized armed de- fense groups within the organizations of the political apparatus itself to protect demonstrators. secret installations (headquarters, safe houses, printing plants, etc.) in an attempt to relieve the FTPF military formations of such tasks. 108. Party Control of Tactical Units. The Communists tried to draw as many people as possible into their military resistance. In many cases this meant that the ranks of the tactical formations were predominantly non-Communist. A control problem existed. Even in coun- tries where the Party was large, as in France, it has difficulty finding sufficient reliable cadres to take command assignments. In some countries it was necessary to put non- Communists in charge of large tactical formations and even on important staffs. Wherever possible, Communists with military talents or experience were given command assignments, but sheer military necessity dictated the utilization of able non-Communist military personnel to the fullest extent. ? - 21 - Sanitized - Approved For IteinglibrogilA-RDP78-00915R000200110001-6 Sanitize R000200110001-6 109. Control was exercised in the resistance force by the same methods as in the Communist colonial insurrection: reliable Party members were put in charge of central and area staffs which perforce, often contained some non-Communists; Political Commissars were assigned to tactical formations as a check on the military commanders; an effort was made to indoctrinate the non-Communists in Communist principles. It is interesting to note that the Communist revolutionary line was deliberately played down in the Soviet Partisans, while patriotism was played up: this may have been the case in other Communist military resistance forces also, but probably to a lesser extent.1 110. Local committees of the underground political apparatus of the Party in areas of resistance fighting had a share in the direction of resistance formations. Details on this relationship are lacking, but it is believed that underground political functionaries often as- signed tactical missions to the resistance formations, took part in operational planning with the military staffs, and when communications between the latter and higher military head- quarters were broken, exercised general control over the units (see Soviet Partisans). 111. The tightness of centralized control varied from one country to another. Commu- nications, availability of Party cadres, and the existence of an underground political apparatus determined the extent of centralization of control. The development of the Soviet Partisans, for example, illustrates the variations: they began with small isolated units under the in- dependent control of indi"
