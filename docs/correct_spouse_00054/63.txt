He earned his Juris Doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley, and went on to practice law in the entertainment industry. Stern became widely known to the public as the companion and attorney of Anna Nicole Smith.

Their relationship evolved from professional to personal, and Stern played a significant role in Smith’s life during her legal battles and personal struggles. He supported her during high-profile court cases, including her fight for a share of her late husband’s estate and the paternity dispute over her daughter. However, Stern’s involvement in Smith’s life also brought him considerable controversy and legal challenges, impacting his own reputation and public image.

It is unclear whether he is currently married or in a committed relationship, as he has not made any public statements or provided clues about his romantic life. Stern has chosen to keep this aspect of his personal affairs confidential, and it remains uncertain if he will disclose any details in the future.

While Howard and Anna Nicole Smith had an intimate ring exchanging ceremony in the Bahamas in 2006, they were never legally married. After Anna Nicole’s untimely death, Stern has largely stayed out of the public eye. He does not have any known children, following the paternity controversy involving Larry Birkhead. It seems that Stern has not remarried since Smith’s passing, and if he has entered into a marriage or formed a long-term partnership, he has chosen to keep it away from public scrutiny.

What Happened to Howard K Stern?

Throughout her life, Anna Nicole Smith garnered both adoration and criticism from many individuals. However, one person who played a significant role in her life was Howard K. Stern, who acted as a close companion and staunch supporter of the late model and reality star. Initially known to Anna’s fans as her attorney and business manager, their relationship gradually evolved into a deeply personal connection during her final years.

In fact, their bond became so intimate that Howard and Anna entered into a brief marriage and jointly raised her daughter, Dannielynn Birkhead, prior to Anna’s tragic demise in 2007. After Anna’s passing, Howard seemed to retreat from the public eye. When Anna gave birth to Dannielynn on September 7, 2006, there was speculation that Howard was the child’s father. In honor of him, the former Playmate of the Year named her daughter Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern.

Sadly, tragedy struck again as Anna’s son, Daniel Smith, tragically passed away from an accidental drug overdose in the same month. Amidst her profound grief, Anna and Howard participated in a non-binding commitment ceremony in the Bahamas, although they were never officially married under the law.

Where is Howard K Stern now??

As of May 2024, Howard remains a resident of Los Angeles, where he practices law at the Public Defender’s Office. Following years of controversy and accusations surrounding his alleged involvement in Anna Nicole’s death, with some claiming he supplied her with drugs, Howard has deliberately maintained a low public profile. After facing extensive legal battles regarding his alleged role in Anna’s prescription drug misuse, Howard was ultimately acquitted of all charges.

This decision followed his prior sale of many of these items in a public auction several years earlier. According to Howard, the cost of maintaining the storage unit had surpassed the value of the items over time. It was reported that Howard subsequently gave the stored items to Dannielynn, who was 13 years old at the time.
