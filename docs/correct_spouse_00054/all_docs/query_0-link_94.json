        "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE -- Anna Nicole Smith said in a 2001 will that all property of her estate should be given to longtime companion Howard K. Stern to hold in trust for her son, who has died, according to a document released Friday.\n\nThe document said the former Playboy Playmate's estate should be held in trust for son Daniel Smith, who died last year, three days after Smith gave birth to a daughter.\n\n\"I have intentionally omitted to provide for my spouse and other heirs, including future spouses and children and other descendants now living and those hereafter born or adopted,\" Smith said in the will.\n\nStern and two other men claim to have fathered Smith's infant daughter, Dannielynn.\n\nThe will did not say where Smith wanted to be buried, but named Stern as her executor.\n\nThe attorney for Smith's estranged mother, Virgie Arthur, said the will wasn't filed in any court, so it is not valid. Arthur attorney Stephen Tunstall on Thursday called the document a \"phantom will,\" adding, \"They say he is an executor. You are not an executor or a personal representative unless a court appoints you.\"\n\nThe will was released hours after a judge approved the embalming of Smith's remains and tried to broker an agreement among the three people fighting over her body.\n\nBut lengthy legal fights still loomed over where she will be buried and who will get custody of the daughter, who could inherit millions of dollars. A court hearing over Smith's final resting place was already in its third day and stopped around noon for the holiday weekend and was set to resume Tuesday.\n\nStern is trying to get control of Smith's remains, as is Arthur. Photographer Larry Birkhead hopes Smith's DNA will help prove he fathered Dannielynn. Stern is listed as the father on the girl's birth certificate."
