Her estranged mother claimed that Anna Nicole was to be buried at her home state of Texas, while her partner before her death Howard K.

During the case hearing of where her bodied would be buried, Howard said of the mother-son bond, ” he said. “Anna and Daniel were inseparable. Daniel was without question the most important person in Anna’s life. From the time I met her, everything was for Daniel,” he said. “I would say that physically, she died last week, but in a lot of ways, emotionally she died when Daniel died.” Anna reportedly climbed into her son’s coffin during his funeral.\n\nBefore her death, Anna Nicole Smith was embroiled in a paternity lawsuit with her ex-boyfriend Larry Birkhead for her daughter Dannielynn. Anna affirmed that Howard K. Stern was the father of the child.

Thank you for the people who got me this far. Thank you very much. My baby’s gonna be coming home pretty soon. Things are moving quickly here, and we’ll see what happens.”\n\nLarry and Howard were amicable once the results were announced and hugged outside the court room. “We’re gonna do what we can to make sure that the best interests of Dannielynn are carried out,” Howard said. “And I’m going to do whatever I can to make sure that he gets sole custody. Larry can come over to the house and spend as much time with [Dannielynn] as he wants to right now.”\n\nAnna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me is now available to stream on Netflix.\n\nRELATED: Jerry Springer, Legendary Talk Show Host, Dies at 79 After Secret Health Battle"
