She appeared as Za-Za in the Coen brothers' movie \"The Hudsucker Proxy\" and as Tanya in \"Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult,\" both released in 1994. Business Insider USA\n\nMarshall's son E. Pierce Marshall had begun the legal process of cutting Smith off from spousal support when his father got sick, according to the documentary, and the matter wasn't resolved at the time of Marshall's death.
