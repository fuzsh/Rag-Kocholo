I only saw one I think on E, and from what I have read through the years, she was a very troubled soul with a bunch of toxic, vampires in her life which led her down the wrong path and to death..\n\nYes the Netflix one is a new one as it got released this past Tuesday. And some of the people speaking were friends with Howard K Stern and Howards sister was speaking. Almost made me think he secretly had a hand in making it. And Annas bodyguard from the Bahamas claimed Howard didnt make Anna take the drugs, she took it willingly\n\nLast edited by Celticsfan08; 05-21-2023 at 04:10 PM..\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Celticsfan08\n\nYes the Netflix one is a new one as it got released this past Tuesday.

The drugs were available to her, Stern was an enabler but I think a shark as well. I wouldn't trust anyone in Anna's circle to be honest or trustworthy. I don't think she was controllable either or that anyone could have prevented her self destruction. She was absolutely devastated about the loss of her son and probably just wanted to be with him.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Celticsfan08\n\nThat definitely wasn't her best moment in her life marrying someone 70 years older then her with the general public thinking she was some type of gold digger\n\nThe media and his relatives were horrible to her. She was painted to be a gold digger. A gold digger does not get pregnant love her child and mourn the death of her son. A gold digger only cares about money and nothing else. That was not her. But I understand to some extend the feelings of her 70 yr old husbands doubts about her and her marrying for money. I think she really did care for him and even love him as a wife would. Maybe not sexually but then there is so much more to marriage than just sex. Now I see how the media is so far out of control even worse than back then."
