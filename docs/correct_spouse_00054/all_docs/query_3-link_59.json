        "text": "Some people will do anything to get ahead. Some will work hard every second of every day. Others might step all over someone just to accomplish what they truly want. Then, there's another way: marrying someone who has a lot more money than they do.\n\nWhen you think about it, this might be one of the more popular ways, especially in Hollywood. At the end of the day, for some, it's all about getting that sweet, sweet dough. A lasting, life-long, loving relationship? Only if it's with Benajmin Franklin!\n\nSome celebrities stay married to their breadwinner while others choose to get a divorce. That way, they can usually get half of whatever is \"theirs,\" whether it was gained during the marriage or not. Most of the time they usually collect a huge settlement and alimony—which basically sets them up for life. True, it depends on the celebrity, but these people don't exactly scope out the ones on the downtrend, ya know?\n\nGranted, we can’t say that all of these celebrities got into marriage for the money; some on this list are just rumored to be money-hungry—or came out of the relationship coincidentally more wealthy than they were going into it."
