        "text": "Howard K Stern, the companion of model Anna Nicole Smith and executor of her will, has filed court papers seeking six per cent of whatever the model's estate might recover from her late husband's fortune.\n\nStern filed his creditor's claim October 18 in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing a contingent fee agreement on file in bankruptcy court.\n\nSmith, who died in February in Florida, was the widow of Texas oil tycoon J Howard Marshall II.\n\nShe had been fighting Marshall's family for years over his estimated $US500 million ($A565 million) fortune.\n\nSmith's 13-month-old daughter, Dannielynn, stands to inherit any portion of the money that might have gone to her mother.\n\nIn the court filing, first reported by the website CelebTV.com, Stern specifies that his six per cent payment \"is conditioned upon recovery in the Marshall litigation\".\n\nStern also filed papers last week seeking to make Dannielynn the sole beneficiary of Smith's estate, though the child is not mentioned in the will.\n\nAP"
