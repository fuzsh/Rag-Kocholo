        "text": "A COURT battle for the body of Anna Nicole Smith kicked off in all-out war yesterday amid amazing claims the ex-model was killed by her lover.\n\nFor the first time since Anna, 39, died of a suspected drug overdose two weeks ago all the main players faced each other.\n\nIt should have been a calm legal hearing. But in minutes it degenerated into an ill-tempered circus played for the benefit of TV cameras broadcasting to a gripped nation.\n\nMum Virgie Arthur and Anna's boyfriend Howard K Stern, 38, are each claiming to be next of kin so they can bury the former Playboy centrefold near their homes.\n\nFormer boyfriend Larry Birkhead, 32 - who is fighting Stern for paternity of Anna's five-month-old girl Dannielynn - is a witness.\n\nAfter early sparring, tensions finally boiled over as Stern's lawyer Krista Barth spoke about his \"12-year relationship\" with Anna.\n\nAs she did so, Birkhead's lawyer Debra Opri mouthed words and pointed to a clearly agitated Stern.\n\nMoments later, furious Barth railed at the judge: \"Ms Opri just made a statement to my client that he actually killed Miss Smith. I have to protect him.\"\n\nStern has been blamed by Anna's family for her death though the tragedy is still under investigation.\n\nIn scenes mirroring the drama of Anna's own doomed life, each of the warring parties had arrived at Florida's Broward County Court with an entourage of attorneys, family and beefy bodyguards.\n\nFirst on the scene was a glum-looking Stern who walked into the packed courtroom with shoulders hunched. Minutes later, Birkhead entered. With his pin-up looks, bleached hair, tanned skin and sharp suit he could not look more different to his rival.\n\nAs he took his seat, Opri cynically checked with a broadcasting crew inside the court to make sure her client was sitting within the range of cameras.\n\nThe media-savvy attorney, who successfully defended late soul godfather James Brown in a sexual assault case two years ago, was wearing TV make-up.\n\nFinally Virgie arrived, apparently praying as she tightly clasped hands with her larger than life legal lead John O'Quinn.\n\nAnna's father Don Hogan, who had not seen his daughter for 10 years before she died at a Florida hotel, was already in court.\n\nBy the time they were all present, 16 lawyers sat around four desks in the well.\n\nArmed police walked between the major players whenever they left the room. Aware of the barely concealed hatreds, Judge Larry Sieblin appealed: \"We want to respect the peace of Mrs Smith's body.\n\n\"But the most important matter is the welfare and stability of Dannielynn.\"\n\nHowever in a clearly theatrical gesture he asked Stern to write Dannielynn's name on a blackboard to signify her importance.\n\nRepeatedly burying his head in his hands, Stern set out to prove it was Anna's wish she be buried in the Bahamas next to her son Daniel, 20, who died of a drug overdose. She had a dress made to wear in her coffin.\n\nHe said: \"She always thought she was going to die young. She thought she was going to be a Marilyn Monroe.\"\n\nBizarrely, he claimed Anna had wanted to be buried with her son. He said: \"Physically she died two weeks ago but emotionally, she died when Daniel died. She wouldn't accept he'd gone.\"\n\nStern told the court how heartbroken Anna asked for Daniel's casket to be opened before he was buried.\n\nHe said: \"She was inconsolable, hugging and grabbing on to him. She said, 'I want to be buried with him'.\"\n\nVirgie's legal team claim she is next of kin. She wants to bury her daughter near her family in her native Texas. Stern says Anna did not want anything to do with Virgie and her relatives.\n\nHanging over the dramatic proceedings is the question of Dannielynn's paternity - and who inherits a potential #274million Anna was claiming from the estate of her late husband J Howard Marshall who died aged 89."
