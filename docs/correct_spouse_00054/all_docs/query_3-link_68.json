        "text": "Years before Anna Nicole Smith became a Playboy centerfold, reality star, and pop culture fascination, she was Vickie Lynn Hogan—a Texan single mother who was starting a new job at a Houston strip club. Hogan was naive, flat-chested, and physically awkward—she danced like “an emu trying to fly,” remembers a fellow dancer named Missy in Netflix’s new documentary Anna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me. Missy, who would go on to be Hogan’s lifelong friend, sometime lover, and witness to her celebrity transformation, took Hogan under her wing, teaching her about dancing and the new gig. But there were two subjects on which Hogan needed no education.\n\n“No one needed to give her any pointers on how to attract a man,” says Missy. “She knew what she was doing.” She also “didn’t need any help at manipulating anybody. She was better at it than me.”\n\nSuch is the complicated portrait of Smith that emerges in the Netflix documentary, directed by Ursula Macfarlane and available today. Macfarlane traces Smith’s hungry pursuit of the American dream, and reveals how Smith mythologized her own backstory to market herself—claiming she grew up in poverty and hijacking Missy’s own story of childhood abuse, Missy claims, to allege that her mother, Virgie Mae Hogan, mistreated her growing up. Multiple sources in the documentary claim that Smith’s family was not poor and that Virgie, a retired policewoman who died in 2018, was a sweet woman who loved Smith and, if anything, helped keep her out of trouble.\n\nIn a never-before-heard interview, Virgie claims her daughter told her point-blank why she was throwing her under the bus to the public: “I make more money telling sad stories than I make telling good stories,” she claims Smith told her. When Virgie asked Smith whether she wanted people to think good things about her, she says Smith replied, “Not if bad pays better.”\n\nIronically, Missy alleges in the documentary, Smith was later the victim of a horrific actual assault—one that was too painful to share with the public.\n\nSmith grew up not knowing her biological father, and blamed his absence on Virgie, according to the documentary. Like many fatherless children, she idealized her dad in her head—believing that he was thinking of her as much as she was of him. After Smith established herself in Hollywood—securing a contract with Guess Jeans and appearing multiple times in Playboy—she hired a private investigator to track down her father, and flew both him and her biological brother out to meet her in California.\n\nThe meeting took place around 1993, the same year Playboy named Smith Playmate of the Year. The Netflix documentary cuts to home movie footage of Smith, still coherent and bubbly in her mid-20s as she goes to meet her father, Donald Hogan, and brother, Donnie, at the airport. During that reunion in California, Smith brought both men to the Playboy mansion to attend the party Hugh Hefner threw in her honor, and to Disneyland for a family excursion with her young son, Daniel.\n\nBut Donald was not the caring father Smith had envisioned, Donnie explains in the film. “My father is not the type of guy you want to be alone with. You’re not going to feel safe,” he tells the camera—a warning he shared with Smith. Indeed, according to The Guardian, Donald, who died in 2009, pleaded guilty to raping Smith’s aunt when she was a child, as well as another underage girl, and spent six months in prison for the offenses. He was also accused of sexually abusing his other daughters, per The Guardian. It’s unclear whether Smith knew of her father’s crimes, but according to the Netflix documentary, Smith—who had been so excited about her reunion with her father—was uncharacteristically silent when he left California.\n\n“When we were alone [later], she told me her father had tried to have sex with her,” Missy says in the film. “It was really sad…because I know how happy she was when she met him. She had all of these ideas in her head of what he was like, and what it was going to be like, and then she was just so, so disappointed.”\n\nThough Macfarlane was unable to corroborate the claim with anyone else, she presents it to Smith’s biological brother Donnie on camera. Donnie’s stunned response—disbelief and denial before the slow acknowledgement that, “That would be like him…I wouldn’t put it past him…it could be true”—is damning.\n\nIn an interview with VF, Macfarlane says she was “blindsided” by the allegation. “We were shocked to discover that,” says Macfarlane. “But for me, it explained a lot as well. If you look at the timeline of her life, it’s after that moment that things start to unravel.”\n\nSeveral months after Smith’s alleged assault by her father, the model was rushed to the hospital after overdosing on pills.\n\n“I think it must have affected her,” says Macfarlane. “Everybody wants a father figure in their life. Everybody wants someone to look up to. And you can see in the archival footage, she was just so over the moon, delighted to see the dad that she hadn’t seen since she was a baby, that she’d never known. It just made me incredibly sad…. It was a devastating thing. It was a bombshell.”\n\n“She was searching for a father figure all her life,” says Macfarlane, pointing to Smith’s controversial marriage to J. H. Marshall, the 89-year-old oil billionaire Smith married when she was 26. “There was a father aspect to that relationship. It’s not in the film, but she said to somebody that he’s the only person who didn’t look down on her.”\n\nThough Smith would be painted as a gold digger after Marshall’s 1995 death—and during a protracted legal battle over his $1.6 billion estate—the documentary features friends of Smith’s who believed that the late model genuinely loved her six-decades-older husband. (The legal battle lasted over 15 years, with the Supreme Court ultimately deciding in 2011, four years after her death, that Smith’s estate should not get a penny from Marshall’s estate.)\n\nThe truth of that marriage, though, was complicated too. Home movies show a happy if nontraditional family. Friends describe genuine love, but also Smith maxing out Marshall’s credit card. Audio from Smith and Marshall’s phone calls sometimes depict a concerned husband desperately trying to reach his wife and a wife too tired or annoyed to answer his questions. Asked about the legitimacy of the relationship, Macfarlane says, “Love comes in many different shapes and forms. I came away thinking that she did love him and that he did love her. Now, does that mean that she also wasn’t greedy with him or maxing out his ATM card, as Missy says? I think those things are both true. People are able to hold these contradictions—yes, she loved him, but also was spending too much of his money. In terms of going to court, she felt he promised her half his money. Nobody knows exactly what he said. My view personally is that she probably should have gotten something.”\n\nIn the ’90s and aughts, Smith parlayed her court battles, drug addiction, and dramatic weight fluctuations into tabloid and paparazzi fame, and later an E! reality show. Often appearing dazed, Smith became a caricature of herself—culminating in nonsensical red-carpet interviews and stage appearances.\n\nMacfarlane says that some of Smith’s drug use can be traced to her breast-enhancement surgeries, after which Smith would be prescribed opiates to combat the pain. “She had a couple of implants that got infected or imploded—it was a sort of running thing throughout her life,” says the filmmaker, who interviewed a doctor who treated Smith, Sandeep Kapoor, about her chronic pain. “She had a lot of different kinds of pain—back pain. I don’t think anybody really knew, but hours before she’d go on a red carpet, she was filling herself up with painkillers,” says Macfarlane. (Kapoor, who wrote a 2017 memoir called Trust Me, I’m a Doctor: My Life Before, During and After Anna Nicole Smith, was acquitted of felony drug conspiracy charges stemming from Smith’s 2007 death.)\n\nIn Smith’s final years, her life spun out of her control. “She was living in a very tricky time with the 24-hour news cycle, the tabloid newspapers, and she was kind of in a tailspin of, ‘How do I deal with this, set my own agenda, and take control of the narrative?’” says Macfarlane. She was deeply hurt by the criticism about her weight, and—though she believed bad news was good for paydays—found herself constantly being pummeled by paparazzi and media. “She was on this roller-coaster roundabout that she probably wanted to get off and found that she couldn’t.”\n\nMacfarlane interviews Bonnie Gayle, sister of Smith’s longtime lawyer Howard K. Stern, who speaks about Smith’s struggles with weight and body image. (“Her weight swings were not just about greed or drugs,” says Macfarlane, referencing the weight gains that led to Smith’s TrimSpa partnership. “They were someone who was suffering with eating disorders, which is obviously psychological pain.”) Macfarlane spoke to but ultimately did not end up interviewing Larry Birkhead, the father of Smith’s daughter, Dannielyn, because “he set some conditions that we couldn’t meet.” The filmmaker also spoke to Smith’s bodyguard, Maurice “BigMoe” Brighthaupt, who discusses Smith’s final tragic days in the documentary.\n\nIn September 2006, Smith was finally out of the Los Angeles paparazzi nest and in the Bahamas to give birth to her daughter Dannielynn. (Smith chose the Bahamas in part, the documentary claims, because she wanted Birkhead out of the picture, and as the film explains, Bahamian law stipulates that whoever signs a child’s birth certificate is the child’s legal father. Stern signed Dannielynn’s birth certificate. After Smith’s death, a DNA test determined Birkhead was Dannielynn’s father and Stern said he wouldn’t fight Birkhead for custody.) Three days after giving birth to Dannielynn, Smith’s 20-year-old son Daniel died in the hospital where he was visiting his mother and sister. An autopsy later revealed that the death was the accidental result of the interaction of antidepressants and methadone, the same opioid his mother took.\n\nThe death devastated Smith. “Going to the Bahamas was a big decision of Smith’s, in part to get away from [the tabloid chaos], which is why it’s so doubly tragic that Danny came over to see his baby sister and died,” says Macfarlane. “After he died, she kept saying, ‘Why didn’t they take me? They should’ve taken me, not him.’” Macfarlane says that Smith needed drugs to numb herself from the tremendous pain of her grief: “I think she couldn’t live after that, despite her beautiful baby daughter. After Daniel died, she just wanted to be sedated.”\n\nFour months after Daniel’s death, Smith died of an accidental prescription drug overdose, with a medical examiner finding traces of substances including muscle relaxants, methadone, several antianxiety medicines, and the potent sedative chloral hydrate in her system. Macfarlane does not think that, after Daniel’s overdose, anyone could have stopped Smith from dying: “She was taking too many drugs and I think nobody could reach her.”"
