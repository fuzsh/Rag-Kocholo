And if you need more proof, see what happens when you hop in bed with your 'pal.' If you acknowledge what happened and maintain an open, honest line of communication, you should be able to salvage this relationship.\n\nwhat has this world come to when my greatest escape comes in a newly unfurled obsession with the works of sebastian stan. between sillily wicked carter baizen on \"gossip girl,\" the oddly homoerotic chase collins in \"the covenant,\" and now, the intensely closeted prince jack benjamin in \"kings\" to which i've become addicted on hulu.com. why does this represent such watershed moment? well, generally, i'd find myself taken with my newly blossoming social life -- which has truly kept me away from livejournal in any real way as i always said it does when its good -- my tumultuous professional life -- which has again brought me to the brink of sanity -- and my political obsessions -- which have folded more excitement into my life than seeing a woman in a new balmain jacket. let's start with vermont because it really begins and ends with vermont: as i referenced in my post talking about the new balmain and the seventeenth amendment, if our united states senators found themselves subject to the will of the state legislatures, i doubt we'd have these silly battles over social issues at all, but now, marriage equality has finally has a state where the people's representatives have voted into law these reforms and not the courts. we almost had it in california, but we got obstructed by the governor of that state, thrown a bone by the courts, and a blow by a too-loose constitutional amendment process. now, i've said that there's something about a republican executive and an overwhelmingly democratic legislature that tends to serve up these marriage equality victories: first, massachusetts (\"goodridge v. department of public health,\" november 18, 2003), then, california (\"in re: marriage cases,\" may 15, 2008), connecticut (\"kerrigan v. commissioner of public health,\" october 10, 2008), and now, the exception, iowa (\"varnum v. brien,\" april 3, 2009). so yeah, exciting times and i know we're going to see a lot more full faith and creditchallenges coming to the fore as these laws solidify into our legal framework as a country. what next? oh yeah, my crazy social life: how i manage to still have one after expanding my availability at pier one continues to baffle me not to mention where i find the money, energy, or willpower to make an effort at work at having one, but last friday, i had to work at both jobs and i thought i looked woefully cute in this j.crew pima cotton polo and these banana republic almost-pajama pants, but planned, nonetheless, to come home and read that article on alex rodriguez that has caused so much of a stir because of some perceived homoeroticism -- is autoeroticism really the same thing as homoeroticism?! -- but i resolved to drop by the only bar in town to give my high school friend the money for the kathy griffin tickets. well. i stayed for a drink -- and the most horrible cabaret act possible -- and somehow got convinced to go to z grille and three rounds later, i'm changing clothes, popping in my contacts, and heading to nautico which is quickly replacing the only bar in town as the only other bar in town and needless to say, witnessed the best cabaret show and proceeded to get spinning drunk and when i stopped spinning found myself at an afterhours party with one couple, two singles, my high school friend, an out-of-drag drag queen, and an odd punky girl thrown in for good measure. well, hours passed with me drinking the grey goose bottle dry and then working on miscellaneous cocktail when my high school friend came out of the bedroom tapping his nose in a way i haven't seen since 2002. i mean, how unsubtle can one be in a party?! well, the couple had left and the two singles had disappeared into the bedroom with my high school friend ages ago and when i went in to the bathroom with one of the singles, that's when it began. it started as forced intimacy to keep the party going but quickly became a blowjob which quickly becamea shared blowjob between both of these singles and somehow -- though we NEVER touched -- and then my high school friend. eventually, the drag queen out of drag crashed and the girl powdered her nose and drove home, but it became the most debaucherous night out i've had in sometime as the party's host and i proceeded to engage in sexual acts all around the house from the living room to the kitchen to the pool to the office to the dining room and back to the living room. my high school friend and the host's friend fell asleep in the bedroom so we camped out in the office until we couldn't keep our eyes open anymore and after my friend crashed for a bit and went home, i moved into the bed with the host of the party and the friend with whom my high school friend. yeah. awkward night. i have never been so drunk/high/horny/uninhibited since i've lived down here. it was scary/thrilling/worrying/emboldening. the next morning, i got driven home and literally slept ALL DAY until six thirty in the evening which means that my high school friend and i had to race to the kathy griffin show. yeah. i cried with laughter and after the show we went to ocean prime -- where we stood inches away from the hogan family (hulk, brooke, and nick) -- and then ate their food which was divine. we then went to christopher street, but that was a dud so i got driven home. so yeah. this has been the year of the livewire. i don't know what's going on with me since that hookup after my birthday. it's like i'm insatiable. while the first week started with its normal drabness, by tuesday, i felt really sick so i called off and thought i'd recover by wednesday, but still couldn't manage it and called off both places. while i went to work on thursday (and drove with the exsomeone up to zephyrhills) and friday, i didn't do anything all weekend because i felt so under the weather. a part of me thinks that my party wasn't as good as expected and that my allergy toward certain substances evidenced itself with my sickness those two days. by the next week, i found myself back in true form although i have NEVER felt my job in danger as much as i did that week. i'll get into that more later. and one of these days, i actually fucked the exsomeone but now i can't remember which day: it's either the monday before (which feels right) or the next week. the significant part about that encounter wasn't the actual fucking which wasn't altogether that pleasant to be honest except for the actual fact of it, but afterward, i don't know what it was, but lying their naked cuddling with the exsomeone -- and getting naked bas been quite the fetishistic and exhibitionist leitmotif of my sexual encounters lately -- the exsomeone kept wrapping legs around me trying to get me to stay over which caused one or two bubbles of feeling accidentally escape to the surface. needless to say, the exsomeone went on spring break later that week to ohio so yeah, that didn't last and has hosted company since returning to town.\n\nHere is your single's love horoscope\n\nfor Sunday, March 29:\n\nIt's a time of rediscovery and seeking the truth about yourself. If your life seems difficult in any way, that's an indication you're not living it in accord with your true essence. Get back to the basics -- what are your basic motivations? Build a new perspective on that information.\n\nbut last tuesday, after a particularly tough day at work, i went to ceviche and had a three martini late night dinner with red snapper and scallops and eventually wound up on that regrettable site again but this time with less regrettable results except for the fact that this result did not arrive at my doorstep until 1:30 in the morning. yeah, after i ejaculated three times and sent the result on its way, i somehow felt drunk enough to send a text message to the stock broker who immediately answered back giving me a virtual pat on the back for my exploits. we texted all the next day but nothing developed of that. on wednesday night, i slept throughly. on thursday night, after work, i had determined that my serach result had begun to stalk me almost so i went over to the p.r. girl's house to have a fun night in with a couple of bottles of champagne. on friday night, i went to a mixer for black young professionals at the venue where i slurped up three splits of piper (and finding myself wildly attracted to someone i met through tampa organization of black affairs who clearly was not that into me but one of those people who likes to be the center of attention at all costs) before going to z grille with my high school friend, getting drunk on grey goose and sweet spicy jumbo shrimp they do so well there, and then went to nautico, but nothing scandolous (outside of me being too drunk for my own good and dancing my ass off). that basically wraps up my social recall besides the fact that i've posted an ad on craigslist for a new girlfriend since the p.r. girl is too broke to ever do anything and rarely likes going downtown, my bubbly pier one coworker isn't a good fit (as she's a little too old and pure), and my two good girlfriends live in manhattan and ft. lauderdale. so. now, i've been on pins and needles at job number one because my sales have been so low and for the first time in my tenure in my department, i've been questioned as to when i come in which is always a sure sign that the shit has hit the fan. i'm given relative autonomy as long as business is good, but now that business has dried up, all eyes are on me and i can't stand the amount of closed door meetings where I KNOW my name has come up in a negative context. but that's been mollified by this week where i've proven my worth by making so many sales happen that i've done the business of two desks in the span of seven days. so yeah. at pier one, i got formally written up for tagging pillows wrong for a sale. this is my life. pillows. well, it's now three o clock in the morning and i have to be at pier one at nine o clock tomorrow morning (which is actually refreshingly late for me) and then work at the main job and then i have an HRC social for the remainder.\n\nBiography for\n\nSebastian Stan More at IMDbPro »\n\nadvertisementDate of Birth\n\n13 August 1983, Constanta, Romania\n\nNickname\n\nSebs\n\nBaz\n\nHeight\n\n5' 10¾\" (1.80 m)\n\nTrivia\n\nIs still in contact and close friends with his co-stars Toby Hemingway and Chace Crawford from The Covenant (2006).\n\nIs a Romanian-American.\n\nHe is an only child.\n\nMoved from Romania to Vienna, Austria at age 8 with his mother who was employed as a pianist.\n\nMoved to Rockland County, New York at age 12 when his mother married the Headmaster of an American private school.\n\nGraduated from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey with a BFA in Acting.\n\nAttended the famous performing arts summer camp Stagedoor Manor.\n\nActress Leighton Meester is his girlfriend [2008].\n\nDid all his own stunts in the movie 'The Covenant'.\n\nEngaged to girlfriend Leighton Meester.\n\nPersonal Quotes\n\n\"To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.\"\n\n\"It was like a huge master class every day in rehearsal with [director] Bob Falls and [star] Liev Schreiber.

It's ripped from the Biblical story of King David and Jonathan, son of Saul. It's been long debated whether the pair had an intimate relationship, and what that means for gay people. We expect the debate over what Jack's flawed queer character on Kings will mean for gay people will be equally intense, but perhaps not for as long. [Defamer, AfterElton]\n\nBy: Chris Rovzar\n\nFiled Under: hellivision, gays, sebastian stan, the bible\n\n###\n\n“Kings” Warps the Story of David and Jonathan\n\nby Brent Hartinger\n\nMarch 16, 2009\n\nThis article contains major plot points from Sunday night's episode of Kings, as well as minor spoilers for the next two episodes.\n\nThe new NBC show Kings that premiered last night in a two-hour movie is supposedly a modern-day retelling of the Biblical story of David. Sure enough, the main character defeats “Goliath” – which, in the case of Kings, happens to be a tank.\n\nAnd the character of Jack, the prince and “true” heir to the throne that David is destined for, is gay – just as his biblical counter-part, Jonathan, probably was.\n\nBut that’s just about the only gay element that Kings gets right.\n\nIn the Bible, Jonathan definitely loves David – and it’s literally love at first sight. “When David had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was bound to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul,” says the Bible’s Book of Samuel of Jonathan and David’s first meeting.\n\nLater, Jonathan is a strong ally of David. He’s the one who warns David that King Saul is plotting to kill him, because Jonathan “took great delight in David.” Even though he’s the actual heir to the throne, Jonathan recognizes that David is the true king, chosen by God.\n\nBut in Kings, Jack is mostly a villain – and a pretty stereotypically gay one at that: pretty and perfectly groomed, self-centered and vain, bitter and entitled, scheming, yet ultimately cowardly.\n\nIt’s familiar gay ground, in movies such as such as Cruel Intentions and in virtually every vampire movie ever made. Indeed, the actor who plays Kings’ gay prince, Sebastian Stan, even played a similar role before, in the 2006 film The Covenant.\n\nIn the first four episodes made available to AfterElton.com for preview by NBC, Jack isn’t an ally of David’s; instead he repeatedly tries to undermine him. And he does all this in his scheming, mostly cowardly way.\n\nHe’s a rich, complicated character, but he’s still a bad guy, the “dark” entitled prince up against the “light” chosen prince, competing for the affections of the current king: think Val Kilmer’s “Iceman” in Top Gun versus Tom Cruise’s “Maverick.”\n\nIan McShane (left) as King Silas and Christopher Egan as David\n\nIn addition, while there are several hints that Jack might be attracted to David, he seems to be motivated not by love, but by jealousy because David loves his sister, the princess, and not him.\n\nBut by far the biggest difference between Kings and its Biblical source material is the fact that in the Bible, David is probably gay or bisexual too, and he loves Jonathan back.\n\n“David rose from beside the stone heap and prostrated himself with his face to the ground,” the Bible reads. “He bowed three times, and [he and Jonathan] kissed each other, and wept with each other. David wept the more.”\n\nWhen Jonathan is killed, David mourns him, saying, \"I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; greatly beloved were you to me; your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.\"\n\nWhether or not David and Jonathan were actual lovers is the subject of debate, but many scholars interpret the relationship to have been a romantic one. Indeed, unless you’re blinded by anti-gay prejudice, it’s almost impossible not to see it as such.\n\nIn short, the biblical chronicle of David and Jonathan is one of the Bible’s few gay love stories. It’s also one of very few positive gay elements in the entire notoriously homophobic Bible.\n\nDespite Kings’ claims that it is a “retelling” of David’s story, a gay love story is clearly not the direction the show is going. In the show, Jack may yet express his open love for David, and might even assist him somehow. But it seems pretty clear that David is thoroughly heterosexual and will almost certainly never love Jack back.\n\nIn other words, Michael Green, the creator of Kings, has chosen to keep the Bible’s likely-gay aspect of the character of Jonathan, but then turned him into a scheming villain, while at the same time, completely eliminating any “gay” element to the story’s primary hero, David.\n\nIt’s part of a long history where characters based on gay figures from history or legend – people such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Achilles, Gilgamesh, Alexander the Great, and the ancient Spartan warriors – are “de-gayed” for movie or TV adaptations. In addition, Hollywood has a history of turning gay characters from fiction into heterosexual ones for the film versions, in projects such as Fried Green Tomatoes, and the plays of Tennessee Williams.\n\n“I think what you might be concerned about, or what your readership might be concerned about is that we’re playing into the cliché that the straight guy is great and the gay guy is evil,\" Michael Green, Kings' creator, tells AfterElton.com in an interview in response to this essay. \"I don’t think we fall into that cliché at all. I think if you give us your time and attention, you’ll be very surprised at what both of those characters are capable of in the positive and in the negative sense. No one in our show is clearly good. No one in our show is clearly evil. They have far, far different journeys to go on.\"\n\nGreen admits that the character of Jack's homosexuality was inspired by the interpretation that the biblical character was also gay, but promises that the character is no cartoon villain.\n\n\"My goals are to take my characters and put them in the most interesting situation and then see how they behave, so I can’t give Jack any special protection because he’s gay or straight,\" he says. \"I think that would be the more backwards way of looking at it. There are times [Jack] does incredibly noble things. There are times he does incredibly shitty things. And he is a character, and this season perhaps more than any other, who is struggling between his better and lesser angels, or his angels and demons, if you will. And a lot of that has to do with the world he was brought up in. I am much more interested in Jack as a character who, if he had been brought up in a kinder family, might have been a kinder person. He might have been a happier person. But he was born into a family where the presumption is that power is an inherent good that you must want more of, and that colors his personality far more than his preferences.\"\n\nRead the entire interview with Michael Green here.\n\nThere's no denying that Jack is an interesting, multi-dimensional character. But in the first four episodes at least, David is very clearly the hero, and Jack is just as clearly his adversary, and pretty vicious to boot. Meanwhile, while Jack is gay, David is not.\n\nKings is a great show, and these may even be great storylines. But as in so many other retellings, Kings is almost the complete opposite of its historical source, the Bible, at least when it comes to the gay parts.\n\nCopyright © 2006 AfterElton.com\n\n###\n\nApril 9, 2009\n\nOp-Ed Contributor\n\nIowa’s Family Values\n\nBy STEVEN W. THRASHER\n\nIF it weren’t for Iowa, my family may never have existed, and this gay, biracial New Yorker might never have been born.\n\nIn 1958, when my mother, who was white, and father, who was black, wanted to get married in Nebraska, it was illegal for them to wed. So they decided to go next door to Iowa, a state that was progressive enough to allow interracial marriage. My mom’s brother tried to have the Nebraska state police bar her from leaving the state so she couldn’t marry my dad, which was only the latest legal indignity she had endured. She had been arrested on my parents’ first date, accused of prostitution. (The conventional thought of the time being: Why else would a white woman be seen with a black man?)\n\nOn their wedding day, somehow, my parents made it out of Nebraska without getting arrested again, and were wed in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on March 1, 1958. This was five years before Nebraska would strike down its laws against interracial marriage, and almost a decade before the Supreme Court would outlaw miscegenation laws throughout the country in Loving v. Virginia.\n\nWhen the good state of Iowa conferred the dignity of civic recognition on my parents’ relationship — a relationship some members of their own families thought was deviant and immoral, that the civil authorities of Nebraska had tried to destroy, and that even some of my mom’s college-educated friends believed would produce children striped like zebras — our family began. And by the time my father died, their interracial marriage was seen just as a marriage, and an admirable 45-year one at that.\n\nThat I almost cried last week upon reading that the Iowa Supreme Court overturned the state law banning same-sex marriage will therefore come as no surprise. I’m still struck by one thought: over the years, I’ve met so many gay émigrés who felt it was unsafe to be gay in so-called flyover country and fled for the East and West coasts. But as a gay man, I can’t marry in “liberal” New York, where I’m a resident, or in “liberal” California, where I was born, and very soon I will have that right in “conservative” Iowa.\n\nOf course, the desire to define relational rights and responsibilities with a partner, to have access to the protection that this kind of commitment affords, is rather conservative. But it’s a conservative dream that should be offered to all Americans. Though it takes great courage for gays to marry in a handful of states now, one hopes that someday, throughout the nation, gay marriages, like my parents’ union, will just be seen as marriages.\n\nIt’s safe to say that neither the dramas of our family, nor its triumphs, could have been possible without the simultaneously radical and conservative occasion of my parents’ civil marriage in Iowa. And so when the time comes, I hope to be married at the City Hall in Council Bluffs, in the state that not only supports my civil rights now, but which supported my parents’ so many years ago.\n\nSteven W. Thrasher is a writer and media producer.\n\nCopyright 2009 The New York Times Company\n\n###\n\nPretty amazing statement from Iowa House & Senate leaders\n\nBy Jennifer Vanasco 04.03.2009 1:46pm EDT\n\nNews & Politics\n\nA statement released today on gay marriage from Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal and House Speaker Pat Murphy (thanks to Evan Wolfson from Freedom to Marry for the tip).\n\nIowa continues to be a leader in guaranteeing civil rights\n\nThis is a joint statement from Iowa Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal and Iowa House Speaker Pat Murphy on today’s Supreme Court decision:\n\n“Thanks to today’s decision, Iowa continues to be a leader in guaranteeing all of our citizens’ equal rights.\n\n“The court has ruled today that when two Iowans promise to share their lives together, state law will respect that commitment, regardless of whether the couple is gay or straight.\n\n“When all is said and done, we believe the only lasting question about today’s events will be why it took us so long. It is a tough question to answer because treating everyone fairly is really a matter of Iowa common sense and Iowa common decency.\n\n“Today, the Iowa Supreme Court has reaffirmed those Iowa values by ruling that gay and lesbian Iowans have all the same rights and responsibilities of citizenship as any other Iowan.\n\n“Iowa has always been a leader in the area of civil rights.\n\n“In 1839, the Iowa Supreme Court rejected slavery in a decision that found that a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years before the end of the Civil War decided the issue.\n\n“In 1868, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that racially segregated “separate but equal” schools had no place in Iowa, 85 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.\n\n“In 1873, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled against racial discrimination in public accommodations, 91 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.\n\n“In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law.\n\n“In the case of recognizing loving relationships between two adults, the Iowa Supreme Court is once again taking a leadership position on civil rights.\n\n“Today, we congratulate the thousands of Iowans who now can express their love for each other and have it recognized by our laws.”\n\n###\n\nVermont Legalizes Gay Marriage With Veto Override\n\n04-07-2009\n\nVermont has become the fourth state to legalize gay marriage -- and the first to do so with a legislature's vote.\n\nThe Legislature voted Tuesday to override Gov. Jim Douglas' veto of a bill allowing gays and lesbians to marry. The vote was 23-5 to override in the state Senate and 100-49 to override in the House. Under Vermont law, two-thirds of each chamber had to vote for override.\n\nThe vote came nine years after Vermont adopted its first-in-the-nation civil unions law.\n\nIt's now the fourth state to permit same-sex marriage. Massachusetts, Connecticut and Iowa are the others. Their approval of gay marriage came from the courts.\n\nCopyright 2009 Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Now gays really, legitimately, democratically and completely non-sneakily have won the right to marry, in Vermont. Next thing you know gays preparing to wed will be everywhere, threatening our way of life by picking out china patterns in Bloomingdale's and bickering about where to seat Uncle Floyd at the reception.\n\nNews stories about the Vermont decision implicitly recognize that this one really counts, by emphasizing the fact that this is the first state to approve gay marriage through a legislature rather than impose it from the bench, where judges pretend the right has been there all along without previously being detected. Vermont has made the change the proper way, and it ought to be congratulated.\n\nThose who chafe at the decision -- and the passage of Prop. 8 in California, which Obama carried by 24 points, suggests that the opposition is hardly limited to Republicans -- should reexamine their arguments.\n\nDoes the Bible forbid gay relationships? Maybe. But if God didn't want there to be gay people, He shouldn't have made them. Who seriously believes that being gay is any more of a choice than being black?\n\nBesides, not even the most fervent Christian would want to live in a Biblocracy. Covet your neighbor's wife, or even his kitchen appliances, and go to jail? If that were government policy, how many informers would it need on the payroll to monitor the neighbors' comments about saucy Serena (or her Sub-Zero?) Does God's idea of civilization look like East Berlin in 1981?\n\nThe Bible is about you and your soul, and if you think your neighbor is going to hell you can't stop him. And if you think gay relationships are immoral, surely it's the physical act that bothers you, not the signing of licenses, not the public vows of love and fidelity, not the matching tuxedos. Not the smiling faces. Yet few will make the case for police investigations of what people do between the sheets.\n\n\"Same-sex marriage,\" wrote Maggie Gallagher in National Review, \"asks religious Americans,\" by which she means Christian Americans, \"to surrender a core belief -- not only Leviticus (disapproval of gay sexual acts), but Genesis (the idea that God himself made man as male and female and commanded men and women to come together in a special way to image the fruitfulness of God).\" But Christians are surrendering nothing. They remain free to disapprove of homosexuality just as they remain free to disapprove of their neighbor's alcoholism or adultery or bad taste in lawn ornaments. They also remain free to move to a country that enforces religious views.\n\nIf marriages that can't produce children by the traditional method ought to be illegal, then half my straight friends' marriages would never have taken place. This offends me on a personal level, because I would have been deprived of a lot of free Champagne and several choice opportunities to dance the horah. Since when is there a fertility test to marriage? Moreover, gay couples can and do produce children who would not otherwise have existed, with the participation of one or both partners (Molly's egg, meet Julie's womb).\n\nThose who say that gay marriage just isn't popular should take note of Vermont's unusually muscular notion of representative government. As the Gay Patriot blog notes, Vermont has so few residents and so many elected representatives -- its lower house has nearly twice as many lawmakers as California's -- that there's practically no boundary between the people and the politicians, who anyway legislate only part-time and live in such a small state that they spend most of their time home with their constituents.\n\nAs older generations are replaced by young voters, acceptance of gay marriage will become the norm. Opponents will seem marginal, perhaps even despicable. An Iowa poll released this month put statewide support for gay marriage at 36% -- but nearly 60% among voters under 30.\n\nConservatives who are in favor of more children being born into and raised by two-parent families, social mechanisms to limit promiscuity, decentralized political decision-making and the supremacy of lawmakers rather than judges in non-Constitutional matters have much to cheer in Vermont. Gay-marriage opponents should ask themselves whether their reasoning is something else in disguise.\n\nKyle.Smith@nypost.com\n\nCopyright 2009 NYP Holdings, Inc.

However, the old law stopped short of calling them marriages, which gay rights activists said was discriminatory.\n\nIt will still be up to individual churches to decide if they want to wed gay couples.\n\nSwedish news agency TT says the 349-seat legislature passed the measure in 261-22 vote, with 66 lawmakers abstaining or absent.\n\n###\n\nHome » World » Europe\n\nChurch of Sweden ok's gay weddings\n\nhttp://bigpondnews.com/articles/World/2009/10/23/Church_of_Sweden_oks_gay_weddings_385845.html\n\nFriday, October 23, 2009 » 02:36am\n\nThe Church of Sweden will allow its priests to wed same-sex couples in new gender-neutral church ceremonies in a 176-62 church board vote.\n\nEleven members abstained and two were absent.\n\nIn May, Sweden introduced a new law giving gay couples the same marriage rights as heterosexuals.\n\nBut the clergy has been split on the issue, with some arguing the church ceremony should be reserved for male-female couples.\n\nSame-sex church weddings will start on November 1.\n\n###\n\nSources: US to sign UN gay rights declaration\n\nBy MATTHEW LEE, Associated Press Writer Matthew Lee, Associated Press Writer\n\nWed Mar 18, 12:28 am ET\n\nWASHINGTON – The Obama administration will endorse a U.N. declaration calling for the worldwide decriminalization of homosexuality that then-President George W. Bush had refused to sign, The Associated Press has learned.\n\nU.S. officials said Tuesday they had notified the declaration's French sponsors that the administration wants to be added as a supporter. The Bush administration was criticized in December when it was the only western government that refused to sign on.\n\nThe move was made after an interagency review of the Bush administration's position on the nonbinding document, which was signed by all 27 European Union members as well as Japan, Australia, Mexico and three dozen other countries, the officials said.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because Congress was still being notified of the decision. They said the administration had decided to sign the declaration to demonstrate that the United States supports human rights for all.\n\n\"The United States is an outspoken defender of human rights and critic of human rights abuses around the world,\" said one official.\n\n\"As such, we join with the other supporters of this statement and we will continue to remind countries of the importance of respecting the human rights of all people in all appropriate international fora,\" the official said.\n\nThe official added that the United States was concerned about \"violence and human rights abuses against gay, lesbian, transsexual and bisexual individuals\" and was also \"troubled by the criminalization of sexual orientation in many countries.\"\n\n\"In the words of the United States Supreme Court, the right to be free from criminalization on the basis of sexual orientation 'has been accepted as an integral part of human freedom',\" the official said.\n\nGay rights and other groups had criticized the Bush administration when it refused to sign the declaration when it was presented at the United Nations on Dec. 19. U.S. officials said then that the U.S. opposed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation but that parts of the declaration raised legal questions that needed further review.\n\nAccording to negotiators, the Bush team had concerns that those parts could commit the federal government on matters that fall under state jurisdiction. In some states, landlords and private employers are allowed to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation; on the federal level, gays are not allowed to serve openly in the military.\n\nIt was not immediately clear on Tuesday how the Obama administration had come to a different conclusion.\n\nWhen it was voted on in December, 66 of the U.N.'s 192 member countries signed the declaration — which backers called a historic step to push the General Assembly to deal more forthrightly with anti-gay discrimination.\n\nBut 70 U.N. members outlaw homosexuality — and in several, homosexual acts can be punished by execution. More than 50 nations, including members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, opposed the declaration.\n\nSome Islamic countries said at the time that protecting sexual orientation could lead to \"the social normalization and possibly the legalization of deplorable acts\" such as pedophilia and incest. The declaration was also opposed by the Vatican.\n\nCopyright © 2009 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Stern against former MSNBC host Rita Cosby.\n\nSend / ShareAdd CommentIn her book, “Blonde Ambition: The Untold Story Behind Anna Nicole Smith’s Death,” Cosby claimed Stern, Anna Nicole Smith’s lawyer and boyfriend, had a sexual encounter with Larry Birkhead, Smith’s former boyfriend.\n\nCosby quoted two former nannies as confirmation, but both women later said they made no such claims.\n\nIn 2007, after the book was published, Stern filed suit claiming that Cosby, in calling him gay, was being defamatory and as a result he was entitled to collect damages.\n\nThis week Lambda Legal filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York arguing that Stern’s claims of defamation rest on the flawed premise that being called gay would expose someone to public hatred and shame.\n\nLambda argued that the premise is disproved daily throughout New York, including through the service of New York’s many openly gay and lesbian public officials.\n\nValidation of this type of defamation claim, and its underlying premise, would have a demeaning effect toward gay men and lesbians, similar to the effect caused by state sodomy laws before they were struck down by the US Supreme Court in 2003 in Lawrence v. Texas the amicus brief stated.\n\n“Saying that someone is gay is not an insult. Being identified as gay is neither bad nor shameful — in life and under the law,” said Thomas W.

Multiple Gossip Girl insiders confirm to me exclusively that the CW phenom is currently shooting an episode for its upcoming third season in which Ed Westwick’s legendary lothario kisses another man.\n\nSo who’s the lucky guy? And what are the circumstances surrounding the same-sex smooch? Keep reading for all the spoilery details…\n\nFirst things first: Sorry to disappoint, but no, it’s not Chace Crawford. Westwick’s “romantic” interest is up-and-comer Neal Bledsoe (CSI: NY, Guiding Light), who’s guest-starring in episode 6 as Josh Ellis, NYU’s head of freshman affairs. Since Josh is tasked with selecting an incoming student for the honor of delivering the freshman speech, he’s, shall we say, a person of interest to Blair. In fact, she’s so determined to snag the slot that she goes so far as to pimp out her boyfriend to the gay guy in charge.\n\nThe catch? All you need to know is there is one. Oh, and wait until you hear what Chuck says to Blair following the lip-lock. (Must. Resist. Temptation. To.

But the main characters at the cocktail to fête the arrival of Burberry Prorsum's Spring menswear collection were all a bit busy last night too. Host Ed Westwick was shooting scenes for Gossip Girl a few blocks away for most of the day and had to pop into the event in between kissing scenes with Leighton Meester. \"I watched a bit of the show back home,\" said Bailey. \"And Ed is really a nice guy and impressive actor, even if he's a bit naughty as Chuck.\"\n\nGuests like Mary-Kate Olsen, Leigh Lezark, Max Minghella, Zanna Roberts, Poppy Delevigne, Ingrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Claire Bernard and Dani Stahl all came by to greet Bailey and listen to DJ Nate Lowman's musical masterminds. \"My necklace sounds like a flock of reindeers,\" pointed out Stahl as she jiggled her Burberry accessory to the music. Bailey, meanwhile happily discussed gardening as one of the inspirations for his Spring line. \"I have a house in Yorkshire where I garden,\" the Brit said with a smile. \"I'm going there in a few weekends and I honesty love soil and digging. I love gardening when it involves expansion of energy.\"\n\nJamie Burke meanwhile discussed his own agricultural potential. \"I used to live on a farm when I was a little kid, so I grew things here and there,\" said the musician who's heading to South by Southwest with his new band this week. \"But Chris is really one of the essential English designers but we Brits don't all know each other. So I came by to finally meet him.\" Simon Doonan, meanwhile professed his love for Bailey too, not for his birthplace. \"I left England so long ago so I don't fetishize my homeland as much,\" he said. \"Though Chris has done it brilliantly, of course. But I've been on this side of the pond for 40 years!\"\n\nVALENTINE UHOVSKI\n\nEd Westwick at the Knicks Game: Gay or European?\n\nhttp://nymag.com/daily/intel/2009/03/ed_westwick_at_the_knicks_game.html?mid=daily-intel--20090317\n\n3/17/09 at 1:40 PM\n\nWe've been seeing this picture floating around the Internet all week, and the other day, while on a plane, we saw it in In Touch. The celebrity weekly did everything in its power not to call Ed Westwick gay, but they came close. \"Ed's girlfriend and co-star Jessica Szohr was noticeably absent,\" they observe. \"But fans shouldn't be worried about his 'bromance breakup' with Chace [Crawford], says an insider. 'That will never be over — they're both too needy!'\"\n\nLet's be clear: We don't think Ed Westwick is gay. We've met him in person and he oozes dudeness, and plus, one of our girlfriends totally hooked up with him. (As did, we occasionally suspect, Intel commenter Sarcastic Meow.) But there is something so bizarre about this picture! So we polled all of our friends who are both gay and European to see whether they think Ed is just acting out his naturally British impulses with this mystery man, or acting out impulses of another kind.\n\nTHEIR LIPS ARE PRACTICALLY TOUCHING!\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nUnfortunately, our experts were split. \"Either he's insanely gay, or is just out of Italian Gigolo boot camp and finding it hard to brush off the skills he was taught,\" fashion and travel writer Mark Ellwood opined. \"They are at a Knicks game ... so I'm thinking European, not Gay,\" mused Nike Communications' Peter Malachi. And Nick Denton, who is not one to hold back from gay speculation, firmly declared the situation \"European\" nonetheless.
