        "text": "A US judge has rejected a final bid by the estate of former Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith, challenging the will of her late husband J Howard Marshall.\n\nSmith, who died seven years ago, married the Texas billionaire in 1994 when he was 89 and she was 26.\n\nHe died the next year, leaving his $1.6bn (Â£960m) estate to his son and nothing to Smith, which she challenged.\n\nA judge has now halted efforts by lawyers acting on behalf of Smith's daughter to obtain $44m (Â£26.5m).\n\nAfter oil tycoon Marshall's death, reality TV star Smith - using her real name Vickie Lynn Marshall - filed legal papers claiming he had promised to leave her more than $300m (Â£181m) in his will.\n\nDuring the past two decades many attempts have been made to overturn the will, including the Texas bankruptcy court and US Supreme Court.\n\nA Houston jury previously ruled Marshall was mentally fit and under no undue pressure when he wrote his will, leaving his fortune to his son E Pierce Marshall - who himself died in 2006.\n\nEfforts continued after Smith died of an accidental drug overdose in February 2007, with lawyers representing her seven-year-old daughter Dannielynn, who lives with her father Larry Birkhead."
