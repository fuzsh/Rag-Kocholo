        "text": "r17 I read that in Bill Burr's voice. It's probably a combo of both--yes, she's a gold digging whoo-ah, but she was also manipulated by the people around her. The culture wasn't kind, either. And in fairness to her, that's a two-way street. He wasn't with her for her intellect or compatibility. I view it as a business transaction where both sides were using the other.\n\nRe: the actual tweet, I don't think it's accurate. But, it's not something a younger gen would understand, because they don't have contemporary context. I don't mean that in a cunty eldergay way; a lot of the youth culture aspects I didn't (and wouldn't) understand without context, either. The whole she's so unique is bullshit. It's a dime a dozen, it's just better disguised. I'd argue Megan Fox is similar, and did a much better job of it-minus the billionaire\n\nKudos to Craig Ferguson who called out the media/fame aspect in his Britney monologue.\n\nShe was the gold digging whore to end all gold digging whores. Married a feeble, ancient rich coot to get ahold of his money. Some say she deserved his money for sleeping with him but it's debatable that ever ever did sleep with him. After their marriage she flew off with some other guy (one of her bodyguards I think), leaving the poor old rich coot in tears. After his death, she sued and sued and sued to get ahold of all his riches, but didn't prevail. I think the judge who finally dismissed the case said the case lasted longer then the marriage. She became a hopeless druggie and finally od'd. It seemed inevitable; she was pure white trash. Hopefully her daughter will find a better path in life and won't become a stripper, and get gigantic breast implants, and pose nude and marry an ancient, dying, feeble-minded old man in order to get his millions and die of a drug overdose.\n\nShe was poor, not very intelligent, and gullible as could be. She was an easy target for every confidence man in Hollywood. Being rich and famous were the only things on her tiny mind. She eventually became drug addicted, and little more than a whore. it's sad she didn't survive into the 'me too' years. Maybe someone (she certainly wouldn't have) would have been able to save her or at least given the men who used her what they deserved. That scumbag Howard K. Stern, I firmly believe, kept her supplied with narcotics because they enabled him to do her any way he could. He belongs in prison for what he did to that girl.\n\n[quote] She did.\n\nOh, she lived very well while she was married to him. But after he died she not included in the will. She fought hard in the courts to get what she thought was rightfully hers, a few hundred million dollars at least. When she died to case was still pending. Some speculated that her daughter would get all the moolah. But that didn't happen. Doesn't look like it will. The goddam case went on forever. Here's an excerpt from an article in Forbes in 2017. The judge in the case had had enough of the craziness:\n\nFor much of that time, the matter has remained on Judge Mike Wood's docket: Judge Wood is a probate judge in Harris County, Texas.\n\nThis month, as lawyers quarreled over a temporary restraining order (TRO) involving trusts that were created as part of the estate, Judge Wood finally had it.\n\n\"I am,\" he told those in the court, \"going off the handle officially. I am tired of this case. I've told you that from the beginning. I beg you to recuse me. I beg you to recuse me. I don't want to deal with you people anymore. This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous.\"\n\nJudge Wood went on to say, \"I am not going to spend a lot of time cutting at nits and gnats for people that are fighting over 20 billion, $10 billion that they didn't earn. They didn't create this wealth. It was created by a third party, and they're just fighting over it. They can't agree on anything. They can pay lots of lawyers. They can pay lawyers until hell freezes over. But they don't want to agree to anything. They just want to pay lawyers.\"\n\nJudge Wood disputed that the parties actually wanted the case to end, advising them, \"you're going to have to figure out something to do because I just can't -- I'm not going to deal with you anymore. I've had it. I have had it. This is outrageous. This didn't happen overnight. This wasn't done four years ago. Pierce has been dead nine years.\" He then declared at the January 11 hearing that \"it's just not the way I'm going to spend my life.\" A week later, on January 18, Judge Wood officially recused himself from the case.\n\nAre people still trying that ridiculous \"golddigger Anna took advantage of a feeble old man\" crap? J. Howard Marshall was a ruthless bastard up to the bitter end of his life. He died of pneumonia at age 90 with zero indication that he was mentally incapacitated in any way. He battled the Koch family his whole life, for fucks sake. He screwed his daughter in law and grandchildren over with his tax frauds. And Anna was not the first stripper he pursued and wanted to marry--there was one before her who he kept in the wings for years while his wife was wasting away with Alzheimer's. When that stripper died unexpectedly, Marshall sued her estate to get back the millions he gave her in cash and gifts (including some of his wife's jewelry) despite the fact he expressly told his son she was to be taken care for the rest of her life if he died first. And he did it because he was in trouble with the IRS for not declaring those gifts, and with the SEC for improper stock transfers he made to her. That lawsuit was *after* met Anna Nicole Smith. He gave his equally ruthless son Pierce power of attorney after their wedding and also kept Anna out of his will, breaking the same promise to her as he did to his previous stripper girlfriend (that she would always be taken care of financially, even after his death), because he fucked her over just like he did everyone else in his life. Feeble my ass. He was exactly the asshole you'd expect a billionaire oil tycoon to be.\n\n[quote] Are people still trying that ridiculous \"golddigger Anna took advantage of a feeble old man\" crap?\n\nSo poor Anna Nicole was the \"victim\" of an evil old man? You're full of shit.\n\nNew York magazine printed a story entitled \"Paw Paw and Lady Love\" that chronicled the horror story that was Anna Nicole Smith and her grotesque hold over a rich, unwell old billionaire. Here's an excerpt:\n\nTheir wedding took place on June 27, 1994, in the White Dove Wedding Chapel. Sitting in his wheelchair, wearing a white tuxedo, 89-year-old J. Howard watched as his 26-year-old bride walked down an aisle of white rosebuds. He’d tried to stand, but his legs buckled. When it was time to kiss the bride, Anna Nicole leaned down to kiss him. Afterward, once white doves had been released into the sky, she delivered heartbreaking news: She needed to catch a plane out of town immediately for a photo shoot. Her new husband sat crying in his wheelchair. Blowing him kisses, she rushed away with her bodyguard, who would later claim the two had sex in a hotel room that night.\n\nAnd this:\n\nFor Christmas he gave her a teddy bear wearing a gargantuan emerald pendant; she gave him a nose-hair trimmer. Later, during an evening out, there was confusion about who was caring for him, and he was left outside in heavy rain.\n\nWhen J. Howard returned to Texas, his condition worsened. In January, Anna Nicole visited him at his house. She stayed up with him through the night, spooning chicken broth into his mouth, despite an order that he be fed only through a tube. When he began choking, she became hysterical. He lost consciousness and had to be revived en route to the hospital.\n\nPierce reacted swiftly and coolly: He assumed temporary guardianship of his father and cut her off completely, forwarding her bills directly to her. For a few years now, she had been spending—and, at the end, demanding—upwards of six figures per month. She was caught off guard. She became desperate.\n\nWhen J. Howard was released from the hospital, she visited again. She took off her shirt and bra and climbed atop him, shoving her breasts in his face: “Do you miss your rosebuds?” she pleaded, a tape ­recorder in her hand, urging him to repeat out loud his promise to take care of her and her son. He was unable to speak. Finally, Pierce hired several armed guards, significantly limiting her access to her husband. Some on his staff claim he expressed regret for having married her.\n\nI only knew Smith/Marshall from the headlines, then caught a few episodes of her reality show.\n\nRegardless of her life up until that point, I could tell that the woman desperately needed a friend, someone to show her a little care. No one around her at that point was healthy or helpful. Everyone wanted something from the caricature, and no one was very interested in the person underneath. To me she seemed resigned to the consequences of her life.\n\nThe glimpses of sweetness, and what she may have been long ago, were heartbreaking--as were her obvious drug use and depression..\n\nI remember being unexpectedly moved when she passed.\n\n[quote] Regardless of her life up until that point, I could tell that the woman desperately needed a friend, someone to show her a little care. No one around her at that point was healthy or helpful.\n\nThat was her choice. It was her choice to surround herself with creeps. They were her kind of people. Her life was a series of bad choices; HER choices. And as far as her drug alcohol addiction and depression went...well, as far as I know she never sought help for any of it. I never felt any sympathy towards her. She lived her life the way she wanted to, until it eventually killed her."
