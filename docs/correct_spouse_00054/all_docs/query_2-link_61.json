DREW IS ON ANDERSON COOPER 360 RIGHT NOW TALKING ABOUT GIVING KIDS POT\n\nI FORGOT HE WAS A REAL DOCTOR\n\nlol Dr. Drew was my sex ed pretty much, sadly. This is so exciting for me... junior high memories, man.\n\nIf it's not his child, it's not his child. Shame on him for trying to desperately finangle himself into this little girl's life at the last minute to \"oversee her finances\". He's a damn thief and a murderer. Money-hungry, back-stabbing opportunist.\n\niawtc.\n\niawtc\n\nagreed. sleazy.\n\ni hope they make a reality show.\n\nSeriously it's like that show \"My Two Dads\"...or maybe it was called \"Three Men and a Baby\"\n\nEither way, this would make for GREAT television.\n\nstole the comment right from my fingertipz\n\nwhy should he have anything to do with it's money if it's not his kid??\n\nthat heel makes me drool. any idea who it's by?\n\nfound this\n\nhttp://www.shoebunny.com/category/red-shoes/page/2/\n\nscroll down\n\nI want that shoe. That shoe is perfect. If you know where that shoe can be found, then please: alert me of the location of a pair.\n\n(no subject) - xdecadentx Expand\n\nsrsly I want those shoes\n\n(no subject) - xdecadentx Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - xdecadentx Expand\n\nI don't get why he is negotiating at ALL. HKS doesn't have a damn leg to stand on if Birkhead is the father. He has *nothing*. If I were Birkhead I wouldn't even fucking talk to him. I'd get my test and take my kid and tell him to shove his negotiations up his ass.\n\nNegotiating? Why? All Larry has to do is wait for the paternity results and Howard won't get a thing.\n\nThe only thing I can figure is that they're both gambling on which one is the father. If they don't negotiate, one could find out they were the fater and get everything, while the other gets nothing. With negotiations, it works out well for both of them. I guess if Birkhead was actually afraid of not being the father...(which Stern really seems to be afraid of, seeing as he's making up this crap in the first place) It's just basically some insurance. :/\n\n:( why can't they just put the kid first instead\n\nBut these negotiations really don't benefit Birkhead in any way, that's why I don't comprehend. What does Birkhead get out of it? It's basically just Howard trying to insinuate himself into the child's life via finances & pressuring Birkhead to whore himself out to the tabloid shows, presumably because joint interviews would bring in more steak.\n\nbecause larry doesnt want the kid he just wants to make a pay day.\n\n(no subject) - dissention_1 Expand\n\n(no subject) - evett Expand\n\n(no subject) - heart_of_butter Expand\n\n(no subject) - ashleypaige87 Expand\n\n(no subject) - ailiel Expand\n\nshe looks like larry\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\n:) im all hooked on NMTB\n\nshe looks like Winston Churchill.\n\nall babies do.\n\n(no subject) - evett Expand\n\nDo the right thing, Larry! I know you can.\n\ni am so bored and i can't sleep\n\ntry tea and Futurerama on cartoon network?\n\ni don't have that channel :( i've got the poor mans cable\n\nRe: ot - numbedtoe Expand\n\nRe: ot - msclairvoyant Expand\n\nRe: ot - numbedtoe Expand\n\nRe: ot - msclairvoyant Expand\n\nwell it aint secret talks no more.\n\nI'm really dreading the LIfetime movie that's bound to come from all of this.\n\nHopefully the kid doesn't turn out too messed up...then and again, this IS Hollywood..uhh the Bahamas. Close enough.\n\nthis is the biggest collection of money-grubbing lowlifes ever assembled in one news story. i feel bad for Dannielynn being stuck with all these dorks. The poor girl doesn't even have a chance.\n\nThats probably how everyone felt about Anna when she was a baby...Lol. She turned out, ummm, kind of alright. She was fine until Howard K. came into her life...then she was messed up all the time, and honestly, I would have been too.\n\nYou know for Anna's sake I hope that Howie isn't the prick we all think he is. I hope that he was her friend and that he genuinely mourns her and does have the interests of someone other than himself at heart. If he's a genuine guy there are worse things than growing up with more than one \"father\" figure that loves you.\n\nI agree with you too. I hope he isn't a murderer or a money-hungry asshole like we all think he is now. For that sweet baby's sake. And I think Larry is a genuine guy.\n\nBut what are the odds of that? ANS herself was the most openly money-hungry person I have ever seen when she was alive, so it makes sense that the people she surrounded herself with had similar traits. I personally feel she earned every dime of her money and deserves it all, but I do think it was wrong of her to bring a child into her lifestyle and attempt to profit off of that child while she was alive (and even potentially profit off the death of her other child, ugh-- I know we were told that money would eventually go to charity, was it ever confirmed?). It should not be surprising that a money-hungry woman would be surrounded by other money-hungry people, and all are looking to cash in just as she would have done herself.\n\nBasically, Dannie/Dannilynn/lyn however you spell it was doomed from conception.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)"
