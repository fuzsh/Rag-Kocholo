        "text": "DNA testing has become an overarching definition for a variety of genetic tests, but each DNA test is meant for very different purposes. Here’s a brief overview of several common DNA tests.\n\nThere are three main groups of DNA testing: Forensics DNA testing, Relationship DNA testing, and Genetic DNA testing.\n\nForensic DNA Testing\n\nForensic DNA testing is also called DNA typing or genetic fingerprinting and is used by forensic scientists to help identify people by their DNA. Forensic DNA testing not only helps to identify those involved in a crime, but it’s also used to help identify victims of a catastrophe.\n\nForensic DNA testing works because each person has a unique DNA sequence called a DNA profile. Although all human DNA is virtually 99.9% identical, one-tenth of a single percent is different. That’s only .01%! This is the DNA that is tested in forensic testing because it distinguishes one person from another.\n\nTypes of forensic DNA samples that are submitted vary greatly, several of which contain blood, hair bone or other bodily fluids or tissue. CODIS, also called the Combined DNA Index System is an FBI database containing all DNA profiles on the state and national level. The National DNA Index (NDIS),is a national DNA index of offenders, arrestees and forensic DNA profiles. These are used as tools to assist in solving crimes by finding individuals who may be involved.\n\nRelationship DNA Testing\n\nRelationship DNA tests are used to determine relationships with others either on a personal level or even on a group level. There are several branches that make up this grouping such as genealogical testing (broad level) or paternity testing on a more person (personal level).\n\nFirst, lets talk about genealogical testing. Genealogical testing is exactly what its title implies: It helps people learn more about their ancestry. This test can help you determine your family lineage such as where your ancestors came from geologically and to whom you may be related . This DNA testing usually involves testing your DNA compared with a pool or group of people within a database to find relationships or commonalities within the population of DNA profiles.\n\nAnother type of relationship DNA testing establishes one-on-one relationships, such as paternity testing. This is what HomeDNA Paternity is all about. This type of test can help determine parentage, or in other words, identify someone’s father and you can buy an at-home kit right in the store.\n\nThere are other types of relationship tests that must be ordered directly through the lab, such as: grandparent test (if the possible father isn’t available or is unwilling to test); a maternity test (useful in adoption and immigration cases); sibling DNA test to identify if children are full or half siblings or not even related; an aunt/uncle DNA test to determine if someone is an aunt or uncle to a child; a twin zygosity test to determine whether twins are identical or fraternal.\n\nYou may need a relationship DNA test for legal purposes, say to establish child custody, child support or for immigration purposes or you may just want to know for peace of mind.\n\nGenetic DNA Testing\n\nGenetic DNA testing, commonly known as clinical DNA testing, is for medical purposes. This test is used to help diagnose and predict risk for health problems.\n\nNewborns are often screened for several genetic disorders and adults and children alike are tested for suspected genetic conditions to help with a diagnosis. Other genetic DNA tests can determine health risks for cancer, diseases, disorders, conditions as well as exercise and drug responses. In addition to helping to determine a suspected genetic condition, it can also predict the chance that person may someday develop or pass on a certain condition to their children. Many of these genetic conditions present themselves in the form of genetic mutations. Although many genetic tests exist, not all genetic disorders or conditions are testable.\n\nThere are many more DNA tests that fall within each of these three categories, but these are some of the more common tests.\n\nOriginally Posted in 2014: UPDATED OCTOBER, 2021\n\nFollow us on Facebook and Twitter!

Fatherhood is usually determined first by marriage. Although all states have differing laws for establishing paternity, most state laws say that if a married woman gives birth to a child, the husband is the “legal” father. But what happens if the woman isn’t married? This is where establishing paternity can get complicated.\n\nThough most children are born to a mother and a father, the CDC reported in 2012 that out of the almost 4 million U.S. births, 40.7% of those children were born to an unmarried mother. When an unmarried woman needs to establish paternity for the sake of child support and child custody, she usually has two options.\n\nThe first option for establishing paternity when there is no “legal” father is by voluntary declaration of paternity. Both parties, mother and father, voluntarily sign and consent to being the child’s legal parents and are in agreement that the other is also the parent.\n\nThe other option is to establish paternity through a court order. This is where the legal paternity test comes into play.\n\nLegal Paternity Testing\n\nIn order to prove paternity for court purposes, a legal paternity test is usually necessary. A legal paternity test requires a chain-of-custody process whereby a third-party Collector verifies participating individuals’ identity, witnesses DNA collection and then sends the samples to directly to the testing laboratory. This process ensures that no party has tampered with samples and prevents any other fraudulent activities. Once results are received at the lab, the DNA from the father, child and sometimes mother is compared and results are released to the participants.\n\nThe DDC Legal Paternity Test\n\nHomeDNA Paternity’s parent company, DDC, offers a legal paternity test that is affordable and convenient. Here’s what you can expect if you start the legal paternity test process with us.\n\nFirst, you need to call DDC. During this phone call, a DNA sample-collection appointment is set up at a location near you\n\nWe send all testing supplies directly to your collector prior to the collection appointment. If you’ve already purchased an at-home kit from the store, we’ll credit your account\n\nNext, you need to attend your collection appointment with a government-issued photo ID (for adults) and a photo (for children)\n\nYour collector verifies the identity of each participant, helps you fill out the order form and sample envelopes, witnesses DNA collection and then sends your samples to our lab\n\nResults are ready online two (2) business days after the samples arrive at our laboratory.\n\nThere is only one real difference between at-home tests and legal paternity tests. That difference is in the method in collecting the DNA samples. As already mentioned, a legal paternity test needs a chain-of-custody to withstand in court, whereas a home test (not for legal purposes) can be collected (unsupervised) in the privacy of your home.\n\nFollow us on Facebook and Twitter!

After the initial period of mourning, a new story has taken over the headlines: Who will claim a portion of his $300 million estate? DNA testing may hold the answers.\n\nHave you noticed how long-lost ‘relatives’ suddenly appear whenever a famous person passes away? They seem to be especially numerous when there isn’t a will and no clear heir in the picture. Here’s a quick look at this case as well as other famous paternity testing battles.\n\nHow does Paternity Testing Work with a Deceased Person like Prince?\n\nPrince’s body was cremated, but only after a thorough autopsy was conducted. During most autopsies, blood samples are collected on a filter-paper blood card, in case DNA is needed later on. With proper authorization, the DNA profile from the blood sample of the deceased can then be tested against the cheek-swab DNA samples of the living.\n\nWho is Requesting a DNA Test with Prince?\n\nThe first request for paternity testing came from a 39-year-old man named Carlin Q. Williams, who is serving time in Colorado for firearms possession. Williams’ mother claims she had unprotected sex with Prince in 1976, when the singer was just 18 years old.\n\nBut Williams’ claim is only the beginning. Since then, 700 people have claimed to be Prince’s half-siblings. Only a DNA test will be able to prove if any of the claims have merit: This scientific methodology is completely impartial, the science is sound, and results of a legal paternity test are accepted by the court system.\n\nClaimants only have four months to prove their cases. If none of the paternity testing or half-sibling DNA test results shows a biological relationship, then Prince’s fortune goes to his surviving siblings.\n\nOther Recent Celebrity Paternity Testing Cases\n\nThere are near-constant paternity testing ‘scandals’ in the news involving living celebrities, but not nearly as many posthumous ones. This is simply because, until very recently, the DNA test technology didn’t exist to help prove relationships with the deceased. Here are a couple of the most famous ones.\n\nAnna Nicole Smith\n\nAnna Nicole’s tragic 2007 death made headlines for months. She had just given birth to an infant daughter and revised the birth certificate to list her partner, Howard K. Stern, as the father. However, when she passed away, several men came forward claiming to be the real biological father of little Dannielynn. However, a DNA test proved who the real father was: Larry Birkhead, Smith’s former boyfriend. He was given sole custody of the child, who is now 10 years old.\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nIt has long been speculated that Michael Jackson was not the biological father of his three children, but there was no reason to do paternity testing while he was alive. Following his death, his family filed a wrongful-death suit and asked the judge to exclude any evidence relating to the paternity of the children. This small act tacitly confirmed that he may not be the biological father of his children, but any DNA results that may exist have not been made public.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPaternity testing is always simplest when all participants are living, but there are definitely methods that can be used when the possible father is deceased or otherwise unavailable for testing. Sadly, the Prince DNA test fiasco seems nothing more than a money-grab. But for most people, the need to know their biological roots is the principle reason for wanting to confirm their connections and to strengthen their family tree.\n\nFollow us onFacebook andTwitter!
