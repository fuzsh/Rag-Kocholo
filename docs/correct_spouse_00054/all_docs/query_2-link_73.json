        "text": "DNA analysis has proved that Anna Nicole Smith’s former boyfriend Larry Birkhead is the father of her baby daughter, an expert in genetic evidence said last night.\n\nThe identity of the father of Anna Nicole Smith’s infant daughter could be revealed in Nassau, Bahamas, today in the latest round in the custody dispute pitting the former Playboy Playmate’s ex-boyfriend against her lawyer-turned-partner.\n\nThe lawyer-turned-partner of Anna Nicole Smith has dropped his bid to halt the use of DNA to prove the paternity of the former Playboy playmate's infant daughter.\n\nPLAYBOY Playmate Anna Nicole Smith died of an accidental overdose of a sleeping medication and at least eight other prescription drugs, and she had recently had a bacterial infection from injecting drugs into her buttocks, authorities said yesterday.\n\nA lawyer for one of the three men claiming paternity of Anna Nicole Smith’s baby today asked a judge to order Howard K Stern to come to California and provide a DNA sample.\n\nPolice investigating the cause of Anna Nicole Smith's death last month have uncovered \"significant\" new evidence - causing the coroner to delay releasing his findings.\n\nAnna Nicole Smith's companion Howard K Stern is reportedly in secret talks with her former boyfriend Larry Birkhead to reach a settlement regarding the custody of her daughter Dannielynn.\n\nAnna Nicole Smith’s friends and family awaited the release of her body today, as they planned for starlet’s funeral in the Bahamas after weeks of legal wrangling over her remains.\n\nAnna Nicole Smith will be buried next to her son Daniel in the Bahamas on Friday morning after a Florida court rejected an appeal by the late star's estranged mother.\n\nCRYING as he announced his ruling, a judge said yesterday he hopes Anna Nicole Smith will be buried in the Bahamas, but he left the decision up to the guardian of her baby daughter.\n\nANNA Nicole Smith’s ex-boyfriend testified yesterday that he tried to curb the former centrefold’s drug use and the judge referred to her long-time companion, Howard K Stern, as “maybe an enabler”.\n\nAnna Nicole Smith’s estranged mother and her ex-boyfriend both testified that the starlet said she wanted to be buried in California, not the plots in the Bahamas or Texas that have been the focus of the fierce week-long legal debate.\n\nA grief-stricken Anna Nicole Smith threw herself over her son’s body last fall as he lay in a coffin in the Bahamas, wailing, “If Daniel has to be buried, I want to buried with him,” her boyfriend testified at a hearing on where the former centrefold should be laid to rest.\n\nAnna Nicole Smith’s body was ordered to be held for DNA testing in the paternity dispute involving the former Playboy Playmate’s five-month old daughter, a judge ruled today.\n\nThe mother of former Playboy playmate and model Anna Nicole Smith blamed drugs today for her daughter’s sudden death that ended an extraordinary tabloid life at just 39.\n\nWith major legal issues undecided, Anna Nicole Smith’s legacy could take years to untangle and could leave her baby daughter with millions of pounds or nothing at all.\n\nThe photojournalist battling to prove he's the father of model/actress Anna Nicole Smith's baby daughter will find out if he is the daddy by the end of the month.\n\nAnna Nicole Smith will be forced to have her baby daughter undergo paternity tests, after a Los Angeles court ordered her to return to the Californian city.\n\nAnna Nicole Smith has lashed out at her mother for making TV claims that the former model's partner, attorney Howard K Stern, was to blame for her son's death.\n\nUS news show Entertainment Tonight has scooped a world exclusive by landing Anna Nicole Smith's first interview since the death of her son Daniel and the birth of her baby daughter Dannielynn."
