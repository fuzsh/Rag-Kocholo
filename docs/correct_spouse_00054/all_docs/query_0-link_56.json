They've worked together for so long so I'd assume that they know more about each other than some other celebrity couples.\n\nThat and he's obviously got a shitload of dirt on her.\n\ni agree\n\nI totally agree. anyone that watched the anna nicole show knew it was obvious that they were at least digging eachother. I say good for them and I hope they're happy.\n\nI agree as well. I'm rooting for them and I pray Howard is the real father of the baby.\n\ni call photoshop\n\nwhere?\n\nlol pwnd\n\n(no subject) - chung_____chung Expand\n\n(no subject) - bellichka Expand\n\nI thought Bea was on vacation or something\n\nWow!! That definitely makes it seem like he is not the father then...this could be a perfect set up for them to try to fight for custody of the baby.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nI know!!!!! I'm so in love with JDM!! John...Denny...all yummyness!\n\nMy thoughts exactly!\n\nthis is like a soap opera or something.\n\niawtc\n\nTotally bizarre.\n\nWHAT??\n\n! EXACTLY !\n\nWORD\n\nexactly.\n\nSmith then married 89-year-old oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall in June 1994. He died in 1990\n\nNice.\n\nlol right --\n\nDamn they need to edit their ish before they send it\n\nI understand being the \"first\" to break the news but break it right\n\nIt is Star magazine though! Who knows if the article is even true.\n\n(no subject) - baby_phat_honne Expand\n\n(no subject) - iralynn Expand\n\n(no subject) - baby_phat_honne Expand\n\n(no subject) - iralynn Expand\n\nHe used his money to build a time machine to go back to his younger more care-free days. Unfortunately shoddy workmanship and insufficient technology botched the trip and he only made it to 1990. He realized he was still old and died of being, instantly, completely depressed.\n\n(no subject) - iralynn Expand\n\nLMAO! XDDDDDDDDD\n\nLOL\n\np.s. if that's you in your icon, you are gorgeous.\n\n(no subject) - iralynn Expand\n\nNow it will look a lot less creepy for her attorney to be constantly at her side.\n\nYou go you sassy things!\n\nPS: I totally missed the full report on Daniel's death. Does anyone have an article link?\n\nI know its up on people.com if that helps\n\nMerci, mon amie.\n\n(no subject) - baby_phat_honne Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - confab_nation Expand\n\nThis is seriosuly getting good\n\nWe just need an hour long show on Maury now\n\nWow, this story gets weirder and weirder. I doubt getting married right after such a trauma is the best idea, but who am I to say? I hope they are happy, and that he provides the support she needs right now.\n\nMaybe his early death caused them to realize that life is shorter than we think and we should live for today.\n\nI seriously hope he is an ok guy. As much as I can't stand Anna Nicole she certainly needs some happiness right now.\n\nOn her show, it always seemed to me that he cared a lot about her and looked out for her.\n\nshe got married when her son died not long ago?!\n\n..i suddenly dont feel sorry for her anymore.\n\nNot picking on you, but do you feel the same way about Dog the Bounty Hunter? He got married the day after his daughter died in an accident.\n\nTrust me, I could give a crap about Anna Nicole Smith. That being said, I would think that after a loss like that, you'd feel the need to celebrate life and love more urgently than before...\n\nSame here. I actually scrolled down to make a similar reply to a similar comment. How the hell does her getting married negate the fact that she was devestated about her son's death? What -- are people now not allowed to celebrate or in any way do a positive thing within a three month buffer of any close tragedy??\n\nDog has had his marriage planned for a while. Also I think something was said that he was going to cancel the wedding\n\nThis was very sudden. Totally not planned well in advance.\n\nRe: Just curious... - princessbunny Expand\n\nRe: Just curious... - skunk Expand\n\nRe: Just curious... - bangkokladyboys Expand\n\nRe: Just curious... - snowwhitekitty Expand\n\n(no subject) - infidelkast Expand\n\nRe: Just curious... - snowwhitekitty Expand\n\nmaybe she doesn't want to dwell on it and be unhappy? well EXXXCUUSEEEEE HERRRRR!\n\nIt makes me feel even more sorry for her.\n\nShe is completely immersed in grief, she can't be making a well thought out decision.\n\nIt's all very sad.\n\nAnna, he's using you!!\n\nDid you ever watch her show on E! ? It was so obvious that he loved her even then.\n\nThis is such a confusing mess. I don't even know what to think anymore."
