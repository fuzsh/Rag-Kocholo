        "text": "Anna Nicole Smith’s former lover and attorney is now working with the L.A. County Public Defender’s Office.\n\nThe Blast has confirmed reports that Stern has been hired with the Los Angeles Public Defender's Office\n\nSources tell us Stern was hired by the office earlier this month and officially began working on June 3.\n\nWe’re told he is currently in a training program for public defenders in downtown L.A., with his collogues feeling he is “motivated” and people like him so far.\n\nSources tell us Stern is handling preliminary hearings at the moment but will move up as time goes on.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter was the first to report the news.\n\nStern has an interesting history with Anna Nicole Smith. He met the Playboy model when she was suing the estate of her late husband, J. Howard Marshall, while trying to fight for his millions. She claimed to be owed half of his estate and battled his son for years trying to get her cut.\n\nStern was also a lawyer but stopped practicing law after he started shooting Smith’s E! reality show, “The Anna Nicole Show”, which aired from 2002-2004.\n\nHe would be around at the end of Anna Nicole’s life with the two even exchanging vows and rings in a non-binding commitment ceremony in the Bahamas.\n\nHoward K. Stern was also listed as the father on the birth certificate of Anna Nicole’s daughter Dannielyn, even though it would later be proven that Larry Birkhead was the true father.\n\nHe would also have a felony conviction dismissed relating to using fake names to obtain prescriptions for Smith.\n\nAnna Nicole Smith passed away in 2007 at the age of 39."
