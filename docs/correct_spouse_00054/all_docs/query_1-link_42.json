        "text": "“Who does he think he is... they all deserve better.”\n\nHoward Stern is facing renewed backlash over a series of problematic interview clips that have resurfaced on TikTok.\n\nEver since his self-titled radio show began airing in 1985, Howard, now 69, became known for the inappropriate sexual comments he made to his guests — many of whom were, and still are, women.\n\nAnd this week, a collection of Howard’s “disgusting” past comments toward some of these women took TikTok by storm.\n\n@lmpsluvbot\n\nthis man is so disgusting, i dont even understand how he still has a job?! |#howardstern #howardsternshow #lisamariepresley #lisamariepresleyonhowardstern #mariahcarey #fionaapple #courtneylove #sofiavergara #annanicolesmith #thehowardsternshow #cancelled #disrespecttowardswomen #uncomfortableinterviews #hollywood #celebrity #celebrities #90sand00s #lmpsluvbot #edits #fyp #xyzbca\n\n♬ original sound - ༺𝐛𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐞༻\n\nThe compilation, which has received over 2.4 million views on the platform, begins with a clip of Howard asking Lisa Marie Presley if she was “wearing panties” during an interview.\n\n“You wearing panties? What’d you wear, a thong?” he asks, to which Lisa Marie nods unenthusiastically.\n\nHoward then asks how she looks in her underwear, to which Lisa Marie appears visibly annoyed and says, “I don’t know,” before staring off to the side.\n\nThe next woman featured in the compilation is Mariah Carey, who was sadly sexualized by Howard when she appeared on his show in 1998.\n\n“First of all, your breasts are incredible,” Howard tells her. With a straight face, she replies, “No, they’re not. They’re really not. They’re normal, but thank you.”\n\nHoward continues, “They talk to me,” before later suggesting that he noticed them as soon as Mariah “walked out on stage.”\n\nAnd Howard later comments on the body of Courtney Love in the TikTok compilation, too.\n\n“Ooh yeah, you got a nice stomach,” he says as she removes her jacket. Courtney is wearing a slightly cropped tank top in the clip, which was filmed in 1998, too.\n\nWhen Courtney attempts to brush the comment off by suggesting that her outfit isn’t all that put-together, Howard insists that what she’s wearing is “fine.”\n\nCourtney then appears uneasy, pulling the top down to cover her stomach. But taking no notice of her apparent discomfort, Howard continues, “Just stand there for a second, let me look at you. Body’s hot,” before she sternly warns, “Howard.”\n\nAgain, Howard keeps going. “I would do a lot to that,” he says, prompting Courtney to call him out again: “Howard.” The host takes no notice, adding, “I could make you see things.” At this point, Courtney looks beyond fed up, calling his name a third time in a stern voice.\n\nThe compilation later features a clip of Sofía Vergara’s appearance on Howard Stern, during which he made crude remarks about the fact that she’d breastfed her son. Sofía gave birth to Manolo, now 31, when she was 19.\n\n“Did you breastfeed your son?” Howard asks in the clip, to which she replies, “Yes.” Howard says in response, “Oh, that must’ve been unbelievable.”\n\n“It wasn’t unbelievable, I was, like, 19,” Sofía says. Howard replies, “You must’ve had so much milk. Right? How much milk?”\n\nAnd as if all this wasn’t disturbing enough, the TikTok compilation ends with a clip of the time Howard literally told Anna Nicole Smith that she’s a “heavy set woman.”\n\n“The way you dress and stuff — I don’t think you’re aware that you’re a heavy set woman,” he says frankly.\n\nAnna Nicole looks visibly hurt by Howard’s comment, responding, “I know I’m a big woman, so what?”\n\n“So, I was guessing your weight,” he says nonchalantly, before actually asking her to “get on the scale” so that he could guess her weight.\n\n“Could you please get on the scale, and then we’ll have an over/under? That’s all,” he said. Anna Nicole rightfully refused to get on the scale, and looked disgusted by the suggestion.\n\nWell, unsurprisingly, this TikTok compilation has garnered a wave of renewed backlash since going viral this week.\n\n“The one of Anna Nicole Smith breaks my heart, how they all bullied her on there, the poor woman looked so upset and uncomfy,” someone wrote. “I feel so bad for Anna,” another person echoed.\n\n“All these poor women fml,” someone wrote. “Who does he think he is… they all deserve better,” read another comment.\n\nMeanwhile, other users pointed out that Howard has escaped relatively unscathed when it comes to facing criticism over his past remarks.\n\n“With cancel culture, how did they never go after Stern,” one person wrote. “Alix Earle was just on his show, too… the show is more ‘tame’ now, but obviously, he never changed,” said another.\n\nShare This Article"
