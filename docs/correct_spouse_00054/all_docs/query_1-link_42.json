        "text": "‚ÄúWho does he think he is... they all deserve better.‚Äù\n\nHoward Stern is facing renewed backlash over a series of problematic interview clips that have resurfaced on TikTok.\n\nEver since his self-titled radio show began airing in 1985, Howard, now 69, became known for the inappropriate sexual comments he made to his guests ‚Äî many of whom were, and still are, women.\n\nAnd this week, a collection of Howard‚Äôs ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù past comments toward some of these women took TikTok by storm.\n\n@lmpsluvbot\n\nthis man is so disgusting, i dont even understand how he still has a job?! |#howardstern #howardsternshow #lisamariepresley #lisamariepresleyonhowardstern #mariahcarey #fionaapple #courtneylove #sofiavergara #annanicolesmith #thehowardsternshow #cancelled #disrespecttowardswomen #uncomfortableinterviews #hollywood #celebrity #celebrities #90sand00s #lmpsluvbot #edits #fyp #xyzbca\n\n‚ô¨ original sound - ‡º∫ùêõùê´ùê®ùê®ùê§ùêû‡ºª\n\nThe compilation, which has received over 2.4 million views on the platform, begins with a clip of Howard asking Lisa Marie Presley if she was ‚Äúwearing panties‚Äù during an interview.\n\n‚ÄúYou wearing panties? What‚Äôd you wear, a thong?‚Äù he asks, to which Lisa Marie nods unenthusiastically.\n\nHoward then asks how she looks in her underwear, to which Lisa Marie appears visibly annoyed and says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù before staring off to the side.\n\nThe next woman featured in the compilation is Mariah Carey, who was sadly sexualized by Howard when she appeared on his show in 1998.\n\n‚ÄúFirst of all, your breasts are incredible,‚Äù Howard tells her. With a straight face, she replies, ‚ÄúNo, they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre really not. They‚Äôre normal, but thank you.‚Äù\n\nHoward continues, ‚ÄúThey talk to me,‚Äù before later suggesting that he noticed them as soon as Mariah ‚Äúwalked out on stage.‚Äù\n\nAnd Howard later comments on the body of Courtney Love in the TikTok compilation, too.\n\n‚ÄúOoh yeah, you got a nice stomach,‚Äù he says as she removes her jacket. Courtney is wearing a slightly cropped tank top in the clip, which was filmed in 1998, too.\n\nWhen Courtney attempts to brush the comment off by suggesting that her outfit isn‚Äôt all that put-together, Howard insists that what she‚Äôs wearing is ‚Äúfine.‚Äù\n\nCourtney then appears uneasy, pulling the top down to cover her stomach. But taking no notice of her apparent discomfort, Howard continues, ‚ÄúJust stand there for a second, let me look at you. Body‚Äôs hot,‚Äù before she sternly warns, ‚ÄúHoward.‚Äù\n\nAgain, Howard keeps going. ‚ÄúI would do a lot to that,‚Äù he says, prompting Courtney to call him out again: ‚ÄúHoward.‚Äù The host takes no notice, adding, ‚ÄúI could make you see things.‚Äù At this point, Courtney looks beyond fed up, calling his name a third time in a stern voice.\n\nThe compilation later features a clip of Sof√≠a Vergara‚Äôs appearance on Howard Stern, during which he made crude remarks about the fact that she‚Äôd breastfed her son. Sof√≠a gave birth to Manolo, now 31, when she was 19.\n\n‚ÄúDid you breastfeed your son?‚Äù Howard asks in the clip, to which she replies, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Howard says in response, ‚ÄúOh, that must‚Äôve been unbelievable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt unbelievable, I was, like, 19,‚Äù Sof√≠a says. Howard replies, ‚ÄúYou must‚Äôve had so much milk. Right? How much milk?‚Äù\n\nAnd as if all this wasn‚Äôt disturbing enough, the TikTok compilation ends with a clip of the time Howard literally told Anna Nicole Smith that she‚Äôs a ‚Äúheavy set woman.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe way you dress and stuff ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre aware that you‚Äôre a heavy set woman,‚Äù he says frankly.\n\nAnna Nicole looks visibly hurt by Howard‚Äôs comment, responding, ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm a big woman, so what?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo, I was guessing your weight,‚Äù he says nonchalantly, before actually asking her to ‚Äúget on the scale‚Äù so that he could guess her weight.\n\n‚ÄúCould you please get on the scale, and then we‚Äôll have an over/under? That‚Äôs all,‚Äù he said. Anna Nicole rightfully refused to get on the scale, and looked disgusted by the suggestion.\n\nWell, unsurprisingly, this TikTok compilation has garnered a wave of renewed backlash since going viral this week.\n\n‚ÄúThe one of Anna Nicole Smith breaks my heart, how they all bullied her on there, the poor woman looked so upset and uncomfy,‚Äù someone wrote. ‚ÄúI feel so bad for Anna,‚Äù another person echoed.\n\n‚ÄúAll these poor women fml,‚Äù someone wrote. ‚ÄúWho does he think he is‚Ä¶ they all deserve better,‚Äù read another comment.\n\nMeanwhile, other users pointed out that Howard has escaped relatively unscathed when it comes to facing criticism over his past remarks.\n\n‚ÄúWith cancel culture, how did they never go after Stern,‚Äù one person wrote. ‚ÄúAlix Earle was just on his show, too‚Ä¶ the show is more ‚Äòtame‚Äô now, but obviously, he never changed,‚Äù said another.\n\nShare This Article"
