        "text": "Anna Nicole Smith’s tearful, grieving mom took on his daughter’s boyfriend today, blaming lawyer Howard K. Stern for their estrangement and even hinted that he’s responsible for her daughter and grandson’s deaths.\n\nThe late model’s mom Virgie Arthur tried to paint herself as a caring mom, torn apart from her daughter by outsiders like Stern.\n\nThe mom and Stern – her daughter’s lawyer and boyfriend – are fighting in a Florida courtroom over who should be awarded the model’s remains. Smith died on Feb. 8 in a Florida hotel room, about five months after son Daniel Smith also mysteriously dropped dead in a Bahamian hospital.\n\n“My grandson did not overdose. Howard was there when he died. Howard was there when my daughter died,” an anguished Arthur said, who then turned toward Judge Larry Seidlin. “Please help us!”\n\nStern wants possession of Smith’s body so he can bury her next to Daniel Smith, 20, in the Bahamas. Arthur said her 39-year-old daughter belongs in Texas in family cemetery plots.\n\nArthur testified that Smith wanted to be burried in Texas. But under cross examination, the estranged mom – who hadn’t seen Smith in person since 1996 – admitted the Playmate had most recently told her she wanted to be laid to rest near her idol Marrilyn Monroe in California.\n\n“She did mention that once that she wanted to be buried by Marrilyn Monroe,” Arthur conceded. “But she’s a Texas girl.”\n\nArthur also told the judge she wants to exhume her grandson in the Bahamas and bring his body to Texas to be buried along with his starlet-mother in her native state.\n\nSmith’s longtime companion, Howard K. Stern, is fighting for the former Playboy centerfold to be buried next to her son in the island chain, where he died from apparent drug-related causes last year.\n\nOn the second day of testimony, Circuit Judge Larry Seidlin indicated the best result would be a compromise – and soon – since the medical examiner again warned Smith’s body was decomposing more quickly than expected and a public viewing could be in danger.\n\n“When you walked into the court, you hope to get everything,” Seidlin said. “We will try to fashion a remedy where not everyone gets everything they want.”\n\nSmith died Feb. 8 at age 39. Her cause of death is under investigation.\n\nWithout written proof of Smith’s wishes, Seidlin was forced to hear testimony from those who claim to know what she wanted.\n\nAlso at issue in a California court is who fathered Smith’s 5-month-old daughter, Dannielynn, who could inherit millions of dollars. Stern is listed as the father on the birth certificate, but a photographer who once dated Smith says the girl is his.\n\nSmith’s mother, Virgie Arthur, testified that although she had not seen her daughter since 1996, they spoke on the phone more frequently. She cried as she spoke about her relationship with Smith and her 20-year-old grandson’s death.\n\nShe also disputed Stern’s testimony on Tuesday that Smith was always obsessed with her own death and expected to die young, just like her hero, Marilyn Monroe.\n\n“You can’t make me believe that. She was too full of life. She loved life,” she said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Arthur had testified that drugs soured her relationship with her daughter. Arthur said the two talked only every few months and that Smith often called her in the middle of the night sounding “drugged.”\n\nArthur’s attorney, John O’Quinn, told on CBS’s “The Early Show” on Wednesday that Stern caused Smith’s drug problems, and that she was “egged on to say things sensational” about her relationship with her mother.\n\nStern earlier testified Smith never recovered from her son’s death. He said a grief-stricken Smith threw herself over his body as he lay in a coffin in the Bahamas, wailing, “If Daniel has to be buried, I want to buried with him.”\n\nStern attorney Krista Barth said she had bank documentation proving Smith had agreed to pay for two cemetery plots in Nassau. She showed an “Entertainment Tonight” interview in which Smith expressed hatred for her estranged mother.\n\nO’Quinn said Smith’s son was buried illegally in the Bahamas. “There was no reason to be burying somebody who is not a legal resident of the Bahamas in the Bahamas,” he told CBS.\n\n“This whole case is based on fraud, fraud, fraud perpetrated by Stern so he can always control everything and make money off of Anna,” he said.\n\nStern testified the couple considered each other husband and wife and had celebrated a commitment ceremony, though it was not legal. Stern said they had planned to legally wed this week. He conceded, however, that Smith had other lovers.\n\nHe also said he isn’t looking for any money from her estate and would waive his fee as the executor of her will. “I do not intend to get one penny,” Stern said.\n\nA California judge refused to give up the paternity case involving Smith’s daughter but suggested there were still questions to be resolved before the courts can determine which state has jurisdiction.\n\nAttorneys for Arthur and the other man who claims to be the father, Larry Birkhead, sought to discredit Stern. Outside a Los Angeles courtroom on Tuesday, Birkhead’s attorney, Debra Opri, said Stern’s claim of a romantic relationship with Smith wasn’t even true.\n\nSmith was the widow of Texas oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II. The two married in 1994 when he was 89 and she was 26. She had been fighting his family over his estimated $500 million fortune since his death in 1995.\n\nAssociated Press writer Kelli Kennedy in Fort Lauderdale and AP Special Correspondent Linda Deutsch in Los Angeles contributed to this report."
