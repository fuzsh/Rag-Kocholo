        "text": "I am so confused by all this and it is like watching a train wreck for me. I used to love watching her reality show (Daniel was such a cutie) and thought that Anna and Howard would be grea together. It just seems so peculiar that she can have such a happy ceremony at such an awful time. If that is what gets her through things, then that is totally fine. I just can't imagine having any sort of committment/wedding ceremony after my child has died only weeks before. I am also really confused about whether Howard is the baby's father or not (I hope he is, but this Larry dude is pretty convinced that he is the daddy). Like I said up top, it is crazy but I cannot look away!\n\nShe's just very confused..she's going through the worst time of her life and you can't expect her to make rational decisions. Heck, Daniel's death probably hasn't even fully sunk in yet...and I reckon a lot of it is to get back at Larry who is being a complete assweed."
