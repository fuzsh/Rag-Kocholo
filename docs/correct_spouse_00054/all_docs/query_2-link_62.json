        "text": "Anna Nicole Smith, who was born Vickie Lynn Hogan, was an American model, actress, and television personality.\n\nThe blonde beauty, who was famed for starting her career as a Playboy magazine centerfold in May 1992, died when she was just 39.\n\nIt wasn't until the mid nineties though – after her marriage to billionaire James Howard Marshall, who was 63 years her senior – that Anna shot to superstardom and garnered worldwide fame.\n\nBut her rise was met with demise when she was found unresponsive on February 8, 2007, with her death ruled as an accidental drug overdose of the sedative chloral hydrate.\n\nThe sedative that Anna had taken had become increasingly toxic when it was combined with other prescription drugs in her system - specifically four different benzodiazepines.\n\nBut before her tragic death, Anna had not long welcomed her second-born child, a baby girl.\n\nAnna Nicole welcomed daughter Dannielynn in 2006\n\nOn June 1, 2006, Anna announced she was pregnant, with her daughter Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern - as she was originally named - born on September 7 of that year.\n\nJust mere days after Dannielynn was born, Anna's 20-year-old son, Daniel Wayne Smith, died on September 10.\n\nDaniel died while he visited his mum and newborn baby sister, with an autopsy finding that he died from an accidental drug overdose.\n\nAnna welcomed her son with Billy Wayne Smith, whom she wed in 1984 before finding fame, while the father of Dannielynn wasn't clear at first.\n\nEmbroiled in a paternity row until death\n\nIn an interview on Larry King Live after the death of Daniel's death, an attorney, Howard K. Stern, said that he and Smith had been in a relationship for \"a very long time\", and claimed he was the father of Anna's daughter.\n\nEntertainment photographer Larry Birkhead also claimed that he was the Dannielynn's father and filed a lawsuit to establish paternity, despite the birth certificate from the Bahamas, where the baby was born, stating Howard as the father.\n\nDNA tests were then ordered to determine who the biological father of Anna's daughter was, with the paternity row spiraling as Anna dealt with her son's passing.\n\nReports say that Anna suffered from depression, mental health issues and drug abuse in the wake of her son's death, which would end up contributing to her own untimely death.\n\nAnna sadly died in February 2007, just months after welcoming her daughter, with the paternity row still ongoing.\n\nJust days after her passing, Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband, Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, said that he had had a 10-year-long affair with Smith and could potentially be the father of her daughter.\n\nWhile Alexander Denk, a former bodyguard and chef, also claimed that he had an affair with the beautiful blonde and could be the father.\n\nIn April 2007, a Bahamian judge ruled that DNA tests had established photographer Larry as the father of Anna's daughter.\n\nThe Playmate's last will and testament\n\nAnna had filed her will in July 2001 - before her daughter was born, or her son had died - with her leaving everything to Daniel\n\nIt is reported that Anna's last will and testament indicated her personal property valued at $10,000 and real estate property valued at $1.8 million, with a $1.1 million mortgage, at the time of her death.\n\nWith Larry raising Dannielynn, Anna's daughter had the potential to inherit several million dollars from the estate of Annie Nicole Smith’s second husband, billionaire James Howard Marshall.\n\nBut despite years of gruelling legal battles that went all the way to the Supreme Court and continued long after Anna had died, her daughter Dannielynn ended up with nothing, according to the statement at the end of Netflix's Anna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me film.\n\nWhere is Dannielynn today?\n\nDannielynn resided in Kentucky with her father since moving back to the US from the Bahamas when her biological father was confirmed as Larry.\n\nFollowing in her mum's footsteps, Dannielynn started modelling at just six years of age, with her appearing in a campaign for Guess Kids in 2013.\n\nAt the time, co-founder of the brand, Paul Marciano, said: \"Dannielynn has the same playful spirit that her mother had on a set.\"\n\nDannielynn shares an Instagram account with her father, which was wiped of photos ahead of the Netflix film being released.\n\nSharing a snap of the sea, Larry penned: \"Waiting for some of the waves to pass... then will return.\"\n\nAnna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me dropped onto Netflix on May 16 and is available to stream now.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook."
