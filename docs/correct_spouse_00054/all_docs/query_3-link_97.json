He married Virgie Mae Tabers on 22 Feb 1967. They had one child, Vickie, and divorced on 4 Nov 1969. (Wikipedia states that Vickie was their only child together.)\n\nDonald next married Wanda Atkinson who, as her daughter Donna describes, was \"completely psychotic\".

She was the third of four children for this couple. Her other three siblings, both before and after her, were all born in Travis County, but for some reason she was born in Ellis county. Melvin had both an uncle Virgil, and an aunt Virginia. Presumably \"Virgie\" was named for one of those two.\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Virgie became pregnant by a sixteen-year-old boy named David Luther Tacker (born 25 Feb 1949) and they had a child they named David Luther Tacker, Jr on 19 Jan 1966 in Harris County, who later became an FBI agent. David's parents were George William Tacker (1921-2001, died in Como, Texas) and Betty Jo Hardison. Other than David, George and Betty also had an older daughter Anita Marie Tacker born 23 Dec 1946 and a younger daughter Brenda Sue Tacker born 11 Jun 1950. On 19 Oct 1966 in San Jacinto County, George William Tacker and Paralee Allman were married. At this point, nine months after the birth of her son David, David's father George became Virgie's step-father.\n\nMany sites have reported that Virgie had an \"affair with her step-brother\", but as my research clearly shows, they were not step-siblings at the time she became pregnant, nor at the time of the birth of their child. It's entirely possible that her mother and step-father met because of this situation however. And that couple were married for almost four years.\n\nPrimary documents for 3\n\nTexas Birth Index 1903-1997 showing \"Virgie Mae Tabers, born 12 Jul 1951, Ellis County, Texas.
