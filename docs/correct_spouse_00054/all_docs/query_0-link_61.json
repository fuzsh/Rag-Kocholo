        "text": "Anna Nicole Smith's one-time lover, Howard K. Stern, has sold her home in Studio City, Calif., Zillow reported. UPDATE -- 1:50 p.m. EST -- Stern had the home on the market for $1.75 million, but it reportedly sold for $1.3 million.\n\nStern completed the deal along with Larry Birkhead, the biological father of Smith's daughter, Danielynn. Birkhead and Danielynn moved into the house after Smith's untimely death in 2007 and had been living in the home up until a year ago, Birkhead told us. In April 2011, Stern got a court order to transfer the home under his name, and he put the home on the market.\n\nNBCLosAngeles.com reports that the buyer is \"Rouzbeh Zoka, trustee of the Rouzbeh Zoka 2012 revocable trust. The trust has deposited $39,000 as part of the purchase price.\" The proceeds of the home, however, go to Danielynn, since she's the beneficiary of Smith's estate.\n\nThe Mediterranean-style two-story home features wrap-around balconies with a generous pool deck that overlooks the city lights of Studio City. The 4,700-square-foot home's interior has a dramatic entryway that showcases a giant painting of the late model. There's five bedrooms and 5.5 baths, wood and marble floors throughout, a living room with dual fireplaces and an open area on the bottom level for a gym.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story indicated that there was a feud between Howard K. Stern and Larry Birkhead around the sale of the home. We heard from Birkhead, who said that he helped orchestrate the deal with Stern and works with him on matters associated with Anna Nicole Smith's estate.\n\n%Gallery-176761%"
