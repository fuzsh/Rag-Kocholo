        "text": "Although I haven't heard one lawyer, judge, journalist, legal pundit or anyone else say so, Howard K. Stern's ethical behavior, as a lawyer, adds up to one of the worst kinds of nonprofessional behavior I've ever seen.\n\nAs a lawyer, I find the Anna Nicole Smith's case fascinating from this ethical point of view ... a perfect law school ethics exam question.\n\nThe answer would not be \"did Howard K. Stern commit malpractice?\" But, rather, \"How many pounds of thousand dollar bills should Dannie Lynn's Guardian Ad Litem be able to get from Stern's malpractice carrier.\n\nMost clients don't know ethical standards from egg salad.\n\nLawyers are taught those standards in law school and retaught about them in continuing legal education courses. That places lawyers, not clients, in the driver's seat about those decisions and even more so when \"driving\" a mentally disabled client around the legal system.\n\nLawyers should be disbarred as an example to others who take unfair advantage of clients who depend upon them to be ethical and do not know when their lawyers are not acting in that capacity. Actually, being shot at sunrise seems an even more appropriate sentence for a lawyer like Stern who took unfair advantage of Smith a mentally disabled client.\n\nStern was being supported by Anna Nicole Smith. He testified, in Florida, that they had an open sexual relationship for Smith's benefit. The lure of money, pure an simple, seems to be the reason Stern was so willing to put up with such a bizarre deal.\n\nNow Stern is being supported by his parents. Unless Stern is disabled, it seems one can conclude that, despite his great looks, his eligibility as a Don Juan bachelor, and his (former?) career as a very smart lawyer (smart as evidenced by his bankruptcy court tactics for Ms. Smith), he's actually just an ordinary gigolo, a complete adult child parasite, and a possible contributor to her death.\n\nLyndon Johnson once said, \"Don't spit in the soup. We all have to eat.\"\n\nHad Stern kept his pants on he would have had 20/20 vision to see what Smith needed as his client: a will to determine where she wanted to be buried (at a ripe old age or an unripe young one) and a DNA test so that she and her daughter would know paternal identity (for future medical reasons if for no other).\n\nBy engaging in a sexual relationship with Smith while she was his client, Stern spit into the ethical soup of Smith's life as well as her case. Now no one dead or alive involved can eat from it without having to clean out his spit... almost an impossibility.\n\nBeing a lawyer, Stern had undue influence over his client. In order to avoid the appearance of impropriety in such a situation, Stern had an ethical obligation to end the lawyer-client relationship before beginning a personal one with her.\n\nStern testified that he had no influence over Smith's drug habit and so he gave in to her needs. That was neither in her or her child's best interests. Stern's reasons seem to be his own addiction to the lure of sex and potential wealth if he gave in to Smith's needs, never thinking or caring that doing so might place her children (and then her child) into needs of their own that would never be met by their mother\n\nHe could have influenced her in a positive way rather than a way which was not at all helpful to he mental or physical well being.\n\nHad Stern kept his relationship professional, he could have influenced her to seek excellent medical and rehabilitative care. As her uncaring lover, rather than her caring lawyer, the compromising position in which he placed her (as well as himself and now her baby), completely clouded his thinking as to his fiduciary duty to her.\n\nIt also casts suspicion over his motives as a lawyer and as a lover... neither role done well, to put it mildly.\n\nHad Stern waited an appropriate amount of time to see Smith on a personal basis, and then even more time to have a sexual relationship with her, and in the interim made certain that she was well represented, Stern could have even had Smith name him executor of her estate (in Florida that would amount to a fee of about $12 million, married or not) and he could have become a wealthy man had they decided to marry.\n\nHad they married before Dannie Lynn was born, the law might have been inclined to deem Stern the father of Smith's baby. The multitudes scrambling for a place in the financial future of Smith's baby would be deemed just vultures circling.\n\nHad Stern kept his professionalism ethical, Smith would have been buried in the place she directed in her will, her child's father would now be identified or Stern would have been named the father and the Florida judge would not have been using his courtroom to audition for a TV show.\n\nThen there's the law.\n\nIt would be held in higher esteem than it is when idiots hijack it for their own greedy purposes.\n\nAudrey Biloon is a Savannah writer, radio talk-show host and lawyer."
