        "text": "LOS ANGELES - The final days of celebrity model Anna Nicole Smith were described in court Tuesday as being marked by illness and confusion.\n\nCalifornia Department of Justice investigator Danny Santiago testified that witnesses said Smith was unable to walk unassisted into a Florida hotel and was being kept in seclusion.\n\nThe testimony was presented in a preliminary hearing involving charges that Smith's former lawyer-boyfriend Howard K. Stern and two California doctors conspired to illegally provide Smith with controlled substances before her drug-overdose death in Florida at age 39.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Robert J. Perry, who will decide if there is enough evidence to send the case to trial, noted that the defendants have not been accused of killing Smith.\n\nPerry also questioned the relevance when prosecutor Renee Rose asked Santiago about Smith's cause of death.\n\n\"There is not a murder charge,\" Perry said. \"The cause of death is not an issue.\"\n\nStern, Dr. Sandeep Kapoor and Dr. Khristina Eroshevich have pleaded not guilty. Their attorneys have said they are undecided or unlikely to call defense witnesses during the preliminary hearing.\n\nSantiago's testimony was a summary of what law enforcement investigators had learned after Smith's fatal collapse in the hotel room on Feb. 8, 2007. He also identified prescription drugs found in the hotel room as the prosecutor showed pictures of bottles and hundreds of pills.\n\nSome of the prescriptions were in Stern's name, although some used an alternate spelling, Stearn, and some had been prescribed by Eroshevich, Santiago said.\n\nSmith's autopsy concluded she died of \"acute combined drug intoxication,\" and the drugs involved were chloral hydrate combined with Benadryl, clonazepam, diazepam and lorazepam.\n\nSantiago recounted a detective's description of Smith's arrival at the hotel on Feb. 5.\n\n\"He said she was being supported by Mr. Stern,\" Santiago said. \"He was holding her as they walked through the lobby. He said she wasn't her usual vivacious self. She seemed down and was possibly ill.\"\n\nSantiago said he was told Smith \"was so weak she could not sit up to drink liquids\" when she and Stern arrived\n\nHe also testified that Stern had told an investigator he had been giving Smith the children's electrolyte formula Pedialyte in a baby bottle and that she was so confused she asked where her baby was.\n\nStern told Smith the baby, Dannielynn, had remained in the Bahamas during their trip to Florida to buy a boat.\n\nStern also told investigators that Smith had complained of flu-like symptoms and was being treated with Tamiflu by Eroshevich, who had the suite next door, Santiago said.\n\nAt one point, Stern had to help Smith to the bathroom because she couldn't get there, the witness said.\n\nEroshevich at one point asked a hotel employee to call a doctor because she could not write prescriptions in Florida, but Stern called to cancel the request because they did not want any leaks about Smith's condition, Santiago said.\n\nSantiago said registered nurse Tasma Brighthaupt, the wife of Smith's bodyguard, was seated at her bedside at one point but did not notice Smith's lips were blue and her body was discoloring until someone else arrived and pointed it out. He said Brighthaupt thought Smith was sleeping.\n\nBy the time paramedics were called, he testified, the bodyguard had arrived and started CPR. Stern had left Smith that day to look at a boat, Santiago said.\n\nDuring some of the testimony, Stern sat forward in his courtroom chair with his head in his hands.\n\nStern is named in all 11 counts of the complaint. The doctors each face six counts, including conspiracy, and if convicted could be sentenced to as much as five years, eight months in prison. It was not clear what sentence Stern might face if convicted.\n\nSmith died in the midst of a long legal battle to collect millions of dollars from the estate of her late husband, J. Howard Marshall II, owner of Great Northern Oil Co. Smith was 26 when she wed the 89-year-old tycoon. They met while she was a topless dancer at a Texas strip club.\n\nThat battle is unresolved. The estate ultimately may go to Smith's daughter, now 3."
