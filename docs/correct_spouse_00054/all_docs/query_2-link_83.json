        "text": "Undertakers have thawed Anna Nicole Smith’s delicate body, placed a dainty tiara on her head, wrapped her in a frilly designer gown and placed her billionaire husband’s ashes in her hands in preparation for today’s funeral.\n\nA police escort was to have accompanied Smith’s body from a Florida morgue at the crack of dawn before a flight to the Bahamas for services that’ll look more like a pro-wrestling match than a grim memorial. Even Hulk Hogan will attend.\n\n“It will be something very beautiful, very private, very over the top and very pink,” said Patrik Simpson, who’s organizing the funeral.\n\nMortuary workers feverishly worked on Smith’s unfrozen body last night, applying makeup and special embalming cream that smoothes decayed flesh, Broward County Medical Examiner Dr. Joshua Perper said.\n\nA Florida judge ruled last week that Smith should be buried in Nassau next to her son, Daniel Smith. The funeral is under the control of a court-appointed lawyer who represents Smith’s baby, Dannielynn.\n\nSmith has been stored in an airtight refrigerated drawer that morgue workers were told to keep shut because her loved ones want an open casket, and any amount of oxygen could damage the remains.\n\nThe open-casket decision will be a last-moment call by Dannielynn’s lawyer, Richard Milstein, Perper said.\n\nEven as embalmers dressed Smith for her final performance, onlookers jockeyed for their final cut of the model’s sad story.\n\nWorkers for “Entertainment Tonight” – which has exclusively interviewed Smith’s lawyer-boyfriend, Howard K. Stern – labored behind locked doors at Mount Horeb Church in Nassau in a sign that the show has secured exclusive video rights to the church memorial.\n\nStern, photographer Larry Birkhead and her estranged mom, Virgie Arthur – who have waged legal war over Smith’s remains and the paternity of Dannielynn – were each allocated nine guests for the private graveside ceremony. Dannielynn will not be at the funeral, according to “ET.”\n\nA British news agency has locked up exclusive photo rights to the burial.\n\nEven owners of church property are cashing in, charging $5,000 for each TV satellite dish beaming out live video from their parking lot and $2,000 for each still photographer.\n\nInvited guests expected to attend today include: professional wrestler and fellow reality-TV star Hogan;, Smith’s brother, sister and aunt; Smith’s dress designer, Pol’ Atteu; the dressmaker’s partner; Stern’s sister; Smith’s estate lawyer; and her pal Denise James\n\nThe Hulkster is a friend of Stern’s, according to Arthur’s spokesman, David Leigh. “She’s [Arthur] exhausted, she’s exasperated,” said Leigh, who plans to pen a book about the family. “But she decided it’s time to move on and commit to the memorial for her child.”\n\nPink flowers, a favorite of Smith’s, will be liberally spread throughout the ceremonies, organizers said. Each mourner will be given a pink rose to remember Anna and a red rose in honor of Daniel.\n\nJoe Nichols, a country-music singer who met Smith once at a 2005 show at the Grand Ole Opry, is slated to perform two songs at the church.\n\nPictures of friends and an urn containing half of late husband J. Howard Marshall’s ashes are set to be sealed in Smith’s casket before it’s lowered into the earth, according to “ET.”"
