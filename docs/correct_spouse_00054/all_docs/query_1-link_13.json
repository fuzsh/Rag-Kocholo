        "text": "First of all, I do not think Anna and Howard k ever had a physical relationship. If you ever watched her reality show on E- she may have screwed everyone else---but not Howard. She would often get mad at him and tell him his problem was he needed to get some so he wouldnt be so bitchy.\n\nBut for some reason he was always there. She was his one and only client. He could have made major bucks being a lawyer, but instead chose to suck off of her and wait on the big settlement. He had his eye on more than just the fee he would receive.\n\nWhy the problem with Birkhead? Well what do you think would happen to Howard if they got serious? Do you think he would still sleep on the couch. Howard knew he had to do something to keep her out of a committed relationship that might lead to marriage. It was o.k for her to screw around , but when she got a serious relationship, this threatened his free ride.\n\nThe one common denominator in this is methodone. It was in the house, administered by howard- by his own admission and while she was pregnant. Anna did not drive. Others went on pharmacy trips for her , etc. Daniel was known not to do drugs and even be on his moms case a lot for drug use. He was a straight A student. Maybe he was on a rx antidepressant, but would not be on methadone. A witness told police that Howard flushed drugs down the toilet after Daniel died.\n\nThe same witness also testified that Anna told him Larry birkhead was the father, but she wanted to take him out of her life and the babys. She asked his advice on where she could move so he could not have any rights. The freind suggested the Bahamas ,because they legally consider the name on the birth cert. This is the only reason she went. She went expressly for this reason.\n\nI think Howard had her so drugged up so he could call all the shots. The whole time she was pregnant, noone but Larry was ever even mentioned as the father until they broke up. He was there for everything.\n\nMaybe a drug addict does need to make the choice for themselves, but someone sneaking in a duffle bag full of drugs while a pregnant woman is detoxing? What drug addict could fight and deal with that?\n\nAnother thing- HKS contradicted hisself several times on the stand. First- he said anna talked about death since her met her . he said she thought she would die young and was obsessed about death. He also said she thought she would did giving birth. She tried to kill herself just two weeks prior.YET- when asked why she didnt change the will since Dannielyn was born (after all he was her attorney) and provide for spouses, children , etc.-Howard stern said \"Anna didnt think she would die- and I didnt think she was going to die.\"\n\nWhat? This is her attorney who helps direct and prepare wills . He doesnt think a new will is a good idea for a suicidal drug addict that talked about dying all the time? WEIRD\n\nIf any of you visit TMZ.com , you will see that HKS has all but conceded Larry is the father--- but he wants to negotiate and let Larry have his child, if he gets the other Bahamian house and yaught- and get this---- stays the legal trustee over Danielynn. A man that does not work wants control over this childs inheritance.Basically, he is saying Larry Birkhead could buy his own baby.\n\nThis is all definitly motive. Did anyone see the clown tape? Watch in on www.tmz.com Anna is high out of her mind and 8 mo pregnant, and howard is taping her in clown makup and telling her \"this footage is gonna be worth a lot of money\"\n\nBTW, other than in court, HKS is obviously stoned out of his mind half the time.After Danny died he did the interview on larry king. He was like he is most of the time. Eyes bulging and red, constant slurred speach. Anna was not the only one doing methadone. The court needs to order a drug test for Howard Stern . Social services should step in.\n\nThis child was living in a household where methadone is just sitting in the fridge. But not groceries of any kind. Other than slim fast. This child has no chance in a home like this.\n\nI dont think howard loved her. I think she was his cash cow. She needed someone though to help her get things that other assistants would probably not do. But she really thought as her friend, he could manipulate her into taking whatever her wanted. It really is a perfect idea. Daniel was the only heir-- now he is gone . Now Dannielynn. Since anna is dead this is the only heir, and because of the Bahamian law which I am sure, Howard the lawyer researched, he could become instant daddy legally, and if Anna died- father of the only heir.\n\nI think he talked a drugged and dazed anna into a ceremony. He probably scared her and said, look, if he is the father he could get custody and even the money. I am sure that is why they did a commitment ceremony to make it look legit. But Anna could have legally married him just as easily but didnt. She did not want to. She just wanted to stage this with howard thinking she was being smart protecting her assets from anyone claiming paternity. She trusted howard enough to not be worried with him having this title as father. She never thought he would hurt her.\n\nIf HKS did not kill her through homicide, he at least contributed to her death . And there is no doubt, he is all about the money. Her body wasnt even cold yet and he let ET fly with him and do this sickening interview with him holding the baby. He got HUGE bucks for this. He supposedly is her current lover, but is able to do interviews and make big $$ hours later?\n\nI think that if the Bahamas will not enforce DNA testing, then Americans should boycott the Bahamas. This baby wont be a baby for long. She is growing up and Birkhead is missing things he will never get back. His child is in a drug den and noone will help him.\n\nI seize here the opportunity to express myself on the late Anna Nicole Smith.\n\nTo me the whole story is a can of worms.\n\nJ have no idea whether H Stern played a part in her death. But many questions come to mind...\n\nWhat part played Anna in her son's involvement with drugs?\n\nAs she was so obviously distressed after her son's death, how come Stern didn't get her to seek professional help to deal with it and with her own drug problem?\n\nHow come her mother didn't try to reconciliate with Anna after Daniel's death or/and when Dannielynn was born?\n\nHow come no one in Anna Nicole entourage tried to help her with her sorrow and addictions?\n\nHow come no one says \"I love Dannielynn and want to bring her up\" instead of just insisting \"I am the father\"...\n\nThrough this whole sorry business, it seems to me Annna Nicole was viewed and used as a way to make money... Seems people cared only about her public image not about the human being. I think she led a life too big for her, she was probably not very bright and badly armed to deal with the medias and their rendering of her image.\n\nI see her as an overgrown Barbie doll, pathetically trying to deal with the real world...\n\nWe should now let her rest in peace, whereeve that might be, but at least alongside her son.\n\nAnd I deeply wish that little girl will end up with a father that will love her for what she is and not for the potential fortune she might one day inherit...\n\nI believe we have the stars and the governements we deserve....\n\nOur actual stars (incessantly coming in and out of rehab, divorcing and remarrying...) and politicians (thinking only of making America richer and considering all human beings expendable...) don't reflect a very good image of the American people to say the list.....\n\nWhen are we going to go for real values????????"
