        "text": "AFTER the untimely death of model Anna Nicole Smith, her dating life intrigued fans.\n\nBut one man stands out due to his involvement with multiple legal disputes, a child and a paternity battle - Howard K Stern.\n\nWho is Howard K Stern?\n\nHoward K Stern is an attorney from Los Angeles, California.\n\nBorn on November 29, 1968, he attended school at UCLA, the University of California Berkeley, and later went to law school at the UCLA School of Law.\n\nHe gained fame after dating model and Playboy cover girl Anna Nicole Smith in the early 2000s.\n\nWhen did Howard K Stern meet Anna Nicole Smith?\n\nHoward and Anna Nicole met after the death of Anna's billionaire tycoon husband J. Howard Marshall.\n\nShe hired him as legal counsel while she sued his sons for part of his estate, after she was left out.\n\nThe two became close and he even appeared on her reality show between 2002 and 2004.\n\nHe made headlines after her death while embroiled in a bitter paternity battle with Larry Birkhead over Anna's daughter Dannielynn.\n\nHe eventually lost custody after Birkhead was revealed to be the father.\n\nWhat is Howard K Stern's net worth?\n\nHoward is estimated to be worth $500,000 as of 2023.\n\nIn addition to being a lawyer in Los Angeles, Howard also ran a talent agency called Hot Smoochie Lips.\n\nHis net worth is thought to have increased after \"marrying\" Anna Nicole in September 2006, only a few months before she would die.\n\nWhere is Howard K Stern now?\n\nAs of May 2023, Howard still resides in Los Angeles, where he practices law at the Public Defender's Office.\n\nHe's stayed out of the spotlight after years of accusations related to Anna Nicole's death, of which many claim he provided the drugs.\n\nHoward was charged with conspiracy to prescribe, administer, and dispense controlled substances to an addict.\n\nHe was later acquitted of all charges.\n\nIs Howard K Stern married and does he have children?\n\nHoward and Anna Nicole were never legally married, though they did have an intimate ring exchanging ceremony in the Bahamas in 2006.\n\nSince Anna Nicole's death, he's remained under the radar and does not have any children, after the paternity debacle with Larry Birkhead.\n\nHe appears to have remained unmarried since her death, and if he has married, it's remained private."
