        "text": "California Attorney General Jerry Brown took to the podium Friday to describe Anna Nicole Smith’s lawyer-turned-boyfriend Howard K. Stern as the “principal enabler” that allowed model and tabloid fixture to acquire thousands of prescription pills in the months before her shocking death by overdose.\n\nStern and Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor were each charged by Los Angeles County prosecutors Thursday with three counts of conspiracy. The charges followed a two-year probe by the attorney general, state medical and insurance officials and the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\n“What we have in this case is a conspiracy among three individuals,” Brown said during a news conference Friday ion Sacramento. “Howard K Stern is the principal enabler, and Dr. Eroshevich and Dr. Kapoor are prescribing drugs excessively to a known addict and using false and fictitious names, all in violation of the law and all in furtherance of a conspiracy.”\n\nIn addition to conspiracy, the trio face charges including unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and prescribing, administering or dispensing a controlled substance to an addict. Stern faces six felony counts and the doctors face seven each.\n\nSmith’s life had become a collage of wild living and overindulgence by the time she died Feb. 8, 2007, in Florida. At the same time, she was embroiled in a battle to inherit millions of dollars from her late billionaire husband’s estate, and her own son Daniel had died of an accidental drug overdose shortly after she gave birth to a girl. Daniel Smith’s death has not been linked to this investigation.\n\nAsked what may have been the motive for the alleged conspiracy, Brown suggested the potent allure of wealth and glamour.\n\n“There’s a certain psychic gain here, part of the glitz and the celebrity and the power. There’s a lot of money floating around,” he said. “Is it self-indulgence? Is it some power trip? Is it just getting some contact high off of celebrity? That remains to be seen.”\n\nStern and Kapoor turned themselves in Thursday night and each posted $20,000 bond. Eroshevich was expected to surrender Monday.\n\nNO CHRIS BROWN/RIHANNA DUET AFTER ALL: People magazine reported Friday that, contrary to its own earlier stories, Chris Brown and Rihanna have not recorded a duet together. People.com on Friday quoted a source in Brown’s recording studio as insisting that no such song exists.\n\nThe source said the false reports were likely due to vocal tracks Brown and Rihanna recorded together last summer on a demo tape for a song titled “Bad Girl,” about a vapid woman who spends a lot of money on designer clothes (why didn’t they just c all it “Paris Hilton?”). The song was later recorded by the Pussycat Dolls for the “Confessions of a Shopaholic” soundtrack. Reportedly, Rihanna’s vocal tracks were leaked to the Web in January, and have been making the Internet rounds, giving rise to the idea that she was working on a new song.\n\nBrown faces two felony counts for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend Rihanna on Feb. 8. Despite the severity of the alleged beating, Rihanna has apparently reconciled with Brown.\n\nTHE OTHER LOVE SHOW DROPS?: Jamie Kennedy acknowledged Friday that, yes, he is a homewrecking swine.\n\nWell, actually, he didn’t acknowledge that. But he did admit on Ryan Seacrest’s radio show that he’s dating “Ghost Whisperer” co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt.\n\nThe romance has been rumored since Hewitt abruptly nixed her engagement to Ross McCall earlier this year. In fact the romance was rumored as the reason why Hewitt broke things off in such a hurry.\n\nHewitt and Kennedy previously denied any romance. But on Friday, Kennedy was gushing like a broken fire hydrant.\n\n“We’re more than dating … we’re more than in love,” he said, before getting totally icky with a “Twilight” reference.\n\n“We have an intense connection,” he warbled on. “She’s my Bella. I don’t want to bite her neck, but I want her to live.”\n\nUgh!"
