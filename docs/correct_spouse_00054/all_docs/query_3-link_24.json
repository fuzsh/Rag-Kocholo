        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Anna Nicole Smith's lawyer-turned-boyfriend was the principal enabler in a conspiracy with two doctors to provide the \"known addict\" thousands of prescription pills in the months before she died of an overdose, California Attorney General Jerry Brown said Friday.\n\nHoward K. Stern and Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor were charged by Los Angeles County prosecutors after a two-year probe by the attorney general, state medical and insurance officials and the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\n\"What we have in this case is a conspiracy among three individuals,\" Brown told a news conference. \"Howard K Stern is the principal enabler, and Dr. Eroshevich and Dr. Kapoor are prescribing drugs excessively to a known addict and using false and fictitious names, all in violation of the law and all in furtherance of a conspiracy.\"\n\nIn addition to conspiracy, the charges filed Thursday include unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and prescribing, administering or dispensing a controlled substance to an addict. Stern faces six felony counts and the doctors face seven each. Each count carries a potential sentence of three years, Brown said.\n\nSmith's life had become a tabloid fixture by the time she died Feb. 8, 2007, in Florida. Embroiled in a battle to inherit millions of dollars from her late billionaire husband's estate, her own son had died shortly after she gave birth to a girl.\n\nAsked what may have been the motive for the alleged conspiracy, Brown suggested the potent allure of wealth and glamour.\n\n\"There's a certain psychic gain here, part of the glitz and the celebrity and the power. There's a lot of money floating around,\" he said.\n\n\"Is it self-indulgence? Is it some power trip? Is it just getting some contact high off of celebrity? That remains to be seen.\"\n\nStern and Kapoor turned themselves in Thursday night and each posted $20,000 bond. Eroshevich was expected to surrender Monday.\n\nHer attorney, Adam Braun, acknowledged Eroshevich wrote some of the prescriptions using fictitious names for Smith, but asserted it was for privacy reasons and not intended to commit fraud.\n\nBraun said Eroshevich began treating Smith in September 2006 when she suffered a nervous breakdown stemming from the death of her 20-year-old son, Daniel Smith, from an accidental drug overdose three days after his mother gave birth to a girl.\n\nBrown declined to comment when asked if there was a trail leading to Daniel Smith from doctors in California, nor did he comment on whether other individuals may face charges.\n\n\"We have given you the evidence that we think is ready for the prosecution,\" he said.\n\nEroshevich traveled several times over six months to the Bahamas, where Smith was living with Stern and wrote the prescriptions.\n\nThe criminal complaint also alleges Kapoor gave her excessive amounts of sleep aids, opiates, muscle relaxants and methadone-like drugs used to treat addiction, knowing she was an addict. Kapoor saw Smith in the spring of 2006 when she was treated at a Los Angeles County hospital for opiate withdrawal and prenatal care for the pregnancy of her daughter Dannielynn, according to the complaint.\n\nStern's attorney L. Lin Wood said he anticipated releasing a statement about the case sometime Friday. Kapoor's attorney did not return a message from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nSmith was found unconscious in her room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino near Hollywood, Fla. The former Playboy centerfold and Guess jeans model died the same day at a hospital. Her death was ruled an accidental drug overdose.\n\nAside from her time in the pages of Playboy, Smith gained notoriety for her marriage to J. Howard Marshall II, the Texas oil billionaire 63 years her senior whom she met while dancing at a Houston club. The pair married in 1994; she was 26, he was 89, and Marshall died the following year.\n\nIn 2002, Smith debuted her own reality TV show — the tagline for which was \"she's so outrageous\" — in which cameras followed her through her daily life, often showing her in incoherent states. The star struggled with her weight and in 2003 became a spokeswoman for TrimSpa diet pills.\n\nBrown, who is contemplating a run for governor next year, used his time at the podium to denounce abuse of prescription drugs.\n\n\"Doctors do not have a license to pump innocent and often vulnerable people full of dangerous chemicals,\" he said. \"These cocktails of methadone and antidepressants and sleeping pills and Xanax — you put all that into a cocktail, it explodes.\""
