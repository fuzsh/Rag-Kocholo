        "text": "The Valley star Jesse Lally has revealed a surprising link to late Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith.\n\n“I met her,” he told Andy Cohen during a May 21 appearance on Watch What Happens Live. “[We] did a photoshoot for TrimSpa in Miami, and we remained friends for, like, a year and a half.”\n\nThe commercial, filmed in the early 2000s, claimed that Anna had lost more than 69 pounds with the help of the dietary supplement. In the ad, Anna and Jesse rolled around on the beach together and frolicked in the water. He also carried her and kissed her neck.\n\n“Keeping it classy” with Anna Nicole Smith\n\nJesse was a New York model before going into luxury real estate in Los Angeles. Anna was a spokesperson for TrimSpa from 2003 until her death in 2007. Jesse shared a December 2013 Instagram post from the shoot of the pair posing with their tongues out in matching white bathrobes. “#Tbt keeping it classy with #annanicolesmith,” he captioned the throwback.\n\nIn addition to her successful career as a model and the 1993 Playmate of the Year, Anna was famous for her second marriage to billionaire J. Howard Marshall, who was 63 years her senior. A year later when Marshall passed in 1995 at the age of 90, Anna was accused of marrying Marshall for his money, which she vehemently denied.\n\nFollowing Anna’s death, ex-boyfriend Larry Birkhead sued Anna’s then live-in partner Howard K. Stern, listed on her infant daughter Dannielynn’s birth certificate as her father. After a high-profile legal battle, a paternity test proved that Birkhead was Dannielynn’s biological father, and he was granted custody. He also gained control of Anna’s financial estate, as Dannielynn is her only surviving child.\n\nIn 2020, Birkhead claimed that the public’s perception of his relationship with Anna Nicole wasn’t true.\n\n“People think it was, like, a one-night stand that I had with Anna,” he said at the time. “[They think] I got lucky and won this DNA lottery, when it was, like, a two-year relationship with, admittedly, highs and lows. But it was a crazy love story.”\n\nThe Valley continues Tuesdays at 9/8c on Bravo."
