        "text": "The medieval rock relief known as The Madara Horse Rider is located above the modern village of Madara, 15 km to the east of the city of Shumen. It is the only rock relief in Europe from the early medieval period, which is dated, according to the attendant inscriptions in Greek language, in the 8th century.\n\nThe Madara Horse Rider was documented and described for the first time in 1872 by the Hungarian explorer of the Bulgarian lands Felix Kanitz.\n\nIn 1979 the Madara Horse Rider was included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List. The main challenges for the preservation of the rock relief are related to natural phenomena, such as acid rains, temperature amplitudes, wind erosion, etc.\n\nThe cave is located in the eastern part of the Shumen plateau . It is about 300 meters and approximately 1,800 of them are available for visits by tourists. It is electrified by 1976 . Upon entering the cave you will be charmed . The cave was first reported in 1828 by the French geographer Barbier de Bocage . First serious study done in 1968 by the spelunkers from Shumen and Sofia . Then mapped 1,440 m. In 1971 K.Dimchev and Sn.Stancheva found for upstream and the cave becomes 1,800 m. In connection with public works A.Spasov in 1979 – 1980 makes detailed picture instrumental to the modern length of the object. The water source is captured for supply of Shumen in 1987 .\n\nIt Is protected as part of the park ” Shumen Plateau .”\n\nCavern Club in ” Madara Horseman ” continue studies and in 2003 opened new galleries in which the length of the cave ” grow ” up to 2716 meters .\n\nThe cave is located 1 km west of Shumen in the park ” Kioshkovete ” on the northeast slope of the plateau . The cave is upward , and two branched , with constantly flowing river . Length of water gallery is 882 meters . The most beautiful is the Great Hall . Its ceiling is richly decorated with thousands of different sized and colored stalactites, the smaller of which are milky white , but have a big brown. Between a stalactite and mimicking bulbs, carrots and more. From the cave entrance to the Great Hall of the displacement of the bottom of the cave is 13.5 m.\n\nFirst city, centre – that is the meaning of the name Pliska, which the founders of the First Bulgarian Kingdom gave to their capital in the 7th century. They selected a location where major trade routes intersected, whereas the lay of the land was perfect for animal husnabdry. Nowadays, thousands come here, to the place where Pliska once rose, out of a sense of curiosity, but also reverence for their forefathers. The Pliska national history and archaeology reserve lies just 2 kilometers from the modern town of Pliska and 29 from Shoumen; in 1970 it was declared a monument of culture. For decades the town’s ruins have been studied by prominent archaeologists from Bulgaria and abroad.\n\nThe first Bulgarian capital was Pliska. An incredibly interesting place if you’re into history. And even so if you just like to use your imagination at an ancient place. The same counts for Veliki Preslav, the second capital of the First Bulgarian Empire. Surprisingly, a lot of the site remains after the excavations. With the necessary renovations, we can now partly see what was once a city of over 3 square kilometres. Veliki Preslav was the Bulgarian capital from 893 to 972. Not too long, however the city really grew in this era. Even when Pliska was the capital, the city was already growing. The cities are actually quite near, at about 45 kilometres from each other.\n\nThe Eye is a breathtaking rock with an oval opening in the middle that resembles an eye. It is also known as The Ring. The Monastery of Kostadin is located in its inner part in an artificially enlarged cave. It is not a coincidence that the gorge of Osmar is called the valley of monasteries. Many cells, churches and tombs that form an interesting monastery complex dating back to the time of The Second Bulgarian Empire are hidden in its rocks.\n\nThis rock monastery is situated on the Shoumen plateau near village of Khan Krum, in the western slope of Kalugerovo Boaz. The monastery is reached by a spiral staircase carved in the rock, which in its end goes into a corridor.\n\nFor the rock was used a natural cave, which was further adapted and transformed for the needs of the monks. The temple has skillfully and precisely carved directly into the rock. The monastery church is different from other rock churches in the region because it has a “concha” (“concha” is a semicircular niche in the north and south walls of the temples, in Greek konché) . Besides the church there is another large hall, which probably was used as a bed-room.\n\nOvech Fortress or Provadiya Fortress is a stone fort situated near the town Provadia, Varna region . It is located 54 km west of Varna, 56 km east of Shumen, 90 km south-west of Dobrich and about 411 km north-east of the capital Sofia city.\n\nOvech is situated on a mountain plateau named “Kaleto”. It is ship-shaped and its head points south. It is surrounded from each side by 20 m high rocks. A narrow isthmus connects it to another plateau – Tabiite /the fortifications/ located north of “Kaleto”.\n\nThe fortress is known with several names in the historical annals. The oldest of them is Provat. Bulgarians call it Ovech and the Turks Tash hisar /translated from Turkish – stone fortress/. Archaelogical researches show that the fort was used from III century till the first decades of VII century and after thata from X-XI century till the end of XVII century.\n\nLater Ovech became the primary barrier against the invading troops towards Pliska, Preslav and Veliko Tarnovo.\n\nOvech fort acquired strategic importance during the Second Bulgarian Kingdom when it became an important administrative, cultural, religious and military center.\n\nThe Monastery of “Benedictine Sisters of Tuttsing” is the only active Catholic monastery in northeastern Bulgaria It is situated in the Tcarev Brod and is a part of the Catholic Diocese of Nikopol.\n\nThe Catholicism is not the main religion in Bulgaria, and the presence of the monastery at this location is because the fact in the end of XIX century Prince Ferdinand helped to his former German compatriots to settle here. In that way in the village was created large German community and in 1924 four German sisters Benedictine founded monastery after the initiative of Franz Krings, a monk from the “Order of Passion”.\n\nFrom the long times the monastery is famous for its healing salve made by the nurses and used to treat burns and skin diseases.\n\nNowadays the monastery is operating and there are living nuns from different countries – Bulgaria, Germany, Philippines and South Korea. Their activity is charity in the village and the region."
