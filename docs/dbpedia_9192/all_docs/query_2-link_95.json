        "text": "CHAPTER 5\n\nThe Ottoman Period: 1389–1878\n\nThe consolidation of Turkish sovereignty over Bulgaria provided its Jewish population with a measure of security and protection unmatched anywhere in Christian Europe. From a Jewish perspective, one might say that the conquest of Bulgaria came in the nick of time, for the convocation of the Holy Synod in Turnovo in 1360 was an unprecedented incident of state-sanctioned antisemitism, and one might conjecture that Bulgarians would have found it difficult to resist a European climate which was increasingly antisemitic.\n\nAntisemitism as practiced in Europe was not a universal phenomenon, and the attitude of the Ottoman Empire toward its minority populations was quite different from medieval Christianity’s attitude toward Jews and Moslems. In fact, the tables were turned: the Christians in Bulgaria were treated miserably, whereas the Jews were generally respected and valued, and were granted relative autonomy in the running of their own affairs. Unlike the Christians, who were largely illiterate peasants, the Jews could not only govern themselves efficiently, but their acumen in trade and diplomacy and their linguistic competence was of great benefit in linking the Empire in a comprehensive, cosmopolitan network.\n\nWhereas the Jews of Christian Europe were a despised religious minority, the Jews of the Ottoman Empire were, for the most part, a protected national minority. The millet system allowed them to exercise control over their own law, religion, language, and education. In exchange they were expected to respect Ottoman authority and pay special taxes.1 The Turks showed little interest in converting the subject populations to Islam, although many Bulgarians did so, due to the relative weakness of Christian tradition in the country and the benefits which were granted to Moslems.2 The Turks were content to bleed the peasants dry through taxation, and allowed the Jews to conduct their commerce for them.3\n\nIt is important to understand that the conquest of the Balkans by the Ottoman Empire was not seen by the Jews, whether in Greece, Bulgaria, or Serbia, as a national catastrophe. They did not share the sense of national loss experienced by the Christians, for their own nationality and identity were not threatened by the Turkish conquest. In fact, they have never had a dual identity, even when they gave their loyalty and even lives to the Bulgarian state. Asked whether she felt more Jewish or more Bulgarian in Israel, Zhanti Zohar replied: “Jewish, of course we felt we were Jews, how could it be otherwise? If you’re a Jew, can you be a Bulgarian? No, you can’t go and make something like this [makes sign of the cross]” (Zohar, p. 8). On the contrary, the Empire could grant Jews the continuity and security lacking so long on the Peninsula, and the institutionalized tolerance of the new regime must have been greeted with a collective sigh of relief.\n\nAt the time of the consolidation of the Turkish conquest, there were Jewish communities in Vidin, Nikopol, Silistra, Pleven, Sofia, Yambol, Philippopolis (Plovdiv), and Stara Zagora.4 Bulgarian Jewry as a distinct entity would cease to exist, and Bulgaria itself would have no autonomy for five centuries. Until the resurgence of national identity in the nineteenth century, Balkan Jewry under Ottoman rule can be regarded in general terms as a single social and cultural unit. There existed, however, certain regional differences. The Bulgarian communities, dominated by Romaniots, would be enlarged and diversified by a series of immigrations created by antisemitic activity in Europe reaching fever-pitch. As a result of the destruction of over two hundred Jewish communities within the Holy Roman Empire, inspired or rationalized by accusations that the Jews had caused the Black Plague (1348–1349), and increasing incidents of blood-libel accusations and anti-Jewish terror, a large group of refugees was created which was looking for a safe haven. A letter was sent to Bavaria, Moravia, and Hungary by three Jews who had previously fled persecution in France and Germany inviting these refugees to find shelter under the Sultan.5 After their gradual banishment from Bavaria in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, many Jews came to Bulgaria, founded a synagogue in Sofia, and Judeo-German was heard for a long time in the streets.6 An independent Ashkenazi synagogue existed in Sofia until the exodus of 1948, although most of the congregation was Sephardi.\n\nThe subsequent influx of Jews seeking sanctuary from Christian genocide would radically change the character of Balkan Jewry and would absorb both the Romaniots and Ashkenazim in its culture and language. In March of 1492, after a two-century long nightmare of persecution, degradation, forced conversion, and autos-da-fe, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castille issued edicts expelling all Jews from Spain. Three months later, between one hundred and one hundred fifty thousand still-professing Jews left the country. This was perhaps the most traumatic event in Jewish history between the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 C.E., and the Holocaust in our time.7\n\nIt was not an event which occurred in isolation, however, but the most severe and catastrophic of a series of expulsions which began early in the thirteenth century. In 1290, England expelled its Jews; in 1306, the Jews were exiled from the Royal Territories of France; during the fifteenth century, Jews were banned from all the major cities of Germany, with the exception of Frankfurt am Main; in 1498, the Jews of Portugal, including those who had fled from the Spanish expulsion six years earlier, were cast out; in 1501 this scenario was repeated in Provence, and in 1507 in the Kingdom of Naples. By the sixteenth century, the Jewish population had been forcibly shifted from west to east, and the two largest Jewries in the world resided in Poland and the Ottoman Empire.8\n\nIn contrast, this was a period of relative quiet in the Ottoman Empire, and skilled tradesmen and artisans were needed by the government. Sultan Bayazid is reported to have said, in regard to the expulsions from Spain: “They say that Ferdinand of Spain is a wise king, yet he has impoverished his own land in order to enrich mine.”9 According to Tamir:\n\nFour separate waves of exiles reached the Bulgarian lands, entering—presumably after 1497—via Salonika, Constantinople, Adrianople, and Ragusa. The first and second contingents settled in Nikopol, while a third chose Sofia. The fourth allegedly arrived later, sometime between 1499 and 1540, establishing the ‘Holy Aragon Congregation’ in Plovdiv. To the existing Romaniot and Ashkenazi synagogues, a third type, the Sephardi, was now added, enriching with its own customs and ritual the already variegated milieu. In time a uniform, well-organized, cohesive community would arise, which would communicate in the Hispanic language of the Iberian Jews while utilizing the creative forces of all its component parts.10\n\nThe main cities of Sephardi settlement were Constantinople and Salonika, the latter of which would become the center of Jewish life and scholarship in Europe and would eventually boast a Jewish majority.11\n\nThere were divisions even within the Sephardi community of Bulgaria, and synagogues were established by communities of common origin from regions or even cities in Iberia. But the size and strength of the Sephardi community very soon absorbed the indigenous Romaniots and Ashkenazim, and Ladino became the language of the Jews of the Balkans. Despite the periodic influx of Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in other parts of Europe (especially Italy and Hungary), Judeo-Spanish culture dominated the Jewish communities of the Balkan Peninsula until the advent of nationalism in the area in the nineteenth century. It would also serve to differentiate them from the Ashkenazim dominant in the rest of Europe.\n\nThe vast majority of Jews lived in the cities, and made their livings as merchants and artisans. They had little contact with the Bulgarians, who were mostly peasant vassals of the Turkish feudal lords and their Bulgarian lackeys. Turkish, Greek, and Ladino were the languages of trade, and Hebrew the language of scholarship and religion. Few Jews, therefore, had any use for the Bulgarian language, which degenerated during five centuries of intellectual neglect.\n\nDuring this period the Jews of Bulgaria began a tradition of communal cohesion and cooperation which would develop and endure until the mass immigration to Israel beginning in 1949. In 1640 a single rabbi was appointed for all of the communities; Sephardi, Ashkenazi, and Romaniot.12 The Jews governed themselves according to Halakhah, and were largely independent of the surrounding gentile communities.\n\nBulgarian cities, in which almost all of the Jews lived, were multiethnic, and many had a Turkish majority. This fact is of great importance, not only for the development of Bulgarian Jewry, but for the development of Bulgarian society as well. This result of Ottoman sovereignty would play a role in shaping Bulgarian attitudes, and would continue to have an impact on shaping Bulgarian-Jewish relations even after independence. As Nikolai Todorov, Bulgarian historian, states: “we cannot but draw attention to the fact that for centuries the Bulgarians lived in towns with mixed populations. This has been an important element in the formation of the Bulgarian national consciousness and it is perhaps one explanation for the absence of an awareness of exclusiveness and national egoism in the formation of the Bulgarian national consciousness.”13\n\nThe sixteenth century saw the flowering of Jewish culture and community in the Balkans, and has even been termed the “Golden Age of Balkan Sephardim.”14 It was also the century in which the Ottoman Empire reached the height of its power, and saw the beginning of its long and agonizing decline. This correspondence and interdependence of fortunes further demonstrates the confluence of Ottoman and Jewish interests in the area: “the Sephardic Jews were most productive in the sixteenth century because they came from a country burgeoning with creative sap and entered a region under the dominance of a power at the zenith of its conquests.”15 Yet, as we shall see, the final expulsion of the Turks from Bulgaria would allow startlingly progressive developments in which the Jews united their fortunes with the Bulgarians until they themselves could realize national independence.\n\nOf all the subject peoples of the Empire, the Jews have left the most complete account of their communal life. Records of the communal organizations, haskamot (ordinances), and Responsa are our chief sources of information, as well as the records of the religious courts, Batei Din, which regulated relations among Jews. According to Tamir, the pictures of Jewish life obtained from these documents during this period “do not even remotely resemble the martyrologies reflected in Jewish documents of the same period from Central and Western Europe, where Jews were nearly always heartily disliked. . . . The general picture of Jewish life and legislation painted by these documents is one of continuity, relative stability, and prosperity by the standards of the age.”16\n\nBulgaria during the Ottoman period is often described by writers and historians as in hibernation, and in many ways this characterization is correct. The overwhelmingly peasant population was subject to oppressive taxation and a feudal system which led to almost total intellectual, political, and economic stagnation.17 Even those Bulgarians in the region’s mixed cities did not assert themselves creatively, and Bulgarian Jewry was affected by this national apathy, although it always maintained a vigorous communal and economic life. During the “Golden Age,” Bulgarian Jewry participated only marginally in the creative activity of the Balkan Jews. The rising frequency of military conflict along the Empire’s Danubian border would have an increasingly disruptive effect on Jewish life. Yet as the Jewish communities in Bulgaria were self-governing, wealthier than the peasant population, and had the means of making a livelihood which was not rooted directly in the soil, they often suffered less from the destructive force of incursions from the North than did the Bulgarian peasantry. On the other hand, their Jewishness could enrage the invaders and call down upon them antisemitic wrath, in addition to the usual pillage and plunder.\n\nThe most important seats of Jewish learning and rabbinical productivity in Bulgaria were Nikopol, until the seventeenth century, and Vidin, until the nineteenth. As Danube ports, these cities were important economic centers and, as a result, boasted proportionally large Jewish communities. For this reason also, they became primary targets for the sultan’s European foes, and suffered repeated destruction. We may speculate that with the increasingly tenuous nature of life on the northern border, Jews began to establish themselves in greater numbers in the cities of the interior. Isidor Toliko, born to one of the few Jewish families remaining in Nikopol at the beginning of this century, was not unaware of his city’s history. He proudly related that:\n\nNikopol was a very ancient city, with very ancient roots in Judaism.18 Two hundred years before the period when I lived there, it was a blossoming city for Jewry. Don’t forget, it’s a port on the Danube. A very important cross-roads. It had connections with the Western World, for trade and culture was quite developed. After the development of technology, the trains and everything, it lost its importance, became economically depressed, and of course the Jews emigrated to different places. (Toliko, p. 1)\n\nBy the end of the sixteenth century, Bulgarian Jewry was threatened both from within the Empire and without. With the decline of Ottoman power came a decline in Ottoman tolerance, and several discriminatory decrees were issued restricting Jewish rights. In 1592 and 1598, Prince Michael of Wallachia crossed the Danube and laid waste Vidin, Pleven, and Nikopol. Nikopol was burned to the ground, in Vidin two synagogues were destroyed, and both communities were decimated.19 These communities recovered their losses only later, with the large influx of Jews fleeing the Chmielnicki massacres in Poland (1648–1649), which also added to the Ashkenazi population of the country. These immigrants too would quickly assimilate with their Sephardi brethren.\n\nBy the second half of the seventeenth century, the rule of law within the Empire had become so corrupt, and the local governments so contemptible, that a general malaise set in among the Jews of the Balkans that we might characterize as a national depression. In order to check the increasing military pressure on his borders, the sultan raised taxes to fund his militia, and this, combined with corruption, inefficiency, and apathy made life increasingly difficult. To the external military threat and the internal strife and oppression was added a danger from within, as Jews turned to the false messiah, Shabbatai Zevi, for redemption. The spiritual devastation which resulted for the Jews of the Balkans marks a turning point in their history. Tamir writes:\n\nIt is generally viewed as the chief cause of the precipitous deterioration of Jewish morale and the decline of Sephardi scholarship. Goaded with the promise of instant redemption, large numbers of Jews embraced Shabbetai Tsevi as the Messiah, but when he chose apostasy over death, abysmal depression (rather than a wholesome return to nationalism) ensued. The erstwhile cohesion of the communities, already challenged by Messianic agitation, completely cracked, and community life came to a standstill. With the level of education steeply dropping, knowledge of Hebrew became the esoteric distinction of a small rabbinical class, and religious observance lost its meaning. . . . Grimly pessimistic over Turkish obscurantism, on the one hand, and Christian devastation, on the other, the Jews turned to mysticism for solace. The trend was markedly stronger in Solonica and Constantinople than in Bulgaria proper.20\n\nThere appear to be two possible explanations for the relative lack of Messianic fervor among the Jews of Bulgaria. As noted earlier, Bulgaria was a backwater of the Ottoman Empire, and all intellectual and spiritual innovations seem to have reached Bulgaria in diluted form. This held true for Bulgarian Jewry as well, so that we may conjecture that the Messianism which rocked Salonika and Constantinople would follow this pattern and affect the Jewish communities in Bulgaria with lesser force. Secondly, it was noted at the beginning of this chapter that the Bulgarians themselves seldom showed much enthusiasm for abstract spiritual matters, and took up the cause of both Christianity and Islam with less than wild abandon. This was pointed out as being one of the reasons for the relative lack of religiously inspired Judeophobia, and we might conjecture that this attitude affected Bulgaria’s Jews as well. Thus, one can attribute the comparative lack of enthusiasm for Shabbatianism to a religious moderation which seems to have been one of the characteristics of Bulgaria’s inhabitants, both Jewish and gentile.\n\nThe confluence of neo-Messianism and the beginning of Ottoman decline affected Jewish intellectual and communal life to such an extent that it never fully recovered, and the bright star of the Balkan Sephardim gradually faded into obscurity. The two centuries between the appearance Shabbatai Zevi and the liberation of Bulgaria from Turkish rule saw the atrophy of Jewish life in the Balkans, especially in matters cultural and spiritual. The lively intellectual atmosphere which had thrived for centuries in Salonika and Constantinople became dull and mechanistic, and Bulgarian Jewry, always on the fringes, sank further into anonymity. By the end of the Ottoman period, Jewish education, which is the very core of Jewish national life, was described as follows:\n\nThe Jews of the Ottoman Empire were permitted to do business throughout the Empire, and dealt more with matters of substance than of spirit. That influenced the education of boys. The Rabbi would enter a few youths into his seminary and teach reading and writing: I never heard from the elders of the community that they had studied Talmud. Most would be satisfied with learning prayers and the portion of the week with Ladino translation. Girls were prohibited from all study. Ignorance reigned supreme.21\n\nThis spiritual and educational decline created a vacuum in Jewish life which threatened the very existence of Balkan Jewry. The ways in which this vacuum was filled differed substantially among the various communities of the Empire, depending on differences in environment and historical, economic, political, and social circumstance. But Bulgarian Jewry filled this vacuum differently than the other Balkan Jewish communities, setting it on a unique course toward a surprising destiny. Whereas other communities continued to decay in the rubble of the Ottoman Empire, the Jews of Bulgaria chose to transform the very definition and course of Jewish existence, and infuse it with a new meaning and purpose. At the precise moment in history when Bulgarian Jewish life could no longer draw sustenance and the strength vital to its continuation from traditional sources, it found new wellsprings of inspiration—it reinterpreted and adapted itself to the realities of a new and rapidly changing world. Traditional Judaism was replaced by Jewish cultural, social, and political nationalism embodied in the Zionist movement, which became the creed of the Jews of Bulgaria who emerged from five centuries of Ottoman rule completely changed, strengthened, and revitalized."
