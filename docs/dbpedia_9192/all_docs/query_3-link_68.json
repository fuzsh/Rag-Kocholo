        "text": "Source: Archaeology in Bulgaria\n\nOctober 23, 2015\n\nAhead of the 830th anniversary of the founding of the Second Bulgarian Empire, the northern Bulgarian city of Veliko Tarnovo has opened for visitors and planned special events the restored St. Dimitar Solunksi (St. Demetrius of Thessaloniki) Church where 830 years ago local nobles Asen and Petar started an uprising against the Byzantine Empire leading to the resurrection of the Bulgarian state.\n\nThe St. Dimitar Solunski Church, a monument of culture restored in 1985 for the 800th anniversary of Asen and Petar’s Uprising based on the excavations of the preceding two original temples with the same name, will be opened from October 22 until November 8, 2015, which is the period when eventscelebrating the 830th anniversary since Asen and Petar’s Uprising will be held.\n\nExcept for the summer season, the church can be visited only if an appointment is booked in advance,Veliko Tarnovo Municipality says in a media release inviting people from all over Bulgaria andinternational tourists to visit the historical monument.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, when Veliko Tarnovo and all of Bulgaria will celebrate the 830th anniversary since the Uprising of Tsar Asen I and Tsar Petar IV, which restored the Bulgarian state in 1185 AD, after it had been conquered by the Byzantine Empire in 1018 AD.\n\n830 years ago the Uprising of Asen and Petar recorded one of the most glorious pages in Bulgaria’s medieval history.\n\nIt liberated Bulgaria from Byzantium after 167 years of Byzantine domination, and created the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185-1396/1422).\n\nThe Bulgarian boyars (nobles) Asen and Todor (Teodor) who led the Uprising became Tsar Asen I (r. 1187-1196) and Tsar Petar IV (r. 1186-1197).\n\nThey ruled as co-emperors; both of them were murdered, and were succeeded by their young brotherTsar Kaloyan (r. 1197-1207).\n\nThe Asen Dynasty (House of Asen) that they started ruled the Second Bulgarian Empire from 1185 until 1257 AD.\n\nTheir empire ruled territories from the Carpathian Mountains in the north to the Aegean and the Adriatic in the south (see the map below) restoring most, if not all, of the territorial, military and economic might of the First Bulgarian Empire (632/680-1018 AD).\n\nIt also spurred the intensive development of Bulgarian culture and literature that later led to theSecond Golden Age in the 14th century (the First Golden Age of Bulgarian culture having occurred in the 9th-10th century AD during the reigns of Knyaz Boris I (r. 852-889), Tsar Simeon I (r. 893-927), and Tsar Petar (r. 927-970).\n\nBackground Infonotes:\n\nThe St. Dimitar Solunski (St. Demetrius of Thessaloniki) Church in Bulgaria’s Veliko Tarnovo is arestored church based on the excavations of the original medieval church with the same name which existed there during the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185-1396 AD) with its capital in Tarnovgrad (Veliko Tarnovo).\n\nThe St. Dimitar Solunski Church is connected with the restoration of the medieval Bulgarian Empire,after in 1018 AD Byzantium had conquered most of the Bulgarian territory and destroyed the First Bulgarian Empire (632/680-1018 AD).\n\nAccording to Byzantine chronicler Niketas (Nicetas) Choniates (ca. 1155-1215 AD), the St. Dimitar Solunski Church in Veliko Tarnovo is where in 1185 AD, local boyars (nobles), brothers Asen and Todor (Teodor), who later took the name “Petar” after Tsar Petar I (r. 927-969 AD), becoming Petar IV,proclaimed the restoration of the Bulgarian state.\n\nThis is where they started their rebellion, known as the Uprising of Asen and Petar, against theByzantine Empire creating the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nLater the brothers became Tsar Asen I (r. 1187-1196) and Tsar Petar IV (r. 1186-1197).\n\nThey ruled as co-emperors; both of them were murdered, and were succeeded by their young brotherTsar Kaloyan (r. 1197-1207).\n\nThe restored St. Dimitar Solunski Church is located on the right bank of the Yantra River, at the foot of the northeastern slope of the Trapesitsa Hill, one of the two citadels of the medieval Bulgarian capital Tarnovgrad.\n\nIt was rebuilt near the ruins of the original church between 1977 and 1985 by Bulgarian architect Teofil Teofil based on the excavations of archaeologist Assoc. Prof. Yanka Nikolova and on other surviving historical monuments from the same period.\n\nThe temple is 16 meters long, and 8.5 meters wide. The restored church was opened as a museum in 1985 on the 800th anniversary since the Uprising of Asen and Petar and the liberation of the Bulgarian state from Byzantium.\n\nThe original medieval church St. Dimitar Solunski near the Trapesitsa Fortress was where the rulers from the the Asen Dynasty (House of Asen) ruling Bulgaria in 1185-1257 AD were crowned. It was the core of a monastery whose four large buildings were unearthed in the archaeological excavationsstarting in 1971.\n\nBoth the original church and the monastery were destroyed in the third quarter of the 13th century AD, possibly by an earthquake. In the 14th century, the site of the collapsed church was turned into aChristian cemetery that was in use until the 20th century. In the Christian necropolis there, thearchaeologists have found more than 500 funerals.\n\nIn the late 14th century, materials from the destroyed church were used to erect a new one nearby, on top of the ruins of the former southern monastery building. The new church was badly damaged in the 19th century, and was ultimately destroyed by an earthquake in 1913.\n\nOnly its apse with some original murals was preserved. There are two layers of preserved murals – the first from the time of the church’s construction, and the second – from the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century.\n\nThe original medieval church, the second church built in the 15th century, and the church restored in the 1970s-80s are named after St. Dimitar Solunski (St. Demetrius of Thessaloniki), a Christian martyr-saint who lived in Thessaloniki in the 3rd century AD. St. Dimitar Solunski was the patron saint of the Asen Dynasty that founded the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nAt the time of their Uprising, the boyar brothers Asen and Petar declared that the warrior St. Dimitar Solunski had deserted Thessaloniki, and had come to Tarnovgrad (Veliko Tarnovo) to aid their rebels.\n\nThe site of the St. Dimitar Solunski Church at the Trapesitsa Hill in Bulgaria’s Veliko Tarnovo was firstexcavated in 1906-1921 by the local archaeological society. The comprehensive excavations started in 1971 by Yanka Nikolova and Mirko Robov.\n\nThe archaeologists found that the original temple was a one-apse crossed-dome church with rich outside and inside decoration. The outside decoration was achieved by alternating layers of stone, mortar, and bricks in the church’s walls."
