This magazine celebrates a fif- teen-year journey, showcasing the remarkable programs and individuals that the Foundation has supported. These partnerships are visually conveyed by & â the ampersand â a symbol that represents commitment and connection. Selecting the content for this publication was challenging as we have been privileged to witness the dedication and passion of countless Bulgarians behind more than 1,000 projects. Each project represents a profound commit- ment to making a positive difference in com- munities throughout Bulgaria â from villages and towns to cities and the country at large â in areas such as education, healthcare, en- trepreneurship, science and innovation, the arts, cultural heritage, nature tourism, and rule of law. From my first visit to Bulgaria in the spring of 1992, I have been captivated by Bulgariansâ unwavering determination to create a better place to work, live, and raise families. Through Foundation grants, we have seen some of\n\ntheir inspired visions become reality. From the dozens of classroom renovations and perfor- mance spaces across the country to university lecture halls and museum restorations â the changes have been truly transformative. And, of course, the unmistakable aroma of freshly baked bread, seasoned with what I call Bulgar- iaâs âmagic salt,â adds a delicious, welcoming touch to every ribbon-cutting ceremony! As I travel through Bulgaria, I find myself im- mersed in its vibrant culture, rich history, and breathtaking natural beauty. Bicycling along the Danube, soaring over Belogradchik in a hot-air balloon, hiking through the Rhodope mountains, picking roses in the Rose Valley, marveling at the Bishopâs Basilica of Philip- popolis mosaics, and savoring homemade lyutenitsa at the annual Kurtovo Konare festi- val are just a few of my treasured experiences. Through tourism, we have the opportunity to make a difference, one journey at a time. To that end, ABF supports cultural heritage and nature tourism projects that have the power to transform and uplift communities and pre- serve cherished traditions.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nSupporting education opportunities equips young people with the skills to compete for quality jobs and nurtures the entrepreneurs, business leaders, and science innovators that will ensure Bulgaria has a bright future. None of these successes would matter without an environment of freedom and justice. That is why ABF supports independent media as well as civil society organizations focusing on judicial reform and anti-corruption. These organizations uncover how our money is spent and give us access to the truth, fostering an environment where innovation flourishes, cor- ruption diminishes, and societies blossom. 15 magazine is a tribute to the shared vision to make Bulgaria an even better place to build your future. It embodies the spirit of collabo- ration, determination, and innovation that has\n\ncharacterized our partnership, our &, with the incredible people of this country. I am excited to share this publication with you, and I hope it sparks inspiration and appreciation for the progress we â Bulgarians & Americans â have witnessed together. To our many partners and friends, to the ded- icated ABF team and board of directors, cur- rent and past, thank you for being part of this enriching and transformative journey. I look forward to continuing our collective efforts to create an even brighter future for Bulgaria. The story does continue.\n\nWarmest regards,\n\nNancy Schiller, President America for Bulgaria Foundation\n\n5\n\nBY BOAT, ON FOOT OR WHEELS: EXPLORE THE DANUBE (BUT BEWARE OF THE EELS)\n\nIts name is known the world over thanks to its lasting hold over popular culture: the Danube inspired one of the most recognizable pieces of music ever written, Johann Straussâs âThe Blue Danube Waltz,â entire painting and mu- sic styles, as well as books, movies, and even culinary specialties.\n\nplore. Just when you think you have gotten to know it, the river throws a marvelous sur- prise your way, particularly if you venture out of the grand cities and major natural parks. Both manmade and natural wonders await adventurers along the 2,850 km (1,770 miles) stretch of coastline from the Black Forest in Germany to Ukraineâs Black Sea coast, but for the riverâs best-kept secrets you would have to visit its right bank in Bulgaria.\n\nThe Danube is also an explorerâs heaven: the more you discover, the more there is to ex-\n\n6\n\nAncient and medieval fortresses, âmadâ for- ests, reedy lagoons teeming with wildlife, haunting monuments to socialist urban plan- ning, Europeâs oldest rock monasteries, kay- aking expeditions and feasts with the riverâs offerings, charming guesthouses and unfor- gettable encounters with locals, tucked-away museumsâthe Danubeâs Bulgarian stretch offers that and much more. You can even see the coastline through the eyes of an ancient Roman customs officer, me- dieval archer, or a prehistoric hunter-gatherer! The Danubeâs beauty is celebrated in the Bulgarian national anthem, and although far lesser known than âBlue Danube,â Bulgarian composer Diko Ilievâs âDanube Horoâ is a fitting tribute to the riverâs grandness. (Play it at your own risk: the piece may cause an uncontrollable urge to break into dance!) Recognizing the regionâs potential, the Amer- ica for Bulgaria Foundation invests in local initiatives promoting natural and cultural her- itage tourism in the countryâs Danube basin and all of the Bulgarian North. Some of the initiatives are already underway, so why not plan your next getaway along the âDanube so bright and blueâ? Kudelin, Vidin Region This village near the Bulgarian-Serbian border is known mainly for being a starting point for Dunav Ultra â a 460-mile cycling route connecting the Bulgarian Northwest with the Black Sea coast and running mostly along the\n\nlength of the Danube River. (Dunav is the Bul- garian word for Danube.) Route developer and entrepreneur Boris Begamov first traversed the route as a personal endurance challenge, reflected in the âultraâ part of its name: his goal was to cover the distance of nearly 460 miles in under 48 hours. The more he got to know the side roads, layered history, and di- verse communities along the river, however, the more captivated he became. This is why, over the past decade, he has been working to uncover the regionâs enormous tourism potential. Dunav Ultra is a recipient of an Innovation of the Year award from the Bulgarian Ministry of Tourism, and Dunav Ultraâs annual endurance challenge in September is an important part of Europeâs cycling events calendar.\n\nUncovering the 100 Dunav Ultra Sights will stimulate all your senses and take you on a unique journey through time and space.\n\n7\n\nAnd while cycling adventures along the route have a special charm, travelers can explore the region using their preferred mode of trans- portation. The Dunav Ultra app will guide explorers to the best places to stay and eat and all the natural and cultural sights worth exploring.\n\nboat. This will offer a unique vantage point for viewing popular sites such as the Baba Vida Fortress and New Europe Bridge and help you discover places known only to locals such as âNakedâ Island. Belogradchik Just over 50 km (30 miles) south of Vidin is the town of Belogradchik, of wondrous rock and fortress fame. For a birdâs-eye view of the Belogradchik Rocks and the ancient Kaleto Fortress (also known as Belogradchik For- tress), as well as Vidinâs major sights, rent a hot-air balloon ride with Adventure Center Belogradchik. Oryahovo Beautiful turn-of-the-century architecture in downtown Oryahovo bears witness to the townâs commercial and cultural importance at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Your exploration of this Danubian gem of a town wonât be complete without a visit to the Oryahovo History Museum. There you will learn about the townâs beginnings in Antiquity and its transformations over the centuries. Through the museumâs Echo of the Centuries initiative, you will get a taste of me- dieval life in the area: guided archery practice is offered to visitors to the Rock, a medieval fortress managed by the museum. To learn about the life and work of one of Bul- gariaâs most beloved composers (of âDanube Horoâ fame), be sure to pay a visit to the Diko Iliev Museum, which is a part of the Oryahovo History Museum complex.\n\nVidin Bulgariaâs northwesternmost city, Vidin, boasts centuries of history: it was in turn an ancient Celtic settlement, a fortified Roman town, one of the main cities in the medieval Bulgarian state, and the center of Osman Paz- vantogluâs breakaway state at the end of the eighteenth century. Nowadays, the city is home to Bulgariaâs best-preserved medieval fortress, Baba Vida, Pazvantogluâs mosque and library, many old Orthodox churches, the Vidin Synagogue, and a number of grand nineteenth- and twenti- eth-century residences. To make the most of your visit, pick up a guide from the Regional History Museum in Vidin and follow one of the suggested routes, or hire an escorted tour. You can also explore Vidin and its environs by\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFind out who Van Man is and why one of Chi- naâs most prestigious art institutes is named after a Bulgarian by visiting the museumâs newest permanent exhibition, Marin Varbanov â the Prince from Oryahovo. And while you are exploring the museumâs many treasures, purchase a copy of the book Window to Goodwill for a glimpse into Bulgar- iaâs long, proud history of philanthropy. Pro- ceeds from the book support local initiatives. Nikopol Despite its diminutive size, the town of Niko- pol boasts a proud name and a rich history. âThe City of Victoryâ (from Greek) has been a meeting point for Thracians, Greeks, Romans, Bulgarians, Slavs, Ottomans, and many others over the centuries. In the 1396 Battle of Nicop- olis, it became the site of the last large-scale crusade of the Middle Ages. Be sure to visit the medieval fortress and beautiful churches built in the style predomi- nant during the Second Bulgarian Kingdom, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The Fountain of Elijah, set in a tombstone and immortalizing the love of Fronton, a second-century Roman clerk, for his late wife, Elijah, is a must- see as well. Seventeen centuries later, the inscription Fronton dedicated to his wife moved French explorer Dijardin so much he had a second, equally touching inscription made.\n\n10\n\nFor a truly authentic experience, discover Nikopol through the eyes of a fisherman by booking a fishing and sightseeing tour with one of the skilled guides from the Amour Nikopol Asso- ciation. In addition to learning about one of the oldest trades in the world, you will get an insiderâs tour of nearby islands and the only river-facing rock church in Bulgaria.\n\nThe Amour Nikopol Association teamed up with the local chitalishte (community center) to organize a Danube food and crafts festival every July.\n\nFancy becoming Indiana Jones for a day and search for lost ancient worlds? An hourâs drive from Nikopol are the remains of the ancient Roman city of Ulpia Oescus, an important Roman economic and cultural center in the second and third centuries (and one of the 100 Dunav Ultra Sights!), said to have been visited by Emperor Constantine himself.\n\n11\n\nBelene Belene is a place of many contrasts. Alongside lush natural habitats swarming with wildlife are grim reminders of unrealized industrial projects and haunting tributes to commu- nismâs repressive system. The town sits on the right bank of the Dan- ube River facing Belene Island (also known as Persin Island), the largest island in Bulgar- ian waters and an important part of Persina Natural Park. The island is also home to the former Belene labor camp for political pris- oners during the communist dictatorship in the country.\n\ncommitted to preserving the memory of the victims of Bulgariaâs totalitarian regime and to transforming the town and its surroundings into a place of year-round tourism.\n\nExplore the island and the region by signing up for Persina by Bike, a multi-day bike tour for the whole family, developed by the Dunav Ultra team and held every summer.\n\nVisitors can book a tour of the island through the Belene Island Foundation, an organization\n\n12\n\nBelene boasts the first monument to Pope John Paul II in Bulgaria; the ruins of the an- cient Dimum castrum fortress; two catholic churches, one of which is a cultural monu- ment housing the sanctuary of Bishop Eugene Bossilkov, who was beatified by Pope John Paul II; and the Dimum neighborhood, with hundreds of abandoned apartments built for the workers of the never-constructed Belene nuclear power plant. The town hosts an annual summer school on memory of the recent past for students, run by nonprofit Sofia Platform. The organization also developed Belene.Camp, a platform offering virtual conversations with communist labor camp survivors and a virtual tour of the town and former camp sites. In the past few years, Belene Island has seen a rise in the Dalmatian pelican population after the birds had nearly disappeared. Due to the hard work of several organizations, there are now three colonies of the Dalmatian pelican nesting in the country. The Dalmatian Pelican Festival, held in July, celebrates the return of the pelicans to Belene Island. Pelicans are far from the only birds nesting in the area. The Belene Islands Complex is a protected wetland area of international impor- tance that is home to hundreds of rare birds and plants. As such, the region is a paradise for birdwatchers and nature lovers.\n\n13\n\nSvishtov Known primarily as the hometown of one of Bulgariaâs best-loved writers, Aleko Konstanti- nov, Svishtov provides opportunities for both culture and nature tourism. The Church of the Holy Trinity in town is a must-see and the work of another great Bulgarian master, the architect and builder Kolyu Ficheto. Whether you are a literature, history, or ar- chitecture buff, or are interested in the heal- ing potential of the regionâs thermal springs, Svishtov has something for everyone. Kayak Club Svishtov is similarly versatile of- fering kayaking trips to nearby islands and towns such as Nikopol, kayaking classes, kay-\n\nak and bike rentals, as well as walking tours of Svishtov. Donât miss the trip to Vardim Island and the combined tour on the Danube and Yantra Rivers! Ruse Much can be said about and seen in Little Vienna, as the coastal city of Ruse is known among Bulgarians, but we will focus on one novel way of experiencing this gem of a city. In prehistory, the islets and caverns in the area were inhabited by hunter-gatherers. Mod- ern visitors to Ruse can experience what life was like for the ancients on the banks of the\n\n14\n\nDurankulak The end point of the Dunav Ultra route is one of the most interesting and least-known plac- es in Bulgaria. Durankulak Lake is one of the last well-preserved coastal areas in the coun- try, and on Big Island, also known as the âEu- ropean Troy,â near the village of Durankulak, archeologists have found remains of the most ancient settled population of Europe (from the 54th century BCE). If planning isnât your forte and youâd rather have someone else handle the tedious bookings and other travel logistics, get in touch with Traventuriaâs experienced tour guides. Watching rare birds along the Danube, tasting river- sourced delicacies, staying in authentic guesthouses, learning fascinating tidbits about the sights along the Danube coast, venturing out into the wildest corners of the entire Bulgarian north â Traventuria will make sure your trip is truly unforgettable!\n\nDanube by booking an eponymous tour with Prista Tourist Society. Participants will learn how prehistoric humans built shelter and pro- tected their territory, hunted and fished, and prepared their food. They will also find out what the ancients believed in and how their art reflected those beliefs. Tutrakan & the âMadâ Forest Area Fishing is an important part of Tutrakanâs economy, and the town is famous for its his- toric Fishermanâs Quarter. Get to know the area by boat, on foot, and by bike by booking a tour with Danube Tours. The organizationâs skillful guides will help you discover the re- gionâs main sights, become acquainted with traditional arts and crafts, and sample local delicacies. While you are in the area, make a point of visiting the Sveshtari tomb with the myste- rious stone ladies and hunt for treasures in Razgradâs Abritus Archaeological Museum.\n\nAn insiderâs tip: Stay out for the sunset; you wonât regret it! (Ask a local for the best sunset viewing point.)\n\nSouth of Tutrakan is a region known as Lu- gorogie, or Mad Forest, featuring picturesque villages, gentle undulating hills, and beautiful lakes and rivers (sadly, most of the forests were felled decades ago). To see the best of the area, book a weekend tour with Var- na-based VeloWeekend.bg.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nThe BASE textbook is a practical guide to entrepreneurship.\n\nYOU ARE NOT A BORN ENTREPRENEUR? TRY BASE\n\nCreating something of their own â many an entrepre- neurial journey starts with this aspiration. For nearly six years, Business Academy for Starting Entrepreneurs (BASE) has helped hundreds of bootstrappers achieve professional independence and personal satisfaction by supporting their first steps in business. Graduates of the America for Bulgaria Foundationâs free training program start successful ventures in their chosen fields, often in their hometowns or other desirable places. Their success also benefits their communities: in addition to creating jobs, a small business feeds families and supports the local economy. BASE follows a time-tested model developed in the United States: program lecturers and mentors are successful entrepreneurs and professionals who volunteer their time, sharing their experience and knowledge. Over three months, participants learn how to develop their business ideas, why it is important to do a market study, how to talk to potential customers and suppliers, where to get start-up capital, how to price their goods and services, and how to avoid rookie mistakes. Participants gain broadly applicable practical skills and access to a nationwide network of business partners and entrepreneurial individuals. At the programâs end, the best business plans receive seed funding for the businessesâ launch. Free entrepreneurship training is available through ABFâs partnership with the Trust for Social Achievement, Srednogorie Industrial Cluster, Association of Bulgarian Leaders and Entre- preneurs (ABLE), Council of Women in Business in Bulgaria, Magna Natura Association, East Accelerator Foundation, IT Stara Zagora, and Society and Security Foundation.\n\n17\n\n18\n\nCAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP PRESERVE TRADITIONAL CRAFTS?\n\nFour years ago, master woodworker Raden- ko Velinov returned from Scotland with the dream of reviving traditional crafts and occu- pations in his native village. Radenko bought an old purification plant in Smilyan and be- gan restoring it with his own money. When he completes the renovation, the Purifierâs workshop and exhibition space would enable artists and makers of various stripes to prac- tice, display, and teach their craft to others. Bringing artists and craftsmen under the same roof would catalyze collaborations and the establishment of small businesses, attracting tourism and benefiting the local economy. Radenkoâs vision attracted dozens of volun- teers and donors as well as the support of the America for Bulgaria Foundation. In June\n\n2023, the Purifier opened its doors and now welcomes artists and visitors.\n\nThe Purifierâs guests have access to craft workshops, a coworking space, a fantastic open area for relaxation, yoga, movie nights, and chats with new friends (over Rhodope herbal tea, of course!), as well as the unsur- passed hospitality of the host â Radenko and his family. For his efforts to preserve Bulgarian tradi- tions, Radenko was awarded a Worthy Bul- garian distinction in 2022.\n\n19\n\nMs. Balkanskaâs message to those in atten- dance was: âLetâs support the young and the hardworking. Radenko was abroad, worked, succeeded, and returned to Bulgaria to do something meaningful for his country. He de- serves our deepest respect.â With the Purifier, Radenko hopes to revive and promote the practice of traditional oc- cupations such as woodworking, weaving, leatherworking, metalworking, and pottery. Radenko believes that âmaking art or practic- ing a traditional craft is a kind of purification, emotionally and spiritually.â The plans for the artisan center draw on Radenkoâs experience at furniture making studios in Scotland, a country that places a high value on craftsmanship and where he lived for nearly eight years. Radenko trained with some of Scotlandâs best furniture makers and woodworkers, learning about both traditional woodworking techniques and modern trends in the craft, including sustainable sourcing of hardwoods. âRadenko has a very old-fashioned commitment to the job he has to do, which is very rare nowadays,â says Pol Bergius, a leading Scottish furniture maker and a mentor of Radenkoâs.\n\nDozens of friends and supporters from near and far attended The Purifierâs opening on June 23. Bulgariaâs âcosmicâ voice Valya Bal- kanska and internationally renowned bagpiper Petar Yanev were guests of honor. Members of the ABF team were also there to mark the completion of a years-old dream by master woodworker and visionary Radenko Velinov, who came back from Scotland to preserve Bulgarian traditions in his native Smilyan.\n\n20\n\nIliyan is particularly proud that he was able to pivot during the pandemic toward takeaway and catering and didnât have to lay off staff.\n\nILIYAN FAILED TWICE BUT DIDNâT GIVE UP. HE MAKES THE BEST BANITSA IN SOFIA\n\nIliyanâs bakery failed twice before the business finally took off. âI see the two failures as a bo- nus because I learned a lot of things,â he says. He learned that âwe were good at the craft but not at the business part.â Business Acad- emy for Starting Entrepreneurs supplied the necessary knowledge and some of the funds for a fresh start. Banicharnitsa Tradicionna (âTraditional Ban- itsa-Making Workshopâ) opened its doors in 2018, staffed only by him and his mother. Ini- tially, Iliyan put in 18-hour workdays even as he continued working part-time toward a uni- versity degree in film and TV production. Soon\n\nbusiness was booming, and he hired more staff. This freed up the time and resources for him to complete his university studies. Today, Banicharnitsa Tradicionna sells a broad selection of banitsa (traditional Bulgarian puff pastry with an egg-and-cheese filling) and other savory and sweet delicacies out of the bakery in Sofiaâs Geo Milev neighborhood and through the major takeaway delivery services in Bulgaria. Banicharnitsa Tradicionnaâs sec- ond location, in downtown Sofia, opened in January.\n\n21\n\nSUSTAINABLE CLOTHING BUSINESS DRAWS INSPIRATION FROM NANA\n\nParticipants in ABFâs Business Academy for Starting Entrepreneurs donât wait around for things to happen: they carve their own per- sonal and professional paths in life. Mariana Barakchieva gave up a comfortable life and a well-paid engineering job in Switzerland for a life of pursuing mountain adventures and building her own sustainable clothing business in Bulgaria. Mariana may be new to selling her handicrafts, but she has been making things since she was a child, when she crafted notebooks and nailed together furniture for her sistersâ dolls. Watching her great grandmother â nanka in the local Rhodope Mountain dialect â sew on an old Singer sewing machine was another favorite childhood activity.\n\nIt was the great grandmotherâs craft Mariana turned to two decades later when conven- tional professional achievement was no longer enough to satisfy her need for creative expres- sion and freedom. This is how Nanka Creative was born, the brand Mariana co-owns with her Swiss husband, Simon Roder. Nanka Creative honors tradition but also cares about the planetâs tomorrow: to make the beautiful hoodies and shirts that shoppers rave about, Mariana only works with ethically produced, quality merino fabric sourced from a small sustainable factory in Finland.\n\n22\n\nMarianaâs plan for the future of Nanka Creative was one of the funded projects in the programâs 2020 edition in Smolyan. The prize money helped her purchase a new sewing machine. Mariana received further assistance developing her business through BASE Mentor, a mentorship program the America for Bulgaria Foundation launched in partnership with the Association of Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs.\n\n.\n\nMariana Barakchieva has programmed eye surgery software, worked in radio, done broadcasts for TV networks in Bulgaria and the United States, managed a mountain shelter in the Swiss Alps, and pulled off daring rock-climbing feats. Nothing in her experience, however, prepared her to run a business. Business Academy for Starting Entrepreneurs taught Mariana to value her work more fairly. âI realized that my early prices didnât factor in profit,â she says, laughing about her rookie mistake today.\n\n23\n\nAlexander Tsvetanov is only 21, but he is al- ready an IT veteran. He has been taking pro- gramming courses since third grade, excelling in each one, got his first job in tech at 16, and is currently a software engineer at Chaos Group, the Bulgarian producer of the 3D ren- dering software V-Ray. He is also pursuing a degree in computer engineering at Technical University Sofia. For two years in high school, Irina Hristo- va, now 24, commuted from her hometown, Lovech, to Sofia to attend IT courses. Then in her senior year, she turned to IT full-time, moving to the capital and finishing high school as a part-time student. The move helped her become a sought-after junior expert in the tech sphere, where she still works. Her current employer, Fourth, is a leading global provider of intelligent cloud-based solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. Dimitar Tatarski loved his game development courses and his teachersâ approach so much he became a teacher himself â at 17. He kept up with his vocation during his two-year em- ployment as a program developer and through his university studies. At 23, he already has an impressive seven years of experience in teaching both youth and corporate clients.\n\nTHE IT PROGRAM THAT IS KEEPING YOUTH IN BULGARIA\n\nAlexander, Irina, and Dimitar are graduates of Telerik Academy School, the leading provider of free digital education to youth in Bulgaria, and all three credit their time at the academy as key for their professional orientation and successful career start.\n\n24\n\nThey are not alone. Although young, Telerik Academy School graduates have well-paying jobs, with every third earning well above the Sofia average, according to a 2021 Global Met- rics report. This is thanks to the wide range of transferable skills students develop at the academy. Every fourth graduate occupies a senior role at their company. Most academy graduates still in school say Tel- erik Academy School influenced their decision to continue their education in IT or a related field, with three out of every four graduates over 18 years currently pursuing IT-related majors at university. A number of them sug- gest that what they learned at the academy gives them a significant advantage over their university classmates and helps them breeze through some of the coursework. In the 2022â2023 academic year, free quality digital education was extended to more than 3,000 students in grades 1â12 as Telerik Acad- emy School launched a record 140 courses in 47 towns across Bulgaria. This way, students like Irina who want a future in tech no lon- ger have to commute to Sofia to pursue their dreams.\n\n.\n\nOver the past six years, the academy has expanded its educational offerings to cover all of Bulgariaâs districts. More than 20,000 children and young adults have benefited from its programs thanks to support from the America for Bulgaria Foundation, individual and corporate donors, municipalities, schools, local institutions, and nonprofits.\n\nThe Global Metrics report points to this ex- pansion as one of the biggest achievements of the program. Its outreach to smaller towns not only contributes to the development of in- dividual participants but also stimulates local economic growth, the report found.\n\n25\n\nBecause digital skills are in demand in every sphere of activity today, quality education in the field benefits all students, not only those seeking IT careers. âWe are happy that our programs provide stu- dents with equal access to the digital world and an opportunity to enter it, so that they are freer to decide on a future profession and a location from which to exercise it. Our goal is to help them succeed regardless of the field in which they choose to develop, because digital skills are key to any profession, now and in the future,â says Petar Sharkov, the academyâs executive director. âAnother important aspect of our work is the teachers in our courses; we work with out- standing professionals across the country, and this year our network already numbers 100 teachers. A total of 94% of these teachers\n\nsay that they apply what they have learned at Telerik Academy School in their teaching out- side it as well. This confirms that our work in the education system leads to positive change well beyond our programs,â Sharkov adds.\n\nEducational change wasnât what Telerik Academy founders Svetozar Georgiev, Boyko Yaramov, Vassil Terziev, and Hristo Kosev had in mind when they started the academy back in 2011. But just like their company Telerik â whose sale to Progress Software for $263 million in 2014 is still the largest tech deal in Bulgaria to date â the academy became a true game changer in the ICT field in Bulgaria.\n\n26\n\nâWhen we started Telerik Academy School a decade ago, we were confident that it would be useful, but that was the extent of it. We started timidly, with no grand expectations or a sense of what the long-term benefits would be. We also did not have the tools to measure success,â Georgiev says. âGradually, with the development of the pro- grams and their geographical expansion in Bul- garia, we began to see firsthand that the acade- my can literally change peopleâs lives, especially in smaller places. There is no greater feeling than to ignite a spark in a child and direct them on the path to a promising profession,â he adds. Importantly, Alexander, Irina, and Dimitar are pursuing their dreams in their home country â as are 93% of the 1,850 academy graduates who\n\nwork in IT-related jobs, Global Metrics found. This is equal to about 5% of the IT workforce in 2021 in Bulgaria, an impressive result for a single program. At this pace, we have no doubt that, in ten yearsâ time, most of Bulgariaâs engineers will have passed through at least one Telerik Academy School program â and that we can expect some great things from them. Just look at where Al- exander, Irina, and Dimitar are in their twenties! Not only that, but the academyâs programs might just be part of the solution to Bulgariaâs brain drain.\n\n27\n\nDigital Literacy for Every Child âEducating 3,000 children each year is a ma- jor achievement, but there are over 700,000 students in the educational system in need of our services. In the past two years, in part- nership with 15 schools in the country, the Telerik Academy School team developed a new model that can be implemented at any school in Bulgaria. This model is dictated by the needs of schools to provide ready-made, high-quality educational content on current and interesting topics for learners, as well as by municipalities that want to develop and upgrade the digital skills of students,â says Petar Sharkov, executive director of Telerik Academy School. Whatâs Next Telerik Academy School is working on a plat- form featuring educational content for grades 1 through 12. Schools will receive access to that content by buying annual subscriptions. Each program developed by Telerik Academy School contains a complete set of study ma- terials and teacher aids. The aim is to cover topics related to artificial intelligence, cyber security, mobile applications, design, robot- ics, programming, and game development as well as topics related to studentsâ personal development.\n\nâTelerik Academy Schoolâs programs are not for programmers. These programs fully develop studentsâ competencies in a digital environment: skills for accelerated learning, the ability to create mental maps and to plan. They enable a still-developing person to imagine the professions of the future and find their place in them. These are basic human skills. All other solutions for working with digital tools are focused on the process itself, while the academyâs programs are oriented toward the student; they work for the student and with the student.â\n\nMihail Nenov principal of\n\nAlexander Georgiev â Kodjakafaliyata Primary & Middle School in Burgas\n\n28\n\nCLASSICAL MUSIC IS NOT FOR KIDS? FORTISSIMO PROVES OTHERWISE\n\nâI want classical music to reach every child in Bulgaria.â\n\nBy combining classical music by Bulgarian and foreign composers, favorite tunes from musicals, gospel, jazz, film music, Bulgarian folk melodies, and Romani rhythms, Fortissi- mo overcomes borders and barriers, challeng- es stereotypes, and builds a kind of cultural bridge between genres and nations, between young audiences and classical music. The Fortissimo suite of musical programs in- cludes Fortissimo Fest, the countryâs largest classical music festival over the past decade; Fortissimo Class, the first childrenâs program for modern classical music education; and the family concert series Fortissimo Family. Today Fortissimo is a fixture in the Sofia Phil- harmonicâs event calendar, and Fortissimo Family concerts are performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra at Bulgaria Hall, the countryâs leading classical concert venue.\n\nRenowned Bulgarian conductor Maxim Esh- kenazyâs vision was a distant dream 15 years ago. In partnership with the newly established America for Bulgaria Foundation, he created the Fortissimo program, whose mission is to instill in children a love of classical music and to give a platform to talented young musi- cians, allowing them to perform alongside established names in the music industry. Over the years, the program with the power- ful name â âfortissimoâ is a musical direction meaning âvery loudlyâ â has amplified clas- sical musicâs presence on stages nationwide, bringing it closer to tens of thousands of Bul- garian children and their families.\n\n29\n\nWhy classical music? Classical music has an extremely beneficial ef- fect not only on the mental and psycho-emo- tional development of children but also on their social and cognitive skills. Research shows that exposing children to classical mu- sic at an early age stimulates their intelligence and emotional development. Arts and culture are key to building demo- cratic values by actively engaging citizens in discussions about important issues and en- couraging a collective approach to resolving controversial issues.\n\nGood educational strategies emphasize arts education. The arts improve learning out- comes, reduce student dropout, and maintain teacher skills. Artistic expression helps to preserve cultural heritage and customs and pass them on to future generations. Nonprofit organizations and artistic business- es create jobs and attract tourists, revitalizing cities, neighborhoods, and villages.\n\n30\n\nâThe goal of Fortissimo Class is not to make a musician out of every student, but to show them the beauty of music. The final concerts of Fortissimo Class are a real treat; seeing a hall full of children clapping and cheering as if they were at a rock concert and enjoying music with their whole being â that is priceless!â Peter Makedonski, a trumpet player at the Bulgarian National Radio Orchestra and a Fortissimo Class teacher\n\nThe Fortissimo Effect Fortissimoâs programs inspired other cultural institutions in Bulgaria to open up to young audiences and direct resources to the devel- opment of youth programs. Today there is hardly a festival, museum, or gallery without youth offerings, audiences at cultural events are increasingly diverse, and the increased consumption of cultural products leads to the creation of ever higher-quality content.\n\n31\n\nWith 22 gold medals, Bulgaria tops the all-time ranking of the International Linguistics Olympiad, overtaking the United States, which has 21 gold medals, followed by Russia, England, and Poland.\n\n32\n\nEvery year, Bulgarian students earn distinctions from prestigious international competitions, outperforming hundreds of the worldâs best high schoolers. Ð¢he Association of Olympic Teams in Natural Sciences supports the training and competitive careers of Bulgarian youth teams in disciplines such as mathematics, chemistry, physics, bi- ology, astronomy, astrophysics, linguistics, and informatics. Since the associationâs founding in 2010 until now, Bulgarian competitors have brought back over 720 medals, including more than 120 gold, 300 silver, and 300 bronze medals. Since 2010, the America for Bulgaria Foundation has donated nearly 3.7 million levs in aid of the teamsâ preparation and participation in the worldâs top science competitions. The support is an investment in the future of Bulgaria and its youth, who in the coming years will be the driving force behind the innovations and scientific achievements that will change the country and perhaps the world. Additionally, the Foundation financed the creation of chemistry and biology labs at Sofia University to support competitorsâ hands-on training.\n\nFROM COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING TO THE HEIGHTS OF GLOBAL SCIENCE: RUMEN HRISTOVâS STORY\n\nWith two engineer parents and one of Bulgar- iaâs top IT academies located in his hometown, Shumen, 29-year-old Rumen Hristovâs success in the tech world was as good as certain. But even an ardent techie like him couldnât have predicted how far his youthful fascination with computers would go. Today, a technology de- veloped by Rumen and his team is on its way to unlocking the secrets of diseases such as Alzheimerâs and Parkinsonâs and speeding up the discovery of a cure.\n\n33\n\nWhat do you think made the biggest differ- ence for your success?\n\nA key factor on Rumenâs whirlwind journey was his participation in international infor- matics competitions, supported by the Asso- ciation of Olympic Teams in Natural Sciences. The three gold and two silver medals he won from the International Informatics Olympiad opened the door to the worldâs leading uni- versities, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where Rumen completed both his bachelorâs and masterâs degrees and met his future business partners. Nowadays, the company Rumen co-founded, Emerald Innovations, has a team of 20 and works with leading pharmaceutical companies in the US. For his contribution to healthcare, Rumen was in Forbes magazineâs 30 Under 30 class of 2020.\n\nR.H.: It all starts with a good teacher who is patient and really wants to teach kids, wants them to achieve their goals. Without a doubt, the most important thing for me was Biserka Yovchevaâs A & B academy. The other factor was that I was good at programming. I won my first major tournament in 2005, and this made me feel like I was good at it. When you are doing well at something, you have the motivation to keep doing it.\n\nWhat are the kinds of challenges that inter- ested you during your competitive career?\n\nR.H.: Informatics problems are a very inter- esting combination between programming, writing code, where you actually have to im- plement something and the computer has to agree with you that you have given it the right information, and a theoretical part, where you have to create an algorithm. Like in math problems, you have to analyze the data you are given and come up with an algorithm, which you then have to implement on the computer. Finally, the computer has to agree with you that you have implemented it cor- rectly. The advantage of computer science compe- titions compared to other disciplines is that you have an infinite number of competitions online. You can compete more or less daily against other people and see who can come up with a better algorithm faster and imple- ment it more quickly. In the end, your work is evaluated in an objective way. You can do all this from your desk at home, as long as you have a computer and an internet connection.\n\nHere Rumen talks about his journey from youth competitions to scientific innovation.\n\nHow did your interest in technology begin?\n\nR.H.: Iâve always been fascinated by comput- ers. I remember when I was seven years old, I was amazed that you could press a key on a computer, and something would come up on the screen â that you could convince the machine to do something you wanted it to do. It turns on a switch in my brain. All my early training in informatics and pro- gramming took place at the A & B academy, founded by Biserka Yovcheva. Everything I learned in the first six or seven years... the foundation of my knowledge was built there. This experience allowed me to grow.\n\nThe academy was also a good place to spend time in and make friends.\n\n34\n\nDo these algorithms have real-life applica- tions?\n\nin the UK is extremely expensive because it is not in the European Union, and there are no preferential prices for Bulgarians, as there were when the UK was in the EU. There are no student loans either. Americaâs top universities have a lot of money and offer need-based funding. In my case, MIT waived a very large portion of my tuition fee. How do the challenges you are working on now compare to the problems you solved in competitions? R.H.: When I took part in competitions, the problems were similar. But the more life stages I go through â bachelorâs degree, masterâs degree, and now running a startup â the less often I say to myself, âAh, this problem is like the last one!â We are always solving problems with some new nuance. Having the mindset and willingness to adapt to new circumstances is extremely important. In our startup, I also have to manage people and decide on who works on which project and which project is given priority during any given week. I have to do everything, and every year I write less and less code, but the important thing is to know how to do it â even if I wonât write it myself.\n\nR.H.: To a degree. For example, you are given a simple city plan with streets and junctions. You are at Junction A, and you need to get to Junction B. What is the fastest way to get from A to B? This is a simplified example, but it provides an idea of how you can get from informatics problems to real-life applications like Google Maps, for example. What drove you in those early days: was it the intellectual challenge, or did you know you wanted to help people even back then? R.H.: Itâs always a combination. A very im- portant factor is how difficult and challeng- ing something is, but equally significant is the application of what you are working on. Whenever something is more difficult, you are more motivated and engaged than you would be with a trivial problem. Something that has a better application always motivates you and gives you more meaning. The medals from international olympiads in informatics opened many doors for you, including to some of the most prestigious universities in the world. Why did you choose to study in the United States? R.H.: In recent years, fewer and fewer people in Bulgaria are considering America for their education. Yes, it is far away, but US educa- tion is top-notch, and American universities are the best in the world. Naturally, Oxford, Cambridge, and ETH Zurich are at a very high level and comparable to some extent. Anoth- er big advantage of the United States is the availability of funding. Right now, studying\n\n35\n\nWhat makes the Emerald device, your start- upâs breakthrough technology, different?\n\nRight now, with diseases like Alzheimerâs, the best we can do is control the symptoms, but we canât cure the disease because we donât even know where it comes from. Data, or objective numbers, is the best thing we have in the fight against these diseases. Algorithms are also important here: artificial intelligence will help us extract the data that would be useful. Whenever I go to a doctorâs appointment in America, they measure my pulse, blood pres- sure, blood oxygen saturation, etc. I may have gone there for something specific â letâs say, my leg hurts â but they always measure all these things for me because they know that this data can save lives. Instead of doing this once a year during the wellness check-up, with our technology, you can measure peopleâs conditions constantly while they are at home.\n\nR.H.: The combination of radar technology and artificial intelligence did not exist before we started developing this project. What we have invented is a radar that works in peopleâs homes. The device hangs on the wall and can monitor the location of people â whether they are sitting, lying down, walking, where exactly they are walking and how fast. We can also measure vital signs such as breathing rate and sleep phases without people wearing any sensors on their bodies and without even making contact with them.\n\nHow can we use this information?\n\nR.H.: Every time I go to the doctor, I realize how difficult their job is. A guy comes in with some random complaint, and you have to be like Sherlock Holmes and figure out what the problem is.\n\n36\n\nHow are you currently applying your tech- nology?\n\nWhat advice do you have for young people taking their first steps in informatics right now? R.H.: The main thing is not to give up. You al- ways have difficult days, the important thing is to always keep going, to have persistence. This was one of the biggest strengths for me during my competitive days. There was a Top- coder competition every week. To make them accessible to people from all over the world, the organizers scheduled the competitions at different times. There were competitions at noon, at 6 in the afternoon, at 10 in the eve- ning, and at 4 in the morning. Over a period of two or three years, I hadnât missed a single competition. Once a month, I had to wake up at 3â3:15 in the morning, drink coffee, and by 3:55 a.m. I was ready. The computer science competitions were re- ally very tough and that persistence, being clearheaded at 4 in the morning and thinking about a problem, was really very helpful.\n\nR.H.: Currently, our focus is on working with medical researchers, pharmaceutical compa- nies, and in some cases hospitals. The bulk of our work is with pharmaceutical companies though. They have clinical trials when they have a new drug or some new hypothesis for a disease. To put it simply, they want to find out if the drug works or not. In the meantime, we continue to develop the technology and algorithms so that they can extract more things and be more useful. Our focus will remain medicine in the near future, but the technology has other appli- cations as well. For example, it can make our homes smarter. A sensor that âknowsâ who is where in the house would configure the tem- perature of each room, turn lights on or off.\n\n37\n\nNatalia Ivanova is the organizationâs executive director and primary copywriter, and Nikola Kolev is responsible for TimeHeroesâ relations with business. Before devoting himself to vol- unteering full-time, Nikola worked in commerce, but like many other people, he rethought his professional priorities during the pandemic.\n\nOver the past ten years, TimeHeroes has worked to develop a culture of volunteerism in Bulgaria.\n\nWhether youâre a company employee responsible for building a strong team or just a concerned citizen, the volunteer matching professionals at TimeHeroes will help you find a worthy cause.\n\n38\n\nBUSINESS 5 We have long known that volunteering expe- rience is a great resume booster, but work in the public benefit looks great on a companyâs About page as well. Research shows that cor- porate volunteering opportunities are a magnet for talent.\n\nWAYS VOLUNTEERING HELPS\n\ntheir personal values align with their employersâ â the more likely they are to stay, according to Natalia Ivanova, TimeHeroesâ executive director, and Nikola Kolev, who manages the nonprofitâs relationship with business. For more than a decade, the largest volunteer- ing platform in Bulgaria, TimeHeroes, has pro- moted a culture of volunteerism in Bulgaria by matching volunteers with initiatives needing support through the TimeHeroes.org platform and by helping companies develop corporate volunteering strategies that reenergize teams and retain top performers.\n\nAdditionally, the pandemic encouraged a re- evaluation of career priorities: people are real- izing that employment should be about more than just a paycheck at the end of the month; a job should provide a sense of purpose and bring fulfillment. So ever more companies are piloting giving initiatives and instituting volunteering programs for employees. The more inspired people feel at work â and the more they feel\n\n1\n\nVolunteering reinvigorates teams.\n\nImproving life for others has a stimulating ef- fect on a team. Renovating a schoolyard or a library, winter-proofing an elderly individualâs home, or mentoring disadvantaged children together with your teammates wonât feel like\n\nyet another work event. You will be doing something meaningful and much more satis- factory â and bonding with your colleagues along the way.
