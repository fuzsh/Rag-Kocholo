        "text": "Tsarevets Castle is located in Veliko Tarnovo, the capital of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom (1185 - 1396). People began living here around 4200 BC, and traces of the Hallstatt culture (13th century BC - 5th century BC) and the later LaTene culture (5th century BC - 1st century BC) are found. The fortress was built at the end of the 5th century, during the reign of Anastasius I (491-518), but was destroyed by the Avaro-Slavics at the beginning of the 7th century. In the mid-12th century, the reconstruction of the walls and other buildings of the fortress began, and the Second Bulgarian Kingdom eventually developed around this site. After the Ottoman Empire colonized Bulgaria in the 15th century, the Bulgarian people were expelled and replaced by Turks, who built mosques and other structures. It was only after Bulgaria was liberated in the 19th century that excavations began to find traces of the past, and after that through constant research and restoration it became to have its current form.\n\nThere is a legend about this fortress. During the Roman times, this fortress was located on the road to the city of Nicopolis ad istrum. The Romans who settled here, to avoid foreign invasions, brought treasures from Nicopolis, and when this fortress fell, they left the treasures in the dungeon. To protect the treasure, the entrance was hidden and poison was used to create a trap. it is said that dungeon room of treasures is full of precious items, including gold and silver decorated with jewels and numerous gold coins.\n\nToday, the “Sound and Light” show is held in the Tsarevets Fortress, which began in 1985 to commemorate the 800th anniversary of the Veliko Tarnovo Uprising. This performance is a visual representation of part of Bulgaria's history.\n\nPHOTO: wikidepia"
