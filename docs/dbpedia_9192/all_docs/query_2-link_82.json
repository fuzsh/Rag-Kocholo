        "text": "KALOCSA\n\nOne of the most thrilling aspects of a cruise is waking up somewhere new, and there’s a real sense of excitement as we explore lands unknown to many until the Iron Curtain lifted. Hungary itself has so much to offer; situated at a crossroads in central Europe, it’s a mesmerising blend of European and Ottoman influences, rich in culture and history.\n\nOur adventure begins this morning when we arrive in Kalocsa, a city whose 1,000-year-old lore swirls with tales of warlike bishops, saintly kings, rampaging Ottomans and Magyar heroes. Among its fine buildings you’ll discover an impressive Baroque cathedral and the grand Archbishop’s Palace, with its Ceremonial Hall displaying a replica of the Hungarian holy crown.\n\nYou can choose to enjoy a walking tour of the town seeing the sights plus the fascinating Paprika Museum; the region is one of the biggest producers of the seasoning that’s an essential part of Hungarian cuisine – goulash being a famous example. There are many types and strengths of ‘red gold’, but the best variety is said to come from here, due to its rich colour and robust flavour.\n\nPuszta & Equestrian farm\n\nAlternatively, we take a scenic drive into the Puszta, Hungary’s Great Plain, a hauntingly atmospheric prairie whose spirit is burnt into the Magyar soul. Stretching as far as the eye can see, it is home to villages seemingly frozen in time, while Hungarian grey cattle, spiral-horned sheep and buffalo graze on its pastures. At our first stop we learn more about paprika and its production.\n\nThe Puszta is also famed for its horses, and we visit an equestrian farm to watch a performance by some of the region’s most skilled riders. You’ll have the opportunity to take a horse-drawn carriage ride and experience this unique wilderness from a different perspective.\n\nCruise towards Belgrade\n\nWe return to the ship for lunch as our elegant vessel seamlessly glides away from her mooring. Relax on board during this afternoon of scenic cruising.\n\nIncluded experience: Guided tour of Kalocsa with paprika museum or Puzsta drive with Equestrian farm visit.\n\nBELGRADE\n\nThis morning we arrive in historic Belgrade. The only European capital built at the confluence of two rivers, the city has been fought over numerous times, most recently during the Second World War and the Kosovo War, when it faced months of NATO airstrikes. Dramatically sited overlooking both rivers is Kalemegdan Park, which includes in its grounds the city’s iconic fortress, a stronghold built by the Celts, expanded by the Romans and besieged over a hundred times during its history – all detailed in its military museum. Despite its past, Belgrade is now a revitalized and forward-looking city and a delightful and varied place to explore, with delicate Art Nouveau facades tucked away among the stark concrete towers of the Communist era.\n\nWe enjoy a guided tour, seeing all the main sights such as the cathedral, Republic Square and Prince Michael Street with its wealth of 19th-century buildings, some bearing the scars of recent conflicts among their intricate Habsburg ornamentation. After lunch, you are free to explore this fascinating capital, still one of the least visited in Europe. Maybe you’d like to wander the Old Town’s lattice of winding streets, pausing for a welcome drink in one of the grand coffee houses or visit the bubbling bohemian quarter, which is being transformed into a 21st-century cultural hub by an influx of creative talent.\n\nAs the evening draws in, relax with a stroll or a drink on the Sun Deck before tonight’s culinary delights.\n\nIRON GATES GORGE\n\nFor many, today will be a highlight of the cruise as we begin our passage through the magnificent Iron Gates Gorge. One of the most memorable stretches of the Danube, this is where the river cuts its mighty path between the Carpathian and Balkan mountain ranges, forming part of the boundary between Serbia and Romania. The ‘true’ Iron Gates is a single narrow gorge, but the name covers an entire 83-mile stretch of valleys where towering limestone cliffs plunge into the depths below. During the 1960s and ’70s, two hydroelectric power stations were built here and their dams raised the river level by over 100 feet, submerging a number of historic settlements. We pass through the Great Kazan, meaning ‘cauldron’, where the river narrows to just 500 feet. As the Captain skilfully steers us through, you’ll see the huge sculpture of a Romanian hero – Decebalus – carved into the rock. Created in the 1990s, at over 130 feet high it is the largest rock relief in Europe – it even dwarfs the US presidents at Mount Rushmore. Decebalus was the last king of Dacia, the kingdom stretching from the Carpathians to the Black Sea. A warrior through and through, he fought the Roman Empire in three campaigns before Emperor Trajan got the better of him. Decebalus fled into the Carpathians, taking his own life rather than being captured.\n\nOn a day like this, the spacious Sun Deck comes into its own. Watch the spectacular scenery drift by from the comfort of a sun lounger or maybe enjoy a drink with new friends. You may even find an ice cream being served on the Bow Deck, which is beautifully attired with soft furnishings and stylish wooden fittings.\n\nIncluded experience: Cruise through the Iron Gates Gorge.\n\nPLEVEN\n\nBy now you’ll have come to appreciate the luxuries on board your five-star ship – little touches from complimentary dressing gowns and slippers to plush carpets in the corridors and the marble-topped bar. Crossing the border into Bulgaria tonight, you awake in Nikopol, a town dating back to Roman times, and after breakfast, we drive across the Danubian Plain to Pleven. Surrounded by several thousand acres of parks and forests, the town is famed as the scene of a major siege in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877. The joint Russian and Romanian army took five months to take the town, partly because the defending Turks were the first in European history to use repeating rifles. Pleven was a decisive battle, leading to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the restoration of Bulgaria as a state and the independence of Romania. Opened to commemorate the battle’s centenary, the Pleven Panorama tells the story of this engagement through a series of moving photographs and canvasses. We enjoy some free time here, so perhaps visit the St George Chapel Mausoleum, a memorial to the soldiers killed during the siege, or one of the town’s many other museums. Or simply wander the Old Town and enjoy the tranquillity of its pedestrian-only streets.\n\nCruise towards Oltenita\n\nDuring lunch we slip our moorings for an afternoon’s cruising, so why not enjoy the invigorating river breeze up on the Sun Deck? It will soon be time for dinner, so reconvene with your fellow travelers for an aperitif in the bar.\n\nBUCHAREST\n\nToday we visit Bucharest, with its tree-lined boulevards and elegant belle-époque villas – echoes of the hedonistic 1900s when it earned the nickname ‘Little Paris’ – dotted among the utilitarian architectural legacy of Communist rule.\n\nDominating the capital city of Romania, though, is the astonishing Palace of the Parliament, a colossal concrete extravagance commissioned by the Communist dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu. Started in 1984 and still unfinished, it is the second-largest administrative building in the world after the Pentagon – so big that only 400 of the 1,100 rooms are used. Furnished with all the gaudiness expected from a heartless despot at the head of a bankrupt state, from marble staircases to mosaics and chandeliers, to some it’s a marvel, to others a monument to vanity.\n\nOn our guided tour we see the Palace of the Parliament, which really has to be seen to be believed, and the city’s other main sights, such as the former royal palace – now the national art museum – and the Athenaeum with its impressive Baroque cupola and remarkable acoustics. There are also some superb Orthodox churches and squares, including Revolution Square, named after the 1989 uprising that swept away Ceausescu’s regime.\n\nThere’s time to explore this vibrant city under your own steam. Lunch isn’t included today, so seek out a cosy restaurant in the Old Town for a fortifying plate of traditional meatballs, generously spiced with garlic, dill and parsley; freshly stuffed peppers or a hearty vegetable and dumpling soup.\n\nWe return to the ship with time to relax before dinner. Perhaps borrow a board game or novel from the library or book yourself in for a manicure or pedicure at the on-board Hair and Nail Salon.\n\nDANUBE DELTA\n\nOvernight, we'll have a cruise towards Brăila, and this morning, we take a coach from Brăila to Tulcea, clinging to seven hills overlooking the river and regarded as the gateway to the vast Danube Delta on the edge of the Black Sea. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Danube Delta is the best preserved and second-largest river delta in Europe.\n\nWe'll board smaller boats and sail into the tranquil Danube Delta. Our guide helps to point out some of the fascinating flora and fauna – you could spot a colourful kingfisher or a catfish darting beneath the water's glassy surface.\n\nThe Danube Delta consists of 2,200 square miles of rivers, marshes, tree-fringed lakes and reed islands and is home to nearly 3,500 animal and fish species and 1,700 types of plants.\n\nA birdwatcher's paradise, the maze of canals bordered by willows and oaks offers the perfect breeding ground for countless species. Millions of Egyptian white pelicans arrive here every spring to raise their young, while equal numbers of Arctic geese come to escape the harsh Northern European winters. Keep an eye out for cormorants and white-tailed eagles.\n\nAs dusk falls on this magical landscape, we slip our moorings again. Enjoy another delicious dinner, maybe tonight choosing a more intimate dining experience in the Riverview Kitchen at the stern.\n\nCONSTANTA\n\nToday we depart for the ancient city of Constanța, described by the Roman poet Ovid as ‘the end of the world’ and with a history dating back over 2,500 years. Originally known as Tomis, it is said that Jason landed here with the Argonauts after finding the Golden Fleece. Situated on several trade routes, it became a thriving commercial centre during Roman times and still is today.\n\nNumerous remains from Greek and Roman times are on display in the city’s archaeological and mosaics museums, the latter housing the largest – an impressive 9,150 square feet – and best-preserved Roman mosaic in the world. Constanța’s landmark is the Art Nouveau casino, with its views of the Black Sea.\n\nNow unused, it was built by the Romanian King Carol I, who hoped its construction would transform the city into a bathing resort for the elite during the inter-war years, something that never quite transpired. More recently, it became one end of the shortest navigable route between the North and Black Seas when the Main-Danube Canal opened in 1992.\n\nThere is free time to explore, so perhaps visit one of the museums or simply enjoy the sea air with a portside walk.\n\nCruise towards Rousse\n\nDuring lunch back on board we continue our return passage, but these lands still have so much to reveal. Hold on to your hat up on deck, as this area is well known for its windy weather and windmills were once a common sight. Watch the rocky shoreline drift by, dotted with the occasional ruined fortress.\n\nIncluded experience: Guided tour of Constanta.\n\nVELIKO TARNOVO, ARBANASI & IVANOVO\n\nCrossing into Bulgaria, we arrive in Rousse, a city known as ‘Little Vienna’ for its wealth of fine 19th-century buildings. A scenic drive brings us to possibly Bulgaria’s most beautiful city – Veliko Tarnovo, the ‘City of the Tsars’ and former capital, located in a rugged landscape entangled by the meanderings of the Yantra River. Its Old Town is clustered on three hills with its houses stacked on steeply sided valleys, while the remains of the once-impregnable fortress complex stands on Tsarevets Hill. Within the walls of this redoubt are the ruins of the Tsar’s Palace and, at the summit, the Patriarch’s Palace, which includes the Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God. Much of Veliko Tarnovo was destroyed by the Ottomans, but in the 19th century, it became an important trading center again. Tucked away in its picturesque cobbled streets are tiny workshops, where you can watch copper pots being beaten or wooden utensils skilfully carved. It is delightful to wander here, keeping an eye out for interesting traditional snacks to try, admiring the architecture while soaking up the atmosphere.\n\nLater we head to the village of Arbanasi, set high on a plateau. During Ottoman times, it became a commercial center for traders and their caravans, crammed with wares bound for places as distant as Italy, Russia and even India. Perhaps visit one of the richly ornamented mansion houses of the period, with their fortress-like stone walls, or the unassuming Church of the Nativity – once inside you’ll be dazzled by the intensely colored frescoes.\n\nWe end the day with a visit to the Churches of Ivanovo, a fascinating complex of churches, chapels, and monasteries hewn into the solid rock during the 12th century and with frescoes dating back to the 14th century, so exquisite and historically significant they are now on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nBELOGRADCHIK\n\nThis morning why not take a cup of coffee up on deck and soak up the spectacular open spaces of this landscape, where thick woods of fragrant pine and silver fir cling to the banks, forming a hazy outline on the distant horizon? After lunch we moor in Vidin, home to the Baba Vidin, the only entirely preserved medieval fortress in the country. From here, we drive into this rugged wilderness and suddenly the horizon is dotted with huge sandstone cliffs, in a spectrum of orange-reds and yellows, eroded into huge, bizarre shapes. These are the Belogradchik Rocks – unique and dramatic, they cover an area of 35 square miles, some reaching as high as 600 feet. Many of these gigantic natural sculptures are named after people or objects they are thought to resemble, while others are associated with colorful legends.\n\nWe return to the ship for dinner. Later on, maybe enjoy a drink in the lounge with your companions while the resident pianist plays gentle melodies.\n\nIRON GATES & LEPENSKI VIR\n\nThis morning’s cruising brings us once again to the dramatic splendor of the Iron Gates Gorge, at the heart of Serbia’s Djerdap National Park. The gorge was cut out of the Carpathian mountains over millions of years as the Danube drained the Pannonian Sea. Among the park’s forests of the ancient oak, hazel and beech lies a rich preserve of game, including deer and wild boar. Mountain goats roam the rocky cliffs of Djerdap Kazan, while bears, wolves, foxes, and wildcats populate the dense woodland. Keep an eye out for eagles and falcons, too. Why not enjoy the splendor of this stretch of the river from a sun lounger on deck or through the panoramic windows in the ship’s lounge?\n\nThis afternoon we moor in Donji Milanovac and take the short drive to Lepenski Vir, one of the most important archaeological sites in Europe, dating back to 9,500 BC. It consists of a series of Mesolithic villages located on a high terrace overlooking the Danube. The wooden houses were laid out in a fan shape and used one of the first types of concrete as their foundations, while their floors were made of sandstone, often covered with limestone plaster and decorated with red and white pigments. Our guided tour will reveal more about this fascinating place and how these ancient people lived.\n\nThe ‘Chef’s Dinner’ is served this evening, when the chef prepares his superb ‘signature’ dishes for you to enjoy in the splendid surroundings of the ship’s restaurant. As the sun sets on this memorable city, retire to the bar with your fellow travelers to reflect on all you have seen so far during this exceptional cruise. During tonight's dinner we depart for Novi Sad.\n\nIncluded experiences: Cruise through the Iron Gates Gorge & guided visit to Lepenski Vir.\n\nNOVI SAD\n\nOne of the delights of river cruising is indulging in complete relaxation, so this morning, after a leisurely breakfast, perhaps catch up on some reading or simply watch the world float by as we cruise along this mighty river. The numerous fortresses along the Danube are reminders that the area has been fought over for centuries and this morning we pass one of the most impressive – the medieval Smederevo Fortress.\n\nAfter a lazy day we moor in Novi Sad, Serbia’s second-largest city, in the shadow of the Fruska Gora mountain, its fertile slopes terraced with vineyards. The climate and the proximity to the Danube make this region ideal for wine production, particularly Riesling, but there are many others produced here including Bermet, a vermouth-like dessert wine with a unique aromatic sweetness. Enjoy a guided tour of this vibrant city which flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries, becoming known as the ‘Athens of Serbia’. See its old Town Hall on the impressive main square, flanked by lovely 19th-century architecture, its ancient castle, and synagogue. Towering over it all is the mighty Petrovaradin Fortress with its complex system of underground tunnels. The minute and hour hands of its iconic clock face are reversed, supposedly so that fishermen could still tell the time at a distance. You can learn more about the fortress and its history at its museum.\n\nWe moor here this evening, so why not enjoy an after-dinner stroll and take in the relaxed ambiance of this lovely city?\n\nIncluded experience: Guided tour of Novi Sad & live on-board musical performance.\n\nOSIJEK & VUKOVAR\n\nToday we cross into Croatia and stop in Vukovar, the country’s largest river port, located at the confluence of the Danube and Vuka Rivers. Vukovar boasted a prosperous manufacturing industry and a picturesque Baroque center until the tragic events of the civil war unfolded, and the city was almost completely destroyed. Renovation to restore the city to its former glory is very much ongoing.\n\nHere we enjoy a short orientation tour, seeing the main sights and learning about the city’s tumultuous past. We then drive to the historic city of Osijek, which hugs the banks of the River Drava. We explore the Old Town – behind its thick stone walls lies an intriguing market square, lined by handsome public buildings with pastel-colored facades. In the Upper City, you’ll see the neo-Gothic cathedral, its red-brick spire soaring above the rooftops. Much of Osijek has been restored, but some buildings still bear the scars of the fighting.\n\nWe’ll reembark our ship in Aljimas and this afternoon we’ll sail to Budapest, continuing overnight.
