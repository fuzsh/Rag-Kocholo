        "text": "If you’re a fan of Spartacus, a warrior turned slave and gladiator, who led an uprising against the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC, you probably remember him being called a “Thracian dog” by his enemies. Now, Thrace is the name of the region that encompasses present-day Bulgaria and the Western Part of Turkey. Plovdiv, once known as Philippopolis, is one of its most important cities.\n\nAs such, Plovdiv has a fair number of well-preserved remnants of Roman architecture. One such is the Odeon of Philippopolis, an ancient theater where performances and public assemblies took place.\n\nNot far away from it is the House of Eirene (Domus Eirene), showcasing the grandeur of Roman architecture with its intricate mosaics and frescoes. Adjacent to it lies the Bishop's Basilica of Philippopolis which captures the imagination with its grand scale, serving as a testament to the importance of Christianity in the region.\n\nMoving on, the Small Basilica of Philippopolis, a more modest yet equally intriguing structure, offers insight into religious practices during Roman times.\n\nPerhaps the most important among these is the Roman Amphitheater of Philippopolis, standing as a monumental reminder of the city's cultural richness. The venue overlooks the city and still hosts live theatrical shows and other events during the summer for thousands of spectators. It also boasts night illumination that can marvel your senses once the sun sets down.\n\nSome way ahead is the Stadium of Philippopolis once echoed with the cheers of enthusiastic crowds witnessing thrilling athletic contests.\n\nAs you explore further, you'll encounter the imposing Castle Gate (Hisar Kapia), a symbol of Plovdiv's fortified past. Lastly, the Nebet Tepe, or Guardian Hill Archaeological Complex, offers panoramic views of the city and provides a glimpse into its earliest settlements.\n\nFor anyone interested in history and archaeology, Plovdiv's Roman ruins offer a captivating journey back in time. Collectively, these sites provide a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in the ancient world and discover the stories they hold from centuries past."
