        "text": "This paper aims to present the characteristics and to discuss the main issues of a specific group of sgraffito ceramics with underglaze monograms. These ceramics were produced locally in the Medieval capital of Bulgaria, Tarnovo, as well as in some other urban centres such as Cherven and Silistra. The samples’ distribution matches an area controlled by the Tsardom of Tarnovo during the second half of the 14th c. The appearance of the group could be dated in the 1340s based on the decipherment of the monograms of Patriarch Symeon and its production and use most probably does not exceed the time of the Ottoman conquest. Huge plates and bowls covered with transparent, colourless, light green or yellow glazes seem to be of earlier date, as opposed to later samples of smaller size, more often glazed in darker shades. Monochromacy is a distinctive feature in most cases, as well as incised decoration of concentric circles, possibly inspired by the Zeuxippus Family ceramics. The inscriptions, placed closer to the rim of the vessels, are of great historical significance since some of them comprise the names and titles of Bulgarian tsars, patriarchs and other dignitaries like Ivan Alexander (1331 – 1371), Ivan Shishman (1371 – 1395) and Patriarch Theodosius II. The samples with royal monograms are concentrated at the Palace and those with patriarchal inscriptions – at the Patriarchate in Tarnovo. An interesting case are the sets inscribed with single letters originating from several monasteries, among which the plates and bowls marked with ‘M’ (meaning 40) from the Tarnovo monastery of the Holy 40 Martyrs stand out as the most numerous assemblage. The archaeological contexts clearly show a connection between vessels with certain monograms and particular complexes. Therefore the possibility for the group’s free circulation as trade goods and its use by the ordinary population should be excluded.\n\nThe text is devoted to the analysis of the portrayal of Tărnovo, the new capital of the restored near the end of the twelfth century Bulgarian state, in the historical work and speeches by Niketas Choniates, a Byzantine historian, official and rhetorician from the latter half of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. As a direct witness of the contemporary Byzantine-Bulgarian relations, a high ranking court dignitary throughout most of the discussed period, and the author of the most important sources shedding light on the restitution of Bulgaria, he left a legacy of extraordinary importance, one which has shaped views of the subsequent generations of Byzantine historians. While examining Tărnovo's role shows it did not occupy a particularly significant place in the historian's narrative, and the remarks concerning it appear as if in passing, he nonetheless was fully conscious of the city's significance not only for the Bulgarians themselves, but also in the context of the prospective expansion of the Empire in the direction of its northern neighbours. It is therefore no accident that in his brief characterisation the city the author focused on the description of the defensive qualities of Tărnovo. Paradoxically, his arguments on this subject may play an important role in the present ongoing discussion among the archaeologists exploring the former capital on the subject of chronology and size of the fortifications surrounding the two most important hills on which the city developed, namely Tsarevets and Trapezitsa.\n\nThe purpose of the present study is to summarize the results of the archaeological excavations of Ostrovski rampart. The excavations in 2011 and 2019 clarified the main dimensions of the earthwork structure and shed new light on the problem of its chronology. The Ostrovski rampart is the largest earthwork structure in present-day Northwest Bulgaria, with a linear length of about 58 km. It encloses the steppe area between the Danube River and the low hills of the Fore Balkans. The earthwork structure consists of two elements: a ditch about 3 m deep and a rampart embanked on its eastern side. During the last archaeological excavations, two sherds of Early Medieval pottery dating to the first half of the 9th c. were found at the bottom of the ditch. Calf bones were also found in the silt that partially filled the ditch. Radiocarbon analysis of the bones dates them between 767 and 900.Different opinions have been expressed about the purpose of the earthwork ramparts. Most scholars believe that they were built to strengthen militarily important areas. The data from the archaeological map of the region show that the most significant demographic resource necessary for the construction and protection of such a large-scale fortification line existed in the first half of the 9th c., when a large number of settlements appeared between the rivers Iskar and Tsibritsa. Historical sources note that at the same time, west of Bulgaria, the political and military situation is very unstable, which is probably the reason why the Bulgarian authorities organized a preventive strengthening of the endangered West Bulgarian areas.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that heel irons in Bulgaria came into use around 1200 AD. They are considered one of the usual High medieval finds, which continues to be used in the Ottoman period and even today. They are believed to have been attached to the soles of “rough” shoes, often interpreted as “military”. However, a careful examination of the contexts in which they are found compels a vast revision of existing views. It is noteworthy that heel irons were not found in cemeteries dating back to the 13th and 14th c. The objects found in settlements are for the most part non-contextual finds, and as a rule, they were unearthed in settlements that indeed existed in the Middle Ages but also continued their life in the Ottoman era. The earliest of the few distinctly documented contexts containing heel irons within settlements cannot be dated before the very end of the 14th or even rather the first half of the 15th c. On the other hand, heel irons are relatively common in cemeteries dating back to the Ottoman period. The available data suggest that they are one of the objects that appeared in present-day Bulgarian lands during the Ottoman conquest because of the widespread distribution – among all strata of the population and not only the soldiers – of specific oriental shoes and boots: pabuç and çizme. The scarce archaeological evidence from other Balkan countries, i. e. Greece or Serbia, does not contradict this idea. Considering this, one would not be surprised to hear that in Bulgarian the heel iron is called налче (“nalche”), which is a direct borrowing of the Turkish word nalça/na’lçe."
