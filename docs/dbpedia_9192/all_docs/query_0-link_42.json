        "text": "History\n\n[edit]\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Ancient Greece, Roman Empire\n\nDue to the favourable natural conditions, the region has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Remains of early humans have been found in several local caves. Excavations have revealed some of the earliest known organized settlements in Europe, dating back to the 7th-6th millenniums BCE. In the 1st millennium BCE, the territory of modern Bulgaria (as well as parts of Greece and European Turkey) was inhabited by the Thracians, who left behind the rich tombs of their kings and nobles, hidden under barrows that dot the landscape (two of them are now UNESCO Heritage Sites). The seafaring Ancient Greeks established colonies on the Black Sea coast, some of which still survive as cities and towns to this day. The Roman Empire conquered the region in the 1st century CE, establishing the provinces Moesia, Thracia (Thrace) and Macedonia. In the 5th century CE, Slavic tribes settled in the area, merging into the local population; at the same time, the Roman Empire split in two, and what would later become Bulgaria remained in the eastern half, the Byzantine Empire. In the 7th century, the Bulgar people, semi-nomadic Turkic-speaking mounted warriors, arrived from their previous state by the Volga and established the first Bulgarian state on the Balkans.\n\nFirst and Second Bulgarian Empires\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the following centuries, the Bulgarian and the Byzantine Empire fought intermittently for dominance in the region, each having its successes and setbacks. In the 810s, the Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros I managed to burn the Bulgarian capital, but his forces were ambushed on the return trip and the Bulgarian ruler Krum had Nikephoros's skull made into a drinking cup - as a sign of respect. Those pagan beliefs didn't last much longer, though, as a few rulers later Bulgaria was Christianized in the 860s under Boris I, for which he was later canonized as a saint. Boris's patronage of scholars, including some of the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius (\"the apostles of the Slavs\"), lead to the creation of the Cyrillic script in the 880s and its official adoption. The rule of Simeon I shortly thereafter (893-927) is considered the peak of the First Bulgarian Empire, when it rivalled the Byzantine Empire in power, splendour and scholarship. Less than a hundred years later, the Byzantine Emperor Basil II managed to subjugate Bulgaria in 1018, earning the nickname \"the Bulgar Slayer\" because of his cruelty.\n\nTwo noble brothers successfully rebelled against Byzantine rule and established the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185. Under the Asen dynasty, Bulgaria once again played a major role in the region. After the Fourth Crusade ended with the sack of the Byzantine capital Constantinople in 1204, the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan defeated the crusaders at the battle of Adrianopolis (1205) and captured their leader Baldwin of Flanders, who had crowned himself emperor of the Byzantine Empire. The Second Bulgarian Empire reached its peak during the rule of Ivan Asen II (1218-1241), when its territory extended across parts of today's Romania, Serbia, Macedonia and Greece. This is reflected in a slogan popular among Bulgarian nationalists today - \"Bulgaria on three seas!\" (the Black, the Aegean, and the Adriatic). But again, it was not to last - a series of weaker rulers led to curiosities such as a former swineherd, Ivaylo, assuming the throne after a peasant revolt in the 1270s, and the Empire gradually fell apart into smaller feudal holdings.\n\nOttoman rule\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Ottoman Empire\n\nIn the second half of the 14th century, the Bulgarian feudal states were conquered one by one by the Ottoman Turks in a series of military campaigns. The Bulgarians, along with the other Balkan peoples, became unwilling subjects of the Ottoman Empire. Being Christians, they were considered a part of a lower, subjugated class (rayah) and had to bear the weight of additional taxation (including the devshirme tax, the forced enslavement of children to train them as elite Janissary troops) and various regulations limiting clothing and even the allowed height of churches. During the five centuries of Ottoman reign, the regime gradually became more lax as the Empire developed, but Bulgarians (like its other Christian subjects) never lost their second-class position. That's why the period is also colloquially called the \"Ottoman yoke\" (Osmansko igo), as well as other, even less charitable epithets.\n\nIn an attempt to make Bulgarians remember their history and national pride, the monk Paisius of Hilendar wrote the Slavonic-Bulgarian History in 1762. This marked the beginning of the Bulgarian National Revival, a period of renewed social, economic and political development of the Bulgarian people within the confines of Ottoman rule. One of its manifestations (and later, drivers) was an increased interest in secular education in Bulgarian language. As a result, educators such as Petar Beron, Vasil Aprilov and Petko Slaveykov are celebrated today almost as much as the more militant freedom fighters of that era, like Georgi Rakovski, Vasil Levski, and Hristo Botev. Increased nationalistic sentiments lead to a rise in revolutionary activity against Ottoman rule, culminating in the large April Uprising of 1876. It was quickly and bloodily suppressed, but the atrocities shocked the Great Powers of Europe and they didn't object when the Russian Empire declared war on the Ottomans in 1877. The multi-ethnic imperial army included a contingent of Bulgarian volunteers (opalchentsi), and they distinguished themselves in the key battle of Shipka Pass, preventing an Ottoman army from crossing the Balkan Mountains to relieve the besieged city of Pleven.\n\nConstitutional monarchy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: World War I, World War II in Europe\n\nThe war ended with the signing of preliminary peace treaty of San Stefano on 3 March 1878, celebrated ever since as the Liberation of Bulgaria. During the follow-up Congress of Berlin in the same year, the Great Powers pared down the originally proposed borders: the newly created free Principality of Bulgaria included only what is now Northern Bulgaria and the region of Sofia, and it would still be a vassal of the Sultan; the other territories immediately south of the Balkan Mountains became Eastern Rumelia, an autonomous province within the Ottoman Empire; the rest remained under Ottoman rule. This decision had vast consequences, as the course of Bulgarian history for the next century would be set directly or indirectly by various attempts to unite all \"Bulgarian lands\". Internally, the young monarchy was marked by turmoil for most of its existence - throughout the decades that followed, Bulgaria experienced rapid economic and educational progress, but also political intrigues and assassinations, failed and successful coups d'état, popular unrest and periods of political repression.\n\nThe first parliament convened in Tarnovo in 1879. It composed a constitution and selected a young German noble (and relative to the Russian Emperor), Alexander of Battenberg, as the first knyaz (Prince) of Bulgaria. In September 1885, a clandestine revolutionary movement managed to bloodlessly unify Eastern Rumelia with the Principality of Bulgaria. As a result, Bulgaria became politically isolated and was almost immediately attacked by... Serbia - and won the war. The Great Powers accepted the fait accompli, but the new Russian Emperor was livid and Prince Alexander was forced to abdicate in a coup by pro-Russian military officers. Despite being quickly restored, he decided to give up the throne.\n\nAnother German noble, Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, was chosen as his replacement. In September 1908, he declared Bulgaria's de jure independence from the Ottoman Empire, claiming the title of Tsar (i.e. King). Several years later, the Tsardom of Bulgaria joined an alliance of Balkan nations in the First Balkan War (1912-1913) against the Ottoman Empire, gaining further territories. Afterwards, in a series of disastrous decisions, Bulgaria started (and lost) the Second Balkan War (1913) and entered World War I in 1915 on the side of the Central Powers (and lost). As a result, Bulgaria lost almost all of its recent territorial gains, and even unrelated lands - Romania annexed Southern Dobrudzha (including Silistra, Dobrich and Balchik; it was diplomatically regained in 1940). After all these failures, in 1918 Ferdinand abdicated in favour of his eldest son, Boris III.\n\nThe consequences of the Second Balkan War and World War I had catastrophic effects on Bulgaria's economy and society, leading to the rise of both far-left and far-right ideologies in the 1920s and 1930s. Boris III had to deal with Communist uprisings and military coups; revanchist elements in the ruling class favoured retaining close ties with Germany. When World War II erupted in Europe in 1939, Bulgaria declared neutrality, but it was gradually eroded, and in March 1941, Bulgaria formally joined the Axis. Unlike Romania, Bulgaria didn't send troops to the Eastern Front; instead, its soldiers occupied the conquered territories on the Balkans, freeing up Axis forces. After Bulgaria declared war on the UK and the US, Allied aviation bombed Sofia several times. Members of the Bulgarian elite managed to stop the deportation of Bulgarian Jews, saving about 48 thousand from the Holocaust; nevertheless, 11 thousand in the Bulgarian-occupied territories were deported and perished in the Nazi death camps. Boris III died suddenly in August 1943 under somewhat suspicious circumstances shortly after returning from Germany, leaving his 6-year-old son on the throne as Simeon II, under a council of regents. After the Soviet Union started advancing towards the Balkans, German forces retreated from the country. Bulgaria declared war on Germany; at the same time, the USSR declared war on Bulgaria, and Soviet forces entered the country without any resistance. A day later, on the 9th of September 1944, a pro-Communist coup d'etat toppled the government. Bulgarian troops ended up fighting along the Soviets against the Axis across Yugoslavia and Hungary. The regents were convicted by a \"People's Court\" and executed, and the little tsar was sent into exile.\n\nPeople's republic\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Cold War Europe\n\nAfter World War II, Bulgaria was occupied by the Soviet Army and fell within the Soviet Union's sphere of influence during the Cold War. It became a People's Republic in 1946, with the Communist Party in control. Its first leader was Georgi Dimitrov, one of three Bulgarian communists who had been accused by the Nazis of setting fire to the Reichstag in 1933, and General Secretary of the Communist International between 1935 and 1943. After his death in 1949, a mausoleum was built for him in a prominent place in the capital, just like the mausoleum of Lenin in Moscow.\n\nDuring Communist times, the Black Sea was a popular destination for travellers from both sides of the Iron Curtain, and many of the resorts in the country were built in this era.\n\nLike elsewhere, a number of cities were renamed after various Communist figures. Some of those names were reverted even before the fall of the regime (\"Stalin\", \"Kolarovgrad\"), but others could be changed only afterwards (amusingly, \"Mihaylovgrad\" became Montana; \"Tolbuhin\" reverted to Dobrich), and some chose to retain the name (Blagoevgrad, Dimitrovgrad).\n\nDemocratic Bulgaria\n\n[edit]\n\nMatching the decay of its patron, the Soviet Union, the Communist regime lost power and held the first multi-party elections in 1990, though the Bulgarian Communist Party simply rebranded as the Bulgarian Socialist Party and remained a major factor in politics. As a result of the elections, in 1991 Bulgaria adopted a new constitution and began a painful transition towards a market economy. The 1990s were marked by a prolonged economic crisis and the rise of organized crime, the results of poorly thought-out reforms, international economic factors and political corruption. In the winter of 1996, hyperinflation and the price of bread lead to bitter protests that forced snap elections in 1997, which removed BSP from power. The following right-of-center government adopted a currency peg to the Deutsche Mark, demolished the Mausoleum of Georgi Dimitrov, and tried to \"clean house\" in other ways, with mixed success. In an amusing twist of fate, the former tsar, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, returned from exile and governed as the Prime Minister of Bulgaria between 2001 and 2005.\n\nBulgaria joined NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007. Despite having a relatively stable economy and low debt, Bulgaria is the European Union's poorest member. The country has also been in a demographic crisis since the early 1990s, and its population has been declining faster than that of any other nation.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you want to reach Bulgaria from Western Europe by car you will have to pass through either Serbia or Romania, or you can take a ferry from Italy to Greece.\n\nThe shortest distance path from Western Europe to Bulgaria is through Serbia. However, you should make sure that you have a green card with you as Serbia is not a part of the EU. The most used Serbian path to Bulgaria (through Niš) was a narrow mountain road that can be exhausting to drive on because of the heavy traffic. Motorway A6 however has been finished and now the whole trip through Serbia can be made by motorway.\n\nThe other roads-only path to Bulgaria, through Romania, is longer in distance but can take up much less time as Romania has highways connecting its borders with Western Europe to Bulgaria and as a part of the EU, citizens of the union have less formalities on Romanian borders. This route is also very suitable for people travelling from Northern Europe. Bulgaria is connected to Romania with two bridges (at Vidin and Ruse) and several ro-ro ferry crossings (Bechet–Oryahovo, Turnu Magurele–Nikopol, Zimnicea–Svishtov, Călărași–Silistra).\n\nTravelling through Greece, after passing Thessaloniki you can choose from three paths depending on your final destination. If you are going towards Sofia, Western or North Bulgaria, the fastest and shortest route is towards Serres and then to the border Promahonas - Kulata. If youur destination is somewhere in the Rhodopes (Smolyan, Pamporovo, Kurdzhali) or near Plovdiv, the shortest route is towards Xanti (passing near Kavala) and then to the border Thermes - Zlatograd. This route however still needs reconstruction in Greece. Finally, if going to the Bulgarian seaside the fastest route is towards Komotini (parring near Kavala and Xanti) and then to the border Ormenio - Captain Petko Voyvoda.\n\nIn Bulgaria you have to pay road tax at the border (around €5 for 7 days). You will get a special sticker that you have to place on your car. There are no toll stations on Bulgarian roads.\n\nBesides the sticker, you may need to pay the Bulgarian authorities health insurance (€2 per person for 3 days, slightly more for more days). Make sure you get a receipt! Expect long queues on certain days coinciding with some Bulgarian holidays.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nUsing the train is a convenient, inexpensive and great way to travel the country, even if it's usually slower than the bus. Bulgaria has an extensive railway network that connects every major city, with the exception of the mountainous Smolyan. The only passenger service provider are the Bulgarian State Railways (BDZh or BDZ, БДЖ in Bulgarian). During the Communist period, the railways were prioritized as the main mode of mass passenger transport, but in the 1990s the advent of personal automobiles and private bus companies caused a large decline in ridership. As a result, due to corruption, mismanagement and the general economic woes of the country, BDZ has struggled to modernize or even maintain its services, though there has been improvement in the last decade.\n\nTrains are most efficient when travelling along the two major train routes: Sofia - Varna and Sofia - Burgas. You can travel both routes overnight, but you should make your reservations early because sleeping cars are often fully booked.\n\nBe aware that most Bulgarian train carriages are more than 20 years old, a mixture of older Bulgarian stock and imports from Germany and Eastern Europe. A lot of them have been refurbished, but others are not well maintained. (The exception are the modern and comfortable Siemens Desiro units that serve a number of shorter local routes.) On the plus side, you have more legroom and elbow room than a bus, you can walk around, and there's a toilet. On the other hand, the toilets in particular will appear primitive to most western users, so it's a good idea to stock up with toilet paper and anti-bacterial wet wipes and/or hand sanitizer. There are also no dining cars or trolley service, so make sure that you have enough water and snacks on long trips. Heating and air conditioning can be hit-or-miss. Long-range trains have easily accessible power outlets, but no WiFi. Smoking is prohibited in all trains, though some people may try to do it sneakily, smoking by an open window in the corridor (if windows are of the opening kind). Sleeping carriages are the most clean and well-maintained, as they are kept locked, and supervised by an attendant (shafner).\n\nThe official website of the Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ) is available in English and can be quite helpful: it offers an online timetable/route planner, information about delays and other disruptions in English, a virtual arrivals/departures board (many stations don't have electronic boards), and a live tracker of train locations. Another train planner is available on bgrazpisanie.com.\n\nBooking via the official website has the advantage of seat selection, as well as getting a 50% discount as a student holding an ISIC card without much hassle. Some ticket inspectors do not speak English, so make sure that when you print your ticket, it is generated in Bulgarian. The language in which the ticket is generated depends on the language the website is set to. Saving an English copy of the ticket on your phone might be a good idea for reference during inspection or other situations.\n\nIf you are travelling \"off the beaten track\" (almost synonymous with going anywhere else than the tourist routes between the capital and the seaside), it's a good idea to learn Bulgarian Cyrillic well enough to read place names (it's relatively easy, as it's phonetic) and some basic Bulgarian phrases to deal with the ticket offices at the smaller stations. Though you might be able to cope using GPS, BDZ's website, and apps such as Google Translate that can do both verbal conversations and text signs.\n\nBuying train tickets is pretty simple, and most people will buy a ticket 20 to 30 minutes before departure, as every ticket is issued for a specific train. Ticket sales are halted 5 minutes before the arrival or departure of that specific train. If you board \"in the last moment\" or from an unattended stop that doesn't have a ticket office, you should board the train's first carriage where you should be able to buy a ticket from the ticket inspector without penalty (but in the former case the ticket will be more expensive than normal). If your journey starts at the same point as the train starts, you might also be able to buy in advance a reservation for a specific seat on a specific train for a small surcharge - it depends on the type of train (see below).\n\nTrains can have either compartments, saloon-type seating, or a mixture of both (e.g. saloon in first class only). Seat numbers, if applicable, are carriage-based: the ticket specifies the number of the carriage (vagon, вагон) and the number of the seat within (myasto, място, lit. \"place\"). First-class carriage numbers start with an A (A, A-1, A-2, etc), second-class have only a number, in a separate ordering (1, 2, 3, etc). If there are compartments, the first digit(s) of the seat number indicate the compartment (kupe, купе), e.g. seat 22 is in a carriage's second compartment, seat 101 is in the tenth compartment, etc. The main difference between classes is seat width (i.e. elbow room): first class has 6 seats per compartment, or 2+1 seats per row in saloon seating; second class has 8 seats per compartment, or 2+2 seats per row. First class is also more likely to have functioning air conditioning.\n\nSince the country's admission to the EU, there are no \"express trains\" in Bulgaria, as they can't achieve the average speed required by the EU for such a label. Here's a list of the existing train categories, with names in English per BDZ's website, the Bulgarian names, and the Cyrillic letter codes that are used on tickets and schedules:\n\nIntercity fast train (ICF, бърз влак, barz vlak, БВ) - Trains serving long-range routes. They are faster as they skip most small stations (though which ones depends on the particular train). They have at least one first-class carriage, and sleeping carriage(s) on overnight trains. Buying tickets in advance is usually possible (about a week), though sometimes limited to first class and sleeping carriages only. The ticket specifies a seat number only if you reserve a seat. The Bulgarian name translates literally as \"fast train\".\n\nIntercity fast train with obligatory seat reservation (БВR or БВЗР) - The name means only that everyone gets assigned a seat number, you can still buy a ticket just before boarding. A sub-type of the above category, recognizable by the \"squared-R\" icon (🅁) on BDZ's website. These are expedited trains that run on tourist-heavy routes in the summer, which makes them BDZ's fastest offering. They are more likely to be in a good condition and to have saloon seating in both classes.\n\nInternational train (IC-INT, международен бърз влак, mezhdunaroden BV, Cyrillic code: МБВ) - Self-explanatory. They are treated as intercity trains within the country.\n\nRegional train (REG or ORD, пътнически влак, patnicheski vlak, ПВ) and suburban train (SUB, крайградски пътнически влак, kraygradski PV, КПВ) - The short-range categories. These trains are slow because they tend to stop at every station, even the unattended village stops/halts. They are limited to second class only, and you can't buy tickets in advance (though it hardly matters). Regional trains usually have compartments, while suburban trains tend to be multiple-unit trains with saloon seating. If you are lucky, it's a modern Siemens Desiro multiple unit. If you are unlucky, you may get an old, Soviet-made EMU with a \"picturesque\" exterior of rust and graffiti and an interior that hasn't been renovated in the last 30 years. You can tell the type by the icons in the timetable on BDZ's website: a seated figure with a D or E means a diesel or electric Siemens train; seated figure without any letter or number means an old EMU. The category names translate literally as \"passenger train\" and \"near-city passenger train\".\n\nIt's possible to buy a return ticket (otivane i vrashtane), it's cheaper compared to buying two separate tickets. Short-distance tickets allow only same-day return (until midnight); for longer distances it's within the next two days; some of the longest routes allow up to a month for the return trip. In any case, you need to get the ticket stamped (zaverka) at the station ticket office before your return journey, as it might be invalid otherwise. There are also group discounts. Transporting bicycles and electric scooters is allowed, for an additional fee when buying a ticket (3 лв as of 2024); they should be placed either on a carriage's entrance platform (by the toilet), or in the luggage car on some of the old multiple-unit trains.\n\nWhen the schedule says to change trains, it's possible that the train just changes numbers or that the carriages are split off to the other train, and you can remain seated in the same carriage. It's best to ask the conductor.\n\nNarrow gauge line\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a picturesque narrow gauge train (760 mm) in the Rhodope Mountains, passing through a very scenic landscape, with multiple loops, bridges, and tunnels. The line starts at Septemvri and climbs up the mountain slope, reaching the top at Avramovo (the highest station on the Balkans, at 1,267 m (4,157 ft) above sea level), and then goes down again, reaching the mountain resort Bansko before it ends at nearby Dobrinishte. The full length of 125 km (78 mi) takes about 5 hrs. The train is slow, but it is a really good way to see some rural Bulgarian life. On special occasions, it is operated by a steam engine. Tickets are very cheap, just 6.60 лв for the whole distance.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxis are usually a convenient and affordable way to get around cities. Many taxi drivers know only limited English so it is useful to write out your destination or carry a map. In most cases, payment is possible only in cash. If the driver suggests using any currency other than Bulgarian leva, that's a telltale sign of a scam.\n\nIn Bulgaria, taxis are legally required to have a sign reading ТАКСИ (taksi) on the roof and to be painted yellow (green if the car is electric or hybrid). Fares are determined by the taxi's meter, based on initial fee(s) plus distance travelled. The proliferation of scams has led to regulations that are sometimes ridiculously detailed. Taxis are required to have price stickers on the front and side windows, as well as on the dashboard. The stickers must contain the day and night prices per kilometre, initial fees, dispatch fees (if summoned by phone or app), waiting fees (per minute), and the price per km outside of a city. As of 2023, prices are regulated on municipal level - each year, municipal councils set the price range per kilometre (sometimes different for day and night operations). By law, for each time of day, the initial fee should be in the range 2x-3x of the minimal municipal price per km; the dispatch fee should be at most 150% of the taxi's price per km; the waiting fee per minute should be at most 50% of the price per km.\n\nAs prices vary by city, foreigners have been often targeted by dishonest taxi drivers. Common scams involve using a highly inflated price per km, asking to be paid in foreign currency using a false exchange rate, rigging the meter, or simply taking a longer route than necessary. To avoid the worst, familiarise yourself with the most reputable taxi operators in your area, your route and expected bill. It's less risky to order a taxi by phone or app, to use a taxi from the official taxi stands at the airports (they contract specific companies), or to hail a moving taxi. The taxis hanging around at tourist hotspots and major hotels are riskier. It's not advisable to follow a tout who offers you a taxi at airport arrivals, bus and railway stations, as some predatory companies mimic others' logos and labels on their cars. If you have to take a taxi from a taxi stand, you can \"shop around\" by looking at the stickers on the windows and comparing prices between the different companies. If you suspect that you are being scammed with the fare, ask for a receipt (kasova belezhka or faktura) - if you complain to law enforcement after the fact, there's little they can do if you don't have proof of the transaction.\n\nUber has been banned in the country since 2015.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nIf travelling by car, it would be helpful if you can read the Cyrillic alphabet at least a bit. Most signs at the major roads have the direction shown in Latin letters, but the signs in the internal road system are exclusively in Cyrillic, so if you are planning a road trip, GPS navigation or a road map are recommended.\n\nIf you are a foreigner, its best to rent a car. If you decide to rent a car bear in mind that for any bump or scrape to the car, whether involving a third party or not, you must immediately call the police to come and establish the damages of the incident for the insurance companies, otherwise you will find that your insurance will not cover the damage. Check the Terms & Conditions of your rental agreement closely.\n\nDriving in Bulgaria can be a bit precarious - many roads do not have well defined lanes as they are not well marked, and are in poor conditions with bumps and holes on them. On all but the major roads, expect to find significant pot holes and uneven surfaces. Due to the poor road surfaces, you will often find cars driving on the wrong side of the road to avoid these holes, so be cautious when driving around blind bends. Locals often do not observe speed limits, do not signal when changing lanes, take up dangerous manoeuvres on the road and are very nervous on behind the wheel. When travelling on the road Sofia-Greece, be very careful. There are extensive road reconstructions and you can meet some really dangerous drivers.\n\nIf you observe the rules, police will not bother you. Bulgarian police have white Opel Astra patrol cars, marked \"POLICE\" with blue letters - keep that in mind, because in the past there have been several cases of fake police officers stopping cars and robbing travellers. Should you ever doubt the authority stopping you, you have the right to ask them to identify themselves with a certificate issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Министерсво на вътрешните работи - МВР).\n\nNever ever drink and drive in Bulgaria! This is always dangerous, and in Bulgaria it is a criminal act: your first offence will result in a long prison sentence or at least - a very significant fine. The once-common practice of bribing a police officer to get out of a speeding or parking ticket is becoming rare. Do not attempt to bribe the police.\n\nCar theft isn't much of a risk, but shouldn't be underestimated. In rural areas leaving your car should be safe, but in the big cities or tourist spots, it is advisable to stay on the safe side by parking either on the major streets or on guarded garages, where fees range from 6 лв a day to 2 лв an hour. If you plan to spend more time in one city, it might be better to rent a parking space, which on the average costs 60 лв a month. Most hotels have their own parking, and even at private lodgings it is often possible to park the car in the garden, so just ask.\n\nTraditional meat appetizers\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a large number of traditional meat appetizers from all kinds of meat in Bulgarian cuisine. The most widely consumed, however, have been pork. Traditional meat appetizers are made from either the meat of the animal or from its intestines, but some of the delicacies include both. Other ingredients include leek, garlic, sometimes rice and a wide variety of herbs and spices such as savoury, thyme, parsley, cumin, dill, black pepper, red pepper, and others.\n\nCooked traditional meat appetizers include fried liver ( typically chicken, pork or lamb), roasted lamb intestines in herbs and spices, breaded veal tongue or veal tongue with mushrooms in butter, and veal stomach in butter or with mushrooms and cheese. Other popular cooked meat appetizers are sazdarma (саздърма) and bahur. Sazdarma is made of chopped meat and usually is seasoned with Daphne leaves and black pepper and can be from veal, lamb or mutton, while bahur is made of chopped pork meat and liver, with added rice and seasoned with allspice, savoury and black pepper. Although, some may think that those appetizers do not sound attractive at all, many of them fin out that they are a jewel once they have tried them.\n\nSmoked and/or dried meat appetizers can be generally divided into two types: pastramis and salamis.\n\nSome of the most popular pastrami-type appetizers are the pork Elena fillet (a salted air-dried fillet covered in savoury, thyme and other herbs) and Trakiya fillet (again, salted and air-dried fillet which is more juicy than Elena fillet and is covered in red pepper). There is also a wide variety of conventional pastramis (air-dried and then smoked and steamed) made from pork, veal, mutton, lamb and turkey. Pastrami in Bulgaria is transcribed as пастърма (pastarma). Another popular fillet appetizer is air-dried mackerel (in Bulgarian veyana skumriya (веяна скумрия) and it can be found in restaurants all around the seaside.\n\nSalami-like appetizers are mostly made of pork and are only air-dried. The most popular are lukanka (made of minced pork with black pepper and cumin), ambaritsa (made of minced meat with red pepper, black pepper and garlic), babek (chopped meat and belly with red pepper, black pepper and either dill or savoury), and starets (chopped meat and belly with black pepper, cumin, allspice and rarely leek or garlic).\n\nBulgarians have a long tradition of making meat appetizers and many of them vary in recipe across the country. Much of them can be found in different varieties in restaurants and food stores. Most of the most popular appetizers have regional recipes that give the distinct flavour of the area.\n\nCrime\n\n[edit]\n\nIn general, organised crime is a serious issue throughout Bulgaria, however it usually does not affect tourists and ordinary people. Bulgaria is safer than most European countries with regard to violent crime, and the presence of such groups is slowly declining. Pickpocketing and scams (such as taxi scams or confidence tricks) are present on a wider scale, so be careful, especially in crowded places (such as train stations, urban public transport).\n\nCar theft is probably the most serious problem that tourists may encounter. If you drive an expensive car do not leave it in unguarded parking lots or on the streets as these locations are likely to attract more attention from criminals. If, by any chance you do leave it in such a location, you need to be sure that the vehicle has a security system.\n\nTravellers should also be cautious about making credit card charges over the Internet to unfamiliar websites. Offers for merchandise and services may be scam artists posing as legitimate businesses. An example involves Internet credit card payments to alleged tour operators via Bulgaria-based websites. In several cases, the corresponding businesses did not exist. As a general rule, do not purchase items from websites you are unfamiliar with.\n\nBulgaria is still largely a cash economy. Due to the potential for fraud and other criminal activity, credit cards should be used sparingly and with extreme caution. Skimming devices, surreptitiously attached to ATMs by criminals, are used to capture cards and PINs for later criminal use, including unauthorized charges or withdrawals, are very common in Bulgaria. If you are unsure which ATM to use, it's best to use cash instead of a credit card.\n\nAlso, be careful with the cash you are dealing with. Bulgaria is one of the biggest bases for money forging of foreign currency, so pay attention to your euros, dollars and pounds. Do not exchange currency on the street. It is a common scam to offer you fake money as exchange in tourist areas such as stations.\n\nOn occasion, taxi drivers overcharge the unwary, particularly at Sofia Airport and the Central Train Station. Foreigners are recommended to use taxis with meters and clearly marked rates displayed on a sticker on the passenger side of the windshield, as generally these taxis charge a normal amount, and the taxis with no meters charge for very unfair prices. One useful tip is to check the price for your trip from a trustworthy source beforehand, such as a friend or an official at station or tourist bureau. If you are trying to be lured into such rogue taxis, it is best to reject the offer, or just walk away.\n\nBulgaria has very harsh drug laws, and the penalties are perhaps more severe than in any other country in Europe.\n\nAccording to the reports of the Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), Bulgaria is the country with the least tolerance of LGBT people in the European Union for 2009 and 2011. After mass protests at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, the Istanbul Convention was officially rejected. Be careful in conversations and refrain from public displays of affection with same-sex partners — otherwise you could be attacked by skinheads or nationalists. The same applies for visitors who are visibly transgender.\n\nBegging\n\n[edit]\n\nUnfortunately begging and unsolicited sales are quite common in Bulgaria. In the holiday resorts both in the mountains and on the coast there will be numerous people trying to sell you various things such as roses and pirated DVDs. Usually a firm 'no' will get rid of them but sometimes they will persist and often ignoring it will not make them go away unless you make it absolutely clear you are not interested. Also be aware that in many cases these people can just wander into the hotel restaurants in the evening so expect to see them standing at your table at some point! In the ski resorts there are many people who sell \"Traditional\" Bulgarian bells. They know when tourists arrive and how long they are staying for and will pester you all week to buy a bell. If you make it clear at the start of the week that you do not want a bell they will usually leave you alone (for a few days at least) but if you do not say no, they may force the cheap plastic bell upon you to encourage you to buy one later in the week. The bell men will become your friend for the week as they try to get you to buy a bell. If you really don't want to buy a bell, by the end of the week your bell man will demand his cheap plastic bell back and won't be very happy! Don't feel bad about not buying a bell as they often charge extortionate prices unless you really haggle. If you do buy a bell however, you will find that the bell men will be genuinely friendly and chatty people and really aren't all as bad as they seem!"
