        "text": "After the successful conclusion of the ByzantineBulgarian Wars, and the fall of the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018 Basil II guaranteed the indivisibility of Bulgaria in its former geographic borders and did not officially abolish the local rule of the Bulgarian nobility, who became part of Byzantine aristocracy as archons or strategoi. The former empire was divided into two Byzantine military districts (themes) both headed by a katepano. They wereBulgaria in the west with its capital Skopje (today the capital of Macedonia) its first commander being David Areianites, and Paradunavon in the east with its capital Silistra. [7]\n\nAfter the death of Basil II the empire entered into a period of instability. In 1040, Peter Delyan organized a large-scale rebellion, but failed to restore the Bulgarian state and was killed. Shortly after, the Komnenos dynasty came into succession and halted the decline of the empire. During this time the Byzantine state experienced a century of stability and progress.\n\nFrom this period of Byzantine rule are the frescoes of the St. Panteilimon in Nerezi at 8 km west of Skopje. They show amongst others, six warriors in Byzantine armoury supporting their shields. Such frescoes portraying warriors are by no means unique. Other examples can be found all over the Balkans representing other katapanos or generals.\n\nThree warriors on a fresco in St Pantaleimon Church in Nerezi.\n\nThe church is said to be constructed in 1164 as a foundation of Alexius Angelus Comnenus, a son of Constantine Angelos (1156) and Theodora Komnene, a daughter of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. On an architrave of the church is the inscription: The church of the holy and renowned great-marty Panteleimon was beautifully made with the aid of Lord Alexios Komnenos, son of the purple born Theodora in the month of September, indiction 13, 1164. Ionnikos the monk being hegoumenos.\n\nThe three warriors may be a representation of the military governor (strategos) of the theme Bulgaria together with his commanders (turmachai) of its brigades (turmai). The one in the middle, dressed in purple and a cuirass and armed with sword and shield, being the strategos. [8]\n\nThe three warriors of the other fresco may be their predecessors or succesors.\n\nThree other warrions in St. Pantaleimon Church\n\nLike many other Byzantine institutions, the katepanikion as an administrative subdivision was also adopted in the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nThe arms quarterly on these frescoes are also of a muc later Connetable de France (Charles dAlbret, 1368-1415) on theIcon of St. George in relief, Byzantine from Arta, Greece, 13th century.\n\nKaloyan was a younger brother and heir of Peter IV (Petăr IV) of Bulgaria and Ivan Asen I. In 1187 (a year after the declaration of independence) he was sent as a hostage to Constantinople, from where he escaped and returned to Bulgaria about 1189. After the successive assassinations of both of his brothers, Kaloyan became the Tsar of Bulgaria (1197). Kaloyan pursued his predecessors' aggressive policy against the Byzantine Empire. In 1201 he conquered Konstanteia in Thrace and Varna, and in 1202 most of Slavic Macedonia\n\nA great deal of the diplomatic efforts of Kaloyan consisted of securing an imperial title for himself and the recognition of the head of the Bulgarian church as a patriarch.\n\nInnocent III had written to Kaloyan, inviting him to unite his Church with the Roman Catholic Church, as early as 1199. Wanting to bear the title of Emperor and to restore the prestige, wealth and size of the First Bulgarian Empire, Kaloyan responded in 1202. In this political maneuver, he requesed that Pope Innocent III bestow on him the imperial crown and sceptre that had been held by Simeon I, Peter I, and Samuel and in exchange he might consider communication with Rome. Kaloyan also wanted the Papacy to recognize the head of the Bulgarian Church as a Patriarch. Meanwhile, in an attempt to foster an alliance with Kaloyan, the Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195-1203) recognized his imperial title and promised him patriarchal recognition. The pope was not willing to make concessions on that scale, and when his envoy, Cardinal Leo, arrived in Bulgaria, he anointed the Archbishop Vasilij of Tărnovo as Primate of Bulgarians and Vlachs. Kaloyan only received a crown as rex Bulgarorum et Blachorum or rex Bulgarie et Blachie (\"King of Bulgaria and Wallachia\"), not emperor. [9] He was crowned in Trnovo by cardinal Leo on 7 November 1204. Also Innocent sent him a flag together with a letter explaining its symbolism. [10] This flag bore a cross and the keys of St. Peter, \"pretendit autem non sine mysterio crucem et claves, quia Beatus Petrus Apostolus, et crucem in Christo sustinuit, et claves a Christo recepit\", and another mention of it is found in a letter from Kaloyan to Innocent in 1205. [11] This description however is not exact enough to reconstruct the flag. A possibility for example is: Gules, a (latin-) cross between two keys per pale Or/Argent. Galbreath thinks it was: Gules, a cross between four keys per pale Argent which was later made the flag of Viterbo (Italy).\n\nProbably as a result of this rapidly deteriorating relations between the Latin Empire, supported by Innocent III, and Kaloyan the flag Innocent III had proposed was apparently soon abandoned.\n\nWhile the introduction of a flag symbolizing the subordination of Bulgaria to the Holy See seems to have failed, Kaloyan has used a badge qualifying him as a prince. His signet ring shows a lion which is the badge of such a prince and not of a king let alone an emperor. With it he is referring to his status before he succeeded his brother in 1197.\n\nReconstruction of the garment of Tsar Kaloyan\n\n(from unknown sources)\n\nÆ If this is a reconstruction after an orginal piece found in connection with King Kaloyan it demonstrates his ambition to be recognized as an emperor of the Bulgars as, according to himself in his letters to Innocent III, some of his predecessors had been.\n\nIn 1972 the grave of King Kaloyan was discovered. The corpse, of considerable length, was dressed in purple robes embroidered with pearls and had a red cap decorated with gold on his head. On his feet were red shoes, emblem of armed authority. Last but not least there was a golden signet ring on his fingers showing a quadruped of uncertain kind within the legend Kaloyans Ring.\n\nSignet ring of Kaloyan found in his grave in Veliki Tarnovo.\n\nEmblem: Spotted quadruped passant reguardant (?). L.: X КАЛОЫИО ПРЬСТЕИЬ (= Kaloyans Ring). [12]\n\në Probably the spotted quadruped is a dog and perhaps an early form of the dalmatian dog. This would match with the nickname Skyloïōannēsor John Dog some Byzantine historians gave to Kaloyan, it is said referring to his cruel treatment of the Byzantines.\n\nSuch quadrupeds, sometimes of the shape of a dog or of a marten are known from heraldry from all over the Balkans. Early examplea are the martens on the official dress of sebastocrator Alexander and on the coins of Bela IV (1235-70) and his successors from Slavonia.\n\nCoin of Bela IV and Stephen, minted in Zagreb\n\nIn a way these quadrupeds could be associated with the former Avar kingdom which comprised the kingdom of Hungary (and Croatia) as well as Bulgaria north of the Danube. This makes the nickname John Dog a reference to his origin.\n\nTheodore Svetoslav accompanied his brother-in-law Chaka in an invasion of Bulgaria in 1298. The regency for Ivan II fled Tărnovo in 1299, and Theodore Svetoslav helped convince the Bulgarian nobility to accept Chaka as ruler. However, the armies of the khan of the Golden Horde Toqta entered Bulgaria in pursuit of Chaka, and Theodore Svetoslav promptly organized a plot, deposing Chaka and having him strangled in prison in 1300. Theodore Svetoslav now became emperor of Bulgaria and sent Chaka's severed head as a present to Toqta, who withdrew his armies from the country.\n\nTheodore Svetoslav pursued a ruthless course of action, punishing all who stood in his way. In the face of the new emperor's brutality, some noble factions sought to replace him with other claimants to the throne, backed by Andronikos II. A new claimant appeared in the person of the sebastokratōr Radoslav Voïsil or Vojsil, from Sredna Gora, a brother of the former emperor Smilets, who was defeated, and captured by Theodore Svetoslav's uncle, the despotēs Aldimir (Eltimir), at Krăn in about 1301. Another pretender was the former emperor Michael Asen II, who unsuccessfully tried to advance into Bulgaria with a Byzantine army in about 1302.\n\nAs a consequence of his victories, Theodore Svetoslav felt secure enough to move on to the offensive by 1303 and captured the fortresses of northeastern Thrace, including Mesembria (Nesebăr), Anchialos (Pomorie), Sozopolis (Sozopol), and Agathopolis (Ahtopol) in 1304. The Byzantine counterattack failed at the battle of Skafida near Poros (Burgas), where the co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos was turned to flight.\n\nNevertheless, the war continued, with Michael IX and Theodore Svetoslav taking turns pillaging each other's lands. It only ended with a peace treaty in 1307, cemented with a marriage between Theodore Svetoslav and Theodora, a daughter of Michael IX Palaiologos.\n\nCoin of Theodore Svetoslav\n\nwith two-headed eagle and the name ТЄРТЄР (Terter)\n\nIvan Shishman inherited only parts of his father's realm: the lands between the Iskar River and Silistra, the valley of Sofia, parts of the Rhodope mountains and northern Thrace. To the west, the areas centred around Vidin recognised Ivan Sratsimir as emperor of Bulgaria, while to the east, the Principality of Karvuna under the rule of despot Dobrotitsa, did not recognise the authority Ivan Shishman either.\n\nUnable to resist the attacks of the Ottoman sultan Murad I, Ivan Shishman had to negotiate with him in 1373 and was forced to become an Ottoman vassal. Under this agreement, Bulgaria regained some of the conquered territories such as Ihtiman and Samokov, and began nearly ten years of uneasy peace with the Turks.\n\nDespite the vassalage and the peace treaty, Ottoman raids were renewed in the beginning of the 1380s and culminated in 1385 with the fall of Sofia, the last stronghold of Ivan Shishman to the south of the Balkan Mountains. The vassalage of Ivan Shishman was invalidated in 1388 but reconfirmed soon after when the Ottoman troops had seized the fortresses of Shumen, Madara, Venchan and Ovech and he had been forced to ask for peace after the siege of Nikopol.\n\nWhen the Bulgarian Empire had been devastated in the following years, Ivan, still an Ottoman vassal, was murdered in 1395 in the city of Nikopol.\n\nFrom Ivan Shishman a coin is known showing a lion rampant. This lion rampant, we may be sure, is his badge of rank as an Ottoman vassal, his father and his co-rulers in Vidin and Karvuna bearing the two-headed eagle of a caesar. [17]\n\nCoin of Ivan Shishman\n\nObv: Lion rampant; triple pellets behind head, two pellets behind tail\n\nRev: Large cypher across field; triple-pellet group and single pellet below; additional pellet above.\n\nFlag of burgaria on the portolan of Guillem Soler, 1380.\n\n(Bibl. Nat. Paris)\n\nThe flag, planted in Varna, shows the cypher of Ivan Shishman in red on a yellow cloth.\n\nThe cypher is in the tradition of the tamgha which was also adopted by the Golden Hordе, but is written in cyrillic: Ш(ишьма)Н(ь) ЧР(ь).\n\nCoin of Ivan Sratsimir in Vidin [18]\n\nObv.: Two-headed eagle and cross.\n\nRev.: Tsar with cross and globe.\n\nA flag of Vidin is given by the 14th century Book of Knowledge:\n\nI went [...] to a great city called Vecina. [...]this city of Vecina which is the capital of the kingdom. It has a white flag with four squares. [19]\n\nThe arms of Die Keyser va Bodiin Ivan Sratsimir, can also be found in the Armorial of Gelre Herald. They are:\n\nArms: Quarterly of Romania and Azure. [20]\n\nConstantine II was the son of Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria. He was crowned co-emperor by his father in or before 1395, when he was sent on a mission to the old Bulgarian capital Tărnovo. After his father's arrest and imprisonment by Sultan Bayezid I in 1396 Constantine II claimed the title of Emperor of Bulgaria and was accepted as such by foreign governments, but he is often omitted from listings of rulers of Bulgaria.\n\nIt is supposed that at least some portions of the territory of Vidin may have remained under Constantine II's rule almost until his death in 1422. Together with his cousin Fruzhin, a son of Ivan Shishman, Constantine II took advantage of the Ottoman Interregnum to raise an anti-Ottoman revolt in northwestern Bulgaria. The anti-Ottoman rebellion lasted for half a decade (140813) until the rebels were defeated by Sultan Musa.\n\nConstantine and Fruzhin attempted to make up for their losses by siding with Musa's brother and rival Sultan Mehmed I. After Mehmed I's victory in 1413, Constantine II spent much of his life in Hungary and Serbia. His last possessions in Bulgaria were annexed in 1422, and shortly afterwards he died at the Serbian court on 17 September 1422. His dispossession and death marks the end of the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nIt may readily be accepted that the arms, Sable, three lions passant Or which occur in some 15th century armorials were actually the arms of Constantine II. As they only appear after he had become a refugee in Hungary and Serbia in 1413, they may have been adopted at the court of one of their kings and have been written down there.\n\nAs his cousin Fruzhin ( c. 1460) also bore the title of Tsar of Bulgaria he may be the candidate for the arms Or, three lions passant Sable which also occur in 15th century armorials. Because Fruzhin was mainly based in the Kingdom of Hungary, where he was the ruler of Temes County, both arms may have been codified at the Hungarian court (of King Sigismund 1387-1437).\n\nLeaf from a compilation of Armorials, 1530\n\nBayerische Staatsbibliothek, München, Hss Cod.icon. 391, Fol. 4v\n\nOn this leaf are the arms of the adversaries of Sultan Musa between 1408 and 1413.\n\n1. Fruzhin (*?-1460): Kayser von Pulgarye: Arms: Sable, three lions passant guardant Or.\n\n2. Mehmed I (*1390-1421): Das forpanner der durrkſisſen kaysers: Arms: Gules, a crescent Or.\n\n3. Manuel II (*1347- 1425): Der kayser von Konstantinopel: Arms: Gules, a crowned two-headed eagle Argent [Or].\n\n4. Constantine II (*1370-1422): Pullgarie der allt kd: Arms: Or, a bulls head, a cross potent between its horns, Gules.\n\nThese arms are called the arms of the Duke of Bulgaria with its capital Vidin by Konrad Grüneberg: herzog vo' der wulgry Die haubtstat in d' bilgry haist budem. [22]\n\nAfter Fruzhin and Constantine II had managed to restore their rule over at least a part of the Bulgarian lands the arms Or, three lions passant Sable occur and these may be the arms of Constantine II, replacing the arms with the bulls head. The first mention of these arms are in a copy of Ulrich Richentals Council of Konstanz from 1438-50. [23]\n\nThe 2nd arms of Constantine II\n\nIn: Das Wappenbuch Conrads von Grünenberg, Ritters und Bürgers zu Constanz - BSB Cgm 145 (1480)\n\nBoth arms are depicted in an armorial from the first half of the 16th c.:\n\nFrom this Alexander little more is known than that he was the son of Ivan I Asen (1196) and the brother of Tsar Ivan II Asen (1248). He further was the father of Tsar Koloman II and bore the title of sebastocrator.\n\nNevertheless some items showing a griffin may readily be associated with him. This, in the first place is a portrait of Alexander as the client of a copy of the Historia of Niketas Choniates.\n\nPortrait of a sebastokrator, probably Alexander\n\nFrom: Niketas Choniates: Historia. (Constantinople, 1st half 14th century)\n\nHofbibliothek Wien, Cod. hist. gr. 53. Fol. 291 v°.\n\nThis leaf represents an offcial dressed in a purple himation Byzantine style, decorated with large medallions enclosing white griffins surrounded by five foxes pursuing each other. The official wears a crown with one large gem, as was worn by sebastokrators in the 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nThe griffins are the badges of office of the governors of the (former) roman provinces, Dacia mediterranea with its capital Serdica (Sofia) being one of them. The dogs or quadrupeds are borrowed from the seal of king Kaloyan excavated 1972.Ç Much later such a dog was a beast associated with Bulgaria and Slavonia. [26]\n\nThe hypothesis that the badge of rank or office of Alexander was a griffin is supported by some other items from the beginning of the 13th century also representing a griffin.\n\nThe first is a stone slab from central Greece showing a griffin within a medallion.\n\nThe large medallions on Kaloyan's robes indicate a very high position in the Empire, possibly that of Viceroy of Thrace (prefect of Illyricum).\n\nKaloyan (КАЛѠѢНѢ) was a 13th-century Bulgarian noble, sebastocrator of Sredets (Sofia) and the surrounding region during the Asen dynasty of the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nKaloyan may have been the grandson of Tsar Ivan Asen I (118996) from his younger son sebastocrator Alexander, as he is mentioned as a cousin of Tsar Constantine Tih (125777); however, his relation to the royal family may have been merely titular. Kaloyan was an opponent of Tsar Michael Asen I's (124656) pro-Byzantine policy and took part in the plot against him.\n\nKaloyan inherited the title possibly from his father Aleksandar (d. after 1232), a son of Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria (r. 11891196)[27].[5]\n\nSebastocrator Kaloyan is mainly known as the main donor of Boyana Church, a medieval Eastern Orthodox church in Boyana, Sofia. An inscription from 1259 in the church describes Kaloyan's role in its construction; he is also referred to as a grandson of the Serbian king Saint Stephen.\n\nThe church patrons' inscription in Middle Bulgarian from 1259 reads:\n\n+ взъдвиже сѧ ѿ земѧ и създа сѧ прѣчисты хра\n\nмъ ст҃аго иерарха х҃ва николы ст҃аго и великѡ\n\nславнагѡ мѫченика хв҃а пантелеимwна тече\n\nниемъ и трѹдомъ и любовиаѧ многоаѫ калѡ\n\nѣнѣ севастократора братѹчѧди цр҃ва внѹкъ ст҃а\n\nстефана кралѣ србьскаго написа же сѧ при цр҃\n\nвство блгарское при благовѣрнем и бг҃очь\n\nстивѣмъ и хр҃столюбивѣмъ цр҃и костан\n\nдинѣ асѣна едикто з҃ в лѣто\n\n.ѕ҃.ѱ.ѯ҃з҃\n\n[This immaculate temple of the Holy Christ's hierarch Nicholas and of the Christ's holy and most glorious martyr Panteleimon was erected from the ground and created with the funds, care and great love of Kaloyan, sebastokrator, cousin of the Tsar, grandson of Saint Stephen, King of Serbia. This was written in the Bulgarian Empire under the pious and devout Tsar Constantine Asen. Indiction 7 of the year 6767 [1259].]\n\nThe church also features donor portraits of Kaloyan and his wife Desislava:\n\nPortrait of Sebastokrator Kaloyan and his wife Desislava\n\nin the Church of St. Nicholas and Pantelimon in Boyana, painted in 1259.\n\nOn the dress of Desislava large medallions of two lions endorsed, emblem of agrand duchess. On her mantle medallions with golden [two-headed] eagles of a sebastokratissa\n\nOn this fresco the resemblance of Kaloyan and his predecessor Alexander is striking and feeds the hypothesis that he in fact was his son. Here Kaloyan is dressed in a purple himation and a green mantle. No griffins are seen. Instead his wife has large medallions on her dress, on her himation lions addorsed, a badge of office which may be associated with the office of a megas doux or byzantine commander in chief. [28] The two headed eagles may be the badge of a member of the imperial house (Paleologos). In some cases indeed the wife of the official could wear his distinctives on her dress.\n\nThe change of badges of office may mean that, after the accession of Constantine Tih Kaloyan was promoted to a chief commander.\n\nIn 1277 the title of sebastocrator was abolished in Bulgaria and the title of despot was introduced. The badge of rank of such a despot apparently was a two headed eagle, a badge usually associated with a caesar.\n\nAt the end of the 14th century Bulgaria became a part of the Ottoman eyalet Rumelia, consisting of the despotate Epirus, the kingdom of Bulgaria and the former Latin Empire and its vassals. This eyalet was at first administered from Sofya, then from Edirne and from 1520 until the 18th century from Sofya again.\n\nWithin the eyalet Rumeli the former Bulgarian Empire was divided into the sançaks Sofya and Nigbolu (Nikopol). These sançaks were roughly located on the former roman provinces of Dacia and Moesia II.\n\nAfter the fall of Constantinople in 1453 the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror (1451-81) initially continued the use of the heraldic emblems of Epirus, Byzantium and the Latin Empire. According to Conrad Grüneberg (1483) these were the arms with the cross between the four crosses encircled of the Latin Empire, the cross between the four B of Byzantium and the arms with the two-headed eagle of Epirus.[31]\n\nArms of the Latin Empire in the Grüneberg Armorial, 1480\n\nIf this is true or just wishful thinking, these arms do not reappear later in the context of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn the time of Ottoman Rule the emblems of the Ottoman Sultan and of the Ottoman state were valid in Rumelia. They were in the first place the tughra of the reigning sultan which was used on imperial decrees or firmans.\n\nHeader of a firman of Sultan Mustafa III, 1870\n\nfor the establishment of a Bulgarian Exarchate.\n\nThe state was represented by a banner which, after the victory of Mehmet I in 1413 was a red cloth with a yellow crescent. Such flags are represented on many 15th-17th century portolans, the banner represented in Rumelia always red. In West European sources these banners were sometimes taken as a model for a coat of arms which then became Gules, a crescent Or.\n\nFlags of the Ottoman Empire, 1857-76\n\nThe eyâlet Rumeli was administered by a beylerbey or governor general, who was a pasha with two tughs (horse-tails) as a badge of rank. Later they were dressed in the official dress of an Ottoman governor general.\n\nAt the end of the 16th century a coat of arms for Bulgaria appears in the Korenić-Neorić Armorial of 1595. This is a copy of the lost original of the Ohmućević Armorial (Ohmućević grbovnik) commissioned by Petar Ohmućević (1599), a Spanish admiral of Ragusan origin, at some point between 1584 and 1594. It probably is an invention of him and may have been based on unknown sources or just unfounded assumptions. As the arms are a lion it may be based for example on the assumption that a lion was the proper emblem of a ban, governor or bey.\n\nIn any case, the arms presented for Bulgaria were:Or, a lion Gules.\n\nIn 1619 the arms with the lion were explicitely chosen by some Bulgarian notables in a petition to the Venetian senate.\n\nThey were copied in many other armorials which appeared in Illyria or Western Rumelia and Bosna.\n\nBy Pavlo Ritter Vitezovic (1652-1713), a Croatian writer and historian, the tinctures of the arms were reversed, the former arms of Bulgaria becoming now the arms of Macedonia and vice versa. It is not known what Vitezovic had in mind by this change but since then the arms for Bulgaria were supposed to be Gules, a lion Or.\n\nArms of Bulgaria by Pavao Ritter Vitezovic\n\nFrom his Stemmatographia, 1701\n\nThe Sançak of Sofya was established around 1393. Initially it had two nahiyahs: Znepolje and Visok. Its first sançakbey was Ince Balaban, also referred to as 'the conqueror of Sofya'. One of its sanjakbeys was Malkoçoğlu Ali Bey, a member of the Malkoçoğlu family, who died in 1514.\n\nSoon after the establishment of this sançak Sofya became the seat of the Rumelia Eyalet. Although beglerbegs of Rumelia in early periods sometimes stayed in Bitola, Sofya remained the seat and center of Rumelia Eyalet. Since it was a seat of the Rumelian beglerbey Sançak of Sofia had the status of Pasha Sançak (Turkish: Paşa Sancağı), the main sançak of the Elayet.\n\nThe Sançak of Sofya and its 50 timars were registered for tax purposes in 1446 and 1455, and also in 1488/1489 and 1491. At the end of 16th and beginning of 17th century Ni belonged to the Sançak of Sofya\n\nAt the end of 18th century it was under frequent attacks by Osman Pazvantoglu. Between 18461864 the Sançak of Sofya belonged to Ni Eyalet while from 18641878 it belonged to Danube Vilayet. At that time it had the following kazas: Sofya, Kyustendil, Samokov, Dupnica, Radomir, Zlatica, Orhanie and Dumaja.\n\nThe vignette shows the Bulgarian Lion in a landscape, trampling down the Ottoman national flag.\n\nIn 1876 the Bulgarians revolted in the April Uprising which was crushed by the Ottomans, who for the purpose brought irregular Ottoman troops (bashi-bazouks) from outside the area. The massacres in the following course of events aroused a broad public reaction and provoked the 187677 Constantinople Conference of the Great Powers.\n\nTurkey's refusal to implement the conference decisions gave the Russians a long-awaited chance to realise their long-term objectives with regard to the Ottoman Empire. Having its reputation at stake, Russia declared war on the Ottomans in April 1877. The Bulgarians also fought alongside the advancing Russians. The Coalition was able to inflict a decisive defeat on the Ottomans at the Battle of Shipka Pass and at Pleven and by January 1878 they had liberated much of the Bulgarian lands.\n\nAn autonomous Bulgarian Prinsicpality was set up by the Treaty of San Stefano, signed on 3 March 1878. It comprised the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, including the regions of Moesia, Thrace and Macedonia. Though the principality was de jure only autonomous it de facto functioned independently. However, trying to preserve the balance of power in Europe and fearing the establishment of a large Russian client state on the Balkans, the other Great Powers were reluctant to agree to the treaty.\n\nAs a result, the Treaty of Berlin (1878), revised the earlier treaty, and scaled back the proposed Bulgarian state. The new territory of Bulgaria was limited between the Danube and the Stara Planina range, with its seat at the old Bulgarian capital of Veliko Turnovo and including Sofia.\n\nSeal of the Provisional Government of Bulgaria"
