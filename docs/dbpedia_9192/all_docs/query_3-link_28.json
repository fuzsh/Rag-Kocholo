        "text": "Greater Bulgaria\n\nThe ancient “Bulgarians” were a union of nomadic tribes formed in the 5th century AD in the plains of the Russian steppe. They were a confederation of warrior tribes and shepherds gathered from various sources: Persian, Alani, Sarmatian (the inhabitants of the plains of the Volga who fought the Romans), and mainly Turkish. This confederation took over the plains from the lower Volga to the Don and the Dnieper Rivers. They spoke a type of Turkish, some words of which remain in the Bulgarian language (about twenty). They worshiped the sky god Tangri and were led by a khan[1], who was considered his representative on earth, but was assisted by a council of six tribal chiefs.\n\nWhat was the secret of their power? What held this confederation of different tribes together? One can only speculate. It could have been a combination of shared religious beliefs, strong leadership, mutual defense agreements, and the economic benefits of cooperation that helped maintain unity among these diverse groups.\n\nIn the 6th century AD, the Bulgarian Union successfully took control of large areas, leading to the rise of Great Bulgaria, with its capital at Taman near the Sea of Azov. The greatest khan, Kubrat, ruled from 600-642 AD (7th century). This was a time of significant geopolitical changes, including the wars between the Persians and the Byzantines under Emperor Heraclius, the beginning of the spread of Arab rule, and the rise of Islam.\n\nThe ancient Bulgarians were in contact with various neighboring civilizations, including the Armenians, the Kingdom of Kushans to the east, Sassanian Persia to the southeast, the Byzantines to the south, and the Germanic tribes to the west. Despite the turbulent world events, the kingdom of Great Bulgaria thrived, growing rich from trade between the East and the West. Kubrat was a contemporary of the last great Sassanid king, Yazdgard III, and was a close friend of his. He traded with the kingdoms of Khorezm and Sogdiana in Central Asia and maintained good relations with the Byzantine Empire, where he probably grew up as a captive boy.\n\nKubrat had five sons, and despite his pleas for unity, they broke up the kingdom after his death, each going in a different direction. One of the sons, later called Khan Asparuh, invaded the territories of present-day Romania and Bulgaria with the help of 50,000 warriors and established his seat at the mouth of the Danube. He defeated the Byzantines in 681 and established the first Slavic-Bulgarian state. His warriors intermarried with local Slavs and the remnants of the Thracian population, and this mixture finally crystallized into a nation with the acceptance of Christianity in the 9th century AD.\n\nGreat Bulgaria, on the other hand, reached the end of its path and declined shortly after Kubrat’s death. Remnants of its glorious past can be found in the name of the city of Bulghar on the Volga. In fact, the Tatars, Kazans, and Chuvash people in today’s Russia are probably of Bulgarian origin, at least partially.\n\nFirst Bulgarian Empire\n\nIn 682 AD, Khan Asparuh arrived with 50,000 mounted warriors at the mouth of the Danube and took control of the northern regions of Bulgaria. The Byzantine army sent against him was decisively defeated. Following the weakening of the Byzantine Empire due to wars with the Persians and invasions by the Arabs, a power vacuum emerged in these parts of the world. Into this space entered the brave Bulgarian Turkish warriors, who made an alliance with the local inhabitants. Unlike Byzantium, the new Bulgarian kingdom initially lacked a developed urban culture and was based on a decentralized organization and the loyalties of tribal chiefs. Despite this, it represented a new and fresh force in the region.\n\nThe Bulgarians came to the aid of the Byzantines in their wars with the Arabs. In fact, the Bulgarian Khan Tervel saved the Byzantines at the beginning of the 8th century from the Arab invasion and the siege of Constantinople. During his time, the statue of the Madara Rider was probably carved on a rock cliff, not far from the ancient capital Pliska.\n\nAt the end of the 8th century, a talented and formidable man named Khan Krum came to power in Bulgaria. He transformed the new entity into the strongest power in the Balkans, fighting the Byzantines, defeating them, besieging Constantinople, and obliging the rulers to pay an annual tribute to his coffers. The Byzantines were protected by a line of fortresses starting from Burgas and ending in Sofia, controlling the passes of the Rhodope Mountains. Khan Krum conquered these fortresses one by one, defeated and killed Emperor Nicophoros, turned his skull into a silver-plated drinking vessel, and conquered the city of Nesebar on the shores of the Black Sea. The capital of Bulgaria at that time was Pliska in northeastern Bulgaria. Krum gathered a formidable army, conquered Adrianople, exiled its population (including the later Byzantine Emperor Basil I), and organized to conquer Constantinople. However, he died suddenly before he could succeed in his plan, which was seen as a miracle by the Byzantines.\n\nThe next khan after Krum was Omurtag, a great builder and man of peace who succeeded the man of war. Omurtag first built Preslav, which later became the new capital. He was an enlightened pagan ruler, except when dealing with Christians, whom he persecuted. He signed a peace treaty with the Byzantines, returned territories to them, and fortified the border. Omurtag also fought against the Frankish Germans advancing into Pannonia. He is considered the last of the great pagan kings, a philosopher supported by the priesthood of the god Perun (the thunder god after whom the Pirin Mountains were named).\n\nAcceptance of Christianity\n\nIn 852 AD, Khan Boris came to power in the new Bulgarian kingdom. These were days of change in Byzantium, which managed to end the civil war and embark on a new path of prosperity and expansion under the leadership of the vigorous Macedonian dynasty. The man who influenced the second half of the 9th century was Patriarch Photius, the head of the Byzantine Orthodox Church, the only one recognized as a Church Father after the four great ones of the 4th and 5th centuries AD. He was a well-educated man, ahead of his time, who owned the largest library in the world and knew several languages, including Arabic and apparently Hebrew. He founded a university institution in Constantinople called Magnaura, which imitated the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma), the important Islamic university in Baghdad.\n\nPhotius recruited people from Magnaura’s faculty of languages for expeditions to the new peoples north of the empire, he sends them with them a proposal for a sort of “package deal”: that suggest that if they accept Christianity, then Photius will send them scholars to teach them the sciences: engineering, medicine, agriculture and more. Of course it was not a simple as I describe, but for the purpose of understanding the principle at play, let’s adopt for a moment the story of the “package deal”.\n\nAs part of the “package,” Photius sought to establish educational institutions—universities where the younger generation could be trained and educated to lead the emerging country. In some cases, scholars sent by Photius offered to invent an alphabet in the language of those nations, translate the holy books into that language, write new books to document national history, and build a new Christian national ethos. This would enable the king to reign by the grace of God and receive double loyalty from the subjects: both civil and religious.\n\nIn addition to his political and religious interests, Photius likely saw the creation of new Slavic states as an opportunity to correct past distortions and establish a purer form of Christianity, closer to the original teachings of Jesus. This Christianity would be a spiritual path to enlightenment, not just a system of belief, related to an inner personal religious quest and the possibility of reaching enlightenment.\n\nPhotius chose the head of the language department at Magnaura, Professor Cyril, and his brother Methodius, to lead a delegation of scholars to surrounding nations with a tempting offer. The brothers selected 300 students and assistants to accompany them and initially approached the king of the Khazars, who at that time were leaning towards Judaism, with an offer to become Christians in exchange for establishing an academic institution. The expedition reached the Volga steppe, but the Khazarian king rejected the offer, and they returned empty-handed to Constantinople and Thessaloniki.\n\nTwo years later, they were sent to Moravia, where they managed to win the favor of the local ruler and received partial recognition for their enterprise from both Rome and Byzantium. The brothers and their assistants developed an ancient Slavic alphabet called Glagolitic as part of the package deal. They conducted preaching journeys all over Central Europe and the Northern Balkans. However, after Cyril and Methodius died, the mission of the Orthodox Church in Moravia was severely attacked by the Catholics. Many of the students were executed, and the five most senior among them were tortured but eventually released. Three of them ended up in Bulgaria.\n\nCyril and Methodius\n\nCyril and Methodius are the two brothers who brought Christianity to the Slavs. Methodius was born in 817, and Cyril ten years later. Their father was the military commander of the Thessaloniki region, and their mother was Slavic. When their father died, Cyril was 14 years old, and the brothers came under the protection of a senior minister in the Byzantine Empire named Theoktistos. This minister was an educated and influential person involved in establishing the university at Magnaura. He arranged for Cyril to study there, where he soon became one of the institution’s outstanding students.\n\nCyril turned out to be a genius in languages and theology; he knew Arabic and Hebrew and began to teach as a full-fledged professor, eventually becoming the head of the language department. He was also ordained as a priest. Meanwhile, his brother Methodius moved to the Polychron Monastery in today’s northwestern Turkey. There, he rose through the ranks until he was elected abbot, which involved him in politics and the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the empire, making him influential.\n\nCyril’s teacher and personal guide was Photius the Great. Recognizing his student’s talents, Photius convinced the emperor to send Cyril on diplomatic missions. Initially, Cyril was sent to the Caliph’s court in Baghdad, a place Photius knew personally, with the aim of improving relations with the Caliphate and exchanging information. Then, in 860, Cyril was sent together with his brother Methodius and a number of helpers to the Khazars in the northern Black Sea region to convince them to become Christians. However, this mission did not bear fruit, so the delegation returned to Constantinople, and the brothers waited for further missions.\n\nIn 862, Cyril and Methodius set out on their most important mission, which became their life’s work. The Moravian king Rastislav asked Emperor Michael III to send scholars to help in the Christianization of his subjects. Although Christianity had already arrived in Moravia and many inhabitants had converted, it was Catholic Christianity. Rastislav, seeking independence from Frankish influence on his country, wanted to obtain political and religious support from Byzantium.\n\n“Teaching without an alphabet and books is like writing on water,” said Cyril and Methodius to the Byzantine Emperor Michael III before they left for Moravia. Until the 9th century, the Church argued that there were three sacred languages in which God could speak: Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. Hebrew was not suitable for the purposes of Christianizing the Slavs, Greek had been distorted over generations and moved away from its purity, and Latin was identified with Rome, which claimed that only it could be used as a sacred language and that the use of another language would defile the word of God. Therefore, Rome objected to the creation of a new sacred language, but the Byzantines saw the importance of the task and had no objection.\n\nAnd so, Cyril, Methodius, and their students created the first Slavic alphabet, called “Glagolitic,” which consisted of 38 letters with both numerical and verbal values. The source of the letters was the sounds of the Slavic language, which, at that time, were similar across various Slavic regions. The creation of a new alphabet was significant because it allowed for the translation of the Holy Scriptures into Slavic, making the ancient Slavic language a sacred language like Latin, and becoming the mother tongue of all Slavs.\n\nThe brothers trained students to help them with the monumental task and began translating the Holy Scriptures into Slavic in 863. They also wrote the first Slavic code of civil laws. During their travels to Moravia, they spread the books and the gospel, receiving enthusiastic support everywhere. However, their success brought resistance and suspicion from Rome and the German Catholic clergy. The brothers were summoned for an investigation in Rome. Surprisingly, they were recognized and blessed for their work by the Pope, who saw their efforts as part of the broader Christian mission, aligning with the Roman version of Christianity rather than necessarily conflicting with the Byzantine version.\n\nOn the journey to Rome, two significant events occurred. First, Cyril and Methodius were welcomed in the regions of Pannonia—modern-day Hungary and Serbia—where they sowed the seeds of Christian Orthodoxy in Serbia. Second, Cyril died shortly after their visit to Rome, leaving Methodius and their devoted students to continue the work. These events took place three years after they began their mission, in 865. Methodius continued the enterprise until his death twenty years later.\n\nFor twenty years, Methodius and his disciples traveled throughout Pannonia and Moravia, spreading the Slavic Orthodox prayer formula and the sacred books in the Slavic language. Behind the scenes, a fierce struggle ensued between them and the Patriarch of Salzburg and the German clergy for control of the religious district and authority. The Germans argued that Methodius and his followers were introducing Byzantine prayer formulas through the Slavic language and directing people toward Byzantine Orthodox Christianity. Methodius contended that he should be recognized as the religious authority responsible for these areas, and his disciples as the executors of his work.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Methodius managed to maintain the upper hand, supported by local kings and recognized by Rome, which helped keep tensions below the surface. However, after Methodius’s death in 885, the Pope removed his recognition of Methodius’s successor, Gozard, as Archbishop of the regions of Pannonia and Moravia. Instead, the Pope appointed Methodius’s opponents, leading to the suppression of his followers.\n\nSt. Clement and St. Nahum\n\nThe holy brothers Cyril and Methodius had three hundred assistants and five close disciples: Clement, Nahum, Sava, Angelarius, and Gorazd. After Methodius’s death and the removal of the Pope’s recognition, the German priests persecuted the assistants and sold them into slavery. The five main aides to Cyril and Methodius were tortured, imprisoned, and expelled from Moravia.\n\nTwo of them, Clement and Nahum, were preparing to return to their home in Thessaloniki, but on their way back, they stopped in Pliska, the capital of Bulgaria. There, they translated ancient books from Greek into Slavic and won the king’s favor. The king requested that Nahum stay in the nearby Preslav Monastery to be responsible for the education of the princes and the children of the nobility, while Clement moved to Ohrid to establish the first Slavic university of its kind. Both of them were tasked with the assimilation of the Christian faith in Bulgaria, which they successfully accomplished.\n\nThe persecutions in Moravia led to the destruction of most of the books of Cyril and Methodius, forcing Clement and Nahum to start anew. Their work in Bulgaria fulfilled the mission of bringing light and enlightenment to the Slavs. Clement improved the Glagolitic alphabet invented by Cyril, transforming it into the Cyrillic alphabet, which is still used by Bulgarians, Russians, and other Slavic peoples today.\n\nKhan Boris realized the benefits of making the country Christian; he adopted Orthodox Christianity and moved the capital to a new place called Pliska. In the old capital, there was too much power in the hands of the boyars, the nobles who opposed Christianity, and the pagan priests who supported them. Khan Boris adopted the Christian name “Michael” and called himself Tsar (Emperor) instead of Khan. At the end of his days, he retired to a monastery. After a bloody struggle for power, his son Simeon came to power. Simeon was personally educated by Saint Nahum and was initially destined to become a clergyman and monk, but life had other plans for him.\n\nOn Plaosnik Hill above the beautiful Lake Ohrid in Macedonia (then part of the Bulgarian Empire), a university was established under the leadership of Saint Clement, where hundreds of people studied. Clement tirelessly wrote hymns and prayers and translated the books of the Bible, the stories of saints and martyrs, the writings of the patriarchs, and Christian philosophy into Slavic. He taught about religious life and the enlightenment of the soul, creating a center for Slavic culture and Christianity, the first of its kind. In 893, he was officially appointed the first Slavic bishop in the Balkans.\n\nOver the years, Clement requested that Nahum, his brother and co-worker, move to Ohrid to help him run the university, and so it was. Saint Nahum became the head of the University of Ohrid, while Clement concentrated on his role as the religious head of the Bulgarians. As a result of their efforts, 3,500 students graduated from the First Slavic University. The curriculum included poetry, Slavic speech, translation of books from Greek to Slavic, law, religious and civil history, nature studies, philosophy, medicine, and more. Together with Clement, Nahum built the Monastery of Archangels Michael and Gabriel, known today as St. Nahum’s Monastery, on the other side of Lake Ohrid.\n\nA few years after he arrived in Ohrid, Saint Nahum’s health deteriorated. Because of this, he retired to the monastery he founded and spent the rest of his days in isolation and prayer. After many years of public activity in Moravia, Preslav, and Ohrid, Nahum’s soul was tired of people and longed to return to monasticism and reunite with God. He retired to the remote monastery and spent his last years there performing miracles, effectively starting the monastic tradition of Bulgaria and Macedonia. The monastery soon became a place of pilgrimage, a center for learning, and especially for healing, since St. Nahum was a physician. He died and was buried in the monastery in 910.\n\nClement died ten years after Nahum and was buried in the Monastery of St. Panteleimon, which he himself built at the site of the first Slavic university on Plaosnik Hill in Ohrid. Many writings from his time remain, including the Gospel of Mary, the Sinai Psalms, prayer books, the Vatican Codex, and more.\n\nGolden age of Bulgaria\n\nTsar Boris converted Bulgaria to Christianity and received God’s blessing. As a result, the reign of his son, Tsar Simeon I, is considered the golden age of Bulgaria, which at that time was equal in power to Byzantium and even threatened its primacy. Simeon’s dream was to create a Greek-Slavic kingdom in which he would be the supreme ruler from the capital in Constantinople. This ambition led to a series of difficult wars with the Byzantines, which drained the life and power out of the nation.\n\nSimeon was educated as a child by St. Nahum and later studied at Magnaura (Photius’ University in Constantinople), where he became familiar with Greek philosophy. Initially becoming a monk, a chain of events—including his brother’s attempts to eliminate Christianity—brought him to power. When he ascended to the throne, the other side of his character was revealed: that of a fierce warrior. He transformed the new capital, Preslav, into a city second only to Constantinople in terms of size and splendor.\n\nThanks to his strength and power, the Bulgarian Church was recognized as independent during Simeon’s reign. It was the first to be recognized as an independent Orthodox Church outside the five original Patriarchates (Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem) that had existed for 900 years. Additionally, the new Slavic alphabet was recognized as a sacred alphabet, joining the three original sacred languages (Hebrew, Greek, and Latin).\n\nDuring the wars with Constantinople, a Byzantine astrologer discovered that Simeon’s fate was connected to a column in the local forum in Constantinople. On May 27, 927, when they cut the top of the column, Simeon fell dead hundreds of kilometers away.\n\nDuring the time of Simeon’s successor, Tsar Peter, Bulgaria was exhausted from the wars. Throughout the mighty empire, the Bogomil heresy began to spread, and with it the influence of Bulgarian monks under the leadership of Saint John of Rila (Saint Rilsky). From a security and political point of view, a period of weakness and chaos began due to the raids of the Hungarians and the strengthening of the Byzantines. Additionally, gangs of robbers led by Peter’s brother, Michael, spread in the western regions of the empire. In the last years of Tsar Peter’s rule, a Russian army invaded Bulgaria and destroyed Preslav in 967.\n\nIn Byzantium, a talented general named John Tzimiskes came to power. He conquered large areas in the Rhodope Mountains and settled Armenian exiles there. He defeated the independent Paulician kingdom that existed in Armenia (a type of Gnostic heresy) and exiled many of them to the Balkans, effectively subjugating large parts of Bulgaria under his rule.\n\nHowever, a new Bulgarian revival period began with the rise of the Comitopoli brothers—David, Moses, Aaron, and Samuel—in western Bulgaria. They led a rebellion against the Byzantines, resembling the Israeli Hasmonean Maccabee brothers. Their father was a noble, probably the ruler of Sofia, and their mother was Armenian. They rebelled in the name of King Boris II, the successor of Tsar Peter, who was a prisoner in Byzantium. At the end of the struggle, the only surviving brother, Samuel, revived the Bulgarian kingdom, now ruled from a new capital, the city of Ohrid on the shores of Lake Ohrid in Macedonia, the site of the University of St. Clement. Tsar Samuel ruled a large empire for twenty years, from 993 to 1014, and managed to take control of eastern Bulgaria for a while. He also conquered Serbia, northern Greece, and parts of Albania. Samuel was an enlightened ruler, and some claim that he supported the Bogomil movement that spread at that time in the Balkans.\n\nIn the end, after forty years of independence, Samuel was defeated by Emperor Basil II—known as the “Bulgar-slayer”—in 1014. The decisive battle took place on the plain of Kleidion. The emperor captured 14,000 of Samuel’s soldiers, blinded them, and sent them back in groups of a hundred, each led by a one-eyed soldier. At the sight of this terrible spectacle, Tsar Samuel collapsed and died. Following the defeat, the independent Bulgarian Church was abolished, the Archbishopric in Ohrid was subordinated to the Patriarchate in Constantinople, and Greek priests suppressed prayers in the Slavic language and the tradition of the Slavic Church. The entire Balkans fell under Byzantine rule once again.\n\nHowever, during the existence of the First Bulgarian Empire, the seeds that would bear fruit in the next thousand years were sown. The golden age of the First Bulgarian Empire, which lasted from the time of Tsar Boris to the time of Tsar Samuel, determined the course and character of the Bulgarian nation and culture thereafter. Following this period, Bulgaria endured 200 years of Byzantine occupation and oppression, which ended with the rebellion and renewed liberation, leading to the establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire at the end of the 12th century.\n\nSecond Bulgarian Empire\n\nBulgaria was under Byzantine occupation for nearly 200 years, from the defeat of Tsar Samuel in 1014 to the rebellion of the Asen brothers in 1185. Samuel was one of the Comitopoli brothers—four Maccabee-style brothers who fought for the independence of Bulgaria at the end of the First Empire period. Therefore, it is symbolic that three other Maccabee-style brothers—the Asen brothers—unleashed the miracle of the new rebellion and heralded the founding of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom.\n\nTowards the end of the 11th century, the Byzantines weakened. The Seljuks defeated them and conquered much of Turkey, the Hungarians conquered Belgrade, and nomadic tribes of Tatars and Pechenegs arrived from the west of Russia, raiding throughout the Balkans. Despite these challenges, the Byzantine Empire managed to recover under the leadership of the energetic Comnenian dynasty. Emperor Alexius I Comnenus (1081-1118) played a decisive role in the Crusades and persecuted the Bogomils. His biography, the “Alexiad,” written by his daughter Anna Comnena, is a valuable source for studying the period. In 1083, Bachkovo Monastery was built near Plovdiv to strengthen the Orthodox faith and was inhabited by monks from Georgia\n\nIn 1185, the Normans conquered Thessaloniki, and the last Comnenian emperor was murdered in Constantinople. The weak Angelos dynasty came to power. Seizing the moment, brothers Peter and Asen traveled to Constantinople to request autonomy, but they were publicly humiliated by the new emperor Isaac II, including Asen receiving a slap in the face. This humiliation sparked a rebellion in their hometown of Yantra (later Veliko Tarnovo), which quickly spread throughout the Balkan range and northeastern Bulgaria.\n\nThe rebels, with the help of an alliance with the Cuman horsemen—nomadic war tribes of Tatar origin who had recently arrived in the region—defeated the imperial armies. This marked the second time that local Slavic and Vlach inhabitants joined forces with nomadic tribes of Turkish origin, thereby gaining significant military power and political independence. Several thousand Cuman cavalry constituted the backbone of the new Bulgarian army, and the Bulgarians joined them en masse.\n\nIn 1196, the brothers Asen and Peter were murdered, much like the Maccabees. Their brother Kaloyan the Brave then came to power, becoming one of Bulgaria’s greatest rulers and the founder of a large and powerful kingdom. Kaloyan ruled for more than ten years until 1207. During his reign, Constantinople fell to a crusader army that conquered it in 1204, dividing the Byzantine Empire into three smaller states.\n\nIn 1205, the Crusaders attempted to conquer Bulgaria but were defeated, with King Baldwin captured and imprisoned in a tower of the new capital, Veliko Tarnovo. This defeat broke the power of the Crusaders, allowing the Byzantines to establish a kingdom in Nicaea, which eventually recaptured Constantinople in 1261. Kaloyan conquered Macedonia in 1207 but was murdered during the siege of Thessaloniki. After his death, an incompetent man named Boril, known for suppressing the Bogomils, became king. He was replaced in 1218 by the son of Asen I, Tsar Ivan Asen II, who ruled from 1218 to 1241 and became one of the most talented rulers of the Second Bulgarian State.\n\nIvan Asen II married princesses from the royal dynasties of the Serbs, Hungarians, Byzantines, and Latins. He defeated the Byzantine Kingdom of Epirus on the Day of the Forty Saints and built the Church of the Forty Saints in Veliko Tarnovo in honor of the victory. Ivan Asen II re-established the Bulgarian Orthodox Patriarchate of Veliko Tarnovo, while Ohrid remained an important archdiocese. He erected a citadel at the entrance to the Rhodope Mountains named after him and supported the monastery in nearby Bachkovo.\n\nIvan Asen II organized the financial system and minted coins, promoted literature and art, encouraged trade based on good relations with Dubrovnik merchants, and maintained safety on the roads. His reign marked a new golden age, but it was followed by a prolonged period of decline. External events did not work in Bulgaria’s favor: this was a period of Mongol invasions, a resurgent Byzantine Empire, and internal corruption and problems. In 1277, a farmer named Ivaylo, a pig herder, led a rebellion and became tsar for two years. Although he had visions of a great destiny, in the end, he was no better than the other kings.\n\nThe Serbian kingdom began to grow stronger and eventually became the dominant power in the Balkans, surpassing Bulgaria. Stefan Nemanja established the Serbian Empire and Kingdom in 1168, and his son Sveti Sava founded the independent Serbian Church, maintaining close friendship ties with the Bulgarian king, Ivan Asen II. Sveti Sava died in Tarnovo while traveling there and was first buried in the Church of the Forty Martyrs (eventually his remains were returned to Serbia).\n\nKings Stefan Uroš I (1243–1276) and Stefan Milutin (1282–1321) brought Serbia to heights that overshadowed its neighbor. King Stefan Dečanski (1321–1331) defeated the Bulgarian Tsar Michael Shishman at the Battle of Velbazhd (Kjustendil). The greatest Serbian king, Stefan Dušan (1331–1355), conquered Ohrid, Thessaloniki, and Mount Athos, becoming the Slavic tsar who dreamed of inheriting Byzantium, much like the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I hundreds of years before him.\n\nThe last great Bulgarian tsar was Theodore Svetoslav (1298–1322). He succeeded in expelling the Mongols and executed their supporters by throwing them from a cliff in Tarnovo, led by Patriarch Joakim III. He conquered large areas from the weakening Byzantines, including Nessebar, Sozopol, and other coastal regions, fostering brisk trade with Genoa and Venice. Art reached new heights, and a school of original painting was founded in Veliko Tarnovo.\n\nThe next tsar, Ivan Alexander (1331–1371), united the two parts of Bulgaria and ruled for 40 years. Bulgaria became the main supplier of goods, wood, and wheat to Byzantium, and a peace treaty was signed between the two countries. This period saw a flourishing of the economy, art, and literature. A Venetian quarter was established in Nessebar, and an academy of knowledge and art was founded in Kilifarevo, near Tarnovo.\n\nHowever, the feudal system deprived and enslaved the peasants, and the Turks crossed the Dardanelles and began raiding the land. Two church conferences held in Tarnovo in 1350 and 1360 failed to reconcile the internal divisions within the church. There were religious disputes regarding the tradition of Theosis and Hesychasm, and an irreconcilable rift with the Bogomils.\n\nDuring this difficult time, Ivan Alexander leaves his Christian wife and marries a Jewish woman named Theodora, causing a rift in the aristocracy. He divides the kingdom between Theodora’s son, Ivan Shishman, the ruler of Tarnovo, and the son from his previous wife, Ivan Sratsimir, the ruler of Vidin.\n\nWhile the Bulgarians argue among themselves, the Ottomans advance. Sultan Murad conquers parts of Bulgaria one by one, establishing his capital in Adrianople, conquering Plovdiv, and finally Sofia and Tarnovo in 1393. The last tsar, Ivan Shishman, tries to rebel against the Ottomans and fight them back with the help of European forces. King Sigismund of Hungary leads a crusade against the Ottomans in 1396 with an army of French knights, but in the decisive battle near the city of Nikopol on the banks of the Danube, Sultan Bayezid defeats the joint forces. Thus, the attempts come to an end, along with Christian independence in Bulgaria. The Turks exile a large part of the Bulgarian elites and settle their own nobles in the new land. They end the independent Bulgarian Patriarchate and burn the capital, Veliko Tarnovo. Finally, they capture Vidin and Dobruja at the mouth of the Danube.\n\nThe 14th century is a time of calamity for the Bulgarians. The Black Plague devastates the population, the Ottomans advance and conquer the country, and religious and political disputes divide the people. However, it is also a time of cultural renaissance, expressed in painting, carving, writing, and research, parallel to the Paleological cultural renaissance flourishing in the Byzantine Empire. The paintings in the Boyana Church on Mount Vitosha are an example of this.\n\nThe great and important figure at the end of the century is Patriarch Evtimiy, the last head of the independent Bulgarian Church between 1375 and 1393. Evtimiy was a student of the great Hesychast monks on Mount Athos, such as Gregory of Palamas and Gregory of Sinai. He was a mystic and scholar who began the enterprise of revising the translations of the Holy Scriptures into Slavic and establishing new grammar rules for the Bulgarian language. This was no small task, as any change in a word, comma, or syllable was believed to affect the entire universe.\n\nEvtimiy began his work in the Bulgarian Zograph Monastery on Mount Athos. In 1371, he moved to Veliko Tarnovo and founded the Patriarchal Monastery of the Holy Trinity there, which became the center of linguistic and literary work, a school for correcting texts. The products of this school became the standard of Bulgarian Slavic religious literature. Ultimately, he was appointed Patriarch of Bulgaria, and in the absence of the king, he also became the protector of Tarnovo against the Ottoman siege in 1393. With the fall of the city, he moved with his students to the Bachkovo Monastery, where he died and was buried in 1404.\n\nEvtimiy prepared the Bulgarian bookshelf for the days of darkness ahead, and his work has been compared to that of Moses or Ptolemy I, the founder of the Library of Alexandria. He wrote biographies, prayers, liturgical rules, and books of thought and spirituality for the Bulgarian Church, fortifying Bulgarian Christianity against the Bogomil heresies and Islamic influence. Among other works, he wrote the stories of Saint Petka and the holy monk Ivan Rilski, who became mother and father figures for the masses of common people.\n\nread article – Bulgarian Christianity\n\nBibliography\n\nBakalova, K.
