The Bulgarian-Ottoman wars resulted in the collapse of the Bulgarian Empire and its conquest by the Ottoman Empire in the late 14th century. The Bulgarian Empire was weakened by internal divisions as local lords grew more powerful. The Ottoman Empire expanded into the Balkans during this time, defeating Bulgarian armies and capturing important cities and fortresses. The last Bulgarian tsardom, the Tsardom of Vidin, fell to the Ottomans in 1396, marking the end of Bulgarian independence for nearly 500 years.",
