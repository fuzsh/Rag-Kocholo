        "text": "Finally, it was time for our yearly summer holiday, and our destination this year was Bulgaria. Summer holidays for us usually mean a 10-day long road-trip with our friends, with multiple stops. This year we broke up our holidays into 3 distinct parts. First we would explore Veliko Tarnovo and its surroundings, followed by 3 days by the sea. Lastly, we would stay 3 nights in Sofia, mostly making day-trips from the capital city.\n\nWe packed up on Thursday evening and after a quick pit-stop in Timisoara, we met up with the group Friday morning. It’s a long 10 hour drive from here to Veliko Tarnovo, mostly across the not so scenic Oltenia region. We crossed into Bulgaria via the ferry between Turnu Măgurele and Nikopol. There’s no (usable) timetable on the internet, so we were happy to find out we arrived exactly 30 mins before one of 3 daily crossings. Turns out, ferry operators treat this timetable quite loosely, so we waited about an hour or so before entering Bulgaria.\n\nAlready quite hungry at this point, we looked for a place to eat. We found a truckers stop in Obnova, called Pod Lipite. The place does look exactly as expected, but as is the case with most frequented truckers stops, the food was really good value for money. We got ourselves a meat plate and a couple of Shopska salads, which was more than enough for the 6 of us.\n\nShopska salad is somewhat of a national dish in Bulgaria, though it was invented as a socialist tourist promotion campaign in the 60’s. It consists of diced tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, raw or roasted peppers, sirene cheese and parsley.\n\nAnett and Peter observe:\n\nWe noticed all the meat, salads and even the lepinje (bread) was sprinkled with some kind of spice mix. During our stay, we found out Bulgarians put it on everything, so we just started calling it Bulgarian mix. We asked around and found out it was called Sharena sol (colourful salt) and it’s a mix of dried summer savoury, fenugreek, thyme, paprika and salt. The owner lady saw how excited we got about it, so everybody got a small pack on the house. This is why I love the Balkans, you only get this kind of hospitality in this part of Europe.\n\nWhen we arrived in Veliko Tarnovo, the sun already set. We found our place and settled ourselves in, but finding a more permanent parking spot was more of a challenge. After a few circles around the old town we managed to find a spot, right next to a terrace which offered excellent views of Tsarevets fortress on the opposing hill. To our luck, there was a light show, during which the fortress was perfused in colourful lights. Every couple of minutes the whole fortress lit up, showing us just how huge it is.\n\nOur place was right on Samovodska Charshia, the old market street is and which was once home to merchants from all around Europe. Even today you can find craftsmen from all different trades: potters, woodcarvers, silversmiths and my personal favourite the kadaif baker. The kadaif is a thin noodle-like pastry. The batter is poured from a special jug onto a hot 1.5m diameter copper wheel, where it is baked in under 5 minutes.\n\nAfter a good night’s rest, we started out exploring Veliko Tarnovo. While the others grabbed some breakfast, I set out to climb the hill above Samovodska Charshia. Sadly, the further you go from the places frequented by tourists, the more derelict the buildings get, and people who live there are mostly elderly and poor. But climbing up the steep cobblestone alleys is well worth it, as it gives you a bird’s eye view of the whole city and the Yantra river meandering between the hills.\n\nFrom up there, you could clearly distinguish the modern town and the 3 hills on which the different parts of the old city sit. It’s also a great place to see the city as it evolved during its history. Veliko Tarnovo is one of the oldest settlements in Bulgaria, traces of human occupancy from the 3rd millennium BC being discovered on Trapezitsa Hill. Just beyond Trapezitsa hill, is the Tsarevets hill with the impressive fortress and long draw-bridge leading up to it.\n\nTarnovo served as the Second Bulgarian Empire’s capital for over 200 years, before being occupied by the Ottomans in 1393. Tsarevets was the main stronghold of the Empire, also housing the royal and patriarchal palaces. The fortress has been restored in the 20th century, the current cathedral perched on the hill in the middle of the fortress was also built in this period, on the site of an early christian temple.\n\nRegrouped with the others, we realised it was getting really hot for exploring Veliko Tarnovo, so we decided to drive to nearby Arbanasi village. Sitting on mountain high above Veliko Tarnovo just 4 kms away, Arbanasi is renowned for its history and Bulgarian National Revival architecture.\n\nAlso known as the Bulgarian Renaissance, the Revival period has nothing to do with Brunelleschi, Bramanti or Michelangelo but with the turkish occupation and oppression. The National Revival period began in the 18th century when Bulgarians started forming an increasingly stronger national identity, and culminated in the April Uprising and subsequent liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 as a result of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878.\n\nRevivalist architecture is characterised by two or three level building, where the upper floors are wider than the lower floors, and are supported by wooden beams. The ground level wasn’t used for living, but as a space for the kitchen, pantry, workshops or a barn. Houses of the rich often have very ornate facades and interiors, especially the carved wood ceilings. Some houses even had decorative chimneys.\n\nAnett and Peter observe:\n\nThe wider upper floor not only give these buildings a unique look, but it’s also quite ingenious how practical they are. They efficiently make use of available space, extending the usable surface of the house, and they offer shade for the streets below, which is very welcome in this mediterranean climate. At last, but not least, it also makes it easy to chinwag with your neighbours.\n\nIn Arbanasi, the most prominent example of this architectural style is Konstantsaliyata’s house, the 18th century dwelling of a well situated family, nowadays operating as a museum. The courtyard is also a nice place to get some rest and shade. While in Arbanasi, make sure you check out the Church of the Nativity of Christ, built between the 15th and 17th centuries, known for its precious frescoes.\n\nWe grabbed lunch at the Mehana Arbat, a traditional Bulgarian tavern on the main street in Arbanasi. There’s a huge variety of Bulgarian meat and fish dishes, salads and they served some good table-wine by the carafe as well.\n\nBack in Veliko Tarnovo we started wandering around town, exploring the Samovodska Charshia and its craft stores, the old town and finally ending our tour at the Tsarevets fortress in the afternoon. The most interesting building on Samovodska Charshia is the Hadji Nikoli Inn, built in 1858 by architect Kolyo Ficheto. It got its name from its owner, Hadji Nikoli, a famous merchant, known for his efforts in fighting for an independent Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\nNowadays it is home to an art gallery, a restaurant and our evening programme, which was wine tasting with our very knowledgeable sommelier and host. Four varieties were on the offering. First up was a 2017 Sauvignon Blanc, paired with cream cheese, cherry tomatoes and salad, followed by a 2016 Melnik rosè with salmon cream bruschetta.\n\nAfter these lighter wines, we were getting closer to the business end and up came the 2009 Mavrud, accompanied by dried plums, blue cheese and almonds. Both Melnik and Mavrud are indigenous Bulgarian red grape varieties. Melnik (Siroka Melniska) gets its name from the town of Melnik near where it grows, close to the Greek border, while Mavrud comes from the southeastern region of Thrace. Last on the menu was a 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon and now we were speaking my kind of wine! It was accompanied by thin slices of beef ham and sour cherry jam.\n\nWhen we thought it was all over, our sommelier still had something up his sleeve. Out came the dessert in the form of a wine liquor made of Mavrud grapes. Basically an ice wine, which means grapes are only harvested after the first frost making for much more concentrated levels of sugar. Not really my kind of drink, but the girls were happy (and one the guys for that matter). As we were the last guests, our host for the evening clinked glasses with us and with is we called curtains on our first full day in Bulgaria. Nazdrave!\n\nNext day, after another bellyful breakfast we headed for Etar, on the outskirts of the town of Gabrovo, about an hour away from Veliko Tarnovo. Etar is home to an open air ethnographic museum. We’re not normally museum visiting folks, especially not village ethnographic museums, but we heard this one is special. And boy we weren’t disappointed.\n\nSpanning over 7 hectares, the museum contains several residential and agricultural buildings, showcasing the architecture and way of life during the Bulgarian National Revival period. Do not miss the school building or the merchant Saka’s house.\n\nThe best part about Etar is, that it’s a “living village”, with locals dressed up in period costumes and presenting crafts using traditional instruments. You can find woodcarvers, icon painters, potters, coppersmiths, leathersmiths and even fur hat makers. Of course, you can buy their products as well. If you’re hungry, make sure you drop by the bakery or grab some nougat from the sweets shop.\n\nJust a few minutes from the museum, you can visit Sokolski manastir, a place of tranquility, at least when we arrived before closing time. Established in 1833, the monastery acted as a shelter for freedom fighters during the Turkish oppression. In the middle of the complex, there’s a water fountain crafted by famous architect Kolyo Ficheto. It’s eight spouts are a nod to eight rebels who were captured and hanged by the Turks. There isn’t much to see, but it’s a great place to relax. Pour yourself some water from the fountain, sit back and enjoy the views over the mountains.\n\nOn our way back to Veliko Tarnovo we made another stop at the Dryanovo monastery. It was closing time, we were hungry and tired so we cut it short. From what we’ve seen, it wasn’t as spectacular as some of the other monasteries we’ve seen on out Bulgaria trip anyways.\n\nAlthough nowadays Veliko Tarnovo is a modern city, you can really get a feel of what the golden age of Bulgaria was like. It’s also one of those places, similar to Gjirokastër, Ohrid or the Old Bazaar in Skopje which give you that raw experience you can only get in the Balkans: great local food, unique architecture and unlikely mix of past and present."
