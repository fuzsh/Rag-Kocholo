ðŸŽµ Music & Management Musings #42 ðŸŽµ

While I'm a technologist and technology leader, music is also a big part of my life and has been for quite some time. Because of that, I like to bring together the musical side of myself and the leadership side of myself into a weekly article.

This week's edition of Music & Management Musings is inspired by SPS Commerce 's recent announcement of our 93rd consecutive quarter of growth (yes, you read that right - 93 consecutive quarters of growth), which naturally made me think of the 2010 triple platinum DJ Khaled song All I Do Is Win. While I can't say I endorse every word in the song, it's hard to deny that it's a jam that makes me want to go 'Heck yeah, I'm a winner! Let's GOOOOO!'.

As usual, I think there are several lessons that could be drawn out of this song but I'll focus on two: winning with others and how to think about not winning. With that, let's get into it.

Management Musings

Winning (& Celebrating) Together

Everyone likes winning. It's more fun than losing. Especially when you're winning with your friends and/or co-workers. Even DJ Khaled brought others into his hit about being a winner (T-Pain, Rick Ross, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg - not to mention the plethora of big names that joined in the 2011 remix). I watched the music video today for the first time and it just looks like one big party. Winning leads to celebrating, and celebrating with others.

And so it is in work. Sure, accomplishing something simply by your own herculean efforts can feel good. And that's needed sometimes and is totally still a win. But, especially when you're a leader, winning is a team thing. This requires bringing team members into projects, unblocking them from doing their work well, supporting them, coaching them, and more. And then, celebrating them, and celebrating with them for the wins of the team. Hopefully your team is winning every day (I know mine is), and when that's the case it can be easy to forget to celebrate. But winning isn't quite winning without the celebration. Every now and then have a party, give high fives, have some fun to celebrate the hard work you and your team are doing every day.

What About Ls...i.e. NOT Winning?

The sentiment of DJ Khaled's song is pretty clear. He doesn't lose (nor do Luda, Snoop, T-Pain or Rick Ross). The chorus even seems to say 'At all costs, I will win.' That seems unhealthy and potentially could lead to unethical behaviors. And honestly, it's simply not possible to only ever win. It's a fun sentiment, but not realistic.

Especially if you're a leader, it's an unrealistic expectation to set for your team that they are only ever successful. That they never make mistakes or have setbacks or bad days. This is part of work and part of life. Maybe a project won't get delivered on time. Maybe you'll introduce a bug into the code and need to quickly roll back or roll forward to resolve the issue. Sure, these aren't ideal scenarios, but they do happen. Will you treat these situations as losses, or do you treat them as lessons, opportunities to learn, grow and become a stronger and more resilient team in the future? There's a place for healthy retrospectives, for discussing what went well and what didn't, for acknowledging situations where you didn't completely win.

One cool thing, as I reflect on SPS's 93 consecutive quarters of growth (arguably an 'All I Do is Win' company), I know that there have been setbacks, missteps, projects that didn't deliver quite on time. But I know that it's also a culture of learning and growth. We've learned and made adjustments along the way, continually pursuing to be better than the day before. We have Ls, sure, but we learn from them. And then we keep winning and having fun and celebrating together as we do so.

Back to the Music

As always, I like to end with a/the song, because it's fun and I hope that it allows readers to 1) take some time to listen to some music :), 2) maybe hear a familiar song in a new way, 3) hear things and hopefully share them back with me that I missed so that I can learn from you all as well. So, without further ado, All I Do Is Win.

I'll also link the music video in a comment for those that would prefer to get the full experience.
