        "text": "What do Spiderman, The Grateful Dead, and the Miami Heat have in common? They’re all right here as Minneapolis agency Colle McVoy’s Executive Creative Director Gil Muiños stopped by for a thoroughly entertaining round of Five Questions with SCREEN. Let’s get to it!\n\nSCREEN: What is your most prized possession?\n\nGIL: For as long as I can remember my father always wore a thin gold chain with a small Catholic pendant of the Patroness of Cuba, “Our Lady of Charity.” I took possession of it after he passed away and I’ve worn it every day since.\n\nSCREEN: If you could be a member of any musical group in history, what would it be?\n\nGIL: Grateful Dead or Phish – I’m not really a huge fan of either per se, but I just admire and respect the purity of their music. They love the music they make, have complete musical freedom with no regard for commercial or mainstream reception, and they have the hardest of diehard fans. Being a part of that would be a dope experience.\n\nAll right, Gil, here’s a recent live Phish performance for you and for our readers! Enjoy!\n\nSCREEN: Best advice you ever received?\n\nGIL: It’s not the best idea you can come up with, it’s about the best idea you can sell.\n\nSCREEN: Your favorite commercial ever?\n\nGIL: I’m gonna cop out and name the two that get me every time: a) Emerald Nuts “Swiss Family Robinson” b) Nike MVPuppets “Lil Dez”\n\nHere’s a throwback to that Lil Dez spot…\n\nSCREEN: What’s that TV show you’re a little embarrassed to admit you love to watch?\n\nGIL: Is House Hunters International embarrassing? Regardless, I love it. Just pure wanderlust TV.\n\nWe agree, Gil! Here’s a free full episode for your viewing pleasure…\n\nBONUS QUESTIONS!\n\nSCREEN: What is your favorite restaurant on the planet? What do we order when we go?\n\nGIL: There’s a small, classic Cuban restaurant in West Miami called Rio Cristal. I’ve been going there since I was a baby. Their tagline is “Our food is good. Our customers are the best.” I always get their classic Bistec de Palomilla – It’s a steak covered by a mound of fries with black beans, rice and plantains. 10/10\n\nSCREEN: If you could play any superhero in a major motion picture, who would it be?\n\nGIL: Spiderman.\n\nSCREEN: If you could only be a fan of one sports team, which would it be?\n\nGIL: Easy. Miami Heat.\n\nQuite a season for those Heat this year, Gil! Here is a sizzling season highlight reel…\n\nThanks for playing, Gil!
