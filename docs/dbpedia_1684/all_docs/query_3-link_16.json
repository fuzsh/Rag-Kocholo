While the Ice Bucket Challenge has brought a tremendous amount of awareness to ALS, this film is meant to do something beyond that. Our goal is to provide an insight not only to the effects of the disease, but to have people be inspired by Jeff’s courageous ability to maintain a positive daily outlook, amongst life’s biggest challenges.\n\nThis film has become a passion of mine and we are racing against the clock. Because Jeff’s condition is deteriorating and he is casted to play himself, we have a constantly decreasing window of time to get this film made."
