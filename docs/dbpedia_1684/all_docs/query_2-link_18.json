        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. (Aug. 4, 2024) â After a win against CF MontrÃ©al last week and a draw against AtlÃ©tico San Luis on Sunday night, Orlando City won the East 2 group to advance to the Round of 32 in Leagues Cup 2024. The Lions will now host Cruz Azul on Friday, Aug. 9 at Inter&Co Stadium, after the Liga MX squad won its penalty shootout against the Philadelphia Union to secure second place in East 4.\n\nThe Lions played the final 60 minutes of the match down a player after picking up a red card early in the first half. Despite the disadvantage, Orlando scored first when Facundo Torres and Ramiro Enrique connected on a goal for the second straight match. With a goal in six straight matches, Enrique set a new club record, breaking a tie with former Lion Daryl Dike for the most consecutive matches across all competitions with a goal.\n\n45+6â Ramiro Enrique (Facundo Torres) â ORL 1, ASL 0\n\nMoments before the end of the half, the Lions broke the scoreless draw on a Ramiro Enrique one timer. Martin Ojeda led an attack down the left wing before finding Facundo Torres near the far post. Torres headed the pass back to the middle of the box with Enrique running into the box before taking a one timer and beating goalkeeper AndrÃ©s SÃ¡nchez to the bottom right corner of the goal.\n\n71â Rodrigo Dourado (BenjamÃ­n Galdames) â ORL 1, ASL 1\n\nAtlÃ©tico San Luis scored its equalizer midway through the second half on a header from Rodrigo Dourado. The visitors built up an attack before Benjamin Galdames took a pass outside the box and sent a cross into the box to Dourado who headed in a shot past goalkeeper Pedro Gallese.\n\nâIt was an excellent effort from our players. We want to recognize that heart and willingness to do the right things is what exemplifies Orlando City, especially in the period we have shown here with the fans that have been here for years. We have had players that keep everything up and tonight was not an exception. It was not a meaningless game in the second half. It was important for us to win it in front of our fans. For us, it was important to keep the momentum and despite the disadvantages in the metrics and numbers. We wanted to win it. So, weâre happy with the victory and now weâre preparing for the next one.â"
