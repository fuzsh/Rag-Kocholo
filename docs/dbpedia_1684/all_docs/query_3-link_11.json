        "text": "This is the DVD movie that comes from the Choices II soundtrack. While Three 6 Mafia are considered gods in Memphis for their music, they fall short in the full length film. Staring all the members of Hypnotize Minds (the record label owned by Three 6 Mafia) really lets you see your local legends in a whole new spotlight. Lil Wyte makes his film debut here as well. The reason I only give this move 7 stars is because of the major flaws in the production of this movie. 1) The plot is extremely hard to follow due to the constant muttering of the \"actors\". 2) The sets are very poorly done. 3) Special lighting is non existent.\n\nThere are positive aspects of this movie... Well at least one, you guessed it: the soundtrack, as it is the choices II album.\n\nIts worth wasting a couple stoned hours on, but don't expect anything or you'll turn it off after the first scene."
