        "text": "He’s an award-winning, top director, the brains behind some of our favorite hip-hop music videos.\n\nBut the SoFlo creative is also known for international hits, like Tesher and Jason Derulo’s new smash, “Jalebi baby.”\n\nDeco baby Alex Miranda has the story.\n\nGil Green is the guy Jason, Nicki, Drake, you name it, call when they want a hot video.\n\nBut with “Jalebi Baby,” which is about “food,” Gil knew he had to serve up something tasty, mouthwatering even.\n\nHungry, anyone?\n\nMusic video: “Baby, let me see it. Jalebi baby. Girl, I wanna eat it. Jalebi baby.”\n\nWell, you just might be after watching the new Tesher and…\n\nMusic video: “Jason Derulo!”\n\n…music video for “Jalebi Baby,” directed by Miami-native Gil Green.\n\nGil Green: “Big ups to all the cats in the Grove, South Miami, North Miami, P-Rine.”\n\nAnd Wynwood, where we met him at Toejam Backlot to talk about his tasty treatment.\n\nGil Green: “We have a little bit of Jason’s, like, Hollywood-style dancing, and then we definitely get a little bit of that Indian flavor that Tesher brings.”\n\nHe’s one of the hottest music video directors in the world.\n\nGil Green: “For me, it’s like fresh energy. It doesn’t matter if you’re popular or not, as long as you’re true to yourself, and you’re pushing the box of creativity.”\n\nProbably behind some of your favorite visuals in hip-hop, from DJ Khaled, Rick Ross, Drake…\n\nMusic video: “I’m only getting older, somebody should’ve told ya.”\n\nTo my jam…\n\nMusic video: “Shimmy shimmy yay, shimmy yay, shimmy ya. (Drank) Swalla-la-la.”\n\nGil goes way back with Jason.\n\nGil Green: “Believe it or not, I got his first demo tape when he was singing in the church.”\n\nAnd Nicki Minaj!\n\nMusic video: Bad gyal nuh follow nuttin’. Word to the Dalai Lama.”\n\nGil Green: “Hold on. Tell her.”\n\nAlex Miranda: “Oh, my gosh! Nicki?? Gurl! I love you so much! You are the queen!”\n\nA cruel joke. No one on the line.\n\nGil Green: “Swalla,” we just went with a candy theme, right? “Jalebi Baby” is more of like the Indian donut theme.\n\nAlex Miranda: “OK, so you’re saying there’s a separate meaning in these songs…”\n\nGil Green: “I didn’t say that! You said that!”\n\nMusic video: “I’m a dog. Kill the kitty, no apologies.”\n\nBut for those who’ve never had a jalebi…\n\nTesher: “It’s found in South Asia, India, Pakistan, that kind of region. It’s a circular, orange sweet. It’s very, very sugary.”\n\nAlthough, what Gil craves…\n\nGil Green: “Some oxtail, some rice and peas, and some plantains.”\n\nAre we still talking about food?\n\nMusic video: “Light it up from Hollywood to Moujalli. Tesher and Derulo, it’s a worldwide party.”\n\n“Jalebi Baby” actually just started as a remix to Justin Bieber’s “Yummy” that Tesher posted on YouTube.\n\nNow, the full song with Jason is charting all over the world.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.
