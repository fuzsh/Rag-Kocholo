        "text": "After two hard-fought group-stage matches, Minnesota United has been officially eliminated from the 2024 Leagues Cup. Necaxaâs 3-1 victory over Seattle meant that all three teams in Group F finished group play with three points, and the Loons missed out on the knockout stage by just a single goal. Group winners Necaxa will face the San Jose Earthquakes in the Round of 32, while Seattle will face the LA Galaxy.\n\nThis yearâs tournament produced a 2-0 loss to the Sounders and a nervy 1-0 win against Necaxa for the Black and Blue. A red card in each match and some lackluster attacking play kept Minnesota United from replicating their 2023 Leagues Cup run, leaving their fate in the hands of their group mates on the final day. Two more goals, in either game, would have been enough to send the Loons through, but theyâll have to wait at least another year to have any hope of lifting the Leagues Cup trophy.\n\nWhile the chips didnât fall in their favor, several Loons can leave the tournament with their heads held high after some impressive individual performances, chiefly from goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair. The Canadian international produced 24 saves in two games, including a 16-save, club record-setting performance against Necaxa in the second game of the tournament.\n\nWith their exit, the Loons have become the first team to win a group-stage match in regulation and subsequently fail to advance to the knockouts. Now, theyâll have to wait until August 24 for their return to league action, which coincidentally comes against fellow Group F members, Seattle.\n\nDuring the weeks between now and the next match, the Loons will spend time recovering, training, and welcoming new signings to the squad. Designated Player Kelvin Yeboah and defenders Jefferson Diaz and MatÃºÅ¡ KmeÅ¥ will all be making their way to the Twin Cities in the coming weeks, with hopes of being integrated and ready to go before the club starts their push for a spot in the playoffs."
