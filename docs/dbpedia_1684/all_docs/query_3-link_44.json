        "text": "When DJ Khaled starts putting in work, he doesn't let up. He drops the Gil Green-directed video for \"Hold You Down\" — which features Chris Brown, XXL Freshman August Alsina, Future and Jeremih — just hours after the song dropped.\n\nAs you'd guess by the featured artists, this one is for the ladies. The video follows accordingly as the singers woo ladies inside a mansion. It also includes this ridiculous bit of dialogue between DJ Khaled and a model.\n\n\"Say my name, baby.\"\n\n\"DJ Khaled\"\n\n\"Say my naammmee, baby!\"\n\n\"DJ Khaled\"\n\n\"You smart. You loyal. You're grateful. I appreciate that. Go buy your mom a house. Go buy your whole family houses. Put this money in your savings account. Go spend money for no reason.\"\n\nNot a single dry eye in the room.\n\nCheck out the video and We The Best headphones product placement above. Watch out for I Changed A Lot."
