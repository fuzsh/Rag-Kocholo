        "text": "Rex Wilder\n\nHARD LABOR\n\nA chrysanthemum petal makes me think of a swapped\n\nprisoner. What was given up for this beauty pressing\n\nagainst the marble countertop like a face? My country\n\nregularly brings an innocent home in return for cold\n\nblood, an art teacher for an assassin. A bottle of sky-\n\nblue Windex stands by the photo frame by the bananas\n\nlike a guard. Prisoners clean their own cells, I’m told.\n\nTo wit, I feel your soft hand on mine as I shine the glass\n\nat all hours, removing the smudge of our separated lives.\n\n—from Poets Respond\n\n__________\n\nRex Wilder: “Inspired by the prisoner swap with Russia.”\n\nSophia Hall (age 14)\n\nLOOSE BRICK\n\nOn the last Saturday of August,\n\nan ambulance sirened past Valley Forge.\n\nYour red Toyota was our caboose.\n\nThe cyclists who found me, squashed,\n\nwaved and went on.\n\nAbove me, a clean-shaven man in white smiled.\n\nHe told me I was brave.\n\nYour electric toothbrush\n\nvanished from Mom’s medicine cabinet.\n\nMy kitsch cast was claustrophobic with sharpie.\n\nThe maple trees out my window turned red.\n\nHow did the Continental soldiers survive\n\nsix months of wind whipped backs?\n\nWere chalk blue fingers\n\nsuffering as usual?\n\nMaybe if there was no Days Inn\n\nno road trip no grasshopper girl\n\nno garden wall no loose brick\n\nno tumble no pavement\n\nno falling no crumple\n\nno left arm, cracked in two\n\nmaybe you would have stayed.\n\n—from 2024 Rattle Young Poets Anthology\n\n__________\n\nWhy do you like to write poetry?\n\nSophia Hall: “Writing poetry not only allows me to express gratitude for the seemingly ordinary moments that compose my life but also lets me heal from childhood and current events. In my poetry, I believe that the personal is powerful and political. I hope that when people read my poetry, they find companionship and feel a little less alone.”\n\nAlison Luterman\n\nVIBRATO GHAZAL\n\nLike a trembling tower of fruity gelato,\n\nladies and gentleman—my vibrato.\n\nEven though my voice teacher says not to\n\nwarble like a church lady, my vibrato\n\nblurs the pure tone, a little rubato\n\n(how we hate to be confined)—because my vibrato\n\nhas a mind of her own, even sotto\n\nvoce you can hear the tremulous vibrato.\n\nLike a wren chirruping to her inamorato—\n\nhard to quell that pesky vibrato.\n\nOr an operatic artiste, alone in her grotto,\n\npracticing arias, throbs forth the vibrato.\n\nLee, glancing at this notebook, asks if I sought to\n\nwrite an ode to my vibrator? No, babe! My vibrato!\n\nSing smooth as honey, that’s my motto,\n\nbut there she goes again! Vibrato, vibrato.\n\n—from Rattle #84, Summer 2024\n\nTribute to the Ghazal\n\n__________\n\nAlison Luterman: “I started playing around with the ghazal form recently and became enamored of its flexibility and capaciousness as a form. It can be sensual, humorous, erotic, spiritual, political, or all of the above. This one just arose spontaneously out of whatever I was thinking about at the time.” (web)\n\nRuth Bavetta\n\nELEGY FOR MY 1958 VOLKSWAGEN\n\nBeautiful blue beetle,\n\ncurved and dumpy, lovely\n\nas a lumpy German mädchen\n\noverly fond of kartoffeln.\n\nFour cylinders chugging\n\nin the rear, it was like being chased\n\nby a busy washing machine.\n\nAir-cooled engine slow\n\nto warm my feet.\n\nI loved how I could tuck it\n\ninto tiny San Francisco parking spots.\n\nNo gas gauge, just guess\n\nthe gas to get you there.\n\nNo synchromesh first gear,\n\nno coasting through stop signs.\n\nSmall outside, it still thought big.\n\nRecord load—seven bags of groceries,\n\nfive kids, one friendly neighbor,\n\ntwo dogs and a pair of bowling shoes.\n\nI sold it. Never realizing\n\nthat it prophesied my life—\n\nthe inability to pass abruptly,\n\nthe slow fade on the long uphill grade.\n\n—from Rattle #38, Winter 2012\n\n__________\n\nRuth Bavetta: “I was a visual artist for years, until I found I also wanted images that could be painted with words. I wanted to use words, as I used images, to help me make sense of my life. Now, at the age of 76, I’ve become convinced that neither words nor images will suffice, because there is no sense-making. There is only what is and what has been. It’s enough to know I am human, separate and mortal, and that’s where I find my poems.” (web)\n\nBob Hicok\n\nTRUE STORY\n\nI can’t escape the possibility\n\nI was meant to own a Zamboni\n\nbut got stuck with three can openers instead.\n\nOr that I should have kissed your knees\n\nlast night when you got home\n\nfrom being with your friend\n\nwho just had her cat killed. I know\n\nI’m supposed to write “put to sleep,”\n\nbut can she wake her up now? No.\n\nAnd it was kind of you to rush over\n\nright after work and you deserved praise\n\nin some form and your knees\n\ndon’t get enough attention, I guess\n\nI’m saying. Where would we have gone\n\non the Zamboni? Dunno, but how\n\nis certain: slowly. Here’s a headline\n\nyou never have to worry about:\n\nThree Canadians Killed\n\nin Zamboni Drag Racing Accident.\n\nI’d buy a newspaper to tell the world\n\nhow much I love you. Tons. Geegobs.\n\nAnd how many cats have we cried over\n\nso far? Four, and one dog, and soon\n\nwe’ll start adding parents\n\nto that list, then one of us\n\nwill look at empty chairs around the house\n\nand hate them. So knees, elbows, hair,\n\nand of course the more famous bits:\n\nI kiss thee in life and in poems,\n\nwhich are not life, more like a flashlight\n\nturned on in a black hole. Geegobs\n\nis a lot. Geegobs squared is more\n\naccurate. But is amount really\n\nthe correct measure of love?\n\nI love you greenly, gymnastically, variously\n\nand Stradavariusly, I love you\n\nwith my heart shadow and my brain fog\n\nand my suitcase-packing skills. The suitcase\n\nI’m packing for when you go\n\nto the next room and I have to follow.\n\nPoor kitty. Poor friend. Poor us.\n\nWho have to deal with mortality\n\nusing a limited toolkit. There’s crying,\n\ndrinking, toking, injecting, breaking\n\ndishes and popsicle sticks, and loving\n\nlonger and softer those who remain.\n\nHow long ago did there cease to be a time\n\nI can remember being without you?\n\n1897, I think, the year the jumping jack\n\nwas invented, the year levitating\n\nwas added to the Olympics, the year\n\nI first dreamed I was alive\n\nand saw you coming around the corner\n\nand thought, So this\n\nis the famous happiness\n\nI’ve heard so much about.\n\n—from Rattle #84, Summer 2024\n\n__________\n\nBob Hicok: “I like starting poems. After I start a poem, I like getting to the middle, and after the middle, an end seems a good thing to reach. When the end is reached, I like doing everything that isn’t writing poems, until the next day, when my desk is exactly where I left it, though I am a slightly different person than the last time we met.”\n\nAl Ortolani\n\nSWITCH PLATE\n\nThe day moves by me, and I’m still\n\nat the same old desk that was two-wheeled\n\ninto my room by the custodian. The lights\n\nrun on some kind of motion detector.\n\nIf no one moves, let’s say, in ten minutes,\n\nthey blink out, and I have to raise my arms\n\nand wave them like crazy. Possibly,\n\nthey click back on. Possibly, they don’t.\n\nAt this point, I have to get up and walk\n\nthe room in the dark until the shadow of me\n\nis recognized in the recesses of the switch\n\nplate. Once in a while I’ll have a class\n\nof high school kids writing essays,\n\nand the lights will suddenly black out,\n\nand they will all look up astonished\n\nlike they’ve really done something cool.\n\n—from Hansel and Gretel Get the Word on the Street\n\n2019 Rattle Chapbook Prize Winner\n\n__________\n\nAl Ortolani: “These poems represent connections to others, sometimes dark, sometimes light, often quirky. A fellow teacher, and mentor to the poet, once said that one of the most difficult measures of the career public school teacher is their ability to stay positive and elevated by interest, if not always in the subject matter, then in the hand raised outside of the T zone.” (web)"
