        "text": "Luke Grimes' wife Bianca Rodrigues Grimes revealed that she is pregnant with the couple's first child, and her friends and followers are praising her simple and stunning reveal.\n\nGrimes Yellowstone co-stars Kelly Reilly (Beth Dutton) and Hassie Harrison (Laramie) applauded the pic. Tim McGraw's daughter Audrey simply said, \"Omg!!!\"\n\nGrimes plays Kayce Dutton on Yellowstone, which is set to resume in November.\n\nShe is a Brazilian model, but the couple now reside in Montana.\n\nThey've been married for over five years.\n\nRelated: Everything You Need to Know About Luke Grimes' Wife Bianca\n\n\"Prettiest mama that ever mama'd,\" Harrison shares.\n\n\"The most beautiful,\" adds Reilly.\n\nIn the pic, Bianca Grimes is backlit by a window, but followers can see a growing baby bump. She appears several months in, but the couple have not shared a due date.\n\nThe couple live a pretty quiet life. She doesn't share much to social media, while he only started an Instagram page when he released his debut country songs in 2023.\n\nA year ago, he shared a pretty amusing anecdote from their relationship:\n\n\"She moved to the States without knowing a word of English,\" Grimes told People. \"And when I met her, she had only lived here for two years, but she spoke beautiful, fluent English. I was like, 'How did you learn it so fast?' And she said, 'I watched The Office with subtitles.'\"\n\nGrimes is 40 years old. His wife is in her late 20s."
