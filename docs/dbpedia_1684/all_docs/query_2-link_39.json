Sheldon rips the earphones out of Howard's ears after he begins rapping.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nThe Lyrics of the song Howard sings along to are\n\n\"All I do is win, win, win no matter what\"\n\n\"Everybody's hands go up, up, and they stay there\"\n\n\"Ungh, ungh, Ludacris going in on the verse, 'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now\"\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHoward sings the song out of time, as the start of the song begins\n\n\"All I do is win win win no matter what, Got money on my mind\n\nI can never get enough\n\nAnd every time I step up in the buildin'\n\nEverybody hands go up\""
