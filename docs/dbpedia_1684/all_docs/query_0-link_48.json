My game has just elevated with DWe.\"\n\nStephen Perkins\n\nJANE'S ADDICTION / PORNO FOR PYROS\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Perkins’ picked up drumsticks at the age of eight. His first public drum performance was at his Bar Mitzvah1980 in front of family and friends. His passion for playing the drums led him to purchase his first drum set bought at Valley Arts Music Center, Studio City, CA with his Bar Mitzvah gift money.\n\nIn 1983, his first band \"Champion\" played the Troubadour in Los Angeles; his second band \"Disaster\" rocked the Whiskey and the Roxy in Los Angeles in 1984. By late summer 1985, Perkins joined an older singer and bass player and together they formed Jane’s Addiction. Jane’s Addiction released their first record \"Live At The Roxy\" on Triple X Records, which led to signing a seven-record deal with Warner Bros. releasing \"Nothing Shocking\" (1988), which was nominated for a Grammy.\n\nIn 1990 \"Ritual De La Habitual\" was nominated for two Grammy’s and Jane’s Addiction went on to headline the first Lollapalooza tour that summer. Perkins joined the band \"Infectious Groves\" in 1991 and recorded in toured for two years. By 1993, Perkins created Porno For Pyro’s and released its first self-titled album on Warner Bros. Records, which was nominated for a Grammy. He went on to release several more records with Porno For Pyro’s, released an instrumental jazz-fusion record with Banyan on Higher Octave Record Label.\n\nPerkins reunited with Jane’s Addiction with Flea on bass in 1997, while also releasing a second Banyan record.

Watching Perkins on drums is a show within itself. His energy, charisma, unique skill and style make him one of the most sought after drummers today.\n\nHe received his star on Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1997, and Hands at the Rock Walk Hall of fame at Guitar Center Los Angeles.\n\nThe 1st time I sat behind the DWE drum set, I closed my eyes and rocked out with full force. Hitting the drums , vibrating the shells, cracking on the rims and moving a lot of air. It’s real!\n\nOn DWe:\n\n\"The simple power and ease of having 10,12,14,16” toms, 20 or 22 kick drums & real snare drum targets feels so familiar but somehow brand new because yours hearing pure clean dynamic samples.Then, what do you know? The drum set is convertible to actual acoustic drums. You add in the fact that there’s no cables or cords connected, and you've got yourself a great sounding, high-powered jaw dropping electronic drum set...it has sound and vision.\"\n\nPatty Anne Miller\n\nQUINN XCII / CEELO GREEN / LESLIE ODOM JR. / ZARA LARSSON\n\nIf poetry in motion were defined by a single artist it would surely be Patty Anne Miller. A triple threat in the creative space, Patty is an incandescent star. Not only does she march to the beat of her own drum, she designs those beats. As a drummer, actress and all around entertainer, Patty is an unforgettable force. She vibrates at a frequency that is unmatched and illuminates any arena she steps into. Upon meeting Patty, most immediately sense that she was born to entertain.\n\nInspired by Sheila E., Patty began her electrified love affair with drums in church at the age of ten. Influenced by Aaron Spears, she infused gospel chops into a hard-hitting rock style. Patty discovered fusion at a young age, quickly becoming the perfect blend of Dave Weckl, Tony Royster Jr. and Travis Barker. As a full-tuition scholarship recipient, she graduated from Berklee College of Music in 2010.\n\nDetermined to pursue her dreams, Patty quit her full time retail job to go on tour with a rock artist. Although the tour proved to be fruitless, she viewed it as a teachable moment, and resolved to grow from the experience. Having no quit in her, she threw herself full force into her music career and started networking and playing local gigs. Patty’s hard work and persistence paid off in dividends when she was chosen to tour with Ceelo Green. From playing with Beyonce during halftime at the Super Bowl, to being featured in national television commercials for McDonalds and Chobani yogurt, to touring the world with Quinn XCII, performing alongside artists such as Leslie Odom, Zara Larsson, Daya, Melody Thornton and more, Patty’s star has only begun to rise.\n\nShe recently made her feature film debut in a major studio sequel, “Bill and Ted Face the Music,” which premiered August 28th 2020.
