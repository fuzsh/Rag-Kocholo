DON'T LXXK UP | 돈룩업\n\nThis photo booth called DON'T LXXK UP is huge on social media because of the unique photos you can get here. It takes your photos from an upward angle!\n\nIt has been gaining popularity because you can easily get that retro Gen Z vibe in your photos. When it first opened up, there was only one location in Yeonnam, but there are now over 40 locations across the nation, with more opening up! Here's a list of all the locations in Korea!\n\nIt's a bit challenging to think of various poses from such a high angle, so try to think of some or look at examples before going in! They even provide trendy sunglasses to upgrade your photos and free stickers.\n\nThe photo booth area has two rooms, one where you can leave your belongings and select the photo options. Then you'll go into the actual photo room for photo time! There are three colors to choose from, red, blue, or dark grey. We personally recommend the red!\n\nThere's even a special pink room they added for spring, and it's only available at the Gangnam location from April 3rd, 2024 to May 6th, 2024. Check it out if you have a chance!\n\nOfficial Instagram Account: @dontlookup.official\n\nGangnam Location\n\nHours: 24/7\n\nAddress: 22 Gangnamdaero 102-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul\n\n서울 강남구 강남대로102길 22\n\nOriginal Yeonnam Location\n\nHours: 24/7\n\nAddress: 33 Donggyo-ro 46-gil, Mapo-gu, Seoul\n\n서울특별시 마포구 동교로46길 33\n\n5.

BYTP Station\n\nLots of photo booths with unique concepts are continuing to pop up! This photo booth, called BYTP, is designed like a subway station and has a variety of unique photo backgrounds. We recommend going to the flagship store in Gangnam!\n\nThe most popular photo concept at BYTP on social media is the subway train room! To get to the subway train photo booth, you'll have to head down the stairs into the basement area. They really took the subway concept seriously!\n\nThere are two rooms here, one with a metal shaft with graffiti on it, and the subway train. The graffiti room is also quite popular on social media! The subway-themed room is behind the yellow plastic dividers.\n\nThis is what it looks like inside! Doesn't it look like a real subway train cart? It was so cool to see and take photos here!\n\nThey even have this cool Down-Shot room, which almost looks like you're stuck in an elevator shaft. We've never seen a photo booth room like this!

Movement | 무브먼트\n\nAnother photo booth to get unique photos at, similar to DON'T LXXK UP, is Movement in Sangsu! This photo booth is also fairly new, so there is only one location as of now.\n\nSource: Instagram @movement.seoul\n\nAt Movement, you can get both high and low angle photos! These angles are not easy to pull off, so make sure you think up of some poses before you go in! If you check out their official Instagram account, you can see their other photo options as well.\n\nThere is actually an employee at the front that you'll need to speak with in order to get a photo room. There may also be a bit of wait here, but you can sit on a bench or look around at the other photos people left on the walls for ideas!\n\nWe tried out the low angle photo booth! The room has a clear glass platform with a camera underneath pointing upwards. The monitor screen isn't in view if you're looking at the camera, so it was a bit difficult to see how our photos were turning out as we were taking them.\n\nAfter taking ten photos, we chose four of our favorites and they were printed out immediately in the same room.\n\nThe low angle photos were hard to take photos with, but we still had a lot of fun and were satisfied with the photos! We recommend taking low angle photos as a solo or two-shot and doing the high angle for groups with three or more people.\n\nOfficial Instagram Account: @movement.seoul\n\nHours: 24/7\n\nAddress: 1F, 19-11 Wausan-ro 17-gil, Mapo-gu, Seoul\n\n서울 마포구 와우산로17길 19-11 1층\n\n8.

Every photo booth is slightly different, but generally, the process is the same! Here is a simple guide on how to use a Korean photo booth and some tips from us so you can go straight in like a pro!\n\n1. Choose a photo booth\n\nThere are so many different photo booth brands in Korea, so we've narrowed it down to some of the most popular ones for you! They all have a slightly different vibe, so you can compare using the photos below.\n\nLife Four Cuts | 인생네컷\n\nPhotoism Box | 포토이즘 박스\n\nHaru Film | 하루필름\n\nDON'T LXXK UP | 돈룩업\n\nMovement | 무브먼트\n\nSihyunhada Frame | 시현하다 프레임\n\nOld Moon | 그믐달셀프스튜디오\n\nBYTP Station\n\nWXCK PHOTO | 웩포토\n\nWXCK PHOTO | 웩포토\n\n2. Touch up your hair/makeup\n\nPhoto booths will almost always have mirrors for you to check your appearance before going in for photos! People like to get in some mirror selfies as well.\n\nSome locations will even have hair straighteners, dryers, and brushes. It's completely normal to fix your hair or makeup in a photo booth, so don't feel shy and go ahead and do what you gotta go!\n\n3. Pick up some props\n\nLots of photo booths will have fun props like headbands, dolls, signs, or sunglasses to use for free when taking photos!\n\nJust be sure to put everything back when you're done. Also, some of the props might be a bit dirty from overuse or from being dropped on the ground, so you'll probably want to check before using one!\n\n4. Look at the photos on the walls for inspiration\n\nPhoto booths are filled with photos left behind by other people, so be sure to look around at the photos for cute ideas! If you want, you can leave your photo on the wall afterward.\n\n5. Check the different rooms\n\nEach room is going to have a different color background. Some photo booths have rooms that have different colored curtains inside that you can choose from, but most have a set color.\n\nBe sure to check some of the rooms beforehand so you can choose a background color that you like!\n\n6. Select a template\n\nThere are going to be several different photo templates you can choose from with varying prices. Keep this in mind when you go in!\n\nEvery photo booth has different options, so when you go in the self photo booth room, you'll be able to choose on the kiosk.\n\n7. Select how many prints you want + the QR code option\n\nYou'll have to make the payment before taking photos, so it will ask you how many photo prints you want and if you want to include the QR code to download the digital files (sometimes the QR code option comes after payment). Most photos come with at least 2 prints, and from there you can add 2 more to get 4, 6, 8, etc. Keep in mind that the price goes up with the amount of prints!\n\n8. Make the payment\n\nMost photo booth kiosks take both card and cash! Keep in mind that if you pay in cash, it will most likely only take 1,000 KRW bills.\n\n9. Take photos!\n\nOnce you pay, your photo booth session will immediately start, so make sure you're ready! Usually you'll take about 8-10 timed photos (usually about 10 seconds per photo) and then choose from there.\n\nLots of photo booths also have a little remote you can use if you prefer to use it instead of waiting for the timer. Many people also like to use it as a prop in the photos!\n\n10. Select your favorite shots, choose a filter and frame, and print!\n\nAfter taking your photos, you can choose your favorites and put them in the order you like. Some photo booths will give you one chance to you re-take your photos as well if you don't like how they turned out!\n\n11. Scan the QR code to download the digital photo and video file\n\nRemember the QR code we mentioned earlier? You want to make sure to check the QR code option so you can download the digital files of the photo. It comes with a video as well! The QR code will become invalid after 24 hours, so make sure to download it before then.\n\n12. Don't forget the protective plastic sleeve!\n\nAll photo booths should have a little plastic sleeve you can put your printed photos in to protect the photos from getting scratched. Korea really thought of everything! If you want some more ideas for photo booth poses, check out our blog in the link below.\n\nKorean Photo Studios\n\nBook Here"
