        "text": "DONALD Trump's former director of communications has issued a warning to his ex-boss that his running mate could be dead weight in the race for the White House.\n\nFinancier Anthony Scaramucci worries Trump might be in trouble after Kamala Harris made the best choice possible by picking Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for her vice president.\n\nScaramucci told The U.S. Sun that while Walz shines as a \"Joe Biden-like figure,\" Trump missed the mark by picking Ohio Senator JD Vance as his VP pick.\n\n\"JD Vance has absolutely hurt Trump,\" said Scaramucci, who worked in the White House for 10 days before being fired in July 2017 and has now become a critic of the former president.\n\nTrump has been forced to frequently defend his decision to run with Vance after he announced him as his running mate on the first day of the Republican National Convention.\n\nScaramucci advised Trump should dump Vance in a statement on X, writing that Trump \"has to replace Vance to get back in the race.\"\n\n\"This is Trump's election to lose. He would have demolished Joe Biden.\"\n\n50/50 CHANCE\n\nThe former comms director said that there's a 50/50 chance that Trump could actually leave Vance in the dust, saying that the former president has \"done this to everybody.\"\n\n\"He'll say, 'Vance wasn't working for me. He didn't have the chops' and then he'll bring in Nikki Haley.\n\n\"If Trump removes Vance, he needs to wait after the DNC because he needs to get the pop and the publicity.\n\n\"He knows they're going to bigfoot him in August.\"\n\nAccording to Scaramucci, Trump will get major attention for himself and the possible replacement if he drops Vance.\n\n\"But he may just drag Vance along with him,\" Scaramucci added.\n\n\"He says 'the vice president doesn't matter' - and then he's saying Tim Walz is gonna take the country into communism.'\"\n\n'UNIVERSAL LAW'\n\nScaramucci said that Vance pales in comparison to his opponent as Walz has a certain all-American charm.\n\n\"He's a teacher and he's a former high school football coach. There's a universal law in America,\" Scaramucci told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"Pay very close attention to this: Everybody loves their high school football coach, everybody.\"\n\nWalz, who was virtually unknown a few weeks ago, has been received positively by the Democratic Party, catapulting him into the national spotlight.\n\n\"The base loves Walz – the left-leaning progressive base that’s showed up in the primaries,\" said Scaramucci, adding that Harris won't have to put up a fight at the upcoming Democratic National Convention.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race on July 21, immediately throwing his endorsement for Harris.\n\nVEEP OF FAITH\n\nHarris and Walz made their debut as running mates on Tuesday night at a rally in Philadelphia, where the incumbent vice president introduced her pick to the nation.\n\n\"Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future,\" she said.\n\n\"I found such a leader: Governor Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota.\"\n\nHarris drew attention to several of Walz's accolades throughout his life, such as serving in the Army National Guard and his career as a high school teacher and football coach.\n\n\"And in 91 days ... the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: Vice President of the United States.\"\n\nWALZ'S SHOTS AT TRUMP\n\nWalz addressed the crowd with a fiery speech, praising Harris for fighting \"on the side of the American people.\"\n\nBut he quickly criticized Trump, saying he \"doesn't know the first thing about service. He doesn't have time for it because he's too busy serving himself.\n\n\"Trump weakens our economy to strengthen his own hand.\n\n\"Make no mistake - violent crime was up under Donald Trump.\n\n\"That's not even counting the crimes he committed,\" referring to Trump's felony conviction.\n\nThis comes as...\n\nTrump’s former adviser told The U.S. Sun Kamala Harris was 'cold-blooded' in her VP pick\n\nTrump's campaign warns Walz is a ‘West Coast wannabe who’ll unleash hell’\n\nDem divide intensified as VP race turned bitter\n\nWalz could prove to be a security headache if he becomes VP\n\nFormer president Trump and Harris spar over time and venue for future debate\n\nHarris secures enough delegates to win 2024 presidential nomination\n\nA new poll shows some voters are afraid Harris is not qualified for the job\n\nHowever, it was Walz's shots at Vance that gained attention when he stated that he \"can't wait to debate the guy.\"\n\n\"That is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up,\" said Walz, earning a roaring applause from the audience.\n\n\"So you know what's out there so say it with me: we are not going back.\n\n\"We'll sleep when we're dead,\" he said of the countdown to Election Day.\n\nCALIFORNIA SCHEMING\n\nTrump slammed Harris' choice of running mate in a series of posts on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n\"This is the most Radical Left duo in American history. There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Crazy Kamabla [sic] is, indeed, CRAZY. I HEAR THERE IS A BIG MOVEMENT TO 'BRING BACK CROOKED JOE.'\"\n\nTrump's campaign called Walz \"dangerously liberal\" in an email to supporters, adding that he would \"unleash hell on Earth.\"\n\nMeanwhile, his son, Don Jr. wrote \"Yikes!!!\" on X in response to the pick.\n\n\"It's no surprise that San Francisco Liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running mate - Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State,\" read a statement by Trump's team.\n\n\"From proposing his own carbon-free agenda, to suggesting stricter emission standards for gas-powered cars, and embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote, Walz is obsessed with spreading California's dangerously liberal agenda far and wide,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"If Walz won't tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist, and the Harris-Walz California dream is every American's nightmare.\"\n\nWhile boarding his plane, Vance described Walz to Fox News as a \"San Francisco liberal\" and called his record a \"joke.\"\n\nVance added that he would debate Walz but said that he had to secure the official nomination first.\n\nHowever, Walz called the position the \"honor of a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Vice President Harris is showing us the politics of what’s possible. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school. So, let’s get this done, folks! Join us.\""
