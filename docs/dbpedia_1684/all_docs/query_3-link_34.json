        "text": "COLLEGE STATION, Texas (KBTX) - Defensive ends from Arlington Martin High School have a history of making a mark on the Texas A&M football program. Eight years ago, Myles Garrett became the Aggie’s only first-overall NFL Draft pick in the 2017 edition of the event.\n\nMonday, Nana Boadi-Owusu followed in Garrett’s footsteps in a very different fashion. The redshirt sophomore walk-on received the Number 12 jersey as the newest 12th Man in the Aggie football program.\n\n“[He] elevated the level of performance on and off the field of everybody around him, coaches and teammates alike,” former Martin head coach Bob Wager told KBTX. “You, as a coach, had to have your ducks in a row, because he craved knowledge, always did the right thing and then had that really unique leadership skill.”\n\nThe process of selecting the 12th Man was revamped under new head coach Mike Elko. Instead of coaches making a unilateral decision, A&M’s coaching staff narrowed the field of possible honorees to four: Boadi-Owusu, kicker Randy Bond, running back Anthony DiNota and safety Jacob Graham. Then, the rest of A&M’s roster voted on who would be the representative of A&M’s student body on the field.\n\nThe No. 12 has become a manifestation of E. King Gil, an A&M basketball player who came out of the press box during the 1921 Dixie Classic to serve as an extra body for an injury-plagued Aggie football team. He wasn’t needed in the game against Centre College but has since come to represent the Aggie student body’s willingness to stand ready for the team.\n\nOver a century later, this A&M team’s choice was Boadi-Owusu, who was presented with his new jersey in a team meeting prior to Monday’s practice.\n\n“Such a cool deal,” new A&M offensive coordinator Collin Klein said. “Knowing it from afar and seeing from a distance and understanding that tradition – but actually getting to see it and feel it yourself in the gravity of that moment for the team, yesterday, was truly off the chart. Couldn’t be more proud of him.”\n\nNow former 12th Man Sam Mathews said he viewed Boadi-Owusu as his primary competition to claim the No. 12 jersey last season, when the defensive end was just a redshirt freshman. Tuesday, Mathews told KBTX Boadi-Owusu is a “class act.”\n\n“As far as just competing every single day, he didn’t really give me much room to breathe, as far as going out there and handling my business,” Mathews said. “I knew that he was going to show up every day and be the same person and handle his business. There was always that competition between us two, but he’s definitely been the front runner for me, since I left.”\n\nOne of Boadi-Owusu’s best friends from high school is Ernest Cooper, now an outside linebacker for Stanford, Wager said. Boadi-Owusu constantly pushed the one-time four-star linebacker and, in turn, made himself better for it.\n\n“Ernest was really, really highly recruited and Nana just wasn’t going to have it,” explained Wager, now on staff at TCU. “Anything Ernest did, Nana was going to be right there with him and try and sneak in another rep. Ernest wasn’t going to let that happen, so he didn’t another rep. Then, together, they just pulled, like a magnet, everybody toward the goal to become the best version of themselves on the field and off.”\n\nAccording to his A&M coaches, Boadi-Owusu continued to demonstrate the same work ethic that was displayed at the high school level in Arlington, a key reason he was a finalist selection.\n\n“I think he’s a tremendous teammate,” Coach Elko gushed. “I think you see that in the things that he’s been willing to do for the program since he’s been here. He’s been on scout team. He’s played multiple positions. He’s a huge factor on special teams… He fits the culture and selfless service that this university kind of wants in that jersey number.”\n\nAs a redshirt freshman, Boadi-Owusu registered 11 special team snaps, led by nine on kick coverage, according to Pro Football Focus. He received a 73.1 special team grade, per the analytics site, which ranked 10th on the Aggies. Traditionally the 12th Man has been the captain of the special teams for the program.\n\nDuring his senior year in high school, Boadi-Owusu recorded 56 tackles, including nine tackles for loss and three sacks. He caused quarterbacks to hurry 14 times in his final season with the Warriors, while also playing special teams.\n\n“Nana and his role on special teams – unselfish, absolute high level of willingness to endure pain, meaning… he’s going to play all 15 seconds [of a kickoff] hard. Real hard,” promised Wager. “And that’s self-made. That didn’t happen by mistake.”\n\nNew A&M defensive coordinator Jay Bateman is still learning the full meaning of the 12th Man in A&M tradition. But, from what he knew about the honor before joining the program, the team’s new selection completely fits the description.\n\n“He’s truly a servant leader. He’s a selfless kid,” Bateman boasted. “Whatever we ask him to do, he does, and, I think he’s a good player, too. I think that’s, in my mind, what that role is. He’s worked really hard to become the best football player he can, and I think our kids really respect him.”\n\nMonday’s practice, underneath the lights of the Coolidge Practice Fields, was the first time Boadi-Owusu donned the storied two digits, which produced a smile that beamed brighter than any electric bulb hanging above, Elko said. At the same time, he continued the legacy of a strong pipeline from Arlington Martin to the defensive front in Aggieland.\n\n“What an honor. Are you kidding me,” added Wager. “That embodies everything that you want in a coachable athlete and certainly he was. So, yeah, I’m a proud pop up here.”"
