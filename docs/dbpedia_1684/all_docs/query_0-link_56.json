One of these is to agree on its subject, purview and structure, carve up the job of writing it, and then stitch it together when the words are in the bag, so to speak. This book was not written in that fashion. From first to last, what follows is the product of a different model of collaboration, the result of a process of genuine co-authorship. Put simply, what you read here is the upshot of many hours of two people sitting in front of a computer hatching thoughts and trying to find the words to record them. Indeed, it’s not just the nature of the argument we put forward here, or the style in which it is expressed, that is the product of this working method, but the very substance of each sentence. We hope that the book benefits from this approach. While that is, of course, for others to decide, what is true is that this book would never have reached fruition without the support of a whole range of people to whom we would like to express our gratitude. Firstly, we have received unwavering support from both the School of Arts and Media at Teesside University and its Institute of Design, Culture and the Arts. Just as important has been the support, advice and friendship offered by our colleagues in the English Studies Department – thanks to you all. In a similar vein, this book would never have seen the light of day without the guidance and patience of all those at Edinburgh University Press who have been involved in coaxing this project into fruition. Thanks to Vicki Donald, Esme Watson, Sarah Edwards and Rebecca Mackenzie. On a related note, thanks also to Kevin Donnelly, the editor of Edinburgh University Press’s Music and the Moving Image series, of\n\nvi\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd vi\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nwhich this book is part. Not only did he help us secure the commission in the first place, but more recently his comments on earlier drafts of the book have been invaluable in helping us address its shortcomings. One of the potential drawbacks of the working practice we employed here is that it is sometimes very time-intensive. This is, of course, most acutely felt at home. As such, our most significant debt of gratitude is to our respective partners, Ian and Alex, who have not only had to endure untold moods, whines, moans and whinges over the years, but who have had to do so while listening to some pretty eclectic (some might say weird) background music.\n\nvii\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd vii\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\n‘Don’t mind doing it for the kids’\n\nfor\n\nBen Callam Ellie Jude Marcel Oliver Roy\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd viii\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nINTRODUCTION: THE KLEENEXES OF POPULAR CULTURE?\n\nMusic video is a significant and interesting form of contemporary popular culture, one which is widely circulated, complex and important. This claim is, however, a potentially controversial one. For it is easy, as many critics have done, to either dismiss music video as a worthless by-product of capitalist business practice or, worse, to ignore it all together. Graham Fuller spells out this situation in ‘A Good Music Video is Hard to Find’ in claiming that ‘the search for the art and artistry of the music video goes on but the consensus is that El Dorado or Santa Claus will turn up first’. He goes on to say that, since the inception of MTV in 1981, ‘what critical evaluation of music video there is relegates it to the trash can of popular culture’.1 This kind of reaction to such a fascinating subject is, however, both predictable and perplexing. It is predictable in that the instrumental logic of music videos serves to direct attention towards a range of secondary commercial products and away from their own formal and aesthetic qualities, yet also perplexing in so far as the recent resurgence of academic interest in popular culture might have been expected to embrace the vibrancy of such a ubiquitous cultural product. These responses, to either dismiss or ignore, are, of course, the recto and verso of long-standing discourses concerning value and distinction, two sides of the same coin which continue to define music video as a kind of ‘throwaway art . . . the Kleenexes of popular culture’.2 It is the contention of this book that they warrant much more sustained and detailed consideration. Music video’s raison d’être as a promotional device has had a number of significant consequences for the way it has been studied and conceptualised.\n\n1\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 1\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nAll music videos have an avowedly commercial agenda: they are first and foremost a commercial for an associated but distinct consumer product, the music track itself. Indeed, many directors of music videos also make advertisements for other products – Hype Williams, who has directed videos for artists such as Beyoncé, Ashanti, Janet Jackson and Pharrell, has also made commercials for Nike; Little X has made commercials for MacDonald’s and directed videos for Akon, Sean Paul, Rihanna, and Korn; Jake Nava has directed commercials for HSBC and Del Monte as well as videos for Robbie Williams, Britney Spears and the Rolling Stones. As Peter Wollen has argued, music videos represent the ‘breakdown of the distinction between programme and ad’.3 The fact that music video is always already a secondary product, an advertisement for another cultural form, tends to short-circuit discussion of music video itself by re-routing critical energies towards putatively more valuable objects. This critical elision is mirrored in the practices of cultural journalism, to the extent that music video falls outside of its institutional norms which privilege the music and the performer as the key sites of creativity and meaning. So, while reviews of albums, singles and live performances now regularly occupy a significant number of column inches in both dedicated music magazines and the review sections of the press more generally, reviews of the latest video releases are notable only by their absence. And in many ways this is understandable if we think of music videos only as advertisements. You wouldn’t expect a review of the latest perfume or mobile phone to make reference to the television commercial which was used to advertise it. However, when we consider that music videos have a life of their own – with television channels and websites dedicated to screening them – which other commercials do not, this critical neglect becomes difficult to understand. For music videos are not simply advertisements; they are, rather, as Thomas Doherty suggests, both ‘promo and product’ and, as such, have ‘revised the nature of contemporary music’.4 And yet, to a significant extent, this deficit, this lack of interest, is replicated in the institutional practices of academic writing and research. That is to say, despite Roy Shuker’s claim that ‘the analysis of MV clips has been one of the major growth areas in both television studies and the study of popular music’, academic work on music video is not common.5 Indeed, with the exception of the recent publication of Carol Vernallis’s Experiencing Music Video and Roger Beebe and Jason Middleton’s Medium Cool, there has, over the years, been little sustained work on the subject.6 For the most part, discussion of music video is subsumed under other topics and foci. So there may be, for instance, one or two essays about music videos in a collection about popular music: both Angela McRobbie’s Zoot Suits and Second Hand Dresses and Andrew Blake’s Living Through Pop, for example, each include one chapter on the subject. There may also be passing reference made to music videos in\n\n2\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 2\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndiscussions of genres or artists: Imani Perry’s article on women and hip hop, for example, mentions them, as does Robyn Brothers in her article about U2.7 However, there is, and has been, little dedicated work on music videos themselves. Indeed, despite the fact that critical interest in music video emerged soon after the launch of MTV, from today’s vantage point this period appears to be, if not a false dawn, then certainly a half-forgotten moment of enthusiasm and vitality. For the 1980s, and, indeed, the early 1990s, saw a spate of articles in journals dedicated to film studies, television studies, media studies and cultural studies, discussing both the new phenomenon of music television and the videos that constituted its content. The range and scope of these articles was broad, stretching from Deborah H. Holdstein’s discussion of music video as a part of the music industry’s star machinery, to Joan D. Lynch’s discussion of the influence of surrealist art on music video aesthetics, via articles critiquing the ideologically gendered messages of MTV or numerous pieces celebrating its postmodernism.8 This nascent critical interest promised not only to elucidate the formal and political properties of music video, but also to provide a space in which many of the tenets of film, media and cultural studies could be rethought. Although scattered in its distribution and piecemeal in its interests, there seemed to be a new field of study arising, a new interest for academics concerned with the study of the popular. However, rather than growing and developing its own institutional presence, it quickly became subsumed into precisely those paradigms it promised to recast and, ultimately, petered out almost entirely. The desire to understand and explain music video qua music video rapidly gave way to a range of other priorities. Perhaps the most noticeable of these was the desire to read music video, or more precisely music television, as variously a symptom of, a product of, or synonymous with postmodern culture. Kaun-Hsing Chen, for example, conceives MTV as ‘a schizophrenic simulacrum . . . a simulacrum of multiplized originals’, that absorbs a whole range of other cultural forms and ‘abandons the ideology of the reality principle’.9 Here, if postmodernism is the theory, and Jean Baudrillard is invoked as its High Priest, then MTV is the practice. Peter Wollen suggests that music videos are ‘a hybrid and technologically sophisticated form’, ‘replete with quotation and allusion’ which push us to rethink our ideas and question our critical concepts – they demand ‘new concepts and new attitudes’.10 They are exemplars of what Andrew Darley terms ‘displayed intertextuality’, hybrid forms that happily play with and manipulate images from the past and the present and in doing so ‘frustrate attempts at categorisation along traditional lines’.11 For critics such as these, then, music videos are important because they are radically different to what has gone before and, thus, make us re-evaluate contemporary art, aesthetics, and ideas of creativity, representation and originality. The analysis of music video, therefore, is put to work for broader theoretical ends as the site where both the economics and\n\n3\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 3\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nthe aesthetics of postmodernism condense into palpable evidence of the logics of postmodernity. While postmodernism’s preoccupation with notions of semiotic excess, assemblage, self-reflexivity and fragmentation provided the lingua franca for discussing music television, music video was being co-opted elsewhere. Not only were music videos being incorporated into the study of popular music generally, but, more specifically, they were being used as a way of interrogating the relationship between music and cultural politics, and in particular the cultural politics of race and gender. As with most other areas in the study of the popular there are two key strands in this body of work, those which seek to warn against the negative aspects of music video and those which ferret out positive aspects to celebrate. The former consists of work which discusses both MTV and individual videos in relation to the potential damage that can be done by the production and perpetuation of stereotypical images. Whether based on statistical content analysis, as with Steven A. Seidman’s or Rita Sommers-Flanagan et al.’s analyses of gender roles, the close textual analysis of Sheri Kathleen Cole, or the ethnography and autoethnography of Jennifer Hurley or Elizabeth Ellsworth et al., this type of work focuses on the limited, distorted, often sexualised ways in which women, especially black women, are represented in music videos.12 The latter strand, by contrast, sets its sights on unearthing positive, transgressive, and potentially progressive representations. So from this position, gangsta rappers in music video are ‘organic intellectuals’, Queen Latifah produces afrocentric feminist videos, Cyndi Lauper ‘appropriates the image of the street’ for girls.13 It is here that the study of Madonna is significant. This has to do, in the first instance, with the sheer quantity of work dedicated to discussion of Madonna and her videos.14 But it is also to do with the privileged place that Madonna has within discourses of both postmodernism and feminism, discourses which have figured her variously as a feminist role model, a postmodern artist, the embodiment of a queer politic, or, more rarely, as the epitome of the exploitative logics of the culture industry. For Kaplan, for example, she ‘embodies the new postmodern feminist heroine’, and it is in this respect that videos such as like a prayer (1989), ‘an enlightened work that emphasizes positive aspects of the black community’, justify my love (1990), with its ‘shocking violation of conventional sexual representations’, express yourself (1989), in which ‘Madonna is constantly inverting relations of gender power and domination’, or vogue (1990), with its ‘queer camp effect’ are lauded for their critique of normative values and challenge to conventional prejudices.15 What is important, however, is that the study of music video, once again, is either an afterthought to another project or organised around the analysis of a certain few performers, Madonna being principal amongst these. The result of these tendencies is that the study of music video has been half\n\n4\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 4\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nburied beneath the clamour to write about other, albeit related, products, and half submerged in the intellectual trends and preoccupations of a range of academic disciplines. It is in this respect that 1993 seems to represent both the life and death of music video as a form of popular culture capable of sustaining serious scrutiny on its own terms. For this year saw the publication of two books that can be seen as both the culmination of the burgeoning critical interest in music video and as a beacon of hope for the future development of music video as a specific field of study. Despite its titular concern with music television, Andrew Goodwin’s Dancing in the Distraction Factory: Music Television and Popular Culture not only provided a history of MTV and a discussion of its specificity as a televisual format, but also paid real attention to the structure, form and narrative style of the videos themselves.16 Goodwin’s wide-ranging discussion, which covered economic and commercial issues, close textual analysis, cross-textual analyses and examination of the pleasures afforded by watching music videos, seemed not merely a culmination of what had gone before but a potential blueprint for subsequent inquiry. Similarly, Simon Frith et al.’s Sound and Vision: The Music Video Reader, provided an interdisciplinary collection of ten essays that covered both music television and analyses of specific videos and in so doing claimed the study of music video for popular music studies by hooking the analysis of video up with key concerns of that field, providing genre-specific work on heavy metal and country music, and grounding theoretical debate in the history of rock. Both books, with their mixture of socio-cultural and textual analysis, their concern with issues of gender and cultural politics, and their focus on music video as a distinct cultural form in and of itself, could have marked the beginning of an institutionalisation of music video studies. Unfortunately they did not. For what is clear is that there has been very little work since the mid-1990s which either discusses music video in terms of its formal qualities and cultural importance or takes up the texts of specific music videos as sites of meaning symptomatic of broader socio-political concerns in the same way that the textual operations of films, television programmes and other popular media have been taken up. In their own ways, then, both cultural journalism, in absenting it from its purview, and the academy, in making its analysis dependent on something else, replay and confirm the idea that music video is, in itself, a weightless, trivial phenomenon, that either exists beneath intellectual scrutiny or is incapable of sustaining it. This narrative of critical atrophy is all the more surprising, and all the more ironic, when recounted alongside a parallel narrative, a narrative which tells of music video’s unbridled success as a popular cultural form. It is perhaps obvious, but nevertheless important, to say that music video has never been so culturally visible and accessible as it is in this historical moment. In terms of form, content, style and the experience it offered its viewers, MTV was new and exciting in the 1980s. It did not remain unique for long however, and\n\n5\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 5\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nthere has been a considerable growth in the number of dedicated music television channels over the past three decades. These new channels – for example CMT (Country Music Television), BET (Black Entertainment Television), VH1 (Video Hits 1), TMF (The Music Factory), the growth of nationally specific MTV channels, not to mention the explosion of niche-based and jukebox channels – have broadened both the generic scope and target audience of music television. But while the proliferation of music television channels since the mid-1980s is important here, it is not all important. For it is on and through the computer screen that the distribution and redistribution of music video takes on added levels of complexity. The internet has provided the music industry with new ways of broadcasting music videos to its consumers with sites licensed to screen music videos on demand. Perhaps more interestingly, however, the same technological infrastructure that allows record companies to promote their products more widely has enabled consumers to circumvent these official channels of broadcast and, instead, redistribute the music videos which they deem significant. The main point here, of course, is that even if the former scenario seems unproblematically to confirm the notion of music video as a secondary product designed to maximise revenue from the music as primary product, then the same does not apply in the latter case. In selecting from the general catalogue of music videos which specific works are to be fed back into the system – that is to say, simultaneously re-circulated and archived – the relationship between video and song is reversed. For this enterprise implies that it is the video itself which has become the primary product, something which is valuable on its own terms. The significance of this is not simply to do with the fact that, like popular music, music videos now have a life outside of their official institutional existence. It also has to do with their cultural longevity. Put simply, music videos now no longer, if they ever did, come and go with the release schedule of the song they promote. Indeed, the new and the old, the classic and the contemporary, increasingly circulate, and are re-circulated, alongside one another in the present moment of the screen. The proliferation of music video charts (‘the best rock videos ever’, ‘100 sexiest videos’, ‘the greatest videos of all time’) produced by web-based magazines, music forums, blogs and other websites, feature classic 1980s videos alongside contemporary ones as well as everything in between. As the practice of list-making develops and grows it serves to produce an informal canon of videos that appear on list after list: a canon which cuts across both time and genre. This situation undercuts the commonplace, yet misplaced, assumption that music video is an intrinsically ephemeral, disposable form, one whose lifecycle is determined solely by the economics of capitalist business practice. Moreover, this informal canon is being accompanied by the development of a more formal, institutionalised process of canonisation as a number of major galleries now collect music videos. For example, the Museum of Modern Art in\n\n6\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 6\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNew York and the British Film Institute in London archive and exhibit music video as part of their remit. This is not only significant in terms of the canonisation of the form and the emerging sense of artistic respectability which is part and parcel of this process of institutionalisation; it is also significant precisely to the extent that the storage and preservation of music videos belies the idea that they are transitory and worthless. However, it is not simply this process of archiving and canonising, be it formal or informal, that makes music video such a pervasive cultural form. For videos are now distributed and accessed in a range of formats, and through a range of media, in ways which similarly serve to uncouple them from their status as secondary products and thus vastly expand their cultural reach in space and time. Indeed, music videos are now clearly primary products in their own right. They are available for purchase in a number of ways: as part of a ‘special edition’ CD single package; on DVD (in collections of the work of a performer or an individual director); or as downloads for use on portable media (phones, mp3 players, iPads, etc.) on which they can be stored, transported and privately consumed. This process of becoming products in their own right is not simply reducible, however, to the emergence and development of personal mobile media but is, rather, a part of the more general penetration of screens and screen technology into virtually all aspects of contemporary life. In other words, screens are no longer the prerogative of the cinema auditorium and the home but are now increasingly essential features of the street, the architecture of building facades, and the interior design of public leisure spaces. Indeed, in the planning and organisation of the social environment the design and management of screen light is often seen to be every bit as vital as the design and management of natural light. Whether in the shopping mall or the gym, bar or bowling alley, the airport lounge or the bus shelter, it is music video that is often to be found populating these screens, if not forcing us to watch then at least making it increasingly difficult to ignore. So, music videos, often uncoupled from their soundtrack, are now a significant feature of our leisure time. And this uncoupling gives them yet another life as stand-alone visual imagery, not merely as commercials for the (unheard) song. In a number of ways, then, the story of music video’s cultural life stands in sharp contrast to the story of the decline of academic interest in it. To acknowledge the irony of this situation, however, is to also acknowledge the need to scrutinise music video in this cultural moment, that is to say, to subject it to the same kinds of rigorous analysis which have proved so illuminating in the study of other forms of audio-visual popular culture. For music videos are not only important because of their ubiquity or the increasing perception of them as valuable products in their own right. They are also important because the visual aspect of music video impacts upon not only the pleasure we can get from any given song but also on the meanings we can attach to it and by extension how\n\n7\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 7\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nwe can analyse and understand it. One brief example will suffice here. The lyrics for Shanice’s ‘Take Care of U’ (2006) and Destiny’s Child’s ‘Cater 2 U’ (2005) evince a remarkable similarity. Both are an expression of a woman’s devotion to ‘her man’ and detail not only her admiration for him but also her desire to demonstrate her love precisely by caring for him and catering to his needs. For instance, both songs open by acknowledging the man’s hard work and their respective appreciation and admiration. In the case of the former, Shanice then goes on to instruct the subject to ‘lay back a while, take off your shoes / relax yourself, I’m going to take care of you’.17 This involves, amongst other activities, cooking his dinner, washing his clothes, and running his bath. Similarly, the Destiny’s Child song asks its subject to ‘Sit back’ and ‘Let me help you / take off your shoes / . . . let me feed you / let me run your bathwater / . . . [because] anything you want, I want to cater to you’.18 Moreover, these two songs do not just display a high degree of lyrical equivalence but are also generically similar in so far as they both operate within the recognisable musical conventions of R&B. However, despite these lyrical and generic similarities, and despite the fact that both Shanice and Destiny’s Child are clearly attributed authorship of the songs’ sentiments, a quite different version of femininity is produced by each video. The video for ‘Take Care of U’ begins with scenes of an informal meal with four couples sitting around a table drinking wine, eating and chatting. Shanice’s partner asks ‘have y’all heard my wifey’s new song?’, switches on the media player and the song begins. The video then cuts between three separate scenarios: the dining table, where the couples laugh, chat, and exchange glances with each other; the candlelit pool, where Shanice stands unaccompanied in the water and lip-synchs to camera; and the interior of the house where Shanice and her partner are shown together in a number of different settings – the kitchen, the bathroom and the bedroom. Both the dinner party scenario and the scenes within the house serve to situate the video in the natural, the real, the everyday and thus give legitimacy to the story they tell. In this respect the latter scenes are perhaps the most interesting because they depict Shanice and her partner performing the actions of the song’s lyrics. So there are closeups of Shanice’s bejewelled hands untying her partner’s trainers, holding a slice of pizza to his mouth while he bites into it, massaging his head as he sits in the bath, and, ultimately, kissing him passionately as he sits on the bed. And these images are intercut with images of the dinner party where the couple gaze longingly at each other across the table as their guests look on approvingly. The apparent naturalness of the behaviour depicted as well as the sense of verisimilitude of the situation is further enhanced by the fact that the role of Shanice’s partner in the video is played by her real-world husband, Flex Alexander. Taking care of your man, then, is depicted not only as the willing performance of acts of servitude but, simultaneously, as a form of sexual foreplay.\n\n8\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 8\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMoreover, it is also depicted as something Shanice, herself, does and chooses to do. The video for ‘Cater 2 U’, by contrast, is set in a fantasy world where the desert setting does not preclude the presence of a swimming pool or the wearing of figure-hugging fishtail evening dresses. The video begins, and indeed ends, with the three members of the group huddled together naked in the desert, their modesty preserved by carefully positioned hair and limbs. The rest of the video consists of a series of tableaux of the members of Destiny’s Child performing individually and together. So we see Beyoncé Knowles dancing alone and unobserved on the diving board of the swimming pool; Kelly Rowland lipsynching as she gets out of, and then poses sensuously with, a silver car; and Michelle Williams reclining languorously on a sun-lounger while proclaiming her desire to ‘cater 2 u’. These scenes are intercut with scenes of the three women dancing together for both the camera and, apparently, an audience of three men. The men, however, are seen only fleetingly, gazing wistfully at the women, and never in the same shot as Destiny’s Child’s highly choreographed dance routine. Indeed, it is only towards the end of the video that the men are allowed to encroach upon the women’s space and briefly share the frame with them before the video closes with the three women once again naked together in the desert. The presence of these men seems utterly superfluous to the video’s spectacle of female bodies and female pleasures. If on the one hand then, take care of u literalises the acts of servitude detailed in the lyrics and in doing so positions Shanice as the author of her own subjection, on the other hand the imagery and performance of Destiny’s Child in cater 2 u largely proceeds without reference to the lyrics. Indeed, the abstracted emptiness of its desert spaces, the posed tableaux of the women’s bodies, and the noticeable lack of attention directed to its male subjects by both the camera and the group, does not simply jar with the lyrical narrative of female subordination but in fact reinforces the image of Destiny’s Child as independent women who are in control of their own lives. That is to say, the video (re)establishes an image of women who are in control of their own bodies, their own desires, their relationships with men and their friendships with women, and it thus stands in sharp contrast to Shanice’s portrayal of someone dependent on the approval of her friends and husband. Two videos, then, which accompany very similar songs, songs whose lyrics may make our feminist hackles rise, but videos which present us with very different stories of how to be a woman. And it is the many different stories contained within music videos and the specific ways that they are told that is the topic of this book. The book takes as its focus the notion of representation and the political implications bound up with the complex practices of representing within music video. As Richard Dyer has argued, cultural representations ‘have real consequences for real people, not just in the way they are treated . . .\n\n9\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 9\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nbut in terms of the way representations delimit and enable what people can be in any given society’.19 And it is in this sense that the theoretical approach we pursue here is concerned with the ways in which the practices and conventions of representation in music video both constrain and make possible ways of thinking about ourselves as individuals within contemporary society. We consider music video, on one level, as a distinct media form with its own patterns of production, codes and conventions of representation, and complex modes of circulation, and, on another level, as a key site through which cultural identities are produced, inscribed and negotiated. Our approach is, broadly speaking, a feminist one inasmuch as its principal concern is with the production and reproduction of normative gendered identities. It is in this way that we take music video to be a site in which and through which identities are represented in specific and restricted ways – ways which, politically speaking, delimit the real options available to real people for being and acting in the world. In other words, we want to address, even if we cannot always answer, the complex questions raised by videos such as take care of u and cater 2 u – questions to do with the relationship between popular culture, raced and sexed identity, pleasure and politics. The book is organised into two parts. In the first of these we explore some key critical concepts in relation to music video. The first chapter serves to situate the research in the rest of the book both theoretically and politically. In it we consider the often heated debates about the concept of postfeminism and how we may usefully define a postfeminist approach to the study of music video, a popular form which is, at least chronologically, a post second-wave feminism phenomenon. We argue for a feminist approach that is informed by poststructuralism, recognises the successes of second-wave feminism without dismissing the continuing need for a feminist politics, and is aware that young women today live in a very different world to that of a generation ago. In Chapters 2 and 3 we discuss two important aspects of the study of music video – genre and authorship. Both concepts are of critical concern to the study of visual images, whether they come in filmic or televisual forms, as well as to the study of popular music. We argue, however, that it is not possible to simply transpose these ideas from the study of music, film, or television onto the study of music video in any straightforward manner. Indeed, authorship and genre have very different and complex relationships to music video. Even if they clearly have an impact on the content of specific music videos, music genres do not simply map onto music video genres. Music videos do, however, have their own generic formations that serve a number of key legitimating functions. So, while it is certainly possible to talk of, say, the ‘hip hop video’ or the ‘rock video’, we suggest that it is not enough to leave it at that. In Chapter 2 we discuss four genres of music video – the pseudo-documentary, the ‘art’ music video, the narrative music video and the staged performance video – identifying their key\n\n10\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 10\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ngeneric codes and the differing legitimating functions they perform. In Chapter 3 we move on to discuss some of the complex ways in which authorship can be considered in relation to the study of music video, a situation in which performer, director and songwriter may all have genuine claim to an authorial voice. However, we stress that this topic cannot be adequately grasped without taking into consideration the notion of authenticity, a concept that is central to both academic and popular criticism of popular music. We argue that there is no simple answer to the question of who authors a music video and that the authentic authorial voice does not necessarily lie with the person we can see mouthing the words of the song. Moreover, precisely who can be seen as the authentic voice of any given video has an impact on how we understand and interpret that video and the politics of images it contains. The second part of the book is devoted to the examination of music video as a site where normative constructions of race, gender and ethnicity are put on display, confirmed, reinforced and, sometimes, challenged. As such, we explore the ways in which music video presents us with a range of ways of being in the world. In Chapter 4 we focus on the ways in which long-standing tropes of blackness and whiteness are utilised to produce different femininities for black and white women. Using the videos of Beyoncé Knowles and Kylie Minogue as exemplars of this process, we argue that the presentation of the female body is raced, and raced in ways that can be traced back at least to the Victorian era and the colonial discourses that were in circulation at the time. Moreover, this situation seems to lead to different levels of choice for the presentation of the self, with white women having more scope than black women to ‘play with’ different identities and images, more ways to present themselves to the world. We develop this idea further in Chapter 5 with a discussion of ethnicity. Here we consider the way that ethnic identity can be produced on and across the female body. Focusing primarily on the videos of Christina Aguilera and the controversies sparked by her claim of Latina identity, we explore the differences between the videos produced to promote both the Anglophonic and Hispanic versions of two of her early singles: ‘Genie in a Bottle’ / ‘Genio Atrapado’ (1999) and ‘Come on Over’ / ‘Ven Conmigo’ (2000). By looking closely at the construction of these videos we can see the ways in which ethnicity is transcribed across the female body, how the body is decorated, displayed and framed to produce both the ‘all-American girl’ and its exotic other. In Chapter 6 we argue that not only is gender raced in its representation, but that the representation of race is also gendered. More specifically we explore the very different status and function of the body in the construction of masculinity and suggest that, very often, it is precisely the absence of the sexualised male body that not only comes to define masculine subjectivity in music video but is also an important process through which hegemonic masculinity maintains its power. Indeed, music videos employ a\n\n11\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 11\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nnumber of strategies to variously displace, disguise and disavow the sex of the male body, or even delete it from the field of vision entirely. It is these strategies which we discuss here. Throughout the book, then, we take music video seriously not only as a distinct form of popular culture with its own complex set of structures and conventions but also as an important site for the representation of cultural identities. Notwithstanding their undoubted commercial agenda, indeed, to some extent because of it, music videos are an important and significant part of the contemporary cultural terrain. A Note on Examples and Referencing Examples Given both the significant number of music videos that are now in existence and the enormous amount of titles that continue to be produced on an annual basis, the examples discussed here cannot pretend to be exhaustive. Indeed, while we often reference a number of titles which evince a particular property of the discussion, the approach we adopt is to examine a few videos reasonably thoroughly instead of a lot of videos in a more cursory manner. The specific examples pursued here have been chosen on the basis that they illuminate an area of interest or concern that extends beyond the particular case and informs thinking about music video more generally. It is our view that the theoretical and political arguments we seek to make in this book are better articulated and substantiated through precise analysis than through generalised claims. Indeed, when generalisations are made they are more likely to stand up to scrutiny if they are founded in precision and the particular rather than being merely general. Referencing As Andrew Goodwin pointed out some time ago in Dancing in the Distraction Factory, there are no generally recognised academic conventions for citing titles of music video.20 This remains the case. The key problem, of course, is that music videos share their title with another product (the song they promote) for which there are suitable and recognised conventions. This presents both an academic and stylistic problem: how to refer to and distinguish between these different, but related, works. As such, where we refer to a song we follow standard procedures and enclose the title within quotation marks. Where we refer to titles of films, albums and video collections we italicise their name. However, in instances where we make specific reference to a music video we follow Goodwin’s lead and present the title in small capitals. For example: the\n\n12\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 12\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nvideo american idiot promoted Green Day’s song ‘American Idiot’ which featured on their 2004 album American Idiot.

SITUATING MUSIC VIDEO: BETWEEN FEMINISM AND POPULAR CULTURE\n\nThe video for Pink’s ‘Stupid Girls’ (2006) is organised around a series of pasquinades of fellow female pop stars and other famous women. Some of these are direct parodies of music videos while others satirise images from popular culture more generally. So, for instance, in one of these vignettes Pink lampoons Jessica Simpson’s fetishised performance of car washing in these boots were made for walking (2005) as, dressed only in a skimpy denim miniskirt, bikini top and cowboy boots, she gets (in)appropriately soaked with suds and (over)plays to the camera’s voyeuristic gaze. Similarly, a different scenario shows Pink mimicking Fergie from the Black-Eyed Peas in both appearance and performance as she dances for the pleasure of a stand-in 50 Cent. Other vignettes, such as references to the notorious Paris Hilton sex tape, parody well-known images of feminine celebrity, while yet others, such as sequences which deal with body-obsessed culture (getting ‘San Tropezed’, vomiting out excess calories, or toning up at the gym), take as their target a more general notion of contemporary idealised young womanhood. Either way, however, the video deploys parody to critique normative definitions of sexualised female identity, that is to say, a culture which equates idealised femininity with ‘stupidity’. This critique is reinforced by a set of equal and opposite images of women which, in their putative challenge to normative femininity, are offered up as positive role models. This is realised through Pink’s performance of what are traditionally male roles: she enacts the role of US president and plays running back on an American football team. Indeed, the video is structured around the\n\n17\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 17\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nManichean conceit of a fight for the heart and mind of a young girl whereby an angel on her left shoulder shows her the virtues of physical strength and intellectual acumen and a devil on her right shoulder encourages her into a life of commercialised femininity. The video, of course, ultimately resolves this dilemma between being strong and being stupid when in the closing moments the girl switches off the TV and rejects her Barbie doll and Girls World in favour of her keyboards and football. In this way, the video’s parodic strategies are mobilised not merely to attack the apparent vapidity of a celebrity culture which defines women in terms of the cut of their bodies and notions of sexual attractiveness but also as a counterpoint to the positive images of female agency it promotes. As such, the video can be seen to have much in common with the bulk of feminist academic work on music video, and, indeed, popular culture more generally, in that it is concerned, on the one hand, to identify and critique images in which women are variously misrepresented, falsely represented, negatively represented, or simply not represented at all, and, on the other, to celebrate positive images of women, that is to say, images deemed valuable in promoting a broader range of possibilities, opportunities and capabilities for women. In terms of music video, negative images and misrepresentations are often those that are identified as sexually exploitative – images in which women are depicted simply as bodies or body parts to be observed and desired rather than social agents who have complex desires and drives of their own. In this respect, Sheri Kathleen Cole discusses the ‘pornographic ideology of music video’; Imani Perry condemns hip hop videos in which women ‘are often presented as vacuous, doing nothing but swaying around seductively’; and Julie L. Andsager and Kimberley Roe criticise country music videos which ‘often trivialise women’ or in which women ‘portray themselves in traditional ways, mostly as sex objects’.1 Conversely, positive images of women are those in which women are identified as providing good role models for their audience by, for example, producing videos which celebrate ‘female resourcefulness and cultural distinctiveness’ or ‘in which the privileged experiences of boys and men are visually appropriated’.2 For many critics Madonna is exemplary in this respect inasmuch as she is seen to variously defy, challenge and redefine hegemonic representations of femininity. E. Ann Kaplan suggests, for instance, that in combining ‘unabashed seductiveness with a gutsy kind of independence’ she represents ‘the postmodern feminist heroine’, while David Gauntlett argues that she ‘made it possible to articulate feminist ideas in an accessible (or indeed sexually provocative) way’ and thus ‘paved the way’ for, and empowered, a younger generation of female performers.3 Either way, this type of research is predicated on a threefold premise: firstly, and most obviously, ‘the notion that the recurring images of women in popular media have some influence on how people think of women in real life’; secondly, that these images of women are\n\n18\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 18\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nSITUATING MUSIC VIDEO\n\nsimply either positive or negative, good or bad, progressive or reactionary; and lastly, that it is possible to know which is which and, by implication to adjudicate on the respective politics of the image by measuring it against external reality, that is to say, the way real women are, or could/should be, in the real world.4 Despite more nuanced versions of this brand of criticism – which acknowledge that music videos ‘can operate in multiple ways’ that ‘allow for a range of interpretations and uses’ that ‘can be read as either subversive of patriarchal constructions of femininity’ or as a site where dominant discourses are reinforced and reinscribed – it nevertheless inevitably operates within a realist paradigm in so far as it turns upon a distinction between real women and images of women.5 If, however, reality and the real world are seen as inextricably bound up with, indeed produced through, forms of representation, then feminine identity, like all cultural identities, is neither interior to the body nor anterior to representation but only knowable and transformable through its discursive articulation. Indeed, in this respect, perhaps the most powerful image of stupid girls (2006) depicts Pink lying naked from the waist up on an operating table with her body already marked-up for modification, enhancement and improvement by a surgeon’s knife. The political import of this image emerges not simply from the implied relationship between mutilation and perfection, but more importantly from the way it signals the plasticity of identity. In other words, despite the rather crude binarism which stupid girls establishes between vacuous femininity and female enlightenment, the video consistently draws attention to the idea that gendered identity and the sexed self cannot be reduced to, or fixed within, the fact of the biological body. For in the end it is, of course, Pink herself who performs the video’s various incarnations of both ‘stupid’ and empowered femininity. As such, stupid girls visualises both the body and sexed/gendered identity as contingent and malleable, or, more precisely, as selected, produced and performed within specific discursive formations. One implication of this is that the ontological imperative to locate identity in the facticity of the sexed body is suspended and attention is instead redirected towards the historical realm of social and cultural production. On this account, gendered being is not an inevitable state of embodiment but, more complexly, is understood as a range of possibilities for being in the world instigated by the various ways the fact of the body is (re)presented in discourse and becomes meaningful within specific historical conditions. A second implication, therefore, is that the field of cultural representation becomes situated not only as the locus of the production of identity formations, but also as perhaps the key site for political analysis and intervention. One of the most important tenets of postmodern and poststructural theories is the notion that the self is not an essential self rooted in genetic make-up or formed in early psychological development but, rather, a discursively\n\n19\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 19\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nconstructed self produced and maintained through the workings of a multiplicity of cultural institutions and practices. In other words, our identity is not something that comes from within, something to be revealed in its truth or concealed in its denial; it is a product of our specific social, cultural and historical situation. Moreover, this discursively constructed self can be understood as a self-construction in that, given the range of discourses on any given topic circulating at a particular time, there are always choices to be made between complementary or competing ways of being in the world. Cultural products, therefore, have political significance not because they conceal the truth of the world or misrepresent the truth of the self, but because they provide us with the bricks and mortar from which we construct ourselves and the world around us. It is in this sense, then, that the products of popular culture are a key means by which the discourses through which we understand ourselves, through which we are ourselves, circulate and become legitimate in the society in which we live. Given this, if music videos do not reflect or distort reality but are part of the discursive field in which it is produced, then it becomes necessary to consider what resources they provide for the construction of the self and the ways in which these resources both enable and delimit ways of being in the world. In other words, criticism which is directed towards separating out good images from bad ones in order to promote the former and critique the latter only gets one so far. For not only does it tend to imply a rather crude model of communication in which images deemed distortive of reality are seen to have a negative effect on either society or the individual and those deemed progressive are, conversely, said to produce positive effects, it also, perhaps more problematically, rests on the idea that reality itself is singular, veridical and knowable independently of its articulation through forms of language. Indeed, as Charlotte Brunsdon argues, to search for, or call for, ‘realistic images of women is to engage in the struggle to define what is meant by “realistic” ’. And, of course, this kind of quarrel over how the world really is, ‘is always an argument for the representation of “your” version of reality’.6 So, in terms of Pink’s stupid girls, this would mean that the young girl ought to make the choice to leave her girly toys alone – conceived as tools of a patriarchal culture which socialise her into ‘feminine stupidity’ and subservience – and instead pick up the football and play with the boys. However, within the narrative economy of the video, this is not a choice at all since there is no value afforded to the markers of femininity. Moreover, the very fact that it is presented as an either/or choice negates the possibility of engaging with and finding value in the multiple identity positions which are possible within the overarching categories of femininity and womanhood. Indeed, whatever else the analysis of the representation of women in music videos reveals, it throws into stark relief the possibility of embodying a range of feminine identities and demonstrates\n\n20\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 20\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nSITUATING MUSIC VIDEO\n\nthat there are a range of ways of inhabiting a female body. And while, as we discuss in the following chapters, this multiplicity is often circumscribed by long-standing discourses of both patriarchy and (hetero)sexuality, it nevertheless remains the case that the images of women produced by music video are too various and complex to be reduced to a simple either/or game. The Politics of Postfeminism It is of course precisely these kinds of question – questions to do with the relationship between liberation, consumption and mass-mediated images of both feminism and femininity – that are central to much contemporary feminist debate. Moreover, the term increasingly being mobilised in such debates is ‘postfeminism’, a label which is, as Yvonne Tasker and Diane Negra suggest, simultaneously both troubling and compelling.7 For some critics, it is troubling in so far as the prefix itself all too literally announces the end of feminism by signalling that we have entered an historical period that succeeds it.8 Indeed, in this respect ‘postfeminism’ is used critically and derogatively by some feminists to describe the position of other writers, who may or may not claim to be feminist, who argue that feminism’s battles are won. Perhaps the most controversial of these writers is Katie Roiphe. Described as an ‘antifeminist feminist postfeminist’ by Sarah Projansky, both Roiphe’s name and her work have become synonymous with a naive conservatism variously branded as retro-sexism, lipstick feminism, new sexism, and ‘do-me-feminism’.9 At the heart of this position is the contentious claim that a feminist critique is no longer needed precisely because its political project has been realised. In a recent interview, Roiphe herself sums up this position in claiming that: The revolution has succeeded . . . The feminists of the Seventies should be happy. They should kick back and have a giant Scotch as they survey the world and see that they have won. There is nothing better for the feminist movement than looking in the face of its own extinction.10 While agreeing that the term may signal the end of a distinctly feminist politics and critique, other critics interrogate their putative demise along different lines. Easily the most cited example of this is Susan Faludi’s book, Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women, which squarely equates postfeminism with antifeminism. For her, the emergence of postfeminist discourse in America in the 1980s was part of a neo-conservative response to the political changes brought about by the achievements of second-wave feminism, a response which, on the one hand, claimed that women had achieved equality while, on the other hand, argued that feminism had let women down. On this view, the notion of postfeminism became bound up with a much broader\n\n21\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 21\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nbacklash against feminism which was ‘set off not by women’s achievement of full equality but by the increased possibility that they might win it’.11 In other words, it became a key weapon in the ‘pre-emptive strike’ that prevented feminism reaching its political terminus. Indeed, for Faludi, the incursion of antifeminist discourse into the feminist cultural sphere itself is proof positive of the insidious nature of the backlash. The media’s co-option and popularisation of the brand of feminism expressed by, amongst others, Roiphe, Christina Hoff Sommers, Naomi Wolf and Camille Paglia, not only serves as a distraction from the ‘proper’ foci of feminist critique, but worse, is part of the process by which it is repudiated. Taking her metaphor from the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) she argues that postfeminism is ‘a media-assisted invasion of the body of the women’s movement: the Invasion of the Feminist Snatchers, intent on repopulating the ranks with Pod Feminists’.12 The irony of this reading, of course, is that the ‘stars’ of postfeminist publishing and lecturing become the strongest and most vocal advocates for antifeminist ideas.13 More recently, Angela McRobbie has offered what she calls a ‘complexification’ of this backlash thesis.14 Whereas Faludi focuses on concerted antifeminist strategies she identifies in the media that either adopt a negative view towards feminism outright or encourage women back into traditionally feminine roles within the home and family, McRobbie suggests that it is precisely the media’s appropriation of feminist issues that contributes to the undoing of feminism. She argues that postfeminist culture ‘positively draws on and invokes feminism as that which can be taken into account, to suggest that equality is achieved, in order to install a whole repertoire of new meanings, which emphasize that it is no longer needed, it is a spent force’.15 For McRobbie, the very fact that feminist ideas and concerns are articulated and disseminated through popular mediated forms, the very fact that they are taken into account, means that feminism as a political movement is deferred and displaced onto the media itself. In this respect, it is the very ‘taken into accountness’ that permits ‘an all the more thorough dismantling of feminist politics’.16 Even though McRobbie does not entirely reject the notion of postfeminism she is nevertheless deeply concerned about the way in which its assimilation into popular discourse naturalises it and transforms it into a form of Gramscian common-sense. Indeed, a number of critics argue that it is precisely the commodification of feminism, its increasing collocation with capitalist practice, that recasts the image of the modern feminist from a political identity into a consumer choice. Put simply, postfeminism becomes equated with, or worse reduced to, images of successful women. That is to say, stories of women’s educational and professional success, images of empowered female sexuality, and even accounts of women who ‘choose’ to return to domesticity are seen as mileage markers on the road to women’s liberation. McRobbie refers to this as ‘female individualisation’, a process by which the language of\n\n22\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 22\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nSITUATING MUSIC VIDEO\n\ncollective activism is replaced by a language of personal choice and responsibility for not being successful is displaced from the social structure onto individual women.17 As Susan J. Douglas suggests, the clear implication of this is that ‘whatever challenges women face in juggling work and family are their individual struggles, to be conquered through good planning, smart choices, and an upbeat outlook’.18 This is a version of feminism which celebrates individual female agency, economic independence and the emancipatory powers of consumption. It is feminism defined as a kind of project of the self, a process of achieving freedom and autonomy through retail choices, a situation in which ‘a woman’s right to choose’ no longer refers to abortion and control of the reproductive process but, rather, to whether to decide to buy Jimmy Choos or Manholo Blahniks. Imogen Tyler has called this ‘narcissism as liberation’, arguing that a ‘new culture of pampering’ has emerged that encourages ‘women to compensate themselves for sexual inequality, and the difficulty of lives spent juggling the competing priorities of work and motherhood, through the consumption of scented candles and bubble-bath’.19 Of course, it is not difficult to see why many critics find this definition of postfeminism troubling. In denying collectivity and focusing on discourses of individual ambition and self-improvement, and by eschewing a macro-politics of social change in favour of a micro-politics of personal lifestyle, the image of sexually empowered, professionally successful and economically independent women functions as a synecdoche for all women. Indeed, this model of postfeminism ignores evident economic disparities between women as well as those between men and women and thus tends to emerge as a white middle-class discourse by default. In other words, the privileging of personal success and the pleasure of consumption runs the risk of glossing over very real axes of socioeconomic difference which continue to not only limit women’s potential to succeed and ability to consume, but also constrain the ‘choices’ that even economically successful, independent women are able to make. For this reason, postfeminism, at least in some critical quarters, is shorthand for the depoliticisation of feminism and the latest in a long line of attempts to dupe women into thinking that equality has been achieved and that feminism is therefore no longer relevant. That is to say, the popularisation of feminist issues and concerns through the media has led to a slippage between the notions and practices of postfeminist culture and (post)feminist politics where the former term has come to stand in for the latter. The process of taking feminism into account has thus ironically produced feminism as, in Kathleen Rowe Karlyn’s phrase, ‘a structuring absence’ in postfeminism, something that dare not be spoken of, in fact something that must be disavowed in order to be a ‘good’ postfeminist.20 If the notion of postfeminism is troubling then it is simultaneously compelling. Indeed, a significant part of its allure lies in the same ground that people\n\n23\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 23\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nfind troubling. For even if the relationship between feminism and popular culture is often an uneasy one, and even if the link between the mediation of feminist issues and the actual experience of real women is unclear, the idea of postfeminism nevertheless impels us towards trying to understand precisely the nature of these imbrications. In other words, whatever else the term implies, and regardless of whether one accepts it or treats it with caution, postfeminism does at least direct critical attention towards the now: towards a situation where it is no longer practical or possible to separate out discourses of feminism from the way in which those discourses are produced, negotiated, and defined through popular culture. Perhaps most obviously, but not unimportantly, it acknowledges the fact that ‘rather than coming to consciousness through involvement in feminist movements, most people [now] become conscious of feminism through the way it is represented in popular culture’.21 And of course, this partly explains why the generations of women born in the aftermath of second-wave activism tend not to identify themselves as feminist while at the same time articulating particular concerns which are clearly central to feminist debates. As such, it is precisely through an engagement with the media and consumer culture that young women now construct their identities and understand themselves as social subjects. Indeed, within global capitalism there is little alternative to this. Instead of bemoaning this state of affairs, or simply pointing out its more obvious limitations, it seems more productive to use our energies in an attempt to understand this process at the level of both representation and self-representation. It is at this point, where feminism intersects with forms of cultural representation – in particular the forms of representation that constitute popular culture – that postfeminism most clearly chimes with a range of other ‘posts’, most notably poststructuralism and postmodernism. Notwithstanding some important differences between the terms, all three posts nevertheless point towards a particular understanding of reality, history and identity, and their relationship to language and representation. Indeed, above all else, the post-ing of these terms problematises the idea that there is an exterior to representation, a position outside or above language from which it is possible to know the truth of the world. In dispensing with the idea that there is a way that things are in themselves, and the idea that it is ever possible to discover or ‘know’ this, the self becomes uncoupled from either biology or psychology and instead emerges as a product of discourse. In other words, there is no one, authentic, essential self that lies at the root of one’s being, but rather being one’s self is constituted from the more or less self-conscious presentation of identity or personality through and within the available discursive structure. It is, of course, the work of Michel Foucault which clears the ground for the articulation of this position. One of Foucault’s key interventions is to locate the question of individual identity within a broader consideration of the relationship between\n\n24\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 24\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nSITUATING MUSIC VIDEO\n\ntruth, power and self. In developing what he calls a ‘hermeneutics of technologies of the self’, he resists the idea that individual selfhood is simply determined and controlled by either ideology or regimes of power.22 For Foucault, technologies of the self are: those intentional and voluntary actions by which men [sic] not only set themselves rules of conduct, but also seek to transform themselves, to change themselves in their singular being, and to make their life into an oeuvre that carries certain aesthetic values and meets certain stylistic criteria.23 One clear implication of this is that subjects are active in the process of constituting and presenting themselves. In defining it alongside a series of other technologies – of production, of sign systems and of power – each of which is associated with certain types of domination, technologies of the self can be seen as the specific repertoire of methods and techniques which allow individuals to simultaneously work on themselves and police themselves within the totality of the prevailing discursive structure. The political rub of this position is that power is not simply repressive, and, moreover, individual identity is not simply the result of power’s impress. So while, on the one hand, who we are, what we do, and what we are able to do is clearly shaped and constrained by regimes of power, on the other hand it is precisely those regimes of power that provide us with the raw materials from which we shape ourselves and come to understand who we are. And it is in this sense that Foucault’s work impels us to pose the question of social subjectivity as not only one of how an individual is acted upon, but also one of how an ‘individual acts upon himself [sic]’.24 The cash value of this position for feminist theory, and in particular feminist studies of the media and culture, is twofold. Firstly, it not only short circuits the idea that postfeminism is simply a backlash against proper feminism, it also offers us a way of explaining how an individualised, popular feminism need not be a depoliticised one. Foucault’s work on the history of domination, and how that history always informs the present, offers up a much more complex framework for understanding both historical and contemporary manifestations of feminism and feminist practice. For instance, much criticism which sees postfeminism as either antifeminism or part of a backlash against feminism turns on a rather crude opposition between a putatively authentic feminist position and an inauthentic feminine one. On this view, the authentic feminist critic plies her wares by identifying and criticising images of women from popular culture that apparently resuscitate normalised and/or nostalgic femininities, even if those images seemingly trade in postmodern irony, in order to reinscribe gender relations from a previous era. However, if, following Foucault’s line of thinking, feminism itself is seen as a specific product of\n\n25\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 25\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\ndiscourse with its own associated regimes of truth, knowledge and power then there can be no single authentic feminism but only a continuous process of negotiating what feminism means. One implication of this, therefore, is that postfeminism can be understood as one term which describes a feminism of now, which is, of course, also a product of discursive practice. It is in this sense that Charlotte Brunsdon argues that the term postfeminism not only attributes an historical specificity to second-wave feminism but also suggests that contemporary feminism is ‘post-1970s feminism in ways that are not simply chronological’.25 So while on the one hand, the prefix ‘post’ does perform a periodisation function in so far as it designates a moment of feminist history that succeeds the women’s movement of the 1960s and 1970s, on the other hand it signals a particular relationship to second-wave feminism that is not straightforwardly contiguous, antagonistic or dismissive. By the same token, if we consider femininity as something which is discursively produced, it cannot be only ever the bad Other to feminism, something to be resisted on the path to becoming an enlightened feminist. In this respect we should approach the question of contemporary femininity as something which also stands in a particular historical and discursive relation to second-wave feminism. For contemporary femininities take shape and are lived in a context where second-wave feminism is, as McRobbie says, taken into account, that is to say, a situation in which the gains made by the feminist movement have been installed as part of, and have informed, everyday discourse. As such, these ‘new femininities’ may on one level appear anachronistic and nostalgic yet they do come after second-wave feminism and thus come with both the rhetoric of independence and liberation used by the women’s movement and the political advances it achieved. One way of conceptualising postfeminism, therefore, is as ‘the coming together of “traditional” feminist values with a historically and materially different experience of being young and female’.26 It is, of course, the friction generated by this coming together that makes postfeminism such a controversial term. The place where these issues most often meet, indeed the place where they often seem fused together, is in the sphere of popular culture, and, more specifically, in the increasing number of images of apparently successful young women who seem to have benefitted from growing up in the wake of second-wave feminism. Indeed, images of strong, sexually liberated and economically independent women now regularly fill our cinema, television and computer screens: whether it is the characters in much-discussed shows such as Sex and the City, Ally McBeal and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the increasing number of weapon-wielding, karate-kicking, ‘action babes’ in the cinema, the proliferation of Lara Croft-influenced digital heroines, the type of post-Madonna pop star who is able to change sexual identity as often as hairstyle, or even the Desperate Housewives who live behind the white picket fences of Wisteria Lane, there is now an identifiable\n\n26\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 26\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nSITUATING MUSIC VIDEO\n\nand emerging canon of postfeminist culture which, in various ways, trades on the idea that contemporary women can be both powerful and feminine at the same time. The theoretical and political dilemma is, of course, how to read these images, how to distil their significance not only for feminism and but also from a feminist position. One response might be to pick these texts off one by one, index their representational content against feminist analytical criteria, and adjudicate on their relative progressive or regressive nature. This is an approach which has a long-standing tradition in feminist cultural criticism and which turns on the idea that challenging negative images of women and promoting positive ones is a key strategy in exposing institutional sexism and levelling up the life opportunities of women to those of men. It is this method that produces a particular brand of postfeminist criticism, one which engages in analysis of this or that image of modern empowered femininity in order to either a) chart the distance travelled in gender politics in direct proportion to the degree of liberation the critic finds in the text; or b) to claim that we have in fact not come very far at all and that women continue to be defined by the same old sexual stereotypes. This is why a show such as Sex and the City can, on the one hand, be seen as ‘revolutionary . . . a great study of female friendship’ and on the other hand dismissed as ‘soft-vanilla feminism’ where ‘the characters just come across as the same sort of air-brushed, be-make-upped, bland women, no different to all the women on TV before’.27 Each response, however, is really only the opposing side of the same coin which sets out to ‘discover’ whether a particular text or a particular heroine is good or bad for women. And while this kind of approach has been instructive in terms of pointing up the limited ways in which women have been represented historically, and continues to bear fruit in the hands of certain critics, there nevertheless remain a number of theoretical and political problems associated with it. Firstly, it runs the risk of setting up feminism as a simultaneously censorious and prescriptive discourse – outlawing certain texts, pleasures and behaviours while celebrating others as promoting appropriate and useful feminist messages. This is often laced with a recruitist or pedagogic strategy which attempts to highlight the virtues of the latter over the former, one which critiques bad feminism in order to throw good feminism into relief. The dilemma here is not only that such disagreements over the definition of authentic feminism are politically self-refuting, but also that they tend to ignore the very women on whose behalf they are apparently conducted. The idea, for instance, that the history of feminism can adequately be understood as, or reduced to, metaphors of generational conflict or distinct waves belies the fact that there is far more continuity and connection between feminism’s various incarnations than there is rupture and disjunction. Moreover, one thing that has changed over the past forty years or so is the way that women are now able to live their lives.\n\n27\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 27\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nContemporary feminism, if it is to remain relevant and effective, needs to be able to account for, and to take into account, these changes much more than it needs to agree on a singular definition of itself. By the same token, feminist cultural criticism might do well to avoid the temptation to simply use the texts of popular culture as a pretext for spinning its own tales of resistance, recuperation, revolution and recontainment. This is not to say that some mainstream texts do not demand to be subjected to feminist criticism – that is, squarely criticised for their restrictive, reactionary, or just downright offensive representations of women. Rather, it is to suggest that this brand of feminist cultural criticism perhaps needs to be complemented by a more nuanced approach to the politics of representation, one which forestalls the desire to simply pass judgement on a text’s politics and instead locates its representations within a broader cultural repertoire of images, meanings and discourses from which we construct a sense of who we are. In other words, it is one thing for feminist criticism to intervene in popular culture in order to make itself heard, but quite another to accept that popular culture itself intervenes not only in the process of constructing our individual identities, but also in the process of understanding certain identities as being feminist. If, as Richard Dyer argues, the way in which a social group is treated in representation bears fundamentally not only on how members of that group are able to see themselves and others like themselves but also on how others perceive that group, then that is as true for the social group we call feminists as for any other social group.28 One implication of this, therefore, is that popular culture is a site where definitions of both women and feminists are produced, not simply reproduced. This impels us towards a more complex understanding of the relationships between reality and the way that reality is manifested in representation. This is not simply to rehearse the now well-worn postmodern idea that representation can never capture the full extent of unruly reality, nor the idea that reality itself is entirely reducible to an endless chain of representations. Rather, it is to say, with Dyer, that ‘the analysis of images always needs to see how any given instance is embedded in a network of other instances’ and thus cannot be pinned down to definite and final meanings.29 It is to say, in other words, that the tension between the world and the textuality of representation is usually too complex, too messy, too elusive and, in the end, too interesting to be explained by recourse to an either/or logic, a logic which positions texts as either one thing or another: good or bad, positive or negative, enabling or constricting, feminist or not. Representations don’t work like this so we shouldn’t analyse them as if they do. Moreover, even if this kind of either/or analysis tells us something about its author’s politics it often does so at the expense of telling us very much about the difficult business of how representations work politically.\n\n28\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 28\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nSITUATING MUSIC VIDEO\n\nPink Postfeminism How then is it possible to understand Pink’s stupid girls as distinctly postfeminist and what is the intellectual and political value in doing so? Moreover, what is it, if anything, that constitutes postfeminist analysis, and how does this meet with and depart from feminist analysis? Firstly, and perhaps most obviously, stupid girls is postfeminist inasmuch as it is a product of a postfeminist moment. In other words, if we take Charlotte Brunsdon’s historically specific, ‘relatively neutral’ notion of postfeminism as a marker of periodisation, ‘a way of differentiating second-wave feminism from what came subsequently’, then the video’s articulation of feminine identities can be considered postfeminist in the sense that they are clearly informed by second-wave feminism but are produced and circulate in a cultural time that comes after it.30 However, while this approach to defining postfeminism is, relatively speaking, uncontroversial and does serve to take the sting out of the debate, its apparent neutrality often belies the textual and political complexity of the specific cultural products it periodises and classifies. Specifically in terms of stupid girls, it is significant that its representations include not only the strong can-do girls of second-wave feminism, but also the ‘girls with ambition’ who dream of being president, and the powered-up consumer babes so often associated with postfeminism – the ones you’ll find in Fred Segal ‘with their itsy bitsy doggies and [wearing] their teeny-weeny Ts’.31 It is also significant, moreover, that despite being a product of postfeminism in the historically specific sense, the video engages in a forthright attack in its parodies of celebrified, brand-driven girliness, those images of what Rosalind Gill has identified as ‘the sexually autonomous heterosexual young woman who plays with her sexual power and is forever “up for it” ’.32 And, of course, this is precisely the kind of commercialised hyper-femininity that is variously reclaimed, dismissed, recuperated and resisted in postfeminist debates. Gill’s analysis is concerned with what she calls the ‘re-sexualisation and re-commodification of women’s bodies’ in forms of contemporary media culture and suggests that images of putatively independent women are often ‘endowed with agency’ only in so far as ‘they can actively choose to objectify themselves’. Moreover, she argues that this shift towards women’s ‘freely chosen’ self-objectification ‘fits very well with broader postfeminist discourses which present women as autonomous agents no longer constrained by any inequalities or power imbalances, who can somehow choose to “use beauty” to make themselves feel good’.33 While Gill acknowledges that one way of understanding this situation is to see it as playful and ironic, as somehow both an assertion of liberation and a celebration of sexual power, her own reading is far more pessimistic in arguing that women’s sexual subjectivity, rather than being liberatory, has ‘turned out to be objectification in a new and even more pernicious guise’.34 In terms of stupid girls, the video’s own irony\n\n29\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 29\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nand playfulness is activated, not to reclaim sexualised femininity in the name of postfeminist equality, but rather to drive home its critique of women who now have choices but use those choices to turn themselves into sexual objects. In other words, on one reading the video can be seen as a broadside against a generation of young women who have clearly benefited from the message of second-wave feminism, indeed can be seen as the living evidence of its success, while simultaneously appearing to be completely oblivious to that message. On this view, the video operates as a more or less straightforward secondwave feminist critique of postfeminism in so far as its attack on femininity chimes with the work of a number of prominent second-wave writers who sought to expose the insidious links between femininity and patriarchy. Three of the most vociferous of these critics are Shulamith Firestone, Germaine Greer and Susan Brownmiller, who all set out to expose the restrictive and damaging consequences bound up in the myth of femininity. For instance, in The Dialectic of Sex, Firestone equates femininity with what she calls ‘the beauty ideal’. She argues that ‘every society has promoted a certain ideal of beauty over all others. What that ideal is is unimportant, for any ideal leaves the majority out.’ In other words, the political function of any given society’s beauty ideal resides in its final unattainability. The result is that women are ‘left scrambling’, in the ‘rush to squeeze into the glass slipper, forcing and mutilating their bodies with diets and beauty programmes, clothes and makeup’. For Firestone, women are only allowed to achieve individuality by looking good, where good is defined as the ‘more or less successful approximation to an external standard’, a standard defined by men.35 Writing at the same time as Firestone, Germaine Greer takes up similar ideas in discussing ‘the myth of the Eternal Feminine’, what she herself terms ‘the Stereotype’. She argues that the stereotype is ‘the dominant image of femininity which rules our culture and to which all women aspire’. This image, however, is a manufactured one, an effect ‘built up layer by layer’ from the cultural trappings of femininity deployed to beautify women – clothes and jewellery, hair and make-up, behaviour and demeanour. The ultimate function of these ‘servile fripperies’ which define the feminine stereotype is to confirm the woman’s primary function as sex object. The political problem with the stereotype is that it must work within stringent limits. As Greer argues, ‘nothing must interfere with her function as sex object’ and, in the end, the only thing that she can signify is ‘the lineaments of satisfied impotence’.36 And it is precisely this impotence, the necessary disavowal of sexual subjectivity, that underpins Greer’s definition of the female eunuch. But perhaps the most sustained second-wave critique of the political workings of femininity is Susan Brownmiller’s 1984 study, Femininity. For Brownmiller, femininity ‘is a romantic sentiment, a nostalgic tradition of imposed limitations’. She suggests that, for the woman who works at femininity the world ‘extends little courtesies and minor privilege’. However, these apparent cour-\n\n30\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 30\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nSITUATING MUSIC VIDEO\n\ntesies and privileges are in two senses illusory. Firstly, to work at one’s femininity necessarily entails competition, a process that sets women against each other in their attempts to attain the ‘feminine ideal’. The irony of this game is that even for women who are good at it ‘femininity always demands more’, can never be completed. The upshot is that femininity is a game with definite rules but no winners. Secondly, Brownmiller argues that women can only work at femininity in the first place ‘by accepting restrictions, by limiting one’s sights, by choosing an indirect route, by scattering concentration and not giving one’s all’. Femininity, then, emerges as ‘a grand collection of compromises’ that every woman ‘simply must make in order to render herself a successful woman’.37 So for all these critics, femininity is a powerful force for preventing women’s success in the world. They can only ever aim to be successfully feminine, successful at being a woman, and the project of successfully being a woman distracts from, interferes with, and ultimately prevents, their success in any other field. It is not difficult to see how stupid girls’ own attack on the ‘servile fripperies’ of contemporary hyperfemininity might be fitted into this frame. Its exquisitely groomed goddesses of consumer culture are damned as inauthentic, merely the cosmetically and surgically enhanced products of privileged spending power, mindlessly pursuing this season’s fashion at the expense of all else. To use Greer’s terms, not only does the feminine stereotype determine the definition of the female sex, but the idea that ‘she is more body than soul, more soul than mind’ is pushed to its limits.38 For in stupid girls to be feminine is to be only a body. However, while on one level there appears to be a snug fit between this reading of the video and second-wave feminism’s scepticism of femininity, on other levels the fit is much less comfortable. Most importantly, whereas Firestone, Greer and Brownmiller in various ways locate the feminine ideal as a product of complex historical and political forces which impose femininity onto women in order to control them, the video eschews any structural explanation for its characters’ behaviour and instead blames the individual women for making the wrong choices, that is to say, for being stupid. While in some ways this is a subtle difference it is nevertheless a crucial one. Not only does it undercut many of the political precepts of second-wave feminism – notably systemic inequality, sisterhood and collective action – but by emphasising that it is the choice of individual women to be stupid, to want to dance ‘in a video next to 50 cent’ instead of aiming to become the ‘next female president’, stupid girls assumes that patriarchy is no longer a problem and that real choices can be freely made. By contrast, Greer contends that women’s impotent femininity is a product of social and economic conditioning. She argues that while women do know what they are, they are prevented from knowing what they may be or might have been by ‘the ineluctable result of law’ and their specific role within a capitalist economy.39 Brownmiller locates\n\n31\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 31\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nMUSIC VIDEO AND THE POLITICS OF REPRESENTATION\n\nthe origins of femininity partly in ‘borrowed affectations of upper-class status’, partly in its relationship to the ‘seductive glamour’ of the biologically female body, but also in the ‘historic subjugation of women through sexual violence, religion and law, where certain myths about the nature of women were put forward as biological fact’.40 Moreover, Firestone discusses precisely the ‘severe feminine neurosis about personal appearance’ that stupid girls takes as its subject. However, whereas the video places the blame for being stupid squarely on the shoulders of individual women, Firestone sees the definition of stupidity as part and parcel of structural sexed oppression. She argues that: When women begin to look more and more alike, distinguished only by the degree to which they differ from a paper ideal, they can be more easily stereotyped as a class: They look alike, they think alike, and even worse, they are so stupid that they believe they are not alike.41 The politics of the position outlined here, as well as by Greer and Brownmiller, is quite different to that found in the video. For Firestone, women’s apparent stupidity is an effect of a more generalised process of stereotyped femininity which works to control and oppress women as a sexed class. By contrast, in individuating its women and making clear distinctions and value judgements between competing versions of ideal femininity, the video declasses women, replacing political narrative with personal drama as its explanation for its characters’ stupidity. It is right here, of course, that the entire dilemma concerning the relationship between second-wave feminism and postfeminism continues to replay itself, where definitions of the latter always take place within, and indeed require, the shadow cast by the former yet at the same time the very existence of the former term implies a desire, even a need, to wriggle free from the latter. In other words, of all the potential paradoxes associated with the idea of postfeminism perhaps the key one is that, in attempting to articulate the feminism of now, it seems to need to return to an earlier manifestation of itself in order to do so. This kind of paradox finds particularly interesting expression in stupid girls. While self-evidently being a product of a postfeminist historical cultural moment, its narrative of female empowerment and its images of strong, positive role models really only cohere if located within the political context of second-wave feminism. However, the video’s historical context inevitably interferes with its narrative, blaming individual women for choosing a lifestyle of docile femininity over a life of freedom and possibility, a choice which itself betrays the video’s historical postfeminism. And yet, the video clearly does not celebrate postfeminism, attacking the superficiality of consumer culture, criticising the barbarism of cosmetic surgery, and vilifying as mindless and inauthentic the kind of women who construct themselves out of\n\n32\n\nRAILTON PRINT.indd 32\n\n31/05/2011 12:02\n\nSITUATING MUSIC VIDEO\n\nthese things. Moreover, this critique of women who willingly engage in sexual self-objectification is quite different to the second-wave’s critique of the institutional objectification of women’s bodies and its demand for women’s right to sexual subjectivity. The result of this is a cultural text which, on the one hand, is clearly energised by both feminist histories and discourses while, on the other hand, being confused about which particular history it draws from and which particular discourse if seeks to promote. Indeed, in this respect the video can be said to operate as a kind of anti-postfeminist, postfeminist feminism. So, the video, like so much of the debate surrounding postfeminism, is characterised by paradox. But paradox can occasionally be productive. Or rather, our response to paradox can be productive inasmuch as paradox can point towards new questions, new ways of thinking, and, in certain cases, new answers to those questions. One response to the questions generated by the relationship of postfeminism to second-wave feminism has been to offer more and more definitions of what the prefix ‘post’ actually refers to and to sketch in ever finer detail exactly what it is that distinguishes one term from the other. While much of this work has proved invaluable in reinvigorating feminist theory, one way of understanding it is as an attempt to solve a paradox. In other words, it proceeds from the assumption that there is a proper, identifiable relationship between the two instead of a messy tangle of overlapping, complementary and competing ideas. A possible drawback of this response is that it can become simply a scholastic end in itself, confusing political objectives with theoretical ones and ending up as a self-perpetuating intellectual project. Better, perhaps, to accept that the situation is paradoxical and that a c"
