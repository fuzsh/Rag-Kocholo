        "text": "Succession, Beef and The Bear were the big winners at the Emmy Awards, which took place on Monday in Los Angeles.\n\nSarah Snook, Kieran Culkin and Matthew Macfadyen all took home acting prizes for Succession, while the show also won best drama series overall.\n\nCreator Jesse Armstrong said it was \"a great sadness to end the show, but it was a great pleasure to do it\".\n\nAlso at the ceremony, Sir Elton John won his first Emmy Award, finally giving him EGOT status.\n\nThat means he has joined an exclusive club of performers who have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award.\n\nElton Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium won best live variety special, marking the British singer-songwriter's first Emmy nomination and award.\n\nHowever, Sir Elton could not pick up the honour after having a knee operation. He wrote on Instagram that he was \"on cloud nine\" after the win and joked that his knee problem was \"a gentle reminder, perhaps, of a lifetime spent jumping off pianos\".\n\nHe added: \"Honoured to have joined the hallowed ranks of EGOT winners, here's to the joy of music and the magic it brings to our lives!\"\n\nOther winners on the night included The White Lotus and Abbott Elementary.\n\nSuccession, the critically acclaimed drama about a media mogul and the power struggles between his dysfunctional family, concluded last year after four seasons.\n\nIt was rewarded generously at the Emmys, winning best drama series and prizes for writing and directing, while Snook and Culkin won best leading drama actress and actor for playing Shiv and Roman Roy respectively.\n\n\"The bar was set so high and that was what spurred us on,\" Snook said of Succession's success.\n\nShe also thanked her parents, telling them: \"Mum and dad - thank you for having a dress-up box when I was a kid, this is where it gets you!\"\n\nSnook dedicated the award to her daughter, commenting: \"The biggest thank you I think though is to someone who won't understand anything that I'm saying at the moment, but I carried her with me in this last season and really it was her who carried me.\n\n\"It's very easy to act when you're pregnant because you've got hormones raging and it was more that the proximity of her life growing inside me gave me the strength to do this and this performance.\"\n\nCo-star Culkin paid tribute to Armstrong \"for being a brilliant writer, showrunner and gentleman\".\n\nCulkin also thanked his two children and wife, before addressing her from the stage: \"And Jazz, I want more [children]. You said maybe, if I won!\"\n\nHe beat fellow Succession stars Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong, who had also been nominated in the best drama actor category.\n\nIn his own acceptance speech, British actor Macfadyen, who played Shiv's husband Tom, joked: \"I must make special mention to my on-screen wife Sarah Snook, and my other on-screen wife Nicholas Braun.\"\n\nBraun, a fellow nominee, plays Cousin Greg in Succession, and the two characters' relationship was a favourite with viewers.\n\n\"Acting with you has been one of the most wonderful things in my career, so thank you Nick, thank you Sarah,\" Macfadyen added.\n\nArmstrong, the Shropshire-born screenwriter who created the series, also scooped the top prize for best writing in a drama series.\n\nIn his speech, Armstrong referred back to the show's main plotline, joking: \"For some reason, the name of a certain Australia-born media mogul, Rupert Murdoch, springs to mind.\"\n\nHe added: \"I come from the UK and the show is about things that are close to the centre of American life and politics, and we've always been met with generosity and good faith and that's part of America's tradition of being very welcoming to outsiders.\"\n\nElsewhere, The Bear - a comedy-drama series about a chef who returns home to run his family's sandwich shop - won three acting prizes, for its star Jeremy Allen White, and supporting actors Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach.\n\nAccepting his award, White said: \"I am so full of gratitude to be standing in front of you all - I love this show so much, it filled me up, set a fire in me.\"\n\nEdebiri told the audience: \"This is a show about found family and real family, and my parents are here tonight - thank you so much for loving me and letting me feel beautiful and black and proud of all of that.\"\n\nSuccession and The Bear won six prizes each in the drama and comedy categories respectively, while Netflix's road rage-inspired series Beef dominated the limited series categories.\n\nAli Wong and Steven Yeun, the show's two stars, were named best actress and actor in a limited series respectively.\n\nAccepting the prize for best limited series, creator Lee Sung Jin said: \"I'm really grateful and humbled by everyone who watched the show and reached out about their own personal struggles, it's very life-affirming, so thank you.\"\n\nSeveral winners - including Snook, Culkin, Edebiri, White, Yeun and Wong - picked up their prizes just a week after winning equivalent trophies at the Golden Globes.\n\nMeanwhile, Quinta Brunson won the prize for best leading comedy actress for her role in school-based series Abbott Elementary.\n\nJennifer Coolidge was named best supporting drama actress for her role in privilege satire The White Lotus.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Coolidge joked that she wanted to \"thank all the evil gays\" - a reference to her storyline in the second season of The White Lotus.\n\nNiecy Nash-Betts won best supporting actress in a limited series for Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.\n\nShe said: \"I accept this award on behalf of every black and brown woman who has gone unheard yet over policed - like Glenda Cleveland, like Sandra Bland, like Breonna Taylor.\n\nCleveland, who Nash-Betts plays in the series, was the woman who alerted the police about the serial killer.\n\nLast Week Tonight with John Oliver had a good night, winning best scripted variety series, and writing for a variety series, while The Daily Show With Trevor Noah won best talk series.\n\nAccepting the award, RuPaul Charles said: \"If a drag queen wants to read you a story at a library, listen to her because knowledge is power, and if someone tries to restrict your access to power, they are trying to scare you. So listen to a drag queen!\"\n\nDead To Me star Christina Applegate, who has multiple sclerosis and uses a walking stick, became emotional as she received a standing ovation while presenting an award.\n\nAs the ceremony was the 75th Emmys, several famous TV casts reunited on stage - including stars from The Sopranos, Cheers, and All in the Family.\n\nThe Emmys, which were presented by actor and comedian Anthony Anderson, were delayed by four months due to the Hollywood strikes.\n\nNominations were announced in July and the ceremony was originally scheduled for September, but the writers' and actors' strikes meant very few nominees would have been able to attend."
