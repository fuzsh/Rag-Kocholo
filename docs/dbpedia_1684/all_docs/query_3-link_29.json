        "text": "The Oakland A’s decided to have some fun at the expense of the woebegone Chicago White Sox Tuesday night. The day before, the Sox had lost their 21st consecutive game, tying the American League futility record established by the 1988 Baltimore Orioles. Employing all the subtlety of a fastball to the ribs, the A’s serenaded their visitors with Taylor Swift’s hit song “22” over the Oakland Coliseum’s loudspeakers before Tuesday’s first pitch. The paltry announced crowd of 5,867 diehards ate it up, but the Sox had the last laugh, snapping their ignominious streak with a 5-1 victory.\n\n“I think it’s just a sigh of a relief,’’ Chicago pitcher Jonathan Cannon told reporters afterward. “We’re all major league players. We’ve got a lot of confidence in ourselves to go out and do our jobs every night, and it just wasn’t working out for us.”\n\nI’ll say.\n\nNo champagne bottles were uncorked. No victory cigars were lit. This was merely a brief respite in potentially the worst season by a Major League Baseball team since the 1889 Louisville Colonels went 27-111, finishing an astounding 66 ½ games behind the pennant-winning Brooklyn Bridegrooms. The Colonels’ .196 winning percentage (or .804 losing percentage if you prefer) seems safe. But the all-time record of 120 losses in a season, established by the 1962 New York Mets, is within strikeout distance.\n\nAs I type this, the White Sox sport a 28-88 record, a .241 winning percentage. With 46 games remaining, they would need to go at least 13-33 to supplant the ’62 Mets. That computes to a .282 winning percentage the rest of the way – definitely doable. Opponents have outscored them by 247 runs, and since July 10 through August 6, they’ve been held to one or no runs 32 times. They’re so bad, in fact, that if they won all their remaining games, they’d still finish with a losing record.\n\nUnlike the Sox, the ’62 Mets had the excuse of being an expansion team starting from scratch. They wound up becoming loveable losers, a cast of castoffs and newbies, led by colorful manager Casey Stengel, who had guided the New York Yankees to 10 pennants and seven World Series titles. That inaugural Mets team was immortalized by famed New York tabloid columnist Jimmy Breslin in his hilariously entertaining book, “Can’t Anybody Here Play This Game?” The title came from an exasperated Stengel one day while the skipper lamented how he had a defensive catcher (Chris Cannizzaro) who couldn’t catch the ball.\n\nOf all the characters, perhaps none epitomized that team’s ineptitude more than Marvelous Marv Throneberry, a has-been centerfielder who once had been compared to Hall-of-Famer Mickey Mantle. As Breslin wrote, tongue planted firmly in cheek, Throneberry “was a sight to behold.” In a game against the Cubs, Chicago’s Don Landrum found himself in a rundown between first base and second. Throneberry was among the posse in hot pursuit, but there was just one problem: He did not have the ball and was called for obstruction, allowing Landrum to be awarded second base.\n\nThen, in the bottom half of that inning, Throneberry smacked what appeared to be a triple. In his excitement sprinting around the bases, he forgot to touch first and second. As Marvelous Marv hitched up his pants on third base and soaked in the applause, the Cubs appealed the fact he had missed two bases and the umpires called him out.\n\nInterestingly, before that season, Stengel reached out to Rochester ace Johnny Antonelli to come out of retirement and pitch for the Mets. They offered him $38,000, which would have made Antonelli one of the highest paid pitchers in baseball and would have teamed the New York Giants southpaw with former Brooklyn Dodger rivals Gil Hodges and Duke Snider. But Antonelli had grown weary of the travel and wanted to spend more time in Rochester with his wife and young kids and his fledgling Firestone Tire business. That led to a humorous response from Stengel, who told a reporter: “I guess Johnny Antonelli is doing alright selling those black doughnuts (tires) in Rochester.”\n\nIn retrospect, it proved a wise decision. As Antonelli told me, had he signed, he might have suffered the same fate as Roger Craig, who recorded 23 losses that summer. While the Mets were setting a modern-day mark for most defeats, Antonelli was adding several stores to his burgeoning tire empire.\n\n***\n\nThis is going to sound ludicrous to the average Jack and Jill, but at $43 million per season, Josh Allen is underpaid. It’s all relative, of course. And relative to his peers, the Buffalo Bills super-duper-star quarterback is making less annually than Patrick Mahomes, Trevor Lawrence, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert, Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts, Deshaun Watson, and Jordan Love. Allen is more accomplished and deserving than all but Mahomes in that group. But timing is everything in life and in contracts, and the timing worked out better for others than it did for Allen.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, his current deal will take him through the 2028 season, when he turns 32. There’s plenty of fudging that can be done with signing bonuses and such, and I can see Buffalo, perhaps as soon as this season, restructuring Josh’s contract to put it more in line with lesser talented contemporaries. Heck, the way salaries are spiraling for the spiral-throwers, I could see the top QBs making $100 million annually by the 2030s.\n\nBest-selling author and nationally honored journalist Scott Pitoniak is the Rochester Business Journal sports columnist.
