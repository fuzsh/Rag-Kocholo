        "text": "I was born well past the ’80s, but I’ve had to live my whole 24 years of life hearing about “how great the ’80s were” from my parents.\n\nYou know, you get the whole “You just had to be there” lecture like you chose to not be born then, and then your mom talks about Dirty Dancing for the next four hours and how it’s the greatest movie of all time.\n\nWith that being said, this music video is about as ’80s as it gets…\n\nYou know, the sex-fueled heart throb songs with cheesy lyrics.\n\nWe’re talking about Diana Ross’s 1982 song, “Muscles.”\n\nThe video is filled with a bunch of ripped dudes rolling around in Speedos, as Ross intensely looks out the window like she’s about to growl at you if you stare too long.\n\nHowever, one of the guys in the video looks incredibly familiar, but I couldn’t put my finger on it…\n\nAnd then it hit me.\n\nIt’s no other than Gil Birmingham, who plays Thomas Rainwater, the Tribal Chairman for the Native American reservation in Yellowstone.\n\nBy the looks of it, it appears that Birmingham had more aspirations to be Arnold Schwarzenegger than a famed actor, but this might very well be his first ever acting role.\n\nNeedless to say, he probably made the right choice, because he’s had a number of big roles over the past few years, like in Taylor Sheridan’s movies Wind River and Hell or High Water, and also Yellowstone.\n\nNevertheless, it’s still hilarious to watch Birmingham roll all over Diana Ross in this cheesy ’80s music video.\n\nYellowstone’s Gil Birmingham Jams Cover Of Stevie Ray Vaughan’s “Pride & Joy”\n\nThomas Rainwater can pick.\n\nGil Birmingham is an accomplished actor who’s primarily known for his role as Tribal Chairman Thomas Rainwater in the Paramount Network’s television series Yellowstone.\n\nHowever, you can find him in other Taylor Sheridan projects including Wind River, Hell or Highwater, as well as in the Twilight Saga, and more.\n\nBut he also knows his way around the guitar.\n\nBack in 2010, at the Native American Music Awards, Gil joined New York blues picker Jimmy Wolf for a cover of Stevie Ray Vaughan’s “Pride & Joy.”\n\nAnd he crushed it.\n\nReleased in 1983, “Pride & Joy” was the lead single from SRV’s 1983 album, Texas Flood."
