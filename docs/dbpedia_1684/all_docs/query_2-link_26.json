        "text": "WELCOME to today’s episode of Cub Tracks news and notes™, a greatest-hits collection of Chicago-style beat writers and bloggers, ground from #Cubs, #MiLB, and #MLB baseball, overheated, steeped in writers’ tears, and then cold-brewed overnight for maximum flavor. No artificial intelligences were deployed, employed, entranced, or embalmed in the commission of this manuscript (apparently I might be training some though). Cub Tracks eagerly awaits the advent of robotic umpires and has already amended the three laws. The going is weird. Cub Tracks turned pro a long time ago.\n\nCub Tracks. Where the great ones run away.\n\nAre big things on the horizon for the Cubs? It’s hard to say. In any case, there is movement — three players who everyone here knows have leveled up, the team is playing well and only need to play .600-something ball for the rest of the season to have a shot at October.\n\nThey started the stretch drive a little later than in 2023 — that may cost them. This group isn’t good enough to turn it on only when it counts but that’s how they seem to operate. I suspect they’re just passing gas in a wind tunnel but hey! Stranger things have happened. Let’s be positive until the math rules it out.\n\nIn this series, the Cubs will be facing the Minnesota Twins, a pretty good club. David Festa (1-2, 6.98) represented the Twins and Kyle Hendricks (3-9, 6.86) was on the hill for the North Siders in their home park, venerable Wrigley Field.\n\nBoth starters threw zeroes until the top of the third, when a Royce Lewis sacrifice fly opened the scoring. Manuel Margot lined one deep to left for their second tally in the top of the fifth.\n\nThat was more than enough. The offense took a nap. Kyle’s good effort was wasted.\n\n*means autoplay on, (directions to remove for Firefox and Chrome). {$} means paywall. {$} means limited views. Italics are often used on this page as sarcasm font. The powers that be have enabled real sarcasm font in the comments.\n\nTony Andracki (Marquee Sports Network*): ‘Everybody knows the stakes’: Big series has rekindled some hope for Cubs. “... October is a longshot for the North Siders.” Miscues become learning experiences. Kyle Williams has more of this.\n\nJordan Campbell (Cubbies Crib*): Holding out hope for a Cubs 2024 postseason berth is falling for Jed Hoyer’s trap. “... let’s have a real conversation about the importance of being a serious fans.”\n\nBrett Taylor (Bleacher Nation*): Cubs playoff odds check and the volume of winning required. “A .536 winning percentage gets you 87 wins on the season.”\n\nMaddie Lee (Chicago Sun-Times*): New Cub Nate Pearson’s development could be team’s most compelling storyline down the stretch. “The Cubs acquired Pearson from the Blue Jays at the deadline because of the unlocked potential they saw.”\n\nTony Andracki (Marquee Sports Network*): One big difference in the Cubs offense from 2023 to 2024. “One difference between this year and last year is our lineup has felt more shallow,” Jed Hoyer said last month.\n\nJordan Campbell (Cubbies Crib*): Chicago Cubs shouldn’t waste an opportunity with fast-rising prospect. “While the free-agent options for catcher are nothing to write home about, the Cubs have a prospect quickly ascending their rankings...”\n\nJordan Bastian (MLB.com*): The key to Busch’s consistent rookie year? ‘No panic’. “Offensively, he’s just been consistent,” Cubs manager Craig Counsell said.\n\nSahadev Sharma (The Athletic {$}): Cubs’ Pete Crow-Armstrong is starting to tap into his considerable offensive talent. “It’s reps and better matchup history,” Crow-Armstrong said.\n\nMeghan Montemurro (Chicago Tribune* {$}): Cody Bellinger’s throwing is still limited by finger injury and Seiya Suzuki is out of the Chicago Cubs lineup with neck stiffness. “Bellinger... feels the discomfort in the finger when making throws with intent.”\n\nTony Andracki (Marquee Sports Network*): Seiya Suzuki is turning in another late-season surge for Cubs. “Over his career, August and September/October represent his two best months in terms of batting average, slugging percentage and OPS.” Andy Martinez has more Suzuki.\n\nAndy Martinez (Marquee Sports Network*): Cubs promote trio of top prospects to Triple-A. “Outfielder Kevin Alcántara and infielders Matt Shaw and James Triantos are all being promoted...” More from Jake Misener. Tommy Birch has the last word.\n\nFood for Thought:"
