        "text": "With the release of her latest album, Hummingbird, behind her, and a tour sure to be looming, Carly Pearce sat down with Evan Paul on Taste of Country Nights: On Demand to talk about what's next.\n\nIt won't necessarily be more music – at least, not only music. When asked if she would ever consider acting, the \"Truck on Fire\" singer perked up.\n\n\"I would love to get into acting,\" she says assuredly. \"It's definitely something ... hosting and acting, are kind of things that I'm really interested in and really into, so, for sure.\"\n\nPearce has a charming personality, a good sense of humor and impeccable timing, so hosting makes sense and is something she does well. She'll return to host ACM Honors for her fourth consecutive year in 2024, and this time, she’s sharing the spotlight with Jordan Davis.\n\nIt's not too far-fetched that Pearce might end up on a show or a movie, either, with her growing name recognition.\n\nWith artists like Lainey Wilson on Yellowstone and Darius Rucker all but begging to be on the show, too, there could be a window of opportunity here for Pearce to take her career to the next level."
