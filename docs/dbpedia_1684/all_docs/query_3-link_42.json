Amazon survived the dot-com bubble. The Great Recession gave us Uber and Airbnb.\n\nAt this rate, 2024 will be a banner vintage for funds to invest in startups. These young companies have weathered an economic meltdown, a bank collapse, and the biggest platform shift in technology since cloud computing.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nTo identify which startups have a head start on success, we asked venture capitalists from firms such as Accel, GV, Founders Fund, Greylock, Harlem Capital, IVP, and Khosla Ventures, as well as managers of newer and boutique funds, to name this year's most promising startups. We asked investors to put forward one portfolio company and one startup in which they have no financial ties.\n\nThe year's biggest themes were data infrastructure, security, and personalized agents as every startup, from a clinician's scribing solution to tax software, confronts how to grow and flourish in an age of AI-everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbridge: AI transcription for doctors and providers\n\nStartup: Abridge\n\nRecommended by: Marisa Bass, Primary Venture Partners; Shravan Narayen, IVP\n\nRelationship: Primary has no financial interest in Abridge. IVP is an investor in Abridge.\n\nTotal funding: $212.5 million\n\nWhat it does: Abridge's generative AI tech transcribes patient-doctor interactions and documents those visits in electronic health records.\n\nWhy it's on the list: In February, Abridge raised a $150 million Series C round to continue developing its tech and relieve clinicians' administrative burdens as healthcare's labor crisis continues. Narayen and Bass highlighted Abridge's partnership with EHR giant Epic, which could help the startup gain more traction with hospitals this year.\n\n\"Abridge has a lot of the necessary ingredients (capital, early commercial traction, strong ecosystem partners, high caliber team) to support provider workflows, help improve communication with patients while also serving as a scaled GenAI business, that could spur additional investment in the space,\" Bass said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAirbuds: allows you to share music with friends\n\nStartup: Airbuds\n\nRecommended by: Alexia Bonatsos, Dream Machine\n\nRelationship: Investor\n\nTotal funding: Not disclosed\n\nWhat it does: Airbuds allows you to ambiently share music with friends.\n\nWhy it's on the list: \"Gen Z especially finds identity in fandoms,\" said Bonatsos. \"Airbuds has built the beginnings of an interest-based social graph, and it's just getting started with music.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAir Space Intelligence\n\nStartup: Air Space Intelligence\n\nRecommended by: Renata Quintini, Renegade Partners\n\nRelationship: Investor\n\nTotal funding: $222.28 million, according to PitchBook\n\nWhat it does: AI-powered operating system for aerospace and defense\n\nWhy it's on the list: \"Their platform helps the world's most complex air operations make better, faster, and more data driven decisions,\" Quintini said. \"ASI had already established itself as the market leader with domestic airlines, working with several major US carriers in mission-critical capacities.\" The startup has also made progress this year toward \"larger scale deployments with the DoD,\" Quintini said, opening up a US-based engineering hub and hiring talent for this endeavor, she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAliveCor: helps people remotely manage their heart health\n\nStartup: AliveCor\n\nRecommended by: Alex Morgan, Khosla Ventures\n\nRelationship: Khosla is an investor in AliveCor.\n\nTotal funding: $350 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nWhat it does: AliveCor helps people remotely manage their heart health with connected devices like personal electrocardiograms.\n\nWhy it's on the list: In June, AliveCor launched its FDA-approved AI, which can detect 35 cardiac conditions including heart attacks. That AI will be powered by its new pocket-sized ECG to measure the electrical impulses of a patient's heart.\n\n\"Because the device is compact and easy to use, this new device can be used in places that don't already have ECG machines on hand, and in particular, will accelerate decision-making around heart attacks,\" Morgan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnrok: Automation software for sales tax compliance\n\nStartup: Anrok\n\nRecommended by: Amit Kumar, Accel\n\nRelationship: No financial interest\n\nTotal funding: $51.9 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nWhat it does: Anrok automates sales tax compliance for SaaS companies. It helps companies track where they have sales tax exposure and collect the right amounts from end customers during checkout. Anrok also helps companies file returns easily.\n\nWhy it's on the list: \"Anrok is following the classic API playbook; abstracting away a surprisingly complex yet necessary piece of infrastructure into its own layer,\" said Kumar. They're \"making it about as developer and user-friendly as possible.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAvian Labs: a global Venmo using stablecoins\n\nStartup: Avian Labs\n\nRecommended by: Seth Rosenberg, Greylock\n\nRelationship: No financial interest\n\nTotal funding: Unknown\n\nWhat it does: Global venmo using stablecoins.\n\nWhy it's on the list: \"It's an amazing real-world use case for crypto and a clean product,\" Rosenberg said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeatBread: allows independent artists to receive advances on their music income\n\nStartup: BeatBread\n\nRecommended by: Dan Kimerling, Deciens\n\nRelationship: Investor\n\nTotal funding: $134 million, according to the company\n\nWhat it does: BeatBread allows independent artists to receive advances on their music income from streaming and airplay and shop funding offers from investors, distributors, and indie labels.\n\nWhy it's on the list: BeatBread has provided over 1,000 advances to artists and indie labels over the past four years. It's now deepening its partner network with deals to provide small labels with more ways to fund artists and give artists more control over publishing.\n\nKimerling said it's an \"exhilarating period for the company,\" which uses machine learning to analyze and predict revenue potential for music rather than \"subjective artistic evaluations.\"\n\n\"This also puts the control back in artists' hands,\" he said, \"as it unbundles capital from services and enables artists to pick who they want to work with for all aspects of their business.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBraintrust: Infrastructure stack for enterprise AI\n\nStartup: Braintrust\n\nRecommended by: Shravan Narayen, IVP; Corinne Riley, Greylock\n\nRelationships: No financial interest; investor\n\nTotal funding: $8.3 million, according to PitchBook\n\nWhat it does: Braintrust is the infrastructure stack for enterprise AI products. The company helps enterprise customers through the AI development process, supporting with evaluations, logging, data management, and prompting. Braintrust also provides customers with access to top AI models via an API.\n\nWhy it's on the list: Braintrust is \"critical infrastructure for leading technology companies like Zapier, Coda, Airtable, and Instacart\" and \"boosts AI accuracy by over 30%,\" said Narayen.\n\n\"The founder and CEO Ankur Goyal is a second-time founder who sold his last company to Figma, where he then led AI,\" said Riley. \"The speed at which he and the team have shipped products and the mindshare they have developed amongst leading builders in the AI community is truly unique.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrowserbase: headless browsers for AI agents and applications\n\nStartup: Browserbase\n\nRecommended by: Vivek Ramaswami, Madrona, and Astasia Myers, Felicis\n\nRelationship: No financial interest\n\nTotal funding: $6 million, according to Pitchbook.\n\nWhat it does: Browserbase is a platform for running headless browsers at scale.\n\nWhy it's on the list:\n\n\"Everyone is talking about AI Agents, but in order for agents to actually be able to browse the web like a human, better infrastructure is required,\" said Ramawami. \"Browserbase is helping to build that infrastructure, revolutionizing a small, some might even say boring, technology with potentially massive implications.
