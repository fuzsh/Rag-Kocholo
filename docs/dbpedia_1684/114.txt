All I Do Is Win is a song by DJ Khaled featuring Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, T-Pain and Ludacris.

Background[]

In "The Junior Professor Solution", Howard sings along to the song as it plays in his earphones to annoy Sheldon, saying, "If you're going to be a crappy teacher, then I'm going to be a crappy student" after Sheldon trips him up by making him admit he's "a little fuzzy" on Euler Lagrange theorems. Sheldon rips the earphones out of Howard's ears after he begins rapping.

Lyrics[]

The Lyrics of the song Howard sings along to are

"All I do is win, win, win no matter what"

"Everybody's hands go up, up, and they stay there"

"Ungh, ungh, Ludacris going in on the verse, 'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now"

Trivia[]

"All I do is win win win no matter what, Got money on my mind

I can never get enough

And every time I step up in the buildin'

Everybody hands go up"
