The first part of this definition identifies the nation with the group formed by the citizens of an independent realm or republic; the latter part telis us that there is usually more to it than merely citizenship. The last item seems to imply that in most countries the citizens think that they have, in addition to the common traits enumerated, something in common which they do not share with citizens of any other country. The “feeling” itself would not be different in different coun¬ tries. In each individual, it is the consciousness of belonging to a unit which comprises the same human beings as the political unit called “the nation”, but it has an emotional value of its own, being another aspect of the same entity, associated with certain incentive ideas. Which are these ideas? They are probably reflections on such constituents of national community as are mentioned in the latter part of the definition. Community of race is associated in the consciousness of the in¬ dividual with the interminable chain of descent, and this thought may give him a dizzying impression of belonging to a family of hundreds of millions of blood-relations, even if he should be a childless adopted citizen of the country. Such is the structure of the human mind, rational and irrational at the same time. This feeling of belonging to a unity is a fact in itself. The common race, customs, historical traditions, and the like, may be mere fictions, without detriment to the feeling of unity. The Zionists know this. In newly founded Israel, which is—as has been said—not a melting-pot, but a pressure-cooker, they have a simple criterion to decide who is a Jew, and who is not. Anybody is a Jew, if he pretends to be. There are more comprehensive defmitions, for instance: “[a large group of human beings] with community of descent, bodily structure, character, fatherland, language, culture, religion, judicial System, customs, government and historical traditions” (f. a. von scheele). This is an almost complete enumeration of relevant factors, and if we do not give an exceedingly wide or vague interpretation to the term community, we may say that any large group that has all these charaeI — 567994 A. Campbell\n\nI\n\ntcristics, is a nation. But fathcrland, judicial systcm, govcrnmcnt and historical traditions cannot bc kcpt apart from citizcnship, evcn if thc old Jewish merchant in Sigfrid Siwertz’ novcl “Det stora varuhusct” thought tliat for him the history of Sweden began on thc day when he was shipwrecked at Svenska hogarna. Religion is not important in this conncction, even if there are national churches and national crceds. As to culture, members of the educatcd upper class form a unity ali over thc Western world, whereas they have comparativcly little in common with the proletarians of their rcspective countries, as portrayed in Werner Sombart’s classic “Das Prolctariat”. The “customs” come under the same heading, to a considcrable extent. It will appear, then, that thc second defmition does not differ substantially from the first. Thus, the feeling of having something in common is the same wherever it occurs, and it does not seem to matter much xvhat people think they have in common or whether their opinion is well-founded or not. It is safe to say that the only tliing the citizens of a country must have in common in order to form a nation, is the idea of having something in common that is worth while. This feeling is not different from what members of other human groups fcel for their respectivc community. Such a feeling may be both elevated and strong, because it is nurtured by the instinct for self-prcservation without letting the egotism of the individual come to thc surface; it is sublimatcd sclf-interest. But the instinct for self-preservation does not become active until it is challenged. The challcnge need not appear in the shape of actual overt menaee. A feeling of antagonism will meet the case. And here we are confronted with a rnental trait that seems to distinguish Homo sapiens from all the other animals. Hawks will not pick out hawks’ eyes, and a wolf does not attack a brother-wolf except if he is starved and the smell of blood pricks his nose. If the great plan of Nature implies that Life shall be preserved forever in every single species, then one may feel tempted to regard mankind as an animal species that has gone wrong, forgetful of the eternal commandment of Nature. In all parts of thc animal kingdom the struggle of life seems to be a struggle for thc perseverance of the species. In the community of beasts it is not thc reckless law of bellum omnium in omnes that prevails, but the law of mutual aid.1 Apart from the pairing-time contests, which are rarely fatal, it looks as if only the domestic ani¬ mals, dcgencratcd through the machinations of Man, could be baited to destructive mutual fight. On the other hand, nothing seems to be easier, as far as historical expericnce goes, than to pester groups of human beings to meaningless battles against each other. It seems that most human groups keep together because of their opposition to other groups, and worse than that, it looks as if antagonism wcre regarded as an end in itself or as if it were duc to an instinct. This antagonism commands a whole scale of sentiments, from a chivalrous spirit of emulation to frantic venomous hatred. Sometimes the antagonism is rooted in rivalling interests, but often it floats in the air. The effects of this instinct can be traced even to the innocent plays of the children. In thc school-yards the classical and thc non-classical fight each other. In the encampments infantrymen and troopers manhandle each other to their hearfs content. We meet the same spectacle everywhere and at every epoch: with the Red faction and the Green faction in the antique Circus, with Guelfs and Ghibellines, with Big-endians and Little-endians.2\n\n1\n\nPeter Krapotkin,\n\nMutual Aid.\n\n2\n\nJonathan Swift,\n\nGulliver’s Travels.\n\nThe chief stimuli of patriotism are feelings of contrast. One is static: the feeling of superiority towards the neighbours, who are labclled without distinction as “barbars” (barharoi) or “peoples” (,goyim). I once said to a French lady: “You seenr to think that Paris is the Alpha and the Omega of the world.’ And she answered: “But of course it is!” The other stimulus is dynamic: the indignation against aggressors or suppressors. “L'amour sacre de la patrie” gets red-hot only when it is fanned by passionate antagonism: Allons, enfants de la patrie! Le jour de gloire est arrive! Contre nous de la tyrannie\n\n1’etandard sanglant est leve! Entendez-vous dans les campagnes mugir ces feroces soldats? Iis viennent jusque dans nos hras egorger nos fis, nos compagnes.\n\nThe Marseillaise was conceived at the frontier, when the fatherland was threatened from within and without. The Star-Spangled Banner, though mirroring a more serene atmosphere, was written within the range of British naval guns. Where neither of these factors is strong enough in itself, they may be supplied by public instruction and patriotic literature. The latter remedy is well known from the reign of Augustus. In the U.S.A. the chief aim of the schools is to create good American citizens. One may say that in its natural state and under normal peaceful conditions, a rural population has no idea of belonging to a nation. Take the inhabitants of the parish of Kokar in the Aland archipelago! They are, since 1809, Swedish-speaking citizens of Finland. But in their own opinion they are neither Finns, nor Swedes, nor Swedish Finlanders, nor Alanders—they are just Kokar people and nothing else. Let us return for a moment to the definition of nation. Is it true that a common judicial system makes for national unity? The answer would he that if all the classes of the population approve of the judicial system, it contributes to national unity, but if it favours one class and the other classes are opposed to it, then it is the other way around. This is what coined, in confornrity to a passage in\n\nPlato’s\n\nDisraeli\n\nhad in mind when he\n\ndialogue “The State”, the famous expression “the\n\ntwo nations”. The study of national character is an undisciplined branch of research. There are so many sources for error in this field that some scholars have been induced to reject the whole notion a limine.1 And yet there is no denying that the average mental attitude is different in different countries. To put it in the nomenclature of the behaviourists, people do not react in the same way to the same stimuli all over the world. The first thing to do in order to get a grip of Proteus-shaped National Character would be to seclude from the notion of nation the notion of national consciousness (German Nationalbeumsst-\n\n1\n\nHamilton Fyfe, The Illusion of National Character, London, 1940.\n\n3\n\nse in), which we have dcalt with alrcady. And in ordcr to avoid begging thc question (petitio principii), we may substitute regional character for national character and put thc question:\n\nDoes the population of a given arca rcact in a certain way to ccrtain stimuli, in contradistinction to the populations of other areas? And if this is so, how should it be cxplained? Nothing has contnbuted more to discredit this branch of research than the doctrine of the superiority of the Nordic racc. Inaugurated by Count Chamberlain\n\nGobineau,\n\npropagated by\n\nHouston Stuakt\n\nin his book “Die Grundlagen des ncunzehnten Jahrhunderts”, this doctrine was\n\nadopted in a simplified form by Gcrman political writers in the twenties and thirties of this century to ciear thc way for imperialistic ambitions. The Germans may have deserved all the praise these writers spent on them, except the honour of representing the Nordic race. The claim of superiority, unwarrantcd in itself, was unduly vindicated for a population that has only a small share in the vaunted Nordic heritage. The current notion of racc is most useful in dcaling with sub-groups of horses and dogs and other animals, which display a relatively uniform psychical pattern, but it tends to evaporate when applied to the manifold hurnan psychc.1 If the reader objects to the term “psychical” as used in connection with animals, I would like to say that it is impossible to maintain\n\nDescartes’\n\ndoctrine that Man has a soul and the animals\n\nare mere machines. One may stick to thc doctrine that Man is a machine, but if we assume that the actions of human beings are rulcd by ideas, it does not make good sense to think that the brain of other mammals, bcing of the same structure as the human brain, should not produce any kind of ideas. If we assume, on the other hand, that our own ideas, thoughts, feelings and volitions are mere epiphenomena without the slightest bearing upon our actions, then we must admit that no argument is conclusive, because we cannot chcck the physical and chemical processes that gave birth to it. Even the argument I am putting forward now must be taken for granted on the general assumption that convincing arguments are always confirmed by experience, although everybody knows that this assumption does not hold good. If the notion of race easily lends itself to abuse when applied to regional character, we ought not to go to the opposite extreme and exclude the biological factors altogether. In contemporary psychology there is a tendency to disregard all innate difierences between human individuals. And yet it is not true, from a qualitative point of view, that all men are born alike. Sonic people have a gift for mathematies, some people can hear absolute musical piteh, some people are excecdingly swift in putting on the brakes.\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe\n\nthought that Negroes had a remarkably\n\nkeen sense for arts and music. Such generalizations may be true or false—but they should not be rejected a priori. The argument that the mental differences between the nations of Europe cannot be due to racial factors because you find the same race components in all the European countries, is not conclusive. Granted that most of the national characteristics are due to milieu and education—the question is whether racial differences play no role at all. Granted that the same races are represented in Nor way and in Rumania—but the proportions are essentially different. 1\n\nEverybody knows, though, that there are marked\n\nindividual differences of bchaviour within one and the same race of dogs, and some naturalists think that among\n\n4\n\nants of a given species certain individuals are distinguished by cleverness and altruism. (G. Adlerz, Myrornas liv.)\n\nThere is no doubt that race psychology has much to yield, provided that the research work is done sine ira et studio.1 Another discrediting feature of traditional research on national character is the romantic doctrine of language and nationality, preconized by upheld in our days by\n\nLeo Weisgerber.\n\nHerder,\n\nelaborated by\n\nWilhelm von Humboldt\n\nand\n\nIn its extreme form, this doctrine includes three theses:\n\n1. The ideas, and to some extent even the logic, of each human individual are determined by the vocabulary and the structure of his vernacular. 2. Any language is a crystallization of the mental character of the speaking community. 3. The mental character of the speaking community is an outflow of its racial composition. In this context we cannot dwell upon the fallacies and the inconsistency of the Humboldtian doctrine. Be it enough to say that there is something to it none the less. In politics, foreign and domestic, as in everyday lifc we feel a practical need for sweeping generalizations about our fellow-creatures. It cannot be expected from occasional visitors of foreign countries that they should resist this temptation. And much of the material for research in national character consists of itineraries. Therefore we greet with no small expectations the new school of regional characterology represented by\n\nRalpii Linton.\n\nThe use of questionnaires will mark a new\n\nepoch even in this field. But it should not bc forgotten that the Gallup method has its shortcomings. To some extent it implies that people should analyse themselves, which they are often incapable of doing. If we take patriotism, which is obviously a feature of national character, it can¬ not be doubted that in the late twenties a Gallup inquiry would have yielded the resuit that progressive-minded Oxford university alumns were no good patriots. It turned out ten years later that they did everything that might be expected from fervent patriots, and more than that. As to the factors that determine national character, I must restrict mysclf this time to quoting the following passage from an essay which I published twenty years ago:2 “Without denying the influence which the average inherited somatic characteristics or the surrounding nature or the historical experience may exercize upon the intcllectual and emotional habitus of a people, one is entitled to say that the character of a people usually emanates from a social stratum that sets the fashion, spreading their conceptions and values, the leading ideas. Through education the individual is influenced by these current norms, so that those dispositions which conform to the norms are favoured and cultivated, whilst the reverse dispositions are kept back and repressed. “If research on national character starts from this principle and keeps to it, then it will move alongside with other branches of research that deal with Man as a social being-—mAmxov. 1\n\nIt is a pity that there is no English translation of Rolf\n\nNordenstreng’s Europas manniskoraser och folkslag, 3rd\n\n2 “Folklynnesforskningens\n\nfelkallor”, in:\n\nNorrbotten\n\n(Lulea), 1936.\n\ned., Stockholm, 1926.\n\n5\n\nIrish Farmyard Types\n\nCAOIMHIN 6 D AN AC H AIR DUBLIN\n\n1 he fundamental nced of shelter froni thc elements and protcction during the hours of darkncss is doublcd for the farmer, who must provide shelter and protcction for his livcstock, his gear and his harvestcd crops as well as for himself and his family; thc type of shelter which he provides is influenced not only by his traditional methods of using building materials but also by thc type of husbandry in which he engages, the local conditions of soil and climate, and his own social and economic position in thc community. The climate of Ireland is mild and moist. The average January temperatures range from 40° to 440 F. over the whole country, while those of July range from 570 to 6o°, and the average annual rainfall over five-sixths of the country is from 30 to 50 inches, with from 175 to 250 days on which some rain falis. Heavy snow, great cold or long continued frosts are very exceptional, as are long droughts or great heat. In such a mild climate hay and unthreshed corn may be stored outdoors in ricks or stacks, and this was the usual method of storage in Ireland until quite rccently; it stili is the usual method on many farms. Other crops, such as potatoes and roots, and even grain and apples wcre, in many parts of Ireland, stored outdoors in suitable pits or containers; this, too, is stili often done in the case of potatoes. Consequently storage space for the harvested crops was not the most urgent of the farmcr’s building needs. Again, the mildness of the climate permits the keeping in the open throughout the ycar of certain kinds of livcstock, such as sheep and dry cattle, while on thc other hand milking cows must be kcpt indoors during the winter and early spring. Thus it may be said that, in general, the size and form of an Irish farmyard depends upon the number of milking cows kcpt by the farmer. Although, in Ireland, thc raising of crops, especially of grain crops, was neither small in volume or unimportant in rural cconomy, it was in most times and places sccondary to cattlebreeding, stock-raising and dairying. The evidcncc of archaeology and history rcveals the importance of cattle from a very early date down to our own time; even yet, in many parts of the country a man’s wealth is reckoned not by the size of his farm but by the number of his cattle, and thc area of a farm is commonly reckoned by the number of cattle which it will support—“the grass of ten cows’’ is stili a familiar term. Farms are generally classified as small, medium or large, according to their area. A farm of less\n\n6\n\nthan 30 statute acres is regarded as small, one of from 30 to 100 acres as of medium size and one of over 100 acres as large. Small, medium and large farnis may be found in ali parts of Ireland, but in the provinces of Lcinster and Munster and in parts of south cast Connaught there is a preponderance of medium sized farnis with, especially in north Lcinster, a considerablc proportion of large farnis.1 Ali this area practises mixed farming, but the south Western province, Munster, is complctcly dominated by the milking cow, while in Lcinster the northern lialf is mainly devoted to the raising of beef cattle, and the Southern half produces considerable quantities of wheat, oats and barley.2 In most areas of Connaught and Ulster, the Western and northern provinces, the average farni is of small size, and the number of cows kept by each farmer corrcspondingly small; the value and productivity of these small farnis, however, vary greatly from the intensive cultivation of many farnis in east and south Ulster to the fisher-farmer economy of the west Coastal distriets.3 Throughout the provinces of Lcinster and Munster, and in parts of east Connaught, that is to say, gencrally in the area of medium and large farnis, the predominant, and in many distriets exclusive, farmyard type is the courtyard, in which the dwelling house and outhouses are arranged about a rectangular space which is the farmyard proper. Most usually the buildings forni three sides of the yard, with the dwelling house forming one side and the outhouses forming two more, the fourth side being closed by a wall with a gate. Usually the building is not continuous, the elements being separate and connectcd by walls, or having gateways or passages betwecn them. The size and arrangement of the yard and the various buildings vary from one farni to another, and also from district to district; the general type is, however, well established, and conforms to a pattern which is clearly distinguishcd from the other types to bc described later. In many distriets the front of the dwelling house faces the farmyard, thus, in Co. Kildare in 1807: “The farmhouses in general consist of a long thatehed building of one storey, consisting of a large kitehen and fireplace in the centre, and lodging rooms at cither end; the front door looks to the barns and stables on the right, behind which is the haggard, and on the left are placed the cow and bullock houses.” This, written a century and a half ago,4 exactly describes many of the farmyards of to-day, for example that shown in fig. 1, which has the dwelling house in the middle, the cowhouse, calfhouse and a small store (formerly a dairy) 011 the left, with the manurc heap behind them, while on the right are the stable, another store and the pigstye, with the haggard, wherc the hay and corn stacks are made, behind them. The fourth side is formed by a stone wall, with a gate; this wall fronts on the public roadway. This farmyard is at Duncormick, Co. Wexford, in the south east corner of Ireland, but similar examplcs may be found in almost every part of the east and south. Figure 2 shows the buildings on a larger farni, also in Co. Wexford. Here the entrance gate leads in between a cart shed on the right and the dairy 011 the left, with the pump close by. Facing the dwelling house across the yard are the stable and byre and a store, while the corn barn opens into the haggard. The pigsty and manure heap are in the part of the yard most distant from the dwelling house. The openings between the various buildings are closed by stone walls about\n\n1 Agricultural Statistics, 1847-1926.

A door in the back of thc dwelling housc lcads into a garden and orchard. In both dicse examples thc front of thc dwelling housc is towards thc yard, but in very many examples thc back of thc dwelling housc is towards thc yard, which is rcachcd by a back door, while thc front of thc housc faces a small garden with flowcrs and fruit trees through which a path lcads to the front door. This is especially common in cast Munster. Figurc 3 shows thc buildings on a smallcr farni in thc south-castern part of Co. Galway. Here again wc have a courtyard formed by buildings on three sides and a stone wall with a gate on thc fourth, but thc courtyard is dividcd into two parts by another wall which protects the portion in front of the dwelling house, which is a little garden with flowers and shrubs, from thc animals which pass through thc yard. In thc smallcr farnis of thc north and west there usually are fcwcr buildings, and these are often joincd together in one continuous row, as in thc example shown in figurc 4, 011 a small farni in Co. Tyronc, where dwelling housc, stable, byre and a storc forni one long block of buildings. Here, the elements are clcarly distinguished from each other—thc byre and stable are more roughly built, with poorer roof timbers and thinner walls, than the dwelling house, while the storc at the other end is narrower than the dwelling house and has a lower roof. Indeed most examples of this well-known and widespread type have the dwelling house clearly distinguishable from the outhouses; thus they must not be confused with the “long-house” of Wales, of which the distinctive feature is internal communication bctween the byre and the dwelling.1 In contrast to this, there is no such internal communication in this Irish type, as each house, stable, byre, store and so on has its own entrance door, and very often the dwelling house and byre do not adjoin, but have a stable, store or dairy bctween them. But, as we shall see below, there is—or was until recently—a primitive forni of the “long house” or combined dwelling house and cattle byre to be found in certain parts of Ireland. Another farmyard forni to be found in parts of the north and west, and especially in the hili districts and peninsulas of west Munster, is shown in fig. 5. Here the outhouses are built in one continuous row, and placcd a short distance away from, and parallel to, the dwelling house; the space between the dwelling house and the outhouses serving not only as a yard but also as a passage betwccn the public road and the farmer’s fields; this yard or passage is, in many districts, called thc “street”. In addition to these various farmyard types, there may be found farnis in which the buildings are not arranged in any sct plan, but are scattered about in a haphazard fashion, sometimes without any yard; these occur but rarely in fertile lowlands but are not infrequent in mountain and moorland localities, such as parts of the Kcrry mountains. It cannot be doubtcd that the System of having separate compartments or buildings for thc dif¬ ferent kinds of animals and Stores is of considerable antiquity in Ireland. The law tract Crith Gabh-\n\nlach, written about\n\na.d.\n\n700, States that thc bo-aire febhsa (a ccrtain grade of land owner) must have,\n\nin addition to his dwelling house and a sharc in a corn-mill, a kiln, a barn, a sheep-fold, a pigsty and a calf-pen.2 Another ancient law tract3 refers to five “houses”, namely, dwelling house, cow1 Peate, I. C.: The Welsh House, 1940, chapter iv. 2 Ancient Laws of Ireland, vol. iv, Dublin, 1879, 309.\n\n12\n\n3 Ancient Laws of Ireland, vol. v, Dublin, 1901, 515.\n\nhouse, pigsty, calf-pen and sheepfold,\n\nO\n\nand thcrc arc several othcr references in thc ancicnt law tracts to cow-houses and pigstyes. But,\n\nnotwithstanding this old and\n\nvaried farmyard tradition, it is also quite ciear that there was, up to the beginning of the present century, a widespread custom of keeping the livestock, or part of it, in the dwelling house. There are very many references to this in descriptions of life and conditions in the seventeenth,\n\neighteenth\n\n1ZZA\n\nand nineteenth\n\nVZZy\n\ncenturies. Few, however, give any description of the internal arrangement of the houses, or the reason for the custom, and usually the accounts refer to small houses and a few poor animals. Some\n\nFig. 10 House at Doolough, Co.

Another traveller writes of a night spent in a house in west Co. Galway: “I had just compos’d myselfe to slcepe when I was strangely surprised to heare the cows and sheep ali comeing into my bed chainber. I enquired the meaneing and was told it was to preserve them from the wolfe which everie night was rambling about for prey.”2 Another and much later writer describes a night spent in a small house in the Kerry mountains, near Kenmare: “In the house where I slept—as mdeed in every house of the same character in the county—the whole stock of the family, consisting chiefly of cows and sheep, were locked in at night. Such was the extreme poverty of the people that they would not otherwise be safe. ... There was a slight partition between the room where my bed was and the kitehen where there were three cows, a man, his wife and four children.”3 In many dwelling houses fowl, especially hatching hens, were kept in special coops or boxes, and it was quite usual to have weak or sickly young animals, or calves or lambs which for some reason were separated from their dams, in the kitehen where they had warmth and attention until strong enough to be put with the other animals. In many parts of Ireland the poorest people— 1 Fynes Moryson: Itinerary, 1617.\n\n3 Doheny, M.: The Felon’s Track.\n\n2 Dunton, John: Letter 110. 2 (1699), in MacLysaght,\n\nE.: Irish Life in the Seventeenth Century, 1939, 339. 13\n\nthose who had littlc or no land—commonly kept their animals in thc dwclling housc (which oftcn had only one room) at night, a cow or two, or perhaps a donkcy or pony, a pig or a goat and a fcw hcns, thc largcr animals ticd to pcgs or rings sct in thc walls, thc smaller in coops or boxes. In many houses, cvcn large farmhouses, a spccial coop or pcrch was providcd for thc cock, whosc crowing scrvcd to call thc pcoplc of thc housc in thc morning. A vivid dcscription of thc housing conditions of a remote and isolatcd community in the sccond half of thc ninctccnth century is given by\n\nTomas\n\nO\n\nCrohan,\n\nwriting about the Blasket Islands off thc coast of Co. Kcrry in thc\n\nextreme south wcst: “There was a coop beside the partition with hcns in it, and a hatching hen in an old pot ncarby. At night a cow or two, a calf or two, an ass, two dogs ticd to the wall or loose about the housc. ... the two or three dogs would lic at the foot of the bed, the cow or two cows below them, tethered to the wall, the calf or two with the run of the kitehen and their muzzles in the firc. The ass was tied on the side of the house opposite the cows, and a cat with a couple of kittens in the fireplace niche ... And as well as all thc other animals you might find a pet lamb or two about thc house.”1 The custom of bringing the cattle into thc dwclling house for milking during the period of the year when they are kept outdoors, as well as keeping them in the dwelling house during the winter period is recorded from Co. Kerry.2 Indeed it is quite ciear that, throughout the west and north of Ireland, the keeping of livestock in their small dwclling houses by the poorer pcople was quite a common practice up to the last years of the nincteenth century, and in houses from which the animals have long been ejccted we may stili see the rings or pegs to which they used to bc tied. There was, however, one type of house which was built and arranged as a dwelling for both pcople and animals, and which was stili in use in the early years of the present century in parts of Connaught and Ulster, that is, in west Co. Galway, Co. Mayo, west Co. Sligo and wcst and north Co. Donegal. Figure io shows the plan of a typical specimen, atDoolough, Co. Mayo. This house is 12 m long and 5.5 m wide, built of stone and mortar and roofed with straw or grass thateh. It consists of two apartments, thc smaller being a bedroom and the larger a kitchen-livingroomcattle byre; the two apartments separated by the wall of the hearth. On one side of the hearth is a bed alcove. Two Windows, one in each room and both on one side—the front—of the house, give light, and there are two doors, one in the front of the house and one in the back, placed directly opposite each other. On the farther side of thesc doors from the fire an open drain extends from side to side of the house; this drain is about 50 cm wide and 25 cm deep and is lined with flat stones. The space betwecn this drain and the end wall of the housc is the byre, and here, during the winter, three or four cows were kept tethered to the wall. The drain passed under the wall and led to the manure heap outside. Figure 11 shows the manner in which many of these houses were changcd during the last fifty years or so. A byre was built, attached to the house, as here, or quite apart from it. The drain was filled in, and a partition of wood, or, as here of canvas stretehed on a wooden frame, erected to enclosc the former byre which now became a bedroom. In many houses the partition was formed\n\n1\n\n6\n\nCrohan, TomAs: An tOileanach, chapter m.\n\n2 Campbell, Ake: “Irish Fields and Houses”, Bealoideas, v, 68-70.\n\n14\n\nor partly formed by one or more large pieces of furniture, such as a dresser and a cupboard or press. While recorded instances of this type are, as we ha ve seen, confmed to comparatively small areas of the west and north west, there is little doubt that identical or similar forms were once more widespread in Ulster, Connaught and parts of west Munster, where a strong folk-memory of the regular stalling of cattle in the lower end (the end farthest from the fire) of the kitchen stili exists, and where one common house type has the two opposite doors and the lower end cut off by a partition of light material, as in the reconstructed house shown in figure n. In Leinster and east Munster, in contrast to this, there is little or no tradition of cattle in the dwelling houses, and there is here a form of house in which the relative positions of the entrance door, hearth and hearth wall1 would make the bringing of a large animal, such as a cow, into the house very dif— ficult and in many cases quite impossible. A recent article has shown that while the dispersed settlenrent pattern now dominates almost the whole of Ireland, there were formerly, and to a little extent stili are, certain definite areas of village or group settlement type.2 This, however, does not mean that a distinctive type of farmyard pattern is to bc found in such groups or villages; on the contrary, the farmyard type in them is the same as that in the adjoining areas of dispersed settlement. Thus, the groups or villages of east Co. Galway and south Co. Kilkenny are formed of farmyards of the courtyard type, those of west Co. Kerry of the parallel type and those of west Co. Mayo and north and west Co. Donegal of the dwcllmg house-cum-byre type. The middle of the twentieth century sees the Irish farmyard, in common with many other elements of rural life, in a stage of transition. On many farnis new outhouses, especially new cattlebyres, are being built; in others new dwelling houses have been built, and the old dwelling houses refitted as byres, Stores or stables, thus quite changing the aspect of the farmyard. The dwellingcum-byre type of the north west has virtually disappeared, and in a few years will be no more than a memory; the extendcd type, in which dwelling house and outhouses form a long block of buildmgs is also disappearing. 1\n\n(3\n\nDanachair, Caoimhin: “Hearth and Chimney in\n\nthe Irish House”, Bealoideas, xvi, 102, 104.\n\n2 Flatres,\n\nP.:\n\n“L’Habitat\n\nAgricole\n\nAgglomere\n\nen\n\nIrlande”, Chronique Geographique des Pays Celtes, 1954, 112-24.\n\n15\n\nWattle and Straw Mat Doors in Ireland\n\nA. T. LUCAS DUBLIN\n\nIn the tourist and topographical litcrature of thc last century relating to Ireland there are references, generally from the more isolatcd or mountainous districts of the country, to the occurrencc on houses of the poorcr type of doors of wattlcwork. Information on this point is richly supplcmented by the archives of the Irish Folklore Commission which record a number of accounts of them from immediate oral tradition, the majority of which, we may assume, relate to the latter half of thc nineteenth century. It is proposed to examine here such data as we have about these doors and to suggest an interpretation of their ancestry. We may begin by presenting the evidcnce about them arranged geographically, including with it references to thc large straw mats which were usually used in conjunction with thc doors and which, on occasion, were used as doors by themselves:— ULSTER\n\nCounty Armagh Barony of Upper Fews:—\n\ni.\n\nParish of Killevy:—\n\n“The houses were generally built in ‘clachons’\n\nor clusters and had two doors or entrances which were closed up with bundles of sticks or hurdles, alternately, or as it answered to keep out the wind and rain.” 1838, but referring to earlier times.1\n\n2. “Every house here had two doors one time. ...

In assessing the former distribution of the type from the tourist literature and the records of the Irish Folklore Commission it must be borne in mind that both these sources tend to be deficient for certain areas. The early tourists followed wellbeaten tracks along the more picturesque Coastal regions while the Commission’s most intensive work has been carried out in the Western half of the country, particularly in the Irish-speaking districts where tradition and the traditional pattern of life have remaincd strongest. The consequence is that in this, as in many other aspects of traditional culture, we lack data from the whole Central area of the country. Moreover, the references to their existence by tourists and topographcrs are necessarily capricious and sporadic and it is suggestive that every district which has been intensively investigated by the Commission has produccd evidence of thcm. The area where we find them must, accordingly, be regardcd as a minimum, there being every reason to believe that proof of their wider extension would be forthcoming were our sources fuller. The construction of the door, to judge by the rather perfunctory dcscriptions which have come down to us, seems to vary in detail from place to place, especially during the latter part of our pcriod. There is, howevcr, one fundamental kind which appcars everywhcre: that made of wattles or basketry (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 31, 32, 34, 35, 40, 41, 48, 49, 50, 51, 55, 57, 59, 60, 61,\n\n24\n\n1 i.f.c.,\n\nMs. 862, pp. 442-443.\n\n2 i.f.c.,\n\nMs. 146,\n\n3 i.f.c.,\n\nMs. 777, pp. 429-430.\n\np.\n\n284.\n\n4\n\nHall,\n\nRev.\n\n1813, vol. 1,\n\np.\n\nJames.\n\n277.\n\nTour through Ireland. London,\n\n62).1 It is noteworthy that this is the type which is mentioned in most o£ the earlier accounts (1, 14, 15, 34, 35, 41, 51, 62) where it is usually described as “wicker” or “wickerwork”. Wickerwork is a thing of very characteristic appcarance and it would have been much more familiar to the average well-to-do tourist of the early nineteenth century than it would be to persons of the same social standing today. We may takc it, therefore, that when such persons said “wickerwork” they meant wickerwork and that they would not have so described the ropeand-bush doors at Killevy, Co. Armagh (2) or the furze ones at Dunquin, Co. Kerry (54). Reid, for instance, does not apply the term to the doors which he saw at Ballygawley, Co. Tyrone (17) although he telis us that “the interstices were filled with ropes of straw, workcd in after the manner of a basket”. The method of making, what we may call, the classic type of this door has been preserved in a number of reasonably cxplicit accounts (6, 9, 13,\n\nFig. 5. Straw Mat used with Wattle Door. Portacloy, Co. Mayo. (National Museum of Ireland.)\n\n48, 59). Four stout sticks in the round or lengths of bog timber were made into a rectangular frame the size of the door ope, the pieces being lashed together at the angles with rope of hemp or straw and, sometimes, most probably, withies were used for the purpose as well. An account from Kilmocomoge Parish, Co. Cork (48) describes a procedure in which only two timbers—those forming the vertical sides—were used in the construction of the frame, the cross members at top and bottom consisting of ropes of twisted withies or “gads” (fig. 2). When the frame had been completed a suitable number of longitudinal ribs of thick rods spaced across the width of the door was tied in place to the cross pieces at top and bottom. In the Kilmocomoge door, above, however, such tying was unnecessary since the ribs were held in position by having their ends passed through the gads. By using the vertical sides of the door and these ribs as a warp the door was completed by having a weft of small rods woven\n\n1 The numbers in brackets refer to the examples in the topographical list. 25\n\ntransversely across them over its whole length (fig. i). Every effort was made to keep tliis wcft as close as possible smee it is stated, with some exaggeration, fromKillaghteeParisii, Co. Donegal, that “the rods were so tightly woven that they would allow through neither wind nor rain” (13). In a few instanccs it is said that this door was hung on hinges (4, 31, 40) after the manner of an orthodox wooden door, even if these hinges were only made of plaited straw rope (40). On the other hand, it seems much more likely that in the majority of cases the door was not a fixture at ali but that it was put into and lifted out of the ope as required as was the practice in Glencolmcille, Co. Donegal (12). Normally, the doorway would Fig. 6. Brushwood Door (Scolpan)\n\nKerrY-\n\n011\n\nCowshed\n\nat\n\nTooreens, Co.\n\nhave been lcft\n\nopen\n\ndunng the day\n\nand when, at night, it was closed with the wicker door the latter would have\n\nbeen kept in place by a wooden bar across its centre the ends of which fitted into slots in the jamb walls, as in the case of the straw mat door in the Inishark and Inishbofm Islands, Co. Galway (20). It is obvious that, no matter how well made, a wicker door could never be windproof and to render it so a large straw mat the size of the door ope was always used inconjunction with it (fig. 5). In some cases this mat may have been fixed to the door itself as a liner (14, 15). So mounted it would have functioned most effectively although, sometimes, liable to be sodden by rain beating against the door. In most instances, however, we do not know how the mat was used, whether applied to the door, suspended independently behind it or propped standing against it, although from isolated accounts we can gather that all three methods were in use. If we regard the wicker door with its straw mat liner as the original type we can trace a number of departures from this orthodox form, some of which appear to have been brought about by the cxigencies of environment or by worscned economic circumstances, some by local experiment and some by decay of the traditional procedure. The most remarkable of these is the dis— appcarance of the wicker door itself, the straw mat alone discharging all the functions formerly fulfilled by both together. This is recorded, doubtfully, from Donegal (11, 12) and Fcrmanagh (16) and, certainly, from Galway (18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 27, 33),Mayo (37), Sligo (41), Cork (47) and Munster in general (42). When the mat was used alone it was, sometimes, hung on hooks, as in 26\n\nConamara (19), or pegs, as in thc Lough pr*\n\ny\n\nGill District, Co. Sligo (41), or by some means not specified, as in Munster (42); and sometimes it was held in a standing\n\n’\n\n.-\n\n.\n\n\"/•.\n\nM'?:■\n\n\"**\n\n-i\n\nc-\n\nv>V\n\nposition by a cross-bar, as in Inishark and Inishbofin, Co. Galway (20). It is possible that the absence of the wicker door in some or all of these localities may simply be due to the lack of supplies of willow or hazel rods to make it. A curious half-way stage towards modern conditions appears in the use of a normal wooden door in one ope and a straw mat in the other. It should be explained that in many regions of the west of the country the house is providcd with a doorway in each of the long sides, the doors being opposite each other, and that on the sheltered side kept more or less permanently open during the day, while that 011 the windy side is kept\n\nFig. 7. Brushwood Door (Scolpan) from Tooreens, Co. Kerry:\n\nclosed. In those cases where a wooden\n\nSide View.\n\ndoor was hung on one ope and a straw mat on the other, the former was used on the side facing the wind and the latter on the sheltered side. Sin ce the wooden door was hung on hook-hinges it was readily removable and the two doors could be changed about as the wind dictated. This practice has bcen recorded from Templecrone Parish, Co. Donegal (7) and from Conamara, Co. Galway (19). It is also interesting to note that even after the introduction of wooden doors the tradition of the use of the straw mats persisted. They were used to provide extra comfort by the exclusion of draughts and were, therefore, used on the windward door particularly. This late use of them has bcen recorded from the following counties: Galway (21, 26, 28, 29, 30), Mayo (39), Clare (44, 45) and Kerry (56). Another line of development of the wicker door and its straw mat liner resulted in the combination of the two to form a single whole sharing the characteristics of botli: the rigidity of the wicker door and windproof nature of the straw mat. This was achieved by making thc frame after the usual fashion but using straw rope for the weft instead of rods. An early instance of this technique is to be seen in Reid’s description of the doors at Ballygawley, Co. Tyrone, 1822 (17), and a later example in the account from Killevy Parish, Co. Armagh (2), recorded in 1948. The same type is, probably, to be seen in the fowl-house doors at Gweedore, Co. Donegal (5), while the wattle door with the interstices stufted with straw from Baslick Parish, Co. Roscommon (40) and the one from Iveragh Barony, Co. Kerry (55) having long grass woven among the sticks are other variants of the same thing. 27\n\nThe tradition of the wicker door itself seems to ha ve lingered on down almost to thc prescnt day in two distinet forms. One of these was the wickcr half-door mentioncd in the account from Cloghancely Parish, Co. Donegal (3). In many parts of Ireland the traditional house has its main doorway equipped with two doors, an inner full-sizc door which is normally kcpt open during the day and an outcr door, half thc height of thc inner one, which is kept inore or less pcrmanently elosed and which excludes ground draughts, keeps out straying fowl and domestic animals, con¬ fines young children within doors while, at thc same time, the open upper space supplcmcnts the functions of the Windows in admitting light and air. Bcsides the Donegal example, half-doors of wickcrwork have also becn recorded from Ballyvourney Parish, Co. Cork (49), and from Co. Armagh1 and were, doubtless, common enough elsewhere but, having been mistaken for impromptu makeshifts, escaped mention in our sources. The second form of thc final phase of thc tradition of the wattle door is a rough screen of branches, with or without a frame, which was chiefly used on sheds and outhouses in sonte of the more isolated districts until comparatively recent times. Recorded examples come from Killevy Parish, Co. Armagh (2), where branches of whins (furze) were held together by a straw rope; from the Glenamoy district, Co.Mayo (38), where mats of heather tied with straw rope were used; from Gorumna and Lettcrmullan Islands, Co. Galway (27), where bundles of furze were held together in a wooden frame; and from Dunquin Parish, Co. Kerry, where one account mentions “bushes or fern” (53) and another “branches of furze” (54) which a supplementary sketeh shows laced in herring-bone fashion in a wooden frame. In thc Barony of Iveragh, Co. Kerry, we find two late forms which are considerably less rough-and-rcady than any of thosejust mentioncd and which seem closer in type to the original wattle door. One, from Prior Parish, used on outhouses, has already been describcd in outline (58) (fig. 3). The other is from Kilcrohane Parish and, in August, 1955, the writer saw and recorded the making of a specimen which is, probably, thc last door of this kind to be made in the country. It was made for use in a cowshcd by Sean Fitzgerald who is also one of the very few men lcft who can stili make thc bog-fir ropes which were formerly so extensively used in rural Ireland. It closely resembled the Prior example and consisted of a mat of birch branches fastened together by four paired cross-pieces of timber, one pair near the top, the other near the bottom (fig. 6 & 4). The cross-pieces were made by splitting two lengths of ash branch in the round, about 3 feet long and 3 inches in diameter, into longitudinal halves. One length of this was placed on the ground and the birch branches spread across it in a layer, butts chiefly to one end, twigs to the other, the butt-ends forming the lower edge of the door, since they made a firmer and more substantial basc on which to stand it. The branches were tightly ropcd to the cross-piece at a distance of about a foot-and-a-half from the lower edge of the door. A second cross-piece was then fixed across the door at a distance of a foot-and-a-half from what was judged would be its upper edge. The door was then turned upside down and the remaining two timbers fixed across it opposite their fellows to which they were fastened by ropes passing round their ends (fig. 7). The lower edge was then trimmed to a straight line by chopping the butt-ends of the branches with a hatehet and the door was placed standing in the ope to ascertain the corrcct height of thc upper edge. This\n\n1 28\n\nInformation from T. G. F.\n\nPaterson,\n\nCurator, County Muscum, Armagh,\n\n1955.\n\nhaving bcen markcd, the upper edge was trimnaed with the hatchet to that level and the door was then ready for use. It was placed standing in the ope from the outside and held by a bar of wood across its centre the ends of which fitted into slots in the wall. The Irish term for this rude door was scolpdn, which was the name used in the district for the wattle doors proper when they were in use there. We ha ve now seen something of the distribution and variations of this peculiar type of primi¬ tive door in nineteenth century Ireland. Among the rack-rented tenantry of the mismanaged estates in the most depresscd districts of the country and among the miserable population of evicted families who had settled as squatters on bogs and commons we find even cruder substitutes for doors: baskets and bundles of straw, rushes or heather but these we may certainly dismiss as expedients forced upon the people by abject poverty and disregard as unrepresentative of any tradition. Are we to regard the wicker doors as similar expedients to be similarly dismissed? In the first place their wide distribution at once suggests that we cannot (fig. 9). They extend along the whole west and north of the country and, as we have already stated, there is reason to believe that their extension may have been much greater. Even as it is, however, it is large enough to suggest that they have their roots in a widespread tradition. In the second place they do not stand alone as the only instances of the use of wattlework in the nineteenth century traditional house. The large chimney hoods built over the fireplace were commonly made of a timber frame the spaces of which were filled with wattlework heavily plastered on both faces with clay. It is interesting to note that, as in the case of the wicker doors, straw rope or sugdn was sometimes substituted for the wattling, and plastered with clay in a similar fashion, the rope itself, in addition, being occasionally dipped in puddled clay before bcing woven into place.1 In some districts this hood was borne on a large beant running across the room from wall to wall and the spaces to each side of the chimney, between the beant and the end wall, were frequently formed into two diminutive lofts, little more than large shelves in size, which were used for the storage of various household articlcs. The floors of these lofts were often fornted of wattlework. A nrore definitely structural use of wattling appears in its use for partition walls of houses and examples of this have been recorded from a number of places, e. g.:—“Another method of building the ‘mud-wall’ was used in some parts of this area. A frantework of wattles was made and on both sides of this the clay was plastered in layers, each layer being allowed to dry before the next was applied. Straw was cut into short lengths and ntixed with the clay.” Parish of Donagh, Co. Monaghan.

Moffet, in his anti-Irish burlcsquc pocm, “The Irisli Hudibras”, published in 1728, describes an Irish house as having the walls “with cow dung plaister’d round” and alludes to the “crannies” in them through which the smoke emerged. This can only mean that the walls were of wattlework plastcred, according to the traditional formula, with a mixture of clay and cowdung.3 In 1705 the Irish Parliament, to secure the planting and preservation of timber trees and woods, passed an act which, because “great quantities of young trees are daily destroyed by the making of gadds and wyths”, forbade persons to use “in wattling the walls of houses or cabbins, or outbuildings, any kind of gadd or gadds, wyth or wyths, of oak, ash, birch, hazel or other tree whatsoever. ...”4 Dunton, in 1698, dcscribing the house of a small farmer which he visited in Co. Kildare, speaks of “a room which was divided by a wattled partition plastered with clay from the room we were in. It had a wattled door which was not impervious to Argus eyes. ...”3 More informative stili is the same writer’s description of the house of “one OTlaghertie the most considerable man in this territorye” (i.e. wcst Galway) as “a long cabbin, the walls of hurdles plaister’d with cow dung and clay”.6 Head, in 1674, complains that in Irish houses: “The smoke goes through no particular place, but breaks through every part between the rods or wattles of which they make their doors, sides, and roof of the house,....”7 An anonymous writer, in 1673, States:— “But that which has hitherto, and, I doubt, will ever hereafter be a blcmish to the flourishing state of Ireland in point of Building, is the great number of Nasty-Smoaky-Cabins every where, made up of Wattles, without\n\n1 Madden, Samuel.\n\nReflections and Rcsolutions Proper\n\nfor the Gentlemen of Ireland.

That it was built according to the post-and-wattle technique cannot be doubted. Ali the evidence points to this as being the dominant type in pre-Norman times and it is, doubtless, this which, in Pynnar’s survey of the Ulster Plantation in 1618, is called an “Irish” house3 in contrast to the “cagework” or framed house erected by many of the British\n\n1 The Present State of Ireland: together With Some Remarques Upon\n\nthe Antient\n\nState\n\nthereof.

In these cases tenipered clay or sods took the place of the curtaining of plastered wattle which would, in earlier times, have fillcd the spaces between thc posts. I11 this connection we may recall that from Ballygawlcy, Co. Tyrone (17), and Dromod, Co. Kerry (59), wc have two instances of daub bcing applied to wattle doors. It can hardly have been a very succcssful or a very permanent expedient but, howcver mistaken in application, it very clearly embodies thc recollection of an ancient practice. As has been said, there is a gcneral consensus of opinion that the post-and-wattle building was the normal type of dwelling house in prc-Norman Ireland, both thc literary and archaeological evidcnce pointing to that conclusion,15 although it is probable that there wcre some inhabited districts where, 011 account of a local scarcity of timber, other materials were used. From this ancient period there are at least two references which secm to indicate definitely thc usc of wattle doors. They occur in the law tract called Crlth Gabhlack the redaction of which dates to thc opening years of the eighth century. The first is found in a description of tech n-inchis, which “was a residcnce erected for a stranger in kin who undertook thc maintenance of an aged freeholder, whosc surviving relatives were either unable or unwilling to per forni this duty”.16 Al¬ though thc description is brief and not easy to follow it obviously refers to a wattled house. For our present purpose, howcver, its chief interest lies in thc statement which says: da (n)dorus (n-)and —conila(c) ar ala n-ai, cliath ar alailiu: “two doorways in it—a door (comlae) to one of them, a hurdle (cliath) to the other.”17 There can be hardly any doubt that the cliath is a wattle door. Com¬ lae, on the other hand, is the gcneral word for the valve of a door but, in this contcxt, it is so\n\n1 ibid., pp. 79, 85, 87-88, 88, 98, 106, 110,112, 120, 121, 123, 124.\n\nMs. 1077, p. 267.\n\n11 i.f.c.,\n\nMs. 1077, p. 280.\n\n2 Cal.

It may bc that in thc eighth ccntury, as in Conamara (19) and Doncgal (7) in thc ninctccnth, a woodcn door was used on thc windward side of thc house and a wattlc onc on thc shcltered side. The sccond rcfcrcncc occurs in an enumeration of thc pcnalties for injuring thc property of a person of thc boaire reire breithe grade: Cbic seoit i ndul tria thech tria Has, di brisiud a chomlad; dartaid i jieisc tis, colpdach i fleisc tuas, samaisc i cleith tls, colpdach i cleith tuas: “Five ‘seds’ in liability for going through his house or his enclosure by brcaking his door; a male ycarling calf in liability for an under rod, a ycarling calf for an upper rod, a two year old heifer for an under wattlc, a ycarling calf for an upper wattlc.”1 As far as can bc ascertaincd from their usc in othcr contexts, flesc and cliath are intcrchangable, both words connoting a slendcr rod, although cliath has, both in ancient and modern usage, also thc meaning of hurdle. In the context above sonie technical distinction is evidcntly intended betwecn them and to indicate that diffcrcnce thc former has here becn rendered by “rod” and thc latter by “wattlc”, although what that distinc¬ tion may have implied it is now impossible to know. 0’Curry suggests that the rod (flesc) was a withy, presumably loopcd, used to fasten the door at top and bottom and that the wattlc (cliath) was a bar used as an alternative method of securing it above and below.2 The brcaking of these could, howcver, hardly bc construcd as brcaking thc door (cotulae) and it seems much more probable that both the rod (flesc) amd wattlc (cliath) wcrc intcgral parts of thc door itsclf in which case the door must have becn a wattlcd construction analogous to, or identical with, the types which we have been considering. We are now in a position to see the wattle doors which excitcd the curiosity of the travellers of the nineteenth ccntury in their historical perspectivc. The ancient Irish house was a wattlcd structure with, as we should expeet, a wattle door. This type of house continued in use through medieval times down to the sixteenth century, when the climination of the great woods which formerly covercd an enormous area of the country becamc a considcred part of thc English government’s policy for the conquest of the country.3 Their destruction was deemcd imperative, not mercly becausc they gave shelter to the Irish rebels as far as their persons wcre concerned, but also becausc they afforded them safe harbours and winter pasturage for their cattle in the clearings.4 Bcsidcs the crude method of mere felling their end was hastened by thc export of timber both in a raw state for shipbuilding and in a manufactured state as pipe or barrel staves, but, most of ali, by the setting up of a large number of iron works to firc which immense quantities of timber had to be converted into charcoal.5 As timber for house building bccame less and less available the people were compelled to turn more and more to substitute materials, as clay, stone or sods, for their walls, although, as we have seen, wattle houses did survive, in some districts, at least, down to the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the cighteenth century. Already, however, the exploitation of the sub-fossil timber of the post glacial forests of pine and oak buried\n\n1 ibid., pp. 8-9, lines 213-216. 2 0’Curry, Eugene, op. cit., p. 27.\n\n3 e.g. Cal.

Enough willow or hazel rods, however, were usually available to allow the continued use of this ancient door and its survival was prolongcd in the more economically backward districts by the bare level of subsistence to which the rapidly expandmg population was reduced which deprived thern both of the incentive and the means of obtaining supplies of sawn timber for the manufacture of normal wooden doors. With the gradual improvement of conditions in the latter half of the century the use of this door on dwelling houses was finally abandoned but it lingered on for sheds and outhouses in a few isolated places almost to our own day.2\n\nABBREVIATIONS i. f.c. p.k.i.a. j. c.h.a.s. p.s.a.s.\n\nIrish Folklore Commission.

I11 his doctor’s dissertation 1912 (p. 519) N.\n\nWohlin\n\nconsidered the\n\ncause of these contrasts to lie in “probable racial peculiarities”—after having more or less dismissed the thought that lay closest at hand, namely that differences in the structure of agriculturc were the sole explanation (ibid.). I.\n\nFlodstrom,\n\nwho was\n\nSundbarg’s\n\nintimate friend, close contcmpo-\n\nrary and, to a certain extent, his disciple, treated the question in an important survey in Ymer 1915. This survey contained numerous tables and a map showing the frequency of legitimate births in every jurisdictional district in Sweden between the years 1891 and 1900 (calculated per 1000 married women aged 15-45). It also took up the question of race in a prcliminary way. In 1918\n\nFlodstrom\n\nonce more took the opportunity of treating that subject, now in the symposium\n\nSveriges Folk edited by himself and unique in many respeets. Amongst other things he published long excerpts from\n\nFurst\n\nand\n\nRetzius’\n\ntables in Anthropologica Succica 1902, which surprisingly\n\nshowcd similar geographical contrasts for several (other) racial characteristics. More and more Flodstrom’s\n\ninterest shiftcd to the purely anthropological aspect. After his retirement in 1921 he\n\nobtaincd generous grants from official funds, which enabled him, amongst other things, to de¬ vote his unflagging energy to more detailed analyses of\n\nFurst\n\nand\n\nRetzius’\n\noriginal material"
