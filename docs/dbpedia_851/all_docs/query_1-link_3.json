        "text": "Day one:\n\nWe start in Saltsjöbaden, about 20 km from the central of Stockholm. The goal for today is to anchor in the end of the archipelago where the trees are low and shaped by the winter storms and the rocks are smooth and heated by the sun. The name of the small archipelago, one of more than hundred groups of islands included in the Stockholm Archipelago, is “Biskopsön” and the course from Saltsjöbaden is straight east. Entering to the lagoon is tricky with a lot of submerge rocks but well worth it when we are on anchor. All surrounded by islands, the water is flat and a nice breeze is blowing across the deck of s/y Ichiban.\n\nFor those who want to come closer to the nature we launch the two kayaks and you set off or maybe you prefer to make an excursion in the RIB. With a little bit of luck you will discover sea eagles and seals in the area. The dinner today is a BBQ on one of the islands, a three-course-dinner will be served and as a grand final coffee with avec will be served on deck onboard S/Y Ichiban.\n\nDay two:\n\nIn the morning the smell of freshly baked bread is spread through the yacht. If you want to take a swim in the sea before breakfast you find the swimming ladder hanging on the hull side.\n\nAfter breakfast we bring up the anchor and set off towards the next natural harbor, “Stora Nassa”. The route will take us through the outer archipelago which includes intense navigation. There are very few navigation marks in these areas and we must not make mistakes when the 45-ton-yacht is moving between the islands and skerries in eight knots.\n\nThe “Stora Nassa” archipelago consists of 365 islands and our goal for today is to moor to one of them. The area Nassa has about 20 small archipelagos such as “Stora Nassa” and is an amazing area full of small islands and skerries with small trees shaped by the winter storms. The islands are smoothen by the ice 10,000 years ago. You have to be a skilled skipper to sail in these waters.\n\nTo moor to the rocks we need to work as a team, it is a lot of ropes and fenders that have to be fitted the right way. When everything is correct attached it is time to explore the archipelago and islands inside it either by the dinghy, kayaking or walking. If you find your way to the highest point of the islands you will have an indescribable view, you will see all the islands miles around you. Back onboard the chef will serve you a fantastic three-course-dinner, this time on the aft deck.\n\nDay three:\n\nWhen the sun has raised above the cliffs of “Stora Nassa” we set of towards “Svenska Högarna”. This is a small archipelago as far east as you can sail in the Stockholm Archipelago and the route consists of a number of tricky passages. Arriving to the islands we will take the dinghy to the main island where we walk up to the old light house built in 1874. Stepping up the ladder inside the light house and visiting the old house where the lighthouse personal lived give a good view how the life was when the light house demanded constant care.\n\nWhen we are back where we left the dinghy the chef has laid a lunch on the sun heated smooth rocks. The view from our lunch spot is amazing, islands everywhere but looking eastward the horizon is empty, next stop in this direction is the Baltic States. Laying down on the smooth rocks you can feel the accumulated heat from the sun while sipping a glass of wine or a beer.\n\nSetting the sails again we will use the 400-square meter gennaker. This sail demands us to works as a team and after some instructions we can see how the winds catches the sail and how the yacht accelerates. To be at the helm with this gigantic sail as the motor is an indescribable experience.\n\nWe make a stop in Sandhamn, all sailors metropol. Here you find bars, boutiques, pools and restaurants. We do get some attention when entering the harbor with such a yacht! Maybe you choose to stay here for the night, or we continue to a quieter place.\n\nDay four:\n\nToday we will sail outside the archipelago into the Baltic Sea. Sailing along the small skerries and islands along the border of the archipelago you start to understand how well protected Stockholm is inside the barrier of 33,000 islands. Today we can feel the setting from the waves that we were totally without inside the archipelago.\n\nThe goal for tonight is an amazing archipelago with s fantastic lagoon in the middle by the name Byttan. There is a very tricky entrance which looks like a giant slalom track but when we are anchored in the middle of the lagoon it is well worth it. Tonight the chef is preparing the dinner ashore on one of the beautiful island surrounding the lagoon.\n\nWhen anchored you take the dinghy to the mainland to lit the fire in the sauna. In a short while it is nicely warm and you enjoy a beer or a coke while sweating and chatting. When it gets too hot you plunge yourself in the sea, and then enter the sauna again to warm up.\n\nDay five:\n\nThe course today is more west, today´s goal is a bigger island by the name Utö which is a former mining island that was converted to a recreation area in the beginning of the 20th century. You can still find the mines and visit the local museum describing what has happen on the island through the years.\n\nToday’s sailing will make us tack into the wind, this means a lot of teamwork and a lot of planning to make the tacks efficient passing through the archipelago. Tacking such a big yacht means that we have to learn to act as a team making the process work while the 120-square meter genoa is brought to the other side.\n\nThe entrance is fascinating because it is a very narrow channel leading into the inner harbour mark with buoys and you are led by two buoys in line to keep you on the right course. This is an island perfect for biking and there are a lot of them for hire.\n\nDay six:\n\nWe are heading for the most south east corner of the Stockholm Archipelago, Huvudskär, an archipelago consisting of 100 small islands. Huvudskär is a former fishing harbour that is mentioned in the history books as far back as 400 years. During the years, there has been a pilot station here and of course a light house that was handled manually by three families leaving on the islands.\n\nWhile sailing, we will pass a wreck from a sailing ship. Due to the brakeage water there are no sea worms in the Baltic and therefore a sunken ship will stay as it was when it sank. There are big numbers of wrecks discovered lately due to modern technology and they are in very good condition.\n\nNext night harbour is another extremely well protected natural harbour at the north tip of the island Fjärdlång. The entrance is very narrow and we are passing some submerged rocks just five meters away, you can see the shifting colors in the water from the rock just underneath the surface.\n\nDay seven:\n\nIf this is a one-week-trip we need to return to mainland today. The surprise of today appears when we are passing Kanholmsfjärden and slowly slowing down until Ichiban is completely still. After a while we hear the sound of an engine coming closer and soon we see an amphibian plane landing on the water and making its way towards us. In a few minutes you see Ichiban as a small yacht beneath and all of the islands in the archipelago in front of you. Back onboard we wave goodbye to the pilot before setting sail again.\n\nThe passage passing Waxholm between the fortress and the small village is amazing. It is easy to let the brain go back in time to when Waxholm was a center of commerce and further on until the time when the fortress defended the passage to Stockholm from the Russian armies.\n\nClose to Saltsjöbaden we pass through Skurusundet and all the houses climbing on the rocky sides of the passages and most exciting is the very small passage which was dug by war prisoners. This passages is so narrow we cannot meet another ship, communication on the radio is demanded so that ships can agree on where to meet."
