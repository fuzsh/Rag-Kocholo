We are a family whose fortunes have fluctuated and changed but who through work, thrift and al¬ ways with a strong faith in God’s blessing have lived to be of use in the community in which each one has lived. Our father, Jonas Magnus Jonson Liljedahl, was born Dec. 8, 1838, i.n Eksjo Horeda socken (county), Jon- kopings lan, Smaland, Sweden. He was confirmed in Sweden in 1854. He was married Midsummer day, June 24, 1862, to Johanna Maria Pettersdotter. Mother was born Feb. 16, 1840, in Skede socken, Smaland, Sweden. She was confirmed in Skede church in 1855. In a family of nine child¬ ren, she was the only daughter. The first three of their children were born in Rusnass, (home) Hor- pda socken, (parish), Smaland, Swe¬ den. Four children were born after mother and father came to America. The children are: Ida Marie, born April 24, 1863, died July 5, 1880; Carl Hjalmar (later called Charles or Charlie), born Jan. 13, 1865, died Dec. 22, 1933. Frans Emil Israel (later called Frank), born Dec. 23, 1867, died May 17, 1944. Gustaf, born Aug. 25, 1871, died Aug. 6, 1942. Selma Antonia, born Feb. 7, 1876; Emily Cecelia, born Dec. 7, 1877; Joseph Edward, born Feb. 25. 1881. In 1869, father came to the United States from Sweden. The three- week trip on the freighter was not made without difficulty for it drift¬ ed among icebergs during some part of the journey. He went directly to Coal Valley, Ill., where he found work in the coal mines. Having been a farmer in Sweden of no small means, this work in the mines was a very great change. I have heard him say that he did not know what hard work was until he came to America. Although he had had a comfortable living in Sweden, fa¬ ther, as was the custom among friends and relatives, had signed a note for his sister’s husband. When the brother in law failed, it took all my father had to pay those debts. Many a time I heard father say to us, “never sign notes for anyone, you are sure to loose.” m/vd-aUM 81JTKOAM HHOL Ifl.’ J .4 note ol fcmoiq ms i Hot iw r>i) ni t.; art* . ril;w avaw Xfc y.J .uJoL'i'. svari ..oli * : vn#-. * \" K ,\\rf. *r* mristtiM bb n-.m asw jK .at ado l o| ,ST #i ,K vu'L kfvtr tS -,ii# 'i v> ^ Jnj eg .- -)j B ,u* 1 te Tiorft *6 oncft J&lrt oriT ->oH ( •mod) fetimzuH ai mod nrvsrw iA-c .hue,' (hn’S ,(rl:ftfiq) ,no^o v. sb'.* I ‘Hfii j ii v.nuW nsJ5a mod m w rmbhrio iuol io 1 Di r; riA oi ‘jmso Tdrfisl bns 131 mod .on* iM stn i ns rmbfirto He worked hard from the very first, saving money so that it would be possible for him to send for his wife and three small children in Sweden. In one year’s time that task and ambition was fulfilled. When father came to America, his family, consisting of mother, Ida, 7; Carl Hjalmar, 5, and Frans Emil, 3, found a temporary home with mother’s brother, Anders Pet¬ erson, who at that time was super¬ intendent of an orphan home in Skede socken. There they stayed until father had earned enough to send for them. Mother never spoke of that time very much, so it must have been a very trying time. When the little family did arrive a year later, there was rejoicing at being united again. I have heard my mother say (although I was only 16 years of age when mother passed away) that the house in which they had to live was very poor, that the cracks in the walls were large and the wind blew, and snow drifted in¬ to the house. My older brother, Charlie, said the snow was so thick on the coverlet or comforter in the morning, that mother would come up in the attic room where the two boys slept and shake off the snow before getting them out of bed. A flat tc pped trunk which father had had made for .his journey, served as dining table for some time whe-.n trey were first here. An old friend of our parents from Sweden related the following inci¬ dent to Joseph many years ago: In¬ asmuch as father was working in the ceal mines day and night, he wrote to his friend, Swan Blom- berg of Orion, Ill., to come and take mother and the children to Orion for a visit. Mr. Blomberg invited them for a three weeks’ stay. Fn- loate t.o Co bon Cliff in i wagon with horse, he found the bridge was out at the Rock River. Mr. Blom¬ berg started to ford the river, but the current was swift and the wag¬ on and horses began to go down stream. He managed to get the double tree loose and jumped on one of the horses which swam across with him. Some men helped him rescue the wagon further down the stream, and he went on to get mother and the children. They re¬ turned to Orion by another road and while visiting there, Ida, 7, fell down the cellar and was hurt very badly. I imagine she recovered without the aid of a doctor or med¬ ical help of any kind. Brother Frank one time recalled that father had taken him through a coal mine. I cannot .help but stop to reflect that if father had been too proud to take the work which presented itself, he wouldn’t have made his success for he had been reared under better circumstances than he and his family encountered here. In the year 1873, father and mo¬ ther, together with father’s two bro¬ thers who had come to the United States before him, decided to leave Illinois, to go to Iowa, buy land and start farming. Thre three brothers whom we shall now call by their American¬ ized names, were: John, Frank, and Gust. After coming to Iowa, they went to Page County where they bought land. The first land father pur¬ chased was 80 acres which is east of the road where the old home¬ stead farm house still stands. He paid $14 an acre for it. On this land which father bought there was no house, but on the 80 acres bought by Uncle Frank (where his son, Oscar Liljedahl now lives) there was a small shack and in that house our family and father’s two bro¬ thers lived. For two years during the winter the three brothers went back to Illinois to work in the coal mines to earn some cash, of which, no doubt, there was a scarcity. Dur¬ ing these winters, a neighbor, John Youngberg, came to help my bro¬ thers do the chores. The weather was mild; brother Frank one time recalled that John Youngberg went about in his shirtsleeves doing his 2 ' r j , . i L Jtf'2 ' 1 ' ' « Mill -i M /* ' $ri> work. At that time their postoffice was at Franklin Grove, where there was a small village. The next land father bought was 40 acres where the old home and buildings now stand. On it was a small shack. Into that house the family moved, and lived in the cel¬ lar the first year. The south part of the present home was the first to be built. Lat¬ er when father acquired more land to the south on which there was a house, it was moved up to the es¬ tablished home and is the present dining room. The kitchen was add¬ ed later. The beginning was a small one but father made further additions to the farm until at the time of his death, the farm consist¬ ed of 400 acres in the home farm, one farm of 160 acres in Pierce Township, and one farm of 160 acres in Montgomery County. Mother, father and their children joined the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Nyman, Iowa, May 24, 1874. This church was called the Fremont church, but later a little town came into existence and was named from its oldest inhabitant, whose name was Nyman. Mother and father were faithful members until their death. When father and his brothers came to this country, nearly every¬ thing they had was in common. Their mail box, No. 105, Essex, was used by all. A Swedish newspaper, “Gamla och nya Hemlandet,” was owned jointly and passed around. I can recall many an evening when Uncle Frank or Uncle Gust would come over to our home. Usually were were eating supper, and after the customary greeting, “Gudfred,” meaning “Gcd’s peace,” they would sit and wait until the meal was over. Then the continued story would be read out loud. At that time I must confess that I did not think that, story reading was very interesting! Thev also acted as bar¬ ber fcr one another. One reaper a.nd one self binder was owned jointly and passed around. In that way they helped one another. Iowa was at the time a new ter¬ ritory and many were the obstacles which had to be overcome. Grass¬ hoppers came, ate the crops, and drought was not infrequent. One thing lingers in my memory very vividly. The fires caused by flying sparks from the train going through our farm made us much work. When these sparks set fire to grass and stubble, often shocks of grain as well as our home was in danger of being burned. As soon as we saw the fire, mother, we girls and my youngest brother who at that time was too small to be in the field, would run to fight the fire. This was done by carrying water in buckets and using gunny-sacks dip¬ ped in the water to put out the flames. I can well remember my dear little mother working to put such fires out until she was about to drop frcm exhaustion. I remember when I was a little girl what a lot of work it was for father and the boys to tile the land because there was too much mois¬ ture. Rain must have been plentiful, and perhaps that new land with prairie grass on it held the water better. What a different story there was in that part of the country dur¬ ing the 1930’s. The heme on our homestead was largely built by my father, the boys and perhaps some help from some¬ one who knew something about car¬ pentry. I remember when we only had a kitchen, a big room with two big beds in it, and a trundle bed beneath the big bed. The trundle bed in which we children slept was a low bed which cculd be pushed under the other bed during the day. I was then about three or four years old. I well recall my sister, Ida’s death when she was 17 years of age. I was about four years old. Ida was such a good, industrious girl, and by this time my mother had acquir¬ ed a sewing machine, so my sister would help neighbors by sewing for 3 v , i Tftfcnsm n i i : vy li&j i o ten! orii zaw ocno i hnU pom ter&uwm nsrfw to n;>f »o r iri* ittudo ;i‘td t i :w l I'i-*: ,nrss h m jr-.i/f .:i fcoog e hut .acnorl wo oi f»vo tirnoo bnfi .Txjqira yoiJe'i ww siaw on ill 03 Off: uociT V. i‘JV a*i my. vtki’ ; J«tU jinu*.t -W’f h /»«.-.

She had finished a garment for a neighbor, had walked across the fields to bring it to this person, and when she returned home com¬ plained that she had a terrible head¬ ache. This was the beginning of ty¬ phoid fever, and it took only a couple of weeks until she passed away. I remember vividly the day she died. The relatives, our pastor, the Rev. N. G. Dahlstedt, mother, fa¬ ther, brothers, sister Emily and my¬ self, all stood or sat at Ida’s bed¬ side. I was a special favorite of hers; she held out her hand to me to say goodbye, but I was afraid and drew away. This still lingers in my memory, and I greatly feel sorry that I should have felt that way toward my sweet sister who loved me so much and I, her. Sister Ida’s death was a great blew to my parents, especially to my mother who grieved much fer her eldest child. Many times did I see my mother go into the ‘‘front” room parlor where hung Ida’s pic¬ ture, to stand before it with tears streaming down her face. How lit¬ tle did I know then how a mothers’ heart only can long for a lest child. My sister was of a pious nature, and I can recall my father saying years later that Ida told mother that she must meet her in Heaven. Fa¬ ther then asked her if he could not come, too, and Ida said, ‘‘Yes, but mother should ccme first.” So it happened. I am sure that mother and Ida were very close to one another when they worked side by side in poverty and hardships of all kinds. There were many relatives as well as neighbors present at the funeral, and before the services, the people were served to bread, butter, honey, and I presume, coffee. I suppose the custom of having fo-d served in Sweden at funerals made my parents do this to carry out that custom in a small way. I shall 'nev¬ er forget the many helpful things which Uncle Gust iLiljedahl did at that time. My father had a sister who was older than he, Mrs. Anna Stina Johnson. She came to this country with five sons and a daughter and having no place to go, they lived upstairs in our house for a long time. I do not know just what year they came to America, but cne son, by the name of Oscar, came about 1879, and died of typhoid fever in July, 1880, a couple of weeks after our sister, Ida’s death. He, too, is buried in the Fremont cemetery at Nyman. I remember so well the morning after Joseph was bern. A Mrs. Blomberg who was there to assist, called me out of bed to see the new brother. She had me sit on a rocking chair before the cook stove with my feet prepped upon the hearth; then she put the baby in my lap to hold him before the fire. He was all wrapped up in a shawl to keen him warm. About three weeks later he was brought to church to be baptized. On Sunday morning my uncle Frank Liljedahl, and his wife, Aunt Annie, who were the sponsors, came early bring him to church. Just as aunt to our he use to get the baby to Annie had picked up the small bun¬ dle and was to leave, she and uncle stood still while she, my aunt, pray¬ ed the Lord’s Prayer. It made such an impression on me that I shad never forget it. How beautiful it was. The older generation had a simplicity of faith which is lacking in many teday. The foundation of our house was made of native s one which was taken from a stone quarry about six miles southeast of our home. Father had b blast this, cut it up into pieces, and haul it in the w ig- on pulled by horses. We of this age cannot imagine the work our fathers had, lifting those heavy rocks and loading them onto the wagon, later getting mortar and building the strnes into walls which made the cellar and foundation of the .house. During this period of building I remember one night there was a 4 orrrss a L ; ^2 r. -)f bvaHcw fc»;H t'indsWofi c lot blirfo taohf* vj. i . r, *j ;i5iof r.bi yb fcbJ bne forffom |«iH *W« rilil .>!'- ;w -,■*«<.,» .MttHBWfl • blik *9,U .Mr i*ai<1 b i ttvifri V» rtioi«uo -jH *-> )y } n< i < i BirfJ 6*> s: terrific rain storm. Father was out in it. My mother was worried as it was late at night when he finally came home. He had then been at the stone quarry to bring .home a load of stone. It took many, many loads for all the foundations of the buildings on the farm were made of this stone. There was always some kind of building going on when I was a child. This meant that there were extra men to cook for, and mother’s hands were more than full at all times. As scon as it was possible our parents beautified our home. Mo¬ ther wanted catalpa trees, so along the picket fence in front of our home there was a long row of cat¬ alpa trees. When they were in bloom they presented a lovely sight. A horseshoe-shaped flower bed was in front of our house. It was a de¬ light to our mother who was of an artistic temperament, and father al¬ ways enjoyed sitting on the front lawn on the green painted benches in the summer. Croquet was en¬ joyed on the lawfn in summer. Is it not strange how the picture of our childhood home lingers in our minds- It’s soon fifty years since I left the parental home, but it looks beautiful to me to this day — and it was. Father was a very hard worker, and he also wanted his whole household to be busy at something useful. Had not such been the case, wculd he have succeeded as he did? Mother’s constant work with cook¬ ing, baking, washing, ironing also contributed to the many comforts and blessings we have t( day. One of father’s outstanding traits was truthfulness at all times. Rev Fredin, one of our ministers, had many various discussions with fa¬ ther, and he said he had never found anyone who was as truthful as father. Father was also just, al¬ though he was very strict, and his heart was of the kindest and mod lovable toward his children. I think few fathers toiled, worked, and planned any more or as much as father did for us. He was especial¬ ly considerate and loving toward his girls, but work we must and to this day I am thankful that I was taught to work with my hands. The Town of Essex was the trad¬ ing point during those first years. However, when there were many and better clothes to be bought such . as suits and overcoats for the boys and coats and hats for mother and the girls, we went to Red Oak, 11 miles north of our home. I well remember when my mother bought her first fine coat, a plush coat. It was a seal coat and was a pretty glossy black. We always made a trip to Red Oak in the spring of the year and also in the fall after corn picking time. My mother was a woman of good taste and never bought any¬ thing gaudy or shcddy looking for us. Mother saw to it that we went to school, which was held in the Lone Star School, a little over a mile from home. In the winter time we walked on top cf very high snow¬ drifts to school. The two oldest boys, Charlie and Frank, were sent to Swedish school, five miles from home (the Center School house) and at times they would stay with the Blomberg family. I remember the boys telling about some of their food, the like of which has never been experienced by children of this day. Every Friday they would walk home. Ida, Charlie and Frank did net get to attend public school for a very long period of time, but I know that they all had fine hand¬ writing, better than many of most boys and girls of this ago. Hr. ther Gust went to public and narochial school longer than his older bro¬ thers. Emily, Joseph, and I also went to parochial school or as we put it, “Swede School.” This school was taught by the organist of our church and was held in three dif¬ ferent parts of the congregation or parish. The one which we attended was heated on Younggren’s land. 2 miles from our home. Religious in¬ struction was given there and our 5 i ,o 'di aoq tn% ii *c nooz aA * i»>ih c : .Sb-rrt juc su .> , u ii ai ooiwl Jojfoiq j*0 » ' -V rnxl Oi iJ ui fcf-vrf • vr f Diriw tIo< .do* y ti irv jfi. < » o.ruMl iw n ? d \" ^ * 'irtific >••>?$ no ’ 7nf // i ; *: - / ) q n i r)s: v lo ul: a Ii.fnao *ii) *J uri (j/dv/ lo owf .,41 ; i i r>- ' IjU* tor- b ;H .lutoeu '“bib yd a i L b'9 we ort b ;# m iV*dioM . jnifier* ,3m :ti ! > v nii/' < aril cl :r. u i*J»Oo Jbj|qnl ft btiw. . ,jj to n > .mba't'M '■ 1 - . i . | < : , ■ ■ .7 bm> /idriJ .Trdtn: gii .81/ 1C main textbooks were the Bible, Bi¬ ble History, and the Catechism. The latter lesson was always mem¬ orized and, what a wonderful train¬ ing that was for us. I know that our parents gave us better educa¬ tion then with the small means at hand than the children of this day are getting, because we received the most important kind of training, religious. When we were not in school, mother used to have us learn Bible verses, catechism, as well as while pslams from our Swedish hymn book every morning. She had us study the lessons “out loud”, so she could hear what we were say¬ ing, and then she would correct us if we made a mistake. This was the way we three younger children were brought up. I do not know about the older children’s training. Spelling and grammar (rattskrif- ning) were also taught in the Swed¬ ish school. My first teacher in this school was a man by the name of Bergquist (his son was J. V. Berg- quist, composer and musician). On my first day cf school I was asked to come to his desk to recite, but I, being shy, was too bashful to move. Mr. Bergquist simply came down to where I sat, took hold of my ear and led me up to his desk, to my great chagrin. There was another u.d school teacher named Olson, who also taught music. He used to hit my fingers with a pencil when hearing my lesson, on the parlor organ. M.r J. A. Ahlstrand was cur beloved teacher for many years. The parlor organ which my father bought, was one of the first in the community. My brother, Charlie, took lessons, and I think the other b. ys did also. At this time Emma Carlson, who later married my oldest brother, Charlie, was the teacher. Well I can remember how she used to thrill us by singing “Listen to the Morking Bird” and other songs. Al¬ so I know I used tc gaze in won¬ der at her because I thought she was so pretty . I admired her pret tv dresses which she herself had made. She also taught our publi^ school and a part of the time she boarded at our house. All six of we living children at¬ tended school at Luther Academy, Wahoo, Nebr. When I was eighteen my father sent me to school at Luther. My three older brothers had all been .there before as there was not a high school near us at that time. My sister Emily and a hired girl we had at that time, kept house at home for a year. Then it was her turn to go to the same school and I stayed at home and kept house with the aid of a sixteen year old girl. That was no small task, with a big farm and six or seven men to cook for. Emily attended school a year. After that she and I kept house for my father until I was married in 1899. Brother Jcseph was the next to go to Luther Academy, and he was the only one to graduate from that school. We girls used to have a playtime right after dinner but later in the day we would help sew carpet rags, piece quilts, and sew because all of our ck thes were made at home. At that time there were no ready-made dresses to buy. On Sundays the whole family was always ready for church. I remem¬ ber how mother used to begin on Saturday to lay out our clcthes in the best or “front” room so that they would be ready for us to put on Sunday morning. When we went to church there were two buggies, as we were too many to go in one. We seldom had Sunday evening services, if ever, when I was small, but mother used to gather usarcund the dining room table (by this time we had acquired a big house); she would have us read evening psalms or hymns before we went to bed. If the weather on a Sunday was too bad for us to go to church, fa¬ ther would read from the big “Pos- tillia,” a book of sermons. I won¬ der how many do anything like that ni wadays. I think it was custom¬ ary among a good many at that time. We canne t estimate how 6 - bl; 1.-, ,, rit -,V.

We had various kinds of vehicles. First we used to go to church in a lumber wagon, but soon, I don’t think I was but about 8 years of age, we had a two-seated spring wagon. Before long we had our fine carriage. I remember to this day the morning we went to church in it. It had a top over the back seat to shield us from the sun, so mother and we girls sat there. Then there was a small seat between the back and the front seat. Usually, Joseph sat <_n the middle seat and someone else. We also had a cart, a two-wheel¬ ed vehicle, which was popular at that time. It was drawn by one horse, and someone would ride or drive to church in that. I remem¬ ber mother especially used to enjoy that cart because we could take it and go to town by ourselves, which was a great treat to her. We had two nice, gentle bay horses which we girls drove as much as we liked. Horseback riding was much enjoy¬ ed, and I remember well how proud I was when we grt a red plush side saddle, because, of course, no girls rode astride in those days. Brother Gust and I used to herd the cattle to keep them out of the corn and other fields, and then the saddle came in very handy. As for amusements, we had those tc o. Uncle Frank, father’s brother, lived in a little more than half a mile frt m us. His children were * about the age of we younger ones, and we used to often go to their home on a Sunday afternoon, and always we wculd stay for coffee. Father’s other brother, Gustaf, and his family lived about a mile and a half away. There, too, we would spend Sunday afternoons, and we children would play. Other Sun¬ days these two famil'es would come in our h- use. Another family with whom we visited were the John Sederbercs. They lived a couple of miles from our house. There were Christmas parties (kaleses) when the whole neighborhood was invited children and all, extending Christ¬ mas festivities several weeks. Cus¬ tom was that the adults always ate first, and the children ate at the second table or perhaps the third. When it came to our turn, we were always very hungry. Chairs were .not very numerous either, so the children usually had to stand up while they ate, but what did we care? We thought it was supposed to be that way, and we would eat and then run to play again. There would be all kinds of good food: rye bread, sweet rolls, knake brod (hard tack), cakes, cookies, and pies. Of course, all kinds of meats as well as the wonderful turkeys we used to have. That was for the older folks. Then we young folks had skating parties, coasting parties, big neighborhood parties where the young folks would gather and play all kinds of games. Our dining room made an ideal place for this because it was large. I remember mother and father would watch while a big crowd would be playing games. In sum¬ mer time we had fishing parties when young folks would again come, and we would proceed to our pasture where there was nice pic¬ nic spots. A supper party in the open would conclude the fishing party. Oh yes, we had plenty of wholesome fun and gayety even in those days. On winter evenings we played dominoes, checkers, and oth¬ er games while eating apples and hazelnuts which we had gathered in the fall on the hills east of Co¬ burg, where the hazel brush was thick. Every fall, cheese parties were prevalent when I was a child, and later I attended them after becom¬ ing a housekeeper. The neighbor women would invite each other to the homes to help make enough cheese to last throughout the year. It would begin early in the morning. Always the house was spic and span for this occasion and all kinds of good food prepared ahead of time. The women would come, bringing 7 fyoq&Srt bmj Jhiqg doimio b to: f>fi sW os ape *fi$ moil atf tytairtg .tf.n -t; Amu do oJ »y ib . > d i n .* \"nil it A . ;j • - toH H'ti' ' ) 1 ; tf)8llK30 . .*)!bbra •JO -i ,r .UOX 9W *io 04 B iii ? | « k * ,5jtuS 'ii*rj ol oa rwtlu oi bt*u sw bat ,tf< '■>< \\ ;.

The milk was warmed in large vessels and the work progressed. Most of the women were experts at this, so in a short while several beautiful cheeses were made, de¬ pending of course on the amount of milk which had been brought. After that was over, there was cof¬ fee and lunch for everybody, and a nice social time was enjoyed. (The men who brought the milk had been served coffee before going home). These parties were a good deal of fun. A cheese or two was always made for the minister and the organist of the church. A really nice custom it was, too! Mother was a mild-mannered, tender-hearted woman who was very concerned about her children and wished for the better things in life for us. It is now over forty years since our dear mother passed away, but many things still linger in my memory. I remember how my mother cocked. She liked to have much food. One of the delica¬ cies she used to make was a cake called “socker kaka.” It was some¬ thing like a sunshine cake, but she put no baking powder or cream cf tartar in it. The batter was beaten continuously fcr one hour a.nd in that way the air was beat into it. It was a delicious cake, and when there was any extra affair she al¬ ways brought this cake. Another specialty was a whit 2 sugar cookie with frosting sprinkled with red sugar. How well I remember the different kinds of bread, the ost- kaka and palt, a blood sausage, as well as the perk a.nd beef sausage that she made at butchering time. Housekeeping in mother’s day was strenuous, to be sure. We did not have corn starch in those days, so in the fall after the potatoes were dug, we made potato starch. Bushels of potatoes would be grated, and this would take days. When the potatoes had been grated, they v/ere placed in a large tub or tubs and washed. When it was washed, water was poured over the mass of grated po¬ tatoes which settled to the bottom. The process was repeated for days until all the coarse pieces or residue had come to the top and been pour¬ ed off. When at last the starch had ail settled on the bottom of the tub. had become wh’te as snow and hara, it was ready to be powdered. This was accomplished by scraping this fine and sifting it when it was ready for use. It made a delicious pud¬ ding, and it was used for all kinds of thickening of sauces and pud¬ dings. In our home this was a fre¬ quent dessert. Mother also made the candles, but not in the time that I am able to remember. All the wool stock¬ ings were knit by her. Night after night she would sit and knit while the rest of us were reading or play¬ ing games, but there was no time for her to be idle. I have in my possession a pair of stockings which mother was making when she was taken sick and died. The wool had also been carded, spun, and dyed by her. All the men’s overalls were made at home, and that meant there need¬ ed to be overalls for five men. There were no patterns in those days. I often wondered how she managed the first pair. (Later I know when I used to help that we always rip¬ ped an old pair for our pattern. . All the everyday shirts were made at home, as well as the underwear. Sv.me of the underwear was made * of red flannel. Why the color red was chosen I do not know, unless it was such a warm color. In the fall in corn husking time was there ever any rest for mother? In the evenings she and we girls had to mead husking mittens. I remember the boys tco used to make their mittens on the sewing machine, of cotton flannel. There were no husking naittHns to be bought at that time. The womei also helped shock wheat and other grain. 8 tj' i&< a ccf ( iioo riOi l > viH<o r>til i _* -*ra h er{ Ifu u >f< h bau ,x*b 9; sgtfit m boims w zsw 2#fim arfT .nj? oic ?!iov/ >/'t bna Isiwv 9(utw iio/te B iTl 03 ,3tr .... ‘V oJ • - .9»S«H hilii j»i;iUOld 8’{i*W . f{ N ' V * 'J l 'J I A/ \" iTi 1 u-ii.i Jr: i< b Mftii t'i:i VI US i OJ ^iKH-Hr l/a Mother used to make our every¬ day dresses, petticoats and every¬ thing. Brother Charlie would .help her by running the sewing machine for her after sister Ida died. I remember that one day my mo¬ ther said that when she wanted help with her flower beds that Frank was the one on whom she could depend for help. You see, all the children in those days helped and shared in all of the work, and a great thing it was to have that share in the home. It made one really love home! Father did not have any sheep from which we got our wool for carding and spinning, but mother bought the wool from some neigh¬ bor or acquaintance. She had a spinning wheel made to order in Sweden and sent to her so that she could spin. It was large enough to pack into a trunk. We girls used to help pull the wool apart for carding and later to be spun into yarn. It used to be fascinating to watch her draw out the long strands of yarn and at times she would sing as she was doing so. Often when she was sitting at the sewing machine she would sing some hymn. This re¬ minds me that when my sister. Emily and I were working we would sing as loud as we could, asking questicns and answering one an¬ other. We did not realize that it was opera on a small scale! Besides the three meals a day which mother cooked, lunch was sent out to the men both morning and afternoon. Nearly always this lunch consisted cf doughnuts and pie. I do not remember whether we brought out coffee, but we always had to bring water in big brown jues. Emily and I used to ride on old “Mollie” or “June” with the jug hung on the kncb of the saddle. Later when we had bought the two¬ wheeled cart we used it, which was much easier. . Both mother and we girls helped with the milking. We used to milk as manv as 15 to 18 cows. Just im¬ agine the milk buckets there were to carry. The only kind of refrig¬ eration we had in those early days were barrels, later water tanks, in which the large milk cans were placed. In the summer cold water was pumped by hand from the well to cool the milk. At first butter was made and • sold to the stores in town, but later the cream was sold to the creamery. A wagon would come along several times a week to buy the cream. Only enough butter was churned at home for the family consumption. Oh, how good and sweet that butter would taste when spread on fresh home-made bread! Another thing commonly done by our pioneer mothers was to help their neighbors when they were ill. I remember mother would cook and bring food to our “American” neigh¬ bors when they were sick. One dish which she would bring to our friends was veal roast, so nice and brc wn. In those pioneer days there were no mattresses to be bought for the beds. Every fall after corn picking time we all .had to go to the corn¬ field and gather husks for the mat¬ tresses. A ticking cover, which was a heavy cotton material, was made the size of the bed with an opening down the center. It was filled with inner husks of the corn and then buttcned. The nice white, soft in¬ ner husks of the corn were chosen. These were split in several pieces, making a soft bed. Every morning these husks were shaken and dis¬ tributed evenly inside this mattress cover, and when the bed was made it presented a smooth appearance. The housekeeper whose beds were not made nicely was not considered a good one. The mattress was laid on slats In the bed. At first there were no springs, but later there was a woven steel spring which was lux¬ ury itself. There were no down pillows for tired .heads to sleep on, but there were fine chicken and gocse feather pillows made at home. When chickens were killed for food, all the nice feathers were saved, 9 r\\ yi. 9 *j aori id Ini / r no - »‘v» t>, « aid aiii^q , , j lorfiOlS HniriJ •> Al'.m -'Mi i ; f'>iriw >ri ;of:m •|aiwi- *riJ gtaauu i yd i*d ■ iihtl an 'I j«nJ atod 1‘iv/uU and riiiw • ut t 'dorf / .) -j a* • 3. :l r»\\v ;air .1 2 ii. jV .cji^ri *ro1 bnsqsb btuod boqij/f aynb nf ns^bfido sdi bna ,#tqw eii; ‘to Ik m b* •': vn • ri.

No wonder every hand of the men, women and girls had enough work to keep them out of mischief. Think of all the toil and sweat that has gone into making this wonderful country of ours! The water question was always a serious one. As our home was on a hill, water had to be carried a long distance where springs were found. It was pumped and carried in pails to the house for cooking, laundry, baths, and all washing. Later, father had a tile run up to the house and a windmill installed to force the water into the kitchen. This was a luxury which was much appreciated. This was installed about 1893 after our mother had died, so she did not get to use this convenience. To carrv water for all the laundry was a heavy task as even white starched shirts, collars and cuffs were done at home. Is it any wonder that our pioneer mothers seldom lived to be very old, my own mother dying at only 51 years of age! Had it not been for the fact that there were large families, with everyone doing their share of work, it could not have been done. There were n0 household labor- saving devices. Instead of an ele.c- tric beater, fresh willows were strip¬ ped, dried, and tied together to make what was called a “visp.” Cream and eggs were beaten in this way. There was no vacuum cleaner to help with the spring cleaning. The rugs in our homes tastily fur¬ nished with rag carpets with the exception of the parlor and spare bedroom which floors had ingrain carpets on them. This was laid and stretched on the floor over straw to make it • soft. Later, i heavy gray paper was used und<-T the carpet. Father, John Liljedahl, was a man of strong physique, a man who could work almost night and day. He was a of a jovial disposition and loved to have people around him Our home was always filled with young men and some girls, too, who came from Sweden and made a temporary home with us. It made an enormous amount of work for mother to cook and bake for so many people besides her own fam¬ ily, and in some cases she nursed them through sicknes. How my dear mother ever stood it, I can’t understand. All this work for a small frail body to do no doubt hastened here untimely death which occurred Jan. 18, 1892. She was 51 years and 11 months old. Her death was caused by pneumon¬ ia which she contracted while on an errand of mercy. There were no nurses to call for illness or confine¬ ment cases. When my aunt, Mrs. Gust Liljedahl, became sick, mother went to help her and stayed there for several days. A baby boy, El¬ mer, was born there and all went well, but mother came home so sick she could scarcely walk into the house. She went to bed, came down with pneumonia and in a few days she was dead. The funeral sermon was preached by Rev. A. F. Nelson, our pastor, on the text John 5: 24-29. Her favorite song was in the old “Hemlandsanger,” number 339. My youngest brother, Joseph, was then not quite 12 years old, Emily, 14, and I was not quite 16 years. Grief stricken as my father was, he had to carry on, and with all his work and large family it was a stupendous task. At first an aunt together with her husband, Alfred Liljedahl, kept house for us and they stayed about a year. They had recently come from Sweden. Others helped us while my sister and I were at Luther Academy at dif¬ ferent years, and in a few years my sister and I did the housework. It was no small task in such a big home and family. All the hired help were treated like one family. I remember it was the hardest to learn to bake bread, which was al- 10 f(B ' 1 1 rf 'ft k siOiJ :i'«i ;tu ; v X; .^n.tdfcflw iiit r i qu Bin off* b fe&;f TSiUirt 1 'll Ilimii v l bin, ic id: .r-SdoJid s>i!J oitti miaw »di e:>io1 :*>i ‘I ‘1*0 1 #0 - 8* d oi ■ ■F. -}f>r 1 yvfljii *J 8B\\* yii )(*;< i y!i»o'. jB ■ v l : Ji'jffi nwo ym ,!>«■ > fi holii o aaw iBiV.v SaUAI ai.ij ni jfOJB' d tew egg • fc mflstt’-J **3$J y. b ; Jdalnr tzorrdr, jhcw bluoo ■» ways made at home. Cake, I had already learned to bake, so that went alright. The large washings and ironings were hard, and at this time we bought our first washing machine which was run by hand power. As long as mother lived, she washed and rubbed the clothe^ on the board. Churning was a hard task, and it took a long time to master good butter making. I still remember Saturday morning when the churning had to be done, bread baked, cake, cookies and pies made for Sunday. Everything must be prepared so that we could go to church Sunday. Choir practice was regularly at¬ tended once a week as we sang in the choir Sunday mornings. After attending school I also sang solos, having taken some voice lessons. This I enjoyed very much, and 1 know my father was proud, al¬ though he never said anything. One event stands cut in my memory. About 1890 father was elected delegate to the synodical convention at Chisago Lake, Minn; It was his first trip to that state which looked so much like Sweden. It did not make a very favorab’e impression cn him. It was like Sweden with its picturesque lakes and small farms but father liked the big prairies, large fields, hun¬ dreds of acres of corn in a stretch instead of “small patches” as he expressed it. Father held places of trust in church as trustee, etc., etc. He also ran for a township office but was defeated. I can see now why he was not a pclitician. He was al¬ ways kind to the poor, and to many a family who was in need he would bring flour, meat, wood, and so on. One act that he never forgot as kng as his mother lived he sent to her in Sweden some money for “Christmas coffee.” Jn those days coffee was scarce in Sweden as well as high-priced. Of course that * money was for other things also, but that was his way of expressing it. About the year 1895 father bought the Essex Flour Mill, which was then and still is, a thriving con¬ cern. Brothers Frank and Gust were in charge, Gust being the manager of it for many years until the time he became associated with the First National Bank, Essex, Aug. 1, 1901. He held the position of cashier until his death Aug. 6, 1942, a period of over 40 years. The twenty-two years our parents spent together in America before my mother’s death were crowned with success. It was success wrought with much labor, tears, joy, and everything that goes into life. No doubt as they looked back there had been more joy than sorrow. They had raised a large family. To their credit I must say that they did a good job because their sons have all been a credit to their parents, and the daughters tried to do their part also. They pros¬ pered financially. Nine years after our dear mother had gone, our father too was taken. He had grieved much and had been lonely all those years. When in 1898, I married, it was a hard blow to him. I did not know it then as well as I do now. To have the eldest daughter leave home when she had been at the head of it for some time was not easy. After I had married and gone to Illinois to live, my father came to visit us in our home the following spring. He stayed two weeks and seemed to so much enjoy himself and the rest he had in our home. I, in turn, thought it was wonderful to have him here. In passing, I might say that we had meanwhile bought a home in the small town where we lived, but before father left us he paid the mortgage rest¬ ing on it and left us a debt-free home. On the morning of July 4, 1900, he left for home. When my husband took him to the station, father complained of having a se¬ vere pain in his stomach. He went home, however, and soon was taken ill. He went to Omaha to seek 11 bsd I .emoil itiiU 06 oj ; ol ^bfioiU avaw Ji-lgiiLu la&vt aor tie *J t bi !

How glad we were that father had had a chance to make us this visit. Upon his return to Essex he had told an old friend that he was so glad that his daughter had mar¬ ried a good man. There existed a close bond be¬ tween father and Uncle Gust Lilje- dahl, and it was Uncle Gust who went with my father to seek med¬ ical aid, to comfort and cheer him as they went here and there. It was Uncle and father who would go together to the aid of a neigh¬ bor in the community when he was in need. Especially do I remember during the hard years when many neighbors lost their farms that the two brothers would help them. Sometimes father would take in the whole family. It was Uncle Gust who came to offer his help after we were left orphans. I must also place a flower to the memory of Gust and his wife who opened up their home for father when he became bedfast, because it was easier to care for him in town than out on the farm where his home was with Brother Frank, who had been married re¬ cently. My warmest thanks goes to sister Emily for tenderly caring for father during these months of illness (six months). Hers was a hard task but she bore it without complaint. The scripture verses which gave him comfort and as¬ surance during his illness were John 5: 24-29, and John 3: 16. November 8, 1900, our dear father passed away after much suffering at the age of 61 years and eleven months. He was satisfied to go after a long and fruitful life crown¬ ed with success. He had come to our wonderful country with empty hands, and at the time of his death he was one of the wealthiest Swed¬ ish immigrants in the community. It meant much sacrifice, much toil, much planning, and as he said in his later years, if it had not been for his helpmeet nor his boys he could not have done it. Today I thank God for those God-fearing parents who thought nothing was too hard to go through to make this world a better place in which the children can live. Let us in this generation and in gener¬ ations to come keep in mind the great sacrifices our parents made. Each generation has its own trou¬ bles and trials, but let us not forget what has been done for us. Father, mother and sister Ida are now resting in Mt. Hope cemetery, Nyman, beside the Fremont church they loved so well. About 1885, my parents sent to Sweden for a niece of my mother’s who came to live with us. Her name was Mathilda Carlson. Her parents were both dead, so our parents took her in like one of their own. She stayed with us about six years when she went to Chicago to live with her brothers. At this writing (1945) she is still living at the age of about eighty, in Illinois. Many more events might be re¬ lated but let this suffice. Let the remaining memories, which per¬ haps are the sweetest, remain hid¬ den deep in our hearts. Peace be to the dear memory of our parents, John M. and Maria Johanna Lilje- dahl! 12 ,oo\\ i. -soil fIJi w u ^ „ : Jfci lb ‘Ciomorn ‘nil oJ '■jofitiv/ ii tvwx> 94 >• rub ^**1 bicd fiV 9-t; icfh‘>8 $iri ^ fhtib v^3 olil iuliitnl bria frnol b >;)a I FRANK PETER TJLJEDAHT, FRANK P. LILJEDAHL Bg Phoebe Liljetlahl Wensfrancl Frank P. iLiljedahl was bom in Smoland, Sweden, Dec. 31, 1842. He came to this country in 1869 and first located in Henry county, Illi¬ nois. From Illinois he went to Kan¬ sas for a short time but returned to Illinois where he stayed four years. In 1874 he came to Page county, Iowa, locating on a farm. In 1877 he was married at Red Oak, Iowa, to Anna Louise Holmes and to this union five children were born: Emelia Hannah Sophia, April 12, 1878; Hilma Amanda, Dec. 9, 1880; Oscar Edward, Feb. 15, 1883; Alma Theresa, Jan. 20, 1886, and Phoebe Otelia, May 16, 1888. They lived cn a farm ten miles south of Red Oak until 1908 when they retired and moved to Red Oak to make their home at 1009 Sixth Street. During their residence on the farm mother and father and family were members of the Fre¬ mont Lutheran church. When they moved to Red Oak, with the exception of Oscar, they transferred membership to the Beth¬ lehem Lutheran church, Red Oak, Ic wa. On Sept. 13, 1916, mother passed away, age 62 years. Feb. 26, 1936, father passed away, age 93 years. One of the characteristics of my father, Frank Liljedahl, was his be¬ ing somewhat of a reserved nature, not quite as talkative perhaps as his brothers, nevertheless very friendly and considerate of everyone with whom he had any dealings. At home he was a most kind and generous husband and father, al¬ ways thinking of everyone’s comfort instead of his own. He worked very hard from morning until night, but he always had time for reading a chapter from one of his daily devo¬ tional books, as Hammarstens Dag- liga Betraktelser. He always attended services on Sunday, weather and reads permit¬ ting. If not, we would all gather in one room where father would read from De Gamla Evangelii Tex- terna, af Gustaf Erickson. Vi Vilja Se Jesus. I think what a great heritage we children have as a memory of our childhood days. Not only did father attend church regularly but gave genei'v usly of his means on many occasions. Besides being an excellent farmer father had many hobbies. He was an expert carpenter. No task was too big for him to undertake, mak¬ ing most of the buildings on the farm. 15 bqu b/iU Jwm s.twr Jfi mod IA i ’rrtv/ h/>u- , nv/<i • <r«j i*** 1 in iMil'i urn <4lJ V ?S t i .

He also made five beautiful candelabras one for each of us chil¬ dren, which we all prize most high¬ ly. He attributed his long life to clean and wholesome living. Would that more people would be like him. Mother, too, was the most won¬ derful mother in the world. Always so cheerful and happy that wherev¬ er she was she radiated sunshine. Her home was her castle; she dedi¬ cated her whole life to home and family. I can still taste those rolls and sugar cookies which she and she alone could make. She also was blessed with good health until the last two or three years preceding her death. Her life was truly a consecrated one and rightly called Blessed. Peace Be Unto Her Memory. •* »-• yi /ol aiujitnul .•> tmlq f jfodw t :I 1 li.y -n>W t«j O tol imilrt ; Lns *!trfo *u lo rtoss v>\\ *(*j «ai<!etotWfcJ blticM .Jjf .iV i jllllsc Aod'/f b:;a lV(tlO D^Jt,u-->iUuo U vLj U 2lw Li i- n -nov. imrrt srf) ,ooi /r^rfioM ..i,. . ... r A ■ . *44 0...44/S, l.iVr^n UV ' ImfiZsGklK/ J »• ^ ***- .Lm_!- >' boir/j) ”lJr{0h fuiB *n< < z'jf. vIA .Bltow Mlt m i9diom lul*i«*f> tU ‘id ■.? -v.-toriw Mi:J xqqacf b:tr, • uVmrfo 02 GUSTAF OTTO LILJEDAHL GUSTAF LILJEDAHL By Mabel Liljedahl Long ago in a little cottage sur¬ rounded by firs and spruces, in the scenic land of our forefathers, in the Horeda (Church) forsamling, Jonkoping Lan, Sweden, there lived a family by the name of Janson. In¬ to this family there were born five sons and two daughters, Anne Stina, Carl, Maja Karin, John, Frank, Gus- taf, and Alfred. Father was born Feb. 12, 1848, and died March 20, 1918. In the fall of 1869, only the two youngest, namely Gustaf and Alfred, were still at home under the parental roof. The three oldest, Anne Stina, Carl and John, had married and established homes -of their own. Maja Karin, an older sister, had passed away recently. She had been frail since childhood, when scarlet fever left her blinded and in poor health. Frank was serving his year of military service demanded in Sweden of all you.ng men twenty one years of age. One afternoon, after tending to the animals in the barnyard sur¬ rounded by the typical criss-crossed log fence called “jorga^d,” Gustaf was talking to his brother, Alfred, gn his way to the house. “I saw Carl Olson as I was walk¬ ing home from church today and he had received a letter from his son in America. From all reports, that is the land of opportunity. You don’t have to work so hard and money is so easily earned, it just seems to grow on trees. There are vast prairies as far as eye can see. The best of all, you do not have to clear any timber. I would just like to try it and see what is was like.” Alfred agreed it would be some¬ thing to see. Both the boys had worked hard helping clear plots of ground for winter wheat planting. They had also been responsible for the family garden. The sc il was very rich, so in spite of the short season, large potatoes, carrots, pear, rutabaga and turnips (fed mostly to the cows) and “smultron” grew in abundance. That evening at the supper table the topic of America was discussed again. Gustaf argued that he would have to do something quickly or by next spring when he’d be twenty- one years of age, February 12, .he would have to “excera” (serve) his time in the government military training camp like all the rest of the young men. He hated the idea of giving his time to this monoton¬ ous training a.nd if he had to be away from home, he’d rather go to America. His mother knew that he !HAU:-iUIJ 1 hT& ID hhih&jiiJ lr*d& M ifH jiWIj owi r'flt ifU>8 i i ... . i ...f _ _ .

This premise he kept, although it was seven years later when he went back for this visit. When his brother, Frank, came home and found out Gustaf was go¬ ing, he too became interested, but how was he going to work it? In the army they had received their board and lodging but very little pay. Gustaf had been saving his pennies for a long time and by careful planning there was just enough money to pay for cne ticket. After much discussion it was de¬ cided Gustaf would go first, get a job and then he would send for his brother, Frans, and he wculd repay him later. It wouldn’t take long in America to repay the price of a ticket. Money was so easy to get, they had heard. It was with joyful heart that pre¬ parations were made for the jcur- ney. If there were any misgivings caused by limited funds, these were overshadowed by the thought of ad: venture, going to a new country and the many opportunities that were waiting. Gustaf tcld his mother “Don’t worry. You know I can take care of myself. I have two good hands. I’ve never been sick a day in my life and I’m not afraid of work.” Since there were so many John¬ sons and it was rather confusing when Gustaf went to get his ticket, he decided that he, tco, would change his name to iLiljedahl, be¬ cause that was the name his brother Frank, had selected when he took his military training. (In Sweden, the son’s name was usually different from the father’s, since it was the custom to take the first name of the father and add to it. Since John was a very common name, there were many John-sons.) His railroad ticket took him to Andover, Illinois, where there wai a Swedish settlement. With only a few pennies left in his pocketbook he started to search for work. No one wanted to hire .him because he was so small for his age. It seemed rather discouraging at first but one day his chance came. A man came and needed someone to scoop corn. No one else was available, so Gustaf was asked if he thought he could do it. The reply was “I’ll try.” He soon demonstrated that he wasn’t afraid cf hard work. After that day he always had a job. His em¬ ployer complimented him with the remarks, “you’re the best worker I ever had.” Gustaf’s answer was, “a small per¬ son can do a lot while a larger one turns around.” Farm helpers’ wages were not very high at that time. During the winter months, Gustaf was one of many seeking werk in the Illinois coal mines. The fabulous price of $1.00 a day was to be had here, but at what back-breaking pace. The workers had to work in stoop¬ ed positions from dawn until eve, so it was very strenuous, but scon the money had accumulated and .he could send for his brother, Frank. What a joyful day when the bro¬ thers were together. Now it was better because they were a team to share their wonders and joys of the new wcrld. They were constant¬ ly looking for new opportunities, so, when they heard that help was needed in the Kansas wheatfields the following summer, they moved westward. After the harvest, they found work on the railroads. How¬ ever, it was so dry and hot in this area neither one liked it. They knew what they wanted but they hadn’t found it yet. They were on the lookout for some rich, fertile farm land where they could invest their savings. They decided to go into Iowa and see how they liked it there. The result was that they lo¬ cated in Page County, six miles northeast of Essex, Iowa, near the fertile valley of the Nishnabotna river.

It was now seven years since Gustaf had left home, so he decided that he would take a trip, visit the folks and tell them of all the won¬ ders of the new world. This he did in 1876. When he returned, he was accompanied by a very good friend . of the family, who, later became sister Annie, as she was married to his brother Frank. In 1877, Gustaf was united in marriage to Lovisa Johnson who had come to this country from her home in Ramqvilla, Sweden, at the age of twelve. At first she made her home with an aunt, but at an early age she had to make her own way. At this time she was a quiet, reserved a'nd industrk us girl of twenty. They were married in Red Oak, Iowa, by the Reverend J. E. Rehnstrom. Their honeymoon con¬ sisted of a ten-mile ride to the little house that meant home. Another room had been added in preparation fcr the coming of the bride. (Sev¬ en years later with the increase of me family the little house was again remodeled to include a living room and upstars.) The hillside had been planted with friut trees, apples, peaches, plums and cherries and in years to come springtime transform¬ ed it into one lovely garden filled with the fragrance of pink and white blosscms. There was plenty of work in those earlier years. Keeping house was a real problem. Without modern con¬ veniences, much energy was ex¬ pended doing the daily tasks. Bak¬ ing bread, churning butter, curing meat, tending gardens, raising chickens, canning and drying friut, besides quilting, cheese making, .ewing, mending shoes, were onlv a few of the many duties that had to be dt ne besides caring for the growing family. To be a pioneer homemaker was not always easy. Now the two brothers, Gustaf .and Frank had sent for the thi>- brother, John, and his family. Soon they settled in the same vicinitv abc ut a mile away. What wonderful cooperative spirit they had! They exchanged work on the farm, in time of trouble they helped one another and shared each others joys and sorrows. Later, the three brothers sent for their sister, Anna Stina, and her family of five children. Gustaf and his bride (my father and mother) took an active part in the Fremont Lutheran Church at Nyman, Iowa. Their family of eight children were all baptized, confirm¬ ed and active members of this church. This church was organized by Reverend Dahlset in 1870, about one-half mile north of Nyman. Later it was moved to the present site. Father was always considered one of the chief pillars of this church. For thirty-two he was serving on the Board of Administration in the capacity of a deacon. In the minis¬ ter’s absence, father often conduct¬ ed the service as the deacons used to do. He was very good at ex¬ temporaneous talks. I remember once, someone thought he was a visiting minister. He enjoyed using illustrations to get his point across. In his later years he took a trip ot California. The Rockies made a deep impression. He used to quote this verse, “Bergen ma vika ocn Hogarna falla, evigt min nad cch min trofasthet ar, Aldrig forbundet af frid skall ftrfalla, Sa sager Her- ren min Fralsare kar.” Nothing kept father away from church except an occasional bliz¬ zard. One time when the roads were too rough to drive, father walked the four miles to church. If we were at home on Sunday, devitions were held for one hour or more while all of us children sat quietly listening. Since it was usually a lengthy sermon read out of the “Postilla,” nothing was said if we hanpened tc fall asleep. If there was any job to be done, father was never too busy to do it. He visited the sick and the aved. He always helped someone. Many is the time he ground two sacks of wheat, one fi r his own family and the other one for a needy neighbor. 21 , ,, jjfj • !< ft 11 *>’ •’ .i ; • * ' h ‘ ,ro bool-3ri »UkiwH Jo *tfiU ,r • )o f i.n «ioie bun -i mi* b‘ - ' * 0 • ,<>* • ■->! *J*“ ;j lilwow j td aid i >d moil riJfi) *»_ fj ... m }r /f .'ml ; funy.LUiJ. inoii.j'i • .*« ■ a, .

Sev¬ eral years I can remember him get¬ ting up at four o’clock to collect the cream and get the ice and superin¬ tend the freezing of twenty gallons or more of ice cream. This was no small job, as it all had to be done by hand. Morning worship was always held regardless of hew busy the day. If visiting men came to help with threshing, they were invited into the house, but nothing ever inter¬ rupted this wonderful custom of saying thanks for the night that had gone and invoking the blessings on the new day. Father liked to read. He always read the daily papers, keeping up with current events, and always subscribed to “Hemlandet” and “Augusta;na.” He enjoyed his li¬ brary of good religious books. Fa¬ ther appreciated music. He could sit by the hour and listen to me play. He had a good bass voice for sing¬ ing, and often sang many of his favorite pslams by heart. Commun¬ ity activities were part of his busy life. He was one of the supervisors of the Sta.nton Orphanage for many years. He was always a School Board member and Road Supervisor too. Father was a good business man¬ ager. He knew farming from A to Z. By experience and some innate abil¬ ity he knew how to select good seed corn and how to rotate crops to the best advantage. He was an expert cattleman and was known for hav¬ ing some of the best Poland China hogs in Page County. Father and mother had twenty- five years of happiness together. There were eight children — Claus, Luther, Ida, Amanda, Hannah, Carl, Elmer, Mabel. At the present time only four are living. In 1902, sister Hannah, then aged sixteen, and mo¬ ther, only forty-five years of age, passed away six weeks apart. This was very hard on father as he was left with a large family to raise, but Ida, my oldest sister, with the help of sister Amanda, took over the management of the home and was like a mother to the younger child¬ ren. Father moved away from the farm in 1910 to make his home in Red Oak. Father passed away in 1918, at the age of seventy years. At this time sister Ida took sick, so she moved to Pasadena, Calif., for her health, but she never recovered and in 1924 she too, passed away at the age of forty-two years. 22 v < ft i <1 \\ 10 t 'tji n oj ■ & • f) Yfi^; ’’••*» • A- f, > ,> ev/i« ' . ,c n ;v > iTiTujD rit'W l n i>f! < :d jl'< U ' f.-><r« 6 ai;v/ *,H f -«'! «pCo< L.of;,d*j b o v;i, id >ie bfifi o i .oieim b»li'i*-»9iqc i TJiif brii ^d , ni? :<. o i< v ■' ihd ho 5 L bt-ri «,n MRS. ANNA CHRISTINA JOHNSON Mrs. Anna Christina Johnson Sister of the three Brothers By Selma Swanson Anna Strna as the brothers always affectionately called their sister was born in Jonkopings (county) lan, Sweden, August 28, 1828. She passed away April 7, 1912 at the age of 83 years, 7 months and 9 days. Aunt Anna Stina, whom we the children of the first generation in this country called “Faster” (mean¬ ing aunt in Swedish) was older than her brcthers, my father being next to her. She came to America about 1879 or 1880 to join some of her children who had already immigrat¬ ed to America. There is no definite data about this but I do know that she brought her youngest son, Vic¬ tor, with her, who was at that time only a boy of about 11 years of age. In the beginning they stayed in my parental home until ether ar¬ rangements could be made. I do not know if Sophie and Gust came with her but I feel certain that some of her sons were here previous to her coming. She had five sons and a daughter. Their names were Alfred, Oscar, Gufetaf Ad( lph, Ferdinand Frederick, Sophie and Victor. 23 rxo*nrJofi uniiaiaO rmnA .a^i/ >*uii S io i i t«rM t/onA oL I »*ju ^ i j i -• ii’oHf. trb ^uwle riofttcid orif hg j;mi3 snnA m ,ai dt /id fart My aunt was at that time a little more than fifty years of age — an age when most women want to take life a little more easy — but her life be¬ came instead the life of pioneering. I remember my father saying she had a nice home and servants to help her as all people did in those days who were well-to-do in Swe¬ den. Her husband never came to this country not wanting to leave Sweden and his homeland. He lived in Sweden to ripe old age. My aunt first kept house for one sen and then another but it was her young¬ est son with whom she lived tfie longest — going with him to home¬ stead in Nebraska because land was cheaper there than in Iowa. They lived near Concord, then near Wau- sa. A number of years ago when Anna Stina visited us in Essex, Iowa, she told me many things about her life in Nebraska. She told of the loneliness and dreatjness and all the hardships. She related how the water scarcity was acute. It was so scarce she had to use dish¬ water from one meal to another, In another article in this booklet Emma C. Liljedahl has written some of “faster’s” experiences in Nebras¬ ka. She told me that there was no church when they came and that she was a charter member of the Lutheran church in Wausa and was there when the first parsonage was built. Aunt was a~ woman of staunch character who brought up her chil¬ dren in a God-fearing way and what a recompense it must have been to her to see them prosper and become landowners, much due to her help, I feel sure. After she and her son, Victor, had lived in Nebraska for a time they moved back to Iowa where Victor bought a fine farm north of Red Oak, where he prospered. Later Victor sold this farm and moved to Sweden where he bought a very nice place and married and lived there. This, I think was in the early 1900’s. It was after that Aunt moved to her daughter’s, Mrs. Victor Fors- berg, in Laurel, Neb., to make her home. That she longed for her youngest son to come back to her was net to be wondered — him with whom she had worked and planned; her baby, the youngest of her children. Aunt died April 7, 1912, at the age of 83 years, 7 months and 9 days. She was brought back to Iowa where she first came and rests in Mt. Hope cemetery, Fremont, Ny¬ man, Iowa, beside her two sons, Frederick and Oscar, who died in July 1880, and Fred, who died Nov. 18, 1895. Thus I have tried to give a brief sketch of one of God’s noble wom¬ en, one who never shirked her re¬ sponsibilities. May her children’s children remember that she was one who helped build up the beautiful country which they now enjoy — ev¬ en to bringing the seeds for some of the trees that are now standing. She battled life alone for her fam¬ ily without support of a husband. Let us never forget what our par¬ ents and grandparents have done for us. All honor to “Faster” Anna Sti- na’s memory! 24 ' orfft isiitel wdfnsmji i o> i,;m li ,/lo 1 J-.v* it.j c, J jJf|6 orit asiJV/ 3»rit H'tkt ink A .Mud idtosiftrio ‘smsqttioiD'i b The Sons and Daughters of John Magnus Liljedahl A Storzj and Tribute to the Memory of mu eldest Brother -- Charles Liljedahl by Selma My brother was born Jan. 13, 1865 on the old homestead in Sweden where our parents began house¬ keeping. At his christening he was given the name Carl Hjalmar Knut, but to us he was always known as Charlie. The story I am about to relate consists of incidents which come to my memory as well as some mater¬ ial which has been told to me. Charles was a lad of five years when we came to America with our mother, an older sister, Ida, and a younger brother, Frank. Father had arrived in the U. S. one year before and had settled in Moline, Ill., where the family was to live for a while. At times Charles would open up and tell some of the experiences after the family had been re-united in Moline. Impressed in his mem¬ ory especially was the jubilation and rejc icing after the year’s separ¬ ation. Swanson The winters were very severe in those years of pioneering and the housing conditions were very poor. The house in which they were to live that first winter was very much in disrepair so that the snow would drift through the walls and roof. Many were the times mother would go to the attic room and shake off he snow from the comforters be¬ fore the two boys were aroused out of their sleep. Charles said: “It’s a wonder we did not freeze to death.” After three years in Moline the family moved westward in March, 1873, settling on a farm in Page County, Iowa, five miles northeast of Essex, which was at that time a small village. It was on the farm that Charles grew to manhood. On several occasions he related that he did a man’s work at the age of 11 years, plowing or performing any « ther duties necessary on a farm. Days on the pioneer farm were strenuous, and all the children from 25 !* jo'i •.’/(! . J htnv 'll 'Mi' •,<*} >T i I v. ^ti. j*o’t i£i i vh. ml jfL i<:.. the oldest to the youngst had to do their share in the making of the home. The unity of purpose and action made for a happy home life. Charles, Ida’s and Frank’s educa¬ tion began in a private house, then in a log house with three trunks cut in half for benches. Later a school house was built, the Lone Star school, located one-fourth mile from our home. All we seven chil¬ dren attended school there. A school boy’s life in those days was not an easy one. Always there were chores to do, cows to milk, horses to feed and water before starting to school. This was during the three coldest months because during corn-husking in the fall and early spring work, there was no time Lr school. My oldest bro¬ ther was always kind and consider¬ ate of me when I began going to school. He would take me by the hand and lead me through the snow and over the hard-crusted snow¬ drifts. Charles was ambitious and want¬ ed an education. At one time his desire was to become a pastor in the Lutheran church. If he could not realize that ambition, he wished to enter some other profession. Fa¬ ther had other thoughts, however, and voiced his objections by saying there was too much responsibility connected with the profession of the ministry. My brother had a very kind and sympathetic nature, had a deep desire to help others, and he was yearning for a special way to serve mankind. At the early age of 20 Charlie attended Luther Academy at Wa- hoo, Nebr. This school had re¬ cently been established by the pio¬ neer Lutheran people of Nebraska for the education of their children. Mother was very lonesome for Charlie while he was away at school. He had always been such a comfort to her. He did not get to .go to school for any length of time because our father needed him at home on the farm. Whenever mother was in difficul¬ ty and needed help, I remember her saying, “I’ll tell Charlie, and he will help me.” After our oldest sister, Ida, died, mother looked to Charlie for help in the home. He even used to help her by running the sewing machine for her when making tucks in our dresses. He did this while the other men rested during the noon hour. In my mind’s eye I can still see him sitting at the machine. It was the chief concern of our parents as well as of most the peo¬ ple of that day to give their chil¬ dren religious instruction. Conse¬ quently, he and brother Frank were sent to a Swedish parochial school five miles away. They would walk to the homes of friends who lived near the schoolhouse Monday morn¬ ings and then home again Friday nights. Charles used to relate how glad the two brothers were to get he me and have ‘‘something good to eat.” Then came the confirmation in¬ struction which was preparation for being received into membership of the Lutheran church. This instruc¬ tion was given by a young pastor, Rev. N. G. Dahlstedt. (I remember him as being a very handsome man.) Our church of the Augustana Synod had been organized in 1876. It was and still is called the Fre- rmnt church as well as Nyman. This church was situated five miles directly east of our home. Our par¬ ents were among the first members there. Rev. Dahlstedt left the church before finishing the confirm¬ ation course, so another pastor at Eetliesda church, ten miles south¬ east, continued. Charles was con¬ firmed and received into church membership at Fremont church April 30, 1882. The minister at Bethesda chifrch was Rev. Nils Forsander, later D. D. and theological professor at Augus¬ tana Seminary, Rock Island, Ill. He was a grand man, and he and his wife visited in our home. I heard mother say that Charles received a deep and lasting impression from 26 ui 1 ■> aUw*0 .s0ttb9 rtBii i’i ha. * • b i-4*J .euiioii ,ij „)1 j:*rt ai Ibj ’ ■ if <! -iiWiA ni> Y I, r I'll., bl'; >W T . -;*v 1 - ■ ^ ** -f ^ *^0 ci Jrfgfiojj tol'00 bill lo dSU vf’III9 dff) JA ■‘J ; -c.i-i inil - f rbrnb «' '» r;n tmt bjW ri Tni OS J tr-i.V ,J fi ■ : »’< -i.‘ m ,n *•. ■ ► • WTf’ff l i*ri! r.» jjifii.fi fs noi^iquu ,m tetu bac qwn -h/oilVih ft. *gv; tkIRmh wv-nilW as that time from the instruction of Dr. Forsander. To his dying day, Char¬ lie was a staunch church member in everything that word implies. Yes, he truly loved his church. Charles was very particular and even fastidious in his dress as a young man. Those were the days of white vests, white starched shirts, cuffs and collars. In those days young men dressed that way every Sunday. I remember mother la¬ boring very hard because “Charlie is so particular.” Naturally a mother wishes to have her children look well, and I do not know that that much work was put on the shirts for the men of our household. Char¬ lie’s habit of being neatly dressed was with him throughout his whole life. Soon the time came when Charles wanted to marry and establish his own home. At the age of 24 he was married to Emma Carlson of Essex, Iowa. At the time of their meeting, Emma was a teacher in the Lone Star school and also a teacher ol music in the neighborhood. At one time she roomed and boarded in our home and it was then they fell in love. I’ll never forget how she couid sing and play and how the young people would come to our home to gather around the organ and sing. It was quite unusual at that time to have an instrument in the home. On Oct. 18, 1889, Charles and Em¬ ma, her sister Jennie, our brother Frank, and my father drove to Red Oak where Charlie and Emma were quietly married at the Lutheran parsonage, the Rev. J. A. Ryden performing the ceremony. Mother had a wedding supper ready when they returned with chicken and trimmings prepared. An atmosphere of festivity prevailed. That was the first marriage in the John Liljedahl family, and Charlie was the first to leave the parental home. Young as I was, I remember my mother saying in Swedish to them in parting: “Never cmarrel but love one another and all will be well.” Advice which was given then is just as good now for a couple who are beginning wedded life. Their first home was in West Township, about six miles north of Essex, and five miles northeast of our parental home. There was a new house, barn and cribs. The . house contained two rooms down¬ stairs and two on the second floor. It was not long before Emma had made it into an inviting home, for she had good taste, and it was a home where we loved to visit. I can truly say that we were always welcome. I was then about 14 years of age. On Oct. 3, 1890, their first child, a son, was born. There was a great rejoicing upon his arrival. He was named John Mauritz, and he was the only grandchild our mother liv¬ ed to see. I can see mother holding the little more than year-old in her arms just a short while before she passed away in 1891. A second son, Harry, was born on this farm. He also was heralded with delight by us all. Since Charles was the first in the family to be married, we thought of him and his family as belonging to us. Charles bought an unimproved farm at Elliott, Iowa, in 1893 or thereabouts. It was near his cous¬ in’s, Fred Johnson. Possibly being near his cousin prompted him to again build a home from the bot¬ tom. (Cousin Fred died shortly af¬ ter his marriage and settlement in his new home.) Charlie told me once, “I have built up three places where there was not a stick before.” This meant a tremendous lot of work. A farm¬ hand who was with his family for years, was good, faithful, and de¬ pendable Martin Edquist. The farm help problem was not as acute then as now. Young women were avail¬ able also, so Emma had plenty of help in her younger days. An< Iher bqy, Julius, came to bless the home in 1 894b and Paul ar¬ rived in 1896. These two were born in Elliott. On this farm they lived 27 ’JfiirifU&Ol! .»dm ba* mad . w3t; .r* ■ br. . *ai> j rt *a«m3 t»iOi‘Ki jj v)i i n r,v j] vi va j«itr t^r. .••_>*:> iuna iibu.'r . .u-w j h cil ,‘iia/j ; no. b. rt . ’* ^Y. j' ‘Cfi. r J(ij W l 'ill , 7/ lil ibfitorn i win ji i ns £ yU&uHI ^oof T^'biiito t ; avnii tr.rli |Brir //ofjjf Ion of) i . ortJ; a i ji q new tf ju .v ii.) ;rn u i'J .bi ids. nor 7.70 to m m adi iol >a muo'dif c a: ( t •• r . w onu ,U*iw ibw sir; oil rr. * * I Mb . x. ae ; r{ £2 ’ ’§r urlJ £■ m >i i 'o /Jt- o jet • ? i . ■■• ‘j rtoj tJ ai ’sariJtbl b *#tw am . ■ • uod l' Hi f ‘uno<n s »f« w» ij •il tiri-j n*>< w dsO n o f> fj fnimrtol i*mi Yti.nut and prospered. Had it not been that the family lived so far from a church of their own denomination and the wish to rear their children in the iLutheran faith, they might have remained in Elliott instead cf locating near the home town of Essex. There was a small Lutheran church at Rhensburg, Iowa, some 10 miles from their Elliott home which they attended when roads a.nd wea¬ ther would permit. Here they found some very good friends and inti- ‘ mate friendships were formed which lasted throughout life. Frequent trips were made by fa¬ ther, our younger brother, Joseph, siste Emily and myself to Charlie’s home. Sometimes Frank would ac¬ company us but either he or father had to remain at home with the hired man to take care of things. Leaving on Saturday it would take all day, with a short stop in Red Oak for noon dinner, to cover the 25 miles. Father always enjoyed these trips and visits which lasted a couple cf days. It was on several of these visits that we became acquainted with Rev. B. M. Halland, a grand old man, a pioneer pastor, who had or¬ ganized all the Lutheran churches in the Stanton district. He would come as often as he could to hold services in my brother’s home. To these services friends and neighbors were invited. In 1901 my brother bought a large farm of 600 acres, one mile .north of Essex, and again he began t- build from the bottom. There were only some dilapidated buildings on the land which necessitated a new set cf buildings entirely. The undertaking of building the eight- room residence, barn, and all the other necessary buildings for the farm was a tremendous task. This home was considered the last word in farm homes. The acetylene light plant which was installed, lighted the home a.nd barns at night and made it appear like a small village. Success and a happy life for them all came after much hard labor. The fifth son, Robert, was born in April, 1901, and in 1903, George, was born. There were now six boys to clothe, feed, and educate. All six attended grade and high school at Essex. Mauritz attended Luther Academy at Wahoo, Nebr., for a time and later attended the State College. Paul also studied at Bethany College, Lindsborg, Kan. All this meant a great deal of expense, but the parents were thorough believers in education. I shall relate one incident in bro¬ ther’s life. In 1904 he met with an accident, being kicked by a horse which resulted in a broken leg. This accident occurred a couple days af¬ ter his wife, accompanied by three or four of the children, had depart¬ ed for a visit with her sister in Spo¬ kane, Wash. This left the work in charge of Mauritz, the eldest son. Somehow Emma could not be reach¬ ed by wire to return so I took our son, then four, to Charlie’s to care for him. My husband, as the doc- tur, set the fracture and eventually brother recovered with a perfectly functioning leg. By the ' time his wife returned he was up and about. My brother did his utmost to make it pleasant cn the farm for his family. I remember well the beautiful team of black horses hitched to a lovely carriage in which the whole family came to church Sunday mornings. How proud he was of his family! Later he drove a beautiful Hudson super- six and he also provided Ford cars for the boys. These years on the farm were the best of his life as well as the most strenuous. In due time each of the sons married. In 1920 my brother and his wife retired fre m the farm and made their home in Essex. In 1921 a beautiful residence was erected where they were to spend their de¬ clining years. It was a lovely home and both took great pride in plant¬ ing trees, shrubs, and flowers, of which both of them were fond.

This home was near the church they both loved so well. When in 1926 the old church build¬ ing burned to the ground, Charles was among the first to clear away the debris and to help make plans for the new church. There was no stinting of time, work or money on his dear church. The immediate years after his re¬ tirement from the farm home were spent in helping his sons in one way or another. He was also an officer and founder of a grain elevator company. He was clerk of Pierce Township for many years. He was elected to the town council of Es¬ sex and held that position for many years. He held responsible offices in the church, being secretary for many years as well as serving as trustee. He was chosen a deacon at the time of his death. The last years of his life he filled the office of Essex’ mayor with great credit. His was a busy life, a useful life. He was clean throughout, in speech, in morals, and he never indulged in tobacco or intoxicants. Being human, he had his faults, and he would be the first to admit them. Charlie’s and Emma’s silver wed¬ ding anniversary occurred while they were still on the farm, Oct. 18, 1914. At that time they were hon¬ ored by being given a “surprise” party by the St. John’s congregation of Essex, the pastor being Dr. J. A. Holmen. A large number of friends and relatives were present from far and near, and it was no doubt the big event of their lives. Dr. Holmen gave a beautiful address, I recall. Gifts of one dozen sterling silver knives and forks and a beautiful candelebra were presented to them. All six of their sons were present, making it a fine family group, in¬ deed. Charlie’s three brothers and two sisters with their families were .present at the fine farm home. I would like to inject here that we as a family of brothers and ' sisters were always very close and visited together frequently, as our father admonished us to do. In this home many good times were enjoyed . Much was due to brother Charlie’s efforts in keeping up the brotherly spirit. He was al¬ ways interested in our affairs and welfare and up to the last made .inquiries about each one. My hus¬ band and I missed the Christmas letter he wrote us every year. Later Emma always wrote the letter. Bro¬ ther Charlie was originator of the the first Liljedahl family reunion about 1924. These were held annu¬ ally at different places for many years. It is to be hoped that these reunions will again be established. I believe the first reunion was held in their farm home, and one of the late ones at their home in Essex. One summer in the early ’20’s, they took a long trip to California together where they visited rela¬ tives and also traveled in the north¬ west. It was an unforgettable time for them and one which they en¬ joyed. Often Charlie was a delegate to conference and synod meetings. In 1932 when the synod met in Fargo, N. D., brother Joseph gave Charlie and Emma a trip to the convention which was to be his last one. Jo¬ seph came from Salina in his car and brought them to Sioux City where they all spent the evening and night with us. On the follow¬ ing day the trip was continued to Fargo where they enjoyed a very nice time together and 'with other old friends. On the return trip they also stepped over night, and they spoke of the delightful time they had together on that journey. (In passing, I will say that brother Jo¬ seph has given us all delightful trips at different times.) Time passes on. In the month of August, 1933, we were making a brief visit in Essex, and I noticed a great change had come over my brother. It was a late Sunday af¬ ternoon when we called at their home. They had just returned from a picnic with the childrtln and 29 bsriaiflo Zl'.otl) fasqjd 'jd oJ *i Jl .gin «y ni *fflt.-d ii-jds ;c i »r,.> .thiwh T': .B -.irf i «eUi ifittfi ‘Jii.ibij.a/tu oriT ’t«sw »£to rti >j>x ■rsoiftc nc oeu; *sw >H lo i )bauol bna to jItjTo aevv .yn/sqm-; ymx.. *r lot qtrisawtfT rr 1u li jnxjoj m M £jrli oJ bafcwCd •»ll f Mm :; Ui» r> mr t*W j -'8 m ;tfOfl8L.o*ri)| ncofo £uw jH ‘ 98!>;bni I >iiriv be\"* .

When I met him, I saw he looked extremely tired and anxious, yes, ill. He said nothing about it, however, not being the sort of perso.n to complain. Only a cou¬ ple weeks later, he, his wife, and son Julius, came to our home in Sioux Sity to seek medical advice from my husband. After a complete examination, it was disclosed that his condition was very serious, that tne dread disease, cancer, had struck, and that his days would not • be very many here an earth. We were grief stricken, and I for one refused to believe that it could be so, but the diagnosis proved to be correct. Charles remained with us for a few days. One evening while I was sitting with him on the porch, ne opened up his heart to me and spoke, “I have had wonderful health all my life for which I am thankful to God. I have worked like a slave all my days and have always been glad I could work. We have been blessed abundantly in the past but these last three years have been hard for me.” (he referred to finan¬ cial matters.) “I have never squan¬ dered anything on myself cr my family. We tried to do the best we could by giving our children good education and what we have given to church and community I do not regret. I am happy about that.” As I see it, his greatest fault, if it is a fault, was his kind-heartedness and too great an amount of gener¬ osity. I believe he was a worthy example to his children and family and to those with whom he came in contact. Brother Gust once said to me in referring to Charlie, “Yes, he was the best one one in the ‘bunch’ cf us” — meaning we brothers and sis¬ ters, of course. After a few days’ stay in our home, we knew nothing could be done for him but to ease the pain and suffering which inevitably comes with the dread disease. I will never fcrget the look in his eyes as he left us, and he said the one word “farewell” in that kind voice of his. I am certain he knew then that his days would not be many. He was glad and happy that he could be in the home he loved so w.ell with his beloved wife, and also that he was able to take care of himself, as he told me on one of cur visits. He sat before the fire¬ place in their living room, and many were the friends who made him happy by calling on him. His children and their families did as much as possible to make his last days on earth comfortable. He men¬ tioned one time that his grand¬ daughter, Marilyn, was so faithful in ceming to see him every day aft¬ er school. He also spoke of the kindness of his brother in law, John G. Carlson. My last visit to him was on Dec. 17, 1933, and his passing to his eter¬ nal reward came just before mid¬ night, Dec. 22, 1933, at the age of 68 years, 11 months, and nine days. The day of his burial was beauti¬ ful, clear but very cold. That did not deter those with whom he had come in contact during a long life in the community and his beloved St. John’s church coming to fill the sanctua'ry to overflowing. Many relatives and friends came to pay thei respects and to say a heartfelt farewell to Charlie. A tribute from the pastor of the church, Rev. M. A. Johnson, was read, and I think it was a true char¬ acterization. “Mr. Liljedahl was a quiet, softspoken, and unassuming man who loved his home, his com¬ munity, and his church. That he held the confidence of all who knew him has been shown by the many positions of trust and confidence he held during the many years of active service among us.” Our bro¬ ther, Rev. Joseph Liljedahl, also gave a tribute to our brother. Now Charles is resting beside his wife who went to join him in 1942. 30 )c uJ h’ivuiq :lrl' I -1* : • • WJ li i ' ... liu | > ‘ \\ < / ■i3Blno9 m w n ; orfw He 1o 'oayfeilm.j irU bfa i id ,a$Y • .piiiAdO oi iumiijrr ■*ii fa* it* RisfS icf - .mo** m oi . -v,a . ;.i,J jg? *wmf*ue er Qi ffirff J> of. ot fn*)'// atfvt lS T d ,;ii* .Tmoo A Memorial Tribute to Emma Carl¬ son Liljedahl, Wife of Charles Liljedahl by Selma Swanson Emma Christina Carlson was born Feb. 24, 1866, in Djursdala, Kalmar lan (county) Sweden. She came with her parents to America in 1867. They first lived in Burlington, la., for a time. At the tender age of 13 her mother died. Emma was the oldest of three children, having one sister, Jennie, and a brother, John. A couple of years after her mother passed away, her father remarried; from that time Emma was on her own, making her own living. Meanwhile her father had recog¬ nized her musical ability and let her study music, which was not usual in that day. At the age of 14 she became organist in Messiah Lutheran church of Burlington, the church which the family had joined when they came to this country. She held this position for two years. She was confirmed in that church, also attended grade and high school in Burlington. May, 1882, the family moved to Hss^ex;,, Iowa,, whqre her father owned and operated a blacksmith shop. Here they joined St. John’s church and a few months later Em¬ ma became the organist. She served in that capacity for several years. When she finished high school, she attended Normal school and acquired a diploma to teach. It was while teaching in Lcne Star school that she and my brother met. She also taught music in the neighbor¬ hood, brother Charlie being one of her pupils. Being a teacher in country schools in that day was arduous. Besides teaching the children, she had to make and maintain fires in the stove, shcvel ashes and sweep the schoolhouse unless the pupils would help. There were no janitors in those days. Winters were very severe. Snow was deep but some¬ times a hard crust would form on top, and that would make walking very easy. All we four younger children attended school under her as well as taking music lessons from her on our reed organ which was one of the first in that community. At least I am certain it was the first among the Swedish people in •Fremont. She was a very pretty girl and sang very well when a young girl. Her dresses were very pretty, and she made them herself. She did a lot of handiwork, crocheting trim¬ mings Lr her own clothes as well as helping mother with lace trim¬ mings for the clothes of her two girls, my sister and myself. Such deeds cling to one’s memory, and many were the nice things she did for us when she was young and had the time. Oct. 18, 1889, she and Charles were married and lived together 44 years. Emma had never lived on farm, and no doubt it was not an easy task for her, but she rose to the occasion. I am certain that bro¬ ther’s success was due to her help in being economical and thrifty at that time when it was necessary. I know she helped him to keep rec¬ ords befcre the family grew up and the work increased. There were always hired men to cook for and during the years when the children were small, it sometimes meant two or three men besides their own family. There was always plenty of food cn her table and that alone was a tremendous task. She did have help most of the time, how¬ ever. It was one ofthose girls who once said, “Mrs. Liljedahl was al¬ ways kind to her help, she was easy to work for, and there was never any quarreling heard between husband and wife like so many of the places where I have worked.” This is a great tribute to her, I think. She was always considerate of cld people, those who had little means, and the sick. She always inquired about anyone who was ill. I want to mention how kind 31 r •/ V.M.X ow 1J A . icR j \\ l©7 )o *>!

Her sister and children who lived in Omaha ofter stayed all summer with Fyn- ma. In her younger days she was very hospitable entertaining large number of 40 relatives or so at a time which meant much extra work. One incident which has always meant much to me was the time my mother was taken sick with pneumonia. Charlie then lived six miles northwest of our home, and when the word came to them that mother was very ill, both of them with their son, Mauritz, little more than a year old, came to our home to stay and help us. It was Emma who read from the Bible, helped mother repeat the confession and pray the Lord’s prayer not very long before mother went to be with the Lord. It is these things that never fade out of one’s mind. Will not the Lord remember these services? I often think that the work of raising a large family and all the work an the big farm was too much for Emma’s frail shoulders. Her hands were seldom idle, until the later years perhaps. She either sewed, crocheted, pieced quilts, or mended. She was a lover of flowers and always had plants in the house and outdoors which seemed to thrive under her care. She loved to read. Both she and Charlie read much and kept up both with their church and affairs of the world. She was a very good conversationalist and had a memory like few. She was a member of the Womans’ Mission¬ ary Society, and its secretary for 20 years. She loved to attend the conventions. Both she and Charlie liked to travel and see things. In the 20’s they went to California and Spo¬ kane. Wash. Years ago she took the younger children with her and spent a couple of months with her sister Jennie who at that time lived in Spokane. It was a lovely thing to do because her sister was sick unto death and passed away while Emma was there. Many were the shorter trips they made and nearly always they went together. One winter they each wrote a brief family history and presented it to their son, Robert, on his birth¬ day. It is well written in longhand by each of them. I think it is in Robert’s possession now. I happen¬ ed to read it one time when I wanted some information about the family. They spent their declining years in the lovely home in Essex near Ithe church. After her husband’s death she lived alone a little more than nine years. During that time her children came to visit her as often as possible. At times she made visits in their homes. During her last years of illness she was cared for in the home of her son, George, who then lived in Strahan, Iowa, and whose wife is a nurse. She also visited for a long period of time in her eldest son, Mauritzs’ home, and in the homes of Paul, Robert, and Julius, she made visits. 32 '.vo'r u biiii . . o V:f ()i: lot vie; io*)- an hnr I y it, lo ^Lip£l Wfirr. lor* oi etw aiis jivsaiiOAt oiit .noff 'idD ilwisg crfcaiO ni bavU. offv/ noiLlub bns - rd ri.'iw i&mrrio 1» , b-i^B fa isllo ■' ! , li usiidbi*} 9id il.qaoi .0/ o) JiVdw • ‘jdJ a ->i <! *>o aavilsbi 3£ lo nomua ••>.{ riJ .v -sfiln.-in H) olqt-n s .t. . toil* )(iJ e"
