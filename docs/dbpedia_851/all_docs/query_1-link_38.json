Since this bpccies-list was compiled from the literature and W’as not based on the ‘^tudy of actual speci- mens, its value could be only temporary. Following publication of these papers, morphological studies^ have been completed of all known species of Taphrina, and it is now possible to undertake a thorough revision of the genus. In certain cases the results of inoculation-expenments would be helpful in reaching decisions on the identity of species, but for the most part delimitation of species can be made on morphological grounds. Interesting as biologic relationships will prove, their elucidation is not likely to result in either combination or division of morphologically evident species. Therefore, although many species of Taphrina have been obtained in culture, and host rela- tionships are being studied by means of inoculations, it seems un- necessary to await the results of these studies before proceeding to a revision of the genus. The present paper gives an account of all known species of Taph- rina. It is proposed to treat these species by host groups, discuss- ing first species occurring on ferns and then those on Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons, following the taxonomic arrangement of host genera. For nomenclature of w^oody plants Rchder’s Manual of Cultivated Trees and Shrubs has been consulted. Other higher plants have been named in agreement with Index Kewensis and ferns in accordance with the usage of the Gray Herbarium. In this revision an effort has been made to disturb existing situ- ations as little as possible, especially as regards division of species and erection of new species therefrom. In some cases description of new species has seemed unavoidable, and, on the other hand, it has sometimes seemed necessary to combine tw^o or more existing 1. These studies were made, for the most pait, during the penod 1936-11)40. They were aided by m;ycologists the world o\\er who sent ^aluable specimens as loans or giftb.

Linder was so kind as to make a^allable the facilities of the Farlow Herbarium durmg the autumn of 1939. Mix: Monograph op Genus Tapiirina 5 si)ccies into one. Many species of Taphrma have in the past been described as new without due regard to existing species. In some cases occuri‘cn(‘e on a new host was considci'ed sufficient reason for erecting a new species. In other cases morphological peculiarities described by the auihor of a species have been found to disappear when a number of specimens are examined. Finally, in a few in- stances, spe(‘its were hastily and inaccurately described. Ill determining the validity of species the principle followed has been to treat as identical those forms that are morphologically similar and occur on related hosts. This is considered sound pro- cedure even when biological distinction is known to exist between different host- forms. The well known treatment accorded the rust fungi by workers within that group may be cited in defense of this point of view. In critical cases type specimens have been examined. This has not been thought nccessaiy in the case of old and well established species, much studied by earlier authors, such as Taphrina populina, T. (iejormam, T. pruni. Whenever possible study of the type speci- men has been supplemented by examination of a number of addi- tional speoiniens, which has invariably resulted in widening the limits of ascus-sizo given by the original authors. Often a similar correction has resulted from the study of the type specimen itself. The species dcscrii)tions, then, presented in this paper are in most cases revisions of the descriptions given by the original authors, and, being based on the study of as many specimens as possible, may bo accepted as accurate descriptions of the fungi concerned insofar as tliey are known. Mor]diological features considered in delimiting species are those used by all previous investigators: liabit of mycelium (whether in- tercellular, subcuticular, or growing within the host-cell wall), shape and size of asci, presence or absence of a stalk cell, shape and size of stalk cells, and (rarely) size of spores. CHAKACTER OF THE GENUS AND RELATIONSHIPS The order Taphrinales (Exoascalcs) of the Ascomycetes is com- monly held to contain but one family, the Taphrinacae (Exoascacae) Gaiimann (1926) includes a second family, the Protomycetaceae, with two genera: Protomyces and Taphridium, All members of the Protomycetaceae arc parasitic, causing galls within the tissues of higher plants. Species of Protomyces form in the tissues of their hosts large, round, thick-walled, overwintering chlamydospores.

Tlie tvpe •'pecies i- Taphina populina Fries. Fries first (1815) called this fungus Taphna populina aurea and subsequently (1825) changed the genus name to Taphrina, stating that Taphria had been used as an insect name. In Systenia Mycologicum (1832), Fric\" U''td the name Taphrina populina for thi« fungus. All known si>ccic‘5 of Taphina are parasitic, though susceptible (so far as investigated) of artificial cultivation in the asexual stage (Klebuhii, 1923, Alix, 1921, IViebon, 1927)®. Cultures may be ini- tiated by asco«poros * or by blastospores derived from them. Slow growing, yeast -like, pale pink colonies are foimod on vaiious media and cultures can apparently be propagated indefinitely. Colls formed in culture are chiefly blastospores (yeast cells or bud-coni- dia>, though occadonally short hyphae may be obseived, and thick walled “resting cells” are common. These “resting cells” arc bc- , lieved by the writer (hlix, 1924, 1935) to be a^cogenous cells like those formed beneath the cuticle of the host. Martin (1940), not finding bmucleate \"resting cells” in her cultures, believed them to be vegetative cells. In old cultures dicaiyotic hyphae (like those in host tissues) may occur, as well as ascogenous cells with fusing nuclei, and even imperfectly fomed asci. (Mix, 1935.)

In fact if a species of Taphuna were brought into culture uithoul knowledge of its previous parasitic existence, it would be called a species of Torulopsis, In some cases, as in Taphrina cpiphyllciy infection apparently occurs soon after ascosporc expulsion, but in other cases (presum- ably because host oigaiis arc susceptible only yhen young and ten- der), a ])enod of ovci summering and overwintering is undergone by the blaslospoies beloie infection. The occunencc of the ‘'yeast slage’’ seems to be im]>oitant in accomplishing =juivival during tlii-^ prolonged period apait from the ho'^t tisHies, For example, it is evident (Fitzpatrick, 1934, Mix, 1935) that Taphrina deformans can suivive as a yeast lor more than one year. Infection by blaslosporcs has been observed by Fitzpatrick (1934) and IMix (1935) in Taphrina dejormans. Successful in- oculation exiiciimcnts were performed by Sadebcck (1882) with Taphrina bidlata and IT. fosquinetii and later (1888, 1890) with T. epiphylla. Fisch (1885) also reports successful inoculations wutli T, tosquinetii and T. epiphylla. Klebalin (1923), inoculating from pure* culture, obtained infection wdth Taphrina tof^quinetii on Alnus gUdinosa, but failed in attempts wdth T. epiphyllaj T. sadc- bcckij and T. bclulina on tlieir resixictivc hosts. Wicben (1927) also used pure culliircs in her inoculation-expeiiiiienl'^, securing positive results with Taphrina tosquinetii, T. epiphylla, T. do- forinans; negative wdth T. popnlina {T. aurea), T. bidlata, and T. klcbahni. Species of Taphrina aie of llirec types as regards mycelial habit: intercellular forms {Taphrina deformans, etc.) developing abundant mycelium between the interior cells of leaf, stem, or fruit, and sub- sequently forming a subcuticular layer of ascogenous cells; sub- cuticular forms {Taphrina epiphylla, etc.) whose mycelium and ascogenous cells grow only beneath the cuticle; and w^all-inhabit- ing forms {Taphrina laurencia, etc.), living entirely wdthin the outer epidermal w^all of the host. In Taphnna maculans (Butler, The Univeesity Science Bulletin 1911) and T. linearis (Mix, 1939) this “wall-habit” is developed further. Flat bands of hyphae occur within radial walls between adjacent cells of the epidermis and of the underlying tissues. None of the intercellular or subcuticular forms is known to possess haubtoria but specialized haustoria have been reported (Butler, 1911) for T. waculans, and unspecialized haustoria for T. laurenda (Giesenhagen, 1892), T. osmundae and T. higginsii (Mix, J947). Mo's! wall-inhabiting foiTns produce numerous ascogenous cells within a wall locule (Mix, 1939) but in the two species just named a single multinucleate hyphal segment occurs in each wall locule and this later gives rise to a single ascus (Mix, 1947) . Intercellular mycelium of species of Taphrina is for the most part developed within the spaces between host cells, but in passage of an infection hypha inward through the epidermis, and (later on) of mycelium outward to form a subcuticular layer, growth occurs perforce within radial walls between epidermal cells. In discuss- ing Taphrina deformans, Martin (1940) states: “. . . vertical hyphae are found between radial walls of epidermal cells and not in these walls as described by Mix.” This is a contradiction in terms. With no radially-placed intercellular spaces between epi- dermal cells of the peach only one location is possible for the ver- tically-growing mycelium and this may be described either as “in the cell wall” or “between cell walls.” The writer’s expression was chosen since it is not known whether the mycelium of Taphrina deformans dissolves out the middle lamella or whether it may not also attack the cellulose membranes. Several species of Taphrina have been investigated cytologically. There is general agreement (Dangeard, 1895, Ikeno, 1901, duel, 1921, Martin, 1924, Eftimiu, 1927, Martin, 1940) that mycelium with the host tissues is dicarj'otic, each cell containing one or more pairs of nuclei which divide conjugately. Nuclear fusion occurs in ascogenous cells, as reported by Dangeard (1895) for T. de- formans and by duel (1921), Eftimiu (1927), and Martin (1924, 1940), for this and other species. The ascogenous cell is termed a chlamydospore by duel. In germination of the chlamydospore (ascogenous cell) two types of behavior have been observed, duel (1921) found that in Taph- rina epiphylla and in T. sadebeckk a pore forms in the outer wall of the chlamydospore, and the ascus emerges as a thin walled en- dospiore through this widening pore. IMix: ISIoNoc.RAPii OP Genus Taphrina 9 In other species: Taphrina betulirta, T. camea, Juel found that the chlainydospore itself elongates to form the ascus; its wall be- comes thinner in the process but does not rupture. Martin (1940) wilting of Taphrina deformans says: “After the nuclear fusion, the ascogenous cell elongates vertically and its thick wall is stretched to become the thinner wall characteristic of the ascus. The wall of the ascogenous cell does not break for the ascus to emerge as described by Pierce (1900) and Juel (1921).” Juel did not discuss Taphrina deformans in the paper referred to but Pierce (1900) writes as follows: “As already said, the walls of the ascogenous cells are heavy. The early steps in the development of the asci from these cells (the development of a papilla-like elevation on the upper surface of the cells) cause the rapture or the disso- lution of the heavy wall where the elevation occurs. The phe- nomenon is that of the germination of a heavy-walled spore, or perhaps, more properly, the outgrowth or prolongation of an en- (losi)ore through the rajiture of the epispore.” Whether the ascus of Taphrina deformans ever forms in this manner seems to be difficult to determine. In all preparations made by the writer the ascogenous cell elongates to an ascus, in the fashion described by Martin (1. c.) . If Pierce’s observations are correct they cannot hold true for the majority of asci. On the other hand, this phenomenon of ascus emergence by rup- ture of the chlamydospore wall (as described by Pierce for Taphrina deformans, and by Juel for T. epiphylla) is readily seen in certain other species. It has been observed (as noted below) in Taphrina tosquinetii, T. sadebeckn, T. amentorum, T. epiphylla, T. occi- dentalis, T. thomasii, T. acerina and T. acericola. Mciosis occurs in the young ascus (Juel, 1921, Eftimiu, 1927, Marlin, 1924, 1940). Eftimiu (1927) reports the diploid number for several species as four, while Marian (1940) reports it for Taphrina deformans as eight. Juel and Eftimiu find meiosis occurring in the first division of the fusion nucleus, Juel stating that in species possessing slalk cells the protoplasm migrates into the upper portion of the ascus before nuclear division, and that later an empty stalk cell is cut off. Martin (1924, 1940) reports that in T. coryli and T. deformans, the first division of the diploid ascus nucleus is mitotic and that the stalk cell possesses for a brief period a diploid nucleus and cytoplasm. These observations of Martin will, if con- firmed, be extremely important, sinee the occirrrenee of a diploid 10 The Unh’eesity Science Bulletin tliallus is rare among fungi, having been previously reported by Guilliermond and others for certain yeasts (Guilliermond, 1940), and by Guillicnnoiid (1928) for Spemopthora gossypii. A close relation between the Tai)hrinalcs and the Saccharoinycetales uould bo indicated. Ascoi'pores arc uninucleate and haploid, as arc the blastospores derived from them. The dicarjmtic condition sceras to be attained in most species (Eftimiu, 1927, and others) by nuclear division, a dicaryon thus being a pair of sister nuclei. In Taphnna epiphylla {T. klehahni is, as will appear later, a synonym) Wieben (1927) reported conjugation between sexually different ascospores (or blastospores) and development of a dieary- otic hypha from the fusion-cell. (Presumably this is the infection thread but the point has not been determined.) Wicben’s obser- vations were confirmed by the writer (1935). Conjugation has not been obsenud as occurring regularly in any other species, though it seems to occur rarely in Taphrinn defor- mans (Mix, 1935). With this fungus, however, infection has been obtained by Fitzpatrick (1934) and the writer (1935) using cul- tures derived from single ascospores.

In the species list previously published (Mix, 1936a), Taphrina struthiopteridis Siemaszko was, on the basis of Siemaszko’s descrip- 14 The University Science Bulletin lion, held to be distinct from T. struihiopfcrldifi Nidiida, and Ihc fungu*:! therefore renamed Taphrina sicmafizk'oi. Riemabzko de- scribed thi^s fungus as Laving asci 28rJ0[;. X and did not men- tion a stalk cell, while Ni&hida’s fungus was described as having a^ci 16-2S[jl X with stalk cells 4-7g X In a letter accom- panying his type material Sicma‘-zko stated that hib inc'asuremenis had been wrong, giving the following as correct: Asei 17.5-32[;, X 6-7.5[jl, again not mentioning the stalk cell. He said further that his iungus was probably identical with T. stnithioptcridis Nishida. Stud}’ of the material obtained from Siemaszko, and of duplicate material in the Farlow Herbarium showed asci 17-28[jlX 5-7ijl, and stalk cells 4-7;j, X 3-()g. It is not possible to distinguish from each other the fungi under dbeu^^sion either on the basi^ of host lesions or of size and shape of asci and stalk cells. They are therefore held to be the same species. Since Kishida described his two fungi in tlie same paper i1 bc- ccmcb a question which name should receive priority. The iiame Taphrina hiratsukae Nishida is chosen since it would precede T, struthioptendis in an alphabetical list of species. The close simi- larity of Taphrina hiratsukae to T. athyrii has been mentioned above. It is not impossible that these two species are identical. 3. Taphrina blechni (Bresadola) ex Mix.

Taphrina calif arnica Mix Taphiina cah'loinica Mix, Mycologia 30*563-569. 1938. Causing small to lai'ge (several centimeters in extent when swollen) orange-brown galls on leaflets, midribs, and petioles of Dnjopferis arguta (Kaulf.) Wats. The galls are fleshy and gela- tinous, becoming small, wrinkled, and hard when dry; much swollen when wet. The gall originates from the epidermis and the mycelium d(‘velops entirely within the outer walls of the surface cells (‘‘epi- dermal colls'M of the gall. Ascogenous cells develop in a much enlarged wall locule, and the mature a^ci burst forth and protrude from this locule.

The collection by Parks was widely distributed (as California Fungi 343) under the name Taphrina filicina Rostr. Many sub- divisions of this collection in various herbaria have been exam- ined, but in all of them the fungus is immature, showing ascogenous cells but no asci. The galls are characteristic. Taphrina calif arnica is apparently common in the coastal region from lower California to central Oregon. Dr. R. H. Thompson kindly searched the collection of ferns in the Stanford University Herbarium, looking for those with unmistakable galls of T. cali- fornica. Ferns bearing galls were found to have been collected from the following localities: California: Amador County, Cedar Creek; Marin County, Petaluma; Monterey County, above P. I. Co. Dam; Rand County, City Creek; San Diego County, East Illi- nois River, four miles from Takilma, seven miles above Lakeside; San IMateo County, Santa Cniz Mountains, King’s Mountain; Santa Clara County, Los Gatos; Tulare County, Sequoia National Park.

Because this fungus i'- known only from a single meager collec- tion the writer (1. c.) had some hesitation in describing it as a dis- tinct species. The temptation was to con.sider it as a host-variant of Taphrina fusca (known to occur in the same locality) or of T. vestergrenii (not known in North America). However, the char- acteristic slender asci and the fusiform spores differentiate it from both these species. Moreover the gall is different from those formed by T. fusca and T. vestergrenii (q. v.), being characterized by moderate hypertrophy of all the cells of the lamina. 20 The University Science Bulletin 9.

According to Giesenhagen (1. c.) the gall, though exhib- iting considerable hypertrophy, is epidermal in origin, and this seems to be the case in the various specimens examined. Fresh material, with galls of various ages, would be necessary in order to determine this point with exactness. Mycelium subcuticular. Asci epiphyllous, or sometimes amphigenous, clavate, rounded or truncate at the apex, provided with a stalk cell which may equal or exceed in length the ascus proper.

Bub^k’s description of Taphrina moriformis gives dimensions of asci as 30-45[i X 4-6(i, stalk cells not mentioned, spores not seen. The asci are further described as narrow at the apex. Examination of his type material makes it appear that he saw and described no asci but only ascogenous cells. These are long and narrow, 30-46(ji X 5(1, and form a close layer beneath the epidermis (Fig. 2, D). Dili- gent search of the material revealed a single mature ascus with a Mix: Monograph op Genus Tapheina 21 stalk cell and spores. D,iincnsions of tins ascus were 33 X lO;)-, of the stalk cell, 17 X and of the spores, 4.5 X 5(i.. The gall itself is somewhat larger than in other collections of Taphrina fusca. Judging from its dried state it may reach one centimeter in diam- eter when fresh, and is much convoluted. That this convolution is apparent in the fresh state may be inferred from Bubak’s descrip- tion and from his choice of a specific name. There is no doubt that Bubak’s and Giesenhagen’s fungi, occurring on tlie same host spe- cies, arc identical. The writer’s reasons for assigning the American fungus on Dry- opteris spinidom to Taphrina fiisca have been given earlier (Mix, 1938). The yellowish or brownish coloration of the galls is found in the walls of the outer cells (“epidermal cells”), all fungous structures being hyaline. 10.

These dimensions are hard to understand unless Sadebeck included stalk cell and ascus in his measuring. It is impossible to determine the host species from the material available. 13.

Asci hypophyllous, less commonly also epiphyllous, scattered, one ascus foimed in each wall locule, emerging as a small papilla which gradually enlarges to an oblong ascus, a small, triangular stalk cell remaining inserted in the locule. Ascospores not seen, blastospores numerous, often fonning in the ascogenous cell (young ascus) before ascus emergence; in mature asci the blastospores occur in a peri- pheral layer close to the wall. (Fig. 3, F.) Dimensions: Of asci, 26-63iJi. X 17-27 [jl; of stalk cells, 6-17{jl X 8-17ijl; of spores (blastospores), 3-4 ijl X 2-3.5[x. Distribvtion: Japan. Material examined: Japan: Pref. Tottori, Taisenji, July 1, 1924, K. Togashi (Herb. Morioka Imp. Coll. Agric. and For. 193) ; Pref. Iwate, Mt. Iwatc, June 13, 1934, K. Togashi (Herb. Morioka Imp. Coll. Agric. and For.) ; Kyusu, Mt. Kirisama, May 29, 1938, 1. Hino (Herb. Lab. Path. Veg. Miyazaki Koto Norni-Gtikko). In early stages a network of small-celled hyphae forms within the epidermal wall, and haustoria are sent into the cell cavity beneath. Ultimately each wall locule contains a single multinu- cleate hyphal body, with a thin membrane. From this ascogenous cell a single ascus arises as explained above. The intermediate development is not clear, and it has not been possible to trace the 26 The University Science Bulletin nuclear history from the rather scanty licrbarium material at liand. Cytological study of this fungus would be very desirable, since, it the interpretations here given are correct, it is a liiglily aberrant specie'-, showing some resemblance to members of the genus Taph- ridinm Lagerh. and Jucl. Although NishidaV paper i«! in Japanese, it may be assumed from his English summary and from his figure that he missed the features described above (“wall habit^^ of mycelium, emergence of asci, i)res- ence of a pedicellate stalk cell) . 15.

Numerous spores (blastospores) appear in a ])erii)lieral layer in the a^cus before, during, or after emergence. Asci hypophyllous or amphigenous, oblong-cyclindiic, rounded at apex, with a narrower cyclindric stalk cell, the lower part of which is expanded into a foot within the wall locule. (Fig. 4, A.) Diniensions: Of asci^ 40-80[jt. X 13-23(jt.; of stalk cells, ]0-17[x X 8-lOg; of spores, 2-5g X 1.5-4g. Distribution: Georgia. Material examined: Georgia: Hamilton, Pine Mountain, Blue Springs Farm, May 26, 1938, B. B. Higgins. This fungus, for which the writer is indebted to B. B. Higgins, differs from Taphrina osniundne by its larger asci, and iis narrow, nearly cyclindric stalk cell. It also causes smaller spots, as is natural on the more finely dissected fronds of the host. Like T. osyyiundae it would repay cytological study. An earlier collection made by W. A. Miirrill at Blacksburg, Va., in 1897 could not be positively identified as T. higginsii. An ac- count of this has been previously given (Mix, 1947). 16. Taphrina polystichi Mix Taphrina polystichi Mix, Mycologia 30:563-579. 1938.

This is the most frequently collected and apparently the most common and wiilcly distributed fern-inhabiting species of Taphrina in North America. It occurs throughout the easteim United States and adjacent Canada. The first collection is that made by Sturgis in West Virginia in 1891, and the first mention in literature is that by Coker (1910) wdio called the fungus Exoascus filicinus. 17.

Herzfeld, w^ho described the fungus while working at Munich un- der the direction of R. Wettstein, apparently designated no type 28 The University Science Bulletin specimen. On inquiry at the Munich Museum it was learned that preserved material of Herzfeld’s collection was known to have been in the mu=eum but in 1938 it could not be found. However in 1939, Dr. Fr. Wettstein kindly obtained fresh material from the place of original collection and sent it to the writer. This nuilerial, de- posited in the Mycological Herbarium, University of Kansas, is chosen as the lectotype. Although the mycelium is intercellular, vciy little modification of the mesophyll occurs. The epidermis is browned. 18. Taphrina fmdliana Mix Taphnm fanlliana Mix, Mycologia 30:563-579. 1938.

British Columbia: Vancouver Island, Sidney or Lake Cowichan, June, 1938, Malcolm Wilson. In the original description of this fungus the spots arc dcscribc<l as brown. This must have been due to age of material since in the freshly collected material received in 1938 from Malcolm Wilson, the spots were, as he kindly pointed out, Icmou-j'cllow in color. The width of asci (4-7[j.) given in the original description is in error. Examination of the measurements recorded at the time of describing shows the width to be 6-9g as given above. Other revisions in di- mensions (of stalk cells and conidia) result from study of additional material. The fungus was named in honor of Dr. J. H. Pauli, from whom it was first received. The first collection, apparently, was that of Darker in 1929. 30 Ti[e University Science Bulletin 19. Taphrina tonduziana P. Hciniings TapJvina tonduziana P.

Giesenhagen did not find spores when describing the fungu'? but later (1901) re- ported them to be in size near those of Taphrina vestergrenii. Spores were present in the material examined by the writer. 21. Taphrina rhomboidolis Sydow and Butler Taphnnn rhomboidaUa S 3 \"dow and Butler, Ann. Mjx*. 9:372-421. 1911. Causing small yellow^ (becoming brown with age) rhomboidal unthickened spots on leaves of Pteris quadriaurita Retz. Mycelium growing within the epidermal wall. Asci amphigenous, emerging from wall locules, provided with a stalk cell; ascospores eight, ovate to elliptic. (Fig. 5, F, G.) Dimensions: Of asci, 23-43iJi. X 8-lOg; of stalk cells, 23-43iJt.

Res. 32 The University Science Bulletin Inst. I. 47.) Received from G. Watts Padwick, Imp. Agric. Res. Inst. New Delhi, India. The rhomboidal shape of the lesion is due to its being margined by veins, though commonly more than one vein-islet is included. The ''w^all habit” of the fungus, not fully described by the original authors, has been discussed earlier (Mix, 1939) as well as the dif- ferences between this species and the preceding. These are: the production of unthickened spots instead of branched outgrowths, the irregular, rather than polyhedral, outline of ascogenous cells when viewed from above, and the possession by the ascus of a somewhat narrower stalk cell. 22.

Material examined: Guatemala: Quetzaltenango: Santa Maria de Jesus, Dec. 28, 1936, J, H. Faull (Herb. J. H. F. 12939). In studying material of Taphrina uleana (P. Henn.) Gics. the writer was struck with the similarity of the healthy fronds of the host to those of Pteris orizabe, and of the resemblance of the lesions to those caused by T. amplians. This raised the question whether the two hosts and perhaps the two fungi might be identical. The ferns were submitted to C. A. Weatherby of the Gray Her- barium, who compared them with authentic herbarium-specimens. The host for Taphrina uleana is not Pteris decurrens Presl. as re- ported by Hennings but Pteris deflexa Lk. Pteris dejlexa and Pteris orizabe are distinct, though closely related species, with different geographical distribution. The following specimens of Taphrina uleana were carefully studied: 1.

This, together witli the desca-ijition qiu)t(‘(l above, suggests that Taphrina ampliam and T, ultana may be simi- lar fungi. Thorough study of all available material of T. uleana lui\"^ failed to reveal any mycelium or asci of TapJnina, any wall loeules (eviai empty) such as are produced by T. amplutths, anything in fact, but em])ty host ccll« and sporo« and mycelium of various molds. Sludy of the ty])e specimen was made before wiiting the description of T. (tmplian,\\: of the other spe<‘imens later. Tt seems i^osisble that tli<‘ Avritcr may have described (as T. ampliann) a fungus related to or even identical with T. uleana. Since, hovcver, the typ(‘ spc'ciimai of Taphrina uUana does not show any lecognizalile fungus, Taplinna uleana must be declared a nomm diibium. 23.

The ex- Wence of a stalk cell was denied by Sadebeek (1890), but as pointed out by Juhaiwm, Sadebeek had (‘ontusod this fungus with Taphrina rhizophora. Sadebeek later (lh93) di'-tinaui'-hed two types of asci in T. popuhna: (1) Slender, deeply inserted a-^ei, 80-112[jl X 20-27[jl, provided with stalk cells an<l occurring on Popidm nigra L. var. italica Duv.; and (2), broad asei, SOpi X 30-40;jl, slightly inserted, often lacking stalk cells, occurring on Popiilus nigra L. The fact that the stalk cell may be present or absent has been recorded by most later investigators. In these studies the two types of asei mentioned by Sadebeek have been found on all but one of the ho'^ts listed above, A^ci without stalk cells may have a bluntly rounded or wedge-shaped base, and are less deeply inserted than the longer asei with stalk cells. Neither type of ascus occurs exclusively on any one host. In particular the limits of ascus-size observed for Populus nigra are: 30-122[ji.

It possesses, according to his observations, a tapering, rhizoidal ascus-base, in- serted between the epidermal cells of the host.

The danger in this would be that if additional specimens were studied some of the differences evident here might disappear. In the absence of infor- mation as to the biological specialization it seems bc*^! merely to record that Taphrina popiilina shows marked variability on different hosts. 26.

Ulrichsen (Ericksson, F. Par. Scand. 358, as on Populus sp. but probably on P. alba) . The first mention of a form of Taphrina on the carpels of Populus alba and of P. tremula is by Magnus (1874) who called it Taphrina aurea. Sadebcck (1884) considered the fungi on leaves and on carpels of Populus to be the same, calling them Exoascus aureus. Johanson (1887) described the form occurring on carpels of Populus alba and P. tremula as a new species, Taphrina rhizophora. He gave dimensions of the asci as 80-156pL X 16-22(x, and described the deep insertion of the asci and their long, rhizoidal, often forked, basal extensions. (He suggested that the fungus known in North America on P. tremuloides was the same.) Sadebeck (1890) in recognizing T. rhizophora, separated the fomi on P. tremula as a new species, Taphrina johansonii. He gave the ascus-length of P. rhizophora as 120-160 [jl, showing no overlapping with T. johansonii, and these measurements have been copied in subsequent literature. Actually there is an overlapping, the writer's measurements (above) showing asci of T. rhizophora as short as 76pL. The writer's stay in Sweden in 1939 was interrupted before a visit to Uppsala could be made, and Johanson's type material has not been studied. This does not seem important since the larger size of the asci on P. alba is quite apparent. Following the principle of disturbing existing situations as little as possible both T, rhizophora and T. johansonii are here recognized as valid species, though it is not clear that they are well distin- guished. Branching rhizoidal extensions of the asci are as common in the one fungus as in the other, and there is an overlapping in ascus-size between the two. Consistent treatment of species on Populus would call for uniting these two species into one, or for di- \\ision of Taphrina populina into several species. The occurrence of T. rhizophora on P. tremula reported by the writer (1936a) was an error, due to failure to recognize that Sade- beck meant to separate the fungus on P. tremula as T. johansonii. Jaezewski (1926) reports T. rhizophora as occurring on Populus bachofeni. This host, according to Index Kewensis, is identical with P. alba. 4-3659 50 The University Science Bulletin HOST INDEX TO SPECIES OF TAPHRINA ON SALICACEAE Popuhi<^ alba L.

Taphrina turgida (Sadeb.) Gies. Rostrup (1883) described Taphrina betulina from “birch” with- out giving the specific name of the host, though later (1890) he stated that it was Betula odorata (B. pubescens). Sadebeck (1884) described Exoascus turgidus, also from “birch,” and gave Taphrmn betulina as a synonym. Later Sadebeck (1893) reported the host for T. turgida as B. verrucosa {B. pendula), and stated that T. betulina occurred on B. pubescens. Sadebeck’s distinction between the two species was based on the form of the stalk cell, T. betulina having a broad stalk cell, truncate or rounded at the base, seated on the epidermis, while T. turgida had a wedge shaped stalk cell, pointed below, and inserted between the epidermal cells. (He also stated that the two species differed in the manner of fonnation of their ascogenous cells.) Rostrup (1890) expressed the opinion that Taphrina betulina and T. turgida were identical, but later (1896) he agreed with Sade- beck’s distinction between the stalk cells of the two forms. He also suggested a biological distinction, since he had observed Betula Mix: Monograph of Genus Taphrina 59 pubesccns and B. pendula growing close together, with only the former showing witches’ brooms. Actually there is no morphological distinction between the fungus on Betula pubescens and the one on B. pendula^ either in size and shape of asci or in form of stalk cells. In all specimens examined from the hosts named above, both the broad, flat t^^'pe of stalk cell, and the wedge-shaped, inserted one have been seen. Sadebeck himself (1893) stated that the stalk cells of T. turgida were very variable, and that it would be difScult to tell the two species apart by means of this character. h, Taphnna lapponica Juel. Juel (1. c.) in distinguishing T. lapponica from T. betulina stated that the fonner did not form witches’ brooms though im^ading ^^whole shoots.” According to his account all of the leaves on a branch became yellowed and sometimes enlarged, but adventitious buds were not formed. In the summer of 1939, during a stay in Lappland and Jiimtland, the writer become convinced that the above-described appearance is that of a young stage of a witches’ broom, resulting from infections of the current year or of a recent year. Stages intermediate between ^‘whole-shoot infection” and witches’ brooms were common. Juel did not find any marked difference in ascus-size between the two species, but reported ascus-diinensions for T. lapponica as 40pL X 16lJ^, the dimensions for jT. betulina being 45-55[jl X 15-20[i. He did, however, assign a shorter host list, finding T. lapponica to occur on Betula intermedia and on B. pubescens. That the two forms cannot be distinguished morphologically may be seen from the following tabulation made mostly from specimens collected by the writer in Sweden in 1939.
