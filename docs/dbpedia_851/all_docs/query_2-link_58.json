        "text": "After the last day, which consisted of 2 races, it was clear that we finished in 2nd place. The last day offered very nice conditions with good weather and even and nice wind but slightly lighter than previous days, about 8-12 knots of wind.\n\nAfter a coastal race, an offshore race and 6 wrapped races we got a total of 17 points with the series 3,1,3,3,4,1,2,(5). With this we were 6 points behind Sugar who won again this year with Sandro Montefusco at the helm. We say congratulations to them, and fantastic sailing. 3rd came Aivar Tuulberg and his crew on Katarina II.\n\nYou can find the full list of results here.\n\nhttps://data.orc.org/public/WEV.dll?action=index&eventid=ggkte\n\nWe would also like to thank Åland, Mariehamn, ÅSS, the Finnish Offshore Sailing Association and the entire ORC for a fantastic and well-organized week.\n\nWe are very happy with the regatta and our performance this season. This was the last regatta of the season and now we have fall training to prepare for next season.\n\nFinally, we also want to say congratulations to Swedish Garm and Per Roman who with their JPK 11.80 came 3rd in the class above us, class B.\n\nYesterday we sailed a coastal race of about 30 nautical miles. The race started with a cross, and during the race, in addition to the 3.2 jib, we have had to hoist both jib-top + staysail and S2 with our running stay.\n\nWe took 1st place with about 4 minutes to spare thanks to the work of our navigator and tactician to find a faster route through the archipelago during the previous night together with local expert Henti Lundberg. The local knowledge of our two Ålanders in the team also helped, Alvina and Thomas, who have sailed a lot in the area and know both the ground and favorable wind directions in narrower passages. Many thanks to navigator Sam, tactician/trim Thomas, keyboard Alvina and Henti Lundberg!\n\nThe race was settled just outside the harbor with a downwind bow and spinnaker which was fun as the harbor stood and cheered when we boats came to the finish with speed.\n\nWe go in for the last day with a tired but excited bunch that has been marked by a lot of injuries and ailments during the week. Fortunately, we have a doctor for navigator, Sam, and a local doctor contact, Snuffe, who also sails. Together they have supported the team and made it possible for us to perform at the top, despite ailments :).\n\nWith our 1st place from the coastal and 3rd place from the offshore race (which can't be counted out), we enter with a 2nd place in the overall with only 1 point from 1st place. We will do our very best today and later we will have the regatta dinner and awards ceremony.\n\nAfter a week of intensive preparations, we are finally at the ORCi European Championship in Mariehamn.\n\nEveryone was really excited when we started the 135 NM offshore race yesterday, Monday at 3 pm. This is the longest race of the championship, and no matter the position, it must not be counted away in the overall results. The race was exciting and close all the way, and it was not decided until all boats had crossed the finish line. Throughout the sailing there were many close encounters and changes in the live updated result forecasts on TracTrac.\n\nThere was a lot of leeward advantage at the start and we managed to get away well. Then we were able to turn to the right early according to our plan to go in towards the shore and get some sea legs. Unfortunately, we didn't quite manage to follow our plan all the way there and had to go out to the left of the field again and lie in a little stompier waves for a period during the first part of the crossing. At this point we also found that there was a significant countercurrent further out which further enhanced the advantage of going in towards land and shallower parts. We took this with us for the second part of the long first crossing and caught up well with our competitors.\n\nWe stayed consistently in the top 3 throughout the race and made several strategically wise choices throughout the race. We were the first boat to round most of the rounds along the course and even managed to take Line Honors as the first boat to finish in our class. With a margin of 18 seconds to third place and 1 minute and 45 seconds to second place after 21 hours of sailing, we are reminded once again that every second counts and is worth fighting for.\n\nWe had fantastic weather throughout the race, with winds between 4-10 m/s, a beautiful sunrise and sunset, and a night filled with shooting stars. We are pleased to have started the championship with a result that is worth counting on, and which does not significantly increase our overall score.\n\nNow we are going to rest and recharge for the course races that are planned for tomorrow. Then a busy week awaits until Sunday, with a series of cross/shore races and a shorter offshore race on Friday.\n\nThe race started just outside Suomenlinna, from where we sailed half-wind through the archipelago to finally round Helsinki Kasun and head for Swedish waters and the Alma Sound. Apart from a couple of hours during the night with rain, thunder and a little stronger wind, we sailed in bright sun and light winds during the first day. During the day, the wind gradually increased to be between 8-10 m/s just in time for Almagrundet. At midnight, the night between July 28 and 29, we rounded Almagrundet with the entire crew on deck. We hoisted the spinnaker and then set course for Visby for a slightly steeper slip. During the night the wind increased further and then stabilized around 15 m/s. In the fresh wind and high seas that built up, we even managed to surf at 19 knots at dawn!\n\nExcept for a short windward leg after Visby, we sailed spinnaker all the way down to Hoburgen, which we reached during the evening of July 29. From Hoburgen, we then tacked up to a half-wind bow that took us almost all the way back to Finnish waters. On Tuesday evening, July 30, we were able to hoist the spinnaker again for the final race to the finish. We ran the spinnaker through the night and then crossed the finish line at 04:38 on Wednesday morning. The race as a whole took us 3 days, 16 hours and 28 minutes, winning our class by 5.5 hours. In the overall, we sailed into third place. All results can be found here.\n\nIn conclusion, the whole crew is happy and satisfied with the competition. Something that was new to us in the team was the importance of adhering to the watch schedule to ensure that the entire crew does not turn out at the same time. In addition, everyone experienced it as very fun and educational to sail several different positions in addition to the regular distribution.\n\nWe would like to thank the RORC and the Finnish Offshore Sailing Association for a well organized race and a great atmosphere inside the Marina Bay in Helsinki.\n\nMalin is now in Åland for the upcoming ORCi European Championship, which will be sailed in Mariehamn, starting on August 11. The team will gather a few days before the start of the competition for some joint training and charging!\n\nThe start was at 14:15 on Sunday afternoon, when we, after a tight and intense start, headed towards Svenska Högarna in light wind and rain. The race started with what was close to a stretch bow at the beginning but then became more and more a straight cross. Despite careful studies of the weather situation, the forecasts were unstable until the end as the low pressure moving towards the Baltic Sea and Gotland was unpredictable. At the rounding of Svenska Högarna, the wind increased significantly while the rain poured down. We pulled up the S3 and set off in a steep reach towards Gotland, but when we could no longer carry the S3, we switched to the 3.3 and then took a reef. We sailed a steep half-wind for a few hours with winds of 27 knots, big waves and a lot of rain. We then knocked out the reef when the wind eased slightly. Later it turned right slowly to a cross and we continued to port until it was so strong that starboard bore down towards Fårö. At that point we tacked and changed to the 3.1.\n\nOn the way down to Fårö, at the height of Gotska Sandön, we hoisted a jib top and staysail when the bow again opened up to half wind. When the wind increased, we put on a new reef. Near Östergarn it turned against and we hoisted our mid-wind jib, the 3.2, knocked out the reef and cruised down to Hoburgen.\n\nIn our journey down to Hoburgen, it was noticeable to us that the larger boats had the advantage of the windward side and could stretch unlike us who needed to cross.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, we were able to change both staysails and beat out the reef to continue towards Almagrundet. The wind changed during the morning, which meant that the rest of the trip back offered a nice bilge in increasing wind strength with the S2 hoisted.\n\nAt Almagrundet we then changed to jib top and staysail to half wind towards the finish line which was crossed at 13:54 on Tuesday afternoon. We sailed the approximately 350-mile course in 47 hours and 39 minutes, which gave us third place in the class. All results can be found here.\n\nOverall, we are all happy with the race. As this was also the team's first longer race together, we have learned a lot of lessons that we look forward to applying to the next race, which actually takes place in just a couple of weeks when it is time for the Roschier Baltic Sea Race starting in Helsinki on July 27.\n\nDuring Gotland Runt we also had a dear reunion with Roger Nilson who joined us as navigator. Thank you very much Roger for sharing your invaluable knowledge on board!\n\nFinally, we would like to thank KSSS for a well-run competition, everyone in the team has created such great memories together during these days!\n\nOn June 12 - 16 we were in Tallinn at the Baltic Offshore Week. The regatta started with a training day on Thursday when we were also joined by the Estonian boat Sugar with experienced crew in the afternoon. Together we raced against each other during longer crossings, where we both got to practice crew placement, sail trim and max hang.\n\nOn Friday we sailed two races in varying wind conditions. The increasingly light wind did not last all the way, which meant that the third race of the day had to be canceled during the last bilge at the finish.\n\nOn Saturday it was time for the offshore race. The course was a bit shorter, about 38 miles long, and stretched to a lighthouse in the Gulf of Finland and then led us back to Tallinn. We started with a long crossing in light wind conditions which we did very well, but the further out from land we got, the lighter the wind became. The beginning of the leg was sailed in still very light winds (almost pale) where many of the gennaker boats unfortunately pulled away. With a few miles left, it finally filled up and we got a nice finish to the race in about 9 knots of wind and an S3 on a steep bow.\n\nThe last day of the regatta ended with a full day of course racing. A total of four races were sailed on Sunday in fine and stable wind conditions.\n\nDuring the weekend, everyone in the team has had to train a lot on both fast and intense maneuvers, longer bows and light winds. It was tough competition and not the most optimal conditions for us as a spinnaker boat. Although we finished just below the podium this time, we are all happy with the rewarding weekend and ready to return to Tallinn for the World Championships next year! Now we have also prepared the boat further for light winds with light wind boots on the spinnaker light wind sheets :).\n\nWe would like to thank the organizers at Kalevi Yacht Club and all the competitors who offered tough competition during all days. Final results can be found here.\n\nNow Malin is back in her home port and the team is getting ready for the next training session before heading off to Sandhamn and Gotland Runt, hope to see you there!\n\nWe won SM gold in ORCi ocean racing!\n\nIt has been great and intense days out at Sandhamn for this year's Sandhamn Open and ORCi SM. The wind has consisted of nice southwesterly winds of 14-22 knots with most wind the first day and a little less wind at night until Friday when we sailed offshore.\n\nThis year's set-up consisted of 2 course races on Thursday (results 1,2 of which the second place had to be counted off), an offshore race starting the same day (1), 2 course races (results 1,1) and a coastal race on Saturday (1). Overall we won with the series (1-(2)-1-1-1-1). See results via the link below.\n\nhttps://data.orc.org/public/WEV.dll?action=series&eventid=jouav&classid=A\n\nThe Offshore race was 135 long NM with start at 19:05 on Thursday and finish at 16:39 on Friday. 16 boats started and we won with about 21 minutes corrected time. The Coastal race was about 15 NM with 15 boats where we won with 5 minutes corrected time.\n\nWe are very happy with the weekend and have had a good atmosphere on the boat throughout.\n\nWe would also like to thank the KSSS and the Swedish Ocean Sailing Association for the great organization!\n\nTomorrow Malin's departure to Tallinn where Baltic offshore week awaits. We will be there between 12-16/6 and will sail both inshore and offshore races."
