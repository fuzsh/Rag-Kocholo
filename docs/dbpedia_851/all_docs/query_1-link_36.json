        "text": "The subject of this dissertation is the art of the Polish theatre director, set designer, and visual artist Tadeusz Kantor (1915–1990) and its inherent width of artistic expressions. The aim is to contribute with new interpreta- tions that add to previous research that primarily has studied the body of work from the perspectives of the artist’s intention and biography, and divided his artistic work between visual art and theatre. This dominating perspective has also been informed by the artist himself as he invented his own periodisation and explanatory expressions, tying the artworks and theatre productions to his personal experiences of Polish political and cultural history. By using perspectives from theories of performativity, the starting-point for the present study is that artworks interplay with a presumed spectator, contribute to the interpretation, and continue to produce new meaning beyond the original context. The study sets out to answer how the interaction between artwork and spectator can be understood, and what effects the art- works have on each other, when being analysed together, mediated by public presentations. In three chapters, two exhibitions, one anthology, and a group of artworks from the respective presentations, are being analysed. The first analysis explores the solo exhibition Tadeusz Kantor: Ein Reisender – seine Texte und Manifeste, published by Verlag für moderne Kunst & Institut für moderne Kunst, 1988, and a selection of the texts and reproduced draw- ings are analysed. In this chapter issues related to verbal and visual expres- sions are being discussed in relation to the motif of the book, that is identified as the literary narrator. In the last analysis, the retrospective exhibition Tadeusz Kantor at Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst in Zürich, 2008, with artworks in the mediums of sculpture, film, painting, and photography are explored. The chapter deals with issues related to spatial, material, and temporal aspects, connecting to a theoretical discussion on the live event of performance and theatre and their subsequent reproductions. Tadeusz Kantor, emballage at Kulturhuset in Stockholm, 1975–76, together with seven artworks in the mediums of sculpture, assemblage, collage, and text. Questions regarding representation, materiality, and conceptual modes are discussed in relation to a presumed spectator. In the following analysis, the anthology The concluding discussion brings up three recurring features of the artworks highlighted in the analysis. Firstly, how artworks by Kantor that are materially elaborated or intermedial combinations communicate in a dual manner where the spectator is made to respond to seemingly different expressive modes. Secondly, the analysis further shows that this way of addressing a spectator leads to reflexivity, as the duality makes the spectator aware of the modes of communication as such. Lastly, how artworks by Kantor address the spectator by means of a multitude of materials to create a strong sense of the here-and-now. These features add to and give nuance to previous research that interpreted literary and thematic motifs visually. In conclusion, the dissertation demonstrates how questions of media and materiality can deepen the way we understand the oeuvre of an artist that actively shaped the reception of his work with contextual references and themes. The chosen perspective and method take the artworks in a relatively unexplored direction, showing how public appearances can be considered as events of becoming.
