        "text": "This article advocates using legendary sagas as historical sources, since these texts in spite of their non-realistic content, can tell historians a lot about the context in which the stories were written, and hence about the conditions that the people listening to them lived under. Using legendary sagas this way presupposes that they are read in their manuscript context, in line with the methodology of New Philology. However, this approach also brings along several challenges, some of which are addressed in this article. One practical challenge is to situating the manuscript historically, but in this field paleographists have done extensive work. Second, sagas are normally contained in manuscripts containing numerous sagas. This article argues that sagas should not be isolated from their manuscript context, and that manuscripts should be interpreted as totalities, not as random collections of sagas. Finally, legendary sagas deal with adventurous, allegedly \"unhistorical\", events. Yet, using the handling of these themes as keys to mentalities can open up new venues for historians, provided that they abandon a narrow definition of what should be considered \"historical\". Résumé : Cet article préconise l'utilisation des sagas comme sources historiques, puisqu'elles donnent aux historiens, en dépit de leur contenu peu réaliste, de nombreuses informations sur le contexte dans lequel elles ont été écrites et donc sur les conditions de vie de ceux qui les écoutaient. Cette utilisation des sagas suppose qu'elles sont lues en lien avec les méthodes de la Nouvelle philologie. Cependant, cette approche soulève également plusieurs défis, dont certains sont abordés dans cet article. Un premier défi est de dater historiquement les manuscrits, mais les paléographes ont déjà bien avancé le travail. Ensuite, les sagas se trouvent dans les manuscrits aux côtés de nombreuses autres sagas. L'auteur soutient que les sagas ne doivent pas être isolées de leur contexte manuscrit, et que les manuscrits doivent être interprétés comme des touts, pas comme des collections constituées de manière aléatoire. Enfin, les sagas, relatent des événements prétendument \"non historiques\". Pourtant, en considérant le traitement de ces thèmes comme des clés pour l'étude des mentalités, on peut ouvrir de nouvelles pistes pour les historiens, à condition d'abandonner une définition trop étroite de ce qui devrait être considéré comme \"historique\".\n\nBharat (INDIA) is an elite country with its valuable epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. They are so scintillating that modern iconic writers are fascinated with the Indian myths and present their work with the usage of various hues of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. These epics overflow with vibrant characters. They present the social, moral, political, cultural and spiritual society of ourcountry. Our Indian literature is too vast to understand every aspect of Indian mythology. This paper is an attempt to explore some of the mythical narratives of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata as reflected in select revisionist texts. The epic Ramayana represents the period of Tretayug, when the atmosphere and the people were not as much toxic as they were in the Mahabharata era. The Mahabharatais the epic of belligerent characters and storiesfrom the concluding period of Dwaparyug. Mythical narratives are based on the traditional stories of our Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads and many ancient stories of Indian mythology. In this paper,the researchers will take the help of some revisionist texts to explore further on some myths and mythical narratives. The selected revisionist texts which will be taken for study are – Devdutt Pattanaik’s Sita, Vayu Naidu’s Sita’s Ascent and Pratibha Ray’s Yajnaseni. It is said that Valmiki’s Ramayana is totally a mythical narrative of the life of Ram and Sita. Similarly, in the epic Mahabharata, Ved Vyas has created an ocean of myths and mythical characters with all the aspects of human life. Rework on these two epics by revisionist writers display their significant features and values in our lives.\n\nThe study of the narrative elements in tales and myths (motifs) belongs to a long tradition, initially aimed at finding the area of origin of early narratives (Urtexts). This objective, which has been much criticized, is generally abandoned today, but is it possible to establish the basis for an objectively verifiable mythogeography? Computer technology enables sophisticated mathematical computations on databases of an unprecedented scale, which makes it possible to base the comparative mythology on replicable calculation processes. In order to check for several subsets of motifs that could be specific to particular zones or continents, we test here two new methods on a corpus of 2264 motifs from ca. 40.000 myths recorded among 934 peoples around the globe, and we show that these motifs are best classified into two main groups.\n\nThe other day, I uploaded an article in Japanese, 綏靖型暴君伝説の展開 (published in 『比較民俗学会報 = Journal of comparative folklore』, no. 178, 2019, pp. 1-12). The following is its English translation. According to the Shintōshū 神道集, a collection of religious narratives of medieval Japan, Emperor Suizei 綏靖天皇 (the mythical second emperor of Japan) was imprisoned in a grotto because he liked to eat people. This article compares this type of narratives with parallels abroad and clarifies their history. One of the parallels is Zahhāk (Aži Dahāka) legend of Iran which belongs to the same type as the Norse myth of Loki, the Book of Revelation and others. Zahhāk type was probably introduced eastward by way of India. It is thought that Suizei type was derived from this type in or around Maritime Southeast Asia. The relationship of Zahhāk type and 'Sleeping Hero' legends is also discussed. Both of Zahhak-type and Suizei-type can often be seen in volcanic regions. It seems that they were mainly inspired by volcanic activities or earthquakes.
