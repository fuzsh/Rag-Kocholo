To get to this remote small group of islands you’ll have to arrange transport through the island supervisor, but it’s sure worth a visit.The largest island, Storön, has one of the archipelago’s few lighthouses that is manned all year. It also houses a weather station and a handful of residents. The locals are friendly and will happily give you a tour of the islands. Svenska Högarna is a popular pit-stop for migrating birds and during winter time you can spot grey seals and long-tailed ducks in the surrounding waters.",
