        "text": "People ask me what I do in China and why I like it so much. Well, what can I say… if meeting friendly people, feeling optimism and entrepreneurial momentum, eating great dinners for 30 SEK at any of the 24 hours there is, cycling amongst thousands of nice people and hundreds of silent electric mopeds, dealing, wealing and bargaining on the market, sitting with a latte on Starbucks with free internet and work, meeting people whom are curious and eager and work hard night and day… and love it, learning more from a culture packed with wisdom, behaviors and habits we hardly can dream of up here, being forced to deal with frustrating troubles everyday finding there is always a humoristic perspective of every solution if you just don’t stay so damn picky and negative about it, learning more about global perspectives and how to see things from other angles and last but not least having the opportunity to follow a pop star and her team on pretty big events all over the country… I think the answer lies right there.\n\nBut I will just for the heck of it describe the last trip a little more in detail. Don’t tell me it is too long, you don’t have to read it 🙂\n\nSaturday Oct 30:\n\nArrive in Beijing and go to my favorite place to have another 28 SEK main course dish for lunch. Same menu as back in 2003.\n\nSunday Oct 31:\n\nFly to Shanghai to attend the closing ceremony of the World Expo. Join Wei Wei and her team. Rigorous security check for everybody going back stage. Rehearsal at 13.00 and then wait for 8-9 hours locked in, preparing for the performance. “My” singer ends the show in a duet. During the waiting time I use my laptop and work with all kind of stuff I brought from Sweden. We also e meet all kind of people in there, journalists, some Chinese colleagues, some celebrities. And we eat. Then when time is getting closer to Wei Wei’s stage slot, we direct all focus on the preparation of her for the performance act. Looking and feeling good. The most important thing is to make the artist feel mentally happy and well prepared for stage – full of confidence no matter all the little hazards that pops up during the last minutes and seconds. They always pop up. No matter how well you plan in advance to avoid them. There are always a lot of people backstage and nobody can plan what people do or say. Right before a performance people are in general quite nervous and all kind of things just happens to happen. Unintended and unexpected but sometimes intended and planned – the competition in showbiz is sometimes quite brutal. Anyone who has been backstage in a multi-artist event frequently can write a book on that.\n\nI always bring my video camera and have collected hundreds of hours of film from my years in this business. At this event we had the time and opportunity to meet with some very nice guys – like all the MCs for the night, Jackie Chan and others (more photos here). Yes, it will eventually be part of some kind of documentary film.\n\nWei Wei ending the Shanghai World Expo Closing Ceremony. Six months after she participated in the opening ceremony of the same event.\n\nJackie Chan backstage showing Wei Wei photos on his dear iPad.\n\nWorld Expo, a great accomplishment for all participating nations and for China.\n\nAfter performance and photos taken with VIPs, dancers and all kinds of people there are always some spontaneous interviews taking place. After that we go back and change. Then we have to wait until the security guys lets everybody out. After that late dinner with some Shanghai people… business, politics, friendship and building connections and relations = the art of guan xi.\n\nBack in my hotel room the laptop gets going and time difference makes it possible/suitable and sometimes necessary on trips like this to do some Skype-calls…for free, haha. I just love the Internet. Went to bed 03.45.\n\nMonday November 1:\n\nAfter lunch it was time to fly back to Beijing. Interviews at the airport when we arrived. Well back in town we split and for me it was time to get some food. Jump onto the bike and cycle to Jinkelong food store. Beautiful day, unusually warm and nice with a deep blue sky. Days in November can be windy, cold as h..ll, foggy or smoggy. This week Beijing showed itself from its best side: Sun, high air, no wind and a bluer than blue sky.\n\nStill jetlagged, so dancing on the laptop keyboard for some late hours is pure joy for me and I have learned to not worry about jetlag and insted just trust my body to deal with it on its premises. Powernapping has become an art I handle pretty well nowadays. This time I was working with copy text for a client in Stockholm, the structure of a website project for a global foundation and some archive fixing with digitalizing filmed sequences and photos from last months. The latter always takes lots of time, but sure gives a good feeling after its done.\n\nTuesday November 2:\n\nTime to go to the market – Yashow and Silk Market. Bought a pair of jeans, a scarf and a gift to my mother. Unusually cheap. I have promised the sales people (mostly young very smart and skilled girls) to not disclose how little I pay. It’s a thing between them and me. Living frequently in Beijing for many years pays off if you stay loyal to the same sales stands. There are always at least three price levels: The inhabitants buy cheapest. Foreigners they know, or foreigners who can speak a little Chinese, can get almost as good deals. Unknown, but nice foreigners are next in line. The ignorant, innocent or non observant foreigners just have to face the fact to pay more than everybody else. Then there is the joke level – tourists that doesn’t yet have understood that you can bargain, or feel to embarrassed to try. They pay ridiculous amounts for the same thing as others buy for literary nothing. But that’s the name of the game, like it or not.\n\nWhat about the cheating, fake copy and immaterial rights issue? It is a hard one. I have seen a factory where jeans are produced. The cheap “original” ones sold on these markets are made by the same factory, by the same people, the same or almost the same fabric. Sometimes produced at other hours of the day, but definitely not as a necessary condition. The expensive ones, sold in jeans stores elsewhere in the world, feed quite a number of middle men and distributors on their way from A-B. So, if a western jeans brand guarantee fair production it is pretty much the same for the copies. There are of course worse cases around. And there is a moral dilemma in general. If I ran a tourist business in Beijing I would not sleep as well at night if I send buss loads with guests to the markets every week all year round and even charged them for the ride. I buy for my own use and have decided to say no to friends who ask me to buy cheap stuff for them. I don’t have time, I don’t like it, it is illegal both in terms of illegal trade in itself, as well as illegal if not declared in customs back home. I tell them to visit China themselves, stimulate the local economy as tourists and enjoy this, the existing system, if they want to. Sorry all dear friends, I have bought my last item on behalf of others.\n\nLunch 35 RMB at Subway. If you ask for a bottle of water you can end up pay either 60 for a Perrier or 10 for a local kind.\n\nA day like this always ends up with Starbucks and the using of their free internet service. For several hours. I consider Starbucks my headquarter office. No matter where I am in China or in the world. If they turn of the internet, people will leave and they will sell less.\n\nI see lots of business meetings going on. I see more iPads in one Starbucks an afternoon in Beijing than I see during a week back in Europe. Maybe a useless comparison but it is really cooking with more heat in this cuntry. The energy in the room is almost touchable. The developing world will kick some serious …ss within the upcoming years. I would recommend all people in the developed world to be just a tint more humble, standing in front of the changes going on right at this very moment. The shift in energy, initiative and curiosity will lead to a shift in global power. My advice to everybody everywhere is the following: 1) Wake up and open up your eyes. 2) If you can, invest in a round the world trip as soon as possible. 3) Travel alone, watch and listen more, talk less (we are equipped with two eyes, two ears and one mouth – questions anybody?).\n\nLate dinner with a friend from Stockholm who studies Business Chinese at the Beijing University. She is just the coolest one. If I could afford it, I would demand her to accept an employment at once. Working with young, talented and eager people who wants to explore the world, is an everyday injection of vitamins and life esprit. During dinner she helped me and some friends to call “my” Beijing Taxi driver for a trip to the Great Wall next morning.\n\nThe taxi driver story is one of my favorites. I met the driver by pure luck when my daughter was in Beijing in 2007, she had a Wei Wei song as her ring tone and someone happened to call her. The taxi driver in question was the kind with crocked teeth, lots of hair in his nose but very warm and kind eyes. He started to sing along immediately. Then he asked us how come she had his favorite song in her phone? Well, little too complicated to get straight with her limited Chinese and his even more limited non-English. But when my daughter played all Wei Wei’s songs from her phone and it turned out that the taxi driver knew all the lyrics, we became friends for life. When we played “The red flower” he even couldn’t hold his tears back. What a scene. I find the Chinese being very sensitive people, often moved by beautiful lyrics or texts, and showing their emotions. Just think that’s great and I can not imagine a Swedish male taxi driver sing-along to a Swedish song and cry openly in front of his passengers. No matter the status of his nose hair.\n\nCheck this video. It was filmed with “our” taxi driver some weeks later when the Swedish singers and friends Rongedal visited Wei Wei in Beijing.\n\nWednesday November 3:\n\n9.00 sharp, me and my young friends waited for the driver with a backpack ready to spend a day at the Great Wall. 9.30 still no taxi. I called a former Chinese home teacher at the University and asked her if she could call the driver and ask when he will come. The answer she gave us was that he couldn’t come at all. If this was my first time in Beijing I would be very frustrated and maybe panic. Instead I though, why am I not surprised, so we just stopped the first taxi passing by, called the teacher friend again, handed over the the phone and the teacher kindly asked the surprised driver if he would take us to Jing Shang Ling – it’s an almost two hour drive– wait in the neighborhood for five hours and then drive us back. He said yes, we agreed on a price and we left.\n\nWe had the most amazing day on the Great Wall. Couldn’t walk all the way between JingShanLing – Simatai as planned (due to some repairings) but the sun was huge, the sky as blue as it can be and the wind obviously visited some other part of China. On top of that there ware hardly any people there. Jing Shang Ling is further away and a harder, steeper and wilder part of the Great Wall than the tourist-trap part called Baidaling.\n\nMy young friends on the trip happens to be students at a musical school in Stockholm. So of course we filmed a spontaneous music video on the wall with our mobile phones. I am amateur-editing it right now and will soon post it on Youtube. One of them happens to be a friend of my daughter and the other one happens to be my daughter. Both of them happened to be in Beijing on their fall vacation for a week.\n\nWe came back to Beijing by seven something. Still jetlagged, quite exhausted from a long day walking and a long ride. Some food and then hit the sack. Falling a sleep is not an issue for teenager girls after a day on the Great Wall. However I could not stay away from the laptop. Still lots of things to do and deliver to the ones back in Sweden who still were in middle of their afternoon. Most of them didnt know were I was, why tell them? Thats one of the beauties of my second life in Beijing. Nobody knows where I am and it doesnt really matter anyway.\n\nThursday November 4:\n\nI am obviously getting old – I fall asleep when I sit, and I cant sleep long when I lay down. This is great since I love my work and have lots of things to do. I got up early, grabbed my bike and went out in another beautiful and sunny Beijing autumn day. Not a cloud. No wind, Not foggy, nor smoggy. Some of you might claim I am trying to hide the commonly perceived bad air situation in Beijing, but this week was as unusual as phenomenal. At Starbucks in Solana, in Chaoyang District, you can sit out door on second floor and enjoy free sun, free internet and a nice latte. Three hours later I met with people from the Swedish Embassy for a lunch at another übercool restaurant I have never heard of in the newly built area Sanlitun. The new Swedish Ambassador and his team just recently jumped right into a boiling pot of action in the largest country in the world. I felt very honored that they had time to meet at all. We had a very nice lunch.\n\nAfter that my two buddies back home woke up and called for attention. Ok, time for a sightseeing trip to Tian Men Square and maybe The Forbidden City. If you have an eye for open areas and monumental buildings you will not be disappointed. We went there and then to the food market. If you have an eye for grilled snakes, scorpions or sheep testicles you will not be disappointed either. This place is a well organized tourist trap in the neighborhood of the Tian Men, and it exposes the wide range of food cultures in this corner of the world. It is clean and professionally exposed in outdoor stands. It is strange and nice at the same time. In most foreigners noses the smell stretches from a recognizable barbecue evening, to unknown and disgusting fragrances. It is a 100 meter round trip in Chinese street food. Don’t miss it on a visit.\n\nLater on we enjoyed the nightlife of Beijing. Something that is described in more than one book. It is also widely described if you type it into the world of Google. Let’s just say we had a great time and that laptopping did not seem to be the right thing to focus on when back home.\n\nFridag November 5:\n\nNext morning I left with Wei Wei and the team for a trip to Liu Zhou, which is the town down in southern China where Wei Wei grew up. I have been there several years ago and as well as then, it was time for a celebration show. The Chinese just love celebration shows. So, we went for another “star of the show” performance by Wei Wei. Being a superstar in China (and elsewhere) you focus on any of the following two positions: Either you open the show with the first song or you end the thing by doing the last part. The artists doing their acts in between are not seldom collectively called “the filling-up’ers”.\n\nWhat do I do on a trip like that? In the beginning of my career as an international manager they were a necessity in order to understand the business, the culture, the role within the team, my role, Wei Wei, her position and her history in China… lets just say there were enough reasons for a foreigner. After seven years of traveling these kind of trips are not as crucial. But I have learned to never underestimate any of these trips. There are always something unexpectedly happening that makes it worthwhile to go every single time. Yes, every single time. Even if I don’t always understand why worthwhile when the things actually are happening. They always have a point sooner or later. Little hard to explain, but if focus in life is not solely collecting as much money as fast as possibly before you die, traveling to new places together with locals is a very good investment in your life bank account while still alive. But more crucial for the business is the showing of respect and support for the issue you work with. To be curious for real. That will always be important if you are serious about your ambition to develop a brand. I help out, I film, I support, I listen, I ask, I watch, I meet and on top of that I spend mostly all time with my laptop when nothing else happens. Showbiz is a war that goes on every day. Branding as well.\n\nThe beauty of working in a “cyber office” based on an internet connection anywhere, comes to it’s full potential when traveling. Everybody who have tried knows the feeling. It’s not rocket science, it’s just an ordinary way of living nowadays. Skype is already invented – so why not use it? Why so desperately hold on to the comfort zone and avoid the opportunities to feed our minds with all the possible inputs that comes from everything that is happening right outside that zone? Doesn’t necessarily need to be far away. Why? It’s all in our heads. It’s all about habits. It’s easy to change and I am determined. I have decided to change habits and platform in my life every seventh year. Why seven? I have no idea, it just happen to be so in my former life when a looked back on it the day I realized I was going to hit 40. So, why not seven? I have been doing this for seven years now, my body tells me there is some kind of shift going on. I can feel it. Some new opportunities lays right around the corner. I am excited and I look forward to the new seven years to come, wherever they will bring me.\n\nFlight was delayed 5 hours. This day that didn’t matter a bit. I had stuff to do and my dear connection burned with joy. Landed later that night in Liu Zhou. Check in, grab a bite of late night food with the team, help Wei Wei with some stuff and then back to the room even later. Woke up at 04.00. Possibly jetlagged, definitely not bored. Fixing pillows, get the CCTV News Channel running, an instant coffee and some crackers. Get the ironing board out from the closet, put it next to the bed, install the laptop, the coffee, the whatever documents needed and just go for it. Why ironing board? Well, its just another trick I’ve learned from one of the more experienced travelers I have met. Having the laptop on your knees in bed makes the body go nuts and the computer go warm. Instead the board do the work of a working table in bed. Maybe it looks weird, but it works great.\n\nSaturday November 6:\n\nOk, next thing is to get ready for a three hours ride to the place for the performance. A van picked us up and off we went. A powernap? Yes of course. After a while Wei Wei and the team woke me up – the view were too awesome to miss. Mountains, greener than green, shaped like in the Avatar movie. The sun was shining and outdoor it was 20 degrees at least.\n\nWe stopped an bought fresh fruit on the way. Picked by the farmers the same morning. Clementines, mandarines, tangerines or satsumas. Something like that. Sweet and refreshing. Then melons, then a huge kind of grape fruit that is quite common over here. Size of a volleyball. The skilled ones use a pretty cool pealing technique and gets the not so wet fruit meat out without sticky fingers, and it just tastes sooo delicious. Especially after a powernap on the sunny side in a van in southern China.\n\nOk, a new hotel and a temporary room for Wei Wei to make up, fix hair and change in. We, the team wind ourselves up and gets everything going together with her in order to make the “look and feel” just right just before leaving for the stage. It’s a procedure and routine we all know pretty well. She definitely knows it well after 20-25 years on the road.\n\nI use one moment to run out in the city to get some film sequences. Blond guys stretching 1.93 centimeters in a suit jacket, with a camera is not an average pedestrian in this town. So filming “everyday” sequences in a Chinese far away city is not that easy. I have to hide and film by surprise if I don’t want all the people to stop and stair right into the camera. These staring sequences are not what the documentary editing guys are most happy about. I get what I need an walk back to the hotel room. Its 8.30 at night. Great, food is there all ready. All kinds. Some of the dishes I recognize, some I definitely do not recognize. But I have to admit that I appreciate working with a Chinese female singer rather that with a male wrestling team… simply because there are always quite a lot of left-overs for a hungry Scandinavian. And Wei Wei is very generous with that.\n\nTime to go. The boss of the city police takes pride in being the escort from the hotel to the stadium. He is more than exited to have the honor to meet and take care of Wei Wei. His car is shining and clean, he turns on all the lights and sounds available and paves the way for our van through the pretty crowded streets. Well at the stadium the security guards make room for the van and holds the curious crowd back. There are more or less as many people right outside the stadiums. as there are inside. The crowd knows that when there is a van or a limo on its way to the stage right before the end of the show, the star of the evening is on her or his way. Of course that makes it messy and of course it needs to be quite some amount of guards around.\n\nWe wait inside the van until the right moment. People gather round us and tries to get a peak through the dark windows. The guards are curious, the crew are curious, the dancers are curious. They know it is Wei Wei sitting there. They sure don’t expect a guy like me to be in there, so the same thing happens every time – Wei Wei’s personal bodyguards stands outside her door on her side and I sneak out the other door right before it is time for her to get out. That confuses the crowd a little, and possibly it eases up the pressure for a second on her side of the car. Then they walk, or run, to the back of the stage and I follow behind with my camera. There the pressure eases up a little, but the dancers that more or less always performs behind the artists just cant hold back. They are young boys and girls whom have maybe never met or seen Wei Wei so close. And for the last weeks they have been practicing a dance act for her songs and now the chance to get a picture, a hello, an autograph or even a handshake or a hug is right in front of them.\n\nThe MC for the evening, a very famous and very nice guy comes up and says hello, a quick chat and then we walk up the stairs and wait for Wei Weis turn. Dancers, polices, guards and technicians are taking photos with their mobile phones. She gets the last instructions on how and where to do what on stage. The stage is built for this show. Wei Wei haven’t seen or walked on the stage, she just have to trust the description given by the people on where the stairs are and how close the audience will be. With all the thousands of watts of light streaming right in your eyes it can be quite a hazzle to judge distances and to see where you step. A loooong dress and high healed boots doesnt help much on that.\n\nLast words, a little encouragement and off she go. Always nervous. Still after all those years and still already by the sound from the audience totally sure about that they will love to see her. You have to be blind and deaf to believe something else. I find it be a quite charming personality for a experienced superstar to be nervous right before a performance, no matter the size of the crowd. If they just go out there with no tension there will be no real charisma in the face or body language, and the audience will feel it in seconds.\n\nThe audience goes nuts. The people in the VIP-section smiles like it was their happiest moment ever. – Our Wei Wei is coming back to us. Of curse the mayor, the politicians, the business people and the VIP-guests are happy and proud. They all have invested tremendous amounts of trust, pride and money into a celebration like this. The people in their city, or province, will judge them for how they arrange this and how generous they are concerning the magnitude of the event. If the event is too small and no superstars are hired, the city inhabitants might end up being furious and vastly disappointed. – Hey, you don’t think we, the people of your city, are more worth than this crap? The major will lose face in front of all his colleagues and the community’s business people. They will be compared with the neighbor city and province. – Why did they get the superstars and we didn’t? We have been waiting for 5 years for this celebration. Pressure on the top management people can be gigantic in cultures like this. The loosing face tradition cuts like a sharp knife through all levels, in all hierarchies.\n\nSo these VIPs were not only happy to see “their favorite” singer perform, they were also released from the risk of losing face on one of the biggest celebration days of this year, or several years, in their province. A win-win if good. A lose-lose if not just good enough. Superstars like Wei Wei save a lot of faces in Chinese cities by showing up and perform when being invited. They know she will please the audience, they know she will do good for real. A new or less famous artist might ruin the city mayors position no matter how popular the artist is somewhere else. When Shanghai invited the Rolling Stones some years ago, the majority of people had never heard of them or a guy called Mick Jagger. The city major had things to explain to get back into the same level of trust after that. It is not a game of money, it is a game of honor, respect and a game of favors. Loyalty, trust and respect in China is based on a scale carved with the finest of senses. Compared with western scales which I , after some years in Asia, consider being more like creations chopped by a not so sharp axe.\n\nWei Wei was in a great mood on stage. She loved it and the audience loved it. Between the songs she talked to the audience like they were long time friends. She knows how they feel, she cares about them for real. That is one of her strengths as an artist besides her singing capacities. She really knows her people’s moods. Same thing happens no matter if she visits eastern, western, northern or southern China. I have been there. I have it all on film and in my memories. It happened when we went to the devastated Sichuan area two days after the earthquake in 2008, it happens at the most glittery VIP-dazzeling dinner parties in any of the more than necessary fancy city hotels they usually take place in. It happens at private top politician events. She touches the minds of the Chinese people no matter the level. When President Hu Jintao visited the Royal Dinner at the Stockholm Royal Castle Wei Wei almost got a hug from the president and his wife. They don’t meet often, they are not best buddies, but they are deep friends on a national sole level. A level and depth that differs from most western cultures I would say. I am not saying I am right, it is just a feeling I have after seeing what I have been seeing during the years in Asia. It is hard to make people outside of China understand what that capacity is worth. Nope, we choose to measure things with our scales and few of us are truly interested in to really find out and learn more about them – them, the others. No wonder it is hard for us humans to agree on how to agree.\n\nSame thing occurs every day between the east and the west, between the south and the north. Go out there and look for yourself, and spend some time and money to travel, listen and watch, I guarantee you that you will feel richer afterwards. I have spent seven years doing that pretty intensively and I feel I haven’t even started yet. If you ask me I will say there is a higher goal in life than to stay in the comfort zone and buy more stuff.\n\nOk, that entire Saturday was a travel and performance day. Back in room 4718 the sound of fingers dancing on a keyboard started to blend in with the sound of silence. Just because I knew I was going to write this answer on the question in question, I counted the emails. Twelve. Take away three spam emails, makes them nine. Not much but all of them concerning some of the exiting things going on right now: The copy- and attitude assignment for Boulebar in Stockholm, the website and planning for the documentary film The War On Doping about the global work with anti-doping and Professor Arne Ljungqvist, the development of a new non-violence website which aim to be the largest call for peace and non-violence ever manifested, the wind power plant campaign for Svenska Högarna that started on pure guts and glory some months ago, the food project I have been obsessed with for some years now, a tribute idea which gives me goose bumps because it open up doors for free global distribution of any digital content while it solve some of the business-model dilemmas the music industry have been facing for quite some time, a green screening solution for brands that wants to build trust in terms of sustainability. Laying in a bed with an ironing board as an office desk dealing with these issues makes it hard to sleep. Good or bad? Dont know, but I have a good time in there.\n\nSunday November 7:\n\nDon’t remember how, when or how much I slept. The TV was on and the laptop was steering at me when the bright sunlight made me slowly realize where I was. Ok, shower, too late for breakfast, get stuff ready and finish up some of the laptopping. Then a quick lunch, meet with Wei Wei and her sweet auntie, whom I became a dear friend with while she was in Sweden taking care of Wei Wei’s children for quite some time. She couldn’t speak English, I couldn’t speak Mandarin back then either. We became friends anyway – who needs a language? Face expressions and body language makes a tremendously cool real time dictionary. It’s for free and you don’t need a bag to bring it.\n\nThen fly back “home” to Beijing. Arrived late afternoon. Split at Wei Wei’s place and I went for my daughter and her friend to have dinner at our favorite place Muse. The lady in there just cant keep from being happy to see us. Somehow we became friends for life after we made her restaurant building as a ginger bread house for Christmas back in 2007…with small ginger bread Santas and pigs. They were surprised when we came with it that evening, to say the least. Gingerbread houses is not a tradition over here even now, haha.\n\nMonday November 8:\n\nEscort my sweet teenagers to the airport. Taxi in half an hour = 68 RMB including the highway fee. That’s China. They checked in their slightly overloaded suitcases and went happily back to Stockholm with Air China and their perfect 8-9 hour direct flight between Beijing-Stockholm. It’s 30-50% of the price of a SAS-ticket. Funny, flying business to Beijing is in general a 40.000 SEK issue with SAS and in worse case 20.ooo SEK with Air China. Air China direct, SAS via Copenhagen. Who want to pay that kind of money and on top of that end up with a stop in Copenhagen (I love Copenhagen and Kastrup – so no offence)? Economy with Air China roundtrip can be a 6-8.ooo ticket or even less if you’re lucky. Direct and with great service. Seven years of flying and delayed only once. Just love it.\n\nBack in the city I did some errands and fixed my bike with the great help of my bicycle-repairman at the corner. He shifted the entire pedal-thing. I bought the brand new bike in 2009 for 350 RMB. Now he changed the “aorta” of my bicycle and charged me 50 RMB with a great smile. Not a word, just gestures and smiles. Its hard not to like China sometimes.\n\nWith the “new” bicycle I made it to two meetings twice as fast compared with the time of a taxi in that afternoon traffic. It’s not funny to sit in a cab for three-four hours for the purpose of a one hour meeting, when you know you can use 20 minutes each way on your bike. Traffic can be a drag in Beijing, no doubt.\n\nLater that evening I worked back home. Time differences makes everyday into two days or sometimes three. First the Chinese, then the European, then the American. Not a big deal, just a fact. Either you like it or you don’t. I happen to like it.\n\nTuesday November 9:\n\nBack in 2009 Wei Wei was invited to Tällberg Forum together with Professor Arne Ljungqvist concerning a global health issue. I had the opportunity to be their “personal butler” and by that take good care of both of them up there for three very interesting and stimulating days. Tällberg was killer beautiful and the sun was kind and warm. Some people have asked me why I do things like that for free. These people haven’t understood nothing. Getting experiences and moments closely related to interesting people, or the opportunities to bump into global connections at an occasion like that, can not be bought for money. That is the perspective I see in it. An opportunity, an honor – not a job. Please tell me if I am wrong.\n\nOk, so this Tuesday the Tällberg people visited Beijing and invited Wei Wei and me for a Tällberg Talk at the Swedish Embassy. A kind of think-tank meeting where minds from all different angels meet and discuss on a particular subject. Very interesting and as one f the participants said, how often do we spend on afternoon just thinking and talking with strangers about one issue. Pretty cool experiment. See more here.\n\nAfter the meeting there was a reception dinner at the Embassy. Wei Wei had to leave for Guang Zhou and the opening ceremony of the 16th Asian Games. Her driver, bodyguard and assistants picked her up and went to the airport. I stayed a little while at the embassy and then went back home to my laptop and also to prepare for the last day before heading back to Sweden.\n\nThis is what it looked like a couple of days later in Guang Zhou at the opening ceremony.\n\nWednesday November 10:\n\nNone of my teenagers and no pop star in town. An entire day or me and myself. Great sunny day and time for ride to a full day at my Starbucks-office. Managed to squeeze in two meetings in there. Some internet-oriented University students who will help me with some social media issues inside the Chinese Great Firewall, and a meting with a documentary filmer who use to help me in Beijing.\n\nEvening packing, cleaning and laptoping after a nice dinner with some friends.\n\nThursday November 11:\n\nA quick ride to Yashow in the morning, get a knitted sweater and then back for last packing. Taxi to airport, check in, security, some noodles and then go to gate. Nine hours flight whereof at least four of them happily with the guy sitting next by and having an uncountable number of interesting things to talk about. Thanks Oskar.\n\nThat is what I do in China. That is why I like it so much."
