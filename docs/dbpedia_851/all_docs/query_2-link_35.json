        "meta_description": "These two guys came flying past me on the road today on their inline skates. I decided to catch up with them. Luckily for me they had to stop and repair the brakes on one of the roller blades. This is <b>Thomas</b> and <b>Mikael</b>. They are members of <a href=\"http://www.speedskaters.se/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Stockholm Speedskaters</a>. They had just been down to Tungelsta (I met them in Handen), and funnily enough taken the same route as I did on my bike! During the winter time they are often out skating on the ice in the archipelago. Mikael had done the <a href=\"http://www.vikingarannet.com/?location=12,1\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Viking Run</a>. It's a 80 km ride on Lake Mälaren between Uppsala and Stockholm. Thomas told me about a run from Västerås to Stockholm (100 km), that took him and his friends around eight hours. Mikael lives in Tyresö and Thomas comes from Spånga/Tensta. They met while skating, and have been friends ever since. Another fun winter ride on the ice was when Mikael took a ferry from Stavsnäs out to Harö, and from there skated out to Svenska Högarna, far out in the Stockholm archipelago. You can see some  winter photos <a href=\"http://www.alliansen.net/skridskonet/bild/bild-v.asp?_order=ID+DESC&amp;klubb=25&amp;_limit=-1&amp;_first=-1\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">here </a>.
