On the eastern reaches of the archipelago, just before islands and skerries give way to the open sea, you’ll find Svenska Högarna. To get to this remote small group of islands you’ll have to arrange transport through the island supervisor, but it’s sure worth a visit.

The largest island, Storön, has one of the archipelago’s few lighthouses that is manned all year. It also houses a weather station and a handful of residents. The locals are friendly and will happily give you a tour of the islands. Svenska Högarna is a popular pit-stop for migrating birds and during winter time you can spot grey seals and long-tailed ducks in the surrounding waters.
