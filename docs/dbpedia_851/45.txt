These two guys came flying past me on the road today on their inline skates. I decided to catch up with them. Luckily for me they had to stop and repair the brakes on one of the roller blades. This is Thomas and Mikael. They are members of Stockholm Speedskaters. They had just been down to Tungelsta (I met them in Handen), and funnily enough taken the same route as I did on my bike! During the winter time they are often out skating on the ice in the archipelago. Mikael had done the Viking Run. It's a 80 km ride on Lake Mälaren between Uppsala and Stockholm. Thomas told me about a run from Västerås to Stockholm (100 km), that took him and his friends around eight hours. Mikael lives in Tyresö and Thomas comes from Spånga/Tensta. They met while skating, and have been friends ever since. Another fun winter ride on the ice was when Mikael took a ferry from Stavsnäs out to Harö, and from there skated out to Svenska Högarna, far out in the Stockholm archipelago. You can see some winter photos here . This is my 49th photo for the 100 Strangers project. You can see the rest of my strangers in my Set.
