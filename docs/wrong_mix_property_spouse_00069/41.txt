Canada-born Hong Kong artiste Charlene Choi has refuted claims that she and “Mahjong Prince” Anthony Shek ended their six-year relationship because of a third party.

In a recent interview with HK01, Choi, one-half of the Cantopop duo Twins, said she and Shek are on good terms, with the billionaire expected to attend her concert next year.

“I feel sorry for him as he’s being slandered and doesn’t have a platform to clarify things. We are still good friends and often have dinner together,” the 41-year-old added.

This is the first time Choi has opened up about the split, according to HK01.

Prior to the breakup, the couple have been living separately as Choi was focusing on her career in China.

Earlier in August, Hong Kong’s Sing Tao Daily reported that the couple broke up as they couldn’t reach an agreement on marriage.

It added that Shek, who would go travelling with Choi if she had no work commitments, had been notably absent from her trips in recent months.

Sing Tao also quoted sources claiming that Shek, who runs a mahjong parlour business, was going on dates with female friends and was reportedly close to a woman identified as “Miss C”.

When asked if there was a chance for the pair to rekindle their relationship, Choi told HK01 that romantic matters are not a priority now.

“I don’t have time to think about that now, but I’m doing well ... I’ve always had many pursuers, but I’m very picky and have no time to entertain (those matters),” she said.

As for whether or not she’s found a potential suitor, Choi said she’s too busy but is open to relationships.

Choi and Shek started dating in 2017. The singer was previously married to Hong Kong artiste Ronald Cheng, whom she divorced in 2010.
