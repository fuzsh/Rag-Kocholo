HONG KONG: Hong Kong singer-actress Charlene Choi has admitted Sunday that she is currently dating Hong Kong singer William Chan, reported Chinese media.

"It just started. I wanted to wait till the relationship became stable before announcing it and won't try to keep it under wraps," said Choi.

"We have been together for a few months. It is really an amazing twist of fate," said Chan of how their first meeting on the set of a Twins music video seven years ago blossomed into a romantic relationship today.

"Now that our relationship is stable, I am not afraid to admit it. We are deeply in love and I really love her. I don't want to deny our relationship and hurt [Choi]. I really want to protect this relationship," he added.

Chan, 25, also expressed that he did not mind that Choi, 27, was previously married to singer-actor Ronald Cheng.

"When you love someone, you will accept her past, accept this new love. Because all of us can let go, we all have this feeling of rebirth," said Chan, who previously dated Hong Kong model Angelababy.

While the pair only went public recently, the writing was already on the wall since earlier this year.

Choi, who was so busy that she often complained about having no time to herself, insisted on making time to appear in one of Chan's music videos in April.

And a day before the couple went public with their relationship, Choi uploaded a photo of Chan and herself standing cheek to cheek, while making a heart shape with their joined hands onto her micro-blogging account.

Choi then went on to praise Chan for looking good when he performed.

Chan and Choi may have found love but their exes are not doing too badly either.

Choi's ex-husband Cheng is rumoured to have moved on from their divorce and seeing attractive news anchor Sammie Yu.

Angelababy on the other hand, has been romantically linked to Chinese actor Huang Xiao Ming.
