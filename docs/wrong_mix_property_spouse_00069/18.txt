Hong Kong celebrity couple Charlene Choi and Ronald Cheng are not just breaking up. They are ending their marriage, Tungstar reports.

Choi and Cheng held a press conference over the weekend and admitted they have been married since 2006, but said a divorce was underway.

The couple announced earlier this month that they had not been together for a while, but denied they were married.

"We both thought getting married was our little secret, and we thought there was no need to let the public know," said Choi, who is a popular singer-actress. "What we have found out is that entertainers have no secrets. Ronald and I are still friends, and I hope we both have happy futures."

The couple said the decision to break up was made because they now had a better understanding of each other, and there was not another person involved.

Choi, 27, and Cheng, 38, were first spotted dating in 2004 after they collaborated on the comedy "Hidden Heroes".
