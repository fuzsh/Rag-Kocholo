        "text": "About Charlene Choi\n\nCharlene is an incredible Hong Kong Canadian musician and actress.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nEven though she was born in Canada, she moved with her parents to Hong Kong. She schooled in Rosaryhill School. In school she was very good and her fluency in the Mandarin and the Chinese language was remarkable, however she wasn’t good in the English language. She had been with Ronald Cheng a few times and by the time people realized their relationship was falling apart, it became public that they had actually already gotten married and were at the brink of a divorce.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 2000, she got her first chance in the acting industry when she was cast in “Youth Y2K”. About a year later, she was in “Funeral March”. In 2006, she was cast in “Diary”, this was when she realized she had made it. Her wonderful performance earned her a lot of nominations for awards. Prior to that, she was in “Good Times, Bed Times”, “My Wife is 18”, “Protégé de la Rose Noire” and “A Chinese Tail Story”. In 2008, she released the Cantonese single “Make a Wish”."
