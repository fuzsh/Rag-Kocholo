        "text": "My job requires me to do midyear evaluations for my staff, an always pleasant experience that I look forward to with unbridled enthusiasm and delight. Really, I’m totally telling the truth.\n\nHere’s a photo from one of my team meetings:\n\n“It’s his fault.”\n\nAnyway, as of July, I would consider these to be 2008’s Top 10 Hong Kong films. In no particular order:\n\nRun Papa Run (the #1 choice, everything else is uncertain)\n\nSparrow\n\nL For Love, L For Lies\n\nBeseiged City\n\nHong Kong Bronx\n\nPlayboy Cops\n\nShamo\n\nCity Without Baseball\n\nYes, I Can See Dead People\n\nThe Moss\n\nWow, that’s a dismal list, isn’t it? Some of the stuff that made this cut was not very good, but I had a hard time leaving them off in place of other films. There was no way that Missing, Linger, Kung Fu Dunk, or Fatal Move was making this list. They’re all more likely to make the “Worst 10″ list, though naming that right now would be useless because not much more than 20 films have been released thus far in 2008. That low number makes this the worst output from the territory since way before I was born. And I was born a while ago.\n\nThis is usually where the expected “Hong Kong movies are really lousy” rant should occur, but I maintain that this is a numbers game that would be supported if Hong Kong produced more than 50 films a year. Back when Hong Kong made 300 or so movies per year, you could expect somewhere close to 60-100 good, or at least watchable films. Percentage-wise that’s not great, but apply that percentage to current times, and you get a little less than 20 good films per year - which is more or less accurate when applied to Hong Kong Cinema in 2005-2007. If my math is bad, I apologize.\n\nThere’s also a whole other discussion here about what’s hurting Hong Kong film - i.e., lack of local support, targeting China, undue hype from the Internet, etc. - but I’ll leave that for another day. That is, if I ever talk about it at all.\n\nSome notes: Shamo and Beseiged City get included here because neither had wide theatrical release in 2007. Two films that would have made the cut are High Noon and The Way We Are, but both are thus far officially unreleased in cinemas so I’ll leave them out to see if they make the end-of-year cut. CJ7 misses the list not because it’s bad (it isn’t), but because the amount of disappointment that came with it is so disproportionally large that I couldn’t feel good about including it.\n\nAlso, I didn’t consider The Sparkle in the Dark because I haven’t seen it yet. I’m guessing it’s not going to be Top 10 material anyway.\n\nSome quick performance evaluations:\n\nShawn Yue: A- (For making so many films, and turning in decent performances)\n\nPatrick Kong: B (For continuing his streak of hit questionable-quality films)\n\nJohnnie To: C+ (Sparrow and Linger cancel each other out; the “+” is complimentary)\n\nCharlene Choi: A (She’s got a ton of projects lined up, plus she gets a sympathy bump)\n\nChow Yun-Fat: D (Where is he? If he does Red Circle, he could move up to “C” range.)\n\nSammi Cheng: B- (One upcoming film and numerous public appearances earns her some goodwill)\n\nLouis Koo: A (Many movies, no stinkers. The guy’s on a roll.)\n\nStephen Chow: C- (CJ7 was okay, but Shaolin Girl hurts the Chow brand)\n\nJackie Chan: B- (Stretching in The Shinjuku Incident, but had less than 10 lines in Kung Fu Panda)\n\nGillian Chung: D (Cut from Mei Lan Fang, and The Fantastic Water Babes is still MIA)\n\nAlex Fong Lik-Sun: B+ (Making strides)\n\nStephy Tang: B (Has shown some improvement, despite relative lack of talent)\n\nAndy Lau: B+ (Still such a hard worker; now a Justice of the Peace in Hong Kong.)\n\nLawrence Lau: A- (He made two films! Neither is awesome, but it’s nice to see him)\n\nEdison Chen: Incomplete (If Sniper and Jump get pushed to 2009, this becomes an F)\n\nJet Li: B (His projects are inconsistent, but everything is better than War)\n\nKarena Lam: C- (Trying new things, but results have not been impressive)\n\nAaron Kwok: A (Agreeing to do Storm Warriors gets him an A)\n\nEkin Cheng: B+ (Storm Warriors gets him an A, but MIA film Rule Number One hurts him)\n\nKelly Chen: B (*cough*Empress and the Warriors*cough*, but she’s getting married. Congrats!)\n\nWong Jing: C (He passes with solid, average results)\n\nJay Chou: B (Because Kung Fu Dunk was not his fault)\n\nTony Leung Chiu-Wai: A (Hard to fault the guy for anything, really)\n\nChina: Incomplete (We’ll have to see how their approval board behaves post-Olympics)\n\nIf I remember, I’ll pass out final grades at the end of the year.\n\nHere’s a photo for good measure:\n\nIn the middle of his freestyle rap,\n\nJay Chou was knocked unconscious by a flying basketball.\n\nI should not call what I’m doing blogging, because I don’t actually blog. I just post every month or so.\n\nI would apologize for this long absence from Damn You, Kozo!, but that would assume that people actually read this thing. In many ways, LoveHKFilm.com is what it is because I assume nobody ever reads it. Our lack of attentiveness to our visitors is also why we’re totally behind, and why many other sites have leapfrogged us in traffic, popularity, and online self-congratulation. It’s also why I named this blog Damn You, Kozo!, because aside from completely usurping another person’s real name and identity, Kozo simply can’t keep up with the Joneses.\n\nBruce Lee said it best:\n\n“DAMN YOU, KOZO!”\n\nAh, that feels better.\n\nAnyway, in recent Hong Kong news, this person is getting married:\n\nNOTE: Not an actual wedding photo\n\nEverybody loves Kelly Chen - provided that you talk to the correct six out of ten people. Chances are that the four out of ten people who actually liked An Empress and the Warriors can be found in those six, and why not? The film features Kelly in heavy armor, plus the wonderful sight of Leon Lai spitting on Kelly’s bare back:\n\nThe magic of the movies!\n\nThis picture cracks me up:\n\nYou could interpret this photo at least three different ways\n\nAbout Empress, someone should really talk about the genius casting one day. Thanks to the triumvirate of Donnie Yen, Kelly Chen, and Leon Lai, every audience member is guaranteed to dislike at least one person in the starring cast. Could it have killed them to cast a single actor who doesn’t have active detractors?\n\nIf you hate Hui Siu-Hung, you will go to hell\n\nEmpress and the Warriors also marks the first Mei Ah Blu-ray Disc. Ownership of a PlayStation 3 has put me on the Blu-ray bandwagon, and despite not being entirely enthused about Empress, I will be buying it. Other titles on my Blu-ray to buy list include the Infernal Affairs Trilogy, Chungking Express, and nearly anything with Tsui Hark’s name on it - short of Black Mask 2 and Missing, that is. I’d still pick up The Legend of Zu.\n\n“Wow, I’m really sorry about Missing!”\n\nHe better be.\n\nI doubt that the victory of Blu-ray over HD DVD will inspire a flood of Hong Kong catalog titles onto Blu-ray Disc. Such a flood did occur during the late nineties when DVD first hit the market, but even now, Hong Kong home video is beset by a terrible, terrible scourge that has destroyed home entertainment:\n\nThis logo is evil\n\nIllegal downloading is the evil stepchild of the above, and is responsible for far more lost revenue, but I sincerely believe that crappy VCD quality - and its willing acceptance by Hong Kong consumers - is indicative of how the populace as a whole thinks of entertainment. Basically, everyone here is okay with watching movies with poor resolution, bad color, and zero features. Given that, is it a surprise that everyone’s okay with watching the latest and greatest in Asian Entertainment on You Tube?\n\nEveryone in this photo illegally downloads\n\nBack to Kelly’s concert:\n\nProbably one of Kelly’s more conservative outfits\n\nKelly announced her upcoming marriage at the final show in her recent Hung Hom Coliseum concert series - a nice touch, since hers was the final appearance from a big star before the venue undergoes at least a year of renovation. I actually attended an earlier show (a.k.a. not the one where she said she was getting married), and here was my vantage point:\n\nKelly has always been a decent, if not spectacular singer - and really, she’s much better at singing than acting. The main draw here was her eye-popping assortment of wacky costumes and themes, which ranged from the cute bear-headed thing:\n\nLove the boots\n\nTo the mermaid thing:\n\nHopefully Disney won’t sue\n\nTo the midriff-baring thing:\n\nI think this was my favorite\n\nTo the white futuristic outfit with mega-huge goggles thing:\n\nIn the future we’ll all dress like this\n\nHere’s one with Leon Lai as an accessory:\n\nToo bad Donnie wasn’t there\n\nSpecial mention must go to Kelly for her various yoga poses and exceptional good humor, which was evident because she didn’t act bothered by the people leaving their seats during her concert. For some reason, it seemed like every number was a new excuse for a bathroom break for the audience. Some people even got up to leave early. I felt like I was at a Laker game.\n\n“Is this concert EVER going to get any better?”\n\nIn general, the concert was a fine diversion, but it was also curiously low-energy. Having attended a few other concerts in my time in Hong Kong, I must rate Kelly’s as the most non-crucial of the bunch - at least, from an audience standpoint.\n\nAbout her marriage, it managed to occupy all the newspapers for a good 2-3 days here in Hong Kong - a nice change, since the news was entirely positive, and had nothing to do with scandal, judgmental mud-slinging, or accidental exposure. Sadly, it’s the exception to the norm over here.\n\nAnyway, seeing Kelly allows me to check off yet another on my “Stars I Want To See Live, But Not Necessarily Meet” List. Now that Kelly is out of the way, my number one is sadly Leon because I’d like to see him, but yeah, meeting him is not a priority at all. If a meeting ever occurred, this could be my reaction:\n\nAn actual photo from the Kelly Chen concert\n\nIf someone asked which celebrity is the one I would most like to meet, that’s obvious: Ekin Cheng is still the number one. I hope it occurs one day, simply so we can take a picture and I can send a general “nyah-nyah” in the direction of those who think I don’t like Ekin Cheng.\n\nEkin and Charlene Choi on the set of Storm Warriors:\n\nI think they’re made of wax\n\nBy the way, I still have not written about my Aaron Kwok concert experience. It may never happen now. I’m sure he’s all broken up.\n\nHere’s a pic of him anyway:\n\n“Tetsuooooo!!!!!”\n\nAaaand one last photo of Kelly:\n\nShe has something in her eye\n\nPhoto credits: As usual, thanks to Apple Daily - with an assist from Ming Pao, Sina.com, plus the World Wide Web.\n\nWhile I’m wasting time between my Italy vacation updates - a trip which, by the way, is now one full month old - I figured I could quickly discuss the progress or lack thereof concerning the site’s review backlog. After all, it’s that and the merciless day job that are keeping me busy. You all want to hear about it, right? It seems that Fiona Sit is interested:\n\n“Hmm, why are those blog updates taking so long, anyway?”\n\nIt’s comforting to know that Fiona cares. I’m not too sure about the guy next to her, though.\n\nAfter Udine, I added up all the films I’d seen and not reviewed, from the Far East Film Festival (FEFF), the Hong Kong International Film Festival (HKIFF), and just regular theatrical release. The number came out to a whopping twenty-five. Factoring out Coffee or Tea, which I mentioned in an earlier HKIFF post, the number dropped to twenty-four.\n\nNow, some fourteen written reviews later, there are only ten left on the list. Of the ten, I have decided to excise three. The reason? I got sleepy while watching those three films, meaning three possible things: A) I may have missed something important while dozing off, B) any confusion I felt may be due to grogginess and not film quality, or C) the movies were boring, thus putting me to sleep because hey, a thrill-a-minute film would definitely have kept me awake.\n\nThis is what happens when a movie lacks action\n\nRegardless of the reason for my nodding off, I feel it’s hard to let people know my opinion on a film if I don’t end up catching all of it. It’s not very responsible - though to be honest, I hear that a few Asian Cinema publications were written using this “I saw only half of the film” reviewing technique. I did it once, for a movie called Hong Kong X-File. The shame stays with me today.\n\nI’m not a fan of partial, uninformed opinion. Hell, sometimes I even change my mind after seeing a movie three or four more times. The best example of this is probably Running Out of Time 2. At the time I considered the film to be a disappointment, but I now feel it’s a very fun, entertaining, and smart chase movie - albeit with an overly-arch sense of humor. Also, given Ekin Cheng’s career slide, I now feel like being charitable towards every film he makes.\n\nThe main lesson: I’m not always on my “A” game, and reviewing a movie that I partially slept through would be somewhat disingenous. These films deserve an actual viewing while awake and sober - something that will hopefully happen one day if they get released on DVD with English subtitles. If not, I’ll have to be content with the following memories, which I’m sure are wholly innaccurate and probably proof that I should change my profession to professional paint scraper.\n\nFeng Xiaogang disapproves of sleeping at films:\n\n“You! In the front row! Wake up!”\n\nI’ll take his advice, but frankly, the director of The Banquet is in no position to ask his audience to stay awake.\n\nAnyway, here are my mini-impressions of the three films that I fell asleep at. DISCLAIMER: the following mini-reviews are not really reviews, and fully belong in the blog format. That’s because I did minimal research, and made zero attempt to talk about the films or the filmmakers outside of my own instant experience. If I blogged about my dinner or coffee before or after these films, it may actually be appropriate because that’s what blog posts like these are like. Web Film Criticism 2.0: the online version of dinner and a movie.\n\nFilm I slept at No. 1: In Love We Trust\n\nYu Nan wakes up from a nightmare where\n\nshe appeared in a megaflop directed by\n\nthe Wachowski Brothers\n\nDirected by Wang Xiaoshuai, this Chinese drama proffers up a particularly fun premise: adultery for a good cause! Basically, a divorced couple consider siring a new child to provide an organ transplant for an older one whose illness is fast becoming terminal. Of course, each person has a new partner, who may not go for extramarital action, even if the cause is a good one. Human emotions can be tricky things.\n\nThe great things about this film: the screenplay, the acting, and the approach, which sidesteps the Curse of the Asian Tearjerker(TM) and features unspoken realization and complex characterization in place of bile-spewing Oscar clips or egregious displays of weeping. This is a film about decisions, not outcomes, and it deserved to be lauded at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nI fell asleep when the half-hour setup began to drag. When I woke up, I wasn’t sure which couple I was watching, so I had to reacquaint myself with them on the fly. By the time the plot kicked in, I was hooked, but I do feel that I missed a lot. If I spoke Mandarin, I could solve this issue because there’s an unsubbed DVD available in China. I don’t speak Mandarin, so I am a waste of space.\n\n“I told you not to fall asleep! Why must you make me so upset?!?”\n\nBy the way, this film featured small turns by Gao Yuanyuan and Tian Yuan, and stars Yu Nan from Tuya’s Marriage and - get this - Speed Racer! No Rain, however.\n\nFilm I slept at No. 2: Your Friends\n\nNo, they’re not my friends, they’re your friends\n\nShojo manga alert! Your Friends tells the could-be-very-sappy story of a disabled girl, her friendship with another girl who has a terminal disease, and her search for the perfect cloud to honor that friend. My description does the film an incredible disservice, however, as Your Friends is actually sensitive, well-made, and quite restrained - though the overt symbolism of the clouds was still a bit much for my sleepy brain cells. Your Friends sounds like a ten-ton weepie requiring about sixty tissues, but thankfully it stays restrained enough to qualify as something a bit more accomplished. I’m sure it would have worked equally as well as a manga, however.\n\nThis one put me to sleep immediately because it features lots of shots of clouds and blue skies, and only serves up tinkly music when it’s time to cut to a new segment featuring yet another of “your friends”. This is a flashback-filled tale with many young actors all wearing school uniforms. Not that I couldn’t tell them apart - I could, but after waking up forty minutes into the film, it took me an extra ten to realize that the film had shifted segments on me, and was concentrating on a new girl instead of a previous one, though one of the girls hanging around was the same.\n\nWhat the above means: there were three young girls featured in the first forty minutes of the film, and not just two, but my nap required me to perform some extra mental gymnastics to realize that we were following one girl’s experience with two different friends, and not just two girls all the time. Director Hiroki Ryuichi made things even more difficult for my sleep-deprived brain because he decided to shoot his film in mostly long shots and long takes, meaning I had to wait an age for the rare close-up to get a good look at anyone. Frankly, the wait was sometimes so long that I was able to take a nap.\n\nFor the record: one of the three girls was also in Adrift in Tokyo - which I didn’t fall asleep at. There are also a bunch of boys, including a guy who was in the Nodame Cantabile drama. I’m not using their real names here because I didn’t do any research before writing this blog post - in which case I would have dug up a name or two. Call it me being lazy, but there are many online film reviewers who don’t do the proper research before writing their reviews. A note to those reviewers: we’re all on the same level.\n\nEveryone in this photo has a film-related blog:\n\n“We support Hilary AND we blog about Asian movies!”\n\nI think the lesson here - besides check who’s writing those blogs you frequent - is that responsible journalism is hard to practice, and I’m not a complete saint in that department. Truthfully, Your Friends has plenty of fans, so my sarcastic sleepy-eyed review should be taken with a couple thousand grains of salt. Maybe our actual friends deserve to be insulted, but Your Friends is better served by respectful quotes like “a new wave classic” and “I see my friends in the clouds, too”. It’s better than the damning, “It was okay, but then I fell asleep” judgement that I would probably otherwise make.\n\nHonestly, I will try to see this movie again someday. I’m getting a venti Starbucks beforehand.\n\nFilm I slept at No. 3: Ta Pu\n\nIf you cheat, they shoot you\n\nThe tale of a bunch of overage students taking university entrance exams in rural China, Ta Pu is a film definitely worth watching - but I’ll have to see it again, because this time I completely messed up and fell asleep a total of THREE Times during the film. The first time was about ten minutes after the film started, the second time was when the students were all sitting in a classroom, and the third time someone had already failed the exam and the other students weren’t doing so hot themselves. Not really a commercial film, Ta Pu relates a post-Cultural Revolution time in Chinese history, when all those sent-down laborers got the chance to get out of the sticks and get themselves their long-delayed education. NOTE: a friend told me that info and I remember it - no research required!\n\nThe message of the film seemed to be that the best intentions of Chinese youth won’t help them get into University, and lots of everyday, China-specific stuff will get in way of that new-fangled progress thing called an education. Yes, I’ve just insulted a fine motion picture with an insincere synopsis - but that’s what happens when you fall asleep in a movie and struggle to recall exactly what went on. The moral: someone should fire me from this website. The other moral: seeing five movies a day can kill almost anyone, especially a person who doesn’t sleep that much anyway.\n\nThe positive is that I stayed awake in Italy long enough to take this photo of Kelly Lin and Lau Ching-Wan:\n\nHer hair is blocking Johnnie To’s profile\n\nThe negative: I totally shafted Ta Pu because of my nap attacks, and even though my memory seems to tell me that it was a film worth seeing, I can’t recall enough specifics to piece together why exactly I thought that. Rather than faking it and going for the three-paragraph review, I’ll come clean and admit the truth: I probably saw only 40% of the film in a lucid state, and my impressions are mostly gleamed from a personal fill-in-the-blank exercise involving the fest catalog, a blank notepad, and a diagram meant to describe the character relationships. I never did figure out all the details, but this is what I drew up:\n\nI think it’s a dog\n\nAs punishment, I’ll promise to review movies responsibly, honestly, and with more integrity than I did last week. I’ll get started on it right away.\n\nFiona is glad we had this conversation.\n\n“I’m Fiona Sit, and I approve of this blog.”\n\nI figured I had to get this thing started sooner or later. I’ve neglected to write about so many things that this blog will soon turn into some sort of 20/20 hindsight memoir. I still haven’t blogged about the Aaron Kwok concert experience - and that was like 4 months ago.\n\n“What, you still haven’t blogged about me?\n\nBut I’m just so bloggable!”\n\nYou sure are.\n\nAnyway, since I’m now 10 reviews into the 24 movie backlog I’ve amassed - with absolutely no guarantee that I will actually be able to review all 24 films - I figured I should get started with the blogging too. It’s not like I have to get my whole trip out in just one post. Worst case scenario is I only get one part done and I forget the rest. It wouldn’t be the dumbest thing I’ve ever done online. The dumbest thing? Probably admit that I enjoy Seven Swords.\n\n“Thanks! You may be the only person in\n\nHong Kong who still thinks I can direct!”\n\nAnyway, on to the trip.\n\nI think Hong Kong people primarily take pictures of two things: toys and food. Not to be outdone, I did exactly the same during my trip to Italy. I also took pictures of people and buildings, but I consider that a moot point because we all take pictures of people and buildings. I just didn’t take any photos of myself.\n\nRegardless, this is a rare photo without food or Yotsuba in it.\n\nIn Italy, the cars are small\n\nNot too long ago, I managed to journey to Italy for the Udine Far East Film Festival. This photo-essay is pretty much all I brought back, besides a copy of the 10th Anniversary Book and the Festival Catalogue, which features more information about Asian films than I could ever pretend that I know. And I can pretend that I know a lot.\n\nBefore I left for Italy, Yotsuba sat on my office desk with a couple of her friends:\n\nHaving a plush CJ7 may somehow be more\n\nsatisfying than owning the DVD\n\nAfter we got to Italy, this is what she looked like:\n\n“This canal behind me smells great!”\n\nYotsuba is a fine toy to bring on trips. Not only is she small and poseable, but she’s got an interchangeable head so you can pretend that she’s experiencing mood swings. It’s like bringing another person along, except this one doesn’t speak or hit you up for money.\n\nOh, yeah, I went to a film festival. From the outside it looked like this:\n\nNobody in this photo enjoyed Empress and the Warriors\n\nThe fest is located in Udine, a small city about a two-hour train ride from Venice. My photos of Udine are like the one four photos up: empty and quiet. Udine is a peaceful place, and much nicer to walk around in than, say Venice. Just compare these photos:\n\nUdine\n\nVenice\n\nBig difference, eh? I’m not a crowd person, so yes, I much prefer Udine to Venice. So does Yotsuba. When faced with crowds, she gets murderously angry. This is Yotsuba with her unhappy face:\n\nSomeone must pay\n\nI went to Venice on the film festival’s Horror Day, so I ended up skipping a whole day of blood and screaming and exchanged them for wall-to-wall tourists and overpriced gelato. One could argue it was exactly the same experience, only with more walking.\n\nAnyway, since I was on vacation, I had gelato at 12:16 pm.\n\nMy crappy Swatch is proof of my poor eating habits\n\nI had some nice food in Italy, too - like this insanely huge calzone that ended up counting as 2.5 meals.\n\nI ate this in three bites\n\nOf course when you’re on vacation you have to eat well. I was lucky and got to attend many nice dinners with insane spreads that tripled my calorie count. Like this one:\n\nThe reason for my current two-month period of fasting\n\nIf I were to rate my trip on the food experience alone, I’d probably give it an A-minus. I won’t give it a solid A because I never give anything a solid A. The film reviews I write are proof of that.\n\nNo trip to Italy would be complete without a shot of a gondola in a canal:\n\nRush hour!\n\nA picture of a dog chained to a wall is required, too:\n\nThe black terror of Venice\n\nIn the interests of equal time, here’s a cat:\n\nHe’s relaxed because the dog is chained up\n\nI also took a picture of one of these:\n\nVespa!\n\nPlus another one of food:\n\nTo clarify possible confusion, I should note\n\nthat this picture was taken BEFORE eating.\n\nBy the way, the above picture is of wild herb risotto, and it was excellent - though a quick glance may make someone think ”partial digestion”. I shan’t elaborate.\n\nThat pretty much wraps up Part One of my Italy trip. Part two will probably talk more about movies and my general impression of the Udine Far East Film Fest. Here’s a spoiler: I enjoyed myself. Unfortunately, none of the enjoyment mentioned in this post has anything to do with Asian film, meaning I’ve broken the #1 rule of LoveHKFilm.com Blogs: stay on topic. The #2 rule is try to blog at least once a week. Looks like I’ve broken that rule, too.\n\nLet’s leave with this photo:\n\nMe and some guy I met at the airport\n\nI hear he had a good time in Italy too.\n\nAgain, it’s been a while. Chow Pak-Ho wears the message that I wish to share:\n\nI know one person who owns this shirt,\n\nand about seventy-five people who should wear it.\n\nWelcome to your regularly scheduled bi-weekly Damn You, Kozo! blog post. As usual, I’d like to thank Apple Daily for supplying all our photos. Frankly, they’re the greatest newspaper in the history of time EVER.\n\nKelly Chen’s facial expression shows her appreciation of my sarcasm:\n\n“Do you have to be such a prick?”\n\nOn to the actual subject here: Man, I’m beat.\n\nThe Hong Kong International Film Festival has finally ended the majority of its program, and I have zero screenings left to attend. I saw some good films and some bad films at the fest. Most will be showing up on LoveHKFilm.com as reviews, but there will likely be a few that I don’t touch. One film in particular I don’t wish to review because I was so unimpressed with it that even writing about it makes me sad. Also, despite the general perception that I’m picky and mean, I find negative opinion tiring and sometimes more damaging than saying nothing at all. So…at least one film won’t get reviewed.\n\nShawn Yue is down with that:\n\n“Man, that’s awesome! I’ve so got the munchies.”\n\nI also won’t be reviewing another film, Coffee or Tea, until its official theatrical release because the fest screening had a temp music track that I found egregiously overblown. As a result of its completely overwrought music score, my perception of the entire film was probably affected. I would prefer to wait a few months until its finalized before I pass judgment on whether or not I liked it.\n\nAlso, I got ill during the fest and missed three films, including a couple I was really looking forward to. Those films were the award-winning Home Song Stories, and quite sadly, the Lawrence Lau duo City Without Baseball and Besieged City. I’ll have to check them out later, but my attempt to be timely has failed miserably.\n\nI did drag myself out of bed those days to check out a few films that I really wanted to see, including Sylvia Chang’s Run Papa Run, but thanks to my lack of complete recovery, I ended up with a five-to-seven day period of sluggishness and discomfort I fondly refer to as “Hell in March”. As a result of the sick days my work fell way behind, my LoveHKFilm.com review writing fell way behind, and this blog - which occupies a lower rung on the importance ladder than everything else in my life - fell totally behind.\n\nSo yeah, I’m tired. This is what I look like now:\n\nPermanent ink is a real killjoy\n\nFilm Festivals are tiring - and potentially dangerous to my health - but I have to say that I really enjoy them. Prior to coming to Hong Kong, I was never really partial to film fests, but after attending a few here, I’ve changed my mind. I now like film festivals so much, that I simply can’t go a whole month without a new one.\n\nAs a result, I’ll be off to another film festival at the end of the week, the Far East Film Festival in Udine, Italy, where I’ll get to see one of Johnnie To’s new PTU television movies, plus The Sparrow, and a bunch of other Asian films that I look forward to checking out. I’m not sure why I’ve decided to go film-fest-o-rama with my life, but hey, that’s where the wind is taking me right now: to Italy, and far away from Hong Kong’s increasingly muggy weather.\n\nAs far as LoveHKFilm.com is concerned, all this rampant movie-watching means that I should probably institute a 600-words-or-less limit when writing future reviews because my potential review backlog will likely number twenty or more films. The other option is to turn off that portion of my brain, not review anything, and just act like your average paying audience member. It could make me happier. Like this man:\n\nAndy Lau is thinking of the poor people\n\nwho paid to see All About Love.\n\nAlso, during my time in Italy, I will be completely unwired. I don’t have a working wi-fi laptop, and I don’t intend to queue for public workstations so it’s entirely possible that I won’t be checking out this site, this blog, or the entire damn Internet for close to a week. Once I return from Italy, I’ll have a whole slew of Hong Kong movies to catch up on reviewing, including the sequel to Barbara Wong’s Truth or Dare, plus the new Wong Jing spectacular My Wife is a Gambling Maestro. There’s also that Jet Li/Jackie Chan debacle movie, The Forbidden Kingdom, to check out.\n\nConsidering the above, this may be the only time I update Damn You, Kozo! in April. I would say that’s sad, but anyway, most of the stuff that appears on blogs is extraneous and unnecessary, so we can think of this month as simply “cutting the fat” from this website and the World Wide Web at large. I’m happy to do my part to slim down the Internet. We should get an award for Bandwidth Conservation.\n\nThese guys are also enthused:\n\n“We support your decision to conserve bandwidth!\n\nPlease stop this website and blog immediately!”\n\nNo problem. I’ll get right on it.\n\nLast week, I posted the 13th LoveHKFilm Awards, so now would be a good a time as any to talk about the genesis and development of this not-so-prestigious event. Basically, there was no genesis. I made it up one day to add to my nifty new website because hey, I had time on my hands. When one is bored, they frequently come up with new and creative ways to pass the time. Just ask this guy:\n\n“Whew! I have a lot of time on my hands.\n\nMaybe I’ll take up photography.”\n\nPardon our interruption to beat a dead horse. Frankly, the above horse is so entertaining that I think I’ll be walloping it well into 2008. I have not yet figured out how to make fun of Isabella Leong’s recent media blitz.\n\n“I get into the craziest messes! Silly me!”\n\nAnyway, back to LoveHKFilm Awards. Originally I created them just because I felt like being self-important. Oddly, I now get occasional emails from people asking me when the LoveHKFilm Awards will get announced. It’s almost like the awards actually mean something. I’m amazed that such a thing would ever happen because my opinion is about as important as the person who took your ticket stub on your way into the cinema. Hell, his opinion may be more qualified than mine, because I’m sure he sees more movies than I do.\n\nBut nobody sees more crappy Hong Kong movies than me. At least, that’s what occurred with this year’s LoveHKFilm Awards, which I decided to hand out this year via committee.\n\nSome background: back when I lived in the United States, I watched most of my Hong Kong movies alone, and what few I could catch with friends usually fulfilled one of the following questions, “Does it have action? Does it have Jackie Chan? Does it have hot chicks?” A few of my friends managed to expand their range to become partial to the fine work of Andy Lau or Sammi Cheng, but nobody would go out of their way to see My Sweetie with me, no matter how cute that Stephy Tang was. That was my life a few years back.\n\nBut here in Hong Kong I know a few suckers friends who will check out all the latest Hong Kong movies with me, up to and including such fine motion pictures as Beauty and the 7 Beasts and The Lady Iron Chef. Really, if you must test the loyalty of your friends, the surest way is to ask them to see a Wong Jing movie with you. If they say yes, then you’ve found a friend for life.\n\n“Do you really think I care if my movies suck?”\n\nAnyway, since I know people who are interested in seeing Hong Kong films, I figured why not ask them to help decide what 2007’s best Hong Kong movies were? Seven other such people took pity on me and agreed, leading to this year’s first LoveHKFilm Awards by committee. What’s the significance of this? Well, since it’s not just one person who’s coming up with these picks, perhaps this will be seen as more fair or balanced. Opinions are subjective, and mob rule consensus is always preferable to the voice of a single dictator person.\n\nKelly Chen agrees:\n\n“Yes, your LoveHKFilm Awards are quite fair.\n\nNow get your foot off my head!”\n\nSo, hopefully this will be the first of many “jury-chosen” LoveHKFilm Awards. I’ll describe the simple rules below to account for the few discrepancies that exist between these awards and the other, more official ones out there. At the very end, I’ll print my personal picks because then you’ll know how I voted. If you stop reading along the way, no one will blame you.\n\nRULES for the 2007 LoveHKFilm Awards:\n\nFilms under consideration must have premiered theatrically or on home video in Hong Kong in 2007. Exceptions to this rule are movies that only found distribution in 2007, but may have premiered in earlier years. Examples would be The Postmodern Life of My Aunt, which is considered a 2006 film thanks to an international fest premiere or The Third Eye, which premiered at the 2006 Hong Kong International Film Festival, but only came to DVD in 2007. Conversely, Shamo is considered 2007 by some sources (e.g. The Golden Horse Awards), but since nobody saw it in 2007, it’ll be counted in 2008. It’s already a lock for Best Fashion Accessory.\n\nIn addition, for a film to be eligible, it must meet 3 of the following 4 criteria:\n\n1. The film contains Hong Kong investment. Totally important, and a major reason that both Lust, Caution and The Sun Also Rises - two films passed over for consideration by the Hong Kong Film Awards - count here.\n\n2. The film features a Hong Kong actor in a prominent, if not starring role. Probably the biggest film on the bubble here is Jay Chou’s Secret, which only has one definite Hong Kong actor - Anthony Wong - in a key supporting role. Both leads are Taiwan-based, so this movie almost got cut from consideration. We counted it anyway. Not that it matters because it won nothing.\n\n3. The film features a Hong Kong director, i.e. a director who either hails from Hong Kong, or whose career is largely associated with Hong Kong Cinema. Ang Lee probably doesn’t qualify as a Hong Kong director, and neither does Jiang Wen. However, both their films matched the other 3 criteria, so we counted them both. Make sense?\n\n4. It must feature a Chinese language prominently. A movie like The Touch would still get consideration despite being shot in English, because it fulfills the three of the four above criteria. However, My Blueberry Nights would get knocked out because it’s all in English and doesn’t have a Hong Kong actor. Wong Kar-Wai doesn’t need our help, anyway.\n\nThe above rules didn’t prevent some issues from occurring. One major issue was whether or not to let Lust, Caution in, not only because of its lack of inclusion in all of Hong Kong’s film awards, but also because if it were allowed in, it might sweep everything and make us look like one of your typical snooty awards societies. Well, we did leave it in, and it did win everything. My curiosity demands that we do a hypothetical do-over to see what would occur in a world without Ang Lee.\n\nAlso, to be clear about something: not everyone in the jury saw every film that was eligible for inclusion. I myself missed two films, House of the Invisibles and Fear Factors, but that’s not that big a deal because nobody else on the jury saw them either, and I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that neither film would be giving Lust, Caution a run for its money. All jury members saw the majority of the films, and most saw any film up for a quality award (i.e., not some jokey or crappy award). I myself saw every single film under consideration, including that terrible Francis Ng film The Closet.\n\nThe problem that does exist though, is that means a film can be hurt by not enough people seeing it. This was possibly the case for The Sun Also Rises, which was seen by a little over half of the jury, but not by all. As a result, I did some awesome mathematical re-jiggering (Whoops! Are we allowed to use that word anymore? PC Police, help me out!) to make sure lesser-seen films had extra representation. The solution probably wasn’t foolproof, but hey, we did the best we can. It’s not like anyone around here got paid.\n\nThough it must be noted: one person on the jury did not see Lust, Caution, which means that every other vote for Lust, Caution got an extra boost. That boost could have propelled it past Hooked on You, which had nearly the same score as Lust, Caution and was seen by the entire jury. So, if the last person had seen Lust, Caution and had decided that it was complete and utter crap, they would have not given it any points, thus making Hooked on You the winner of our Best Picture award. Add to this the fact that the person who didn’t see Lust, Caution opted out due to disinterest, and you have the definite possibility that Hooked on You wins Best Picture.\n\nAll things considered, it’s possible that Hooked on You got robbed by the LoveHKFilm Awards.\n\n“What? My movie got robbed\n\nby your crappy awards? Screw you, Kozo!”\n\nAnyway, here are my personal picks for the LoveHKFilm Awards:\n\nThe 10 Best Films:\n\n1. Lust, Caution\n\n2. Mad Detective\n\n3. Hooked on You\n\n4. The Sun Also Rises\n\n5. Exodus\n\n6. Mr. Cinema\n\n7. The Postmodern Life of My Aunt\n\n8. The Pye-Dog\n\n9. Magic Boy\n\n10. The Detective\n\nThe 10 Worst Films:\n\n1. Wonder Women\n\n2. Anna & Anna\n\n3. The Drummer\n\n4. House of Mahjong\n\n5. Kung Fu Mahjong 3 - The Final Duel\n\n6. Beauty and the 7 Beasts\n\n7. Love Is Not All Around\n\n8. Kung Fu Fighter\n\n9.

Super Fans\n\nBest Actor: Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (Lust, Caution)\n\nBest Actress: Siqin Gaowa (Postmodern Life of My Aunt)\n\nBest Supporting Actor: Ronald Cheng (Mr. Cinema)\n\nBest Supporting Actress: Teresa Mo (Mr. Cinema)\n\nBest Director : Jiang Wen (The Sun Also Rises)\n\nBest Screenplay: Wai Ka-Fai, Au Kin-Yee (Mad Detective)\n\nBest New Artist: Tang Wei (Lust, Caution)\n\nMost Underrated Film: Magic Boy\n\nMost Overrated Film: The Warlords\n\nMost Bizarre Film: Ming Ming\n\nBiggest Disappointment: Blood Brothers\n\nBest Action: Invisible Target\n\nBest Production Values: Warlords\n\nWorst Production Values: House of Mahjong\n\nMost Underrated Performer: Eason Chan (Hooked on You)\n\nFunniest Performer: Louis Koo (Triangle)\n\nBest Overacting: Chow Yun-Fat (The Postmodern Life of My Aunt)\n\nWorst Overacting: Tony Leung Ka-Fai (The Drummer)\n\nTaking Up Space: Tsui Tin Yau (Who’s Next)\n\nCareer Suicide: Barbara Wong (Wonder Women)\n\nAnd, to honor the old Webmaster-only LoveHKFilm Awards and its silly categories:\n\nMost Annoying: Jim Chim Sui-Man (Simply Actors)\n\nMost Charismatic: Guey Lun-Mei (Secret)\n\nMost Loveable: Kate Yeung (Magic Boy)\n\nMissing in Action: Anita Yuen Wing-Yee (Protege)\n\nFunniest Film: In Love with the Dead\n\nEntertainer of the Year: Eason Chan, even if he did appear in Brothers\n\nThe Special Award: Wonder Women, because it was so very, very, very special\n\nThe Winner of Many of Next Year’s Awards: Edison Chen, for a zillion obvious reasons\n\nAnyway, that’s it for this year’s LoveHKFilm Awards. Startling and scandalous, wasn’t it? Well, probably not, because these awards aren’t official and will likely be ignored by everyone in the Hong Kong entertainment industry. But hey, it was interesting, right?\n\n“No, it wasn’t, and never claim that it was again. Got it?”\n\nSorry, man.\n\nThe LoveHKFilm Awards are being announced today, which I’m sure is so exciting that it’s got the attention of hordes of people. Here’s a look at a crowd anxiously awaiting the results:\n\nOoooo! LoveHKFilm Awards!\n\nThis was the first year I did a nomination-and-selection-by-jury sort of thing, and I could probably write a whole post about the actual behind-the-scenes experience. I won’t though, because full disclosure on the ins and outs of running LoveHKFilm.com is impossible - not to mention possibly damaging. Over the years, I’ve learned that I can’t talk about all the little things that happen around this website because I may inadvertently step on someone else’s toes, or hurt the feelings of those whose personal sensitivity needs to be taken down a notch. Decipher that however you wish.\n\nEdison wants you to stop the hate\n\nOriginally, I was a little more forthcoming about my personal life in the Life with Kozo columns. One reader even wrote in to tell me that Life with Kozo was much more “warm” than the Damn You, Kozo! replacement, and I happen to agree. Life with Kozo really was a personal column because LoveHKFilm.com was created as a personal website. My personal experiences and interests really helped determine a great deal of this site’s initial content. Even the most minor words on this site sometimes had a personal reason behind them.\n\nSince those early days, traffic and readership has grown, so I’ve kind of adjusted. It’s now my primary objective to write about what people want rather than what I want to talk about. I’ve tried to put my personal obsessions aside, and instead have attempted to make sure that whatever gets printed on this site is accessible and fair to the people visiting it. So, even if I do make minor personal asides on this website, I don’t let it get in the way of why people come here in the first place: to read about Hong Kong movies.\n\nAt least, that’s what I try to do.\n\n“Kozo cares about the reader. Remember that!”\n\nAlso, in the past six years my daily life has changed to the point where it’s regularly identified with this website, so if I talk about personal stuff online it could possibly affect the people I interact with daily. When I had no job and ran this thing from my bedroom, there was little danger of anyone being affected, but now that I work in an office of 100+ people and regularly deal with people who read or can choose to read this website, I have to rein things in a little. As a result, there are no columns like this one, which I strangely took the time to read the other day. That’s fine, because nobody who reads this site should really care about my mid-life crises.\n\nOddly, I found that I really enjoyed reading that previous column. It was about me though, so I’m heavily biased. That’s the curse of the “all about me” blogsphere.\n\nI admire myself in much the same way that this guy admires himself\n\nAnyway, the reason for this little trip down Life with Kozo lane is because someone asked me why I chose March 15 for the day to release the LoveHKFilm Awards. Well, if someone wishes to know the general significance of March 15, they can always check Wikipedia.\n\nMy personal response to the above question was that it was a convenient day because it was 3 weeks after the announcement of the nominations. But I have to admit, when I originally looked at the calendar to choose a day for the award announcement, March 15 leapt out very, very quickly. This is why:\n\nWARNING!\n\nSelf-indulgent\n\npersonal memory ahead.\n\nTurn back if you’re\n\ndetermined not to care.\n\nAs I mentioned above, even the smaller decisions on this website have a personal reason. My decision to select March 15 as the award roll-out date is one of them. A former high school friend of mine once claimed March 15 as his birthday. The last time I talked to him was over sixteen years ago, when I dropped by his apartment to complain about my crappy roommate experiences. Unfortunately, I was too young, stupid, and self-absorbed to pay attention to whether or not he was having a good day, month or year. As a result, our entire encounter that day consisted of me bitching, and him putting up with me because he was too polite to tell me to shut it. Some weeks later, he took his own life.\n\nI was not exceptionally close to him when he left, but having known him for many years, I felt a terrible loss. Selfishly, the thing that sticks with me years later is how when I last saw him I was too busy complaining about my own circumstances to ask him a simple question: “How are you?”\n\nThere’s an obvious lesson here, and while I learned it a long time ago, it took me many years of practice to make it a part of my daily life. To talk about the specifics would probably be too self-involved and uninteresting to the vast majority of the people who read this, but for better or worse, it’s part of what makes me who I am today. So no matter what, March 15 means something to me.\n\nThe small side story to my March 15 experience is that it was also the birthday of a girl I once had feelings for. The two of us got along quite well for a few months, and then, to borrow an oft-used phrase, IT ALL WENT TO HELL. I was basically told to take an unceremonious permanent hike, and after some pushing and pulling, I took the hint.\n\nSince I met this girl only a year after my friend died and she possessed the same birthday as him, I thought at the time that there might be some deeper meaning to our chance acquaintance. Obviously, back then I was a total moron who had read too many astrology books, and was so self-absorbed that I would fool myself into thinking something so patently absurd. My teenage years are filled with similar tales of self-aggrandizing idiocy.\n\nMarch 15 also reminds me of that girl, but whereas once it meant bitterness and regret, I now feel only a mild annoyance - kind of like if someone mentions to me how damn good The Drummer is. To further pad this trip down useless memory lane, a couple of years ago the girl sent me an email with a “How are you, I’m doing great, sorry about back then” message - which happened to be a full ten years since the last time I spoke to her. I never replied to her email because not everything in our lives should be canonized as having meaning, and frankly this situation is one of them. Sometimes, things should be left where they are: in the past and forgotten.\n\nI’m not sure why I chose to write about this subject on Damn You, Kozo! because it doesn’t really fit the blog’s usual “Damn You, [random celebrity]!” M.O. Still, the story does have some roundabout connection to LoveHKFilm.com besides the March 15 thing. After my friend died, I became closer to his older sister, and in 1993 she and another once-dear friend took me to a little movie called Days of Being Wild - which became the first Hong Kong film I ever saw that didn’t involve John Woo or Jackie Chan.\n\nAlso, when that girl I once liked e-mailed me ten years later, she found me through, duh, LoveHKFilm.com. Perhaps I should have used the Internet’s famous anonymity to my advantage when creating this website, but I did not foresee that it would last past year two of its existence. Had I known things would end up this way, I would have hidden my identity, or at least found a way to pretend that Kozo is tall, handsome, and still in his twenties.\n\nOh well, too late to change the past. Thanks for reading this far. As a result of this post, LoveHKFilm.com’s Alexa ranking just dropped another 3745 spots.\n\nTo end this, here’s a fun photo of a little girl pwning Eason Chan:\n\n“Hey, that hurts! Why you little…”\n\nI have yet to share my experience at Aaron Kwok’s recent Hong Kong concert, though this picture is likely worth a thousand words:\n\n“I’m just acting! Really!”\n\nI’ll remember to talk about it in detail one day, but I can probably sum it up right now in one word: fabulous.\n\nBack to the main subject of this post: Ekin Cheng’s manager, Sandy Lamb San-San reportedly told media today that Ekin would hold a concert somewhere in Hong Kong to celebrate his twentieth(!) year in the entertainment industry. It likely won’t be at the Hung Hom Coliseum because sadly, Ekin probably isn’t big enough for that venue anymore.\n\nBut who cares? It’s an Ekin Cheng concert and I’m in Hong Kong to see it. I can’t begin to tell you how long I’ve waited for this day.\n\nI predict my experience at the concert will involve the following:\n\n- The concert will start late because all Hong Kong concerts start late. I predict at around 8:15 pm.\n\n- Ekin will wear something shiny. - Jordan Chan will be the guest performer and they’ll talk about how old they are.\n\n- I will bring a neon sign with “梁詠琪” printed on it.*\n\n- At 8:18 pm, I’ll attempt to throw a DVD copy of For Bad Boys Only at Ekin’s head to let him know that I’m still upset about paying to see it in the theater. Thanks to YesAsia.com’s previous “Buy 3 Get 1 Free” campaign, I now own multiple copies of the DVD so I’ll have multiple chances to tag him in the noggin. If I bring some VCDs, I can double my ammunition.\n\n- I’ll hire someone to run up on stage to heckle Ekin for every single time he killed or help kill Roy Cheung or Francis Ng in a movie. I count six times, for Young and Dangerous, Young and Dangerous 3, Young and Dangerous 4, Born To Be King, A Man Called Hero, and Heroic Duo. I’ll throw in a seventh and eighth time for Infernal Affairs 2 because both Roy and Francis died in that, and I believe Ekin was responsible even though he didn’t appear in the film.\n\n- At 8:23 pm, I’ll fend off my first attack from irate fans. I may bring pepper spray.\n\n- At 8:27 pm, I’ll be escorted out by 4 security guards, one of whom will say to me, “I love your site, even though I don’t always agree with your reviews.”\n\n- On my way out I’ll buy a ticket for the second concert to continue pursuing my dream.\n\nSadly, I probably won’t even be able to make it inside the second concert because members of the Ekin Cheng Forum will show up in force to stop me, likely assisted by their irate boyfriends, who have been forced to skip a PSP ad-hoc wireless party to beat up some guy outside the Ekin Cheng concert.\n\nI cannot predict the outcome of the ensuing melee, but I hope Roy Cheung or Francis Ng appear to back me up. Roy and Francis, if you’re reading this, please show up. Thanks to Exiled and Once Upon a Time in Triad Society 2, I believe you both have the ability to kick ass.\n\nIf you’re in Hong Kong at the time, I welcome you to show up and support my cause. If anyone needs extra incentive, I found this photo on my hard drive:\n\nT-shirts don’t lie\n\nActually, I would like to own a shirt like that too.\n\n*梁詠琪 = Gigi Leung Wing-Kei"
