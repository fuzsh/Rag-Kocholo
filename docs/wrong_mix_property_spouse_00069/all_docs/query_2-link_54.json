        "text": "I’m so busy and my schedule is so freakin’ hectic but still, I get to insert this recap. Nyahaha! Should I get an award, ne? Even I’m amazed how I did it! Ahhh, the things I do for this blog.\n\nIs it just me or this episode is rather short and somehow, slowed down a bit? Anyways, it’s expected coz the drama hits a transitory phase, where new characters are being introduced and new conflicts are being weaved, so basically it needs to tone down some notch.\n\nSD episode 4 continues where Episode 3 obviously left off last week: Xi Meng personally tries to convince Luo Xi in accepting a Ou Hua Company project. And Luo Xi answers him with a mocking smile and rude words.\n\nNext: Luo Xi takes Xia Mo to their old house (their foster home), which he bought by the way. I loved that Xia Mo somehow felt something. They reminisce the good old times and Luo Xi cheers her up on her acting debut.\n\nEven with Luo Xi’s encouragement and support, Xia Mo still acts like a lifeless zombie during the shoot. And so everybody’s getting irritated and annoyed. The director snaps and throws insulting remarks. Even Ling Hao nags about her poor acting skills. After a few more takes and re-takes, the director called it a day. Xia Mo is left feeling dejected, humiliated and torn.\n\nZhen En calls and asks whether the filming went well. Xia Mo can’t afford to make her friend feel upset, so she lies and says it was okay. Right then, Luo Xi’s personal assistant came by and informs her that Luo Xi wants her to go to his house first for some celebration.\n\nWhen they arrived, Luo Xi is already asleep, too tired because of his busy sched. The assistant takes off first, leaving Xia Mo to take care of everything else. It seems that Luo Xi is having a rather troubling dream- about her mom. And Xia Mo wakes him up. Luo Xi then acts as if nothing happened and moves on to the celebration.\n\nSensing Xia Mo’s odd and disturbed behaviour, Luo Xi guesses that she’s having a tough time in the shoot. And so he suggests that they practice the lines together. Xia Mo however, declines coz she’s worried that he’ll tire himself out. Luo Xi is moved, but still doubtful, that she actually cared. Xia Mo then assures that she really did think about his welfare. Now that’s a change! And so Luo Xi smiles and gives her a quick kiss.\n\nWhen Xia Mo asks what they are celebrating about, Luo Xi laughs and confesses that he just made it up so he’ll have a reason to meet her. And then he gives her his house’s key. Xia Mo is troubled and won’t accept, but Luo Xi just won’t take no for an answer.\n\nLuo Xi: It’s okay if you don’t want it. You can even throw it away after you leave. Just don’t let me know. Let me believe that you have it so I’ll think that there are two people in this house. And even in the middle o f the night ,when I’m asleep, I can feel…there will be someone with me. Aww. So sweet.Too bad I’m rooting for Ou Chen.\n\nMeanwhile, at the mafia underground-looking office, Ou Chen mulls over the new discoveries. It’s funny that almost every time he opens a scene, he drinks some liquor. He calls his loyal butler, Xi Meng and demands that he help him out in putting the puzzle together. Xi Meng , of course, is distressed and uneasy. And so he reluctantly asks if Ou Chen already remembered everything. Ou Chen replies that he only remembers how he met Xia Mo and learns that he paid for Luo Xi’s tuition fees. He also finds out that Luo Xi bought a part of the land that the Ou Co. planned to develop. Ahh, so that was the lurking secret in Episode 3. The yellow envelop Luo Xi’s assistant handed over on the last scene.\n\nXi Meng is still not convinced that his young master should relive the past, knowing that uncovering the whole truth is unbearable. But Ou Chen is rather unyielding.\n\nOu Chen: I may have lost before, but the war just started. Destiny linked us together then, let it completely tie us. I’ll get back everything that I own.\n\nBack to Luo Xi and Xia Mo. Xia Mo thanks Luo Xi for teaching her how to act. She remembers the time when Luo Xi also taught her how to sing. Luo Xi laughs that she considers him a performing teacher.\n\n~Flashbacks~\n\nLuo Xi teaches Xia Mo and Xiao Cheng the song (I think the one he kept on singing everyday. The one with black cats and milks in the lyrics.)They are going to sing the song in a talent show. It was Xiao Cheng who wants to perform on-stage for their foster parents, and as the ever-loving sister, Xia Mo concedes.\n\nNext scene: Ou Chen invites, but more like commands, Xia Mo to ride horses with him on Saturday, which she refuses coz that was the day they have to perform. Ou Chen is getting annoyed by the minute. It’s been established that he hates the word, “No”.\n\nAnd Saturday has arrived. Xia Mo and Xiao Cheng’s performance went well. Until, Xia Mo’s stage fright creeps in. She stood there scared stiff and frozen. And so, Luo Xi, again, comes to the rescue.\n\nThat night, Xia Mo and Luo Xi had a drinking session. They laugh at what happened. This is where Xia Mo tells Luo Xi that she doesn’t hate him. It’s just that he reminds him of her past (as an orphan). Some sflashback scenes were already shown in the past episodes, so I will not elaborate on those scenes. This is an example.\n\nXia Mo is rather happy with her latest successful endeavor. She relays the fun experience to Ou Chen, who apparently doesn’t share her enthusiasm. He hates that she performs in front of a crowd and he hates it more, when Luo Xi is always by her side.\n\nEager to end a worthless argument, she decides that she’ll just quit the show. Ou Chen, however, childishly goads her further and reveals that he’ll be going back to France coz Xia Mo spends more time with Luo Xi and she doesn’t want to be with his domineering attitude anymore. Young Master is throwing another tantrum, eh?\n\nXia Mo is getting really annoyed with his immature behaviour and insists that there is nothing between her and Luo Xi. Ou Chen, however, is just being his arrogant self and scoffs that he doesn’t want to hear Luo Xi’s name and declares that he’ll resolve the issue himself. Xia Mo is confused on what he meant, but Ou Chen left off without explaining anything.\n\nAs it turns out, what Ou Chen meant is making Luo Xi disappear. Dad delivers the bad news and everybody is caught in a surprise. Luo Xi is clearly enraged, but acts as if unaffected. Poor dear. Am sure he’s feeling betrayed and abandoned right now.\n\nXia Mo is quite convinced that Ou Chen manipulated everything. She tries to talk him about it but he already went back to France. She then demands Xi Meng that Ou Chen call her ASAP.\n\nCold and detached, Luo Xi bids the family his last goodbye. He went away without even looking back. When Ou Chen called, Xia Mo treats him with pure iciness. She then convinces him to send Luo Xi abroad to study than back to the orphanage.\n\nXia Mo gets what she wants, and Luo Xi goes to study in England. This scene was already played in Episode 1.\n\nXia Mo says that she’s sorry for what happened. Luo Xi sarcastically rebut that he’s rather fortunate for being able to study in England. When he asks if it he were Xiao Cheng, would she just send him away like this, she instantly answers that she won’t.\n\nLuo Xi: Yes, you won’t leave him coz you love him. But I’m just a stranger passing by. The kid who grew up in an orphanage should not want too much. What qualifies you to get other’s love when your birth parents left you?\n\nXia Mo: We are the same, maybe I thought of defending myself against you, but I never thought of hurting you, and please believe that Xiao Cheng, mom and dad really like you.\n\nLuo Xi: Like me? Really like me? Because they like me they send me back to the orphanage. Mrs. Song also said she like me, and because of that she watched me being taken away by the police. My mom said she like me too. Because she like me she left me at the playground waiting for her for 2 days and 2 nights. This kind of liking is too cheap.\n\nXia Mo: Yes, I can only do these cheap things for you today. You don’t have to forgive me. And you can hate me. You can think I’m selfish and I hurt you. If you hate these people who hurt you, then try hard and be strong. COme back and make us regret for what we did.\n\nShe gives her an ATM card, where she deposited the prize money from the talent show and wishes that they’ll meet up again when he comes back.\n\nLuo Xi: It’s because he’s afraid that you’ll fall in love with me, right? Ou Chen wants me to leave because he’s afraid you’ll like me, right?\n\nXia Mo: Yes.\n\nLuo Xi: Then, so you like me?\n\nXia Mo: It’s not you. As long as a guy is close to me, Ou Chen will get mad.\n\nLuo Xi: You don’t like me? Then, if I leave will you miss me?\n\nXia Mo: I don’t have time to miss you.\n\nLuo Xi: So realistic. So cold.\n\nXia Mo: I’m really sorry about what happened to you. But I don’t want something like this to happen again, so I have to make myself strong and protect the people around me. But making myself strong, will need a lot of hardwork, so I won’t have time to miss you.\n\nLuo Xi: I don’t know what it’ll be the next time I see you. Maybe you’ll be so strong, I have to look up to you.\n\nXia Mo: I just want to protect my family.\n\nLuo Xi: Then what should I do? I don’t want you to forget me, although I don’t like you, but being forgotten makes me feel bad. *Leans closer* I want you to remember me forever.\n\nAnd like we don’t know what will happen next, duh! He kisses her.\n\nLuo Xi: Why didn’t you hit me? Usually, when a girl is kissed by force, she would slap the guy.\n\nOf course, she won’t! She’s Xia Mo the ice queen, remember? So she just wipe her lips as if it’s dirtied with his kiss and plays it cool.\n\nXia Mo: I’m afraid I’ll hurt my hand.\n\nLuo Xi: I’ll come back. Tell that Ou Chen, all the things he’s afraid of, I’ll make him pay double.\n\nShe promises that she’ll take care of Milk (the cat) and gives him the guitar. Luo Xi is far more hurt to be consoled with that, so he left the guitar. And then Xia Mo receives the unfortunate call.\n\n~End of Flashback~\n\nBack to the present: Zhen En complains about the make-up artist’s visible bias. Xia Mo, however, doesn’t mind and says to let it go. Zhen En is calmed and so she suggests that they use their make-up instead and hurriedly gets the set in the car.\n\nOutside the dressing room, Ling Hao (with An Hui Ni) is just being the big jerk again and warns Xia Mo. He scoffs that Xia Mo should at least show some humility by not dragging them down with her. Zhen En hears the rude remarks and counters that he’s the one without humility. Being the more experienced actor, he should just support Xia Mo.Out of nowhere, An Hui Ni then slaps Zhen En.\n\nAn Hui Ni: Yin Xia Mo, remember newcomers don’t have the right to yell in front of senior actors. That’s a rule. Teach your manager, otherwise she’ll get you into trouble later.\n\nXia Mo: Newcomers have no right to be impolite but you are qualified to fight with others? Apologize to Zhen En.\n\nAn Hui Ni is a brat, so, of course she won’t apologize even if the sky will collapse. And for that Xia Mo makes a bargain. If she can pass the scene in one take, then An Hui Ni should apologize. But if she can’t then, she’ll let An Hui Ni do whatever she wants with her. And just like any protagonist, An Hui Ni confidently takes the deal.\n\nAnd miraculously Xia Mo nailed the scene. Even Ling Hao is stunned and dumbfounded on Xia Mo’s acting prowess. All credits are given to Luo Xi, ne? Well, it isn’t too surprising for me coz, basically Bing Tong (Xia Mo’s character) is just like her in real life- passionate but cold. Huh? The irony!\n\nThe director praises Xia Mo for a job well done. Losing the bet, An Hui Ni then looks like this:\n\nZhen En is so happy with the results. She even became more forgiving and wants to let go of what happened earlier.\n\nAnd so the drama is phenomenal hit. The ratings are good and Xia Mo becomes an in demand actress. She even outshines An Hui Ni in every possible way, who BTW becomes more bitchy each day.\n\nAnd the scene where Ah Hui Ni has to slap Xia Mo finally comes. I’ve been waiting for this! Weee! She’s just too keyed up to dig her own grave, this Ah Hui Ni! She uses every possible excuses to slap Xia Mo repeatedly. And every strike is as forceful as the last. The director even supports her. Darn that director!\n\nIt’s a good thing that Ou Chen is there. But alas! He didn’t stop the slapping session. Well, he could just easily wipe off An Hui Ni , but because he knew that it isn’t what Xia Mo wants, he just stands there watching painfully. This is why I like Ou Chen, he’s not selfish, he just knows her far more than anybody else.\n\nSeeing An Hui Ni’s wicked scheme, Zhen En tries to stop the shoot and get Xia Mo out of there. But Xia Mo, won’t give up and assures her that she’s okay. With all the earth-shattering slaps and hand marks, yeah, she’s okay!\n\nSomehow Xia Mo’s body can’t take it anymore. She feels dizzy and falls in a faint. Thankfully, Ou Chen catches her. And then… 10 minutes break.\n\nZhen En cries and convinces Xia Mo to go to the hospital. But Xia Mo still refuses and says that she just needs ice. Zhen En immediately gets some ice, and meets An Hui Ni along the hallway. She begs that An Hui Ni slaps her, instead of Xia Mo, but the latter denies that she’s doing it on purpose and walks away.\n\nMeanwhile, Xia Mo cools her self off. Ou Chen watches her from afar. He really is concerned for her, so he comes up with little payback plot- role swap!\n\nAfter the break, the staff starts to film the scene again. But this time, An Hui Ni complains that she can’t get into her character. And so the directors tells Xia Mo that she should help her out and tries An Hui Ni’s character for a sec. An Hui Ni is outraged coz that means Xia Mo will have the chance to slap her back. It’s time to settle the score! Bwahaha!\n\nAnd because she’s Xia Mo, she didn’t hit her. Instead, she acted up on a totally different approach, more real and touching. After the scene, everybody is moved, even some cries for the beauty of it. I think this is a more painful slap for An Hui Ni. Sweet taste of revenge!\n\nDun…dun…dun…see you next episode. 🙂\n\nI’ve been trying my very best to limit my recaps to 2000 words but duh! I kept on ending with 4000 and more instead! NOTE TO SELF: Keep it short buddy!\n\nSummer 3 Recap\n\nI am pretty much sure that everybody still remembers how Episode 2 ended, right? Who would forget Luo Xi’s intriguing one liner? The opening scene is just so wonderfully dramatic!\n\nEven though Luo Xi appeares nonchalance, everybody knows that something is wrong. He casually sits in front of Xia Mo, holds her hands and gently reprimands her for toying with other people’s feelings. Ou Chen is outraged with Lou Xi’s gestures and words. But Luo Xi continues his display of ownership and commands Xia Mo to tell Ou Chen who he really is. As proof of their intimate relationship, Luo Xi tips her face for a kiss.\n\nMomentarily, Xia Mo seems reluctant. In voiceover: “Leave me. If you’ve already forgotten about me, then let it go”. She closes her eyes and welcomes Luo Xi’s kiss. And though, Luo Xi appeares unaffected and composed, he is much angered with what he saw and bites Xia Mo’s lips as punishment. Feeling rejected and insulted, Ou Chen walks away.\n\nIn a calm but angry voice, Luo Xi angrily blurts out: Do you feel your heart hurt? Don’t worry. You won’t hurt more than me.\n\nLater on, Luo Xi drives Xia Mo home. Apparently, he’s still much worked up with the hospital scene. He accuses Xia Mo of being cold-blooded. Xia Mo, on the other hand, is just so damn apathetic.\n\nAt home, Luo Xi is feeling down and depressed. His good friend, Pan Nan, then cheers him up. Luo Xi is surprised but jokes at her overly functional “GPS Scan”.\n\nAnd so the old friends talk about how they knew each other, reminiscing the times when Pan Nan rescued Luo Xi from the group of thieves. And after then on, how she witnessed his desperate pursuits in finding the only picture of Xia Mo. Luo Xi shares that during those times, though he had nothing, he still felt at peace.\n\nPan Nan tries to remind him of how fortunate he is now, considering that he is already a superstar and has Xia Mo by his side. Luo Xi voices out that even if that’s the case, life ain’t kind. He is afraid that once he let his guards down, life will take everything from him. And so, seeing Ou Chen again, makes him a bit threatened. Insecurity complex, eh?\n\nIt’s kinda sad when he said that he trusts Xia Mo, but not destiny. Pan Nan then advises that even if the past made him a complete cynic, he should also learn to trust since it’s also destiny that lead him back to Xia Mo. And he must be thankful for it and not let his insecurity ruin his relationship. Luo Xi just laughs it off.\n\nXia Mo is officially casted for the Ou Hong commercial. Somebody (sorry juz can’t remember the face) explains some slight problem on who will manage her. Xia Mo, on the other hand, has someone in mind- her best friend Zhen En.\n\nAnd the girls celebrate for the recent victories: Pan Nan’s CD release, Xia Mo as the official Ou Hong endorser and of course, Zhen En as Xia Mo’s manager. Zhen En is somehow reluctant to take the offer though, but Xia Mo and Pan Nan boosts her confidence and is quite optimistic that she’ll do just fine.\n\nNext day at work: Zhen En compliments Xia Mo’s pretty looks and asks about her injury. Xia Mo assures that it isn’t a big deal. But Zhen En still reminds Xia Mo that she must take care of her body coz it’s the most important capital in her entire showbiz career.\n\nRight then, Yao Shu Er and Wei Ann pops in. Shu Er is acting weird and Wei Ann definitely knows why. Wei Ann reveals that Xia Mo was kidnapped during the audition day. This revelation made Shu Er’s knees jitter. And Zhen En is rather shocked coz all the while Xia Mo kept the whole incident in secret.\n\nXia Mo tries to deny the incident but Wei Ann knows so much more. She hands in a yellow envelop to Xia Mo. Xia Mo thanks her for the effort and assures that she’ll work on it. Wei Ann meaningfully replies that there’s no need to be thankful coz she’s also doing it for herself.\n\nIn the car, Zhen En can’t seem to get over the news and suggests that they should just report the kidnapping to the police. But Xia Mo brushes it off and changes the topic.\n\nAnd so the two friends head off to Ou Company for a meeting. Zhen En and Xia Mo bumps into the Young Master Ou Chen, but he just passed by them. What’s this cold war?\n\nThe male lead, Ling Hao is just too big-headed, and a total jerk. He demands that the company change the lead actress (Xia Mo) or he won’t accept the project.Xia Mo is wretched with the news. Could it be that all she did was for nothing?\n\nOu Chen sees her pain and declares that Ling Hao has no say in the matter. Artists are chosen by the management and if he doesn’t show up in 20 minutes, Ou Co. has the right to cancel his contract and never contact him ever again.\n\nAnd so one of Ou Chen’s underlings tries to convince him to change the female lead (Xia Mo). But Ou Chen is far more adamant. Xi Meng then warns the underling not to talk about changing the actress anymore. Ou Chen asks for other possible actors. But the only suited actor is Luo Xi, and he already declined. Is this what they call a dead-end?\n\nZhen En tries to convince Ling Hao’s party for any reconsideration but still no use. Ling Hao still refuses to work with an unknown artist.\n\nJust then, Luo Xi calls. He asks if she’s angry at him coz she didn’t call when she knows he’s mad. Haha! Just can’t resist, ne? Xia Mo apologizes for being indifferent but reasons out that she doesn’t call him often anyway before. Luo Xi then invites her for lunch, which she automatically declines coz something happened. And so she relays the problem with Ling Hao’s demands.\n\nIt turns out that Luo Xi accepted the Ou Commercial. And yeah! Xia Mo is saved. Everybody celebrates, except for Ou Chen, who is much more angered than relieved. A little later, Shu Er calls.\n\nIt seems that Shu Er is running a fever. She feigns innocence and asks about the yellow envelop (the one Wei Ann gave earlier). Shu Er pretty much has an idea of what is inside. And so, Xia Mo confesses that she already knew that Shu Er masterminded the kidnapping. Actually Xia Mo already knows everything without Wei Ann’s help. Yeah, Ou Chen gave her the information right after the investigation.\n\nShu Er is rather insulted with her calm demeanor. She calls her names and aims for a slap. Xia Mo isn’t about to let her face get ruined and slaps her instead. Catfight!!!\n\nShu Er condemns Xia Mo for being such a leecher like Wei Ann ,who only used her and stole everything she had. She even regrets why she didn’t kill Xia Mo instead.\n\nXia Mo then concludes that it was also Shu Er who spreads Wei Ann’s scandalous pictures. Shu Er admits, not even a tad remorseful for what she did and bravely declares that it’s Wei Ann’s punishment for flirting her way towards stardom.\n\nXia Mo then sarcastically replies that she has no right to inflict punishment to Wei Ann. She further retorts that Shu Er should have just flirted with Jam in the first place. Of course, Shu Er wouldn’t dare coz Jam is butt ugly. Xia Mo then adds that if Wei Ann and Jam liked each other, then who are they to judge. But if Wei Ann didn’t like him and just used him, then it’s the price that she has to pay in lieu of success.\n\nShu Er, now hopping mad, scoffs at Xia Mo for doing the same dirty tricks, and brainwashed the two men (Luo Xi and Ou Chen) to get what she wants. She also used her injury to fish for pity.\n\nXia Mo counters that even so, she won the audition fair and square. And yes, though she admits in making use of her injury, at least she didn’t use other people and didn’t hurt others in the process.\n\nShu Er is rather ashamed and asks if Xia Mo doesn’t consider her as an enemy. Xia Mo then replies that she doesn’t want Shu Er to be her enemy but then if she wants war, she’s not afraid to fight. And so the decision to remain as friends rely on Shu Er alone.\n\nShu Er then spurts that it doesn’t matter coz Wei Ann will never forgive her. She’ll surely use the pictures against her. And so Xia Mo assures that she’ll deny the whole kidnapping fiasco.\n\nShu Er is again confused. Why the hell wouldn’t Xia Mo use the pictures against her? Xia Mo passively answers that using lame tricks lessens the chances for success. And besides she is her friend after all. Shu Er gets a slap on the face, not literally. She’s moved that afterall she did, Xia Mo still considers her as a friend. Xia Mo reminds Shu Er to take the medicines for her fever and takes off first.\n\nWhen Xia Mo left, Shu Er just stared guility at the medicine and cries miserably.\n\nThat night, Luo Xi comes by Xia Mo’s house. Xiao Cheng is much pleased with the visit. They chat a little. The two boys seems to have a little secret though- Xia Mo’s picture. Xiao Cheng gives way to the two lovebirds and excuses himself.\n\nXia Mo isn’t apathetic and cold-blooded afterall. She stops Luo Xi from going and drinks her heart out.\n\nXia Mo: I have said things that hurt you. Let those words be the beer I’m drinking down. I want to completely depend on someone too. I want to love and be loved without reservations. But, I’m afraid Luo Xi. Do you know I’m afraid? I’m afraid that the only person in this world who can be trusted is myself. When you lose the power to stand, when the person you trust leaves, you’ll fall hard on the ground.\n\nLuo Xi: Do you know? No one understands your feelings more than me? Give us a try.\n\nXia Mo: Why?\n\nLuo Xi: Because I love you. Perhaps you don’t believe it, But I love you. These few years, there wasn’t a single day when I didn’t think about you. You’re like a poisonous poppy seed. You’ll hurt me. You’ll stab me. You make me feel on the verge of death. But I’d rather be hurt by you than leave you.\n\nXia Mo: So, it’s the same feeling. I know you’re dangerous, but I can’t leave you. Instead, I’m seduced by you. It’s like falling into a vortex, unable to come out, constantly being pulled to your side.\n\nAnd once again, they ended the conversation with a lot of kisses.\n\nShooting day: The shoot is quite a success.\n\nAll the while Ou Chen looks from a far, having a feeling of deja vu as he looks at the yacht. Xi Meng then joins him.\n\nOu Chen: *Looking at Xia Mo* Teach me how to ignore her.\n\nXi Meng somehow shares his dilemma and replies that even his eyes doesn’t leave Xia Mo. She has all what it takes to be a star- good looks and talents.\n\nOu Chen: I didn’t notice her because of her talent. I know that for sure. Something must be wrong.\n\nAfter the whole commercial shoot, Xi Meng pays Luo Xi his talent fee but the latter refuses and says that the money will write-off all the tuition fee expenses that Xi Meng paid for him.\n\nAnd right then, Luo Xi smiles at Ou Chen provokingly. A beautiful smile that says: I own what you want. Nyahaha! Okay, so I exaggerated it a bit.\n\nAnd the commercial indeed gets media attention. And as far as everybody’s concerned, Xia Mo’s the top rising star in the whole of Taiwan. Hmm, everything’s quite doin’ fine. Don’t worry this is just the calm before the storm. 🙂\n\nAdding to her recent successes, Xia Mo gets nominated for the Best New Comer in the most renowned Golden Awards. Zhen En is ecstatic but Xia Mo reminds her that they’re just on the starting line and still has many things to do.\n\nThat night, Luo Xi comes by again. He gives her a dress to wear on the awards night. Just can’t resist quoting the cheesy lines. Sorry.\n\nLuo Xi: You’ll be the most beautiful woman at the awards ceremony.\n\nXia Mo jokingly tease why he didn’t even wish that she wins the award.\n\nLuo Xi: Getting nominated already proves that you’re good. Even if you don’t win, in my heart you’re always the best.\n\nXia Mo feigns weariness and Luo Xi offers that she rest her head on his lap.\n\nAwards Night. Just can’t help to post the cheesy moments again.\n\nAnd so Xia Mo bags the award! Of course, we know the real reason why.\n\nAll the while, Ou Chen watches the event on TV. At long last, he gets a hold of important info and pics regarding him and Xia Mo’s past. As he looks intently at the pictures, thankfully his brains finally works. He remembers bits and pieces of the past. He angrily stares at the TV (at Xia Mo). And trust me, if his eyeballs could just pop out his eye sockets, it would.\n\nOu Chen: Because you knew I’ve forgotten, so you lied to me.\n\nDunDunDun… The war begins.\n\nZhen En is much overwhelmed with Xia Mo’s award. Pan Nan joins them and sincerely congratulates Xia Mo. Xia Mo, on the other hand, is guilty for taking the award, knowing that Pan Nan and the other contenders are better than her. Pan Nan assures that she’s not a bit concerned.\n\nOutside the locker room, detractors throws foul accusations. Of course, Zhen En is ever ready to defend her friend. But it was Luo Xi who saves the day.\n\nLuo Xi really can’t get his hands off Xia Mo. He embraces her from behind, showering her bits of kisses. He comforts Xia Mo and straightforwardly admits that he can’t help but be by her side even though he just saw her last night.\n\nXia Mo: You’re just saying that because you’re scared that I was upset hearing those words.\n\nLuo Xi smiles and acts as if insulted that Xia Mo didn’t appreciate his good intentions. But then adds that she shouldn’t keep all the pain to herself. Xia Mo, however, is convinced that it was indeed an unfair fight coz Bai Yin is much better than her.\n\nLuo Xi: There are no absolute fairness and unfairness in the world. In their eyes you are not as good as Bai Yin. In my eyes, ten Bai Yins added together can’t be a match for one of your fingers. Awww.\n\nXia Mo jests that he always says the most cruel things. Luo Xi then turns Xia Mo and proposes that they live together. And Xia Mo is shocked, but is again seduced by Luo Xi’s kisses.\n\nRight on cue, Ou Chen barges in. He shows Xia Mo the pictures and throws it to the ground.\n\nOu Chen: You lied to me. Yin Xia Mo. You are mine. Why did you lie to me? Since you were with me before, why didn’t you tell me honestly? When I ask you, why did you lie to me?\n\nXia Mo: Because there was no need to tell you.\n\nOu Chen: What do you mean there was no need to tell me?\n\nXia Mo: We broke up in high school. So there was no need to tell you.\n\nAnd then he vaguely remembers the night he begged on his knees, but she heartlessly cursed him away.\n\nOu Chen: Why did we break up?\n\nXia Mo: What other reason can there be? We didn’t want to be together anymore, so we broke up.\n\nOu Chen: I don’t believe you.\n\nHe grabs her hand but Luo Xi pulls the other one.\n\nLuo Xi: What right do you have to touch her. Even you guys dated before, now she is mine.\n\nOu Chen: She is mine.\n\nLuo Xi: I will make you understand who she belongs to. *Forces Xia Mo for a kiss. I so hate him right now*\n\nFired with jealousy and anger, Ou Chen lands a solid punch on Luo Xi’s face. Before Luo Xi could retaliate, Xia Mo prevents the brawl. Ou Chen then demands what is the real score between her and Luo Xi. Xia Mo picks the pictures and then trashes it in the bin.\n\nXia Mo: There’s nothing to hold back. Everything in the past is unimportant. So please forget them.\n\nOu Chen: What happened exactly? Did I really do something wrong that made you start hating Me? You’d rather I forget you than have anything to do with me.\n\nXia Mo: No.\n\nXia Mo: Then why? What right do you have to make me give up my memory. Whether the past is important or not should be decided by me and not for you to tell now.\n\nLuo Xi butts in. “Well said. Xia Mo shouldn’t be the one telling you.Whether you remember or not that’s your business.What right do you have to question her?”\n\nOu Chen: And what right do you have to stand there and question me?\n\nLuo Xi: Xia Mo, why don’t you just tell him so that he will stop bothering you? Tell him you broke up with him because I appeared. Am I wrong? Wasn’t it because of me that you broke up?\n\nXia Mo warns Luo Xi and snaps: “Enough!”\n\nOu Chen: Is that so? Is it because of him that you betrayed me?\n\nXia Mo: No. It’s not what you think.\n\nLuo Xi won’t give in. He continues to seduce Xiao Mo, reminding her of that she already told him she likes him. Luo Xi: “You already gave me up once. Do you want to give me up the second time? Let him leave you.” And yes. Xia Mo is again trapped in his charms.\n\nOu Chen: You two will pay for this.\n\nFor the nth time, Ou Chen loses the fight. He drives off and goes to the place where the car accident happened.\n\nOu Chen: What actually happened? Why did we break up? Why? Why did you betray me?\n\nThe ever loyal butler, Xi Meng, comforts his master. Seriously, Xi Meng’s just all over the place. He always pops in out of nowhere.\n\nOu Chen is too angry for company and dismisses Xi Meng right away. But Xi Meng won’t budge and explains why he didn’t tell him the truth. Xi Meng: Ou family’s royal bloodline shouldn’t be humiliated this way. She betrayed you. Forgetting the past is a good thing. Those two doesn’t deserve to be part of your memories.\n\nAnd this gets Ou Chen’s full attention and asks if Xia Mo and Luo Xi are the reason why he had the accident. Xi Meng doesn’t answer but rather tells him: “The truth could have been too cruel for you.Though it has been many years, I can still feel the pain”.\n\nNext we see, Xi Meng and Ou Chen discussing about a new drama investment, having Ling Hao and An Hui Ni as the main leads. Ou Chen, however, has one condition. Of course, we know that it’s to cast Xia Mo.\n\nAnd so the news is out. The management company confirms that they’ll be considering Xia Mo for the supporting female role in the upcoming idol drama. Zhen En is overly excited since Xia Mo has a 70-80% chance.\n\nConference Time: Needless to say, Xia Mo did get the part. And we are about to be introduced to two new characters: Ling Hao and An Hui Ni.\n\nXia Mo is still feeling awkward and out-of-place as the media took their pictures. One reporter suggests that Xia Mo smile for the camera.\n\nAn Hui Ni: Don’t request too much coz she’s only a singer, not an actress.\n\nBut Xia Mo, as we know, is not your typical damsel in distress. She talks back: “You’re wrong. Bing Long doesn’t even have a voice. She doesn’t even dare to say one word. Especially when Lu Si is with Cai Na. Bing Long only wishes to be transparent”. Of course, this is a blunt insult to An Hui Ni. Meaning: Xia Mo is already acting her part in the drama as Bing Long. Meaning: She already read the whole script. Meaning: We’ll be seeing lot of catfights next episode.\n\nBang! Hits her bullseye! Round one? Victory for Xia Mo.\n\nAt home, Luo Xi serenely plays the piano. His assistant hands in a yellow envelop. What’s with the yellow envelops people?\n\nShe reminds him of the Ou Company’s “Battle Flag” offer. But he stood his grounds and won’t reconsider taking the project. Just then, Xi Meng drops by and convinces Luo Xi himself.\n\nLuo Xi: You actually came here. Do you really want to hear me refuse Hua Sheng Co. in person that badly."
