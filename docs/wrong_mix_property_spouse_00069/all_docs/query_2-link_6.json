        "text": "21 Jul â€“ Hong Kong pop duo Twins, which consists of Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung, attended a promotional event to celebrate their 10th anniversary on Tuesday, following reports from Xin MSN website.\n\nLast week, Charlene Choi's ex-husband Ronald Cheng welcomed a baby girl. When asked for a comment, Charlene generously gave the family her blessings.\n\nFor the group's 10th anniversary, the management company of Twins, Emperor Entertainment Group specially hired two fashion designers to create a limited edition commemorative clothing line and accessories.\n\nCharlene and Gillian said that inspirations of the clothing line came from their previous costumes. The duo even played a part in which colours to use.\n\n\"We'll also be releasing watches, mobile phone covers and recyclable bags,\" Gillian added.\n\nWhen Charlene mentioned the possibility of designing her own baby clothing line, the media asked if she would present them as a gift to Ronald.\n\n\"I'm still in the midst of planning [the clothing line]. We'll see when it's released. Currently, I wouldn't give any to him. Perhaps I will, when there are less people probing me about it,\" Charlene said.\n\nDid she have any plans of having a baby then?\n\n\"Many of my friends are having babies. I've been listening to a lot of their baby talk. I have to maintain my health first [before I become pregnant],\" Charlene answered."
