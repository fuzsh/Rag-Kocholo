        "text": "Viter Fan uploads Intimate photos with Cyndi Wong\n\nWe get that you’re not gay, but you need to shave. It’s too hairy.\n\nAnd isn’t Cyndi your ex-girlfriend? The whole relationship ended five years ago and the jilted Viter just won’t let go. Being so desperate for attention may be why she dumped you in the first place.\n\nGo Cyndi for the cute fobby peace sign.\n\nTang Wei\n\nTang Wei’s career launched amidst controversy. She won the 2007 Golden Lion Award for her performance in Director Ang Lee’s artistic Lust, Caution. Tang Wei portrayed Wong Chia Chi, a communist hero who spied on the Japanese army during the 1930s Sino-Japanese war. But critics gave mixed reviews to her character because the supposedly communist hero demonstrated subtle sympothy for her traitor lover (Tong Leung Chiu-Wai.) Even more provocative were her nude scenes with Tony, which can only be deemed pornographic by the conservative Chinese standard. Even in the U.S, the movie Lust, Caution received an NC-17 rating.\n\nSince Lust, Caution, Tang Wei has been intentionally banned from many Chinese media outlets because she had fallen out of grace with the communist regime. Many companies dropped her from their celebrity endorsement commercials. But after two years of missing out, Tang brings audiences Crossing Hennessy, a romantic drama with Jacky Cheung. It will be her first movie shown in China since Lust, Caution.\n\nJackie Chan\n\nBorn Chan Kong Sang, Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan is a legend. His influence ranges from Saturday morning cartoons (Jackie Chan Adventures) to cheesy Mainland celebrity endorsement commercials. Active since the 70s, Jackie has appeared in over 100 films. His most recent flick, The Spy Next Door received mixed reviews from U.S audiences. On Rotten Tomatoes, his film holds a 12% rating. Despite the negative critical reception, his film raked in 30 million dollars in gross revenue.\n\nFrom Dating to Divorced\n\nIn Hong Kong, many tabloids are shocked with the recent split between Charlene Choi and singer Ronald Cheng. Even more shocking, the press revealed that Choi and Cheng were actually married in Los Angeles, United States in 2006. They are now in the process of a divorce.\n\nThe two angels of the girl group Twins, Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung, have both fallen. Gillian shocked us with her 2008 photo scandal, and now Charlene with her divorce. This leads one to question whether future product endorsements will come easy to these girls. Getting married and doing dirty deeds with another pop star while upholding a pretense of innocence has rocked the faith of their fans.\n\nFengJie\n\nAre you single and looking for an exotic Chinese bride? Fengjie is the answer. This 25 year-old egomaniac is seeking an eligible bachelor by handing out flyers in busy streets in Shanghai. She has become an internet sensation due to her notoriously high standards in seeking a partner. According to rough calculations, only 6 people in China satisfy her criteria.\n\nHer flyers read:\n\n1) Must have a Peking University or TsingHua University master’s degree. (These two schools are the Harvard and Yale of China.)\n\n2) Must have an economics degree.\n\n3) Must have an international outlook, but does not seek to live abroad or emigrate from China.\n\n4) Must be around 6 feet tall. The cuter the better.\n\n5) No marriage history. Including abortions.\n\n6) To live in the east coast of China and only in the major cities.\n\n7) Age: 25-28\n\nDee Hsu Denies Alleged Abuses by Husband\n\nDee Hsu, host of Chung T’ien Television’s TV program KangXi Lai Le, has denied allegations of suffering beatings from husband Mike Xu. The pair married in 2005 and they have two daughters Elly and Lilly. Dee’s co-host Kevin Tsai and older sister Barbie Hsu have also spoken out against the allegations. Barbie Hsu claims that anyone who truly knows her sister will want to treat her with respect.\n\nChenLing’s Body Laid to Rest\n\nAfter leaping off a friend’s apartment building in Beijing, Singer ChenLing was laid to rest on April 1st 2010. The singer was plagued with depression after a tumultuous divorce with her former music producer husband Sheng YongGe and a failed second marriage.\n\nMay she rest in peace. Here’s a link to her award winning song Ai Jiu Ai Le.\n\nhttp://www.tudou.com/programs/view/9tEbHjt1PpI/\n\nBarbie Hsu Beats the Crap Out of Richie Jen\n\nIn her new TV show, Long Feng Dian, Barbie Hsu punishes Richie Ren with whips and hot candles. We never thought feudalist China could be so kinky.\n\nRichie Ren is most famous for the 1996 song Soft Heart. His most recent box office hit was the 2004 film Elixir of Love. Barbie Hsu, sister of Dee Hsu, is most noted for her performance in the classic Meteor Garden. Her recent movie, Hot Summer Days (2010), where she sports a bob cut has landed her on many billboards throughout Mainland China.\n\nAda Choi is Preggers\n\nAda Choi married her mainland boyfriend Zhang Jing for two years, and now she’s 2 months pregnant with her first child. She showed off her curves during the premiere of her movie Once Upon a Chinese Classic.\n\nThe 37 year old is on the right track to complete her dream of having a family with 4 kids.\n\nWe love you Ada and all your TVB dramas!"
