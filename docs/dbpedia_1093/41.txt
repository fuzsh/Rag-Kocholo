470 helm Onan Barreiros who competed with Aaron Sarmiento at the 2012 Olympic Games has teamed up with a new crew Juan Curbelo. From Gran Canaria in Spain, twenty-one year old Curbelo is new to the Olympic campaign trail. The new partnership have been training virtually day and night to prepare for their first major event, Andalusian Olympic Week in Cadiz, Spain where racing gets underway later this week. This is all part of their preparation and build up to the 470 World Championships from 5-10 August 2013. Ahead of the 470 Worlds, the pair will compete at the next two ISAF Sailing World Cup events in Palma and Hyeres.

However, their ultimate goal is the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.

Commenting on the new partnership, Barreiros said, "My new crew is highly motivated. I could not train after the Games because I had to have an operation, but I saw him work very hard. This gives me strength and the itch to be back at a high level." Barreiros explained that the important thing is communication and harmony in the boat.

Barreiros finished 11th in 2012, and was just 1 point short of making it through to the top 10 Medal Race. He was closer to the medals at the 2008 Olympic Games, where he finished 5th.

And did you know? .... Barreiros won the 2003 420 World Championships.
