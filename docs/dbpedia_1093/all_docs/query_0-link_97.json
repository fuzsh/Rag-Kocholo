        "text": "The final day at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao was filled with tension as the Medal Races decided the podium places, Rio 2016 Olympic qualification spots and Abu Dhabi World Cup Final positions.\n\nAlongside this, sailors in the top three in each fleet receive a share of the 150,000 Euro prize fund.\n\nLight wind and strong current has been a regularity throughout the week with those reading the conditions to full effect reaping the rewards. A 5-7 south eastern breeze made for a tense finale with sailors aiming to leave nothing on the water.\n\nChinese sailors dominated the day taking gold in the Men’s 470, Finn, Laser Radial and the Men’s and Women’s RS:X. Meanwhile, Singapore’s Justin Liu and Denise Lim in the Nacra 17, Laser sailor Lorenzo Chiavarini (GBR) and Japan’s Women’s 470 team took the spoils in their fleets.\n\nNacra 17\n\nSingapore’s Justin Liu and Denise Lim stylishly wrapped up gold in the Nacra 17 with a Medal Race victory. It was their tenth race win of the week and with gold, they have qualified Singapore for a Rio 2016 Nacra 17 spot.\n\nThe pair revelled in Qingdao’s light air and with conditions in the Medal Race similar to the days prior, the odds were in their favour. Liu and Lim worked their way through the fleet during the Medal Race and finished 51 seconds clear of Japan’s Hiroki Goto and Wakako Tabata.\n\nThroughout the week the Singaporeans remained coy about their chances, not taking anything for granted. When they crossed the finish there was visible sense of a relief that was quickly overtaken by joy as they let the celebrations commence.\n\n“It’s amazing,” said Liu through a beaming smile. “There were so many challenges to make it here and to try and qualify the country. To be able to do it is amazing. It’ll be our first Olympics so there is so much to look forward to.”\n\nLim added, “We sailed the conditions quite well, and with our coaches help, he helped us a lot with the current and the wind changes and I think that gave us an advantage over the rest.”\n\nWhilst the Singaporeans can look forward, the teams from China, Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand were understandably disappointed. A world cup silver and bronze for Zijin Wen and Rubei Yuan (CHN) and Tat Choi Fung and Yu Ting Chan (HKG) were mere consolation with Olympic dreams filling their head in advance of the competition.\n\nJapan’s Goto and Tabata had beaten their main rivals in several key regattas building up to Qingdao but the big breeze that they excel in failed to kick in in Qingdao as they finished fifth overall.\n\nNonetheless, Goto remained complimentary to the Singaporeans and has an eye on the future, “I have to take my hat off to the Singapore team. It was light wind and they totally dominated. They sailed the wind so well.\n\n“My aim was to inspire the next generation of Nacra sailors, and the next Olympic Sailing [Competition] will be in my home town of Enoshima. I will be there, hopefully as a coach because I have young people asking me to help them, so this is good. I’m not happy now but we have to look to the future for everyone.”\n\nThe Olympic Games aims to inspire generation after generation and with key inspirations such as Hiroki Goto driving the sport and multihull sailing forward, watch out for a high flying Japanese Nacra 17 team at Tokyo 2020.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nMeanwhile in the Women’s 470 there was cause for Japanese merriment as the team snapped up gold and silver respectively.\n\nAi Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN) held onto their overnight lead whilst a second in the Medal Race promoted Akiyo Yamaguchi and Eri Hatayama (JPN) into silver medal position.\n\nAs Yamaguchi and Hatayama crossed the finished line there were smiles stretched across their faces with high fives aplenty. Kondo Yoshida and Yoshioka followed behind them in third and revelled in their compatriots’ celebrations with grins creeping in before they finished.\n\nIt was a tense race in the light breeze for all the competitors and the points were close going into the race. Xiaoli Wang and Lizhu Huang (CHN) were breathing down the Kondo Yoshida and Yoshioka’s necks but the Japanese experience shone through as they remained calm as Kondo Yoshida explained, “Today there was a two point lead for us against the Chinese team who were our closest rivals. We got the win and we are very very happy.”\n\nShasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) completed the Women’s 470 podium.\n\nIt was a three way shoot out in the Men’s 470 between the Austrian, Chinese and Spanish teams. Four points separated them going into the Medal Race and it was China’s Hao Lan and Chao Wang who prevailed.\n\nLan and Wang finished second in the Medal Race compared to overnight leader David Bargehr and David Mahr’s fourth (AUT) and Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera’s (ESP) third. As a result the Austrians were made to settle for silver, one point behind the Chinese with the Spaniards rounding off the podium.\n\n“There is a little bit of a mixture between happy and disappointed,” explained Bargehr. “But overall the happy feeling is superior because we won a medal here and it’s always good to win a medal.\n\n“We knew that points were very close with not much separation so we knew we had to sail a really good Medal Race to win this event.\n\n“After the race you are always more clever than before, but it was a really tight Medal Race and it could have gone either way. And always you need a little bit of luck in a Medal Race.”\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nThe advantage going into the Laser Medal Race belonged to Great Britain’s Lorenzo Chiavarini as he owned a 17 point lead. He delivered the goods with a sixth place finish to complete a comfortable victory.\n\n“I was a bit nervous coming into the day,” explained the British sailor, “but once I got out on the water everything started calming down.\n\n“The race track was shorter so the gains were less today. Tiredness was also another point of the day but for me it was important to keep Tonci [Stipanovic] around me and not let him go too far.”\n\nCroatia’s Stipanovic needed the to go massively in his favour if he was to overthrow Chiavarini. The British sailor controlled him and kept the Croatian behind him throughout the race with Stipanovic finishing second overall.\n\nThe Medal Race victory went the way of Pavlos Kontides (CYP) who moved up into the bronze medal position.\n\nChinese Laser Radial sailor Dongshuang Zhang loves sailing in Qingdao. She took her third consecutive victory at the event with another professional performance.\n\nZhang finished second in the Medal Race which confirmed her as gold medallist after the second placed Isabella Bertold (CAN) finished eighth overall.\n\nDespite finishing 17 points clear of her rivals, taking another World Cup gold medal, 12,000 Euros in prize money and booking a spot at the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final Zhang was less than impressed with her performance as she explained, “The race went very well, better than yesterday. I’m not very satisfied with the regatta, I made a lot of small mistakes which I will work on little by little.”\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nIt was double gold for China in the Men’s and Women’s RS:X with Chunzuang Liu and Jiahui Wu clinching gold in their respected fleets.\n\nWu led the Women’s RS:X fleet from the first day but heading into the Medal Race Peina Chen (CHN) was firmly in contention, just six points off the leader. Chen finished one place ahead of Wu in the Medal Race but it wasn’t enough to topple her as Wu sealed gold.\n\n“There was little wind and a lot of pumping,” explained Wu after racing, “but I am very happy with the win. It was a great competition for me and the less wind suited my style.”\n\nPei Ling Chen (CHN) took the Medal Race victory to pick up bronze.\n\nExperienced Spanish racer Blanca Manchon finished in eighth but was upbeat after racing with lots of lessons learnt from Qingdao’s challenging current, “I had two OCS this week, I was risking a lot because I came here for training so it was good for me to try a little risk on the starts, but with the currents it was hard to be on the line and sometimes I just made a mistake. If I didn’t have that second OCS I would have finished third so I am happy.\n\n“This place is totally different to Spain. It’s funny. It’s a different culture and wind so it was good. There was not much wind but it was great for my training.”\n\nNot much separated the Men’s RS:X fleet throughout the Medal Race with tensions high but Liu managed to put himself in a good position. A second place confirmed his gold medal and upon crossing the finish line he let out a triumphant, “woohoo.”\n\nOnce ashore Liu said, “I performed really well, better than normal. Over the regatta there has been good and bad, but overall it has been good and I have learned a lot. We have made great progress as a nation in windsurfing with tough exercises.”\n\nBing Ye (CHN) and Zhichao Zang (CHN) complete the podium.\n\nFinn\n\nChina’s Lei Gong overthrew Luwen Shen in the Finn to snap up a hard earned gold medal.\n\nGong and Shen battled hard throughout the week with very little separating them on the race track. The advantage belonged to Shen going into the Medal Race as he led Gong by five points.\n\nHowever it was Gong’s experience that shone through in the Medal Race as he took a convincing bullet with Shen sailing through in fourth. One point was the difference at the end of the day.\n\nFor China’s Finn team it was a job well done throughout the week as they booked the nation a spot at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.\n\nAttention now turns to the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final that is scheduled to take place from 27 October to 1 November 2015 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe best placed Asian and International sailors from ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao have booked their spot on the start line with the remaining sailors to be invited based on the ISAF World Sailing Rankings that will be released on 21 September.\n\nThere was joy and heartache in equal measure at the special Olympic qualifier staged in Gestut Peterhof in Perl, Germany yesterday where Japan pipped South Africa by the narrowest of margins for a coveted team slot at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.\n\nIn a competition that swung in favour of both sides at various stages, it seemed the result could go either way. But in the end Team Japan came out on top by just 0.06 percentage points to clinch it. There was some compensation for the disappointed South Africans when Tanya Seymour, who produced a lovely test to finish fourth in the competition with Ramoneur, earned her country one of the two individual qualifying spots on offer, the other going to Korea when Dongseon Kim finished eighth with Bukowski.\n\nA total of 34 athletes from 17 nations lined out in the 2* Grand Prix competition staged within the framework of the CDI4* Dressage Gala at the charming German venue, and 21 were chasing the Olympic qualifying slots. There were only two countries in contention for the single team berth – Japan and South Africa – while competitors from Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Korea, Morocco, Palestine, Philippines, Singapore and Chinese Taipei also battled it out for the individual qualifying places. This special qualification event was open to competitors from FEI Olympic Groups F and G and to the FEI Olympic Group C countries Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nGood start\n\nKazuki Sado got the Japanese effort off to a good start when posting 65.180 with the 11-year-old gelding Ziroco, and when Akane Kuroki scored 66.280 with Don Luka and Shingo Hayashi earned 65.640 with Ramses der II they already had the edge.\n\nThe South Africans however were chasing them hard, a big score of 68.880 from Tanya Seymour and Ramoneur seriously boosting her side’s chances when added to Denise Hallion’s 63.220 with Wervelwind, and Katherine Berning’s 63.180 with Brisbane. With three riders gone for each team, the leaderboard showed Japan out in front on a total of 197.1 but the South Africans were less than two points adrift on 195.82.\n\nThere was huge pressure on the last competitor from each side, and a great 68.420 from the final South African partnership of Nicole Smith and her 17-year-old mare, Victoria, really put it up to Japanese anchorman Masanao Takahashi.\n\nThe 33-year-old has only been partnering the experienced Fabriano for a few months now, the 16-year-old stallion previously competing at two European Championships, the London 2012 Olympic Games and the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games™ 2014 in Normandy, France with Austria’s Renate Voglsang on board. Takahashi, who was a team bronze medallist at the Asian Games in Doha, Qatar in 2006, produced progressively good results with the horse at Wiesbaden, Capelin and Verden this summer however, and yesterday their 68.600 was good enough to fill sixth place in the competition and to swing the pendulum of good fortune in his country’s direction by the tiniest of margins.\n\nSurprised but happy\n\nJapanese Chef d’Equipe, Shinichi Terui, said afterwards, “I was surprised today but very happy we are going to Rio! The South Africans were very strong, and their last rider was particularly good, so in the end I think we are lucky!” However he commended his team for their great result. “All four riders did a very good job today. They were under a lot of pressure, and I’m really happy with how they coped with that” he pointed out.\n\nSouth African Chef d’Equipe, Jenny Neill, said, “it was so tight with the marks, but I’m very pleased with our performance, our team has come so far and I am excited by how well they did today and very happy that we have qualified one individual for Rio. Hopefully we might also get another individual qualified as well. But while I’m very excited I’m also very disappointed – in the end however, it is what it is!” she added.\n\nShe said she wasn’t surprised that Tanya Seymour had produced such a strong result to finish fourth in the class that was, predictably, dominated by German riders – Uta Graf taking top spot with Lawrence followed by Stella Roth in second with Rubin Action while Hendrik Lochthowe finished third with Maggie’s US Latin.\n\n“Tanya can do a 69 or 70 (percent score) and Nicole (Smith) also. Our riders are all based across Europe but Tanya was born in South Africa, then her parents moved to Australia before coming to Germany. She and the other riders all come back frequently to South Africa to support our sport with clinics and training” she explained. And in true sporting fashion, Jenny Neill concluded “we wish the Japanese all the best, they have lovely horses and good riders”.\n\nFacts and Figures:\n\nToday’s special qualification event was open to competitors from FEI Olympic Groups F and G and to the FEI Olympic Group C countries Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\n2 nations were represented by teams : Japan and South Africa.\n\n21 competitors from 11 nations competed for the Olympic qualifying spots.\n\nJapan claimed the single team qualification spot, pipping South Africa by a narrow margin of just 0.6 percent.\n\n2 individual qualifying spots were earned for their country’s by South Africa’s Tanya Seymour who finished fourth with Ramoneur and Korea’s Dongseon Kim who finished eighth with Bukowski.\n\nThe full list of teams now qualified for Dressage at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games is: Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and USA.\n\nCanada and Mexico have also earned individual qualifying slots.\n\nThe stakes at ISAF Sailing World Cup Qingdao, taking place from 14-20 September 2015, will be raised with Rio 2016 Olympic Sailing Competition places on the line.\n\nAs the Asian continental qualification regatta for the Men’s and Women’s 470, Finn and Nacra 17 the competition in Qingdao is set to be fierce with a depth of international sailing talent within the respective fleets. Alongside Olympic qualification, more than 240 sailors from 37 nations will be gunning for a share of the $150,000 USD prize fund, ISAF Sailing World Cup Final spots as well as a World Cup medal.\n\nQingdao will be the final chance for Asian Nacra 17 sailors to qualify for Rio 2016 after 13 spots were distributed at the 2014 ISAF Worlds and 2015 Nacra 17 Worlds. The 470 and Finn sailors will have another opportunity later on in the year at their respective World Championships.\n\nThe last time an Asian crew, who weren’t representing the host nation, sailed in an Olympic multihull competition was Seoul 1988 as Naoyuki Ogawa and Takashi Tamura flew the Japanese flag on their Tornado. Fast forward to 2015 and crews from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Thailand have an opportunity to qualify for an Olympic Games outright and on merit.\n\nJapan’s Hiroki Goto and Wakako Tabata arguably come into the regatta as the pair to beat. Goto and Tabata finished ahead of Justin Liu and Denise Lim (SIN) by two spots at the 2015 Nacra 17 Worlds and five clear of Hong Kong’s Tat Choi Fund and Yu Ting Chan.\n\nGoto has hopes of qualifying for Rio but his intention and drive is to inspire the youth of the country to sail multihulls ahead of Tokyo 2020, a home Olympic Games.\n\n“There is almost no multihull sailing in Japan whatsoever,” commented Goto. “We have a home [Olympic] Games in Tokyo and we need someone there. It would be ideal to get someone in the Games before. I wanted someone to start but no one came forward so I went for it.\n\n“The change to the qualification is good. It would be so tough otherwise for example Africa and Asia to qualify for the Olympics.\n\n“I really hope that I can encourage the younger generation to take up multihull. I am 42 and I want to show if I can do it, they can definitely do it.”\n\nGoto’s hopes could turn into reality in Qingdao but the Singaporean and Hong Kong teams will provide a real challenge whilst a contingent of four Chinese teams will benefit from knowing their home waters.\n\nWhoever takes that spot will also book their ticket to the Abu Dhabi ISAF Sailing World Cup Final making it a double whammy from Qingdao.\n\nThe Men’s 470 will be one of the most hotly contested battles with eight nations, China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand all battling for one Olympic spot.\n\nSingapore’s Darren Choy, who will be sailing with Jeremiah Yeo, has had a feel of what the Olympics is like after competing at the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games and is aiming for the real deal. “The Youth Olympic Games made me want to experience the Olympic Games and feel the true spirit in the games because it is the highest prestige in the sport and to compete for Singapore would be an honour,” said Choy.\n\nHe continued, “The event is a really important one for us. It is our only ticket now to the 2016 Rio Olympics, as well as the opportunity to show that we are worth sponsoring and funding. I would love to qualify as this would give me a taste on what the Games are like and to experience it would be a dream for me.”\n\nCompared to those around them, Choy and Yeo are two of the youngest sailors in the fleet and miss out on some big time experience that their rivals hold and Choy was quick to identify his main rivals for Qingdao when asked, “It would definitely have to be the top Chinese and Korean teams as they have been on the Olympic circuit for many years, thus have a lot of experience. We’ve been working on some speed technique and race preparation in Singapore and I’m aiming to be the top Asian nation, and to qualify Singapore for the Rio Olympics.”\n\nChina will be represented by 13 Men’s 470 teams in Qingdao and with a strong presence on the start line, could be viewed as the favourites to take the Olympic spot. However, in a fleet of 32 that also features top 470 sailors such as David Bargehr and Lukas Mahr (AUT) and Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP), anything can happen.\n\nIn the Women’s 470, the fight will be between Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. The strong teams from China and Japan qualified at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds making it a three horse race for qualification.\n\nAs for the battle to Abu Dhabi, defending champions Mengxi Wei and Yani Xu (CHN) return to defend their title but will face stiff competition from Angela Pumariega and Patricia Cantero Reina (ESP) and Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (JPN).\n\nIn the Finn fleet, eight boats will take to the start line and include seven Chinese sailors and one Iranian. The odds will be heavily stacked towards the Chinese sailors with regards to the one Olympic spot on offer and the Abu Dhabi World Cup final spot but Iran’s Ahmad Ahmadi will fight hard across the week.\n\nRacing across the nine Olympic fleets is scheduled to commence on 16 September with Medal Races bringing the regatta to a close on 20 September.\n\nThe World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) today revealed the Super Round schedule for the XXVII WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup 2015, which opened last Friday (28 August), in Osaka, Japan.\n\nFollowing an exciting five-day group stage, half of the twelve National Teams competing in the U-18 international flagship event have been eliminated, while world No. 1 Japan and world No. 8 South Korea have emerged as winners of their respective groups.\n\nGroup A\n\nW L Group B W L\n\n1.
