        "text": "Meaning of Onan\n\nThe name Onan is a male name of Hebrew origin, pronounced as OH-nuhn (/oʊˈnʌn/). It has biblical roots, famously associated with a minor figure in the Book of Genesis. Despite its historical significance, the name remains relatively rare in modern times. In the United States, it has seen very limited use over the years, with only a few occurrences recorded sporadically across decades. Most recently, it ranked 8,230th in popularity in 2023 with just nine newborns given this name. The rarity of Onan makes it a unique choice for parents seeking a distinctive and historically rich name for their baby boy.\n\nPronunciation\n\nEnglish"
