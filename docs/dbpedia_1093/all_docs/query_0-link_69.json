Conclusion Protocols for\n\nComparison of current recommended regimens of atropinization in organophosphate poisoning.\n\nPubMed\n\nConnors, Nicholas J; Harnett, Zachary H; Hoffman, Robert S\n\n2014-06-01\n\nAtropine is the mainstay of therapy in organophosphate (OP) toxicity, though research and consensus on dosing is lacking. In 2004, as reported by Eddleston et al. (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 42(6):865-75, 2004), they noted variation in recommended regimens. We assessed revisions of original references, additional citations, and electronic sources to determine the current variability in atropine dosing recommendations. Updated editions of references from Eddleston et al.'s work, texts of Internal and Emergency Medicine, and electronic resources were reviewed for atropine dosing recommendations. For comparison, recommendations were assessed using the same mean dose (23.4Â mg) and the highest dose (75Â mg) of atropine as used in the original paper. Recommendations were also compared with the dosing regimen from the World Health Organization (WHO). Thirteen of the original recommendations were updated and 15 additional references were added giving a convenience sample of 28. Sufficient information to calculate time to targeted dose was provided by 24 of these samples. Compared to 2004, current recommendations have greatly increased the speed of atropinization with 13/24 able to reach the mean and high atropine dose within 30Â min compared to 1/36 in 2004. In 2004, there were 13 regimens where the maximum time to reach 75Â mg was over 18Â h, whereas now, there are 2. While only one recommendation called for doubling the dose for faster escalation in 2004, 15 of the 24 current works include dose doubling. In 2004, Eddleston et al. called for an evidence-based guideline for the treatment of OP poisoning that could be disseminated worldwide. Many current recommendations can adequately treat patients within 1Â h. While the WHO recommendations remain slow to treat patients with OP poisoning, other authorities are close to a consensus on rapid atropinization.\n\nThe 2009 schizophrenia PORT psychosocial treatment recommendations and summary statements.\n\nPubMed\n\nDixon, Lisa B; Dickerson, Faith; Bellack, Alan S; Bennett, Melanie; Dickinson, Dwight; Goldberg, Richard W; Lehman, Anthony; Tenhula, Wendy N; Calmes, Christine; Pasillas, Rebecca M; Peer, Jason; Kreyenbuhl, Julie\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) psychosocial treatment recommendations provide a comprehensive summary of current evidence-based psychosocial treatment interventions for persons with schizophrenia. There have been 2 previous sets of psychosocial treatment recommendations (Lehman AF, Steinwachs DM. Translating research into practice: the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) treatment recommendations. Schizophr Bull. 1998;24:1-10 and Lehman AF, Kreyenbuhl J, Buchanan RW, et al. The Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT): updated treatment recommendations 2003. Schizophr Bull. 2004;30:193-217). This article reports the third set of PORT recommendations that includes updated reviews in 7 areas as well as adding 5 new areas of review. Members of the psychosocial Evidence Review Group conducted reviews of the literature in each intervention area and drafted the recommendation or summary statement with supporting discussion. A Psychosocial Advisory Committee was consulted in all aspects of the review, and an expert panel commented on draft recommendations and summary statements. Our review process produced 8 treatment recommendations in the following areas: assertive community treatment, supported employment, cognitive behavioral therapy, family-based services, token economy, skills training, psychosocial interventions for alcohol and substance use disorders, and psychosocial interventions for weight management. Reviews of treatments focused on medication adherence, cognitive remediation, psychosocial treatments for recent onset schizophrenia, and peer support and peer-delivered services indicated that none of these treatment areas yet have enough evidence to merit a treatment recommendation, though each is an emerging area of interest. This update of PORT psychosocial treatment recommendations underscores both the expansion of knowledge regarding psychosocial treatments for persons with schizophrenia at the same time as\n\nTreatment recommendations for DSM-5-defined mixed features.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosenblat, Joshua D; McIntyre, Roger S\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) mixed features specifier provides a less restrictive definition of mixed mood states, compared to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), including mood episodes that manifest with subthreshold symptoms of the opposite mood state. A limited number of studies have assessed the efficacy of treatments specifically for DSM-5-defined mixed features in mood disorders. As such, there is currently an inadequate amount of data to appropriately inform evidence-based treatment guidelines of DSM-5 defined mixed features. However, given the high prevalence and morbidity of mixed features, treatment recommendations based on the currently available evidence along with expert opinion may be of benefit. This article serves to provide these interim treatment recommendations while humbly acknowledging the limited amount of evidence currently available. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) appear to have the greatest promise in the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) with mixed features. Conventional mood stabilizing agents (ie, lithium and divalproex) may also be of benefit; however, they have been inadequately studied. In the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with mixed features, the comparable efficacy of antidepressants versus other treatments, such as SGAs, remains unknown. As such, antidepressants remain first-line treatment of MDD with or without mixed features; however, there are significant safety concerns associated with antidepressant monotherapy when mixed features are present, which merits increased monitoring. Lurasidone is the only SGA monotherapy that has been shown to be efficacious specifically in the treatment of MDD with mixed features. Further research is needed to accurately determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatments specifically for mood episodes with mixed features to adequately inform\n\nManagement of newborn infant born to mother suffering from tuberculosis: current recommendations & gaps in knowledge.\n\nPubMed\n\nMittal, Hema; Das, Saurabhi; Faridi, M M A\n\n2014-07-01\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a global disease with increase in concern with growing morbidity and mortality after drug resistance and co-infection with HIV. Mother to neonatal transmission of disease is well known. Current recommendations regarding management of newborns of mothers with tuberculosis are variable in different countries and have large gaps in the knowledge and practices. We compare and summarize here current recommendations on management of infants born to mothers with tuberculosis. Congenital tuberculosis is diagnosed by Cantwell criteria and treatment includes three or four anti-tubercular drug regimen. Prophylaxis with isoniazid (3-6 months) is recommended in neonates born to mother with TB who are infectious. Breastfeeding should be continued in these neonates and isolation is recommended only till mother is infectious, has multidrug resistant tuberculosis or non adherent to treatment. BCG vaccine is recommended at birth or after completion of prophylaxis (3-6 months) in all neonates.\n\nCurrent treatment recommendations and considerations for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nKonÃ©-Paut, Isabelle; Galeotti, Caroline\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) encompasses a spectrum of three phenotypes of increasing severity. The syndrome is due to dominant mutations in NLRP3, which encodes a key component of the innate immunity that regulates the secretion of IL-1Î². CAPS manifests as systemic inflammation, which compromises quality of life and leads to serious complications and handicap. Anti-IL-1 drugs have shown remarkable efficacy in treating CAPS symptoms and have significantly changed patients' lives. They have acceptable safety profiles but do have some differences. We review three drugs that are currently marketed for CAPS, give additional information for the practical use of these drugs, and provide some recommendations for management.\n\n[Update on anaphylactic shock treatment recommendations: what's new in the use of epinephrine?].\n\nPubMed\n\nBÃ³zzola, CÃ©sar MartÃ­n; Saranz, Ricardo J; Lozano, Alejandro; CÃ¡ceres, MarÃ­a Elena; Sarraquigne, Paula; MariÃ±o, Andrea Irene; Boudet, RaÃºl Vicente; BandÃ­n, Gloria; Skrie, VÃ­ctor\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn 1998, the Sociedad Argentina de PediatrÃ­a issued the recommendation of the treatment of anaphylactic shock. While this recommendation suggested the use of subcutaneous epinephrine, currently the intramuscular via is considered the most appropriate one. Pharmacological aspects determine this preference. For outpatient treatment, the correct use of autoinjectors can control anaphylaxis quickly and effectively. The use of other medications in the proposed 1998 recommendation remains unchanged.\n\nConsensus Recommendations for Current Treatments and Accelerating Clinical Trials for Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 2\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBlakeley, Jaishri O; Evans, D. Gareth; Adler, John; Brackmann, Derald; Chen, Ruihong; Ferner, Rosalie E.; Hanemann, C. Oliver; Harris, Gordon; Huson, Susan M.; Jacob, Abraham; Kalamarides, Michel; Karajannis, Matthias A.; Korf, Bruce R.; Mautner, Victor-Felix; McClatchey, Andrea I.; Miao, Harry; Plotkin, Scott R.; Slattery, William; Stemmer-Rachamimov, Anat O.; Welling, D. Bradley; Wen, Patrick Y.; Widemann, Brigitte; Hunter-Schaedle, Kim; Giovannini, Marco\n\n2011-01-01\n\nNeurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor suppressor syndrome characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) which often result in deafness despite aggressive management. Meningiomas, ependymomas and other cranial nerve and peripheral schwannomas are also commonly found in NF2 and collectively lead to major neurologic morbidity and mortality. Traditionally, the overall survival rate in patients with NF2 is estimated to be 38% at 20 years from diagnosis. Hence, there is a desperate need for new, effective therapies. Recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of NF2 related tumors has aided in the identification of potential therapeutic targets and emerging clinical therapies. In June 2010, representatives of the international NF2 research and clinical community convened under the leadership of Drs. D. Gareth Evans (University of Manchester) and Marco Giovannini (House Research Institute) to review the state of NF2 treatment and clinical trials. This manuscript summarizes the expert opinions about current treatments for NF2 associated tumors and recommendations for advancing therapies emerging from that meeting. The development of effective therapies for NF2 associated tumors has the potential for significant clinical advancement not only for patients with NF2 but for thousands of neuro-oncology patients afflicted with these tumors.

This recommendation was established before intensive insulin therapy and based on studies using insulin with different pharmacokinetic profiles from actual insulin analogs showing that 15Â g of glucose increases blood glucose byÂ ~Â 1.5Â mmol/L in 15Â min. We aimed to explore the effect of current recommended treatment of mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes (T1D) participants and factors associated with treatment effectiveness. This is a secondary analysis from three observational inpatient studies with a standardized and supervised treatment (16Â g carbohydrates) of hypoglycemia (<Â 3.3Â mmol/L with symptoms orÂ <Â 3.0Â mmol/L without symptom) in participants (47 adults-10 adolescents) with T1D using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (\"insulin pumps\"; CSII)). Twenty-seven participants presented a total of 48 hypoglycemia episodes treated by a single intake of 16Â g of carbohydrates. Time required for normoglycemia recovery was 19.5Â Â±Â 12.0Â min. The rise in plasma glucose following treatment was 0.85Â Â±Â 0.66Â mmol/L in 15Â min. Eighteen episodes (38%) were resolved (>Â 4.0Â mmol/L) 15-min post-treatment. Glycemia at the time of treatment (<Â 3.2Â mmol/L; pÂ <Â 0.001) and a higher proportion of total daily insulin from basal doses (pÂ =Â 0.03) were associated with a slower post-treatment plasma glucose rise. These results raise the possibility that sixteen grams of carbohydrates could be insufficient to treat a large proportion of hypoglycemia episodes in T1D patients treated with CSII. Factors affecting treatment effectiveness need to be investigated.\n\nRecommendations for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, using various therapy techniques, based on categorizations of a literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nThomas, Anthony; Eichenberger, Gary; Kempton, Curtis; Pape, Darin; York, Sarah; Decker, Ann Marie; Kohia, Mohamed\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis literature review is to evaluate current research articles pertinent to physical therapy treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Osteoarthritis of the knee is an increasingly common diagnosis, with a prognosis that can lead to loss in an individual's functional abilities. Literature on the subject of OA and its physical therapy treatment is vast and current, however, obtaining and analyzing it can be time consuming and costly to a Physical Therapist. The primary aim of this paper is to review current trends for treatment of OA of the knee, and to compare each intervention for effectiveness. This article provides a systematic categorization as well as recommendations for physical therapists based on current (1996 or sooner) literature. Twenty-two articles were located using various online databases, critically analyzed, and categorized using Sackett's levels of evidence. Recommendations for the treatment of OA of the knee by a physical therapist were then made. Two grade A recommendations, 5 grade B recommendation, and 2 grade C recommendations were made from the categorization of the articles. This article also contains recommendations outside the scope of a therapist's practice, which a physical therapist could consider when treating a patient with knee osteoarthritis. Further research recommendations are also provided.\n\nDo patients discussed at a lung cancer multidisciplinary team meeting receive guideline-recommended treatment?\n\nPubMed\n\nBoxer, Miriam M; Duggan, Kirsten J; Descallar, Joseph; Vinod, Shalini K\n\n2016-03-01\n\nClinical guidelines provide evidence-based management recommendations to guide practice. This study aimed to evaluate whether patients discussed at a lung cancer multidisciplinary team meeting received guideline-recommended treatment and determine reasons for not receiving guideline-recommended treatment. All new lung cancer patients discussed at the Liverpool/Macarthur lung cancer multidisciplinary team meeting between 1 December 2005 and 31 December 2010 were included. Guideline-recommended treatment was assigned according to pathology, stage and ECOG (Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group) performance status as per the 2004 Australian Lung Cancer Guidelines. This was compared with actual treatment received to determine adherence to guidelines. For those patients who did not receive guideline-recommended treatment, the medical record was reviewed to determine the reason(s) for this. Survival was compared between those who did and did not receive guideline-recommended treatment. 808 new patients were discussed at the multidisciplinary team meeting. Guideline-recommended treatment could not be assigned in 2% of patients due to missing data. 435 patients (54%) received guideline-recommended treatment, and 356 (44%) did not. The most common reasons for not receiving guideline-recommended treatment were a decline in ECOG performance status (24%), large tumor volume precluding radical radiotherapy (17%), comorbidities (15%) and patient preference (13%). Patients less than 70 years who received guideline-recommended treatment had improved survival compared with those who did not. A significant proportion of lung cancer patients did not receive guideline-recommended treatment due to legitimate reasons. Alternative guidelines are needed for patients not suitable for current best practice. Treatment according to guidelines was a predictor for survival.

Registration of new antiretroviral drugs, modification of clinical praxis, updated general treatment guidelines and increasing knowledge about MTCT have necessitated regular revisions of the recommendations for 'Prophylaxis and treatment of HIV-1 infection in pregnancy'. The Swedish Reference Group for Antiviral Therapy (RAV) has updated the recommendations from 2013 at an expert meeting 19 September 2017. In the new text, current treatment guidelines for non-pregnant are considered. The most important revisions are that: (1) Caesarean section and infant prophylaxis with three drugs are recommended when maternal HIV RNA >150 copies/mL (previously >50 copies/mL). The treatment target of undetectable HIV RNA remains unchanged <50 copies/mL; (2) Obstetric management and mode of delivery at premature rupture of the membranes and rupture of the membranes at full term follow the same procedures as in HIV negative women; (3) Vaginal delivery is recommended to a well-treated woman with HIV RNA <150 copies/mL regardless of gestational age, if no obstetric contraindications are present; (4) Treatment during pregnancy should begin as soon as possible and should continue after delivery; (5) Ongoing well-functioning HIV treatment at pregnancy start should usually be retained; (6) Recommended drugs and drug combinations have been updated.\n\nVariation in Treatment Recommendations for Dupuytren Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcMillan, Catherine; Yeung, Celine; Binhammer, Paul\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTo examine agreement on Dupuytren disease (DD) treatment recommendations in an international sample of hand surgeons. A survey was developed to determine expertise in needle aponeurotomy, surgery, and collagenase injection to treat DD and to examine treatment recommendations for 16 case scenarios. Case scenarios were predeveloped using expert input. Each case represented a unique combination of 4 dichotomous variables including cord thickness, contracture severity, patient age, and joint involvement. Interrater reliability statistics were calculated and multinomial logistic regression modeling and analysis of variance were used to examine the impact of surgeon- and case-related variables on treatment recommendations. A total of 36 hand surgeons from 9 countries (mean experience, 17 years) participated. Average pairwise percent agreement and Krippendorff's alpha were 26% and .012, respectively. Predictors of a recommendation for surgery over multiple options were a total contracture of greater than 70Â°, a thick precentral cord, involvement of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, and greater years in practice. A greater number of years in practice predicted recommendation for collagenase injection and the presence of a thick precentral cord predicted a recommendation for needle aponeurotomy. Little agreement exists on treatment recommendations for common presentations of DD in this sample. Further investigation into the sources of potential widespread discrepancies in the management of DD may improve the capacity to make evidence-based recommendations.

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has recently defined DRE as that in which the seizures are not controlled after having correctly taken two appropriate and well tolerated anti-epileptic drugs, with lack of control being understood as the appearance of seizures within one year or in a period less than three times the inter-seizure interval before starting treatment. This International Society recommends a rapid and detailed assessment of all patients in an Epilepsy Unit. A Clinical Epilepsy Unit (CEU) is understood as a group of professionals who, acting in collaboration, have the diagnosis and treatment of the patient with epilepsy as their primary objective. CEUs in Spain may be stratified into different levels depending on the activity carried out in each of them. The specific epilepsy clinic is considered the fundamental type of CEU and includes the necessary figure of an expert in epilepsy. Prolonged video-monitoring is performed in medical CEUs. In medical-surgical CEUs epilepsy surgery with varying degrees of difficulty is also performed. All CEUs must cooperate with consensus protocols, and there must be a two-way flow between them. Stratification of CEUs increases efficacy and efficiency, due to there being a sufficient number of them to ensure easy access by all patients with epilepsy.

The CMSWG convened to review how disease activity is assessed, propose a more current approach for assessing suboptimal response, and to suggest a scheme for switching or escalating treatment. Practical criteria for relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression and MRI were developed to classify the clinical level of concern as Low, Medium and High. The group concluded that a change in treatment may be considered in any RRMS patient if there is a high level of concern in any one domain (relapses, progression or MRI), a medium level of concern in any two domains, or a low level of concern in all three domains. These recommendations for assessing treatment response should assist clinicians in making more rational choices in their management of relapsing MS patients.\n\nExtravasation injuries: current medical and surgical treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoornaert, M; Monstrey, S; Roche, N\n\n2013-01-01\n\nExtravasation is a devastating complication of intravenous therapy that develops when a drug infiltrates the interstitial tissue surrounding the vein. Due to the uncertain and possibly dramatic outcome, early recognition and adequate treatment with the aid of a standardized protocol are needed. A pubmed literature search was conducted and all relevant articles were reviewed for the development of an extravasation treatment protocol. An overview of current treatment guidelines and clinical experience is provided. The extravasation treatment protocol was implied during 1 year in this university hospital with satisfactory outcome. Treatment starts with prevention. In case of an established extravasation injury, early recognition, assessment of severity, and treatment with medical and/or surgical therapies are recommended.\n\nCurrent and future treatment options for polycythemia vera.\n\nPubMed\n\nGriesshammer, Martin; Gisslinger, Heinz; Mesa, Ruben\n\n2015-06-01\n\nPatients with polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an elevated red blood cell mass, are at high risk of vascular and thrombotic complications and have reduced quality of life due to a substantial symptom burden that includes pruritus, fatigue, constitutional symptoms, microvascular disturbances, and bleeding. Conventional therapeutic options aim at reducing vascular and thrombotic risk, with low-dose aspirin and phlebotomy as first-line recommendations for patients at low risk of thrombotic events and cytoreductive therapy (usually hydroxyurea or interferon alpha) recommended for high-risk patients. However, long-term effective and well-tolerated treatments are still lacking. The discovery of mutations in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) as the underlying molecular basis of PV has led to the development of several targeted therapies, including JAK inhibitors, and results from the first phase 3 clinical trial with a JAK inhibitor in PV are now available. Here, we review the current treatment landscape in PV, as well as therapies currently in development.\n\nMicroRNA based Pan-Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendation.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheerla, Nikhil; Gevaert, Olivier\n\n2017-01-13\n\nThe current state-of-the-art in cancer diagnosis and treatment is not ideal; diagnostic tests are accurate but invasive, and treatments are \"one-size fits-all\" instead of being personalized. Recently, miRNA's have garnered significant attention as cancer biomarkers, owing to their ease of access (circulating miRNA in the blood) and stability. There have been many studies showing the effectiveness of miRNA data in diagnosing specific cancer types, but few studies explore the role of miRNA in predicting treatment outcome. Here we go a step further, using tissue miRNA and clinical data across 21 cancers from the 'The Cancer Genome Atlas' (TCGA) database. We use machine learning techniques to create an accurate pan-cancer diagnosis system, and a prediction model for treatment outcomes. Finally, using these models, we create a web-based tool that diagnoses cancer and recommends the best treatment options. We achieved 97.2% accuracy for classification using a support vector machine classifier with radial basis. The accuracies improved to 99.9-100% when climbing up the embryonic tree and classifying cancers at different stages. We define the accuracy as the ratio of the total number of instances correctly classified to the total instances. The classifier also performed well, achieving greater than 80% sensitivity for many cancer types on independent validation datasets. Many miRNAs selected by our feature selection algorithm had strong previous associations to various cancers and tumor progression. Then, using miRNA, clinical and treatment data and encoding it in a machine-learning readable format, we built a prognosis predictor model to predict the outcome of treatment with 85% accuracy. We used this model to create a tool that recommends personalized treatment regimens. Both the diagnosis and prognosis model, incorporating semi-supervised learning techniques to improve their accuracies with repeated use, were uploaded online for easy access. Our research is a step\n\nA Decision Fusion Framework for Treatment Recommendation Systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nMei, Jing; Liu, Haifeng; Li, Xiang; Xie, Guotong; Yu, Yiqin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTreatment recommendation is a nontrivial task--it requires not only domain knowledge from evidence-based medicine, but also data insights from descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analysis. A single treatment recommendation system is usually trained or modeled with a limited (size or quality) source. This paper proposes a decision fusion framework, combining both knowledge-driven and data-driven decision engines for treatment recommendation. End users (e.g. using the clinician workstation or mobile apps) could have a comprehensive view of various engines' opinions, as well as the final decision after fusion. For implementation, we leverage several well-known fusion algorithms, such as decision templates and meta classifiers (of logistic and SVM, etc.). Using an outcome-driven evaluation metric, we compare the fusion engine with base engines, and our experimental results show that decision fusion is a promising way towards a more valuable treatment recommendation.\n\nChallenges of implementing fibromyalgia treatment guidelines in current clinical practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nArnold, Lesley M; Clauw, Daniel J\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe current diagnostic and treatment pathway for patients with fibromyalgia (FM) is lengthy, complex, and characterized by multiple physician visits with an average 2-year wait until diagnosis. It is clear that effective identification and appropriate treatment of FM remain a challenge in current clinical practice. Ideally, FM management involves a multidisciplinary approach with the preferable patient pathway originating in primary care but supported by a range of health care providers, including referral to specialist care when necessary. After the publication of individual clinical studies, high-quality reviews, and meta-analyses, recently published FM treatment guidelines have transitioned from an expert consensus to an evidence-based approach. Evidence-based guidelines provide a framework for ensuring early diagnosis and timely adoption of appropriate treatment. However, for successful outcomes, FM treatments must adopt a more holistic approach, which addresses more than just pain. Impact on the associated symptoms of fatigue and cognitive problems, sleep and mood disturbances, and lowered functional status are also important in judging the success of FM therapy. Recently published guidelines recommend the adoption of a symptom-based approach to guide pharmacologic treatment. Emerging treatment options for FM may be best differentiated on the basis of their effect on comorbid symptoms that are often associated with pain (e.g. sleep disturbance, mood, fatigue). The current review discusses the most recently published Canadian guidelines and the implications of the recent European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations, with a focus on the challenges of implementing these guidelines in current clinical practice.\n\nSingle dose treatment of malaria - current status and perspectives.\n\nPubMed\n\nMischlinger, Johannes; Agnandji, Selidji T; Ramharter, Michael\n\n2016-07-01\n\nDespite increased international efforts for control and ultimate elimination, malaria remains a major health problem. Currently, artemisinin-based combination therapies are the treatment of choice for uncomplicated malaria exhibiting high efficacy in clinical trial settings in sub-Saharan Africa. However, their administration over a three-day period is associated with important problems of treatment adherence resulting in markedly reduced effectiveness of currently recommended antimalarials under real world settings. Antimalarial drug candidates and antimalarial drug combinations currently under advanced clinical development for the indication as single dose antimalarial therapy. Expert commentary: Several new drug candidates and combinations are currently undergoing pivotal proof-of-concept studies or clinical development programmes. The development of a single dose combination therapy would constitute a breakthrough in the control of malaria. Such an innovative treatment approach would simultaneously close the effectiveness gap of current three-day therapies and revolutionize population based interventions in the context of malaria elimination campaigns.\n\nEvaluation of the validity of treatment decisions based on surrogate country models before introduction of the Polish FRAX and recommendations in comparison to current practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nGlinkowski, Wojciech M; Narloch, Jerzy; Glinkowska, BoÅ¼ena; Bandura, MaÅgorzata\n\n2018-03-01\n\nPatients diagnosed before the Polish FRAX was introduced may require re-evaluation and treatment changes if the diagnosis was established according to a surrogate country FRAX score. The aim of the study was to evaluate the validity of treatment decisions based on the surrogate country model before introduction of the Polish FRAX and to provide recommendations based on the current practice. We evaluated a group of 142 postmenopausal women (70.7 Â±8.9 years) who underwent bone mineral density measurements. We used 22 country-specific FRAX models and compared these to the Polish model. The mean risk values for hip and major osteoporotic fractures within 10 years were 4.575 (from 0.82 to 8.46) and 12.47% (from 2.18 to 21.65), respectively. In the case of a major fracture, 94.4% of women would receive lifestyle advice, and 5.6% would receive treatment according to the Polish FRAX using the guidelines of the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF). Polish treatment thresholds would implement pharmacotherapy in 32.4% of the study group. In the case of hip fractures, 45% of women according to the NOF would require pharmacotherapy but only 9.8% of women would qualify according to Polish guidelines. Nearly all surrogate FRAX calculator scores proved significantly different form Polish ( p > 0.05). More patients might have received antiresorptive medication before the Polish FRAX. This study recommends re-evaluation of patients who received medical therapy before the Polish FRAX was introduced and a review of the recommendations, considering the side effects of antiresorptive medication.\n\nTreatment of HIV infection: Swedish recommendations 2009.\n\nPubMed\n\nJosephson, Filip; Albert, Jan; Flamholc, Leo; GisslÃ©n, Magnus; KarlstrÃ¶m, Olof; Moberg, Lars; NavÃ©r, Lars; Svedhem, Veronica; Svennerholm, Bo; SÃ¶nnerborg, Anders\n\n2009-01-01\n\nOn 4 previous occasions, in 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2007, the Swedish Medical Products Agency (LÃ¤kemedelsverket) and the Swedish Reference Group for Antiviral Therapy (RAV) have jointly published recommendations for the treatment of HIV infection. In November 2008, an expert group under the guidance of RAV once more revised the guidelines, of which this is a translation into English. The most important updates in the present guidelines include the following: (a) treatment initiation is now recommended at a CD4 cell count of approximately 350/microl; (b) new recommendations for first-line therapy: abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine in combination with efavirenz or a boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r); (c) an increased focus on reducing the use of antiretroviral drugs that may cause lipoatrophy; (d) an emphasis on quality assurance of HIV care through the use of InfCare HIV; (e) considerably altered recommendations for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy in children. All infants (<1 y) should start antiretroviral therapy, regardless of immune status. Also, absolute CD4+ cell counts, rather than percentage, may be used to guide treatment initiation in children above the age of 5 y.\n\nCommercial Motor Vehicle Driver Obstructive Sleep Apnea Screening and Treatment in the United States: An Update and Recommendation Overview\n\nPubMed Central\n\nColvin, Loretta J.; Collop, Nancy A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nNo regulatory mandate exists in the United States (U.S.) for comprehensive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) risk assessment and stratification for commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers. Current Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requirements are outdated and depend largely on subjective report, a less reliable strategy in an occupational setting. Without FMCSA standards, sleep specialists, occupational medical examiners and employers rely on a collection of medical consensus recommendations to establish standards of care. These recommendations advise OSA risk assessment through a combination of focused medical history, physical examination, questionnaires, and accident history, which increase OSA detection compared to current FMCSA standards. For those diagnosed with OSA, consensus-based risk stratification helps identify CMV drivers who may benefit from OSA treatment and establish minimum standards for assessing treatment efficacy and adherence. Unfortunately no consolidated recommendation exists; rather, publications span medical and governmental literature in a patchwork fashion that no longer fully reflect current practice due to subsequent advances in OSA diagnosis, treatment, and technology. Based on searches of medical literature, internet materials, and reference lists from existing publications, an overview and discussion of key published recommendations regarding OSA assessment and treatment in CMV operators is provided. Suggestions for incorporating these recommendations into clinical sleep medicine practice in the U.S. are presented. The challenge for sleep specialists is maintaining the delicate balance between recommendations impacting standard of care and associated medico-legal impact with stakeholder interests from medical, regulatory, industry and public perspectives while providing high quality and efficient care.

Current evidence indicates that there is no single ideal treatment for fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). First choice treatment options remain debatable, especially concerning the importance of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments. Methods. Three evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines on FMS in Canada, Germany, and Israel were compared for their first choice and CAM-recommendations. Results. All three guidelines emphasized a patient-tailored approach according to the key symptoms. Aerobic exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and multicomponent therapy were first choice treatments. The guidelines differed in the grade of recommendation for drug treatment. Anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin) and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine, milnacipran) were strongly recommended by the Canadian and the Israeli guidelines. These drugs received only a weak recommendation by the German guideline. In consideration of CAM-treatments, acupuncture, hypnosis/guided imagery, and Tai Chi were recommended by the German and Israeli guidelines. The Canadian guidelines did not recommend any CAM therapy. Discussion. Recent evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines concur on the importance of treatment tailored to the individual patient and further emphasize the need of self-management strategies (exercise, and psychological techniques).\n\n[Recommendations for initial antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected children. Update 2003].\n\nPubMed\n\n2004-03-01\n\nHighly active antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children has been associated with a dramatic decrease in progression to AIDS and HIV-related deaths, and infected children currently have an excellent quality of life. Antiretroviral drugs cannot eradicate the virus, although they can achieve a situation of latent infection. However, chronic use of these drugs has multiple adverse effects, the most important of which are metabolic complications. The large number of drugs required and patient characteristics such as age, tolerance to drugs, adherence, and social problems make unifying the criteria for initial therapy in HIV-infected children difficult. A balance should be sought between not delaying the start of treatment, to avoid immunologic deterioration, and minimizing the long-term adverse effects of the therapy. The present treatment recommendations are adapted from international guidelines and are based on a literature review and on our own experience. Our group previously published recommendations on the treatment of HIV-infected children and the aim of the present article is to provide an update.\n\nVitamin D in adolescents: Are current recommendations enough?\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, Taryn J; Lanham-New, Susan A; Hart, Kathryn H\n\n2017-10-01\n\nVitamin D is essential for bone development during adolescence and low vitamin D status during this critical period of growth may impact bone mineralization, potentially reducing peak bone mass and consequently increasing the risk of osteoporosis in adulthood. Therefore, the high prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy and deficiency in adolescent populations is of great concern. However, there is currently a lack of consensus on the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, the widely accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, that defines adequacy, and the vitamin D intake requirements to maintain various 25(OH)D thresholds are not well established. While the current intake recommendations of 10-15Î¼g/day may be sufficient to prevent vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D<25-30nmol/l), greater intakes may be needed to achieve the higher threshold levels proposed to represent adequacy (25(OH)D>50nmol/l). This review will address these concerns and consider if the current dietary recommendations for vitamin D in adolescents are sufficient. Crown Copyright Â© 2017. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the coming years, it will likely be the most common indication for liver transplantation and the most frequent cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is based on dietary and exercise interventions that have been shown to be efficacious, even for reverting fibrosis. Unfortunately, compliance with general measures involving lifestyle modifications is very poor, making pharmacologic strategies a necessary option. At present, there are no treatments for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease approved by regulatory agencies, and the only ones with sufficient evidence and recommended by international societies are treatments with pioglitazone and vitamin E, which are not exempt from adverse effects. We review herein the current management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including dietary and physical activity interventions, available treatments, equivocal therapies, emerging treatments, and treatments presently in clinical trials.

Apart from fresh, immature scars,that transform into mature scars over the course of would healing and that do not require further treatment,linear hypertrophic scars, widespread hypertrophic scars, keloids and atrophic scars exist. Symptoms like pruritusand pain, stigmatization as well as functional and aesthetic impairments that are very disturbing for the affected patients can bethe basis for the desire for treatment. Today, a multitude of options for the treatment and prevention of scars exists. Topical agents based on silicone or onion extract, intralesional injections of cristalline glucocorticoids (oftentimes in combinationwith cryotherapy) or 5-Fluorouracil as well as ablative and nonablative laser treatment are used. Current guidelines summarize the multitude of available treatment options and the currently available datafor the treating physicians, allowing them to make clear therapy recommendations for every single scar type. Relieving patients of their discomfort and doing their aesthetic demands justice is thus possible. Apart from scar prevention becoming more and more important, the increased use of modernlaser treatment options constitutes a key point in clinical scar treatment. At the same time the attention is turned to evaluating current therapeutic options with the help of contemporary study designs so as to graduallyimprove the level of evidence in scar treatment.

In February 2016, an expert group under the guidance of RAV once more revised the guidelines. The most important updates in the present guidelines are as follows: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has recently been registered. TAF has several advantages over tenofovir disoproxilfumarate (TDF) and is recommended instead of TDF in most cases. First-line treatment for previously untreated individuals includes dolutegravir, boosted darunavir or efavirenz with either abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir (TDF/TAF)/emtricitabine. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for high-risk individuals. As in the case of the previous publication, recommendations are evidence-graded in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine ( http://www.cebm.net/oxford-centre-evidence-based-medicine-levels-evidence-march-2009/ ) ( Table 1 ).

Survey questionnaire. We conducted a survey of members of the American Otological Society and the American Neurotology Society to learn their current practices in the treatment of Bell's palsy. Eighty-six neurotologists responded out of 334 surveys (26%). The majority of respondents obtain magnetic resonance imaging and electrical testing for new patients and treat with a combination of steroids and antiviral agents. More than two thirds of respondents would recommend surgery to patients who met the established electrophysiologic criteria (electroneuronography <10% normal, no spontaneous motor unit action potentials on electromyography within 10 days of onset of complete paralysis). However, only half believe that surgical decompression should be the standard of care, and only half would use a standard middle fossa approach. Lack of evidence was the most commonly cited reason for not recommending surgery. Several respondents wrote that they would leave the option of surgery to the patient. Most important, one third of neurotologists have not performed a surgical decompression for Bell's palsy in the last 10 years, and 95% perform less than one procedure per year. Disagreement persists among practicing otologists about the role of surgical decompression for Bell's palsy. More convincing clinical evidence will be needed before there is widespread consensus regarding the surgical treatment of this condition.

Clinical features of mixed states and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria are presented and critical discussed. We then performed a systematic review using the terms 'bipolar', 'mixed' and 'randomized' to evaluate current treatment options. For pharmacological treatment of mixed states in total, there is still insufficient data from RCTs. However, there is some evidence for efficacy in mixed states from RCTs for atypical antipsychotics, especially olanzapine, aripiprazole and asenapine as well as mood stabilizers as valproate and carbamazepine. Mixed states are of a high clinical relevance and the DSM-5 criteria substantially reduced the diagnostic threshold. Besides advantages of a better characterization of patients with former DSM-IV-defined mixed episodes, disadvantages arise for example differential diagnoses with a substantial overlap in symptoms such as borderline personality disorders. Atypical antipsychotics, valproate and carbamazepine demonstrated efficacy in a limited sample of RCTs. The number of RCTs in the treatment of mixed states is highly limited. Furthermore, nearly all studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies which may lead to an underestimation of classical mood stabilizers such as lithium.\n\nMatrix- and tensor-based recommender systems for the discovery of currently unknown inorganic compounds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSeko, Atsuto; Hayashi, Hiroyuki; Kashima, Hisashi; Tanaka, Isao\n\n2018-01-01\n\nChemically relevant compositions (CRCs) and atomic arrangements of inorganic compounds have been collected as inorganic crystal structure databases. Machine learning is a unique approach to search for currently unknown CRCs from vast candidates. Herein we propose matrix- and tensor-based recommender system approaches to predict currently unknown CRCs from database entries of CRCs. Firstly, the performance of the recommender system approaches to discover currently unknown CRCs is examined. A Tucker decomposition recommender system shows the best discovery rate of CRCs as the majority of the top 100 recommended ternary and quaternary compositions correspond to CRCs. Secondly, systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to investigate the phase stability of the recommended compositions. The phase stability of the 27 compositions reveals that 23 currently unknown compounds are newly found to be stable. These results indicate that the recommender system has great potential to accelerate the discovery of new compounds.\n\n[Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment of Fractures of the Ring of Axis].\n\nPubMed\n\nScholz, Matti; Schleicher, Philipp; Kandziora, Frank; Badke, Andreas; Dreimann, Marc; Gebhard, Harry; Gercek, Erol; Gonschorek, Oliver; Hartensuer, RenÃ©; Jarvers, Jan-Sven Gilbert; Katscher, Sebastian; Kobbe, Philipp; Koepp, Holger; Korge, Andreas; Matschke, Stefan; MÃ¶rk, Sven; MÃ¼ller, Christian W; Osterhoff, Georg; PÃ©csi, Ferenc; Pishnamaz, Miguel; Reinhold, Maximilian; Schmeiser, Gregor; Schnake, Klaus John; Schneider, Kristian; Spiegl, Ulrich Josef Albert; Ullrich, Bernhard\n\n2018-06-22\n\nIn a consensus process with four sessions in 2017, the working group \"upper cervical spine\" of the German Society for Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery (DGOU) formulated \"Therapeutic Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Upper Cervical Fractures\", taking their own experience and the current literature into consideration. The following article describes the recommendations for axis ring fractures (traumatic spondylolysis C2). About 19 to 49% of all cervical spine injuries include the axis vertebra. Traumatic spondylolysis of C2 may include potential discoligamentous instability C2/3. The primary aim of the diagnostic process is to detect the injury and to determine potential disco-ligamentous instability C2/3. For classification purposes, the Josten classification or the modified Effendi classification may be used. The Canadian C-spine rule is recommended for clinical screening for C-spine injuries. CT is the preferred imaging modality and an MRI is needed to determine the integrity of the discoligamentous complex C2/3. Conservative treatment is appropriate in case of stable fractures with intact C2/3 motion segment (Josten type 2 and 2). Patients should be closely monitored, in order to detect secondary dislocation as early as possible. Surgical treatment is recommended in cases of primary severe fracture dislocation or discoligamentous instability C2/3 (Josten 3 and 4) and/or secondary fracture dislocation. Anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) C2/3 is the treatment of choice. However, in case of facet joint luxation C2/3 with looked facet (Josten 4), a primary posterior approach may be necessary.

However, there are no consistent guidelines regarding the dosing and administration of NBUVB in vitiligo, reflected by varied treatment practices around the world. To create phototherapy recommendations to facilitate clinical management and identify areas requiring future research. The Vitiligo Working Group (VWG) Phototherapy Committee addressed 19 questions regarding the administration of phototherapy over 3 conference calls. Members of the Photomedicine Society and a group of phototherapy experts were surveyed regarding their phototherapy practices. Based on comparison and analysis of survey results, expert opinion, and discussion held during conference calls, expert recommendations for the administration of NBUVB phototherapy in vitiligo were created. There were several areas that required further research before final recommendations could be made. In addition, no standardized methodology was used during literature review and to assess the strength of evidence during the development of these recommendations. This set of expert recommendations by the VWG is based on the prescribing practices of phototherapy experts from around the world to create a unified, broadly applicable set of recommendations on the use of NBUVB in vitiligo.

We performed a review of the evidence in the prehospital treatment of patients with a seizure, and then compared the seizure protocols of each of the 33 EMS agencies for consistency with these recommendations.Â We analyzed the type and route of medication administered, number of additional rescue doses permitted, and requirements for glucose testing prior to medication. The treatment for eclampsia and seizures in pediatric patients were analyzed separately. Protocols across EMS Agencies in California varied widely.Â We identified multiple drugs, dosages, routes of administration, re-dosing instructions, and requirement for blood glucose testing prior to medication delivery. Blood glucose testing prior to benzodiazepine administration is required by 61% (20/33) of agencies for adult patients and 76% (25/33) for pediatric patients. All agencies have protocols for giving intramuscular benzodiazepines and 76% (25/33) have protocols for intranasal benzodiazepines. Intramuscular midazolam dosages ranged from 2 to 10 mg per single adult dose, 2 to 8 mg per single pediatric dose, and 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg as a weight-based dose. Intranasal midazolam dosages ranged from 2 to 10 mg per single adult or pediatric dose, and 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg as a weight-based dose. Intravenous/intrasosseous midazolam dosages ranged from 1 to 6 mg per single adult dose, 1 to 5 mg per single pediatric dose, and 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg as a weight-based dose. Eclampsia is specifically addressed by 85%Â (28/33) of agencies. Forty-two percent (14/33) have a protocol for administering magnesium sulfate, with intravenous dosages ranging from 2 to 6 mg, and 58% (19/33) allow benzodiazepines to be administered.

WHO WPR Gonococcal Antimicrobial Resistance Programme members provided data on the type, dose and source of third-generation cephalosporins recommended for the treatment of gonorrhoea. Ceftriaxone was recommended more widely (11/15 respondents) than cefixime (five centres). No cephalosporins were recommended in three jurisdictions. One other oral (ceftibuten) and injectable (cefodizime) agent was recommended. Uniform (400 mg) doses of cefixime were recommended but ceftriaxone regimens ranged between 125 mg and 1 g, with nine of 11 respondents using a 250 mg dose. Both generic and proprietary preparations were widely used. Third-generation cephalosporins are widely recommended for the treatment of gonorrhoea in the WPR, with injectable ceftriaxone more extensively so than oral cefixime and in an expanded dose range. Few other cephalosporins were recommended. Current knowledge suggests that the trend towards ceftriaxone treatment in higher doses may decrease the impact of the circulation of \"cephalosporin-resistant\" gonococci in the WPR. These recommendations represent public sector practice only and of themselves are unlikely to contain the further spread of \"cephalosporin-resistant\" gonococci because of the general clinical use of cephalosporins. Optimisation of strategies for laboratory detection of third-generation cephalosporin resistance can be simplified in the WPR because of the restricted spectrum of cephalosporins recommended. Additional efforts are urgently required for both disease and antibiotic resistance control in gonorrhoea.\n\nThe Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT): updated treatment recommendations 2009.\n\nPubMed\n\nKreyenbuhl, Julie; Buchanan, Robert W; Dickerson, Faith B; Dixon, Lisa B\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) project has played a significant role in the development and dissemination of evidence-based practices for schizophrenia. In contrast to other clinical guidelines, the Schizophrenia PORT Treatment Recommendations, initially published in 1998 and first revised in 2003, are based primarily on empirical data. Over the last 5 years, research on psychopharmacologic and psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia has continued to evolve, warranting an update of the PORT recommendations. In consultation with expert advisors, 2 Evidence Review Groups (ERGs) identified 41 treatment areas for review and conducted electronic literature searches to identify all clinical studies published since the last PORT literature review. The ERGs also reviewed studies preceding 2002 in areas not covered by previous PORT reviews, including smoking cessation, substance abuse, and weight loss. The ERGs reviewed over 600 studies and synthesized the research evidence, producing recommendations for those treatments for which the evidence was sufficiently strong to merit recommendation status. For those treatments lacking empirical support, the ERGs produced parallel summary statements. An Expert Panel consisting of 39 schizophrenia researchers, clinicians, and consumers attended a conference in November 2008 in which consensus was reached on the state of the evidence for each of the treatment areas reviewed. The methods and outcomes of the update process are presented here and resulted in recommendations for 16 psychopharmacologic and 8 psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia. Another 13 psychopharmacologic and 4 psychosocial treatments had insufficient evidence to support a recommendation, representing significant unmet needs in important treatment domains.\n\nPrimary Care Physicians' Struggle with Current Adult Pneumococcal Vaccine Recommendations.\n\nPubMed\n\nHurley, Laura P; Allison, Mandy A; Pilishvili, Tamara; O'Leary, Sean T; Crane, Lori A; Brtnikova, Michaela; Beaty, Brenda L; Lindley, Megan C; Bridges, Carolyn B; Kempe, Allison\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for at-risk adults â¥19; in 2014, it expanded this recommendation to adults â¥65. Primary care physicians' practice, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding these recommendations are unknown. Primary care physicians throughout the U.S. were surveyed by E-mail and post from December 2015 to January 2016. Response rate was 66% (617 of 935). Over 95% of respondents reported routinely assessing adults' vaccination status and recommending both vaccines. A majority found the current recommendations to be clear (50% \"very clear,\" 38% \"somewhat clear\"). Twenty percent found the upfront cost of purchasing PCV13, lack of insurance coverage, inadequate reimbursement, and difficulty determining vaccination history to be \"major barriers\" to giving these vaccines. Knowledge of recommendations varied, with 83% identifying the PCV13 recommendation for adults â¥65 and only 21% identifying the recommended interval between PCV13 and PPSV23 in an individual <65 at increased risk. Almost all surveyed physicians reported recommending both pneumococcal vaccines, but a disconnect seems to exist between perceived clarity and knowledge of the recommendations. Optimal implementation of these recommendations will require addressing knowledge gaps and reported barriers.

In this article, we introduce a systematic collective investigation of how recommendations for medications are responded to and made in primary versus secondary care, in the US versus the UK, and in contexts where the medication was over the counter versus by prescription. This article provides an overview of the coding system that was used in this project including describing what constitutes a recommendation, the primary action types clinicians use for recommendations, and the types of responses provided by patients to recommendations.\n\nOptimal Corrosion Control Treatment Evaluation Technical Recommendations\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThis document provides technical recommendations that both systems and primacy agencies can use to comply with LCR CCT requirements and effective evaluation and designation of optimal corrosion control treatment (OCCT).\n\nAntibacterial treatment of bacterial vaginosis: current and emerging therapies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMenard, Jean-Pierre\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBacterial vaginosis is a common cause of malodorous vaginal discharge. It is also associated with sexually transmitted infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The magnitude of the gynecological and obstetrical consequences has stimulated therapeutic research and led to the testing of several therapies. The objective of this work is to present the currently available therapeutic strategies for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and associated recommendations, and discuss the emerging therapies.

A cross-sectional study of 1,708 HDRs was carried out. We determined the presence or absence of the various items required by current legislation and by the recommendations of the above-mentioned consensus. A total of 97.4% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 96.5-98.2) of the HDRs were classified as satisfactory according to the stipulations of current legislation. However, when the assessment was based on the consensus, the rate of adequacy fell to 72.1% (95% CI: 70.0-74.3). A notable finding was the absence of the duration of treatment after hospital discharge in 39.4% of the HDRs. HDRs show an excellent level of compliance with the data required by current regulations, but their intrinsic quality needs to be improved. Copyright Â© 2012 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana.

All cases occur in untreated or inadequately vaccinated patients and mainly in elderly patients who accumulate many risk factors. The current management of wounds faced difficulties in the assessment of immunization status and wound risks status. Indeed, all injuries can potentially lead to tetanus. Minor risks and chronic wounds are mainly found as tetanus cause. Vaccination remains the key element in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with tetanus. It is estimated that the vaccine's coverage is fairly good, but decreases with age. To improve tetanus prevention, new vaccine recommendations have been established which recommend vaccine's injections at fixed age, but their impact seems to be limited especially in the elderly. The immunochromatographic tests have demonstrated cost-effectiveness in the Emergency department settings. They are currently not available outside hospital while general practionners also face a significant risk. Effectiveness of these tests should be studied in outpatients population including cost-effectiveness.\n\n[Comments on current guidelines of type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment].\n\nPubMed\n\nMartinka, Emil\n\nIn an effort to facilitate the widest possible application of recent findings in diabetology and the related medical fields, with regard to characteristics of medicines and current possibilities of using modern procedures, but also to their limitations due to the financial capacities of health insurance companies, SDS innovates its therapeutic recommendations for the treatment of diabetes mellitus on a regular basis. The most recent recommendations were issued by SDS in August 2016. The review discusses and describes several factors which the authors considered during their preparation: (1) Compliance with the findings of evidence-based medicine, compliance with reference recommendations (therapeutic recommendations ADA/EASD), compliance with summary characteristics of active substances in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and approved possibilities of their use, and compliance with indica-tive restrictions (IO) which define medical and economic conditions for health insurance covered treatment. (2) Certain departure from the \"glucocentric\" approach to therapy, in favour of the approach preferring the selection of drugs based on clinical characteristics of the patient and proven benefits/risks of individual drugs (3) Preference of groups as well as individual active substances within groups based on evidence medicine regarding the individual active substances for specific patient groups. (4) Emphasis on individualization of goals for glycemic control (5) Emphasis on the right classification of diabetes mellitus as the basic condition for the selection of an optimum thera-peutic procedure, and (6) Emphasis on education and overcoming of clinical inertia, and patient medication adherence and medication \"literacy\" as the basic condition for successful therapy. The discussion also considers the outcomes of the most recent studies including of the studies focusing on empagliflozin and liraglutide, as well as recent modifications of the therapeutic recommendations of\n\nCurrent developments in the treatment of early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nBorchmann, Sven; von Tresckow, Bastian; Engert, Andreas\n\n2016-09-01\n\nAfter presenting the current treatment recommendations for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, we give an overview on recently published clinical trials in this setting. Furthermore, the potential influence of current trials on the treatment of early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma and integration of newly emerging drugs into treatment protocols will be discussed. Trials attempting treatment de-escalation and omission of radiotherapy on the basis of early interim PET-scans have been disappointing so far, but results of some large trials employing this strategy are still awaited. In contrast, a more defensive strategy of starting treatment with less aggressive doxorubicine, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy and intensifying treatment in early interim PET-positive patients has shown encouraging results. New drugs such as brentuximab vedotin and immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising results in relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. Clinical trials of brentuximab vedotin in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma have been initiated. Additionally, biomarker-based treatment de-escalation might be a possible route for future improvements. The challenge for future clinical research in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma is to continue to cure the majority of patients with first-line treatment while reducing long-term toxicity. New strategies to achieve that goal are currently being developed and will further refine treatment of early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nAdherence to CDC Recommendations for the Treatment of Uncomplicated Gonorrhea - STD Surveillance Network, United States, 2016.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeston, Emily J; Workowski, Kimberly; Torrone, Elizabeth; Weinstock, Hillard; Stenger, Mark R\n\n2018-04-27\n\nGonorrhea, the sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, is the second most common notifiable disease in the United States after chlamydia; 468,514 cases were reported to state and local health departments in 2016, an increase of 18.5% from 2015 (1). N. gonorrhoeae has progressively developed resistance to most antimicrobials used to treat the infection (2). As a result, CDC recommends two antimicrobials (250 mg of ceftriaxone [IM] plus 1 g of azithromycin [PO]) for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea to improve treatment efficacy and, potentially, to slow the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. To monitor adherence to the current CDC-recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonorrhea, CDC reviewed enhanced data collected on a random sample of reported cases of gonorrhea in seven jurisdictions participating in the STD Surveillance Network (SSuN) and estimated the proportion of patients who received the CDC-recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonorrhea, by patient characteristics and diagnosing facility type. In 2016, the majority of reported patients with gonorrhea (81%) received the recommended regimen. There were no differences in the proportion of patients receiving the recommended regimen by age or race/ethnicity; however, patients diagnosed with gonorrhea in STD (91%) or family planning/reproductive health (94%) clinics were more likely to receive this regimen than were patients diagnosed in other provider settings (80%). These data document high provider adherence to CDC gonorrhea treatment recommendations in specialty STD clinics, indicating high quality of care provided in those settings. Local and state health departments should monitor adherence with recommendations in their jurisdictions and consider implementing interventions to improve provider and patient compliance with gonorrhea treatment recommendations where indicated.\n\nGuidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension: Summary of Recommendations.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarberÃ , Joan Albert; RomÃ¡n, Antonio; GÃ³mez-SÃ¡nchez, Miguel Ãngel; Blanco, Isabel; Otero, Remedios; LÃ³pez-Reyes, Raquel; Otero, Isabel; PÃ©rez-PeÃ±ate, Gregorio; Sala, Ernest; Escribano, Pilar\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPulmonary hypertension is a hemodynamic disorder defined by abnormally high pulmonary artery pressure that can occur in numerous diseases and clinical situations.

In the United States, treatment options for uncomplicated, chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria in pregnant women are limited to mefloquine or quinine plus clindamycin (1). However, limited availability of quinine and increasing resistance to mefloquine restrict these options. Strong evidence now demonstrates that artemether-lumefantrine (AL) (Coartem) is effective and safe in the treatment of malaria in pregnancy. The World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), such as AL, for treatment of uncomplicated malaria during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and is currently considering whether to add ACTs, including AL, as an option for malaria treatment during the first trimester (2,3). This policy note reviews the evidence and updates CDC recommendations to include AL as a treatment option for uncomplicated malaria during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and during the first trimester of pregnancy when other treatment options are unavailable. These updated recommendations reflect current evidence and are consistent with WHO treatment guidelines.\n\nTreatment of severe psoriasis in children: recommendations of an Italian expert group.\n\nPubMed\n\nFortina, Anna Belloni; Bardazzi, Federico; Berti, Samantha; Carnevale, Claudia; Di Lernia, Vito; El Hachem, Maya; Neri, Iria; Gelmetti, Carlo Mario; Lora, Viviana; Mazzatenta, Carlo; Milioto, Mirella; Moretta, Gaia; Patrizi, Annalisa; Peris, Ketty; Villani, Alberto\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThis article provides comprehensive recommendations for the systemic treatment of severe pediatric psoriasis based on evidence obtained from a systematic review of the literature and the consensus opinion of expert dermatologists and pediatricians. For each systemic treatment, the grade of recommendation (A, B, C) based on the treatment's approval by the European Medicines Agency for childhood psoriasis and the experts' opinions is discussed. The grade of recommendation for narrow-band-ultraviolet B phototherapy, cyclosporine, and retinoids is C, while that for methotrexate is C/B. The use of adalimumab, etanercept, and ustekinumab has a grade A recommendation. No conventional systemic treatments are approved for pediatric psoriasis. Adalimumab is approved by the European Medicines Agency as a first-line treatment for severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children (â¥â4Â years old) and adolescents. Etanercept and ustekinumab are approved as second-line therapy in children â¥â6 and â¥â12Â years, respectively. A treatment algorithm as well as practical tools (i.e., tabular summaries of differential diagnoses, treatment mechanism of actions, dosing regimens, control parameters) are provided to assist in therapeutic reasoning and decision-making for individual patients. These treatment recommendations are endorsed by major Italian Pediatric and Dermatology Societies. What is Known: â¢ Guidelines for the treatment of severe pediatric psoriasis are lacking and most traditional systemic treatments are not approved for use in young patients. Although there has been decades of experience with some of the traditional agents such as phototherapy, acitretin, and cyclosporine in children, there are no RCTs on their pediatric use while RCTs investigating new biologic agents have been performed. What is New: â¢ In this manuscript, an Italian multidisciplinary team of experts focused on treatment recommendations for severe forms of psoriasis in children based on an up\n\nIdentification and treatment of augmentation in patients with restless legs syndrome: practical recommendations.\n\nPubMed\n\nGeyer, James; Bogan, Richard\n\n2017-09-01\n\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic disorder causing clinically significant discomfort to approximately 3% of adults. Although RLS was first identified centuries ago, our understanding of this disorder, its causes, and its treatments is still evolving. In particular, our knowledge of the potential negative effects of RLS treatments, including dopaminergic augmentation, continues to expand. Augmentation, which refers to a paradoxical treatment-related increase in RLS symptoms, has been associated with all three dopamine agonists approved for the treatment of RLS - rotigotine, pramipexole, and ropinirole. This review presents key information on prevention and treatment of dopaminergic augmentation from the recently published consensus-based guidelines issued by the International RLS Study Group task force in conjunction with the European RLS Study Group and the RLS Foundation for first-line treatment of RLS/Willis-Ekbom disease. If dopamine agonists are used to treat RLS, it is recommended that the dosage should be kept as low as possible without exceeding the maximum dose recommended for RLS treatment. As the frequency of augmentation with the rotigotine patch may only be slightly lower than that associated with pramipexole or ropinirole, medications that are effective and have little risk of augmentation, such as alpha-2-delta ligands, may be considered for initial RLS treatment. In addition, we present our clinical experience with treating patients with dopaminergic augmentation by highlighting 2 case studies and practical considerations when treating different patient populations. Applying current RLS augmentation diagnosis and treatment guidelines, as well as collecting detailed histories of worsening RLS symptoms, is critical for patient safety and effective management of RLS augmentation.\n\nProphylaxis and treatment of HIV-1 infection in pregnancy: Swedish recommendations 2010.\n\nPubMed\n\nNavÃ©r, Lars; Albert, Jan; Belfrage, Erik; Flamholc, Leo; GisslÃ©n, Magnus; Gyllensten, Katarina; Josephson, Filip; KarlstrÃ¶m, Olof; Lindgren, Susanne; Pettersson, Karin; Svedhem, Veronica; SÃ¶nnerborg, Anders; Westling, Katarina; Yilmaz, Aylin; Swedish Reference Group for Antiviral Therapy\n\n2011-07-01\n\nProphylaxis and treatment with antiretroviral drugs and the use of elective caesarean section have resulted in a very low mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during recent years. The availability of new antiretroviral drugs, updated general treatment guidelines and increasing knowledge of the importance of drug resistance, have necessitated regular revisions of the \"Prophylaxis and treatment of HIV-1 infection in pregnancy\" recommendations. For these reasons, The Swedish Reference Group for Antiviral Therapy (RAV) updated the 2007 recommendations at an expert meeting that took place on 25 March 2010. The most important revisions from the previous recommendations are: (1) it is recommended that treatment during pregnancy starts at the latest at gestational week 14-18; (2) ongoing efficient treatment at confirmed pregnancy may, with a few exceptions, be continued; (3) lopinavir/r and atazanavir/r are equally recommended protease inhibitors; (4) if maternal HIV RNA is >50 copies/ml close to delivery, a planned caesarean section, intravenous zidovudine, oral nevirapine for the mother and post-exposure prophylaxis for the infant with 3 antiretroviral drugs are recommended; (5) for delivery at <34 gestational weeks, intravenous zidovudine and oral nevirapine for the mother and at 48-72 h for the infant is recommended, in addition to other prophylaxis; (6) intravenous zidovudine is not recommended when HIV RNA is <50 copies/ml and a caesarean section is performed; (7) it is recommended that prophylaxis for the infant is started within 4 h; (8) prophylactic zidovudine for the infant may be administered twice daily instead of 4 times a day, as was the case previously; and (9) the number of sampling occasions for the infant has been decreased.\n\nNew and current preventive treatment options in actinic keratosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nArenberger, P; Arenbergerova, M\n\n2017-09-01\n\nActinic keratosis (AK) is a characteristic skin lesion on skin areas of subjects with mainly phototype I and phototype II, or with specific genetic factors and who are exposed to prolonged ultraviolet radiation. AK may be considered a precursor of inÂ situ squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a type of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). However, it is still not possible to predict which AK lesions will develop into SCC. Early treatment of AK is therefore recommended. Despite the increasing number of patients with AK developing into SCC, to date, there is still no clear suggestion of therapeutic strategy for AK. Current treatment consists of a multitude of topical lesion-directed or field-directed therapies or a combination of both. Recently, orally administered nicotinamide has shown to significantly reduce rates of new NMSC and AK in high-risk patients. This study aims to provide an update on the most relevant information about AK and to provide an insight into current and new treatment options.

Although statins are, overall, safe and well tolerated, adverse events can occur and constitute an important barrier to maintaining long-term adherence to statin treatment. In patients who cannot tolerate statins, alternative treatments include switch to another statin, intermittent-dosage regimens and non-statin lipid-lowering medications. Nonetheless, a high proportion of statin-intolerant patients are unable to achieve recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals, thereby resulting in substantial residual cardiovascular risk. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a protease implicated in LDL receptor degradation and plays a central role in cholesterol metabolism. In recent studies, PCSK9 inhibition by means of monoclonal antibodies achieved LDL cholesterol reductions of 50% to 70% across various patient populations and background lipid-lowering therapies, while maintaining a favourable safety profile. The efficacy and safety of the monoclonal antibodies alirocumab and evolocumab were confirmed in statin-intolerant patients, indicating that PCSK9 inhibitors represent an attractive treatment option in this challenging clinical setting. PCSK9 inhibitors recently received regulatory approval for clinical use and may be considered in properly selected patients according to current consensus documents, including patients with statin intolerance. In this review we summarise current evidence regarding diagnostic evaluation of statin-related adverse events, particularly statin-associated muscle symptoms, and we discuss current recommendations on the management of statin-intolerant patients. In view of emerging evidence of the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors, we further discuss the role of monoclonal PCSK9 antibodies in the management of statin-intolerant hypercholesterolaemic patients.\n\nCaregiver recall of treatment recommendations in juvenile idiopathic arthritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Civita, Mirella; Feldman, Debbie Ehrmann; Meshefedjian, Garbis A; Dobkin, Patricia L; Malleson, Pete; Duffy, CiarÃ¡n M\n\n2007-03-15\n\nHealth care providers in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) might refer to caregivers' self-report of children's treatment-related behaviors to assist in clinical decisions. However, caregivers may believe that they are adhering to treatment even though they have a different understanding of recommendations than that intended by the medical team. We examined whether caregiver recall of children's JIA treatment matched actual recommendations at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. A total of 235 primary caregivers were recruited from rheumatology clinics at 2 pediatric university-based teaching hospitals in Canada. Using the Parent Adherence Report Questionnaire, caregivers indicated whether their child was prescribed medications and/or exercises. Medical charts were reviewed to determine the prescribed treatment. Level of agreement between both sets of data was then examined. A total of 175 caregivers provided complete data. Mean age of the children was 10.2 years (68.6% girls); 44.6% were diagnosed with oligoarthritis. Kappa coefficients for medication represented substantial to almost perfect agreement beyond chance, with better levels of agreement at 12 months (kappa = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.68, 0.94) than at baseline (kappa = 0.61, 95% CI 0.47, 0.76). Kappa coefficients for exercise represented slight to moderate agreement beyond chance, with better agreement at 12 months (kappa = 0.44, 95% CI 0.24, 0.63) than at baseline (kappa = 0.27, 95% CI 0.08, 0.47). Weaker agreement for the exercise regimen raises concern that caregivers may pay less attention to exercise recommendations or that these recommendations may not be easily understood.\n\nEquine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction: current understanding and recommendations from the Australian and New Zealand Equine Endocrine Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nSecombe, C J; Bailey, S R; de Laat, M A; Hughes, K J; Stewart, A S; Sonis, J M; Tan, Rhh\n\n2018-06-03\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a review of the current knowledge and opinions about the epidemiology, clinical findings (including sequelae), diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction, particularly in the Australian context.
