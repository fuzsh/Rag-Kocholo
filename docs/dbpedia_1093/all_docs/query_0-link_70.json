        "text": "The tension on the water at Sailing World Cup Miami presented by Sunbrella was fully loaded as Medal Races across the ten Olympic fleets drew the first big regatta of 2016, the Olympic year, to a close.\n\nMany podium finishers from six days of racing in Miami will feature on the Rio 2016 pedestal in 188 days’ time and Miami can be viewed as a marker of what is to come this year.\n\nIn a week plagued by grey skies and fickle breeze the sun shone brightly in Miami but the light winds remained.\n\nAlex Maloney and Molly Meech (NZL) came into the day as the only team who had gold wrapped up. In the remaining nine events it was wide open and in a shifty northern 6-8 knot breeze there were up, downs, disappointments and highs in their numbers.\n\nOlympic medallists such as Robert Scheidt (BRA), Dorian Van Rijsselberge (NED), Evi Van Acker (BEL) and Bryony Shaw (GBR) showed their worth, taking the honours in their respective fleets. In the remaining divisions, several new contenders emerged including Diego Botin and Iago Lopez (ESP) and Mandy Mulder and Coen de Koning (NED) who won in world class fields.\n\nNacra 17\n\nMandy Mulder and Coen de Koning (NED) claimed gold in the Nacra 17, jumping up the leader board after a tense light wind Nacra 17 race.\n\nThe Dutch pair occupied third overall heading into the Medal Race with Jason Waterhouse and Lisa Darmanin (AUS) in pole position and Matias Buhler and Nathalie Brugger (SUI) in second.\n\nEight points split the trio beforehand with an unassailable advantage over the chasing pack. The sailors on the podium were decided, but the colour of the medal they’d receive was far from certain.\n\nThe leading Australians were penalised at the start and were up against it immediately, crossing the start line well behind the pack. Meanwhile, the Dutch pair got underway without fear and worries as the only way for them was up.\n\nBen Saxton and Nicola Groves (GBR) ran away from the fleet to take the race win by a minute over Fernando Echavarri and Tara Pacheco (ESP).\n\nThe Dutch crossed the finish line third and had to watch the finishers to see if they’d moved up. Waterhouse and Darmanin crossed in seventh and the Swiss in ninth which gave them gold.\n\n“Out there we used our speed well and we went to the left of the first upwind and it paid off,” explained Mulder. “We were leading at the top mark and consolidated. We ended up third which was enough for the regatta win.\n\n“We were in a perfect position to go full on today and take some risks.”\n\nDarmanin and Waterhouse ended up tied on 119 points with the Dutch but missed out via the Medal Race countback, settling for silver. Buhler and Brugger completed the Nacra 17 podium.\n\nThe Nacra 17 fleet will have to go through the emotions again in just a matter of days with the World Championships taking place in Clearwater, Florida, USA from 6 -14 February.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nWhen regatta leader Marit Bouwmeester (NED) was flagged by the officials shortly after the start, it appeared Evi van Acker (BEL) had the opening she needed to close the 6-point gap that stood between her and a gold medal. Indeed, Bouwmeester was 10th around the first mark. But van Acker was ninth. These positions held around the second mark. On the third leg, van Acker made her move.\n\n“I went on the right side when the wind was dying, but I thought change was coming,” said van Acker, the bronze medalist in the 2012 Olympics in London. “The wind turned to the right and I was there when it turned.”\n\nVan Acker went from ninth to third on the second beat and then picked up another place on the final run. Meanwhile, Bouwmeester, who had so little trouble moving through the fleet earlier in the regatta, was unable to make any significant gains during the second half of the race. Van Acker’s second, to Bouwmeeter’s seventh, was enough to flip flop the overall positions the two sailors held coming into the Medal Race.\n\nSarah Gunni Toftedal (DEN) struggled during the medal race and finished last. But none of her rivals for the bronze medal were able to take advantage of the situation and Gunni Toftedal held on to the bronze. Alison Young (GBR) was fourth, with Emma Plasschaert (BEL) in fifth.\n\nPaige Railey (USA) won the medal race and while her move from 10th to eighth didn’t factor into the podium standings it did earn her two additional places in her battle for the U.S. Olympic berth in Rio. Her primary rival, Erika Reineke finished 17th in the regatta and will have to make up 9 places on Railey in Part 2 of the U.S. Athlete Selection Series.\n\nDisplaying a veteran’s poise, five-time Olympic medalist Robert Scheidt (BRA) sailed a steady medal race in trying conditions to win gold in the Sailing World Cup Miami. While the positions around him switched considerably over the course of the 25-minute race, Scheidt rounded each mark in fourth place and finished fourth.\n\n“It was a tough race, the wind was light and shifty,” he said. “I was worrying about the French guy as he was the one I had to finish ahead of to win today. He got to the [first] mark ahead of me, which made things very interesting. At the gate we had a split, which was lucky for me as I finished ahead of him.\n\n“I sailed well this week. The Medal Races are always tough and very close. The day has a huge impact on the result and I took my opportunities today.”\n\nJean Baptiste Bernaz (FRA), who made his international regatta debut the same year Scheidt won his third Olympic medal, started the day with a one-point lead in the overall standings. Though he didn’t win the gold, he can be comforted that he was just a place away from defeating one of the sport’s living legends. He’s clearly moving up the ladder and in good position to improve upon his 10th in the London Games.\n\nScheidt, though pleased with his results this week, knows the work of an Olympic sailor is never done. He’ll take some time to recoup, and then get right back to the grind.\n\n“After this I am taking a break,” he said. “In March I will be back training in Rio. Rio is going to be quite a difficult venue with challenging conditions. I’ve sailed there for 25 years and I still don’t know the place. I’ll try and get myself comfortable with the place.”\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nBryony Shaw (GBR) made a terrific comeback in the second upwind in the Women’s RS:X to seal her third consecutive Sailing World Cup Miami gold.\n\nAfter the first lap of the course, Shaw was as low as ninth, leaving Lilian de Geus (NED) first overall. Shaw knew what had to be done and her never say die attitude enabled her to fight and push up the fleet.\n\nOn the final upwind Shaw swiftly moved into seventh, sixth and at the top mark had overtaken de Geus and was third overall. She maintained that position through to the finish to seal the deal.\n\n“This week was about consistency,” said Shaw, a Beijing 2008 bronze medallist. “We had a lot of different winds this week so I was happy to sail well in the light winds and strong winds. The focus for more has been on training to prepare for the World Championships. We’ve had a really good quality fleet here so I am pleased to take the win today. It’s good momentum to take into the World Championships.”\n\nDe Geus wrapped up the week with silver and Peina Chen (CHN) completed the podium.\n\nLondon 2012 Olympic gold medallist Dorian van Rijsselberge (NED) started 2016, an Olympic year, with a big, convincing win in the Men’s RS:X.\n\nVan Rijsselberge finished seventh in the Medal Race, his worst result this week, but his consistency over the series kept the pressure off him as he went in with a nice gap between him and the chasing pack.\n\n“I like Miami and like racing here,” said Van Rijsselberge after competition. “I’ve been coming here for eight years now so I’ve got the place sorted and I enjoy racing here.”\n\nNick Dempsey won the Medal Race finishing six points off the Dutchman to pick up silver and Aichen Wang (CHN) rounded off the podium.\n\nFinn\n\nNo class had more sailors enter the medal race with a shot at the gold. Six Finn sailors started the final contest with a legitimate shot at the medal. Adding to this was a light, shifty breeze that provided plenty of passing lanes. But when the dust had settled the top two sailors entering the race, Jorge Zarif (BRA) and Jonas Hoegh-Christensen, were the top two in the final results.\n\n“It was really hard as everybody was really close before the race,” said Zarif. “I thought the left side of the racing area was paying a little bit more. I tried to be there more than the others and it worked well.”\n\nZarif held the lead around the first two marks, but dropped to fourth on third leg when a big left shift jumbled up the standings. On the fourth leg he ground back to second place, where he finished. Arkadiy Kistanov of Russia won the Medal Race and was able to vault from fifth to third in the overall standings. Jake Lilley (AUS) was fourth in the race and third in the overall standings.\n\nFor Zarif, who hadn’t previously won a World Cup race, this was a significant victory as he prepares to compete for the home crowd in Rio.\n\n“Next we will have 15 days of training in Rio now with Rafa [Trujillo] my coach and then we go to the Europeans, Palma, Hyeres, the Worlds and then back to Rio,” said Zarif. “I was happy with the week I had, but I could have finished sixth or first today. That could have easily happened if something bad happened today. I just tried to do the best I could.”\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nFor the Men’s 470 fleet, the crucial moment in the Medal Race came right at the starting gun. Stu McNay and David Hughes (USA), one of three teams that entered the race in a virtual tie for first, controlled the left end of the starting line and were able to tack at the gun and cross the fleet, putting themselves in a very strong position right out of the starting blocks.\n\n“We saw an opportunity at the start and we were able to take advantage of it and get an early lead on the fleet,” said McNay, a two-time Olympian in the 470. “Dave called some great shifts on the first upwind.”\n\nMcNay and Hughes rounded the first mark with a 30-second lead over the fleet and never looked back, at least figuratively. In light conditions, no lead is ever truly safe.\n\n“It was an easy race course to become frustrated with as it was very shifty and variable,” said Hughes. “By the same token, the teams that did well at this event just embraced it and played it forward from whatever position they were in. We are happy to better them all in the end.”\n\nThe most interesting battle of the race was for the silver medal, with Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis (GRE) and Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP) rounding the first mark separated by just 4 seconds. On the second upwind leg the Greek duo was able to put over a minute on their rivals and all but clinch the silver medal. Jacob and Graeme Chaplin-Saunders finished second in the medal race and moved up a spot, to seventh, in the overall standings.\n\nMcNay and Hughes will hope to carry the momentum they earned in Miami this winter into the class’s world championships in Argentina in February.\n\n“This is the third of three events in Miami this winter and we can proudly say we have won all three of them,” McNay said. “We felt that to do that many competitions back to back to back would be the best way to prepare ourselves for the upcoming World championships.”\n\nConsider it a job well done, on to the next challenge.\n\n“There are many events between now and Rio and we are just going to chip away at one event of a time,” said Hughes. “We’ve got lots to work on and as with any Olympic campaign there are a lot of different boxes to tick.”\n\nShasha Chen and Haiyan Gao (CHN) started the Medal Race much the way they started the regatta, in last place. The first race of the event, which might seem like it took place a month ago given the twists and turns of this event, resulted in a DSQ for the Chinese team. Likewise, the first leg of the Medal Race didn’t go well and Chen and Gao rounded the first mark in last place, 48 seconds off the lead and in real danger of missing the podium entirely.\n\nBut in the light and shifty conditions, persistence was the key; and passing opportunities were there for the taking. Chen and Gao found a few on each of the next three legs, moving to sixth on the first run and then to third on the final run. Meanwhile, their chief rivals for gold, Lara Vadlau and Jolanta Ogar (AUT) and Fernanda Oliveira and Luiza Ana Barbachan (BRA) found the going much more challenging. With those teams finishing in eighth and 10th respectively, Chen and Gao claimed the gold medal, with the Austrians in second and the Brazilian team, which led for much of the regatta, in third.\n\n49er and 49erFX\n\nDiego Botin and Iago Lopez (ESP) ventured into the 49er Medal Race with a strong lead and as they came through in second, a convincing victory was signed, sealed and delivered.\n\nPortugal’s Jorge Lima and Jose Costa had an outside chance of overthrowing the Spaniards but Lopez felt no worries as he explained, “For us we had to take control of the Portuguese guys today. We had a 12-point advantage so we wanted to control them with some tactics to win.\n\n“We finished second, which was a really good result for us and we won. We’re really happy.”\n\nLima and Costa settled for silver and Carl P Sylvan and Marcus Anjemark (SWE) completed the podium.\n\nAlex Maloney and Molly Meech (NZL) had gold all sewn up before the Medal Race so the pressure was off.\n\nThe real battle in the 49erFX was for silver and bronze with Jena Mai Hansen and Katja Salskov-Iversen (DEN) and Lisa Ericson and Hanna Klinga (SWE) split by one point.\n\nHansen and Salskov Iversen were sublime in the Medal Race. Chased by the Swedes they did not let up. They led from the off and used their superior boat speed to pull away and claim a well deserved silver medal.\n\nFrom now on, it’s full on to Rio 2016 with World Cups, World Championships and continental championships coming thick and fast before the flame is lit in Rio de Janeiro on 5 August 2016.\n\nThe 470s, 49er, 49erFX, Nacra 17 and RS:Xs will have to reset quickly with their World Championships taking place in February. The remaining fleets will hold theirs later on this year.\n\nDaniel Smith and Stuart Streuli\n\nThe fans was turned up for the final day at ISAF Sailing World Cup Hyères as an exciting finale played out across two racing areas.\n\n18-20 knots of breeze ensured the regatta concluded with thrills and spills aplenty. Seven races unravelled on the live broadcast area – click here for a full replay – whilst a further three concluded nearby.\n\nLive Medal Race Replay Embed Code\n\nAcross the ten Olympic disciplines, ISAF Sailing World Cup Hyères medals were awarded, a share of the €72,000 was distributed and ISAF Sailing World Cup Final spots were picked up.\n\n49erFX\n\nLast on the race track on the final day, the 49erFX provided a blockbuster conclusion.\n\nBig breeze and big waves tested the 49erFX sailors and there were some thrills, spills and close shaves in a testing race.\n\nOne point split overnight leaders Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze (BRA) and Denmark’s Ida Marie Baad Nielsen and Marie Thusgaard Olsen coming into the day.\n\nFollowing a clear start and intriguing upwind leg, the first mark saw the Danes hold the advantage, getting clear air in their sails. However a close rounding saw the Brazilians touch the mark resulting in a penalty turn and from there they were always playing catch up.\n\nThe Danes were able to edge away ensuring an uphill battle for the Brazilians. Pushing their 49erFX to its limits Grael and Kunze lost a bit of control on the second downwind but expertly held it together, with Grael hanging out of the boat yet keeping it upright.\n\nMeanwhile the Danes were never under great pressure, working through the motions and despite being pipped to the Medal Race win by compatriots Jena Hansen and Katja Salskov-Iversen (DEN) they claimed gold by seven points over silver recipients Grael and Kunze.\n\n“We had a really good race,” commented the pair almost in tandem. “We kept calm throughout the course and that was important in these conditions.\n\n“We kept it simple, without pressure and sailed fast.”\n\nGiulia Conti and Francesca Clapcich (ITA) held on to bronze after a fifth. After racing Conti said, “We made a few mistakes so we’re a little disappointed but we’re happy because we had good boat speed and handling. We are happy with bronze. It means a lot to us. After silver in Miami it’s important for us.”\n\nTop Three\n\n1 – Ida Marie Baad Nielsen and Marie Thusgaard Olsen (DEN) – 87\n\n2 – Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze (BRA) – 94\n\n3 – Giulia Conti and Francesca Clapcich (ITA) – 99\n\nWomen’s 470\n\nIt was a winner takes all scenario in the Women’s 470 with any of the top four capable of taking gold.\n\nFernanda Oliveira and Ana Luiza Barbachan (BRA), Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark (GBR), Jo Aleh and Polly Powrie (NZL) and Camille Lecointre and Helene Defrance (FRA) were all in the running with the capabilities to command and conquer.\n\nIn a close, exciting race Medal Race Brazil’s Oliveira and Barbachan came out of the blocks with intent and led at the first mark. They made some gains on the downwind but had Japan’s Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka for company on the second lap. The Japanese pair passed the Brazilians to take the bullet but it was irrelevant as the Brazilians were well clear of their rivals and finished in second to take gold.\n\n“The points were so close,” explained Oliveira. “We thought that we must do our job and sail our own race. We thought about the points and the other boats but we just focused on us. It was perfect. We finished second in the race and we’re so happy.\n\n“It was our goal to win here and we worked very hard for this and we got it. It’s amazing, we’re so happy.”\n\nAleh and Powrie came through in third in the Medal Race to move up into silver medal position. “It’s a great way to finish,” commented Aleh. “It’s been a tough week. The Brazilians have been great all week and it was an exciting Medal Race with us all fighting it out.”\n\nCamille Lecointre and Helene Defrance (FRA) followed behind the Kiwis and clinched bronze. Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark (GBR) missed out on the podium by a single point.\n\nTop Three Women’s 470\n\nFernanda Oliveira & Ana Luiza Barbachan (BRA) – 45\n\nJo Aleh & Polly Powrie (NZL) – 53\n\nCamille Lecointre & Helene Defrance (FRA) – 54\n\nMen’s 470\n\nIt was clear for all to see that Sime Fantela and Igor Marenic’s (CRO) winter training paid off. The pair ended came into the Medal Race 25 points clear of Luke Patience and Elliot Willis (GBR) to claim the gold medal a day early.\n\nFantela and Igor got off to a great start in the windiest and roughest sea state that the competition had seen all week to finish seventh in the fleet, ending the ISAF Sailing World Cup Hyères on an impressive 40 points.\n\nThe fight for second and third place however was much less certain.\n\nMat Belcher and Will Ryan (AUS) rounded the first mark in pole position. They held their lead throughout the race and went on the claim the Medal Race victory which handed them silver. Luke Patience and Elliot Willis (GBR) finished just four points behind the Australians in third place.\n\nTop Three\n\n1 – Sime Fantela & Igor Marenic (CRO) – 40\n\n2 – Mat Belcher & Will Ryan (AUS) – 55\n\n3 – Luke Patience & Elliot Willis (GBR) – 59\n\nWomen’s RS:X\n\nLilian De Geus (NED) booked her ticket to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and the Abu Dhabi World Cup Final by taking gold in the Women’s RS:X.\n\nThe Dutch sailor had a solid advantage heading into the Medal Race and knew a good performance would seal the deal. She put on an outstanding show in the Medal Race and established a commanding lead on the final downwind.\n\nShe pulled away to take her first race win of the week, ending 11 points clear of Charline Picon (FRA).\n\nIt was a high scoring affair in the Women’s RS:X with ups and downs aplenty.\n\nPicon came through in second in the Medal Race to take silver, a result she was pleasantly surprised with, “If you had said to me three days ago ‘you’ll win silver this week’ I would have said that it was impossible but I’d never give up.\n\n“I never gave up, I tried to fight and I’m happy because I have silver but I’m not happy about my week as I had a lot of bad races.”\n\nPatricia Freitas (BRA) pushed Picon hard in the Medal Race in an attempt to overthrow her but at the penultimate rounding she misjudged the layline which allowed the French sailor to pass. Nonetheless Freitas came through in third, taking bronze.\n\nTop Three\n\n1 – Lilian de Geus (NED) – 90\n\n2 – Charline Picon (FRA) – 101\n\n3 – Patricia Freitas (BRA) – 104\n\nMen’s RS:X\n\nA competition made up of the world’s most skilled male windsurfers was always going to be a tough challenge for all competitors. Throughout the week there have been many ups and downs with multiple race winners.\n\nFrance’s Pierre Le Coq started the day knowing that he would take home a medal. The Frenchman entered the Medal Race at the top of the leaderboard with a 15 point lead. An eighth or better would seal the deal and Le Coq finished in seventh to wrap up gold.\n\nPiotr Myszka (POL) was on top form in the big breeze, coming second to take silver whilst a fourth for Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) saw him drop into bronze medal position.\n\nLouis Giard (FRA) revelled in the big breeze and took the Medal Race win. With three race victories, Giard recorded the most out of any racer but was not consistent and ended up eighth overall.\n\nTop Three\n\n1 – Pierre le Coq (FRA) – 74\n\n2 – Piotr Myszka (POL – 81 –\n\n3 – Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) – 83\n\nFinn\n\nGreat Britain’s Giles Scott had gold all but wrapped up in the Finn and a Medal Race bullet confirmed his place at the top of the pack.\n\nScott has controlled the week with a discarded 24th his only result outside of the top ten and he was pleased with his performance, “Taking the event and the Medal Race win is a great way to round up the regatta, especially when it is my first win in Hyères.\n\n“This was not an easy regatta. The conditions were super difficult with light and shifty winds for most of the week so the result is very rewarding.”\n\nVasilij Zbogar (SLO) gave himself a huge chance of taking a medal following double bullets on the penultimate day. He followed this up with a third in the Medal Race to hold on to silver.\n\nGreat Britain’s Ed Wright finished the Medal Race in eighth which was enough to hang on to bronze on 75 points. A fifth from Zsombor Berecz (HUN) left him three points off bronze medal position.\n\nTop Three\n\n1 – Giles Scott (GBR) – 38\n\n2 – Vasilij Zbogar (SLO) – 62\n\n3 – Ed Wright (GBR) – 75\n\nLaser\n\nAn overnight protest significantly altered the Laser leaderboard.\n\nThe results before the protest saw Tonci Stipanovic (CRO) but a solid lead over Tom Burton. However, during the final fleet race Stipanovic pushed Burton off of the proper course and gained a significant advantage as a result. Following the protest, Stipanovic was scored a non discardable 41st having infringed Tom Burton (AUS). The Australian received 21 points following a redress.\n\nBurton came into the day leading on 45 points, followed by Nick Thompson (GBR) on 47 points. Rutger van Schaardenburg (NED) and Nicholas Heiner (NED) followed on 57 points with Robert Scheidt (BRA) on 58. Stipanovic, meanwhile, was down the pack on 75 points.\n\nThe race commenced in a good breeze and Heiner was over the line early and disqualified ensuring he dropped out of the running.\n\nCharlie Buckingham (USA) came out strongly and grabbed the lead. He was closely followed by Burton and the pair jostled at the front of the pack.\n\nBuckingham had the best of the back and forth exchange, taking the bullet. Burton followed 11 seconds behind to claim gold much to his delight as he hit is Laser with a mixture of relief and frustration after a tough week.\n\nWith Heiner out of the running it was between Thompson, van Schaardenburg and Scheidt for the remaining medals.\n\nThompson remained in control and picked up a fifth to take silver. Scheidt kept van Schaardenburg at bay to finish fourth, claiming bronze.\n\nTop Three\n\n1 – Tom Burton (AUS) – 49\n\n2 – Nick Thompson (GBR) – 57\n\n3 – Robert Scheidt (BRA) – 66\n\nLaser Radial\n\nEvi Van Acker (BEL) made it look easy in the Laser Radial taking out the Medal Race bullet to win by 21 points.\n\nIt was all on for the remaining podium spots between Gintare Scheidt (LTU), Josefin Olsson (SWE) and Anne-Marie Rindom (DEN).\n\nScheidt ventured into the Medal Race on 38 points with Rindom on 44 and Olsson on 46.\n\nWhilst Van Acker ran away with the victory Olsson gritted her teeth and got down to business. Pushing hard throughout the race she finished second, doing all she could have possibly done, having started the day in fourth overall.\n\nOlsson had an anxious wait to see where she would finish overall and she witnessed Rindom coming through in fourth followed by Scheidt in fifth. As a result Olsson leapfrogged Rindom but it was not enough to overhaul Scheidt who claimed silver.\n\nTop Three\n\n1 – Evi Van Acker (BEL) – 25\n\n2 – Gintare Scheidt (LTU) – 48\n\n3 – Josefin Olsson (SWE) – 50\n\n49er\n\nPeter Burling and Blair Tuke (NZL) and Nathan Outteridge and Iain Jensen (AUS) had gold and silver wrapped up in advance of the Medal Race but there was a fight on for bronze.\n\nThe advantage ahead of the day was with David Gilmour and Rhys Mara (AUS). They had an eight point advantage over Germany’s Erik Heil and Thomas Ploessel and were in control for the first 50% of the race. However, on the second downwind disaster struck for Gilmour and Mara as they capsized and lost their third position.\n\nThe Australians dropped down the pack and came through in ninth. The Germans capitalised on the Australians misfortune, coming through in fourth to steal bronze.\n\nTop Three\n\nPeter Burling & Blair Tuke (NZL) – 49\n\nNathan Outteridge & Iain Jensen (AUS) – 98\n\nErik Heil & Thomas Ploessel (GER) – 144\n\nNacra 17\n\nBilly Besson and Marie Riou (FRA) stylishly sealed gold and an Abu Dhabi Final spot in the Nacra 17 by winning the Medal Race in convincing fashion.\n\nThe French team have been dominant in the Nacra 17 and had gold wrapped up in advance of the Medal Race. Besson and Riou got off to a blistering start and were able to grab an early advantage over the pack and never looked back, taking the bullet by 14 seconds over Mandy Mulder and Coen de Koning (NED).\n\n“We’re feeling good,” smiled Besson, “It’s a great day and it’s great to win the Medal Race and finish the week off like that.\n\n“It was really important for France to win here and everybody, including me, is really proud.”\n\nA real battle was on behind the French team between the two boats from the Netherlands with Rio 2016 Olympic selection on the line.\n\nMandy Mulder and Coen de Koning (NED) brought in an advantage from Trofeo Princesca Sofia and confirmed their spot by finishing second in the Medal Race and second overall. “We’ve qualified for the Olympics for sure,” smiled de Koning.\n\nMulder added, “This whole week has been a good learning curve for us. We had some difficult conditions with moderate to light winds. The first day was really hard. We had some results in 20s and we learnt a lot and how to come back. We performed well in the next days and we’ll take that with us.”\n\nRenee Groeneveld and Steven Krol (NED) pushed their compatriots throughout the week but couldn’t quite overhaul them picking up bronze.\n\nTop Three\n\n1 – Billy Besson & Marie Riou (FRA) – 57\n\n2 – Mandy Mulder & Coen de Koning (NED) – 84\n\n3 – Renee Groeneveld & Steven Krol (NED) – 98\n\nSailors will now regroup and review ahead of the Delta Lloyd Regatta which takes in Medemblik, the Netherlands from 26-30 May 2015. The Delta Lloyd Regatta acts as the qualification regatta for ISAF Sailing World Cup Weymouth and Portland which takes place at the London 2012 Olympic Sailing Competition venue from 8-14 June.\n\nThe world’s best 40 Olympic and Paralympic sailors will put their skills to the test once again in Weymouth and Portland, Great Britain with World Cup honours and Abu Dhabi Final places on the line.\n\nGold medals in the Men’s 470, 49er and the Nacra 17 have been confirmed at ISAF Sailing World Hyères following commanding displays by the leading teams.\n\nDominant performances from Sime Fantela and Igor Marenic (CRO), Peter Burling and Blair Tuke (NZL) and Billy Besson and Marie Riou (FRA) have ensured they walk away with ISAF Sailing World Cup Hyères gold, a spot on the Abu Dhabi Final start line and a share of the €72,000 prize fund.\n\nGiles Scott (GBR) has all but wrapped up gold in the Finn but for the remaining fleets, the competition is wide open ahead of Sunday’s live Medal Races.\n\nA medium breeze in the region of 9-11 knots ensured all fleets got on the water for their start times with a full complement of racing completed.\n\nMedal Racing on Sunday 26 April is scheduled to commence at 11:15 local time on the live course area with the schedule as follows (times CEST):\n\nNacra 17 – 11:15\n\nRS:X Men – 12:05\n\nRS:X Women – 12:55\n\n470 Women – 13:45\n\nLaser – 14:35\n\nLaser Radial – 15:25\n\n49erFX – 16:15\n\nMedal Race highlights from the 49er (11:40), Finn (12:30) and 470 Men (13:20) will be shown throughout the broadcast.\n\nGet involved with the Live Medal Races by sending in your questions for the sailors and the commentators by using the #LiveSailing hashtag and mentioning @ISAFupdates.\n\nURL and Embed Code:\n\nURL – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7ERcAOFhdM\n\nEmbed –\n\n49er and 49erFX\n\nPeter Burling and Blair Tuke (NZL) were dominant once again in the 49er, sealing the deal with even a race to spare in the fleet racing.\n\nThe Kiwis have been unstoppable since London 2012, winning every regatta they’ve attended. Their gains and margins have increased but Burling remained modest after racing, “It’s pretty tough in the 49er in that big fleet. It’s the first time we raced in light air in a big fleet. If you start badly you’ll be in a tough place but if you get a good start and a good shift then you’ll be in really good shape.\n\n“We were stoked to get a couple of good solid ones to begin with and then have it done before the last race today. It’s pleasing to see how our hard work has gone over the New Zealand summer. Everybody else has definitely improved as well. It’s probably a lot tighter out there than the scoreboard shows.”\n\nThe scoreboard shows the Kiwis 45 points clear of Nathan Outteridge and Iain Jensen (AUS) who also sealed silver with only the Medal Race to go.\n\nOutteridge and Jensen won ISAF Sailing World Cup Melbourne to qualify for the World Cup Final. For Burling and Tuke, their victory in Hyères guarantees them a spot on the startline, “The Abu Dhabi final looks really good fun,” added Burling, “It didn’t fit in with our calendar last year as we had a lot on but we’ll probably go this year.”\n\nAlongside World Cup glory and an Abu Dhabi spot the Kiwis also walk away with a share of the €72,000 prize pot. Burling concluded, “Hamish told us on the first day of the event that there’s a little bit of prize money and the live coverage of the Medal Race.\n\n“It’s cool to see a bit of that in the sport now and the live coverage is awesome so people back home can see a bit of what we do. It’s great to see the sport going that way.”\n\nThe battle for bronze will be between Erik Heil and Thomas Ploessel (GER) and John Pink and Stuart Bithell (GBR). The Germans have the advantage on 132 points with the British team eight behind.\n\nIt’ll go down to the wire in the 49erFX after ISAF Rolex World Sailors of the Year Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze (BRA) knocked Denmark’s Ida Marie Nielsen and Marie Olsen off top spot for the first time.\n\nThe Danes had led from day one but the chasing pack chipped away as the week played out. Grael and Kunze recorded a 4-3-10-5 whilst the Danish team picked up a 8-1-19-12. As a result, the Brazilians lead by a single point.\n\nGiulia Conti and Francesca Clapcich (ITA) were the stars of the day taking double bullets to move into third, seven points off the Brazilian leaders.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nLaser leader Tonci Stipanovic (CRO) had a clear plan for Saturday’s racing, “I will try to sail the first race the best I can and finish in the top three and if possible, try and win it.\n\n“After that, if everything is between me and him [Tom Burton] I will maybe try and to go on him because he’s discarding 31 and I’m discarding just eight. I think I’m in a good position but we’ll have to wait for the first race tomorrow.”\n\nStipanovic knuckled down in the opening race picking up a sixth and duly punished Tom Burton (AUS) in the second, pushing him down the pack. Burton ended up 31st, which he now counts whilst Stipanovic discards his 33rd.\n\nStipanovic leads on 42 points with Nick Thompson (GBR) second on 47 points and Burton third on 55 points. It’ll be full on in the Medal Race with Rutger van Schaardenburg (NED) and Nicholas Heiner (NED) on 57 points and Robert Scheidt (BRA) on 58 points.\n\nDefending Hyères Laser Radial champion Evi Van Acker (BEL) controlled the day, putting in a professional performance. A fifth and a bullet has given her a 13 point lead over Gintare Scheidt (LTU).\n\n“I could have done better today,” commented Van Acker, “The first upwind wasn’t so good, the first downwind also. But I caught up and finished fifth. The second race was much better and I stuck to the plan and had great speed and won with big distances.\n\n“I’m happy about this week and looking forward to the Medal Race tomorrow. I think we will have great wind, a nice easterly breeze and I just want to win and that will be my main focus.”\n\nVan Acker has been a mainstay at the front of the Laser Radial pack and has enjoyed racing with the best of the best from day one, “It’s not so crowded. It’s tight racing and you’re immediately into the finals so the pressure is a much higher. But for me, I see it as nothing different. It’s just racing but I’m liking it.”\n\nAnne-Marie Rindom (DEN) had a mixed day with a fourth and a 15th. As a result she slips from second to third on 44 points. Josefin Olsson (SWE) is two points off the Dane in fourth.\n\nNacra 17\n\nFrance’s Billy Besson and Marie Riou clinched an early gold in the Nacra 17 with another dominating display. The French team have been a class above the rest across the 11 race series, notching up three race victories and as a result, they have an unassailable 25 point lead.\n\nFrom the day’s four races Besson and Riou recorded a 1-(14)-9-5 scoreline which was enough for gold with only the Medal Race remaining.\n\nThe story on the Medal Race day will be on the silver and bronze medals. Mandy Mulder and Coen de Koning (NED) are six points clear of compatriots Renee Groeneveld and Steven Krol with Ben Saxton and Nicola Groves (GBR) three further points off in fourth.\n\nUp first at 11:15, the Nacra 17 Medal Race will prove to be an interesting opener on the final day of competition.\n\nFurther race victories on the day went to Darren Bundock and Nina Curtis (AUS) who are seventh, Groeneveld and Krol, and Saxton and Groves.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nThe Men’s RS:X has stirred up some interesting competition across the 11 race series. With the world’s best male windsurfers in the fleet it’s been an up and down week with multiple leaders and race winners.\n\nHeading into the Medal Race atop of the pile is France’s Pierre Le Coq. The Frenchman was in terrific form posting a 2-3-7 and has guaranteed himself a medal. With a 15 point lead over second place, a solid performance will ensure he walks away with gold.\n\nByron Kokkalanis (GRE) is second on 75 points followed by Piotr Myszka (POL) on 77 points. Julien Bontemps (FRA) is firmly in the running for a medal with 80 points in fourth.\n\nStealing the day in the Men’s RS:X was Louis Giard with a 1-1-2 scoreline. The youngster’s performance was a stark contrast to some larger numbers posted earlier on in the week but he pulled himself into the Medal Race to compete for another day.\n\nLilian De Geus (NED) will go into the Women’s RS:X Medal Race with a nine point lead. The Dutch sailor is reaping the rewards of a good opening five races where she notched up a 15-3-2-4-4 to give her a solid cushion. A 13-11-8-(25)-19-9 has followed but she retains her overnight lead.\n\nCharline Picon jumped into second overall following a final race bullet. With 97 points she is a point ahead of Patricia Freitas (BRA).\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nThere have been some intense battles for the top spot in the Women’s 470. Race wins have been spread across the fleet resulting in some big movements on the leader board. Six points separate first to fourth so it’ll go down to the wire on Medal Race day.\n\nA 4-7 score line ensures Fernanda Oliveira and Ana Barbachan (BRA) hang on to the leading position for two days running.\n\nHannah Mills and Saskia Clark (GBR) had an impressive day on the water, gaining a second and bullet in the light conditions. The pair will enter the Medal Race in second place, just two points behind the leaders.\n\nJo Aleh and Polly Powrie (NZL) piled on some pressure with a bullet and a third. As a result they sit in fourth, one point off Camille Lecointre and Hélène Defrance (FRA).\n\nIn contrast, the Men’s 470 leader board is a little more set ahead of Sunday’s Medal Race.\n\nSime Fantela and Igor Marenic (CRO) built on their lead posting a sixth and a bullet. They ended the day an 25 points clear of Luke Patience and Elliot Willis (GBR) to claim the gold medal and a share of the €72,000 prize money with only the Medal Race remaining.\n\nAfter arriving ashore Marenic chirped, “We are thrilled with how our week went. We sailed really consistently so we are super happy we won before the Medal Race.”\n\nEven though the Croatians have gold sealed they won’t be taking it easy on the final day, “We sail every Medal Race with a sharp mind and we will always try to do our best so that is what we plan to do tomorrow.”\n\nHowever, the story is still not over for the rest of the fleet. Patience and Willis, sit on 51 points in second, with Mat Belcher and Will Ryan (GBR) and Ferdinand Gerz and Oliver Szymanski (GER) hot on their heels.\n\nThings were looking hopeful at the start of day for Matthias Schmid and Florian Reichstädter (AUT) who were straight out of the traps, claiming the first race win of the day moving them higher up the leader board. After claiming 21st place in the second race they were left 19th overall, missing out on a place in Sunday’s Medal Race.\n\nWith only a few points between the top five teams at the top of the leader board, sailors will need to bring everything they have for the Medal Race if they want to join the Croatian sailors on the podium.\n\nFinn\n\nGreat Britain’s Giles Scott has all but won gold in the Finn following an eighth and a tenth. The Briton has a 19 point lead over Vasilij Zbogar (SLO) and simply needs to complete the Medal Race to take another World Cup gold.\n\nThe two race wins of the day went to ISAF Sailing World Cup Final winner Zbogar proving that the conditions on the water suited his racing style. With a strong performance Zbogar has climbed up into second place for the first time in the regatta, relegating Ed Wright (GBR) into third.\n\nSlightly further down the fleet, Saturday’s races provided many ups and downs for the sailors. The only other sailors to achieve a two top ten results were the fifth placed Milan Vujasinovic (CRO) and Andrew Murdoch (NZL), who narrowly missed a place in the Medal Race ending the regatta in 11th place.\n\nRacing is scheduled to commence at 11:15 local time on Sunday 26 April where the medals will be decided.\n\nThe new ISAF Sailing World Cup format of 40 boats per fleet is stirring up exceptional competition in Hyères following another day of ups, downs and unpredictability.\n\nClose, tactical racing with minimal separations across the ten Olympic and two Paralympic has excited the world’s top sailing athletes with Saturday’s fleet racing to decide the positions for Sunday’s live Medal Races.\n\nLight, shifty breeze was present across the five race courses and racing got underway in a variable breeze between 3-8 knots.\n\nFinn\n\nIt was another day of up and downs in the Finn fleet with only the leader Giles Scott (GBR) demonstrating consistency.\n\nScott posted an eighth and a fourth which extends his lead over British rival Ed Wright. Scott is 14 points clear of Wright and another day of dominance could seal the deal for Scott and extend his winning run. No other sailor was able to string together two top ten results on the day.\n\nThe opening bout went the way of c (USA) as he explained, “I had a great start and worked my way over to the right side. I had some great pressure over there and connected with it, I had the legs from there and it was pretty easy after that.”\n\nEasy, for a world class athlete and Olympic hopeful. Getting an edge has proved difficult in such a highly competitive fleet and Paine explained what’s required to achieve such results, “You have to look for the small opportunity that’s there and sort of look around at the race course and judge what may happen later on in the race.\n\n“It’s like predicting the future and only when you get it right you get a result like that.\n\n“There are a lot of great guys especially when it’s really compact and with only 40 boats it’s really tight competition. I like it and I like the format and I’m looking forward to seeing how it continues.”\n\nPaine’s start in the second bout didn’t quite match his opening race but he battled back to finish 21st, “You win some, you lose and that’s sail boat racing,” concluded the American.\n\nAt the end of the day Paine sits eighth overall.\n\nGreece’s Ioannis Mitakis took the second race victory and currently occupies the final Medal Race position with fleet two races remaining.\n\nWomen’s 470\n\nFrom six Women’s 470 races, five teams have taken race victories. Fernanda Oliveira and Ana Barbachan (BRA) picked up their second of the week on the third day and lead by one point. For Switzerland’s Linda Fahrni and Maja Siegenthaler, Friday’s racing saw them pick up their first to move up to seventh overall.\n\nThe Swiss pair enjoyed the day and followed up with a ninth to bolster their chances. After racing Fahrni said, “Yesterday was not a good day for us, it just wasn’t working. The day before was okay but today was okay. We’ve had some ups and downs.\n\n“In the first race we had a great start and we were going to the left and got first at the upwind mark and we kept it until the end. It was our wind today. In Switzerland we only have these winds. We are specialists and we are superfast, we really liked it.”\n\nAt the front of the pack are Brazil’s Oliveira and Barbachan, winners of the 2013 edition in Hyères, who are just one point ahead of Anne Haeger and Briana Provancha (USA).\n\nThey opened with a 13th and concluded the day with a bullet to hold the lead and Oliveira was pleased with her day of work, “We were fast in the light winds so it was a very good day for us. We are happy and we still have two races to go before the Medal Race tomorrow but we are happy to be here again and we are trying to do our best.”\n\nThe Women’s 470 is packed full of some of the world’s most technically gifted female sailors. Anything can change in an instant with mistakes duly punished as Oliveira added, “The level of the fleet is very high and it’s difficult for everybody. If you look at the results in the 470 women you will see that it is very up and down, up and down.\n\n“You have to try and do your best all the time, never give up. Each point that you gain is vital. At some point in time, you will need that extra point.”\n\nCamille Lecointre and Helene Defrance (FRA) were the winners on the day posting a 2-4 scoreline. They are four points off the leaders in third.\n\nMen’s 470\n\nThere was some fighting between 470 leaders Sime Fantela and Igor Marenic (CRO) and Gabrio Zandona and Andrea Trani (ITA) which resulted in some mixed results for both teams.\n\nThe Croatians opened their day with a fifth with the Italians posting a third but the second race of the day worked in the Italians favour as Fantela explained, “We had a fight with Gabrio on the pin end of the start and we touched the pin end boat.\n\n“We had to do a 360 and at that moment we were at least 30 metres behind the whole fleet,” emphasised Fantela. “We started in the last position, fighting, fighting, fighting back.”\n\nThe Italians worked their way through the fleet, moving up and down, eventually finishing in 14th but things did not quite go the Croatians way as Fantela continued, “We managed to climb up to 20-25 in the first downwind and then in the second upwind we were so slow and we had to check the centreboard and we had a bag on it. We went down again and managed a good final downwind to climb up to 25th.\n\n“It is a bad result but at least it’s not 40. Until now it was good. We didn’t use up our discard until that race.”\n\nThe Croatians lead on 19 points. The Italians follow on 30 points with Jordi Xammar and Joan Herp (ESP) third on 34 points.\n\nEven though Fantela and Marenic lead by 11 points they are under no illusion that the job is done and will go back to basics for the penultimate day on Saturday, “We will enter tomorrow like it’s the first day. We’ll forget about the last three days. We’ll try to do our best and see what happens.\n\n“Then we will calculate for the Medal Race. You can win and lose a lot from tomorrow’s two races so we won’t think about the boats around us. We’ll stay relaxed, motivated and calm. Then we’ll see how it works.”\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nTonci Stipanovic (CRO) reduced Tom Burton’s (AUS) lead in the Laser and has his sights firmly set on him with two fleet races remaining.\n\nThe Croatian’s 3-8 pulls him to within five points of the Australian after he notched up an 11-5 and he has a plan for the penultimate day of racing, “I will try to sail the first race the best I can and finish in the top three and if possible, try and win it.\n\n“After that, if everything is between me and him [Burton] I will maybe try and to go on him because he’s discarding 31 and I’m discarding just eight. I think I’m in a good position but we’ll have to wait for the first race tomorrow.”\n\nBurton leads on 23 points followed by Stipanovic on 28. Nicholas Heiner (NED) is firmly in contention in third on 32 points.\n\nRacing in the Laser has been about making gains when and where possible. Making big gains on Friday was Italy’s Giovanni Coccoluto.\n\nThe young Italian had posted a 32-23-37-(40) in advance of Friday’s but hit top form, fighting up the pack taking a 13-4. “I sailed very badly over the last two days so I knew I needed to change something,” commented Coccoluto. “I took some more risks and they paid off. I know I could have sailed better but compared to the last two days it’s a good one for me.\n\n“I took more risks at the start, starting at one end and it was a good choice.\n\n“I just thought about sailing fast and taking good shifts but I made mistakes today. It was better than the other days so it’s okay.”\n\nIn the Laser Radial, Evi Van Acker (BEL) edged ahead of Anne-Marie Rindom (DEN) following a 7-2 compared to the Danes 12-3.\n\nVan Acker tops the leader board on 19 points with Rindom second on 25 points. Gintare Scheidt (LTU) is third.\n\nThe eighth placed Marit Bouwmeester (NED) and fourth placed Josefin Olsson (SWE) secured the day’s victories.\n\nNacra 17\n\nTowards the end of the day in Hyères the wind began to die which resulted in only a single race for the Nacra 17 fleet.\n\nPuerto Rico’s experienced multihull specialist Enrique Figueroa and Franchesca Valdes Ortega took the race win in the challenging light breeze by just three seconds over Darren Bundock and Nina Curtis (AUS).\n\nThe result lifts the Puerto Ricans up to 22nd.\n\nBilly Besson and Marie Riou (FRA) continue to lead the fleet following a 12th. They sit on 28 points followed by Lin Ea Cenholt Christiansen and Christian Peter Lübeck (DEN) on 40 points and Mandy Mulder and Coen de Koning (NED) on 42 points.\n\n49er and 49erFX\n\nIt was another successful day on the water for Ida Marie Nielsen and Marie Olsen (DEN) who remain in the top spot of the 49erFX leader board. However, inching ever closer to the Danes are Lisa Ericson and Hanna Klinga (SWE) in second place after gaining an impressive two bullets and a 30th which they will discard. The Swedish duo claimed second place at last year’s ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi and are firmly on track to claim another podium place in Hyères.\n\nISAF Rolex World Sailors of the Year Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze (BRA) round off the top three places.\n\nPeter Burling and Blair Tuke (NZL) used up their drop score in the 49er by scoring a 20th in the ninth race of the series. Two thirds preceded the 20th and as a result they are 37 points clear of Jonas Warrer and Anders Thomsen (DEN).\n\nThe day’s race wins were secured by Erik Heil and Thomas Ploessel (GER), who are fifth, Nathan Outteridge and Iain Jensen (AUS), who are eighth, and the ninth placed Marcus Hansen and Josh Porebski (NZL).\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nAfter Thursday’s fantastic sailing conditions both the RS:X fleets were met with decidedly less wind on Friday. The change in weather conditions made some sailors perform less well while others thrived in the lighter conditions.\n\nAt the end of the day Lilian De Geus (NED) still holds on to the top spot after gaining a 13-11-8 scorecard, leaving her 17 points clear of Jiahui Wu (CHN) who is in second place on 62 points.\n\nRace wins in the Women’s RS:X fleet were snapped up by Manjia Zheng (CHN), Laura Linares (ITA) and Charline Picon (FRA) who, after an impressive performance on the water ends the day in fifth place.\n\nIn the Men’s RS:X the race for a place in the live Medal Races is firmly on. After a morning postponement the fleet went on to complete three races in winds averaging 7-8 knots.\n\nFirst place at the end of day three is occupied by Pierre Le Coq (FRA). Le Coq, who has claimed a succession of top ten places at previous ISAF Sailing World Cup regattas, put on a stunning performance to claim two race wins and a third. Still close behind him in second is Nimrod Mashiah (ISR) while fellow Israeli sailor Shahar Zubari took the other race win of the day.\n\nWith conditions set to be slightly better on Saturday and just 11 points separating first and tenth place it’s still all to play for. All the Men’s RS:X racers will have to fight hard on the penultimate day to secure their spot in Sunday’s Medal Races.\n\nParalympic Events\n\nDespite the lighter conditions on the course, the battle for the top spot still continues in the 2.4mR class who managed to complete two races to keep the fleet on schedule.\n\nAfter dropping one place on day two Bjørnar Erikstad was back on top form and ends the day in first place at the top of the leader board leaving him ever closer to his second consecutive ISAF Sailing World Cup gold medal following his victory in Miami.\n\nDamien Seguin (FRA) is in second place having scored the first bullet of the day. Seguin will discard his 13th place result and ends the penultimate day of racing a mere two points behind Erikstad.\n\nMaking her debut in the top three this week is Helena Lucas (GBR) who posted a 2-6 score line.\n\nMatthew Bugg (AUS) also had a successful day on the water and went on to claim first place in the final race on Friday meaning he will go on to the final day of racing in seventh place overall.\n\nIn the Sonar, France’s Bruno Jourdern, Eric Flageul and Nicolas Vimont-Vicary were on incredible form claiming both of the day’s wins, firmly proving that the lighter conditions suited their sailing style.\n\nAfter a third and a discard of sixth place Colin Harrison, Jonathan Harris and Russell Boaden (AUS) slipped down into third overall.\n\nWith the final day of fleet racing scheduled for Saturday it will be down to the wire to see which sailors claim a spot in the Medal Race for their chance to win a share of the €72,000 prize pot and a place at the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi in November.\n\nThe biggest smile of the day at ISAF Sailing World Cup Hyères belonged to Poland’s Maja Dziarnowska after she picked up three straight race wins in the Women’s RS:X.\n\nWhen asked about how she dominated the day, Dziarnowska commented, “there is no mercy”. With the new ISAF Sailing World Cup format exciting the sailors competing in the French Riviera, no mercy can be shown if they want to end up on top and the Polish racer demonstrated that perfectly well.\n\nA strong breeze, which built to around 16 knots, filled all five courses consistently throughout the day allowing sailors to truly put all their skills to the test.\n\nThe leader boards are starting to take shape across the ten Olympic and two Paralympic disciplines in Hyères ahead of the Medal Races on Sunday 26 April where a share of the €72,000 prize fund, ISAF Sailing World Cup Final spots and World Cup glory are on offer.\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nMaja Dziarnowska (POL) was beaming with smiles after Women’s RS:X racing having dominated the day taking a trio of victories.\n\nAfter racing the Polish racer said, “Compared to yesterday when I finished 29th overall, today was good. I had a lot of fun, good speed, I didn’t make many mistakes and that explains my success.\n\n“There is no mercy,” she smiled.\n\nDziarnowska’s performance has pushed her up from the middle of the pack to third overall. Lilian De Geus (NED) holds the lead on 13 points after a 2-4-4 day followed by Isobel Hamilton (GBR) on 22 points and Dziarnowska on 31.\n\nDespite De Geus holding a steady lead the day belonged to Dziarnowska who revels in Hyères when the breeze is in, “I really enjoy staying in Hyères because we spend a lot of time training here every year. We spend all of April here so I know this place quite well. The wind shifts, the waves and so on. It’s helping.\n\n“This place this year only has 40 women starting and they’re the top 40 in the world so it makes the competition really hard. The smallest mistake costs you hugely and you can lose a lot of places.”\n\nThe world’s best Women’s windsurfers are racing in Hyères and anticipation was high in the build-up as Dziarnowska concluded, “The format is super exciting. I was waiting for the start of this event for a long time, I couldn’t wait. Just to see the progression of myself and the other girls, it’s been really exciting.\n\n“I’m enjoying what I do, I enjoy the training, I enjoy staying with my team. We’re called Energa Sailing Team. We’re cool people and then being with all the women here, I love this lifestyle.”\n\nThere were ups and downs across the Men’s RS:X fleet as the competition ramped up a notch.\n\nByron Kokkalanis (GRE) started the day exceedingly well by taking the opening race victory as he explained, “I made some good choices sailing upwind and jumped up three places. I was ahead rounding the top mark on the second lap and then I just had to chase the Israeli guy [Nimrod Mashiah] and I slid past him at the start of the slalom.”\n\nKokkalanis struggled in the remaining races posting a 12th and a 23rd, he continued, “I got hit bad at the start in the middle race and I was nearly last so I had to come back but in the last race, something felt really bad. I just couldn’t keep up.\n\n“The conditions changed and the wind picked up more so maybe it was my technique or something with my equipment that I didn’t tune properly so all these things need to be fixed.”\n\nThe Greek racer ends the day eighth overall.\n\nIsrael’s Nimrod Mashiah was the star of the day. Double seconds and a race win catapult the Israeli up into second, one point off leader Piotr Myszka (POL).\n\nJust eight points separate first to seventh place in the Men’s RS:X after six races. Six more fleet races follow with the potential for further ups and downs ahead of Sunday’s Medal Races.\n\nNacra 17\n\nIt was a busy day for the Nacra 17 fleet. Four races in a good breeze ensured some tired faces back ashore after racing.\n\nTired, yet full of enthusiasm after racing was Billy Besson and Marie Riou (FRA). The dynamic French duo started the day with back to back victories. A 12th and a third followed which hands them a handy 14 point lead.\n\n“We’re happy because that is a good day for us,” commented a Riou after racing.\n\nThe Nacra 17 fleet is of the highest calibre. Olympic medallists and World Champions make up the highly competitive fleet. Maintaining a clear head is key as Riou explained, “You have to always keep the focus on your job. You can lose distance and places quickly in this fleet.\n\n“It’s really tough to sail at this event but really good to sail in a fleet of 40 good teams. The format is good for sailing because for spectators they can follow and understand our sport, it’s better than ever before.”\n\nLin Ea Cenholt Christiansen and Christian Peter Lübeck (DEN) occupy second overall on 30 points with overnight leaders Jason Waterhouse and Lisa Darmanin (AUS) third on 36 points.\n\nFinn\n\nIt was a day for the Great Britain’s Giles Scott and Ed Wright. The pair sailed consistently well throughout the two races to land them in first and second place respectively at the end of day two.\n\nScott is well on track to add another podium finish to his already impressive succession of first places he has collected over the last 12 months.\n\nThe stronger winds provided the ideal conditions on the water for all of the fleet making the competition for first place even harder. A race win was also claimed by Tapio Nirkko (FIN) who is tenth overall.\n\n49er and 49erFX\n\nIda Marie Nielsen and Marie Olsen (DEN) solidified their spot at the top of the 49erFX leaderboard. The Danes 6-1-6 scorelines sees them atop of the pack on 17 points.\n\nTamara Echegoyen and Berta Betanzos (ESP) follow on 32 points with Jena Hansen and Katja Salskov-Iversen (DEN) third on 35 points.\n\nNielsen and Olsen have proven themselves in the light flukey Hyères breeze that was present on the opening day as well as the consistent breeze on day two. Time will tell if they can continue their good form to take home gold, a share of the €72,000 prize pot and a spot on the startline at the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi.\n\nPeter Burling and Blair Tuke (NZL) asserted their dominance once again in Hyères with a 1-1-2 giving the duo a clear lead ahead of Jonas Warrer and Anders Thomsen (DEN) in second place.\n\nThis is the first ISAF Sailing World Cup regatta for Burling and Tuke in 2015 and half way through the regatta they are well on the way to continuing their unbroken record of regatta victories.\n\nNathan Outteridge and Iain Jensen (AUS) also enjoyed a strong day on the water, recording three top fifteen results. They sit in third and still have the opportunity to build on their current success over the next three days.\n\nThere was some top quality racing throughout the entire fleet and Erik Heil and Thomas Ploessel (GER) claimed a first in the last race of the day.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nIt is tight at the top in the Laser Radial with Anne-Marie Rindom (DEN) and Evi Van Acker (BEL) locked on ten points apiece.\n\nBoth competitors put their hard opening day behind them to bounce back nicely. Rindom discarded her 24th from day one and added a sixth and a bullet to count ten points. Van Acker scored a 4-2 on the second day, losing her 17th, to share the lead with Rindom.\n\nThe day’s opening race win went the way of 2013 Laser Radial World Champion Tina Mihelic (CRO). The Croatian is 27th at the moment but has the skills and drive to work her way up the leaderboard with four more fleet races remaining ahead of the Medal Race.\n\nIt was a similar scenario in the Laser. Tom Burton (AUS) and Nicholas Heiner (NED) discarded their opening day 33rd and 24th respectively to sit in first and second overall.\n\nBurton was in fine form, taking a third and second to take the lead on seven points. For Heiner, his 4-5 on the day is enough for second. Tonci Stipanovic (CRO) is three points off the Dutchman.\n\nRace victories were picked up by Julio Alsogaray (ARG) who is 19th and Kristian Ruth (NOR). Ruth enjoyed a terrific day taking a fifth alongside his bullet and he moves up to eighth.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nFollowing on from Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark’s (GBR) second place success at ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami and, with only four races left until the Medal Race, they top the Women’s 470 leaderboard by the narrowest of margins.\n\nThe day provided the perfect conditions for Mills and Clark who started the brilliantly by gaining a first place and an 18th which the pair have discarded. Mills and Clark have no time to relax however, as the fight for the top three places are extremely close.\n\nRounding off the top three behind the Brits is Anne Haeger and Briana Provancha (USA) in second and Jo Aleh and Polly Powrie (NZL) in third.\n\nThe Men’s 470 took to the water this morning and, after two more races Croatian pair Sime Fantela and Igor Marenic end the day in first place five points clear of Gabrio Zandonã and Andrea Trani (ITA) in second.\n\nRace wins on the day went to Luke Patience and Elliot Willis (GBR) and Stuart Mcnay and David Hughes (USA) who are sixth overall.\n\nParalympic Events\n\nIn the Sonar, Colin Harrison, Jonathan Harris and Russell Boaden (AUS) remain at the top of the scoreboard after achieving a second and a third place which the team have discarded. However, the Australian team cannot afford to relax just yet as, hot on their heels and only one point behind are Bruno Jourdern, Eric Flageul and Nicolas Vimont-Vicary (FRA) who achieved a bullet in the second race of the day to land them in second place overall.\n\nThursday is set to be another interesting day on the water for the class as only one point separates second and third place from the top spot.\n\nIn the 2.4mR class, Damien Seguin (FRA) had a fantastic day on the water and showed that the stronger conditions suited his style. Seguin gained a second and first place in the two races knocking Bjørnar Erikstad off the top spot and relegating him into second place.\n\nSeguin is no stranger to this event after claiming second place at last year’s ISAF Sailing World Cup Hyeres and with only four races left to go before the medal race, is well on his way to gaining another place on the podium.\n\nMegan Pascoe (GBR) rounds off the top three sailors in third place. While a race win also went to Lasse Klötzing (GER) who finished the day in seventh place.\n\nRacing resumes on Friday 24 April at 11:00 local time when sailors will continue to compete for a place on the podium and a chance to claim their share of the €72,000 prize money on Sunday 26 April.\n\nWhat could be sweeter than to wrap an Olympic-style event with a medal guaranteed before the Medal Race even starts?\n\nAt ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami, there’s an answer for that. Having the gold medal itself wrapped up, and extending an 18-month winning streak.\n\nDo the math. In the Finn class, Giles Scott has 23 points. Ivan Kljakovic Gaspic has 46. Scott could finish 10th out of ten qualifiers in Saturday’s Medal Race, with his closest competitor in first, and still win with points in his pocket.\n\nThere have been 599 boats racing on Biscayne these last five days. Scott’s Finn, GBR 11, is not the only one guaranteed to finish in a gold medal position tomorrow. Nacra 17 team Vittorio Bissaro and Silvia Sicouri (ITA), Women’s RS:X dominator Bryony Shaw (GBR) and the breakaway 49erFX Kiwis, Alex Maloney and Molly Meech (NZL) join him with gold in the bag.\n\nSeven of ten Olympic classes completed at least one race on Friday in winds varying from killing light to dead calm. Days like that are a trial for race officials too—and then there was Yuseila Gonzalez Luis, who fought red tape and time and frustration to be the first Cuban sailor racing under the Cuban flag on Biscayne Bay since long before she was born. The morning began with a cascade of troubles and stumbling blocks, but Gonzalez was suited up and on the water in time to start the only RS:X windsurfing race of the day. She didn’t finish, but she was there. Some victories have to be measured on a personal scale.\n\nThe good news for Friday. The wind is coming back.\n\nWomen’s RS:X\n\nAcross 13 fleet races Bryony Shaw (GBR) finished out of the top five just once, resulting in an early defence of her ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami title.\n\nShaw has been dominant across the week, mustering such consistency that has been lacking from many sailors score lines in the ten Olympic and three Paralympic events on show in Miami. Shaw is 33 points clear of Lilian de Geus (NED) and a further 14 ahead of Flavia Tartaglini (ITA).\n\n“It’s a great start to the year,” commented Shaw. “Miami has had a really high quality fleet here. It’s been very popular, with the new World Cup format and it was a target event for me. I wanted to start the year on a high.\n\n“We’ve had 30 knot gusts down to some marginal and then today was 5 or 6 knots. It was a range of conditions this week and that really played to my strengths. My downwinds have been exceptional this week. I’ve made some big gains and some big comebacks so I am really pleased.”\n\nShaw’s victory qualifies her to the 2015 ISAF Sailing World Cup Final set to be held in Abu Dhabi, UAE from 27 October to 1 November. After winning the inaugural edition at the back end of 2014, Shaw likes where the World Cup is heading, “It’s a change for the scene, but it’s a change for the better so we’ll always get some world class racing.\n\n“The World Cup series, I really want to do well in it, it’s a focus for me. The fact that winning here in Miami qualifies me for the World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi is great, it’s the focus for sailing now.\n\n“It’s going to be great to have the elite of the sport racing, being the key focus.”\n\nSilver and bronze is yet to be decided. Hayley Chan (HKG) and Olga Maslivets (RUS) are two points off Tartaglini so it’s all on the Medal Race.\n\nMen’s RS:X\n\nDorian van Rijsselberge (NED) is ten points better off than Thomas Goyard (FRA) heading into the Men’s RS:X Medal Race.\n\nThe Dutchman has been his relaxed yet internally focused self in Miami and is primed for victory if he finishes in the top five.\n\nFor Goyard, his performance has come as a bit of a surprise for him. Not for vigilant observers, however, who have seen fervent improvements in Goyard across the last 12 months that resulted in a bronze at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds.\n\nHe holds a good points margin over the fourth placed sailor and bronze is guaranteed, but he is poised to improve on that, “It’s been a really good week for me. I did not expect to be in second but it is a really good result for me,” commented Goyard. “The wind was crazy today. Tricky and shifty. It was tough racing and still, really interesting.\n\n“Everybody has a lot of points currently, even the leader. It’s not usual but it’s been a good regatta.”\n\nThe next ISAF Sailing World Cup regatta is a significant one for the French RS:X team, not only because it’s a World Cup regatta as Goyard explained, “The World Cup in Hyères will be really important because it’s part of the selection process for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. It’s important to do good results all throughout the year.”\n\nFor now Goyard is concentrating fully on solidifying silver and potentially overthrowing the Dutchman but he’ll have to keep a close eye on Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) who trails him by three.\n\nLaser\n\nNick Thompson of Great Britain is in a lay-up for gold or silver, and so is Philipp Buhl of Germany, only one point behind. Either of them could place 10th in Saturday’s double-points contest and still lead third-place Matthew Wearn of Australia, if only by a squeaker.\n\nWearn has more to play for. Brazil’s formidable five-time Olympic medalist, Robert Scheidt, is 13 points back. Add one more point, and there is New Zealander Andy Maloney. The odds favor Wearn for bronze. But.\n\nWearn was smarting from his results in the Friday races. A 16th and a 30th meant that he has to keep the 20th place finish in race six that used to be his throwout. That was the context as he said, speaking for a lot of people, probably “It was extremely tricky racing. You think you’re doing well and then the next minute you’re not.\n\n“Usually you go to a regatta and it’s all about boat speed,” he said. “This week was definitely about being smart as well as getting to the right place quickly. Mentally, it’s one of the hardest regattas I’ve ever done.”\n\nLaser Radial\n\nThis Medal Race will be one to watch. Marit Bouwmeester, NED, Anne-Marie Rindom, DEN, and Evi Van Acker, BEL, in that order are separated by only three points.\n\nWith such a tight threesome, Van Acker said, “It’s going to be an interesting day.”\n\nThe only other Radial sailor with a mathematical chance at a medal is Paige Railey, USA. If she can win the race, she can beat any or all of the top three—if their day turns into a bottom of the pack nightmare.\n\nRailey, a Florida native, called this week of sailing in extremely shifty and unstable winds “probably the most difficult conditions I’ve seen in ten years of sailing here.” With the breeze dropping out of the teens to single digits on Friday, it was close to gruesome, and only a fraction of the scheduled races were completed—and only one Radial race.\n\n“We set up expecting to start in one set of conditions,” Railey said, “and then the race started and we found ourselves in something completely different. All through that race, if you weren’t on the right end of the shift, you couldn’t get to the next one.”\n\nWomen’s 470\n\nWhat can you say about a race day with no racing?\n\nJo Aleh and Polly Powrie of New Zealand were the Olympic gold medal winners at the 2012 Games, They’ve been solid since, and they have a handy lead now. Today, that lead did not grow, or shrink.\n\n“We went out and waited for breeze,” Aleh said. “It looked promising a couple of times, and then it didn’t. But the race committee has done a good job through the week, and I think they were right today to not send us off in a race that would have turned into a lottery.”\n\nOnly the 2012 silver medalists, Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark, could take the gold medal spot away from Aleh and Powrie, and then, given a 19-point difference, only if the Kiwis stumble badly in a way that they just have not done yet.\n\nThe battle for bronze? There are six boats within a 10-point range.\n\nMen’s 470\n\nLuke Patience and Elliott Willis of Great Britain are in a position very much like that of the Women’s 470 leaders. Like them, they drifted around for a long day with no result but time lost. They too have a nice lead. They’re ahead by 15 points, and second place is the only team with a shot at them. It could happen, but it would buck the trend. Again, it’s all about the color of the medal.\n\nThat second-place team would be Australians Mat Belcher and Will Ryan, who have a 13-point lead over third and a 15-point lead over fourth. In a dream scenario for those two boats, a nightmare scenario for Belcher and Ryan, they could knock the Kiwis out of silver, or even out of the medals.\n\nSo let’s give them names.\n\nOnan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera of Spain are in third, two points ahead of a pair of New Zealanders, Paul Snow-Hansen and Daniel Wilcox, with another points gap behind them.\n\nA striking fact about the ten boats in the Men’s 470 fleet: Ten countries are represented. In order: Great Britain, New Zealand, Spain, New Zealand Sweden, Greece, South Africa, Russia, France, Japan.\n\nFinn\n\nThe story of a gold medal for Britain’s Giles Scott is already written, even if the story of the Medals Race is not.\n\nAnd the battle for silver and bronze will be hot.\n\nIvan Kljakovic Gaspic of Croatia lifted himself from fourth to second on Friday. “It was not so nice a day for sailing, but it was nice for me,” he said. Gaspic now has 46 points to 47 points for Ioannic Mitakis of Greece. The podium spots are their battle, with only Jake Lilley to watch out for. This rising star is another 11 points back after having his worst day of the week, but still potentially a threat.\n\nIt’s remarkable that the Finn class, identified in Olympic-speak as Men’s Heavy, completed two races. A morning start helped. From a booming 7-8 knots at the start of the first race, the breeze dropped to 3-4 knots by the end of the second.\n\nFrom the Department of Useless Facts: Each race took 1:06 to go to completion.\n\nTarget time, 50 minutes.\n\nNacra 17\n\nA professional penultimate day performance from Vittorio Bissaro and Silvia Sicouri (ITA) ensure they go into the Medal Race with gold in the bag.\n\nThe defending champions ventured into Miami with one aim, to defend their title. Hard graft had been done over the first four days of the regatta, leaving them in a handy position going into the penultimate day.\n\nBissaro and Sicouri notched up a 2-1 whilst their nearest rivals, Ben Saxton and Nicola Groves (GBR) missed their opportunity to hold on, only managing a ninth and a discarded 21. The Italians ended the day with an unassailable 26 point lead to take the title once again.\n\nSaxton and Groves have a 17 point advantage over Gemma Jones and Jason Saunders (NZL). Not untouchable by any means but Jones and Saunders will more likely have their eyes on Mandy Mulder and Coen de Koning (NED) and Billy Besson and Marie Riou (FRA) who are within striking distance of the final podium spot.\n\n49erFX\n\nConsistent days have been few and far between for the 49erFX fleet. No one has truly grasped the Miami race track and after 15 fleet races, every team counts a triple digit net score.\n\nA 110 point net score isn’t usually one which wins regattas, but for Alex Maloney and Molly Meech (NZL) it has proven to be, surprisingly.\n\nThey hold an unassailable 50 point lead heading into the Medal Race but will no doubt want to finish strong after a 10-10-20 score line on the penultimate day.\n\nThere have been 14 race winners across the five day, 15 race series. Only the Kiwis have picked up a duo of wins. A sign showing that when you read the Miami racing area well, it pays dividends and when you do not, you flounder.\n\nNonetheless, lessons will be taken away from Miami on the journey to the 2015 ISAF Sailing World Cup Final, which the Kiwis qualify for as event winners.\n\nAlthough gold is settled, the battle for silver is an intriguing one with one point separating Giulia Conti and Francesca Clapcich (ITA) and Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze (BRA). Jena Hansen and Katja Salskov-Iversen (DEN) are 12 points off the podium and in with a shout.\n\n49er\n\nNo racing was possible in the 49er with the light breeze playing havoc. The overnight results stand and Nico Delle Karth and Nikolaus Resch (AUT) will take a one point lead over Joel Turner and Iain Jensen (AUS) into the Medal Race.\n\nSpanish brothers Carlos and Anton Paz are 14 points off the leaderboard with John Pink and Stuart Bithell (GBR) two points off of them and Jonas Warrer and Anders Thomsen (DEN) three off.\n\nIn all likelihood, it’ll be a duel between the top two with the Spaniards fending off the medal chasers.\n\nParalympic Events\n\nThe Paralympic events came to a light wind conclusion in Miami with no racing possible.\n\nResults from overnight stand with the medals confirmed.\n\nNorway’s Bjornar Erikstad claimed only his second ISAF Sailing World Cup gold medal in Miami, remaining in control across the seven 2.4mR races. Erikstad’s rivals were either inconsistent or picked up penalties that affected their scores.\n\nMegan Pascoe (GBR) and Allan Leibel (CAN) were on the course side in what turned out to be the final race of the regatta the day prior. Discarding that score ensured they counted their next big score, thus promoting Erikstad and leaving them in silver and bronze medal position respectively.\n\nDan Fitzgibbon and Liesl Tesch (AUS) made it two ISAF Sailing World Cup SKUD18 victories in a row in Miami. The pair won the Melbourne edition in December and facing new foes, they claimed another scalp.\n\nAlexandra Rickham and Niki Birrell (GBR) take silver whilst bronze goes to Marco Gualandris and Marta Zanetti (ITA).\n\nA double bullet penultimate day advanced Aleksander Wang-Hansen, Per Eugen Kristiansen and Marie Solberg (NOR) to the top of the leader board. With no racing on the final day, those victories proved crucial as they took Miami gold for the fourth time.\n\nAlphonsus Doerr, Brad Kendell and Hugh Freund (USA) pick up silver whilst Paul Tingley, Logan Campbell and Scott Lutes (CAN) take bronze.\n\nRacing is scheduled to commence at 11:00 local time on Saturday 31 January as the Medal Races bring the regatta to a close.\n\nOne measure of the success of Olympic class racing on Biscayne Bay is the steadily growing participation. The numbers in 2015—599 boats from 63 countries—make this a record turnout. But make that 64 countries. Add Cuba to the list.\n\nAt the ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami, presented by Sunbrella, Cuba’s Yuseily Gonzalez Luis is coming in late (obviously) with no hope of qualifying for the Medal Races on Saturday. Even so, she wants to bring her RS:X windsurfer to the start line, if only for a day, to put her punctuation on the thaw in international relations. And see some friends on the water. And in a small way, make history.\n\nLuis is likely to find single-digit winds on the course on Friday, down from the teens on Thursday. Once again, the racecourse was built out of shifts, whichever one of six racing areas you might have in mind. Once again, everyone struggled, but a few people turned in the kind of results that don’t show it.\n\nAnd then there was Bjornar Erikstad in the 2.mR, who learned anew the virtues of being “OSS.” On Start Side. When both of your nearest competitors are OCS. Over early at the start. Suddenly the longtime campaigner from Nøtterøy, Norway is sitting in first with 21 points in his pocket.\n\nIt’s lonely at the top.\n\nLaser\n\nBritain’s Nick Thompson, who says that his favorite boat is the foiling Moth, is doing nicely here in a Laser, in contact with the surface of the water. The former youth world champion leads the 106-boat fleet with an eight-point margin going into the final day of racing ahead of Saturday’s double points Medal Race. In second place, Philipp Buhl of Germany has burned his throw-out race on a 34th, so he has more to lose than Thompson (a 12th to throw out) if the wheels fall off on Friday. Behind them are serious threats still within range, depending, and it remains a difficult racecourse.\n\nYoung Andy (“Pain is temporary; glory is forever”) Maloney of New Zealand has had his moments of late. He won the Palma version of this event in 2013, and in 2012 was second at Hyeres. As race day five beckons, he is seventh in the standings and found Thursday’s conditions not quite as challenging as the races on Wednesday. “They moved the Thursday start into the morning,” he said. “By comparison it seems to get a lot more patchy in the afternoon, as things heat up.”\n\nThe second race of the day was ripe to be abandoned, and it was. “Between races, we were seeing 40 degree shifts with pressure drops to 5 knots,” Maloney said, “and then pressure building to 15 knots and back to 5. They got a start off, and a massive lefty came down with heaps of pressure. It was a lay to the weather mark, so that race was abandoned, and we waited around for a bit. I think they were hoping it would stabilize, but finally they set up at an average angle and got on with it. There were lots of little shifts, but the thing was to be sure you were in phase with the big ones. When it’s that tricky, nobody can get everything right.”\n\nMaloney won a race on Monday. Today he went 7-11.\n\nLaser Radial\n\nDenmark’s Anne-Marie Rindon had the lowest finishes of the top three Radial sailors today, but that didn’t knock her off the top of the leaderboard. An 11-14 day means that she is now eating an 11th and discarding the 14th. Previously, a 7th was her discard.\n\nThe day’s results tightened things up, with second and third both in striking range.\n\nEvi Van Acker of Belgium is only five points back. Marit Bouwmeester is only two points behind that.\n\nThis sets up some interesting running-math problems for the Medals Race on Saturday.\n\nThe hard-luck story of the day was Annalise Murphy from Ireland, who was part of this conversation until she picked up a keeper 35th in race eight. “It was hard to know where you had to be,” she said, and left it at that.\n\nNacra 17\n\nVittorio Bissaro and Silvia Sicouri (ITA) held firm in the Nacra 17 to maintain their lead over Ben Saxton and Nicola Groves (GBR) and Billy Besson and Marie Riou (FRA).\n\nThe Italians celebrated their first ISAF Sailing World Cup gold medal in Miami 12 months ago and returned with the one aim – to defend.\n\nThey are on track to achieve their goal and were full of smiles after racing, “We are happy because it’s been a very tricky week,” commented Bissaro. “We’ve been consistent in most races and that’s why we’re still leading. There are three races and a Medal Race left so we don’t want to lose our good mood and we’ll look to stay consistent until the end of the World Cup.”\n\nSicouri added, “We won our first ISAF event here last year. We want to do the same again this year. This event is very important because the Olympic Games are in just one and a half years. This Miami fleet is very strong and everybody wants to beat everybody so from now on each race is going to be very important.”\n\nTwo points clear of Saxton and Groves, the job is far from a given. Three vital races remain and then it’s down to Saturday’s deciding Medal Race.\n\n49erFX\n\nAlex Maloney and Molly Meech (NZL) hold a mammoth 56 point lead in the 49erFX. It’s still mathematically possible for them to lose their lead – but it’s hard to bet against the 2013 World Champions losing such an advantage.\n\nBelow the breakaway Kiwis, there’s a real ding dong battle forming for the remaining podium positions. Nine points separate second to sixth. Charlotte Dobson and Sophie Ainsworth (GBR) sit second whilst Giulia Conti and Francesca Clapcich (ITA) occupy third.\n\nThe Italians finished runners up at the 2014 edition and are battling for a medal once again. Conti and Clapcich were first ashore after racing – helped by being the first across the finish line in the final race of the day. A fourth and a seventh preceded their bullet which won them the day and Conti was in a buoyant mood after racing, “Miami is nice and warm, it’s good and it was to escape a European winter,” she joked.\n\n“We had a very good day with a fourth, a seventh and that first. That bullet was a good way to end the day. We’re enjoying the sun and Miami is always very good racing.”\n\nThree further races will be decide the Medal Race places, in which a real dogfight will be on the cards if the points remain similar at this stage on Friday.\n\n49er\n\nIt’s a good old fashion game of snakes and ladders in the 49er with a new leader at the end of the fourth day.\n\nNico Delle Karth and Nikolaus Resch (AUT) were the only team to finish in the top ten three times in a row. A 7-8-2 has enabled them to advance to the leading position.\n\nAustralia’s Joel Turner and Iain Jensen are just one point behind the Austrians, in contention, waiting patiently to pounce. Spanish brothers Carlos and Anton Paz are in third, 14 points off the top.\n\nEarly leaders Diego Botin and Iago Lopez (ESP) have dropped further down the leader board following another day at the back of the pack.\n\n470 Women\n\nThe rich got richer in the Women’s 470 fleet, where the familiar series leaders had a 1-3 day to further tighten their grip on first. That would be the 2012 Olympic gold medalists from New Zealand, Jo Aleh and Polly Powrie, who are sitting on the enviable scoreline of 2-2-1-(7)-1-1-3. Pressure outweighed direction shifts, in Powrie’s thinking, but shifts were nothing to ignore, Aleh said, “Get both right and you were really looking good.\n\n“There was a lot of close racing,” Aleh said. “We had downwind legs where the whole fleet was right there.”\n\nHannah Mills and Saskia Clark of Great Britain, silver medalists at the 2012 Games, are 13 points back, with a 10-point margin over Sophie Weguelin and Eilidh McIntire. Also from the UK, Weguelin and McIntire have the Japanese duo of Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka breathing down their necks.\n\nNon-athletes need not apply. Trapeze boats make extreme demands in changeable conditions, with the sailors trimming sails and, we might say, trimming their body weight in and out for balance in a sort of ongoing emergency triage. Or as Aleh put it, “There was a lot going on out there.”\n\n470 Men\n\nMen’s 470 results echoed Women’s 470 results, with the rich getting richer. In this case, it was 2012 silver medalist Luke Patience and crew Elliot Willis sailing a throw-out 18th and keeping a race eight first.\n\nPatience won his 2012 silver medal with Stuart Bithell, just two weeks after the pair teamed up. The new team of Patience and Willis wrapped up the European 470 Championship in 2014 with races to spare, and this pair from the UK are in form again.\n\nAustralians Mat Belcher and Will Ryan are 9 points back and still in touch. Then it’s an 18-point jump to Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera of Spain.\n\nFinn\n\nOn a 3-1 day, Giles Scott, the Finn class leader who hasn’t lot a regatta in 18 months, doubled his lead. The way he saw the racecourse, he said, “The right was stronger than the left, but there were routes out of the left. It was an oscillating day with bands of pressure, a shift and position day.”\n\nIt was, he said, about “joining up the gusts.”\n\nScott is 18 points ahead of Australian Jake Lilley and 18 points ahead of Ioannis Mitakis of Greece, with one more day of racing before the double-points Medals Race on Saturday.\n\nScott’s fellow Briton, Ed Wright, had a 5-12 day and took it a bit harder. “If I was left,” he said, “it went right. If I was right, it went left. It’s a shame I picked up an RTD [Retired] earlier in the week or I’d be looking good now.”\n\nRace seven started the day and went to Croatia’s Ivan Kljakovic Gaspic, who “got a clear lane after the start and kept on the right hand side. At some moments it didn’t look so nice, but patience paid and I rounded the top mark just ahead of the fleet. On the downwind I got a bit of distance and then just controlled to the finish.”\n\nThe cut to make the top 10 is tight in the Finn fleet, with four boats close on points and another group not to be ruled out.\n\nMen’s RS:X\n\nIt was mixed days all around for the Men’s RS:X fleet with high scores afoot for many of the fleet.\n\nLondon 2012 Olympic gold medallist Dorian van Rijsselberge (NED) grabbed the lead from Thomas Goyard (FRA) in spite of an up and down day. When he was up, he was up – securing an opening race bullet ahead of Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) which was then backed up by a sixth. When he was down, he was down – finishing back in 22nd, which he now discards.\n\nAlthough his day was somewhat back and forth, his competitors experienced similar results, thus leaving the Dutchman with a three point advantage over Goyard. Kokkalanis’ daily string of 2-1-15 leaves him seven points off the top.\n\nItaly’s Daniele Benedetti had something to prove to himself in the final race of the day after he was black flagged and scored over the line in the first two races. Perhaps it was his freshness on a warm Miami day that gave him an advantage but Benedetti grasped the lead early on and never looked back, taking the gun.\n\nBenedetti sits in 12th.\n\nWomen’s RS:X\n\nBryony Shaw (GBR) has solidified her position at the top of the Women’s RS:X leader board, adding another race win to her impressive tally of four. Shaw is 21 points clear of Lilian de Geus (NED) and firmly in control, ready to defend the title she won one year ago.\n\nFlavia Tartaglini (ITA) occupies third overall with Hayley Chan (HKG) two points behind.\n\nParalympic Events\n\nBjornar Erikstad (NOR) is now leading the way in the 2.4mR after his three main rivals were all on the course side in the final race of the day. He leads on 16 points with Megan Pascoe (GBR) second on 17 points.\n\nISAF Sailing World Cup Melbourne winners Dan Fitzgibbon and Liesl Tesch (AUS) remain in the lead in the SKUD18. Alexandra Rickham and Niki Birrell (GBR) are second whilst Marco Gualandris and Marta Zanetti (ITA) are third.\n\nAleksander Wang-Hansen, Per Eugen Kristiansen and Marie Solberg (NOR) grabbed the Sonar lead with both hands after a double bullet day. They are a point clear of Alphonsus Doerr, Brad Kendell and Hugh Freund (USA).\n\nRacing is scheduled to resume at 10:00 on Friday 30 January as the Medal Race places will be decided.\n\nThere’s a world of difference between skiing a long, smooth run and skiing on moguls. Today, forget the waves, it was the breeze on Biscayne Bay that was “moguls.” Shift upon shift upon shift upon shift.\n\nThis is the ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami, presented by Sunbrella, with 599 boats and 768 sailors who were adjusting all day to one thing or another. If it wasn’t the wind direction that was changing, it was the wind speed. Which made it all the more notable that three classes produced back-to-back race winners.\n\nDave Ullman, among many things the 1996 US Rolex Yachtsman of the Year and a three-time 470 world champion, is now coaching U.S. Olympic hopefuls. He was a keen observer of the day’s events. The direction shifts, he said, were coming at “15 to 20 degrees, but more than that it was about velocity-on and velocity-off. Downwind, if you were in the velocity, you could make big gains.\n\n“It was much windier today than the forecast called for,” Ullman said, “but the racecourse is fine. The race officials are doing a good job with some challenging circumstances.\n\n“But, it was cold out there.”\n\nHe wasn’t the only one who said so.\n\nWednesday was the third of six days of racing for ten Olympic classes. Top qualifiers will sail a Medal Race on Saturday. Competitors in three Paralympic classes will conclude their racing on Friday.\n\nMen’s 470\n\nA second win in six races settled Luke Patience and Elliot Willis of Great Britain into a six-point lead in their 44-boat fleet, and they had reason to be glad that race six went as long as it did, and ended when it did. They had boats to pass. And then it was over. Second-place skipper Mat Belcher of Australia observed that Patience and Willis had a good second weather leg, “They went heavily to the right, and that got them around a lot of boats.”\n\nWith four more races scheduled before Saturday’s Medals Race, Patience and Willis have scores of 1-2-(5)-4-3-1 to a count of 5-1-2-(12)-2-7 for Belcher and crew Will Ryan. The six-point delta allows for discarding worst scores. Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis dropped out of their leadership position (two firsts on Tuesday) and now are looking at (25)-4-1-1-8-10 for third place.\n\nFarther down in the lists, Matthias Schmid’s Austrian crewman, Florian Reichsteaedter, like everyone out there in a 470, spent his day balancing on the wire, adjusting in and out with the puffs. “There was no system to it” he said. “Sometimes you had to be on the left. Sometimes you had to be on the right. And it was up and down, up and down all day. Eight knots. Eighteen knots.\n\n“And it was cold out there.”\n\nHis handshake proved that.\n\nAnd we may have already mentioned that. But, to be fair, it was Miami-on-the-water cold. Readers in northern climes, please hold those cards and letters.\n\nWomen’s 470\n\nThe London 2012 gold medalists Jo Aleh and Polly Powrie, aka Team Jolly, tightened their grip on the lead in the Women’s 470 with a pair of firsts, demonstrating that, yes, there must be an answer to the dilemma of a dicey racecourse. “We’re sort of getting used to the wind being up and down and shifty,” Aleh said.\n\nShe offered, “If you can’t pick the right place to be on the racecourse, try to not pick the wrong place. We didn’t always have the best start or the best first leg, but we would keep chipping away and chipping away until we could look around and say, Oh, we’re in front. We’ll take it.”\n\nTeam Jolly, sailing out of Auckland, New Zealand, has placings of 2-2-1-(7)-1-1. The London 2012 silver medalists, Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark of Great Britain, are nine points back at 6-1-(7)-1-3-5.\n\nSophie Weguelin and Eilidh McIntire, also of Great Britain, are in third, another ten points back.\n\n49er\n\nDiego Botin and Iago Lopez’s (ESP) overnight 14 point lead was shattered by a culmination of bad results and tight performances from their rivals.\n\nJohn Pink and Stuart Bithell (GBR) and Joel Turner and Iain Jensen (AUS) kept things together, remaining at the front of the pack and now share the lead on 42 points. But for Botin and Lopez, a U flag penalty, a tenth and an 18th allowed the British and Australian teams to advance, leaving them one point behind.\n\nLast to arrive back on-shore, last to take their sails down and last out of the boat park, Botin and Lopez looked deflated on the slipway. After their bright start they received a thorough debrief from their coach upon conclusion of the third day. All is not lost. They remain in contention; teachings will be applied and tomorrow is another day.\n\nFor Turner and Jensen, their short term partnership, is a one off for Miami with Jensen’s usual helm Nathan Outteridge missing out for personal reasons.\n\n“It’s the first time I’ve sailed the 49er without Nathan for a long time,” said Jensen. “Joel’s doing great and he’s picking some clever shifts out there and we’re doing a lot better than we expected considering we only had three days in the boat together before this.”\n\nRoutine, rhythm and reliability are three buzz words for Outteridge and Jensen. The pair sailed together as teenagers, winning the ISAF Youth Worlds, and a partnership in the 49er was inevitable.\n\nSeven years after forming, three 49er world titles and an Olympic gold medal later, Miami is the first time Jensen has been without his formidable helm in the Men’s Skiff, “If you sail with someone for years, like I have with Nathan, you get stuck in your routine. It’s always the same but if you sail with someone else it forces you to problem solve differently and that’s beneficial for when you go back with the other person.\n\n“The roles are still the same with Joel as with Nathan. There are subtleties with the way he [Turner] sails and the way Nathan steers and approaches things. Neither is right or wrong, it’s just the individual style.”\n\nWhilst the partnership is flourishing in Miami, when teased with the question – reckon you’ll stick with Turner? – Jensen replied, “Joel’s doing an awesome job and I think he’ll be a force in the 49er for years to come, he’s 19-years-old and got a bright future but in the next couple of years I might just stick with what I know.”\n\nOutteridge will be flying in on Thursday, ensuring his crew sticks to what he knows and to enjoy the Miami racing from the coach boat.\n\n49erFX\n\nWhen those around you all discard 41 points from a DNF or a DNC, the odds will always be stacked in your favour. That’s the case for Alex Maloney and Molly Meech (NZL) who have opened up a 25 point lead in the 49erFX.\n\nThe Kiwis were just one of eight teams to complete the single race on the first day and they are reaping the rewards. Their discard is a 21 and they hold a comfortable advantage after nine races.\n\nMartine Grael and Kahena Kunze (BRA) are second overall on 62 points whilst Nina Keijzer and Claire Blom (NED) sit third on 90 points.\n\nMaloney and Meech certainly won’t be resting on their laurels with six fleet races and Saturday’s Medal Race ahead of them but things are certainly going their way.\n\nWomen’s RS:X\n\nTwo wins and a second is a perfect day for some but not for 2014 ISAF Sailing World Cup Final gold medallist Bryony Shaw (GBR).\n\nOn the face of it, the Briton dominated the day but in her words, “It’s strange, it didn’t feel like a perfect day out there. I made a lot of mistakes actually. It was really shifty and puffy and I think it was my awareness, especially on the downwinds that really pulled me through.\n\n“I made a couple of silly calls by going a bit too extreme at the start so I had to make some pretty big comebacks today.”\n\nShaw, the defending champion, is firmly in control. She is 17 points clear of the second placed Olga Maslivets (RUS) and is carrying a superb 2014 conclusion forward into the New Year, “I feel like this [leading in Miami] is momentum from winning in Abu Dhabi at the end of last year and the event we had in Rio. It’s nice to come out here and put on a good show.\n\n“I really feel like 2015 is my year and it’s important for performance. I want to try and be selected for the games and win a medal in Rio, so I need to be performing at that level now.”\n\nMen’s RS:X\n\nConsistency was at a premium for the first day of gold fleet racing in what was an up and down day for all.\n\nOnly the second placed Nick Dempsey (GBR) put together a trio of top ten finishes, 8-8-3, whilst those around him finished out of the top ten at least once.\n\nIt’s still France atop of the leader board, but with a new face lighting the path ahead. Overnight leader Louis Giard (FRA) has dropped to fourth whilst Thomas Goyard (FRA) claimed a 12-4-2 which is enough for a slender one point lead over Dempsey.\n\nDorian Van Rijsselberge (NED) took out the first bullet of the day and is third overall. The remaining victories went the way of Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) who is in seventh and the 14th placed Mattia Camboni (ITA).\n\nLaser\n\nIf others demonstrated that it is possible to win two race back-to-back on a wacky race course, five-time Olympic medalist Robert Scheidt of Brazil demonstrated that the best can stumble. He won his first race of the day, then burned his throw-out race on a 27th.\n\nScheidt’s closest competition, Australian Matthew Wearn, went with him and burned his throw-out on a 20th.\n\nNeither of the two leaders can afford another bad race. Scheidt has a seven-point cushion over Wearn, but Germany’s Philipp Buhl is only one point behind Wearn, and only four points separate him from Julio Alsogaray of Argentina and Nick Thompson of Great Britain.\n\nAt 106 boats in two divisions, the Laser is by far the largest class here and as hard as any when it comes to getting to the top. A few years ago, American Jensen Mctigh was acing it in the Snipe class. Here he’s paying his dues (“I’m probably the youngest person here”) with three-digit standings, but he’s seeing the racecourse as clearly as anyone. McTigh’s take from his end of the Laser fleet, “The shifts were bigger yesterday, but those blew evenly across the course. Today the shifts were smaller, but they never stopped. They never stopped.”\n\nLaser Radial\n\nDenmark’s Anne-Marie Rindom took two bullets today.\n\nAnd, frankly, that ought to be enough said. Difficult. Shifty, Tricky. Challenging. Those are the sort of words used throughout ten Olympic and three Paralympic fleets to describe race day three and — Did we mention, Anne-Marie Rindom took two bullets today. She was 13th at the 2012 Olympics. She was seventh at the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championship in Santander. Maybe something made her mad.\n\nAllowing for a throw-out race apiece, Rindom is now in first with a four-point lead over Annalise Murphy of Ireland and a 12-point lead over the Santander winner from the Netherlands, Marit Bouwmeester.\n\nBouwmeester was the Radial silver medalist at the 2012 Olympics.\n\nMurphy, known for liking a big breeze, took advantage of a big-breeze day at the Worlds in Santander to qualify Ireland for the Laser Radial class in the Rio de Janeiro Olympiad of 2016.\n\nAnd Miami? It’s a long week.\n\nFinn\n\nIt was Ioannis Mitakis day in the Finn fleet on Biscayne Bay today.\n\nMitakis, who represented Greece in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the European Finn Championship the same year—leading the Medal Race start to finish—today took back-to-back firsts.
