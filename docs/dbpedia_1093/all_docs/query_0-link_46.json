        "text": "Samantha Kavky: bsk10@psu.edu In 1995 Martica Sawin and Dickran Tashjian published seminal works on Surrealism in America: Surrealism in Exile and the Beginning of the New York School and A Boatload of Madmen, Surrealism and the American Avant-Garde 1920-1950, respectively. Inspired by these groundbreaking works, the Journal of Surrealism and the Americas continues the investigation into this rich history and its current impact. While previous issues of JSA have explored the intersections of Surrealism and ethnography, photography, Latin America and women, this issue assembles various essays that look at the reception of Surrealism in the U.S. and its continued presence in criticism, art, collecting and anthropology. The critical fate of surrealist visual art in America fluctuates based on the value ascribed to it by critics of contemporary art. Specifically, its mid-century dismissal by Clement Greenberg as retrograde, academic kitsch, condemned it to several decades of irrelevancy...\n\nMy article provides a reading of an unstudied novel by Robert Wong, París D.F. (2015). The protagonist of Wong’s novel, Arturo, is an aspiring poet who attempts to come to grips with an unfulfilling job and an insipid love life after being traumatized by a close confrontation with workplace violence. Thereafter, Arturo begins an existential journey across time and space in hopes of mending his disquieted consciousness. Arturo reevaluates the grim conditions and chance encounters that characterize Mexico City; Wong’s narrative mines liberally from surrealism. I examine the novel in terms of the continued significance of Surrealism in twenty-first century Mexico. What does Wong’s activation of the artistic movement suggest about contemporary literary production? How does Wong’s brand of Surrealism respond to contemporary Latin American and, especially, Mexican socioeconomic realities? What does París D.F. suggest in terms of Surrealism’s purchase in an era characterized by the precariat—a class which confronts the similarly unstable employment conditions of the proletariat—but which lacks the proletariat’s occupational identity? To respond to these inquiries, I explore París D.F.’s engagement with two of Surrealism’s foremost concepts: Andre Breton’s notion of objective chance and George Bataille’s idea of sacrificial eroticism. Ultimately, I read the novel as arguing for Mexico’s intimate relationship with Surrealism, and claim that Wong’s novel underscores Surrealism’s continuing political relevance. I thus build upon scholarship that has situated Surrealism—with its emphasis on chance, fantastical associations of places and names, and an ‘end of history’ hopelessness—as a precursor to postmodernism.\n\nThe book opens with a comprehensive historical overview on the cultural world from the end of the Spanish Civil War throughout Francoism and reveals for the first time the broader intellectual and cultural context of vanguard art considering the special relations and negotiation processes between artist, critics and institutions during a major gap in the historiography of post-war Spanish culture: the late Franco dictatorship (1959-1975). It then analyses in depth the important role that a group of art critics played as theoreticians and peers in key artistic movements from the 1950s onwards. Using their extensive international networks in the midst of the Cold War period, they decisively influenced the aesthetic and cultural debates of their time and very concretely helped shaping a completely new discourse for the avant-garde in Spain."
