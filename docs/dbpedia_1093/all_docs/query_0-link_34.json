So, in 1940 it was created the Departmento de Higiene Industrial, which in 1956 was changed to Instituto de Salud Ocupacional, but it was deactivated in 1994. However, in 2001 it reappeared into the Ministerio de Salud organizational structure with the name of Instituto de Salud Ocupacional \"Alberto Hurtado AbadÃ­a\". Actually, it is the Centro Nacional de Salud Ocupacional y ProtecciÃ³n del Ambiente para la Salud (CENSOPAS), organ of the Instituto Nacional de Salud which continues working in synergy with other institutions and sectors, making research to protect the health of exposed persons (workers and community) to contamination and risks associated with economic activities.\n\nInnovations in graduate public health education: the Instituto Nacional de Salud PÃºblica.\n\nPubMed\n\nValladares, Laura MagaÃ±a; Ãvila, Mauricio HernÃ¡ndez\n\n2015-03-01\n\nDuring the past 10 years, the Instituto Nacional de Salud PÃºblica (National Institute of Public Health) in Mexico has meticulously revised its educational model.

An appropriate quality framework should be established in order to cover all the specific methodology as well as the general aspects of quality management, such as research and development, design, instruction and training, specific documentation, traceability, corrective action, client satisfaction, and the like. Such a framework can be obtained by developing a quality management system (QMS) in accordance with a suitable international standard: ISO 9001:2000. This paper presents the implementation process of the tissue bank QMS at the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares in Mexico. The objective of the paper is to share the experience gained by the tissue bank personnel [radiosterilised tissue bank (BTR)] at the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares (ININ, National Institute of Nuclear Research), during implementation of the ISO 9001:2000 certification process. At present, the quality management system (QMS) of ININ also complies with the Mexican standard NMX-CC-9001:2000. The scope of this QMS is Research, Development and Processing of Biological Tissues Sterilised by Gamma Radiation, among others.\n\n[Strategic planning models at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias MÃ©dicas y NutriciÃ³n Salvador ZubirÃ¡n].\n\nPubMed\n\nVelÃ¡zquez-Pastrana, Ruth\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Instituto Nacional de Ciencias MÃ©dicas y NutriciÃ³n Salvador ZubirÃ¡n (Spanish acronym INCMNSZ) is a third tier healthcare facility operated by the Mexican Ministry of Health, ando ver the years various strategic planning models have been used in its development.

P.; Enriquez, W.; Vasconez, F.; Vaca, M.; Arrais, S.; Viracucha, G.; Bernard, B.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nIn 1988, the Instituto Geofisico (IG) began a permanent surveillance of Ecuadorian volcanoes, and due to activity on Guagua Pichincha, SP seismic stations and EDM control lines were then installed. Later, with the UNDRO and OAS projects, telemetered seismic monitoring was expanded to Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, Cuicocha, Chimborazo, Antisana, Cayambe, Cerro Negro, and Quilotoa volcanoes. In 1992 an agreement with the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Electrificacion strengthened the monitoring of Tungurahua and Cotopaxi volcanoes with real-time SP seismic networks and EDM lines. Thus, background activity levels became established, which was helpful because of the onset of the 1999 eruptive activity at Tungurahua and Guagua Pichincha. These eruptions had a notable impact on BaÃ±os and Quito. Unrest at Cotopaxi volcano was detected in 2001-2002, but waned. In 2002 Reventador began its eruptive period which continues to the present and is closely monitored by the IG. In 2006 permanent seismic BB stations and infrasound sensors were installed at Tungurahua and Cotopaxi under a cooperative program supported by JICA, which allowed us to follow Tungurahua's climatic eruptions of 2006 and subsequent eruptions up to the present. Programs supported by the Ecuadorian Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia and the Secretaria Nacional de Planificacion resulted in further expansion of the IG's monitoring infrastructure. Thermal and video imagery, SO2 emission monitoring, geochemical analyses, continuous GPS and tiltmeters, and micro-barometric surveillance have been incorporated. Sangay, Soche, Ninahuilca, Pululahua, and Fernandina, Cerro Azul, Sierra Negra, and Alcedo in the Galapagos Islands are now monitored in real-time. During this time, international cooperation with universities (Blaise Pascal & Nice-France, U. North Carolina, New Mexico Tech, Uppsala-Sweden, Nagoya, etc.), and research centers (USGS & UNAVCO-USA, IRD-France, NIED-Japan, SGC-Colombia, VAAC, MIROVA) has introduced\n\nInstituto Nacional de Enfermedades NeoplÃ¡sicas: past and present.\n\nPubMed\n\nPinillos, L\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades NeoplÃ¡sicas was established by the government of Peru as an institution for the treatment of cancer patients in 1939; it has existed under different names until the current title was adopted in 1952. Between 1980 and 1987, attendance increased by 70% and a new and larger facility came into use at the beginning of 1988. This institution has national responsibility for cancer prevention, detection, treatment, education, and research and is currently organizing satellite treatment centers in other parts of the country. More than 80% of the medical staff has been trained in the institute's residency program, the majority of whom received additional postgraduate training in the United States and Europe; 90% of the medical staff hold academic appointments in medical schools. In 1952 the Institute became the first hospital in Peru with a formal postgraduate training system for various medical disciplines, including surgical oncology and medical oncology. So far we have trained about 500 surgical oncologists who are working in all parts of Peru. The Maes-Heller Institute for Cancer Research forms part of the National Cancer Institute complex. Research will be directed mainly toward new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, multidisciplinary tumor therapy, and large-scale cancer screening. The Institute focuses on early detection and prevention of cancer and is active in breast self-examination education and antismoking campaigns. It enjoys community support evidenced in the women's organization, Adainen, involved in fundraising; 460 women volunteers give at least 4 hr service per week to the Institute. The Institute has grown from 9,000 patients seen per year in its early days to 215,000 attendances in 1986.\n\n[Krukenberg ovary tumor pathological clinical study of 56 cases in the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (National Cancer Institute)].\n\nPubMed\n\nSÃ¡nchez LihÃ³n, Juvenal\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe report 56 cases of ovary Krukenberg tumor at Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades NeoplAsicas en relation to microscopic diagnosis, primary origin and clinicopathologic correlation.

The co-existence of functional or structural digestive abnormalities is frequently observed among cancer patients; this is a consequence of the tumor growth and of those systemic phenomena related to metabolism, which are affected by the relationship tumor-host specific to anorexia- cachexia. This study aimed at establishing the frequency of anorexia-cachexia, as well as its relationship to GI symptoms in the context of palliative care patients at the Instituto Nacional de CancerologÃ­a, MÃ©xico City. Analytic cross-sectional study including 100 patients diagnosed with late-stage cancer, age range 18-80, and a Karnofsky score > 50, as well as an ECOG <2; patients with a bad general health status were not allowed in the study. After reviewing inclusion and exclusion criteria, participants fulfilled the FAACT questionnaire, as well as the EGS. Patients recruitment was carried out by the Instituto Nacional de CancerologÃ­a. Results and discussion: Results show that 61% (n=61)of the patients had anorexia-cachexia, and 39% (n=39)did not. 56% of the sample participants (n=34) were women, and 44% (n=27) were men. GI symptoms associated with anorexia-cachexia were: nausea (p= 0.0001), vomiting (p=0.004), early satiety (p=0.0005), dysgeusia(p=0.0005) and dysphagia (p=0.001). Anorexia and cachexia are among the most devastating and frequent symptoms in late-stage cancer patients and they are also associated with GI symptoms affecting the physical, psychosocial and existential aspects of the patient's life. Data from this research validate the importance of an early nutrition support in palliative patients so that they can achieve a better quality of life. Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

A revision of the clinical-pathological records indentified and a new reading of the pathology slides of the cases found were performed. 19 EP cases were found, the median age of which was 64 years (range: 37-98). EP was primarily found on male patients (57.9%) and was most commonly located on the foot (21.1%), followed by the head, thorax and thigh (15.8%, respectively). In one case, EP was located on the gluteal region, and showed an unusually invasive behavior and rectal involvement. We conclude that EP is a rather uncommon entity in Peru. Its most common location is on the foot and it affects mostly male patients for the most part.\n\n[Retrospective evaluation of 500 endoscopic cholangiopancreatographies performed at the Instituto Nacional de la NutriciÃ³n \"Salvador Zubiran\"].\n\nPubMed\n\nElizondo, J; Gallo, S; Valdovinos, M A; Paez, R\n\n1989-01-01\n\nWe evaluated 500 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCP) performed on 422 patients during a 5-year period in the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Department, Instituto Nacional de la NutriciÃ³n Salvador ZubirÃ¡n, MÃ©xico, D.F. ERCP combines endoscopic and radiologic techniques in order to obtain high quality opacification of pancreatic and biliary ducts. The rate of success for cannulation was 90%; desired duct opacification was possible in 89%. The most frequent indication for ERCP was to establish the differential diagnosis for jaundice; biliary stones in the common bile duct was the most frequent diagnosis, followed by normal biliary ducts. Pancreatography was normal in 74% of patients. ERCP complications were detected in 5.6%; fever and transient pain was the most common complaint in 1.6%. Mortality attributable to the procedure was 0.8%. From histological corroboration of cases by surgery or postmortem studies, diagnostic sensitivity was 92%, specificity 76%, positive predictive value 96% and a prevalence of 89%. We conclude that ERCP is highly sensitive and specific in diagnosing bilio-pancreatic-duodenal disease. Our results are comparable to other's experiences published throughout the world.\n\n[4 cases of annular pancreas at the Instituto Nacional de la NutriciÃ³n Salvador ZubirÃ¡n].\n\nPubMed\n\nMaroun Marun, C; Uscanga, L; Robles-DÃ­az, G; Campuzano FernÃ¡ndez, M\n\n1992-01-01\n\nAnnular pancreas (AP) is a rare congenital anomaly due to malrotation of the pancreatic ventral yolk. Although it has been described in young and middle age adults it predominates in children. Its clinical picture is that of duodenal obstruction or acute pancreatitis episodes. In this paper we report four cases of AP that were seen at the Instituto Nacional de la Nutricion Salvador Zubiran in Mexico City. Three were females and three were less than twenty years old. In one case the diagnosis was established at birth and the operation done in another hospital. In another patient a diagnosis of pyloric hypertrophy was made and a pyloroplasty was performed. This young man was admitted in our hospital because of abdominal pain and hyperamylasemia. An eighty four year old woman was seen due to abdominal pain, nausea and vomit. In all cases the diagnosis of AP was carried out with radiological studies and confirmed by laparotomy. Surgical procedures consisted of duodenal-duodenal anastomosis in two, sphincteroplasty in one, and gastrojejunoanastomosis in the other. Two patients are asymptomatic, one died in the postoperative period, and one was lost for follow up. These four cases represent all the experience of our institute and correspond to one case in 36,735 admissions.\n\n[The Bernardino Ãlvarez Farm Hospital and Farm School: antecedents to Instituto Nacional de NeurologÃ­a y NeurocirugÃ­a].\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrÃ­guez-de Romo, Ana Cecilia; CastaÃ±eda-LÃ³pez, Gabriela\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBy 1960, MÃ©xico's Manicomio General (General Asylum) could no longer fulfill the functions for which it was created so implementation of the so-called CastaÃ±eda Operation began, an initiative designed to close down and relocate psychiatric patients to other institutions. At that time, Dr. Manuel Velasco-SuÃ¡rez was in charge of the General Direction of Neurology, Mental Health and Rehabilitation, and planned to create the Institute of Neurology on a site he already possessed for its construction. The Asylum was a dependency of the aforementioned Direction and Velasco- SuÃ¡rez decided that some patients at the CastaÃ±eda could be moved to the old hacienda house that stood on that terrain. Thus was born the Bernardino Ãlvarez Farm Hospital. A year later, in 1961, the Farm School for the Weak-Minded, also named Bernardino Ãlvarez was established there as well. This paper examines the history of these two institutions as antecedents to the Instituto Nacional de NeurologÃ­a y NeurocirugÃ­a.\n\n[What patients think of the services of the Instituto Nacional de la NutriciÃ³n \"Salvador ZubirÃ¡n\"].\n\nPubMed\n\nRuiz-GonzÃ¡lez, C; Vargas-VorÃ¡ckovÃ¡, F; Castillo-RenterÃ­a, C; PÃ©rez Pimentel, L; MartÃ­nez Mata, R A\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe quality of care has always been a subject of interest to the Instituto Nacional de la NutriciÃ³n \"Salvador ZubirÃ¡n\", in order to improve its services. This interest led to the present survey which aims to evaluate the patient's global satisfaction and to identify specific problems susceptible of improvement. One hundred and seventy-one patients or relatives attending eight different services of the Institute were interviewed. Opinions about the following aspects were explored by means of service-specific questionnaires: sociodemographic characteristics, satisfaction with care, waiting periods, patient-personnel relationship, hospital environment, food quality, drug availability and costs. Results of the survey show a high level of satisfaction with the services provided, i.e. 33% of the patients considered it good, and 64% excellent. However, and in agreement with other reports, this high level of satisfaction does not necessarily reflect an absence of problems, i.e. long waiting periods, insufficient restrooms, failures in getting information about their health status, and occasional absence of drugs in the pharmacy were identified. Continuation of this kind of surveys in our setting leads not only to the identification of problems, but also to the evaluation of the impact that resulting measures may have on the patient's satisfaction.\n\n[Strategy to strengthen health research capabilities in regional public universities: the role of the Mining Canon and the Instituto Nacional de Salud].\n\nPubMed\n\nRomanÃ­, Franco; Cabezas, CÃ©sar; Espinoza, Manuel; Minaya, Gabriela; Huaripata, JosÃ©; Ureta, Juan Manuel; Yazuda, Myriam; GastaÃ±aga, MarÃ­a del Carmen; Miraval, MarÃ­a Luz; Aparco, Juan Pablo; Anaya, Elizabeth; Castro, JosÃ©; Esquivel, Silvia\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe development of scientific health research requires a sustained and articulated research system that is consistent with the research priorities, as well as both internal and external funding, and availability of competent human resources. The Mining Canon, a constitutional right, has been partly used to foster applied scientific research in public universities (PU). In addition, the National Health Institute (INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE SALUD - INS) is devoted, among others, to promoting, managing and disseminating health research development at a national level. As part of these activities, a technical team was created to provide technical assistance to PU for research development using Mining Canon funds by making local adjustments to research protocols promoted by the INS and assumed by the professors-researchers at the Universities. This article aims at describing the reality of research at Peruvian public universities that have access to Mining Canon funds, as well as to elaborate on the work the INS is carrying out in order to strengthen research capabilities, starting with the development of research proposals that could potentially be funded by the Mining Canon.\n\n[Results of the implementation of three national guidelines for the prevention of HIV vertical transmission in Instituto Nacional Materno Perinatal. Lima, Peru].\n\nPubMed\n\nVelÃ¡squez, Carlos\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA retrospective analysis is performed in three successive periods between the years 1996 and 2009, in order to evaluate the impact of the implementation of three national guidelines for the prevention of the vertical transmission of HIV. 275 births were included in 13 years. Significant statistical differences were found in the percentage of HIV cases in the children exposed to the virus between the three periods: 15% during the period in which only zidovudine (AZT) was administered to the pregnant woman, 6.4% during the second period (administration of AZT to the pregnant woman not fulfilling HAART initiation criteria and HAART to those fulfilling criteria for this treatment), and 4% during the third period in which HAART was applied to all pregnant women with HIV infection. 95% of pregnant women ended their pregnancy by cesarean section and the 100% of children received infant formula. Changes made in national guidelines have produced a positive impact in the decrease of HIV infected children in the Instituto Nacional Materno Perinatal in Peru.\n\nInstituto Nacional de Electrification, Guatemala Load Dispatch Center and Global Communications Center.

Information on clinical manifestations, diagnostic tests, hospitalizations, surgical procedures, prescription medication, and other treatments was collected via medical chart reviews. Uncertain values for costs and frequency of treatments were imputed using bootstrap techniques. The average per-patient pre-hospitalization and hospitalization costs were US$ 257 (95% CI: 185 - 329) and US$ 2,576 (95% CI: 2,244 - 2,908), respectively. Post-hospitalization costs tended to decrease over time, with estimates for the first five years post-hospitalization of US$ 475 (95% CI: 423 - 527), US$ 228 (95% CI: 167 - 288), US$ 157 (95% CI: 111 - 202), US$ 150 (95% CI: 106 - 204), and US$ 91 (95% CI: 27 - 154), respectively. NCC results in a significant economic burden for patients requiring hospitalization, with this burden continuing years post-hospitalization.\n\nBiosafety evaluation of the DNA extraction protocol for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex species, as implemented at the Instituto Nacional de Salud, Colombia.\n\nPubMed\n\nCastro, Claudia; GonzÃ¡lez, Liliana; Rozo, Juan Carlos; Puerto, Gloria; RibÃ³n, Wellman\n\n2009-12-01\n\nManipulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical specimens and cultures represents a risk factor for laboratory personnel. One of the processes that requires high concentrations of microorganisms is DNA extraction for molecular procedures. Pulmonary tuberculosis cases have occurred among professionals in charge of molecular procedures that require manipulation of massive quantities of microorganisms. This has prompted research studies on biosafety aspects of extraction protocols; however, as yet, no consensus has been reached regarding risks associated with the process. The biosafety was evaluated for the DNA extraction protocol of van Soolingen, et al. 2002 by determining M. tuberculosis viability at each process stage. Eight hundred eighty cultures were grown from 220 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates that had been processed through the first three DNA extraction stages. Molecular identifications of positive cultures used a PCR isolation of a fragment of the heat shock protein PRA-hsp65 and examination of its restriction enzyme profile (spoligotyping). Growth was seen in one culture with one of the procedures used. The molecular characterization did not correspond to the initially analyzed isolate, and therefore was deduced to be the product of a cross-contamination. The DNA extraction protocol, as described by van Soolingen, et al. 2002 and as implemented at the Instituto Nacional de Salud, was established to be safe for laboratory personnel as well as for the environment.\n\n[Superficial mycoses: casuistry of the Mycology Department of the Instituto Nacional de Higiene \"Rafael Rangel\", Caracas, Venezuela (2001-2014)].\n\nPubMed\n\nCapote, Ana MarÃ­a; Ferrara, Giuseppe; Panizo, MarÃ­a Mercedes; GarcÃ­a, Nataly; AlarcÃ³n, VÃ­ctor; Reviakina, Vera; Dolande, Maribel\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe superficial mycoses are very common infectious diseases and therefore are a frequent reason for medical consultation. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic frequency of superficial mycoses in the Mycology Department of the Instituto Nacional de Higiene \"Rafael Rangel\" during 14 years (2001-2014). A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed to review the mycological records of patients with presumptive diagnosis of superficial mycosis. Nails, hairs and epidermal scales were the processed samples. The identification of fungi was performed by macro and microscopic observation of colonies and biochemical and physiological tests, as required of the isolated agent. For the investigation of Malassezia spp. only direct examination was performed. Of the 3 228 samples processed, 1 098 (34%) were positive and their distribution according to the etiological agent was: dermatophytes 79.5%; 10.9% yeasts; non-dermatophytes fungi 5.1% and 4.5% Malassezia spp. The most frequently isolated dermatophyte was Trichophyton rubrum Complex (70.1%), followed by T mentagrophytes complex (15.1%), Microsporum canis (9.4%) and Epidermophyton floccosum (4%). The most frequent ringworms Were: Tinea unguium (66.8%), followed by Tineapedis (16.4%) and Tinea capitis (8.1%). Candida parapsilosis complex (37.5%) was the most frequently isolated yeast and Fusarium spp. (53.6%) was the most isolated among non-dermatophyte fungi, followed by Aspergillus spp. (19.6%) and Acremonium spp. (10.7%). The identification of the etiological agent is essential to guide appropriate treatment. This study constitutes an important contribution to the knowledge of the epidemiology of superficial mycoses in our country.\n\n[Clinico-pathological diagnostic agreement among 429 autopsies from the Instituto Nacional de la NutriciÃ³n Salvador ZubirÃ¡n].\n\nPubMed\n\nAngeles-Angeles, A; Quintanilla MartÃ­nez, L; MuÃ±oz FernÃ¡ndez, L; Espinoza VÃ¡zquez, B; VictorÃ­a Peralta, P\n\n1992-01-01\n\nComparison of clinical and autopsy findings of the cases studied between 1984 and 1988, were made at the Department of Pathology of the Instituto Nacional de la Nutricion Salvador Zubiran in Mexico City. The goal was to determine the accuracy of clinical diagnoses. The total number of cases was 429. A decreasing number of autopsies as a function of time was observed. Thus, in 1985, 34.65% of the deaths was autopsied, whereas in 1988, the number dropped to 21.16%, overall mean of 27.31%. In 229 autopsies (53.8%), 353 findings of clinical significance were found; of these, 86 were in the main diagnoses and 267 in the causes of death. There were 171 overdiagnoses with therapeutic implications, 38 in the main diagnoses and 133 in the causes of death. Overdiagnoses and underdiagnoses were most common in infectious diseases, followed by respiratory and digestive diseases, while endocrinologic and rheumatologic diseases had the highest diagnostic concordance. It was also found that the diagnostic accuracy did not improve with time of hospitalization. A brief analyses of the probable causes of the decrease in the number of autopsies is made. It is concluded that, in spite of the great advances in clinical and technological knowledge, the high frequency of disagreements between clinical and anatomical diagnoses, indicate that autopsy continues playing a key role in the quality control of medical practice. This justifies by itself the performance of necropsies.\n\nHome - Instituto Nacional de NormalizaÃÂ§ÃÂ£o e Qualidade\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\n!

The aim of this study was to evaluate surgically treated small bowel tumors and to determine the clinical and pathological characteristics that can have an impact on patient outcome. A retrospective, observational, and descriptive study was carried out. The case records of patients with small bowel tumor that were surgically treated at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias MÃ©dicas y NutriciÃ³n \"Salvador ZubirÃ¡n\" from 1990 to August 2011 were analyzed using the SPSS version 17.0 statistical package. Thirty-eight small bowel tumor patients were found that had been operated on within the time frame studied. Fifteen of them were women (39.50%) and 23 were men (60.50%), and the mean age was 55.6 years. The histologic distribution was 13 adenocarcinomas (34.20%), 10 neuroendocrine tumors (26.30%), 8 sarcomas (21.10%) and 4 lymphomas (10.50%). There was an increase in the incidence of sarcomas and adenocarcinomas, whereas lymphomas and neuroendocrine tumors were evenly distributed. An increase in small bowel tumor incidence in the last few years was observed and adenocarcinoma was the most frequent tumor in the study population. It is important to have a high degree of suspicion for this disease when patients present with symptoms such as gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel obstruction, anemia, and weight loss, because early diagnosis is essential for guaranteeing favorable outcome.

This institute is a reference hospital that provides medical attention to a very high number of adult neurological patients every year (approximately 6,000 new patients per year besides emergency cases). From a total number of 2,041 CNST cases, we found that the most frequent tumors were those affecting the neuroepithelial tissue (32.8 %), followed by tumors of the anterior pituitary gland (26.2 %) and tumors of the meninges and similar tissues (24.1 %). In both, male and female patients the higher frequency of CNST was found in patients whose age ranged from 25 to 44 years, and CNST were slightly more frequent in women than in men. Most of the CNST patients lived in the southern districts of Mexico City, it could be because of the great number of people living in the southern districts of the city, or perhaps due to the presence of certain yet unidentified environmental carcinogenic substance in this area. Since CNST are among the more frequent malignant neoplasms, it is necessary to improve the registration system to include frequency, prevalence, incidence and mortality of these diseases in Mexico, in order to plan health policies like in developed countries.\n\nBiomedical engineering education at Politecnico di Milano: development and recent changes.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaselli, G\n\n2009-05-01\n\nThe biomedical engineering (BME) programme at the Politecnico di Milano (POLIMI) is characterized by a strong interdisciplinary background in a broad range of engineering subjects applied to biology and medicine. Accordingly, the undergraduate level (3 years) provides a general education, which includes mechanics, chemistry and materials, electronics, and information technology both in the context of general engineering and within BME foundations. In contrast, the postgraduate programme (2 years) offers a broad choice of specializations in BME fields in close connection with the BME research activities and laboratories of the campus and with active interchange with the other engineering disciplines. The history of BME development at POLIMI is briefly recalled, together with the characteristics of educational and research work, which is strongly biased by a large polytechnic university with no medical school within the same campus; points of strength and weakness due to this background are discussed. The introduction of a double cycle (undergraduate and postgraduate) according to the Bologna process (2000) and the effects on the programme structure is considered. An early phase in which professional education was emphasized at undergraduate level is recalled, which was followed by the actual revision fostering basic engineering and BME education at the first level while leaving in-depth specialization to postgraduate studies or to on-the-job training.\n\n[Levels of dissatisfaction of external users of the Instituto Nacional de Salud del NiÃ±o (National Institute of Child Health) in Lima, Peru].\n\nPubMed\n\nShimabuku, Roberto; Huicho, Luis; FernÃ¡ndez, Danitza; Nakachi, Graciela; Maldonado, Ruth; Barrientos, Armando\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo determine the changes in the levels of dissatisfaction of the external users of the Instituto Nacional de Salud del NiÃ±o, in Lima, Peru. Observational study based on a software to evaluate surveys completed by health care users (Software de EvaluaciÃ³n de Encuestas de Usuarios en Salud - SEEUS). The population consisted of every person accompanying external users to outpatient visits, inpatient visits or emergency treatment in the years 2008, 2009 and 2010. To calculate the sample size, last year's proportion of users dissatisfied with each service was used, with an estimated error of 5% at a 95% confidence level. A sample of 2051 people was obtained, which revealed a decreasing trend in the levels of dissatisfaction with outpatient visits, and an increased dissatisfaction in the medical capabilities dimension for hospitalization and emergency services. In addition, a dissatisfaction index lower than 0.20 was registered in the medical capabilities dimension for outpatient visits. In contrast, the highest dissatisfaction indexes were registered in the hygiene dimension for 2009 (0.25) and 2010 (0.25), and in the others dimension for emergency services in 2009 (0.25). The dimensions showing an increase in the dissatisfaction index were tangible aspects, hygiene and others for hospitalization and emergency services. On the other hand, the medical capabilities dimension for outpatient visits showed a decrease in the level of dissatisfaction over the evaluated period.\n\n[Four stages in the history of the Centro MÃ©dico Nacional Siglo XXI of the IMSS].\n\nPubMed\n\nFajardo-Ortiz, Guillermo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis document presents four stages in the history of the Centro MÃ©dico Nacional Siglo XXI (Centro MÃ©dico Nacional XXI Century) of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social. The first stage started at the end of the third decade of the twentieth century and ended in 1961, it corresponded to the conception, planning and construction of what was to be the Centro MÃ©dico del Distrito Federal (Centro MÃ©dico of the Distrito Federal) belonging to the SecretarÃ­a de Salubridad y Asistencia (Ministry of Health and Assistance). The second stage began when the Center was acquired by the Institute, then was known like Centro MÃ©dico Nacional (Centro MÃ©dico Nacional ), being put into full operation in 1963, more than twenty-two years later, in 1985, an earthquake virtually ended it, immediately began its reconstruction, finishing the second stage. In 1989 began the third stage, different and new buildings complemented or replaced the structures damaged or destroyed by the earthquake which formed the now Centro MÃ©dico Nacional Siglo XXI (Centro MÃ©dico Nacional XXI Century). In 2004 the fourth stage opened when the four hospitals of the Center were categorized like Unidades MÃ©dicas de Alta Especialidad (High Specialized Medical Units).\n\nGuia para la ensenanza de la Lengua Nacional (segundo ano) (A Guide to the Teaching of the National Language (second year).\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nInstituto Nacional de Pedagogia (Mexico).\n\nThis document is an English-language abstract (approximately 1500 words) of a guide based on the results of experiments conducted by the Instituto Nacional de Pedagogia in its pilot school and other schools in Mexico, D.

To describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular complications hospitalized at the Instituto Nacional de Salud del NiÃ±o. We included patients with HTP hospitalized from January 2012 to June 2013 and that during its evolution progressed with SHP or HTPP. For analysis, they were divided into a first group of patients with liver cirrhosis and a second group with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction. Of 22 patients with HPT 45.5% were male and the age range was between 1 month and 17 years. The etiology in the group of cirrhosis (n=14) was: autoimmune hepatitis (35.7%), cryptogenic cirrhosis (35.7%), inborn error of metabolism (14.3%), chronic viral hepatitis C (7.15%) virus and atresia extra-hepatic bile ducts (7.15%). Pulmonary vascular complications more frequently occurred in patients with liver cirrhosis (1 case of HPS and a case of PPHTN). They most often dyspnea, asthenia, edema, malnutrition, ascites, hypersplenism and gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices was found. Also, they had elevated ALT values, alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin values decreased. In children with pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary vascular complications are rare. In the evaluation of these patients pulse oximetry should be included to detect hypoxemia and ubsequently a Doppler echocardiography and contrast echocardiography necessary. Dueto the finding of systolic pulmonary hypertension it is necessary to perform right heart catheterization.\n\n[Clinical-pathological features and survival in young women with cervical cancer: a retrospective analysis from the instituto nacional de enfermedades neoplÃ¡sicas].\n\nPubMed\n\nRuiz, Rossana; Serrano, Mariana; Ruiz, Eloy F; Mantilla, Raul; Valdivieso, Natalia; Olivera, Mivael; Ãlvarez, Manuel; Mas, Luis; Gomez, Henry L\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo determine the clinical and histological characteristics and prognostic factors of cervical cancer (CC) in young Peruvian patients. Retrospective analysis of patients younger than 35 years old diagnosed with CC between 2008 and 2012 in the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades NeoplÃ¡sicas. 449 patients had epithelial neoplasms. The main histological types were: squamous cell carcinoma (84.9%), adenocarcinoma (11.0%) and adenosquamous carcinoma (2.4%). The average tumor size was 4.98 cm. Anemia (55.7%), elevated creatinine (21.2%) and hydronephrosis (13.8%) were also identified. 82.3% of the patients presented locally advanced disease. Stages IIB (47.4%) and IIIB (25.8%) were the most common. Overall 5-year survival was 59.5% (I, 90.9%; II, 57.5%; III, 42.7% and IV, 13.3%). Elevated creatinine, anemia, tumor size, parametrial involvement and hydronephrosis were factors that affected survival. No significant relation was found between histological type and survival. The presence of anemia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI 95%]: 1.6-4.0) and hydronephrosis (aHR: 1.6; CI 95%: 1.0-4.0) were independently associated with survival; likewise, the parametrial commitment with (aHR: 3.3; CI 95%: 1.5-7.2) or without (aRH: 2.6; CI 95%: 1.3-5.3) extension to the pelvic bone. Cervical cancer in young Peruvians is diagnosed in advanced stages. Overall survival in each stage is similar to the reported in older patients. The importance of conventional prognosis- related factors was confirmed. Anemia was an important independent prognostic factor requiring further investigations.\n\nInflammatory fibroid polyp of the gastrointestinal tract: 10 years of experience at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias MÃ©dicas y NutriciÃ³n Salvador ZubirÃ¡n.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomano-Munive, A F; Barreto-ZuÃ±iga, R; Rumoroso-GarcÃ­a, J A; Ramos-MartÃ­nez, P\n\n2016-01-01\n\nInflammatory fibroid polyp (lFP) is a rare, benign, and solitary neoplasm predominantly located in the gastric antrum and small bowel. Its clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and essentially depend on the location and size of the tumor. Definitive diagnosis is made through histopathology and this pathology has excellent long-term prognosis. To identify the cases of IFP seen at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias MÃ©dicas y NutriciÃ³n Salvador ZubirÃ¡n over a 10-year period. A retrospective, cross-sectional, descriptive, and observational study was conducted that included patients with histopathologic diagnosis of IFP within the time frame of January 2001 and December 2011. Six cases were found and 5/6 (83.3%) of them were women. The median age was 41 years (minimum-maximum range of 19-56 years). The most frequent symptoms were weight loss (n=3), fever (n=2), nausea (n=2), and vomiting (n=2). Three patients presented with iron deficiency anemia and 2 cases with intussusception. The IFPs were located at the following sites: esophagus (n=1), stomach (n=2), small bowel (n=2), and colon (n=1). Treatment was surgical in 5/6 (83.3%) of the patients. IFPs are extremely rare in our population. They usually present with weight loss and iron deficiency anemia and are more frequently located in the stomach and small bowel. This is the largest reported IFP case series in a Mexican population. Copyright Â© 2016 AsociaciÃ³n Mexicana de GastroenterologÃ­a. Publicado por Masson Doyma MÃ©xico S.A.

Thanks to the work and leadership of Benito Coquet, who initiated the building of the National Medical Center in 1961, and the work of two pillars of research, Luis Castelazo and Bernardo SepÃºlveda, the Institute successfully improved scientific research. In the years that followed, the Institute fostered the professionalization of research, the creation of research units in different areas of science, the incorporation of consolidated groups of researchers, the relationship with other institutions, the incorporation to the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, the editing of a journal to expose outside the work done within the Institute, and the formation of a trust to raise funds for financing. Thanks to all that, institutional research strengthened in all lines, and it was placed first, at certain times, at the national level.\n\nInstituto Geografico Nacional of Spain\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nColomer, Francisco; Garcia-Espada, Susana; Gomez-Gonzalez, Jesus; Lopez-Fernandez, Jose Antonio; Santamaria-Gomez, Alvaro; De Vicente, Pablo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis report updates the description of the space geodesy facilities of the Spanish National Geographic Institute (IGN).

Once diagnosed, the therapeutic measures (pharmacologic, endoscopic, and surgical) are conditioned by the specific characteristics of each patient. In Mexico, there are no recorded data on the incidence of the disease and patient characteristics. To determine the main clinical, radiologic, and endoscopic characteristics upon diagnosis of these patients at the Instituto Nacional de PediatrÃ­a within the time frame of January 2001 and December 2011. A cross-sectional, retrolective, descriptive, and observational study was conducted in which all the medical records of the patients with portal hypertension diagnosis were reviewed. There was a greater prevalence of prehepatic etiology (32/52) (61.5%) in the portal hypertension cases reviewed. Males (62.5%) predominated and 11 of the 32 patients were under 4 years of age. The primary reason for medical consultation was upper digestive tract bleeding with anemia (71.9%) and the main pathology was cavernomatous degeneration of the portal vein (65.6%). Splenoportography was carried out on 17 of the 32 patients. A total of 65.5% of the patients received the combination therapy of propranolol and a proton pump inhibitor. Initial endoscopy revealed esophageal varices in 96.9% of the patients, 12 of whom presented with gastroesophageal varices. Congestive gastropathy was found in 75% of the patients. The varices were ligated in 8 cases, sclerotherapy for esophageal varices was carried out in 5 cases (15.6%), and sclerotherapy for gastric varices was performed in 2 patients. Seventeen patients (53.1%) underwent portosystemic diversion: 10 of the procedures employed a mesocaval shunt and 7 a splenorenal shunt. Nine patients (28.1%) underwent total splenectomy. The primary cause of the disease was cavernomatous degeneration of the portal vein; it was predominant in males and the first symptom was variceal bleeding.

We examined four collections: \"AdministraciÃ³n Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud 'Dr. Carlos G. MalbrÃ¡n'\" (ANLIS), \"Instituto Nacional de TecnologÃ­a Agropecuaria, Castelar, Buenos Aires\" (INTA), \"Instituto Argentino de Investigaciones de las Zonas Ãridas\" (IADIZA); and \"FundaciÃ³n FÃ©lix de Azara\" (CFA). Comparison of the original descriptions of these species with the label information revealed the existence of 24 holotypes, 5 lectotypes, 11 syntypes, and 441 paratypes/paralectotypes. Complete information is given for each type, including reference to the original description, label data, and preservation condition.Â\n\nBack Cover: NIH MedlinePlus Salud\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... page please turn Javascript on.

Currently there are 42 specimens of this genus held in the ColecciÃ³n Nacional de Helmintos (CNHE) of the Instituto de BiologÃ­a, Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de Mexico, which previously have been assigned to three species: M. monas Rudolphi, 1819, M. travassosi Pereira & Cuocolo, 1940 and M. leiperi Bhalerao, 1936. Upon reevaluation of these specimens it was determined that 27, could not be assigned to species level and 15 could only be assigned to body type (carli and leiperi) because of the poor conditions of preservation of the material. The remaining 15 specimens were of sufficient quality to be identified to species and were found to represent M. americanum Harwood, 1932, M. danforthi Hoffman, 1935, M. meggitti Bhalerao, 1927, M. cf. americanum Harwood, 1932, and M. cf. danforthi Hoffman, 1935. Neither M. monas nor M. travassosi could be confirmed among these specimens; however, Mesocoelium meggitti (syn. M. travassosi) was confirmed. Mesocoelium danforthi is recorded for the first time in the Mexican collection. The presence of M. cf. gonocephali Singh, 1967 and M. cf. microon Nicoll, 1914 also among the 15 specimens of sufficient quality to be identified to species, needs to be confirmed through collects of new material. Finally, in future studies, we propose to improve the quality of specimens by fixing them considering the modifications to this process proposed herein, and compliment these morphological studies with molecular studies.\n\n[Sociodemographic and clinical characteristic of the population attended in the Instituto TeletÃ³n de Santiago].\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a P, Daniela; San MartÃ­n P, Pamela\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Institutos TeletÃ³n care for 85% of the Chilean child population with neuromusculoskeletal disability, the large percentage concentrating in this population. However, there are no registers that enable a profile to be determined on this population. To determine the profile of patients attending the Instituto TeletÃ³n de Santiago during the year 2012. The sociodemographic characteristics were analyzed from the computerised records of the Instituto TeletÃ³n de Santiago on active patients who were seen during the year 2012. A total of 8,959 patients were seen during the study year in the Instituto TeletÃ³n de Santiago. As regards socioeconomic level, 33.3% were in extreme poverty, 28.7% to low-middle level. The main clinical diagnoses were cerebral palsy and other encephalopathies that also lead to motor disability, and accounted for 55.4% of the cases. As a result of determining this profile, it would be appropriate to encourage the need for a national register of the child population with disability, as well as their particular characteristics in order to make decisions on public policy, as a destination for funds or support programs.

We also want to bring to the reader's attention that the dimensions and impacts on health that IMSS has achieved, throughout its history, have strengthened the citizenship, as well as social sustainability. Also, those impacts have determined the creation and the reinforcement of human capital in MÃ©xico. Throughout this concise balance, all the controversy surrounding the foundation of the Institute is being recalled (the protest in the Mexico City ZÃ³calo, or the attack to an hospital in San Ãngel -a neighborhood located in the Southwest of Mexico City-), as well as the way the IMSS incorporated several words into the vocabulary of Mexicans.

This event caused the earthquake-related largest dead toll in Ecuador (663 fatalities) since 1987 inland event. It provoked also a widespread destruction of houses, hotels, hospitals, affecting economic activities. Damaged was very worthy in the city of Pedernales, one of the nearest localities to the epicenter. Rupture area extended about a 100 km from the southern limit marked by the aftershock area of the 1998, 7.1 Mw earthquake to its northern limit controlled by the Punta Galera-Mompiche seismic zone, which is one of the several elongated swarms oriented perpendicular to the trench that occurred since 2007. Historical accounts of the Ecuador Colombia subduction zone have few mentions of felt earthquakes in the XVIII and XIX century likely related to poor communication and urban settlements in this area. A cycle of noticeable earthquakes began in 1896, including the 1906 8.8 Mw event and three earthquakes with magnitudes larger than 7.7 in the period 1942-1979, that preceded the 2016 earthquake. The Instituto GeofiÃ­sico of the Escuela PolitÃ©cnica Nacional (IGEPN) has been monitoring the coastal area through the National Seismic Network (RENSIG) since 30 years back and recently enhanced through SENASCYT and SENPLADES supported projects. International collaboration from Japanese JICA and French IRD also contributed to expand the network and implement research projects in the area. Nowadays, the RENSIG has 135 seismic stations including 105 broadband and 5 strong motion velocimeters. Processing performed by Seiscomp3 software allows an automatic distribution of seismic parameters. A joint cooperation between IGEPN, the Navy Oceanographic Institute and the National Department for Risk Management is in charge of tsunami monitoring.\n\nPrevention of Acute Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

We reviewed all liver biopsy reports from January 1982 to December 1991. From patient records we obtained the following data: clinical, biochemical, imaging studies and we reviewed the histological material. We correlated clinical, biochemical and histological data. From 2963 biopsies reviewed we obtained 16 cases of NASH. We found a 7:1 female/male ratio. Median age was 30 years and six patients were obese. Eleven patients had concomitant disease (diabetes in seven) and nine were using drugs. All had been studied for biochemical abnormalities and were asymptomatic. Ten patients had hepatomegaly and six splenomegaly. Ultrasound suggested the diagnosis in 50% of the cases. All had steatosis, inflammatory infiltrate, necrosis, fibrosis and Mallory bodies at different stages. One case had cirrhosis on initial biopsy and two developed cirrhosis on follow-up (one and eight years later). We did not find any correlation between clinical, biochemical or imaging characteristics and histological findings. When we compared these findings between obese and non obese patients and primary and secondary NASH we did not find any differences between groups. NASH is infrequent in our institution. The underlying pathogenesis seems to be multifactorial. There is no biochemical-histological correlation. Cirrhosis can develop in some cases.\n\nStrongly Interacting Systems at the Nanoscale\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2006-09-13\n\nResearch Topic : cabo@icmf.inf.cu, caboa@yahoo.comPermanent Institute e mail Instituto de Cibernetica, Matematica y Fisica (ICIMAF) Grupo de Fisica Teorica...Research Topic : LFOA@FAMAF.UNC.EDU.AR 28 September 2005Permanent Institute e mail Universidad Nacional de Cordoba Facultad de Matematica , Astronomia y\n\nTelescopio San Pedro MÃ¡rtir Observatory preliminary design and project approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTeran, Jose; Lee, William H.; Richer, Michael G.; SÃ¡nchez, Beatriz S.; Urdaibay, David; Hill, Derek; Adriaanse, David; Hernandez-Limonchi, Regina\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe Instituto de Astronomia of the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico (UNAM) along with Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica y Electronica, the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory are developing the Telescopio San Pedro MÃ¡rtir (TSPM) project, a 6.5m diameter optical telescope.

Methods The Xingu/UNIFESP Project, in partnership with the Center for Gynecological Disease Prevention, develops programs to prevent cervical cancer. The exploratory, retrospective and descriptive study of cytological and histopathological examinations of young (12-24 years) and elderly (aged 64 and over) women of the Xingu Indigenous Park, between 2005 and 2011. Results There was low occurrence of cytological atypia in the elderly female population, but there were occasional high-grade lesions in the indigenous youth. Conclusion Interrupting screening at the limit age of 64 years, as established by the Ministry of Health and the Instituto Nacional de CÃ¢ncer is justified. However, screening of young women should begin at an earlier age.

The Xingu/UNIFESP Project, in partnership with the Center for Gynecological Disease Prevention, develops programs to prevent cervical cancer. The exploratory, retrospective and descriptive study of cytological and histopathological examinations of young (12-24 years) and elderly (aged 64 and over) women of the Xingu Indigenous Park, between 2005 and 2011. There was low occurrence of cytological atypia in the elderly female population, but there were occasional high-grade lesions in the indigenous youth. Interrupting screening at the limit age of 64 years, as established by the Ministry of Health and the Instituto Nacional de CÃ¢ncer is justified. However, screening of young women should begin at an earlier age.\n\n[Cardiorenal syndrome type 1 in the intensive coronary care unit of the Hospital Nacional Arzobispo Loayza].\n\nPubMed\n\nPreza, Paul M; Hurtado, AbdÃ­as; Armas, Victoria; CÃ¡rcamo, CÃ©sar P\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis study sought to evaluate the incidence of cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) type 1 in a coronary care unit and its association with hospital mortality within 30 days of admission, as well as other epidemiological characteristics. The medical records of all the patients who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of acute heart failure in a 4-year period were reviewed. CRS type 1 was characterized by the presence of acute heart failure and an elevation of serum creatinine â¥0.3mg/dL in comparison to the baseline creatinine calculated by the MDRD75 equation and/or the elevation of â¥50% of the admission serum creatinine within a 48 h period. The incidence of CRS type 1 was 27.87%, 95% CI: 20.13-36.71 (34 of 122). There was a higher frequency of CRS type 1 in those patients who were admitted with the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock (adjusted RR 2.02, 95% CI: 1.20-3.93, p=0.0378) and in those with higher hemoglobin levels (p=0.0412). The CRS type 1 was associated with an increase of 30-day mortality (HR: 4.11, 95% CI: 1.20-14.09, p=0.0244). The incidence of CRS type 1 in the coronary care unit found in our study is similar to those found in foreign studies. The history of stroke and the higher values of hemoglobin were associated with a higher incidence of cardiorenal syndrome type 1. Patients with CRS type 1 had a higher hospital mortality within 30 days of admission. Copyright Â© 2014 Instituto Nacional de CardiologÃ­a Ignacio ChÃ¡vez. Published by Masson Doyma MÃ©xico S.A.

The original Nacional cocoa trees are presently in danger of extinction due to foreign germplasm introductions. In a previous work, a few non-introgressed Nacional types were identified as potential founders of the modern Ecuadorian cocoa population, but so far their origin could not be formally identified. In order to determine the putative centre of origin of Nacional and trace its domestication history, we used 80 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to analyse the relationships between these potential Nacional founders and 169 wild and cultivated cocoa accessions from South and Central America. The highest genetic similarity was observed between the Nacional pool and some wild genotypes from the southern Amazonian region of Ecuador, sampled along the Yacuambi, Nangaritza and Zamora rivers in Zamora Chinchipe province. This result was confirmed by a parentage analysis. Based on our results and on data about pre-Columbian civilization and Spanish colonization history of Ecuador, we determined, for the first time, the possible centre of origin and migration events of the Nacional variety from the Amazonian area until its arrival in the coastal provinces. As large unexplored forest areas still exist in the southern part of the Ecuadorian Amazonian region, our findings could provide clues as to where precious new genetic resources could be collected, and subsequently used to improve the flavour and disease resistance of modern Ecuadorian cocoa varieties.\n\nInsight into the Wild Origin, Migration and Domestication History of the Fine Flavour Nacional Theobroma cacao L.
