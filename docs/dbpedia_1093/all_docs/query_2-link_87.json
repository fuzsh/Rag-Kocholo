        "text": "Gold for host nation’s Garcia at memorable Children’s Championship in Mexico\n\nMexico’s Eugenia Garcia and Ana Sofia Alban claimed individual gold and bronze, while Lebanese rider Issam Haddad took individual silver at the FEI Children’s International Classics Final 2014 which drew to a close at Valle de Bravo, Mexico yesterday.\n\nThese Championships are designed to develop young talent, and the 2014 qualifying series visited 34 venues all around the globe, beginning at Gisborne, New Zealand a year ago and concluding in Delhi, India last November. Divided into gold, silver and bronze tours, it is the gold tour riders only who participate at the world Final where the visitors compete on borrowed horses over courses up to 1.30m in height.\n\nA total of 32 competitors from 13 countries – Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Great Britain, Lebanon, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and Venezuela – lined out this year, and the host venue at Valle de Bravo provided the perfect setting for a great week of sport.\n\nResults accumulated\n\nThe event took place across several days, and included training opportunities, a warm-up competition, two qualifying classes, a Farewell competition and the Final which is open to the top 16 athletes based on results accumulated across two qualifiers and limited to a maximum of eight athletes from the host country.\n\nHost nation athletes are permitted to bring two of their own horses to the event, and draws establish which of the two they will ride. A further draw pairs up the foreign athletes with the remaining horses on offer, but it was the home runners who dominated the two qualifying rounds, filling the first nine places in the opening competition and the top seven spots the following day.\n\nMartina Franco took the early lead with a win in last Wednesday’s first qualifier with Zenith M, pipping the eventual bronze medallist Ana Sofia Alban and Wagner by almost a full second in this speed competition which saw 12 of the 32 starters jump clear.\n\nEugenia Garcia had to settle for seventh spot this time out with Coqueta LA, but the following day the pair reigned supreme ahead of Paulina Escobar riding Quo Libri de Comene while another of the Mexican contingent, Carlos Hank, lined up third. There were 15 into the jump-off here, and 11 produced double-clear performances to underline the quality of the riders taking part.\n\nTeam award\n\nThese first two classes also decided the Team award, and the combined talent of Lebanon’s Issam Haddad (Cilantra), Russia’s Polina Matveeva (Brendo B), and Mexico’s Edgar Gaytan (Uno) and Antonio Abascal (Contino 4) claimed gold ahead of Australia’s Sophia Carlon (Kleiner Ottifant), Chile’s Pamela Buhler (Casquico) and Mexico’s Nicole Meyer (Welverwind) and Karime Perez (Gama Cocu). The winning foursome were outright champions when the only ones to produce a zero score while the silver medallists finished on eight and the bronze medal team of Venezuela’s Constanza Romer (Langeoog), Brazil’s Gabriel Junquiera (Rador) and Mexico’s Carlos Hank (Contigo) and Martina Franco (Zenith) racked up a total of 12.\n\nRussia’s Matveeva made an impression when the highest-placed foreign rider in each of the first two competitions. This year’s Team bronze medallist, Venezuela’s Constanza Romer, won individual gold at the 2013 Championships staged in Brazil.\n\nTop-16 Final\n\nThe course for Saturday’s top-16 Final was challenging with some tricky lines, and riders made mistakes everywhere on the course. Only six managed to jump clear first time out, and Mexico’s Antonia Abascal was unlucky to lose out on a place in the jump-off when collecting a single time fault.\n\nThe six-horse jump-off was a thriller, Issam Haddad from Lebanon setting the target when first to go with Cilantra and piling on the pressure with a fast clear in 37.45 seconds. Australia’s Sophia Carlon was next in with Kleiner Ottifant but, although fault-free, was three seconds slower and when Nicole Meyer (Welverwind) returned with two fences down and fellow-Mexican Ana Sofia Alban (Wagner) was clear but two seconds off the pace the result was still wide open with two still to go.\n\nPaulina Escobar and Quo Libri De Comene looked set to overtake Haddad until hitting the last and then only Eugenia Garcia and Coqueta LS stood between the 13-year-old Lebanese rider and that glittering gold medal. But Garcia made no mistake, steering her horse home in 34.70 to demote Haddad to silver and Alban to bronze.\n\nGreat result\n\n“I had a great result, winning the second qualifier and the Final – I still can’t believe that I won!” said Garcia afterwards. “I started the jump-off with confidence, I owe that to my mental coach Constanza Guerra who has helped me to believe in myself, to have trust and to go into the ring as if I was training at home” added the rider who will turn 14 next month. Talking about her jump-off ride she continued, “my horse Coqueta LS is an expert on tight turns and jumped spectacularly. My tactic for the jump-off was to stay in the planned rhythm and pick up time on the turns without taking too many risks. When I came out of the ring I saw my father crying, he was very proud!” she said.\n\nSilver medallist Issam Haddad commented, “from the first training session I already had a good connection with my horse. In the second qualifier I had an unlucky fault at the last fence and I was a bit angry with myself as I thought I might not be qualified for the Final, but I did qualify and was super happy! I started the jump-off with nothing to lose as I knew I was already placed, but of course I was hoping for a place on the podium. I rode my own round, didn’t take all the risks but wanted to set a good time to put the pressure on the rest as there were a few more to come after me” explained the young man who was accompanied to the Championships by his parents, a family friend and his trainer, Karim Fares, who rides internationally for Lebanon.\n\nAna Sofia Alban, was delighted with her bronze medal. ”It was great!” she said. “I was a bit nervous going into the Final, but a good kind of nervous which made me sharp. The course was not easy, in fact it was pretty tough. I had fun riding the jump-off as the crowd started whistling and cheering me on during my round. My plan was short turns but first of all aiming for a clear round so I didn’t risk it all” she explained.\n\nStyle award\n\nThere was also a Style Award, which went to Belgium’s Thomas Thometschek riding Tambo Negro. “I had so much fun!” Thomas said. I didn’t qualify for the Final but when I heard that there was an award for the most stylish rider I was hoping I had a chance of winning it. My trainer Rik Deraedt was here with me and I have learnt so much from him. I owe my style of riding and eye for the fence all to him” he pointed out.\n\nThe Organising Committee at Valle de Bravo did themselves proud and gave the children an experience they will never forget. Apart from the competitions, a lot of extra activities were organised including go-karting, climbing, archery and zip-lining and the 32 young people all went home having enjoyed themselves thoroughly, made many new friends, demonstrated their talent and learned a great deal.\n\nResult: Gold: Eugenia Garcia MEX (Coqueta LS); Silver: Issam Haddad LIB (Cilantra); Bronze: Ana Sofia Alban MEX (Wagner).\n\nFull results here http://www.fei.org/fei-ch-inter-classics/2014-final\n\nLouise Parkes\n\nMorocco Atlas Lions claim first win of the season against British Lionhearts\n\nA nerve wracking evening in Casablanca resulted in the first World Series of Boxing (WSB) victory of the season for Morocco Atlas Lions as they defeated British Lionhearts 3-2.\n\nThe night began with success for Morocco at Light flyweight (49 kg) when Moroccan National Champion Zouhair El Bekkali won his first WSB contest of the season as he defeated Commonwealth Games bronze medalist Ashley Williams who is now 0-2 in WSB.\n\nMohamed VI Trophy winner Mohamed Hamout also claimed victory for the first time in Season V, with a unanimous points win over Bantamweight (56 kg) Qais Ashfaq who drops to 1-1.\n\nThe Lionhearts began a comeback in match three at Light welterweight (64 kg) when 2-0 Sam Maxwell reacted well from losing the first round by claiming a split decision win against Morocco’s 0-2 Hamza El Barbari.\n\nMiddleweight (75 kg) 2-0 Anthony Fowler then evened up the scoring on the night wide a wide points win over Said Harnouf, leaving everything to play for in the last night of the evening.\n\nA Heavyweight (91 kg) shootout established which Franchise would win the contest, and when Lionhearts fighter 0-2 Ionut-Mirel Jitaru was forced to pull out at the end of the third round due to a shoulder injury, 1-0 Vitalijus Subacius picked up the win for himself, and for Morocco Atlas Lions.\n\nBritish Lionhearts will aim to halt their losing streak next week when they face Algeria Desert Hawks at home, while Morocco Atlas Lions can climb Group A even further if they win away against the still undefeated Ukraine Otamans.\n\nCuba Domadores go 15-0 in Season V with victory over Russian Boxing Team\n\nCuba Domadores maintained their flawless start to Season V of the World Series of Boxing (WSB) as they defeated Russian Boxing Team 5-0 in Havana, to ensure three victories this season, and a trio of whitewash results.\n\nThe Group A leaders began with victory at Light flyweight (49 kg), as Cuba’s 2013 AIBA Junior World Champion Joahnys Oscar Argilagos Perez made it 2-0 this season with a unanimous points win over 2011 European Championships silver medalist 0-1 Belik Galanov of Russia.\n\nBantamweight (56 kg) Olympic champion Robeisy Ramirez then dropped just two rounds en route to his second win of the campaign over former European Junior Champion 0-1 Bakhtovar Nazirov.\n\nThe Cuban win was sealed at Light welterweight (64 kg) as two-time AIBA World Championships silver medalist and Olympic bronze medalist Yasniel Toledo won his seventh WSB match in total, and second of the season against 0-1 Avak Uzlian in dominating fashion.\n\nMiddleweight Arlen Lopez then went 2-0 against WSB veteran 0-1 Maxim Gazizov to display his burgeoning reputation as one of the best in his weight class this season.\n\nThe Heavyweight sensation (91 kg) Erislandy Savon finished the evening by winning his tenth WSB match in a row when he stopped Dmitriy Zaytsev just over two minutes into their contest.\n\nCuba Domadores look to remain perfect next week at home to China Dragons who have yet to win a match this season, while Russian Boxing Team will aim to get back to winning ways at home to Mexico Guerreros.\n\nUnstoppable USA Knockouts maintain winning start to Season V against Caciques Venezuela\n\nThe USA Knockouts continued their dream start to Season V of the World Series of Boxing (WSB) as they defeated Caciques Venezuela 3-2 in Miami.\n\nVenezuela’s new Franchise came into this match full of confidence having beaten Azerbaijan Baku Fires in week two, but ultimately it was the American team who proved victorious, and sit pretty in Group B.\n\nSouth American Light flyweight (49 kg) Yoel Finol won his first WSB match of the season in the first bout of the night, as he won by a tantalisingly close split decision verdict against America’s Nico Hernandez.\n\nBantamweight (56 kg) Knockout Francisco Martinez then evened up the scoring on the night, and secured his second WSB win a row by defeating 0-2 José Vicente Azocar in another split decision contest.\n\nA more decisive verdict was to be found at Light welterweight (64 kg) with American debutant Tra-Kwon Pettis winning on all three scorecards against 0-2 Luis Arcón.\n\nVenezuela regrouped at Middleweight (75 kg) however, with Jose Endry Saavedra Pinto winning his first WSB match as he won another close contest when he faced 1-1 Anthony Campbell.\n\nWith the score 2-2 heading into the final match, American Heavyweight (91 kg) Josh Temple made short work of his clash against Alfonso Flores when his 0-2 Venezuelan opponent was stopped in the third round for the second time this season.\n\nAfter winning their third in a row match, USA Knockouts look for a fourth next week away to Astana Arlans Kazakhstan, while Caciques Venezuela travel to Puerto Rico Hurricanes.\n\nMagical Mexico Guerreros establish second win in succession over Algeria Desert Hawks\n\nMexico Guerreros enjoyed their second World Series of Boxing (WSB) win in a row as they defeated

up the winning evening for Mexico when he stopped the 0-1 Youcef Soltani less than two minutes into their fight.\n\nMexican Bantamweight (56 kg) Brian González also enjoyed a stoppage win in match number two, although this time it took four rounds for him to finish African Boxing Championships gold medalist Khalil Litim.\n\nLight welterweight (64 kg) Raúl Curiel García then sealed the win for Mexico Guerreros, and his second WSB win in a row as he dropped just one round en route to a wide victory over Mohamed Boudiaf.\n\n1-1 Mexican Light heavyweight (81 kg) Misael Uriel Rodríguez Oliva went one better than García as he won every single round against Azzouz Boudia to make it 4-0 on the night.\n\nAlgeria Desert Hawks claimed back a win in the last fight at Heavyweight (91 kg) when Bouziane Houna won on all three scorecards against Daniel Paniagua.\n\nMexico Guerreros are away to Russian Boxing Team next week, while Algeria Desert Hawks look for their first win of the season in London against British Lionhearts.\n\nAstana Arlans Kazakhstan win again and send Azerbaijan Baku Fires to second consecutive loss\n\nOne of the most storied rivalries in the history of World Series of Boxing (WSB) continued in Guba, and Astana Arlans Kazakhstan won their third match in a row of Season V 3-2 away to Season IV runners-up Azerbaijan Baku Fires who have now lost two in a row.\n\nThe night began at Light flyweight (49 kg), where Temirtas Zhussupov, who is competing in his second WSB campaign for Astana Arlans Kazakhstan widely outpointed Rasul Saliyev.\n\nAzerbaijan evened up the scoring in fight number two, as their Bantamweight (56 kg) Magomed Gurbanov continued his winning run with a comfortable win against Nursultan Kochshegulov.\n\nLight welterweight (64 kg) Gaybatulla

second stoppage win of the season.\n\nAzerbaijan Baku Fires will look to shake off their losing run next week at home to Rafako Hussars Poland, while Astana Arlans Kazakhstan host fellow undefeated Franchise USA Knockouts.\n\nItalia Thunder destroy Puerto Rico Hurricanes and enjoy first victory of Season V\n\nPuerto Rico Hurricanes were riding a wave of success coming into their bout with Italia Thunder having won their opening two contests, while the European Franchise had lost both of their first two matches.\n\nThese earlier results established this Group B contest in Palermo, Italy as a must win match for the Thunder, and they finally opened their WSB winning account at the third time of asking with a resounding 5-0 victory.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s two-time Olympic medalist Paddy Barnes is representing Italy this season, and won his second match of Season V at Light flyweight (49 kg) with a wide points win over Puerto Rican Olympian Anthony Ortiz who is now 1-1 in the competition.\n\nOrtiz won the opening round, but Barnes improved and impressed as the fight progressed.\n\nMichael Conlan, a Northern Irish teammate of Barnes and a fellow Olympic medalist picked up

Middleweight (75) as Salvatore Cavallaro won every round against Jeffrey Flaz Guillén, while Italian Heavyweight (91 kg) Endri Spahiu won via walkover due to a medical suspension for Puerto Rico’s Michael Narvaez.\n\nNext week, Italia Thunder look for a second victory a row away against the winless Argentina Condors, while Puerto Rico Hurricanes welcome Caciques Venezuela to San Juan.\n\nRafako Hussars Poland secure first victory of Season V leaving Argentina Condors winless\n\nBoth Rafako Hussars Poland and Argentina Condors entered this World Series of Boxing (WSB) match having failed to win in their first two matches, so something had to give in this Group B fixture.\n\nAfter a strong night of action in Włocławek, the home Polish Franchise reigned supreme, winning every fight with aplomb, and leaving Argentina still without a win this season.\n\nThe evening began at Light flyweight (49 kg) where Dawid Sebastian Jagodzinski won his first contest of the campaign with a wide points win over Argentina’s 1-1 Junior Zarate.\n\nArgentine Bantamweight (56 kg) Ignacio Perrin was unable to compete, so therefore Sylwester Kozlowski picked up a walkover victory.\n\nPoland went 3-0 up and took the match in the third bout, as Light welterweight (64 kg) Damian Kiwior made amends for his first week loss by beating Ronan Nahuel Sanchez 48:47 across the board.\n\nSanchez won two of the first three rounds, but Kiwior was the stronger fighter in the final two frames.\n\nPolish Middleweight (75 kg) Tomasz Jablonski achieved his second WSB fight in a row with a whitewash victory over Christian Zarate.\n\nThe 5-0 scoreline for the home team was assured in the final bout at Heavyweight (91 kg) when Igor Pawel Jakubowski secured his second stoppage in in succession against Elber Santos dos Passos.\n\nRafako Hussars Poland will aim to continue the momentum of this decisive conquest next week when they travel to face Azerbaijan Baku Fires, while Argentina Condors continue their quest for an opening win at home to Italia Thunder.\n\nDujardin and Valegro produce another amazing performance in Amsterdam\n\nby Louise Parkes\n\nGreat Britain’s Charlotte Dujardin and Valegro swept to victory with the greatest of ease at the sixth leg of the Reem Acra FEI World Cup™ Dressage 2014/2015 Western European League series in Amsterdam, The Netherlands today. The 29-year-old rider only returned from New Zealand a few days ago after presenting Masterclasses in Hamilton and Christchurch, and admitted to feeling “seriously jet-lagged”. But such is the exceptional relationship she has with the 13-year-old Valegro that she only fell 0.4 points short of the world-record Freestyle score the pair set at Olympia, London in December when coming out on top by a considerable margin again this afternoon.\n\nToday’s result sheet reflected that of yesterday’s Grand Prix, with exactly the same horse-and-rider combinations filling the top five places. The Netherlands’ Danielle Heijkoop (Siro NOP) filled runner-up spot ahead of Germany’s Jessica von Bredow-Werndl (Unee BB) in third, and Dutch riders Diederik van Silfhout (Arlando) and Hans Peter Minderhoud (Glock’s Flirt) claimed fourth and fifth places. However, despite the quality of the field, Dujardin’s absolute supremacy was unmistakable as her nearest rival finished more than 11 marks behind her winning score of 93.900.\n\nGreat day of sport\n\nThe Amsterdam crowd were treated to a great day of sport, with Germany’s Isabell Werth and El Santo NRW lighting up the arena with a powerful and expressive test that just oozed with fun. When you have a trophy cabinet filled to the brim with Olympic and World Championship gold medals you are entitled to have as much fun as you like, and with her 14-year-old gelding grooving to the sound of David Bowie, the 45-year-old veteran swept into the lead on a mark of 76.775 just before the judging break.\n\nHowever Denmark’s Agnete Kirk Thinggaard, who has rocketed to prominence this season, went out in front as soon as the action resumed when posting 78.050. This pair are exciting to watch, showing great balance and rhythm in passage in particular, and demonstrating tremendous harmony between their music and their floorplan.\n\nTwo rides later however, Dujardin and Valegro set the new target so high that there was never any doubt about the final outcome. The Olympic, European and World champion was smiling even before she began, and Valegro just settled to his job, drumming out that now familiar perfect piaffe and passage and sitting steady and low in canter pirouette as the scores came tumbling in thick and fast. Britain’s Stephen Clarke and Dutch judge Eduard de Wolff van Westerrode each awarded the pair artistic marks of 98.00 while Isabelle Judet from France gave them 96.00, and when their final total of 93.900 went up on the scoreboard it was very definitely a done deal.\n\nConfident performance\n\nHeijkoop wasn’t intimidated however, following with a smooth, confident performance that highlighted her black gelding’s exceptional piaffe for a mark of 82.375. And Germany’s Jessica von Bredow-Werndl, who continues to lead the Western European League standings after today’s leg, once again presented her courageous floorplan that embraces difficult transitions including canter to piaffe/pirouette to walk, for a strong score of 80.900.\n\nPenultimate performer, Diederik van Silfhout with Arlando NH, posted 79.950 for fourth place while fellow-Dutchman, Hans Peter Minderhoud, brought the competition to a close with a calm and elegant test from Glock’s Flirt for fifth spot.\n\nWinning result\n\nDujardin was quick to thank her trainer, friend and mentor, Carl Hester, after today’s winning result. “Carl kept Blueberry (Valegro) ticking over while I was away in New Zealand, I’m always so grateful to him” she said. She wasn’t too pleased with her ride in yesterday’s Grand Prix however, even though she won that by more than a seven-point margin. “I was really jet-lagged and I was terrible, I was so angry with myself for the way I rode!” she insisted this afternoon.\n\nShe talked about what Valegro has been doing since re-setting the Grand Prix and Freestyle world records at Olympia last month. “He had a couple of weeks off over Christmas and then I started riding him for a couple of days before heading off (to New Zealand). But I only had three days to ride after I got back this week, so he’s a pretty amazing horse!” And looking ahead to the Reem Acra FEI World Cup™ Dressage 2014/2015 Final where they will be defending their title she said, “he won’t be doing anything until then. He isn’t the kind of horse that needs competition all the time, so our next outing will be Las Vegas, and after that we’ll be concentrating on getting ready for the European Championships”.\n\nReflected\n\nRunner-up, Danielle Heijkoop, reflected on her performance, saying “we had a bigger score at Mechelen (BEL) in December, but I’m very happy with how we went today”. Talking about her trainer, Anky van Grunsven who is a nine-time winner of the FEI World Cup™ Dressage title, 27-year-old Heijkoop said “we think alike, our attitude is that things can always be better, but for me the most important thing right now is that you can see our score is getting a little higher everywhere from last year, it’s all improving”.\n\nNow riders are already thinking ahead to how their horses will respond to the bright lights and electric atmosphere of the Thomas & Mack Arena in Las Vegas in just over two months’ time. “I’m so excited about it!” said Dujardin today, “I know the crowd starts clapping before the finish, and the place is buzzing all the time, but hopefully Blueberry will be OK with all that and will put on a great show”.\n\nRunner-up, Danielle Heijkoop, says that her gelding, Siro, can be “a little bit crazy” during the prize-giving ceremony and after he comes out of the arena, but that he is usually a thorough professional during his test. “Actually I think he will love it in Las Vegas, when he’s doing a test he really enjoys the crowd, and I hope it won’t be a problem for him”.\n\nThe next leg will take place Neumuenster, Germany on Sunday 15 February 2015.\n\nResult:\n\n1, Valegro (Charlotte Dujardin) GBR 93.900;\n\n2, Siro NOP (Danielle Heijkoop) NED 82.375;\n\n3, Unee BB (Jessica von Bredow-Werndl) GER 80.900;\n\n4, Arlando NH NOP (Diederik van Silfhout) NED 79.950;\n\n5, Glock’s Flirt (Hans Peter Minderhoud) NED 79.250;\n\n6, Jojo Az (Agnete Kirk Thinggaard) DEN 78.050;\n\n7, Favourit (Sonke Rothenberger) GER 77.325;\n\n8, El Santo NRW (Isabell Werth) GER 76.775;\n\n9, Uzzo (Patrick van der Meer) NED 75.725;\n\n10, Axis TSF (Terhi Stegars) 75.675;\n\n11, Ulysses la Haya (Laurens van Lieren) NED 73.950;\n\n12, Biggles 1015 (Kristian von Krusentierna) SWE 73.775;\n\n13, Eres DI (Jeroen Devroe) BEL 73.275;\n\n14, Sunny Boy (Juan Antonio Jimenez Cobo) ESP 73.175;\n\n15, Thriller (Katja Gevers) NED 72.050.\n\nFacts and Figures:\n\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands presented the sixth leg of the Reem Acra FEI World Cup™ Dressage 2014/2015 Western European League today.\n\n15 riders from 8 nations, including six from the host country.\n\nToday’s winners were the defending series champions and World No 1 combination, Charlotte Dujardin and Valegro from Great Britain, who re-set both the Grand Prix and Grand Prix Freestyle world records at the previous fixture at Olympia in London last month.\n\nTheir winning Freestyle score of 93.900 today was just 0.4 percentage points short of the world record they set in London at 94.300.\n\nThe British partnership also won yesterday’s Grand Prix at the Dutch fixture, with a winning mark of 86.140.\n\nToday’s Ground Jury consisted of: At E, Stephen Clarke (GBR), At H, Isabelle Judet (FRA), At C, Eduard de Wolff van Westerrode (NED), At M, Adriaan F. Hamoen (NED), and at B, Peter Engel (GER).\n\nThere are three further qualifying legs left to run in the Reem Acra FEI World Cup™ Dressage 2014/2015 Western European League – at Neumuenster (GER) on 15 February, At Gothenburg, Sweden on 28 February and at ‘s-Hertogenbosch (NED) on 14 March.\n\nThe series Final will take place in Las Vegas, USA from 15-19 April.\n\nQuotes:\n\nCharlotte Dujardin GBR, talking about Valegro: “He was just fantastic today. It’s always such a pleasure to ride him, he’s so great!”\n\nDanielle Heijkoop NED: “My next competition will be at Den Bosch I think, but I have to talk to Anky (van Grunsven) about it first”.\n\nReem Acra FEI World Cup™ Dressage Western European League 2014/2015 – standings after Round 6 at Amsterdam (NED):\n\n1.

Valentina Truppa ITA – 34\n\nWhat could be sweeter than to wrap an Olympic-style event with a medal guaranteed before the Medal Race even starts?\n\nAt ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami, there’s an answer for that. Having the gold medal itself wrapped up, and extending an 18-month winning streak.\n\nDo the math. In the Finn class, Giles Scott has 23 points. Ivan Kljakovic Gaspic has 46. Scott could finish 10th out of ten qualifiers in Saturday’s Medal Race, with his closest competitor in first, and still win with points in his pocket.\n\nThere have been 599 boats racing on Biscayne these last five days. Scott’s Finn, GBR 11, is not the only one guaranteed to finish in a gold medal position tomorrow. Nacra 17 team Vittorio Bissaro and Silvia Sicouri (ITA), Women’s RS:X dominator Bryony Shaw (GBR) and the breakaway 49erFX Kiwis, Alex Maloney and Molly Meech (NZL) join him with gold in the bag.\n\nSeven of ten Olympic classes completed at least one race on Friday in winds varying from killing light to dead calm. Days like that are a trial for race officials too—and then there was Yuseila Gonzalez Luis, who fought red tape and time and frustration to be the first Cuban sailor racing under the Cuban flag on Biscayne Bay since long before she was born. The morning began with a cascade of troubles and stumbling blocks, but Gonzalez was suited up and on the water in time to start the only RS:X windsurfing race of the day. She didn’t finish, but she was there. Some victories have to be measured on a personal scale.\n\nThe good news for Friday. The wind is coming back.\n\nWomen’s RS:X\n\nAcross 13 fleet races Bryony Shaw (GBR) finished out of the top five just once, resulting in an early defence of her ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami title.\n\nShaw has been dominant across the week, mustering such consistency that has been lacking from many sailors score lines in the ten Olympic and three Paralympic events on show in Miami. Shaw is 33 points clear of Lilian de Geus (NED) and a further 14 ahead of Flavia Tartaglini (ITA).\n\n“It’s a great start to the year,” commented Shaw. “Miami has had a really high quality fleet here. It’s been very popular, with the new World Cup format and it was a target event for me. I wanted to start the year on a high.\n\n“We’ve had 30 knot gusts down to some marginal and then today was 5 or 6 knots. It was a range of conditions this week and that really played to my strengths. My downwinds have been exceptional this week. I’ve made some big gains and some big comebacks so I am really pleased.”\n\nShaw’s victory qualifies her to the 2015 ISAF Sailing World Cup Final set to be held in Abu Dhabi, UAE from 27 October to 1 November. After winning the inaugural edition at the back end of 2014, Shaw likes where the World Cup is heading, “It’s a change for the scene, but it’s a change for the better so we’ll always get some world class racing.\n\n“The World Cup series, I really want to do well in it, it’s a focus for me. The fact that winning here in Miami qualifies me for the World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi is great, it’s the focus for sailing now.\n\n“It’s going to be great to have the elite of the sport racing, being the key focus.”\n\nSilver and bronze is yet to be decided. Hayley Chan (HKG) and Olga Maslivets (RUS) are two points off Tartaglini so it’s all on the Medal Race.\n\nMen’s RS:X\n\nDorian van Rijsselberge (NED) is ten points better off than Thomas Goyard (FRA) heading into the Men’s RS:X Medal Race.\n\nThe Dutchman has been his relaxed yet internally focused self in Miami and is primed for victory if he finishes in the top five.\n\nFor Goyard, his performance has come as a bit of a surprise for him. Not for vigilant observers, however, who have seen fervent improvements in Goyard across the last 12 months that resulted in a bronze at the Santander 2014 ISAF Worlds.\n\nHe holds a good points margin over the fourth placed sailor and bronze is guaranteed, but he is poised to improve on that, “It’s been a really good week for me. I did not expect to be in second but it is a really good result for me,” commented Goyard. “The wind was crazy today. Tricky and shifty. It was tough racing and still, really interesting.\n\n“Everybody has a lot of points currently, even the leader. It’s not usual but it’s been a good regatta.”\n\nThe next ISAF Sailing World Cup regatta is a significant one for the French RS:X team, not only because it’s a World Cup regatta as Goyard explained, “The World Cup in Hyères will be really important because it’s part of the selection process for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. It’s important to do good results all throughout the year.”\n\nFor now Goyard is concentrating fully on solidifying silver and potentially overthrowing the Dutchman but he’ll have to keep a close eye on Byron Kokkalanis (GRE) who trails him by three.\n\nLaser\n\nNick Thompson of Great Britain is in a lay-up for gold or silver, and so is Philipp Buhl of Germany, only one point behind. Either of them could place 10th in Saturday’s double-points contest and still lead third-place Matthew Wearn of Australia, if only by a squeaker.\n\nWearn has more to play for. Brazil’s formidable five-time Olympic medalist, Robert Scheidt, is 13 points back. Add one more point, and there is New Zealander Andy Maloney. The odds favor Wearn for bronze. But.\n\nWearn was smarting from his results in the Friday races. A 16th and a 30th meant that he has to keep the 20th place finish in race six that used to be his throwout. That was the context as he said, speaking for a lot of people, probably “It was extremely tricky racing. You think you’re doing well and then the next minute you’re not.\n\n“Usually you go to a regatta and it’s all about boat speed,” he said. “This week was definitely about being smart as well as getting to the right place quickly. Mentally, it’s one of the hardest regattas I’ve ever done.”\n\nLaser Radial\n\nThis Medal Race will be one to watch. Marit Bouwmeester, NED, Anne-Marie Rindom, DEN, and Evi Van Acker, BEL, in that order are separated by only three points.\n\nWith such a tight threesome, Van Acker said, “It’s going to be an interesting day.”\n\nThe only other Radial sailor with a mathematical chance at a medal is Paige Railey, USA. If she can win the race, she can beat any or all of the top three—if their day turns into a bottom of the pack nightmare.\n\nRailey, a Florida native, called this week of sailing in extremely shifty and unstable winds “probably the most difficult conditions I’ve seen in ten years of sailing here.” With the breeze dropping out of the teens to single digits on Friday, it was close to gruesome, and only a fraction of the scheduled races were completed—and only one Radial race.\n\n“We set up expecting to start in one set of conditions,” Railey said, “and then the race started and we found ourselves in something completely different. All through that race, if you weren’t on the right end of the shift, you couldn’t get to the next one.”\n\nWomen’s 470\n\nWhat can you say about a race day with no racing?\n\nJo Aleh and Polly Powrie of New Zealand were the Olympic gold medal winners at the 2012 Games, They’ve been solid since, and they have a handy lead now. Today, that lead did not grow, or shrink.\n\n“We went out and waited for breeze,” Aleh said. “It looked promising a couple of times, and then it didn’t. But the race committee has done a good job through the week, and I think they were right today to not send us off in a race that would have turned into a lottery.”\n\nOnly the 2012 silver medalists, Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark, could take the gold medal spot away from Aleh and Powrie, and then, given a 19-point difference, only if the Kiwis stumble badly in a way that they just have not done yet.\n\nThe battle for bronze? There are six boats within a 10-point range.\n\nMen’s 470\n\nLuke Patience and Elliott Willis of Great Britain are in a position very much like that of the Women’s 470 leaders. Like them, they drifted around for a long day with no result but time lost. They too have a nice lead. They’re ahead by 15 points, and second place is the only team with a shot at them. It could happen, but it would buck the trend. Again, it’s all about the color of the medal.\n\nThat second-place team would be Australians Mat Belcher and Will Ryan, who have a 13-point lead over third and a 15-point lead over fourth. In a dream scenario for those two boats, a nightmare scenario for Belcher and Ryan, they could knock the Kiwis out of silver, or even out of the medals.\n\nSo let’s give them names.\n\nOnan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera of Spain are in third, two points ahead of a pair of New Zealanders, Paul Snow-Hansen and Daniel Wilcox, with another points gap behind them.\n\nA striking fact about the ten boats in the Men’s 470 fleet: Ten countries are represented. In order: Great Britain, New Zealand, Spain, New Zealand Sweden, Greece, South Africa, Russia, France, Japan.\n\nFinn\n\nThe story of a gold medal for Britain’s Giles Scott is already written, even if the story of the Medals Race is not.\n\nAnd the battle for silver and bronze will be hot.\n\nIvan Kljakovic Gaspic of Croatia lifted himself from fourth to second on Friday. “It was not so nice a day for sailing, but it was nice for me,” he said. Gaspic now has 46 points to 47 points for Ioannic Mitakis of Greece. The podium spots are their battle, with only Jake Lilley to watch out for. This rising star is another 11 points back after having his worst day of the week, but still potentially a threat.\n\nIt’s remarkable that the Finn class, identified in Olympic-speak as Men’s Heavy, completed two races. A morning start helped. From a booming 7-8 knots at the start of the first race, the breeze dropped to 3-4 knots by the end of the second.\n\nFrom the Department of Useless Facts: Each race took 1:06 to go to completion.\n\nTarget time, 50 minutes.\n\nNacra 17\n\nA professional penultimate day performance from Vittorio Bissaro and Silvia Sicouri (ITA) ensure they go into the Medal Race with gold in the bag.\n\nThe defending champions ventured into Miami with one aim, to defend their title. Hard graft had been done over the first four days of the regatta, leaving them in a handy position going into the penultimate day.\n\nBissaro and Sicouri notched up a 2-1 whilst their nearest rivals, Ben Saxton and Nicola Groves (GBR) missed their opportunity to hold on, only managing a ninth and a discarded 21. The Italians ended the day with an unassailable 26 point lead to take the title once again.\n\nSaxton and Groves have a 17 point advantage over Gemma Jones and Jason Saunders (NZL). Not untouchable by any means but Jones and Saunders will more likely have their eyes on Mandy Mulder and Coen de Koning (NED) and Billy Besson and Marie Riou (FRA) who are within striking distance of the final podium spot.\n\n49erFX\n\nConsistent days have been few and far between for the 49erFX fleet. No one has truly grasped the Miami race track and after 15 fleet races, every team counts a triple digit net score.\n\nA 110 point net score isn’t usually one which wins regattas, but for Alex Maloney and Molly Meech (NZL) it has proven to be, surprisingly.\n\nThey hold an unassailable 50 point lead heading into the Medal Race but will no doubt want to finish strong after a 10-10-20 score line on the penultimate day.\n\nThere have been 14 race winners across the five day, 15 race series. Only the Kiwis have picked up a duo of wins. A sign showing that when you read the Miami racing area well, it pays dividends and when you do not, you flounder.\n\nNonetheless, lessons will be taken away from Miami on the journey to the 2015 ISAF Sailing World Cup Final, which the Kiwis qualify for as event winners.\n\nAlthough gold is settled, the battle for silver is an intriguing one with one point separating Giulia Conti and Francesca Clapcich (ITA) and Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze (BRA). Jena Hansen and Katja Salskov-Iversen (DEN) are 12 points off the podium and in with a shout.\n\n49er\n\nNo racing was possible in the 49er with the light breeze playing havoc. The overnight results stand and Nico Delle Karth and Nikolaus Resch (AUT) will take a one point lead over Joel Turner and Iain Jensen (AUS) into the Medal Race.\n\nSpanish brothers Carlos and Anton Paz are 14 points off the leaderboard with John Pink and Stuart Bithell (GBR) two points off of them and Jonas Warrer and Anders Thomsen (DEN) three off.\n\nIn all likelihood, it’ll be a duel between the top two with the Spaniards fending off the medal chasers.\n\nParalympic Events\n\nThe Paralympic events came to a light wind conclusion in Miami with no racing possible.\n\nResults from overnight stand with the medals confirmed.\n\nNorway’s Bjornar Erikstad claimed only his second ISAF Sailing World Cup gold medal in Miami, remaining in control across the seven 2.4mR races. Erikstad’s rivals were either inconsistent or picked up penalties that affected their scores.\n\nMegan Pascoe (GBR) and Allan Leibel (CAN) were on the course side in what turned out to be the final race of the regatta the day prior.
