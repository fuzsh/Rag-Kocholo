We had 59 of our classmates and 31 guests. One of the attendees was Joe Swartz. Prince Chuck reports that Joe’s son, Lt. Cmdr. Joe Swartz Jr., is the flight surgeon for the Navy’s Blue Angels. Chuck also reported that our “Red” Mack was inducted into the St. Joseph Valley Football Hall of Fame in South Bend at the same time as two of the Four Horsemen, Harry Stuhldeher and Elmer Layden. “Red” was picked in the 10th round of the 1961 NFL draft by Pittsburgh. He played for the Steelers, the Falcons and the Packers (Super Bowl Champs). I heard from Lee J. Suttner, the Robert Shrock Emeritus Professor, Dept. of Geological Sciences at Indiana U. Lee lost his wife to leukemia on July 7. They celebrated 50 years of marriage the year before. He had kind words for this column and said he has been in Houston several times and wanted to come to Victoria to personally thank me for writing this column and check out Abbie and the latch string. He has written a quasi-book for his 50th anniversary essentially of his and his wife’s life and times and dedicated Chapter 5 to our time at ND. John F. Manion ’56 sent me an article on John Willacker. It seems that since graduation he has spent most of his time out in space. He was a key architect, manager and director for some of the more significant space projects of our years. As former vice-president of space launch operations at the Aerospace Corporation, he oversaw support to Air Force launch programs including Titan II and IV, Delta II, Atlas II plus a number others, most from Cape Canaveral FL and Vandenberg Air Force Base CA. He spent 22 years with McDonnell Douglas, now The Boeing Co. John says the challenge of space was \"amazing, just dazzling.” After retirement he consulted for eight years and then retired to Sun City, Palm Springs CA. Bill Bartlett’s wife, Sandy ’61SMC, filed the Bartlett report. Bill runs a marketing research company and is semiretired. They had five children. A daughter passed away in 1994, and they raised her son. They have seven grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter, 6 months old. They got a reminder of the minireunion from Tom King. John Keegan is still chairman, CEO and president at Edison Innovation Foundation in the greater NYC area. It is a not-for-profit organization that supports the Edison legacy and encourages students to embrace careers in science and technology. Getting back to Prince Chuck’s letter, he reported on the annual gathering in Naples FL. I don’t have room to list the 35 marchers. Bill Henneghan hosted the dinner and 14 attended. He also reported that Father Denis O’Shaughnessy celebrated the blessing of his new church, Mary Mother of God. Jay Gallager, “first-time writer, long time reader,” graduated from Georgetown Law, practiced four years with the IRS, then moved from DC to LA and joined Winthrop Shaw Pittman with McKenna Long & Aldridge Law where he still practices. Tom Cubbage has served as trial and appellate counsel for Phillips Petroleum Co. I have previously told you of his legacy as a military intelligence historian. Tom’s wife passed away June 4; they were married for 54 years. He also advised me of the death of Al Gleason, which he learned from Al’s daughter. I want to thank all of you for your messages of condolence on the death of our son Chris. Abbie and I appreciate your concern and support very much. And that’s the word for the fall issue. Hope all of you are well. Don’t forget to drop by; Abbie has the latch string out for you. — Joseph P. (Pat) Kelly; 2103 N. Wheeler St., Victoria TX 77901; 361-573-9982; jpkellytx@sbcglobal.net\n\n61JD Class Secretary — John N. Moreland;\n\njnmnd1958@aol.com\n\n62 Latest Happenings\n\nDuring a layover in Los Angeles, I had a chance to have dinner with Ron Herm. Ron had gone to St. Xavier in Louisville and graduated from ND in three years as a chemistry major. Asked how he did that, Ron said Emil Hoffman devised an advanced placement exam that he passed, thereby skipping freshman chemistry. He then went on to graduate school, starting out at Cal Berkley but switching to Harvard, where he received a PhD in chemical physics. He did a post doc at the U of Chicago and then taught for 10 years at Cal Berkley and Iowa State. In the mid-1970s he joined The Aerospace Corporation that works primarily with the Air Force on the planning, acquisition and development of space and ground support systems. He is “retired” but he comes into the office a couple of days a week. His one lament is that he took up golf at a late age and, in retrospect, wishes he had stayed at ND for his senior year. Rodger Brown, “Bruno” Ryan, George Anderson, Jim Black, “Duke” Bentley, John Garofalo, Ray Kelly, Walt Kelly, Ron Nahser, Bill Snyder and Bill Weinsheimer got together for their semi-annual lunch in Chicago in July. Expected but missing were Frank Callahan and Rich Jalovec, who lives part of the year in Tucson. Rodger and Bruno are the organizers, and from what I gather, the list of attendees is growing. If you are interested in attending lunches, contact Rodger at crb50@aol.com. Linzie Kramer, who developed a number of cryotherapy centers around the country, says he has been diagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer and has endured massive doses of radiation. “Not much fun for those of you who have been there, but it is what it is,” he said. However, he added that going through the cryotherapy treatment has, “benefited me substantially…while being zapped 563 times.” Tony Bill, who produced the film Flyboys a number of years ago, contributed a piece of history to the AOPA Pilot magazine, saying that the last recorded downing of an enemy plane by a pilot with a hand gun occurred in March 1943, when a Japanese pilot strafed a B-24 crew that had bailed out of their plane (killing two), only to be shot and killed by the American pilot who was descending in his parachute. In the past three months we lost several classmates. John Hughes died on May 4. He had suffered from Parkinson’s disease for many years. Seven weeks later, John’s brother-in-law, Jim Regan passed away on June 27 from heart failure. Bob Latsko died of a heart attack on Memorial Day while on vacation in Vienna. Quin Denvir died on June 4. He was diagnosed four years ago with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease. Quin was most famous for defending the Unabomber. George “Skip” Lane passed away suddenly at his home on June 5. Kenneth Kelly died on June 12. He served in the Marine Corps and then began a career with Sikorsky Aircraft. Richard Boemer passed away on July 4. He was living in the Milwaukee area and had been active with SCORE. In addition, word was received that Bob Taylor died in Tucson on Dec. 19, 2015. Our 55th Reunion will take place June 1-4, 2017. It will not be as elaborate as our 50th, but your class officers will come up with a few things of interest. To that end, please send me your email address if you have left your place of employment or changed it recently. Then you can be included in the latest happenings. — Raymond Raedy; 5310 Rileys Ridge Road, Hillsborough NC 27278; 919-967-8816; nd62secy@medicinemanremedies.com\n\n62JD Class Secretary — Paul K. Rooney;\n\n1209 Oakmont Drive, No. 2, Walnut Creek CA 94595; rooneypaul12@gmail.com\n\n63 Remembering Great Careers\n\nElsa and Tom Pavlik, a retired Cleveland attorney, sponsored Monk Malloy as the keynote speaker at the 100th anniversary celebration of the ND Club of Cleveland. With 260 attendees at the lavish celebration at the Ritz Carlton, Tom notes past auctions have raised more than $900,000 for ND scholarships. Much honored 30-year Air Force Col. Robert B. Irvine died in May in Beckenridge CO. He is survived by wife Debra and five children and grandchildren. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. Rob was one of the writers of the START arms reduction treaty while assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. After Air Force retirement, Rob spent five years as director of counter proliferation in the Defense Department. He retired as a NATO diplomat with a six-year tour in Brussels, as deputy assistant secretary general for weapons of mass destruction policy. Dawn and Buzz (Harry) Gillogly of Westford MA (Rob and Buzz were ND roommates) remember Rob and Debra from the 50th. “We had such fun and have very fond memories of that fantastic event; along with a friendship which lasted over half a century. Rob was godfather to our son James ’88.” John O’Brien says that Jim Bruder of Philadelphia has been ill for some time, and is confined to a nursing home. Father Charlie O’Hara recently visited him and brought him the Eucharist. Please keep him in your prayers. Greg Schwartz of Bloomfield Hills MI celebrated 40 years of Gregory J Schwartz & Co, an investment house with $4 billion under management. The firm, co-founder of Ava Maria Catholic Mutual Funds, is managed by Greg’s five sons. Greg’s St. Pat’s party at his Naples condo included Terry Desmond, Pat O’Brien, Larry Morgan, Pete Jason, Mike Walker, Matt Murphy and Brian Richardson. Apologies to U of Texas distinguished Prof. Bill Kibler, who was referred to in the last column as “Bill Killer.” (I learned that computer autocorrects the spelling of Kibler to read “Killer.”) Father Pat Cawley, who gave the memorable luncheon invocation at our 50th, says he enjoys “retirement and the freedom it offers. I do help out now and then at some parishes and unfortunately preside at far too many funerals. I was wondering what ever happened to Bob Gannon and Mike Joyce.” (Check in, Bob and Mike.) He continues: “Our 50th was a great time. The weekend seemed to fly by. I still make at least one game a year and attend Mass. The liturgies are wonderful and the music makes your spirit soar. Anyone who thinks Mass is boring or dull should go to Notre Dame. I appreciate the wonder and joy of every day.” Retired Vassar Prof. Michael McCarthy’s book on Lonergan (Nov. 2015) received a second-place award in theology from the Catholic Press Association and a bronze medal in an earlier international competition. After 39 years, Walt Banas of Marianna FL finally retired and says, “I can’t understand how I worked so long without taking an afternoon nap. We celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary next March; it is hard to believe, I don’t feel a day over 101.” John Andreoli (john.andreoli@yahoo.com) wants to hear from his freshman roommate, Bob Feehery. John has a Temple MBA and a career in the medical devices, including ventilators for ICU and operating theatre, trach and endotracheal tubes. He retired as senior VP, and says, “It just goes to show how fortunate I was to have God give me a jump shot. My family had no money and I would not have gone to college except through basketball. It makes me sad to see how many college athletes throw away the opportunity that an athletic scholarship gives them. We moved around lots. Now I am retired with houses in coastal Carolina south of Wilmington NC and another in The Villages FL. Even though ND changed my life for the best, I regret I have only been back three times, the last was for our 35th. I looked for the basketball field house and saw the little memorial. I have one of the floor boards and a brick from the old ‘cow pasture.’ I am married, have three children, four grandchildren and am fortunate beyond what any man deserves.” — Regis W. Campfield; 7534 Oakbluff, Dallas TX 75254; 972-239-1141; fax 972-458-6928; rwcampfield@alumni.nd.edu\n\n63JD All the News That’s Fit to Print\n\nTom Brannigan conveyed thoughtful reflection and insight on news of Prof. Kellenberg’s passing in April. His property law class may have been when the reality of law school first sunk in for the recently arrived enthusiastic first year class. As Prof. Kellenberg started taking us carefully through the evolution of property law concepts commencing in medieval times he must have looked down at the blank faces and wondered, “How did these guys get into law school?” Meanwhile, behind the blank faces, were thoughts of, “What have I done?” It all worked out. Tom didn’t mention it, but I did a little checking and found that he has had a distinguished litigation career including arguments before the Illinois Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. He is a recognized authority on property tax law and is of counsel to Smith Hemmesch Burke & Kaczynski in Chicago. Not to be outdone by Maggio writing on Notre Dame football and Matteoni on Sitting Bull, Bob Berry recently completed a book on conflict resolution. Conflict Resolution beneath the Gavel is available through Amazon. Essentially Bob makes the case that, for parties to a dispute, litigation is the least desirable means for resolving the dispute and that existing alternatives to litigation are not much better. He provides numerous very specific recommendations for change in law school education, enactment of new legislation and modification of judicial practices. Collectively the recommendations are intended to create a new culture for conflict resolution designed to deliver results more beneficial to the parties than to their lawyers or insurance companies. The book is not as philosophical as its title would indicate but is a very readable and interesting commentary on real world negotiating strategies for specific situations, often involving insurance companies, under the present system of conflict resolution. I don’t know whether Berry intends the book to serve as his retirement announcement. If not, he may as well wear a short sleeve shirt to his next negotiating session because the tricks of the trade are pretty well laid out in the book. — Bob Saxe; 15725 Ranchero Drive, Morgan Hill CA 95037; 408-779-3668; bsaxe5@aol.com\n\n64 Lots of Minireunions\n\nNavy ROTC alums Tom Bard, Frank Kenny and Joe Mayer gathered at Tom’s place in Portland in May. They forwarded via email pictures of some of the shenanigans. Leon Reymond was a recipient, and is now a correspondent. Leon finished his Navy career working for the Army, married a former SMC girl, Terry Failla, and found himself in law school at LSU. Their three children attended either ND or SMC, meaning a good deal of time and money was spent in South Bend. Leon has completed almost 50 years practicing law, and sees Fred Frey and Chip Carpenter a good bit. Early March saw Ceil and Bob Dunne ambling from Delray Beach to break bread and reminisce with Loretta and John Meyer and Pat and Gino DeAgostino in Naples. Tom Fox got wind of the gathering and made it a fine foursome of 50 Year Club members. I am not sure what the others are doing, but I know that Gene is still practicing law. This keeps him busy when he is not spending time with his family of four children and 14 grandchildren. Marge and Dave Kostolansky recently spent a fun-filled week in Jamaica celebrating GIG Reunion 52. Other attendees included Patty and Jim Baker, Pam and Jack Lonergan, Judy and Carl Massarini and Maryann and Dick Russell. The group (including Jackie and Sal Leccese, who couldn’t make this year’s trip) have been reuniting each year for home and away football games and exciting destination trips ever since the 25th Class Reunion. From PJ Shelley comes news that he joined Della and Mike Yannuzzi at the marriage of Larry Russo’s daughter. By all accounts, it was a wonderful affair. PJ sees Larry several times a year in Connecticut. He catches up with Mike at least once a year at Lead East, a three day doo-wop festival in Parsippany NJ. Would you believe that PJ also has had a doo-wop show for the last five years on WAPJ-FM Radio in Torrington CT? For dedications and shout outs, call 860-489-9033. PJ also writes that after the death of his wife of 46 years, Lois, in January 2013, he reunited with Patricia Pindar, whom he dated in 1963 at Saint Mary’s. They have been going together for three years. John Nelson reports that after 33 years as a legal specialist, part-time judge and volunteer for numerous civic charities, his retirement to the mountains of southwestern Colorado has been most enjoyable. It sounds like it has been well earned, though John still serves on four non-profit boards. George Novak reminded me that Tim Morrison of North Palm Beach passed away last September following an extended illness. We understand that Tim was an entrepreneur in the home improvement industry. Terry Kollman penned a thoughtful note on the passing of his best friend from Notre Dame, Dennis Powers. In mid-April Dennis entered the hospital in Daytona Beach for heart surgery. The operation was successful but there were complications his body could not fight off. Denny had lived in Flushing, Queens, as a young man. He married Angela in 1969. They were approaching 47 years of wedded bliss this fall. Denny spent over 20 years in the NYPD, retiring as lieutenant in the borough of Brooklyn. He then held security technology positions with HBO and Cablevision. Denny and Angela moved to Florida in 2010. They traveled often to Colorado and Hawaii to visit their children. Keep their families in your thoughts and prayers. — Paul R. Charron; 44 Contentment Island Road, Darien CT 06820; 203-655-3930; paul.richard.charron@gmail.com\n\n64JD Fighting the Good Fight\n\nChuck Sweeney’s wife, Georgia, passed away on July 30. Please keep the Sweeney family in your prayers. Gerry Vairo told me that he has developed more issues related to MS and has been in and out of hospitals during the past months. Yet he cheerily says that he feels well, is bouncing back and is fighting the good fight. Bob Frost continues to receive great news that his cancer remains in remission. Charles Sacher had a fabulous trip with family (Charles, Anna, Camilla and CJ) to the American West that was reminiscent of a trip that he and Dorothy took years ago with their three young sons. As a bonus, the tour guide on the San Francisco Bay leg of the excursion was our classmate Tom Connelly, who says that the group had a rare sighting of three whales entering the bay under the Golden Gate Bridge. That was a whale of a story, Tom. I received some good health news from Jack Jiganti as he nears successful completion of his rehab following a triple bypass. He is resuming work in Chicago, primarily as a trustee for a variety of family trusts. Jack Kopko continues his bankruptcy practice in northwestern Indiana. He and Adele have downsized recently by relocating to Ogden Dunes, a beautiful area near the Indiana Dunes. Sharon and I plan to see them this fall at the Law School pregame football parties. Jack Rammel passes along his “hello” from Chicagoland to everyone; Sharon and I planned on having lunch with him and Mary at the Morris Inn in late August. Renaissance Man Frank Miele remains a supernumerary at the NY Met, a physical fitness devotee and an art and gem expert, all while contemplating writing another book and echoing his mantra that “you’re only as old as you think you are.” Carol and Lou Pfeiler greet all from Dubuque, where Lou spearheaded successful completion of a Veterans’ Memorial. Jim Mercurio is doing well in Bethesda and extends his greetings. Hurley Smith is focused on the elections in his role as an election supervisor for Rappahannock County VA. Marian and Jim Slater are excited to plan another trip, this time a lengthy tour of Spain in September and October. JoAnn and Gene Kramer have relocated their residence to high above downtown Cleveland with an outstanding lake view. He continues his practice and is active in the Green Ribbon Coalition, a movement designed to influence lake front development. Russ Bley is well in St. Louis and is the proud papa of a grandson. Sharon and I have enjoyed a wonderful summer in the Midwest, with trips to rural Minnesota and Door County on Lake Michigan, northeast of Green Bay. Blessings to everyone and stay in touch. — Richard Balfe Wagner; 1204 Erskine Manor Hill, South Bend IN 46614; 574-299-9888; cell 760-567-1270; rswagnersb@gmail.com\n\n65 Legacy Fund\n\nHere is a reminder that our Class of 1965 Endowed Scholarship Fund has been renamed the Class of 1965 Legacy Fund. Children and grandchildren of class members who contributed and meet the “demonstrated financial need” requirements should contact the office of financial aid. A list of eligible class members will be on file in that office. Our class officers no longer keep those records or assist in any requests. Since 2012, Matt Lambert, a surgeon, has been a senior VP at Kaufman Hall, a national healthcare consulting firm based in the Chicago area. He works with healthcare systems, hospitals and physician groups on a wide range of projects. He is also in his second three-year term on the board of the Catholic Health Association, and a board member of the Hospital Sisters Health System. Matt and his wife, Donna, intend to move to Charlottesville next year for retirement. They met and married there 39 years ago while both were on the faculty at the U of Virginia. They have a son and daughter. Paul Geary has left full time work with his company, GWR Medical, Inc., which utilizes a novel delivery system of topical oxygen to treat wounds and cutaneous ulcers. Having used it myself on several patients with chronic foot ulcers, I can attest to its efficacy. His two ND sons, Sean ’90 and Paul III ’88 run the company. Paul and his wife, Ann Marie, have 12 grandchildren. He has founded a Eucharistic society for their parish to study “the real presence.” Paul has a season-long home rental in South Bend and attends all home games. Retired Rear Admiral Phil Dur, who served in the Navy from 1965-1995, was a former VP of Northrop Gruman Corp, and was former president of their ship systems, has been appointed by Florida’s governor to the state’s boating advisory council. Phil lives in Destin FL. Irene and Ed Ojdana continue to produce award-winning cabernet wines from the Diamond Mountain District of Napa Valley. Those who attended our 50th Reunion will remember that Ed graciously donated his 2009 gold medal wine for our dinner. In May, Ed and his daughter, Kelly ’98, attended the launch of the ND Family Wines in Napa. Coach Brian Kelly spoke at the event. His winery’s website is vineyard511.com. Retired FBI special agents Jennifer and Ed Armento continue to reside in Prospect KY. Ed wrote to remind our class that we were instrumental in pushing ND to embrace the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation, which is under the auspices of the University. The impetus came from Ed’s efforts to allow a class gift to the APMRF during our 35th Reunion. Kevin Gardner sadly reports that Nat Davis died in May in Austin after a long battle with cancer. Nat was one of the original captains of ND rugby and had a distinguished career in real estate in Houston. Kevin was also a rugby player and Nat’s teammate with the Houston Rugby Club, which toured internationally. Kevin is semi-retired but still doing commercial real estate consulting after 42 years in the industry. He is in his third year of survival from pancreatic cancer after an experimental program at MD Anderson Cancer Center. At the time of diagnosis, he was given four months to live. He credits our Blessed Mother and has made two pilgrimages to Lourdes. Prayers are powerful; his son was diagnosed with a brain tumor at the same time and is also a cancer survivor. In March, John “Andy” Howard died in Henrietta NY after a long illness. He retired three years ago as executive VP and general manager of a manufacturing company where he had worked for 39 years. Andy and his wife, Judy, had been married 38 years and had three children, including Amy ’91 and eight grandchildren. He expressed regret at having missed our 50th Reunion. — James P. Harnisch MD; 6759 West Mercer Way, Mercer Island, WA 98040; jphnd65@hotmail.com\n\n65JD Bios Continue\n\nBobbie and Bob Kennedy remained in South Bend after graduation while Bob studied for the Indiana Bar. Upon learning he had passed in the first week of September, Bob and Bill Bishop made an early trip to Indianapolis to be sworn in, and then to headed off to satisfy their military obligation. Bob spent five years on active duty, including three years in Germany as the NATO Status of Forces liaison to German prosecutors in the Northern Bavarian region. This gave Bob and Bobbie a fantastic opportunity to travel widely in Europe. Upon returning to the US, a chance meeting with John McQuillan before the Notre Dame/Army football game led to Bob joining John at the Gary IN law firm where John was employed. Joe McDonald ’64 and Sam Bernardi ’66 were already there. Bob remained with the firm for 30 years. Eventually, the firm moved its office to Merrillville IN. After a short stint as an Indiana Superior Court Judge, Bob in 2003 opened his own mediator/arbitrator office and remains there today. Bob and Bobbie have lived in Valparaiso IN since 1972. There they raised their daughters, Moira and Megan. Each married a Notre Dame grad. Bobbie and Bob have five grandchildren and lots of great memories. Mike Ferrar reports that Larry Shinnick has been tracked down using a last-known email address, which included a “seminary” reference. Mike says that the “seminary folks” told him that Larry was at Saint Leo the Great Parish in Demopolis AL. Mike was able to reach him there. The bottom line is this: after Larry’s wife, Carolyn, died in 1998, Larry entered Pope St. John XXIII National Seminary, which specialized in second career vocations, defined as having worked for three years after college. Larry was sponsored by a bishop from Alabama, which explains his assignment. Mike supplies Larry’s email: larryshinnick@hotmail.com. His parish phone number: 334-289-2767.\n\nI have created five columns from the 10 bios I received around the time of our 50th Reunion. I considered writing fictional biographical accounts for classmates who haven’t submitted but concluded that might be unethical, even in a political year. Hopefully, I will hear from our more reclusive classmates soon. Unless I do, I will resume secretarial hibernation. — John Donald O’Shea; pelagius@qconline.com\n\n66 Celebration\n\nNearly 500 classmates, spouses and significant others gathered in the shadow of the Golden Dome in early June to celebrate the 50th anniversary of our matriculation from Our Lady’s University. To say that it was a special occasion would be to understate the reality of all that occurred during that early summer sojourn. Reconnection with old, dear friends was the operative theme for the 315 classmates in attendance, and noting how our University has grown and prospered was a rewarding aspect of the experience as well. Festivities began with an informal cookout for early arrivals on Thursday evening at our McGlinn Hall residence. The event was well-attended and featured tasty victuals and frosty libations interspersed with numerous “Is that you?” queries. Friday brought leisurely strolls and bike rides around the campus, attendance at various seminars and visits to former dorms and classrooms along with continued amazement at the plethora of new buildings and construction projects that dot the campus. The Friday 50-Year Club Mass was celebrated by Father Bill Beauchamp, CSC, and classmate Father Michael Giesler in honor of our 207 deceased mates. The evening Class Dinner in the Joyce ACC featured impressive presentations by Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick ’76 and Chief Investment Officer Scott Malpass ’84, ’86MBA. Swarbrick reaffirmed ND’s commitment to excellence in all phases of the athletic program and noted the continuing leadership ND demonstrates year in and year out, on and off the field. He also described the massive $450 million Campus Crossroads construction project that entails building major additions of classroom space attached to ND Stadium. Malpass, who has distinguished himself as the preeminent asset manager among the nation’s universities, described the basic strategy he and his team execute, which has resulted in an average 12 percent annual rate of return for the ND endowment over the past 20 years. The luncheon on Saturday, also in the Joyce ACC, featured our formal induction into the 50-Year Club and timely remarks from University President Father John Jenkins, CSC, and each one of us had a personal photo taken with Father John along with a massive class photo. Formal festivities concluded with our final Class Dinner on Saturday evening, which included inspiring remarks from former ND All-American defensive back and new ND assistant coach Todd Lyght ’91, as well as an outstanding report from our own John Phillips, the US Ambassador to Italy. John provided informative perspective on the global situation and outlook, noting that a primary focus of the diplomatic corps relates to how to deal with the growing threat of international terrorism. Class president Cap Gagnon, with whom I shared MC duties throughout the weekend, paid a well-deserved tribute to our classmates who have served in the nation’s military. As you know, it has been a tradition at ND for generations that members of the 50-Year Class make a special gift to the University. Our class collectively stepped up in extraordinary fashion, presenting a symbolic check for $22,180,000, an all-time record level of contributions for a 50-Year Class. Thanks to everyone who has participated, and remember that you can participate through the end of the year. Part of the promotion for our class gift was establishment of the Class of 1966 Pete Duranko Fund for Student Athlete Safety. This initiative arose out of a suggestion by John Twohey that we give classmates a specific and relevant option to which to direct all or part of their 50 Year Class gift. Tom Bettag and Minch Lewis joined in the effort, which to date has generated nearly $194,000 from 305 donors, including 279 classmates. The Duranko Fund will support a proactive effort to gather and analyze data from ND’s 700 varsity athletes relative to head injuries, with an eye toward improving prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The program is already under way and will begin data collection this fall. Leading the endeavor is a senior Athletic Department official, Duncan French PhD, who holds the title of Director of Performance Sciences. Among his responsibilities will be application of scientific research and new technologies to performance of varsity athletes, seeking to reduce and minimize the impact of injuries. French spent 15 years working with teams in Great Britain, including the English Premiere (soccer) League. The Duranko Fund promises to have a real and measurable positive impact on athletes at ND and hopefully well beyond. Gifts and multi-year pledges are welcome through the end of the calendar year and will earn credit toward football ticket applications. The 50-Year Reunion festivities were truly memorable for all in attendance. Feedback has been powerfully positive. Great appreciation is owed to the local gurus who pulled off the superb logistics: Ray Flynn, Joe Guiltinan and Pat Farrell. Be sure to check out Jack Gerken’s update with photos at 1966.undclass.org. All of you who promised to send updates, it’s time to step up. — Tom Sullivan; 26 Hidden Cove Road, Edgartown MA 02539; cell 773-454-4343; t66sullynd@gmail.com\n\n66JD See You Soon\n\nIf my timing is correct, you should receive this magazine just a few days before our 50th Class Reunion scheduled for the Notre Dame-Stanford game over the weekend of Oct. 14-16. Steve Seall informs me that 21 members of our class have said they will be coming. In addition, Dana Dee plans to attend, and Joan McNally along with her daughter Sarah have expressed interest in being there, as has Joan Gregory and her husband, Jack. By now those of you who applied for tickets to the game will have received word from the University whether you received the tickets you requested. At the time I am submitting this column, I know that Bob Siebert has one extra ticket and Scott Maxwell has six, but I presume they have been taken by the time you read this. If you still need tickets you might want to contact Steve at ssseall@comcast.net. Scott and I graduated from undergraduate and law school together in’63 and ’66, and his father and mine graduated from ND in 1927. Scott notes the further coincidence that my dad, Clarence J. Ruddy, wrote the quarterly columns for his class for many years and now I’m writing for our class. Steve continues his energetic participation in softball and recently bemoaned the fact that a string of rainy days in the Midwest this spring caused the cancellation of six games in one week. I don’t know about the rest of you, but the thought of playing even one game of softball a week makes me want to take a nap. He obviously doesn’t spend all of his retirement hours playing baseball, however, since he and Bonny found time to enjoy a riverboat cruise in Europe this summer. I continue to volunteer several times a month at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center and have seen the tremendous growth of new buildings on campus over the past five years, including the significant ongoing expansion of the stadium itself with the addition of skyboxes, classrooms and a new student center, not to mention the installation of wider seats, a new video scoreboard and “ribbon boards” running along the sides of the stadium. Check out Notre Dame’s websites for more details. I guarantee you will be amazed at the changes that have been made on the campus since the last time you were here. See you soon. — Philip C.

If you’d like to contribute to the planning process, I’m sure Jim could use the help. He can be reached at jbarrylaw@gmail.com. Joe Devlin is planning Cotillion IV in NYC before the Syracuse game on Oct. 1. He can be reached at jospehddevlin@cs.com. Jack McKay writes from Winnetka IL that he has recently celebrated 10 years of leaving Allstate Insurance as assistant VP and assistant general counsel. Today his primary activities are piano lessons, golf, reading and babysitting granddaughters. Jack was looking forward to having dinner with his old roommate Reid Duffy. From Fernandina Beach FL, John Cayce writes he has been retired from UPS for several years but visits Atlanta regularly, where he sees John Horney MD. Cayce roomed with Dennis Hogerty and recently learned that Dennis and Diane moved to Ann Arbor MI. John also roomed with Bill Prish, Dave Barbato and Joe Bleser. Bill lives in Gulf Shores AL and is married to a huge Bama fan. Joe is a CPA and also lives in Atlanta. He travels a lot with his wife, who is an accomplished artist. John discovered that Dave passed away about a year ago after he was retired from the Social Security Administration and living in Maryland. John eulogized Dave’s fun-loving personality and will miss him tremendously. Al Godin writes from Detroit, where he is still active as a group manager with Iroquoisind, a metal forming, welding and assembly business. Al also visited Dennis Hogerty and plans to bring Dennis to campus this fall for a game. Bob Schwartz and Chris Miller are desperately looking for Jim McGauley to determine where he is, what he is doing and if he will attend our 50th. So Jim, you’d better shout out. Carl De Franco is living in Rome NY after a career as a civilian employee of the Air Force Communications Command. He now does part-time consulting, and is active in the Rome Community Theatre as an actor and director. Carl is married with two married daughters and two grandchildren, and he regularly plays and sings at a local open stage and karaoke spot. Last Thanksgiving, he teamed with his brother Phil ’71 to do some Everly Brothers duets. Mike Steele writes from Forest Grove OR, where he has retired from full time teaching at Pacific U and will start as an adjunct this fall. And after 10 years as president of the US Handball Association, he stepped down in January. He has completed a book on Robert E. Lee and is awaiting its publication. His Fighting Irish Encyclopedia is in its fourth edition. Jim Keeler has notified us that the info published on Pat Dixon in the last issue was incorrect, and that Pat actually was killed in Vietnam on May 28, 1969, far from being the last man killed in that war. Please write so we can keep up with each other. — Bert R. Bondi; 1891 Curtis St., Unit 1502, Denver CO 80202; bertrbondi@gmail.com\n\n67JD Golden Years\n\nOur class continues to celebrate as our classmates and their mates trigger anniversary dates and mark 50 years of marriage. It is love and luck, fortitude and forgiveness, sickness and smiles. Nancy and Jim Olson celebrated on a trip to Hawaii with their three children. Cathy ’89 received her master’s from the London School of Economics and a law degree from Denver U. Dan ’97 works in Chicago, and Susanne graduated from Indiana U, got a master’s from DePaul U and works in Madison WI. Jack Harty has been telling his wife that their first 50 years of marriage would be the hardest; now he’s telling Maureen that it may be a few more years until it gets easier. I haven’t heard from Maureen as to her reaction to the new (jail) sentence. They have been distracted by the wildfire that charred 2,500 acres of foothills just behind their house in Idaho. Pam and Tom Sullivan celebrated their 50th in Scotland with a like number of pints in the local pubs. Tom had a knee replacement two years ago, and he feels like a kid again. No word on whether Pam still has the stamina to raise this kid to maturity a second time. Marylyn and Ken Lazarus will celebrate their big day with a river cruise and some side trips in Eastern Europe. Flo and I will celebrate our day with a typical Carolina pig pickin’ party at our golf club. Pounds of hushpuppies and a 90-pound pig will be barbequed to satisfy our local friends, siblings, children, grandchildren and assorted nieces traveling from all over the Northeast. Never underestimate how far family will travel for a free meal. Afterward, Flo and I will cruise along the coast to Nova Scotia. Carolyn and Dom Monterosso write that they celebrated their 50th anniversary years ago but their big news is that son Dominic ’90 was married last year and is expecting a baby girl in the fall. Dom figures he will be 96 when she graduates from high school. Bobby Barkley’s grands are also taking their toll on the old man as he attended all of their all-star baseball games: nine games in nine days in three different towns and two states. But Bobby has a fishing trip planned to Montana, and he will miss the rest of their postseason. On the way home, Bobby will meet up with recently retired Greg Walta in Denver. Newbie retiree Frank Cihlar is finding out that between the gym, a drawing class, piano and ballroom dancing lessons, he is more tired than retired. Frank is planning to travel to Bellingham WA to visit his son and daughter but he’s also been invited to give an address to a symposium on economic crime at Cambridge U later this year. Plans for our 50th Reunion, Sept. 22-24, 2017, are well under way. Already, 70 percent of our existing class is planning to come. And, as great as that percentage is, it would be better if we could assemble even more of our classmates. John Blasi, Mike Cook, Jack Couch, John Fine, Mike Fogerty, Tony Kowals, Mike Manzi, Joe Martori, Mo Nicholson, Pat Pochiro, Bill Schmuhl and Tom Smith have not responded. I believe these guys have gotten my emails but maybe a little persuasion from you will help. All of us would like to see them. Please don’t forget to reserve a room if the Morris Inn is in your plans. Call 800-280-7256. — Jim Heinhold; 1200 Carmel Lane, New Bern NC 28562; res 252-638-5913; im4irish@aol.com\n\n68 Gathering in Sorrow\n\nAt a time she was dealing with her own cancer, Bob Brady’s wife Margaret said, in Elise Stephens Reeder’s hearing, that any gathering of people our age begins with “an organ recital.” This column is such a gathering. Friend to all, except, perhaps, slightly less a friend to Prof. Frank O’Malley, Tom McCann died very suddenly in June after suffering a stroke. The suddenness of the passing of this ebullient, seemingly healthy classmate intensified the sadness of the disparate, large group who came to his Oak Park IL wake and then his funeral. Among the mourners, of course, was a legion of friends Tom knew at Notre Dame and before Notre Dame: class president Tom Weyer and Mary, Dennis Toolan and Mary Lou, a roomful and then a nearby bar full. Tom Gibbs and Rick McPartlin knew Tom as “Wally” because there were too many Toms when they were classmates at Chicago’s Mt. Carmel High School. Mary Pat McKenna said that she and Tom “Rock” McKenna were to have been with Tom and his wife, Kathleen Mary Drumm, the night of the stroke. Sheila and Tom Gibbs were also accustomed to being with Tom and Kathleen. And who were the other mourners? In the lines were women and men of many ages and types, their eyes red, tissues at their noses, their thoughts large and regretful as they waited for a last look and then a word with Tom’s wife and four children. At ndclass1968.com, our blog, you will find an obituary and comments. In short, after Peace Corps service, Tom was a social worker in the Cook County IL healthcare system. And what of the Frank O’Malley tension? Catching sight of an O’Malley image at a reunion, Tom’s nostrils flared. “Him!” he said. “Him!” The Irish in Tom left him resentful of the D that he and partner Tom Etten received for their work as students in the Modern Catholic Writers class. In Lexington KY, the death of Joe Scott on July 5 produced the same anguish, if not the same surprise. Well-known as a former bankruptcy judge and member of a prominent law firm, Joe was a father and grandfather who dealt for years with failing kidneys. “He finally had a transplant with a kidney donated by his youngest daughter, Jane,” wrote Mike Coleman. “He always said it was his loving wife Patty who kept him on the straight and narrow for all those years prior to the transplant.” Those who remember Louisville classmate John Fowler will understand something that must come with the Kentucky air: “It’s hard to think about all the good memories but know that Joe was great to be around as he had wonderful sense of humor and was fun to be with. He owned a box at Keeneland race track that was approximately two boxes from the finish line.” In addition to Mike and his wife, Gloria, other classmates attending Joe’s funeral were Ken DiLaura and Michael Wolf and his wife, Mary Bartlett ’68SMC. Then, at the end of July, came this alarming news from Pat DeMare’s daughter: “This past Tuesday morning (my father) entered the ER unable to walk and in severe pain. He was admitted, and brought to the ICU, where he has been until today (July 30). He still cannot walk and is still in severe pain. As of yesterday, we know he contracted a very bad bacteria that entered his whole system. Unfortunately after many tests he still does not know the source of the infection. Now, he is on dialysis.” Please remember these classmates and their families in your prayers. Save some space for rejoicing with Dia and John Walsh about the birth of their grandson Declan James Walsh in New Orleans. Fred Ferlic figures in some additional news from a South Bend lunch with Joe Kernan, Gene Cavanaugh, Monk Forness and Brother John Paige, CSC, who were saying good-by to Father John Pearson, CSC, as Father John headed for new work in Arizona. Because of the adult nature of some of the material, look for that and other news in the identified sections of ndclass1968.com. What you see here is about half of what you’ll find on the blog.

Collins;\n\n314-516-2648; dgc@greensfelder.com\n\n69 Losses for the Class\n\nUnfortunately, we have lost two classmates since our last column. John Quinn sent the newspaper obituary for Thomas Quinn, who passed away April 29. Tom had battled colon cancer for approximately five years. He was a defensive back on our 1966 championship football team and was a very successful businessman who worked with his college roommate, Jay Jordan, and did service work for his Chicago community. Our condolences to his wife, Diane; his children, Katie and Tommy; and his extended family. Classmate Bill Gunlocke sent word that Jack Connors, also known as “Bourbon Jack,” was in hospice in Denver and passed away on May 22 from cancer. Jack had been living in Colorado Springs with his wife, Genevieve. He retired to Colorado after his career as a lawyer in DC. He was a very humorous and colorful classmate. Jack is survived by Genevieve and his son, Michael. Our condolences to his family. Otherwise, the communication has been a little slow this summer, which means that everyone is enjoying it, I hope. I look forward to the fall football season and our minireunion at the Stanford game. I hope to see as many of you as possible. All the best. Go Irish. — Tom Ryan; 248-334-9938; sylvanlawtr@gmail.com\n\n69MBA Remembering\n\nWith regret, I report the passing of Denise Day, wife of David Day. Dave sent me Denise’s obituary to inform his classmates that she passed away in late February. As you can imagine, after 45 years together, he is struggling with the transition. I am sure you remember Denise since they were dating during our class years. Denise passed away on Feb. 23 while resting at home with family and friends. Denise and David had two girls, Danielle and Diane, and two boys, Donald and Darrell, as well as 11 grandchildren. Her grandson Collin recalled, “She was always there for anyone that needed her to be there no matter what. She’s the strongest women I will ever know.” If you would like to make a memorial contribution in Denise’s name for her grandchildren’s education fund, make it out to David Day at 2853 Rubbins Road, Howell MI 48843. If you have news for our class, please contact me. — Dennis B. McCarthy; PO Box 246, Bear Lake MI 49614; dbmc2@blarneycastleoil.com\n\n69JD The ‘R’ Word"
