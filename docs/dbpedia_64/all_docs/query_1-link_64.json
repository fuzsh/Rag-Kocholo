After three years of testing, there are now sufficient data (1,490 families; 5,077 individuals) for preliminary genetic analyses. Measures of parent–offspring resemblance for members of the two largest ethnic groups in our sample, Americans of European ancestry (AEA; 739 families) and Americans of Japanese ancestry (AJA; 244 families), are presented here. These measures provide upper-bound estimates for the heritability of performance on the individual tests and factor scores1,2, in addition to a test of the hypothesis3,4 that spatial visualisation ability is influenced by a sex-linked major gene. Relatively small scale studies of parent–offspring resemblance for specific cognitive abilities have been reported for a Caucasian sample5 and a Korean sample6; however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of parent–offspring resemblance for measures of cognitive abilities in two ethnic groups.",
