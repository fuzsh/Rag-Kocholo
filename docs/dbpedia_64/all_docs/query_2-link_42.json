        "text": "Award-winning journalist Kara Swisher has interviewed nearly every consequential innovator and tech entrepreneur working today. Her new memoir, “Burn Book: A Tech Love Story,” is an insider’s tale of success, failure, hubris and optimism. As Detroit gains influence in technology and the EV revolution, Swisher sits down with Mary Barra, chair and CEO of General Motors, to discuss her new book and explore the dynamic interplay of legacy companies, innovation, strategic bets on the future, and tech’s potential to solve problems and not just create them.\n\nKara Swisher is the co-founder and editor-at-large of Recode, producer and host of the Recode Decode and Pivot podcasts, and co-executive producer of the Code Conference series. She also has a special series on MSNBC called Revolution on the impact of technology on work, society, and more, and is a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.\n\nMary Barra is Chair and Chief Executive Officer of General Motors. She was elected Chair of the GM Board of Directors in 2016 and has served as CEO of GM since 2014. Under Barra’s leadership, GM envisions a world with zero crashes, to save lives; zero emissions, so future generations can inherit a healthier planet; and zero congestion, so customers get back a precious commodity – time. She is focused on creating the best customer experience and strengthening GM’s core vehicle and services business, while also working to deliver transformative technologies such as electrification, autonomous driving and software.\n\nHistorically, maps have served as a panoptic technology, assisting imperial powers in governance, discipline, and control. In this exhibit, internationally renowned Filipino artist Cian Dayrit acts as a counter-cartographer, reclaiming mapmaking as an emancipatory activity.\n\nDayrit’s artworks, embroidered on textiles or painted over collages of colonial-era maps, plot the extraction of natural resources, land grabbing, and dispossession and displacement in his native Philippines. At the same time, their resistant lines summon new imaginaries out of the overlaps between places and memories.\n\nDayrit’s practice is critically and practically informed by the narratives of Filipino communities. Items exhibited alongside his artwork are the result of map-drawing workshops the artist has convened with rural, urban, and indigenous communities across the Philippines. Propositions to Progress invites you to engage in the collaborative endeavor to activate alternative territories from the ground up.\n\nCian Dayrit is an interdisciplinary artist exploring colonialism and ethnography, archaeology, history, and mythology. Dayrit subverts the language of the state, museum, and military to visualize the contradictions on which these institutions are built. He studied at the University of the Philippines.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential campaign ramps up, candidates are facing pressure to pledge not to touch Social Security. While this pledge is framed as ‘protecting benefits,’ it is – in reality – an implicit endorsement of a 23 percent across-the-board benefit cut in 2033, when the Social Security retirement fund becomes insolvent. In that year, annual benefits would be cut by $17,400 for a typical newly retired dual-income couple.\n\nUS Budget Watch 2024 is a project of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget designed to educate the public on the fiscal impact of presidential candidates’ proposals and platforms. It does not support or oppose any candidate for public office.\n\nMarc Goldwein is the Senior Vice President and Senior Policy Director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, where he guides and conducts research on a wide array of topics related to fiscal policy and the federal budget. He is frequently quoted in a number of major media outlets and works regularly with Members of Congress and their staffs on budget-related issues.\n\nPreviously, Marc served as Associate Director of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (The Fiscal Commission) and senior budget analyst on the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (The Super Committee). He also conducted research for the Government Accountability Office, the World Bank, the Historian’s Office at the Social Security Administration, and the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley.\n\nIn addition to his work at the Committee, Marc serves on Martha’s Tables’ Business Advisory Council and teaches economics at Johns Hopkins University and the University of California DC. Marc is the recipient of the Johns Hopkins University Excellence in Teaching award and was featured in the Forbes “30 Under 30” list for Law & Policy. He holds a BA and MA from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nEmmanuel’s talk offers a critical examination of how cities utilize public resources, labor, land, and materials to address challenges and plan for the future of the built environment. The conversation explores SWF’s practice of re-mapping cities’ resources at its Communiversity to create true Common Wealth – the spaces, structures, networks, resources, and opportunities essential to mending the urban fabric, healing communities, and equipping our neighborhoods to thrive, rather than merely survive. The talk invites us to imagine: “What if??? What if…. neighborhood development took place on a human scale, fueled by the critical connections that cultivate the relationships and collective commitment to do the necessary work?”\n\nEmmanuel Pratt is an Urban Designer, Artist, and MacArthur Fellow. He is the co-founder and Executive Director of Sweet Water Foundation. Emmanuel’s praxis is rooted in decades of work that interrogates the cross-sectionality of architecture, urban planning, agroecology, and human development. His work builds upon and moves beyond the theory of Communicative Action towards the creation of a new paradigm of Regenerative Neighborhood Development (RND). Emmanuel was a Harvard GSD Loeb Fellow in 2017, a 2019 Joyce Award recipient, and a 2019 MacArthur Fellow.\n\nSopheap Pich is widely considered to be Cambodia’s most internationally prominent contemporary artist. In 1979, when the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia led to the ousting of the Khmer Rouge régime, he fled with his family to Thailand, spending four years in refugee camps before immigrating to the United States. Memories of traveling vast distances on foot and witnessing the devastation of war — broken bodies, ravaged landscapes, abandoned artillery, ruined buildings, and the breakdown of social and cultural institutions — underpin his early sculptural practice. While Pich studied painting, earning a BFA from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (1995), and an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (1999), he turned his attention to sculpture after returning to Cambodia in 2002 where he laboriously began working with local materials – bamboo, old rafters, rattan, burlap, beeswax, broken utensils, and earth pigments gathered from his local surroundings. Pich’s works have been collected and shown in many museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, the Centre George Pompidou, the Mori Art Museum, M+, and the National Gallery of Singapore, as well as many international exhibitions including the 57th Venice Biennale (2017), Documenta 13 (2012), the 6th Asia Pacific Triennale (2009), the Setouchi Triennale (2022), and the Guangju Biennale (2023), among others. He lives and works in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.\n\nPich’s work is featured in the University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) exhibition Angkor Complex: Cultural Heritage and Post-Genocide Memory in Cambodia, curated by U‑M History of Art Professor Nachiket Chanchani and on view February 3 — July 2024. As crises of public health, racial injustice, economic instability, and climate change spread worldwide, millions are experiencing distress, conflict, indebtedness, and vulnerability. This mélange of unnerving emotions is hardly new for Cambodians. Between 1975 – 1979, when the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia, about a quarter of the country’s population died of infectious diseases, weapon wounds, and malnutrition. Bringing together more than eighty artworks spanning a millennium — including many on loan from collections worldwide — this landmark exhibition presents the visual culture of Cambodia and its diaspora and allows viewers to encounter the still-fresh scars of a genocide and of related upheavals and critically appreciate strategies evolved to nurture resilience.\n\nThe 2024 Doris Sloan Memorial Program is presented in partnership with the University of Michigan Museum of Art. Established through the generosity of Dr. Herbert Sloan, this annual program honors one of the Museum’s most ardent friends and supporters, Doris Sloan, a long-time UMMA docent.\n\nLead support for Angkor Complex: Cultural Heritage and Post-Genocide Memory in Cambodia is provided by the U‑M Office of the Provost, the U‑M Office of the President, the Michigan Arts and Culture Council, the Eleanor Noyes Crumpacker Endowment Fund, and the U‑M Ross School of Business.\n\nSeries presenting partners: Detroit Public Television and PBS Books. Media partner: Michigan Radio.\n\nDr. Rajiv Shah is the president of The Rockefeller Foundation, a global institution with a mission to promote the well-being of humanity around the world. Shah will discuss his new book, “Big Bets: How Large-Scale Change Really Happens” (Simon & Schuster, 2023), and how universities can embrace a big bets mindset of transformative change, especially as it relates to solving the climate crisis. In his talk, Shah will share a dynamic new model for creating lasting change, inspired by his own work and that of The Rockefeller Foundation on some of the biggest humanitarian efforts of the 21st century. Shah will draw from his experiences working as the 16th administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development and his leadership roles at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The event will include an audience Q&A session and a book signing immediately following the talk. A limited number of books will be available for purchase.\n\nThis event is FREE and open to the public. Although you may have a ticket, it does not guarantee you a seat. We will be seating ticket holders first and recommend you are in your seat 10 minutes before the start of the event. We will start to let in general public seating 10 minutes prior to the event.\n\nHosted by the University of Michigan, the School for Environment and Sustainability, and the Frederick A. & Barbara M. Erb Institute, and co-sponsored by the Alumni Association of the University of Michigan, Graham Sustainability Institute, Global CO2 Initiative, Planet Blue, and the College of Literature, Science and the Arts and Literati Bookstore.\n\nSince 9/11 and the global War on Terror, we have seen the racial projects of Islamophobia grow to dangerous ends, targeting Muslims and those who ‘appear’ Muslim as unassimilable Others to be surveilled, contained, and eliminated. At the same time, we have seen growing coalitions of diverse Muslim, Middle Eastern, and Arab Americans coming together to challenge anti-Muslim politics and the systems that legitimize them. These solidarity politics have found roots in the legacies of Dr. King and the Black freedom struggle. However, recognizing the interconnection between Muslim immigrants and Black Americans has been a longer and more complicated journey that offers us all lessons for the deep divides that face us today. This talk draws on archival data and focus groups to trace the strategic trajectory of Muslim American activism from histories of aspirational whiteness to futures of intersectional coalitions. Muslim activists progress from early strategies centered on maintaining their distance from Black identity and history to eventual strategies that use the memory of Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement as a cultural bridge, joining Muslim identity with Black identity in multiracial coalitions. What results from this new understanding of “who we are” is not only a reclamation of what it means to be American but also an emancipatory conception of what it means to belong to a human community across borders, boundaries, and time.\n\nSpeaker\n\nHajar Yazdiha, Assistant Professor of Sociology University of Southern California\n\nThe Washington Post has examined both the devastation caused by AR-15 assault rifles as well as its allure for segments of American society, in a 13-part series.\n\nPhoto editor Kainaz Amaria, series editor Peter Wallsten, and reporter Silvia Foster-Frau, will speak about their reporting on “The gun that divides a nation – revered as a modern-day musket; reviled as a tool for mass killers.”\n\nThe series can be seen here. A warning that many of the images are disturbing.\n\nKainaz Amaria oversees immersive, visual-first stories for the National desk at The Washington Post. Before joining The Post, Kainaz was Vox’s first-ever visuals editor. And before that she was an editor on NPR’s Visual Team, where she had multiple roles in NPR’s “Planet Money Makes a T-shirt” project, including managing producer, photographer and videographer. The project won NPR numerous awards, including a News and Documentary Emmy. In 2010, she was a Fulbright Scholar and completed a short film on the Parsi Zoroastrian community in Mumbai. In 2020, Amaria was honored with the John Long Ethics Award by the National Press Photographers Association for her writing and criticism on the photojournalism industry and visual language. Kainaz began her career as a local newspaper photographer.\n\nPeter Wallsten is senior national investigations editor. He has led or helped oversee four Pulitzer Prize winning lines of coverage as an editor on The Washington Post’s National staff. Most recently, he shepherded The Post’s abortion coverage in the wake of the Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v Wade, which won the 2023 Pulitzer Prize in National Reporting. He has served as The Post’s senior politics editor, leading political coverage during the Trump administration, and was the founding editor of the paper’s Politics Investigations and Enterprise team. Before becoming an editor in 2013, Wallsten was a White House correspondent for The Post and a political reporter for the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Miami Herald and St. Petersburg Times. He is a graduate of the University of North Carolina, where he was editor of The Daily Tar Heel.\n\nSilvia Foster-Frau is a national investigative reporter for The Washington Post who explores the impacts of America’s changing racial, ethnic and cultural demographics. She also has covered several mass shootings, including in Sutherland Springs, Atlanta, Uvalde, Nashville and Allen, among others. Silvia won the National Association of Hispanic Journalist’s Elaine Rivera Civil Rights and Social Justice award in 2022 for her work on the largely untold crisis of police violence against Latinos. She joined The Post in February 2021 from the San Antonio Express-News, where she covered immigration and border security, winning Texas APME Star Reporter of the Year in 2019. Silvia is vice president of NAHJ’s D.C. Chapter.\n\nThe talk will discuss the various ways Lori has responded to pressing issues of our time. Lori will present an overview of key aspects of ongoing research, advocacy, and activism that have focused on topics from immigration and the border, equity within the built environment, to reproductive justice. All provide various opportunities to intersect with law, policy, and the built environment.\n\nLori Brown’s creative practice examines the relationships between architecture and social justice with particular emphasis on gender and its impact upon spatial relationships. She is the author of Contested Spaces: Abortion Clinics, Women’s Shelters and Hospitals, the editor of Feminist Practices: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Women in Architecture and the forthcoming Bloomsbury Global Encyclopedia of Women in Architecture, 1960-2020 co-edited with Dr. Karen Burns.

A video recording will also be available on our website after the event.\n\nThis event is presented in partnership with U-M Democracy & Debate, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, and Wallace House.\n\nJ oin us for a screening and discussion of the film While at War (Mientras Dure La Guerra). Set in the first months of the Spanish Civil War, this riveting and timely drama from acclaimed writer-director Alejandro Amenábar tracks the country’s slide into nearly four decades of fascism under dictator Francisco Franco.\n\nJulián Casanova is professor of contemporary history at the University of Zaragoza and visiting professor at the Central European University of Vienna. He has authored and co-authored important books on the history of Spain, the Spanish Civil War, and Franco’s Spain which were published, in English, by Routledge, Cambridge University Press, and I.B. Tauris. His latest book, Indomitable Violence: A History of Twentieth-Century Europe, was published in 2020, with a remarkable impact and several editions, and will be translated by Princeton University Press. In addition to his scholarship, Casanova is a frequent contributor to the Spanish newspaper El País, and serves as a historical consultant in the television and film industry, both in documentaries and TV series and films. He is in residence at the University of Michigan for the 2022-23 academic year as the Weiser Center for Europe and Eurasia Distinguished Fellow.\n\nFlint Is Family In Three Acts is a multi-part exhibition by renowned artist LaToya Ruby Frazier. For five years, Frazier researched and collaborated with two poets, activists, mothers and residents of Flint, Michigan, Shea Cobb and Amber Hasan, as they endured one of the most devastating ecological crises in U.S. history. Resulting in a monumental oeuvre of photographs, video, and texts Frazier developed Flint Is Family In Three Acts (2016−2021) to advocate for access to clean and safe drinking water for all regardless of race, religion and economic status. The series records stories of surviving and thriving, especially within racialized and marginalized neighborhoods in Flint, to ensure that they remained visible in national debates concerning environmental justice. Drawing inspiration from the urgency in Frazier’s work, which also sheds light on building equitable and inclusive futures, Stamps Gallery, part of the Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design at the University of Michigan, initiated a partnership with the Flint Institute of Arts and the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University to bring this important exhibition together for the first time in Michigan. As co-presenters of this landmark exhibition, our goal is to offer a creative pedagogical platform that reaches broader audiences across Michigan and beyond — Flint is Family: Act I(2016−2017) will take place at the Flint Institute of Arts, Act II (2017−2019) at the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, and Act III (2019) at Stamps Gallery. The exhibition served as a catalyst to bring three disparate institutions together to deepen our understanding of individual and institutional agency in advocating for equity, transparency and environmental justice in our respective communities, while also highlighting the role of the artist as an agent for enacting positive social change.\n\nCurated by Srimoyee Mitra, Tracee Glab, and Steven L. Bridges with the assistance of Jennifer Junkermeier-Khan, Rachel Winter, and Rachael Holstege.\n\nStamps Gallery launched Respond/​Resist/​Rethink in the fall 2020 to kick off the fall semester with student work paired with the work of leading artists exhibiting at the Gallery. In this semester’s exhibition, students responded to the prompt: The care, sustainability, and access to free and clean water is arguably one of the most urgent and challenging issues of our time. ​“What can you do to spread awareness of water issues and conservation measures?”\n\nWater is the lifeblood of civilizations, the center of cities, the foundation of creation stories and the connective tissue of culture. Water is a life force, without it humanity will cease to exist. Fresh water is necessary for the survival of all living organisms on Earth. The human body is made up of over 60% water and humanity cannot survive without it. Water is a vital life source that holds (and generates) power. It is nourishing, quenching, and refreshing but has also been commodified, polluted, and politicized.\n\nFrom the Standing Rock, Leech Lake and Fond du Lac reservations, to the straits of Mackinac where oil pipelines threaten important waterways, to the polluted Mississippi River and drying Colorado River Basin, to water shutoffs in Detroit, PFAs in Ann Arbor, and the Flint Water crisis (to name just a few), ensuring access to clean water (and the sustainable ecologies it supports) is an ongoing struggle that requires intersectional, intergenerational, and collective knowledge sharing, discussion and action to protect.\n\nP lease join us for the Martin Luther King Jr. Colloquium featuring journalist jarret hill.\n\njarrett hill is an award-winning journalist, writer, and an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism. He currently serves as President of the National Association of Black Journalists’ of Los Angeles (NABJLA). As a leader at NABJLA, jarrett has advocated for journalists in commercial and public media as well as on the state level. He’s reported on and worked for more effective diversity, equity, & inclusion strategies, fair treatment of Black journalists, and making a better environment at work for journalists and communications professionals.\n\njarrett co-hosts FANTI from Maximum Fun with Tre’vell Anderson, chosen as one of Apple Podcasts’ “Best of 2020.” The show covers pop culture and politics with an intersectional, nuanced eye. Also with Anderson, their book, “Historically Black Phrases” (2023, Penguin Random House’s Ten Speed Press), is “the ultimate love letter to Black language and people.”\n\nhill will speak from the lens of the book in Historically Black Phrases: Musings on The Black Church’s Influence on Black Language & Popular Culture. hill will consider Dr. King’s use of language to influence the Civil Rights movement, paired with how the Black church has influenced Black people and, in turn, broader popular culture.\n\nin 2016, jarrett made international headlines after breaking the story of Michelle Obama’s speech being plagiarized by Melania Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention. He was named later that year to the 2016 Ebony Power 100. jarrett’s contributed to MSNBC, NBC News, CNN, NPR and others, and has bylines in the New York Times, Variety, and many others.\n\nBesides upending international norms and causing immense suffering, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has also heightened the communication freeze between Russian and American diplomats. In fact, all levels of communication between Moscow and Washington – official, professional, and people-to-people – have stalled at this point. Public opinion surveys represent one of the few remaining ways for policymakers, journalists, experts, and the interested public to stay informed about attitudes in Russia today. The joint public opinion research project started by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the Levada Center in 2017 provides critical information about public perceptions of central elements of the bilateral relationship and global affairs more broadly. The two most recent rounds of the survey, conducted in the United States and Russia in March and November 2022, focus on the war in Ukraine. This presentation will unpack the results of these surveys, with a specific focus on which narratives about the conflict are having the most influence on public perception, what paths to a resolution of the conflict each public might see as acceptable, and how opinion has evolved over the past year. The talk will also look to the future, touching on the threats that both publics sense going forward, and the views of younger generations of Russians and Americans.\n\nT he talk will feature Stepan Goncharov, Head of Applied Research Department, Levada Center; Dina Smeltz (MA REES ’92), Senior Fellow for Public Opinion and US Foreign Policy, The Chicago Council on Global Affairs; and Denis Volkov, Director, Levada Center.\n\nFor this hybrid lecture, Dina Smeltz will be on campus with Denis Volkov and Stepan Goncharov participating remotely. Attendees can join us in person in 555 Weiser Hall or on Zoom at https://myumi.ch/pZQxj\n\nMichigan’s new approach to redistricting by an independent citizens commission has now come full circle, from signature gathering for the statewide ballot initiative in 2018, to strong statewide support in that fall’s election, creation of the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, their work drawing new districts with extraordinary input from Michigan citizens, and now the new districts being used for the first time in the 2022 elections.\n\nJoin us for a final webinar in our redistricting series, to look back at this consequential change in state policy and to review how this new approach played out this fall, including its impacts on races and election outcomes, and how it compares to experiences in other states. We’ll hear from an expert panel covering these and related issues, including their reactions to audience questions.\n\nModerator: Matt Grossmann, Director, Institute for Public Policy and Social Research of Political Science at Michigan State University\n\nPanelists\n\nMoon Duchin, MGMG Redistricting lab\n\nZach Gorchow, Executive Editor and Publisher at Gongwer News Service Michigan\n\nNancy Wang, Executive Director, Voters Not Politicians\n\nThis virtual event is hosted by the Center for Local, State and Urban Policy (CLOSUP) at the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy, Voters Not Politicians (VNP), and Michigan State University’s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research (IPPSR), with support from the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.\n\nThe viewing link will be emailed to registrants one day before the event.\n\nJ oin the Donia Human Rights Center for a panel discussion moderated by Omolade Adunbi, director of the African Studies Center at the University of Michigan.\n\nIn February 2023, Nigerians will elect new representatives including a new president. This election would mark Nigeria’s 24 years of a post-military authoritarian multi-party democracy. Nigeria transitioned to democracy in May 1999 after several decades of military rule. Since the transition to Democracy, the country has been bedeviled with challenges of insecurity as result of Islamist insurgency in the Northeast, oil insurgency in the Niger Delta, Biafra separatist in the East and agitation for fiscal federalism in the West. Many of these challenges have resulted in gross violations of human rights and erosion of democratic institutions. At the same time, the elections in 2023 gives a new generation of voters, mainly youths, a hope of heralding a new era of political and economic reforms that could help strengthen democratic institutions in the country. Therefore, this panel brings together experts on elections, democracy and human rights to interrogate the future of democratic practices in Nigeria. This panel will examine the prospects for 2023 elections. Will the surge in new voter registration orchestrated by youths through social media platforms herald a new political era in Nigeria? Will the election be a return to the status quo? Will questions of human rights shape electioneering campaigns? Will violence play a role in the election? And, most fundamentally, will these elections reflect the will of the Nigerian electorate, or will ethnicity and religion play an outsized role in Nigerians’ electoral choices?\n\nP anelists:\n\nIdayat Hassan, Executive Director, Center for Democracy and Development (CDD), Abuja, Nigeria\n\nEbenezer Obadare, Douglas Dillon Senior Fellow for Africa Studies, Council on Foreign Relations, Washington, DC\n\nAnne Pitcher, Professor, Departments of Afroamerican and African Studies and Political Science, University of Michigan\n\nRacial Foundations of Public Policy is a speaker series that focuses on the historical roots and impact of race in shaping public policy as both a disciplinary field and as a course of action. Through it, we bring in renowned scholar-experts from across the country to be in conversation with Dean Celeste Watkins-Hayes, the founding director of the Center for Racial Justice at the Ford School of Public Policy. The series is open to all members of the University of Michigan community and the wider public.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nJohn N. Robinson III, Ph.D., studies the racial underpinnings of money and markets, with emphasis on housing and credit policies. His award-winning work examines how the rise of finance is reshaping place-based inequalities within and around American cities. His current book project explores the ongoing rise of the affordable housing industry in the US and its intersections with racial and economic inequality. A secondary project investigates the politics of race, punishment and municipal debt in suburban areas.

Galston, Brookings scholar, calls an “epic trilogy.” Mr. Shapiro’s current book is The Betrayal: How Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans Abandoned America. Robert B. Reich said: “Ira Shapiro holds Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate accountable for their deliberate and catastrophic failure to stop Donald Trump even when American lives and American democracy were at stake. A gripping narrative and a must-read.” Ira’s first book, The Last Great Senate: Courage and Statesmanship in Times of Crisis (2012), was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Richard A. Baker, Senate Historian emeritus, described it as “a historically and politically artistic work of great brilliance.” Ira’s second book, Broken: Can the Senate Save Itself and the Country? (2018), also received critical acclaim. Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of State, called it “an unflinching account…which takes a wider lens to describe how dysfunction in the Senate helped open the door to Donald Trump.”\n\nChris Marquette is a congressional ethics and accountability reporter for CQ Roll Call, where he covers the U.S. Capitol Police, the Jan. 6 select committee, ethics investigations and House Republicans. He uncovered a disturbing pattern of Capitol Police officer misconduct in which accused officers received light punishments from top department officials. Marquette has also covered financial regulation in Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Before joining CQ Roll Call, he covered education and government for Hearst newspapers in Connecticut. Marquette began his career at the Picayune Item in Mississippi. He is currently a Knight-Wallace Journalism Fellow at the University of Michigan.\n\nS ponsors\n\nThis event is hosted by the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy and co-sponsored by the Alumni Association of the University of Michigan’s Alumni Education program and U-M Democracy & Debate.\n\nPlease join us for a Real World Perspectives on Poverty Solutions talk featuring attorneys Eli Savit and Victoria Burton-Harris.\n\nEli Savit serves as the elected Prosecuting Attorney for Washtenaw County. He formerly served as a law clerk to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was a civil-rights and public-interest attorney, and started his career as a public-school teacher. Most recently, Eli served as the City of Detroit’s senior legal counsel, where he led criminal-justice reform work for Michigan’s largest city. Eli continues to teach at the University of Michigan as a Lecturer with the Law School.\n\nVictoria Burton-Harris serves as the Chief Assistant Prosecutor for Washtenaw County. In 2014, she opened a private firm in the heart of downtown Detroit specializing in family law and criminal defense at the state and federal trial court level. Her passion for justice and equality has led to her involvement with several grassroots organizations as a legal adviser. She also serves on various boards and committees. Burton-Harris currently sits on the Coalition for Police Transparency & Accountability, National Conference of Black Lawyers, the Board of Directors for the National Lawyers Guild Michigan chapter and the Board of Directors for Covenant House Michigan, a youth homeless shelter where she developed a mentoring program for residents. Burton-Harris teaches at the University of Michigan as a Lecturer with the Law School.\n\nThe talk, which is free and open to the public, will also be livestreamed on YouTube.\n\nThe Weiser Diplomacy Center at the University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy and the American Academy of Diplomacy will co-host a discussion with four former ambassadors on the global implications of the war in Ukraine. Ambassador Susan Elliott will consider the war’s implications for NATO and the future of Europe, including whether NATO’s new unity and strength will hold and what the future security architecture of Europe will look like. Ambassador Robert Cekuta will discuss implications for Central Asia and Russia’s “near abroad,” discussing how the war relates to Russia’s imperial history, what it means for the former states of the Soviet Union, and the economic and energy questions it raises. Ambassador Richard Boucher will discuss implications for Asia, including China’s position in this evolving world and how the war in Ukraine will change China’s calculus for Taiwan. Ambassador Ronald Neumann will moderate the panel and provide a perspective on implications for the Middle East.\n\nThis event is free and open to the public; registration is available here.\n\nDistinguished Lecture in Musicology\n\nSMTD presents distinguished musicolist Dr. Kevin Bartig of Michigan State University as he presents his work on music critic Olin Downs and his role in shaping a nationalist agenda for American music. In 1929 and 1932, the long-serving and influential New York Times music critic Olin Downes embarked on extended tours of the Soviet Union. During these visits, Downes attended performances, evaluated new compositions, and consulted with cultural bureaucrats on the state of Soviet musical culture. As the first prominent US music critic to visit the Soviet Union since the Bolshevik Revolution, Downes understood that his first-hand observer status bestowed a transnationally constructed authority that allowed him to make big and often highly tendentious claims about what he saw and heard. These claims were not simply pro- or anti-Bolshevik reactions but were in fact intertwined with a much deeper agenda: Downes’s desire to foster a middlebrow, national art music at home in the United States. This chapter of Downes’s career is crucial to understanding both how the Soviet experiment shaped discourse around American music and how US opinion on Soviet culture took shape during the interwar years.\n\nCommemorating Constitution Day\n\nUniversity of Michigan Law, with the Office of the Provost, commemorates Constitution Day with an event featuring Hon. J. Michael Luttig. Judge Luttig served for nearly fifteen years as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The open letter circulated by Vice President Pence on January 6, 2021, quoted Judge Luttig’s assertion that “[t]he only responsibility and power of the Vice President under the Constitution is to faithfully count the Electoral College votes as they have been cast,” and not “to alter in any way the votes that have been cast, either by rejecting certain votes or otherwise.” On June 16, 2022, Judge Luttig testified before the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, to the effect that President Trump and his allies had “instigated” a war on democracy. He was also one of the authors of LOST NOT STOLEN: The Conservative Case that Trump Lost and Biden Won the 2020 Presidential Election, issued in July 2022.\n\nThis event is free and open to the public. Join in person in Jeffries Hall room 1225 or online at: https://umich.zoom.us/j/93360607078\n\nThe tumult of the first years of this decade – a global pandemic, an unprecedented presidential election, movements for social and racial justice, impacts of climate change, pressures on urban infrastructure – has played out in our nation’s cities and thrust the challenges and opportunities for mayors and their leadership into the spotlight. This special virtual event brings together four mayors from major cities across the states of the Big Ten in a discussion about how leadership at the city level shapes our national approaches to some of the most pressing issues of the day.\n\nParticipating Mayors\n\nMike Duggan, Mayor of Detroit, MI\n\nLori Lightfoot, Mayor of Chicago, IL\n\nAftab Pureval, Mayor of Cincinnati, OH\n\nBruce Teague, Mayor of Iowa City, IA\n\nWelcoming Remarks\n\nJonathan Massey, Dean, Taubman College of Architecture & Urban Planning, University of Michigan\n\nChristopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, MI\n\nModerated by Paul Helmke, Director, Civic Leaders Center, Paul H.

This is as true, or more so in the Global South, where social media has often served as the gateway for entry into the online realm for millions of technology users with little or no prior experience. The resulting world is one in which the boundaries between the physical and the virtual has fundamentally reshaped power equations between the citizens and the state, their culture, and their communities.\n\nThis symposium at the University of Michigan is focused on social media influencers, and brings a host of leaders, artistes, journalists, activists, commentators, and scholars from two of the fastest growing Internet-using regions of the world to discuss how they interact online, what drives their activities and\n\nThis Masterclass in Activism brings together in conversation Dorothy Roberts and Celeste Watkins-Hayes, director of the Center for Racial Justice. Through the Masterclass in Activism, the Center for Racial Justice hosts noted activists and thought leaders who have made significant marks on the policy landscape.\n\nIn her new book Torn Apart, award-winning scholar Dorothy Roberts exposes the foundational racism of the child welfare system and calls for radical change. In conversation with Celeste Watkins-Hayes, Professor Roberts will share more on her book, and her belief that the only way to stop the destruction caused by family policing is to abolish the child welfare system and liberate Black communities.\n\nThis virtual event will have a live watch party in Weill Hall, Room 1110. A free copy of Professor Roberts’ book, Torn Apart, will be provided for attendees at the viewing party on a first-come first-serve basis. Attendance at this watch party is limited to current University of Michigan students, faculty, and staff. All attendees will be required to complete the ResponsiBlue screening before entering the building, and masks are required. Registration is required to attend.\n\nDemocracy & Debate presents Emmy® award winning producer and multi-faceted artist, Mike Ellison with Detroit percussionist and producer D-Love for a live performance and interactive discussion: Song for Democracy.\n\nBorn in Ethiopia and raised in Reston, Virginia, Ellison fully realized himself as an interdisciplinary artist in Detroit. His music and spoken word draw from myriad life and cultural influences - and are imbued with the musical landscape and traditions of his birth country. His song “Ethiopia: Everything Will be Alright” became a national hit in Ethiopia in 2004 and his most recent music video “WEY FIKIR (Alleh)” addresses the war in Ethiopia raging for over a year through the lens of love and a romance.\n\nMike’s artistic expression moves beyond the realm of music. His acting credits span film, theater and television with recent appearances on 50 Cent’s STARZ series BMF and NBC’s Chicago Fire.\n\nDriven by the power of art to inspire, inform and provoke dialogue, Mike’s music and words address a range of issues from social justice and civil rights, to the importance of community and collaboration. Join us for an exciting evening as Mike Ellison uses live performance, music and multimedia with Detroit percussionist and producer D-Love to engage with Song For Democracy.\n\nThe study of water ethics and justice is inherently without boundaries; it moves among various connected disciplines, such as philosophy, law, history, engineering, and geography. This event brings together academic professionals, policy experts, other practitioners, and the general public to discuss this most pressing issue. The transdisciplinary nature of water justice requires study that intersects ethical, scientific, cultural, and justice-related themes and concerns which are reflected in the presentations and discussions of this conference. Our opportune location at the US-Canada border lends itself to vibrant study of water ethics, justice, governance, and management in each respective country, as well as between them. Further, this event brings together professionals to discuss these water issues in the face of climate change and the implications for cross-border/transboundary water governance; hence, the speakers are from Canada and the US (with the majority from the US-Canada border region in Michigan and southwestern Ontario).\n\nDates and Location: Over two-half days March 22-23 at the Michigan Union (and, most likely, online in a hybrid format to accommodate COVID-19 issues).\n\nFaculty and experts will provide information about the war in Ukraine. University of Michigan students and community are invited to join the discussion. The teach-in will be presented as a Zoom meeting, allowing for Q&A following each presentation.

While the 2022 MUSE Conference is expected to be an in-person event, we may pivot to an online format according to any changes in public health guidelines.\n\nThe annual flagship event of the MUSE Initiative, the MUSE Conference provides a unique venue for sharing research, building new connections, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration among all members of the University of Michigan community who are engaged in a broad range of sustainability and environment-related research. We welcome the involvement of U-M undergraduate and graduate students, as well as University leadership, faculty, and research fellows from all disciplines, including those in arts, humanities, engineering, and natural and social sciences.\n\nWith the theme of this year, Sustainability and Environment After Catastrophe, MUSE would like to explore resolutions to current global challenges, such as climate change and the pandemic, and envision together ways to begin rebuilding during and beyond catastrophe. To this end, we welcome proposals addressing the following questions, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n- What defines catastrophe, and who gets to decide?\n\n- How can we assess existing systems’ vulnerabilities to catastrophe?\n\n- How can pre-catastrophe planning and post-catastrophe response better inform each other?\n\n- How can stakeholders cooperate (socially, politically, economically, technologically, or institutionally) to increase their capacity to adapt to catastrophe?\n\n- What is the role of sustainability research in ensuring just and inclusive recoveries from catastrophe?\n\nThe heyday of the human rights movement—the 1990s—is well behind us. At its peak, the human rights movement was the most captivating ideology of its time. It punctuated public discourse with a rhetorical command rarely seen, even in the more repressive states. But the power of the movement today is a but a pale shadow of itself. Some argue that the age of human rights is over. Yet that is hyperbole. It is clear, however, that for its many successes, the human rights corpus has met with many failures. It began as part of the colonial project of Empire, wittingly and unwittingly. Its deficits include its cultural illegitimacy in many places around the world, including the West; its inability to address economic privation; the movement’s impotence as material for liberating the globe of racism and related inequities, especially for peoples of Black African descent; and its glaring normative incompleteness. Are these problems fatal to the future of human rights movement? Is it doomed to go the way of previous dominant ideologies? Where can it go from here to achieve its fundamental and still critical purposes?\n\nUndoing Racism is a community collective of students, staff, and faculty in the School of Social Work dedicated to fighting white supremacy at the individual, school, and structural levels.\n\nThis workgroup was established in 2019 after students, staff, and faculty took part in the People’s Institute for Survival and Beyond Undoing Racism© workshops. Since then, the Undoing Racism workgroup has been working to implement the People’s Institute anti-racist community organizing model – recognizing that community organizing within our school is critical to move toward an anti-racist and anti-oppressive program to bring along all members of the community.\n\nThe Undoing Racism workgroup also emphasizes the role that white members of our community must take on to dismantle and undo white supremacist structures that benefit and maintain power for white people. Our work has largely been focused on building collective community – a fundamental step in the People’s Institute organizing model. Our dialogue and strategic planning to advance towards an anti-racist and anti-oppressive program and school community must begin with building relationships and strengthening community bonds to engage in internal and external anti-racism work.\n\nCollege and Beyond II: Virtual Colloquium Series\n\nAdvocates of liberal education argue that it has a positive effect on both individual achievement and the public good, so that its benefits accrue not only to graduates but to their local communities and the broader society that they help to shape. In 2021-22 the College and Beyond II Public Colloquium Series is exploring the links between liberal education and its outcomes, with a particular focus on democratic engagement. What is the role of liberal education in sustaining a democratic society? Can particular features of undergraduate education be linked to how likely graduates are to vote, to volunteer, and to engage in activism, both in college and beyond?\n\nThroughout the year, researchers and leaders of projects focused on better understanding and increasing democratic engagement will discuss ongoing efforts and new initiatives. Seminars in Winter 2022 will further explore the enduring impact of liberal education by featuring research conducted with the College and Beyond II dataset, which contains rich data about students’ experiences in and beyond college and will open to researchers in June 2022.\n\nJanuary 6, 2022, marks the one-year anniversary of the assault on the U.S. Capitol by those protesting the results of the presidential election.\n\nTo examine the events surrounding the election and to consider its long-term consequences, Detroit Public TV is presenting a one-hour special that evening at 8 pm Eastern, “Election 20/20: Detroit to D.C.” The centerpiece of the program is a video created in collaboration with the Detroit Free Press focusing on election night and the vote count over the next few days, as the nation’s eyes turned on Detroit and weary poll workers faced angry protestors pounding on windows of the city’s major convention center trying to disrupt the process.\n\nIt was a scene with rare precedent in American history, and it set the stage in many ways for the violence of January 6. During the election count, Detroit Free reporters and video journalists provided unparalleled coverage of these events, and they tell a harrowing, startling story in this video of democracy on the verge of chaos.\n\nThe DPTV special also includes interviews with Rep. Brenda Lawrence and Rep. Fred Upton, who were both inside the Capitol that day and who provide their own eyewitness account of events.\n\nFinally, Dean Michael Barr of the U-M Ford School of Public Policy and Detroit Free Press Editor and Vice President Peter Bhatia provide a thoughtful analysis of the issues posed by the election and its aftermath – the rampant spread of misinformation, the ongoing attacks on the credibility of the electoral system, the importance of a trusted media to a healthy democracy and what this all means to our nation going forward.\n\nModerated by Christy McDonald, the managing editor and anchor of DPTV’s “One Detroit” news team.\n\nThe growing use of algorithms is increasing concerns that they may discriminate, but mitigating bias requires designers to take account of protected characteristics. If they do so, are those efforts a form of discrimination? Put concretely, if model builders take race into account to prevent bias against blacks, have they engaged in discrimination against whites? Some scholars assume so, and seek to justify those practices as valid forms of affirmative action. This Article argues that they are starting the analysis in the wrong place. Rather than assuming disparate treatment has occurred, we should first ask whether race-aware strategies constitute discrimination at all. Despite rhetoric about colorblindness, some forms of race-consciousness are widely accepted as lawful. Because creating an algorithm is a complex, multi-step process involving many choices, tradeoffs and judgment calls, designers might take race into account in many different ways, not all of which entail disparate treatment against whites. Only if a strategy constitutes disparate treatment is it necessary to consider whether it is justifiable under affirmative action doctrine. This difference in approach matters, because affirmative action programs bear a heavy burden of justification. Treating all race-aware algorithms as forms of disparate treatment reinforces the false notion that leveling the playing field for disadvantaged groups disrupts the entitlements of a previously-advantaged group. It also mistakenly suggests that, prior to considering race, algorithms are neutral processes that uncover objective truth about merit or desert, rather than properly understanding them as human constructs reflecting the choices of their creators.\n\nMIDAS Seminar Series\n\nThe growing use of algorithms is increasing concerns that they may discriminate, but mitigating bias requires designers to take account of protected characteristics.

Most well-known, per­haps, are the ​“Benin bronzes,” artis­tic and royal heir­looms made since the 13th cen­tury by highly spe­cial­ized met­al­work­ers in the King­dom of Benin (now south­ern Nige­ria). In 1897, British forces sacked the cap­i­tal of this pros­per­ous king­dom. They tore sculp­tures and plaques from the palace walls, and took them back to Europe, where the looted trea­sures were sold to muse­ums and pri­vate col­lec­tors. The royal court of Benin, Niger­ian offi­cials, and high-pro­file schol­ars such as Pro­fes­sor Chika Okeke-Agulu (Prince­ton) have been demand­ing their return for decades. Increas­ingly, muse­ums based in the Global North have been lis­ten­ing to these calls for repa­tri­a­tion, and some have pledged to return works from their col­lec­tions. To pro­vide a new home for the repa­tri­ated works, plans for a new Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA), are cur­rently in devel­op­ment with world renowned archi­tect Sir David Adjaye lead­ing the build­ing design project.\n\nOn the occa­sion of Wish You Were Here: African Art & Resti­tu­tion, a pub­lic inves­ti­ga­tion into our own col­lec­tion at the Uni­ver­sity of Michi­gan Museum of Art (UMMA), Sir David Adjaye and Pro­fes­sor Chika Okeke-Agulu will dis­cuss their cur­rent and recent projects that address how works of art may re-enter the soci­eties they were torn away from. Laura De Becker, Interim Chief Cura­tor and the Hel­mut and Can­dis Stern Cura­tor of African Art at UMMA, will intro­duce the event.\n\nCollege and Beyond II: The Outcomes of Liberal Education Colloquium Series\n\nThe Discussion Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Wisconsin Center for Education Research teaches instructors how to design and implement high quality discussion in their university classrooms. The speakers will explain the features of the course, why and how they created it, and the research that has informed the process. They will explain why students must “learn to discuss”—learn the skills of discussion—and “discuss to learn”—engage in discussion to learn key concepts and grapple with important issues.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nDiana Hess, Dean and Karen A. Falk Distinguished Chair of Education, School of Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nLynn Glueck, Program Director, The Discussion Project, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nTimothy McKay (Moderator), Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education; Arthur F.

In this session, Nancy Thomas, director of Tufts University’s Institute for Democracy & Higher Education, will discuss findings from the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement (NSLVE), as well as the conflicting forces at play in 2020—pandemic-driven social distancing, a backlash against President Trump, a national reckoning over racial injustice, defiance around voter access, new efforts by institutional leaders and faculty, and effective student organizing—and what it all means for democratic learning across disciplines, healthy political campus climates, and planning for the 2022 election and beyond.\n\nZoom – Registration Required: https://umich.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_f5XhPfX4RdOCsvvEUD3MBw\n\nOpening Event Speakers:\n\nNancy Thomas, Director, Institute for Democracy & Higher Education, Jonathan M.

And while the black-cast musical is usually named as such, the necessary complement on the other side of the color line—the white-cast musical—is typically granted the unmodified moniker “the musical.” (Eliding race in this way is, of course, a classic expression of whiteness.) This talk names the white-cast musical as such by identifying aesthetic, structural, and industrial forms of whiteness in the output of two major figures: Fred Astaire and Stephen Sondheim. Drawing on forthcoming work on both men, Dr. Todd Decker uses a variety of methods to identify and describe Astaire’s and Sondheim’s distinct and particular types of whiteness. Adding precision to this inquiry, he draws on digital humanities methods that quantify the extent to which whiteness dominates the history of the American musical.\n\nTodd Decker (Ph.D., University of Michigan, 2007) is the Paul Tietjens Professor of Music, American Culture Studies, and Film and Media Studies at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nWatch via Zoom (link forthcoming)\n\nFree and open to all - online only\n\nIn 2018 Michigan voters approved a Constitutional amendment to change how redistricting is done in the state, removing the process from the purview of the state legislature and placing it in the hands of a new Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission (ICRC). The amendment also prescribes priorities the ICRC must address when drawing new district maps, placing the concept of “communities of interest” (COIs) near the top of the list.\n\nWhile COIs have been a part of redistricting in other states, this is a new concept in Michigan, and is not yet widely understood. This webinar will help educate stakeholders about COIs: what they are, the role they will play in Michigan’s new redistricting process, and how they can strategize and engage effectively in that process.\n\nThe event is co-sponsored by the Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy (CLOSUP), the Program in Practical Policy Engagement, Detroit Public TV, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, and Voters Not Politicians, the citizen-led grassroots organization that spearheaded the effort to pass the amendment.\n\nJanuary 29 - Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Eric Foner\n\nIn Conversation\n\nPausing for a moment of post inaugural reflection, following one of our nation’s most contentious presidential elections, this conversation brings together filmmaker, scholar, journalist and cultural critic, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. with prominent historian Eric Foner to contemplate how a divided nation comes together. The two will discuss Reconstruction, the all-too-brief period following the Civil War when the United States made its first effort to become an interracial democracy. The period saw the Constitution rewritten to incorporate the ideal of racial equality, but ended as a result of a violent backlash that erased many of the gains that had been made, with consequences we still confront as a nation. The program will also preview Gates most recent project, The Black Church, which will premiere on PBS in February.\n\nHenry Louis Gates, Jr. is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African & African American Research at Harvard University. Professor Gates is an author and filmmaker whose work includes Reconstruction: America after the Civil War, winner of the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award, and the related books, Dark Sky Rising: Reconstruction and the Dawn of Jim Crow, with Tonya Bolden, and 2019 New York Times Notable Book, Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow. Gates’ groundbreaking genealogy series, Finding Your Roots, is now in its sixth season on PBS and has been called “one of the deepest and wisest series ever on television,” leveraging “the inherent entertainment capacity of the medium to educate millions of Americans about the histories and cultures of our nation and the world.” Gates is the recipient of an Emmy Award, a Peabody Award, an NAACP image award, an MacArthur Foundation “genius award,” and in 1998 he was the first African American to receive the National Humanities Medal. Gates was named to Time’s 25 Most Influential Americans list in 1997, to Ebony’s Power 150 list in 2009, and to Ebony’s Power 100 list in 2010 and 2012.\n\nEric Foner, DeWitt Clinton Professor Emeritus of History at Columbia University, is one of this country’s most prominent historians. Professor Foner’s publications have concentrated on the intersections of intellectual, political and social history, and the history of American race relations. One of his best-known books includes Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877, winner of the Bancroft Prize, Parkman Prize, and the Los Angeles Times Book Award. His latest book is The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution . Foner has also been the co-curator, with Olivia Mahoney, of two prize-winning exhibitions on American history: A House Divided: America in the Age of Lincoln, which opened at the Chicago Historical Society in 1990, and America’s Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War, which opened at the Virginia Historical Society in 1995 and traveled to several other locations.\n\nLynette Clemetson is the Director of Wallace House, Knight-Wallace Fellowships and the Livingston Awards at the University of Michigan. A longtime journalist, she was a correspondent for Newsweek magazine in the U.S. and Asia, a national correspondent for The New York Times, and senior director of strategy and new initiatives at NPR. Wallace House works to sustain and elevate the careers of journalists, foster civic engagement, and uphold the role of a free press in democratic society.\n\nThis event is part of the Democracy & Debate theme semester with support from Wallace House and the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. It is also part of the 2021 U-M Reverend Martin Luther King Junior Symposium.\n\nJoin us for an interdisciplinary group of U-M experts in conversation on our new Vice-President, Kamala Harris. This discussion, one of the final events of the Democracy & Debate Theme Semester, marks the historic results of the 2020 election season. As the Theme Semester concludes, a new administration will take office under extraordinary circumstances. While this election season has wrought charges of voter suppression, claims of irregularities, and violence in the service of vastly unproven assertions of fraud, for this event we place our primary focus on Kamala Harris, who will make history on Inauguration Day, January 20th. She has broken barriers in American politics and will serve in office during a moment marked by a global pandemic and economic hardship, as well as by an upswing in nativist sentiments, racism, and a politics of exclusion. Harris brings a wealth of experience — as a former US Senator and state’s attorney general — and a cluster of identities — as a Black woman and a woman of South Asian descent, a daughter of immigrants, a graduate of a historically Black university, a mother within a blended family — to a role that she will inevitably reframe in the years to come. With an introduction by Provost Susan Collins, Edward M. Gramlich Collegiate Professor of Public Policy, professor of economics, and former dean of the Ford School (2007-17), the panel will feature: Annette Joseph-Gabriel, Assistant Professor of French and Francophone Studies and Editor of the Global Black History section of Public Books; Ian Shin, Assistant Professor of History and American Culture (Asian/Pacfic Islander Studies); Angela X. Ocampo, Assistant Professor of Political Science and Faculty Associate, Center for Political Studies and Latina/o Studies; Michelle May-Curry, PhD Candidate, American Culture; and closing remarks by Jasmine Williams, a senior in the Ross School of Business and member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., Beta Eta (UM) chapter. Ruby C. Tapia, Department Chair of Women’s and Gender Studies and Associate Professor of Women’s and Gender Studies and English Language and Literature, will moderate. This panel promises a rich discussion on the diverse histories that intersect in this moment, as well as its meanings for the communities Harris embodies and for the nation as a whole.\n\nSponsored by the Democracy & Debate Theme Semester; Departments of Women’s & Gender Studies and Afroamerican & African Studies in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; the Institute for Research on Women and Gender; the National Pan Hellenic Council - University of Michigan Chapter; and the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated- Beta Eta Chapter.\n\nPublic monuments, public spaces, and museums shape the shared understanding of our nation’s history. From the removal of Jim Crow-era statues of Confederate leaders in cities across the country to the opening of the Legacy Museum and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, AL, a dramatic shift in our perceptions and ideas about the complex heritage of our monuments and museums has occurred over the last five years. More recently, the country has considered the role of monuments and the narratives they perpetuate with much greater focus and intensity in light of the protest movements for social justice and against systemic racism that swept the nation in summer of 2020. In honor of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, join us for an important discussion with four national experts on the power that monuments and public spaces assert in creating our nation’s stories. Mitch Landrieu, former Mayor of New Orleans; Earl Lewis, founding director of University of Michigan’s Center for Social Solutions; and Kristin Hass, Associate Professor of American Culture, will discuss the crucial role practice and policy play today in shaping our nation’s legacies, in a conversation moderated by Christina Olsen, director of the University of Michigan’s Museum of Art.\n\nUsing dance, drag, drama, and documentary elements, A Beautiful Country chronicles 150 years of Asian-American immigration history. Miss Visa Denied, a transgender drag queen and performer, is the narrator who guides the audience through the turbulent history of Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese people coming to America. Heartfelt testimonials and the dramatization of some highly vibrant and egregious pieces of propaganda showcase the provocative events that have shaped this history. Addressing issues of race, gender, and appropriation, this play examines the fundamental questions surrounding the immigrant experience, including what it means to be an American.\n\nThis production was filmed over two weeks in the Arthur Miller Theatre and various remote locations according to the School of Music, Theatre & Dance’s approved safety plan. All safety protocols for the performing arts to prevent the spread of Covid 19 were observed. The production will receive its premiere on Facebook and be available for one week on YouTube beginning on Wednesday, December 2nd.\n\nView the video HERE\n\nPresenters: Co-editors Jessica Namakkal (Duke), Mark Bray (Rutgers), Eric Roubinek (UNC Asheville) and Giulia Riccò (University of Michigan)\n\nRespondents: Federico Finchelstein (The New School); Victoria de Grazia (Columbia University)\n\nContributors to this issue of Radical History Review study histories of fascism and antifascism after 1945 to show how fascist ideology continues to circulate and be opposed transnationally despite its supposed death at the end of World War II. The essays cover the use of fascism in the 1970s construction of the Latinx Left, the connection between antifascism and anti-imperialism in 1960s Italian Communist internationalism, post-dictatorship Argentina and the transhistorical alliance between Las Madres and travestí activism, cultures of antifascism in contemporary Japan, and the British radical right’s attempted alliance with Qathafi’s Libya. The issue also includes a discussion about teaching fascism through fiction in the age of Trump, a reflection on the practices of archiving and displaying antifascist objects to various publics, and reviews of recent works on antifascism, punk music, and the Rock Against Racism movement.

Due to the narrow margin of votes between the two presidential candidates, on Friday, November 6, Georgia’s Secretary of State declared a recount would be necessary. Moreover, Georgia’s mandate that a candidate cannot be declared victor without winning 50% of the vote has resulted in both of the races for the U.S. Senate being subject to a run-off between the two candidates that received the most votes. First-term Senator David Perdue (R-GA) will face Democrat challenger Jon Ossoff, and Senator Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), appointed to the Senate last year, will run against Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. The events in Georgia are garnering national attention, as the balance and control of the United States Senate hinge on the results of these two races. Please join two U-M experts for a lively conversation as they discuss the historic elections in Georgia and answer questions you might have about their implications on the national level.\n\nView the video HERE\n\nHistorically, election results were not declared on the night of Election Day. Indeed, it’s only been in the last 40 years, with the advent of television news, that organizations have “called” the election on the night of voting, and that “call” is not an official result. All votes have to be counted, the Electoral College process needs to unfold, and, at times, as we saw in 2000, the results might be contested in the courts.\n\nWhat does it mean to contest the results of a presidential election in the courts? How could such a process end up in the Supreme Court, and what are the implications of such a possibility with the new composition of the Supreme Court? Join two experts in the litigation of election results – Law Professors Samuel Bagenstos and Ellen Katz – for a lively discussion that will provide background and context to such an outcome in presidential elections.\n\nView the Conversation HERE\n\nThe night before the 2020 General Election, let’s gather for a virtual dance party with music, PSAs and special guest appearances to celebrate democratic engagement across the partisan divide. Featuring performances by local favorite Sabbatical Bob, Kektus, Nova Zaii with Kultur Grenade, and the legendary Detroit-based techno-wizards Inner City.\n\nFor those that voted early and for those headed to the polls on November 3rd – push your furniture aside, keep socially-distanced, and remember we’re all Wolverines on the virtual dance floor.\n\nSponsors include Democracy & Debate Theme Semester, the Residential College, the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, UMMA, the Ginsberg Center, and MUSIC Matters.\n\nThis event is free and open to all members of the U-M community and the general public.

The events of August 11th and 12th during Charlottesville’s “Summer of Hate” have also produced a group of iconic images that the mass media relies on to signify the violent and emboldened racist hatred of the “Unite the Right” rally and its aftermath. In analyzing and comparing the most frequently circulated photographs, I want to suggest a similarity in the narrative that these frequently circulated photos tend to tell about the struggle for racial justice. A photo of the terrorist car attack that killed Heather Heyer won the Pulitzer Prize. Why? What is this horrifically chaotic, violent, almost visually incomprehensible photo communicating? Why is this image reproduced over and over again? How is it thematically and visually similar to iconic images from the civil rights era? How and why does it matter that our photographic record encourages us to remember key events around race and white supremacy in particular ways?\n\nEvent Landing Page HERE\n\nThere is no video available for this event.\n\nWhat’s on your playlist? How does music change us and the world around us? In the last five decades, popular music has played a prominent role in social change, protest, and the demand for equality for all. From Jimi Hendrix “Star Spangled Banner” at Woodstock, Marvin Gaye’s seminal “What’s Going On,” Bruce Springstein’s “Born in the USA,” and Childish Gambino’s “This is America,” artists for years have used music to shine light on disparities in our country. While these calls, at times misunderstood, have seeped into the national consciousness, the use of this music – from the homogonzied industry itself and pop culture – has often not addressed the very social issues that drove its creation. Join us for a discussion about music and social justice with four extraordinary people who have dedicated their careers to the power of music to make change. Ken Fischer, President Emeritus of the University Musical Society, will introduce Ismael Ahmed, founder of the Concert of Colors; Brandon Victor Dixon, Broadway performer whose roles include Aaron Burr; Mike Ellison, Detroit musician; and Louise Toppin, Professor of Voice in the School of Music, Dance, and Theatre and vocal artist. Detroit notable and WDET music host, Ann Delisi will moderate the conversation, discussing music, playlists, and social change.\n\nSpecial feature – students, suggest your contributions to a playlist for social change! We’re compiling the Democracy & Debate Social Justice playlist on Spotify, and we want your voice to be heard! Enter your suggestions here.\n\nView the video HERE\n\nPhilippa P.B.

The scale and sophistication of Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 elections have been well documented and perhaps its most effective efforts centered on the use of numerous social media platforms to promote then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and also to foment and heighten social and political divisions within the United States. Recently, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) warned Russia, China and Iran are all taking measures to influence the November elections, although using a separate set of tactics and techniques and with different goals and aims.\n\nProfessor Thomas Rid and former Special Advisor for Cyberspace Advisor Richard Clarke will bring their decades of experience on foreign influence and cyber security to discuss best practices, policies, and approaches to prevent or limit the impact of any such efforts.\n\nView the Zoom recording here\n\nIsabel Wilkerson, a journalist and the first African-American woman to receive the Pulitzer Prize in journalism, was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama in 2016 “for championing the stories of an unsung history.” Her book The Warmth of Other Suns won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction and her new book, Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents, has been chosen for Oprah’s Book Club.\n\n“This work shows that the term racism may be insufficient in our current era. We need new language, a new framework for understanding our divisions and how we got to where we are. Caste gives us this language. Caste allows us to see ourselves through a different lens and the chance to work toward healing from the wounds of artificial hierarchy. We must first see it to begin to resolve it.”\n\nTold through intimate personal narratives and deeply researched history, Wilkerson examines the ties between the American caste system and those in India and Nazi Germany, and points to ways America can move beyond our artificial and destructive human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.\n\nKen Burns has been making documentary films for over forty years.
