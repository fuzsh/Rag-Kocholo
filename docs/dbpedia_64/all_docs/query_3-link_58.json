        "text": "The Blaisdell Award, one of the most prestigious awards given to Pomona alumni, recognizes individuals for their high achievement in their professions or community service. These are alumni who have carried the spirit of the College beyond the Gates and lived up to President James A. Blaisdell's inscribed words: \"They only are loyal to this college who departing bear their added riches in trust for mankind.\"\n\nRecipients of this award are selected by a committee of Past Alumni Board Presidents.\n\nThe Awards Committee shall name the award winners following a confidential process that does not share information about nominees or outcomes. The Committee and the Alumni Association do not respond to nominations or provide any explanation for the process of the Committee. In addition, the Committee may choose to select from current year nominations or past years’ nominations.\n\nPlease note, special consideration is given to nominees whose class is in an anniversary reunion year. For 2024, that includes all classes ending in 4s or 9s.\n\nBlaisdell Award Winners\n\n2024: Anson “Tuck” Hines ’69, Evelyn Nussenbaum ’84, Mary Walshok ’64\n\nEstablished in 1990 and inaugurated in 1991, the Alumni Distinguished Service Award is bestowed annually to an alumnus or alumna in recognition of that person’s direct selfless commitment and ongoing volunteer service to Pomona College.\n\nThe purpose of this award is to pay tribute to an alumnus or alumna for unheralded, selfless and direct service to the College, in evidence over a period of years. Every effort is made to seek a recipient who has not otherwise been already honored and care is given to select worthy candidates from Pomona’s vast alumni body, with first consideration given to those who have not served in the Alumni Association’s highest leadership positions, as trustees, faculty or staff of Pomona.\n\nA committee of Past Presidents of the Pomona College Alumni Association Board selects the award recipient(s).\n\nPlease note, special consideration is given to nominees whose class is in an anniversary reunion year. For 2024, that includes all classes ending in 4s or 9s.\n\nDistinguished Service Award Winners\n\n2024: Thomas Doe ’71, Verne Naito ’77, Julie Siebel ’84, Jonathan Siegel ’84"
