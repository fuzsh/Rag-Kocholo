        "text": "Warning! Lots of dessert talk coming up. Trust me, I rarely eat dessert at home.\n\nAfter spending 10 days in Catalonia, off to Bordeaux we went to meet up with our British friends Richard and Pauline. From the pastry standpoint, canel√©s are the iconic Bordelaise treat and the company Baillardran the most recognized name for these caramelized mini flans.\n\nI make canel√©s on occasion and am thinking it‚Äôs time to do that again, particularly after tasting them in Bordeaux. Here‚Äôs a post I wrote on them quite awhile back. On this trip I learned from our French friend Marie (who attended university in Bordeaux) that one can choose canel√©s on a scale of 1 to 3: 1 being less baked/lighter in color and thus a less caramel-y, crispy exterior and 3 being most baked with a darker caramel crust of sorts. The interiors will be more soft and custardy with 1 and less so with 3. Get it? This was also confirmed by French friend Valerie who prefers the darker caramelized exterior. To each her own.\n\nI had no idea that canel√©s are used to create more elaborate desserts. But why not, eh? Below are three different versions of ostensibly the same canel√© profiterole dessert experienced at three different eateries - quite a contrast I think.\n\nThe first was for Steve and Richard at our hotel - an interesting approach with canel√©s split in half, topped with ice cream and accompanied by Chantilly and chocolate sauce. They enjoyed it. I wondered about calling them profiteroles . . . when in Rome.\n\nTraining from Bordeaux to Agen and then by car to R&P‚Äôs home in Mouchan (near Condom in the Gers d√©partement de Gascogne), we spent a couple of days enjoying and appreciating their hospitality. Our visit was short but lovely after spending many nights in hotels.\n\nWe happened to be there on a Sunday, a day when many French enjoy a proper Sunday lunch out. We went to an auberge/chambre d‚Äôh√¥te out in the beautiful Gascon countryside where we were presented with the formule for the day. Water/wine already at the table, aperitif, amuse bouche, three courses (starter, plat principal and dessert), coffee and digestif all included (all for 31 euros, about $33). The food - absolutely scrumptious with a depth of flavor hard to be beat. It left us well satisfied without feeling stuffed to the gills.\n\nHere‚Äôs where I made an interesting decision. Since I typically don‚Äôt order dessert (and rarely eat it at home), I spent a little time debating about ordering one at all. I went for the assiette gourmand, described to me by the staff as small (note I said small) portions of each of the five desserts on the menu. I love tasting, what can I say!\n\nThe image below shows you what I was faced with. As an aside, I noted that our table received some interesting looks from other diners (and even the staff) when the dessert was delivered as if to say ‚Äúis she really going to eat all of that?‚Äù.\n\nIce cream and Chantilly cream played a large role in this assortment, as you can see below. From the left going clockwise: cr√™pe de noisette wrapped around ice cream, topped with chocolate sauce; apple croustade (my portion seemed to be from a corner of the pan without too much apple); profiterole (ahem - more ice cream); gratin√©e framboise - custard topped with raspberries and a sprinkle of sugar then run under the broiler. In the center - ice cream, rum sauce, Chantilly cream and some crunchy bits.\n\nMany of us pursue baking simply for the love of it - I know I do. Believe me, I know how fortunate I was back in 2006 to attend pastry school in both Florence and Paris. As a new career and later-in-life endeavor, it was exciting, emotionally charged, exhausting at times and well worth it.\n\nThough I‚Äôm both ‚Äúhome schooled‚Äù and professionally trained, it‚Äôs not a search for fame or fortune that keeps me in the kitchen. Trying new things, reading about how others approach their craft, tweaking a recipe to create a different flavor combination all help to keep me coming back for more.\n\nI find the process - planning, prepping and baking all the way to tasting and sharing - so calming and rhythmic. Even cleaning up, when all is said and done, is its own rite. Everything washed/dried, organized and stored in it‚Äôs own place, ready for the next baking adventure.\n\nAfter that extensive Danish Kringle post (whew!) I knew it was time for a break with a quick note on a fun and delicious dessert experience.\n\nThis past weekend we celebrated Steve‚Äôs birthday in isolation, enjoying a tipple of champagne followed by his famous marinated flank steak on the grill, roasted little potatoes and a veggie mix of edamame and last summer‚Äôs freezer stashed sweet corn. Mmmm mmmm good.\n\nAs luck (or the fates) would have it, I had choux puffs in my freezer that were originally intended for an event that was canceled due to the pandemic, and I‚Äôd been scheming about how I might use them. Since anything made with choux paste is on Steve‚Äôs favorites list, I knew they would have to be part of his birthday dessert.\n\nI recently posted on making chocolate chunk bars as a way of using up some of the chocolates I had in my cupboard. I still had some Valrhona milk chocolate on hand, as well as Carnation malted milk powder which I originally purchased some months ago to make brown butter shortbread cookies. Inspired once again by Claudia Fleming‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Last Course‚Äù, milk chocolate malted ice cream was officially on the menu. Profiteroles here we come!\n\nWhat a great plan ahead dessert. Make your choux puffs using your favorite recipe and stash ‚Äòem in the freezer where they‚Äôll be fine for some weeks. Make or buy any flavor ice cream you choose a few days, or even a week or two ahead and you‚Äôll be ready to assemble on the big day.\n\nI made my usual ice cream base and, once cooked and off the heat, blended in 113 g / four ounces chopped milk chocolate, 28 g / one ounce 64% Guittard chocolate discs and a scant cup of Carnation malted milk powder (sift before whisking it in). Then strain and chill.\n\nI usually keep my ice cream bases refrigerated for a day or two before processing. Once the ice cream is churned it needs a good 3-4 hours in the freezer to firm up. But you can make it ahead and it should be fine in the freezer for a week or two.\n\nOn the day you plan to serve the profiteroles, take out as many as you want, put ‚Äòem on a parchment lined sheet pan and warm them in a 300¬∫F oven for 10 minutes or so to thaw them and crisp them up a bit. Cool before slicing the tops open and filling with lovely scoops of frozen goodness. Then simply put them back in the freezer to hold until serving.\n\nFor a lovely ending to Steve‚Äôs birthday meal I just popped a few in each of our bowls, topped them with chocolate sauce, caramel drizzle and chocolate shortbread cookie crumbs et voil√† - un dessert tr√™s d√©licieux!\n\nThe next day I had empty puffs on hand and more ice cream so I filled them all and froze them for enjoyment later. I found that once they had firmed up over the next hour or two, I could turn ‚Äòem upside down while gently holding the tops on and dip them in a chocolate glaze made by melting 113 g / 4 ounces dark chocolate with 42 g / 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, then back into the freezer they went.\n\nIn case you‚Äôre wondering, I had a few crunchy topped puffs in the mix which I left unglazed.\n\nAnother thing that keeps me busy involves planning and preparing for my classes at Sur La Table in Grand Rapids. Things like figuring out the best way to set up the class for optimum hands-on experience, determining quantities of dough that might have to be prepped ahead for topics like croissants or artisan breads, orchestrating a smooth flow to the class with delicious baked goods as the end result. What‚Äôs not to like.\n\nBelow is a test I did for a no-knead rustic bread baked in a Dutch oven style enameled cast iron pot. The loaf on the right was done in a gorgeous Le Creuset 2.25 quart lidded saucepan (sorry the lid is missing from the picture!) and the one on the left on a sheet pan. Not only the rise but the crusty, golden, shiny surface of the one from the cast iron pan can‚Äôt be beat! NOTE: one pound of dough worked very nicely in this size pan, the taller sides giving just the right lift to the dough."
