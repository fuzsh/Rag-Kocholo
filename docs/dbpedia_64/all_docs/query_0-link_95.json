        "text": "Kyle Russell\n\nPhD in Aerospace Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nThe best advice I've ever been given is to think of research as a lifestyle rather than \"work\". To gain mastery over a topic, I have to spend many hours toiling over challenging concepts and problems, constantly looking for ways to better my own understanding. I do not get to mentally clock out in the afternoon and feel good about my productivity if I haven't made any progress towards internalizing a paper's findings or a textbook chapter. On the other hand, I definitely take time away from my studies and research to reset and rest.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nThroughout high school and college, I struggled in math. I got fine grades, but math took a majority of my study time and it never felt intuitive to me. In my freshman year of college, I got a B- in multivariable calculus which really made me question whether I was cut out to pursue a STEM degree. Regardless, I pressed on and chipped away at areas that didn't come easy to me. Even in advanced classes, I would regularly go back to review early calculus and linear algebra concepts on YouTube and in old textbooks. By the end of my undergraduate, I was getting A's in graduate-level math courses and the material felt natural to me. I began to not only grasp every concept I encountered but appreciate some of the beauty in it. Although not an individual event or project, my journey through math courses and personal growth is one of my proudest achievements.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nI had been in the process of building my own computer for months. I spent months coming up with a build, selecting parts, and assembling the hardware. However, COVID in conjunction with a surge in cryptocurrency mining led to a global shortage of graphics cards. Although not technically an impulse buy, I finally gave in and bought a GPU at a marked-up price, but I could not be happier with my decision.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nI synthesize nanofilms and find connections between microstructural changes and material properties. The synthesis process involves confining an argon plasma against a metal target which is, in turn, ablated forming a vapor; the metal vapor condenses onto substrates thus allowing for the precise design of nanofilms. I am particularly excited about this research because designing and manufacturing materials on the nanoscale stand to revolutionize entire industries including aerospace, energy, computer science, and space exploration. Furthermore, material science is an interdisciplinary field. I love connecting topics such as diffusion, plasma characteristics, and grain/phase boundary energy back towards my background in physics.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nIn high school, I truly fell in love with ecology. I don't have a particular occupation in mind, but work-related to maintaining national parks, coral reefs, or revitalizing land would be a dream come true.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nI would love to pursue a career in spaceflight technology development. Although not necessary, a PhD certainly helps in pursuing that passion.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nThe beach. Any beach.\n\nTry to find some hikes off the beaten path that might not be super popular. There are some great ones north of Malibu.\n\nK-town bbq\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nI will forever cherish the time I get to spend with the rocket propulsion lab out in the desert assembling and testing our rocket systems. Getting the opportunity to work with fantastic people on rocket engineering is something I will cherish long after I graduate.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI sang at Barack Obama's first inauguration as a member of the San Francisco Boy's Choir.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI plan to pursue a career in spaceflight research and development.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nAlameda, US\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nN/A\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. Andrea Hodge\n\nOrazio Pinti\n\nPhD in Aerospace Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nWhen I left my home country to move to the US, my grandfather told me to never look back in life with sadness, but always ahead with excitement and drive, while keeping a fond and grateful look in my rearview mirror.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI was the first person (and not the last!) in my family to graduate from college!\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nSki gear and the Ikon Pass\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nI am working at the interface between machine learning and computational engineering. This means I am developing and/or applying machine learning-based techniques to compute the numerical solution of different physical problems.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nIt would be a theoretical physicist. Alternatively, outside STEM fields, having a ranch has always had a certain appeal to me.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nQuality of education, diversity, USC staff reliability, and attention to students' well-being. Furthermore, Los Angeles is such a great place to live!\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nGriffith Observatory, The Getty Villa in Malibu, and Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes in Death Valley at night to see the Milky Way.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nReading and working outside my office, somewhere on the beautiful USC campus, during one of the many cloudless, sunny days of LA.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI love doing many sports, but I never watch any, and I know absolutely nothing about teams, championships, rankings, and so on and so forth.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI am not sure yet, but as of today, I would like to work in a company's R&D department.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nTermoli, Italy\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nN/A\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nProf. Assad Oberai\n\nJeffrey Asher\n\nPhD in Astronautical Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nBefore coming to USC I was working full-time at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. I\n\nrecall having just graduated from undergrad and being pulled into several working groups with\n\nsenior staff. I was usually quite shy in these meetings and rarely spoke up. One day one my\n\nmanager took me aside and told me “Jeff, you’re invited to these meetings because we want to\n\nknow what YOU think. You need to make sure your voice and opinions are heard.” I feel like I\n\nreally needed to hear that in that moment and really respected my manager for it. It’s\n\nsomething I keep in mind.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI think once I finish this degree, I’ll consider it my greatest accomplishment, but until then, I’d\n\nhave to say my work designing and building a CubeSat during undergrad. The spacecraft was\n\ncalled ELFIN, which stood for Electron Losses and Fields Investigation. I was the lead thermal\n\nengineer and lead systems engineer. Working with the small team of students and faculty on\n\nthat project really gave me my start in the space industry. Working on that project got me my\n\njob after undergrad, and I’m sure it helped with my application to USC. It was amazing to be\n\nwitness this spacecraft slowly come together over the years. The big culmination was when we\n\nall drove up to watch it launch out of Vandenberg Air Force Base. As of today the spacecraft are\n\nstill healthy and providing critical scientific data.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nI bought a DIY mechanical watch making kit. The funny part is that it was 100% a specifically\n\ntargeted Facebook advertisement that got me to buy it. I’m sure the advertiser was like: 20-\n\nsomething, male, engineer? – CHECK. Anyways, I really enjoyed assembling it and its still one of\n\nmy favorite watches.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nMy research is investigating the plume dynamics of a new type of spacecraft electric propulsion. These thrusters are called ionic electrospray thrusters, and what makes them special is that they offer a small, low power, and clean means of propulsion. This enables small spacecraft, like CubeSats, to maneuver while on-orbit. The plume that these thrusters generate consists of complex molecular ions of varying sizes and composition. This technology has little flight heritage currently, but several companies are beginning to invest more into it which is exciting.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nI’m assuming for this question that I’ll have to forego the space industry as well. In that case, I’ll say something like a board game designer. We are currently in a golden age of board games, and I think it would be fun to try and make a fun and interesting game. Maybe it can be space related?\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nI’m local to Los Angeles, so pursuing my degree somewhere close to family was a big factor. I chose USC specifically due to its unique Astronautical Engineering Department. Most schools do not have a dedicated department for space. The thought of a department of coursework and expertise just dedicated to spacecraft engineering really excited me.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nYosemite National Park – I’m big into the outdoors and hiking and cannot recommend Yosemite enough. It is beautiful.\n\nGriffith Observatory – A great place to hike, gaze out at the city, and learn some cool science!\n\nSimply Pho Noodle House in Orange, CA – My fiancé and I love pho. We have sampled a lot across LA and both agree this place is the best. A close second is Pho Show in Culver City.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nI will forever cherish the opportunity to present my final project to Buzz Aldrin. As part of my ASTE-527 final we had to pitch an innovative or disruptive concept for the future exploration of the Moon and Artemis missions. Little did I know that we would be having a special guest for the final! Being able to interact with such a meaningful figure in my career field is definitely something that will be with me for the rest of my life.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI’m an avid runner. I’ve trained for and competed in 3 marathons in: Chicago, Huntington Beach, and Washington, D.C. Running in the LA marathon is still on my list.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nAfter a long vacation, I plan to go back to full-time employment at my current job with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, supporting the US Space Force at LA Air Force Base. In addition, I hope to pursue opportunities for guest lecturing at USC within the ASTE department or other local colleges and universities.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nValencia, California, USA (just north of LA near Six Flags Magic Mountain)\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-asher-923497134/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. Joe Wang\n\nParisa Pouya\n\nPhD in Astronautical Engineering/Systems Architecting Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nNever give up and just keep going and exploring until things start working for you!\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI worked as an intern for General Motors company in 2020 and I was able to successfully demonstrate my research abilities and skills, which resulted in an ongoing collaboration between me and the research team at GM. As a PhD candidate who works on autonomous vehicles and their applications, it's always been my dream to join this industry in the future and I would consider my ongoing collaboration with GM as one of my biggest achievements.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\n3 pairs of colorful leggings for workout! The leggings (mostly the colors) really motivate me to workout. This has been really helpful in terms of both physical and mental health\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nMy research focuses on developing models and techniques for real-time planning and control of autonomous systems (e.g. quadcopters and autonomous vehicles) that operate in uncertain and noisy environments. Being able to develop models and techniques from scratch, experimenting with these models on real systems, and getting to see that the techniques and models actually work on real systems is what excites me about my research!\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nProbably a dentist!\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nUSC is well-known for its diversity, which makes it a great school for international students! In addition, the school's engineering programs/departments are always ranked high not only in the country, but also in the world. Finally, most of the professors at USC support their students with research and/or teaching assistantship funds.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\n1- Balboa island in NewPort Beach (California)\n\n2- Hiking places in Bay area and San Francisco (Fort Funston in Bay Area and Land's End trail in SF)\n\n3- Griffith observatory\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nCelebrating Persian new year with friends at the Electrical Eng. department\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI am very adventurous and love any kind of (positive) activity that boosts Adrenaline.. For instance, I love hiking in the dark, riding motor bikes, riding roller coasters, etc.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI am planning to join the industry, especially the automotive industry and my plan is to become a technical manager as soon as possible!\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nOroumieh (or Urmia), Iran\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ parisa-pouya-b434b4144\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nProf. Azad M. Madni (Astronautical Eng. Department)\n\nShatad Purohit\n\nPhD in Astronautical Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nThe best piece of advice that I have ever been given is to 'establish involvement without discrimination'. And, simply doing whatever is needed with total commitment and attention.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nOne of the most significant accomplishments in my professional life is getting admitted to the Ph.D. in Astronautical Engineering with a specialization in Systems Architecting and Engineering at the University of Southern California.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nA few months back, I got a low-tech mobile phone as a replacement for my old phone, which fell in a small river stream during a trek. I first thought I would only use this phone for few days. But I started liking it now!\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nI am currently a Research Assistant in the Distributed Autonomy and Intelligent Systems Laboratory. My research interests are systems architecting, complex system analysis and design, modeling and simulation, model-based systems engineering (MBSE), and integration of digital twins into MBSE. My research is about finding efficient ways to develop complex systems, specifically in aerospace, defense, and automotive industry verticals. I see many opportunities to apply the research in the context of the increasingly changing socio-technical world of today. My studies allow me to look at the situations in the world in a multidisciplinary and holistic way. There are general tendencies to simplify the problem to fit the existing methodologies, but systems architecting and engineering focus on expanding the methods to address the complex problems without dumbing problems down.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nI would choose studies of economics and ecology, as it is one of the most crucial challenges our generation faces worldwide. In general, ecological solutions are found to be against economic wellbeing, and economically feasible options are not ecologically sensitive. Therefore, it is essential to initiate the marriage of economy and ecology. If people see financial prosperity in ecological solutions, it can help scale the solutions rapidly, which is most required today. In my view, marrying economics and ecology is a transdisciplinary systems problem.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nBefore joining USC, I spent four years in the industry in the systems engineering domain. As a result, I was well aware of the ecosystem in terms of research, state-of-the-art, and best practices in academia and industry. When I was planning to come to the US, my first choice was USC due to the Systems Architecting focus of the program. This is the only program in the country with an explicit focus on systems architecting in the curriculum. Additionally, academics focus on model-based systems engineering, system-of-systems integration, engineering resilience, economics, case studies, machine learning, and advanced mathematics, which made the program most favored for me. I look at systems architecting and engineering as a necessary foundation to develop systems of the future. It should not be surprising to know that the domain originated in NASA. I enjoy working and studying the system's domain. Therefore, when I received the opportunity to pursue Ph.D., I readily accepted it. Additionally, the faculty members are the leaders in the discipline and are well known for their field contributions.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nI recommend Yosemite National Park, Sequoia National Park, and Joshua Tree National Park to incoming students because of the variety of ecological systems, terrains, and life forms they would get to see in these places. Mountains of Yosemite, trees of Sequoia, and landscapes of Joshua should not be missed by anyone living in California.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nI appreciate the incredible opportunities that I received in this fantastic university and in this beautiful country. It feels like a dream when a person like me from Latur, a small town from the diametrically opposite side of the planet, comes to LA, joins the astronautical engineering department, and starts working under the most sought-after researcher in the discipline.\n\nOn the first day of class in my MS program, I remember that on August 20, 2018, I had an appointment with Dr. Azad Madni. I prepared for the meeting as I wanted to ask whether any research assistantship opportunities are available in his lab. I already sent my previous research work and resume to him some time back. During the meeting, as I started speaking, before I could get a chance to ask, Dr. Madni offered me an opportunity to work with his team. This incident shaped my life the way it is today. Later I joined the Ph.D. program and received a full scholarship. It took care of many things for me.\n\nI always liked studying the engineering and systems domain. At USC, I spend time exploring the vast world of engineering and collaborate with experts associated with various organizations such as NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, Aerospace Corporation, General Motors, NSF, DoD, and US Air Force.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI can cook three distinct types of Indian cuisines - Rajasthani, Gujarati, and Maharashtrian. Rajasthan is a northwestern state of India known for its arid region and Thar desert. The cuisines are shaped by the availability of ingredients in the area. People eat low heat food with a variety of milk products and sweets.\n\nGujrat is a mid-western state with various terrains, from the Rann of Kutch desert, Arabian sea coast, to Narmada river basins. Due to this, the cuisine has multiple ingredients ranging from gram flours, vegetables, spices, and snacks that vary widely in flavor and heat.\n\nAs we move from north to south, the spiciness increases in cuisines. Maharashtra is a southwestern state with Sahyadri western ghats and numerous rivers like Godavari, Krishna, and Tapi. This results in the availability of a variety of spices for the cuisines along with millets, native serials, lentils, fruits, vegetables, and traditional grains.\n\nI cherish diversity and cook food with absolute involvement. In my view, cooking is like engineering complex systems. The final outcome is not merely a sum of its parts or ingredients. And to get the desired results, you need science and art.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI wish to work on advancing the field of systems architecting and engineering through my research in model-based systems engineering and digital twins. In addition, I see possibilities to apply my skills in the aerospace, defense, and automotive industry.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nLatur, Bharat (India).\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nwww.shatad.com\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nAzad M.

I realized that peace and happiness is what I ultimately am looking for and I have spent my time on things that makes me happy on both short and long term, including making other people happy which I have figured to be one of the things that makes me the most happy.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nMassage belt.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nI am working on enabling robots to learn how yo perform challenging tasks such as keeping balance, walking, running, and manipulating objects. I am extremely excited about it because the robots I work on get to be more and more similar to biological systems each day and are eventually going to make useful additions to a safer, more efficient, and more peaceful ecosystem.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nI think I would have chosen medical research.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nI really liked the idea that we are all part of a greater family called the Trojan family. Also, I was super happy to see how valuable each new student is to USC and to see they were there for me during all steps of my application and admission process.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nManhattan beach, Santa Monica Pier, and Some rooftop bars in Downtown LA.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nI remember the first time that the robot we were working on learned to kick its leg; It felt amazing! I don't have a baby yet but I feel like the feeling could be comparable since you feel like you have added something really beautiful to this world that can autonomously learn to do useful things.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nWell, I was born in Iran, grow up in Turkey, went back and forth between Iran and Turkey and am now in US. So, every time someone asks me where I am from, I have an interesting story to explain!\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI plan on staying on the same field and continue my research on AI and embodied intelligence in both academic and industrial capacities.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nTehran, Iran.\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nhttp://valerolab.org/marjani/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nProfessor Francisco Valero-Cuevas\n\nOctavio Marin Pardo\n\nPhD in Biomedical Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nI think a really good one is that it is always ok (and sometimes necessary) to ask for help; of course, after trying to sort things out within a reasonable time. Another one would be that it is essential to keep balance in life, that it is important to work hard but it is equally important to take care of oneself.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nJoining the universities of both my undergraduate and graduate studies; that is, the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the University of Southern California (USC).\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nI would like to think that the only one that counts as \"impulsive\" would be a video game I bought last year hehe.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nBriefly, my research focuses on using electromyography and electroencephalography in personalized biofeedback training to understand motor recovery after stroke. What I really like about my research is that allows us to get a better understanding of how the brain works, and to also use that knowledge to try to help people recover their motor function.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nEither guitar player or chef.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nAmong the many reasons to pursue a degree from USC, I would mention its strong graduate programs, its world-class faculty and facilities, and the wide range of resources it provides to do state-of-the-art research. I would also highlight its interdisciplinary focus and the collaborative environment it fosters.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nHiking to the Hollywood Sign, visiting The Getty museum, and going to at least one beach.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nAll the great food and cuisines I got to know here.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nThat I like musical theatre and have been to a good number of plays here in LA.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI am planning to continue doing healthcare-related research in a company, hopefully here in California.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nMexico City, Mexico.\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nSook-Lei Liew, PhD, OTR/L.\n\nWen Shi\n\nPhD in Biomedical Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nBalance passion and objectivity. Passion allows researchers to overcome all kinds of difficulties and search for breakthroughs. However, single-minded passion prevents us from maintaining objectivity. We may become blinded and biased by having too much passion or love for a specific project. We can’t fall in love with our research conclusions, otherwise we may become emotional and fail to think logically, leading to biases in our results.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI’ve made a handful of the most amazing, passionate, and supportive folks I am happy to call my lifelong friends in grad school. They are people who give constructive suggestions for my research projects, go with me on food adventures, share all my tears and laughter, and are there with me through thick and thin. They are the type of people who give you a hand when they see you drowning and in the next second share ridiculous PhD memes with you. They are both my cheerleaders and life mentors, and I am beyond lucky to have made them my friends.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nTamagotchi (a handheld virtual pet)! I never had a Tamagotchi when I was a kid, and now that I’m an adult, I’ve learned that it’s what the 7 year old me needed! It’s a nostalgic reminder of the 90s while still being super new to me. Though I’ve had a complete collection of the wild life in Animal Crossing, having a Tamagotchi means so much to me and is incomparable.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it\n\nI developed a visualization method to peer deeply into large-scale microscopy datasets in living organisms and enhance subtle spectral differences in images for disease diagnostics.\n\nThe first step to curing diseases is always to visualize an affected biological environment, and that isn’t always easy. Live biological systems contain a continuous complexity of interactions. Tissues, proteins and their functions within organisms are deeply intertwined. Scientists have been relying on medical imaging techniques to monitor temporal dynamics and spatial structures. However, these techniques come with limitations. One limitation is the lack of full-color spectral information. Another is the requirement for large amounts of data, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive. Our group developed an algorithm called Spectrally Encoded Enhanced Representation (SEER). It distinguishes subtle spectral differences, providing a fast, intuitive and mathematical way to interpret hyperspectral images. It can process multiplexed data across the full spectrum of colors for greater clarity and use much less computer memory as it relies on dimensional encoding to parse the data faster. It pushes beyond the capabilities of human vision and captures exceedingly small differences in the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe thought that my project may improve the way the medical field visualizes and diagnoses diseases and injuries is one of the major reasons that I am passionate about this project. It has shown me that I can apply theoretical bioengineering knowledge that I have long viewed as abstract to the many concrete problems that affect a vast majority of people.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nA gallerist. Being someone who not only brings and shows art to people but also supports and represents artists is fascinating to me.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nThe PIs and research projects at USC were the core reasons for me. There are so many highly reputed, inspirational academics in science and technology, and a lot of them are pioneers in their fields. They are driven and passionate. The projects they are working on are interesting and impactful at the same time. The skill sets and disciplines students develop along the way help them thrive within their careers and beyond. Besides self-development, I find the sheer joy of learning when I work on the project, it motivates me to be an inner-driven, independent thinker and I believe that’s something deeply profound.\n\nThe support system at USC was also a huge plus to me. USC provides rich resources to help PhD students achieve their goals. Not only are the faculty and students knowledgeable and sharing, but also there is a variety of specialized support staff behind the scene organizing these resources and supporting academics. It is a strong community and network of faculty, peers, and staff who have been helping to guide and support me throughout my PhD journey.\n\nLast but not least, Trojan connections! USC alumni are in all types of fields, and they are dedicated to helping out or uplifting their fellow Trojans. Joining the Trojan family is to join a network that is “lifelong and worldwide”. No matter where you end up, you can always find and engage with your fellow USC alumni. There is an association in almost every city, whether you are walking down Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles or sitting on the steps at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, or Tokyo, or Shanghai, you will find Trojans thriving and supporting one another.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nThe Getty Villa, Malibu beach, and of course any popular brunch spot with 5-star reviews on Yelp to spend your Sunday, lingering over eggs benedict or pancakes, preferably with a latte or mimosa in hand.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nWhen I was preparing for my screening exam, I was expected to give a presentation about my thesis project. There were lots of stressful and frustrating moments, and my lab mates supported me through the tough time. I can’t remember how many practice talks I’ve given, but I remember they were there every time. One night, two of my friends worked with me until 3am at the lab and we went through my 50-page long presentation slide by slide. They were so caring and supportive. If I look at the final version and my first draft now, I won’t believe they are referring to the same project, all because of the people who are unbelievably caring and supportive.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI love painting! I learned acrylic painting as a child, but I remember not liking it then. During the pandemic, I picked up painting again. Now I am making pieces for my graduation exhibit, and one of my dreams is to open an art gallery by the time I’m 40.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI plan on doing so many things. Visit my family in China and take them to the brunch place we always go to. Travel Europe, hold an art exhibit, help one of my best friends plan her wedding!\n\nProfessionally? Get an industry job in R&D. I am very passionate about translational sciences in medical imaging and I would like to improve medical imaging techniques and develop analytical tools to unravel the complexity of life sciences. I look forward to working on industrial projects where I can apply cutting-edge technologies in image processing and machine learning to make an impact on healthcare.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nXi’an, China\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/usc.edu/wenigma\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nScott Fraser\n\nPu Wang\n\nPhD in Biomedical/Medical Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nIf you know something may fail, let it fail fast. (This is the advice given by my PI when I discussed the potential problems of one method we were planning to use in our research. He encouraged me to try it instead of looking for reasoning why it might or might not work. It's a very important piece of advice for doing research especially in solving engineering problems.)\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nThe greatest accomplishment is not a specific achievement for me. Instead I think it is the ability and capability to solve problems by fast and efficient self teaching/researching and a systematic thinking of how to tackle problems. I think I can call myself a well-trained Ph.D. candidate because of that not because of specific paper/patents.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nIt's a CNC router I bought off Amazon. I wanted to start to learn how to fabricate metal parts after designing phase. I didn't know well enough about the constrains such as machine rigidity, work holding etc for making high tolerance parts so I got myself a CNC router. The router turned out to be a project itself since it has too many limitations. It seems to be a disaster and bad impulse purchase but I got the hands on experience with minimal cost. Now I have access to industrial level CNC machine and are able to make great parts for research and I use tons of knowledge learned from tweaking the router in my garage.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nMy research is building optical microscope systems that have the capability of resolving multiple fluorescent signals within live biological samples. What excites me about it is I get to build a system from ground up with integrating optical, mechanical hardware along with analysis algorithm and software prototype. It's another level of feeling of achievements when you know every aspect of your 'baby' and see other researchers to use it for their own research.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nI would choose to be a director of photography for filmmaking. I love capturing pictures and videos since I was a child. We are living in an era when so many great camera gears are affordable, for me, I really enjoy using them everyday as a way of storying telling. As a matter of fact, I created a Youtube channel Paul LA to share my opinion on filmmaking gears from a perspective of a serious filmmaking enthusiast. I would not hesitate to pursue a filmmaking career if I am not already an engineer.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nI got my master of engineering degree from electrical engineering department of USC. For me, choosing USC does have some personal preference as I am so familiar with this school. But most importantly, USC has one of the greatest engineering school in this country and the school can provide you with so many resources for you to achieve your research goals. At the end of the day, doing research especially in engineering field, resources to the tools, equipment etc are one of the most important factors, USC always have them. Another factor is the location. I love SoCal, the dynamic cultures, food, and weather are things you wont be able to find elsewhere. Also so many opportunities around when you graduate.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nCalifornia has so many places that are worth going, if I only recommend 3 places, as a Chinese immigrant, first place I would recommend going is always San Gabriel valleys, you will find a TON of great genuine Asian food there. It's only 15miles from the campus. You might also want to check out the mountains in San Bernardino valley like Big bear or Lake arrowhead if hiking or skiing if your thing. Also you want to check out the beaches in Long beach or Orange County which are beautiful. By the time you checking them all out, you will find here you have access to mountains, sea, best food all within 1.5hr driving\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nKobe used to describe his hardworking in training by seeing 4am LA every day. You will be proud of yourself by solving research problem till the mid of the night as a hardworking Ph.D. student. One thing I really cherish about the time is here in USC, the neon light from DTLA will always be with you when you work into late of the night.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI will look for an engineering position continue doing what I am good at after graduation.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nZhengzhou, China.\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nPhotography website: https://www.puwangphotography. com/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nScott E. Fraser and Francesco Cutrale\n\nCatherine Yunis\n\nPhD in Biomedical Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nNot advice but encouragement generally - I think there have been points in my life when I have been unsure about a big decision or the course of some work I've done and hearing positive encouragement from a professor has given me a huge boost in my confidence in myself and the work I'm doing.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nGraduating MIT. Getting through undergrad at MIT is very difficult.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nA backflow incense burner. I love watching the smoke trickle downwards and I've found some nice smelling new incense as a result.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nIn short, I study the relationship between touch, vision and walking. I am excited to learn the neuroscience between movement - how sensory inputs of the peripheral nervous system can influence commands sent by the brain to the body.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nI'd be an artist.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nThe location (love Los Angeles and California and the access to the medical device industry in SoCal), the potential for tech transfer from research to industry and the emphasis on and support for diversity at the school.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nBarnsdall Park in LA for the view, Point Lobos National Park south of San Francisco for the gorgeous scenery and a beach in Santa Barbara to feel like you're on vacation.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nBeing able to eat lunch with my friends/classmates in the Engineering Quad before covid changed the policies about who can be on campus.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI am very tall - about 5'9\". It's hard to tell over Zoom. I also like to change my hair color about every month or two.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nTo work for a research group at a large tech company or to start my own business.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nChicago, IL, USA\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nI am due to update this but for now I like to share this work from when I was in college: https://neuralfashion. blogspot.com/ or you can look me up on LinkedIn.\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. James Finley and Dr. Heather Culbertson.\n\nJia Hao\n\nPhD in Biomedical Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nWhatever you plan to do, start it early. Don't wait till everything is fully ready because it may never happen. This advice really helped me to fight against procrastination and better manage my time, especially through multitasks.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nIt would definitely be the successful completion of my first PhD research project. I was a materials science major for BS and MS, and starting my PhD in a highly bio-based lab was very challenging for me in the beginning. I literally had to google what everything means when I started reading papers in this field. Throughout the three years of this project, there have been countless trials and errors. And when I finally got this project completed, I realized I myself have grown quite a lot along with it.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nI got a mini blender last summer and loved it! Just throw in yogurt, frozen fruit and water, and you get a great smoothie in one minute!\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nI design innovative microdevices to study how hematopoietic stem cells interact with their bone marrow neighbors. I have always been fascinated by stem cells because of their endless potentials. What excites me most is that I get to be creative and innovative and utilize my knowledge in both biology and engineering. The knowledge we gain from my research can inspire novel treatments for blood and immune diseases.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nA singer!\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nFirst, USC is a prestigious university, and I was attracted by the research projects that my lab has. And secondly, definitely the city itself. We know PhD programs are usually long (4-5+ years) and it is essential to have a life outside your lab or work in order to keep your mind fresh. Los Angeles boasts cuisine from all over the world, mountains and beaches if you love nature, and all kinds of city activities. You will never be bored studying at USC :)\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\n1. BCD tofu house (my favorite restaurant in town!)\n\n2. Abalone cove shoreline (a unique beach park with clear shallow water and so many crabs on rocks);\n\n3. East fork trail in San Gabriel mountains (best hike for summer: get ready to cross shallow rivers)\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nI have been attending Zumba classes hosted at the USC gym every week for two years now. I am so grateful that even during the pandemic, USC still managed to keep workout classes available for all students- although Zumba becomes Zoomba :) I highly recommend our instructor Shira. She has the best energy and the funniest class. Working out with her has been my best way to release any stress from my work.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI am expecting a baby! Looking forward to having her in my arms during my Ph.D. hooding ceremony (Yay!)\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI plan to keep pursuing my passion in the biotech industry and work as a scientist (ideally in Seattle; that's my next destination).\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nChangchun, China.\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nwww.linkedin.com/in/jia-hao- usc/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. Keyue Shen\n\nJonathan Wang\n\nPhD in Biomedical Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nI would say the best piece of advice given is that: there is never a “perfect” time to start reaching for a goal. It will always be fruitful to start consistent progress towards a target, instead of waiting for a “perfect” scenario. This shifted my mentality to accept difficult times and problems that arise, and recognize it is a normal part of life. The successful ones are the people that just don’t quit on their goals.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI would say a very recent one, which is obtaining my PhD. I am the first PhD student under my advisor, Professor Eun Ji Chung, so I started my project from scratch and followed it through until publications. I was able to switch from a mechanical engineering focused undergrad into a biomedical engineering topic while learning all new skills and scientific workflows. In the end, I won the “best research assistant in biomedical engineering” award from Viterbi, which demonstrated that my contributions to the lab were recognized by the whole department. It was a great feeling to have that recognition, and put the lab in a position for future success.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nNot a very expensive one, but my girlfriend and I wanted to buy some Pokemon cards that were getting popular during COVID. We suddenly decided one weekend to look for them, and we went to 4-5 stores before finding them. A Target had them restricted behind the customer service desk, and we bought all three packs they had left that day.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nMy research aims to use nanoparticles to treat disease, specifically a genetic condition called polycystic kidney disease. Nanomedicine in general was once very obscure in the eyes of the general public, but now it is reaching more widespread appeal due to the COVID vaccines being nanoparticles. I think many industry research and development roles are now realizing the potential of nanoparticle drug delivery platforms. During my time at USC, I saw the landscape of PKD treatment shift dramatically, which is so exciting to see that I work can directly impact patients receiving treatment in the future.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nIdeally, (if money weren’t an issue, and I were talented enough), I would want to be on a professional urban dance team. The team I admire the most is called Kinjaz; they are based in Los Angeles so I would strive to make it as a member.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nDefinitely my advisor, and the energy she brought to all the research topics she presented on. The chance to directly head my own project was a huge draw, as I would be working on the chemistry, cell work, mice work, and all steps in between. It turned out to be true that I gained a huge breadth of skills for my target industry of biologics production.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nI would recommend: The Grove/Farmers Market for upscale shopping, Little Tokyo for Asian food, and Santa Monica beaches.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nI would say going on each of my academic conferences, particularly the year Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) trips. It would always be fun traveling with other lab members, and touring each new city.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI ride a motorcycle, and think it is one of the most thrilling/liberating feelings I can have.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nWorking in the biologics and pharmaceuticals industry in California, I am currently interviewing with a couple companies.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nSan Jose, CA.\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nNot personal, but our lab website can be found here: https://chunglaboratory.com/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nProfessor Eun Ji Chung\n\nAbdullah Aljasmi\n\nMS in Chemical Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nDo not stop research!\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nMy greatest accomplishment in life, is completing my PhD in chemical engineering at USC with a time period of 3 years.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nMy favorite impulse purchase over the past 12 months is my new car, that I was planning to purchase from 4 years ago.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nAdvances in instrumentations, together with rapid increase in the speed of computations, have made it possible to begin simulation of multiphase flow in 2D and 3D images of heterogeneous porous media, hence avoiding altogether the assumption and approximations that are involved in the development of models of porous media. However, as image-based simulation of multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media becomes more practical, one must still address the issue of its high computational cost. In this chapter we described a new methodology to address the issue, which is based on curve-let transforming the image and denoting it by removing those details of the image that do not contribute significantly to the simulation. The computations in the less noisy, and hence more coarsened images yield results that are as accurate as those in the original ones, but with a very high speedup factor. Thus, the methodology represents a significant step toward achieving the ultimate goal of such simulations, namely, making image-based simulation of multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media a standard practice. What makes me excited about my research is its novelty. As it is a new methodology for efficient simulation, and I was very excited to discover new ideas and approaches to tackle one of the most challenging problems in my field of study.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nI am really into legal law, so if I would choose another profession for sure I will go to the Law school.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nThere are many factors that helped me to decide to pursue my PhD at USC. First, USC is considered one of the world class prestigious universities. In addition, it is located in one of the most wonderful places in the world, Los Angeles. Also, the staff and faculty members are very helpful supportive and knowledgeable.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nOf course, Disney Land, Hollywood Universal studious and San Francisco golden gate bridge.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nMy greatest memory is my wonderful time that I spent with my friends Saleh and Hatem and enjoying the hot coffee with them.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI have never went shopping, I buy all my stuff online!\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI have returned back to my home country, to join the Faculty at Kuwait University.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nZahraa, Kuwait\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nProfessor Muhammad Sahimi\n\nJose Cobena-Reyes\n\nPhD in Chemical Engineering\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself\n\nI am originally from Guayaquil, Ecuador. My bachelor’s degree is in chemical engineering, and after graduating, I worked for a few years as a Production Supervisor at a company called Holcim in Ecuador. I have always wanted to study abroad, so I took my chance and I came to USC.\n\nWhat attracted you to choose USC for your graduate studies? It’s a world class university and the research I’m doing here is related to my interests, which is a mixture of chemical engineering and computational research.\n\nTell us about your interests outside the classroom.\n\nCurrently, I serve as the Graduate Student Representative for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) Chapter at USC. I plan activities tailored to our Hispanic graduate students. Our most popular event is Painting Night! We gather together to paint on small canvases, it is very relaxing.\n\nLast year, I served as part of the Center of Engineering Diversity Advisory Board at USC. We held meetings were we gave feedback and shared our concerns about the needs of our communities.\n\nDuring my free time, I play the guitar. I also love watching soccer and movies.\n\nHow has SHPE helped you grow? In so many ways. Professionally, thanks to SHPE I have learned networking techniques, how to follow up after meeting someone either by email or by Linkedin, how to approach people in networking events; in general some social conventions that we should apply when we attempt to grow our network. Socially, there are always opportunities to connect with other Hispanic graduate students during the SHPE events. That helped to make more friends!\n\nTell us about some exciting and unforgettable incidents from your two years at USC.\n\nRelated to my research, the publication of my first paper was incredibly important to me. I worked for a year and a half on it before I was able to finally publish it.\n\nI would also say that my networking skills have strengthened thanks to many workshops I have attended. I’ve been able to expand my network considerably and meet many new people.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people about you? I also have a master’s in business administration!\n\nOverall, how has the PhD journey been at USC? I would say that it has been probably one of the most fruitful experiences in my life. I have grown a lot, both personally and professionally. Studying abroad in Los Angeles and at USC has been a great time learning about other cultures and about myself and learning how to conduct world class research.\n\nWhat are your future plans after completing your Phd? My aim is to do research either in the semiconductor or chemical industries.\n\nWhat innovations/discoveries do you hope to see (or be a part of!) in the next ten years? The computational techniques that I use are currently moving towards a combination that involves machine learning to either predict material properties or to accelerate molecular simulation. I think exciting times about this are coming.\n\nKylie Trettner\n\nPhD in Chemical Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nThe best piece of advice I've ever been given is to always carry around a notebook. Though I suppose the true advice is what that implies: to write everything down. Writing out my thoughts and reasons why I want to try things (in terms of research) has been so helpful! Not only do I have a handful of notebooks (I'm really organized so each one serves a different purpose) but I've also found that typing up notes to myself when I need to get an idea out quickly is so helpful as well.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nSince I'm still working toward earning my PhD, I'd have to say my greatest accomplishment was running TSP DIY last year (TPS = The Speed Project). It's normally a relay-style race from the Santa Monica Pier to the \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign, but because of COVID we did it around Santa Monica and Beverley Hills. I ran 31 miles at 6:27 average mile pace over the course of the 31-hour 45-minute race with 8 other women. It was incredible and I can't wait to run the real TSP relay next year!\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nI don't impulse buy! I have to stick to my budget and I usually plan out my bigger purchases a few months in advance to spread them out. Once in a while I'll be tempted by the Madewell sales or buying a few more books than the one that I'm looking for, but if I can't fit it in my budget I don't buy it.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nMy research is a very interesting mix of materials science, electrical engineering, microscopy, and cancer biology! I'm currently working on creating both a magnetic hydrogel system and electromagnetic microscope mount to be able to use and applied magnetic field to change the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. I'm using this as a tumor microenvironment model to study howincreased material stiffness (modulus) changes the biological properties of cancer organoids grown in the hydrogel matrix. Eventually, I'll use this to study the cellular secretion profile and pair the system with a mechanotransductor to get both biological-only and material/organoid interface read-outs. I'm excited to work on engineering solutions to study biological effects and I've found myself working in the biophysics field - an industry I never knew existed until I began designing my project - and it truly forces us to push the boundaries between engineering, physical sciences, and biology to unlock the fundamental properties of fibrotic diseases.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nI would hands down be a professional athlete. I was a student-athlete in undergrad and I'm really involved in the running community here in Los Angeles and if I was ever given the opportunity, I would jump into full-time training.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nBeyond USC's location, I saw within USC the opportunity to truly forge my own path. Part of this is because I recognized my PI's encouragement for collaborations (both within and outside of USC) and actively pursued an institution that would support me but also give me the freedom to create at the same time as investigating biologically-inspired questions.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nThere's too much to pick for all of California, so I'll limit it to a ~4 hour drive from LA. I absolutely love Death Valley National Park! In LA, the Santa Monica Mountains are probably where I spend most of my weekends (cycling through, but hiking and running are incredible there too) and while I'm talking of mountains, the access to various national forests is great here too (Angeles National Forest and San Bernardino and a few of those mountains are often my cycling destinations for Saturdays as well). My third place would be Ginger's Divine Ice Cream on Washington in Culver City; it's probably the best ice cream I've ever had!\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nA memory I'll always cherish from USC actually happened during my visit weekend. It rained the whole day we toured campus and spoke with professors. Once I got out of my final meeting (with my current PI) and went to head back to the hotel, a rainbow popped up across campus I ended up walking back through campus under it. I think it was a sign haha!\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI was on Good Morning America when I was in middle school on accident. I went to watch the Fray perform, but during the interview with Steve Martin (he was promoting the Pink Panther movie) they decided to ask the crowd to try and repeat things in his character's accent. They came up to me! After I did it, the hostess turned to Steve and said, \"I guess the accent isn't so hard!\" which I took to mean I did pretty well.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI'm really not sure what I want to do after graduation! I have a couple more years and right now I'm not sure if I want to continue my career doing benchwork or transition to a more consulting-type position. I love problem solving and building but I also really love science communication and public speaking, so I know I'll have to find the right position that will give me a good balance of both.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nWading River, NY, USA\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ kylietrettner\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nProf. Andrea Armani\n\nGhena Alhanaee\n\nPhD in Civil Engineering\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself\n\nI am from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates where I grew up and spent my formative years all the way to completing my bachelor’s degree at The Petroleum Institute in Abu Dhabi (now renamed Khalifa University). I was always interested in physics and math and after some exploring, found myself intrigued by mechanical engineering which ended up being my maopr for my undergraduate studies. Throughout my studies, I grew more and more interested in the energy sector and had the opportunity to pursue a master’s in energy resources engineering at Stanford University.\n\nWhat attracted you to choose USC for your graduate studies? I then decided I wanted to continue working on and pursuing research in the energy and environment field, with a specific focus on my hometown and the surrounding region (the Persian Gulf). At the time, UAE had just announced they were constructing 4 nuclear reactors to diversify their energy sector. This would be the first time any of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries would enter the nuclear sector, and this really shaped my decision on what I wanted to focus on for my PhD research. I ended up finding an opportunity to work on research focused on my interests at the Civil & Environmental Engineering Department at USC, which brought me to Los Angeles.\n\nTell us about your interests outside the classroom.\n\nOutside of the classroom, I love taking advantage of the beautiful Californian weather, spending time outdoors, going on hikes, and enjoying the sunshine.\n\nTell us about some exciting and unforgettable incidents from your two years at USC.\n\nI am now starting my sixth year at USC (hopefully my last!) and have had the opportunity of meeting people from all sorts of backgrounds and countries and cultures. I have really enjoyed connecting with people from all walks of life and different corners of the world, that I wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity to do.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people about you? Something that might surprise people about me is that I am an avid traveler. Whenever there is a vacation or even a long weekend, you will probably see me in a new city, new state or even a new country.\n\nWhat are your future plans after completing your Phd? After completing my degree, I am open to possibilities and opportunities and will see what comes my way (after taking a long much-needed vacation).\n\nWhat innovations/discoveries do you hope to see (or be a part of!) in the next ten years? I hope to see and be part of finding more sustainable ways to provide energy and protect the environment. I think we can definitely do better.\n\nAgnimitra Dasgupta\n\nPhD in Civil Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nMake a choice and commit to it.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI once won a bet of having ice cream for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nOn a serious note, I am proud that I have published before.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nAn ergonomic chair. It was expensive, but has really helped with back pain from working long hours in front of the computer, and in hindsight completely worth it.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nThe core theme of my research is quantifying uncertainties associated with inverse problems. More specifically, I am trying to characterize material heterogeneities from noisy response measurements, I believe my research has philosophical implications and has wide-ranging applications ranging from medical imaging (dealing with things that are hard to see) to structural health monitoring (where the scale is many times larger).\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nGrowing up, I wanted to be a chemist. I still harbor that interest.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nBriefly, the ongoing research in my department, my advisor, the security of the Fellowship I was offered and the location of the University.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nIf you are in California, you should not leave without visiting Yosemite.\n\nI would also recommend San Francisco, I think the city has an interesting vibe. Catch the sunrise or sunset from Battery Spencer with a view of the Golden Gate bridge, and later you can either take a sip of Irish coffee at the Buena Vista Cafe or enjoy some ice cream or chocolate at Ghirardelli square.\n\nMore locally, Santa Monica beach is a nice place to enjoy sunsets.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nI will miss my friends and roommates from my time at USC.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI have a superpower; I can chop onions without tearing up\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI wish to remain in academia after I graduate. I will probably be looking for post-doctoral opportunities.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nKolkata, India.\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nhttps://adasgupta94.github. io/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nProf. Erik A Johnson, Sonny Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.\n\nMert Oytun\n\nPhD in Civil Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nNever think about what other people might say when making a decision.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nSome can assume that granting one of the most prestigious scholarships, the Fulbright scholarship, must be the greatest achievement in my life; however, it is not the case. One of my greatest accomplishments was transcending Bosphorus from Asia to Europe by swimming around 6.5 km. I firmly believe that these challenging activities pave the way for exploring oneself and ease reaching the other achievements in life (e.g., academic and social success in life).\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nCar and air fresheners because they make my memories more permanent.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nTo put it briefly, my research focuses on the acquisition, modeling, and analysis of the data needed for user-centered built environments by developing novel algorithms and visualization techniques. More specifically, I focus on the Human-Robot interaction and related technologies in Civil Engineering. What excites me in my work is that I strive to explore the unknown with an interdisciplinary approach.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nIt would definitely be a finance-related field because (1) I am delighted with making good guesstimates, and (2) the world revolves around finance, whether we admit it or not.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nOne of the most important factors is that our university had a very strong and competent academic staff. In addition, the strategic privilege of our university's location has also played an essential role in my decision to pursue a Ph.D. at USC. Thanks to this privilege, USC offers us the opportunity of networking with leading institutions and organizations in many fields, primarily in technology.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nHighway 1, Beverly Hills, and San Diego.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nExploring the statues at USC. I also like the Fight song, which is the basis of our universities' motto, \"Fight on!\".\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nAlthough I am a realistic person, I love to dream.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI am open to the opportunities that life offers me. For this reason, I believe that plans should not be static.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nAnkara, Turkey.\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nhttp://www.mertoytun.com/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. Lucio Soibelman & Dr. Burcin Becerik-Gerber.\n\nRuying Liu\n\nPhD in Civil Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\n“In the moment when the coin is in the air, you suddenly know what you are hoping for.”\n\nI always flip a coin in my mind when I make hard decisions.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI won the Charles Innes Prize in our department in my senior year at the University of Edinburgh. The prize awarded annually to the foremost student in the Honors course in the final year. It is not my first time being the foremost student in class. But winning this price in my last year at Edinburgh did not only give me a happy ending of my undergraduate life, but also has become a huge encouragement for me. When I faced difficulties, this prize reminded me of my achievements, the unforgettable memories in the windy Scotland, and the invaluable support I’ve received in the past. All these boost my inner strength to pursue my next goals.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nGaming chair.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nMy current study is on humans, emergencies, and the built environment. As a multidisciplinary topic, it involves studying human building interaction in the context of different disasters with technologies such as virtual reality. My research provides significant insights in enhancing occupant safety and facilitating evolution of the built environment in satisfying human needs.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nI would choose Language and Literature. I enjoy reading and learning new languages. I may become a publication editor or a novel writer.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nUSC invited me to the campus visit and I met my advisor in person. She is a very supportive advisor and a reputable researcher. During the campus visit, I was attracted by the friendly ambience of the university as well. A place with sunshine, lovely people, beach, and music will never bore me in the next 5 years.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nApparently 3 places are not enough. My top 3 is Golden Gate Bridge, California State Route 1, Malibu beach especially the amazing sunset.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nI joined USC when the Covid-19 hit in 2020. Unfortunately, I was not able to participate in many social events or spend much time on campus. But I do cherish the experience working with team members on class projects. Even with online zoom meetings, we made good communications and excellent teamwork.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nWhen I was in high school, I became a member of the Calligraphers Association of our city.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nFind a postdoc position or a faculty position.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nTangshan, China.\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nBurçin Becerik-Gerber.\n\nAudie Lee\n\nPhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\n“Think you are the best” my advisor, Dr. Qiming Wang, said. Delivering my screening exam presentation, I shrank and choke before committee members. Everyone could readily figure out I was frozen solid. After it ended, my advisor kindly explained me in detail why I should be or, at least, try to look confident when presenting my idea (basically, no one buys yours when you don’t look like buying yours), and the best way to do so is to think I am the best. At that time, I could understand why he had sometimes told me “Audie, you are smart” or “you are doing great” in the lab – an aha moment. He had been planting seeds of confidence in me for about two years (gosh, I was too dull to figure it out early). Well, in fact, this advice itself is one that everyone can give out easily. But that advice from him reflects his long observation and thoughtfulness towards me – the best piece of advice.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nIf my future children say ‘I wanna become a grown-up like my dad,’ that must be the greatest accomplishment ever in my life.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nSome Nintendo Switch game cartridges – I don’t have Nintendo Switch and have no plan to get one lol Doesn’t this make you laugh already? Well, just thinking “Someday I’m gonna play it so hard” makes me feel better when I get stressed. I didn’t purchase just a bunch of game cartridges, instead, I bought a collection of (well-sugarcoated) mood shifters.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nMy research fields include mechanics, wave propagation, metamaterials, and some novel structures. Does it sound like civil engineering topics? Most people usually think that civil engineering is all about soils, rocks, construction, earthquakes, and water. Right, but not ‘all.’ Surprisingly, due to many efforts for interdisciplinary research, the intersection area between research fields has been emerging wide – and that’s where something new is likely to come about. I mix civil engineering, mechanical engineering, materials engineering, and physics all together to bridge novel ideas with reality. Becoming an explorer looking for a treasure chest full of groundbreaking ideas, doesn’t it excite you?\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nPaleontology. Trojans love Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones, right? Forget that Dr. Jones is actually an archeologist. Harrison Ford in Jurassic Park, that’s what I want to be in my second life. Hmm, Han Solo in Jurassic Park is also not a bad idea.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nSupport from USC. USC always tries its best to offer students an optimal environment for research. Especially, I have been more than just satisfied with the assistantship that USC provides. With all concerns about money-related issues excluded, I can only focus on my research during my Ph.D. career. I profoundly appreciate USC and proud alumni for their financial support.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nGriffith Observatory: While many tourists perceive it as just one of the popular places in L.A., it comes to me as something like home where I can freely visit and blow away all the stress with the cool breeze, looking at the grid of the city.\n\nEl Taurino: It’s one of the best Mexican restaurants in L.A. Luckily, it’s right next to USC. Just go try burritos there. Further words are a waste of ink.\n\nUCLA Rose Bowl: Watching Trojans vs. Bruins football match at Rose Bowl is the best thing you can do in L.A. – Trojans never lose.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nIn early 2020, a tragedy visited my family, and I was withering away like barley plants during the Dust Bowl period. But my Ph.D. colleagues and USC staffs picked me up from the dust swamp. Their support was the rope of hope I could hold on to get out of that depression. It was the spirit of ‘Together We Fight On.’ This memory will never fade away.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nNothing. My life has been boring, especially during the COVID-19 period.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nPursuing postdoctoral researcher position and faculty position.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nBusan, South Korea\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ audielee/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nDr. Qiming Wang\n\nSara Babakniya\n\nPhD in Computer Science\n\nWht’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nWhile it is good to listen to many advice, there is no best advice for you. Your life and situation are unique, and you are the one who has to consider all the critical factors and decides what's the best to do.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nAdmission to my dream university/major for B.Sc.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nHome decor items, one morning, I realized I don't particularly appreciate how my home looks and purchased some home decors, and I must say now my apartment feels more like a home to me.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nCurrently, I am working on the privacy and security of machine learning. The fact that I am working on real-life problems and any possible enhancement impacts the world is my first motive. Also, personally, I prefer to work on the intersection of theory and programming, which I am doing right now.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nSocial scientist.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nCombination of university reputation, location, field, quality of research.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nEveryone should visit the beaches, Griffith observatory and Hollywood sign.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nI went to the USC - ASU football match in the LA Memorial Coliseum, and I truly enjoyed every part of it.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nWhile I enjoy talking to people for hours and hours in person, answering my phone is almost impossible for me. Most people think that I am highly extravert, but I am not.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI have always dreamed of being a faculty member. I hope I can be one after my graduate studies.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nRasht, Iran.\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nwww.linkedin.com/in/sara- babakniya\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nProf. Leana Golubchik.\n\nWei-Cheng Wu\n\nPhD in Computer Science\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nDon't make big decisions because of someone else (like your girlfriend etc), cause you'll probably regret it.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nNone. Stay hungry stay foolish.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nI bought a LaunchPad! A whole new way to make music.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nMy research focuses on computer security, specifically binary analysis. I think it is exciting as it really pushes us to think outside of the box. Companies or software developers always try to provide a perfect system, while hackers can always still find ways to comprise it. Then people will come out with new techniques to mitigate the vulnerabilities. As a security researcher, we must have the mindset of both sides and keep challenging the current technology.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nI guess a guitarist. Although I feel like making music is also engineering in many ways\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nI think the only factor is the research area. I am accepted to a lab that does research I am really interested in.\n\nAnd I am still happy about the decision so far.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\n(1) Dockweiler beach: You can have bonfire aside the beach\n\n(2) OUE Skyspace LA: Must see, the DTLA night view\n\n(3) Bike from Venice beach ~ Santa Monica\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nI think it's a bit hard for me to answer this question at the current stage. Let me save this question till I graduate.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI practice Aikido.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nFor career I definitely plan to work in a US Tech company for a while. Honestly no further plan for now (well who knows how the world will be like by then). I've always just prepared myself as best I can at anytime. When chances come, I will know what to do.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nTaipei, Taiwan\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nhttps://steel.isi.edu/members/ weicheng/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nJelena Mirkovic\n\nBasileal Imana\n\nPhD in Computer Science\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nPlan tomorrow the night before. I am not sure if I can call it the best but it has certainly been very useful. The advice also extends to planning for goals to accomplish in a week, a month, a year, or even a decade.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI would say pursuing my Ph.D. this far, and the internships I got the opportunity to do along the way.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nThe closest thing to an impulse purchase I have done recently is buying Airpods -- they have made my life much easier.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nMy current research focuses on auditing advertising platforms that deliver job ads to ensure they do so in a fair way across demographic groups. It excites me because it has positive societal implications for millions of people that use such platforms to learn about employment opportunities.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nIt would probably be architecture -- I used to like doing freeform sketches and enjoyed working on my technical drawing projects when I was in high school.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nIt was a combination of several factors. The main ones were the financial package (USC awarded me a fellowship), the match with my research interests (there were at least a few potential labs I could see myself joining), and the location (LA is close to where my brother lives).\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nI would recommend visiting Torrey Pines beach in San Diego (an amazing place to see a sunset), a road trip on CA Highway 1 (which runs past many places worth seeing across the Pacific), and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nDuring the start of my second year at USC, I ran into someone that introduced me to a Christian church community called ICA that became like family shortly after.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nMy mother, father, and I all have different last names due to the difference in naming conventions used in Ethiopia (my home country) and in the US.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nIn the short term, I plan to work in industry research. I am also very interested in teaching and would like to explore doing that in the long term.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nI was born and grew up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nhttps://ant.isi.edu/~imana/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nAleksandra Korolova and John Heidemann\n\nRey Pocius\n\nPhD in Computer Science\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nThe best piece of advice that I’ve ever been given is...when confronted with an amazing opportunity, say yes, if you don't know something, roll up your sleeves and just do it. Any opportunity to keep learning is invaluable.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI consider my greatest accomplishment to be winning a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. I received the fellowship during the first year of my PhD and it embodies all of the work that I put towards research in my undergraduate studies and during my first year at USC.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nA new USC sweater. Fight on!\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nMy research is on synthetic location data generation, what excites me most about this area of research is the possibility of creating synthetic data generators that can account for sparsity within incomplete datasets.\n\nIf you could choose any other profession outside of engineering or computer science, what would it be?\n\nIf I could have chosen any other profession it would have been to be an architect. I grew up outside of the city of Chicago and lived in a town with incredible architecture.\n\nWhat are some factors that helped you decide to pursue your PhD at USC?\n\nUSC has a very strong collaborative culture and is at the heart of the exciting city of Los Angeles. Many of the students and faculty who I met during the visit days were extremely supportive and high energy. The facilities and faculty at USC are world class.\n\nIf you were to recommend to an incoming student 3 places to go in California/Los Angeles, what would they be?\n\nKoreatown, Newport Beach, San Clemente.\n\nWhat is a memory you'll cherish about your time at USC?\n\nThe Computer Science department's annual holiday party.\n\nWhat's one thing about you that might surprise me?\n\nI am an artist. I paint with oils and acrylics.\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI plan to pursue research engineer and software engineer positions within industry related to my research.\n\nHometown (city, country):\n\nElmhurst, Illinois.\n\nPersonal Website (if any):\n\nhttps://reypocius.github.io/\n\nFaculty Advisor:\n\nCyrus Shahabi.\n\nSepanta Zeighami\n\nPhd in Computer Science\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?\n\n\"Find your niche\". I think big pictures are important, but it's easy to get lost in them. Starting small and finding a niche that you can become an expert in helps a lot in building up to the visions one has\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\n\nBeing able to work on what I'm passionate about.\n\nWhat's your favorite impulse purchase from the past 12 months?\n\nArtificial grass, pull-up bar and a tent. We built a gym in our front yard.\n\nPlease describe a little about your research and what excites you about it.\n\nI'm working on replacing databases with neural networks, basically how the human brain stores information. The goal is to store data more efficiently and answer queries on the data faster.
