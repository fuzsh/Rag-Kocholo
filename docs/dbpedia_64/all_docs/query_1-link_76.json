        "text": "Nicholas J. Costa, age 39, of Manchester, Michigan, formerly of Antioch, California.\n\nNicholas Costa, son of Joe Costa and Lynn Edwards, was born March 3, 1982 in Concord, California.\n\nA skilled mathematician, dog lover, avid rock climber, and keen ornithologist, Nick grew up in the Bay Area, attending public school in Antioch, CA, where he learned baritone saxophone and earned the U.S. Navy’s Edward Teller Award in 1999 for physics. He then went on to graduate college at Cal Polytechnic in San Luis Obispo, CA in 2005, with three degrees: Electrical Engineering, Physics, and Mathematics. He was a member of the National Association of Collegiate Scholars in the early 2000's. His electrical work was at 10 atoms. He designed the electrical system for a guided missile launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base.\n\nMoving periodically to other places, he spent most of his years in Antioch, California, where he was closest with his father. His final two years had been spent in eastern Michigan, where he moved to find new opportunities as an engineer. 11 months ago, he was welcomed into his new church family at Zion Lutheran Church and by his trusted companions, Lori and Andre Marcoux. During their time together, there was bird watching with Andre, hiking with the dogs, geeking out about our glacial landforms, and eating Lori’s dinners, including pumpkin pie.\n\nNick had an insurmountable love for his dogs, Jake and Rocko. He found joy and humor in solving and understanding math formulas and equations, with comprehension skills far beyond most others. His big heart, risk taking, and passion for problem solving is what made him such a distinct and unique individual, of which we will all miss dearly.\n\nHe departed this life on Wednesday, February 9, 2022.\n\nHe leaves to cherish his memory: his mother, Lynn Edwards of Pineola, North Carolina; his father, Joseph Costa of Antioch, California, his step-father, Owen Edwards of Pineola, North Carolina; his brothers, Devin Costa of Tygard, Oregon, and Thomas Edwards of Pineola, North Carolina; his aunts, Linda Costa Britt and Patricia Costa Gilleaudeau, his uncle, Gabriel Gilleaudeau, his cousins, Geoffrey Gilleaudeau, Jaminda Costa Springer and her husband, Bryan C. Springer, Esmin Costa Britt and his wife, Sara Britt, his 2nd cousins, Gabriella Springer, Bryan K. Springer, Alberdina Springer, Benjamin Springer, Charlotte Springer, Beatrix Britt, Lily Britt, Simon Britt, Grace Britt, and Florence Britt.\n\nA funeral service will be held on Monday, February 14, 2022, 2:00 p.m., at Zion Lutheran Church in Chelsea with Pastor Kurt Hutchens officiating. Visitation will be at the church on Monday from 1:00-2:00 p.m.\n\nArrangements by Staffan-Mitchell Funeral Home."
