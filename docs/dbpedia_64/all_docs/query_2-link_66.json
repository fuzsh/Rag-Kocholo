Shepherd '41, on June 4, 2008, at his home in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was eighty-eight.\n\nRichard was an economics major and a member of Delta Tau Delta. He later attended the University of Michigan law school. Richard served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II and was assigned to the 21st Weather Squadron. He earned several battle stars for his service in Europe. He worked in market research for Procter & Gamble for forty-one years, retiring as manager of field operations. In the 1960s, he worked in Paris, France, as manager of the market research department there. Richard loved to sail and was a commodore with the Cowan Lake Sailing Association.\n\nIn a 1990s return to the campus with other World War II veterans, Richard provided a cautionary word to students: \"Today, when I see the politicians haranguing a crowd of people, I keep thinking, 'Yes, listen to what is said, but don't swallow it whole.'\"\n\nRichard was a generous donor to the College. His wife, Virginia Jergens, established the Richard G. Shepherd Lecture in Economics in 1986.\n\nRichard is survived by his wife; children Wendy Beck von Peccoz and Richard Shepherd; step-children Andrew Jergens and Peter Dine-Jergens; four grandchildren; and four step-grandchildren.\n\nMemorial gifts may be sent to the Richard G. Shepherd Lecture in Economics, Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio, 43022.\n\nLewis F. Treleaven '41 P'71 H'91, and a former Kenyon administrator, at his Mount Vernon, Ohio, home, on April 6, 2008. He was eighty-nine.\n\nA history major, Lewis was co-captain of the football team, a member of the debate and swimming teams, and a member of Beta Theta Pi.\n\nHe went on to serve with the U.S. Marine Corps for nearly twenty-seven years, forging a career that took him through combat in the Pacific Theater during World War II and managerial achievements in the postwar era.\n\nHe started as an artillery specialist and soon found himself engaged in fierce fighting. As part of the First Marine Division, he participated in six combat landings, including the campaigns at Guadalcanal in 1942, Cape Gloucester in 1944, Peleliu in 1944, and Okinawa in 1945. During the course of the war, he rose in rank from second lieutenant to major. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his courage and ingenuity on Peleliu, where he was able to keep six artillery battalions supplied with ammunition, firing continuously, during the thirty-three-day campaign. Among his other awards were the Bronze Star, the Navy Commendation Medal, and the Purple Heart (he was wounded by a Japanese sniper on Okinawa). His Marine career embraced the wars in Korea and Vietnam as well as the intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965. Many of his assignments involved managerial and administrative challenges. From 1952 to 1955, he served on the staff of British Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, in Paris. Later, he served as a data-processing officer, developing the Marines' first mobile data-processing installations. He retired as a colonel in 1968.\n\nTreleaven made his second career in higher education. After a stint as assistant dean at the Northwestern University Law School, he returned to Kenyon as registrar in 1971. Serving as the vice president for development from 1973 to 1975, he helped launch the College's Sesquicentennial Campaign, which raised $5 million for projects including the construction of Bolton Theater and the renovation of Rosse Hall. He later became a special assistant to the president, a post in which he developed the program for renting campus facilities to outside groups during the summer.\n\nHe also served on the Gambier Village Council for many years and as council president.\n\n\"My specialty is getting the job done,\" Treleaven told the Mount Vernon News when he retired from Kenyon in 1990 after nineteen years at the College. A variation on that assessment was voiced when Treleaven was named Gambier Citizen of the Year in 1989. Rev. B.E. Palmer, pastor of the Church of the Holy Spirit, where Treleaven was active, said of him: \"He spends his spare time helping the rest of the world work.\"\n\nTom Stamp, College historian and a village council member, said, \"From the moment he returned to Kenyon, Lew was an essential member of both the College and village communities. It was appropriate that he chose to live in the heart of Gambier, in what we now know as Treleaven House, because he was at the center of so much of what happened here for more than two decades. Both as a Kenyon administrator and as an elected member of the village council, Lew was always a staunch advocate for the things he loved best about both the College and his adopted hometown.\"\n\nHis other community service included active membership in Harcourt Parish, where he was a lay reader, a vestry member, and senior warden. He also worked with the Boy Scouts, Big Brothers-Big Sisters, and the Salvation Army.\n\nLewis was active in Kenyon alumni affairs and received the Alumni Association's Distinguished Service Award in 1982.\n\nHe is survived by sons Peter Treleaven '71 and David Treleaven, and his wife, Norma. His first wife, Beverly, died in 1993, after forty-seven years of marriage.\n\nThe Treleaven name is known on campus through the family's former home on West Brooklyn Street, which was sold to the College in 2002. Treleaven House is now home to several faculty and administrative offices and to the Rural Life Center.\n\nRichard S. Warman '41, on February 20, 2008. The resident of Columbus, Ohio, was eighty-seven.\n\nRichard was a member of the International Relations Club and Delta Phi. He graduated magna cum laude with a degree in political science, and he was elected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa. Richard served in the U.S. Army in the Pacific Theater during World War II. He earned a bachelor's degree in education from Ohio State University in 1951 and taught high school classes in Lebanon, Ohio. Richard joined the Ohio Bureau of Employment in 1956, where he worked for thirty-one years. He worked as a statistical supervisor, chief of labor force reports, and chief of labor market research.\n\nRichard's wife, Delores, died in 1992. He is survived by his son, Bobby Warman, and brother, Robert Warman.\n\nRichard P. Talmage 1942, after a short illness, on June 3, 2008. The eighty-eight-year-old man lived in Mansfield, Ohio.\n\nRichard left the College to join the U.S. Navy during World War II. He served as a signalman in the Pacific Theater aboard six ships, including cruisers, destroyers, and an aviation-fuel tanker. He went on to own his own business, Talmage Gulf Distribution, in Mansfield. He was known as an avid golfer with a great sense of humor. He was fond of giving boxes of chocolates to people he thought deserved some acknowledgment for their efforts. He mourned the loss of two wives, Ila and Leona.\n\nRichard is survived by his daughter, Ann Addleman; step- son, George Swank; two grand-children; six step-grandchildren; and ten great-grandchildren.\n\nRobert D. Hance '43, on March 25, 2008. The Los Angeles, California, resident was eighty-seven.\n\nRobert was a political science major and a member of Delta Phi. He served in the U.S. Army infantry during World War II, including twenty-seven months overseas in North Africa and the European Theater. He won the Bronze Star. Robert earned his law degree from Western Reserve University in 1948. He worked as an attorney for the U.S. Air Force, retiring in 1974. Robert had a fondness for classic cars, and his 1937 Packard Coupe Roadster was used in the 1976 movie Murder by Death.\n\nMitchell Konarski '43 on September 28, 2007. The Brooksville, Florida, resident was eighty-six.\n\nMitchell was an economics major. He went on to establish Mitchell Farms, an egg-production business, in Medina, Ohio. In 1969, he was able to combine his love for traveling with his vocation and spent several months in the Philippines with the International Executive Service Corporation. The corporation arranged for executives to share managerial expertise with enterprises in developing nations. Part of his work overseas included a move to the small South Pacific island of Tinian in the Marianas group in 1970. His job was to help build a 50,000-layer farm on the island. In 1978, Mitchell became the vice president of the International Association of Poultrymen and lived for some time in Bogota, Colombia.\n\nMemorial donations may be sent to the Hernando-Pasco Hospice, Donations Department, 12107 Majestic Boulevard, Hudson, Florida, 34667.\n\nFrederick L. Ott '43 P'79, on April 10, 2008, at home with his family in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. He was eighty-seven.\n\nFrederick was a biology major. He graduated in two years and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces, participating in World War II. He drove support trucks for a squadron of P-38 Lightning fighter planes, reaching the rank of sergeant three times and later using his up-and-down rank as rich fodder for storytelling. After the war he went to work in a Wisconsin logging camp and then began a career in the paper industry, retiring as a salesman for the Leslie Paper Company.\n\nFrederick had a life-long interest in birds and conservation. He was a world traveler and enjoyed the outdoors. Frederick was a member of the Citizens Natural Resources Association when the group successfully fought for a ban on the use of the pesticide DDT in Wisconsin in 1971. He helped the Environmental Defense Fund win a national ban on DDT in 1972. Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"We don't know if the EDF would even be here today without his efforts.\"\n\nFrederick donated land in Fond du Lac County to the Foundation for Wildlife Conservation for bird conservation and research. And he helped found Bat Conservation International. The organizations for which he served as a board member include the Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, Friends of the (Milwaukee Public) Museum, International Crane Foundation, and Zoological Society of Milwaukee.\n\nEarlier this year he donated $500,000 to the Milwaukee Public Museum and helped raise another $500,000, museum President Dan Finley told the Journal Sentinel. \"He's been one of our real guardian angels,\" Finley said.\n\nHe was fond of saying, \"Good story, if true.\" Frederick also said, \"When it comes to dying, I'm going to enjoy that, too.\"\n\nFrederick's wife Elizabeth \"Jolly\" died in 2003. He is survived by his children Fredericka Ott, Bradford Ott '79, and Lisi Ott.

He served on the Camp Claire board of directors.\n\nIn a 1944 letter sent to Kenyon President Gordon Chalmers, from the U.S. Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi, Texas, Mark wrote, \"My thoughts are always with the place and people with whom I associate so many grand memories ...

He was eighty-three and lived in Key West, Florida.\n\nRust, who would go on to shape American literary life as the fiction editor of Esquire magazine, came to Kenyon in the fall of 1942 but left in March 1943 to enlist in the Merchant Marines. He graduated from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, in 1948 and received a master's degree from Wesleyan the next year.\n\nAs Esquire's fiction editor during three stints from the 1950s through the 1990s, Rust published writers ranging from John Cheever and Norman Mailer to Ann Beattie and Richard Ford. Noting his skill and wide influence, an obituary in the New York Times called him \"a shrewd reader with a keen ear for an original voice and a sure sense of the distinction between new writing and merely fashionable writing.\"\n\nWriters praised his ability as both a meticulous, line-by-line editor and a deft hand at excerpting novels. Among the works he excerpted for Esquire were William Styron's Sophie's Choice and Richard Ford's Independence Day.\n\nRust himself wrote a manual, Writing in General and the Short Story in Particular, that is often used in creative writing classes. He also wrote three books of personal essays, which were collected as How To Do Things Right: The Revelations of a Fussy Man. In addition, he edited several fiction anthologies.\n\nRust died shortly before the Bulletin went to press, and the editors were able to find very little information about his time at Kenyon, and none about whether he was involved in the College's literary life during the short time he spent in Gambier. Classmates and others who knew Rust at Kenyon are encouraged to call the Office of Public Affairs at 740-427-5158 or e-mail the Office of Alumni and Parent programs at alumni@kenyon.edu.\n\nDonald R.
