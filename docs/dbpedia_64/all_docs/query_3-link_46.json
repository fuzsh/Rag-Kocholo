It describes how to develop mission-based, quantifiable outputs from mission engineering, including baseline and alternative mission architectures, models, simulations, datasets, and results.\n\n“These updates reflect feedback from a wide audience, including practitioners and organizations both inside and outside of the DoD,” said Technical Director for Mission Integration Marc J. Goldenberg,\n\n“Mission engineering is a flexible, tailorable, and iterative approach that can be used to support a diverse set of consumers and address a variety of questions based on scope, complexity, and time,” Goldenberg added.\n\nThe updates are especially important today as the nation faces a new era of near-peer competition in which the old operational and mission architectures may need to be reimagined. The 2023 National Defense Science and Technology Strategy, published by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, noted “making the right technology investments will require the DoD to harness the analytic power of modeling and simulation to inform our assessments of emerging technologies that have greater operational value.” Mission engineering will aid in making those decisions and the updated guide will help drive those efforts.\n\nThe tools from this guide enable the Department to deliver quantitative mission-focused results that facilitate the mission engineering process and improve the quality and robustness of information made available to decision makers.\n\n“Mission engineering develops and analyzes kill chains using advanced analytic methods and tools to engineer mission outcomes. It allows us to identify the right set of capabilities needed by the Joint Force in a relevant time frame,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Mission Integration, Elmer L. Roman.\n\nThe guide is available online from the Department of Defense Chief Technology Officer’s website at https://ac.cto.mil/mission-engineering/\n\nDOD Awards $161 Million to Universities to Purchase Equipment Supporting Defense-Relevant Research\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\nThe Department of Defense today announced awards totaling $161 million to 281 university researchers under the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program.
