        "text": "Pol η completes non-mutagenic bypass across the DNA lesion responsible for UV-induced AC > TT mutations\n\nTo examine the involvement of pol η in the formation of atypical UV-induced mutations, we generated homozygous diploid yeast strains lacking pol η (rad30Δ/rad30Δ) and subjected them and corresponding WT diploid yeast to either 9 or 15 serial exposures of approximately 25 J/m2 UVC (Fig. ) to accumulate UV-induced mutations as previously reported8. Following UV exposure, 65 independent clones were isolated and subjected to whole genome sequencing to identify single and tandem base pair substitutions. Compared to WT diploid yeast, pol η-deficient yeast exposed to 15 rounds of UVC light had a 1.26-fold elevated median substitution density (calculated by dividing the median number of UV-induced substitutions in rad30Δ/rad30Δ yeast genomes by the corresponding median number in WT genomes) indicating that in general, pol η protects slightly against UV-induced mutations (Fig. ).\n\nEvaluation of the UV-induced mutation spectra, however, revealed significant differences upon pol η loss (p < 0.0001 by two-sided χ2 analysis comparing mutation spectra of Fig. ). As previously reported8, WT yeast displays canonical UV signature mutations (i.e. TC > TT, CT > TT, CC > CT, CC > TC, and CC > TT) as well as non-canonical T > C, T > A, and AC > TT UV-induced mutations (Fig. ). rad30Δ/rad30Δ yeast displayed a higher rate of the canonical UV mutations (Fig. ), which is expected as pol η is reported to be error-free in synthesizing past CPDs in TT dipyrimidines18. It is likely that pol η drives similar non-mutagenic synthesis across CPDs in other dipyrimidines and suggests that most mutations caused by CPDs result from elevated cytidine deamination within the lesion22. Loss of pol η nearly abolished T > C substitutions (Fig. ), indicating that they are induced solely by a lesion that the TLS polymerase mutagenically bypasses. Yeast pol η has been previously shown to cause T > C substitutions at site-specific 6-4 PPs16. These results indicate that 6-4 PPs likely cause the T > C mutations in UV-irradiated WT yeast. rad30Δ/rad30Δ yeast also displayed respective 3- and 2-fold elevation of CC > TT and CT > TA tandem substitutions, consistent with their induction by CPDs. In contrast, a 2-fold reduction in the number of atypical AC > TT mutations per genome was observed (Fig. ), indicating that like for 6-4 PPs, pol η is mutagenic in the bypass of AC lesions. Pol η-deficiency had no effect on T > A mutations, indicating that other polymerases are responsible for T > A substitutions in yeast. Notably, C > A substitutions in CA dinucleotide contexts also were elevated in rad30Δ/rad30Δ yeast, highlighting that pol η is protective against an additional UV-induced lesion (Fig. ). Pol η may additionally function in bypass of other potentially mutagenic UV-induced DNA lesions that could not be observed in our whole genome sequencing dataset. We assessed NER-proficient yeast because yeast deficient in both NER and pol η are extremely sensitive to UVC exposure (which precludes repeated UVC exposure and mutation accumulation) and to more closely model the human XPV condition (Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, UV lesions that are rapidly repaired by NER and rarely encounter TLS polymerases will be under-represented in our analysis. Nonetheless, the UV-induced mutation spectrum of rad30Δ/rad30Δ yeast was still significantly different than for yeast deficient in GG-NER (i.e. rad16Δ/rad16Δ8) or TC-NER (i.e. rad26Δ/rad26Δ; Supplementary Fig. 2a, b) (p < 0.0001 by two-sided χ2 analysis comparing mutation spectra of Fig. and Supplementary Fig. 2a), which displayed similar distributions of UV-induced substitution types in sequence contexts as those observed in WT yeast.\n\nTranscriptional and replicative asymmetry of mutation spectra in UV-irradiated yeast\n\nUV-induced mutations that result from bulky UV photoproducts exhibit transcriptional asymmetry due to TC-NER preferentially repairing lesions on the transcribed strand (TS) of genes prior to replication26. The role of TC-NER in generating this asymmetry can be confirmed as yeast deficient in TC-NER (i.e. rad26Δ/rad26Δ yeast) have low transcriptional strand bias8 (Supplementary Fig. 2c–g). Observed transcriptional asymmetry of UV-induced mutations provides support that lesions are likely UV photoproducts and indicates on which of the complementary dinucleotide bases the lesion was formed. We therefore assessed transcriptional asymmetry of mutations in pol η-deficient yeast to evaluate whether loss of this polymerase influenced the strand association of UV-induced mutations. The expected favoring of the non-transcribed strand (NTS) for canonical C > T mutations was apparent in rad30Δ/rad30Δ yeast (Fig. ), emphasizing the impact of TC-NER. Similar to those in WT yeast8, the limited number of T > C substitutions generated in rad30Δ/rad30Δ yeast also occurred preferentially on the NTS (Fig. ), confirming that these substitutions still likely result from UV-induced 6-4 PPs that are mutagenically bypassed by another TLS polymerase, but at a lower efficiency. In both WT and rad30Δ/rad30Δ yeast, T > A substitutions in an NTA context occurred more abundantly on the TS, indicating that these are primarily A > T substitutions at these contexts (Fig. ). C > A substitutions in the NCA context, which were formed exclusively in rad30Δ/rad30Δ yeast, also displayed bias for the TS (Fig. ). This transcriptional asymmetry indicates that like for T > A substitutions, C > A mutations originate from lesions on the opposite DNA strand. Thus, C > A mutations are in fact G > T substitutions occurring in TGN contexts and are either indicative of a novel TG photoproduct inducing TC-NER, or are another UV-induced non-photoproduct lesion which is only observed in the absence of Pol η. Supporting the latter hypothesis, UV light is known to induce oxidative damage, including 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG)27, which results in G > T substitutions and can favor TGN sequence contexts28,29. Additionally, pol η is known to play an important role in the non-mutagenic bypass of 8-oxoG lesions in yeast30,31.\n\nA recent study identified replicative asymmetry (i.e. mutations occurring primarily on the leading strand or the lagging strand during replication) among melanoma mutations that are mostly UV-induced32. C > T substitutions among this dataset showed a lagging strand template bias, which was attributed to more mutagenic TLS occurring during lagging strand synthesis. We reasoned that our mutation accumulation experiments in WT and rad30Δ/rad30Δ yeast would provide an experimental test of whether TLS preferentially occurs on the lagging strand. Using a previously established method for assessing replicative asymmetry of mutations in yeast whole genome sequencing33,34, we profiled the relative ratio of complementary UV-induced substitutions as a function of the distance of the mutation’s position to the closest origin of replication. From these plots, preferential mutagenic TLS associated with either the leading or lagging strand is evident as a greater abundance of a specific substitution than its corresponding complementary mutation type in regions with leftward moving forks (i.e. downstream of origins), while the inverted relationship occurs in regions with rightward moving forks (i.e. upstream of origins). This relationship results in a characteristic “cross” in the graph of the fractional abundance of complementary mutation types, with the slope of each line indicating how much a given strand is favored. In WT yeast, T > A and T > C mutations displayed no detectible replicative asymmetry, while C > T substitutions occurred with slight preference to the leading strand (Supplementary Fig. 4). These patterns suggest that TLS in yeast occurs nearly evenly during synthesis of the leading and lagging strands. A similar lack of replication asymmetry was observed in pol η-deficient yeast. This result indicates that even in the absence of pol η, pol ζ-mediated TLS occurs equally on both DNA strands.\n\nTranslesion synthesis polymerases η and ζ coordinate to bypass atypical UV lesions in yeast\n\nTo investigate the involvement of other polymerases in the formation of the atypical mutations, we created novel single-stranded reversion reporters that contain reversion sequences matching the atypical substitution patterns. The reporters were designed proximal to the ChrV telomere in yeast strains (ySR585, ySR586) that contain the temperature sensitive cdc13-1 allele, which at non-permissive temperature (37 °C) results in telomere un-capping, 5’ to 3’ end resection, and single-stranded DNA formation near telomere ends35.\n\nTo test polymerases involved in mutagenic bypass of the TA photoproduct that results in A to T substitutions, we created an inactive variant of the TRP5 gene which carried a trp5 E50V mutation36 such that the coding and non-coding strands of the gene contained GTA and TAC sequences, respectively at the reversion site. Insertion of this trp5 E50V near the telomere end in ChrV in cdc13-1 yeast, allows one strand of the reporter to be resected and leaves the remaining strand unambiguously the target for UV-induced damage that results in reversion. By inserting trp5 E50V in both orientations, either the GTA or TAC lesion context can be evaluated. The trp5 E50V reversion reporter could theoretically be reverted by either a T > A or TA > AG substitution in the GTA sequence orientation or A > T and TA > CT substitutions in the TAC orientation (i.e. GTA to GAA or GAG codon changes) to produce the required valine to glutamic acid change (Fig. ). UV-light-induced TRP5 reversion with the reporter in either orientation over non-treated yeast; however, reversion rates were 100-fold higher in the cdc13-1 strains, likely due to impaired lesion repair or increased lesion formation in ssDNA (Fig. ). Sequencing of UV-treated revertants revealed that regardless of orientation, only single base substitutions occurred, indicating that UV light can induce a T > A substitution (potentially at a GT or TA photoproduct) nearly as efficiently as an A > T substitution at the TA photoproduct. We subsequently generated rad30Δ and rev3Δ mutations in the cdc13-1 forward orientation strains to assess the impact of TLS polymerase deficiency on A > T substitutions generated during the bypass of a TA photoproduct. In the forward orientation (A > T), rad30Δ resulted in no detectible change in reversion frequency, consistent with the similar abundance of T > A mutations in TA contexts observed in UV-irradiated WT and rad30Δ whole genome sequenced yeast (Fig. ). In contrast, rev3Δ reduced reversion >100-fold, even 44-fold lower than the untreated cdc13-1 strain. This drastic reduction in mutation rate indicates that pol ζ is absolutely required for A > T substitutions at TA photoproducts, potentially by both error-prone insertion across from the lesion as well as extension from the nucleotide across from the damage.\n\nWe next assessed the requirements for pol η and pol ζ in UV-induced AC > TT substitutions. Through a similar experimental strategy, we inserted our previously described ura3 K93V allele that allows for reversion to URA3 through an AC > TT tandem substitution8 into the subtelomere of ChrV in both orientations of CDC13 + and cdc13-1 temperature sensitive yeast (Fig. ). Because AC > TT mutations occur less frequently than the A > T substitutions measured with the trp5 reporter, strains containing the ura3 reporter were exposed to 50 J/m2 UVC. No revertants were observed in the absence of UVC regardless of the reporter orientation or whether the reporter was single-stranded or double stranded DNA. For each of these “no UVC” controls, we therefore calculated a maximum estimated reversion frequency as the frequency for a single revertant to have been observed among the number of yeast cells plated in each experiment. With UVC-exposure, the single-stranded reporter in the forward orientation (containing an AC dinucleotide at the reversion site) showed a 30-fold elevation in reversion frequency compared to the estimated maximum frequency for non-UVC exposed yeast temperature shifted to 37 °C (Fig. ). In contrast, UVC irradiation only elevated the reversion frequency of the reverse orientation reporter with the AC dinucleotide in the resected strand 8-fold. The increase in the reverse orientation is likely due to incomplete resection of our reporter among cells in the culture as a similar Ura+ frequency was observed with UVC-irradiated double stranded reporters. Similarly to the trp5 reporter, the ura3 reporter could revert by two possible codon changes to create a functional URA3 allele (i.e. GTA to AAA or AAG), allowing the potential detection of GT > AA or GTA > AAG substitutions in the reverse orientation and AC > TT or TAC > CTT substitutions in the forward orientation. Sequencing of URA3 revertants from the reporter in either orientation revealed only tandem AC > TT mutations. These results confirm that the primary lesion producing AC > TT tandem substitutions is an atypical AC photoproduct as these substitutions occur much more frequently when the AC containing strand in the reporter is present. The frequency of the AC > TT reversion was also measured in various polymerase mutant or knockout lines to identify contributing polymerases (Fig. ). The absence of pol η resulted in a 3-fold decrease in the mutation frequency of AC > TT in the single-stranded reporter, consistent with the whole-genome sequencing evidence that pol η contributes to mutations at AC photoproducts (Fig. ). Significantly, the rev3Δ strain had at least a 65-fold reduction (no Ura+ colonies were observed for rev3Δ strain; fold change was determined using the maximum estimated reversion frequency) compared to the UV-treated single-stranded control strain with functional TLS. Moreover, the reversion rate in UV treated rev3Δ yeast was indistinguishable from untreated WT yeast with the reporter containing the target AC in ssDNA, indicating that as with A > T bypass of the TA photoproduct, AC > TT tandem substitutions were completely dependent on pol ζ. The partial reduction of reversion in pol η-deficient yeast and complete loss of reversion upon pol ζ-deficiency indicates that AC > TT mutagenesis frequently proceeds in a two-polymerase mechanism where pol η mutagenically inserts at least one of the nucleotides at the AC photoproduct, while pol ζ extends from the pol η insertion to complete TLS.\n\nThe persistence of some reversion events for both the A > T and AC > TT reporters in the absence of pol η, indicates that either pol ζ is capable of completing both the insertion and extension steps of mutagenic bypass of the TA and AC photoproducts, or another DNA polymerase is involved in the insertion at the lesion site. We reasoned that a replicative polymerase would be responsible for such an activity as the only other TLS polymerase in yeast is Rev1, which exclusively incorporates deoxycytidine triphosphates and therefore would not be a candidate for either substitution type. To gain insight into whether any of the replicative polymerases impact UV-induced A > T and AC > TT substitutions, we generated the nucleotide selectivity mutants of POL1 (L868M), POL2 (M644G), and POL3 (L612M)19–21,37 in the strains containing our single stranded reversion reporters and assessed the ability of these change of spectrum mutators to alter reversion rates. Creation of these alleles imparted a clear spontaneous mutator phenotype to the yeast as observed by increased canavanine resistance indicating elevated mutations in the CAN1 gene (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, neither the pol1 L868M mutant nor the pol3 L612M mutant altered UV-induced reversion of either the trp5 A > T reporter or the ura3 AC > TT reporter (Fig. ). Surprisingly, the pol2 M644G strain decreased both the A > T and AC > TT reversion frequency 5- and 10-fold respectively compared to UV-irradiated ssDNA controls. These results highlight a potential role for DNA pol ε in inserting across from UV damage where the pol2 M644G allele allows pol ε to insert non-adenine bases more efficiently across from TA or AC photoproducts, resulting in a reduction of revertants."
