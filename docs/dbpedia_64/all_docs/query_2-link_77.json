        "text": "now THAT's flaky\n\nIn the wake of a tart class that I taught a few months back, when my apple tarts baked with pâte brisée came out soggy and under baked, I was determined to revisit the techniques involved in making this classic dough. (SIDE NOTE: in my defense the apple filling prepped by an eager culinary student was way too soupy, and the oven I used was not familiar to me, but I still felt the need for a refresher!)\n\nKnown to pie and tart bakers as flaky pie dough, pâte brisée can cause the most confident baker to question why, why, why doesn't this dough come out perfectly EVERY time?! Some years ago I compared a number of recipes and methods for pâte brisée and came away with a version that was delicious and seemed to be just the thing. But since then, even though I've used the same recipe and technique every time, I've had my share of less than stellar results. Maybe it's just me, eh?\n\nI proceeded to look at recipes from Christophe Felder (one of my favorite tart makers) and Thomas Keller of French Laundry/Bouchon Bakery fame. In addition I obtained the recipe that the bakers at Nonna Cafe in Ada use (I've had their quiche many times and the crust is always deeelish!). The last addition to my test quartet was the recipe I've been using for years.\n\nTruth be told, many pâte brisée recipes are very similar, but what intrigued me about these four was the difference in ratios of butter to flour, how much water is added and how the ingredients are brought together.\n\nHere we go!\n\nPâte brisée is simply flour, cold butter, salt and ice water (some recipes add a bit of sugar too). In the photo below I've provided the amounts of butter and flour for each of the four recipes. From left to right you see the following ratios plus baker’s percentages for the butter: Felder (CF): butter:flour at 1:2 (50%); Keller (TK) 1:1.35 (74%); me (SV): 1:1.44 (69%); Nonna (N): 1:1.18 (85%) (getting much closer to 1:1!).\n\nIn this test I'm using Challenge unsalted butter made in California with the claim that it is from cows not treated with growth hormone rbST. I've been using it for some months now and it's good.\n\nSo how are these all put together, you might ask? I've always followed the \"flaking\" method when making pâte brisée by hand.This involves working pieces of cold butter into the flour and salt, purposely leaving large \"flakes\" or flat pieces of butter in the mixture. Cold water is then added in increments and mixed lightly and quickly until the dough holds together. The dough is then wrapped and chilled before rolling it out for use.\n\nHere are the differences in technique for the other three doughs.\n\nFelder calls for soft butter to which is added the salt, sugar and flour. The mixture is sanded by hand to coarse crumbs, then 120 gm ice water is added and mixed gently until the dough comes together. The amount of water to flour is much higher in his recipe. He claims that this dough holds very well after baking, doesn't soften and is great for juicy fruit fillings.\n\nKeller's method involves mixing half the flour with the salt, adding butter pieces on low speed in a mixer until NO butter is visible. Then on med-low speed the remaining flour is added, followed by the water. Mix until just combined, wrap and chill.\n\nNonna's dough is made with a food processor, although I chose to sand the butter in by hand. Place the flour and salt in the bowl, pulse in the cold, diced butter to achieve coarse crumbs, then add the ice water and pulse just until it comes together. Wrap and chill.\n\nAll just a little bit different!\n\nOnce the four doughs were chilled I rolled them out to make 80 mm filled and baked blueberry tarts and blind baked then filled lemon tarts.\n\nHere are the rings lined for the blueberry tarts.\n\nHere's what I observed when rolling these doughs.\n\nThe Felder dough, even after a good chill, felt weirdly spongy and soft (NOT in a good way). It was sticky and didn't hold its shape well when lining the ring.\n\nThe Keller dough was smooth, firm and tight, rolled beautifully and held very nicely when lining the ring.\n\nMy SV dough felt a bit rougher and drier than the others, although rolled well and held when lining the ring.\n\nThe Nonna dough felt soft (in a good way) - not too wet, not too dry - rolled nicely and held well when lining the ring.\n\nI popped the lined rings into the freezer to firm up before baking.\n\nFirst the blueberry tarts. I sprinkled some fine, dry bread crumbs in the bottom of the tart shells - this is meant to create a barrier between the filling and the crust to help reduce the chance for sogginess. Then I filled each with fresh blueberries that were tossed in a little lemon juice, sugar and flour ( for four 80 mm tarts I used a generous 3 cups of berries with 1-2 teaspoons lemon juice, 4 - 6 tablespoons sugar (or to taste) and 2 tablespoons of flour).\n\nHeat the oven to 425 F. Here they are ready to go in.\n\nI realize you can't appreciate the difference in the doughs visually, but the first thing I checked was how they all felt when portioning them with a serrated knife, followed by how easily they cut with a fork.\n\nFelder's crust was tough, both when slicing with a knife and when cutting with a fork. It was chewy in the mouth, not flaky or tender and the flavor was dull. No thanks.\n\nKeller's cut very easily with both knife and fork, was tender and crisp with a pleasant and agreeable flavor.\n\nMine was just a tad resistant to cutting compared to Keller's, slightly less tender but crisp in the mouth with good flavor.\n\nNonna's cut easily with great flavor and texture.\n\nAll of the above observations held when tasting the plain baked scraps of dough. Felder's was chewy and tough, broke apart with a bend rather than a crisp snap without any flakiness. The other three were flaky, crisply tender and delicious.\n\nWhen cutting and tasting the lemon tarts, the same observations held true. (Love that lemon filling!)\n\nFelder was the obvious loser. However the other three were all good, leaving me with the question - now what?!\n\nAs if you haven't already had enough, I decided to do just a bit more reading and research and came upon one more technique that sounded promising. I'll credit this one to Kristen Rosenau who writes the blog \"Pastry Affair\" (http://www.pastryaffair.com).\n\nFirst I tweaked my recipe (it's coming at the end, I promise!) by increasing the butter to bring the butter:flour ratio to 1:1.25 (80%), in between TK and N.\n\nIn Kristen's by-hand method she takes half of the diced cold butter and sands it into the flour and salt. Then she adds the other half of the butter in larger diced pieces and \"flakes\" them, leaving flat pieces of butter visible. Add the ice water incrementally and once the dough holds together, turn it out onto a piece of parchment or plastic wrap. There may very well be some crumbly pieces at the edges. Don't worry.\n\nOf course while the blueberry and lemon tarts were cooling, I just had to snitch a taste of the plain crust - YUM! Tender, flaky and all around delicious.\n\nOnce they were cooled, Steve and I tasted the blueberry and lemon versions and found the crust to be wonderfully tender, flaky and buttery. And, to top it off, they were still delicious the next day! I like that.\n\nSo here's my version that I intend to use from this day forward.\n\nPâte brisée (makes approximately 645 gms of dough, MORE than enough for two 9\" tarts; just freeze what you don't need). Click here for a printable PDF version.\n\n325 grams all purpose flour\n\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n\nOPT: one tablespoon granulated sugar\n\n260 grams cold, unsalted butter (1/2 small-dice, 1/2 large-dice)\n\n60 ml (4 tablespoons) ice cold water\n\nMix the flour, salt and sugar (if using) in a large bowl.\n\nSand in the small-dice butter with your finger tips to achieve coarse crumbs.\n\nFlake in the large-dice butter leaving flat, largish pieces in the mixture.\n\nAdd 1/2 the water, toss with a fork then toss and gently squeeze with your hands. Add additional water by tablespoon until the dough holds together.\n\nNOTE: if the dough still seems dry and too crumbly to hold together (as it might on a cold, dry winter's day), continue to add additional tablespoons as needed but don't exceed 120 ml (8 tablespoons).\n\nPlace the dough onto a piece of parchment or plastic wrap; using the wrap as an aid, flatten the dough and fold into thirds. Turn 90 degrees, flatten and fold in thirds again. Flatten, wrap and chill for at least an hour or overnight.\n\nIf you don't intend to use the dough for a couple of days, freeze it well wrapped for up to 3 months. A day before you wish to use it remove it from the freezer and place in the fridge to thaw overnight.\n\nWhile this may not have been the most scientific of studies, it was indeed illuminating. I love experimenting and learning, especially when I get to work with dough. Yeah.\n\nHave lots of fun folks!!"
