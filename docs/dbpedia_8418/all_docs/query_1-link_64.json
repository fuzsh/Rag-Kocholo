        "text": "Hollywood legend Arnold Schwarzenegger is known to millions around the globe for his action-man image thanks to roles in Terminator, Predator, Commando and True Lies, however, it could have been a very different story for the star if it’d made this change.\n\nArnold, 75, started off the bodybuilding scene, making a name for himself and winning trophies for his impressive physique.\n\nThe Austrian-born star decided to make the transition from bodybuilding into acting and with it came a name change in the hopes of cracking the notoriously tough world of the show business.\n\nFor his first acting role in a production of Hercules in New York, the producers decided to change up his name to ‘Arnold Strong’, a nod to his bodybuilding days and his Mr Universe moniker.\n\nSadly, the name change didn’t help Hercules in New York at all with the film bombing at the box office.\n\nIn fact, even Arnold struggled with his English lines for the movie and his voice was eventually dubbed.\n\nSpeaking in the Netflix documentary simply titled Arnold, the star said: \"Americans want to hear their idols talk like John Wayne, not like you\".\n\nThis was also the reason for changing his name to be more anglicised for an American audience.\n\nArnold went on to say Hercules in New York wasn’t the big breakout role he’d been hoping for.\n\nHe said: “For five years there was no offer, for anything.\n\n“There was a lot of things I had to learn, obstacles I had to overcome, including the biggest obstacle when everyone says no it can't be done.\"\n\nBut the star’s tenacity paid off and he eventually landed one of his first big parts in Conan The Barbarian - this time going by his real name.\n\nThe movie was a success and Arnold was praised by the critics, leading to a fruitful and long career in Tinseltown.\n\nArnold showed his versatility as an actor, starring in the likes of comedies Junior and Twins with Danny DeVito as well as taking on DC Comics villain Mr Freeze in Batman & Robin.\n\nBut it’s his role as a leading action man which has continued to get him work.\n\nMost recently, his Netflix show Fubar was released and saw Arnold venturing into the world of TV.\n\nFubar became a huge hit worldwide and even claimed the top spot on the Netflix charts.\n\nArnold will be released on Netflix tomorrow globally"
