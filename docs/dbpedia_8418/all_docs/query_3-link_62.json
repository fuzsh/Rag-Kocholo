        "text": "“In reality your actions can have lasting consequences.” – Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nIn 1993 my mom reluctantly allowed me to watch Terminator 2: Judgement Day. We were in Blockbuster and I wanted to rent an action movie. I didn’t really know “Ahnold,” but I remember seeing commercials on TV and wanted to see it.\n\nTo this day it is one of my top two or three favorite movies. Not only is it a masterpiece of storytelling, it’s an action packed emotional gamut. I cannot help but shed a tear or two every time the T-800’s thumbs-up sinks into the molten steel.\n\nI was hooked on Arnold since then. So, when Netflix recently released the documentary about his life – aptly named Arnold­ – I made it a point to watch. And it did not disappoint. Infinitely fascinating, his life is incredible for many reasons – not all of them positive. But that’s what makes us human, and it’s something Arnold doesn’t run from. Many of us do, so he is owed credit for owning his past mistakes.\n\nWhat I couldn’t help noticing, however, while watching Arnold was that his mindset, attitudes, and actions follow many tenants of Stoicism. He didn’t once mention philosophy, Stoic, or any of that; but it’s there. Arnold in all his greatness and in all his folly mirror Stoic fortitude, Stoic heart, and Stoic empathy.\n\nArnold embodies both the ancient definition of happiness (a flourishing life) and the modern definition (cheerfulness, joy, pleasure). It’s important to note both of these definitions. Philosophy only guarantees the former (if we use it properly). The latter is something that comes from us, and it can be found in any situation if you desire. So, what is the Stoic Philosophy of Arnold Schwarzenegger?\n\nEmbracing Obstacles. When speaking about his early acting career, Arnold said “It was very difficult for me in the beginning – I was told by agents and casting people that my body was ‘too weird’, that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.” Now? All of those things are iconic. He found a way to use what were considered “weaknesses” and turned them into strengths. Any “weakness” can be a strength if enough effort can be put into using it properly and differently! Central to a lot of Marcus Aurelius’’ writing in Meditations revolves around one of his more powerful quotes: “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” Arnold’s obstacles became his calling card.\n\nLoving the Process. “What we face may look insurmountable. But I learned something from all those years of training and competing. I learned something from all those sets and reps when I didn’t think I could lift another ounce of weight. What I learned is that we are always stronger than we know.” Arnold did not sculp his iconic physique overnight. He began when he was a 15 year old kid in rural Austria. Five years later he won his first international competition. Along the way he failed – a lot. That’s what body building is. It’s failing so that your body can rebuild itself stronger. How did he do this? By falling in love with the process! Yes, winning was great, and it was a goal he wanted. But the process of body building – getting up early, working out 3 hours a day, eating properly, learning technique – hitting repeat every day. THIS is why he succeeded. The process, not the result, was what drove him eventually to greatness in the world of competitive body building. Epictetus said “Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens. Some things are up to us and some things are not up to us.” What was in Arnold’s power? Working out, eating right, his drive, his vision. The rest followed once he did the work.\n\nCommunity. “Help others and give something back. I guarantee you will discover that while public service improves the lives and the world around you, its greatest reward is the enrichment and new meaning it will bring your own life.” Throughout the entire documentary, Arnold spoke recently about his community. Whether is was his body building partners, whether it was his family, whether it was his business partners, producers, directors, Arnold made sure to mention he did not do it alone. “Call me Arnie, call me Schnitzel, call me Kraut. Do not call me a self-made man, because I am not.” He made it clear he couldn’t have done it without his support system. In fact, no one can. Stoicism speaks of Sympatheia, the idea that “all things are interwoven with each other and therefore have an affinity for each other.” We cannot exist without all the threads that intertwine all the universe. Arnold embodies this idea.\n\nDelight in being disruptive. This was a quote by Arnold’s Chief of Staff, Susan Kennedy. She said Arnold loved being disruptive. She was a Democrat, lesbian, and had the last name of Kennedy (though not related). As a Republican, Arnold wanted someone to help him understand how to be successful as governor. He didn’t want to toe party lines. He wanted to do what was best for the people. He didn’t care that his party lambasted him for hiring Kennedy. He was going to disrupt business as usual, and enact the moves he felt would best support the people – not politicians. Regardless if you feel his political career was successful or not, this attitude is vital for change. Change is disruption. Stoics lean into change because it is inevitable. It is using your power to work through and help guide and help promote what needs to be. “Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What’s closer to nature’s heart? Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take place without something being changed? Can’t you see? It’s just the same with you—and just as vital to nature.” – Marcus Aurelius\n\nBe useful. “My dad always told me, ‘Be useful, Arnold.’ And every time people come up to me and tell me how my advice has helped them throughout their lives, I can see that it’s useful when I share my life philosophy, rules, and tools.” There is nothing more Stoic than being useful. That’s the purpose of life. By living our lives, we are providing others with our gifts – whether we know it or not. Sometimes it’s consciously, other times unconsciously. Regardless, we are all connected, and our actions matter. “What brings no benefit to the hive brings no benefit to the bee,” as Marcus Aurelius wrote. Being mindful of our usefulness can bring life to others. And that is also good for us to know we are putting good out in the world.\n\nThere were so many other little tidbits I picked up when watching, such as:\n\nProblems never end.\n\nJust keep moving.\n\nVision and motivation and seeing the next peak after climbing the mountain.\n\nAll the world’s a stage, and you’re always selling.\n\nBe a happy warrior, have fun.\n\nLean into aging. Time remains undefeated.\n\nFailure.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is not infallible. He has a past that is complicated. In his younger years, he was indiscriminate with his misogynistic behavior. He took steroids to get bigger. He had an affair that destroyed his family. Despite this, he hasn’t run from these past “fuck ups” (as he called them). He has openly talked about all these things and tried to move forward in a way that helps make up for them.\n\nNone of us is infallible, and that’s the point. We all put bad into the universe. We all put good. All we can do is try to make sure the good outweighs the bad. Arnold’s life, just like all of ours, is worth knowing. He provides a great blueprint for what to do, and what not to do. It’s up to us to do our part.\n\nWhat does this have to do with human resources? Everything! These platitudes, while closely linked to Stoicism, are also linked to many other philosophies, religions, and values. These are ideas that everyone could benefit from leaning into. As I’ve written again and again and again, what’s the point of studying philosophy if not to incorporate it into our daily lives – especially our professional lives. If we’re not seeking to improve, then why are we here? What good are we? How are we being useful? We’re not.\n\nPhilosophy is a bridge to a better life. Arnold is proof of this. Not a perfect life – for this is an impossibility. Philosophy only offers us a gateway to happiness. It’s up to us to pay the toll.\n\nUltimately, come with philosophy if you want to live.\n\n© 2023 HR Philosopher.
