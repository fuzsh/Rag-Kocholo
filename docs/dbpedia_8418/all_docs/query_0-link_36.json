The actor-turned-politician, 75, shares his daughters, Katherine, 33, and Christina, 31, and his sons, Patrick, 29, and Christopher, 25, with his ex-wife, the television journalist Maria Shriver.\n\nThe pair married in 1986, but Shriver, who is the niece of President John F. Kennedy, filed for divorce in 2011 after she confronted Schwarzenegger in a marriage-counseling session about the secret son he fathered with a member of their household staff. However, the pair did not finalize their divorce until a decade later, in December 2021.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nSchwarzenegger had an affair in 1996 with Mildred Baena, the family's housekeeper, which resulted in the birth of his fifth child, Joseph Baena, 25, who was born less than a week after his and Shriver's youngest son.\n\nSpeaking in the new Netflix docuseries \"Arnold,\" the former governor of California said that he didn't know whether Baena was his for many years but couldn't deny their resemblance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In the beginning, I really didn't know, I just started kind of feeling. The older he got, the more it became clear to me,\" he said. \"And it was then just really a matter of, how do you keep this quiet? How do you keep this a secret?\"\n\nSchwarzenegger went public with the news shortly after he and Shriver told their kids. \"The Terminator\" star told \"The Howard Stern Show\" in 2015 that his relationship with his five offspring was \"fantastic.\"\n\nKeep reading for everything you need to know about Schwarzenegger's five children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwarzenegger and Shriver's eldest daughter, Katherine, 33, is a bestselling author who is married to the movie star Chris Pratt.\n\nKatherine Eunice Schwarzenegger was born on December 13, 1989. Her middle name was chosen to honor her maternal grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who died in 2009 at age 88.\n\nKatherine has made a name for herself in the self-help sphere, having authored several books since she was 21 years old on different topics, including positive self-image, navigating life after graduating college, and forgiveness. She has also written two children's books.\n\nSince 2019, she has been married to the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" star Chris Pratt, who she began dating a year prior. Together they share two daughters, Lyla, 2, and 1-year-old Eloise.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" in 2022, Schwarzenegger opened up about his growing family, saying that it was \"the easiest thing to be a grandfather.\"\n\nThe former governor of California also praised Pratt, 43, describing him as a \"fantastic guy\" and \"a great son-in-law.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristina, 31, previously worked as an editor at Goop but has more recently turned her attention to producing documentaries.\n\nChristina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger was born on July 23, 1991. Like her older sister, her middle names are significant as Aurelia is the name of Schwarzenegger's late mom, and Maria is her mom's name.\n\nChristina also honored her mom by attending her alma mater, Georgetown University, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in English. She also studied interior architecture at Parsons School of Design, per Hola, and has pursued several creative jobs.\n\nShe was an editor at Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand, Goop, for three years, according to People, and has also worked at interior-design startups.\n\nMost recently, she has turned her attention to documentaries and was credited as an executive producer on Netflix's 2018 documentary \"Take Your Pills\" and its 2022 followup, \"Take Your Pills: Xanax.\"\n\nShe also serves on the council for the Special Olympics, a sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities that was founded by her maternal grandmother in 1968.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatrick, 29, is the only one of Schwarzenegger and Shriver's children who has pursued a career in Hollywood.\n\nPatrick Arnold Schwarzenegger was born on September 18, 1993. His middle name honors his father and he shares his first name with his cousin. His uncle, Meinhard Schwarzenegger, died at the age of 24 in 1971, leaving behind a 3-year-old son — who now goes by Patrick Knapp — who Schwarzenegger helped financially while he was growing up.\n\nPatrick is the only of Schwarzenegger's children with Shriver who has pursued a career in Hollywood. Since the age of 10, he has been appearing in movies and working as a model.\n\nPatrick is perhaps best known for starring in the 2022 HBO true-crime series \"The Staircase\" alongside Colin Firth, Toni Collette, and Sophie Turner.\n\nWhile still studying at the University of Southern California in 2015, Patrick had a brief but high-profile relationship with the singer Miley Cyrus. They called it quits after five months because of lifestyle differences, according to People.\n\nThe same year, he began a relationship with the model Abby Champion, and the couple are still together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwarzenegger's youngest son with Shriver, Christopher, 25, largely stays out of the spotlight.\n\nChristopher Sargent Schwarzenegger is the youngest of Shriver and Schwarzenegger's children together and was born on September 27, 1997. His middle name honors his maternal grandfather, Sargent Shriver, an American diplomat, politician, and activist.\n\nChristopher remains out of the spotlight and, having only graduated from the University of Michigan in a virtual ceremony in 2020, appears to have not settled on a career just yet.\n\nHowever, while celebrating Christopher's 24th birthday in 2021, Schwarzenegger wrote in a social-media post that his son was interested in various sports.\n\n\"Between your boxing classes, your weightlifting classes, your stretching classes, your cycling classes, and on and on, I can't even keep up with you!\" he wrote. \"I love you and I'm proud of you every day!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph Baena, 25, the son Schwarzenegger shares with his former housekeeper, was born just five days after Christopher.\n\nJoseph Baena is the son of Schwarzenegger and Mildred Baena, his housekeeper who worked for the family for more than 15 years. He was born on October 2, 1997, five days after Schwarzenegger and Shriver's youngest son was born.\n\nOn his mother's side, Joseph has Guatemalan heritage and four siblings in their thirties and forties.\n\nJoseph has followed in his father's footsteps. He is an aspiring bodybuilder and actor as well as a real-estate agent.\n\nIn an interview with Men's Health in 2022, the \"Dancing With the Stars\" contestant said that he didn't use his dad's last name while auditioning because \"he doesn't believe in handouts.\"\n\n\"He believes hard work pays off, and so do I,\" he said. \"I love the word honor, and I'm very prideful in the sense that if I use my dad's contacts or ask him for favors, I wonder what honor is that gonna bring me?\"\n\nIn the interview, Joseph also said that he \"very vividly\" recalled the day his father's identity was made public when he was just 13 years old.\n\n\"I was in the eighth grade,\" Joseph said. \"And I get called out of class to leave. And my mom's there, and she's like, 'We gotta go — everyone is finding out about you and who your father is.'\"\n\nJoseph shared on the podcast \"Unwaxed\" in 2022 that it \"took a little while\" for him and Schwarzenegger to become \"close\" in the aftermath of the scandal.\n\nIn \"Arnold,\" which is now streaming on Netflix, Joseph makes a brief appearance with his father but doesn't speak on camera.\n\n\"It was wrong what I did,\" the former governor said of his affair in the docuseries. \"But I don't want to make Joseph feel that he is not welcomed in this world — because he is very much welcomed in this world. I love him, and he has turned out to be an extraordinary young man.\"\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
