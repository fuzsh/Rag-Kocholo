        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger, a name synonymous with Hollywood action and political dynamism, has now added another remarkable chapter to his multifaceted life by becoming a billionaire.\n\nAt 76, the Austrian-born actor, former governor, and entrepreneur has amassed a fortune that Forbes estimates at $1 billion, cementing his status among the elite ranks of entertainers who have successfully transitioned their fame into substantial wealth.\n\nEarly Life and Hollywood Stardom\n\nBorn into a humble family in the Austrian village of Thal, Schwarzenegger’s journey to global stardom was anything but ordinary. His father’s troubling Nazi past did not deter young Arnold from pursuing his dreams. With a formidable blend of muscle and charisma, he won the Mr. Universe title four times before conquering Hollywood with iconic roles in films like “The Terminator” and “Kindergarten Cop”. Despite initial struggles due to his thick accent, Schwarzenegger’s tenacity and unique charm made him a household name, with his films generating $5.5 billion at the box office and earning him an estimated $500 million.\n\nA pivotal moment in his cinematic career was the unprecedented deal he struck for the 1988 comedy “Twins.” Foregoing an upfront salary, Schwarzenegger negotiated for nearly 20% of the gross receipts, ultimately netting over $35 million. This savvy move highlighted his business acumen and set a precedent in Hollywood deal-making.\n\nKEY POINTS OF HIS CAREER\n\n· 1967: Schwarzenegger wins Mr. Universe for the first of four times — his first title was in the “Amateur” competition, but he won the “Professional” title the next year.\n\n· 1970: Schwarzenegger films his first film: “Hercules in New York.” His lines were dubbed over by another actor in the original version.\n\n· 1984: Schwarzenegger gets his breakout role in James Cameron’s “The Terminator.” He was paid $750,000 for the blockbuster.\n\n· 1998: Schwarzenegger releases “Twins,” his most profitable film. The comedy grossed more than $215 million globally at the box office.\n\n· 2003: Schwarzenegger is elected California governor after former governor Gray Davis’ recall. The actor served two terms as a Republican.\n\n· 2021: Schwarzenegger finalizes divorce from Maria Shriver after 35 years of marriage. They have four children together: Katherine (34) Christina (32) Patrick (30) and Christopher (26).\n\n· 2023: Schwarzenegger releases “FUBAR,” his first-ever starring role in a live-action TV series on Netflix.\n\nDiversified Income Streams\n\nBeyond the silver screen, Schwarzenegger’s income has been bolstered by numerous endorsements and commercial appearances, such as his recent cameo in State Farm’s 2024 Super Bowl ad. However, the bulk of his wealth has not come from acting alone. According to Forbes, approximately 65% of his entertainment earnings were consumed by taxes and fees, leaving him with a net sum significantly lower than his gross income. Additionally, his eight-year tenure as California’s governor, from 2003 to 2011, purportedly cost him another $200 million in potential Hollywood income.\n\nA Risk-Taking Investor\n\nOne of the cornerstones of Schwarzenegger’s financial success has been his willingness to embrace significant risks. In his autobiography, “Total Recall,” he expressed a clear preference for bold investments over conservative ones. This proclivity for high-stakes ventures is evident in his varied and often unconventional investment portfolio.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s foray into real estate began shortly after he arrived in California in 1968, using his bodybuilding earnings to purchase flat buildings in Santa Monica. By the time he achieved stardom, he was already a millionaire. His real estate ventures included redeveloping a Santa Monica block and purchasing and later selling a prime commercial building in Venice Beach. He also owned stakes in prestigious properties like the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills and the Easton Town Center in Ohio.\n\nMentored by investment legends like Warren Buffett, Schwarzenegger avoided trends he didn’t understand, such as cryptocurrencies, instead favouring established brands. His investments in Starbucks and Google have been particularly lucrative. Notably, his purchase of a minority stake in Dimensional Fund Advisors in 1996, now worth nearly $500 million, stands as a testament to his investment acumen.\n\nPersonal and Professional Setbacks\n\nDespite his financial triumphs, Schwarzenegger’s personal life has been tumultuous. His 2021 divorce from Maria Shriver, likely resulting in a significant division of assets, and allegations of misconduct during his gubernatorial campaign have marred his public image. Nevertheless, these setbacks have not deterred his relentless pursuit of success.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s involvement in Planet Hollywood alongside Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone, although ultimately unprofitable, showcased his resilience and strategic foresight. By negotiating protective measures in his investment, he managed to exit the venture relatively unscathed compared to other investors.\n\nThe Relentless Work Ethic\n\nA key to Schwarzenegger’s enduring success is his indomitable work ethic. Known for his disdain of the word “tired,” he maintains a rigorous schedule even today. Rising at 5 a.m. to care for his animals and exercise, he then tackles his business commitments with the same vigour that defined his bodybuilding and acting careers.\n\nIn recent years, Schwarzenegger has continued to engage with his audience through new media, including a Netflix documentary series and a subscription-based fitness app. His daily newsletter reaches 800,000 subscribers, further expanding his influence.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s transformation from a penniless Austrian immigrant to a Hollywood icon and now a billionaire investor epitomises the quintessential American dream. His story is one of relentless ambition, strategic risk-taking, and an unyielding work ethic. As he continues to evolve and adapt, Schwarzenegger remains a formidable figure in both the entertainment and business worlds, inspiring countless individuals with his journey of perseverance and success.\n\nThis story appears in the April/May 2024 issue of Forbes Magazine.\n\nPhoto: JOHN RUSSO/CONTOUR/GETTY IMAGES"
