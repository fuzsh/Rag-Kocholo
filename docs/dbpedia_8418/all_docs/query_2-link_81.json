        "text": "The Kennedy family is essentially American royalty, rising to particular prominence and fame during the period during which John F. Kennedy and his siblings had significant political power (which Jackie Kennedy referred to as Camelot). But the family has also been struck by much tragedy over the course of their long history, something the rest of the clan tries to honor. By now, the Kennedy family is expansive, with the grandchildren of JFK and his siblings coming into adulthood. A lot of them have similar names, often as a tribute to earlier ancestors, so let's break out who's who and what their names signify.\n\nStay In The Know\n\nMarie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

In her role, she writes stories that are syndicated by MSN and other outlets. She’s been a full-time freelancer for over a decade and has had roles with Cosmopolitan (where she covered lifestyle, culture, and fashion SEO content) and Bustle (where she was their movies and culture writer). She has bylines in New York Times, Parents, InStyle, Refinery29, and elsewhere. Her work has also been syndicated by ELLE, Harper’s Bazaar, Seventeen, Good Housekeeping, and Women’s Health, among others. In addition to her stories reaching millions of readers, content she's written and edited has qualified for a Bell Ringer Award and received a Communicator Award.\n\nKatherine has a BA in English and art history from the University of Notre Dame and an MA in art business from the Sotheby's Institute of Art (with a focus on marketing/communications). She covers a wide breadth of topics: she's written about how to find the very best petite jeans, how sustainable travel has found its footing on Instagram, and what it's like to be a professional advice-giver in the modern world. Her personal essays have run the gamut from learning to dress as a queer woman to navigating food allergies as a mom. She also has deep knowledge of SEO/EATT, affiliate revenue, commerce, and social media; she regularly edits the work of other writers. She speaks at writing-related events and podcasts about freelancing and journalism, mentors students and other new writers, and consults on coursework. Currently, Katherine lives in Boston with her husband and two kids, and you can follow her on Instagram. If you're wondering about her last name, it’s “I go to dinner,” not “Her huge ego,” but she responds to both."
