        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger, (born July 30, 1947, Thal, near Graz, Austria), Austrian-born U.S. film actor and politician. A bodybuilder in Austria, he moved to the U.S. in 1968 and won the title of Mr. Universe four times and Mr. Olympia seven times before retiring undefeated in 1980. After appearing in the documentary Pumping Iron (1977), he starred in Conan the Barbarian (1982) and its sequel, Conan the Destroyer (1984). Noted for his extraordinary physique and heavy accent, he became an international star with The Terminator (1984), which became a hugely successful franchise. His other films during this time included Kindergarten Cop (1990), Total Recall (1990), True Lies (1994), and The 6th Day (2000). Schwarzenegger became active in the Republican Party and served as governor of California (2003â€“11). He later returned to acting, appearing in such movies as The Last Stand (2013), Sabotage (2014), Terminator Genisys (2015), and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019)."
