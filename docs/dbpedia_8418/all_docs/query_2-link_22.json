Arnold essentially means “power of the eagle”. The Norman-French brought the name over to England after the Conquest of 1066 where it was at first rendered as “Earnwæld” in Olde English. There were a couple early European saints who bore this name which helped its popularity in medieval times (especially among Frankish and Germanic Christians). The early 7th century Arnulf of Metz and the 11th century Arnold of Soissons are among the most notable and, incidentally, both are patron saints of brewers, hops-pickers and beer. The eagle has always been a symbol of imperial power, so we can definitely see the name’s appeal. By the time of the Renaissance and early Modern Era, the name Arnold seemed destined for obscurity until a revival in the 19th century. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Arnold Palmer are probably the most well-known Arnolds of today. Arnie is a common nickname.\n\nAll About the Baby Name – Arnold\n\nPersonality\n\nOF THE BOY NAME ARNOLD\n\nThe number one personality is a leader - strong and competitive. They are willing to initiate action and take risks. One personalities work hard toward their endeavors and have the ability to apply their creative and innovative thinking skills with strong determination. They believe in their ability to succeed and are too stubborn to be hindered by obstacles. Ones meet obstacles head-on with such mental vigor and energy that you better step aside. They resent taking orders, so don't try telling them what to do either. This is an intensely active personality, but they are also known as starters rather than finishers. They have a propensity to become bored and will move quickly to the next project if not properly challenged. They are the ones to think up and put into action new and brilliant ideas, but they are not the ones to stick around and manage them. This personality has an enthusiastic and pioneering spirit. They are distinctly original.\n\nPopularity\n\nOF THE BOY NAME ARNOLD\n\nArnold is an example of a masculine personal name that has completely gone out of style. The name entered the 20th century at respectable levels of success and hit its high point during the 19-teens and 20s (although #89 is the highest position he ever achieved in 1916). Arnold gradually diminished in popularity as the 20th century wore on. By the 21st century this was a name on his way out the door. Losing Top 1000 status in 2005, old Arnold is no longer on the American radar. Less than 100 baby boys are given “eagle power” per year now.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nON ARNOLD\n\nGENDER:\n\nBoy\n\nORIGIN:\n\nEnglish\n\nNUMBER OF SYLLABLES:\n\n2\n\nRANKING POPULARITY:\n\nN/A\n\nPRONUNCIATION:\n\nAHR-nәld\n\nSIMPLE MEANING:\n\nEagle power\n\nCharacteristics\n\nOF ARNOLD\n\nIndependent\n\nIndividualistic\n\nAmbitious\n\nStrong-willed\n\nInventive\n\nSuccessful\n\nCultural References to the Baby Name – Arnold\n\nLiterary Characters\n\nOF THE BABY NAME ARNOLD\n\nWe cannot find any significant literary characters by the name of Arnold\n\nChildrens Books\n\nON THE BABY NAME ARNOLD\n\nWe cannot find any childrens books with the first name Arnold\n\nPopular Songs\n\nON ARNOLD\n\nI Want To Look Like Arnold\n\na song by The Arrogant Worms\n\nArnold Layne\n\na song by Pink Floyd\n\nFamous People\n\nNAMED ARNOLD\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (actor turned politician)\n\nArnold Palmer (PGA golfer)\n\nArnold Toynbee (historian)\n\nArnold Schoenberg (Austrian composer)\n\nArnold Houbraken (Dutch painter)\n\nArnold Bax (English composer)\n\nArnold Bennett (English author)\n\nChildren of Famous People\n\nNAMED ARNOLD\n\nWe cannot find any children of famous people with the first name Arnold\n\nHistoric Figures\n\nWITH THE NAME ARNOLD\n\nWe cannot find any historically significant people with the first name Arnold"
