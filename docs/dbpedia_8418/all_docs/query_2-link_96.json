        "text": "Charles Atlas (born October 30, 1892, Acri, Calabria, Italy—died December 24, 1972, Long Beach, New York, U.S.) was an Italian-born American bodybuilder and physical culturist who, with Frederick Tilney and Charles P. Roman, created and marketed a highly popular mail-order bodybuilding course.\n\nIn 1904 Angelo Siciliano immigrated to the United States with his mother and settled in Brooklyn, New York. Skinny and weak, he suffered beatings by a neighbourhood bully and his uncle. The statues of Hercules and other mythological heroes that he saw in a local museum inspired him to build his body. Too poor to afford barbells, he devised a system, later called Dynamic-Tension, that pitted one muscle group against another. Neighbourhood friends soon started likening him to a statue of Atlas. This association was then combined with the nickname “Charley” to form the name by which he eventually became famous.\n\nWith his newfound muscles and confidence, Atlas joined the circus-vaudeville circuit and appeared in Coney Island sideshows, where he performed a variety of strongman feats. He also worked as an artist’s model for many sculpted works of classic American heroes on public buildings in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio, and he won such titles as the World’s Most Handsome Man and the World’s Most Perfectly Developed Man at contests staged by physical culturist Bernarr Macfadden at Madison Square Garden in 1921 and 1922, respectively."
