        "text": "Originating from Germany, the name Arnold possesses a Germanic ancestry. The name is composed of two elements: \"arn,\" meaning \"eagle,\" and \"walt,\" meaning \"power.\" This fusion of elements bestows upon the name the profound meaning of \"eagle power.\" The Normans, known for their influential presence in England, introduced the name to the region, where it gradually replaced the Old English cognate Earnweald. Despite its decline as an English name during the Middle Ages, the 19th century witnessed its resurgence in popularity. The name has been associated with notable individuals throughout history, including Saint Arnold, an 8th-century musician in the court of Charlemagne, and Arnold of Brescia, a 12th-century monk who challenged the Church. In the realm of contemporary figures, the name is synonymous with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-American actor and politician, and Arnold Palmer, the legendary American golfer."
