Two decades later, a wave of Schwartz members began arriving in Philadelphia: Abraham Schwartz in 1727.\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Schwarzenegger (post 1700) +\n\nArnold Alois Schwarzenegger (b. 1947), American Republican politician, Governor of California, 2003- 1\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nCitations +\n\nThe Political Graveyard: Alphabetical Name Index.
