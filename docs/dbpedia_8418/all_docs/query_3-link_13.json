High in the Alps? (On a dark northern slope?)\n\nThanks, in advance, for the feedback.\n\nYes, Arnold is contains the root arn- (eagle) and wald-/walt- (to rule). He is from SE Austria, not from Switzerland. There are several Schwarzeneggs (which indeed means black corner) in the Alpine region.\n\nWhere, exactly, is Schwarzenegg, in Switzerland? High in the Alps?\n\nThe Schwarzenegg located between Unterlangenegg and Oberlangenegg is located at an altitude of less than 1000 meters what isn't high for me.\n\nThe Schwarzenegg located between Unterlangenegg and Oberlangenegg is located at an altitude of less than 1000 meters what isn't high for me.\n\nThat Schwarzenegg is almost certainly irrelevant here. The family is from the area of the Styrian side of the Semering pass in Austria. In Styria I know a Schwarzenegg castle about 20 miles south of Graz. But there are or were most certainly more more local toponyms Schwazenegg.\n\nWasn't there a news story some years ago about how the town/village of Schwarzenegg disowned its most famous son because of some political statement he had made? In that case it ought to be possible to identify which Schwarzenegg is intended.\n\nYou probably mean the Merkur Arena in Graz which used to be called Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Stadion. The controversy was about his refusal to stop an execution as governor of California."
