        "text": "Schwarzenegger, not Schwarzeneggar.\n\nMorphological analysis is Schwarz-en-egg-er. Egg is an Upper-German (i.e. Southern) variant of Ecke = corner, cognate to English edge. Here it carries an older meaning: a mountain-peak, -edge or -slope. An Egger is someone who lives there. Schwarz means black, schwarzen is an accusative or dative form, though the inflected form might be just schwarze in which case -n- is a kind of \"glue\" letter without meaning; both analyses are possible, you can't tell and it doesn't matter.\n\nHence, a Schwarzenegger is someone who lives on a black mountain-peak, -edge or -slope.\n\nThank you kindly for your thorough response, Berndf. I feel pretty silly to even have, but I'd sometimes wonder about how the surname came about when I'd hear his name mentioned on TV or in film. I wonder if I'm the only one. Oh well. Thank you again, Berndf.\n\nHi,\n\nwhat can we do in such cases where several possibilities are given?\n\nWe can look how family names were created.\n\nIn our case we have three possible variants as stated in different messages.\n\n1. Schwarzenegg -> the person from Schwarzenegg\n\n2. profession - someone using an egg would declare \"egger\", \"Schwarzen\" remains unclear. The Egge is a kind of plough. We would have ... ploughsman\n\n\"Schwarzen\" is unclear, it can be the color, but it can also be a name of a special ground (Schwarzerde?) But this is speculation. \"Egger\" from \"Acker\" would not make sense.\n\n3. \"nigger\" is not possible because of German word building rules. It would not explain the glotal stop in German.\n\nHow can we decide whether 1) or 2) are correct?\n\nThere is much evidence for 1:\n\n1. The name corresponds to \"Schwarzenegg\". It follows common name building rules. 2. Schwarzenegg is not big. So we can suppose the name is seldom.\n\n3. The name has some places where it is concentrated.\n\nWhy doesn't it seem a profession?\n\nNames were often derived from professions. But the profession must exist.\n\n\"Egger\" would be a profession if there were a high degree of division of labour. But it is a part time job in the year to use the egge, and every farmer did it.\n\nCommon profession names were Bauer, MÃ¼ller, Meier, Lehmann and some others of this kind. And they are not seldom. This is a strong evidence against the \"profession\" hypothesis.\n\nThe name \"Egger\"is not seldom and it has connection to similar names.\n\nYou can see the distribution:\n\nhttp://christoph.stoepel.net/geogen/v3/Default.aspx\n\nEnter the name there and you can get the properties.\n\nIf you enter \"Egger\" and goto \"Namensfamilie\" you can see similar names. So it can be a profession name or a place name related to \"Acker\" or \"Egge\".\n\nBut we cannot explain the \"Schwarzen\"-part here.\n\nI vote for \"the one from Schwarzenegg\".\n\nThis cheats a little bit about etymology, because it does not explain the \"Schwarzen\" part, but I suppose it is\n\n\"The edge of Schwarz\" and Schwarz is the name of the founder or of the place owner in earlier times, or it is the name of a river or of the place.\n\nHere http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Schwarzenegg they say there was a \"Schwarzhof\" as source for the place.\n\nIf you look here: http://www.verwandt.at/karten/detail/schwarzenegger.html\n\nyou can see \"Schwarzenegger\" distribution in Austria. It does not give a hint for \"profession etymology\"."
