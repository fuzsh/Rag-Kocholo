Braunbeck Synopsis: In Silent Graves is the first book of the Cedar Hill series. One moment, Robert Londrigan is an up-and-coming newscaster, devoted husband, and father-to-be; the next, he’s a widower in a morgue, staring at gaping holes in his daughter’s body where surgeons have harvested every useful scrap of her organs and tissue. The rock-bottom falls out from under his life when a disfigured man knocks Robert out and steals what’s left of her tiny corpse out from under his nose, and leaves a gruesome surprise waiting for him back home. Robert’s search for the disfigured man leads him through a rapidly-fragmenting reality into a chiaroscuro world and the discovery that neither his wife nor his daughter are who he thought they were.\n\nWe do our best to get everything listed but the occasional book gets by us.
