But I also dedicate this new edition to Letty, who read the novel when it first appeared in 1992 and in all the years since has never stopped complaining about the one part of the plot she didn’t like.\n\nThanks to Alice Alfonsi, who originally acquired and edited the novel, and to Andrew Zack, who made this new edition possible.\n\nTHE\n\nVAMPIRE’S\n\nA P P R E N T I C E\n\n1\n\nDavid Brent awoke to pain and darkness.\n\nHis whole body ached, with sharper pains in his abdomen and left nostril, down the sides of his neck, and, worst of all, in his mouth. Disoriented, he groped about and discovered he was lying in a padded box.\n\nTiny cups adhered to his eyes. He scratched them off, but the world stayed black.\n\nNothing made sense. It wasn’t supposed to hurt, and he wasn’t supposed to wake up in a coffin.\n\nHe pushed the lid; it wouldn’t budge.\n\nHe tried to call Carter’s name and found that he couldn’t speak.\n\nWith tongue and trembling hands he explored his mouth. Inside it, wads of cloth covered raw tissue. His canines had lengthened. Someone had sewn his lips together, and driven two long pins through the lower one and between his upper front teeth to make him smile.\n\nWas it only a joke, or had he been embalmed?\n\nThe possibility revolted him. He imagined vomit trapped in his sealed mouth, choking him, and his nausea intensified. But he didn’t throw up; maybe he couldn’t anymore.\n\nWhen the sickness abated, he drew out the pins, cringing as they scraped against his incisors and slid through his lip.\n\nThen he worked his thumb and forefinger between his lips so he could pick at the thread with his nails. When it broke and he began pulling it out, he realized that the stitches ran all the way up into his nose. Once again the sensation of foreign matter dragging through his flesh made him flinch and twitch.\n\nAt last he could open his mouth. He pulled out the wadding, then cautiously fondled the sore spots. His undertaker had whittled him.\n\nCarter! It hurt to shout, but he didn’t care. Carter, I’m awake; let me out!\n\nNobody answered.\n\n\"Carter, it’s not funny. Let me out!\"\n\nStill no reply.\n\nIt was a joke. Or a test, or an initiation. Unless something had gone wrong.\n\nHe was gasping, kneading the mattress; he struggled to calm down. Whatever was going on, he could free himself from the casket; he had powers now.\n\nCarter was strong enough to muscle his way out of a coffin. But David didn’t feel strong; he felt frail and afflicted.\n\nCarter could also become intangible, a shadow who could slip through solid matter. Somehow that seemed like it might be easier, or at least more pleasant, than breaking his prison apart. If his body turned to mist, maybe it wouldn’t hurt.\n\nBut he didn’t know how to change; Carter was supposed to teach him.\n\nIt had to be mind over matter, didn’t it? If he willed it to happen, expected it to happen, then it would. He settled himself as comfortably as he could, then concentrated.\n\nMy body is becoming thin as air. First my feet will disappear, then my calves, then my knees, then—\n\nWhen it happened, it happened suddenly, startling him and breaking his concentration. An icy tingling stabbed his feet, then swept up his body, engulfing everything but his head and right arm. The pain in his abdomen vanished; he couldn’t feel his legs at all.\n\nHe waited for the tingling to absorb the rest of him. Eventually he realized it wasn’t going to.\n\nMaybe nothing had really happened. Maybe he’d only deluded himself, anesthetized himself with autohypnosis. He hesitantly raised his right hand and passed it through the empty space where his stomach should have been.\n\nHe was a severed head and arm. He tittered uncontrollably, had a mad desire to stick his hand up his open neck-hole and feel around inside.\n\nHe couldn’t stay like this; he’d lose his mind. He fought to regain the meditative focus that had triggered the transformation, but dread and revulsion rendered it unattainable.\n\nAnd now he somehow sensed he was in danger. His ghostly limbs and organs would disperse; already his left hand and right leg were breaking apart. He shrieked and pounded the coffin lid; his new fangs shredded his lip. It isn’t supposed to be like this! No, no, no, no, NO . . .\n\nHis flesh congealed in a flash of agony. After a time the pain of reintegration contracted into a fierce new ache pulsing in his right thigh.\n\nFor a long while he just lay there shuddering. If this was a test, all right, he’d failed it. If it was a joke, he’d humiliated himself sufficiently to satisfy even the most sadistic prankster. So why didn’t Carter let him out?\n\nBecause Carter really wasn’t here. The coffin was probably in some funeral home; if he didn’t get out, they’d bury him.\n\nHe didn’t dare try becoming a phantom again. But since he had that capability, maybe he had superhuman strength too, even if he did feel like a terminal cancer patient.\n\nHe shoved the lid again, as hard as he could. Spasms racked his arms; it still didn’t move.\n\nThen he really was as weak as he felt. At last he found the courage to touch the sutured incisions in his neck, to slip his hand inside his shirt and finger the puckered hole. If he was in a funeral home, then of course he’d been embalmed, his blood pumped out and chemicals pumped in. That was why his powers didn’t work right, why he was in so much pain; the mortician had crippled him.\n\nAnguished, he howled and clutched at the padding above his face; satin-covered foam rubber burst like a puffball.\n\nHe flexed his fingers, blinked in surprise. Even though he felt weak, he was strong, stronger than he’d ever been before. If pushing the lid didn’t work, maybe beating on it would. He enlarged the hole he’d torn in the padding, then slammed his fist into the metal beneath.\n\nIt hurt worse than it would have before Carter bit him, because the impact jolted his entire stricken body. He kept punching anyway. The coffin rang like an anvil, thrusting spikes of noise into his ears.\n\nAfter twenty blows his fist hurt as if he’d crushed it in a vise, so he switched to his other hand. When it was equally sore, he ran his fingertips over the lid. He’d cracked it.\n\nHe worked his fingers into the crack; its jagged edges pared flesh away. When he’d gotten as good a grip as he could manage, he pulled.\n\nThe metal screeched as it came apart. He expected light, or at least a darkness less absolute, but everything was as black as before.\n\nHe reached through the gap and touched stone.\n\nHe hadn’t been able to push the coffin lid open because it was sealed in a concrete vault lying under six feet of earth; they’d already buried him.\n\nHe sobbed, and found that his eyes refused to tear. Everything hurt so badly, especially his hands. He couldn’t smash and claw through another barrier; he just didn’t have it in him.\n\nBut then again, he didn’t have much of a choice.\n\nGravel showered into his face; dust sifted into his tattered mouth. Surely he’d flayed his hands; there couldn’t be any meat left on them.\n\nAfter an eternity the concrete turned to soil.\n\nFirst he dug lying on his back, then sitting up, then finally standing, his body jammed into the suffocating shaft like a cork in a bottle, dirt cascading over his head and shoulders to land in the casket below.\n\nCrazy fears came creeping into his mind. What if the coffin had been buried upside down; what if he was tunneling the wrong way? Or what if it was daytime overhead; he’d be burnt to ash by the sun.\n\nHis hands broke free, pushed aside what must be a blanket of sod.\n\nHe scrabbled to enlarge the space above him. Then, clutching, kicking toeholds, he wormed his way upward, to emerge in a field of stones and flowers bleached by a skull-white moon.\n\n2\n\nThey’d buried him next to his grandfather.\n\nHe crawled over to the bronze veteran’s marker to make sure of the inscription, then slumped down on the grass. Liz and his parents knew he’d died; he could never see them again.\n\nPain finally spurred him into motion, pain and the fear of discovery. He didn’t want to be seen like this, a filthy thing with skinned, oozing hands and ragged lips.\n\nPerhaps he could be healed. Only another Olympian could tell him, and Carter was the only one he knew. Carter must be dead or in trouble, but he might have left a journal or even some sovereign elixir in his house in Sulphur Springs. It was at least a possibility; it gave him somewhere to go and something to hope for.\n\nHe stood up, took a step, and nearly fell. He was knock-kneed; his right leg twisted inward, and extended an inch or two longer than his left. He was going to lurch and stagger as he walked.\n\nBefore he set out, he tried to fill the shaft he’d dug, but without a spade, it was hopeless. All he could do was rearrange the squares of sod, knowing full well that some groundskeeper would discover the hole beneath them in a day or so. His mother’s heart must be breaking already; she’d feel even worse when she heard his body had disappeared. He hadn’t expected to grieve her, but still he felt ashamed.\n\nShadow drenched the field, though the sky above was gray with city light. Angels and Madonnas slipped out of the darkness to sneer as he stumbled by.\n\nAll too soon he ran out of graveyard. Beyond a low concrete wall lay one of Tampa’s seedier districts, a tangle of narrow streets lined with shacks and decrepit cars. There wouldn’t be many streetlights or much through traffic, but he still couldn’t walk all the way to Carter’s house without somebody seeing him.\n\nHe turned up the collar of his grimy suit coat and brushed his hair down into his face, bowed his head and stuck his hands in his pockets. If people didn’t look at him too closely, maybe they’d mistake him for a tramp.\n\nDirt pattered down from his hair and clothes; his right foot scraped along the pavement. Odors hung across his path like curtains: exhaust, skunk, acrid smoke from a trash fire. He turned down a side street to avoid a church; Carter had assured him that holy symbols and consecrated ground couldn’t hurt him, but he wanted to keep his distance from the bingo players milling around outside.\n\nAfter a while he began to get thirsty.\n\nDry mouth, clogged throat; it felt like any other thirst. Carter drank tea and wine, so maybe it was just an ordinary thirst. David didn’t want to start craving blood, not now; he had problems and miseries enough without that.\n\nOlympians didn’t terrify or brutalize their victims; they seduced them, used them tenderly, then set them free with vague memories of an erotic dream. He’d fantasized about it a thousand times, never dreaming that he’d return maimed and repellent, with no one to teach him mesmerism or proper biting technique.\n\nFrom twenty-four-year-old virgin to sexually retarded undead. It was almost funny.\n\nHe wished they’d buried him with his watch. It must be fairly late; he’d passed bars, a Circle K, and a barbecue joint that were open, but the other businesses he’d seen had already closed. If he couldn’t reach Carter’s before dawn, he’d have to find another place to hide.\n\nHis thirst grew gradually worse, waxing from a slight discomfort to a torment that rivaled, and at certain moments eclipsed, his other pains. Sometimes, when it was at its most unbearable, he blacked out; after his head cleared, he discovered that he’d stopped walking, or blundered off the berm and was zigzagging down the middle of the street.\n\nSatan rules!\n\nThe shout burst out of nowhere, snapping him out of yet another daze. He lost his balance and sat down hard. The old red convertible, its scalloped tailfins reared like a dragon’s wings, careened on down the block.\n\nDavid shivered; they’d only missed him by inches. And now they were backing around; their headlights flicked from low to high beam, searing his eyes with glare. Maybe they were turning around because they’d seen his face.\n\nHe yearned to run, but somehow managed not to. Maybe they hadn’t seen his face; maybe they were turning for some other reason. If so, he mustn’t make himself suspicious. He got up and hobbled on down the street.\n\nThe convertible growled, then lunged forward. As it roared past, the kids inside, four long-haired metal heads in studded leather, hooted and threw a barrage of empty beer cans. One hit his shoulder; two others clattered at his feet.\n\nHis eyes squinched shut, burned with tears that wouldn’t flow. All through school he’d been afraid of bullies; even after he grew up, tough-looking teenagers intimidated him just as much as ever. Now he was an Olympian, strong enough to rend rock and metal, and he was still petrified. It wasn’t fair!\n\nThe convertible backed around again.\n\nThey hadn’t seen his face, at least not clearly. If they knew he was a living corpse, they might flee or try to run him down, but they wouldn’t taunt him or pelt him with garbage. They thought he was just a derelict, someone they could harass without fear of reprisal. Maybe he could make them lose interest before they found out any different.\n\nIn school, bullies generally got bored more quickly if he didn’t resist or react. He lay down and curled up on the ground.\n\nThe convertible stopped a few feet away. Another hail of beer cans flew, clipping him on the hip and the back of the head.\n\nHey, wino!\n\nWhat’s the matter, asshole?\n\nGet up, gimp, and I’ll give you a beer!\n\nYeah, get up, you fucking dirtbag!\n\nDon’t let them get out of the car, he thought. Please, don’t let them out of the car.\n\nOne of them threw a final can; then they laughed and drove away.\n\nHe waited for their taillights to disappear, then stood up. He told himself he should feel proud; he’d thought his way out of a dangerous situation.\n\nBut he didn’t feel proud; his bowels churned with rage and humiliation. What good were powers and immortality if you were afraid all the time? If you had to let people piss on you?\n\nHe promised himself it wouldn’t be that way for long; everything would change once he got to Carter’s.\n\nIt was good he could pass for a mortal, but bad that he was encrusted with dirt. Other kids might accost him and so might a cop. He needed to wash and change his clothes.\n\nHe couldn’t have entered a bar, store, or restaurant even if he’d had any money. But maybe he could find an outdoor faucet or laundry hanging on a clothesline.\n\nOr maybe he could sneak into Johnson’s Klean-Kwik 24 Hour Laundromat.\n\nIt was a long cinder-block building with no front wall, sitting at one end of an L-shaped shopping plaza. There were three cars in the parking lot, a couple of washers sloshing and dryers groaning, but nobody visible inside. The customers must be waiting in the sandwich shop next door, or in their apartments across the street.\n\nIt wouldn’t take long to drink and wash, then hunt for clothes that fit him. Someone might walk in on him, but he was willing to risk it. If he took a chance, maybe he wouldn’t feel like such a coward.\n\nSuddenly his thirst intensified; his vision blurred, he felt faint. If he blacked out now, he might stand in front of the Laundromat like a statue, or even wander into the delicatessen. He broke into a cripple’s run, collided with a wheeled metal cart and a Lance vending machine as he reeled toward the sink mounted on the back wall.\n\nHe frantically twisted the faucet handle, then bent over and guzzled. The water was cold, wet ecstasy.\n\nHe drank for at least a minute, the first pleasurable minute since he’d awakened. Just as he was straightening up, someone’s finger stabbed him in the back.\n\nAre you doing laundry? It was an old woman’s voice, scratchy and querulous. \"You shouldn’t be in here unless . . . What’s the matter with your hands?\"\n\nWhere had she come from, had she been here all the— It didn’t make any difference! All that mattered was keeping his back turned and getting out. Fortunately, there was a rear entrance just a few steps away.\n\nIt’s a skin condition, he babbled, not contagious, not nearly as bad as it looks. Sorry I came in, I knew I shouldn’t, I just–\n\nHis stomach convulsed. He fell to his knees, clutched his middle, and retched; it seemed he could throw up after all.\n\nWhat are you doing? the old woman yelped. Go outside, go outside!\n\nHe wished he could, but the pain wouldn’t let him. The water came up mixed with waxy lumps of something the embalmer had pumped into him, a combination that resembled pus.\n\nWhen at last he stopped heaving, he rose, trembling and ataxic, and dragged himself on toward the door. The old woman’s footsteps came clicking after him.\n\nJust where do you think you’re going?\n\nWhy couldn’t they leave him alone? Please . . . I have to–\n\n\"What you have to do is clean that up!\" She grabbed his shoulder and spun him around.\n\nShe looked gaunt as a straw in her baggy flowered dress, her receding hair like dandelion fluff. Her eyes bulged; she gasped in air for a scream.\n\nThirst blasted him. He knew what he was about to do and couldn’t stop.\n\nHe lunged forward, slammed into her, carried her down beneath him. Her head cracked against the cement floor, but she didn’t pass out. She was writhing, slapping, kicking, scratching, about to try to scream again. He grabbed her by the hair and collar and sank his teeth into the side of her neck.\n\nShe kept struggling and pulling away; blood splashed his face like spray from a trick boutonniere, ran uselessly down a drain. He bit again and again, until he’d savaged her throat into sponge. At last she stopped thrashing, though she still twitched and quivered, and he could lick and suck at her wounds.\n\nHer blood tasted unspeakably vile.\n\n3\n\nHer face.\n\nHer white, contorted face.\n\nHe wrenched his eyes away, scrambled up, bolted. His foot slipped in a smear of blood and he crashed back onto the floor. The impact shrieked through his tortured nerves, shocked some of the panic out of him.\n\nHe couldn’t run yet. He needed to wash and change his clothes worse than ever, now that he was spattered with gore. And someone would find the old woman within the hour if he didn’t hide her.\n\nWhen he bent to pick her up, he started shaking.\n\nCome on, he told himself, damn it, come on! You sure didn’t have any trouble touching her a minute ago. He thrust out his hands, then gasped and jerked them away.\n\nShe moved.\n\nNo, she didn’t, it was just his imagination. She couldn’t be alive, not with those gashes, not with her blood in his stomach.\n\nTouching her was even harder the second time. He hauled her up and embraced her, then manhandled her across the floor. Her head flopped on his shoulder as if she meant to whisper in his ear.\n\nHe stuffed her into a dryer, then pulled an Out of Order sign off one of the washers and stuck it on the window. If he had a quarter, he could send her tumbling around and around . . .\n\nHe ground his fists together until the pain cleared his head.\n\nA mop and bucket were sitting by the sink. He flushed the blood and vomit down the floor drain, then stripped to the waist. His chest"
