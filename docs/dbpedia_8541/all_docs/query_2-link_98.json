It was at a tennis tournament in New York City that she met her husband R. Michael Dunne. She and Mike were a great pair during their 48-year marriage. They became longtime residents of Greenwich, Connecticut, where they raised their two children and participated wholeheartedly in the social and civic life of the town. They loved to travel to tennis tournaments, and paid annual visits to Pinehurst and Lake Placid, New York, where Renee had spent summers growing up. Sadly, Mike died much too soon in 2008. Renee was a Welcome Wagon representative for almost 20 years, greeting new Greenwich homeowners and providing them with community information. It was a job she enjoyed, and it was well suited to her friendly nature. To those who knew her, Renee will be remembered as a truly kind person who had many lifelong friends. She had a pronounced penchant for positive thinking. She always wanted to see the good in life, to the point that her children would joke about her preference for G-rated movies and “good music.” She and Mike strove to provide a warm, loving, and welcoming home for family and friends, and nothing made them happier than a reason to hold a celebration, whether at the Field Club or their home. Renee is survived by her daughter Patricia Lewis, son Michael Dunne, daughter-in-law Chieko Dunne, and grandchildren Reilly, Caroline, Sophie, Sam Lewis and Mika Dunne, her sister Jacqueline Chamandy and her sister-in-law Claudia Razook.

Janet was born on July 28,1940 in Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada to the late Gertrude Harkness Duff and Gordon Alexander Duff, MD. During her childhood and teenage years, she enjoyed spending summers at the family cottage in Amethyst Bay on Lake Superior. Janet was also an excellent figure skater, a very talented pianist and dancer, and participated in many skating competitions and dance recitals. She shared many stories reflecting on times when her friends always counted on her to lead them on their next fun adventure. At age 14 the family moved to Florida. Janet enrolled in Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina, graduated and then attended Florida State University at age 17 due to her keen intelligence and academic achievements.

They visited almost every continent, enjoying the different cultures and cuisines. We all delighted in hearing the many entertaining and adventurous stories of their travels. Janet was a “spitfire” with a zest for life, a little Southern Sass, a contagious laugh, fantastic sense of humor, and a masterful storyteller. She had an abundance of love for her family and was a friend to everyone that was lucky enough to meet her. Her many talents included being a gourmet cook and hosting many parties and celebrations for her family and friends. She had the special distinction of being the best “Grammy” in the world to her two grandsons and filled their lives with much love and happiness. The world will shine a little less bright, but we will all carry a little piece of Janet within us.\n\nBrooks Stuckey Cathcart ’63 | Brooks Taber Cathcart was born on March 3, 1945 in Columbia, SC, to Mary Belle Taber and William Brooks Stuckey. She was lovingly named Julia Brooks Taber Stuckey after her aunt, Julia Mood Peterkin, her father and her mother. However when she later married, rules required that she drop the Julia and the Stuckey on account of one lady should not have “so many names” on her social security card, and she elegantly moved through the rest of her life as Brooks Taber Cathcart. Or, as many affectionately knew her, “Brooksie”, “Aunt Brooks” and our beloved, “Nana”. Brooks spent her early years at Fox Hill, a magical corner of her family farm, Lang Syne, in Fort Motte, SC, where her cousins were like siblings and her playground consisted of live oaks and horses. Her childhood summers were often spent in Murrells Inlet with her cousins, swimming, crabbing, swinging and just sitting on the dock, absorbing the art of story-telling from her many aunts and uncles, a gift she thoroughly enjoyed sharing with her own nieces and nephews, children and grandchildren, whenever the opportunity arose, happiest, of course, doing so with a grand baby on her lap and a cup of coffee nearby. When Brooks was nearing school age her parents, always keen to provide their only daughter with the best possible opportunities, relocated to Columbia, SC so that she could attend AC Moore Elementary School. There she took great delight in the many new friends, unending supply of library books and covert trading of candy on the playground, three loves that would remain true for the whole of her life. Once of high school age, Brooks attended boarding school at Ashley Hall, in Charleston, SC, where she discovered her passion for English, reading, writing, and her favorite of all, chatting, nurtured her love of the low country and formed cherished friendships that would last her lifetime. Brooks went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of South Carolina, and later completed the majority of course work for a Master’s degree in early childhood education before “retiring” from academics to raise her small children. A lifelong lover of all things beautiful, Brooks found her “heart” home in Paris while spending college summers in France with her Aunt Margaret. The influence remained with her always, emerging in her flair for decoration and fashion, the many beautiful impressionist paintings she created, her true love of Hemingway, Stein, Fitzgerald and all of the Left Bank expats, and of course, her ability to make a perfect quiche.\n\nBrooks spent her adult years juggling life and children, and during that time enjoyed many career endeavors, all characteristically centered on human connection and relationship. The career she was most passionate about and known for was her career in counseling families and individuals through addiction and recovery, a fitting and meaningful tribute to her own life and love of family, and a legacy of which she and her children were and are very proud. Brooks was a brilliant, beautiful, wise and passionate person whose big brown eyes, bright smile and characteristic ‘hey, darling’ lit up every room and warmed every heart lucky enough to be with her. She was an accomplished and talented painter in her own right, and a voracious reader and connoisseur of movies. She loved, almost more than anything, sharing her paintings, a meaningful quote or anecdote from her latest book, or her recommendation of a recently watched (or re-watched) medieval Netflix drama. But by far her favorite moments, it seemed, were the ones spent on the porch in Little Switzerland sharing love and laughter with her dear friends, children, nieces and nephews, in-laws and of course, her greatest loves, her grandchildren.\n\nMary Cantey Dunn ’64 | Mary Dunn Mary Dunn, of Essex, Connecticut and Vero Beach, Florida died on July 5 after suffering complications from a massive seizure. She was 76 years old. Mary was born and raised in Camden, South Carolina, the daughter of Roderick H. Cantey and Barbara (Zemp) Cantey. She attended high school at Ashley Hall in Charleston. She adored her time there, and credited the school for fostering her avid interest in theater. She scored 1600 on her SATs and in 1964 was accepted to Radcliffe, but her father insisted on Virginia’s Sweet Briar College instead. She majored in military and diplomatic history there and appeared in a number of theatrical productions, most notably Antigone. But she was rocketed into the fourth dimension when she traveled to the Sorbonne in Paris for her junior year abroad. Food, fashion, beauty and art were hers for the devouring. She pranced around in mini dresses and false eyelashes, emulating Twiggy, smoking Gauloises cigarettes and having the time of her life. She was even briefly engaged to an Englishman. After graduating from Sweet Briar, she settled in Manhattan landing her first job as an ad trafficker for NBC. It was this job that introduced her to her husband of 53 years, an ad executive for Grey Advertising at the time, Toby Dunn. She left NBC to join TIME magazine as a picture researcher and from there went on to become one of the founding staff members of PEOPLE magazine. In fact she got to PEOPLE before there was a PEOPLE, and was there when the first 35 cent issue came out, dated March 4, 1974. Her role as picture editor for the magazine was crucial to its success. With her colleagues in the photo department, she attracted the world’s best photographers and practically invented a unique style of story-telling in black and white photography (and later color). She was smart, tough, funny, creative, a good negotiator, worthy of respect and trust, and serious when she had to be. She had fresh ideas for photos even after 14 shoots with Farrah Fawcett. She had the patience and knowledge to get a good cover out of difficult subjects. She’s also credited with PEOPLE’s “Sexiest Man Alive” issue, as it was she who exclaimed humorously in the layout room looking at a picture of Mel Gibson in 1985. When Mary left PEOPLE to become the Director of Photography for ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY in 1994, PEOPLE was one of the most successful magazines in the world. Her contribution was inestimable. In addition to dedicating the last decade of her 30-year-TIME INC. career to ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY, Mary covered Olympics ceremonies in Lake Placid and Tokyo. Upon her retirement, Jess Cagle, EW’s then Editorial Director, described her as an elegant, southern spitfire who spoke her mind freely. Mary suffered a brain aneurysm in 1999 shortly after her retirement, the after-effects of which periodically affected her. She was fortunate to spend much of her life in Manhattan, a city she adored for all of its rich offerings – and she spent the last 24 years traveling, wintering in Harbour Island in the Bahamas, and enjoying a slower, less hectic pace of life with her two cats always by her side.\n\nMarsha Hass ’64 | Marsha E. Hass, a highly regarded legal scholar and Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Business Law at the College of Charleston, passed away on July 17, 2023. Born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1946, Marsha was the daughter of the late Della Jo and Paul G. Hass. She is survived by a nephew whom she adored, Hunter Philbrick (Clementine) and a great-nephew Hudson and great-niece, Delphine. Hunter was never further than a phone call away and he could always brighten her day. She was preceded in death by her sister, Jane Hass Philbrick. Marsha displayed remarkable intelligence from an early age. After graduating from Ashley Hall, she completed her B.A. at Clemson University (1968), joining the first group of women to live in a women’s dormitory at Clemson. She was an active member of Chi Omega Sorority. She loved sports, and as an avid Clemson fan remained loyal to her Alma Mater while cheering all Tiger teams and proudly displaying Tiger paws. She earned M.A.T., M.B.A. and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of South Carolina. She was a complex person with great ability and talent. She grew up and worked in a man’s world and was not afraid to speak her mind. Early in her career she practiced Family Law and served as a Folly Beach Magistrate. She was especially proud of the fact that the police learned quickly not to bring in cases against prostitutes unless they also brought in the johns. She resigned this post because it broke her heart to witness the circumstances of the children. She was a fair but demanding professor at the College of Charleston in Business Law, commencing in 1976, until her retirement in 2000. Over the years she became a driving force in the Accounting and Business Law Department, spearheading innovative research and curriculum development. Marsha’s exceptional ability to communicate complex legal and ethical concepts made her a beloved professor and mentor to countless students. She was a master of the Socratic Method and a critical thinker. She received the Distinguished Advising Award from the College of Charleston in 2000 and served as Director of Women’s Studies. Known as an excellent academic advisor, she was sought out by a multitude of students-especially the College’s athletes who studied in the School of Business. She followed the College of Charleston’s men’s and women’s basketball teams with great interest. Marsha’s contributions to the field of business law extended far beyond the classroom. She was an accomplished scholar, publishing numerous influential articles that explored employment law. She was active in the Academy of Legal Studies in Business, serving as President of the Southeast Academy in 1986 and Academy President in 1994-95. Marsha’s strongest non-professional passion was fishing, which began at a very early age. She accompanied her father on numerous fishing expeditions and lived most of her life in her cherished childhood home beside the water. Marsha was especially proud of being appointed by the Governor to the Natural Resources Board which sets policy for the Department. She was familiar with the creeks, rivers, and offshore waters around Charleston and was patient with less experienced anglers, untangling lines and providing fishing techniques. She was a licensed boat captain and was at one point the only female charter boat captain on the East coast. As a stalwart Captain, she loved to take her boat (the Marshgrass) and friends or clients both inshore and offshore fishing. To Marsha, the happiest end to a day of fishing was the sight of her beloved dogs, Pumpkin and Patches, running to meet her boat. An invitation from Marsha to go fishing was a true delight with a beautiful day on the water and fresh fish for dinner. She was greatly assisted during her last two decades by Captain Derek Eager, whom she esteemed as a son. Beyond her professional accomplishments, Marsha will be remembered for her compassion and an unwavering commitment to her students and friends. She possessed a rare ability to inspire and encourage both students and friends to reach their full potential. Many former students fondly recall her engaging teaching style, her dedication to their success, and her willingness to go the extra mile to provide guidance. Her friends fondly recall her complete dedication to whatever she undertook….Facebook posting, learning, teaching, research, and fishing. She was fearless in advocating for positions held by the underdog if she believed in the cause. She was a great supporter of women’s rights and kept her friends informed of the issues and urged all to be active. Marsha enjoyed an astonishing number of loyal and diverse friends all her life.\n\nMelissa McCall ’69 | Melissa McCall of Columbus, North Carolina passed away peacefully at home on Sunday, July 16.

Joy and I were roommates at Ashley Hall. We had kept in touch over the years. We were both living in southern Calif in the 1970s and saw each other quite frequently. In 1979 my father and I moved back to Florida.That is where he was from, and I had been accepted to University of Florida graduate school. Joy moved to Florida while I was in Gainesville so we were back in touch and saw each again. In fact she and her oldest son came to our wedding in 1991. My husband was Barry Grey, Citadel Class of 1959. He passed away in 2014. I retired from UF Health-Jacksonville in 2004. I was part of the ENT department as an audiologist. I will not be able to come back for our 60th. I remember well our being at the Dock Street Theater because of the rain. I love the picture of everyone who attended the 50th. I hope I can get a picture from you of our 60th. I’m really disappointed that I can’t be there. Health wise I’m in pretty good shape. I’ve survived cancer and a broken hip. So I have much to be thankful about.\n\nNancy Head Thode ’59\n\nAlthough I live in Connecticut, I have a house on Fripp Island which brings me to my home town of Beaufort multiple times a year.

I’ve written and produced 3 one-woman shows, including “A Southern Belle Lives to Tell” and “Camelot Came Calling: The Fabulous 60s.” Favorite community theater roles were Daisy in “Driving Miss Daisy” and Ethel in “On Golden Pond.” I’m currently on break from acting while writing a book about my author mother, Ann Head, at the urging of the College of Charleston archivist. I’ll give a talk about her in March at the Beaufort Library, cosponsored by the Pat Conroy Literary Center. That along with some community and church volunteer work keep me busy and out of trouble. Mostly…! Irv Thode, my husband of 30 years, died 8 years ago after a long illness. I have two children and two step-children and 8 grandchildren, ages 35 to 8 years, who keep me hopping! I’ve kept in touch with Bonny Jones Gilbert, and I’m looking forward to the reunion and the opportunity to renew other friendships.\n\nKay Haselden Chandler ’61\n\nKay Haselden Chandler agrees with Sally McCrady Hubbard that we should consider having a mini class reunion at the Pig and Oyster Roasts at school in January.

On the other hand I’m pretty stoked and honored to have had this opportunity to work with Pinellas Community Foundation. Reading through Perspectives about all the wonderful accomplishments of Ashley Hall students, the exceptional programming and staff, I wanted to share that this opportunity of mine can be traced back to the confidence gained and quality of education and mission experienced havet had in my life. It takes a core desire to succeed in the individual and an environment to nurture and support that. Ashley Hall provided both to me during a time of important emotional development during family stress in my life. The effects of my time as a boarding student at Ashley Hall continue to inform my life today and, I’m quite sure, will continue to do so.\n\nEmily D.

Clayton Buckaloo, an international business, global supply chain and operations management, finance, and marketing student, agrees that the real-life aspect of the case competition was one of the biggest takeaways. “It took all the different skills I’ve been learning in my classes and showed me how they fit together,” she said. “I think that without something like this, it’s really hard for students to picture how they’ll use what they’re learning.” One of the aspects of the competition Buckaloo enjoyed most was the preparation for the event, but nothing could have prepared them for what hit on the plane ride home. “Our plane was struck by lightning,” she said. “But by the time we had run through all the worst-case scenarios in our heads, we were still in the air, so we knew everything was fine.” But lightning hasn’t deterred them: Buckaloo and Schindler both plan to participate in other case competitions this spring.\n\n’14 Yachen Luo had an amazing internship at the World Health Organization in Switzerland last year! She helped host a huge charity event with 10 female Ambassadors to the UN to support girls’ education and career opportunities. The Director-General of WHO, mayor of Geneva, and 40 other ambassadors to the UN attended the event, and it turned out to be a big success. Last week, she attended the UN in New York for the UN Women’s Commission on the Status of Women conference, where she got a chance to write the Minister of South Africa’s closing speech, as well as observe all the global efforts in pushing girls’ education and empowerment. Currently, Yachen is taking a gap year to Tanzania to do volunteer service on HPV/Cervical Cancer screening program with UNAIDS, and she is really looking forward to this opportunity. She gives all the credit to the faculty/staff members at Ashley Hall for teaching and inspiring her and her classmates to continue doing and supporting girls to get higher education and achieve greater things! She says her time at Ashley Hall is definitely a treasure that will benefit her along the way! In January, she reunited with her Ashley Hall classmates, Alyssa, Amy, Yuna and Sophia in New York City. They had a wonderful time getting together and reminisced on their years at Ashley Hall."
