The novel is designed to give readers the essential knowledge of the early age of Azeroth and how events lead to the world’s present state. Of the Warcraft novels, Knaak has said in interviews that he thoroughly enjoys immersing himself in world’s others have created and can transition his writing for such worlds with ease. He says it does not feel like limitations are being placed on his imagination. If he has an idea that does not fit with the world he’s writing for, he simply saves it for one of his own novels. The Warcraft novels were initially intended for online publication only, but due to reader demand, Knaak’s Warcraft tales were collected into a standard book and published by Blizzard."
