        "text": "Fair Warning: I’m about to get a mite sappy.\n\nLast week, I turned in the final edits on The Adversary, the third book of the Sundering (and the third book of the Brimstone Angels/Farideh series).\n\nThere’s something about turning in a book that feels like giving birth, only somehow backwards. You’re completely consumed by this project, this idea, these words, these characters. The closer you get to the deadline, the more full of this creation you are–it creeps into your thoughts while you make dinner, while you talk to your neighbors, while you watch movies or mow the lawn or play on the floor with your child. How do I make this plot element fit? How do I redeem that character? What am I going to do with this half-scene that’s not going to fit?\n\nAnd then one day it’s done. And as much as your brain wants to think about it, there’s not really a point. You’re finished. There are no more scenes in there you need to perfect, no more characters to put through their paces–you’re done.\n\nCan I tell you a secret? I love this book. I’m sort of afraid of how much I love this book, because that seems like jinxing it, especially when I know this is a huge chance for me. And there were plenty of times I hated it, and hated what it was doing to me and hated how hard it was to write and how hard it was to revise. I couldn’t do anything because The Adversary needed everything.\n\nBut then it was done. I was out the other side. And I realized the book was beautiful. I’m so proud of it. I wanted more than anything to find a way to write a book that would embody the Realms, that would fulfill the promises set forth by Brimstone Angels, that would appeal to people who hadn’t read the other books, that would appeal to people who’d reread them all three times, and that would be a book I wrote, with my style and my words and my characters. Which at times, to be honest, felt like absolute lunacy.\n\nGuys, I don’t want to jinx anything, but I think I did it. I really hope you like it.\n\nIt’s just a little more than two weeks before Gen Con–did you know that? I didn’t, until I went to their website today and then started panicking and I had to go lay down for a bit. Then I decided I needed to post my schedule, because surely someone wants to see me at Gen Con. Otherwise…well, I’d like to say I’m surprised all those books are just being bought by my parents, but I’d only be surprised they found room for them all in that garage.\n\nSo if you want to see me at Gen Con Indy 2013, here’s where I’ll be!\n\nPre-Gen Con: Thurber House, Columbus, OH: Wednesday, August 14, 2013\n\nBefore heading to Gen Con, I will be in Columbus, OH to talk about the Sundering, the Forgotten Realms, and more with R.A. Salvatore and Ed Greenwood (with James Wyatt as moderator), followed by a signing. If you are in the area (and since Indianapolis is only a few hours away, you might be!), you should come check it out.\n\nThursday, August 15, 2013\n\nWriter’s Craft: Memorable Characters (SEM1345055), 9 am-10 am\n\n“Learn how to create compelling characters that readers will never forget.” With Howard Jones, Scott Lynch, and (I’m 90% certain) Mary Robinette Kowal. You should definitely come to this one–just look at that line up!\n\nWriter’s Craft: Heroes & Villains (SEM1345057), 11 am-12 pm\n\n“Tricks for creating a potent hero-villain relationship that will keep the reader glued to the page.” With Gregory Wilson, James Dashner, David Farland, and Richard Lee Byers. That’s right! You get double FR/Sundering authors for this one (Also some NYT bestsellers, giants of the genre, etc., etc.)\n\n…Why am I getting nervous?\n\nThen I have to eat lunch. If you see me here, wandering around dazed and glassy-eyed with low blood sugar, point me to something tasty and fast. I will give you a book. Or let you tell me what you think should happen to Farideh et al next. Or what should happen to Drizzt–if you get me to a not-crappy sandwich, you can talk about whoever’s books you like.\n\nAuthor Signing, 1:00-2:00 pm\n\nFor this signing, I will be in Hall D with all the other Sundering authors. Except Paul Kemp who says he has more important things do like welcome a child into the world. If you are only finding this blog after you stood still too long, waiting for a book from one of those guys, and I made you take Brimstone Angels, YOU’RE WELCOME! 🙂\n\nSpin-a-Yarn with Ed Greenwood (SEM1346613), 2pm-4pm\n\n“Join the creator of the Forgotten Realms setting for a rollicking group storytelling experience that will leave you dizzy with laughter.” Have you been to this? It’s NUTS. Completely bonkers. James Wyatt and I will be the recorders of the story. If someone takes bets on who blushes more, don’t bet on me. There is one surefire way to make me blush, and that’s not happening at Spin-a-Yarn. (Unfortunately, it looks like this one’s sold out–but sometimes they’ll let folks slip in if there’s room)\n\nWriter’s Craft: Mystery vs. Confusion (SEM1345062), 4 pm-5 pm\n\n“Learn to infuse the unknown into your stories without leaving your readers lost in the weeds.” With Donald J. Bingle, Kerrie Hughes, and John Helfers. I begged to be put on this panel. Love, love, love the topic and can’t wait to discuss with these awesome panelists!\n\nA Night With Dungeons & Dragons, (ENT1346625), 7 pm-10 pm ($20)\n\n“Spend the evening in Baldur’s Gate at the official Sundering launch party! Mingle with D&D designers, authors, and other industry luminaries while enjoying food, drinks, music, adventure and more.” So I can tell you for sure that “authors” at the very least means me. And the other Sundering authors (except Paul because impending baby) assuming they aren’t planning to ditch and go smoke behind the gym or something…Probably not, because there will be canapes and drinks! (And fans. :)). Come and you can also see if I ever found a cocktail dress that felt Baldur’s Gate appropriate.\n\nFriday, August 16, 2013\n\nAfter all the hubbub of Thursday, my Friday is decidedly chill! Maybe I will see you at the ENnies!\n\nAuthor Signing, 11:00 am-12:00 pm, Hall D\n\nThis time I am only signing books with R.A. Salvatore and Troy Denning. “Only.”\n\nSaturday, August 17, 2013\n\nAuthor Signing, 2:00 pm-3:00 pm, Hall D\n\nThis time they switch it up, and I’m signing with Ed Greenwood and Richard Lee Byers.\n\nFate of the Forgotten Realms(SEM1346630), 4:00-6:00 pm\n\n“Novelists R.A. Salvatore, Ed Greenwood, Troy Denning, Erin M. Evans,[the spirit of] Paul Kemp, and Richard Lee Byers discuss The Sundering, and the stories still to be told.” This sold out super-fast. I hope you got tickets, but I also suspect they’re going to film it. Lucky you, person who has no ticket! This panel is going to be awesome, except I have a really hard time deciding what’s a spoiler and what’s a teaser, because I don’t care about spoilers, but I know if I accidentally say that Lorcan is really the avatar of Asmodeus then someone’s going to be upset that I…Wait.\n\nShit.\n\nCandlekeep Presents: The Harpers at Twilight (SEM1344169), 6 pm-10 pm\n\n“The Harpers of Twilight Hall have called for a gathering of sages, loremasters, and adventurers of all stripes to Candlekeep! Featuring luminaries Ed Greenwood, James Lowder, and many secret guests!” Wait: That says “secret.” Was I not supposed to say I would be there?\n\nShit.\n\nAnyway, I’ve been told it would be nice for me to get up there and talk about Harpers, since I write about them these days.\n\nSunday, August 18, 2013\n\nWrite & Critique Workshop (WKS1345356), 8:00 am-10:oo am\n\n“In this limited seating event, attendees are given a short period of time to write on a topic provided by the panelists. At the end of this period, each attendee reads what they wrote and the panelists provide feedback. It’s a fantastic opportunity to get direct feedback on your work and to learn by hearing the comments offered to others.” With John Helfers and Maxwell Alexander Drake. If you’re signed up for this, I already think you’re incredibly brave. Writing fast on cue is my least favorite way to work. So while I promise I’ll be my usual exacting self, I promise it will be tempered by awe for your guts. Also, by fatigue because 8 am."
