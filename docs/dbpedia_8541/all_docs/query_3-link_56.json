But when he rescues a blinded stranger from a swarm of bloodthirsty fairies, Billy's life gets a lot more complicated. . . .\n\nSeems the stranger is actually a powerful local god who is involved in a high-stakes Florida poker tournament against various supernatural challengers. And with his eyes currently missing, he needs somebody to take his place at the gaming table. Before Billy knows it, he finds himself playing against the likes of an ancient Egyptian mummy, an unbearably seductive succubus, a mechanical man, an insect queen, and a cannibalistic beast-man. And not just cards are in play; magic, bloodshed, and cheating are not only expected, they're encouraged.\n\nEverybody, including a sexy satyr-girl with her own cards up her sleeve, thinks that Billy is in way over his head. But Billy is a born gambler and, when the chips are down, he might just change his luck for good!\n\nBlind God's Bluff is an outrageously addictive urban fantasy that will keep you flipping pages until the very last hand.\n\nGenre: Urban Fantasy\n\nVisitors also looked at these books\n\nUsed availability for Richard Lee Byers's Blind God's Bluff\n\nSearch for\n\nAbout Fantastic Fiction Information for Authors"
