Abstract

The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a very hierarchical and centralized structure. The majority of recruits come from the Moscow State University of International Relations. Diplomats generally focus on one region of the world, moving from post to post while slowly rising through the ranks. While the ministry is a prestigious institution in Russia, recent challenges have decreased its attraction for the best potential recruits. Many students in the pool of prospective diplomats cite a perceived lack of professional freedom within the ministry. As fewer of the traditionally trained Soviet era diplomats remain, the ministry will face the challenge of integrating the younger post-Soviet generation into the fabric of Russian diplomacy.
