        "text": "HOUSTON, Aug. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- - Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) reported second quarter 2024 net income of $349 million or $0.62 per diluted share, which includes the impact of certain items not typically represented in analysts' earnings estimates and that would otherwise affect comparability of results. Adjusted net income was $357 million or $0.63 per diluted share. Net operating cash flow was $1,088 million or $1,028 million before changes in working capital (adjusted CFO).\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nSecond quarter free cash flow (FCF) of $442 million and adjusted FCF of $364 million before changes in working capital and including Equatorial Guinea (E.G.) distributions and other financing\n\nTotal return of capital to shareholders of $294 million during second quarter\n\nSequential increase in second quarter production to 191,000 net bopd and 393,000 net boed\n\nNo change to full-year 2024 production and capital expenditure guidance ranges\n\n2Q24 Financial Overview\n\nCASH FLOW: Net cash provided by operations was $1,088 million during second quarter or $1,028 million before changes in working capital. Second quarter capital expenditures totaled $665 million, consistent with Marathon Oil's guidance that 2024 capital expenditures would be just over 60% weighted to the first half of the year and reflecting an acceleration in wells to sales from continued drilling and completion efficiencies.\n\nRETURN OF CAPITAL: Second quarter return of capital totaled $294 million, including $231 million of share repurchases and the $63 million base dividend. Marathon Oil discontinued its share repurchase program upon announcement of its pending merger with ConocoPhillips. Under the Merger Agreement, Marathon Oil may not increase the quarterly dividend in excess of the current $0.11 per share.\n\nBALANCE SHEET: Marathon Oil second quarter cash and cash equivalents totaled $77 million, an approximate $30 million increase from the prior quarter. Also during second quarter, the Company reduced gross debt by approximately $130 million to a quarter-end gross debt total of $5.3 billion.\n\nADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME: The adjustments to net income for second quarter totaled $8 million.\n\n2Q24 Operational Overview\n\nUNITED STATES (U.S.): U.S. production averaged 351,000 net boed during second quarter 2024, while oil production averaged 183,000 net bopd. Second quarter U.S. unit production cost averaged $6.21 per boe.\n\nExcluding joint venture wells, the Company brought a total of 99 gross Company-operated wells to sales during second quarter, above the guidance range of 85 to 90 wells due to continued drilling and completion efficiency gains.\n\nINTERNATIONAL: E.G. production averaged 42,000 net boed during second quarter, including 8,000 net bopd.\n\nThe Company continued optimizing its operations by diverting a portion of its Alba gas from AMPCO methanol sales to higher margin LNG sales. Marathon Oil's Alba LNG sales achieved a realized price of $8.52 per mcf during the quarter, as the Company continued realizing the uplift in value from the shift to global LNG pricing.\n\nTotal International segment income was $79 million during second quarter, including $26 million of income from equity method investees. The Company received total cash distributions of $77 million from equity method companies during second quarter, including dividends of $75 million and return of capital of $2 million.\n\n2024 Guidance Overview\n\nMarathon Oil's previously provided annual guidance ranges for total Company oil production, total Company oil-equivalent production, and capital expenditures remain unchanged, as shown in the table below.\n\nTotal Company oil and oil-equivalent production are expected to peak during third quarter, with oil production rising to approximately 200,000 net bopd, before moderating into fourth quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to decline sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters, while FCF on a price-normalized basis is expected to increase sequentially in both quarters.\n\nEarnings Call\n\nDue to the pending merger with ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil will not host a conference call or webcast to discuss its second quarter 2024 results.\n\nAbout Marathon Oil\n\nMarathon Oil (NYSE: MRO) is an independent oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) company focused on four of the most competitive resource plays in the U.S. - Eagle Ford, Texas; Bakken, North Dakota; Permian in New Mexico and Texas, and STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma, complemented by a world-class integrated gas business in Equatorial Guinea. The Company's Framework for Success is founded in a strong balance sheet, ESG excellence, and the competitive advantages of a high-quality multi-basin portfolio. On May 28 Marathon Oil entered a merger agreement with ConocoPhillips. The transaction is expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, changes in our valuation allowance, unrealized derivative gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments and other items that could be considered \"non-operating\" or \"non-core\" in nature. Management believes this is useful to investors as another tool to meaningfully represent our operating performance and to compare Marathon to certain competitors. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or net income (loss) per share as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nOur presentation of adjusted CFO is defined as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for changes in working capital and is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes this is useful to investors as an indicator of Marathon's ability to generate cash quarterly or year-to-date by eliminating differences caused by the timing of certain working capital items. Adjusted CFO should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nOur presentation of free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, net of capital expenditures and change in capital accrual. Management believes this is useful to investors as a measure of Marathon's ability to fund its capital expenditure programs, service debt, and fund other distributions to stockholders. Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nOur presentation of adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted free cash flow before dividend (\"adjusted free cash flow\") is defined as adjusted CFO, net of capital expenditures and EG return of capital and other. Management believes this is useful to investors as a measure of Marathon's ability to fund its capital expenditure programs, service debt, and fund other distributions to stockholders. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nOur presentation of reinvestment rate is a non-GAAP measure. The reinvestment rate in the context of adjusted free cash flow is defined as capital expenditures divided by adjusted CFO. The reinvestment rate in the context of free cash flow is defined as capital expenditures divided by net cash provided by operating activities. Management believes the reinvestment rate is useful to investors to demonstrate the Company's commitment to generating cash for use towards investor-friendly purposes (which includes balance sheet enhancement, base dividend and other return of capital).\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the business that, when viewed with GAAP results may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the business and are a useful tool to help management and investors make informed decisions about Marathon Oil's financial and operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our investor package on our website at https://ir.marathonoil.com/ and in the tables below. Marathon Oil strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
