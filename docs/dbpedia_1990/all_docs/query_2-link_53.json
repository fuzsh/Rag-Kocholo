The faculty is one of the largest in the country, with a total intake of more than 250 students a year (including joint courses).\n\nUndergraduate students have access to the Taylor Institution Library, the biggest research library in Britain devoted to modern languages, and the University’s central library the Bodleian, as well as many online resources. The University’s well-equipped Language Centre has resources specifically tailored to the needs of Modern Language students.\n\nLanguage is at the centre of the Oxford course, making up around 50% of both first-year and final examinations. The course aims to teach spoken fluency in colloquial and more formal situations, as well as the ability to write essays in the foreign language, and the ability to translate into and out of the foreign language with accuracy and sensitivity to a range of vocabulary, styles and registers. You will also develop your reading skills to a high level.\n\nThe study of literature gives you an understanding of other cultures that cannot be acquired solely through learning the language. It leads you into areas such as:\n\ngender studies\n\npopular culture\n\ntheatre\n\naesthetics\n\nanthropology\n\nart history\n\nethics\n\nhistory\n\nphilosophy\n\npolitics\n\npsychology and theology\n\nThese areas of study develop your skills as a critical reader, writer and thinker.\n\nInternational opportunities\n\nModern Languages students spend a compulsory year abroad, usually in the third year. Opportunities for the year abroad include (but aren't restricted to):\n\nworking as a paid language assistant in a school;\n\nundertaking an internship;\n\nand/or studying at a University.\n\nThese opportunities all provide valuable experiences for improving language competence.\n\nThe University is working with European partners to maintain the opportunities available to its students post-Brexit. University exchanges, language assistantships and work placements will continue to be available as opportunities for your year abroad. Read the latest information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to a course’s requirements for international study. Students who consider that they may be affected are asked to contact their department for advice.\n\nFunding during the year abroad\n\nSome year abroad activities provide a salary, and other year-abroad funding is available from a variety of sources. Actual costs (such as course fees) and living costs will vary depending on the destination and the activity undertaken.\n\nSome of the costs relating to year abroad activity may be subject to variation as arrangements relating to the UK’s departure from the EU are progressed. Visit the dedicated Oxford and the EU page for the latest information. You will need to pay for living costs during the year abroad, including accommodation and travel expenses, and there may be costs relating to visa or Covid-testing requirements for travel.\n\nUK students from lower-income households with means-tested assessments will remain eligible for Oxford’s generous bursary provision. Travel grants may be available through your college and/or the Faculty.\n\nFor students who experience particular difficulties related to their year abroad, some hardship funds are also available from the Faculty. For UK students with a shortfall in their finances, the University’s Student Support Fund may provide additional assistance.\n\nCollege choice\n\nPlease view our guidance on choosing a college, and which language combinations are available at each college.\n\nUnistats information\n\nDiscover Uni course data provides applicants with Unistats statistics about undergraduate life at Oxford for a particular undergraduate course.\n\nPlease select 'see course data' to view the full Unistats data for each of our language courses.\n\nPlease note that there may be no data available if the number of course participants is very small.\n\nVisit the Studying at Oxford section of this page for a more general insight into what studying here is likely to be like.\n\nA typical week\n\nYour week’s work will include a tutorial in, or organised by, your college, language classes in the language(s) you study, and typically three to four hours of lectures for each subject.\n\nTutorials are usually up to four students and a tutor. Seminar and language class sizes may vary depending on the options you choose or the language you are studying, but there would usually be no more than around 20 students and classes would often be much smaller.\n\nMost tutorials, classes, and lectures are delivered by staff who are tutors in their subject. Many are world-leading experts with years of experience in teaching and research. Some teaching may also be delivered by postgraduate students who are usually studying at doctoral level.\n\nTo find out more about how our teaching year is structured, visit our Academic Year page.\n\nCourse structure\n\nYour first year is closely structured. You will attend oral classes and courses on the grammatical structure of your language(s), translation into and out of the language(s) and, in some of the languages, comprehension. You will also attend typically three to four hours of introductory lectures and participate in seminars and/or tutorials on literature.\n\nIf you study French, German, Spanish or Russian as a single language you will take a range of further options in that language in the first year. All other languages must be studied in combination with another language or another subject.\n\nYour other years of study give you more freedom to choose the areas on which you wish to focus, from a very wide range of options.\n\nStudents may take Polish as a subsidiary language, beginning in the second year. Catalan, Galician, Yiddish and most of the Slavonic languages may also be taken as additional options.\n\nDeferred entry\n\nStudents are welcome to apply for deferred entry for any language courses except those including beginners’ Russian.\n\nYear 1\n\nCourses\n\nAssessment\n\nTwo-language course\n\nPractical language work\n\nStudy of important works and/or topics in the literature of each language\n\nOne-language course, as above, plus:\n\nFor French, German, Russian and Spanish, additional options: film studies; literary theory (French); medieval studies (German/Spanish); key texts in French or German thought; short fiction (Spanish); Polish and Church Slavonic (Russian)\n\n(Other languages must be studied in combination with another language or joint school.)\n\nFirst University examinations: seven or eight written papers, including translation and literature (language only for beginners’ Russian)\n\nYear 2\n\nCourses\n\nTwo-language course\n\nPractical language work\n\nA period of literature in each language\n\nOptional subjects, including linguistics; medieval literature; detailed study of individual authors\n\nOne-language course\n\nAs above, but including a greater range of optional subjects\n\nYear 3 and 4\n\nStructure\n\nAssessment\n\nYear 3\n\nTypically spent abroad (beginners’ Russian: students spend the second year on a Russian Language Undergraduate Studies course. This currently takes place in Tallinn, Estonia. The third year is spent in Oxford).\n\nYear 4\n\nContinues the course from Year 2, plus special subjects across a wide range of options including film studies.\n\nFinal University examinations: nine or ten written papers and an oral examination are taken, including unprepared translations, literature subjects, special subjects and linguistics. Some special subjects are examined by submitting a portfolio of essays.\n\nThe options listed above are illustrative and may change. More information about current options is available on the Modern Languages website.\n\nThe content and format of this course may change in some circumstances. Read further information about potential course changes.\n\nAcademic requirements\n\nQualification\n\nRequirement\n\nA-levels:\n\nAAA\n\nAdvanced Highers:\n\nAA/AAB\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB):\n\n38 (including core points) with 666 at HL\n\nAny other equivalent qualification:\n\nView information on other UK qualifications, and international qualifications.\n\nWherever possible, your grades are considered in the context in which they have been achieved.\n\nRead further information on how we use contextual data.\n\nSubject requirements\n\nThere are several combinations available that allow students to begin studying a language from scratch. However, please note that it is not usually possible for students to study two languages from scratch or a language on its own from scratch.\n\nCandidates would be expected to have competence in at least one of the languages chosen.\n\nLanguage\n\nRequirement\n\nFor French or Spanish\n\nCandidates would usually be expected to have the language to A-level, Advanced Higher, Higher Level in the IB or another academic equivalent.\n\nCandidates who are not taking the language in one of these qualifications may still be considered, if they have attained proficiency in the language at level B1 in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). CEFR is an international standard to describe language ability on a six-point scale (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) from A1 for beginners to C2 for a high level of proficiency. Many language qualifications refer to one of these CEFR grades to indicate their level. Please check with your school, testing centre or exam board if you are unsure of the level.\n\nAll candidates must fulfil the standard requirement of AAA at A-level.\n\nFor Czech, German, Modern Greek, Italian, Portuguese and Russian\n\nPlease note there are different course codes for these languages, depending on whether or not you have studied them before (see below). Beginners’ courses allow students to start studying one of these languages from scratch – otherwise they would be expected to have an A-level or equivalent (or, for German, an A-level or equivalent proven competence). The beginners’ German course also includes an intermediate option for those who have studied some German. Find out more at the Modern Languages website.\n\nCandidates who wish to study the language at the higher level but are not taking the language in one of these qualifications may still be considered, if they have attained proficiency in the language at level B1 in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). CEFR is an international standard to describe language ability on a six-point scale (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) from A1 for beginners to C2 for a high level of proficiency. Many language qualifications refer to one of these CEFR grades to indicate their level. Please check with your school, testing centre or exam board if you are unsure of the level.\n\nAll candidates must fulfil the standard requirement of AAA at A-level.\n\nFor Polish\n\nWe generally expect all students applying for this course to be beginners, though those with experience are also very welcome to apply.\n\nIf a practical component forms part of any of your science A‐levels used to meet your offer, we expect you to pass it.\n\nIf English is not your first language you may also need to meet our English language requirements.\n\nApplying\n\nAll candidates must follow the application procedure as shown on our Applying to Oxford page.\n\nThe following information gives specific details for students applying for this course.\n\nUCAS codes\n\nSingle language courses\n\nJoint language courses\n\nBeginners' courses (B.)\n\nThese courses allow students to study a new language from scratch, along with another language which they have already studied to A-level, or equivalent.\n\nAdmissions test\n\nTest:\n\nMLAT\n\nTest date:\n\n22 October 2024\n\nRegistration window:\n\n15 August to 4 October 2024\n\nAll candidates must take the Modern Languages Admissions Test (MLAT) as part of their application.\n\nVisit the MLAT page for guidance on how to prepare.\n\nWe are putting in place new arrangements for our admissions tests for 2024 onwards. We will provide more information on these arrangements at the earliest opportunity.\n\nWritten work\n\nDescription:\n\nCandidates are normally required to submit one piece of work in the target language to be studied, and one piece in English, please the rest of this section for further details.\n\nSubmission deadline:\n\n10 November 2024\n\nWritten work in the target language\n\nAll candidates must submit one piece of marked classwork by the submission deadline; normally a few hundred words in length, written in each language which you plan to study. This should be in a language in which you will have A-level (or an equivalent standard) before university.\n\nThis will demonstrate to interviewers how you are developing in your use of the target language(s) in work you have completed in the normal course of your A-level (or equivalent) study.\n\nIf you are applying for a language in which you will not have reached this standard before university, you do not need to submit anything in that language.\n\nWritten work in English\n\nAll candidates must also submit one piece only of marked writing in English.\n\nThe particular topic of your essay and the A-level (or equivalent) subject from which it is drawn are not important; it is intended to show how you construct an argument and express your ideas in English.\n\nIf you do not have any recent marked work written in English (for example, because of the combination of subjects you are currently studying), you may submit a specially written piece of work, such as an essay in English on one of the topics you have been studying for your language A-level (or equivalent). It may be helpful to seek guidance from your teachers in devising a suitable title. In such circumstances, it would not normally be expected for this piece to have been marked, as it will not have been done in the normal course of your studies.\n\nAs detailed in the selection criteria for Modern Languages, all submitted written work is considered in the context of the individual circumstances in which it was completed.\n\nExamples of written work required for different subject combinations\n\nIf you are applying to study French and German, you will need to submit three pieces of written work: one in French, one in German and one in English.\n\nIf you are applying to study Spanish and beginners' Russian you will need to submit two pieces of work: one in Spanish and one in English.\n\nRead our further guidance on the submission of written work for more information, and to download a cover sheet.\n\nWhat are tutors looking for?\n\nTutors will be looking for a good command of the grammar of any language you have already studied at school and want to continue studying at Oxford, as well as an interest in literature and culture.\n\nAt interview, tutors will want to find out as much as possible about your intellectual interests and academic potential, so you may be asked about your reading, your interest in the culture of the relevant country, or the work you have submitted.\n\nYou may be asked questions about a short text in English or the relevant foreign language(s). You will be given the opportunity to speak in the relevant foreign language(s) which you have studied to an advanced level. As far as possible, interviewers will try to let you show your strengths, interest in the subject(s) you intend to study, and reasons for applying to Oxford.\n\nVisit the Modern Languages website for more detail on the selection criteria for this course."
