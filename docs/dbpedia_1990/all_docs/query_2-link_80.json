        "text": "Military operations have been reported near the towns of Lyubimovka, Obukhovka, and Sudzha, as well as the villages of of Gogolevka, Lebedevka, Nikolaevo-Darino, and Oleshnya in Russia's Kursk Oblast, which borders Ukraine's Sumy Region, as of late Aug. 7. Russian and Ukrainian sources have issued conflicting reports; however, it is likely that a group of up to 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers supported by roughly several dozen tanks and armored vehicles crossed the border early on Aug. 6 and are currently engaged in combat with Russian forces. Estimates of the territorial extent of the Ukrainian military presence in Russian border areas remain unclear; however, some unconfirmed reports placed this territory at constituting 90 sq. km (35 sq. miles). At least five civilians have reportedly died, and 31 have been injured as of late Aug. 7. Additionally, water, electricity, and telecommunications outages are reported near the combat areas.\n\nAuthorities in Kursk Oblast announced the implementation of a state of emergency on Aug. 7. Russian authorities have issued missile alert warnings in the Sudzhansky and Korenevsky districts, which both border Ukraine's Sumy Region. Russian missile strikes and airstrikes targeted the Sumy Region, including Sumy City, on Aug. 6 and 7, causing infrastructure damage but no confirmed civilian casualties. Military losses on both sides remain unclear.\n\nArtillery fire, aerial attacks, and ground combat operations will likely continue in the coming days. Strikes may cause building damage and civilian casualties. Russian authorities will likely launch counterattacks in the area in the coming hours or days. Counteroffensive operations could prompt increased security and the evacuation of civilians from surrounding areas. Either party may expand military operations in response to conditions on the ground."
