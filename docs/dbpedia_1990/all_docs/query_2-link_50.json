        "text": "Weblogs\n\nThe Netherlands has approximately 150 diplomatic missions around the world, ranging from large to small. Today we take a look behind the scenes at an unusual one: the embassy in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Our diplomats talk about working in a country at war and what they're doing to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia.\n\nTjitske Wildervanck, political section\n\nWar is also raging beyond the battlefield, says Tjitske Wildervanck. ‘The war isn’t confined to the front lines – Russia is also waging a cultural war. It's deliberately attacking cultural targets in an attempt to erase Ukraine’s culture and identity. I look at how the Netherlands can support Ukraine in terms of culture, and I facilitate cooperation between the Dutch and Ukrainian cultural sectors. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science have deliberately made Ukraine a priority country with regard to international cultural policy.’\n\nMark Heemskerk, economic section\n\nEconomic stability is the basis for Ukraine’s ongoing war efforts, says Mark Heemskerk, from the embassy's economic section. ‘As much as it can, the Netherlands is helping to keep Ukraine’s economy ticking over. Because if its economy collapses, Ukraine won’t be able to fight a war. Our work at the embassy involves mobilising the business community, thinking along with them about the initial phase of reconstruction work that will contribute to economic development. The cost of war damage in Ukraine is already estimated at more than $400 billion, and the government can’t come up with that on its own. It absolutely needs help from the business sector.’\n\nNatalya Bongers, economic section\n\n‘If you want to find Dutch businesses that are a good match for Ukraine, you need specialist knowledge,’ adds Natalya Bongers. Born in Ukraine, she’s a local employee in the embassy’s economic section.\n\nRoy Spijkerboer, political section\n\nThe Netherlands supports Ukraine in various ways, says Roy Spijkerboer, who works in the political section. ‘For instance, my work has to do with Ukraine’s EU accession process and the reforms that will require,’ says Roy. He explains: ‘Future EU membership is a major ambition for Ukraine. The authorities here often say that Ukraine should become part of the EU when it has won the war. But there’s a huge amount of work that needs to be done before that can happen. We're monitoring the process very carefully here at the embassy. Through support for various projects, including in civil society, we're doing our best to facilitate reform programmes. Without question, we think of this partly as an investment in relations with Ukraine as a potential EU member state in the future.’\n\nPatrick Urselmann, defence attaché\n\nUkraine urgently needs Western military support to keep up its fight, says Patrick Urselmann, a defence attaché working at the embassy as part of a team from the Dutch Ministry of Defence. He explains their role: ‘First and foremost, we’re here to coordinate military support for Ukraine and to maintain our network of international coalition partners.’\n\nFacts and figures about the embassy\n\nAbout 40 people – staff posted from the Netherlands and local employees – currently work at the embassy, compared to 19 before the war began.\n\nJennes de Mol has been the Netherlands’ ambassador to Ukraine since 2019; his posting will end in the summer of 2024, when he becomes ambassador to Poland.\n\nTwo months before the war broke out, the embassy had opened a small assistance point in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv where it could provide support to Dutch nationals.\n\nThe embassy in Kyiv closed on 19 February 2022 and all of its diplomats moved to the Lviv office. A few days later they had to leave Ukraine entirely.\n\nThe embassy was able to open its doors once again on 29 April 2022.\n\nMarco Wijnands, operational manager\n\nSomeone else who understands this is Marco Wijnands, who recently joined the mission as its operational manager. He explains: ‘As operational manager, it's up to me to keep the embassy running smoothly. My team and I are responsible for financial administration and human resources, as well as things like building maintenance at the embassy and incoming visits. It’s a challenging job in exceptional circumstances. The work goes on even against the backdrop of war, and that’s not something you experience everywhere.\n\nNatalya Vasilchenko, general affairs section\n\nWork at the embassy has changed so much, including for local employees at the embassy, who are Ukrainian. Natalya explains: ‘The sirens go off all the time. Every time there’s a Russian attack, all of us staff talk about it the next day. It’s important for us to be able to do that.’\n\nWorking at the embassy also gives her a sense of stability in these tumultuous times, she says. ‘I'll never forget the day we were allowed to return to the embassy a couple of months after the invasion. It felt a little bit like normal life again.’\n\nLeave a comment\n\nInappropriate comments will be removed. Comments are limited to 2000 characters."
