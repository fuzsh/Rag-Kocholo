        "text": "As the United States and China compete for global influence, both countries have spent large sums on public diplomacy. Public diplomacy—defined as an attempt by a government to “communicate with and attract the public” of a foreign country (Nye, Reference Nye2008, p. 95)—attempts to shape global public opinion through leader visits, educational programs, diplomatic exchanges, traditional media, and social media. Each year, the United States spends over $2 billion on public diplomacy, while China spends an estimated $8 billion.Footnote 1 This investment in molding public opinion could potentially pay dividends for China and the United States. Scholarship shows that public opinion shapes important foreign policy outcomes, such as whether politicians support using military force (Tomz et al., Reference Tomz, Weeks and Yarhi-Milo2020; Chu and Recchia, Reference Chu and Recchia2022) and whether nations join military alliances or strike trade deals (Milner and Tingley, Reference Milner and Tingley2011; Cooley, Reference Cooley2012; Goldsmith and Horiuchi, Reference Goldsmith and Horiuchi2012). Yet despite the importance of public opinion for international relations, recent scholarship provides conflicting expectations about when public diplomacy efforts persuade.\n\nIn this letter, we theorize that positive public diplomacy emphasizing aid and friendship builds foreign support and that negative public diplomacy critiquing geopolitical rivals is ineffective and can even backfire. Examples of positive public diplomacy include Chinese diplomats’ efforts to highlight the country's pandemic aid or infrastructure programs in developing countries. These positive messages build support for increased bilateral cooperation—as well as more general goodwill toward the donor government and nation—by causing audiences to update their beliefs about the material benefits of a country's foreign policy. Negative public diplomacy, on the other hand, focuses on critiques of geopolitical rivals, such as Chinese diplomats who use social media platforms to condemn the United States. Public diplomacy in which one great power criticizes another is less relevant to the material and political concerns of the audiences in a third country, such as India, targeted by public diplomacy. We argue negative public diplomacy is ineffective at building support, and can under some circumstances even backfire.\n\nWe arrive at these conclusions based on an experiment that randomly exposed Indian citizens to actual Twitter messages from Chinese diplomats. The preregistered experiment randomized whether recipients in India saw messages that promoted Chinese aid and friendship, messages from so-called “Wolf Warrior” diplomats who criticized the United States,Footnote 2 or a placebo condition. This experiment was embedded in a survey that was fielded in two waves, one shortly before and one immediately after deadly clashes between the Indian and Chinese armies along the Sino-Indian border in June 2020. India is a hard case for studying the effectiveness of Chinese public diplomacy: in a recent Pew study, Indians had the most pessimistic view of China's economic rise out of 34 surveyed countries.Footnote 3\n\nDespite a history of conflict and mistrust between China and India, we find that positive Chinese public diplomacy touting aid and friendship had robust effects—strikingly, these positive messages improve public perceptions of China even immediately after violent territorial conflict. Our evidence suggests that these changes in attitudes are largely a consequence of respondents’ updating their beliefs about the generosity of Chinese foreign aid, consistent with prior research on the reputational benefits of aid (Goldsmith et al., Reference Goldsmith, Horiuchi and Wood2014)."
