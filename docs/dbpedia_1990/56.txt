The reign of Peter the Great has come, rightly or wrongly, to be identified above all with change, departure from tradition and, in the Russian context, Westernization. The reforms which he carried out affected many areas of Russian life and society, but there were few where the transformation was as unequivocal, or its progress as readily observable as in diplomacy. It was evident not only in the changing nature of Russia's relations with the countries of Europe, but also in the manner in which these relations were conducted.

From his 17th century predecessors, Peter had inherited certain elaborate, rigid and uniquely Muscovite forms and patterns for the sending and receiving of diplomatic missions, which reflected more closely the xenophobia and traditionalism of 17th century Russian society than they did the practical needs of diplomacy.

The break with tradition began almost at once with the rapid disappearance of many Muscovite practices and the introduction of certain Western-style innovations at the very beginning of Peter's reign, but the break was not yet total, for during much of this period the old Muscovite attitudes and assumptions lingered on.

Although Russia did not begin to emerge as a great power until the reign of Peter the Great, she had frequent diplomatic relations with a number of European powers during the 16th and particularly the 17th centuries. Her relations were most extensive with such neigh-
