Allen was a civil engineer and magazine editor who was involved in the railroad industry for his entire career. He is best known for creating and promoting the first practical time zone standard for North America. Most U.S. and Canadian railroads, and many large cities, adopted the hour-based zones of Standard Time on November 18, 1883, replacing an unwieldy patchwork of about 100 localized time customs.\n\nAllen was born in and grew up in Bordentown, New Jersey. At age 15, Allen was forced to leave school to support his family when his father died in the Civil War. He took a succession of railroad surveying and engineering jobs, starting out as a rodman on the Camden and Amboy. In 1868, he became resident engineer of the West Jersey Railroad. In addition to his direct duties with the railroad, he helped create the town of Wenonah, a suburban resort community designed to stimulate passenger traffic.\n\nIn 1872, Allen became assistant editor and then editor of the Travelers' Official Guide, a monthly railroad and steamship guidebook then being published in Philadelphia. Starting in 1875, Allen was elected secretary of two railroad industry associations: the General and Southern Railway Time Conventions. In these positions, Allen became aware of the problems caused by the lack of time standardization between railroads and also between cities.\n\nIn 1882, the two groups requested that Allen provide a report on a nationwide time standard that would be acceptable for railroad managers. Allen's proposal the next spring laid out the idea of five hour-based time zones for North America. What made Allen's proposal unique was that the divisions between zones occurred at existing railroad stations or junction points, not at state borders or mountain ranges as in earlier scientific proposals.\n\nAfter receiving an initial stamp of approval from the two Time Convention bodies, Allen was then delegated to convince all of the railroads in the U. S. and Canada to adopt the new system. After a swift six-week campaign of writing letters, distributing circulars, and sending telegrams, Allen received support from a majority of railroad companies large and small. Once the November cut-over date was established, he also worked to encourage large cities to change their public clocks over to the new standard.\n\nAllen continued his pivotal roles in the railroad industry for the rest of his life. In addition to his duties at the Traveler's Official Guide -- later published in New York City -- he remained as secretary of the Time Convention organizations and the successor American Railway Association.\n\nAllen married Caroline Perry Yorke, daughter of West Jersey Railroad president Thomas Jones Yorke, in 1871. Their three oldest children (Yorke, Frederick, and Eugene) were born in Camden while the family lived in William's native Bordentown. The Allens moved to South Orange in 1880, and shortly after their youngest son John was born.\n\nWilliam Allen was active in several civic roles in South Orange, including as a village trustee and library board member. He created and served as president of the Meadow Land Society, which was similar to a homeowners' association and private club. He also served on the vestry board of the Church of the Holy Communion, a Protestant Episcopal congregation.\n\nAllen died in 1915 at his South Orange home, and is buried in a family plot at Rosedale Cemetery. His Standard Time accomplishment is memorialized in at least two places: 1) on a plaque at the former Bordentown City Hall, and 2) on a plaque at Washington, DC Union Station.
