However, others are non-native or invasive species.\n\nNon-native species originated elsewhere and have been introduced to the area where they now live.\n\nInvasive species outcompete other species, causing damage to the ecosystem; most invasives are non-native, but there are instances in which a native species can be considered invasive.\n\nSome of the basin's living resources are considered threatened or endangered, protected by state and federal regulations.\n\nDRBC's 2019 State of the Basin Report included a section on Living Resources (pdf 6.3 MB).\n\nIn Sept. 2021, DRBC gave a presentation on water quality that included a discussion of estuary fisheries at the 9th Annual Delaware River Watershed Forum (pdf 3.6 MB)\n\nInformation is provided below on several key species in the Delaware River Basin.\n\nAmerican Eel\n\nAn American eel. Photo by the DRBC.\n\nAmerican eels, Anguilla rostrata, are a species of fish that are found in various freshwater and estuarine waterways in the Delaware River Basin, from rivers and creeks to lakes and ponds.\n\nAmerican eels are catadromous, which means they are born in the ocean, live as adults in freshwater and return to the ocean to reproduce. All eels reproduce/are born in the same place - the Sargasso Sea, which is a part of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Delaware River is home to an abundant eel population because there are no dams on its mainstem to prevent the eel’s upriver migration.\n\nAmerican Eel Life Cycle\n\nAfter hatching in the Sargasso Sea, American eel larvae travel on ocean currents to the U.S. eastern seaboard. These larvae are called glass eels because of their translucent bodies.\n\nAs they travel up estuaries and into rivers, they continue to grow and change color, from translucent to gray (called elvers) to yellow to silver. Maturity can take up to 20 years!\n\nOnce mature and the weather starts to turn colder, American eels will begin their journey down rivers and into the Atlantic Ocean, back to the Sargasso Sea.\n\n• Learn more about American eel\n\nAmerican Shad\n\nAn American shad. Photo: DRBC archives.\n\nAmerican shad, Alosa sapidissima, are the largest North American member of the herring family. Adults commonly reach four to eight pounds. They fill an important role in the food chain as predator and prey.\n\nThey are an anadromous fish, which means they are born in freshwater, like the Delaware River, live for several years in the ocean and return to the river in which they were born to spawn (lay their eggs).\n\nFemale shad are called roes; males bucks.\n\nShad Life Cycle\n\nAfter hatching in the spring, the young shad (called \"fry\") grow rapidly, feeding on freshwater plankton and aquatic insects.\n\nDecreasing water temperatures in the late summer and early fall trigger a mass migration downriver to the ocean.\n\nOnce in the ocean, where they live most of their lives, shad will migrate up and down the coast, from their winter range off the mid-Atlantic to their summer range in the Bay of Fundy, off Nova Scotia.\n\nAfter three-to-five years at sea, American shad will return in the spring to the river of their birth to spawn. They feed heavily prior to spawning and do not eat during their trip \"home.\"\n\nLearn more about American shad\n\nAtlantic Sturgeon\n\nAtlantic Sturgeon. Image courtesy of fisheries.noaa.gov.\n\nAtlantic sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrinchus, belong to a category of ancient bony fishes, which may live up to 60 years, reach lengths up to 14 feet and weigh over 800 pounds.\n\nAtlantic sturgeon are anadromous, which means they are born in freshwater, like the Delaware River, live in the ocean until they reach maturity and return to the river in which they were born to spawn (lay their eggs).\n\nIn the Delaware River, they spawn in the freshwater portion of the estuary, on the river's bottom. Juveniles will spend several years in the river before moving out to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAfter spawning, sturgeon will return the ocean; they can make multiple spawning runs during their lifetimes.\n\nSturgeon in the Delaware River\n\nDelaware River sturgeon were once the largest population on the Atlantic Coast. They were very popular for their eggs. In the late 1800s, Philadelphia was considered the \"caviar capital of North America.\" Subsequent over-fishing, habitat loss and water quality issues led to dramatic reductions in their numbers.\n\nIn 2012, the federal government listed all five distinct population segments of Atlantic sturgeon as endangered or threatened; the Delaware River is part of the \"New York Bight\" and is considered endangered.\n\nMortality from shipping traffic strikes, impaired habitat and water quality all threaten current populations. While recent Delaware River Basin-specific surveys have indicated some spawning success, additional research is needed for future predictions on species recovery.\n\nLearn more about Atlantic sturgeon\n\nBald Eagles\n\nA bald eagle catches a meal. Photo by Michael Porter.\n\nToday, Bald eagles, Haliaeetus leucocephalus, are found in every state in the Delaware River Basin.\n\nOne very important reason for the return of the eagle was the federal government’s decision in 1972 to ban the manufacturing of DDT in the United States.\n\nPrograms by the DRBC and other agencies and organizations to keep the river and its tributaries clean, the fish abundant, and the habitat undisturbed also have been a big help in the recovery of the bald eagle population throughout the basin.\n\nPredominantly fish eaters, bald eagles typically build their nests and live near water.\n\nBald Eagles in the DRB\n\nIn addition to its resident populations, the Basin also is home to wintering bald eagles, those that spend the winter here to fish in waters that aren't frozen all season long.\n\nIn fact, the 120-mile stretch of the Delaware River from Hancock, N.Y. to the Delaware Water Gap is one of the largest and most important inland bald eagle wintering habitats in the Northeastern United States.\n\n• Learn more about bald eagles\n\nFreshwater Mussels\n\nPhoto of a creeper, a freshwater mussel. Photo by DRBC.\n\nFreshwater mussels are bivalve mollusks that live along, and in, the sandy bottoms of rivers, streams and lakes. They help stabilize erosion, and as filter-feeders, freshwater mussels clean the water in which they live, improving water quality and enriching habitat.\n\nThey are considered one of, if not the, most at-risk animal group in the United States, with many species considered threatened or endangered by state and federal governments.\n\nOne reason for their decline is their complicated reproduction strategies, which are dependent on fish hosts.\n\nFreshwater Mussels in the DRB\n\nThere are over a dozen species of freshwater mussels which are native to the Delaware River Basin, but, like in other parts of the country, their populations have dwindled over time.\n\nExamples include the creeper, Strophitus undulatus, yellow lampmussel, Lampsilis cariosa, eastern elliptio, Elliptio complanata, and dwarf wedgemussel, Alasmidonta heterodon.\n\n• Learn more about freshwater mussels\n\nHorseshoe Crabs\n\nHorseshoe crabs. Photo courtesy of USFWS.\n\nHorseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus, are one of the oldest creatures on the planet. Did you know they have been around since the time of the dinosaurs?\n\nLittle has changed in those 300+ million years.\n\nHorseshoe crabs are more closely related to spiders than crabs.\n\nThe Delaware Bay is home to the largest population of spawning horseshoe crabs in the world.\n\nHorseshoe Crab Life Cycle\n\nEvery spring, warming waters stir the crabs from the depths of the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean to the sandy coastlines of Delaware and New Jersey. At the high tides of the full and new moons, female horseshoe crabs come ashore to lay their eggs. Waiting at the tide line, a male grabs hold of the female’s shell.\n\nThe female digs a shallow nest in the sand and lays up to 20,000 small, olive-green eggs. Next she drags the male over top to fertilize the eggs. Then they cover the eggs with sand and return to the water.\n\nAfter two to four weeks, the 1/8 inch-long juvenile crabs hatch, dig to the surface, and head for the water. Feeding on tiny worms, clams and dead fish, the young crabs continue to grow and molt until they reach sexual maturity around 10 years of age. Females typically attain larger sizes than males. It is believed that they live up to approximately 20 years.\n\nLearn more about horseshoe crabs\n\nMacroinvertebrates (Aquatic Bugs)\n\nMacroinvertebrates collected for an educational lesson.\n\nPhoto by DRBC.\n\nBenthic macroinvertebrates are bottom dwelling (benthic) animals and insect larvae that you can see without a microscope (macro) and don't have a backbone (invertebrate).\n\nSimply, they are aquatic bugs.\n\nThey live in streams, lakes and rivers attached to rocks, vegetation and other plant debris or burrowed into the bottom sand and sediments.\n\nExamples include aquatic insects, worms, crayfish, clams and snails.\n\nThey are an important part of the food chain. They feed on leaves and algae and fish feed on them.\n\nA Clean Water Indicator\n\nMacroinvertebrates are used by scientists as a biological indicator of water quality. Some are very sensitive to pollution and others are more tolerant. When more pollution-sensitive species are found in a waterbody, it is a positive sign that the water is clean.\n\n• Learn more about macroinvertebrates\n\nInvasive Species\n\nA Northern snakehead. Photo courtesy of the\n\nPhiladelphia Water Department.\n\nInvasive species are animals, plants or other organisms introduced (intentionally or accidently) into habitats outside their natural environment.\n\nTheir introduction into new habitats is currently one of the greatest impacts to biodiversity and species extirpation (localized extinction), as invasive species often compete with or kill native species.\n\nTheir presence can also further weaken ecosytems already impacted by pollution, climate change and habitat fragmentation.\n\nOne of the most common reasons for the introduction of a new species is horticulture. Other species are generally introduced through means of farming, hunting, fishing or even as new exotic pets.\n\nExamples of Invasive Species in the DRB\n\nThe Northern snakehead (pictured) is an invasive species that has been found in the Delaware River Basin.\n\n• View listing of other common invasives in the DRB, from the 2019 State of the Basin Report (jpg)\n\nIt is important for governments and non-profits in the Basin to work together to implement management and eradication strategies for invasives, as well as communicate to the public about the concern for invasive species and the importance of preserving our native species.\n\nResources to Learn More\n\nDelaware: Invasive Species\n\nDelaware: Invasive Fish in Delaware Storymap\n\nDelaware Currents: \"Invasive fish in Delaware River poses growing threat, officials warn\" (Nov. 23, 2023)\n\nNational Invasive Species Awareness Week\n\nNational Park Service Upper Delaware: Non-Native Species\n\nNew Jersey Fish & Wildlife: Aquatic Invasive Species\n\nNew Jersey Spotlight: \"Invasive blue catfish threaten marine ecosystems in Delaware River Watershed\" (Jan. 2, 2024)\n\nNew York: Invasive Species\n\nNorth American Invasive Species Management Association\n\nPA Dept. of Agriculture: Invasive Species of Concern for Pennsylvania\n\nPA Dept. of Conservation and Natural Resources: Invasive Plant Fact Sheets\n\nPA Fish and Boat Commission: Aquatic Invasive Species\n\nPenn State Extension: Invasive & Competing Plants\n\nUSDA National Invasive Species Information Center\n\nOther DRB Creatures"
