        "text": "The Oscars are coming this weekend. How can we make it about Delaware?\n\nThe Delaware Oscars Party is returning for a second year, this time at Goldey-Beacom College. The event will not only celebrate the Academy’s nominees and winners, it will also honor four Delaware creative entrepreneurs whose contributions to film, music and art are enhancing the First State.\n\nThe honorees are:\n\nJet Phynx — A filmmaker with almost 20 years in the entertainment industry, Phynx worked in New York and California with artists including Lady Gaga before starting his namesake film company in Wilmington. Last August, he launched The Dirty Popcorn Festival, Delaware’s first Black Film Festival.\n\nSara Crawford — A fine artist, curator, stylist and director of The Women’s Business Center at True Access Capital, her work combines art, fashion and empowerment for women entrepreneurs, including the H.E.R (Helping Entrepreneur Rise) business plan competition.\n\nMaya Belardo — At just 17, jazz singer Belardo headlined the 2016 Clifford Brown Jazz Festival. She continues to both perform and share her favorite artists with the “Maya Belardo Presents” series in partnership with the Wilmington Library.\n\nEleeseia McFashion Wells — In her 10+ years in the makeup industry, Wells has applied her cosmetics talent to a host of political figures, executives, reality stars and celebrities. Born in California, she is proudly based in the Greater Delaware area.\n\n“I decided to use the biggest night in Hollywood as my springboard to honor the creatives in this state,” organizer Porsha Greene said. “I may not be originally from here, but I live here now and I strive to make a difference and give people their flowers while they still can smell them. I selected these four because I see them moving constantly, making moves and guess what? They are getting stuff done!”\n\nThe event itself will feature a red carpet, Oscars photo booth, Oscar night trivia, cocktails, a special guest DJ and an Oscars watch party."
