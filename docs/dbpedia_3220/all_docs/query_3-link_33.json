        "text": "May-September, 2020\n\nWillingtown Square Gallery\n\nIn the early 1880’s, immigrants from the newly unified Republic of Italy began appearing in northern Delaware, mostly in Wilmington, searching for work. Many immigrants moved on to other American towns or returned to their homeland after a specific job was completed. However, a few saw something they liked in the rolling hills of northern Delaware and, despite a language barrier and unfamiliar culture, chose to stay and lay down roots. Most were from southern Italy, an agrarian and economically stagnant region in the decades following Italian unification. They came to America, the Land of Opportunity, in search of material prosperity.\n\nEight identifiable pockets of settlement developed in and near Wilmington in the early 20th century. • They gradually assimilated into broader American society as the 20th century progressed, except for the largest enclave on what was called “The Hill” due to its high elevation on Wilmington’s west side. Today it is known as “Little Italy”. The founding of St. Anthony’s Parish and Church solidified the cohesion of the local Italian community there and led to the formation of the regionally famous Carnevale, the St. Anthony’s Italian Festival.\n\nThis exhibit celebrated “un villagio vivace e unico”, a vibrant and unique village. It included various materials derived from the Delaware Historical Society’s library and museum collection, as well as loans and gifts from St. Anthony’s Parish and friends in the local community.\n\nFall 2012\n\nDelaware History Museum\n\nPlay Ball! celebrated the origins, early years, and 20th century development of the National Pastime in the First State. It featured a very rare original scorebook from games played by the Lenapi Baseball Club of New Castle in 1866. Other highlights included original, handwritten rules and by-laws created by local businessmen forming their own team, rare photographs of local amateur clubs, and baseballs, bats, gloves, and novelty items. One of the baseballs in the exhibit was signed by Legendary Baseball Hall of Famer William Julius “Judy” Johnson, who played for the Hilldale Stars of the Negro Leagues in the 1920s. Johnson lived in Marshallton, Delaware from 1934 until his death in 1989 and was one of the greatest third basemen of his era. The home field of the current Wilmington Blue Rocks is named Judy Johnson Field in his honor.\n\nWinter, 2007\n\nWillingtown Square Gallery\n\nEmily Bissell was born in Wilmington, Delaware on May 31, 1861. She spent her entire life in Wilmington as a social worker, philanthropist, humanitarian, author, and activist. She founded the West End Neighborhood House in Wilmington which served many community based functions in immigrant Irish and German families. Interestingly, she was also an outspoken anti-suffragist in the early 1900s. In 1907, Bissell was drawn to the cause of helping those suffering from Tuberculosis. She was intrigued by an experiment then occurring in Denmark for issuing stamps to raise money in the fight against TB. She is best known for introducing the same idea, what we now know as the Christmas Seal to Delaware and the United States. She designed the first stamp herself. Well known illustrator, Howard Pyle, designed the second stamp. Bissell passed away on March 8th, 1948."
