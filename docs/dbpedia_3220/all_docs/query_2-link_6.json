        "text": "The Sixties: Moments in Time\n\nThis timeline offers a sample of newsworthy happenings from the 1960s. The events used in this interactive timeline were chosen on the basis of importance at the time, and continuing significance for American culture at the start of the 21st century.\n\nLaunch the Flash Version Â»\n\nWar & Peace\n\nViet Cong Emerge\n\nAn armed coalition of communists and insurgents emerge in South Vietnam.\n\nU.S. Buildup Begins\n\nWhite Paper advises increased U.S. presence in Vietnam.\n\nU.S. Will Fire Back\n\nKennedy declares U.S. advisers in 'Nam will defend themselves.\n\n$2 Billion Wasted\n\nKennedy hears from Senate leader after Saigon trip to see outcome of U.S. aid.\n\nU.S. Gets Tough\n\nNew in office, President Johnson pushes for stiffer policies on Vietnam.\n\nCoup in Saigon\n\nSouth Vietnam military sets up third government in three months.\n\nGulf of Tonkin\n\nThe USS Maddox is on spy patrol 30 miles off the coast of Vietnam when it reports an attack by three enemy vessels. Another U.S. ship reports an attack on Aug 4. (Later inquiries will cast doubt on both reports.) On Aug 7, Congress passes the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, allowing Pres. Johnson to wage war against North Vietnam without a formal Declaration of War.\n\nU.S. Navy Arrives\n\nAfter North Vietnam goes into Laos, U.S. moves 2 carriers offshore.\n\nOperation \"Rolling Thunder\" Begins\n\nJohnson approves Rolling Thunder in February, believing that a program of limited bombing in North Vietnam will deter support for Vietcong. Rolling Thunder continues for three years and eight months, involving 305,380 raids and 634,000 tons of bombs. Results include: 818 pilots killed and hundreds more captured; 182,000 civilians killed in North Vietnam.\n\nFirst Anti-Vietnam War Teach-In\n\nAnti-war faculty members and the SDS publicize and protest U.S. involvement in Vietnam. About 3,000 attend.\n\nU.S. Goes on the Offensive\n\nU.S. troops in Vietnam get permission to go on the offensive.\n\nMartin Luther King Opposes War\n\nBreaking with the President, Martin Luther King announces his opposition to the war.\n\n385,300 U.S. Troops in 'Nam\n\nMore troops are on their way: 33,000 are stationed in Thailand; 60,000 sail offshore.\n\nProtesters March to U.N.\n\n400,000 march to U.N. building and hear speeches by Martin Luther King and Dr. Benjamin Spock.\n\nMarch to Pentagon\n\nNorman Mailer joins march to Pentagon; He recounts events in Armies of the Night for which he earns a Pulitzer.\n\nSecretary of Defense Resigns\n\nRobert McNamara is ousted following months of increasing conflict with the President and military leaders. McNamara's removal is precipitated by private communications with the President, and public remarks questioning Johnson's policies. Just weeks before, McNamara had testified in a Senate hearing that U.S. bombing raids against North Vietnam were not achieving their objectives, movement of supplies to South Vietnam had not been reduced, and that neither the economy nor the morale of the North Vietnamese had been broken.\n\nTet Offensive Launched by Vietcong\n\nTo the Vietnamese, Tet is a culturally important celebration of the Lunar New Year. U.S. planners and troops are unprepared when the North Vietnamese and Vietcong use festivities as cover, surging into Saigon and other key cities. Within days, U.S. forces retake most areas; an intense battle for Hue rages for 26 days. Retaking the area, U.S. troops discover mass graves containing the bodies of thousands of people who had been executed during the Communist occupation during and after Tet. The Offensive is a military disaster for the guerillas, with 37,000 dead. The U.S. lost 2,500 men, undermining public support for the war and giving the Vietcong a political victory.\n\nCronkite Urges Negotiations to End War\n\nCBS news anchor Walter Cronkite, known as America's \"most-trusted man,\" files a special report from Vietnam. He experiences intensive combat in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive. Departing from accepted news style, Cronkite shares his personal feelings, telling viewers he is \"more certain than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate.\" Insiders see this as a key factor in Johnson's decision to offer negotiations and not seek re-election in '68.\n\nMy Lai Massacre\n\nCharlie Company, 11th Brigade, is on a \"search and destroy\" mission in the hamlet of My Lai. Something goes horribly wrong, resulting in violent death for hundreds of unarmed civilians, including women, children, and the elderly. After one and a half years, the officer at My Lai, Lt. William Calley, is brought up on murder charges. News of atrocities at My Lai doesn't reach public media until November 1969. In March 1971, Calley is convicted and sentenced to life; he is paroled in September 1975 after serving three and a half years.\n\nChicago 7 Trial Begins\n\nCharges are tied to rioting at '68 chicago convention. The defendants use the proceedings to put the War on trial.\n\nTwo Million Take Part in Peace Moratorium\n\nA one-day nationwide action, the Peace Moratorium is the largest demonstration in U.S. history. Protestors include many first-time activists. Events include religious services, street rallies, public meetings, school seminars, and marches. Participants wear black armbands to signify opposition to the war and honor the dead. Washington, D.C., a natural focal point, draws 250,000 demonstrators.\n\nPolitics\n\nU2 Plane Shot Down\n\nSoviet Russia shoots down U.S. spy plane. Pilot Francis Gary Powers is detained for two years.\n\nStudents Protest HUAC Tactics\n\nStudents and teachers organize a protest the powerful (HUAC) in San Francisco. Police use fire hoses and clubs to remove demonstrators, injuring and arresting many.\n\nFirst Televised Presidential Debate Airs\n\nThe debate between presidential candidates Kennedy and Nixon is broadcast nationally on all TV networks (only three networks exist in 1960), and on network radio. It is a Monday evening, and 70 million viewers are watching. On TV, Nixon is visibly pale and badly attired, while Kennedy appears tan and relaxed. Political campaigning is suddenly a new ballgame, and image can beat substance.\n\nKennedy Elected\n\nJohn F. Kennedy wins presidency in tightest election since 1884.\n\nBay of Pigs: Failed Invasion of Cuba\n\nCIA-backed Cuban exiles launch a failed attempt to remove Fidel Castro from power. An international embarrassment, the episode puts Kennedy's leadership in question.\n\nU.S. Denies Soviet Control of Space\n\nThe battle for technological superiority is a central theme in the Cold War between the U.S. and Russia -- and space technology is especially valuable because of military applications such as nuclear missile systems. On April 12, 1961, the Soviets put the first man in space. In response, Kennedy delivers a televised speech on May 25, announcing a new vision for the U.S. in space. His goal is to land a man on the moon before the end of the decade, and before the Soviets do. NASA is under pressure to produce rapid progress in the space program. On February 20, 1962, NASA's first effort, Friendship 7, carries astronaut John Glenn around Earth three times.\n\nKennedy Warns of Possible Nuclear Attack\n\nPresident Kennedy advises citizens to be ready for nuclear attack, and build family bomb shelters.\n\nUSSR Tests Hydrogen Bomb\n\nThe Soviet Union fires a 50-megaton hydrogen bomb, the biggest explosion in history.\n\nFirst SDS Convention\n\nThe convention yields a '60s student manifesto, the Port Huron Statement: Agenda for a Generation.\n\nCuban Missile Crisis\n\nPhotos by U.S. spy planes reveal the Soviets are positioning camouflaged nuclear missiles in Cuba. Kennedy orders a naval blockade of Cuba to prevent delivery of more missiles. The world holds its breath during a week of tense negotiations to resolve the standoff. The crisis ends when Russia agrees to remove the Cuban missiles, in exchange for the U.S. removing similar missiles from Turkey. It was a week that brought the world to the brink of mutual nuclear annihilation, and spurred one of the greatest quotes of the Cold War, when Secretary of State Dean Rusk observed, \"We were eyeball to eyeball, and the other guy just blinked.\"\n\nNixon Loses Governor's Race\n\nNixon blames his California defeat on the media, saying, \"You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference.\"\n\n\"Hot-Line\" Phones Installed\n\nA pari of \"hot line\" phones are installed in the Oval Office and Kremlin, a direct result of the prior year's crisis in Cuba.\n\nKennedy Assassinated\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy is shot and killed in Dallas, Texas. Lyndon Johnson is quick sworn in as President.\n\nDemocrats Hire Ad Agency\n\nDemocrats hire a top-10 ad agency for the '64 campaign. Agency produces a number of hard-hitting spots, including the \"Daisy Ad\".\n\nJohnson Defeats Goldwater\n\nReceiving more than 60 percent of the popular vote, incumbent Democrat Lyndon Johnson easily defeats Republican Barry Goldwater. During the campaign, Goldwater is an overt hawk regarding the war in Vietnam, while Johnson takes a sharply contrasting stance, suggesting de-escalation. In fact, the war escalates dramatically during the next 4 years of Johnson's administration.\n\nJohnson Signs Medicare Bill\n\nThe legislation establishes a health program for the elderly.\n\nVoting Rights Act\n\nThe legislation ends discrimination at the polls.\n\nEdward Brook Elected\n\nThe Republican from Massachusetts becomes the first African American Senator in 85 years.\n\nThurgood Marshall Confirmed\n\nThe U.S. Senate confirms Thurgood Marshall to the becomes first African American to sit on the U.S. supreme court.\n\nRobert Kennedy Asassinated\n\nSenator Robert Kennedy dies of gunshot wounds in Los Angeles, a day after winning the California Presidential primary.\n\nShirley Chisholm Elected to Congress\n\nShirley Chisholm becomes first African American woman elected to Congress.\n\nViolence Scars Convention in Chicago\n\nTurmoil and Robert Kennedy's death push the party toward chaos, while anti-war demonstrators are beaten by police. Prominent activists are charged with inciting the riots.\n\nRichard Nixon Wins Presidency\n\nRunning on a platform of \"law and order,\" Republican Richard Nixon and running mate Spiro Agnew narrowly defeat incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Nixon receives 43.4% of the popular vote, just seven-tenths of 1% more than Humphrey. Third-party segregationist candidate George Wallace receives about 15 percent of the popular vote. Nixon wins a second term in 1972, and resigns from office in 1974.\n\nSALT I Negotiations Begin\n\nThe Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) begin negotiations to curb nuclear capabilities of U.S. and USSR.\n\nPop Culture\n\nMarch 23, 1960\n\nElvis Leaves Army\n\nSergeant Elvis Presley receives honorable discharge after two years in the Army.\n\nFirst LASER is Demonstrated\n\nPhysicist Theodore Maiman uses a core of man-made ruby to create the first successful LASER (an acronym for Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation). The invention has an immediate effect on pop culture, heavily promoted in science fiction books and movies. Inspired by the laser, scientists immediately begin work on fiber-optics technology. Four decades later, lasers are used as precision surgical tools and measurement devices, and also appear in everyday objects such as laser printers, or compact disc and DVD players.\n\n\"The Pill\" is Born\n\nHere is the first drug developed for social rather than medicinal purposes. At first, the Pill is only available to married women, but American culture rapidly adopts the new contraceptive choice. By 1965, over five million American women are on the Pill, even though many states still have laws prohibiting prescriptions for unmarried women and minors. The Pill does not cause the sexual revolution, but certainly enables it. The Pill also brings contraception out of the bedroom and into the living room. It becomes a common theme of magazine articles and books - and even co-stars with David Niven and Deborah Kerr in a 1968 movie: Prudence and the Pill.\n\nDylan's First Public Performance\n\nBob Dylan appears at Gerde's Folk City in his first billed performance.\n\nTV Called A \"Vast Wasteland\"\n\nIn a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters, Newton Minow, head of the FCC, criticizes broadcasters for not doing more to serve the public interest.\n\nKen Kesey Publishes \"Cuckoo's Nest\"\n\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a grim satire is set among the patients and workers in a mental institution.\n\nMarilyn Monroe Dies\n\nHollywood icon Marilyn Monroe, 36, is found dead in her bedroom.\n\nFirst Artificial Heart Implanted\n\nDr. Michael E. De Bakey implants artificial heart in human for first time at a Houston hospital. The Patient survives for only four days.\n\nVatican II Begins\n\nPope John XXIII opens Vatican II. The council holds four sessions and closes Dec. 8, 1965.\n\nSmoking \"Hazardous To Your Health\"\n\nThe first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health is a landmark document, contradicting decades of tobacco advertising that suggest healthful benefits. The report contains powerful material, and intentionally leaves much to speculation. It is released on a Saturday morning to deter a knee-jerk reaction on Wall Street. Acting voluntarily, The New Yorker and other leading magazines start to refuse tobacco ads. Within months, Congress has passed the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965, requiring health warnings on packages and banning ads on broadcast media.\n\nBeatles Appear on Sullivan Show\n\nThe Beatles [Hyperlink To Newsmakers] make two appearances on Ed Sullivan Show. Over 70 million people watch each show.\n\nNader Examines Auto Industry\n\nRalph Nader's book, Unsafe At Any Speed, questions motives of the auto industry.\n\nThe \"Hippie\" Comes Into Being\n\nMichael Fallen starts a series of stories for the San Francisco Examiner, introducing the word \"hippie\" to readers. Fallen's articles describe the migration of beatniks from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury in search of cheaper rents, some popular hippie hangouts such as the notorious Blue Unicorn, and the generally bohemian lifestyle of the beatnik/hippie community. Fallen's articles are widely read, but \"hippie\" doesn't appear in mainstream language for two more years.\n\nCold War Satire Premiers\n\nThe film The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming, tells the story of the comic chaos which ensues when a Soviet submarine runs aground near a small New England town.\n\nStar Trek Debuts\n\nFor next three years, science fiction program goes where no TV series has gone before.\n\nFirst Super Bowl\n\nForty million TV viewers watch the Green Bay Packers beat the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nSummer of Love\n\nUsually this description refers to 1967, in and around San Francisco when the \"hippie movement\" was in full flower. Particularly during the summer months, thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to the Haight-Ashbury to take part in a somewhat pale imitation of the true hippie experience. Many were drawn by the gentle lyrics of a song penned by John Phillips, member of The Mamas & the Papas. Phillips' song San Francisco (written in anticipation of the Monterey Pop Festival in June) romanticizes the era and atmosphere. Scott McKenzie's cover-version of the song is on the airwaves by May -- just in time for summer vacation.\n\nIf you're going to San Francisco,\n\nbe sure to wear some flowers in your hair...\n\nIf you come to San Francisco,\n\nSummertime will be a love-in there.\n\nRolling Stone Magazine Premiers\n\nThe first issue of Rolling Stone, a new magazine devoted to music and popular culture, debuts featuring John Lennon on the cover.\n\nJudi Ford is Crowned Miss America\n\nTelecasts of the Miss America Pageant are among the most popular TV shows of the late '60s, regularly capturing two-thirds of the audience. Feminists realize this popularity means access to national media. In 1968, feminist protestors demonstrate on the Boardwalk outside the Pageant, crown a sheep, and throw symbols of female restraint into a \"Freedom Trash Can.\" Media attention is immediate and generally positive, encouraging protestors to return in subsequent years. In the same city on the same day, the first Miss Black America Contest is held to protest the exclusively \"white\" Miss America Pageant. In the wake of these protests, Pepsi-Cola withdraws sponsorship of the Miss America Pageant, saying it no longer represents the values of American society.\n\nJudy Garland Dies\n\nThe actress is killed by an overdose at age 47. Over 20,000 mourners attend her funeral.\n\nOne Small Step for Man\n\nAlong with Walter Cronkite, over half a billion people watch as the Apollo 11 lander settles on the lunar surface at 4:19 PM, EDT. News anchor Cronkite is almost speechless, exclaiming, \"Man on the moon...oh, boy!\" Six hours later, people are still riveted to the images from space as Neil Armstrong gently sets foot onto the powdery surface of the Moon at 10:56 PM. Buzz Aldrin also walks on the Moon, while the third member of the mission, Michael Collins, remains in orbit aboard the command module.\n\nWoodstock: Three Days of Peace, Music & Love\n\nAn estimated audience of over 400,000 people gather for three days of music near Bethel, NY, swarming across the pastures of Max Yasgur's dairy farm. The festival is the brainchild of four men under age 26 (including one with a multimillion-dollar trust fund). Only 186,000 tickets are sold, so around 200,000 people are expected - but the amazing lineup of bands and musicians draws many more. Fences are pushed over and tickets become pointless. On opening night, sponsors declare free admission to all, and the word spreads like wildfire. Police estimate a million more people trying to reach Woodstock are stuck in traffic jams up to 50 miles away. In rain and mud, thousands listen to Janis Joplin, The Who, Canned Heat, the Grateful Dead, Crosby Stills Nash & Young, and Country Joe & The Fish. On the last morning, guitarist Jimi Hendrix wakes the crowd with a riveting solo version of the national anthem. The final cost is $2.4 million. A film of the concert is released the following year.\n\nFirst E-mail Message\n\nThe first computer transmission is carried by ARPANET at 10:30 PM on October 29 from a host computer at UCLA to another host computer at Stanford.\n\nSesame Street Debuts\n\nProgram is first broadcast on NET, predecessor to PBS.\n\nRevolutions\n\nFirst Sit-In Protests\n\nA group of students launch protests against segregation at a \"Whites only\" lunch counter of the Woolworth store in Greensboro, NC.\n\nSNCC Founded\n\nIn Raleigh, N.C., African American college students create the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to give young blacks a stronger role in the civil rights movement.\n\n\"Freedom Riders\" Leave D.C.\n\nAn interracial group of protesters board buses and travel to the South to test President Kennedy's commitment to civil rights.\n\nBan-The-Bomb Protests\n\nAnti-Nuclear Activists coordinate worldwide protests against nuclear weapons.\n\nSilent Spring Published\n\nRachel Carson's book makes case for the urgent need to protect the environment.\n\nJames Meredith Registers at \"Ole Miss\"\n\nOn Sept 20, with the support a Supreme Court ruling, James Meredith arrives at the Univ. of Mississippi in Oxford, intending to enroll as the school's first black student. The state Governor physically blocks Meredith's progress on Sept 20, and again Sept 25. Talks between the White House and the Governor fail to produce a solution. The Kennedy administration orders federal marshals to Oxford. On Sept 30, rioting kills two students, and wounds 160 marshals. The next morning, Meredith officially registers as a transfer student; he graduates in 1963. Bob Dylan writes Oxford Town about Meredith's experiences.\n\nThe Feminine Mystique Published\n\nBetty Friedan launches the modern feminist movement with her critique of the role of women in society.\n\nGloria Steinem Writes Playboy Bunny Article\n\nAs a freelancer for Show magazine, she writes an infamous undercover expose about harassment and injustices while pretending to be a Playboy bunny.\n\n\"I Have A Dream...\"\n\nDuring the Civil Rights March on Washington, Martin Luther King Jr. delivers one of his most impassioned and memorable speeches to an audience of 250,000.
