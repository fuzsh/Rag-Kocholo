        "text": "Delaware's most famous person is not a former vice president of the United States, a gold-medal winning basketball star or a five-time Tony Award winner.\n\nThose titans of notoriety all pale in comparison to a 33-year-old comedienne best known for deadpan irreverence.\n\nHer name is Aubrey Plaza and she's the biggest star from the second smallest state, according to nearly 750 News Journal readers.\n\n\"You have spoken and I hear you,\" Plaza said from California. \"I will do my best to represent Delaware in the strangest way possible.\"\n\nPlaza said she probably would have chosen Joe Biden, Valerie Bertinelli or Ryan Phillippe.\n\nBut for Delawareans, the choice was clear.\n\nA total of 312 — or 42 percent — of the readers who ranked our candidates selected Plaza as their top pick. That's more than the next four nominees combined.\n\n\"I'm so honored and incredibly surprised,\" Plaza said. \"But deep down, I feel like I've accomplished nothing. I feel empty inside.\"\n\nGiven her relatively limited exposure, Plaza's selection might come as a surprise to some.\n\nHer biggest roles on the silver screen have included star turns in well-regarded, but little-known indie gems such as the 2017 black comedy \"Ingrid Goes West\" and 2012's science-fiction romantic comedy \"Safety Not Guaranteed.\"\n\nPlaza is still riding high from playing April Ludgate, a deliciously cynical and disaffected character on the beloved NBC sitcom, \"Parks and Recreation,\" a show that also helped to launch the careers of Chris Pratt, Nick Offerman and Aziz Ansari.\n\nHer star also continues to rise with regular appearances on FX's mind-bending, Marvel Comics tie-in show \"Legion,\" guest spots on CBS's \"Criminal Minds\" and a co-starring role with Anna Kendrick and Zac Efron in the 2016 film \"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,\" which so just happened to rake in $77 million.\n\nShe still finds time to help out the Wilmington Drama League, where she got her start with slightly less-famous, famous actor John Gallagher Jr., who clocked in at No. 15.\n\n\"My goal is to put Delaware on the map for something other than that stupid '90s 'Wayne's World' reference everyone quotes to me whenever I tell them where I'm from,\" she said. \"I mean, there is extraterrestrial life out there. I think we should start a campaign to have them visit Delaware first so we can be known for being the first state for something really cool.\"\n\nEven though Delaware might not have a central place in the national consciousness, Plaza said she would not want to be from anywhere else.\n\n\"There is something in the water or the Grotto Pizza sauce that makes us all freaks,\" she said. \"We need to embrace that and let our freak flags fly because we're No.1 and no one can bring us down. Just Dewey it!\"\n\nIf you still think Plaza's undisputed title as Delaware's Most Famous is a shock, wait until you see where our readers ranked the rest of the candidates:\n\n2. Clifford Brown\n\nDelaware's greatest jazz musician died well over a half-century ago at the age of 25, but his legend clearly lives on in the minds of News Journal readers. That might be because Wilmington's annual jazz festival has been held in his honor since 1993. If you have any doubt, put on tracks like \"Joy Spring\" or \"Easy Living\" and let that Dela-cool wash over you.\n\n3. Dallas Green\n\nGreen racked up a losing record in professional baseball as both a pitcher and a manager. But the late Newport native — who was signed to the majors fresh out of Conrad High School — did something as a manager that cemented his place in Delaware lore forever: he led the long-suffering Philadelphia Phillies to their first World Series title in 1980. Delaware remembers, skipper.\n\n4. Elena Delle Donne\n\nAre we witness to the greatest athlete in Delaware history? Elena Delle Donne is certainly making a strong case. She led the University of Delaware to the Sweet 16. She won the WNBA's Rookie of the Year and MVP. She's brought home an Olympic gold medal. She's sold roughly a bazillion sneakers. And she's become an inspiration to girls everywhere. Now she can add fourth most famous Delawarean to her list of accomplishments.\n\n5. Bill Press\n\nOK, this one surprised us. Press is a longtime liberal commentator from Delaware City who is perhaps best known for co-hosting debate shows like CNN’s “Spin Room” and “Crossfire” programs or appearing with MSNBC’s “Buchanan and Press.” He's also got a nationally syndicated radio show. But we had no idea you guys thought so highly of him. Check back with us in a couple of days for more press on Bill Press.\n\n6. Joe Biden\n\nThat's right. A guy so Dela-famous he doesn't need an introduction came in at No. 6. After representing Delaware in the U.S. Senate for 36 years and then spending eight years in the White House, it seems Joe's fame is a bit divisive for a lot of you. He got the second most votes for the top spot but even more readers — a full 39 percent — put him at No. 10. A few of you even wrote in \"Anyone but Biden.\" Fame, it seems, is truly fickle.\n\n7. George Thorogood\n\nDelaware's best-selling recording artist finds himself back in the Top 10 for the first time since 1993 when his single \"Get a Haircut\" peaked at No. 2 on Billboard's U.S. Mainstream Rock chart. Not bad for a guy whose biggest hit, \"Bad to the Bone,\" was released nearly 40 years ago. Thorogood put Delaware in the name of his band and repped the First State all the way to two platinum and six gold records. The Deer Park is proud of you, sir.\n\n8. Dan Pfeiffer\n\nThis was another head-scratcher for us. Pfeiffer is a big deal, having served as the communications director for Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and most of his first term. Pod Save America, the progressive political podcast he's co-hosted since last year, also routinely ranks in the top 50 on iTunes. We just never thought you were so into him. Or into podcasts. Or into political flacks. Now we feel bad for not including St. Mark's grad David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, on our candidates list.\n\n9. Elisabeth Shue\n\nAn Academy Award nominee, Shue is a cultural touchstone for many readers, based largely on her seven-year run of playing love interests and leads in classics such \"The Karate Kid,\" \"Adventures in Babysitting,\" \"Cocktail,\" two \"Back to the Future\" films and the underrated \"Soapdish.\" More recently, she has appeared in 71 episodes of \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" and the Bruce Willis-led remake of \"Death Wish.\" Shue did not spend much time in Delaware after her birth, but we'll claim her all the same.\n\n10. Henry Heimlich\n\nA thoracic surgeon who was born in Delaware but left before high school, Heimlich would go on to international fame by literally saving thousands of lives through the technique he invented to stop someone from choking. We can all agree the Heimlich Maneuver sounds much cooler than subdiaphragmatic pressure, right? Our favorite Heimlich fact: at 96, he used the maneuver to save a woman's life just before his own death in 2016. Dela-cool, indeed.\n\nREADERS' CHOICE\n\nDelino DeShields\n\nA Seaford High grad who went on to a 13-year career in Major League Baseball, DeShields received the most write-in votes. The second baseman with a career batting average of .268 played for five teams, including the Baltimore Orioles and the Los Angeles Dodgers, who incredibly traded a young Pedro Martinez to get him. DeShields now manages the Louisville Bats, the Triple-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nTo be fair, Bob Marley technically got the most write-ins.\n\nBut we literally had a rule excluding him from contention, along with anyone else who briefly lived in Delaware but was not born here and did not become famous here.\n\nIt was called The Bob Marley Rule.\n\nOther notable write-ins included the often-misspelled Caesar Rodney, famed illustrator Howard Pyle, Academy Award-winning director Luke Matheny, college basketball star Donte DiVincenzo and yes, even Mr. Celery, one of the Wilmington Blue Rocks' mascots.\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nRELATED\n\nDelaware's Aubrey Plaza stars in new Marvel TV show\n\nDelle Donne gives young, aspiring athletes a role model\n\nPhillies honor Dallas Green with uniform patch\n\nWilmington's festival for all brings joyful noise in honor of Clifford Brown\n\nBiden: 'When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart.'\n\nDelaware native George Thorogood just did this for the first time"
