        "text": "On June 1, 1946 he was a passenger on the C-54E #44-9078 after the war had ended. They took off with a crew of 8 and 30 passengers from Cairo, Egypt during a personnel transport mission to Rome, Italy. The pilot discovered a fire under his seat and tried to extinguish it, however the cockpit became so full of fumes and smoke that they had to abandon the aircraft. They crashed in the Gulf of Salerno off the coast of Italy.\n\nEight members onboard the flight were able to bailout and survived. Remains of seven who were killed were recovered. All others were reported as missing.\n\nWe identified 28 casualties in our archive related to the #44-9078 incident on June 1, 1946."
