        "text": "Cynthia Rothrock is a martial arts expert and athlete, who went on to become a film actress, starring in a number of highly successful martial arts action movies. She first made a name as an action actress in Hong Kong before going on to wow audiences in her home turf. At the time of her popularity, she was well-known as the \"Queen of Martial Arts films\".\n\nCynthia Rothrock is the World Champion in martial arts Forms and Weapons (1981-1985). Her goal was to be undefeated and retire after five years. With over 100 competitions, she holds the undefeated worldwide record in martial arts Forms competition. In weapons competition, Cynthia is the first and only woman to win number one in North America against the men-at that time, women had to compete with the men. She holds five Black Belts with a rank of 8th Dan Grandmaster.\n\nUpon completing her goal of being undefeated in competition, she began her martial arts acting career starring in movies produced and filmed in Hong Kong. Her first movie, Yes, Madam alongside Michelle Yeoh, broke box office records making her a massive star in Hong Kong. After three years of living in Hong Kong, finishing seven films, she returned to the United States to continue her acting career. Today she has starred in over 60 movies.\n\nRothrock has been a role model for women in martial arts and film. She made history by becoming the inaugural woman to grace the cover of Karate Illustrated (August 1981) and holds the distinction of being the first woman featured on the cover three times in the magazine's history.\n\nIn March 2024, Black Belt Magazine named Rothrock number one in its list of \"The Most Influential Women Martial Artists on the Planet.\". Rothrock is a proud inductee into the prestigious Black Belt Hall of Fame, along with Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris. In 2016 she was the first martial artist (male or female) to be inducted into the prestigious International Sports Hall of Fame by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dr. Robert Goldman.\n\nValerie Bertinelli was born in Wilmington, Delaware, to Nancy (Carvin) and Andrew Francis Bertinelli, Jr., a General Motors executive, and raised with her one older and two younger brothers. In her early teens, her father was transferred to a GM assembly plant in the Detroit, Michigan area and her family resided in Clarkston, Michigan, where she attended Clarkston Middle School. A short time later, her father again was transferred to another GM automotive plant in Van Nuys, California. At this time, Bertinelli became neighborhood friends of the daughter of a TV producer and soon enrolled in the Tami Lynn School of Artists to study acting. Tami Lynn launched Valerie's career in the CBS hit TV series, One Day at a Time (1975). Tami Lynn was Valerie's Personal Manager from 1971 through 1979.\n\nIn December 1975, the situation comedy One Day at a Time (1975), produced by Norman Lear, premiered on CBS with Bertinelli as \"Barbara Cooper\", one of two daughters of a recently divorced woman. The show was a long-time hit and ended production in 1984, without being canceled.\n\nBertinelli has starred in three feature films: R.O.B.O.D.O.G. (1979), Verlorene Helden (1986), and Der Berserker (1987). She was also the protagonist of the miniseries, I'll Take Manhattan (1987), based on a novel by Judith Krantz. She has appeared in made-for-TV movies almost annually since 1979. She was also the star of two other situation comedies, Sydney (1990) and Cafe Americain (1993), both of which were canceled after short runs. In 1981, she married rock guitarist Edward Van Halen. They had homes in the Hollywood Hills and Malibu and have a son, Wolfgang Van Halen. They separated in 2001, when Van Halen had tongue cancer. In 2005, Bertinelli filed for divorce for irreconcilable differences and, it was finalized two years later. Ms. Bertinelli is still chiefly remembered by her television fans for her work on One Day at a Time (1975).\n\nAn adored actress, Bertinelli's long and celebrated career has expanded to include equally beloved TV personality, spokesperson and best-selling author. She stars as \"Melanie Moretti\" on the Emmy® Award-winning series, Hot in Cleveland (2010), which in 2011 was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award® for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. The comedy revolves around three fabulous LA women of a certain age, and best friends (Bertinelli, Jane Leeves and Wendie Malick) whose lives are changed forever when their plane, bound for Paris, unexpectedly lands in Cleveland. Once safely on the ground, they soon rediscover themselves in this new \"promised land\" -- meeting their new landlord, played by Betty White, along the way.\n\nElisabeth Shue was born in Wilmington, Delaware, to Anne Brewster (Wells), who worked for the Chemical Banking Corporation, and James William Shue, a lawyer and real estate developer. She is of German and English ancestry, including descent from Mayflower passengers. Shue's parents divorced while she was in the fourth grade. Owing to the occupational demands of her parents, Shue and her siblings found plenty of time to get into trouble in their suburban neighborhood, but Elisabeth soon enrolled in Wellesley College, an all-female institution which kept her out of trouble.\n\nDuring her studies, she found a way to make a little extra money by acting in television commercials. Elisabeth became a common sight in ads for Burger King, DeBeers diamonds, and Hellman's mayonnaise. In 1984, she landed a role in the Karate Kid (1984) as the on-screen girlfriend of Ralph Macchio and a role as the teenage daughter of a military family in the short-lived series Air Force (1984). At this time, Shue got herself an acting coach and transferred to Harvard, where she began studying political science.\n\nShe continued her acting work with Die Nacht der Abenteuer (1987), Cocktail (1988), Lieblingsfeinde - Eine Seifenoper (1991) and Die blonde Versuchung (1991). Unfortunately, time was catching up with the impressive girl-next-door. Her brother Andrew Shue had almost eclipsed her own fame by landing a starring role in the hit TV series Melrose Place (1992). It was at this time that Elisabeth took a chance on a low-budget, high-risk project entitled Leaving Las Vegas: Liebe bis in den Tod (1995), directed by Mike Figgis. Her gutsy portrayal of a prostitute mixed up with a suicidal alcoholic paid off as she was recognized with a Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards that year. This was the turning point of her career. What followed was a barrage of film roles, including The Saint - Der Mann ohne Namen (1997), Woody Allen's Harry außer sich (1997), Palmetto (1998) and Hollow Man - Unsichtbare Gefahr (2000).\n\nDave Sheridan is an American actor, producer and writer. He is best known for playing Special Officer Doofy in the comedy \"Scary Movie\" (a spoof of deputy sheriff Dewey Riley from \"Scream\").\n\nDave began his career as an intern at \"Saturday Night Live\" during the 1991-1992 season. From there, he entered Chicago's famed comedy troupe, \"The Second City\", where he wrote, directed, and produced \"Dave Sheridan's America\", a multimedia stage show. He created \"Buzzkill\", a 1995 MTV reality series that featured three slacker buddies staging elaborate pranks and catching it all on video. Sheridan appeared in the 2002 music videos for \"By the Way\" (playing a crazy taxi driver) and \"Universally Speaking\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers. He also toured with his band that formed in 2004, Van Stone. Dave hosted a series called \"Smile...You're Under Arrest!\" on the Fox Reality Channel in 2008-09. In 2014, he portrayed Sheriff Lincoln in the parody film The Walking Deceased, inspired by The Walking Dead.\n\nSheridan is well known for his role in \"Scary Movie\" (2000) as Officer Doofy. To this day, Dave continues to wear the Officer Doofy attire and poses with fans for photos at pop culture conventions. Since then, Dave has starred in a number of films produced by the Wayans Brothers, Including \"Little Man\", \"50 Shades of Black\", and both \"A Haunted House\" films. He also portrayed the character Doug in the 2001 film \"Ghost World\". Dave has also starred in many well-known comedies, including \"Bubble Boy\" and \"Sex Drive.\" He is also well known for his work in the horror genre, with films such as Rob Zombie's \"The Devil's Rejects\", Adam Green's fourth installment of the \"Hatchet\" franchise, \"Victor Crowley\", and the 2024 Fuzz on the Lens Productions film \"Stream.\"\n\nQuite distinctive with her dark hollow eyes, sharp ethnic looks and frizzy head of hair, veteran stage actress Kathleen Widdoes began her career enacting delicate but vibrant classical heroines. In later years, she gained significant visibility on TV, particularly as an emotive, but well-meaning and strong-minded presence on various daytime soapers.\n\nBorn on March 21, 1939, in Wilmington, Delaware, Kathleen is the daughter of Eugene Widdoes and his wife, Bernice Delapo. She attended high school there and made her professional stage debut as \"Alma\" in \"Bus Stop\" at age 18 at the Robin Hood Playhouse in Wilmington. She then toured Canada in the role of \"Catherine\" in \"A View from the Bridge\" and played roles in \"Ondine\" and \"The Lark\" on Canadian TV. Additionally, she studied mime at the Université au Théâtre des Nations in Paris, and attended the Sorbonne in Paris on a Fulbright Scholarship, where she completed her theatrical studies.\n\nMoving to New York to pursue her career, Kathleen blossomed into one of the loveliest and most talented classical ingénues around, gaining valuable experience and acclaim on- and off-Broadway in such plays as \"The World of Suzie Wong\" (understudying France Nuyen), \"The Three Sisters\" (1959), \"The Idiot\" (1960) and \"The Maids\" (1963). Moreover, she earned glowing reviews in works of the Bard, most notably for Joseph Papp and his New York Shakespeare Festival. Her early Shakespeare work included \"Henry V\" (1960), \"Measure for Measure\" (1960), \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1961), Richard II (1962) and \"The Tempest\" (1962).\n\nTV audiences first caught sight of her talent in a regular role on the soapy medical drama Young Dr. Malone (1958) and, as \"Emily Webb\" in a prestigious production of Our Town (1959) which also starred Art Carney. The rest of the 1960s was predominantly theater-oriented; however, she did make an impressive film debut as one of Die Clique (1966), alongside fellow newcomers Candice Bergen, Joanna Pettet, Hal Holbrook and Joan Hackett, and appeared prominently in Petulia (1968) and Anton Chekhov's Die Möwe (1968). The 1970s proved to be the pinnacle of Kathleen's stage career capped by her Obie award-winning performance as \"Polly Peacham\" in \"The Beggar's Opera\" in 1972 and a Tony nomination the following year for her vibrant \"Beatrice\" in \"Much Ado About Nothing\", a role preserved for TV. Adding to her Bard stature that decade was her bravura work as \"Desdemona\", \"Juliet\", \"Titania\", \"Viola\" and \"Mariana\".\n\nIn 1978, Kathleen began showing up on daytime drama. She scored big points as young Ray Liotta's emotional and careworn Italian mom, \"Rose Perini\", on Another World (1964) from 1978-1980, and also had a subsequent role on Ryan's Hope (1975) before establishing herself with the role of benevolent advice-giver \"Emma Snyder\" in Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956), a role she has played since November of 1985, earning four daytime Emmy nominations in the process.\n\nIn all that time, Kathleen has maintained a strong profile in the New York theater scene. Credits have included \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", Neil Simon's \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\", the revival of \"You Can't Take It With You\" and \"Hamlet\" (twice playing \"Gertrude\"). She won a second Obie Award for \"Tower of Evil\" in 1990, and was awarded the Lucille Lortel Award for her outstanding participation in \"Franny's Way\" (2002). More recently, she appeared in a revival of Noël Coward's \"After the Ball\" (2004), a musical version of Oscar Wilde's \"Lady Windemere's Fan\".\n\nAlong with her \"As the World Turn\" duties in New York, Kathleen has been seen on TV in episodes of Oz - Hölle hinter Gittern (1997) (recurring), and Law & Order (1990), among others. Divorced in 1972 from the late actor Richard Jordan, by whom she has a daughter Nina Jordan, she is currently married to second husband Jerry Senter. They live just outside of New York City."
