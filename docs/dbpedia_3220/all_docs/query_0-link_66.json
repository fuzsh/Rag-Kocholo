        "text": "Rodney Pierce\n\nGeneral 6/5/2024 9:51:00 PM Courtesy of Ed Hill, Jr., retired Howard University Sports Information Director\n\nA Tribute to A.B. Williamson, A Fallen Bison\n\nAthletics Family Mourns the Loss A.B. Williamson\n\nWASHINGTON (June 5, 2024) – Sunday (June 2), Howard University Athletics lost a member of the family, former men's basketball head coach and athletics administrator A.B. Williamson transitioned after battling health issues.\n\nWilliamson came to Howard after having a highly successful baseball and basketball coaching career at Eastern High School in Washington, D.C. During his career, Williamson led the program to national rankings, including No. 1 in the country. Along the way, he produced several high school All-Americans who went on to play collegiately. Equally successful was the baseball program that won three straight league championships.\n\nFollowing his storied career, Williamson came to The Hilltop in 1975 and it did not take him long to establish the men's basketball program as one of the best in then newly formed Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC). In 1981, the Howard program, under his guidance, advanced to the NCAA Tournament, becoming the first MEAC team to represent the conference in the Big Dance.\n\nWilliamson went on to coach for 15 years and compiled a 228-169 career record, winning back-to-back MEAC titles (1979-80 & 1980-81). He was named MEAC Coach of the Year three times (1980, '83 & '87). In 1986-87, his 25-5 record (13-1 MEAC) still stands as the best in school history, along with his 228 victories.\n\nUnder Williamson, Howard produced a number of all-conference and players of the year, including former NBA Champion Larry Spriggs.\n\nWilliamson is an inductee into both the Howard and MEAC Hall of Fames.\n\nFollowing his coaching career at Howard, he went on to serve as athletics ticket manager, interim athletics director and the first official director of compliance in school history.\n\nFollowing retirement from Howard, the tireless Williamson began to play an active role in the Pigskin Club of Washington, first as member and later as president. During his tenure, the organization expanded its mission.\n\nHere are some testimonials from former players and coaches and others whose lives he touched in alphabetical order by last name:\n\nCy Alexander, former assistant coach at Howard and head coach at South Carolina State (SCSU), Tennessee State and North Carolina A&T State (NCAT), who is one of the winningest coaches in HBCU history with almost 400 victories and has taken two different programs (NCAT & SCSU) to the NCAA Tournament:\n\n\"My college career started under AB. He took a chance on me as a 22-year-old graduate in 1976 and it paid off. He became a mentor and a close friend. I am indebted to him for my success as a college coach.\"\n\nMilan Brown, former Howard player and current assistant at the University of Pittsburgh, who has served as a head coach at Mount St. Mary's and Holy Cross:\n\n\"When I was a freshman, AB helped give me the confidence that I could be a good player if I worked hard. I have taken that same philosophy with me to my coaching career.\"\n\nWilliam Chesley, President of the Pigskin Club of Washington, who succeeded AB after he recently stepped down:\n\n\"The Pigskin is indebted to AB for his work with the organization. Because of him, his vision and dedication were able to add a variety of sports where we rewarded young student-athletes. The Pigskin Club is a better place because of his vision.\"\n\nAlois \"Ricky\" Clemons, former Sports Information Director at Howard during the 1970's and early 1980's and currently a professor at Howard:\n\n\"AB Williamson helped put Howard basketball on the map with his accomplishments. By taking the program to the NCAA Tournament and recruiting a group of players that made up what we called the 'Dunk Patrol' is something that will live on in the history of Howard Athletics.\"\n\nLamont Fain, former team manager and current senior director of the NBA:\n\n\"AB gave me my first opportunity as manager of the Howard men's basketball team. I came in for an interview and he asked me a couple of questions and then asked me when I could start. From there, I became the team manager for four years at Howard. I am indebted to AB for my career journey.\"\n\nDeborah Johnson, member of the Howard faculty, a former assistant athletic director and current faculty athletic representative:\n\n\"One of the most rewarding things that I treasure as an administrator is the work that AB and I were able to collaborate on. When he was in the compliance department, we were able to produce the first student-athlete handbook.\"\n\nMike Jones, former player and current head coach at the UNC Greensboro:\n\n\"When you have a chance to be around people who are successful, it rubs off. I owe a lot of my success to AB and his leadership.\"\n\nEric Singletary, current head coach at Sidwell Friends High School, regarded as one of the top coaches in the country:\n\n\"I got a chance to meet AB Williamson last year at the Pigskin Club banquet. It was such an honor because he is a legend in D.C. basketball both at Eastern and Howard. I am so honored to have met him.\"\n\nJohn Spencer, former player and ESPN analyst and current CEO of 540 Sports Agency that represents athletes:\n\n\"Coming out of high school, I was recruited by several Power 5 schools but I wanted to attend an HBCU. AB and Cy Alexander developed a strong relationship with my family and I, learning a lot of lessons from him as a young man trying to figure things out. AB instilled confidence in me and always made me feel that he would take care of me. That is why I chose Howard. It was the best decision of my life.\"\n\nJeff Williams, former player and assistant coach under Williamson and currently assistant coach of the women's basketball team at East Carolina:\n\n\"There are things that I learned from AB that have helped me in my coaching career. The lessons that he taught on and off the court were instrumental in my career.\"\n\nLou Wilson, former player and assistant coach at Howard, who has compiled a record of close to 800 wins during his career as a high school coach:\n\n\"AB Williamson served as a role model for me on and off the court. I watched how he touched so many lives. I used that as an example when I got into coaching in high school. I have some of the techniques and philosophy.\"\n\nFor more information, visit the Bison Athletics website at www.HUBison.com."
