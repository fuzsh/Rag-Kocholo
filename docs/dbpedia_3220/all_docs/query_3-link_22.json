        "text": "National Historic Trail\n\nCaptain John Smith Chesapeake\n\nVarious States VA,MD,DE,DC,PA,NY\n\nPeople first arrived in the Chesapeake Bay during the last ice age. As glaciers melted, diverse societies learned to thrive in a world of water. When Englishman Captain John Smith explored the Bay in 1608, he documented hundreds of American Indian communities. Today, sites on his map are archeological treasures and sacred sites for tribal citizens. Come join us on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay!\n\nChesapeake Bay\n\nChesapeake Bay Watershed, DC,DE,MD,NY,PA,VA,WV\n\nOver 41 million acres are connected through the waters that flow to and through Chesapeake Bay. The National Park Service strives to connect people to the opportunities and adventures throughout the watershed. Inspiring stewardship across this vast region supports recreation, business, tourism, learning, and a thriving natural resource for all to enjoy.\n\nNational Historical Park\n\nFirst State\n\nDE,PA\n\nFamous as the First State to ratify the Constitution, Delaware was born out of a conflict among three world powers for dominance of the Delaware Valley. From this beginning, the region developed a distinct character that tolerated diversity in religion and national origin and valued independence.\n\nNational Historic Trail\n\nWashington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route\n\nMA,RI,CT,NY,NJ,PA,DE,MD,VA,DC\n\nIn 1781, General Rochambeau’s French Army joined forces with General Washington’s Continental Army to fight the British Army in Yorktown, Virginia. With the French Navy in support, the allied armies moved hundreds of miles to become the largest troop movement of the American Revolution. The effort and cooperation between the two sides led to a victory at Yorktown and secured American independence."
