        "text": "Introduction\n\nOn December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first of the 13 original colonies to ratify the federal Constitution. Since that historic event, Delaware has been known as “The First State” of the Union. Delaware is bounded by Pennsylvania and Maryland. To the east, across the Delaware River and Delaware Bay, sits New Jersey. The First State’s closeness to the large markets in the eastern United States, as well as its good transportation facilities, moderate climate, and well-watered, sandy soil, make it an important agricultural state. While agriculture is based mainly in the middle and southern areas of the state, the northern section is known for its commercial and financial businesses. Dover, Delaware’s capital, is located in the center of the state.\n\nBesides Delaware’s official nickname as the First State, it also has been referred to by several other interesting names. When Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, called Delaware a “jewel among the states,” he might have been paying tribute to the brilliance of its statesmen in the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention. Some historians believe that Jefferson’s description referred to the compact area and rich soil of the so-called Diamond State. A more likely origin of this popular nickname comes from a line attributed to John Lofland, known as the Milford Bard, in 1847. A romantic storyteller and eccentric, Lofland wrote, “Delaware is like a diamond, diminutive, but having within it inherent value.”\n\nAnother nickname for Delaware is the Blue Hen State, for the pet gamecocks carried as mascots by a Delaware regiment during the American Revolution. The strain was developed from a Kent county blue hen celebrated for its fighting ability. The University of Delaware’s nickname for its athletic teams is the Fightin’ Blue Hens. Delaware is sometimes called the Peach State for the fruit that was an important crop in the 1800s. The peach blossom was adopted as the state flower in 1895.\n\nIn 1609 Henry Hudson, an explorer for the Dutch East India Company, reached a point at the entrance of what is now Delaware Bay, but he found the waters too shallow for exploration. When Captain Samuel Argall of the Virginia colony saw the bay in 1610, he named it after his colonial governor Sir Thomas West, Baron De La Warr. Later the river and the land along its western shore were also called Delaware.\n\nThe extreme northern part of Delaware is in the Piedmont region, from which short, swift streams tumble to lower levels. Flour mills were built on the Brandywine and other streams when the state was first settled. Paper mills were built as early as 1787, and the first cotton mill was established in 1795. Abundant waterpower and easy access to the Delaware River and Delaware Bay helped make Wilmington a manufacturing center and seaport. Leathermaking became a leading industry for the city in 1732, when the Quakers began preparing buckskin and chamois there. The city also developed into the state’s financial and commercial hub.\n\nWhile Delaware’s research laboratories have created many of the synthetic fibers and fabrics that have revolutionized modern living, the state still cherishes the beautiful things that have been preserved from its past. In Wilmington in 1802—two years after the remarkable Du Pont family emigrated from France to the United States—Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours founded the great company whose slogan is “Better things for better living through chemistry.” In no other state of the Union has one family been so closely identified with economic development, political fortunes, and social life as have the Du Ponts of Delaware.\n\nThe state has carefully preserved some stately old houses and public buildings. Special events such as Old Dover Days and A Day in Old New Castle are celebrated with 18th-century music and dances. Many private homes are open to the public on these occasions, and collections of antiques, paintings, and old documents are also on display. Far from living in the past, however, the First State continues to grow in economic productivity and population. Area 2,489 square miles (6,446 square kilometers). Population (2020) 989,948.\n\nSurvey of the First State\n\nOne of the Middle Atlantic states, Delaware is on the East Coast of the United States, about midway between Maine and Florida. Its greatest length, north to south, is 96 miles (154 kilometers). Its greatest width, east to west, is 35 miles (56 kilometers). Delaware is the 49th state in size. Only Rhode Island is smaller.\n\nThe state is bounded on the east by water—the Atlantic Ocean and the river and bay that separate it from New Jersey’s shore. To the south and west is Maryland. Delaware’s northern boundary curves into Pennsylvania. This boundary was set in a land grant made to William Penn by the duke of York in 1682.\n\nMost of Delaware lies on the Delmarva Peninsula, which also includes parts of Maryland and Virginia. Delaware has only three counties: New Castle, Kent, and Sussex. The counties are divided into “hundreds” rather than townships. An early form of political division, some hundreds date back to the late 1600s. Delaware is the only state to retain this old English method, although today the divisions have no political bearing and are used only as locators.\n\nNatural Regions\n\nDelaware is located mainly within the Coastal Plain province of the extensive Atlantic Plain region, which runs from Rhode Island down to Florida and then west through the eastern half of Texas. The plain is a region of sandy soil that makes good farmland. Altitudes are low, ranging from sea level to 60 feet (18 meters). Delaware is second only to Florida for having the lowest average elevation.\n\nThe only part of the state that lies outside the Atlantic Plain is the northern tip, which is considered part of the Appalachian Highlands. This northern section, also known as the Piedmont region, begins at the Christina River and runs northward into the foothills of southeastern Pennsylvania. Erosion is a great problem in the Piedmont region. East of Centerville near the Pennsylvania state line is Ebright Road, at 448 feet (137 meters), the highest point in the state.\n\nRivers\n\nThe watershed in Delaware begins in the north as a low ridge along the western boundary and turns southeast below the center of the state. The Appoquinimink, Smyrna, St. Jones, and Mispillion rivers empty into the Delaware River or Delaware Bay. The Nanticoke River empties southwestward into Chesapeake Bay. In the southeast are Rehoboth and Indian River bays, shallow lagoons behind narrow sandy coastal barriers.\n\nClimate\n\nDelaware’s climate is humid and temperate. The average daily temperature in northern Delaware is 54 °F (12 °C). In the north winter temperatures vary from a low of 23 °F (–5 °C) in January to a high of 86 °F (30 °C) in July. Temperatures in southern Delaware usually run about two degrees higher than these figures. The record low is –17 °F (– 27 ° C); the record high, 110 °F (43 °C). Both records were established at Millsboro in the southeast.\n\nAugust is generally the rainiest month, with an average precipitation of about 5.5 inches (14 centimeters). February typically has the least precipitation, with an average of about 3 inches (7.5 centimeters). The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches (114 centimeters).\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nDelaware is a transition zone between plants typical of Pennsylvania and New York and those common to coastal Maryland and Virginia. Pine, gum, oak, hickory, walnut, beech, maple, ash, and cedar are Delaware’s native tree species. Deer, foxes, raccoons, opossums, and muskrats are common. Beaches and marshes are a winter refuge for many wildfowl, as well as a stop on the migratory paths of such birds as sandpipers.\n\nThe forestry section of the Delaware Department of Agriculture, created with the help of Coleman du Pont in 1927, supervises three state forests: Redden, Blackbird, and Taber. The Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife supervises 19 public wildlife areas covering more than 62,000 acres (25,000 hectares). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service maintains the 16,251-acre (6,576-hectare) Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge along the coast.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nAlthough Delaware is one of the least populous states, it is one of the most densely populated because of its small size. At the time of the 2020 census non-Hispanic whites made up about 59 percent of the population. African Americans accounted for about 22 percent of the total. Almost 11 percent of Delaware’s residents identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin. Asian Americans made up about 4 percent of the population. Delaware’s small Native American population includes two state-recognized tribes—the Lenape Indian Tribe of Delaware and the Nanticoke Indian Tribe. The Lenape are based in Kent county, and the Nanticoke live in the Millsboro area of Sussex county.\n\nCities\n\nThe largest city in Delaware is Wilmington, with a population of about 70,000. A mill town since colonial days, Wilmington found wealth in its flour and paper mills. In the early 1800s the Du Pont family established a gunpowder mill, the forerunner of the modern gigantic and diversified DuPont Company with its experimental laboratories in Wilmington. The city has been a world leader in the production of plastic materials, synthetic fibers, dyes, paints, and varnishes. Today the city is the state’s industrial, financial, and commercial center and main port. Because of Delaware’s favorable corporation laws, many nationally known businesses have incorporated in Delaware and maintain offices in Wilmington.\n\nDover, the second city in size, has been the state capital since 1777. Newark is the home of the University of Delaware. Rehoboth Beach is often called the country’s summer capital because many Washington, D.C., government officials commute there for summer vacations.\n\nEducation\n\nThe first teachers in the Dutch and Swedish colonies of the 1600s were mainly clergymen. The first school buildings were churches. The state constitution of 1792 provided for the establishment of public schools.\n\nPublic schools in modern-day Delaware are overseen by the State Board of Education. Its members are appointed by the governor and approved by the Senate. The board provides the secretary of education with advice and guidance concerning the development of education policy. It also must resolve disputes involving the administration of the public school system. School costs are paid primarily out of the state general fund, but some revenue comes from taxes collected by the school districts.\n\nThe state supports a few institutions of higher education. The University of Delaware, in Newark, was founded in 1743 and is the major university. Delaware State University, a historically Black institution founded in 1891, is located in Dover. Delaware Technical and Community College, founded by the state in 1967, maintains campuses in all three counties. Private colleges include Wilmington College and Goldey-Beacom College, both located in Wilmington, and Wesley College, in Dover.\n\nSports and Recreation\n\nDelaware’s mild climate, aided by a long shoreline, invites outdoor activities for much of the year. Rehoboth, Bethany, and Woodland beaches are popular seaside resorts. Many inland lakes offer fishing and swimming. The Division of Parks and Recreation supervises Delaware’s many state parks, including the Delaware Seashore, on the Atlantic Ocean; Trap Pond, near Laurel; Cape Henlopen, near Lewes; Killens Pond, near Felton; Brandywine Creek and Bellevue, both near Wilmington; Lums Pond, near Kirkwood; Fort Delaware, on Pea Patch Island; and Holts Landing, on Indian River Bay. The weeklong Delaware State Fair is held annually in Harrington.\n\nArts and Cultural Sites\n\nWilmington is the cultural center of Delaware. The city is home to the professional Opera Delaware, Delaware Symphony Orchestra, First State Ballet Theatre, and Delaware Theatre Company. Museums abound in the area. The Delaware Art Museum boasts a collection that includes British Pre-Raphaelite art and American illustration. The museum was founded in 1912 by the family, friends, and students of Delaware artist Howard Pyle. They wanted to honor his memory and work after his sudden death. The Hagley Museum and Library portrays the development of American manufacturing through the preservation of early mills and other structures of the DuPont Company, as well as by indoor exhibits. The Delaware Museum of Natural History allows visitors to explore the natural world with exhibits and hands-on science activities. It is known for its collections of seashells, birds, and bird eggs.\n\nThe Zwaanendael Museum, in Lewes, was dedicated in 1931 to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the first European settlement in Delaware. The Dutch named the colony Swanendael, also spelled Zwaanendael, which means “Valley of the Swans.” The museum is modeled after the town hall in Hoorn, Netherlands.\n\nIn Winterthur, just outside Wilmington, is the Winterthur Museum, Garden, and Library. The museum is housed in a historic 175-room Du Pont mansion. The collection consists of more than 90,000 items of ceramics, glass, metalwork, textiles and needlework, and other American decorative arts. These pieces date from 1630 to 1860 and are displayed in authentic period rooms. The 60-acre garden that surrounds the property is treated as a cultural artifact. It is filled with plants, decorative artwork, and architecture that are managed as a collection.\n\nNew Castle is rich in historic interest. Its village green was laid out under the direction of Peter Stuyvesant during the period of Dutch rule. Colonial landmarks include the Immanuel Church, the Old Dutch House, the Old Court House, and several other 18th-century buildings. Built about 1730, the Amstel House serves as the headquarters and is one of the several museums of the New Castle Historical Society. There are many fine private homes, some of which are open to the public during the annual event in May called A Day in Old New Castle.\n\nDover also has many fine old homes. Some of them circle the Green, which was laid out in 1717. The town’s Biggs Museum of American Art exhibits American fine and decorative arts from 1700 to the present.\n\nThe village of Arden is an artist colony. It was founded in 1900 by an architect and a sculptor who wanted to create a utopian community. Arden has been home to many artists and has a strong theatrical tradition, with regular performances of Shakespeare and Gilbert and Sullivan. The entire village is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn Wilmington regular services are still held at the Old Swedes (Holy Trinity) Church, built in 1698–99. Fort Christina Monument is another major Wilmington attraction. The first permanent European settlement in Delaware was established here by Peter Minuit in 1638. These sites, along with several others in New Castle, Dover, and other parts of the state, make up First State National Historical Park.\n\nFor brief biographies of some notable people of Delaware, click here.\n\nGovernment\n\nBefore Dover became Delaware’s state capital in 1777, the capital was New Castle. Dover’s historic State House, which is now a museum, was built between 1787 and 1791. The seat of government was transferred to Legislative Hall, the new capitol, in 1933.\n\nThe General Assembly is the lawmaking body. It consists of the Senate, with 21 members, and the House of Representatives, with 41 members. The governor is elected for a four-year term and may serve only two terms. The secretary of state is appointed by the governor.\n\nDelaware has had four constitutions, the last one adopted in 1897. The present constitution’s bill of rights guarantees freedom of religion, the right of free elections, freedom from improper arrest, and the right of fair trial. Delaware is the only state in which constitutional amendments do not have to be approved by the voters. They become law after they pass both houses of the General Assembly by a two-thirds vote of the elected members at two successive sessions.\n\nThe state’s judicial system is headed by the Supreme Court. There are also chancery, superior, and common pleas courts. The chancery court is unique in that it was specifically established to judge on internal disputes concerning corporations in Delaware.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first people in the state were Native Americans whom Europeans later named the Delaware. They called themselves the Lenni-Lenape, meaning “original people.” About 8,000 Lenni-Lenape lived in the area that became Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Like many other Northeast Indians, they spoke an Algonquian language. A branch of the Lenni-Lenape, the Nanticoke, lived in what is now southern Delaware and on the eastern shore of Maryland. With the coming of the Europeans, many Native Americans died of disease or were driven westward.\n\nColonial Days\n\nEuropean knowledge of Delaware began in 1609 when Henry Hudson, in search of a northwest passage to the East Indies, sailed by what is now Cape Henlopen on Delaware Bay. Because the bay seemed too shallow, he continued sailing up the Atlantic Coast. One year later Samuel Argall sailed north from Jamestown, Virginia, into the bay and named the area.\n\nFor the next few years Dutch captains explored the Delaware waters. The Dutch West India Company gave some goods, such as beads and cloth, to the Native Americans in the area in exchange for land in 1630. The company planned to establish a farming and whaling community. The next year the Zwaanendael colony was started by a small group of Dutch who settled on Blommaert’s Kill (now Lewes). The settlement was raided and destroyed by Native Americans after a disagreement between the two groups.\n\nSome Dutch withdrew their support from the Dutch West India Company and offered it to Sweden. With their help a Swedish colony was set up in 1638 at present-day Wilmington. This first permanent European settlement in Delaware was called Fort Christina, and the area was called New Sweden. Although the Swedes had many setbacks, they generally prospered.\n\nIn 1655 the Dutch captured Fort Christina, and the Swedes were forced to give up New Sweden. The Dutch did not stay in power long, however. In 1664 the English seized all the Dutch territory in America. Delaware became part of the province granted to the duke of York by his brother, King Charles II. Marcus Jacobsen led some Swedes in a revolt, which was put down, and then the Dutch regained control for a year.\n\nThe colony reverted to English hands in 1674. In 1682 the duke of York gave Delaware, then called the Three Lower Counties, to William Penn, and the land became part of Pennsylvania Province. The Delaware counties formed their own assembly in 1704 but remained under the rule of the Pennsylvania governor.\n\nDuring Penn’s governorship, members of the Society of Friends (Quakers) came to northern Delaware because it was close to Philadelphia and offered good farmland. Quaker merchants established the town of Wilmington in 1739. Another group of newcomers were the Scots-Irish, who brought with them their Presbyterian religion and an emphasis on education. In 1743 Francis Alison, a Presbyterian minister, established a school that became the foundation for the later University of Delaware.\n\nSouthern Delaware was populated largely by English settlers, many coming from nearby Maryland, and by Africans, who were brought in and enslaved to clear the land and work the farms. Toward the end of the 18th century, Methodist preachers found many converts among both Black and white residents of southern Delaware.\n\nStatehood and Economic Development\n\nDelaware shared in the tension preceding the American Revolution by refusing to obey the Stamp Act in 1765. When the Continental Congress met to vote on the Declaration of Independence, the Delaware delegates were tied. Caesar Rodney rode from Dover to Philadelphia on July 1, 1776, to break the tie and vote for independence. Delaware adopted its first constitution on September 21, 1776. On December 7, 1787, it became the first state to ratify the federal Constitution.\n\nIn 1802 Frenchman Éleuthère Irénée du Pont settled on the Brandywine Creek and established the country’s largest black powder factory. As his gunpowder business expanded and diversified into one of the richest manufacturing companies in the world, he set the pattern for the state’s enduring prosperity. In the following years one of the many useful inventions developed under Du Pont sponsorship was nylon. Oliver Evans of Newport, called the first great American inventor, devised many machines, including the first high-pressure steam engine, and created the first continuous production line. Textiles, tobacco, and the first continuous-roll paper mill in the country were also established in Delaware.\n\nWilmington’s merchants and millers encouraged improvements in transportation. Roads were built to connect Wilmington with remote areas, and a railroad connecting the city with Baltimore, Maryland, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was established in 1838. The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal gave farmers and merchants another way to transport their products to new markets. It was completed in 1829. The Delaware Railroad connected Wilmington to Seaford in western Sussex county by 1856. Steamboats on the Delaware River encouraged development of the state’s agriculture, especially the growing of peaches for urban markets.\n\nSteam-powered transportation also provided the key to Wilmington’s rapid industrialization in the mid-19th century. The city grew from about 5,500 people in 1840 to some 77,000 by 1900 and attracted immigrants from Ireland, England, and Germany. Its industries included the manufacture of railroad cars, steamboats, leather, and carriages.\n\nSlavery, the Civil War, and Reconstruction\n\nThroughout the first half of the 19th century, the people of Delaware became increasingly divided over the issue of slavery. Delaware was a border state between North and South. For both economic and religious reasons, many slaveholders freed their captives during this period, but a few stubbornly refused. Some residents helped enslaved people escape along the Underground Railroad, while others captured free Blacks to be shipped southward into slavery. In 1860, on the eve of the American Civil War, the number of enslaved people in Delaware had been reduced to about 1,800. The number of the state’s free Blacks had grown to some 20,000.\n\nDelaware never seriously considered joining the Confederacy. Many residents favored the Union cause, though men from the state served in the armies of both sides. Fort Delaware, built on a small island in the Delaware River to protect Wilmington and Philadelphia in the 1850s, became one of the Union’s major prisoner-of-war camps.\n\nRace relations continued to be a source of controversy in Delaware society and politics after the war. Since 1829 the state had supported public education, but its schools were open to whites only. During the Reconstruction period (1865–77) that followed the Civil War, schools for African Americans were introduced throughout the state. Democrats, who controlled the state government at the time, were hostile to granting equality to Blacks. They pushed through a state poll tax, which reduced the participation of Blacks in government. The Democrats lost their dominance in state politics in the 1890s, when Republican groups began giving out money to secure voter support and Blacks were admitted to the polls. However, segregation in education, housing, and public accommodations remained the norm in Delaware until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1954 (see Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka).\n\nDelaware in the 20th and 21st Centuries\n\nIn the early 20th century the Du Pont family and their gunpowder company dominated Delaware’s development. The DuPont Company, the country’s largest producer of explosives, earned huge profits through its sales to both the United States and its allies during World War I.\n\nSeveral Du Ponts used their wealth to benefit the state. T. Coleman du Pont, an engineer and early automobile enthusiast, built the Du Pont Highway to connect southern Delaware to Wilmington. It was completed in 1923. His cousin Pierre S. du Pont organized citizen support to improve public education and, during the 1920s, paid for the construction of new schools throughout the state. Alfred I. du Pont, another cousin, introduced old-age pensions and built a state welfare home in 1930.\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, Delaware changed significantly. Population flowed from Wilmington to its suburbs. Resort and retirement communities developed along the Atlantic Coast in the southeastern portion of the state. The state’s economy continued to thrive as it made a business of incorporating companies. Wilmington, Delaware’s financial center, gained a modern skyline of new banking facilities. Major companies continue to flock to Delaware to take advantage of its favorable laws and its moderate tax policies. (See also United States, “Middle Atlantic Region.”)"
