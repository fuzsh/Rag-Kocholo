WILLIAM ALLEN, the thirty-first governor of Ohio, was born in Edenton, North Carolina in 1803. His education was attained at the Chillicothe Academy in Ohio. He went on to study law, and then established his legal career in Chillicothe. Allen first entered politics as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, a position he won election to in 1834. He also served as a member of the U.S. Senate from 1837 to 1849. He next secured the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, and was elected governor by a popular vote in the 1873 general election. During his tenure, the tax levy was reduced; state spending was cut; and a railroad and coal strike were both successfully dealt with. After running unsuccessfully for reelection, Allen retired from political life. He continued to stay active in his farming and legal interests. Governor William Allen passed away on July 11, 1879 and was buried in the Grand View Cemetery in Chillicothe, Ohio.
