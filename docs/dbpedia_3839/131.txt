Experience the northwoods at remote Isle Royale National Park, located in northwestern Lake Superior. One of the least visited National Parks, Isle Royale is accessible only by boat or seaplane. The Park is home to moose, wolves, loons, beaver, fox, and other small mammals and birdlife. Lake Superior and the island's inland lakes offer excellent fishing and photographic sites for viewing prestine forest and waterways. Diving opportunities abound to many shipwrecks of Lake Superior.
