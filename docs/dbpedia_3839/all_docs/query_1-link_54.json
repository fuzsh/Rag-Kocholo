Nitrox, trimix and airfills are available on the boat.  Drysuits & pony bottles are highly recommended, but not required. Here is our trip itinerary.. Aug 10th...travel up to Grand Portage, MN.  Pack our gear onboard, sleep on the boat. Aug 11th depart for Isle Royale.  Aug 11-14 we will be diving multiple times per day (weather permitting), all our meals will be included, and air fills are included.  Aug 15th we will diving in the morning (weather permitting), and then depart from Isle Royale, and head back to Grand Portage, MN.  Weather permitting, we will arrive back in Grand Portage in the mid-afternoon.  Divers can choose to drive straight home, or we suggest getting a hotel in the Duluth/Superior area in order to rest up (and shower up) before your long drive home. (hotel stay not included)   $1300 per diver.  Nitrox is available, but must be prepaid ($100).  Trimix is also available.    A $500 non-refundable deposit will secure your spot on this fabulous trip!  Final payment will be due in 2023.  There are only 5 spots on this trip, so you definitely do NOT want to procrastinate!  Sign up online NOW, or stop by the store, or call us TODAY!  262-251-8283",
