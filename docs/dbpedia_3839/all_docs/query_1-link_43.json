Roosevelt. The park was designated part of the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1976, under the Wilderness Act, and remains today as an example of primitive America. In fact, over 98% of the land in Isle Royale is designated wilderness. Further honors were bestowed in 1981, when Isle Royale was designated an International Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations, giving it global scientific and educational significance.\n\nIsle Royale National Park is located in Lake Superior, about 17 miles southeast of Grand Portage, Minnesota and about 45 miles north of Copper Harbor, Michigan.\n\nSize and Visitation of Isle Royale National Park\n\nThe total park acreage is 571,790.11, of which 539,281.87 is federal and 32,508.24 nonfederal. Land area is 133,781.87; wilderness is designated in 132,018 of the land-based acres.\n\nTotal Recreation Visits for 1999 were 23,493\n\nIsland History\n\nIsle Royale exists as an island in many ways. It is an island of wilderness and home to wolves in a modern world. It is an island in time, a natural space in which you operate on natural time and experience the rhythms of light and dark. Days are measured by footsteps, possibly under a backpack. Walking the island you are struck by its striated layout, its elongated forested-rock and lake patterns that parallel its backbone, the Greenstone Ridge. The island, it seems, must have been forcibly combed from northeast to southwest. The surface scene you see from the island’s heights is the product of 10,000 years of natural sculpting, soil-building, and plant- pioneering and succession. Back then – actually not long ago by nature’s time scale – the island appeared beneath glacial ice, rising as the lake level dropped. The island developed soil and was colonized by plants and animals. Its many inland lakes first formed in basins gouged out by glaciers and then began to shrink, as lakes and ponds inevitably do.\n\nThe People at Isle Royale\n\nLong before Europeans saw Isle Royale, American Indians mined copper her. Using hand-held beach cobbles they hammered out chunks of pure copper from the hard bedrock. Archeologists have excavated shallow mining pits, some dating back 4,500 years. The French claimed the island in 1671. In 1783, it became a US possession; it was defined as Chippewa Territory until 1843. Modern copper mining took place off and on from the mid-1800’s until 1899. During that era large areas were burned, the forest was logged, and settlements developed. The 1700’s saw the advent of commercial fishing. The American Fur company used the ancient method of gill netting to take whitefish, lake trout, and siskiwit. This tradition has been handed down through the fishermen’s families. Early this century Isle Royale became popular for summer homes, excursions, and as a wilderness retreat. Detroit journalist Albert Stoll sparked the fight for the national park, which was established in 1940.\n\nVisitors Guide\n\nAccessibility\n\nIsle Royale is largely a wilderness area. When planning a visit, recognize the wilderness mandate of the park and that there are topographic, vegetative, and physical obstacles that might require you to have assistance. The park is perhaps ideal for the adept mobility impaired person that can experience the wilderness resource via canoe or sea kayak. For a free brochure on accessible facilities and services that the park offers, contact the park at 906-482-0984.\n\nBasic Visit Recommendations\n\nAny visit to Isle Royale will require substantial planning. Reservations need to be made on a passenger ferry or seaplane to reach and return from the island, or visitors will need to pilot their own boat to the island. Equipment selection will be determined by whether or not the tour will involve activities such as hiking, canoeing, kayaking, power boating, staying in a hotel, and other possibilities. Furthermore, if it does, and if you wish to drive to the national park by road, you may certainly carry your own kayak using the Kayak Roof Racks attached to the roof of your car (click here to check them out).\n\nBoating\n\nBoaters have been coming to Isle Royale to enjoy the clean clear waters, the protected harbors and bays, the dramatic shorelines, and the excellent fishing for more than 100 years. Many Isle Royale boaters make repeat trips to the island, and some can trace their island connections back for generations. Even first-time visitors can feel a keen appreciation for the resources and values of this one-of-a-kind maritime park.\n\nHiking Information\n\nIsle Royale National Park was authorized by Congress in 1931 “to conserve a prime example of North Woods Wilderness.” The park was designated part of the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1976, under the Wilderness Act, and remains today as an example of primitive America. In fact, over 98% of the land in Isle Royale is designated wilderness. Further honors were bestowed in 1981, when Isle Royale was designated an International Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations, giving it global scientific and educational significance.\n\nWilderness is managed for preservation and solitude. We need such natural places for study, measuring the forces of natural change and dynamics, and as a place to renew the human spirit. Isle Royale has established rules and regulations governing group size, fires, sanitation, and basic conduct to help protect its varied resources as well as the quality of experience for users. Help preserve wilderness by following these guidelines.\n\nFees\n\nFee Changes for 2024\n\nThe park charges a $7 per person daily entrance fee.

Boaters may purchase the $60 Isle Royale Season Pass instead.\n\nAll Federal Recreation Passes (Annual, Military, Senior, Access, and Volunteer) are now honored. Entrance fees will be waived for the pass holder and up to 3 adults traveling with the pass holder (4 total).\n\nChildren 15 and under are exempt from the daily entrance fee.\n\nEntrance fee\n\nThe entrance fee for Isle Royale National Park applies to all park visitors, except for children 15 and under.
