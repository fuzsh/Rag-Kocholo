        "text": "I have written about Isle Royale in various forms, but I realized I have never really introduced readers to the island itself, or at least not very well. So I’d like you to meet the island.\n\nIsle Royale is a United States national park in northwestern Lake Superior (www.nps.gov/isro). The lake is the largest body of freshwater in the world (in surface area; the largest by volume is Lake Baikal in Russia). Isle Royale is, as some like to say, the largest island in the largest lake.\n\nIsle Royale is formally part of the State of Michigan, despite its location more than 60 miles from the nearest part of that state. It is just 15-20 miles from Ontario and Minnesota on the north shore of Lake Superior.\n\nIsle Royale was established by the U.S. Congress as a national park in 1937, but because of World War II was not formally dedicated until 1946. The island is 210 square miles in area, and in 1976, 99% of its landmass was further protected as wilderness under the Wilderness Act of 1964. The park boundary extends out 4 miles into Lake Superior.\n\nVisitors reach the island by boat or floatplane. Two commercial ferries transport visitors daily from Grand Portage, Minnesota, or Copper Harbor, Michigan. A government ferry carries passengers two days a week from the park’s mainland headquarters in Houghton, Michigan. A seaplane service is also available in Houghton. Once on the island, visitors get around boat (motor, sail, canoe, kayak) or on foot.\n\nIsle Royale receives far fewer visitors in a year than most other parks (16,663 in 2012, the most recent year for which data are available), but the average time spent in the park is one of the highest in the National Park System (average of 4 days). Isle Royale is also one of the few, if not the only, parks to close in the winter. The park is open from 16 April until about 1 November. This is mostly because of the difficulty involved in accessing the park.\n\nWinter Study, which I have been writing about recently, is the annual survey of moose and wolves made by scientists from Michigan Technological University. It is a rare thing to be invited to the island in winter to assist with this project, so I was thrilled to be asked. I have provided links to the moose-wolf study in previous posts and to the blog of fellow scientists, Ky and Lisa Koitszch. To get a sense of what Winter Study is like, and what we are learning from this 56-year research project, consider purchasing the film Fortunate Wilderness by documentary filmmaker George Desort (www.fortunatewilderness.com/). To see the island in summer, check out his second film, Fifty Lakes One Island, in which he solo paddles all fifty of the island’s named lakes (www.fiftylakesoneisland.com/). You can also find clips on George’s Facebook page and on his Vimeo page (http://vimeo.com/user1556409). George and I were on the island together these past two weeks, and he is working on third Isle Royale film just about Winter Study and the issues being faced with a declining wolf population. Watch for news of that film’s release in the future!\n\nThere is so much to talk and learn about the island, I can’t possibly put it all in here. The island experience is individual and personal. If you have a chance to visit, take it. If not, visit it through George’s films. It is a special place."
