        "text": "A Wild, Isolated Island\n\nIsle Royale National Park is a rich historical location, settled by native American copper miners long before the days of Christopher Columbus. In the late 1800's, it became the home of numerous commercial fishing families, many of whom were Scandinavian and German immigrants.\n\nIsle Royale National Park, extending over 50 miles, is the \"eye\" of Lake Superior. The main island is 45 miles long and 8 miles wide, covering over 571,790 acres, most of which is back country wilderness. Isle Royale National Park was authorized in 1931, and in 1980 was designated a biosphere reserve. It is currently home to an amazing abundance of wildlife, including wolves, moose, fox, beaver, gulls, cormorants, loons, ducks, otters, eagles and rare plants.\n\nA Northland Family Legacy\n\nGrand Portage Isle Royale Transportation Lines began as a way for the Sivertson family of Lake Superior's north shore to transport their catch of freshwater fish from Isle Royale to Minnesota. It gradually expanded to include passenger service.\n\nToday, \"GPIR\" provides transportation for adventurers who wish to camp, hike, canoe or kayak throughout the park, as well as those who only wish to enjoy the park's natural beauty and history for the day.\n\nOur Boats\n\nBoth of our vessels are US Coast Guard inspected annually and are equipped with automatically inflating life rafts and life vests. They are manned by USCG licensed captains and trained crew and have modern electronics with GPS, sonar, and radar. We also have AEDs onboard and our crew members are CPR certified.\n\nVoyageur II\n\nThe Voyageur II is a 65' aluminum passenger vessel powered by twin Detroit diesels. It was purpose built for service on the Great Lakes and combines U.S. Mail and passenger service to Isle Royale National Park, MI. The V2 travels clockwise around the park, staying overnight at Rock Harbor. This route offers visitors an opportunity to see the perimeter of the entire island and allows passenger drops at several trailheads and paddling embarkation points around Isle Royale. This 46 passenger capacity boat has booth seating in the cabin, outdoor seating on the bow and stern deck; and men's and women's restrooms; as well as private crew quarters."
