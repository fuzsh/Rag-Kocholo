        "text": "ISLE ROYALE, Mich. (WLUC) - UPDATE: Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard said divers found a 13-foot crack along the bottom of the Michipicoten.\n\n“Although a collision with a submerged object has not been ruled out, the current cause of the crack is expected to be fatigue or structural failure,” Lt. Joseph Snyder, U.S. Coast Guard, said.\n\nLt. Snyder said the U.S. Coast Guard continues to work closely with Transport Canada to investigate the cause of Saturday’s incident.\n\nHe added that a thorough understanding of the cause of the damage likely won’t occur until the vessel has unloaded cargo and been examined at a dry dock.\n\nLast published: Jun 10, 2024 8:43:00 PM\n\nThe 689-foot bulk carrier Michipicoten safely anchored in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Saturday afternoon after combating flooding in Lake Superior, earlier in the morning.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Sector Northern Great Lakes assisted the Canadian bulk carrier Michipicoten to anchorage in Thunder Bay, Ontario, after they initially reported taking on water at approximately 7:00 a.m.\n\nThe cause of the flooding is unknown at this time. The Coast Guard’s initial report said the freighter struck something in the lake.\n\nCoast Guard assets involved in the response include two helicopters from Air Station Traverse City and a response boat from Station Bayfield.\n\n“We were notified, as the trade association for the U.S. flagged fleet, that one of our vessels was assisting with the Canadian vessel that was taking on water at the time. It had been called by the Coast Guard to divert the Edwin H. Gott, which is a Great Lakes fleet vessel, who was in the area, diverted over to the Michipicoten, which had put in a mayday to the Coast Guard saying they were taking on water,” said Eric Peace, Lake Carriers’ Association Vice President.\n\nPeace says the efforts of the Edwin H. Gott’s captain and crew helped make sure the Michipicoten made to Thunder Bay safely without sinking.\n\n“That was a 1,000-foot ship that diverted off it’s track, went out there. Captain Kean Weekly of the Edwin H. Gott was there, and assisted, they provided a lee, meaning they blocked some of the waves while they launched rescue boats. 11 people were removed from the vessel, 11 remained on board but, 11 were removed just in case and we assisted with making sure that was safely done,” Peace said.\n\n“That was a 1,000-foot ship that diverted off it’s track, went out there.
