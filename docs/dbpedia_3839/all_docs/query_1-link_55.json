        "text": "Isle Royale National Park, located in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, has been awarded the best national park in the United States, surpassing destinations like Denali, Yellowstone, and Big Bend.\n\nThis accolade comes from the Wall Street Journal’s ranking system, which weighted crowd size (50%) alongside hiking, camping, and outdoor recreation opportunities.\n\nAccording to a report by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), while many people think of well-known national parks like Yellowstone, Zion, and Yosemite, their analysis revealed that Isle Royale came out on top.\n\nThis wooded archipelago near the northwestern edge of Lake Superior, rich with the drama of moose and wolves, was highlighted as the best according to their metrics. “This is true wilderness: A land of moose and wolves and the drama forever playing out between them,” WSJ indicated.\n\nIsle Royale’s remoteness is a key factor in its appeal. Located 55 miles from the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula, the park is only accessible by ferry or seaplane.\n\nThis isolation makes it one of the least visited national parks in the contiguous United States. In 2023, Isle Royale welcomed 28,000 visitors, a fraction of the crowds seen at more popular parks.\n\nAccording to an article published by M Live, the Wall Street Journal ranks the top national parks in the country as follows: Isle Royale National Park in Michigan, North Cascades National Park in Washington, Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks in California, Big Bend National Park in Texas, Denali National Park & Preserve in Alaska, and\n\nOther parks include Lassen Volcanic National Park in California. Great Basin National Park in Nevada, Death Valley National Park in California and Nevada, Guadalupe Mountains National Park in Texas, and Yellowstone National Park in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.\n\nAnother aspect of Isle Royale National Park is its outdoor recreation and wildlife. The park’s main island stretches 45 miles long and is surrounded by over 400 smaller islands, creating a unique archipelago ecosystem. Isle Royale is open from mid-April through the end of October, offering a short window for visitors to experience its rugged beauty.\n\nHikers can explore more than 165 miles of trails on Isle Royale, catering to various skill levels. The park offers a range of hiking opportunities, from short day hikes to challenging multi-day treks."
