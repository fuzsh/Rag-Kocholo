Isle Royale offers adventures for backpackers, hikers, boaters, paddlers, and divers. Cross Lake Superior and make a commitment: Become a part of this island, and let it become a part of you. Find peace and refuge in island wilderness â€“ because Isle Royale, in turn, finds refuge in us. Help Isle Royale stay wild."
