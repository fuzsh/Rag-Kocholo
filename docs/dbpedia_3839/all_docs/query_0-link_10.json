        "text": "The island offers incredible hiking, fishing, camping, and paddling opportunities to its visitors. And because of its almost complete absence of light pollution, the park makes for one of the best locations to observe the majestic aurora borealis (Northern Lights) and truly dark skies.\n\nNo other national park offers such an intimate experience with the outdoors. Because of the 45-mile long island’s remoteness, visitors are more likely to run into local wildlife than other humans while trekking across the park’s extensive trail system. The park is best known for the local moose and gray wolf populations, but visitors may also stumble upon other small mammals like beavers, red foxes, snowshoe hare, minks, and river otters. The haunting call of loons, which nest along the shorelines, is one of the most memorable experiences.\n\nHOW DO I VISIT ISLE ROYALE NATIONAL PARK?"
