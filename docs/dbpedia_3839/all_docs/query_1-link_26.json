        "text": "With the men's Final Four set for college basketball, I'm rooting for Michigan State.\n\nYou're right, I couldn't name the Spartans coach or top player, but I know Michigan has some country I like more than the other states with finalists: Wisconsin, North Carolina (Duke) and Kentucky.\n\nOf those four, Michigan is the only one I would fly to with a backpack in my suitcase. In fact, I've done it twice: to Isle Royale National Park (described here), and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (to be described on the website tomorrow). I plan to do it again in September, to Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.\n\nWhy go here: Isle Royale is 50 miles out in Lake Superior from anything else in Michigan, though it is closer to Ontario and Minnesota. I had planned to take the passenger ferry to the island's west end, hike 40 miles across it, then ride the same ferry back to Minnesota when it made its one weekly stop on the east end.\n\nTrouble is, even in sunny September weather, a gale was blowing out in Lake Superior and the captain decided to turn the boat around. That made a lot of passengers really happy.\n\nI wound up driving to Copper Harbor, Mich., for a boat ride from the south. It also meant I didn't have to walk across the island, but to only find a camp to do day hikes. (A link to a story about my visit to Isle Royale.)\n\nTent spots: Tent spots? you don't need one on Isle Royale. I grabbed an Adirondack-style camping cabin for free upon arrival at Rock Harbor the first night, then did the same at Daisy Farm for the next three nights.\n\nMaps, routes: National Geographic publishes a plastic map of Isle Royale, while the Mountaineers Books of Seattle has a hiking guide, \"Isle Royale National Park.\" Isle Royale is the largest island in the largest freshwater lake in the world. It is all national park and has no private vehicles, other than a truck or two for the concessionaire, plus boats and float planes. It's certainly an experience to travel to, or root for, Michigan.\n\nInfo: Isle Royale National Park, 906-482-0984, nps.gov/isro/.\n\nMore backpack trips: My list of top 10 backpacks to plan for this summer\n\nEnchantment Basin in Alpine Lakes Wilderness, No. 2 on backpacks to do this summer\n\nCusick Mountain in Wallowas, No. 3 on backpacks to do this summer\n\nTenderfoot Trail, Wallowa Mountains, No. 5 on backpacks to do this summer\n\nLoowit Trail on Mount St. Helens, No. 7 on backpacks to do this summer\n\nSteens Mountain in southeast Oregon, No. 8 on backpacks to do this summer\n\nRuth Mountain in Washington's North Cascades, No. 9 on backpacks to do this summer\n\nPreston Peak in California Siskiyous, No. 10 on backpacks to do this summer\n\nWallowas' Lostine Trail in northeast Oregon: best backpacks for 2015\n\n(I am working to finish the list _ the writing part that is, the backpacking is done.)"
