        "text": "With a dramatic history involving an epic battle between fire and ice, Lake Superior came into existence over a billion years ago. Ultimately, the intense tug-of-war between volcanoes and glaciers eventually saw the Earth’s crust pull apart, causing land to collapse under the pressure of colossal molten basalt rock layers and form the sunken basin that would become Lake Superior. Learn more about the area’s Geoheritage & Geology.\n\nWith such an intense history, it is little wonder why Mother Superior can be a bit “moody.” Have you ever heard the saying: “If you don’t like the weather, wait a minute?” Each day – or sometimes hour – the Lake’s status can shift and bring a different “mood” to the Harbor. Some fantastic storms coming off the massive inland sea can bring about dazzling lightning shows, awesome cloud formations, blinding fog or gale force winds. Not surprisingly, about 350 Shipwrecks have been found in Lake Superior. Yet, strikingly beautiful rainbows and water-as-still-as-glass can follow in the wake of a storm – as if it never happened.\n\nStrategically located at the geographic center of this immense natural phenomenon, is Copper Harbor – Michigan’s northernmost town. Located on the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula, Copper Harbor’s climate is dictated by its location surrounded by Lake Superior.\n\nWith an average temperature of 36°F, the lake is responsible for the unique “microclimate” in Copper Harbor, in which winters are tempered and summers are cooled. Typically temperatures do not stay lower than 15 degrees for very long, and rarely do they go beyond the 70’s. With such idyllic seasons, not to mention the natural beauty of both the water and woods, Copper Harbor is the perfect playground for year-round recreation adventuring. What’s more, during the summer days are long, averaging nearly 16-hours of sunlight, which makes for an abundance of time to enjoy one’s vacation to the fullest.\n\nIf getting out on-the-water is on your vacation’s “to-do-list,” Copper Harbor is the place to be. Lake Superior’s average underwater visibility is nearly 30 feet, making it the cleanest and clearest of all the Great Lakes. Sea Kayaking & Canoeing, Boating, Fishing & Ice Fishing, scuba diving, swimming and even surfing on big wind days are all popular activities.\n\nAnd if sticking to the shore, out-of-the-water is more up your alley, there’s still plenty Lake Superior provides – Rock Hounding, Hiking & Walking, freighter watching and Bird Watching, for instance. You also won’t have to get your feet wet to enjoy a classic Sunset Cruise on the Isle Royale Queen Ferry!\n\nDid you know? Lake Superior contains more water than the other four Great Lakes combined and it is the largest freshwater lake in the WORLD by surface area. In fact, the big lake contains so much water that if it were to spill out the entire landmass of North and South America would be flooded in a whole foot of water!"
