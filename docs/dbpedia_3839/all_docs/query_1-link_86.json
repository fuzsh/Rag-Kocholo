        "text": "ISLE ROYALE, MI - For the first time in more than 15 years, researchers say Michigan’s remote Isle Royale now has four territorial wolf packs that have staked their claim on different areas of that wilderness. And one pack on the east side includes nearly half of the island’s estimated 30 wolves.\n\nAnd to no surprise, this East End pack has carved out a territory that overlaps with where the bulk of the island’s moose live, keeping their food source close.\n\n“That the wolf population consists of four packs is really noteworthy — a strong sign that the wolves have plenty of food,” said John Vucetich, co-leader of the long-running Isle Royale Wolf and Moose study.\n\nResults of the team’s annual Winter Study were released today by Michigan Technological University. It puts the wolf population in this national park in Lake Superior at 30 – down by one wolf compared to the 2023 study. This reflects a wolf population that has now “stabilized,” according to researchers, six years after the National Park Service began its plan to bring in new wolves to help balance the fast-rising moose population.\n\nThere is also evidence that at least three litters of wolf pups have been born on the island within the last year.\n\nAs for the moose, researchers estimate there are 840 on Isle Royale. This represents a nearly 60% drop compared to 2019, when the moose population hit a high of more than 2,000. Another big takeaway is that malnutrition and starvation are not the biggest cause of moose deaths like in past seasons.\n\n“For the first time in many years, wolf predation is once again the main cause of mortality for adult moose,” said Sarah Hoy, one of the study leaders.\n\nA moose can eat up to 40 pounds of leafy vegetation each day. In years past as the moose population spiked and the number of wolves dwindled, the park service was worried that moose were overbrowsing this island wilderness that’s loved by hikers and nature-seekers. Basically, the moose were eating so much that it put a dent in their favorite tree and plant species on Isle Royale, including balsam fir.\n\n“It appears that restored wolf predation is now coming to bear on calf survival, greatly reducing the growth potential of the moose population, but offering hope that trees stunted by moose feeding might finally be able to grow,” said Rolf Peterson, another of the study’s leaders.\n\nWolf Pack Dynamics\n\nThe wolf dynamics observed earlier this year by researchers shows a more organized system than this time last year. Four territorial packs have been named based on their island geography:\n\nWest Pack with at least four wolves\n\nMiddle Pack with at least seven wolves\n\nNortheast Pack with at least five wolves\n\nEast Pack with at least 13 wolves\n\nAt least one lone wolf\n\n“From their survey plane this year, researchers saw wolves that appeared to be 9-month-old pups in the Middle Pack, East Pack and Northeast Pack. They didn’t observe any indications that the West Pack produced a litter last April, but said the lack of evidence is inconclusive due to the relatively short amount of time they were able to be on the island this winter,” MTU staff said.\n\nThe effort to rebuild wolf packs on Michigan’s remote Isle Royale National Park will reach the six-year mark this fall.\n\nThe National Park Service wanted to replenish the predator population on the island that had seen its once-healthy wolf packs fall victim to inbreeding and disease, and dwindle to just two non-breeding wolves. The NPS determined new wolves capable of creating healthy packs were needed to keep the rising moose population in check - and to stop the overbrowsing of this wilderness spot.\n\nThe first new wolves were trapped and brought over from Minnesota, and then more were translocated from Canada and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. In all, 19 new wolves were relocated to Isle Royale in 2018 and 2019.\n\nNo wolf litters had been recorded on the island from 2015 to 2018. But months after the first new wolves arrived, a litter was born in 2019. There were two litters born in 2020, another two in 2021, and very likely four litters of pups in 2022. Evidence of at least three litters in 2023 were seen during this winter’s study.\n\nWinter Study Cut Short\n\nThe Isle Royale wolf and moose study is entering its 66th year. It is the world’s longest-running predator-prey study and takes place on this remote island archipelago in Lake Superior, about 60 miles from the Upper Peninsula’s mainland. Supported by Michigan Tech, researchers visited Isle Royale in January to do the animal counts. They flew in planes and counted moose and wolves from the air. Others used cross-country skis and snowshoes to record observations on moose and do fieldwork on the ground.\n\nThis year’s Winter Study was cut short by the unusually warm winter. The team relies on ice-covered lakes to land their small ski plane. When the ice started melting early, they had to cut their study window short. They were able to get in less than two weeks of fieldwork instead of the usual seven. Still, they were able to gather a lot of information while they were on the island.\n\n“Despite the very short survey period and lack of ice and snow, we were able to complete one of the best moose surveys I’ve seen in the past half century,” Peterson said.\n\n“The overcast skies and calm winds were exactly what we needed for flying and seeing moose on our census plots, and 10 inches of fresh fluffy snow came right before our arrival, providing a perfect backdrop for spotting moose.”\n\nLove Isle Royale’s wolf and moose stories?
