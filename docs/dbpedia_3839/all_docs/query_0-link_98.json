After a long day of exploring, the Rock Harbor Lodge and Greenstone Grill offer an array of food and beverage options, as well as a place to rest your head. For a more rugged experience, bring camping gear and settle into one of the 36 available campgrounds.\n\nAs Michael awaits the seaplane to return to Copper Harbor, he reflects on the intrinsic connection park rangers, residents, and locals have to the land. Despite being one of the least-visited national parks, Isle Royale boasts the highest return rate of visitors a testament to the captivating allure and magnetic energy that the island exudes. Michael quickly realizes how Isle Royale has captured his heart, and like many other visitors, he will undoubtedly make a return visit in the future."
