        "text": "An hour into my first hike on Isle Royale, Michigan's national park far out in Lake Superior, I wondered what it would take to spot one of the island's famous moose.\n\nMaybe if I thrashed the underbrush with my hiking stick it would draw some attention. Sure enough, a few seconds after I finished beating the brush, I heard similar thrashing from deep in the forest.\n\nThen I heard grunting.\n\nThen the grunting got louder.\n\nThen I glimpsed the head of a moose coming my way through the thick brush.\n\nUh-oh. This 1,000-pound moose has a brain the size of a tennis ball, but I'm the dummy who encouraged it to head straight for me.\n\nWithout waiting for a good look, I dashed down the trail and made a safe escape.\n\nThis moose calling is going to be easy, I thought. Maybe I could do the same thing with the wolves that prey on them.\n\nIsle Royale is one of the few spots in the American Midwest with sufficient allure to draw a hiker from Oregon for an outdoor experience, though Michigan has several other places, also. The 45-mile-long island, the biggest in the world's largest freshwater lake, has been a national park since 1946.\n\nAnd it's not just any national park. Isle Royale is the least visited national park in the lower 48 states, with a visitor count of 14,560 last year. The island offers the quintessential North Woods experience of hiking (or paddling) in a boreal forest, but with national park amenities that include trails, campgrounds, ferry service, boat docks and a park lodge.\n\nBefore I boarded an airplane bound for Minneapolis, the most convenient big city gateway to the park, hardly anyone I knew in Oregon had heard of Isle Royale. Perhaps if it had been named Lake Superior National Park, it would be better known.\n\nThe largest of the Great Lakes, Lake Superior and its island were named by French explorers. The French word superieur means the upper, or the highest, of the five lakes. But when translated into English, the name fits the lake perfectly.\n\nSprawling over 31,700 square miles, Lake Superior is without compare in North America. I know, because I had to drive more than 400 miles of its 1,300-mile shoreline just to get a ferry ride to the island.\n\nI rented a car at MSP airport and drove to Duluth, the town at the lake's western point. (When viewed on a map, Lake Superior resembles the head of a wolf, with Duluth as the nose and Isle Royale the eye.)\n\nI pushed on the same day to the northeast tip of Minnesota, stopping at a motel at Grand Marais, before continuing the next morning to meet a small passenger ferry at Grand Portage, just before the Canadian border. Isle Royale would be a 22-mile ride across the lake.\n\nMy plan was to backpack 45 miles across the island, then catch a ferry back to the same place. With a ferry that circles the island, dropping off and picking up passengers along the way, this is one of the ultimate one-way hiking experiences in the National Park System.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nOur ferry, the Wenonah II, left port on schedule, under clear skies on a September day that would reach into the 70s. But as soon as we rounded a point and entered open water, I knew something bad was happening.\n\nThe boat was rocking and rolling in giant swells.\n\nThe captain gave it a gallant try, but after 45 minutes turned back to port because big winds forewarned of an approaching storm. Lake Superior, after all, is where the infamous 725-foot Edmund Fitzgerald went down in 1975 before the ore carrier could issue a distress call.\n\nMost of the passengers on the ferry wiped the sweat off their brows, collected a refund and looked for something else to do that day. Since this was near the end of Isle Royale's short summer visitor season, I headed into the north woods on the Gunflint Trail to study my options.\n\nThe Gunflint is a paved highway, not a trail, that winds 57 miles past dozens of lakes before it gets too wet for a road to continue. The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness lines the side of the highway, making this another worthy destination even for Oregonians.\n\nNortheast Minnesota is intensely developed for outdoor recreation, with dozens of wilderness fishing lodges, campgrounds, paddle routes and winter sports trails. It also has the 147-mile North Shore Trail, a hiking and snowmobile route that follows Lake Superior on the bluffs above the shoreline.\n\nMy time was too limited for in-depth exploration of the trail, but I paused to visit gorges carved millions of years ago through ancient bedrock by small rivers dropping off the plateau before entering the lake.\n\nMy second best option for getting to Isle Royale was to drive 416 miles, mostly along the lakeshore, to where Michigan's Upper Peninsula juts a thumb into Lake Superior. This is the Keweenaw Peninsula, the mouth of the wolf when viewing the lake on a map.\n\nLike Minnesota, northern Michigan is an area of intense beauty, with fall color sweeping down from the hills to meet the beautiful lakeshore.\n\nA ferry was scheduled to make the 55-mile crossing from Copper Harbor, Mich., to the island on Monday, then come back on Friday. The ferry sails daily during summer, but this late season run fit my vacation plans, so that's what I did.\n\nThe stormy weather from the previous week had settled down, so the 3.5-hour crossing was uneventful. The park's Rock Harbor Lodge was closed for the season, making camping my only option. And my planned walk across the island was no longer possible because ferry schedules didn't fit that plan.\n\nAfter checking in with the national park staff and getting a camping permit, I took one of the handy Adirondack shelters provided for free at several of the island's campgrounds. The one-room wooden shelters have an open side covered by a screen to keep the insects out. Since I was there just after Labor Day, the park's notorious insects of summer were no longer around.\n\nWith no furniture, the shelter's floor is big enough to sleep five. I had the shelter to myself and it sure beat sleeping in a tent. And the picnic table just outside the door provided a place to cook, sit, read and organize gear.\n\nAfter one night at Rock Harbor, I hiked eight miles west along the shoreline to Daisy Farm campground for three more nights in another shelter. After my brush with the moose, I was startled one day when a red fox walked curiously within two feet of me while I was having lunch.\n\nThese critters think they own the place and, fortunately, they do. Human presence is fleeting on Isle Royale, concentrated in the short summer season and not allowed at all in winter (except for scientists). With the reduced ferry schedules of late summer, perhaps only 200 people were spread around the island when I was there.\n\nThis lack of crowds made the visit to the island perhaps my most enjoyable to any American national park. Never have I felt such a slowing down of pace.\n\nCampers lowered their voices and talked in whispers as evening approached, perhaps so they wouldn't miss the haunting call of the common loons. The quiet is not broken by cars or dogs, because neither are allowed on the island, although motorboats prowl offshore.\n\nDuring two days and 30 miles of hiking around Daisy Farm, I made two loops in which I rarely retraced a step. I hiked to Moskey Basin, another beautiful lakefront campground, up Greenstone Ridge for views from Mount Ojibway fire lookout and Mount Franklin, from where Ontario, Canada, lies 14 miles across the water.\n\nThe weather was sunny and warm, with no hint of the deep freeze that autumn would soon bring. Birch and aspen trees were prematurely turning red and gold, more from a summer of drought than from the onset of fall. The days could not have been more idyllic.\n\nMost hikers I met along the trail stopped to chat, asking where I was from, where I had been and where I was going -- a bit surprising to a Northwesterner used to encountering little more than a head-down \"howdy\" on the trail.\n\nWhen I went looking for moose and wolves, I discovered their tracks on a sandy beach. I never did see another moose, but I was sure that I heard a wolf howling one night -- though it may have been the haunting call of a loon.\n\nIf you go: Isle Royale\n\nGetting there: Easiest from Portland is a nonstop flight to Minneapolis on Delta Airlines (about $400 round trip), then drive to one of three ferry terminals.\n\nFerries: Isle Royale gateways are from Grand Portage, Minn., and Houghton and Copper Harbor, Mich. Expect to pay about $120 round trip. Each has a particular advantage, depending on what you want to do on the island. The Minnesota connection works best for travelers from the West. Make a reservation for the ferries.\n\nLodging: Camp for free in any of several campgrounds, or choose from 60 hotel rooms and 20 cottages at Rock Harbor Lodge. Reservations aren't taken for camping, but it's best to have one for lodging.\n\nMore info: A trip to such a remote place requires lots of planning. Start with the National Park Service's Greenstone newspaper. Call for it to be mailed, 906-482-0984, or print it off the park's Web site, nps.gov/isro.\n\nRead more about visiting Michigan on this website this week:\n\nTuesday: Oregon football teams head for Michigan weekend\n\nWednesday: Isle Royale National Park (click to read my report)\n\nThursday: The U.P., Upper Peninsula\n\nFriday: Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore\n\nSaturday: U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame in Ishpeming.\n\nNext Monday: An early report from Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore"
