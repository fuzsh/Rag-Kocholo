Isle Royale Had An Active Sea-Faring Trade\n\nFor someone who is a retired history teacher and lifelong history buff, for me one of the most fascinating of the Isle Royale National Park Facts has to do with ships which frequented this area.\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, Native American copper hunters were probably the first navigators to risk the dangerous Lake Superior waters in order to travel to Isle Royale.\n\nThey most likely used the birch bark canoe, which was strong and versatile.\n\nIsle Royale Was A Voyageurs Highway\n\nDuring the 1600s, European-American missionaries, traders, and explorers who ventured to Isle Royale also used the canoe.\n\nThe famous route just north of lsle Royale, the “Voyageurs Highway,” was traveled by many canoes carrying trade goods from Mackinac or Montreal to get to Grand Portage.\n\nBetween the 1770s and the 1820s, furs were transported by the Northwest Company from Grand Portage (and later, Fort William) to Sault Sainte Marie in sailing ships.\n\nThe American Fur Company\n\nIt was not until 1837 when the American Fur Company established fishing posts on the island that large vessels and regular boat service began to arrive.\n\nThe American Fur Company had fishing operations at several sites on Isle Royale, with major warehouses located at Siskiwit Bay and Rock Harbor. These warehouses were visited by company-owned schooners that delivered supplies to the island and transported fish to Sault Sainte Marie.\n\nAfter the Isle Royale American Fur Company fisheries closed in 1839, the island was not frequented by large sailing ships until the first copper mining rush in 1843, when the island saw an influx of ships transporting miners and supplies.\n\nCHECK OUT: 25 Bucket List Famous Landmarks In America (MUST-SEE)\n\n2.
