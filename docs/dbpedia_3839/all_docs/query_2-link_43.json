        "text": "Isle Royale National Park may require more planning, but once you learn more about this incredible island, you’ll likely be planning your trip. Below you’ll find the ultimate guide to Isle Royale National Park, including how to get there, when to visit, the park’s history, the best things to do, and more.\n\nIsle Royale National Park\n\nIsolated by the chilly waters of the largest freshwater lake on earth is a richly forested island of volcanic rock that we call Isle Royale National Park.\n\nIt is a world apart, a uniquely secluded northern wilderness where the ruthless delicacy of nature's balance is an observable fact.\n\nThis 45-mile-long refuge, some 15 to 18 miles from Canada and about 50 miles from the Michigan mainland, is one of the few places in the lower 48 states where wolves run free and unchallenged.\n\nPlaying as they once did across much of the Northern Hemisphere, a vital role in maintaining the health and strength of the wildlife community they prey upon.\n\nAbout Isle Royale National Park\n\nIsle Royale National Park is located in the northwest region of Lake Superior. While the park technically belongs to Michigan, its location makes it easily accessible from Canada and Minnesota, in addition to the state’s Upper Peninsula.\n\nThe park’s remote island location does make it a bit difficult to access, and visitors will need to take either a boat or seaplane out to the island.\n\nIn addition, the park is only open for part of the year due to extreme weather (mid-April through late October).\n\nThe park is a prime example of undeveloped north woods wilderness and offers very little in the way of modern conveniences.\n\nThis is a national park for true adventurers - keep reading to find out more!\n\nIs Isle Royale National Park worth visiting?\n\nIsle Royale is the least visited national park in the lower 48, but that doesn’t mean that you should count it out.\n\nAlthough the park’s remote location deters most, it is absolutely worth making the trek.\n\nOf all the national parks in the system, Isle Royale has the most repeat visitors. Those who have been to the park know that this hidden gem is worth exploring again and again.\n\nIf you decide to make the journey out to Isle Royale, you will be rewarded with unspoiled wilderness, epic hiking trails, hundreds of lakes to fish from, and a gorgeous shoreline that can be explored by canoe or kayak - all without the crowds!\n\nHistory of Isle Royale National Park\n\nAlthough Isle Royale has been a protected area for nearly a century, its history goes even further back.\n\nNative Americans used the island for fishing and hunting, and there is evidence of copper pits used to create tools and weapons from this time period as well.\n\nOnce Europeans came to the island in the early 1800s, copper mining and commercial fishing were widespread, but are no longer present today.\n\nIn 1931 the island and submerged land surrounding it became a national park, and in 1981 Isle Royale became an international Biosphere Reserve.\n\nEven with the presence of mining and commercial fishing operations, the island has remained mostly untouched by the outside world and is one of the best examples of primitive America.\n\nThings to know before your visit to Isle Royale National Park\n\nEntrance fee\n\n$7 per person daily entrance fee\n\n$60 annual pass for 4 adults\n\nThe park only accepts credit cards for entrance fee payments. Cash and Checks are no longer accepted.\n\nPlanning a National Park vacation? America the Beautiful/National Park Pass covers entrance fees for an entire year to all US National Park Sites and over 2,000 Federal Recreation Fee Sites.\n\nThe park pass covers everyone in the car for per vehicle sites and for up to 4 adults for per-person sites.\n\nBuy on REI.com and REI will donate 10% of pass proceeds to the National Forest Foundation, National Park Foundation and the U.S. Endowment for Forestry & Communities.\n\nLearn more about National Park Passes for parks that have an entrance fee.\n\nFree Entrance Days -Mark your calendars with the five free entrance days the National Park Service offers annually.\n\nTime Zone\n\nEastern Time\n\nTransportation providers travel on the time zone where their home port is. Make sure to confirm the correct time.\n\nPets\n\nPets are NOT allowed on the island including no pets on boats within the park boundaries.\n\nCell Service\n\nCell service is not available within the park.\n\nPark Hours\n\nIsle Royale National Park is open every year from April 16 through October 31.\n\nWi-Fi\n\nOvernight guests at the Rock Harbor Lodge have access to Wi-Fi.\n\nThere is no other Wi-Fi available on the island.\n\nThere is Wi-Fi available at the Houghton Visitor Center.\n\nInsect Repellent\n\nMosquitos and Black Flies typically hatch from late May to early June. They are at their worst in late June and early July.\n\nInsect repellent is always a great idea when outdoors, especially if you are around any body of water.\n\nWe use Permethrin Spray on our clothes before our park trips.\n\nWater Bottle\n\nMake sure to bring your own water bottle and plenty of water with you. Plastic water bottles are not sold in the park.\n\nParking\n\nCars are not allowed on Isle Royale, so there is no need to worry about parking!\n\nParking is available at the ferry terminals, though you may be required to pay a small daily fee.\n\nFood/Restaurants\n\nThere are 2 restaurants at the Rock Harbor Lodge, the Light House Restaurant and Greenstone Grill\n\nGas\n\nThere is no gas available within the park.\n\nDrones\n\nDrones are not permitted within National Park Sites.\n\nNational Park Passport Stamps\n\nNational Park Passport stamps can be found in the visitor center.\n\nMake sure to bring your National Park Passport Book with you or we like to pack these circle stickers so we don't have to bring our entire book with us.\n\nIsle Royale NP is part of the 2001 Passport Stamp Set\n\nElectric Vehicle Charging\n\nThere are 33 EV Charging Stations in Houghton, Michigan.\n\nDetails about Isle Royale National Park\n\nSize - 571,790 acres\n\nThe main island of Isle Royale is 50 miles long and 9 miles wide. There are over 400 islands in the park.\n\nIsle Royale NP is currently ranked at 18 out of 63 National Parks by Size.\n\nDate Established\n\nApril 3, 1940 - The park was established by President Herbert Hoover.\n\nVisitation\n\nIn 2021, Isle Royale NP had 25,844 park visitors.\n\nIn 2020, Isle Royale NP had 6,493 park visitors.\n\nIn 2019, Isle Royale NP had 26,410 park visitors.\n\nLearn more about the most visited and least visited National Parks in the US\n\nNational Park Address\n\nPark Headquarters\n\n800 East Lakeshore Drive\n\nHoughton, MI 49931\n\nIsle Royale National Park Map\n\nFor a more detailed map, we like the National Geographic Trails Illustrated Maps on Amazon\n\nWhere is Isle Royale National Park?\n\nIsle Royale is located on an island in Lake Superior in northern Michigan near the border with Canada.\n\nEstimated distance from major cities nearby\n\nMileage is calculated from the visitor center in Houghton, Michigan.\n\nMinneapolis, MN - 368 miles\n\nMadison, WI - 326 miles\n\nMilwaukee, WI - 326 miles\n\nChicago, IL - 415 miles\n\nDetroit, MI - 553 miles\n\nToledo, OH - 591 miles\n\nEstimated Distance from nearby National Park\n\nVoyageurs National Park - 358 miles\n\nIndiana Dunes National Park - 449 miles\n\nGateway Arch National Park - 676 miles\n\nCuyahoga Valley National Park - 710 miles\n\nMammoth Cave National Park - 807 miles\n\nWhere is the National Park Visitor Center?\n\nHougton Visitor Center\n\nAddress - 800 E.

However, the bird’s eye view is worth every penny if you can swing it. Seaplane reservations are required.\n\nPrivate Boat\n\nFeel free to taxi yourself out to Isle Royale if you have your own boat.\n\nHowever, note that Lake Michigan is notorious for its unpredictable weather and its rocky bottom and coastline, so proceed with caution!\n\nBest time to visit Isle Royale National Park\n\nIsle Royale is the only park in the entire system that closes down completely for part of the year, so you’ll need to plan your trip between mid-April and late October.\n\nOf course, the weather is at its best in the summer months, and you’ll never have to worry about crowds, but the shoulder seasons have their own appeal as well.\n\nWeather and Seasons\n\nSpring\n\nThe park is closed until mid-April, but once the snow begins to melt, the park begins to come alive again with wildlife and visitors.\n\nOne of the perks of visiting in the spring is that there are very few visitors on the island, and you’ll also beat the annual mosquito and black fly hatching that occurs in late May.\n\nHowever, note that the weather may still be a bit iffy in Spring, so check the weather forecast before making any solid plans.\n\nSummer\n\nYour best shot for warm sunny days in the summer, though even these months can be chilly, windy, and stormy.\n\nJuly is typically the warmest month at the park, though temps rarely reach above 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nPlan for chilly weather and wear plenty of layers as you won’t have much reprieve from the elements on this remote island.\n\nIf you visit in the summer, you should also pack plenty of bug spray to ward off the mosquitos and black flies that hatch in late May.\n\nAutumn/Fall\n\nAutumn can be a great time of year to visit the park, especially when the fall foliage is at its peak.\n\nHowever, temperatures are quite chilly during this time of the year, so plan accordingly. Visitors should also note that the park closes completely on November 1st each year.\n\nWinter\n\nIsle Royale National Park is completely shut-down in the winter (November 1st to April 15th).\n\nBest Things to do in Isle Royale National Park\n\nWildlife viewing\n\nWildlife viewing at Isle Royale National Park is unlike any other place on earth. About 99% of the land area is designated wilderness, which means that it has been protected from outside influence.\n\nThe most common wildlife sightings at the park include red fox, loons, moose, snowshoe hare, beaver, mink, marten, red squirrel, and river otter.\n\nIn the late 1940s, temperatures dropped so low that an ice bridge formed between Isle Royale and Canda, allowing a small pack of Eastern timber wolves to make the crossing.\n\nTheir numbers are extremely low, and you probably won’t see any during your visit, but their existence in the park is pretty incredible and worth noting.\n\nJunior Ranger Program\n\nIf you brought the kids along on your trip to Isle Royale National Park, be sure to sign them up for the junior ranger program.\n\nThis hands-on program will allow your young ones to learn all about the park in a fun way, and once they complete the program, they will receive a cool badge to commemorate their time here.\n\nFishing\n\nFishing has long since been a part of the island, and Native American tribes once fished from these very waters.\n\nThere are over 100 inland lakes across the island, and you can fish from these permit-free.\n\nCommon catches include walleye, trout, northern pike, and perch. If you want to cast out on the big lake (Lake Superior), you’ll need to obtain a Michigan fishing license before arriving at the park.\n\nPaddling\n\nPaddling is a great way to see some of the hidden nooks and crannies of the park.\n\nThe most popular area for paddling is around Rock Harbor, and you can rent kayaks and canoes from the Rock Harbor campground or Rock Harbor Lodge. You could also bring your own water vessel along on the ferry for an additional charge.\n\nGuided Boat Tours\n\nIf you want to make sure you stay dry while exploring the park, you can book a sightseeing tour with the MV Sandy.\n\nPark rangers lead various different tours around the shoreline with opportunities to disembark and participate in guided hikes.\n\nTours are available between early June and early September.\n\nHiking in Isle Royale National Park\n\nAlways carry the 10 essentials for outdoor survival when exploring.\n\nThere are over 165 miles of hiking trails on Isle Royale, and since there are no roads, this is one of the main ways to get around.\n\nTrails range in length and difficulty, so hikers of all skill levels are sure to find a suitable route or two. We’ve highlighted some of the best of the best below.\n\nGreenstone Ridge Trail - Hard - 43 miles - Point to Point\n\nNamed for the 800 feet thick green-hued basalt rock for which it sits, the Greenstone Ridge Trail is a must-hike while at Isle Royale National Park.\n\nEven if you just do a section of the trail, you’ll be treated to incredible views across Lake Superior and the islands surrounding the park.\n\nThe best part about this lengthy trail is that it traverses nearly the entire length of the island, so no matter where you are in the park, it's relatively easy to hop on and hike a section.\n\nMount Franklin via Tobin Harbor Trail - Moderate - 9.4 miles - Out & Back\n\nThis popular route follows Tobin Bay along the rocky coastlines. The views are epic, and it’s not uncommon to spot moose and other wildlife along the trail near the pond!\n\nScoville Point via Stoll Trail - Easy - 4.7 miles - Loop\n\nThis is one of the easiest trails at the park, so if you want stunning lake views without all the work, this is one of the best options.\n\nMinong Ridge Overlook - Moderate - 6.6 miles - Out & Back\n\nDon't miss the Minong Ridge Overlook if you’re on the west side of the island (Windigo area). This is a moderately difficult route that ends at the scenic Minong Ridge Overlook.\n\nHikers will be rewarded with panoramic views of the island’s west end and Lake Superior. On clear days you can even see Canada’s shoreline in the distance.\n\nHow to beat the crowds in Isle Royale National Park?\n\nIt’s easy to beat the crowds at Isle Royale National Park, mainly because there are none!\n\nThis is the least visited national park outside of Alaska, so seekers of solitude need not worry about sharing this rugged expanse with tons of other visitors.\n\nWhere to stay when visiting Isle Royale National Park\n\nRock Harbor Lodge\n\nIf you prefer the security of knowing where you’ll rest your head at night, book a room at the Rock Harbor Lodge, located on the northwest side of Isle Royale.\n\nThe rooms are a bit dated, but if you want a real bed and a great meal waiting for you after a long day of hiking or paddling, the Rock Harbor Lodge will do splendidly.\n\nWindigo Camper Cabins\n\nThere are also two cabins available for rent on the southwest side of the island.\n\nThese rustic, one-room cabins are a great retreat from the elements, though they do get booked up extremely quickly each year. So, be ready to book in January for the coming season if you want to snag one of these abodes.\n\nLodging near Isle Royale NP\n\nThe majority of lodging is located in Houghton, Michigan.
