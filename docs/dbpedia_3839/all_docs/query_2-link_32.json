        "meta_description": "Isle Royale is one of the most unusual national parks, not just in Michigan or the Midwest but in the country. It is one of the smallest at only 210 square miles and has one of the lowest numbers of visitors, a mere 17,000. It is the only national park in the country to completely close down in the winter and is also one of the most costly to visit as special transportation is needed to reach the isolated island. But most of all, Isle Royale has become a paradise for wilderness enthusiasts, particularly backpackers. The 45-mile-long island is laced with 165 miles of foot trails and dotted with backcountry campgrounds.",

        "text": "There are small stores in Rock Harbor and Windigo that carry many items, ranging from freeze-dried dinners and trail munches to fishing tackle, pots and day packs. But the quantities are limited and often run out until the next boat arrives while the prices are higher than on the mainland.\n\nThose ending their trek at Rock Harbor have several ways of easing themselves back into civilization. Shower tokens, clean towel, and bar of soap can be purchased at the camp store. After 6 days of mac-and-cheese, you might want to have dinner at the lodge dining room. Or maybe just a cold beer on the adjacent outdoor deck.\n\nSome backpackers even like to book a room for their final night at Rock Harbor, either at the lodge or in one of the housekeeping units that can be shared by six people and feature small kitchenettes. Reservations are strongly recommended, but visitors can occasionally get last-minute accommodations because of cancellations. For reservations, contact the park concessionaire, Forever Resorts (866-644-2003 or 906-337-4993 in summer; www.rockharborlodge.com).\n\nCanoes are also available at Rock Harbor and Windigo for paddling in the local area. The rates are based on a half- or full-day rental and include paddles and life jackets. At Rock Harbor Lodge you can also rent a rowboat and 9.5-horsepower motor. Inquire at the camp stores about rentals.\n\nThree ferries and an air service company provide transportation to the Island and advanced reservations are urged on any of them from late June to late August.\n\nThe 165-foot Ranger III is operated by the National Park Service and travels from Houghton to Rock Harbor on Tuesdays and Fridays, departing Houghton at 9:00 a.m. It returns from Isle Royale on Wednesdays and Saturdays, departing Rock Harbor at 9:00 a.m. for the six-hour trip back to Houghton.\n\nYou can cut the sailing time by 1.5 hours by departing from Copper Harbor, home to the 100-foot Isle Royale Queen IV. From mid-June to July the ship leaves Copper leaves Copper Harbor at 8 a.m. daily except Wednesday and Sunday and departs Rock Harbor the same day at 2:45 p.m. In July it departs Copper Harbor daily except Wednesday and in August it makes the round-trip run to Isle Royale daily. The Copper Harbor ferry also runs in May and September on a reduced schedule.\n\nTwo ferries also depart from Grand Portage for the 2.5-hour trip to the park. Both stop at Windigo, the ranger station at the western end of the Island. From mid-June to early September the 65-foot Seahunter departs Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from Grand Portage at 8:30 A.M. (Central Daylight Time) and then returns from Windigo the same day at 2 P.M . (Central Daylight Time). From mid-July to mid-August it also sails on Thursday and Sunday at the same times.\n\nThe 63-foot Voyageur II runs from early May to late October. From late May to late September, it departs Grand Portage Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 7:30 A.M. (Central Daylight Time), stops at Windigo, and overnights at Rock Harbor Lodge. The following day, Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, it departs from Rock Harbor at 8 A.M. (Central Daylight Time) for Windigo and Grand Portage. For most of May the ship departs Grand Portage only on Wednesday and Saturday and mid-September through mid-October only on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nRegularly scheduled seaplane service is available out of Houghton or Grand Marais for either Windigo or Rock Harbor Lodge. Many backpackers take advantage of the service by taking the plane to Windigo, hiking to Rock Harbor Lodge, and returning on the Ranger III.\n\nIsle Royale Seaplanes provides service daily except on Wednesdays from mid-May to late September. Flights depart from either the Hancock Portage Canal Seaplane Base near Houghton or the Cook County Airport in Grand Marais and land in the protected bays at Windigo and Rock Harbor. The amphibious Cessna 206 carries up to four passengers along with 50 pounds of gear per person.\n\nAdvanced reservations are urged for all three ferries from late June to late August. For reservations for the Ranger III contact Isle Royale National Park (906-482-0984; www.nps.gov/isro). For the Isle Royale Queen IV contact Isle Royale Line (906-289-4437; www.isleroyale.com), for the Voyageur II or Seahunter contact Grand Portage â€“ Isle Royale Transportation Line (651-653-5872, 888-746-2305; www.isleroyaleboats.com), and for seaplane transport contact Isle Royale Seaplanes (906-483-4991; www.isleroyaleseaplanes.com)."
