        "text": "Accessible only by boat or seaplane, Isle Royale became a national park in 1940, a designated wilderness area in 1976 and an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980. It’s renowned for its pristine waters, rugged shoreline and intriguing wildlife. More than 99 percent of Isle Royale’s land is designated wilderness.\n\nSo what if you want to enjoy this northern haven, but don’t like camping or don’t have the first clue about surviving a night outdoors?\n\nNo problem. Check in to Michigan’s most remote lodge and the only operating hotel on Isle Royale.\n\n“The Rock Harbor Lodge plays an important role in supporting the spectrum of the public that are no longer able to, or who have never been interested in, a backpack expedition,” says Phyllis Green, superintendent of Isle Royale National Park. “With a warm meal and a bed to come back to, visitors can explore the island via day trips and boat excursions.”\n\nLike the island itself, the lodge is unique. The original guesthouse was constructed in the 1920s, when Isle Royale was home to private residences and commercial operations. Today, the rustic three-story building is still perched on the rocky shoreline and guests enjoy its large deck overlooking the water, as well as its cozy living room with couches, chairs, board games and even a crackling fire in the fireplace during cooler weather.\n\nIn the late 1950s, four buildings were added to the lodge, creating 60 guest rooms. The buildings were constructed under the Mission 66 project, a 10-year federal program to improve services and infrastructure at national parks. The Ranger III, a boat owned and operated by the National Park Service that transports visitors to the island, was also built as part of Mission 66. It’s one of four boats that service the island seasonally.\n\nIn the 1960s, 20 cottages were added. They sit on the ridge between Rock Harbor and Tobin Harbor. Most of them overlook the still waters of Tobin Harbor, yet all are just a short walk from the main lodge. The cottages are furnished housekeeping units, giving guests the option to cook their own meals. In the main lodge, there is a full service dining room serving three meals daily with the adjacent grill offering dining throughout the day. Guests can arrange to take out box lunches.\n\nThe lodge remains faithful to its historic origins and offers guests a true wilderness experience – quiet starry nights, with gently lapping waves and loons calling – but the resort also provides modern comforts.\n\n“All our rooms have recently been renovated with pine paneling, new furnishings and extended decks,” says Kim Alexander, general manager of the Rock Harbor Lodge. “There’s never been a better time to stay at the lodge.”\n\nThrough the lodge, visitors can sign up for guided nature walks, day excursions, fishing charters, boat trips along the shoreline and a sunset cruise.\n\nIsle Royale is one of the least visited national parks, yet has the longest average stay and is one of the most revisited parks in the national system – and the Rock Harbor Lodge contributes to those last two statistics.\n\n“I ran into a couple in their 80s last season who were celebrating their anniversary at the lodge,” says Phyllis. “They’d backpacked the island for their honeymoon, years ago, and had been afraid they wouldn’t be able to visit the park due to health issues. But the lodge facility made the park accessible.”\n\nIsle Royale may be a wilderness island, but it still offers something for everyone, at all times of life.\n\nAs Kim sums it up, “Today’s backpackers are tomorrow’s lodge guests.”\n\nLesley DuTemple is an author and loves her Keweenaw Peninsula home area and all the islands nearby."
