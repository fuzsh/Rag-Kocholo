        "text": "Isle Royale Then\n\nTourism History - Part of the United States since 1783 and part of Michigan since 1837, it took until the mid-1800's for tourism to begin on Isle Royale. Within a decade of its start, day excursions and fishing trips pulled into the harbors. By the turn of the century, resorts appeared, first as tourist cottages, then followed by six resorts that would be in place by 1904. Park Place Hotel was built by Kneut Kneutson and later managed by daughter Bertha. After World War I, a modern lodge building was constructed and the name changed to Rock Harbor Lodge. After the ship America sank in 1928 followed by the depression era, only two of the resorts remained. In 1931, Isle Royale was authorized as a National Park and the Park Service bought Rock Harbor Lodge on July 22, 1938.\n\nOne Lighthouse Story - Increased shipping on Lake Superior caused Congress to authorize five thousand dollars in 1852 to contruct a new lighthouse. By 1855, the Rock Harbor Light was under way, completed one year later. It would have a checkered past. A decrease in mining traffic caused its close three years after opening; it was reopened in 1874 when copper mining increased. When the Isle Royale Light was opened on Menagerie Island and copper prices dipped again, the Rock Harbor Light was abandoned for good on August 24, 1879.\n\nOne Shipwreck Story - There have been twenty-five ships wrecked near the island through history; the first, the Madeline owned by the American Fur Company in 1839. They would continue at frequent intervals. On June 7, 1928, the passenger and freight steamer America sank. The forty-five passengers and crew were rescued safely. It had been built in Detroit in 1901 and used in service on Lake Superior since 1902. During its tenure, the America had a checkered past, too. That past ended off the water of Isle Royale and can still be seen four to eighty-five feet below the waterline.\n\nPhoto above: Historic image of Rock Harbor Lodge guesthouse from the Historic American Buildings Survey, date unknown.

Source: National Park Service.\n\nIsle Royale Now\n\nIt's a long ride to get there by private boat or ferry, but that's how you'll likely come, unless seaplane is preferred. On the trip from the mainland, either Michigan or Minnesota, you start to get a feeling for the land that awaits in the center of Lake Superior. It's beautiful. Clear water. Verdant woodlands. Moose and other wildlife galore. And your trip will be expensive. That's part of the adventure here, although it does contribute to the exclusive low attendance vibe. This is a bit different from the past tourism era before the National Park Service started here in the 1930's and a bit odd in the NPS lexicon. But a trip here has to be well planned, paid for with a long and pricey ferry or seaplane ride, and thought through in advance. Your options while on the island get back to more National Park Service pursuits; hiking nature, boating nature, and camping nature. Of course, the lodge, and there is one historic lodge here, gets back to pricey.\n\nRock Harbor Lodge - This resort remains at Rock Harbor, providing motel rooms and cabins to visitors wanting more than a campsite on their trip. Boat tours, rentals, a store, and restaurant are associated with the lodge.\n\nLighthouses of Isle Royale - Today, there are four remaining lighthouses: Rock of Ages (1908), Rock Harbor (1855), Isle Royale (1875), and Passage Island (1882). You can get a boat tour to Rock Harbor from the lodge; a nice museum is located in the light station.\n\nShipwrecks of Isle Royale - Today, you can explore the shipwrecks of the area both above and below the water, although scuba diving should only be done by experienced divers and does require a permit. There are a variety of ships below the water, including the Algoma passenger steamer 1885, Cumberland passenger steamer 1877, Glenlyon freighter 1924, America package freighter 1928, Chester Congdon freighter 1918, and the Emperor freighter 1947, among others."
