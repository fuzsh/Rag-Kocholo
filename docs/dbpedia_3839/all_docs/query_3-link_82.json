        "text": "Isle Royale National Park is an American national park in the state of Michigan, formed of Isle Royale and over 400 small adjacent islands. The park also includes the neighboring waters of Lake Superior. Isle Royale is the fourth-largest lake island globally, running 45 miles long and 9 miles wide, with an area of 206.73 square miles. Additionally, it makes the largest natural island in Lake Superior and the second-largest island in the Great Lakes. In 1980, the park was\n\ndeclared a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve. Later, in 2019, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places 2019 as the Minong Traditional Cultural Property. The park covers 894 square miles, 209 square miles is land, and 685 square miles is surrounding waters.\n\nMajor Attractions at Isle Royale National Park\n\nIsle Royale National Park in Michigan is spread over 100,000 acres of protected wilderness. The landscape comprises boreal forests of sugar maple, yellow birch, and northern white cedar trees. The flora population includes more than 600 flowering plant species and lichens, shrubs, ferns, and mosses.\n\nThe North Woods offer an isolated slice of paradise for nature lovers. The park is a prime example of Northern Biome forests, lakes, bogs, and island shorelines. The ancient rocks that built the park’s scenery have been scored by the movements of retreating glaciers 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe island is secluded for the most part and does not allow much human intervention. No vehicles have access inside the park either. However, the park offers a full range of outdoor and adventure activities like hiking, fishing, camping, and paddling opportunities to its visitors. The quiet natural surroundings remain undisturbed from pollution, giving a clear view of the majestic aurora borealis, better known as the Northern Lights, and dark skies with bright twinkling lights. The park is home to a large wildlife population and is best known for its local moose and gray wolf. Other mammals like beavers, red foxes, snowshoe hare, minks, and river otters are also seen.\n\nGET KIDS BIRD WATCHING\n\nBird Watching at Isle Royale National Park\n\nThe forested area, surrounding water bodies, and minor human disturbances create the ideal paradise for a wide range of birds and other wildlife. Some of the commonly observed varieties found in Isle Royale National Park are the Sandhill Crane, Great Blue Heron, Downy Woodpecker, Snow Bunting, Double-breasted Cormorant, Winter Wren, and Ovenbird, among others. Isle Royale National Park is a well-recognized Important Bird Area (IBA). Isle Royale is also known to be home to a large number of nesting Merlins and Common Loons.\n\n10 Birds to See at Isle Royale National Park\n\nSandhill Crane\n\nSandhill Cranes are tall, large, and gray with long necks and long legs. They also have red crowns and long bills. Sandhill Cranes live throughout North America. They have made a recent comeback in population. Sandhill Cranes are not endangered but are definitely being watched. They live in the prairie region of North America. Sandhill Cranes have great dancing skills and make recognizable trumpet sounds. They eat the roots of plants in water. They will also eat insects, frogs, snakes, rodents, seeds, and berries. Sandhill Cranes usually lay 2 eggs in a nest built on the ground. They will sometimes build a nest that floats on water that is anchored to plants. Sandhill Cranes that reside in the north migrate more than their southern counterparts.\n\nPine Warbler\n\nPine Warblers have beautiful yellow bodies. You can find them in the eastern United States. Their population is steady, with slight increases. Like their name, Pine Warblers make their homes in pine trees. They may be hard to see up in the high branches. Pine Warblers like to eat seeds, peanuts and cracked corn. They lay 3 to 5 eggs in a nest high above the ground in a pine tree. Their nests are made of pine needles, twigs, bark, spider-webs, and lined with feathers. They migrate early in the spring and again late in the fall.\n\nDowny Woodpecker\n\nDowny Woodpeckers are black and white with a small red patch on their head. They are the smallest Woodpecker and live throughout North America. These birds are common and their population is steady with no risk of being endangered. They make their homes in backyards, parks, and woodlots. Downy Woodpeckers do not sing songs; they drum. In the winter, they like to hang out with other birds such as the Nuthatch and Chickadee. They eat mostly insects, but also eat seeds and berries. Downy Woodpeckers build their nests in holes of dead trees and keep them camouflaged. They lay 4 to 5 eggs. Downy Woodpeckers are permanent residents; however, some in the north migrate south in the winter.\n\nEastern Phoebe\n\nEastern Phoebes are a brown and white songbird. They live throughout the eastern region of North America. Their population is stable and is not at risk of being endangered. They live near streams and woodland edges. Eastern Phoebe’s songs are usually the first sign of spring. They eat mostly insects and some berries and fruit in cooler weather. They lay 4 to 5 eggs and nest under bridges and in old buildings. Eastern Phoebes migrate in early spring and late fall.\n\nBlack-throated Blue Warbler\n\nAs their name states, Black-throated Blue Warblers are a deep blue color with a black throat. They live in eastern North America but spend the winter in the Caribbean. These Warblers are considered threatened birds since their numbers have declined. They live in hardwood forests. They feed on small insects found on the underside of leaves. Black-throated Blue Warblers lay 2 to 5 eggs, but usually 4. They build their nests about 6 feet off the ground in the fork of a tree. Black-throated Blue Warblers migrate to the Caribbean in the fall.\n\nBlackburnian Warbler\n\nBlackburnian Warblers are black with white patches, a yellow belly, and an orange throat. You can find these birds throughout eastern North America. Sadly, their population is decreasing because the forests they make their homes in are being cut down. They make their homes in forests and woodlands. Blackburnian Warblers are found high in the tops of trees where they eat insects but mostly caterpillars. They lay about 4 eggs and when the fledglings leave the nest the parents split up to care for each of them. Blackburnian Warblers migrate over a broad area, but most migrate across the Gulf of Mexico and spend the winter in South America.\n\nCape May Warbler\n\nCape May Warblers are yellowish-green with tiger stripes on their chest, a white patch on their wings, and a chestnut cheek patch. You can find them in the northeast region of North America. Their population is steady, with a slight increase recently. They make their homes in trees, such as spruces. Cape May Warblers feed on insects and have a special unique tongue that allows them to sip nectar from flowers and on occasion a Hummingbird feeder. They lay about 6 eggs which is the highest of all Warblers. Cape May Warblers migrate from the Caribbean in the spring.\n\nCommon Yellowthroat\n\nCommon Yellowthroats have a yellow body with a black face. They live throughout North America. There has been a decline in population, but they are still common in most areas. Their habitat is in swamps and marshes. Common Yellowthroats are vocal birds, singing to announce their arrival. They lay 3 to 5 eggs in a nest very low to the ground. Common Yellowthroats migrate mostly at night during both spring and fall.\n\nYellow-bellied Sapsucker\n\nYellow-bellied Sapsuckers are actually black and white with a red head and throat. You can find them in eastern North America. Their population has disappeared in some southern areas, but the overall population is widespread and steady. They make their homes in aspen groves, orchards, and trees. Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers often peck a row of small holes in a tree to get sap out to eat. Along with tree sap, they like to eat insects and fruit. They lay 5 to 6 eggs in the same tree year after year, but use a different hole in the tree. Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers migrate to the south.\n\nGreat Blue Heron\n\nGreat Blue Herons are tall with gray-blue wings. They are slow-moving birds and weigh about 6 pounds. You can find them all across the United States. Their population has stabilized since some small declines. They live near riverbanks, ponds, and edges of marshes. They hunt for food morning and night because they have night vision. Great Blue Herons eat fish mostly but will also eat other small animals like frogs. They build their nests high or low in trees. They use big sticks to make large platform nests. These birds lay 3 to 5 eggs. Northern populations east of the Rockies are migratory, but most other Great Blue Herons are not migratory.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIsle Royale National Park is a true wilderness gem in the heart of Lake Superior.
