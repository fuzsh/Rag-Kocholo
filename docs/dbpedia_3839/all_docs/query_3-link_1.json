        "text": "Isle Royale is Accessed Via Boat or Seaplane\n\nAs a collection of islands, Isle Royale can only be accessed by crossing Lake Superior via a boat or seaplane. Most visitors to the park utilize ferry or seaplane services from Michigan or Minnesota. Private boaters and private seaplanes travel from around Lake Superior and beyond.\n\nNo Vehicles are Allowed on the Island\n\nFerry services only transport people and select freight (canoes, kayaks, luggage, etc.). They do not transport vehicles to the park since vehicles are not allowed on the island.\n\nNon-motorized wheelchairs are welcome, although trails are narrow and rocky with numerous boardwalks.\n\nBicycles and other wheeled devices (wagons, strollers, portaging carts, etc.) are not allowed on park trails.\n\nTraveling to Isle Royale Takes Time and is Weather Dependent\n\nAll visitors who travel to Isle Royale must cross Lake Superior's vast, cold waters. Travel times one-way range from 35-45 minutes on the seaplane service. On the ferries, travel times one-way range from 1.5 hours to 7 hours, depending upon departure and arrival location. Ferry crossings can be flat calm, or rough and bumpy. Inclement weather on Lake Superior can cause ferry services to be delayed or cancelled. Fog, storms, and wind on the mainland or island can cause seaplane services to be delayed or cancelled.\n\nCell Phone Service is Unreliable - Do Not Depend on it for Your Trip\n\nOccasionally you may pick up a signal if you are on a high ridge - be aware that this may be a Canadian tower, and additional fees through your cell phone carrier may apply. Do not plan on being able to use your cell phone in case of an emergency. When the Rock Harbor Trading Post in Rock Harbor and Windigo Store in Windigo are open, there is a satellite phone available for visitor use (additional fees apply). There is no public Wi-Fi available for visitor use on island.\n\nEmergency Medical Response and Evacuation are Limited and Take Time\n\nSafety is your responsibility. Come prepared with the knowledge and tools you may need to respond to an emergency. Basic emergency services are available on the island, but contacting rangers for assistance can be difficult. Emergency response and evacuation take time, requiring you to rely on your own skills and equipment.\n\nPlan a Conservative Trip Itinerary\n\nMany visitors overestimate their skills and abilities and underestimate Isle Royale's challenging terrain when planning their trips. Since it is isolated, there are rarely easy \"bail out\" options in the park when things go wrong. Plan your itinerary with the least experienced person in your party in mind. By doing this, you will have an enjoyable and safe trip, versus one that ends with an emergency.\n\nCome Prepared with Everything You May Need\n\nThere are limited services available in the park, especially for those who visit in the spring (April/May/early June) and fall (September/October). Do not expect park stores or Visitor Centers to have items you may need. Come prepared for the experience you are planning and variable weather conditions. Items to consider for all trips: layers (weather conditions vary, even in the middle of summer), rain gear, sturdy shoes (trails are rocky), extra food, extra fuel, and prescriptions."
