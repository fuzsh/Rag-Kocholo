        "text": "Isle Royale National Park is an isolated island in Lake Superior, 15 miles from the nearest shore. Isle Royale National Park is home to wolves, moose, ridges, and rugged shoreline, but because of its location it can be difficult to reach. From transportation to logistics to routes, I’ve laid out a a detailed guide to help you decide how to visit Isle Royale National Park.\n\nwhy this blog? Hi there! My name is Maddy and I’m a Midwest-based outdoors guide committed to helping people like you explore the Midwest! In 2021, I spent two weeks exploring beautiful Isle Royale, and I’m happy to show you around.\n\nHow to Visit Isle Royale National Park:\n\nBecause Isle Royale is a remote national park, figuring out how a plan a trip to Isle Royale can be hard. Here is everything you need to start planning a trip to Isle Royale National Park:\n\nNote: This article uses affiliate links! that means if you make a purchase based on my recommendation I make a small kickback at no additional cost to you.\n\nHow to Get to Isle Royale National Park:\n\nIsle Royale National Park can only be reached by boat or seaplane. Seaplanes leave from Grand Marais, Minnesota or Hancock, Michigan. Passage by ferry (boat) can be booked from Grand Portage, MN, Copper Harbor, MI, or Houghton, MI. Each ferry runs on a different schedule, and all are subject to potential windbound days/weather delays. Note that there will be certain inbound (coming to the island only) and outbound (leaving the island only) days. If you get sea sick this may not be a pleasant trip for you.\n\nIs it possible to kayak to Isle Royale?\n\nPossible? Yes. Smart? Not particularly. Lake Superior is an incredibly changeable Lake, and the paddle to Isle Royale is 15 miles at the shortest open water crossing. I’ve done the crossing one and a half times. My time on Isle Royale ended in me hypothermic and stranded somewhere between the Island and Canada. I’m literally not kidding. You can read that story here.\n\nWhat should I know before I go to Isle Royale National Park?\n\nIf you plan to camp on Isle Royale you will need to book permits. I suggest calling the park in advance to arrange your permits and make sure you are up-to-date on relevant safety concerns. You will need to pay for a park pass, either a day pass or a season pass depending on your intended use. You can pay those fees online here.\n\nBasic Leave No Trace information on Isle Royale\n\nIsle Royale is traditional Ojibwe land, with historical and cultural ties to the North Shore Ojibwe Nation. Do not disturb archeological sites.\n\nThe backpacking trails are rugged, and there is no cell service. You may not be able to get help quickly in an emergency.\n\nThe moose are in rut in the Fall. There is a large population of moose on the island, and in the Fall take extra care not to upset them for the sake of your own life and limb.\n\nMany of the campsites on Isle Royale (but not all) have shelters. Some of the campsites have fire rings. Research in advance to decide which campground are a good fit for you and your group.\n\nIf you are backpacking you may find that popular campsites/ shelters fill. Be willing to share your space, especially at hubs like McCargoe Cove.\n\nYou will probably not see a wolf, but you will likely see evidence of them.\n\nShoreline environments are fragile, stay on trails wherever possible.\n\nIf you are sea kayaking, you may find that your marine radio gets inconsistent signal throughout the island. On the north end, you may get your weather info in French; this is the Canadian shore forecast and it will switch to English after cycling through in French. You may also get reports from Duluth and Houghton both depending where on the island you are. In general, accuracy of the marine forecast for the island is low, especially in shoulder seasons. Use your own good judgement and read the water carefully.\n\nFor more on Ojibwe connections to Isle Royale, I recommendreading Minong: The Good Place- Ojibwe and Isle Royale by Timothy Cochrane.\n\nThe best backpacking routes on Isle Royale:\n\nIsle Royale National Park is the crown jewel of any Midwest backpacker’s bucket list, with endless route options. The Greenstone Ridge is a moderate backpacking route for a 3-5 day trip at just over forty miles round trip. The route runs between Windigo and Rock Harbor. Alternately, the Minong Ridge Trail is just less than thirty miles and runs between Windigo and McCargoe Cove, but is considered rugged and difficult.\n\nA moderate 3-4 day loop option is the Feldtmann Loop, a 35-mile loop that will take you along the southwestern corner of the island starting and ending at Windigo.\n\nHow to Sea Kayak Isle Royale:\n\nSea kayaking on Isle Royale is an advanced coastal kayaking trip. Unless you have significant sea kayaking experience as well as reasonable knowledge of Lake Superior weather patters, I highly recommend booking a guided kayaking tour.\n\nStone Harbor Wilderness Supply in Grand Marais, MN and Keweenaw Adventure Company in Copper Harbor, MI, both offer multi-day guided tours on Isle Royale National Park. Most likely, these tours will run from Rock Harbor to Malone Bay. Expect to paddle in a variety of conditions.\n\nIn protected coves like Washington Harbor and Rock Harbor, it is possible to safely kayak or canoe on Lake Superior. Rentals are available at Rock Harbor and Windigo. Be aware that venturing out of the protection of the coves and islands conditions can change rapidly and water temperature may induce hypothermia in minutes even in the summer.\n\nRead more about Lake Superior kayak safety here.\n\nHow to Basecamp & Day Hike on Isle Royale National Park:\n\nIf you neither want to backpack nor kayak camp, worry not! There are two base camping options available on Isle Royale National Park. Both Rock Harbor Lodge and Windigo offer overnight stays in cabins/lodges, and the Washington Creek campground is within walking distance of Windigo.\n\nBase camping at Windigo offers good trail access to the interior of the island and paddling on Washington Harbor, and a more woodsy and less coastal feel. Rock Harbor offers access to coastal trails, less rustic lodging and more amenities.\n\nIs it Possible to Day Trip to Isle Royale National Park?\n\nYes, you can day trip to Isle Royale National Park if leaving from Minnesota! Departing from Grand Portage, MN on the Isle Royale Ferry Line, you can ferry to Windigo for four hours on the island. In this time, you might have enough time to hike to the Grace Creek Overlook, paddle Washington Harbor, or fish Washington Harbor (valid Michigan fishing license required for Lake Superior, but not for inland lakes).\n\nIt takes about an hour and a half to reach Isle Royale via ferry from Grand Portage. In my opinion, four hours on the island is really not enough. I spent 12 days on the island and that wasn’t enough. Note that it is not possible to day trip to Isle Royale if departing from Michigan.\n\nIf you’re visiting Isle Royale leaving from Minnesota, check out some of the best things to do on Minnesota’s North Shore!\n\nWhere can I see moose on Isle Royale?\n\nYou can see moose everywhere on Isle Royale. If you are on the island for an extended period of time, it is very likely you will see a moose. We saw moose right on the trail between Windigo and Washington Creek Camp, one of the busiest trails in the island. We also saw moose at Blake Point from the camp at Meritt Lane, the northernmost point on the island. There was moose evidence everywhere throughout the island, and more moose at Chippewa Harbor. When in Isle Royale National Park, you’re in moose habitat.\n\nIsle Royale is a dream for backpackers, paddlers, and wildlife photographers alike.\n\nThere are very few places left in the lower 48 states that are truly this wild, and this isolated from the rest of the world. I spent an incredible 11 days there (and one very scary 12th day) and will head back out there the first chance I get.\n\ncheck out the Midwest Adventure eBook Bundle for over 300+ pages of detailed adventure planning including hidden waterfalls, the best campsites, off-the-beaten-path adventures, and more covering Sleeping Bear to the end of the Gunflint Trail and everything in-between!\n\nWhat to pack for a trip to Isle Royale National Park:\n\nIsle Royale National Park experiences cooler summers than other Great Lakes destinations! Pack for a variety of weather.\n\n2 lightweight, long hiking pants. I wear a size 8 and am short, and find the REI trailmade to be super flattering as well as the Kuhl freeflex.\n\nA pair of shorts, and yoga pants with pockets\n\nA fleece. Any fleece will do, but I really love my Patagonia Synchilla\n\nWool baselayers. Five years of heavy paddling and my Smartwool baselayers are the only wool baselayers I’ve had that have really stood the test of time. For seven days, pack four baselayer tops.\n\nStudy hiking boots. I like my Briger Mids. Working in outdoor retail I literally never had anyone try on these shoes and not buy them. Pair with Darn Tough hiking socks and pack at least five pairs. In the alpine areas, trekking poles are also a great choice!\n\nhiking sandals\n\nQuick dry shots: I like Patagonia Baggies\n\nA puffy jacket. It can be cool even in the summer near the lakeshore, especially evenings. My partner Andy (also a wilderness guide) swears by the Patagonia Nano Puff. I like my Helly Hansen Liftloft.\n\nIf camping, a tent, packable sleeping bag (Nemo Disco) and pad (comfortable sleeping pad): Read my budget tent recommendations here!\n\nA day hiking pack: I love my Perimeter 35L. I was gifted this pack a few years back and it’s still my go-to day pack; a savvy packer can easily pack for a seven day hiking trip in this bag.\n\nA raincoat. I love the Moss Raincoat from Helly Hansen; It’s affordable, cute, and super durable.\n\nA National Parks Pass (also covers national forest use)\n\nLove reading about how to visit Isle Royale National Park?
