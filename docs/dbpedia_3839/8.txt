Experience the northwoods at the remote Isle Royale National Park, located in northwestern Lake Superior. One of the least visited National Parks, Isle Royale is accessible only by boat or seaplane. The park is home to moose, wolves, loons, beaver, fox, and birdlife. Lake Superior and the island's inland lakes offer excellent fishing and photographic sites for viewing pristine forest and waterways. There are also diving opportunities abound to many shipwrecks of Lake Superior.
