Some years ago, Tobias was strolling through the arts market in his hometown of Dusseldorf, Germany. Inspired by the friendliness of everybody and his love for this city full of artists, he enjoyed himself finding some new ideas, he could use for his own work.

​

By the way - Dusseldorf is a beautiful city in western germany, famous for its old town, great beer and super friendly but hard working people.

There have been so many booths offering food and crafts, that Tobi was quite overwhelmed. Just the moment when he wanted to leave, a tiny stall right at the end of the market caught his attention. The seller presented only two drawings, but both of them had some very special effects, so Tobias decided to have a closer look. The artwork was a combination of a typical painting with some interesting material integrated. The artist was more than willing to explain his work and Tobi knew that that was the day that brought a new passion into his life: epoxy!

Like a butterfly hatching from the streets of Art in Dusseldorf, Tobis idea of combining traditional woods with this modern material, rose.

​

Since then he produced real masterpieces for numerous of customers and proudly presents dreams come true in top quality and a mixture of natural products and chemical components.

This is what Wikipedia tells us about Expoxy resin:

Condensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934. Claims of discovery of bisphenol-A-based epoxy resins include the Swiss Pierre Castan in 1943. Castan's work was licensed by Ciba, Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. Ciba's epoxy business was spun off as Vantico in the late 1990s, which was subsequently sold in 2003 and became the Advanced Materials business unit of Huntsman Corporation of the United States.

So the product originated in Germany/Switzerland and became American. Same as Tobias ;-).

​

Epoxy resin, mixed with pigment, may be used as a painting medium, by pouring layers on top of each other to form a complete picture. It is also used in jewelry, as a doming resin for decorations and labels, and in decoupage type applications for art, countertops, and tables.
