        "text": "Yes No\n\nSeal Coat\n\nFor porous surfaces such as wood, UltraClear Epoxy is applied in two stages, the Seal Coat stage and the Flood Coat stage. Both stages use the same exact epoxy.\n\nThe seal coat is a small batch of the same epoxy that is simply brushed on in a thin layer to seal any pores in the surface and prevent air bubbles from forming in the following flood coat. The flood coat is poured 4 hours after the seal coat and will self level to 1/8\".\n\nHow To Calculate Epoxy Coverage\n\nOur epoxy calculator will do it’s best to calculate the amount of epoxy needed for adequate coverage over your surface. It does this by accounting for the square footage of the project, epoxy seal coats, surface depth, and any epoxy that will be lost over the sides when pouring epoxy over the edges.\n\nOne gallon of epoxy is 1/2 gallon resin and 1/2 gallon hardener. When mixed together it will cover approximately 16 sq.ft. at 1/8\" for a flood coat and as a separate measurement it will cover approximately 48 sq.ft. for a seal coat. It can do either the seal coat of epoxy or the flood coat of epoxy but it will not do both.\n\nWhat is an Epoxy Seal Coat?\n\nThe seal coat is a small batch of epoxy that is brushed on in a thin layer to seal any pores in the wood surface to prevent air bubbles from forming in the following epoxy flood coat.\n\nThe seal coat uses the same exact epoxy resin as the flood coat, it’s mixed the same exact way except it is applied by a paint brush instead of pouring it like the flood coat.\n\nSurface Depth\n\nOur Bar & Table Top Epoxy is designed to be poured across the surface and self level at 1/8\" per application which is called the epoxy flood coat. This thickness of epoxy is twice as thick as most epoxies on the market, and is standard for all commercial bar tops, restaurant tables, and professional countertop installations. For those projects which require a thicker application of epoxy, multiple layers must be poured at one layer every 4 hours up to 1\" thick.\n\nFor any epoxy thickness greater than 1\" we would recommend using our Deep Pour Epoxy which can be poured up to 2\" in a single pour. This will save you time and effort to achieve this depth.\n\nSides and Edge\n\nUnless the project will be dammed or framed, an overflow allowance must be accounted for in the epoxy calculation. Our epoxy calculator does this for you.\n\nUltraClear epoxy is formulated to be poured right over the edge of a surface without having a border or a raised edge all the way around. Since the epoxy is thick, it will self-level on the surface and drip over the edges coating the sides. The epoxy will not hang down like icicles as it will go over the edges and under the lip about 1/4\" to 1/2\". After the epoxy hardens, you can come back and sand underneath any hardened epoxy that has formed with a sanding sponge.\n\nBetter Safe Than Sorry\n\nIt’s always better to overestimate rather than underestimate the amount of epoxy you will need. This is especially important when pouring epoxy over a bar top, countertop, or other large surfaces since it will be next to impossible to have a perfectly seamless epoxy surface if you run out of material during your pour. You would most likely need to start over by purchasing more epoxy to completely fix it, which can be avoided simply by rounding up when ordering."
