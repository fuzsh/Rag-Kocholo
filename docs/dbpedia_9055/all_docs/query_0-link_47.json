Everybody that hires him is always left satisfied.\"\n\nMariah\n\n\"I came to Spokane Epoxy with a pretty open ended need for basement floors. After meeting, I was completely convinced that this was the way to go. They knew what prep and product my floors needed and why and he even came over the day before and we poured a sample together so I could see how everything would look before I committed to my entire floor. We used the color titanium with 5 accent colors and it looks stunning. Everything went according to plan and was finished within the original time frame. I'm so happy with the final result and love knowing that I'll have not only beautiful, but also maintenance free floors forever!\""
