        "text": "Resinin Grip Original can be used for PCB coating, conformal coating, PCB protection and all electrical and electronic coatings. It is a high-performance, double-component epoxy coating that protects the PCB from moisture corrosion and mechanical damage.\n\nResinin Grip Original is an advanced material with a wide variety of applications in the field of electronics. It provides excellent protection against environmental factors such as humidity, water, oils, some acids, some bases and atmospheric gases. Resinin Grip Original can be applied to both the top surface or bottom surface of a board to provide protection against moisture penetration through solder joints or through holes in the board's ground plane\n\nThis product has excellent adhesive properties which make it suitable for applications in demanding environments like avionics and military equipment.\n\nElectrical circuit boards (a.k.a. PCB) are exposed to a variety of harsh environments. This can lead to short circuits and other problems. To protect the board, a thin layer of protective material is applied. This process is called PCB coating or Epoxy coating.\n\nThe PCB coating process is a very important step in the production of any electronic device. The coating prevents corrosion and contamination from damaging the PCB.\n\nYou can use Grip Original in 2 methods:\n\nMethod 1:\n\nMeasure: The first step is to measure out the amount of epoxy you need to coat your PCB with. You should measure out about 2 mm of epoxy per square cm of board surface area, and then pour it on the board evenly. You can use our Epoxy Calculator for measure.\n\nMix: Next, mix together the resin and hardener in a disposable cup or container, following the user manual. Make sure that they are thoroughly mixed before pouring them onto your PCB.\n\nPour: Finally, pour the mixed resin and hardener onto your PCB while making sure that they are evenly spread out.\n\nWait: The PCB needs to be left for a certain amount of time before it can be handled. The epoxy needs to cure, which takes about 24 hours. A good rule of thumb is to allow the epoxy to cure for at least 24 hours before handling the PCB.\n\nMethod 2:\n\nIf you want to cure in a shor time then there is another way of curing Grip Original. Baking in 70-80 degrees for 10-30 minutes. This process applies heat to the board which causes the curing agent to react and harden the epoxy coating, creating a protective layer on the board.\n\nIt is important to mix the epoxy resin and hardener at the right ratio to ensure that the adhesive will set properly. The mixing ratio for Grip Original is\n\n2:1 by weight\n\n100:55 by volume\n\nYou can mix Grip Original epoxy resin with a ratio of 2 parts hardener to 1 part resin by weight or 100 parts hardener to 55 parts resin, both are the right methods.\n\nWhen you use the mixing ratio by weight, you should use a scale. When you are using the mix ratio by volume, you should use measuring cups. If you are not sure which one to use, we recommend that you use the scale because it is more accurate.\n\nThe Grip Original epoxy resin is a two-component system which means it needs two separate components, hardener and resin, to form a strong bond. To calculate the amount of epoxy resin to use, you need to know how many resin you will need.\n\nOur Epoxy Calculator page can help you calculate the epoxy mixing ratio for your project. All you need to do is enter the dimensions of your project and our calculator will do the rest.\n\nGrip Original is a two-part epoxy resin that can be cured at room temperature. All you need to do is mix the two components together and then pour it on your PCB. This epoxy has an excellent grip and it can be used for many different purposes.\n\nThe Grip Original epoxy resin is easy to use for beginners, but it also has many advanced features that make it perfect for professionals. It has high strength, low viscosity, and good adhesion properties. All you need to do is follow the steps in the user manual and you will be able to complete your project without any difficulty.\n\nEpoxy is a strong, hard and versatile material. It can be used in many different applications and is one of the most popular materials for PCBs. Epoxy has many properties that make it an excellent choice for PCBs and other applications. One of these properties is its resistance to many fluids.\n\nGrip Original is a type of epoxy that has additional features to resist acids and bases as well as other types of fluids. This is an excellent choice for applications that interact with many substances.\n\nGrip Original resists acids, bases, water, and oils, making it perfect for use in PCBs or any application where there are liquids present that could damage the other coating chemicals over time."
