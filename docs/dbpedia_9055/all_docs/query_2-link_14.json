The population was 15,378 at the 2010 census. It is located just southwest of Grand Rapids and is part of the metropolitan area.\n\nThe area was first settled by Native Americans, including the Ottawa, Ojibwa, and Potawatomi tribes. The first European settler was John B. Campau, who built a sawmill on the Grand River in 1833. The town was initially named “Grandville” after Campau’s hometown in France.\n\nGrandville increased in the 1840s and 1850s as a center for logging and agriculture. The city was incorporated in 1855.

The cons include a lengthier curing period, a demanding installation process, and the risk of slipperiness when wet.

Clearly, the advantages of epoxy floors outweigh the disadvantages, making them a preferred choice for practicality and elegance.\n\nDoes an epoxy floor increase home value?\n\nElevate your home's value effortlessly with epoxy flooring.

This careful approach guarantees a strong, resilient surface, allowing you to explore your transformed garage confidently.\n\nWhat does it cost to coat a garage floor?\n\nThe cost of garage floor coating can vary based on a few key factors. It depends on the size of your home improvement project, any existing damage that requires repairs before the epoxy coating, and the quality of the coatings used. Typically, you'll find prices ranging from $5 to $12 per square foot. To offer a rough estimate, coating a single-car concrete garage floor might fall in the range of approximately $1000 to $3000.\n\nSTANDING BEHIND\n\nEVERY PROJECT\n\nSTANDING BEHIND EVERY PROJECT\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nWHAT OTHER HOMEOWNERS SAY\n\nWHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT?\n\nAt Premier Edge Concrete Solutions, we understand that quality matters - the job has to be done right.

It offers a high-impact decorative finish, is incredibly durable and long lasting, and can help create a highly functional space.\n\nThe primary benefits of epoxy flooring include:\n\n1) Durability: Epoxy floors are incredibly resistant to impact damage from objects such as heavy items like furniture or machinery falling onto the floor. This makes them perfect for busy environments that experience a lot of foot and wheeled traffic such as airports or warehouses where they can last up to 10 years with proper maintenance.\n\n2) Chemical Resistance: Epoxies are also highly resistant to the corrosive effects of chemicals which makes them ideal for factories where harsh cleaning solutions may be used on the floors regularly, helping reduce time spent changing the surface or repairing damages due to those materials. Not only do they resist acidic materials but are also slip-resistant when wet making them safer places to work in hazardous conditions.\n\n3) Ease of Cleaning & Maintenance: Since these surfaces form a continuous seal over an entire space you will not have grout lines that could potentially gather dirt over time thus ensuring easy cleaning solutions such as sweeping and mopping that don't require expensive cleaners or power washers typically used on tile floors.\n\nCan you put epoxy flooring in my basement?\n\nAbsolutely! Applying basement epoxy flooring is an excellent choice for a number of reasons. It's highly durable and lasts longer than alternative flooring options, making it ideal for high-traffic or heavily used areas like basements. Epoxy also resists water seepage, mold growth, and staining - all key factors when it comes to keeping your basement dry and safe from moisture damage.\n\nIs garage floor epoxy durable?\n\nYes, garage floor epoxy is incredibly durable! It’s one of the most durable and long-lasting types of coatings, and depending on the product you choose, it can last up to 10 years when properly applied. In fact, not only is it highly resistant to chemicals such as automotive fluids and grease, but it also offers protection against scratches and abrasion.\n\nFor best results, an epoxy coating should be applied by a professional contractor who has experience in this field. They will make sure that all cracks are filled in before applying the epoxy coating so that it adheres better to your concrete surface. Furthermore, because garage floors are commonly subject to foot traffic as well as constant temperature fluctuations due to their proximity to outdoor elements like sunlight or snowfall - additional layers of sealants can help prolong your epoxy's life span even further!\n\nIn addition to offering great durability for your garage flooring needs, using epoxy coatings also gives any space a sleek and modern look- turning any dull-looking area into something beautiful! With many color options available ranging from standard colors like light grey or beige tones - or more vivid colors such as pink or blue (perfect for man caves) – there’s something out there suited for everyone’s taste and needs.\n\nHow long does a garage floor coating last?\n\nGarage floor coatings can last anywhere from 3 to 20 years depending on several factors, including the type of coating applied, how often it is maintained, and what kind of environment it is exposed to. For instance, water-based epoxy coatings with two layers will generally last between 5 and 8 years. Whereas a polyurea or polyaspartic coating may have a longer lifespan of up to fifteen years. Additionally, if your garage floor has an unusually harsh environment due to road salt in winter climates or contamination from automotive fluids like oil and gasoline that are regularly spilled in garages, the longevity of your floor's coating may be drastically reduced.\n\nWith proper maintenance, however, you can expect any garage floor coating to last for at least its advertised lifespan. This includes regularly cleaning spills off the surface as soon as they occur using a non-abrasive cleaning solution and dry mops; roughening up any glossy areas with sandpaper; avoiding having hot tires roll across painted surfaces; sealing any cracks before applying coatings; ensuring good air circulation throughout your space so condensation won’t form on the concrete surface; and finally re-applying sealers every few months depending on the amount of traffic going through the area. All these practices can go a long way toward ensuring that your garage floor coating looks great for as many years as possible!\n\nWhat type of coating is best for basement floors?\n\nChoosing the right type of coating for your basement floor can depend on many factors such as the condition of the concrete, the use of the basement, and your aesthetic preferences. However, two commonly recommended options are epoxy coatings and concrete stains.\n\nEpoxy coatings are highly durable, resistant to moisture, and can withstand heavy traffic, making them a popular choice for basements that are used frequently or for specific purposes like a home gym or workshop. They also come in a wide range of colors and finishes, including options that can make your floor look like granite or marble. However, epoxy can be tricky to apply correctly, so it may not be the best choice for a DIY project unless you have experience with this type of work.\n\nConcrete stains, on the other hand, penetrate the concrete and create a permanent color that won't chip or peel. They can give your basement a warm, natural look that's hard to achieve with other types of coatings. Stains are available in a variety of colors and can be applied in creative ways to achieve a unique look. They're also easier to apply than epoxy, making them a good choice for homeowners who want to do the work themselves. However, they don't offer as much protection as epoxy, so they may not be the best choice for basements that see heavy use.\n\nRemember, no matter what type of coating you choose, proper preparation of the concrete surface is key to getting good results. It's also important to consider how the coating will react with any existing paint or sealant on the floor.\n\nWhat is residential epoxy flooring and why should I care?\n\nResidential epoxy flooring is a type of floor coating that is made from a combination of resin and hardeners. When these two components are mixed together, they form a rigid plastic material that is extremely durable and resistant to wear and tear. Epoxy flooring is commonly used in commercial and industrial settings because of its strength and durability, but it is also becoming increasingly popular in residential homes.\n\nOne of the main reasons to consider residential epoxy flooring is its longevity. It can withstand heavy traffic, resist damage from spills and stains, and require minimal maintenance, making it a cost-effective option in the long run. Moreover, it can be customized with a wide variety of colors and designs, allowing homeowners to achieve a unique look that matches their personal style and decor.\n\nAnother key benefit of epoxy flooring is its resistance to moisture, which makes it an excellent choice for areas like basements, garages, and laundry rooms where water damage can be a concern. It's also easy to clean and doesn't harbor dust mites or other allergens, making it a good choice for people with allergies. Overall, residential epoxy flooring offers a combination of durability, aesthetics, and ease of maintenance that can make it a valuable addition to any home.\n\nHow long does epoxy floor coating last?\n\nEpoxy floor coating is a popular choice for many homeowners and businesses due to its durability, aesthetic appeal, and ease of maintenance. One of the most common questions about this type of flooring is regarding its lifespan. Generally speaking, a professionally installed epoxy floor coating can last between 5 to 10 years in high-traffic commercial or industrial environments, and up to 20 to 30 years in residential settings. However, the actual lifespan can vary greatly depending on several factors.\n\nThe longevity of an epoxy floor coating is heavily influenced by the quality of the installation process and the conditions it's exposed to. If the epoxy is correctly applied on a well-prepared surface, it will adhere properly and last longer. On the other hand, improper application or preparation can lead to peeling or chipping, which shortens the lifespan of the coating. The amount of traffic the floor receives also plays a significant role. Floors in high-traffic areas like commercial or industrial spaces may wear out faster than those in residential homes.\n\nMoreover, the maintenance practices employed can significantly impact the lifespan of an epoxy floor coating. Regular cleaning and timely repair of any minor damages can help extend the life of the coating. Using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaning tools can damage the surface and reduce its lifespan. Therefore, while epoxy floor coatings are known for their durability, their longevity still largely depends on how they're installed, used, and maintained.\n\nCan garage flooring withstand heavy loads, like cars or gym equipment?\n\nGarage flooring, particularly when constructed with high-quality materials such as epoxy or polyurea, is specifically designed to withstand heavy loads, including cars and gym equipment. These materials create a hard, durable surface that can handle the weight of heavy objects without suffering damage. They also have excellent impact resistance, which means they can absorb the shock of dropped weights or tools without cracking or chipping.\n\nEpoxy and polyurea garage floor coatings are not only strong but also resistant to a variety of potentially damaging substances. They can resist oil stains, chemical spills, and hot tire pick-up, making them ideal for use in garages where vehicles are regularly parked. Similarly, if you're using your garage as a home gym, these floorings can hold up against the constant pressure and movement of heavy gym equipment.\n\nHowever, while these garage floor coatings are incredibly durable, their lifespan and ability to withstand heavy loads also depend on the quality of the installation. A properly prepared and installed floor coating will be more durable and long-lasting. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that your garage floor is installed by a professional who can adequately prepare the surface and apply the coating correctly. With the right installation and proper care, your garage floor should be able to handle heavy loads without issue.\n\nWhat are the benefits of epoxy cement floors?\n\nEpoxy cement floors offer a myriad of benefits that contribute to their popularity in both residential and commercial settings. One key advantage is their exceptional durability and resistance to heavy foot traffic, making them well-suited for high-traffic areas such as industrial facilities, warehouses, and garages. Additionally, the non-porous and seamless nature of epoxy floors makes them highly resistant to chemicals, stains, and moisture, providing a long-lasting and easy-to-clean surface. Moreover, the ability to customize epoxy floors with various colors, patterns, and textures adds an aesthetic appeal to spaces, making them a versatile and visually attractive flooring option.\n\nFurthermore, epoxy cement floors are known for their slip-resistant properties, enhancing safety in environments where slip and fall accidents are a concern. This feature, combined with their resistance to mold, mildew, and bacteria growth, makes them suitable for spaces like bathrooms and kitchens, contributing to a hygienic and safe living or working environment. Overall, the numerous benefits of epoxy cement floors make them a practical and advantageous choice for diverse applications, ranging from industrial facilities to residential spaces.\n\nHow much does the average epoxy flooring cost?\n\nThe cost of epoxy flooring can vary widely based on several factors, including the size of the area to be covered, the type of epoxy used, and whether the application is done professionally or as a do-it-yourself project. According to multiple sources, professional epoxy floor installation typically ranges from $1 to $12 per square foot. This price includes labor and materials. However, these are average costs, and the actual price can fluctuate depending on specific circumstances and local market conditions.\n\nFor those considering a do-it-yourself approach, the costs can be significantly lower. DIY epoxy application averages between $2 to $5 per square foot. While this method can be more cost-effective, it requires careful preparation and application to ensure a durable and attractive result. Regardless of the approach chosen, the key to a successful epoxy floor is proper preparation and application.\n\nWhat to expect from Premier Edge\n\nfast quote\n\nWe know how crazy life can be.
