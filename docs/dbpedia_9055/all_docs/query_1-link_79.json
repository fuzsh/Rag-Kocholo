        "text": "ICIS launches South Korea domestic PP block copolymer index on 16 August\n\nSINGAPORE (ICIS)–ICIS is introducing a new monthly domestic polypropylene (PP) block copolymer price index for South Korea starting from 16 August. This spot assessment on a delivered (DEL) basis is ICIS' first monthly index dedicated to the South Korean market. The new quote will track locally traded PP block copolymer resins with melt index (MI) between 30 to 60 that are mainly used for automotive applications. The launch of the quote is motivated by calls for more information and greater clarity on the domestic market conditions from South Korea's automotive industry as local prices deviate from export values. Previously, market participants have been using CFR (cost & freight) CMP (China Main Port) and prices of upstream chemicals like naphtha's, as reference points for domestic discussions. “ICIS has developed an index that is relevant for the South Korean domestic market,” ICIS Asia managing editor Peh Soo Hwee said. “This is in line with changing industry developments as taking direction from overseas markets such as China is no longer fit-for-purpose given the very different dynamics in Korea,” she said.\n\nBLOG: Global HDPE, the value of facts over commentary and the importance of scenario planning\n\nSINGAPORE (ICIS)–Click here to see the latest blog post on Asian Chemical Connections by John Richardson. The ICIS data continue to tell us that we are facing the biggest shake-up in the modern history of the petrochemicals industry. Let’s today use high-density polyethylene (HDPE) China accounted for just 6% of global HDPE demand in 1992 although it had a 22% share of the global population. By the end of 2024, we expect China to generate 33% of global demand from an 18% share of the population. For far too long, our industry overlooked the warning signs: China’s rapidly ageing population, its real estate bubble and the geopolitical split with the West. It was only a question of when rather than whether the Chinese economy would enter a more challenging phase. We can see from the ICIS data on spreads and margins that the “when” arrived in late 2021 – the Evergrande Moment. CFR China HDPE injection grade price spreads over CFR Japan naphtha costs have averaged just $212/tonne since the end of Petrochemicals Supercycle – from January 2022 onwards. This compares with the $487/tonne average during the Supercycle – 1992 until 2021. So, spreads need to rebound by 130% to get back to where they were during the Supercycle. This year, as we can see from the chart in today’s post, they have fallen to a new record low. Global capacity was added largely on the assumption that China’s HDPE demand growth would be higher than is going to be the case. My highly unscientific “wisdom of crowds” approach, which involved talking to lots of people, suggests that the consensus view was that China’s petrochemicals demand growth in general would be at 6-8% over the long term. Low single digit growth now seems more likely. Global HDPE operating rates were very healthy during the Petrochemicals Supercycle. Including two years after the end of the Supercycle (the 1992-2023 period), we estimate they averaged 88%. We forecast a global operating rate of just 75% in 2024-2030. Global capacity would have to grow by just 173,000 tonnes a year versus our base case assumption of 2.6m tonnes a year if 2024-2030 were instead to reach 88%. Rationalisation of capacity in disadvantaged regions such as Europe and Asia ex-China seems likely as China, the Middle East and the US carry on building. So much for what we know. What about the “unknown unknowns”? Here are just two of them: What will be the size of China’s population by the end of the century and therefore its HDPE and other resins demand? Estimates range from 633m to 525m or even less. Can China fully maintain its role as the Workshop of the World? Or will reshoring and trade tensions eventually lead to a major decline in Chinese exports? Facts, or rather data, are sacred. So should be rigorous scenario planning as “one size fits all” views of the future won’t get us anywhere. Neither will a repeat of the conventional thinking that got us into this mess in the first place. Editor’s note: This blog post is an opinion piece.

Both segments gained market share and benefited from inventory restocking in certain end-markets, CEO Ashish Khandpur and CFO Jamie Beggs told analysts during Avient’s Q2 earnings call on Tuesday. Tight cost control and raw material price deflation helped expand the adjusted EBITDA margin by 100 basis points year on year to 16.9% in the second quarter, they said. The better-than-expected performance was led by CAI, which saw improved demand and favorable raw material costs. MARKETS In terms of end-markets, growing sales into two of Avient’s largest markets, packaging (+8%) and consumer (+10%), had the greatest impact in the second quarter, said Khandpur. Both markets benefited from “some restocking”, particularly in Europe, he added. Sales growth in buildings and construction and healthcare was also strong. Although the macroeconomic indicators for building and construction remained weak, both the SEM and CAI segments gained market share and won new business in the US and Canada, Khandpur said. Meanwhile, destocking in the healthcare market has finally run its course, with Avient’s sales into that market up 10% year on year in the second quarter. Sales into the defense end-market continued to be driven by the global conflicts and certain NATO programs, with full-year sales growth expected in the low double digits, he said. The telecommunications and energy markets, which together account for about 7% of Avient’s total sales, however, remained “challenged”, with sales down in the double digits in the second quarter as customers reduced inventories. Telecommunications should improve in the second half as demand in the US has started to improve more recently, Khandpur said. In energy, Avient is seeing improving trends in the third quarter, in particular for applications designed to improve the reliability of the electrical transmission grid, he said. Artificial intelligence (AI) was raising electricity consumption, driving demand for electricity generation and distribution, with positive derivative effects on the materials Avient supplies to energy markets, he noted. Electric mobility and electrification are happening, and Avient aims to “become part of those fast-growing markets”, he added. LATIN AMERICA OPPORTUNITY Avient’s sales in Latin America grew by 19% year on year in the second quarter, driven by sales into the region's packaging market. That market saw strong demand in food & beverage and cleaning applications on the back of the recent floods in Brazil, as well as high temperatures and drought conditions in Mexico. Latin America currently accounts for only about 6% of the company’s total sales. However, going forward, Avient expects its Latin American packaging business to benefit from the near-shoring trend. The company’s position in the region is “strategic”, allowing it to serve original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and brand owners who are looking to near-shore production and supply chains in light of global trade conflicts and political uncertainties, Beggs noted. RAW MATERIALS Avient realized about $35 million in raw material price deflation in the first half of 2024, Beggs said. However, the company does not expect this benefit to be repeated in the second half as it has started to see “modest levels of inflation” across the majority of its raw materials, including polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), as well as pigments and certain performance additives, she said. Primary raw materials used in Avient’s manufacturing operations include polyolefin and other thermoplastic resins, titanium oxide (TiO2), inorganic and organic pigments, specialty additives and ethylene. The executives did not comment on the current stock market turmoil and analysts on Tuesday’s call did not ask about this.

In the January-June period, Brazil imported $28.8 billion of chemicals, down 7.5% year on year, while exports stood at $7.1 billion, down 4.8%. In H1 2023, the chemicals trade deficit stood at $23.7 billion and, for the full-year, it stood at $47.0 billion, the second highest figure in the past 35 years, according to Abiquim. Although the deficit narrowed, Abiquim was not pleased and linked the improvement to lower priced imports which, it said, continue denting domestic producers' market share. “This apparent improvement in the chemicals trade deficit is directly related to imports with prices 15.3% lower than in the first half of 2023, leveraging purchases of products on the international market at prices largely below the production costs practiced in Brazil,” said the trade group. “These products come mainly from Asian countries, whose competitiveness has been sustained by Russian raw materials purchased at favorable prices due to the war in east Europe.” Abiquim has demanded high import tariffs on several chemicals for the past few months; in an interview with ICIS, its director general Andre Passos said higher tariffs were only one of the three legs of a wider plan to protect domestic producers' market share. In June, Brazil’s chemicals trade unions joined Abiquim to demand higher tariffs. “To show the worrying sings, it is enough to highlight the volume in tonnes of these imports [entering Brazil] in the first half at 27.9 million tonnes, up 9.1% year on year. Highlights include the aggressive increases in thermoplastic resins imports (up 41.2%), thermosetting resins (26.8%), intermediates for thermosetting resins (35.8%), intermediates for synthetic fibers (22.1%) and other organic chemical products (15.2%),” said the trade group. “This scenario is a serious threat to the national production of chemical products and has, above all, deteriorated the level of utilization rates [which stood in May at a record low of 58%]. Some companies are considering hibernating plants, shutdowns, and even deactivation of units.”\n\nEurope top stories: weekly summary\n\nLONDON (ICIS)–Here are some of the top stories from ICIS Europe for the week ended 19 July. Europe PX to face weaker downstream demand, support from higher freight costs The European paraxylene (PX) industry is heading towards the second half of the year sandwiched between the news of structural downstream production cuts and the temporary support from high freight rates from Asia, which is making domestic production of PX derivatives more appealing than imports.

Flat chemical prices to increase in coming quarters; volumes booming – US HB Fuller Most chemical prices have stabilized, and a few are posting small rises, a trend which should strengthen in coming quarters as global manufacturing picks up, executives at US-headquartered adhesives producer HB Fuller said on Thursday. SHIPPING: Panama Canal increases drafts, to add another transit slot on 5 August The Panama Canal Authority (PCA) has increased the maximum allowable draft to transit the Neopanamax locks effective immediately, announced that another increase will take effect on 11 July, and will add an additional booking slot in the Neopanamax locks during Booking Period 2 for booking dates beginning 5 August.\n\nFlat chemical prices to increase in coming quarters; volumes booming – US HB Fuller\n\nSAO PAULO (ICIS)–Most chemical prices have stabilized, and a few are posting small rises, a trend which should strengthen in coming quarters as global manufacturing picks up, executives at US-headquartered adhesives producer HB Fuller said on Thursday. Celeste Mastin, CEO at the company, said sales volumes in Q2 had posted a “strong performance” and came higher than initially expected, with regions such as Europe also improving and some sectors in China “growing like crazy”. The improvement in manufacturing prospects globally prompted HB Fuller to increase its 2024 financial guidance earlier this week after it published its Q2 financial results, which showed sales rose by 2%, year on year, and earnings by 10.1%. As an adhesives producer, HB Fuller's raw materials include tackifying resins, polymers, synthetic rubber, plasticizers and vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). The company’s fiscal year starts on 1 December; its fiscal Q2 covers March-May. EARLIER THAN PLANNED RECOVERYAfter its longest downturn ever, chemicals may finally be savoring the green shoots of a recovery in earnest. HB Fuller, at least, is. According to Mastin, the notable improvement in Q2 foresees a healthier second half of the year, with the improvement across all the company’s divisions and regions it operates in. “We have had a strong volume performance and, actually, we were planning volume growth in the mid-single digits for the second half, but we are already seing that, which explains Q2 [performance],” she said, speaking to reporters and chemical equity analysts. “We track the prices of 4,000 raw materials – 80% they are flat or increasing slightly. We think from Q3 onward the trend will be for increases over time.” HB Fuller’s upbeat assessment contrasts with what the company issued after its fiscal Q1. At the time, Mastin said sales volumes were still weak and, if that situation persisted, prices of specialty chemicals, which had so far held up reasonably well, could also fall. The improvement as of late has prompted the company to also raise its selling prices forecast – from an initially expected negative pricing impact of 2-3%, the company now forecasts a negative impact of 1-2%. Those pricing negative effects, however, will be overcome by growth in sales volumes, the CEO said. Mastin went on to say the automotive sector is one where HB Fuller is “aggressively” trying to gain market share, adding the strategy is paying off with sales volumes up between 20% and 30% compared with last year. “In China, we have a very strong position in automotive. But we are seeing healthy performance in other sectors as well, such glass, aerospace, or electronics – the latter is growing like crazy there. Equally, we are also seeing strong growth in India,” said Mastin. HB Fuller’s CFO, John Corkrean, also present at the press conference, added that, after a poor Q1, even the beleaguered European economy – under pressure since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the consequent energy prices shock – also showed some positive signs in Q2. “We have seen a return to volume growth in all market segments. Some spots such as hygiene remain a weak spot, but we have also seen there an improvement from Q1 and we expect to see further improvement in the next two quarters,” said Corkrean. “Europe was slow in Q1 but that improved in Q2 in , for example, the construction-related businesses. These are positive signs we expect will continue in coming quarters.” Front page picture shows glue being applied Source: Shutterstock\n\nBrazil’s chemicals unions join companies demanding higher tariffs on ‘unprecedented’ crisis\n\nSAO PAULO (ICIS)–Brazil’s chemicals producers, represented by trade group Abiquim, have gotten on board with peer groups and trade unions in their lobbying for higher import tariffs for dozens of products as the government’s decision looms. Led by Abiquim, a total of 28 trade groups, trade unions, industrial development groups, one professional association and one company have signed a manifesto pleading for higher import tariffs to safeguard an industry which, in their view, is being threatened by lower priced imports which are produced with lower environmental standards. “The Brazilian chemicals input production chain, fundamental to the country's economic and technological development, faces unprecedented challenges that threaten its very existence and the future of sustainable solutions for Brazilian industry,” said the manifesto. “Ensuring measures to protect the trade balance is vital to maintain the operation of the chemical chain and attract new investments.” In May, chemicals producers – via Abiquim but also as individual companies – proposed increasing tariffs in more than 100 chemicals, most of them from 12.6% to 20%, in a public consultation held by the Brazil’s government body the Chamber of Foreign Commerce (Camex). A decision is expected in August as the latest. Other trade groups in the chemicals chain, such as Abiplast, representing plastics transformers, do not support higher tariffs as most of their members import product to meet their demand, and are doing their own lobbying not to increase tariffs. ABIQUIM LOBBYING GETS PARTNERSAs well as Abiquim, other trade groups within chemicals signed the document, such the Brazilian Association of Alkali, Chlorine, and Derivatives Industry (Abiclor); the Brazilian Association of Fine Chemical, Biotechnology and Specialty Industries (Abifina); and the Brazilian Association of Artificial and Synthetic Fiber Producers (Abrafas) also signed the document. In total, 11 trade groups and 12 trade unions signed the document, as well as industrial development groups and other players in the chemicals chain. See bottom for full list of signatories. The backing of the unions is important because it is likely to resonate in the corridors of power in Brasilia, where the left-leaning government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva got into office thanks in part to the votes of the industrial workers constituency who voted for Lula’s Workers Party (PT) in 2023 under the promise of more and better paid industrial jobs. “The Brazilian chemicals input production chain, fundamental to the country's economic and technological development, faces unprecedented challenges that threaten its very existence and the future of sustainable solutions for Brazilian industry. Ensuring measures to protect the trade balance is vital to maintain the operation of the chemical chain and attract new investments,” said the manifesto. “What we are witnessing by allowing a surge in imports of products without environmental commitments is the failure to comply with a global agenda, with negative contributions to the fight against climate change.” As the left-leaning Lula cabinet aims to increase public spending, the manifesto also touches on Abiquim’s calculations in the decrease in tax receipts by the Brazilian Treasury in 2023, as a consequence of lower imports – the trade group said the state’s receipts decreased during that year by Brazilian reais (R) 8.0 billion ($1.45 billion). “[The decrease in tax receipts] directly impacts investments in the production sector and in several other areas of public policy. Continuing to allow the unbridled entry of chemical products is a paradox for the policy that Brazil has planned in the context of neo-industrialization, while imports already account for 50% of demand in the chemicals industry,” said the manifesto. “Because of this, some plants are idle, with preventive maintenance anticipated, while others are hibernating plants. And this affects not only the production of chemical inputs, but an entire broad supply chain of raw materials, services, and energy supply related to the sector.” The Abiquim-led manifesto was also signed by several trade unions in some of Brazil’s key petrochemicals hubs, such the Chemists Union of Sao Paulo; the Union of Chemical Industries of Rio Grande do Sul (Sindiquim), and the Union of workers in the chemical, petrochemical, plastic and pharmaceutical industries of the State of Bahia (Sindiquímica Bahia). According to Abiquim’s figures, Brazil’s chemicals production and related chain employs around 2 million workers, representing 12% of the country’s industrial GDP. Earlier in June, the director general at Abiquim said in an interview with ICIS that the request for higher tariffs was only one of the proposals presented to the government to safeguard producers' global competitiveness. “What we have presented to the government is the need to undertake action on three main fronts: in the short term, import tariffs, but in the medium and long term we also need a structural plan to address natural gas prices, which are seven times higher in Brazil than in some other jurisdictions, as well as a stimulus plan covering the whole chemicals production chain,” said Andre Passos. The list of signatories to the manifesto also includes one company, one professional association, and two industrial development groups: TRADE GROUPS 1. Chemical Industry Association (Abiquim) 2.
