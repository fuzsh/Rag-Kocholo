        "text": "What Is Epoxy Flooring?\n\nEpoxy flooring is a type of resinous flooring. In the mid-twentieth century, epoxy was the most successful resin used in flooring applications because of its durability and superior adhesive capabilities. Resinous flooring also includes methyl methacrylate (MMA), polyaspartic, polyester, polyurethane, and vinyl ester products. Each chemistry has their pros and cons.\n\nTypes of Resinous Flooring\n\nNo matter what resin chemistry is used, resinous flooring products fall into three basic types: Coatings (4-30 mils), Slurries (30-250 mils), and Mortars (125-250+ mils).\n\nCoatings are typically pure resins without any fillers, except for possible texture additives used to improve wear or increase slip resistance.\n\nSlurries incorporate a blend of aggregates to bulk up a resin, while still allowing for good flow and levelling during installation.\n\nMortars utilize a high aggregate-to-resin ratio (5:1). The result is a stiff mixture that will not level or flow. “Damp sand” mortars require the highest applicator skill to install.\n\nThe greater the thickness of the resinous flooring type, the greater the durability and resistance to abuse.\n\nAdvantages & Disadvantages of Resinous Flooring\n\nEach chemistry will have its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For example, a vinyl ester has the highest chemical resistance but does not provide a desirable aesthetic value.\n\nBenefits of Resinous Flooring\n\nResinous floor coatings bring significant advantages to commercial facilities, including:\n\nOffers excellent durability\n\nProtects substrate from chemicals and abuse\n\nEnhances facility aesthetics\n\nProvides added safety and slip-resistance\n\nIs easy to clean and maintain\n\nResists staining\n\nDisadvantages of Epoxy Flooring\n\nA main disadvantage of epoxy flooring is that is requires greater surface preparation than what people outside the industry might expect. In fact, the number one reason for coating failure is lack of, or improper, surface preparation. Even if the resinous floor coating is installed perfectly, it won’t last long if the substrate preparation is inadequate.\n\nAnother disadvantage of epoxy flooring is the potential for mixing errors. The final phase of chemistry in epoxy flooring is performed on the jobsite where part A is mixed with part B, setting off a thermal chemical reaction. The coating needs to be applied and finished within that coating’s working time. Because this final phase of chemistry is done on a jobsite, it is possible that mixing errors may occur. Therefore, working with a qualified installation contractor is the best route to success with epoxy flooring installations.\n\nCommercial Resinous Floor Coating Applications\n\nSome industries and facilities that benefit the most from resinous floor coatings includeSome industries and facilities that benefit the most from resinous floor coatings include:\n\nAircraft Hangars\n\nChemical Storage\n\nClean Rooms\n\nCommercial Kitchens\n\nFood and Beverage Processing\n\nManufacturing\n\nMechanical Equipment Rooms\n\nPharmaceutical Facilities\n\nRestrooms\n\nSecondary Containment\n\nShop Floors\n\nWarehouses\n\nEpoxy Floor Coating Installation Basics\n\nMake sure the substrate is a suitable canvas to create your artwork.\n\nDecontamination: Degrease, grind, removal, etc.\n\nCreate Surface Profile: Grind or shotblast the surface. The greater the thickness of the coating finish will require greater surface profile.\n\nPrime Coat: Application of a primer is designed to do two things, promote adhesion and seal the substrate. If it doesn’t seal the substrate, the following coatings will outgas leaving bubbles or voids. Squeegee and back-rolling is the preferred method. Squeegee application will help fill voids in the substrate. Back-rolling evens out the squeegee application.\n\nIntermediate Coat: The intermediate coat will usually be where the majority of the thickness will come from, most often consisting of cheaper resins filled with aggregate to extend the coverage. This step can be a coating, slurry, or mortar. A coating or slurry can be broadcasted with an aggregate for additional build and texture.\n\nFinish Coat: The finish coat typically consists of resins with greater chemical and/or UV resistance to provide the greatest aesthetics. Options can include smooth, stippled, satin, etc.\n\nResinous Flooring Maintenance – An Overview\n\nProperly maintaining a finished resinous floor is crucial to achieving the longest life span. Dirt and debris that gets tracked in will abrade the surface overtime with routine traffic. Sweeping and mopping the floors will keep them looking good for many years. Occasionally, degreasing as needed will keep contaminates from building up on the floors. Most areas can be easily cleaned by mopping with water and a pH neutral cleaner.\n\nLongevity of Epoxy Floors\n\nIf the resinous floor is designed correctly for the anticipated traffic and abuse exposures, it should last ten years or greater. However, due to budget, limited time available required during installation, or if the abuse was greater than anticipated during the design, this isn’t always the case. The term “Value Engineered” is often used to modify a coating system to meet a budget and/or time restraint. When this happens, you should expect some type of compromise in aesthetics, durability, and/or longevity.\n\nIt is important to note that resinous flooring is one of the few floor finishes that does not have to be removed and replaced when it gets old; old floor can be rejuvenated by installing another finish coat. In other words, the old floor doesn’t have to go into a landfill like other flooring such as carpet, sheet vinyl, VCT, etc.\n\nThe Industry-Leading Epoxy Flooring Manufacturer\n\nSherwin-Williams’ technical representatives and local approved installers will ensure your epoxy flooring is designed and applied according to your needs and specifications.
