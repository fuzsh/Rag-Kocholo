        "text": "Are you planning to purchase new flooring?\n\nYou can use epoxy flooring in your house in a variety of settings. Bathroom floors, patios, kitchen floors, garage floor coverings, and basement floors are all suitable for the use of epoxy.\n\nThis is exactly why epoxy coating has become such a popular flooring option, says Remax Infinity Management. However, as with any other flooring solutions, there are both major advantages and disadvantages connected to the use of epoxy floors in your house.\n\nNow we are going to list the top pros and cons of epoxy floors. Weigh the various positive and negative factors in order to determine whether the epoxy coating is the right choice for your flooring needs.\n\nWhen it comes to durability, epoxy floor coating can last for a long time. When you’ll research the average lifetime of epoxy flooring, you can find very different quotes.\n\nThe endurance of the epoxy coating depends on where it has been applied and whether it was properly installed. Public areas with frequent foot traffic fare the worst, but an epoxy basement flooring could easily last over twenty years.\n\nEpoxy flooring is highly resistant to all sorts of wear and tear. You can count on the material to resist peels, cracks, and corrosion. Once the epoxy is cured, it can even withstand some chemical damage, including acids.\n\nAdditionally, the epoxy coating is highly water-resistant and won’t easily be affected by heat. The resistance to many types of damage makes this material a prime pick for industrial and commercial use as well.\n\nThe preparation before the installation takes a lot of time. When you are putting the epoxy coating on the concrete floor, you need to properly prep the surface and remove any of the underlying substances like oils or grease.\n\nThe installation process itself must exactly follow the required rules. For instance, you have to check the humidity levels before the installation. When there is too much moisture in the air, the final result will be damaged and the flooring will age more quickly.\n\nInstalling an epoxy floor means that you’ll probably notice a strong odor during the installation process if the material is not water based. Many people can attest that these fumes inflame the eyes, throat, nose, and even lungs. To avoid this problem, choose those low VOC water based “green” epoxy materials instead of solvent based epoxy.\n\nOnce the epoxy floor has completely cured, the material does not pose health risks. The only way epoxy could become hazardous is when you sand the flooring after it has cured and inhale this dust.\n\nPick the right material and have it properly installed is critical to have a beautiful and long lasting floor. Check out our floor coating services and let us know if there is anything we could help!\n\nWhen you compare epoxy to numerous other flooring materials, you’ll notice that the epoxy floor coatings have a lower overall cost. Part of the economics lies in its easy installation over the existing concrete. There is no need for a separate floor system.\n\nThe upfront cost of epoxy is indeed higher compared to concrete polishing, for instance. But when you need to replace the epoxy, the costs are going to be lower. The durability is another important factor to be considered.\n\nWhen you have just installed your epoxy flooring, you have to wait for a few days for full curing. It’s recommended to have a longer curing process because the results are stronger and have better endurance.\n\nThis is a disadvantage as some of the setups may require up to a week for complete drying and curing. The long full hardening may prove to be a major inconvenience for some homeowners."
