Epoxy adhesives are supplied in both one-component package and two-component package depending on curing agent used and curing method applied. Two-component epoxy adhesives are prepared by packing epoxy composition and curing agent composition separately. They cure soon after mixing the two components together. Almost all room temperature cure epoxy adhesives are supplied in two-component package. One-component epoxy adhesives are prepared and supplied by mixing all formulated components in advance including epoxy resin and curing agent. One-component epoxy adhesives usually need cure at elevated temperature and store at low temperature in a refrigerator or even freezer. Epoxy adhesives have been widely used as typical reactive adhesives for various applications ranging from general industry, construction, electronics assembly, automobile production to aerospace market. Typical room temperature cure epoxy adhesives, thermal cure epoxy adhesives and UV cure epoxy adhesives are introduced in detail.",

        "text": "4.2 One-component thermal cure epoxy adhesives\n\nOne-component epoxy adhesives do not require pre-mix before use since all components have been mixed together and there is no concern on insufficient mixing problem as often occurred in two-component use. Pot life of one-component epoxy adhesives is usually long and one-component adhesives are thus suitable for automatic dispensing systems. Compared to two-component type, one-component epoxy adhesives can be handled much easily. On the other hand, one-component epoxy adhesives usually need cure at higher temperature because of long enough room temperature stability needed for adhesive preparation and storage. Most one-component epoxy adhesives require storage condition at lower temperatures in a refrigerator or even freezer.\n\nRecently one-component thermal cure epoxy adhesives have become more and more important especially in electronics assembly and automotive production where high production efficiency is required. With selection of suitable latent curing agents, a number of one-component epoxy adhesives have been developed and commercialized by epoxy adhesive suppliers for various applications. Typical commercial latent curing agents are summarized in Table 7.\n\nLatency mechanismLatent curing agentCuring agent stateTypical curing temperature °CChemical block and physical separationDICYSolid≥150Dihydrazines≥120Physical separationModified imidazolesFine powder≥80Modified polyamine≥80Chemical blockOnium saltsSolid≥80Amine-BF3 complexLiquid≥130\n\nDICY (dicyandiamide), chemical structure shown in Figure 6 [20], is the oldest and widely used latent curing agent for epoxy resin technology. It is a solid chemical with a melting point at 208°C. DICY formulated epoxy composition is very stable, up to 6 months at room temperature. Latency mechanism is a combination of physically separation and chemically blocking with epoxide group. DICY cured epoxy resin shows high adhesion and possesses high glass transition temperature especially suitable for high performance required applications such as vehicle parts bonding in automobile production. Cure temperature of DICY alone with epoxy resin normally needs at least 150°C to achieve full cure. By addition small amount of accelerator such as modified urea compounds and imidazole compound, cure temperature can be further lowered to 120°C [21].\n\nIn recent years, new type latent curing agents have been developed and commercialized by several curing agent suppliers [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. These latent curing agents are supplied as fine powder with average particle size well controlled in a few microns or premix of fine powder latent curing agent in epoxy resin. They are manufactured by grinding specially synthesized modified polyamine or imidazole solid with a softening point from 80 to 150°C. Latency mechanism is mainly physically separation between curing agent and epoxide. Curing temperature has been be lowered to as low as 80°C and its formulated epoxy composition can be still quite stable at room temperature. Many one-component epoxy adhesives commercialized recently are based on these new type latent curing agents because of their lower temperature curability suitable for use in bonding heat sensitive substrates such as plastics. By combination of small amount of liquid phenol compound with latent curing agent, it has been found that cure time of one-component epoxy adhesives can be shortened significantly [27, 28].\n\n5.1 UV cationic epoxy adhesives\n\nUV cationic epoxy adhesives are primarily composed of epoxy resin and cationic photo-initiator [29, 30, 31]. Cycloaliphatic type epoxy resins are usually selected for UV cationic epoxy adhesives because of faster cationic polymerization rate than that of normal bisphenol A diglycidyl ether type epoxy resin. As illustrated in Figure 7 [32], cationic photoinitiator formulated in UV epoxy adhesives absorbs UV energy to generate strong acid that will react with epoxy to produce cationic which can initiate homo-polymerization of epoxy resin. Compared to common acrylate based UV adhesives, UV cationic epoxy adhesives have lower cure shrinkage because of epoxy structure and have no surface cure issue resulted from oxygen inhibition to free radical polymerization since they cure via cationic polymerization. On the other hand, UV cationic epoxy adhesives are not suitable for bonding basic substrates which terminate cationic polymerization. UV cationic epoxy adhesives will need some longer cure time. In real use, a post thermal cure of UV cationic epoxy adhesives after the UV radiation is commonly used for full cure to assure satisfactory adhesion performance.\n\nUV cationic epoxy adhesives have been commercialized and used in optical parts bonding, camera module sensor packaging and OLED panel assembly applications [33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. The authors have found that adhesion reliability performance of UV cationic epoxy adhesives can be much improved by combination use of cationic photo initiator with thermal cationic initiator [38].\n\n5.2 UV hybrid epoxy adhesives\n\nMost widely used UV cure adhesives are acrylate compositions [39, 40, 41]. Acrylate based UV cure adhesives are mainly composed of acrylate monomer, acrylate oligomer and radical photo-initiator. Acrylate based UV cure adhesives can be cured instantly, within seconds. Limitations of UV cure acrylate adhesives are surface cure issue, shadow cure problem, high cure shrinkage and poor humidity reliability. By combination of UV acrylate composition with thermal cure epoxy composition, UV and thermal cure hybrid epoxy adhesives have been developed and commercialized for over two decades [42, 43, 44]. Acrylate monomer, epoxy resin, photo-initiator and epoxy curing agent are primarily formulated in the UV and thermal cure hybrid adhesives. UV hybrid epoxy adhesives combine advantages from both UV acrylate proportion and thermal cure epoxy part. Adhesion reliability performance could be much improved by introduction of epoxy composition with compared to normal UV acrylate adhesives. In the meantime, production efficiency could be much improved by shortening the fixture time to seconds via UV radiation with compared to at least dozens of minutes needed for thermal cure epoxy adhesives. Surface cure issue, shadow cure issue and cure shrinkage problem of acrylate UV adhesives could also be improved to certain degree because of lower contents of free radical curable acrylate compositions. In some cases, thermal initiator such as peroxide is also formulated in the hybrid adhesive to assure curing remained acrylate compositions after UV radiation or those at shadow areas where UV light cannot reach.\n\nSuccessful development and industrialization of so called ODF (One Drop Fill) process for large size LCD (liquid crystal panel) panel production was one important technology revolution in early 2000s that have made a big impact on our modern life. Development and commercialization of LCD ODF main sealant, an UV hybrid epoxy adhesive, played a key role in its mass production success [45, 46, 47]. LCD ODF main sealant is an adhesive material that is used to bond two glass substrates and seal liquid crystal material between them. It is a UV hybrid epoxy adhesive, typically composed of acrylate monomer, photo-initiator, partially acrylate epoxy resin and latent curing agent. Main steps for the adhesive use in this process are: (1) dispensing LCD main sealant; (2) dropping off liquid crystal materials into each cell; (3) alignment and assembly; (4) UV cure the sealant; and (5) thermal cure the sealant. The author has invented initiator free UV hybrid thermal cure epoxy adhesives by combination with bismaleimides that shows much better compatibility with liquid crystal material and high performance [48, 49, 50]."
