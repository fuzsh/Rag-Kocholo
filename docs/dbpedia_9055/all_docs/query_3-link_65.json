They are in bicycle helmets, child safety seats, and automotive airbags that protect us and the cell phones that connect us. Plastics also help keep the foods we eat and serve to our families safer and fresher than ever before.",

        "text": "Strong, lightweight plastics enable us to live better while contributing to sustainability in many ways—all of which stem from plastics’ ability to help us do more with less.\n\nPlastics help us protect the environment by reducing waste, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and saving energy at home, at work, and on the road. Plastic packaging helps to dramatically extend the shelf life of fresh foods and beverages while allowing us to ship more product with less packaging material—reducing both food and packaging waste.\n\nPlastic insulation, sealants, and other building products are making our homes significantly more energy efficient, while reducing costs for heating and cooling. And lightweight plastics in cars can dramatically increase miles per gallon, saving drivers money at the pump.\n\nPlastics not only help doctors save lives, they protect our loved ones at home, on the road, on the job and at play. And these advanced materials are helping make health care more affordable."
