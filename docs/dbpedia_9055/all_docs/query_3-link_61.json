The instructor led us through two days packed with useful compliance information.\n\nRachel Stewart\n\nEnvironmental Manager\n\nGiven the choice, I would do all coursework this way. In-person courses go very fast without the opportunity to pause or repeat anything.\n\nEllen Pelton\n\nChemical Laboratory Manager\n\nVery well structured, comprehensive, and comparable to live training seminars I've participated in previously. I will recommend the online course to other colleagues with training requirement needs.\n\nNeil Luciano\n\nEHS Manager\n\nThe course was very informative and presented in a way that was easily understood and remembered. I would recommend this course.\n\nJeffrey Tierno\n\nHazmat Shipping Professional\n\nBy submitting your phone number, you agree to receive recurring marketing and training text messages.
