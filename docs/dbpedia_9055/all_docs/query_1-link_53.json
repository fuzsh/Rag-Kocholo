Epichlorohydrin is considered a probable human carcinogen when inhaled and causes additional toxic effects.\n\nSee the regulations below for more details.\n\nRule History\n\n05/16/2024 - Final Rule\n\n06/26/2023 - Comment Period Extension - Federal Register Notice\n\n04/25/2023 - Proposed Rule\n\n12/16/2008 – Final Rule\n\n12/12/2007 – Proposed Rule\n\n05/08/2000 – Amended Direct Final Rule and Final Rule & Proposed Rule\n\n03/08/1995 – Final Rule\n\n05/16/1994 – Proposed Rule\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nDocuments from the 2024 Final Rule\n\n04/09/2024 - Regulatory Impact Analysis\n\n04/09/2024 - Overview Fact Sheet\n\n04/09/2024 - Key Things to Know Fact Sheet\n\n04/09/2024 - List of Facilities that EPA Anticipates Will be Covered by the Final Rule\n\nDocuments from the 2023 Proposal\n\nProposed Regulatory Text Memoranda (zip)\n\nFact Sheet on EPA's Community Risk Assessment and Risk-Based Demographic Assessment\n\nEarlier Documents\n\nEmissions from Epoxy Resins Production and Non-Nylon Polyamides Production: Background Information for Proposed Standards\n\nFact Sheet: Proposed Rule for Epoxy Resins Production and Non-Nylon Polyamide Resins\n\nView the supporting documents in the docket folder to find additional related documents to this rule.\n\nRelated Rules\n\nGroup I Polymers and Resins: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP)\n\nPolymer Manufacturing Industry: Standards of Performance for Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Emissions\n\nManufacture of Amino/Phenolic Resins: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP)\n\nControl of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing Equipment"
