Phenoxy resins are polyethers similar to those used in epoxies, but the polymers are of higher molecular…\n\nRead More\n\nIn glue\n\n…resin adhesives such as the epoxies are replacing glue for many uses, but glue is still widely used as an adhesive in woodworking, in the manufacture of such abrasives as sandpaper, and as a colloid in industrial processes—e.g., the recovery of solid particles suspended in a liquid.\n\nRead More\n\nIn adhesive: Structural adhesives\n\n…into six structural-adhesive families: (1) epoxies, which exhibit high strength and good temperature and solvent resistance, (2) polyurethanes, which are flexible, have good peeling characteristics, and are resistant to shock and fatigue, (3) acrylics, a versatile adhesive family that bonds to oily parts, cures quickly, and has good overall properties,…\n\nRead More\n\nIn materials science: Polymer-matrix composites\n\n…the aerospace industry are the epoxies. Thermoplastics, on the other hand, are melted and then solidified, a process that can be repeated numerous times for reprocessing. Although the manufacturing technologies for thermoplastics are generally not as well developed as those for thermosets, thermoplastics offer several advantages. First, they do not…\n\nRead More\n\nIn art conservation and restoration: Glass and other vitreous materials\n\n…by the infusion of light-stable epoxy resin with an identical or similar refractive index to the glass itself. In recent years consolidation has also been carried out by using a variety of silane solutions as well as acrylic copolymers. Mending, meaning the rejoining of shards of glass, is carried out…\n\nRead More\n\nIn floor covering: Epoxy resins\n\nFlooring compositions based on epoxy resins have developed steadily, giving a hard, chemical-resistant, seamless, and firmly adherent floor covering. The resin and curing agent must be blended immediately before use; colours and fillers can be added. The comparatively high cost of epoxy-resin systems…\n\nRead More\n\nIn plastic: Fibreglass\n\nEpoxies are most often used as matrix resins, because of their good adhesion to glass fibres, although water resistance may not be as good as with the unsaturated polyesters.\n\nRead More"
