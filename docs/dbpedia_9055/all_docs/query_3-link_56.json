        "text": "Step by Step Liquid Glass Instructions\n\nThis is our typical instructions for our products. We understand everyone’s environment, project and applications may be different. if you have questions, don’t hesitate to call us at 888-849-0588. We would love to go over your project with you, and if you don’t get us on the phone (we are probably on the other line), send us an email here.\n\nSTEP 1:\n\nThe ideal working temperature is around 77°F. Best results can be obtained at temperatures between 70°F and 85°F, in a clean, dry, dust-free environment. Avoid working in high humidity. We recommend using this product on a leveled and flat work surface.\n\nSTEP 2:\n\nPrepare 1 part Base Resin to 1 part Curing Agent by liquid volume or 100 parts Base Resin to 83 parts Curing Agent by weight. Pour the Curing Agent first and then the Base Resin into a clean, smooth sided container large enough to hold all the liquid and allow room for mixing. We do not recommend mixing more than a half-gallon in a single container, as this prod- uct is mass dependent.\n\nSTEP 3:\n\nTHE MATERIAL MUST BE MIXED THOROUGHLY FOR A MINIMUM OF 3 MINUTES until the mix appears clear. Be sure to scrape the container sides, bottom, and corners as you mix. Be careful to not whip excessive air into the mixture.\n\nSTEP 4:\n\nPour the mixed resin onto the surface and distribute evenly with a squeegee or gloved hand. Continue to pour remaining material to achieve the desired thickness, (up to 1/4”) allowing the resin to flow evenly over the project’s sides.\n\nSTEP 5:\n\nIf you are going to make a second pour, the first pour should still be lightly sticky. This is generally between 2-4 hours after your initial pour. Once the second pour is made, bubbles may once again need to be removed. Material will feel well-cured after 24 hours, but full cure and maximum hardness can require up to 7 days depending upon the temperature.\n\nSuperclear FAQ’s\n\nHOW LONG DO I HAVE TO MIX IT?\n\nYou need to slowly stir it by hand for a minimum of 3 minutes, scraping the sides and bottom thoroughly throughout until the mixture becomes clear, usually around 5-6 minutes. When pouring, we do not recommend scraping the sides. Doing so can risk mixing in unmixed, unincorporated epoxy into your pour, thus creating curing issues.\n\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CURE?\n\nThe product will begin to harden within the first 1-1.5 hours, in ideal conditions, but takes 24 hours to completely cure, dependent upon conditions like constant temperature, humidity, mass and airflow.\n\nCAN I MIX PIGMENT/DYE/MICA POWDER?\n\nYou can mix nearly all alcohol dye’s, mica powders, and liquid pigments with our product, not to exceed 12%. However, we do not recommend acrylic based colorants as they can negatively react with the epoxy.\n\nCAN I ADD ANOTHER LAYER TO THE SURFACE?\n\nYes! Simply wait until the pour is tacky and nearly hard and pour your next layer. If the product is already hard, lightly sand with 240 grit sandpaper and wipe it down with Isopropyl Alcohol 90% or higher before adding additional layers, which helps with the adhesion between the two layers.\n\nCAN I APPLY IT OVER WOOD, CONCRETE AND COUNTERTOPS?\n\nAbsolutely! With any surface, you want to ensure the surface is clean and dry before applying. As always, we recommend a seal coat before applying thicker coats.\n\nCAN I PAINT OVER THE EPOXY?\n\nYes, once it is completely cured, you can paint over the top of it.\n\nDO YOU NEED TO APPLY A SEAL COAT?\n\nWe recommend a seal coat, which is a very thin coat of Superclear applied to the surface to prevent air bubbles and any residual moisture from the substrate getting into your thick pour. Make sure that the pour surface on your substrate is properly sealed. You can use our SuperClear Table Top Epoxy to easily seal by applying with a paint brush.\n\nIT’S COLD AND THE EPOXY IS REALLY THICK, WHAT DO I DO?\n\nUnder 65 degrees, our epoxy may start to thicken up. You may even see some crystalization. Don’t worry, the epoxy is perfectly fine! Before mixing, bring a pot of water up to a steady 75-80 degrees, and then put each bottle of epoxy in there until they come up to temp between 75-80 per bottle. Do not mix first and then bring up to temp. Once the epoxy is up to temp, you can now begin the mixing process.\n\nHOW THICK CAN I POUR IT?\n\nYou can pour up to 1/4” thick per pour, depending on ambient temperature and total mass. Much thicker than most competitors! The mass for a 1/4” pour varies depending on temperatures and conditions. If you have never poured as thick as 1/4”, we suggest you try it on a smaller scale to understand how it will cure in your particular environment.\n\nHOW CLEAR IS YOUR EPOXY?\n\nOur epoxies are the clearest epoxy on the market with breathtaking clarity and long-lasting beauty.\n\nCAN I USE THIS ON TOP OF AN OIL BASED STAIN?\n\nNo, epoxy will not adhere to oil based stains.\n\nWHAT IF I CHIP THE EPOXY?\n\nNot a problem. This is easily fixed by rough sanding the area, clean the area with isopropyl alcohol, and then repour more of our epoxy. Let that cure. Sand down to desired surface, and then buff to your desired shine."
