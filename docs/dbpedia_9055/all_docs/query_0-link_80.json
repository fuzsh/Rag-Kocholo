        "text": "Leaf Wakeskates uses the best quality wood product made in the United States. Leaf Wakeskates are laminated Okume plywood with basswood wedges for concave, urethane sidewalls for extra durability when hitting obstacles also reinforced with fiberglass and epoxy resin. All of our boards are made by hand. We take pride in our craftsmanship and strive for perfection. We look at our product as a “For Riders, By Riders” entity.\n\nNew and improved. We have removed one layer of 4mm plywood, this drops the weight about 2 lbs and created more flex in the board allowing you to go higher and further. Second our graphics are now printed with a dye sublimation process for a super bright color. Also the image is placed on the bottom of the grind base so eventually the graphic will grind off like a skateboard."
