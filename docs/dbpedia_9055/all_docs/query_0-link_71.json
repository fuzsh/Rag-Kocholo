        "text": "I was just out mowing my lawn. I normally use that time to come up with new blog posts. Today was an attempt to find a way to relate the upcoming Fourth of July to our business. But, my mind wandered off to why I appreciate our nation’s Independence Day and why I look forward so to this day of the mid-year.\n\nI began to question what the 4th of July means to everyone else. I hope some of you reading this article will share. For now, I’ll share with you.\n\nThe 4th of July\n\nAs a holiday goes, I enjoy how our Independence Day combines the best of so many other holidays. For me, it provides for inspired patriotism I feel strongest on days like Veterans Day, Flag Day, and President’s Day. As a military veteran, I feel the heart tug as I think back to my fellow soldiers. I feel a great sense of pride and gratitude for those serving now.\n\nFor me, the 4th shares the childlike mystique of Christmas decorations & lights by its main street banners and fireworks. Oh, the fireworks. I enjoy them now as I did as a child watching the fireworks at the Pineknotter Days outside of Northumberland, PA.\n\nFor me, the 4th brings together family and friends in joyful picnicking like Labor Day. It’s a day we get to see people we don’t see the rest of the year as we wander about the town’s festivities. It’s a day I get to stop and share a bottle of suds with friends made in 25 years in my wife’s hometown.\n\nFor me, the 4th of July parade I watch each year in Brockway even has the candy like Halloween. I admit to stealing a few pieces from the nieces and nephews.\n\nFor me, our Independence Day displays our national harmony much like New Year’s Day. We don’t seem to care as much on the 4th if we are Democrats or Republicans, conservatives or liberals, gay or straight. Most people seem to stop bickering over our differences and celebrate our freedoms laid out 238 years ago in one declaration.\n\nOur Freedoms!\n\nAs I mowed today, I couldn't stop thinking about the freedoms we enjoy and take for granted. While not a perfect nation, we aren't burdened with daily sectarian violence – killing one another because we are Sunni or Shi’ite. We don't live in fear that a neighboring village will attack us because we belong to a different clan. No one is coming to my door to lock me up based upon my religious beliefs.\n\nIn my military service, I saw firsthand how the lack of these freedoms impacts the citizens of other nations. It’s not hard to understand why so many living under oppressive regimes and around constant blood feuds try so hard to come to the United States. I never question the struggles persons go through in an attempt to live in the Land of the Free.\n\nWhat does the 4th of July mean to you?\n\nIs it just another day to you? Do you have some special 4th of July memory?\n\nI don’t know enough about other countries' national holidays, so if you wish to compare or relate our Independence Day with another nation's, please do."
