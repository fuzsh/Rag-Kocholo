My first attempt used the E-Marco cement (the cement powder without the bonding agent) plus Gluemasters ultra thin. Now this works quite well at holding rocks -- even very heavy ones -- in place. However, the powder is incredibly dusty and light, to the point that it very easily will get into the air of whatever work space you have. A fan or wind will carry it (not to mention you're going to be breathing it in -- luckily we all have masks around right now, so that's somewhat solvable). Also, without the bonding agent it doesn't match the color of the rock at all; it's much darker.\n\nConclusion: it's not meant to be used this way. Use sand or smashed up rock instead.\n\nburningmime\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nJan 21, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n550\n\nReaction score\n\n786\n\nLocation\n\nMontana\n\n1.

Did you make a mold?\n\nthe putty is sticky depending on how much folding powder you add to it while mixing.\n\nthe arms were made separately and then attached. as it's setting up you can still change\n\nthe shape by wetting it with water and a sponge. I made a rubber stamp from a piece of\n\ncoral to imprint it. there are videos on you tube showing the whole process.\n\nif it's something that interests you in doing send me a message.\n\nRatherbeflyen\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nMar 9, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n571\n\nReaction score\n\n940\n\nLocation\n\nHouston\n\nI used black sanded grout and lighting diffuser to hold together my aquascape / 3D wall.

Just a big pile of rocks balanced on each other. I didn't sleep well.... Was that a snail falling or my entire tank about to bust open and spew 150 gallons across my living room?\n\nSecond tank, Most rocks cemented together with E-Marco mortor and a fiberglass rod in the middle. I sleep now.\n\nAlso, everything is at least 1 python tube away from the edge.\n\nKStatefan\n\n2500 Club Member\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nJun 24, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n4,402\n\nReaction score\n\n4,230\n\nLocation\n\nMHK\n\nI used @Glue Masters ultra thin and Caribsea gravel to build, then reinforced with E-Marco-400.\n\nOCFishGuy\n\nCommunity Member\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nJul 2, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n45\n\nReaction score\n\n56\n\nLocation\n\nHuntington Beach, California\n\nI used plastic rods to keep the rocks together.\n\nRooki3\n\nCommunity Member\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nJun 2, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n35\n\nReaction score\n\n25\n\nLocation\n\nSan Diego\n\nI used black sanded grout and lighting diffuser to hold together my aquascape / 3D wall. Then siliconed it to the 220 gallon tank.\n\n3 Years later.\n\nDid you get any phosphate issues from the black grout initially?\n\nReeferCubano\n\nNew Member\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nJul 8, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n5\n\nReaction score\n\n11\n\nLocation\n\nMiami\n\nI use Marcos Rock Mortar, is a good product and very firm when is dry.
