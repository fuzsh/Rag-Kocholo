        "text": "When it comes to the most useful products for DIYers, epoxy resin is high on the list. This handy little adhesive can be used on a variety of materials such as concrete, plastic, and wood; whether it’s for repairs, renovations, and installations.\n\nBut why would you need to remove epoxy in the first place? Actually, there are quite a few instances which require removing cured epoxy. Anytime you are separating materials which are adhered to another surface, there may be leftover epoxy. Also, some lower-grade epoxies may lose their integrity over time, which means you’ll need to remove the hardened epoxy and replace it with fresh product.\n\nThe list of epoxy removing tools is short and simple. It all depends on whether the epoxy has cured or not.\n\nFor cured epoxy, you will need:\n\na soft, clean, dry cloth\n\ndenatured alcohol, paint thinner, or adhesive remover\n\na well-ventilated work area\n\nFor uncured epoxy, you will need:\n\ngloves\n\na soft, clean, dry cloth\n\nisopropyl alcohol or acetone\n\nAdditional items you will find helpful when removing cured epoxy or removing uncured epoxy include a knife or scraper tool, leather or rubber gloves to protect your skin, a dish or pot to dispose the epoxy in, and safety goggles to protect your eyes.\n\nGetting unwanted epoxy off is a straight-forward job. The key is to work slowly, keep all the tools and products you need within reach, and ensure that your workspace is well ventilated.\n\nHow to remove epoxy from porous materials like wood or concrete:\n\nFor this particular job, use acetone as the solvent. Paint thinners and alcohol can damage wood finishes.\n\nSoak a clean, soft cloth with acetone and then gently rub it on the areas where epoxy needs to be removed.\n\nThe wood/concrete will then start to soak up the acetone, and the epoxy will loosen.\n\nUse your knife or scraping tool to gently and slowly scrape off the epoxy resin, being careful not to damage the wood/concrete.\n\nAcetone will evaporate on its own, so there is no need to worry about any wet areas.\n\nHow to remove epoxy from non-porous hard surfaces like metal:\n\nThe solvent you will want is a chemical adhesive remover, as these hard surfaces won't soak up acetone-like substances.\n\nMake sure to wear a mask, safety glasses, and gloves when working with a chemical solvent. The area needs to be well-ventilated.\n\nTypically, adhesive removers are sprayed on or dispensed using a rag.\n\nChip away the epoxy with a scraping tool. Do not scrape towards yourself.\n\nNow that you’ve removed cured or uncured epoxy, it’s time to move forward with your DIY project. We suggest using a high-quality, two-part epoxy that will get the job done right. Check out Loctite’s Epoxy Instant Mix 1 Minute. In just a few minutes, it forms a tough, high-strength, fully cured bond.
