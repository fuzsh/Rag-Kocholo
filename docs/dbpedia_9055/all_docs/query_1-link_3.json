        "text": "DEFINITION\n\nNowadays, epoxy is a popular resin used all over the world.\n\nIts strength as an adhesive can easily outmatch other common glues in the market.\n\nFor those of you who are not familiar with this resin, I will shortly define some key features of it.\n\nThis is how a construction resin like epoxy actually looks like when using SEM microscope.\n\nThe chemical formula is skethced below,\n\nThe word Epoxy can be traced back to two Greek prefixes “epi” and “oxy”.\n\nEpi means “upon” while the prefix oxy means sharp or acidic.\n\nGoogle define epoxy resin as:\n\nepoxy\n\nɪˈpɒksi,ɛˈpɒksi/ noun\n\nnoun: epoxy resin\n\nan adhesive, plastic, or other material made from a class of synthetic thermosetting polymers containing epoxide groups.\n\nVarious chemical reactions of epoxide, the resin, and polyamine, the hardener can produce epoxy resin.\n\nThe wide range of usage of this strong adhesive includes carpentry jobs, flooring, electronic boards and so on.\n\nThere are some uses in DIY garage coating.\n\nIts adhesive-ability has been tested and witnessed by millions of people throughout its 100+ years of existence.\n\nAnd yes, well over 100 years now!\n\nSo without further ado, let’s dive into the depth of history.\n\nIT ALL STARTED IN RUSSIA – 1890S TO 1930S\n\nEpoxies have been around during the early 1890s, but it was only popularized during the mid 1950s.\n\nA Russian chemist named Prileschajev was first to observe that olefins would react with a peroxybenzoic acid.\n\nThis reaction formed epoxides which are used to form epoxy along with polyamine.\n\nDuring the mid-1930’s, a German named P. Shalack was granted a patent in which he prepared a polyamine with a high molecular weight.\n\nShalack did this through using of epoxide compounds which contained an epoxide group greater than one.\n\nFIRST PATENTED FORMULATIONS – 1930S TO 1950S\n\nThe first epoxy as we know it today, though, was synthesized in the year 1936.\n\nDr. Pierre Castan, from Switzerland, and Dr. S.O. Greenlee, from the USA, both recognized the chemistry of epoxy that people use today.\n\nThey applied for different patents during the late 1930s. [DE 943195 C]\n\nBoth of them also shared the credit of developing Diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol A.\n\nDr. Pierre Castan allowed his work to be licensed by company named Ciba in Switzerland.\n\nThus, Ciba became the first company to commercialize the production of epoxy resin in the year 1946.\n\nDr. S.O. Greenlee on the other hand had an agreement with an America based firm named Devoe-Reynolds.\n\nThis firm was then sold to a company called Shell Chemicals which changed its name to Momentive Specialty Chemicals.\n\nCOMMERCIALISATION – 1950S TO 1970S\n\nAerospace was the first commercial field that epoxies could penetrate to in early 1950.\n\nHowever, it was discovered to be extremely useful in other niches as well.\n\nIt took well over than two decades for epoxy resin to get the exposure it needed.\n\nObviously, many had first questioned the product which resulted into most of its commercial failures.\n\nThe lack of knowledge also managed to do the same thing as well.\n\nThe present epoxy today has its own formulation but was based on the work of Prileschajev.\n\nThanks to the studies of Dr. Pierre Castan and Dr. S.O. Greenlee, epoxy has further evolved and became what it is now.\n\nThe companies also did their part in commercializing epoxy.\n\nThough it may be difficult to explain what epoxy is during those times, they still pushed hard and had successfully introduced a new product that revolutionized the market.\n\nThe use of Epoxy is still very eminent today and it will be still used in the coming years.\n\nEach person had its own role in epoxy and its history.\n\nThe scientific minds and entrepreneurs have worked together to make Epoxy one of the greatest adhesives around today.\n\nRECENT INNOVATIONS – 1970S TO PRESENT\n\nEpoxy resin has come a long a way.\n\nHowever, there are breakthroughs in this field which keeps epoxies compatible with other solutions.\n\nThree major innovations that have led to the evolution of the global epoxy resins market in recent years include the following;\n\n– VARNISH COMPOSITION FOR LAMINATES\n\nNan Ya Plastics owns the patent for epoxy resin varnish for laminates.\n\nThis composition has a high glass transition temperature due to increase in cross-linking density of the resin.\n\nThis will inevitably lead to improved mechanical strength and heat resistance.\n\nThis innovation is especially groundbreaking, as it offers low water absorption and excellent heat resistance to electrical laminates; even fire retardant requirements are fulfilled at low costs.\n\n– EPOXY RESIN COMPOSITION USING SOLVATED SOLIDS\n\nTaking the curing process to the next level, this epoxy resin composition enhances thermal, mechanical and chemical properties.\n\nTherefore, it is highly useful in the manufacturing of composite parts by vendors.\n\nAir Products and Chemicals Inc. owns the patent for this composition.\n\n– PREPARATION OF STABLE AQUEOUS EPOXY RESIN DISPERSION\n\nOwned by Dow Global Technologies, this process is solvent-free and involves the preparation of stable aqueous epoxy resin dispersions using polyvinyl alcohol as a primary dispersant.\n\nProperties like low VOC content and low viscosity, which are highly desirable in the coatings industry, are also inherent in this epoxy resin composition.\n\nGlobal Category Spend by Region 2016 (US$7.7 billion)\n\nRegion Percentage\n\nAPAC 60%\n\nEMEA 23%\n\nNorth America 13%\n\nLatin America 4%\n\nSource: Technavio\n\nAccording to analysts at Technavio, it is the wind energy market that has contributed to the expansion of the global epoxy resins market in 2015.\n\nAs epoxies are stable, lightweight and flexible in nature, they are used in manufacturing wind turbine blades.\n\nLikewise, due to these properties, the chemical has applications in shipbuilding and the maintenance industries as well.\n\nOne major impediment that suppliers of epoxy resins have to face is adherence to regulations.\n\nSome of the major regulatory frameworks for this industry include OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, REACH, and VOC emissions standards, as well as several transportation regulations.\n\nSUMMERY\n\nThe epoxy resin has been developed in the course of past century. But it has proven that still it has the capacity to stays among the top resins for commercial purposes.\n\nEpoxies as they are today innovated by Dr. Castan.\n\nThen they were commercialised within the next 20 years.\n\nI am definitely missing out a lot as I am trying to compress 100 years in 1000 words!\n\nSo please mention what you think is missing here in the comment section below.\n\nThank you so much for your attention, and have a good one."
