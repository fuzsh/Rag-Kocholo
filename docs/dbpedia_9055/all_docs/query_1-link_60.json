        "text": "The Petition\n\nOn April 3, 2024, the US Epoxy Resin Producers Ad Hoc Coalition (\"Petitioners\") filed antidumping duty (\"ADD\") and countervailing duty (\"CVD\") petitions on imports of epoxy resin from China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. The ADD petition alleges that imports of epoxy resin from the targeted countries are being sold in the United States at less than fair value (that is, \"dumped\"). The CVD petition alleges that the Governments of the targeted countries are providing countervailable subsidies with respect to the manufacture, production, and export of epoxy resin. Petitioners allege that the domestic industry has been materially injured and is threatened with further material injury by the subject imports.\n\n1. Petitioners have defined the products covered by the petition as follows:\n\nThe merchandise subject to these petitions are epoxy resins, also known as epoxide resins or polyepoxides, which are polymers or prepolymers containing epoxy groups. Epoxy resins range in physical form from low viscosity liquids to solids and are used in a wide range of applications such as coatings, paints, adhesives, composite materials, wind blade systems, insulating materials, civil engineering materials, and electronics. All epoxy resins are covered by the scope of these petitions irrespective of physical form, viscosity, grade, purity, molecular weight, or molecular structure and regardless of packaging.\n\nEpoxy resins may contain modifiers or additives, such as hardeners, curatives, colorants, pigments, diluents, solvents, thickeners, fillers, plasticizers, softeners, flame retardants, toughening agents, catalysts, Bisphenol F, and ultraviolet light inhibitors, so long as the modifier or additive has not chemically reacted so as to cure the epoxy resin or convert it into a different product no longer containing epoxy groups. Such epoxy resins with modifiers or additives are included in the scope where the epoxy resin component comprises at least 30 percent of the total weight of the product. The scope also includes blends of epoxy resins with different types of epoxy resins, with or without the inclusion of modifiers and additives, so long as the combined epoxy resin component comprises at least 30 percent of the total weight of the blend.\n\nEpoxy resins are characterized by the presence of reactive epoxy groups that allow them to be readily cross-linked at the time of use. Epoxy resins may be reacted (cross-linked) either with themselves or with a wide range of co-reactants, often referred to as hardeners, curatives, or curing agents. The cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing. The epoxy resins and blends thereof covered by this scope have not been cured.\n\nEpoxy resins that enter as part of a system or kit with separately packaged co-reactants, such as hardeners or curing agents, are within the scope. For such entries, both the epoxy resin and the co-reactant are covered by the scope of these petitions when entered together.\n\nThe scope includes merchandise matching the above description that has been processed in a third country, including by commingling, diluting, introducing, or removing modifiers or additives, or performing any other processing that would not otherwise remove the merchandise from the scope of the investigations if performed in the subject country.\n\nThe scope also includes epoxy resin that is commingled with epoxy resin from sources not subject to this investigation. Only the subject component of such commingled products is covered by the scope of this investigations.\n\nExcluded from the scope are phenoxy resins, which are polymers weighing more than 11,000 Daltons and containing no epoxy groups other than at the terminal ends of the molecule. Phenoxy resins' Melt Flow Index (\"MFI\") at 200°C (392°F) range from 4 to 70 grams per 10 min and its Glass-Transition Temperatures (\"Tg\") range from 80 to 100°C (176 to 212°F).\n\nExcluded from the scope are certain paint and coating products, which are blends, mixtures, or other formulations of epoxy resin, curing agent, and pigment, in any form, packaged in one or more containers, wherein (1) the pigment represents a minimum of 10 percent of the total weight of the product, (2) the epoxy resin represents a maximum of 80 percent of the total weight of the product, and (3) the curing agent represents 5 to 40 percent of the total weight of the product.\n\nExcluded from the scope are preimpregnated fabrics or fibers, often referred to as \"pre-pregs,\" which are composite materials consisting of fabrics or fibers (typically carbon or glass) impregnated with epoxy resin.\n\nThis merchandise is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheading 3907.30.0000. Subject merchandise may also be entered under subheadings 3907.29.0000, 3824.99.9397, 3214.10.0020, 2910.90.91, 2910.90.9000, 2910.90.2000, and 1518.00.4000. The HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes only; the written description of the scope is dispositive.\n\n2. The petition lists the following quantities and values for the subject imports:\n\nQuantity (Pounds)\n\nCountry 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 South Korea 96,874,679 104,444,413 83,551,254 149,812,303 183,972,047 124,718,706 Taiwan 27,453,824 25,383,502 16,786,259 16,525,474 32,454,688 40,026,645 Thailand 30,278,596 26,233,935 18,134,281 12,354,755 10,480,613 12,718,384 China 6,864,428 2,097,992 3,886,529 8,422,943 6,325,121 4,084,046 India 2,735,748 703,272 776,372 1,989,235 4,481,096 4,720,313 Subject Countries 164,207,274 158,863,114 123,134,694 189,104,711 237,713,566 186,268,094 Canada 13,199,904 12,117,086 13,824,652 12,707,976 11,768,038 11,301,324 Mexico 1,603,972 355,580 784,591 1,711,689 3,613,630 3,787,648 Sub-Total 14,803,876 12,472,666 14,609,243 14,419,665 15,381,668 15,088,972 Germany 30,101,688 23,341,471 26,545,928 30,368,555 26,771,677 21,025,749 Netherlands 15,047,105 13,279,931 9,170,453 12,569,060 13,730,762 10,062,339 Japan 11,095,758 11,126,411 7,837,340 8,996,049 11,301,015 9,520,660 Czechia 954,964 1,480,757 1,037,979 2,140,819 3,732,833 443,883 Spain 2,391,085 2,624,967 2,231,534 3,036,925 3,624,545 3,205,255 All Others 14,764,819 15,029,170 10,502,917 12,076,570 13,367,336 11,190,470 World 253,366,569 238,218,487 195,070,087 272,712,351 325,623,404 256,805,421\n\nCIF US Port Value (USD)\n\nCountry 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 South Korea 138,053,639 137,765,420 96,932,465 353,926,868 520,600,797 217,069,374 Taiwan 39,117,893 31,924,176 19,497,740 36,874,253 71,498,380 56,786,479 Thailand 41,323,601 32,320,042 20,574,231 26,200,848 27,758,173 21,731,991 China 9,414,372 4,074,545 5,746,419 18,155,280 13,115,539 6,953,117 India 4,849,828 2,114,678 1,131,378 5,171,955 12,684,139 8,129,122 Subject Countries 232,759,333 208,198,861 143,882,233 440,329,204 645,657,028 310,670,083 Canada 28,896,108 29,543,250 35,632,978 41,039,921 46,313,301 45,545,058 Mexico 2,376,766 680,000 1,793,988 4,846,070 13,252,853 11,558,670 Sub-Total 31,272,874 30,223,250 37,426,966 45,885,991 59,566,154 57,103,728 Germany 83,441,780 85,446,323 77,003,307 82,015,423 105,953,138 84,657,551 Netherlands 24,109,096 20,797,420 13,614,290 22,493,392 34,468,659 27,589,826 Japan 47,671,795 47,250,739 34,359,929 41,446,267 52,900,373 45,672,143 Czechia 1,248,819 1,770,512 1,170,119 4,754,365 8,382,889 1,044,788 Spain 9,709,604 9,063,870 7,163,148 10,001,639 14,522,920 14,203,573 All Others 49,341,235 46,488,175 36,383,180 45,284,259 59,557,600 52,403,035 World 479,554,536 449,239,150 351,003,172 692,210,540 981,008,761 593,344,727\n\nAverage Unit Price (USD / Pound)\n\nCountry 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 South Korea 1.43 1.32 1.16 2.36 2.83 1.74 Taiwan 1.42 1.26 1.16 2.23 2.20 1.42 Thailand 1.36 1.23 1.13 2.12 2.65 1.71 China 1.37 1.94 1.48 2.16 2.07 1.70 India 1.77 3.01 1.46 2.60 2.83 1.72 Subject Countries 1.42 1.31 1.17 2.33 2.72 1.67 Canada 2.19 2.44 2.58 3.23 3.94 4.03 Mexico 1.48 1.91 2.29 2.83 3.67 3.05 Sub-Total 2.11 2.42 2.56 3.18 3.87 3.78 Germany 2.77 3.66 2.90 2.70 3.96 4.03 Netherlands 1.60 1.57 1.48 1.79 2.51 2.74 Japan 4.30 4.25 4.38 4.61 4.68 4.80 Czechia 1.31 1.20 1.13 2.22 2.25 2.35 Spain 4.06 3.45 3.21 3.29 4.01 4.43 All Others 3.34 3.09 3.46 3.75 4.46 4.68 World 1.89 1.89 1.80 2.54 3.01 2.31\n\nOverview of ADD/CVD proceedings\n\nThere are two phases – preliminary and final – of ADD and CVD investigations. The Department of Commerce (\"DOC\") will determine whether imports of epoxy resin from the targeted countries were dumped in the United States, and establish the antidumping duties that will be imposed. It will also determine whether the governments of the targeted countries subsidized exports of epoxy resin to the United States. The International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten to materially injure, the domestic industry.\n\nIn order for final ADD and CVD to be imposed, both agencies must issue \"affirmative\" findings. We discuss below the steps involved in reaching such findings.\n\nA. DOC Dumping Investigation\n\nBy April 23, 2024, DOC must decide whether the ADD petition contains the legally required information regarding Petitioners' standing, dumping, and injury to warrant initiating an investigation. The standard for initiation is low, requiring only that the ADD petition contains information that is \"reasonably available\" to Petitioners. Consequently, we expect DOC will initiate the ADD investigation by the April 23 deadline.\n\nDOC will issue a questionnaire to, and calculate a dumping rate for, one or more producers in each of the targeted countries. These producers are referred to as \"mandatory respondents.\" The decision of which producers will receive the questionnaire will be based on export volumes. DOC could choose only one producer from each targeted country to respond to the questionnaire if it is possible to account for 80%-85% of exports with just one producer. If not, DOC will choose two or more producers from each targeted country.\n\nThe companies that are selected as mandatory respondents will receive dumping rates based on their actual data. If a company refuses to respond to the questionnaire, it will be assigned a dumping rate based on \"adverse facts available,\" which is a punitive rate, typically based on the dumping rate calculated in the petition. The dumping rates alleged in the petition vary by country, as follows:\n\nCountry Alleged Dumping Rate China Ranging from 264.87% to 351.97%. India Ranging from11.43% to 17.50% South Korea Ranging from 30.01% to 69.42%. Taiwan Ranging from 87.19% to 136.02%. Thailand Ranging from 163.94% to 205.63%.\n\nBecause DOC considers China as a \"non-market economy\" (\"NME\"), DOC begins its investigation under the assumption that all exporters are part of a single, government-operated China-wide entity,\" which will be subject to a \"China-wide\" antidumping duty margin. This margin is often based on \"adverse facts available,\" making it punitively high. Companies that demonstrate sufficient independence from the Government of China may receive a separate dumping rate based on their actual data.\n\nAll other producers from each country (other than those that are issued the questionnaire) will be subject to each country's \"All Others\" Rate, which normally is calculated as the weighted average of the rates assigned to the mandatory respondents in each country.\n\nThe ADD questionnaire will request detailed information regarding US sales and home-market sales of epoxy resin (transaction-specific prices, direct selling expenses, movement expenses, etc.) and production costs during the period of investigation (\"POI\"), which will be the period of April 1, 2023, through March 31, 2024, and October 1, 2023, through March 31, 2024 for China. DOC will also issue multiple supplemental questionnaires to clarify information reported in the initial response. The burden of responding to the questionnaires is significantly increased if: (1) companies affiliated with the mandatory respondent also produce and/or sell the subject merchandise in the targeted countries; and/or (2) key materials used to produce the subject merchandise are purchased from affiliated suppliers.\n\nWithin 140 days after the ADD investigation is initiated (we estimate by September 10, 2024), DOC must make a preliminary determination of whether dumping exists and, if so, the estimated dumping margin for each company investigated (DOC can, and often does, postpone the preliminary determination for an additional 50 days). If DOC makes an affirmative preliminary determination, Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") will suspend liquidation of entries of epoxy resin from the targeted countries and require importers to provide ADD cash deposits equal to the preliminary dumping margin calculated for the exporter multiplied by the entered value of the merchandise. Normally, the suspension of liquidation begins on the date DOC's preliminary determination is published in the Federal Register. However, if there are \"critical circumstances,\" the suspension can apply retroactively to imports made 90 days before the preliminary determination is published.\n\nDOC personnel normally visit the mandatory respondents' offices to verify the accuracy of the information provided in the questionnaire responses. This is normally done after the preliminary determination. If the questionnaire responses are incomplete or their accuracy cannot be verified, DOC will calculate dumping margins based on \"adverse facts available,\" which normally means accepting the dumping margins calculated by Petitioners. The verification is one of the most difficult aspects of the investigation.\n\nTo verify a respondent's reported information, DOC will send a team of verifiers and require access to confidential information, including the mandatory respondents' accounting records, sales and cost systems, and other sensitive information. In recent practice, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, DOC has first required companies to provide information related to safety and pandemic-related precautions. In the event that DOC determines that it cannot conduct an on-site, in-person verification due to travel or safety concerns, it may conduct a \"virtual verification\" through an online platform (e.g., Webex) as an alternative.\n\nWithin 75 days after the preliminary determination, DOC will issue a final ADD determination (as with the preliminary determination, DOC can, and often does, postpone this deadline for an additional 60 days). DOC's final decision is based on the verified information, public hearings, and briefs submitted by counsel involved in the case. If a zero-dumping finding is made, or only \"de minimis\" levels (i.e., less than 2.00%) of dumping margin are found, the investigation ends. If DOC's final ADD determination is affirmative, the case proceeds to ITC for a final injury determination. DOC will also instruct CBP to continue to suspend liquidation of entries of epoxy resin from the targeted countries and require ADD cash deposits at the final dumping margins determined for each exporter. Individual companies receiving zero or de minimis rates are excluded from the ADD order (if issued).\n\nB. DOC Subsidy Investigation\n\nAs with the dumping investigation, DOC must decide whether the CVD petition contains the legally required information regarding Petitioners' standing, subsidies, and injury to warrant initiating an investigation by April 23, 2024.\n\nDOC will then issue CVD questionnaires to the companies selected for investigation from the targeted countries, as well as to the governments of the targeted countries. Typically, DOC chooses the two or three largest foreign exporters to respond to the questionnaire. Again, these are referred to as \"mandatory respondents.\" The CVD questionnaire will seek information about the alleged subsidies for the POI (the most recently completed fiscal year – that is, 2023), as well as for prior years. DOC will likely issue one or more supplemental questionnaires seeking clarification or additional information.\n\nWithin 65 days after the CVD investigation is initiated (we estimate by June 27, 2024), DOC must make a preliminary determination of whether subsidization exists and, if so, the estimated CVD rate for each company investigated (DOC can, and often does, postpone the preliminary determination for an additional 65 days). If DOC makes an affirmative preliminary determination, CBP will (as in the dumping investigation) suspend liquidation of entries of epoxy resin from the targeted countries and require importers to provide cash deposits equal to the preliminary CVD rate calculated for the exporter multiplied by the entered value of the merchandise. Normally, the suspension of liquidation begins on the date DOC's preliminary determination is published in the Federal Register. However, if there are \"critical circumstances,\" the suspension can apply retroactively to imports made 90 days before the preliminary determination is published.\n\nDOC personnel will visit the mandatory respondents' offices to verify the accuracy of the information provided in the CVD questionnaire responses. DOC will also conduct on-site verifications of the information reported by the governments of the targeted countries. As in the dumping context above, DOC will first determine whether an on-site verification is feasible with respect to health and safety precautions and may conduct a \"virtual verification\" as an alternative to an on-site, in-person verification.\n\nWithin 75 days after the preliminary determination, DOC will issue a final CVD determination. DOC's final decision is based on the verified information, public hearings, and briefs submitted by counsel involved in the case. If a zero-subsidy finding is made, or only \"de minimis\" levels of subsidies (i.e., less than 1.00%) are found, the investigation ends. If DOC's final determination is affirmative, the case proceeds to ITC for a final injury determination. DOC will also instruct CBP to continue to suspend liquidation of entries of epoxy resin from the targeted countries, and require CVD cash deposits at the final subsidy rates determined for each exporter. Individual companies receiving zero or de minimis subsidy rates are excluded from the order.\n\nC. ITC Injury Investigation\n\nITC is currently scheduled to make a preliminary determination (that is, the Commissioners will vote) no later than May 20, 2024. The preliminary investigation will move very quickly. The legal standard that ITC must apply in reaching its preliminary determination is very low. Essentially, ITC must issue an affirmative preliminary injury determination unless it is clear that the US industry is not being injured or is not threatened with injury. Any doubt requires ITC to continue the investigation. Because this standard is so low, it is extremely difficult to terminate an investigation at the preliminary stage. In the final injury investigation, ITC has considerably more time to conduct its investigation and consider the facts and arguments presented by the parties. The legal standard is also higher in the final phase. Therefore, foreign producers are more likely to succeed at the final stage of ITC's investigation than at the preliminary stage. Nevertheless, it can be advantageous for foreign producers and importers to participate in the preliminary phase of the investigation so they can frame themes and issues for ITC's consideration in the final phase.\n\nITC will base its preliminary injury determination primarily on information received in responses to the questionnaires sent to US producers, US importers, and foreign producers. Typically, the ITC circulates these questionnaires to parties within two to three business days of the filing of the petition (i.e., on or around April 5, 2024); and sets the deadline for them a week before the Staff Conference, discussed below (i.e., on or around April 17, 2024). It is important that foreign producers timely submit responses. Otherwise, ITC likely will accept Petitioners' allegations, resulting in an affirmative preliminary injury determination.\n\nITC Staff will conduct a conference on or around April 24, 2024. At the conference, interested parties will have an opportunity to present oral testimony and answer ITC Staff's questions. Afterwards, parties will have an opportunity to present written arguments (and supporting exhibits) in post-conference briefs, which will be due on or around April 29, 2024.\n\nIn the final phase, the ITC conducts a more thorough investigation, with a much higher standard of injury. For the final phase, the ITC crafts more detailed questionnaires for issuance to US producers, US importers, and foreign producers, as well as (unlike in the preliminary phase) for issuance to US purchasers. Before issuing the questionnaires, ITC Staff circulates draft questionnaires for the parties' comments, which is an important opportunity to ensure the questionnaires solicit information needed to support the defense. After issuing and receiving responses to the questionnaires, ITC Staff prepares a report summarizing and discussing the information and data reported in the questionnaire responses, as well as information compiled from the preliminary phase of the investigation and ITC Staff's independent research. The ITC Staff's report is important because it is a key document relied upon by the Commissioners in evaluating whether the US industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury because of the cumulated subject imports. After issuance of the ITC Staff report, parties have approximately one week to submit briefs (\"prehearing briefs\") presenting their arguments supporting or opposing an affirmative determination of material injury (or threat thereof). Normally one week after the deadline for prehearing briefs, ITC holds a public hearing at which the Commissioners (i.e., the decision makers) preside. During the hearing, both sides – Petitioners in support of ADD/CVD and the foreign producers and US importers/purchasers opposed to ADD/CVD – will each have one hour to make an affirmative presentation, followed by a question-and-answer session with the Commissioners. For the defense, in particular, it is critical that industry witnesses (such as importers and US purchasers) opposed to the imposition of ADD/CVD participate and testify at the ITC hearing. After the hearing, the parties have approximately one week to prepare \"posthearing\" briefs, which typically focus on rebutting the other side's arguments and answering specific questions raised by the Commissioners at the hearing. Several days before the date of the ITC's scheduled vote, parties have one last opportunity to submit final comments in the case. Unlike the preliminary phase, which takes place over the course of approximately six weeks, the final phase normally takes place over the course of approximately four months.\n\nCalendar of proceedings\n\nThe table below provides key deadlines* for the DOC and ITC ADD proceedings.
