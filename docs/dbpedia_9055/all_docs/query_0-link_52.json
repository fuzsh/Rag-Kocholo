Chemical production and processing often requires very specialized equipment, and personnel who have gone through an extensive certification process. This can be a hard barrier for many companies to overcome, especially for those who don’t have the budget or time to set up an in-house production facility.\n\nRead More\n\nThe acrylic latex polymer is one of the critical building blocks for modern industrial chemistry, especially in a wide range of different coatings and paints. Acrylic polymers and emulsions are a vital ingredient for household, commercial, and industrial paints and coatings, imparting a number of beneficial properties and improving the overall performance of these products.\n\nRead More\n\nAcrylate monomers are one of the most important and most versatile groups of monomers in the development of coatings. They serve as the foundation for the polymers that optimize paints, coatings, adhesives, sealants, and much more, and can be found across a wide range of industries as a result.\n\nRead More\n\nIf you were to browse through Gellner’s website, you’ll likely notice that on many of our product pages, we have separated out our emulsion polymer products by whether or not they are cationic, anionic, or nonionic, with cationic and anionic being the most common categories. Emulsion polymers have a wide range of applications, from water treatment to personal care, and pharmaceuticals to our specialty, coatings and inks.\n\nRead More"
