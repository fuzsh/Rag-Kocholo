        "text": "Step by Step Liquid Glass Instructions\n\nThis is our typical instructions for our products. We understand everyone’s environment, project and applications may be different. if you have questions, don’t hesitate to call us at 888-849-0588. We would love to go over your project with you, and if you don’t get us on the phone (we are probably on the other line), send us an email here.\n\nSTEP 1:\n\nUsing the Coverage Chart, determine the amount of epoxy you will need for your project. Be sure to order SuperClear Table Top Epoxy for a seal coat to ensure best results!\n\nSTEP 2:\n\nEnsure your working environment is clean, dry and at least 70 degrees for best results. Lay down a plastic sheeting below your project for a safe, easy cleanup. Make sure your surface is completely level, as the epoxy will self-level.\n\nSTEP 3:\n\nSeal Coat: Be sure to clean the surface with Isopropyl Alcohol 90% + and apply your sealcoat with a brush, following all mixing directions for that product. Let it get tacky before pouring your deep pour. If the seal layer is fully cured, for best results, lightly sand the surface with 320 grit sandpaper and clean with Isopropyl Alcohol 90% +, and then pour the deep pour.\n\nSTEP 4:\n\nMixing Deep Pour: Measure 2 parts Resin to 1 part Activator and pour into a clean, dry bucket or cup. Stir the mixture for at least 5 minutes with either a stir stick (if mixing with a stir stick, do not mix more than 1 quart) or a drill mixer set to low. Ensure you are not whipping air into your epoxy. Be sure to scrape the sides and bottom to ensure all of your epoxy is properly mixed.\n\nSTEP 5:\n\nTransfer contents to a new, clean, dry bucket or cup and continue mixing for 3 more minutes to ensure proper mixing, again scraping sides and bottom.\n\nSTEP 6:\n\nPour mixture directly into your mold at your desired depth.\n\nSTEP 7:\n\nUse a heat source, like a heat gun to remove any air bubbles. Start at 6” minimum above the surface and sweep back and forth until no bubbles remain. Do not leave the heat gun over the surface too long, as to prevent surface distortions.\n\nSTEP 8:\n\nAllow the surface to cure, up to 72 hours in a dust-free environment. The epoxy will start to get tacky after 24 hours but do not disturb for 72 hours to ensure a proper cure.\n\nLiquid Glass FAQ’s\n\nHOW LONG DO I HAVE TO MIX IT?\n\nYou need to stir it by hand for a minimum of 6 minutes, scraping the sides and bottom thoroughly throughout while mixing. When pouring, we do not recommend scraping the sides. Doing so can risk mixing in unmixed, unincorporated epoxy into your pour, thus creating curing issues.\n\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CURE?\n\nThe product will begin to harden within the first 8-12 hours in ideal conditions, but takes around 24 hours to completely cure. This is dependent upon conditions like constant temperature, humidity, mass and airflow.\n\nCAN I MIX PIGMENT/DYE/MICA POWDER?\n\nYou can mix nearly all alcohol dyes, mica powders, and liquid pigments with our product, not to exceed 12%. However, we do not recommend acrylic based colorants as they can negatively react with the epoxy.\n\nCAN I ADD ANOTHER LAYER TO THE SURFACE?\n\nYes! Simply wait until the pour is tacky and nearly hard and pour your next layer. If the product is already hard, lightly sand with 240 grit sandpaper and wipe it down with Isopropyl Alcohol 90% or higher before adding additional layers, which helps with the adhesion between the two layers.\n\nCAN I APPLY IT OVER WOOD, CONCRETE AND COUNTERTOPS?\n\nAbsolutely! With any surface, you want to ensure the surface is clean and dry before applying. As always, we recommend a seal coat before applying thicker coats.\n\nDO YOU NEED TO APPLY A SEAL COAT?\n\nWe highly recommend a seal coat, which is a very thin coat of Superclear applied to the surface to prevent air bubbles and any residual moisture from the substrate getting into your thick pour. Make sure that the pour surface on your substrate is properly sealed. You can use our SuperClear Table Top Epoxy to easily seal by applying with a paint brush.\n\nIT’S COLD AND THE EPOXY IS REALLY THICK, WHAT DO I DO?\n\nUnder 65 degrees, our epoxy may start to thicken up. You may even see some crystallization. Don’t worry, the epoxy is perfectly fine! Before mixing, bring a pot of water up to a steady 75-80 degrees, and then put each bottle of epoxy in there until they come up to temp between 75-80 per bottle. Do not mix first and then bring up to temp. Once the epoxy is up to temp, you can now begin the mixing process.\n\nHOW THICK CAN I POUR IT?\n\nYou can pour up to 1” thick per pour, depending on ambient temperature and total mass. Much thicker than most competitors! The mass for a 1” pour varies depending on temperatures and conditions. If you have never poured a deep pour at 1”, we suggest you try it on a smaller scale to understand how it will cure in your particular environment.\n\nHOW CLEAR IS YOUR EPOXY?\n\nOur epoxies are the clearest Epoxy on the market with breathtaking clarity and long lasting beauty. CAN I USE THIS ON TOP OF AN OIL BASED STAIN? No, epoxy will not adhere to oil based stains.\n\nWHAT IF I CHIP THE EPOXY?\n\nNot a problem. This is easily fixed by rough sanding the area, clean the area with isopropyl alcohol, and then repour more of our epoxy. Let that cure. Sand down to desired surface, and then buff to your desired shine.\n\nCAN I PAINT OVER THE EPOXY?\n\nYes, once it is completely cured, you can paint over the top of it.\n\nWHAT ARE THE IDEAL AMBIENT TEMPERATURES WHEN WORKING WITH THIS EPOXY?\n\nThe ideal ambient temperatures are between 70-84F. This temperature varies due to each application being different. A good rule of thumb is that the more volume you are pouring, the lower the temperature should be."
