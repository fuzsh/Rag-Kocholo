The price developments of epoxy resin are expressed in US$ prices converted FX rates applicable at the time when the price was valid. epoxy resin price index developments are calculated from multiple separate sources of data to ensure statistical accuracy.\n\nThe outlook for epoxy resin prices, on the second tab, is generated from different inputs including:\n\nVery recent price developments of immediate cost drivers of epoxy resin prices\n\nRecent price developments of underlying feedstocks which drive the price of epoxy resin\n\nMarket futures for both cost drives and feedstocks of epoxy resin prices\n\nAdjustment of current supply/demand imbalances in the epoxy resin market\n\nLonger term trends in likely demand conditions\n\nFurther information on the Epoxy Resin price index\n\nHere is some further information\n\nWhat is an Epoxy resin\n\nAn epoxy resin is a type of polymer that is made up of two main components: an epoxy resin and a hardener or curing agent. When these two components are mixed together, a chemical reaction occurs that causes the resin to cure and harden into a solid material.\n\nEpoxy resins are known for their excellent chemical and temperature resistance, as well as their high strength and durability.\n\nHow is an epoxy resin produced\n\nEpoxy resins are produced through a process called polymerization, in which monomers are combined to form the polymer chain. The process begins with the production of the monomers, which are typically produced through the petrochemical industry.\n\nThe monomers are then mixed together and heated in a reactor to initiate the polymerization reaction. The temperature and pressure in the reactor are carefully controlled to ensure that the monomers are converted into the polymer chain efficiently. The resulting product is a liquid resin.\n\nTo make an epoxy resin, the resin is mixed with a hardener or curing agent, which causes the resin to cure and harden into a solid material. The hardener is typically a compound that contains an amine or a polyamine, and when it is mixed with the resin, it causes a chemical reaction that results in the formation of a solid material.\n\nOther ingredients may be added to the resin and hardener mixture to modify the properties of the final product, such as to improve its strength, flexibility, or electrical conductivity. These ingredients may include fillers, such as glass fibers or carbon fibers, as well as additives to improve the processability of the material.\n\nIt is important to note that the exact ingredients and process used to manufacture epoxy resins may vary depending on the specific application and desired properties of the final product.\n\nWhat is an epoxy resin used for\n\nEpoxy resins are known for their excellent chemical and temperature resistance, as well as their high strength and durability. They are used in a wide range of applications, including:\n\nAdhesives\n\nEpoxy resins are often used as adhesives, as they bond well to a variety of surfaces and have good shear strength. They are commonly used in the construction and automotive industries, as well as in the aerospace and marine industries.\n\nCoatings\n\nEpoxy resins are used as coatings for a variety of surfaces, including metals, concrete, and wood. They are known for their good adhesion and corrosion resistance, making them suitable for use in harsh environments.\n\nComposites\n\nEpoxy resins are used in the production of composite materials, which are made by combining a reinforcing material, such as fiberglass or carbon fiber, with the resin. These materials are known for their high strength and lightweight properties and are used in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and sporting goods.\n\nOther\n\nEpoxy resins are also used in the production of electrical laminates, insulation materials, and as a matrix material in structural materials.\n\nFurther reading\n\nPubChem for chemistry and property information\n\nWikipedia\n\nTrade information about epoxy resins\n\nAccording to https://oec.world/ :\n\nEpoxide resins are the world’s 518th most traded product.\n\nIn 2020, the top exporters of Epoxide resins were Germany ($998M), South Korea ($852M), Chinese Taipei ($685M), United States ($562M), and Japan ($520M).\n\nIn 2020, the top importers of Epoxide resins were China ($1.32B), Germany ($443M), United States ($351M), Netherlands ($183M), and Italy ($177M).\n\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global epoxy resin market is expected to reach a value of $9.2 billion by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5.8% from 2020 to 2025. This growth is driven by increasing demand for epoxy resins in various industries, including construction, automotive, and aerospace. The report also notes that the Asia-Pacific region is expected to dominate the global epoxy resin market, due to the increasing demand for epoxy resins in the region and the availability of low-cost feedstock.\n\nBusiness Analytiq\n\nBE THE FIRST TO SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY!\n\nWhere does the data come from?\n\nThe source of the data are exclusively public non-confidential sources. We have no access to primary data\n\nThis the index trend of the price trend of the \"product category\" in general, and not a single specification of the product in particular\n\nThe data is a combination of contract and spot pricing\n\nOur algorithms are set up to eliminate significant product mix impact on the reported price\n\nWe combine public publications, import/export records, trading prices, company announcements, magazine articles, tweets, and other sources of ad-hoc public information.\n\nThe chart shows the our best approximation of the market trend based on our algorithm interpretation of the signals\n\nFor most indexes we have multiple sources and we focus on using statistically-correlated sources\n\nAs a function of our automation, it is likely that recent trends will be adjusted as we discover more information. So, for example, the price trend for February 2024 will be first calculated in February 2024 and adjusted in March, April and May 2024.\n\nWe will update the data trend as more information becomes available, and this means that recent trends will always be adjusted as we get more data available\n\nThe algorithm will regularly revise our understanding of market trends, and indicated market trends may change\n\nThe data is presented in US$. The UOM of measure is shown in the Index list table\n\nOur automated software and we do our best to create an accurate representation of the trend\n\nWhere does the data NOT come from?\n\nWe do not purchase data from any other source and republish it.\n\nWe will not purchase data from any other source and republish it\n\nWe do not extrapolate trends, even for the forecast. We look for other market signals and leading indicators\n\nWhat data should our company use?\n\nIf you are making decisions driving significant share of profit, we always recommend that you buy data from the companies who invest in direct primary market access such as ICIS, amongst many others\n\nOur data, at best, represents an estimate of the market trend based on public information\n\nWe have no direct access to the market, and we do not interview suppliers and customers\n\nOur automated analysis tools in the online software are set up to combine our data with other sources of data\n\nWe do not recommend that you use our data for direct price mechanisms, as we may change and improve the data trends over time, including historical data\n\nWhat does the quality indication in the main menu mean?\n\nQuality level A: Data is from a reliable and confirmed source\n\nQuality level B: Data is from multiple credible sources and there are no major statistical inconsistencies between them\n\nQuality level C: Data is from multiple credible sources and there are some statistical inconsistencies between them\n\nQuality level D: Data is from a single credible source, but we cannot verify the data\n\nQuality level E: Data is either:\n\nFrom a single source, which we consider reliable, but we cannot verify the data.\n\nFrom 2 or more sources which have some periods of contradicting trends.\n\nQuality level F: Data is from a single source which we consider indicatively correct, but the data is anecdotal and we cannot verify the data.\n\nWhat are the disclaimers?\n\nWe assume no responsibility or liability for any errors or omissions in the content of this site.\n\nThe information is provided on an “as is” basis with no guarantee of completeness, accuracy, usefulness, fitness for purpose or timeliness.\n\nBy their nature, outlooks are always uncertain\n\nHow often do we update the data?\n\nWe aim to update the data series on the 9th and 24th of each month (but we do not always make it for each chart)\n\nThe data for the current month and recent history are fine-tuned over time.\n\nWhat are we doing to improve the data?\n\nWe are continually improving our data collection and processing methods\n\nPricing data will be updated from time to time as we improve the accuracy\n\nWe are reviewing all data sources in the first half of 2024.\n\nThere will be continuous fine-tuning of the trend and forecast algorithm as part of that.\n\nThe key focus in 2024 is to add many additional indexes\n\nHow can i give feedback on the data or request for new indexes\n\nFeel free to contact us if you have a specific request.
