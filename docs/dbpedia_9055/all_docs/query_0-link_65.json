        "text": "I am a full time contemporary abstract artist and keeps a studio in Up state Newyork. I use acrylic paint, oil pastels and extreme texture mediums, ceramic, concrete, Epoxy resin, glass stones to convey my thoughts and emotions and to express my view through my work. There isn't any particular introduction for my work. I do not limit myself to one style or concept. Each piece i create perceive my inspiration from life events and experiences - Thoughts, Feelings, Moods, Conflicts, Anger, Love and Sad. I move between different styles, combining abstraction with figuration. As an artist, I feel it is my responsibility to convey a message of inspiration that evokes emotion and to bring joy, elegance, thoughtfulness to homes and spaces around the world. It has been a personal journey that I enjoy and treasure, and I hope others will feel the same.‚Äù\n\nI love working on Abstract pieces and sculptures as I fascinated by how soulful and powerful abstraction can be and how I can translate my feelings & emotions through it.\n\nIn my Sculpture series I am using only natural materials, like concrete, wood, ceramic and Resin to create each of these one of a kind creations. I love working with concrete ceramics and Resin because of its delicacy and its strength. Layers of glass stone, Epoxy resin and concrete mix which involves the multiple processing like concrete and glass stone framing, Resin pouring, glueing and scratching. Giving the artwork an extraordinary impression and sculptural qualities and give birth to my one-of-a-kind sculptural compositions. My hope is to inspire those who see my Artwork and sculptures to slow down and take the time to look more carefully at the beauty in unusual combinations of the piece.\n\nMy artwork is also curated for clients such as Samsung TV Frame. Which showcase my artwork while in Art Mode. The Frame TV is quite possibly the only TV you'll want to watch even when it's off.\n\nI have International private collections in the USA, UK, Canada, Great Britain, Russia, Germany, Italy, Norway, France, Switzerland, China, India, Qatar, Australia, New Zealand.\n\nGROUP AND SOLO EXHIBITIONS -\n\n2020 Most Promising Contemporary Artists- New York, United States\n\n2019 Lilac Festival Rochester, NY\n\n2019 Top national Artist from India, Indian Art commitiee - Nominated- Delhi, India\n\n2019 Small Works Show, 440 Gallery, Brooklyn, NY\n\n2019 SAMSUNG FEATURED ARTIST - Nominated, Saatchi Art- New York, United States\n\n2018 Participated in [SOLO] Art Expo New York\n\n2018 Satellite Art Show, Brooklyn, NY\n\n2017 Participated in [SOLO] Art Expo New York\n\n2017 World Art Dubai, World Trade Centre, Dubai (UAE)\n\n2017 Artscape/Baltimore's Festival of the Arts, July 18\n\n2017 [ SOLO ] Exhibition ArtExpo New York\n\n2017 Exhibited in Westside Art fair YMCA, Rochester,NY\n\n2016 Exhibited in 6*6 #roco6x6 Rochester Contemporary Art Center (RoCo)\n\n2016Community Arts/Crafts/Makers Show exhibition,Rochester,NY.\n\n2016 Exhibited in Winter Park Autumn Art Festival, Orlando,FL\n\n2015 Exhibited in 6*6 #roco6x6 Rochester Contemporary Art Center (RoCo)\n\n2015 Exhibited in M&T Bank Clothesline Festival\n\n2014 participated in Orlando Art exhibition.\n\n2014 Participated in New york Art exhibition"
