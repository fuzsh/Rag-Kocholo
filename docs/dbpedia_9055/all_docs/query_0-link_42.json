        "text": "Why Polyurea Concrete Is Better Than Epoxy for Garage Floors & Outdoor Spaces\n\nFrom its ability to prevent damage to being more affordable, polyurea and non-porous concrete solutions are better for home and business owners. Whether you want a new concrete application for inside or outside your property, polyurea is the best choice for you.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nSuperior durability to heat and UV.\n\nAble to withstand harsh impacts, spills, and other wear and tear.\n\nAdapts to concrete surfaces and offers greater flexibility.\n\nOptimal for everyday use, such as foot and vehicle traffic.\n\nAble to maintain a shiny, beautiful appearance for longer.\n\nFully Licensed and Insured\n\nGarage floors, outdoor patios, and driveways can sustain a lot of wear and tear over the years. Our fully licensed and insured team provides the ultimate protection for your garage floor, residential space, or commercial space from foot traffic, spills, UV rays, moisture, temperature changes, and other threats to your concrete.\n\nPrioritizing your property’s security and quality, every customer gets a 5-star review experience. When you choose us, you’ll receive world-class coatings from world-class professionals, ensuring top quality, safety, and exceptional style for years.\n\nSee What Our Customers Have to Say!\n\nWhy Choose Polyurea Over Epoxy\n\nMost companies still install epoxy flooring in your home. This is a no-no for your garage floor or any space that is not temperature-controlled. Polyurea and polyaspartic coatings are 4x stronger and 10x more flexible than epoxy. Unlike epoxy flooring, our coatings will not de-flake, delaminate, or peel due to temperature changes. WE FIX TONS OF EXOXY COATINGS IN GARAGE FLOORS. These outdated systems are still sold to the consumer today and are highly frowned upon. Check out our industry articles here to stay up-to-date on the latest garage floor coating news!\n\nWe offer several types of grip additives that can make your coatings slip-resistant. Our coatings don’t warp, fade, or deteriorate when exposed to harsh UV rays or inclement weather.\n\nPatriot Coatings LLC\n\nService Areas\n\nKansas City, MO\n\nTopeka, KS\n\nBirmingham, AL\n\nTuscaloosa, AL\n\nHuntsville, AL\n\nKnoxville, TN\n\nChattanooga, TN\n\nDenver, CO\n\nFort Collins, CO\n\nDallas, TX\n\nFort Worth, TX\n\nTampa, FL\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL\n\nHours of Operation\n\nMonday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM\n\nTuesday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM\n\nWednesday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM\n\nThursday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM\n\nFriday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM"
