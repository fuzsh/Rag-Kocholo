        "text": "When you notice signs of sewer line damage on your property, most homeowners’ first instinct would be to implement repairs the DIY way. However, that is not recommended as it could aggravate the issue and lead to further problems down the line.\n\nInstead, call in the experts at Accurate Leak and Line for fast and efficient repairs. Our plumbing experts remain on standby to answer your call and solve any problems you may have.\n\nWe don’t waste time when it comes to clogged sewer lines. Upon arriving at the scene, we perform a thorough ocular inspection of the premises to find the approximate area of the problem. We then used our state-of-the-art diagnostic tools to determine the extent of the problem.\n\nTo minimize the damage to your property, we employ minimally-invasive techniques to repair the area and rehabilitate your pipes. Using trenchless technology, we can repair any damage or replace broken sections without digging to protect your property.\n\nWe apply efficient, long-lasting solutions to fix sewer line problems in the least amount of time possible. Call us immediately for fast, reliable service.\n\nIn some cases, pipes may need replacement when their condition is beyond repair. When that happens, we employ a trenchless repair method known as pipe bursting to replace your old and corroded pipes. A bursting head is inserted into existing pipelines together with the new material until they burst. At the same time, the old lines are replaced with new high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as a more durable, long-lasting substitute.\n\nCIPP pipe repair is a trenchless, non-destructive repair technique we use to rehabilitate and restore your old pipes. This method involves the insertion of a textile liner tube and liquid resin that attaches itself to the inner section of your lines and cures in place. As the leader in pipe rehabilitation and underground plumbing diagnostics and repair, we employ cost-effective solutions that require little to no digging for fast and efficient service. Let our professionals take care of your trenchless sewer repair needs.\n\nProblems with your sewer line can be a source of anxiety and distress for any homeowner. It can be a source of even more frustration when you find that the ‘experts’ you turn to dig up your entire yard to access your pipes. Accurate Leak and Line has a better solution.\n\nAs an undisputed industry leader in pipe rehabilitation and repair, you can rely on Accurate Leak and Line’s plumbing experts to apply minimally invasive, environmentally friendly solutions to repair leaking sewer pipes and broken lines.\n\nWork with our hometown experts and enjoy the following perks:"
