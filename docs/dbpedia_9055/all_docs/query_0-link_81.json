        "text": "I am a professional graphic designer and mixed media artist. With a background in advertising, my digital work combines playful, bold color with a humorous nod to the absurd.\n\nThe 318 Collages mix Shreveport landmarks with vintage and modern cultural elements for a surreal look at my hometown.\n\nIn The Couch Series, I experiment with stunning color saturations and whimsical personalities to create story book portraits, reminiscent of album covers that captivated me in youth.\n\nMy mixed media pieces layer collage with epoxy resin inside wooden frames to create depth and resemble shadow boxes.\n\nI studied fine arts with a focus in studio painting at Stephens College, and graduated from the Art Institute of Dallas in 1993 with a degree in Music and Video Business. I honed my professional talents in the Dallas music industry before returning to Shreveport.\n\nLocally, I worked as an artist for National Mail-It and Millennium Group Advertising. I also served as Communications Director for the State Fair of Louisiana, designing the fair’s first web site, before joining Eldorado Resort Casino. I served as Eldorado’s artist for over eleven years and managed the casino’s brand aesthetic.\n\nIn 2016, I left the casino to pursue freelance graphic design and focus on my own artistic endeavors. I have a studio/gallery located in downtown Shreveport inside ArtiFact Louisiana. The majority of my work can be purchased at ArtiFact, but you can also find my works for sale at ArtSpace, Shreveport, Agora Borealis, and 318 Art & Garden.\n\nA love of travel and cultural events, have provided me with a camera roll of photos ready to create faux dreamscapes and depictions of the world around me.\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nDescribe your art in three words.\n\nColorful, Playful, Dreamscapes\n\nDescribe yourself in one word.\n\nColorful\n\nWhat do you love the most about creating art in Louisiana? What particular part of your immediate environment, in your neighborhood specifically influences your work?\n\nI love using photographs of old buildings and landmarks in my collages. I like to combine them with lots of color, surreal images and vintage photographs to depict my hometown in a new way.\n\nDescribe your creative process. Are there any rituals or rites of passage you exercise before you begin a new piece?\n\nI love to combine words with images. I often start with a particular photograph I want to play with or a new technique I'd like to experiment with. My most recent work is created inside wooden panels. I layer collage with epoxy resin over and over until I have filled up the reservoir. This creates depth and a shadowbox like effect.\n\nWhere do you draw inspiration?\n\nFrom architecture, interior design, nature, music\n\nWho are your artistic influences or gurus?\n\nMark Ryden and Dustin Yellen are just two of a long list!\n\nIn New Orleans, art and music go hand in hand. What type of music, band or song lyric best describes your work?\n\nI MUST listen to music when I am creating. I love electronic music most!\n\nWhere can we find you when you are not creating art?\n\nI love to travel, but when I am in my hometown, I love to support local restaurants, bars and the music scene.\n\nWhat is your favorite time of day/day of the week/month of the year?\n\nThe evenings are my favorite times of the day. I love the weekends and I love fall so I can go camping.\n\nWhat is something people don’t know about you? A fun fact.\n\nI love cartoons."
