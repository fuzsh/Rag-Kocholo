        "text": "Details\n\nLow Viscosity Infusion Epoxy\n\nOur System 4500 is a low viscosity epoxy system designed for the fabrication of parts and structures by the resin infusion method. This system flows extremely well, and produces dense, void-free laminates. The superior cured properties of this system produce items with good strength and toughness with excellent long-term stability. Combine this resin system with any of our Carbon Fiber, Kevlar or most fiberglass fabrics for lightweight, superior-strength composite parts.\n\nThis Infusion Epoxy System is available with two hardener options, a 40 minute pot life and a 70 minute pot life. The two hardener options are identical except for reaction time, so no matter which hardener is chosen, you can expect the same high performance properties. The mixed viscosity with both hardeners allows the material to flow very well, even in thin walled areas. It penetrates heavy fabric sections and wets out quickly for further ease of production.\n\nBoth hardeners will cure completely at room temperature, if required. The material will gel hard overnight at ambient temperatures around 77°(F). At this point in the cure, the bag and infusion materials can be removed from the laminate and the part can be sanded or trimmed as required. Full cure with these two hardeners will be achieved in 4 to 6 days at normal room temperature. A heat cure will shorten the curing time of System 4500 Infusion Epoxy. In situations where the laminate can be placed in an oven after a room temperature gel, curing times of 8 to 10 hours at 180°F or 14 to 18 hours at 150°F will provide 90% of full cured properties. Store and use at 70-90°F.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Storing/shipping this product at temperatures below 70°F can cause the product to thicken and separate. If this occurs the product will require gentle heating and stirring, prior to adding hardener, until the product is uniform and pourable.\n\nFeatures\n\nWill cure completely at room temperature, if necessary.\n\nMixed viscosity around 300 centipoise, so resin flows easily.\n\nThis epoxy system does not contain methylene dianiline (MDA), or any other potentially harmful aniline derivatives.\n\nTwo hardener options to fit your project needs.\n\nTips\n\nAllow material to gel completely prior to removal from mold.\n\nAdd heat to decrease post-gel cure times to as little as 8-10 hours.\n\nIf necessary, warm and stir until uniform.\n\nSpecifications\n\nMix Ratio 4:1 (Resin:Hardener) Pot Life 4570 - 70 Min 4540 - 40 Min Color Light Amber\n\nWARNING: This product can expose you to chemicals including Bisphenol A (BPA), which is known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.
