        "text": "I started working with epoxy resin and wood in the Spring of 2020, right after I got out of the Navy after serving 6 years Active Duty. I love that the possibilities of working with epoxy resin are literally only as limited as your imagination. Since I also work with hardwoods and do some woodworking, I have the ability to create functional artwork that serves a purpose, like furniture and home decor, as well as traditional artwork. There are so many different styles and trends to explore, and since the medium is still such a new niche in the art world, there’s so much room for artists to create totally new concepts that no one’s ever seen before! I never want to stop learning something new. That’s it. My brand is basically about using my base knowledge to figure stuff out as I experiment with things that are new to me. I hope my content inspires and empowers other people to start pursuing what inspires them, too!\n\nUsing 40 grit sandpaper on an orbital sander, sculpt the desired shape you want to resemble an organic live edge slab. This is where you can turn anything that would normally be viewed as flaws (dents, chips, cracks, knots, etc.), and you can turn them into highlights to give your piece character! After designing your initial shape, soften the rough edges with 120 grit sandpaper, then finish with 220 grit sandpaper.\n\nAfter drawing out the shape you want for your epoxy river or inlay area, use a jigsaw to hollow out the void. This step can take quite a while, so remember to be patient with it. If needed, take a break, get a snack, walk the doggo, and come back to it after getting your strength back up. This part is a marathon, not a sprint! It can also help to use your drill with a larger bit to make holes at areas with hard turns that the jigsaw might struggle getting around. This will help make your relief cuts easier too!\n\nAfter cleaning any sawdust off your lumber, use Tyvek tape to seal your epoxy river inlay area. Make sure to tape 3” or more outside of your void to ensure your tape barrier is making good contact with the wood. An optional step is to create a silicon dam around the perimeter of your river area. This allows you to slightly over-pour your inlay (to allow for shrinkage, small leaks, etc) without letting your resin overflow onto the rest of your wood. The last thing anyone needs is a river running rampant!"
