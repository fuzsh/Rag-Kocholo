In major industrial polymers: Epoxies (epoxy resins)

Epoxies are polyethers built up from monomers in which the ether group takes the form of a three-membered ring known as the epoxide ring:

In polyether

Epoxy resins, widely used as coatings and adhesives, are prepared by converting liquid polyethers into infusible solids by connecting the long-chain molecules into networks, a process called curing. Phenoxy resins are polyethers similar to those used in epoxies, but the polymers are of higher molecular…

In glue

…resin adhesives such as the epoxies are replacing glue for many uses, but glue is still widely used as an adhesive in woodworking, in the manufacture of such abrasives as sandpaper, and as a colloid in industrial processes—e.g., the recovery of solid particles suspended in a liquid.

In adhesive: Structural adhesives

…into six structural-adhesive families: (1) epoxies, which exhibit high strength and good temperature and solvent resistance, (2) polyurethanes, which are flexible, have good peeling characteristics, and are resistant to shock and fatigue, (3) acrylics, a versatile adhesive family that bonds to oily parts, cures quickly, and has good overall properties,…

In materials science: Polymer-matrix composites

…the aerospace industry are the epoxies. Thermoplastics, on the other hand, are melted and then solidified, a process that can be repeated numerous times for reprocessing. Although the manufacturing technologies for thermoplastics are generally not as well developed as those for thermosets, thermoplastics offer several advantages. First, they do not…

In art conservation and restoration: Glass and other vitreous materials

…by the infusion of light-stable epoxy resin with an identical or similar refractive index to the glass itself. In recent years consolidation has also been carried out by using a variety of silane solutions as well as acrylic copolymers. Mending, meaning the rejoining of shards of glass, is carried out…

In floor covering: Epoxy resins

Flooring compositions based on epoxy resins have developed steadily, giving a hard, chemical-resistant, seamless, and firmly adherent floor covering. The resin and curing agent must be blended immediately before use; colours and fillers can be added. The comparatively high cost of epoxy-resin systems…

In plastic: Fibreglass

Epoxies are most often used as matrix resins, because of their good adhesion to glass fibres, although water resistance may not be as good as with the unsaturated polyesters.
