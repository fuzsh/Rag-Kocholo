The Invention

Originally used for dental fixtures, Epoxy was an invention of two scientist in 1930s, Dr.Pierrie Castan in Switzerland and Dr. Sylvan Greenlee in the United States. The first epoxies were ambercoloured solids but soon became widely available as adhesives. Today, more than 50 different substances known as epoxy resins are available and are used in a wide variety of applications.

What is Epoxy?

Epoxy is a class of polymers containing more than one epoxide group. Epoxy is usually processed with other chemicals to produce ‘epoxy plastics’. The vast majority of epoxy resins are industrial produced petroleum derivatives. Epoxy 4W/EP is a general purpose FR-4 epoxide resin laminate conforming to BSEN60893 3-2-EPGC202, based on a medium weave glass cloth. This material has excellent electrical, mechanical and fire resistance properties.

What makes it different?

Epoxy resin bonded glass fabric laminates offers a very high mechanical strength, low moisture absorption all combined with excellent electrical properties under both dry and humid conditions. Epoxy material is rigid with good dimensional stability and a good resistance to a wide range of working environments.
