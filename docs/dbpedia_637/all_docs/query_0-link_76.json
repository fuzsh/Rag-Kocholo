        "text": "Your Bowie County Dive Team has once again put together a fantastic opportunity for you to win some amazing prizes while supporting the dive team and making sure they have everything they need to operate safely and efficiently. Who's ready to win some cool stuff?\n\nThe Great Gun Raffle for 2024 gives you the chance to win one of nine amazing firearms, and chance at a suppressor tax stamp. You do not need to be present to win one of those items.\n\nSo, when you purchase that $50 ticket, or more than one, what might you win?\n\nHenry Golden Boy .22 Cal. LR / Lever Action Rifle\n\nRadical Firearms RF-15 Semi-auto in 5.56 NATO, 16\" Barrel\n\nMossberg Patriot Walnut Stock - 308 Win, 22\" Fluted Barrel\n\nRuger American RanchRifle 350 Legend, 16\" CHF Threaded Barrel\n\nGlock 19X, MOS Coyote, 19+1 9mm Pistol\n\nRock Island 1911 - GI Standard 5\" FS, HC 45acp 10+1\n\nCanik TP9 METE SFT MOS w/ Accessories\n\nTaurus USA856, Executive Grade38 Spl, Walnut, Tuned Trigger Pelican Vault Case\n\nBonus Drawing: (aka, but wait there's more)\n\nFor all of the above-mentioned items you could win but do not have to be present for, there is one more item you could win, but for this one, you have to be present. It's a specially selected bonus prize drawing that will happen for those on hand during the live drawings only.\n\nThose Live Drawings will be held at Alpha Defense, located at 1601 County Road 1214, in Texarkana, Texas. They will begin at 10 AM and finish up around noon.\n\nTickets are $50 each and only 300 will be sold.\n\nAll tickets will be drawn from each drawing, (except the bonus drawing) so yes, conceivably you could win every prize... not likely, but mathematically, it's possible.\n\nSo, how do you get some of those tickets? Contact Chris Sutherland at 808-909-4311.\n\nGet more information on the event's Facebook Page.\n\nThe Bowie County Dive Team is a non-profit 501c-3 organization serving the Bowie County community."
