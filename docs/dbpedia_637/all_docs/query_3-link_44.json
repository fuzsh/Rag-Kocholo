        "text": "Topline\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was chosen to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate Tuesday after spending more than four years running the Midwestern state—where he’s gotten help from his wife Gwen Walz, a former educator who’s taken on an unusually large policy role in her husband’s administration.\n\nKey Facts\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\nWhen her husband was serving in Congress, Walz worked “behind the scenes on some of the issues, and not necessarily in the forefront,” she told MPR in 2019 when asked about her public advocacy on expanding voting rights for felons, soon after her husband took office. “But this is a different time and a different position. So I’m thinking very carefully about how I approach that with responsibility, with integrity and kind of shine a light on some of those issues that I think Minnesota can get this done.”\n\nContra\n\nWalz’s policy work hasn’t been without controversy, as she and the governor’s office came under scrutiny in September 2019 when footage was deleted of a panel discussion the first lady participated in about a documentary on criminal justice reform. The discussion turned testy after attendees asked about race within the prison system, MPR reported, with one attendee writing in an email to Corrections Department officials that Walz and other panelists appeared “unprepared to discuss the correlations between race, access to quality education and the U.S. criminal justice system.” The Walz administration later expressed regret for its “overreaction” in trying to ensure footage of the discussion wasn’t circulated. In a statement, the first lady acknowledged “who I am: I’m a middle-aged white woman with privilege — with white privilege.” “And I am on a journey learning what that is about. And I need all of Minnesota to help me and help one another have this conversation.”\n\nWhat We Don’t Know\n\nWhat role Walz would take on, if any, should her husband become vice president. In her 2019 interview with MPR, the first lady noted she and the Minnesota governor have historically “always worked really closely together,” which she said shaped her decision to get an office in the Capitol and take on a bigger role in his administration—though it remains to be seen what her thinking could be should they end up back in Washington, D.C.\n\nKey Background\n\nHarris named Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday morning, ending weeks of speculation over her choice as the Minnesota governor’s name was floated alongside such other candidates as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz. The Minnesota governor previously served in the U.S. House before being elected governor in 2018, and prior to his political career served in the Army National Guard and as a social studies teacher, additionally taking on a role as the school’s football coach. Republicans have attacked Walz as being too far left in the hours since he was announced as Harris’ pick, with the Trump campaign claiming that by choosing the governor, “Kamala Harris not only bent the knee to the radical left, she doubled down on her dangerously liberal, weak, and failed agenda.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nForbesKamala Harris Picks Tim Walz As Running Mate: Here's What To Know About Him ForbesHere's What Polls Say About Tim Walz, Harris' VP Pick ForbesHow Tim Walz-Kamala Harris' Running Mate-Lost The NRA's Support On Guns"
