        "text": "Luke Bryan and Caroline Bryan's relationship has gone the distance.\n\nThe pair met in college in the late '90s and dated on and off for a few years before getting married in 2006. They went on to welcome two sons: Thomas \"Bo\" Boyer and Tatum \"Tate\" Christopher. They also helped raise Luke's nieces and nephew after the deaths of his sister, Kelly, and his brother-in-law.\n\nCaroline has been by her husband's side for all of his biggest career moments; she even supported the couple financially before Luke's career took off.\n\n\"My life is truly everything I could have dreamed it would be,\" he told PEOPLE in October 2013. Eventually, though, he dreams of settling down with Caroline and his kids on his farm. \"Rocking on a porch swing when I'm 75, with Caroline and with a yard full of grandkids,\" he once said. \"That's a big ol' fulfilled life for me.\"\n\nFrom their college days to their hardships, here is a complete timeline of Luke Bryan and Caroline Bryan's relationship.\n\nFall 1998: Luke Bryan and Caroline Bryan meet in college\n\nLuke and Caroline met when they were both students at Georgia Southern University. She was a freshman, and he was a senior.\n\n\"We met in college back in fall 1998. At a little bar called Dingus MaGee's in Statesboro, Georgia,\" Luke told HuffPost in 2012. He also told The Boot that, for him, it was love at first sight. \"It took me eight seconds to figure it out and it took her about eight years to figure it out,\" he admitted. \"I had to drink a lot before I could go talk to her, but I did. Somehow I managed to ease over there and somewhat be charming. It was one of those situations for me, it was like, 'Who is that and how do I go talk to her? And, yep, I'm going to marry that girl.' \"\n\nAlthough Luke may have known right away, Caroline told PEOPLE he still took it slow. \"We hung out as friends first and he never made a move on me,\" she said. \"I kissed him first! He was always so scared of making a girl feel uncomfortable, he wouldn't cross a line.\"\n\nEarly 2000s: Luke Bryan and Caroline Bryan date on and off\n\nAfter meeting, the couple dated on and off before breaking up for a longer period once Luke graduated college in 1999.\n\n\"We'd date a little in college, and then we'd break up,\" Luke told Kellie Pickler and Ben Aaron during a November 2018 episode of Pickler & Ben. \"And then I would be devastated. We'd get back together, break up. Then she would be devastated.\"\n\nLuke and Caroline's \"dark ages\" following his graduation, actually turned out to be beneficial for the pair.\n\n\"We were apart for 5½ years, which was kind of a blessing because I went off to Nashville, got all this going,\" he explained of his music career. \"She finished college. She went and actually had a career.\"\n\n2004: Luke Bryan and Caroline Bryan reunite and get engaged\n\nFollowing their time apart, Luke and Caroline reunited in the same town where they had first met. \"I was playing a little bar in Statesboro and she just happened to kinda be in town,\" he told HuffPost. \"We kinda saw each other and talked a little bit and then started emailing back and forth a little bit.
