        "text": "Veteran film director Bryan Forbes, best known for the cult 70s hit The Stepford Wives, has died aged 86.\n\nA spokesperson for his family said that he passed away surrounded by relatives at his home in Virginia Water, Surrey, after a long illness.\n\nThe East Londoner – born John Theobald Clarke – began his career as an actor and screenwriter before setting up his own production company in 1959 with fellow filmmaker Richard Attenborough.\n\nHe made his directorial debut with 1961’s Whistle Down The Wind – which starred child actress Hayley Mills, followed by a string of hits in the 60s and 70s including The Wrong Box, King Rat and Seance On A Wet Afternoon.\n\nForbes later became head of production at EMI-MGM-Elstree, overseeing such classics as The Railway Children and Tales Of Beatrix Potter.\n\nHowever he resigned from the post in 1971 and returned to directing, going on to make The Stepford Wives in 1975.\n\nThat film, based on Ira Levin’s best-selling novel, told the story of a small Connecticut town hiding some dark secrets beneath its seemingly perfect facade.\n\nIts stars included Forbes’ wife Nanette Newman – whom he married in 1955 – as well as Graduate star Katherine Ross.\n\nForbes’ later efforts included Cinderella tale The Slipper and The Rose and International Velvet, starring Tatum O’Neal.\n\nAlthough he last directed a movie in 1990, he continued to work as a writer and novelist, with his most recent book, A Soldier’s Story, published in 2012.\n\nAs well as Newman he is survived by his two daughters – TV presenter Emma Forbes and journalist Sarah Standing.\n\nFamily friend Matthew D’Ancona paid tribute to Forbes, calling him a ‘titan of cinema’.\n\n‘He was known and loved by people around the world in the film and theatre industries and known in other fields including politics,’ Mr D’Ancona said.\n\n‘He is simply irreplaceable and it is wholly apt that he died surrounded by his family.’"
