        "text": "If we have learned anything in the 42 years of listening, often compulsively, to Simple Minds, it’s the fact that the band’s most compelling music was usually down to the sinuous and trance-inducing bass lines of Derek Forbes. I first heard Simple Minds with the single “Sweat In Bullet,” and the fretless bass playing on that was a clarion call to make sure my eyes and ears were clapped on Mr. Forbes, since whatever he was doing in the song was of paramount importance. The only other bassist I could point to of comparable skill and vision was William “Bootsy” Collins.\n\nI loved Simple Minds from the very first, and over time, my ardor has grown to consider the band’s albums from 1979 to 1984 the finest musical arc of development of any artist I can name. Even the masters that influenced Simple Minds, were mortal and slipped, but the astonishing thing that their imperial period of albums showed was that it was possible for the acolytes to surpass the masters who inspired them without stumbling.\n\nTHE END WAS THE BEGINNING\n\nThe point at which Simple Minds finally showed their fallibility to these ears, was in 1984 following the heady blur of the “Sparkle In The Rain” Tour Le Monde and the decision to cut Forbes loose from the band. Forbes was friends with John Giblin and by the end of the tour in October of 1984, the Minds were in John’s studio in Barwell Court writing material for the next album. Knocking songs like “Oh Jungleland,” “All The Things She Said,” Ghost Dancing,” “Sanctify Yourself,” “Come A Long Way,” and “Once Upon A Time” into shape. The year had been a rush of gigs and revelry; with Forbes having a drunken argument with his girlfriend and crashing his car. This got in the press, who were all too happy to publish topless shots of his girlfriend, because that’s just how they roll on Fleet Street.\n\nIt was determined by then that Forbes was a bigger liability than asset to the band. The feeling was that he was not giving his all to the group effort. Spending too much time with his girlfriend. Jim Kerr had previously told him that they would not lead with the bass for this new batch of material being worked on. Forbes was called in to a meeting with Jim Kerr on the phone with band and management there and fired. Kerr had offered Giblin the position and he cleared it with his friend Derek before accepting. Forbes was stunned by the blow and gave Giblin the torch with his blessings and wondered what his next move would be.\n\nEARLY ADVENTURES\n\nLike many, Forbes spent his youth obsessing with football and not really getting into playing guitar until his teens. He was a guitarist by the late 70s, but when he got into the Scottish Punk band Subs, he was asked to play bass instead. They managed one single for Stiff Records in 1978 before disbanding. It was at that time that Jim Kerr popped the question to Forbes after his audition for The Rezillos got a thumb up from Jo Callis but naysays from Fay Fife and Eugene Reynolds.\n\nThe Simple Minds lineup was now Jim Kerr [vocals], Brian McGee [drums], Charlie Burchill [guitar, violin], Mick MacNeil [keys], Derek Forbes [bass], and Duncan Barnwell [guitar]. Their first gig as Simple Minds at Glasgow’s Mars Bar in 1978 had the band roaring out of the starting blocks with “Act Of Love.” That was the point where Bruce Findlay was exposed to the group and simply had to manage this band. Opening slots for luminaries like Squeeze and Ultravox had Forbes forming a friendship with the latter’s Billy Currie early on.\n\nArista A&R came with a signing offer contingent upon losing Barnwell; then deemed an incompatible fit with the rest of the band. Forbes cited the “Jim and Charlie Show” and how it fell to them to make the decision. His friend Barnwell then claimed that Jim and Charlie revealed to him they would sack Forbes once they made it. While the early songs were written by Kerr and Burchill, once they had MacNeil and Forbes on board, this would be changing.\n\nEARLY WAXING\n\nGAINING VIRGINITY\n\nEarly 1981 found the band courted by Virgin Records thanks to the enthusiasm of A+R man Ross Stapleton. Virgin bought them out of the Arista contact and the band entered a productive phase that saw them finally achieving chart action in various worldwide markets. The first of which being Australia where Stapleton hailed from and knew the market well.\n\nProducer Steve Hillage was kept very busy with the productive album sessions; so much so that he was hospitalized for a suspected heart attack which was merely stress related. Drummer Brian McGee finished the sessions and his time in the band as he didn’t like the time apart from his family. Meanwhile the album had grown into two albums. “Sons + Fascination” and “Sister Feelings Call” would mark a period of expansive growth as the band managed to unite Krautrock, Art Rock, and Funk [as noted up front by Peter Walsh] into a riveting hybrid cocktail of their own making. The first single, “The American,” made inroads to the UK charts for the first time.\n\nBy August of 1981, new drummer Kenny Hyslop (ex-Slik) joined up for the tour. The band hit Australia for a tour where the bill was Divinyls, Simple Minds, and Icehouse as A+R man Stapleton sagely teamed them with the locally ascendant and stylistically congruent Antipodean band. The tour helped to deliver Simple Minds with their first top ten placing as following on from the lead of “The American,” “Love Song” charted high in Oz.\n\nKenny Hyslop wasn’t fated to be their drummer for long but his primary legacy was taping NYC radio stations and capturing a horn riff from a Funk track that became the hook for “Promised You A Miracle; the band’s entrée into the British top ten charts and the euphoric calling card for their next album. Meanwhile, Sweden capitulated to the band’s charms with a gold album for “Sons + Fascination.”\n\nHyslop never gelled with the band and was replaced with Mike Ogletree (ex-Cafe Jacques) as the “New Gold Dream [81, 82, 82, 84]” writing sessions had begun in Edinburgh. What I wouldn’t give for a peek at a video Forbes and Kerr made of “Vienna” with the former in Midge Ure drag while the latter looked “every inch the doppelgänger of Ultravox’s Billy Currie.” By summer of ‘82 the time for hi jinx was over as the recording sessions for the new album were under way.\n\nTHE DREAM MADE FLESH\n\nThe album had Steve Lillywhite behind the desk and was a radical shift from the gossamer vibe of “New Gold Dream [81, 82, 83, 84].” Never as much as on my long-standing favorite from the album, “The Kick Inside Of Me.” On that furious gem, Forbes was slapping his bass so violently that he cut his thumb open; straying blood all over the place, but never stopping until the track was in the can. And we can hear every drop in the intensity of the track.\n\nAPRÉS MINDS\n\nThe “Sparkle In The Rain” tour followed and soon after recording “Don’t You [Forget About Me],” Forbes was on the outside of the Simple Minds mothership looking in. He retreated to his farm, ultimately hooking up with his pals, including Billy Currie, which led to him playing on the track “India” on Currie’s first solo album. It’s regretful he didn’t play on every track since “India” was the best track by far on an admittedly great album.\n\nForbes had an offer to play on a Frida Lyngstad album but before he could say “yes,” his old Simple minds press agent, Keith Bourton, was also managing a fine stable of bands including Propaganda. With the added incentive of Steve Jansen as their rhythm section for a two week tour. Quoth Forbes, “wow, thought I, he’s great!” What began with the “Value Of Entertainment” shows at the Ambassador Theater ended up lasting for a seven year run with the band. Eventually re-linking with Brian McGee on drums after Jansen left to form The Dolphin Brothers.\n\nDuring Propaganda’s layoff as they extricated themselves from their ZTT contract, Forbes would still socialize with Charlie Burchill and even the full band. It was during one of his larks with Charlie that he met Wendy Kemp, who would become his wife soon afterward. Indeed, his proposal happened only a week after meeting her!\n\nRETURN TO SIMPLE MINDS – YEA AND NAY\n\nAfter his family, including his son, Kai, had stabilized, Forbes was invited to Bonnie Wee Studios in late 1988 to hear the songs which would become “Street Fighting Years” and was given an invitation to return to playing and writing with Simple Minds at a generous wage, but the songs didn’t convince and he wisely [for my ears] demurred. Forbes bass would have no place in the gaseous events which were the songs of “Street Fighting Years.” Next to that offer, staying with his year old son was far more compelling.\n\nThe book ended on that note with a scant coda barely mentioning a few of the other gigs that Forbes had occupied his time with over the last quarter century. Such as his talk show on Los Angeles radio, “May The Forbes Be With You.” Or his stints in Big Country, The Alarm, the Zanti album, or his current Derek Forbes + The Dark. Has it really been that long since “Néapolis?” That album was an intriguing example of the band trying to tap into the trance vibe that looked back to the group’s first classic era encompassing “Real To Real Cacophony” to “Sister Feelings Call.” That it didn’t connect in quite the same fashion or with the same level of success might be put down to the fact that the “Jim And Charlie Show” were firmly in control.\n\nTheir sole album for Chrysalis Records was deemed a flop and that seemed to really rattle the band; kicking off a fallow period for the group that saw them wondering aloud if they still had it in them. That Simple Minds Tours Ltd. preferred to keep Forbes as an employee rather than cutting him a slice of the pie as a writer spoke of the values at work there. I have to look back on that period as a missed opportunity for Simple Minds that only paid some of the potential dividends we could have luxuriated in.\n\nWhile this book was heavy on the touring hi jinx [in fairness, it is titled “A Very Simple Mind On Tour”] and lighter on the creative nuts and bolts I had been hoping for, one aspect where it surpassed expectations was in providing an unfettered voice of Forbes throughout its pages. It was pure, unfiltered Derek Forbes with nary a ghost writer within miles of its pages. A refreshing occurrence in the now locked down and gentrified rock autobiography world.\n\nBOOK TOUR\n\nForbes has already begun a UK book tour this month with the following dates still yet to happen. Of special interest would be the Liverpool date at British Music Experience, where there will be an interview hosted by Kevin McManus as well as acoustic music from Forbes."
