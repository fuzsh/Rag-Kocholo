        "text": "Nanette Newman is most famous for two things. The first is the enduring image of her in the Fairy Liquid advert, and the second is her 58-year-long indestructible marriage to the late film director, Bryan Forbes.\n\nEach has had a lifetime of successes, both together and apart. Forbes has a string of hit films to his name (The Stepford Wives, International Velvet, King Rat, The Raging Moon), as well as 72 scripts, 12 novels and two autobiographies.\n\nAnd Newman, as well as acting (in nine films directed by Forbes, including The Stepford Wives and International Velvet), has written 32 books, mostly cookbooks and children’s books.\n\nAnd yet for all this, the biggest self-declared success of all was their happiness — from when they met on set when she was 17, right up to Forbes’ last moments in her arms in May 2013.\n\nSumming up her life she says simply: ‘Marrying him was the cleverest thing I’ve ever done.’\n\nAlong with their children, the presenter Emma Forbes and the journalist Sarah Standing, Nanette nursed her adored husband in the house outside London in which they had lived together for five decades.\n\nWhen he died after a long illness from smoking-related emphysema and a complex heart condition, a Puccini aria was playing and the garden was in full bloom.\n\n‘He used to call us “my three women”,’ Newman says with a smile.\n\n‘We were with him right up until the moment he closed his eyes, which is an incredible thing to be able to do.’\n\nToday, at 82, Nanette Newman is as beautiful and composed as ever, despite the landscape of her life having shifted violently around her.\n\nWe meet on the eve of the publication of a new children’s book, The Importance Of Being Ernest The Earwig, her 25th, about an earwig with grand pretensions.\n\nThe book is more than just another publication. It is a symbol of her resilience, of her refusal to go under from grief and her determination to continue, however hard at times, to create for herself a new life alone.\n\n‘I suppose I want people to understand that it is so nice if [out of the grief] you do something, if you can create something. It doesn’t matter what you do really, but keep life going, even if it’s never smooth.\n\n‘After Bryan died, I obviously had to come to terms with the fact that the man I had been with and who I loved desperately from the age of 17 was no longer in my life, and that is a terrifying thing,’ she says quietly.\n\n‘Being married a long time is like having the greatest friend in the world. We adored each other. We were so lucky we had each other.’\n\nThe early months following his death were the worst, she remembers, because she was in their home, surrounded by their possessions. The desk where Forbes continued to write his novels even in ill health, the bed... all was empty with him gone.\n\n‘It was all filled with happy memories but also things that could make you sad,’ she recalls. ‘So I thought, I’ve got to move. It’s too big for one person, and truly, I did have this vision of myself with cobwebs in my hair, wandering around.\n\n‘I was becoming like Miss Havisham. I was wandering from room to room. I would go and sit in front of the fire and think “When Bryan was with me, we’d go and have a laugh and a glass of wine.”’\n\nNewman was, she admits, caught between a rock and a hard place: the absolute survival instinct of needing to put one foot in front of the other, to not, as she puts it, ‘go under’ from sadness and grief, versus the dreadful, but necessary, trauma of packing up and leaving the only home she’d ever known.\n\n‘It was where the children were born and where every part of my life had been. It was a very scary thing and very difficult — an enormous trauma.\n\n‘But I was so lucky because I have got — being boastful — the two best daughters in the world and I have a great family. They all were so wonderful at getting me through that difficult period, just by loving me and making me step out a bit more.’ Nothing happened quickly, she remembers. She saw lots of houses in the same area — ‘hated some, quite liked others’ — until she came across the one we’re sitting in today, which is much smaller than the vast rambling pile she shared with Forbes, but still big and light and airy.\n\nIt was a new start, built firmly on the foundations of her old life, sustained by familiarity in many forms and the unconditional love of her daughters, her five grandchildren and, three months after Forbes’ death, the joyous arrival of her first great-grandson (‘a mega mega joy!’).\n\nShe approached it, she says, not with a false sense of assurance, but with the shaky optimism that ‘it would eventually turn out okay’.\n\n‘Everything around me is from the old house, even the coffee table which everybody said would be too big. You get quite bolshy. The biggest wrench was Bryan’s books, but I decided to do away with a dining room and bring as many as I could.’\n\nWidowhood brought daily practical changes to Newman’s life, particularly acute given she is of a certain generation where domestic tasks ran along gender lines. Her son-in-law now looks after her finances, for example, and even the most basic hitch in utilities still leaves her at sea. ‘Right from when I married Bryan, I was rather spoilt,’ she admits.\n\n‘If I said “Oh god, the boiler’s gone!” He’d say “I’ll get someone in to fix it.”\n\n‘Bryan sort of took all that over. Now, I’m on my own and the oven goes wrong, I stare at it. It’s like I live in a foreign country. An iPad is like a foreign country. I am so annoyed with myself. I have various people I ask now, usually people visiting.’\n\nCooking too, once a glorious shared pleasure, has become a bother for one.\n\n‘When Bryan was alive, the house was always full and I cooked and cooked and cooked, but now, living on my own, I look at the fridge in the evening and think “Will I cook myself something?” and the answer is “No, I don’t want to sit and eat on my own”, so I eat things like yoghurt and granola.\n\n‘That makes my children really angry. They are always bringing me health food.’\n\n‘I don’t have a glass of wine by myself anymore, but I do when I go out. I’ve never liked parties, but I love going to friends’ houses to discuss politics or films and only last week the whole family was together; noisy and chaotic.’\n\nIt was Newman’s continued love of being with her family and friends — and of life itself — that helped her begin to smile again. She didn’t bury herself away, she explains, and she always tried to imbue her days with a sense of purpose, be it old hobbies such as painting (she has an enviable studio) or new ones such as sculpting classes.\n\nDo something, anything, she advises those who are bereaved, because distracting yourself when you are grief stricken is a helpful tool to stem the tears.\n\n‘Keep busy’ is the only piece of advice she will impart, respectful as she of the fact that we all grieve differently and at a different pace.\n\n‘There are no rules. But I am a great believer in working, so you’ve not got the time to sit down and sob and think “What if?” or “Why?” — I like working.’\n\nCollaborating on her latest book with the illustrator Lindsay Branagh, a friend of 14 years, was hugely instrumental and ‘happy making’ during the early phases of her new life. The idea formed in her mind, and fought its way to the top even when she was at her lowest.\n\n‘We had a laugh, we were on the same wavelength. We’d meet over a glass of wine or a cup of coffee and when we finally found a publisher, we came out of building and hugged each other. We couldn’t believe our luck.’\n\nDuring this period — and now, too — there would be offers of supper with her daughters, days spent with her new great-grandson, gatherings with her five grandchildren, trips away with friends.\n\nSlowly, there was also a gradual coming to understand and respect what she herself wanted in the fog of all the offers and attempts to scoop her up.\n\nNewman articulates a delicate two-step between loved ones taking the initiative and pulling her out of herself without her even having to ask them too — ‘wrapping their arms around me’ — while also now having reached a point of knowing her own mind, of knowing what suits her.\n\n‘When you are on your own, lots of people suggest things like “I think what you should do is go into the Himalayas and sit there and think for a month”.\n\n‘They always have lots of suggestions. But no, I like to wait and see how things pan out.\n\n‘I don’t plan very much. Things crop up. This year, I might go on holiday with a friend, I might join Emma and her husband, Sarah and I might do something... it depends what happens.’\n\nThe publication of her latest book is a big moment in Newman’s life, not just because she feels it is so much more difficult to get books published these days than when she began in 1972, but also because it is something deeply creative and rewarding to have come out of the difficult four years of grieving. She also says: ‘The book will make children laugh and that’s so important.’\n\nShe is already working on a follow-up and she also has a television play she’s written tucked away in a drawer, ‘which probably won’t ever see the light of day.’ But, of course, that’s not the point.\n\nThe received wisdom on grieving is that 18 months seems to be a magic number: that around then, things begin to get a bit more bearable.\n\nNewman is not so sure: ‘I don’t think there is a point where you say “Oh this week I’ve suddenly recovered”, “I’ve suddenly got over it”, or “I’ve been grieving for a year and now I’m up”. I don’t think it’s anything like that. It takes its time. It comes and goes.\n\n‘Until it happened to me, I didn’t understand it fully. You have all your happy memories, you have your family if you are lucky, but it’s not the person.\n\n‘The person is gone and that’s the difficulty. You still have days where you feel rather despairing and you feel incredibly sad and there is usually somebody who just helps to lift you out.\n\n‘Now, there still isn’t a day when I don’t think of Bryan and miss him, or wish he was here, and some days I feel it’s a gloomy day and I think “Oh god!” or “I’m writing this and if Bryan was here, he’d make me have a glass of wine and we’d talk about it”.\n\n‘People say to you when somebody dies: “Is it getting better?” ‘But it never ever gets any better. It just gets different because you still miss that person and have the terrible sadness that that they are no longer in your life. But it all becomes different over a period of time.\n\n‘But now I do feel my new house is happy. I wake up early every morning and I look around the house with all the things around me and I think “Yes, this is a happy house”.\n\n‘Being on your own without your husband is a lonely process and I understand that for many women, loneliness is the biggest enemy. I didn’t go under and I haven’t gone under.\n\n‘I’m lucky — I have lots of people who prevent me from feeling that. People brought me back to life.’\n\nNanette Newman’s The Importance Of Being Ernest The Earwig is published by Templar Publishing at £6.99.
