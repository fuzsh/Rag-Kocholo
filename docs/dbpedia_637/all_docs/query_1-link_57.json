        "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument today in a case that could radically change estate planning for affluent same-sex married couples.\n\nFederal tax law allows heterosexual spouses to transfer as much as they want to each other, either during life or at death, without having to pay any estate or gift tax, provided that the recipient spouse is a U.S. citizen.\n\nSame-sex couples can’t use this unlimited marital deduction, as it's called, because of the federal Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA. Section 3 of that law defines marriage as a “legal union between one man and one woman,” and spouse as “a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.” DOMA prohibits all types of federal benefits to spouses of same-sex marriages, even in states that have recognized gay marriage.\n\nAs a result, same-sex married couples have been forced to pay federal estate tax on their inheritance if it exceeded the tax-free amount. (For a rundown of other practical issues, see my FORBES magazine article, “Same-Sex Couples Face A Raft Of Planning Issues.”) Federal law currently allows each individual to transfer as much as $5.25 million (through lifetime gifts or at death) to nonspousal beneficiaries untaxed, but the tax-free amount is has gone up dramatically in recent years. In 2001 it was only $675,000!\n\nThe case before the Court involves Edith Windsor, whose partner of 44 years, Thea Spyer, died in 2009 when the federal exemption was $3.5 million and the top tax rate was 45%. Since, under DOMA, the couple was not considered married under federal law, Windsor had to pay $363,053 in federal estate tax. Windsor filed a lawsuit in the New York district court for a refund, claiming that Section 3 of DOMA violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. The District Court agreed, as did the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, ordering that the tax be refunded.\n\nNow the U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to affirm the lower courts’ rulings and find DOMA unconstitutional. As Seattle lawyer Wendy Goffe wrote here, the Court has a choice of whether to issue a broad or a narrow ruling on the subject. If it restricts its decision to the merits of the Windsor case, \"its ruling would only apply to the Second Circuit,\" Goffe writes. \"If it issues a broader opinion, that DOMA violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection as applied to people of the same sex, DOMA could be overturned and same-sex marriage would be available on a national basis.\" (For Goffe's article handicapping the justices, see \"Will The Supreme Court Legalize Same-Sex Marriage This Term?”)\n\nReports on today's oral arguments suggest that five justices of the Court are willing to strike down DOMA's definition of marriage. They include Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is expected to be a swing vote, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who said the law violated equal protection principles.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who in her career as a lawyer achieved landmark victories for women's rights, noted today that DOMA creates two kinds of marriage: “Full marriage and the skim-milk marriage.”\n\nThat's true with respect to approximately 1,000 federal benefits that are available to heterosexual spouses, but not to same-sex ones. The disparity plays out not just during life, but also when one of them dies. Same-sex married couples cannot receive Social Security survivor's benefits or take advantage of the unlimited marital deduction. Nor do they enjoy any of the special privileges for spouses who inherit individual retirement accounts, most notably the right to postpone distributions and take full advantage of tax-deferred compounding in the case of a traditional IRA, or tax-free earnings with a Roth. (See Five Rules For Inherited IRAs.)\n\nIf the Court strikes down DOMA's definition of marriage, federal benefits would become available to married same-sex couples. Nine states—Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Washington—and the District of Columbia, currently allow same-sex marriage. So a couple could get married in any of these jurisdictions and be eligible for federal benefits. For estate planning purposes, it would no longer be necessary for wealthy gay couples to go through various gyrations they had used in the past to save federal estate taxes—for instance, by setting up complicated trusts and buying expensive life insurance policies to cover the tax bill.\n\nInstead, they could rely on the unlimited marital deduction, as well as a federal tax break for widows and widowers that was made permanent by the American Taxpayer Relief Tax Act of 2012 after a two-year introductory period. Starting for deaths in 2011, and now going forward, they can carry over the estate tax exemption of the spouse who died most recently and add it to their own. Portability, as tax geeks call it, allows married couples to transfer $5.25 million apiece ($10.5 million together) tax-free. (See my post, \"The Deadline Every Married Person (And Financial Advisor) Needs To Know About.\")\n\nStill, state estate taxes are often a bigger concern, and marriage can be a big tax saver. At last count 21 states and the District of Columbia had either state estate or inheritance taxes, and only 2 of them had exemptions as high as $5.25 million. (Click here for a rollover map.)\n\nUntil they gained the right to marry, New York same-sex couples could leave each other only $1 million free of the 16% state levy; now, if they marry, they can leave each other an unlimited amount free of state tax. Since Windsor's partner died before same-sex marriage became legal in New York, she also had to pay $275,528 in state estate tax.\n\nAlso On Forbes\n\nIt’s Time To Stop Fighting About Same-Sex Marriage\n\nSame-Sex Couples Face A Raft Of Planning Issues\n\nHow I Became The Straight Lady For Gay Marriage\n\nArchive of Forbes Articles By Deborah Jacobs"
