But the limited research does show some increase in hair count after months of use.\n\nA 2021 study testing a CBD extract paste in 35 participants diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia (otherwise known as AGA, a common form of hair loss) showed an overall increase of 93.5% in hair count after six months—the average daily dose that showed results was 33 mg of hemp extract, which had 60% CBD. The best results were seen on the top of the scalp in male participants.\n\nA 2023 follow-up study tested a hemp oil containing high concentrations of not only CBD, but of additional cannabinoids (the compounds found in the cannabis plant) tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and cannabidivarin (CBDV). All participants experienced hair growth, with men experiencing an average 246% increase and women showing a 127% increase.\n\nResearchers in the follow-up study note that their cannabinoid oil made with the additional cannabinoids THCV and CBDV outperformed oral finasteride (a common hair loss treatment in men), 5% minoxidil (known by the brand name Rogaine) once daily foam and CBD-only topical extract, and that the hemp oil could be used alongside finasteride or minoxidil.\n\nHowever, though some research supports CBD use for hair growth, a 2022 meta-review published in The Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology notes other phytocannabinoids (such as THC, CBN, CBG, CBC, THCV and CBDV) could lead to hair loss. The review also found that very high and very low concentrations of CBD could cause hair loss and notes that the ideal concentration needs to be identified by researchers.\n\nThe formulation was made of a whole plant extract (CBD 60.00%, CBDV 12.63%, THCV 3.71%, delta 9 THC 0.18%, cannabigerol 0.86%, and cannabinol 0.05%). This hemp extract was independently analyzed by ACS Laboratory, Sun City Center, Florida. Each one ounce of the formulation contained active ingredients of 1 g of this hemp extract, 5 g of menthol, 600 g of peppermint oil-infused into a vehicle of 5 g of ethanol, 600 g of Emu oil and 14.9 g of Hexafluoroacetone (HFA) 134A (1,11,2-tetrafluoroethane) propellant, and 900 ml of dimethicone. The one-ounce foam spray or tincture lasted approximately 1 month on average. This is an average daily dose of 33 mg of topically applied hemp extract.\n\nThere are several pros and cons to consider when deciding if CBD for hair growth is the best course of treatment.\n\nPros:\n\nClinical studies, although limited, have shown CBD treatment to be effective\n\nCBD is generally safe to use\n\nOffers an organic alternative to hair growth treatments\n\nCons:\n\nLimited available research requires additional studies to fully support CBD’s hair growth mechanisms\n\nVery high and very low concentrations of CBD may lead to hair loss, according to research\n\nQuality of CBD products, particularly in terms of purity, can vary significantly.\n\nElevate Your Well-Being Naturally\n\nUnlock the potential of CBD with enhanced bioavailability.

This desensitization delays the hair follicle from shrinking and promotes hair growth during the growth phase of the hair cycle.\n\nFurthermore, notes Craig Henderson, founder and CEO of Extract Labs, a CBD company, “CBD has been shown to improve blood circulation, which can help deliver nutrients to hair follicles more efficiently.”\n\nSide Effects of Using CBD for Hair Growth\n\nAccording to some studies and experts, applying cannabis extracts topically may cause the following side effects:\n\nItchy skin\n\nBurning and stinging sensations\n\nErythema (skin condition causing rash)\n\nHair loss at high doses\n\nAllergic reaction to other ingredients in the CBD product, such as certain oils\n\nDr. Toy and Henderson suggest testing the CBD product on a small amount of skin first to look for signs of irritation.\n\nNature's Purest Remedy In Every Drop\n\nUnlock tranquil nights with Cornbread Hemp's premium Whole Flower CBD Oil, delicately crafted for bedtime bliss.\n\nShop Now\n\nOn Cornbread Hemp's Website\n\nHow to Use CBD for Hair Growth\n\nCBD products for hair growth, sold as shampoo, cream and oil, should be used topically, meaning applied directly to the skin and not by mouth. This allows the CBD to come into contact with your skin, hair and hair follicles.\n\nSays Henderson, “CBD oils and tinctures are great for direct application to the scalp, allowing for targeted benefits. Shampoos and conditioners infused with CBD can be incorporated into your regular hair care routine, offering consistent nourishment and scalp care.”\n\n“In my practice, patients do not like creams or oils for the scalp, as they tend to make the hair greasy,” notes Dr. Toy. “While patients certainly prefer medicated shampoos, their efficacy is limited because they are washed out so quickly. This short contact time reduces a shampoo’s ability to deliver any lasting benefit to the hair follicle.”\n\nBecause CBD products are not standardized for the treatment of hair loss, there will be a wide variability of products on the market, in both formulation and dose, Dr. Toy adds. “Alternative treatments [for hair loss], such as CBD, are experimental and should only be considered for those who have tried and failed traditional therapy,” he says.\n\nDr. Toy also recommends trying any new product on a small area first to test for any irritation, such as allergic contact dermatitis, an inflammatory response to certain allergens. “One ingredient to be cognizant of is propylene glycol. Propylene glycol is commonly used as a solvent in many topical medications; nonetheless, high concentrations of propylene glycol can also irritate the skin and result in contact dermatitis,” he says."
