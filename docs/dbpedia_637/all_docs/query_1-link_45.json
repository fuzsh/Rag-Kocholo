        "text": "Like love and marriage in the Frank Sinatra lyric, you couldn’t think of one without the other. Nanette Newman and Bryan Forbes had one of those indestructible partnerships that defy the odds in showbusiness. They never minded declaring their good fortune, even when it was very unfashionable to be so happily married.\n\nPart of their secret was never to be apart. Forbes had it written into his contracts that if he was filming abroad for more than two weeks, his wife and children should go with him. Their marriage lasted for 58 years, almost all of it spent in the big, sheltering house where Forbes died four months ago at the age of 86, nursed by Newman to the end.\n\n“Some people expect me to move,” she says. “But everything about this house is what we’ve created together. It’s like somebody just enclosing me in an embrace. It’s a mad, funny, sprawling, not terribly attractive house, but all the memories I have are lovely memories. Although I’m here on my own, I find it very comforting and not at all depressing. All the things we ever planned or talked about are around me.”\n\nThe Virginia creeper at the windows is turning red. When Forbes died in the arms of his wife and two daughters in May, with his favourite Puccini arias playing and all the windows open, the garden was in its spring glory. They filled his wicker coffin with things he’d grown or loved – wildflowers, forget-me-nots, azaleas, even rhubarb leaves. There were photographs, letters, mementos.\n\n“My wicked eldest daughter, Sarah [Standing, the journalist], put in a packet of cigarettes – a wonderful piece of black humour. She said her father would have loved it because he wasn’t allowed to smoke for so many years.”\n\nForbes had been suffering from emphysema, brought on by cigarette smoking, and a complex heart condition. For more than two years, he needed regular blood transfusions and eventually could not walk. It took Pythonesque manoeuvres with three different wheelchairs to negotiate the route from his bedroom to his study so he could continue working.\n\n“When Bryan started out as an actor, smoking was fashionable,” says Newman. “Everyone in the business smoked. Throughout his illness, he never really complained, but he would swear, saying if we could send people to the Moon, surely we could find a cure. He so wanted to live. Even when he was very ill, he forced himself to write his final novel, A Soldier’s Story. He had the most extraordinary guts.”\n\nNewman sits straight-backed and moves like a model. She has a sort of ageless glamour that grief has smudged, but not obliterated. The records say she is 79, but where is the physical evidence? Even the hands that wafted through a million adverts for Fairy Liquid – one of the most successful ad campaigns of the 20th century – are not those of an old person.\n\n“I’ve got to pull myself together,” she says, in an unsteady voice. “I’m not going to be one of those people who just talks about the sadness and awfulness of everything. Some days I zoom along. I think I’m doing OK – and then I talk about him and I’m crying.\n\n“I met Bryan when I was 17 and we’ve been together ever since. Suddenly there’s this enormous gap in my life and a new vocabulary to learn. It was always 'we’ and 'us’, as in 'Shall we watch Newsnight?’, 'Shall we have a cup of coffee?’ I will never do that with my husband again. I wake up in the morning and automatically reach for someone who’s not there. I am still finding my way.”\n\nThe couple met in the unglamorous location of Marylebone shunting yards on a cold February night in 1954. Forbes was starring in a forgettable B-movie called Wheel of Fate and Newman, still at Rada, had been sent along for a job. “Bryan was committing suicide under a train,” she recalls. “He came up on to the platform and introduced himself. I said: 'How nice to meet you, Mr Forbes. There’s a chance I might be in your film.’ He said: 'Well, I’m afraid this is the last day of shooting. They’ve brought you here under false pretences.’ He drove me home to make sure I was OK – and that was it.\n\n“So, at the age of 17, I did the cleverest thing I’ve ever done: said yes when Bryan asked me to marry him. I don’t think I’ve topped that.”\n\nAs the years rolled by and their marriage stood firm while others collapsed around them, they found themselves protesting that they were not some cloyingly sweet couple locked in uninterrupted bliss. “Of course there were tricky bits,” she says. “I never believe people who say every day has been sweetness and light. On one occasion, I announced, 'That’s it. I’m leaving’, and threw a few things into a suitcase. Then I couldn’t find my car keys. After about 20 minutes, we looked at one another and Bryan said: 'I don’t think this is such a good idea.’ When I unpacked the suitcase, there were just a few photographs and a pair of knickers. I don’t know what we were rowing about. Rows were always easily made up because were able to laugh at ourselves.\n\n“In our profession, there are many temptations along the way. Being parted for long periods of time is quite dangerous, so I would join Bryan on location. We would take the children to America for months when he was making a film.” The Stepford Wives, Whistle Down the Wind, The L-Shaped Room, The League of Gentlemen, King Rat and The Go-Between were among the memorable films he wrote and/or directed. In all, Forbes wrote 72 scripts, 12 novels and two autobiographies.\n\nAn almost comic challenge to the marriage arose when Newman, a raving beauty, found herself starring with Peter Sellers in The Wrong Arm of the Law in 1963. Sellers became infatuated and announced to Forbes that he wished to marry her, even going so far as to plan his access to the children. The siege lasted for two years, demanding considerable tact and sensitivity.\n\n“It was sort of flattering and we both adored him,” she says. “Peter always fell in love with whomever he was acting with. If I say he was mad, it was mad in the best possible way. He wanted very much what I had: a loving family and a home. He built it into a fantasy. Most comedians are quite unhappy people. They have a longing to be happy, to have a life they can’t attain. Peter was no exception. Bryan understood that. We all remained great friends afterwards.”\n\nShe insists that they never “worked at” their marriage or did anything consciously to preserve it. “It was pure luck that I happened to fall in love with someone I adored. I couldn’t ever envisage us apart.”\n\nForbes was a man of many talents but no pretensions. His wife remembers the day they went to a French art shop to stock up with canvases, paints and brushes. At the end of the list he asked the owner: “And have you any talent? That seems to be the one thing we lack.”\n\n“He was the most lovely man – funny, talented, a great person to live with. It’s lovely to have someone in your life who fights your corner. Whatever happens, whatever you do, you know that person will always be on your side and they think you’re terrific. This is what I’ll miss.”\n\nLogs crack and spit on the open fire. Newman seems to fall into a personal reverie. They never talked about death, she says. She refused to accept its inevitability until the last trip to hospital, when Forbes had pneumonia. “I think one knew then, when I got him home, that it wouldn’t be long.” Even so, all her energy went into keeping her husband’s spirits up. “Even a week before he died, I was saying: 'Listen, we’ll get over this blip and it’s going to be a lovely summer.’ ”\n\nTheir daughters, Emma [Forbes, the television presenter] and Sarah, have “put their arms around me and gathered me up. They and their husbands and the grandchildren have, without exception, been incredible. The closeness of family life is a marvellous thing.”\n\nThree weeks after Forbes’s death, Newman threw the house open to family, close friends and nurses at the King Edward VII Hospital who had cared for him. There was champagne and sunshine. All five grandchildren spoke, as did their great friend, Sir Kenneth Branagh. Sir David Frost, who died recently, was there in full flow. “Frostie seemed so fine,” she says. “He had 8,000 things on the boil. He was having a great chat with everybody, planning things, doing things…\n\n“When you get older and there are people falling off the perch all around you, you realise you have to make the most of the time you’ve got left. Bette Davis, a sharp and sassy character we knew quite well, said: 'Old age is not for sissies.’ You have to be quite courageous to be old because so many things are coming at you, bits of you are falling off and you’re suddenly realising your limitations.”\n\nLimitations? Newman disguises hers to vanishing point. She has written 32 books – six adult cookbooks, two children’s cookbooks and 24 children’s stories, plus an anthology of children’s sayings and drawings. She is planning a new children’s story and is taking computer lessons.\n\n“It’s given me a purpose. I can’t be one of those people who just collapses in floods of tears.” Touchingly, she is also trying to keep their nine-acre garden in Surrey in shape. “Bryan loved it so much. It was his obsession. I have been struggling with it in the last three months, thinking how pleased he’d be that I’m becoming a garden-doer at last, not just a garden-appreciator.”\n\nFor 20 years, Bryan Forbes was president of the National Youth Theatre. “He was excited by young talent, by enthusiastic people longing to be in this mad profession,” says his wife. On October 21, the creation of the Bryan Forbes Young Director’s Bursary will be celebrated with an event at the Ambassadors Theatre, encompassing popcorn, tributes, footage from his films and a dusting of irreverence.\n\n“It will be perfect for Bryan. He hated anything that was mournful or depressing. It will make his name live on in a wonderful way.”"
