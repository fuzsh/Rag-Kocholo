He was 94.\n\nBorn in Manhattan, New York, Dr. Cohen attended Horace Mann School and then Cornell University, where he was a member of Telluride House and the team that won the 1951 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a BS in physics in 1951, he enrolled in the graduate program in physics at the California Institute of Technology. At CalTech, Dr. Cohen researched the behavior of liquid helium under famous physicist Richard Feynman. Dr. Feynman was notoriously picky about graduate students, and Dr. Cohen was one of only 30 trainees Dr. Feynman took on throughout his career. In an interview with the American Institute of Physics, Dr. Feynman remembered how he’d given up on a particular set of calculations because he’d decided they were “too hard.” However, he recalled that Dr. Cohen “found they weren’t as hard as I thought” and cracked them.\n\nDr. Cohen earned his PhD in 1956 from CalTech, then stayed on to complete a postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Feynman. On the strength of his mentor’s recommendation, Dr. Cohen then did a second postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton with J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb. Then, heeding the counsel of “Oppie,” he came to Penn in 1958 as an assistant professor of physics. He became an associate professor two years later and a full professor in 1973.\n\nDr. Cohen spent the rest of his career at Penn. A condensed matter physicist, he studied the quantum mechanics of liquid helium, as well as ferroelectrics and phospholipid membranes. He enjoyed leading a problem-solving seminar for graduate students preparing for the PhD qualifying exam; for this work, he jokingly described himself as “the department’s Stanley Kaplan.” He also reveled in campus politics, serving as a longtime member of Penn’s faculty senate.\n\nIn 1962, with George Stranahan and Robert Craig, Dr. Cohen co-founded the Aspen Center for Physics in Aspen, Colorado. According to The New York Times, the center has “proved pivotal in the development of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, for a long time the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, and the formulation of string theory, regarded by many physicists as the most promising candidate for a ‘theory of everything’ that would explain all the universe’s physical phenomena.” When the center became an independent nonprofit in 1968, Dr. Cohen was elected its first treasurer. He followed this with a term as the center’s vice president, and then, for another 48 years, as an honorary trustee.\n\nIn retirement, Dr. Cohen wrote an introductory textbook in classical mechanics, which is available for free here.\n\nDr. Cohen is survived by his sister, Vera Gottlieb; his three children, Adam (C’90) (Mary), Jonathan, and Alison (Nurit Bloom); his seven grandchildren, Will, Theo, Leah, Aiden, Naomi, Vivi, and Daph; and his caregiver, Jeanette Edwards.\n\nDonations in Dr. Cohen’s memory may be made to the Aspen Center for Physics.

The collaboratory is an initiative involving Penn’s School of Nursing, the Perelman School of Medicine, and other departments across the University of Pennsylvania funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nThe Collaboratory Pilot Cores invite applications for pilot studies using technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize care management and health outcomes for older Americans, including those with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) living in their homes independently, and those receiving clinical care or skilled home and community-based services.\n\nThe PennAITech pilot program solicits annually pilot studies that develop or test technology and AI to detect risk, predict needs, address disparities, improve access to care, and support decision making for chronic illness management and safe aging in place for older adults with or without ADRD and their caregivers. The pilots selected for funding receive guidance and mentoring from the PennAITech expert team.\n\nIn year three, through a competitive national grant review process, eleven applicants from academia, industry and health systems across the United States were selected for funding. The list of awardees selected for PennAITech funding include:\n\nTotal Year Three Awards: $2,583,609\n\nPilot 1: Improved Algorithms for Wearable, Passive, Noninvasive BP Monitoring for Seniors (Investigators: Xina Quan and Keith C.

The location is open weekdays, 8:30 a.m. until 5 p.m.\n\nThe move from 3401 Walnut, the department’s home of nearly 30 years, coincides with the launch of an expanded menu of flexible permits and programs for new parkers, which are being offered based on community feedback.\n\nParking & Commuter Services joins the PennCard Center and Onboard@Penn at the bookstore, solidifying the site as an accessible one-stop hub for a variety of Penn services.\n\nKeep up with Penn Parking & Commuter Services at the department’s streamlined website.\n\nThe Atlantic Now Available Through Penn Libraries\n\nOnline full-text access to The Atlantic has been a perennial request of Penn Libraries. The magazine has a long, distinguished history as a cultural reporter and opinion-maker since its start in 1857 as a showpiece for Boston literati. Faculty in the political science department and other Penn academic programs frequently include Atlantic articles in their course reserve lists, and diligent students often report frustration over the website’s metered paywall access. Additionally, title changes over the years have made The Atlantic one of the more difficult items to find in the Penn Libraries catalog.\n\nThe Penn Libraries’ Atlantic website subscription provides web-only content and print-magazine content. Faculty can now easily share URLs to specific articles with students, and all students, faculty, and staff can enjoy everything The Atlantic has to offer, from cultural commentary to the Caleb’s Inferno crossword. Currently, the subscription does not include The Atlantic’s mobile app.\n\nAdditionally, PDF versions of whole monthly issues (advertisements included) are available for download from the latest issue back to the first issue published in November 1857. While some of this content is currently available through Nexis Uni and Factiva, the new Atlantic website subscription provides images and publisher’s formatting. That said, readers interested in discovering and viewing specific articles in older issues of The Atlantic may still find it easier to use Penn Libraries’ searchable full text subscription to The Atlantic Magazine Archive, covering 1857 through 2014.\n\nHow To Access\n\nAccessing The Atlantic online is easy.\n\nVisit the Sign In page from anywhere on theatlantic.com.\n\nClick on “Sign in through your institution.” Do not create a personal account or sign in using the Facebook or Google options.\n\nWhen prompted, type University of Pennsylvania where it asks you to enter your institution name and click “Continue.”\n\nEnter your PennKey when prompted.\n\nEnjoy The Atlantic.\n\nGiving and Volunteer Opportunities from the Netter Center for Community Partnership\n\nDear Penn Community,\n\nThank you for your spirit of volunteerism.
