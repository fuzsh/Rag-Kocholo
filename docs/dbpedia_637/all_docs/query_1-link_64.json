        "text": "TRIBUTES have been paid to acclaimed film director Bryan Forbes, who died at his home in Virginia Water this week at the age of 86.\n\nThe British film industry icon, who famously directed the dark 1975 science fiction thriller The Stepford Wives, had been battling a long illness, his family said.\n\nForbes, who was married to Stepford actress Nanette Newman, was father to television presenter Emma Forbes and journalist Sarah Standing, all of whom had gathered to be with him at the time of his death.\n\nFamily friend Matthew D'Ancona said: \"Bryan Forbes was a titan of cinema, known and loved by people around the world in the film and theatre industries and known in other fields including politics.\n\n\"He is simply irreplaceable and it is wholly apt that he died surrounded by his family.\"\n\nForbes received a CBE in 2004 for services to the arts and the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain.\n\nIn 2006 he was awarded the Dilys Powell Award for outstanding contribution to cinema at the London Film Critics' Circle Awards.\n\nAfter starting off his career as an actor, Forbes made his directorial debut with Whistle Down The Wind in 1961, which led to him becoming one of the leading figures of British post-war cinema.\n\nHe also directed and wrote 1978 film International Velvet starring Tatum O’Neal.\n\nForbes, who counted the late Queen Mother among his friends, was a talented writer and scripted the 1992 movie Chaplin which starred Robert Downey Jr in the title role.\n\nHe also found success as an author, writing a number of novels, the most recent of which, The Soldier's Story, was published last year.\n\nPaying tribute on Twitter, legendary screen siren Joan Collins said: \"Very sad to hear that Bryan Forbes died. He was an iconic figure of the British film industry. My heart goes out to Nanette, Sarah and Emma.\""
