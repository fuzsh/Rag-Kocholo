        "text": "There was a time when I could repeat verbatim dozens of lines from “The Wrong Box,” Bryan Forbes’ delightfully daft dark comedy about the madcap scramble for an immense inheritance by Victorians both proper and otherwise.\n\nIt helped, of course, that the movie – filled with such deft farceurs as Michael Caine, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Ralph Richardson, John Mills and Peter Sellers – also was an all-time favorite of my mentor, the late Ralph Thomas Bell, former chairman of the journalism department at Loyola University in New Orleans.\n\nDuring my college years, and for several years afterwards, we often would greet each other with snippets of the 1966 comedy’s droll dialogue, more or less in the fashion of latter-day Monty Python fanatics exchanging quips about dead parrots and killer rabbits. Indeed, whenever we got together as our friendship endured long after my graduation, there was a scarcely a time when one of us didn’t make the other laugh out loud simply by saying, in meticulously deadpan style: “We haven’t heard the last of this.” (The line makes absolutely no sense out of context — which doubtless increased its value to us as a wonderful sort of private joke.)\n\nOccasionally, we would get on an extended riff while recalling this scene between Peter Cook as a young man in desperate need of a death certificate — for reasons entirely too complicated too recapitulate here — and Peter Sellers as a disreputable doctor who’s a tad too found of feline companionship. (Note the exchange at approximately the 2:40 mark, when Cook actually asks for the aforementioned certificate.)\n\nOddly enough, it wasn’t until several years after I first saw “The Wrong Box” that I realized there was yet another reason why I was right to be impressed by the film: Just one year before the comedy reached theaters, director Forbes impressed audiences with the harshly gritty World War II drama “King Rat,” which featured George Segal in one of his career-best performances as a cynical U.S. Army corporal determined to survive by any means necessary in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Talk about demonstrating your versatility as a filmmaker.\n\nLittle wonder that, back in the day, I couldn’t conceive of there being any connection between two such disparate movies.\n\nForbes — who passed away Wednesday at age 86 after a lengthy illness — boasted a resume that also included such widely admired films as “Whistle Down the Wind,” “Seance on a Wet Afternoon” and “The Whisperers,” and one truly bizarre concoction, the kinky crime drama “Deadfall” (starring Michael Caine as a cat burglar who falls for his older partner’s very alluring wife), which isn’t often discussed in polite company."
