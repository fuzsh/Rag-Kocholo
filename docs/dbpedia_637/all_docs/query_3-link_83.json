He works with drug trader and blackmail them to bribe in exchange for not busting them. Lance got connections with Forbes who posed as a shady drug dealer at the time.\n\nForbes masterminded a plan for Victor and Lance to get a large shipment of drug by stealing them from smugglers. He also came up with a clever plan for Victor to take a decoy van to lure the cops away. Eventually, Lance found out that Forbes is an undercover cop and has him at gunpoint.\n\nWhen Forbes' pleas failed, he punched Lance and ran away. The Vance brothers caught him and took him to an abandoned apartment to get information from him. Forbes gave them phony information about drug shipments eventually leading them to a bar filled with gay, white-supremacist bikers.\n\nVictor and Lance killed all of the bikers and went back to the apartment where they found out that Forbes escaped. They chased him ending with Victor killing Forbes.\n\nLance was unsatisfied on killing Forbes because he has not told them where the big drug shipment would take place. Lance figured out that shipment is being delivered to Jerry Martinez.\n\nNavigation[]"
