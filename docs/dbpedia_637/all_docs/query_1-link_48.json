Margaret Bryan ...\n\nOn FamilySearch.org 4 sources of information for:\n\nLife Sketch • Not real sure where the information for Margaret Bryan is all coming from, however, the dates currently entered do not add up properly. She is identified as born in 1690 in Pennsylvania, sources say they married in 1719 in Chester Pennsylvania (the accuracy of that information is questionable). There is a child born in 1710, before their supposed marriage in 1719, then no more children until 1731, at which time Margaret would be 41 years old. From 1731 until 1747 she had at least 7 children, a pretty unbelievable event considering that she was age 41 to 57 when all those children were born.\n\nIf the children are actually hers it would suggest she was born much later than 1690. Perhaps her husband had at least one wife before her and that wife was the mother of the child born in 1710.\n\nVitals:\n\nName • • Margaret Bryan Reason This Information Is Correct: GEDCOM data Last Changed: February 19, 2015\n\nSex • • Female Last Changed: June 20, 2012\n\nBirth • • 1690 Pennsylvania, British Colonial America Last Changed: March 14, 2022\n\nChristening\n\nDeath • • 28 November 1763 Orange, North Carolina, British Colonial America Reason This Information Is Correct: Ancestry.com Last Changed: June 24, 2022\n\nBurial\n\nOther Information:\n\nAlternate Name • Birth Name Margaret Last Changed: September 13, 2013\n\nSources\n\n\"North Carolina Marriages, 1759-1979,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F8CL-8X3 : accessed 12 January 2016), William Forbis and Margaret Bryan, 13 Feb 1779; citing Rowan, North Carolina, reference ; FHL microfilm 317,002.\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/94CJ-Y3F"
