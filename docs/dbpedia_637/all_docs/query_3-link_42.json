        "text": "Brian C. Forbes passed away on Monday, the 12th of June 2023, age 78. Devoted husband of 55 years to his wife Rhonda L. Forbes, nee Crain; grateful and loving father of Laura (Joe) Dorhauer and David (Karen) Forbes; dear brother to Wayne (the late Sherry) Forbes; brother-in-law, grandfather, great-grandfather, uncle, cousin, other family and friend to many, especially his buddy Milo. Brian is preceded in death by his parents, the late Howard Forbes and the late Harriet Forbes, nee Kunz.\n\nBrian was a U.S. Navy veteran serving 2 tours of Vietnam aboard the U.S.S. Ticonderoga (CVA 14). Brian retired from the St. Louis County Police Department as a Detective in May 1997 after 30 years of service, including 10 years on the Major Case Squad. In his free time, Brian was an avid bowler and enjoyed golfing, especially with family and friends, but his favorite pastime was watching his grandchildren at sporting events and other activities.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials are appreciated to Backstoppers.\n\nVisitation will be held Monday June 19, 2023, from 4:00 to 8:00 p.m. at John L. Ziegenhein & Sons South County Chapel 4830 Lemay Ferry Rd. St. Louis, MO 63129.
