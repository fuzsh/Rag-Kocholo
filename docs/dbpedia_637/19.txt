Film director Bryan Forbes, whose movies included The Stepford Wives, has died aged 86, his family said last night.

As tributes began flooding in, he was described as “irreplaceable” and a “titan of cinema”.

Bryan, who died after a long illness, made his directing debut in 1961 with Whistle Down The Wind.

Family friend Matthew D’Ancona said Bryan – who was married to actress Nanette Newman, 78 – died at his home in Virginia Water, Surrey, with his loved ones by his side.

Matthew added: “Bryan Forbes was a titan of cinema, known and loved by people around the world in the film and theatre industries and known in other fields including politics.

“He is simply irreplaceable and it is wholly apt that he died surrounded by his family.”

Bryan was born in Stratford, East London, in 1926 and grew up in nearby Forest Gate.

After his military service was completed in 1948, he began his career as an actor.

He also became a prolific writer and his more recent work included scripting 1992 movie Chaplin with Robert Downey Jr in the title role.

But Bryan was best known for 1975 horror classic Stepford Wives featuring wife Nanette.

He also directed and wrote 1978 film International Velvet starring Tatum O’Neal.

Bryan, who was awarded a CBE in 2004 for services to the arts, had two daughters, TV presenter Emma Forbes and journalist Sarah Standing.
