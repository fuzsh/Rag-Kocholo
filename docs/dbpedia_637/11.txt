Stepford Wives director Bryan Forbes has died at his Surrey home at the age of 86 after a long illness.

The filmmaker, whose work includes the original 1970s horror classic and Whistle Down The Wind, died surrounded by his family at his home in Virginia Water in Surrey.

Forbes was married to actress Nanette Newman and had two daughters - TV presenter Emma Forbes and journalist Sarah Standing.

Family friend Matthew D'Ancona said: "Bryan Forbes was a titan of cinema, known and loved by people around the world in the film and theatre industries, and known in other fields including politics.

"He is simply irreplaceable and it is wholly apt that he died surrounded by his family."

Forbes was made a CBE in 2004 for services to the arts and the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain.

He was also awarded the Dilys Powell Award for outstanding contribution to cinema at the London Film Critics' Circle Awards in 2006.

He began his career as an actor, before making his debut as a director with Whistle Down The Wind in 1961.

Forbes, who counted the late Queen Mother among his friends, also found success as an author writing a number of novels, the latest of which - The Soldier's Story - was published last year.
