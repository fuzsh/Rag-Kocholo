        "text": "4.1.1. Applications\n\nCareri et al. [28] used 153Eu labelled antibodies for the development of an immunoassay targeting peanut allergens extracted from food samples. In this work an ELISA sandwich assay was performed where the elemental labelled antigen-antibody complex was digested with 7 M HNO3 and quantified via FI-ICP-MS. To check unspecific binding of the labelled antibodies, which is a limiting factor for the linear dynamic range of the assays at low allergen concentrations, protein-rich materials were analysed. Experimental conditions were optimized to obtain lowest unspecific antibody binding reactions and 153Eu background leading to LODs of 1.5 ng mL−1 for raw peanut protein extracts. This value is affected by the binding affinity of the antibody to the peanut allergen and by the non-specific background (e.g. produced by reagent impurities or unspecific binding). The LOD of the Eu labelled antibody itself was as low as 0.1 ng mL−1, emphasizing the potential of this approach for selective and sensitive quantitative analysis with improved linearity and reduced matrix effects. However, improvement of the labelling procedure to maintain low background levels and high antibody functionality is crucial for the sensitivity of this concept, which is an issue in ultra trace biomarker analysis.\n\nAnother FI-ICP-MS approach published by Takasaki et al. [115] employed quantum dots (QD) with a Cd, Te and Se bearing core for elemental labelling of adipose tissue-derived stem cells. Due to the small sample size (approximately 1 mg) an optimized microwave assisted acid digestion procedure was developed. For introduction of the small sample volume (20 μL) into the plasma a micro flow injection system equipped with a total consumption micro-nebulizer was constructed. The designed method was applied for the multi-element assessment (16 elements including Cd and Te) allowing quantitative analysis of the distribution of adipose tissue stem cells in mice organs [115]. In this pioneering approach, Takasaki et al. combined QD labelling (originally presented as fluorophore labelling concept) with FI-ICP-MS instead of FLD for quantification of QD derived metallic compounds (Cd, Te, Se) and other elements. The described strategy could compensate for the lack of available standards for measurement of the tissue samples via LA-ICP-MS. However, complementary use of LC–ICP-MS for speciation analysis, in combination with microwave assisted digestion and FI-ICP-MS could significantly improve the information content of results.\n\nKretschy et al. [57] employed an In or fluorescein labelled peptide drug in cell uptake studies. Sensitivity and precision of FI-ICP-SFMS combined with In labelling of the peptide Bβ15–42 were compared with FI-FLD measurements of the fluorescein labelled peptide Bβ15–42. The achieved absolute LOD for aqueous standards was 3 fmol for the FI-FLD method and 0.05 fmol for the FI-ICP-SFMS set-up. In this approach cellular samples were simply diluted 1:10 with 2% HNO3 prior to injection into the system. Total concentrations of the peptide Bβ15–42 could only be determined with the FI-ICP-SFMS set-up due to unspecific fluorescence emission when using FI-FLD. FI-ICP-SFMS results were comparable with those of a reference method, where samples were microwave digested and measured using IDMS and FI-ICP-SFMS. Different calibration strategies such as external calibration with and without internal standardization with Rh and species unspecific on-line IDMS with 113In were investigated for the FI-ICP-SFMS approach underpinning the potential of IDMS for enhancement of precision. Concerning short-term repeatability external calibration with internal standardization using Rh was superior with an RSD of 0.9% which demonstrates the potential of FI-ICP-SFMS compared with FI-FLD, where an RSD of 6.5% was observed. In all cases the biological variability of approximately 15% was representing a major influence factor on the total combined uncertainty, which should be considered when working with biological samples.\n\nTo sum up, the advantages of flow injection based ICP-MS lie in the fact that small sample volumes can be analyse in a very short time (>90 samples per hour) without tedious sample digestion. Additionally, FI-ICP-MS offers great multiplexing capabilities and enables different quantification strategies, which are a key issue for implementation of this concept in routine diagnostics. Bottlenecks concern sample characteristics such as purity, labelling degree and background levels of labels, as well as antibody selectivity and functionality.\n\nOther attempts are utilizing gold nanoparticles for labelling of antibodies or proteins facilitating signal amplification and hence sensitive detection of various biomolecules in serum samples via FI-ICP-MS. Li et al. [116] used antibody affinity binding in combination with gold nanoparticle labelling and ICP-MS detection for the quantification of Escherichia coli O157:H7 pathogens enabling the detection of 500 E. coli O157:H7 cells in 1 mL of sample (500 colony forming units per mL sample). The assay showed high specificity in tests with non-pathogenic E. coli [116]. In the work of Liu and Yan [117] aptamer modified gold nano particles and antibody modified silver nano particles were employed for simultaneous determination of insulin and cytochrome c in human serum. The results indicate the potential of such concepts for massively multiplexed assays [117]. In the pioneering work of Jarujamrus et al. [118] the antigen chloramphenicol (CAP) was labelled with gold nano particles and detected via anti-CAP immobilized on solid supports. The immunoassay takes place in 96 well plates and shows good sensitivity, linearity and precision in competitive measurements of mixed samples containing CAP and CAP-BSA conjugates. This paper describes the feasibility of the applied strategy for trace analysis in biological samples [118].\n\n4.2.1. Applications\n\nMost of the LC–ICP-MS based studies focus on the labelling of peptides, proteins or antibodies. Researchers have early recognized that separation of the labelled analytes or conjugates from free, remaining labelling reagents and other impurities is a prerequisite for accurate quantification. Moreover, multi-compound methods, where the same functional group of different analytes is derivatized demand for chromatographic methods providing baseline separation for each analyte. In this context, Rappel and Schaumlöffel [65] utilized Lu-DTPAA (Lu-diethylenetriamine-N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentaacetic dianhydride) for derivatization and absolute quantification of labelled peptides via nano RP-ICP-MS detection combined with species unspecific IDMS. In a two-step procedure the amino groups of peptides were labelled with DTPAA followed by loading of the chelator with Lu. Determination of the peptides was carried out using a acclaim pep map 100 C18 nano-column (75 μm × 15 cm, 3 μm) operated at 300 nL min−1 combined with ICP-MS detection and post column addition of 176Lu yielding a recovery of nearly 100% and 4.9% precision. The achieved LOD was 179 fmol with an injection volume of approximately 10 nL. For implementation of this concept into routine analysis or diagnostics the applicability has to be verified in real life samples with different matrices, because this can significantly affect the recovery of the labelling procedure (e.g. unspecific interactions during labelling or separation of labelled and unlabelled compounds).\n\nAnother approach follows the basic idea of derivatization of a protein or peptide with a MeCAT reagent (lanthanides coordinated to DOTA-Bn macrocycle) via maleimide chemistry. After separation of the analytes via SDS-PAGE the protein bands were extracted and analysed utilizing FI-ICP-MS or LC–MS. The proof of concept study was published by Ahrends et al. [8] where peptides, BSA and α-lactalbumin were measured undigested with FI-ICP-MS or after proteolysis with LC–MS/MS. For both strategies a previous reduction of the sample using TCEP was required for generation of thiol groups from disulfide bonds. This reduction can affect the recovery and outcome of labelling due to fragmentation or generation of intermediate products. Hence, absolute quantification via FI-ICP-MS should be considered as challenging because total element concentrations are measured and the accuracy depends on background, clean up steps, labelling conditions and labelling degree. However, subsequent work investigated analytical robustness and suitability of this concept for biological applications [119]. Additionally, Pieper et al. [120] from the same group examined the fragmentation behaviour of MeCAT labelled BSA utilizing nano or capillary LC–MS for detection. Moreover, a iodoacetamide reactive group combined with the MeCAT lanthanide label was employed for quantification of digested BSA and β-lactalbumin via SDS-PAGE or nano-RP-ESI-MS/MS (applying a Zorbax 300 SB C18 column) revealing higher labelling efficiency compared to the maleimide functionalized MeCAT approach. Furthermore, this concept yields more homogenous products owing to the lack of diastereomere creation when employing iodoacetamide linking to thiol groups. A drawback of this method are the relatively harsh reaction conditions under which labelling is carried out limiting the applicability of this technique, e.g. for antibodies [103].\n\nHann et al. [13] performed immuno affinity assisted SEC-ICP-MS measurements of a In-DOTA labelled peptide Bβ15–42-antibody complex in cellular samples using the BioSuite125 UHR SEC column (4.6 mm × 300 mm, 4 μm particle size) operated at a 350 μL min−1 flow of 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7). The developed method was further applied for determination of metallodrug-protein adducts in solution via retention time shift resulting from the formation of an antibody antigen complex (Ru labelled transferrin adducts of an anti-cancer drug bound by an anti-transferrin antibody). Improved detection limits of 1 pmol for transferrin adducts could be achieved by employment of a fully automated two-dimensional SEC-IC separation prior to ICP-MS detection. This approach underlines the potential of LC–ICP-MS for the separation of different antibody antigen complexes, which is crucial for the implementation of this concept for bioassays. Another work from this group in the year 2008 addresses the quantification of the free In DOTA labelled peptide Bβ15–42 in cellular samples via RP-ICP-MS using a Nucleosil C8 column. Accordingly, the unlabelled peptide was quantified via RP-ESI-TOF-MS employing the same instrumental conditions. Concerning the determination of the analyte in aqueous standards both methods revealed comparable sensitivity and limits of detection of about 3 fmol on column. In contrast to that, quantification of the peptide Bβ15–42 in cell lysates was only possible with the concept of elemental labelling combined with RP-ICP-MS detection due to severe matrix suppression in RP-ESI-TOF-MS [80].\n\nIn the study of Iwahata et al. [121] quantitative analysis of single fruit fly samples for determination of branched amino acids was accomplished using RP-ICP-CCMS and RP-ICP-SFMS both combined with pre-column derivatization of the amino acids with a metal tag reagent (Rub2m-O-Su). The employed set-up enabled amino acid detection by LC–ICP-MS and RP separation provided by increased hydrophobicity owing to derivatization. After extraction of the fruit fly sample and analyte derivatization, the investigated amino acids could be separated using an Inertsil ODS-3 RP column (1.0 mm × 150 mm, 3 μm) operated at 50 μL min−1 (injection volume 1 or 5 μL) in gradient mode 10 mM a sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8)/ACN/H2O. 101Ru and 102Ru were calibrated in transient mode with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.999 using amino heptanoic acid as internal standard.\n\nEsteban-Fernandez et al. [33] addressed absolute quantification of lysozyme and BSA on the peptide level using RP-ICP-MS (Polaris 3 C18-Ether, 150 mm × 1 mm, 5 μm; Varian), while complementary RP-ESI-MS of the digested and labelled proteins served as identification technique. For RP-ESI-MS 6 different synthetic standard peptides labelled with Eu-MeCAT-maleimide were employed as standards and were selected because of their different behaviours in reversed phase separations and good identification capabilities. For quantification of the Eu-MeCAT-maleimide labelled peptides resulting from BSA and lysozyme digestion via RP-ICP-MS species unspecific isotope dilution analysis (IDA) with post-column addition of a Eu2O3 spike was performed. Summarizing, this study was the first successful application of the MeCAT technique for cysteine labelling applied for absolute protein quantification and can serve as an example for the fruitful combination of organic and inorganic MS together with elemental labelling. Recently, a proof of concept study for dual labelling of thiol and amine groups of peptides via MeCAT-iodoacetamide and DOTA-NHS-ester combined with lanthanides was published by this group [66]. The method was optimized for cysteine containing standard peptides and applied for BSA and HSA, offering capabilities for tracking peptide/protein reactions or estimation of thiol and primary amine groups. In principle, the peptides were first immobilized on Sepharose 6B resins and labelled with the DOTA-NHS ester followed by coordination of lanthanides to the complex. Afterwards, the complexes were eluted and cysteine residues were labelled with a lanthanide loaded MeCAT-iodoacetamide. Detection was maintained parallel by the use of RP-ESI-MS (applying a Zorbax 300 SB C18 column) for determination of labelling completeness and yield, and RP-ICP-MS utilizing the same column for gathering of relative quantitative information ( ). A drawback of this application was the lack of accuracy of the quantitative determinations, which was suggested to be due to systematic errors.\n\nZheng et al. [18] performed relative quantification of protein mixtures containing RNase, cytochrome c and lysozyme utilizing lanthanide labelling of the amine groups with Ce and Sm coordinated to DTPAA (diethylenetriamine-N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentaacetic dianhydride). For this study a cation exchange column (TSK GEL SP-5PW 7.5 mm × 75 mm, 70 μm) operated at 0.8 mL min−1 was coupled to an ICP-MS instrument (see ). Gradient elution with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer as eluent A (pH 6.5), and 500 mM ammonia chloride and 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer as eluent B (pH 6.5) was applied using an injection volume of 100 μL. 140Ce and 152Sm were used as analytes and signal intensities were compared. Multi element capabilities were emphasized since labelling with different lanthanides is possible providing the conditions for high throughput and top-down proteomics. Labelling was optimized with highest yields at a 10-fold molar excess of DTPAA compared to the proteins and a 2-fold molar excess of Ce and Sm compared to DTPAA-protein. In a first step the proteins were labelled with the chelator DTPAA (2 h, 37 °C) and in a second step the lanthanides were coordinated which was rapid and complete after 2 h at 37 °C. The presented approach revealed LODs between 0.2 and 7 pmol for the investigated proteins with good precision (RSD of 5%). No considerations about unspecific interactions due to the sequence of the labelling procedure were reported. In the work of Waentig et al. higher lanthanide background levels were observed when the lanthanide was attached after the chelator was linked to the biomolecule [104].\n\nYan et al. [122] performed a proof of concept study for absolute quantification of three digested or intact Eu-MMA-DOTA (Eu-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecan-1,4,7-triacetic acid-10-maleimidoethylacetamide) labelled proteins (lysozyme, insulin and ribonuclease A) utilizing RP-ICP-MS detection combined with species unspecific IDMS. The labelling procedure was optimized with lysozyme as a model substance starting with reduction of the disulfide bonds with TCEP followed by conjugation of MMA-DOTA to the SH groups of lysozyme. Optimized conditions for this step were a 10-fold molar excess of MMA-DOTA compared to SH groups at pH 6.8–7.6 for 40 min at 47 °C. Afterwards the MMA-DOTA biomolecule complex was loaded with Eu3+ by chelation using a 5-fold molar excess of Eu with respect to DOTA at pH 5.8 which should avoid possible hydrophilic precipitation of Eu (no further details concerning pH and temperature during chelation). In this work the labelling procedure started with the attachment of the macrocycle to the biomolecule followed by the coordination of Eu to the conjugate. Other studies with this sequence of labelling [21,104], reported high background levels of free lanthanides (mainly due to their adhesive nature), which was not discussed in this work. Moreover, the use EDTA for integration of free Eu could also have an impact on labelling efficiency due to possible attachment of the COOH groups of EDTA to free NH2 groups (e.g. at lysine residues) of the labelled biomolecule conjugate. However, the lysozyme-MMA-DOTA-Eu complex was confirmed with ESI-MS at mass 19,712.0, whereas no signal could be observed for the lysozyme-MMA-DOTA conjugate. Accordingly, no loss of Eu during HPLC separation with 0.05% TFA in water and ACN was observed. which was assumed regarding to the literature log K values of 23.5 indicating high stability of the Eu-DOTA complex. The labelled peptides were quantified after tryptic digestion or as intact proteins using a Zorbax 300 SB C18 column (1.0 mm × 150 mm, 3.5 μm) operated at 0.05 mL min−1 coupled to an ICP-MS detector combined with species unspecific IDMS using 153Eu as a spike. LC separation was carried out utilizing gradient elution with 0.05% TFA in water/ACN and LODs between 0.819 and 1.638 fmol were achieved for the intact proteins. Moreover, complementary ESI-MS measurements were carried out, providing another dimension of separation. The results showed that not all of the expected labelled tryptic peptides from lysozyme and ribonuclease A could be detected, suspecting an incomplete digestion of the proteins. This hypothesis was further supported by the detection of a missed cleavage peptide from ribonuclease A. This implicates that intact proteins may be more feasible targets. 151Eu/153Eu ratios were monitored and IDMS resulted at 5.8% precision at the 10 pmol level and recovery of intact protein quantification was 97.9% in six different experiments. The covalent attachment of MMA-DOTA to the SH groups of the investigated proteins is selective and efficient under mild conditions. Harshness of labelling conditions should also be considered for preservation of the biomolecules functional activity, e.g. when labelling an antibody [6].\n\nDetermination of complex stability constants under selected chromatographic conditions is crucial for bioassays employing elemental labelling. Kretschy et al. [91] assessed complex stability of different chelating moieties such as DOTA, NOTA and DTPA combined with lanthanides in competitive experiments under acidic chromatographic conditions (pH 2.5). Lanthanide labelling was performed at pH 6.5 and at 5 °C for 15 min. Incubation of the lanthanide complex directly on the autosampler was carried out at 5 °C and 37 °C simulating storage as well as physiological conditions. Kinetic experiments were performed after coordination of the lanthanide to the macrocycle, by means of measurement of the samples at different time points. The simultaneous measurement of 11 different lanthanide complexes with LC–ICP-MS utilizing a mixed mode stationary phase (Asahipak GS 220 HQ, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, 6 μm) revealed that log K values were significantly lower (with max. log K of 5) during chromatographic separation at pH 2.5, compared to other studies performed at neutral conditions with log K values of about 20 [140,90,123]. The applied pH of 2.5 for chromatography is typical for RP separations or bioassays. Hence, changes of complex stability constants should be taken into account when performing quantitative analysis with lanthanide labelled biomolecules."
