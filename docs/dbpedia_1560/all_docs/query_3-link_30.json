        "text": "Pracktica cameras are numerous in the U.K. I have had several, actually many.\n\nThey are basic, but worked well.\n\nI suppose the 6x6cm Pentacon Six was also made in Dresden?\n\nAgain I have a fair number.\n\nA low priced version of the 6x7cm Pentax SLR.\n\nInterchangeable screens etc.\n\nIf the cameras are not wound on properly they can jam. They may jam if film is not in the camera when operated.\n\nThe machining is rather crude, but the Zeiss lenses were good.\n\n50mm f/4 Flektogon high reputation image wise, 65mm rare, 80mm Biometer, 120mm Biometer less common, 180mm Sonnar, 300mm f/4 Sonnar.\n\nAlso the 500mm f/5.6, although mine seems to be f/4.8. It has pinched optics, but could be good if the lenses were freed up a bit.\n\nI have taken the 80mm Biometer apart and the machining is rather poor. Some have Zeiss covered up on the front bezel with Aus Jena.\n\nThere were also Meyer lenses.\n\nThere were Pentacon 35mm SLRs of various types and I think rangefinder cameras also.\n\nThe attraction of these cameras was price.\n\nThese cameras are very numerous.\n\nThere are Russian copies of the Pentacon Six/Praktisix. There is a Russian medium format 30mm f/3.5 lens, Zodiak/Arsat.\n\nWith cameras the lenses form inverted images usually, so prisms are not necessary.\n\nIt is only the viewfinders that needed prisms or mirrors.\n\nThe Periflex had a small drop in erector.\n\nThe Wrayflex had a reversed image except the Wrayflex 3, which had a pentaprism. Mine didn't work. Rare.\n\nWith rifle scopes the relay lenses seem to have dust visible on the lens surfaces.\n\nRussian spotting scopes often have relay lenses and often small fields.\n\nBroadhurst Clarkson spotting scopes use relay lenses. The rear eyepiece and relay lens component makes a fantastic microscope, about 20x flat field.\n\nSame with the terrestrial eyepieces for their astro refractors.\n\nMy Yukon 30x50 binocular is optically excellent. It uses mirrors not prisms, but is let down by poor lens coatings and ordinary mirrors. It could be very good if properly fully multicoated.\n\nMirrors would need to be high quality and there may be problems with light scatter.\n\nI suppose some straight spotters use Porroprisms.\n\nI used my 150mm Maksutov with a Porroprism adapter for terrestrial use.\n\nAlthough my astro scopes were usually inverted image, I used prisms for terrestrial use.\n\nDespite non phase coated adapters being condemned here, I find the views perfectly acceptable.\n\nSimilarly for astro use I find non phase coated binoculars perfectly acceptable also.\n\nLater Practika or Practica binoculars seem indeed to be Chinese There are umpteen models. Badge engineering. The Praktica camera lenses are Japanese or maybe Chinese.\n\nThe best camera actually made in East Gemany was the 35mm full frame Pentacon Super possibly 1968 to 1972?\n\nI see asking prices now of £2,500, but I don't know how much they actually change hands for.\n\nAfter the Pentacon Super the Japanese camera technology was something Pentacon could not compete with.\n\nZeiss West made very good, but expensive cameras and of course Hassleblad in Sweden using Zeiss lenses.\n\nI had a Zeiss Flektogon 20mm lens adapted to Minolta and it was indeed a good lens for its time.\n\nHowever, Minolta's own 20mm might have been better, although I never had one.\n\nI had the 16mm Minolta full frame fisheye, which I think was made also under the Leica name with final quality control by Leica.\n\nB.\n\nHi Chosun, Thanks for offering up some concrete thoughts. Far more solid than my own! I was conducting a Gedanken experiment to see how far it can go, even fantasizing of a subscription kickstarter project, to hire Kamakura to build an 'edition' of bins to an 'idealized' spec. Or use other means to convince one of the major players to produce a 'retro' custom bin... This is not a practical venture... but interesting.\n\nMeanwhile, you're already thinking specifics..\n\nStandardization. You've addressed an element of it with regard to thinking about prisms, but ahead of that might be agreeing on a format... 7x, 8x, 10x, - 30, 32, 35, 40 42, 50...\n\nHere's a collection of random observations in response:\n\nPrisms:\n\nI was leaning towards Porro, partially because I bow to the experience and expertise around here that I lack. In addition, the simplicity of manufacture might offer an advantage in terms of cost and the opportunity for less things to go wrong...\n\nPlenty of good minds here, but consensus on anything is not a hallmark of this place. I figured on just digging up what I could find on prisms to learn for myself the whats and the whys. There's so many folks who could probably address many issues you bring up straight away, and be done with it.\n\nA few more things to chew on:\n\nYou've probably read up on Henry Link's experience with his 8x56 Zeiss Victory FL..achieving a certain optical nirvana by walking between the aberrational raindrops, so to speak...accepting the flaws of manufacture (Zeiss!) and simply reducing the amount by increasing the size of the exit pupil relative to the entrance pupil. A novel approach with a minor drawback: the bins need to be bigger for it to work. Trying to leverage that advantage into another format leaves me thinking: 6x42, 7x50... ?\n\nMoreover, reading a range of comments over the last few months, including Henry's own well done textbook example of an optical evaluation of a binocular for one of the recent Kowa BD xII deluxe turbo something or other...\n\nhttps://www.birdforum.net/showthread.php?t=384387\n\nEven Henry points out that the wide resolution deficit between the Kowa and his reference standard, the Nikon EII, is probably not noticeable until one puts the binocular on a tripod. Basically, that handheld binoculars can get away with lower resolution, because it can't be detected by most people when used that way..\n\nListening to Chuck Hill try to tweaze out the optical differences between an Ultravid Silverline and a Noctivid in an entire day out birding, or Canip doing something similar in a Leica shop, comparing the new Trinovid to some others, supports Henry's assertion to some extent, and also tells me that this whole dialogue is exactly what Bill Cook accuses us of doing repeatedly: Stacking BB's and hair splitting, And I think he's right. :t:\n\nDoesn't mean its not fun, but there are a lot of practical realities to chew on...\n\nFirst off, the current, excellent by most standards, performance of the top roofs is an indisputable benchmark. One can buy an existing product that is THAT GOOD. Drawback: costly.\n\nAlso on the market are products like the Habicht and the Canon IS lines, considered top optical performers by many, AND less expensive. Drawback: ergonomic dinosaurs, poor eye relief, narrow FOV on some models.\n\nThen suppose we try to shoehorn Henry's optical strategies into this cauldron of variables...\n\nWhat is the threshold of decreasing the exit pupil/entrance pupil ratio of performance advantage? I don't have a clue.\n\nSimple example:\n\nI've got a Carton 'Adlerblick' 7x50 binocular that I've owned for over 20 years. Orion sold them, advertised as long eye relief for glasses. Its got a 7° fov, weighs about 785 grams, and close focus is in the 7 meter ballpark. There's an\n\nexample of a 50mm Porro that has the weight of a portly 8x42 roof...A viable chassis perhaps to start with?\n\nWhat if we bump up the specs to 8.25 FOV, close focus 3 meters, maintain eye relief @ 18mm, then how much bigger and heavier would it be? How much more glass does it take to widen, and better correct the field? What if we bump magnification to 8x50?\n\nWould a 6.25 mm exit pupil be enough to grant the improved performance relative to a 7mm EP in daylight viewing? Inquiring minds want to know! (or not!)\n\nLight Transmission: I'll go with a 3% minimum threshold for visual detection, based on some rational consensus on earlier threads I've read. Some of the top roofs are in the 94% range. Even the 7x42 Habicht at reportedly 96% won't likely be a detectable difference, just a numerical advantage on paper. If we aim for a wider field, we're probably adding more glass, which drops the transmission regardless of the prism size...\n\nAttempting to fine tune color balance, flatten the curve, is an interesting endeavor. I have no idea which part of the system would make the most impact on it... maybe coatings.\n\nCat herding, BB stacking... consensus of format... consensus of anything...\n\nThat's all I got for today. I appreciate your interest and energy on the topic.\n\n-Bill\n\nBill, most of this comes down to the esoteric art of cat herding and geomancy ! o :cat:\n\nI have my own thoughts on a lot of it, but of necessity they have to remain proprietary until my remuneration contracts are signed and the money is in the bank ! :-O\n\nWe don't have to worry about BB stacking or practical limits - just shoot for the stars ...... the very last thing this poor beleaguered world needs is more medicore junk ! :brains:\n\nI'm going to need 8.5x mag, 150m Fov, 18mm ER, and a secret sauce objective size. IR prisms will of course be de Rigeur - though not the wings out Porro I type, nor the physically long A-K's. Weight will be less than 2/3rd kilo which will entail reams of biomimmicry design and a BOM chock full of unobtanium.\n\nChosun :gh:\n\nP.S. I think Dennis might actually BE Ken Rockwell, and not Howard Stern after all ..... ! 3"
