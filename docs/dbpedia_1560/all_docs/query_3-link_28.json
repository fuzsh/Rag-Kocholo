        "text": "Born in London on December 29, 1946, Marianne Faithfull has made significant contributions to the worlds of music, film and theater. A woman of many talents, Faithfull's career has been characterized by her versatile skills and continuous reinvention. Marianne's journey in the entertainment industry began in the 1960s when she transitioned from being a successful model to a singer. She gained fame with her debut single \"As Tears Go By,\" becoming one of the lead female artists during the British Invasion in the United States. In the subsequent years, she worked with notable musicians like Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, creating numerous hits. However, her career saw a brief downturn due to struggles with substance abuse and homelessness. Undeterred, Faithfull made a remarkable comeback in the late 1970s with the critically acclaimed album Broken English, demonstrating her resilience and immense talent. Apart from her musical endeavors, Faithfull also shone in the world of acting. She starred in films such as Girl on a Motorcycle and Irina Palm, receiving praise for her intense performances. Her theatrical credits include an adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's The Threepenny Opera. Additionally, she penned two memoirs that offer a candid look into her fascinating life and career.\n\nMarián Gáborík (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈmaɾijaːn ˈɡaːbɔɾiːk]; born 14 February 1982) is a Slovak professional ice hockey right winger currently under contract with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL). He began his playing career in the Slovak Extraliga with Dukla Trenčín for two seasons before being drafted third overall in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft by the Minnesota Wild, becoming the highest drafted Slovak player in NHL history. Spending eight seasons with the Wild before signing with the New York Rangers in 2009, Gáborík is the Wild's all-time leading scorer in goals. He has also played for the Columbus Blue Jackets and Los Angeles Kings. On 13 June 2014, Gáborík won his first Stanley Cup while playing for the Kings.

After spending his first seven NHL seasons with the Senators, he played for the Atlanta Thrashers, Pittsburgh Penguins, Detroit Red Wings, and Chicago Blackhawks. Over the course of his career, he made five NHL All-Star Game appearances and played in three consecutive Stanley Cup Finals with three different teams, finally winning the Stanley Cup in 2009–10 with Chicago.

Hossa accumulated 525 goals and 609 assists for 1,134 points in 1,309 regular-season games over his 19-year NHL career. He was the 44th player in NHL history to score 500 goals, and the 80th player to score 1,000 points. Prior to the 2017–18 season, the Blackhawks announced that Hossa was suffering from a progressive skin disorder and would miss the entire 2017–18 season. He announced he would no longer play professional hockey in May 2018 and intends to retire after his contract expires in 2021. Hossa's contract was traded to the Arizona Coyotes in July 2018 as part of a seven-player deal.\n\nMarian Rivera Gracia-Dantes (Fil) or Marian Gracia Rivera de Dantes (Es) (née Spanish: Marian Gracia y Rivera; Filipino: Marian Rivera Gracia; born 12 August 1984), known professionally as Marian Rivera, is a Filipino commercial model and actress, best known for her roles in MariMar, Dyesebel, Amaya, and Temptation of Wife.
