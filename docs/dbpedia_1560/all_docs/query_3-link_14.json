        "text": "Jerrad “Jerry” F. Disch, age 86 of Monroe, passed away peacefully with family by his side on Wednesday, June 5, 2024 at Pleasant View Nursing Home. He was born the son of John and Celeste (Rinehardt) Disch on February 26, 1938 in Monroe. He was a graduate of Monroe High School. Jerry was united in marriage to Rita Hilber on July 4, 1957 at St. Victor’s Catholic Church; she preceded him in death in 2003.\n\nJerry worked for Oaktron Industries, later known as MTX, as the National Sales Manager for 35 years, retiring in 1997. Jerry and Rita lived in Monroe throughout their working years; after retirement they relocated to Arizona. Jerry moved back to Monroe in March of 2023 due to his failing health and to be closer to family.\n\nJerry had been a member of Monroe Boat Club and St. Clare of Assisi Parish at St. Victor’s Catholic Church. Making home improvements was an ongoing theme, two homes in Monroe, weekend homes on Lake Wisconsin, and again in retirement homes in Arkansas and Arizona.\n\nIn the earlier years there were many family camping trips made throughout the US and Canada, then later weekends to their home on Lake Wisconsin. He and Rita enjoyed traveling, having made several trips to Switzerland, where Rita was from; as well as Argentina, Greece, China, Hawaii and Alaska. More recently to Panama with his dear friend Pat. In his later years he enjoyed doing crossword puzzles, and watching tennis, the Packers and Badgers on television.\n\nJerry will be remembered for his boisterous personality, his quick laughter, singing silly songs around the campfire and always bringing chocolate when he was visiting his great grandchildren, who affectionately referred to him as “Chocolate Grandpa-”.\n\nJerry is survived by his children, Chandra (Rich) Speich of Monroe, Denise (Greg) Snow of River Falls, WI, and Chris (Kim) Disch of Broomfield, CO; grandchildren, Jason Speich, Carmen (Mark) Halvorson, Garrett (Krista) Snow, Melissa (Evan Williamson) Snow, Mariah (Kevin) Smits, Jack Disch, and Keira Disch; 12 great-grandchildren; brother, Ron Disch of Monroe; and special friend, Patricia Hartman of Green Valley, AZ.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; wife, Rita; brother, Daryl Disch; and sister-in-law, Sue Disch.\n\nPrivate family services will be held, with burial in Calvary Cemetery. Those who wish to give memorials can make a donation to SSM Health Monroe Hospice in Jerry’s memory. A special thank you goes to the staff at Pleasant View Nursing Home and Hospice for the care given during his short stay.\n\nShriner Hager Gohlke Funeral Home is assisting the family.
