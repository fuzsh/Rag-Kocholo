        "text": "Jane C. Weiler, age 83, of Washburn, Wisconsin, passed away unexpectedly on Monday, March 4, 2024.\n\nJane was born July 21, 1940, in Washburn, the daughter of Rudy and Verna (Frechette) Gago. She grew up there alongside her cherished siblings, Carol, Sandy, and Jim. Jane earned her bachelor’s degree in biology at Northland College, where she was set up on a blind date with a fellow student named Ken. After his dogged pursuit, Ken and Jane married and were inseparable for the next fifty-nine years. After many years living elsewhere in Wisconsin, largely in the Milwaukee area, Ken and Jane returned to Washburn fifteen years ago. They could always be seen walking through town hand in hand. She dedicated her time to multiple causes in her hometown: she was a member of the advisory committee for the Washburn Heritage Association (WHA), was involved in the renovation of the Washburn Community and Recreation Center (The Club), and supported the Tony Woiak History Festival. Jane was a devoted mother and grandmother, always there for her children at the end of every school day and a constant presence for her treasured grandchildren. Her love and generosity, as well as her famous chocolate chip cookies, will be deeply missed. She and Ken have been reunited and are walking hand in hand again.\n\nShe is survived by her children, Wendy (Robert Erb), Robert (Denise Kaderabek), and Patricia; grandchildren, Avery Erb, Matthew Weiler, Ellis Erb, and Leah Weiler; her sisters, Carol (James) Dibbell and Sandra (Richard) Johnson; and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband, Kenneth, in 2021; her parents; and a brother, James Gago.\n\nA Celebration of life will be held at Harbor Table, 128 Harbor View Dr, Washburn, WI 54891, June 8, 2024, noon-4 pm.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to The Club, 3 W Bayfield St, Washburn, WI 54891 or the Tony Woiak History Festival, Wisconsin Heritage Association, PO Box 814, Washburn, WI 54891"
