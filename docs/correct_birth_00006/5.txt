Students from Olsen House School have been exploring the legacy and legends of the city as part of their enrichment sessions

A group of pupils visited the Museum of Liverpool Life and thoroughly enjoyed an exhibition about John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

The Beatles theme continued as they undertook a tour of Beatles landmarks including John Lennonâ€™s childhood home, Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, Arnold Grove (the birthplace of George Harrison) and the family home of the McCartneys in Forthlin Road which is labelled as the birthplace of the Beatles.

Students have enjoyed learning more about this legendary band and the impact that they had, and still have, on the city of Liverpool.
