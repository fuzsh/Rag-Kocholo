John Winston Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 in the Liverpool Maternity Hospital, Oxford Street, Liverpool, to Julia Lennon (née Stanley) and Alfred “Freddie” Lennon.

John was named after his paternal grandfather, John ‘Jack’ Lennon, and British prime minister Winston Churchill. His father Alf wasn’t present at the birth as he was away at sea with the Merchant Navy.

In later years Lennon’s aunt Mimi claimed that a German air raid took place on the night of Lennon’s birth. In fact, there was no bombing in Liverpool on this date.
