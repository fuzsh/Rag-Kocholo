        "text": "Background\n\nJohn Lennon was an English singer, songwriter, musician, and peace activist, born in Liverpool, United Kingdom. He gained popularity as the founder, co-songwriter, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the rock band, the Beatles. Early in his career, Lennon formed a band called the Quarrymen in 1956, later becoming The Beatles, one of the most successful bands of all time. Lennon found mainstream success in 1963 in the U.K. with his band, releasing their first studio album, “Please Please Me.” That same year, his girlfriend, Cynthia Lennon, gave birth to his first son.\n\nIn 1964, Lennon and his bandmates made their international debut on “The Ed Sullivan Show” in the United States, and after years of touring, filming, and songwriting, the band released their eighth studio album, titled “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” which was just one of their most famous albums. In 1969, Lennon married his girlfriend Yoko Ono, and in September of the same year, he left the band. In 1970, Lennon released a solo album, called “John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band,” which received much praise from critics.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1975, Lennon collaborated on chart-topping singles with other well-known artists, such as Elton John on ‘Whatever Gets You thru the Night’ and David Bowie on the single ‘Fame.’ In 1975, Ono gave birth to Lennon’s second son. Following a five-year break, Lennon returned to music in November 1980 with the Ono collaboration “Double Fantasy.” One month later, Lennon was killed by a fan after returning home from a studio session. We don’t think this powerful artist will ever be forgotten, and rightfully so."
