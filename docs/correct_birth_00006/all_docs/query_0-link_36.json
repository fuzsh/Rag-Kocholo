The 1.30pm and 2.10pm tours depart from Speke Hall, a National Trust property which is 7 miles south of the city centre, next to Liverpool Airport. Please see 'How to get here' on the homepage for more information.\n\nWhere do I need to wait for my tour?\n\nPlease be at your departure point 15 minutes before your tour time. Tours will depart at their set start time and latecomers will not be permitted access to the houses.\n\nIf your tour departs from Speke Hall, please ask the members of staff in reception and they'll show you where the bus picks up from.\n\nIf your tour departs from Liverpool South Parkway, please wait at bus stand 2. Our minibus driver will meet you there.\n\nWhat do I need to bring with me?\n\nYour booking reference number and, if you're a National Trust member, proof of your membership. You can show your reference number on a phone or tablet, as a printout of your confirmation email or just written down, the choice is yours!\n\nCan I meet the tour at the houses instead of taking the minibus?\n\nNo, everyone must arrive on our minibus. Both houses are in residential neighbourhoods and we must carefully manage entry to the houses so as not to cause disruption to the neighbourhoods. Tours will depart at their set start time and latecomers will not be permitted access to the houses.\n\nWhile on the tour\n\nHow long does the tour last?\n\nApproximately 2 hours. Every tour slot spends the same amount of time at both houses.\n\nCan I leave my bag on the bus?\n\nSorry, there's no space on the bus to store belongings. You'll have to take everything with you on the tour. Space is limited at the houses so your bags, cameras etc will be stored safely in a locked space at each house. Please note that we don't have the space available to store large bags and suitcases so please don't bring them with you on the tour.\n\nCan I bring food and drink?\n\nFood and drink cannot be taken into the houses, so we advise you to finish drinks and place any disposable cups in bins provided at Speke Hall or Liverpool South Parkway before you begin the tour.\n\nCan I take photographs?\n\nUnfortunately photography isn't allowed inside the houses for copyright reasons. There's some time at each house for you to take pictures outside though. You also have the option of purchasing a guidebook when booking your ticket, which will be ready for you to pick up when arrive. We're currently unable to sell guidebooks at the houses.\n\nCan I bring my dog?\n\nSorry we can't allow dogs on the tour, except for assistance dogs."
