        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nToday in 1940, John Lennon was born in Liverpool, England. Lennon was a co-founder, singer, songwriter and guitarist with The Beatles, who sold more than 20 million singles worldwide between 1962 and 1970, and scored more U.K. and U.S. No. 1 albums than any other group. Post-Beatles, Lennon enjoyed a successful solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and iconic songs such as \"Give Peace a Chance,\" \"Working Class Hero\" and \"Imagine.\" On Dec. 8, 1980, Lennon was killed outside his New York home by a gunman. In 2002, a BBC poll voted Lennon eighth in a list of 100 Greatest Britons. Lennon was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice â€” as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1994.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1961 - Ray Charles started a two week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Hit The Road Jack.\"\n\n1964 - The Beach Boys recorded \"Dance Dance Dance,\" with Glen Campbell playing the lead-guitar intro. It would go on to become the Beach Boys' 12th Top 40 hit.\n\n1964 - Because of an anti-apartheid embargo by the British Musicians' union, the Rolling Stones cancelled a South African tour.\n\n1965 - The Beatles started a four-week run at No.1 on the U.S. singles chart with the Paul McCartney ballad 'Yesterday' giving the group their tenth US No.1.\n\n1973 - Elvis Presley and Priscilla divorced after six years of marriage. Priscilla was awarded property, $725,000 cash and $4,200 a month support.\n\n1975 - Sean Taro Ono Lennon was born, the only child of John Lennon by Yoko Ono; John and Sean share the same birthday (John was 35 when Sean was born). Sean went on to become a singer, songwriter, musician and actor.\n\n1976 - Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band went to No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"A Fifth Of Beethoven,\" a disco rendition of the composer's Symphony No. 5, Op. 67, First Movement.\n\n1978 - Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel died of cancer at age 49. Artists who have recorded Brel's songs include Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, Dusty Springfield, David Bowie and Nina Simone.\n\n1993 - Nirvana entered the U.S. album chart at No. 1 with In Utero, their third and final studio album.\n\n2007 - The Imagine Peace Tower was officially unveiled near Reykjavik, Iceland. The memorial to John Lennon from his widow, Yoko Ono, consists of a tall \"tower of light\" projected from a white stone monument that has the words \"Imagine Peace\" carved into it in 24 languages.\n\nBirthdays:\n\nThe Who bassist John Entwhistle was born today in 1944.\n\nJackson Browne is 67.\n\nPogues accordionist James Fearnley is 61.\n\nPJ Harvey is 45."
