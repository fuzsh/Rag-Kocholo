        "text": "Where did John Lennon grow up?\n\nJohn Lennon was born on October 9, 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital, to mother Julia (1914–1958) and father Alfred (1912–1976).\n\nAlfred was a merchant seaman of Irish descent, and his parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather John 'Jack' Lennon, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\n\nHis father was away from home regularly but sent pay cheques to where John lived with his mother. However, the cheques stopped when he went absent without leave in February 1944.\n\nWhen he returned home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia, at that point pregnant with another man's child, rejected him.\n\nJulia later gave custody of John to his aunt Mimi. It has been claimed that when his father took him to Blackpool with the aim of emigrating to New Zealand, the five-year-old was forced to choose between his parents, eventually picking his mother.\n\nOn July 15, 1958, Julia was killed by a car driven by an off-duty policeman, close to her sister's house. Stanley died in Brighton, where lived after marrying Pauline Jones, 35 years his junior, with whom he had two sons.\n\nWhen did he join The Beatles?\n\nAged 15 in July 1957, Paul McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton.\n\nThe Quarrymen mostly rock and roll and skiffle music. McCartney was soon asked to join as a rhythm guitarist.\n\nGeorge Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960.\n\nAfter trying several names, they chose The Beatles in August 1960, and signed drummer Pete Best before a residency in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nWithin a few years, and with the arrival of Ringo Starr, the Fab Four quickly became the biggest stars on the planet, selling over 800 million records worldwide.\n\nWho was John Lennon married to and how many children did he have?\n\nLennon met Cynthia Powell in 1957, when they were students at the Liverpool College of Art.\n\nThe couple married in August 1962, soon after she became pregnant with his first child, Julian. Julian was born in April 1963.\n\nBy 1967, Lennon had started a relationship with Yoko Ono, and they eventually divorced a year later, with Cynthia taking custody of Julian.\n\nLennon first met Yoko Ono in November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London, where she was preparing her conceptual art exhibit.\n\nOno had suffered three miscarriages, but eventually gave birth to their child Sean in 1975.\n\nBoth Sean and Julian have become musicians in their own right.\n\nWhen did he pass away?\n\nAt 5pm on December 8, 1980, Lennon autographed a copy of his Double Fantasy album for fan Mark David Chapman, before leaving The Dakota hotel with Ono for a recording session.\n\nLater, they returned to their apartment at around 10.50pm. As they walked through the archway of the building, Chapman shot Lennon four times in the back at close range.\n\nHe was rushed to the emergency room of Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival at 11.00om.\n\nChapman pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years to life.\n\nSoon after, both 'Just Like Starting Over' and 'Imagine' hit number one in the UK, while 'Happy Xmas' peaked at number two."
