The Beatles took a trip through the Birkenead road tunnel (just like we will do) over to the Wirral Peninsula on many occasions, and played in so many different venues. This is where Ringo made his debut as a Beatle! Paul McCartney still has a house here and there are so many stories from the Merseybeat era connected to locations such as New Brighton, Port Sunlight etc. The Wirral is a stunning location and we will make our way around the coast taking in all the Beatles history.\n\nThe highlights include: New Brighton Promenade, former Majestic Ballroom Birkenhead, Grosvenor Ballroom Liscard, Hulme Hall in Port Sunlight, Barnston Women’s Institute, former Macdonna Hall in West Kirby, Victoria Hall in Bebington, Broadway Ave in Wallasey, former Beno Dorn Tailors in Birkenhead and Trinity Road (Cynthia Lennon’s Family Home)"
