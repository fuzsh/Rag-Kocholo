        "text": "The Beatles in Liverpool\n\nThe Beatles were four young lads from Liverpool who infamously revolutionized pop music and changed the world. Comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, the Beatles was formed in 1960 and is are regarded as the most influential band of all time. Fans can explore their roots on a visit to the city, discovering the houses, parks and streets that inspired them. The city of Liverpool is where the Beatles grew up and started their music career.\n\nThe purpose of this webpage is to show a selection of some of the main Beatles-related sites that can be seen in and around the City of Liverpool. This theme is sometimes also touched on, on this websiteâs main Liverpool webpage Here. There is also a mention of The Beatlesâ time in London on this website with (mainly) reference to Abbey Road Here.\n\nAbove: A lesser-known Beatles-related sight in Liverpool, Penny Lane pub The Dovedale Towers. John Lennon and Paul McCartney played here several times with The Quarrymen in 1957.\n\nThe Beatles in Liverpool: How the Fab Four Shaped the City\n\nNaturally, there are countless books, articles, and websites that explore âeverything Beatleâ in varying depths and subject matters. It is not therefore the aim here to reveal anything new about the Fab Four, rather than to provide a brief summary of the band with respect to the city, in order to put the photographs from the author's visit and their descriptions that follow into some sort of context.\n\nThe Beatles are widely regarded as the most influential rock band of all time, and their impact on music, culture and society is still felt today. But how did their hometown of Liverpool shape their early lives, careers and creativity? Here, we will explore some of the places and people that influenced the Beatles in Liverpool, and how you can experience them for yourself.\n\nAbove: Throughout Liverpool, it can sometimes be difficult to escape any sort of reference to The Beatles!\n\nAs many readers may be well aware, Liverpool is a port city in northwest England, where the River Mersey meets the Irish Sea. It has a rich history of trade, migration and innovation, and a vibrant cultural scene that includes music, art, literature and sport. The Beatles grew up in various parts of the city and met each other through their shared passion for rock and roll.\n\nThe Beatles were formed in 1960 by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They started out playing in local clubs and pubs, such as the Cavern Club on Mathew Street, where they performed nearly 300 times between 1961 and 1963. The Cavern Club is still open today, and hosts live music events and tribute bands. You can also see a statue of John Lennon leaning against the wall outside the club, as well as a bronze sculpture of the four lads who shook the world at Pier Head, adjacent to the river and neat the cityâs famous âThree Gracesâ buildings.\n\nAbove: Roll up roll up for the Magical Mystery Tour. Step right this wayâ¦\n\nOne of the best ways to see the Beatles' Liverpool is to take a two-hour âMagical Mystery Tourâ, a guided bus tour that stops at various locations related to the band's history. Starting at The Royal Albert Dock, you can see places that include Ringo Starr's birthplace at 9 Madryn Street, George Harrisonâs Birthplace at 12 Arnold Grove (passengers get off the bus here), Penny Lane (passengers get off the bus here for a photo opportunity next to the road sign), St Peterâs Church Hall (where John and Paul met for the first time), Strawberry Field (passengers get off the bus here), John Lennonâs childhood home at Mendips, and Paul McCartneyâs childhood home at 20 Forthlin Road (passengers get off the bus here). The tour ends at the Cavern Club, where you can enjoy some live music and a drink. Be sure to show your ticket at the bar to collect a souvenir postcard too! (other tours are available from other operators, including private tours).\n\nAnother main attraction in the city is âThe Beatles Storyâ, a museum that tells the story of the band's lives and times through multimedia exhibits, authentic memorabilia and exclusive photographs. The museum is located on two sites: Albert Dock and Pier Head. You can learn about the band's early days in Liverpool, their rise to fame in London and America, their creative experiments in India and Abbey Road Studios, their break-up and solo careers, and their lasting legacy.\n\nLiverpool is also home to an annual âInternational Beatleweek Festivalâ, which takes place every August and features over 70 bands from across the world, as well as specialist events and a convention. The festival celebrates the music and culture of the Beatles, and attracts thousands of fans from all over the world.\n\nLiverpool is rightly proud of its Beatles heritage, and you can find many references to the band throughout the city. You can walk along Mathew Street and see the names of all the artists who have performed at the Cavern Club on the outside wall of the Cavern Pub. You can also see Liverpool's Wall of Fame, which displays the names of every Liverpool band or solo artist who has reached number one in the UK charts. The Beatles in Liverpool are more than just a tourist attraction; they are a part of the city's identity and history. The band was influenced by Liverpool's diverse and dynamic culture, and in turn they influenced generations of musicians and artists who followed them. If you are a fan of the Beatles or just curious about their origins, you should definitely visit Liverpool and discover how the Fab Four shaped the city.\n\nThe Beatle Touristy Bit\n\nThe photos on this webpage were taken during both a âMagical Mystery Tourâ and some independent exploring of the city on foot and by car, and are in no specific chronological order relating to either âtourâ:\n\nBeatles Statue\n\nAs mentioned above, at the Pier Head in Liverpool there is a stunning statue of the Fab Four. The statue was unveiled in 2015 and donated to the city by the Cavern Club organisation, which felt there was no one place Beatles fans could gather in Liverpool to celebrate the band.\n\nThe statue depicts John, Paul, George and Ringo in their early 1960âs style, around the time of âHard Dayâs Nightâ. It is slightly bigger than real life and has beautiful movement. It stands between The Three Graces (The Liver building and two others) and the modern Mersey Ferries building. The statue also has some hidden details that reveal more about the personal history of each Beatle. For example, Paul McCartney carries a camera, possibly in a nod to his relationship with Linda Eastman. John Lennon has two acorns in his hand, which symbolise his wish for world peace with Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr has the number '8' on the sole of his boot, which references his childhood postcode in Liverpool. George Harrison has Sanskrit writing on his belt, which is a mantra that reflects his spiritual beliefs. A must-see sight, at busy times, visitors may have to wait for a turn to take a photo with the band, but it is worth it.\n\nBrian Epstein Statue\n\nIn the city, there is also a statue of Beatlesâ manager, Brian Epstein. The statue was unveiled on 28 August 2022, near the former site of his family's NEMS record electrical store on the corner of Button Street and Whitechapel shopping street. The sculpture is made of bronze and measures just a little over 6 feet 4 inches (1.94m) in height. It depicts Epstein in a suit and tie, holding a record in his hand.\n\nEpstein is widely regarded as the fifth Beatle, as he was instrumental in shaping the band's image, style and success. He discovered The Beatles in 1961 at the Cavern Club and signed them to a contract. He also managed other Liverpool acts such as Cilla Black, Gerry and The Pacemakers and Billy J Kramer and The Dakotas. The statue is the first of an LGBTQ+ figure in Liverpool city centre, as Epstein was a gay man living at a time when homosexuality was illegal. He faced many personal challenges and died at the age of 32 due to an accidental overdose from a sedative. It can be said that his death marked the beginning of the end of the Beatles, such was his importance in managing them. The statue was funded by Liverpool BID Company and championed by the Brian Epstein Legacy Project, which had been campaigning for five years to honour his contribution to music and culture. The unveiling coincided with the 2022 International Beatleweek, which celebrates the legacy of The Fab Four in their hometown. The statue is a fitting tribute to Epstein's legacy and a reminder of his impact on the world of music and art.\n\nJohn Lennonâs Childhood Home\n\nThe childhood home of John Lennon, âMendipsâ (above), is located at 251 Menlove Avenue in Liverpoolâs suburb of Woolton. Here, John lived with his Aunt Mimi and Uncle George from 1945 to 1963. He was born in 1940 to Alfred Lennon, a merchant seaman of Irish descent and Julia Stanley. However, his parents separated when he was very young and he lost his mother as a teenager. During his childhood, he saw little of his father Freddie, who went AWOL whilst serving in the navy. The painful experiences of his early life made their way into his poignant and evocative lyrics which have entertained generations of music lovers. His childhood house is now a National Trust property and it is possible to take a guided tour of the rooms where Lennon wrote some of his early songs, played his guitar and listened to records. Some of his personal belongings are also on show, such as his school reports, drawings and photographs. The house is full of memories and stories of Lennon's life and music, and here it is possible to feel the inspiration that shaped his creative genius.\n\nPaul McCartneyâs Childhood Home\n\n20 Forthlin Road (above) is a historic house in Liverpool, England, where Paul McCartney lived for several years in his childhood. It is now owned by the National Trust and open to the public as a museum. The house was built in 1949 and rented by the local council to the McCartney family in 1955. Paul was 13 years old at the time and attended secondary school nearby. He lived there with his father Jim, his mother Mary (who died of cancer in 1956), and his younger brother Mike. The house is a modest terraced house with two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom. It has a small garden at the back where Paul and his friends used to play music. The house is furnished with original items from the 1950s and 1960s, such as furniture, photographs, books and records. The house is considered to be \"the birthplace of the Beatles\" because it is where Paul and John Lennon wrote many of their early songs together. They met at a church fete in 1957 and became friends through their mutual love of music. They often visited each other's homes and practiced their guitar skills and song-writing in Paul's bedroom or living room.\n\nAround 30 of the world's most famous songs were written and rehearsed at 20 Forthlin Road. Some of the famous songs that were composed or rehearsed within this otherwise unassuming property include \"Love Me Do\", \"I Saw Her Standing There\", \"Please Please Me\", \"She Loves You\", \"Yesterday\" and \"Hey Jude\". The house also witnessed some important events in the Beatles' history, such as Paul's audition for John's band The Quarrymen, George Harrison's introduction to the group, and Ringo Starr's first visit. The house was sold by Jim McCartney in 1965 after Paul bought him a new house in Heswall. It changed hands several times until it was acquired by the National Trust in 1995. The Trust restored it to its original appearance and opened it to the public in 1998. It is now one of the most popular tourist attractions in Liverpool, along with John Lennon's childhood home Mendips. For those wishing to see inside these houses, guided tours can be booked online or by phone (see âThe Beatles' Childhood Homesâ on the National Trust website Here).\n\nThe house, alongside some of the other places mentioned on this webpage and this websiteâs Liverpool webpage, was featured on The Late Late Show host James Cordenâs Paul McCartney Carpool Karaoke, which is well worth watching if the sights on this webpage interest the reader.\n\nGeorge Harrisonâs Birthplace and Early Childhood Home\n\nGeorge Harrison was born at home on February 25, 1943 in Liverpool, England. He was the youngest of four children of Harold and Louise Harrison. His father was a bus driver and his mother was a shop assistant.\n\nGeorge grew up in the house where he was born (centre of photo above), a modest property at 12 Arnold Grove, Wavertree, which is now a popular tourist attraction for Beatles fans. The house had only two bedrooms, a tiny kitchen, and an outdoor toilet. George shared a room with his three siblings and slept in a bunk bed. He attended Dovedale Primary School and later the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys, where he met Paul McCartney. George developed an interest in music at an early age and learned to play the guitar, ukulele, and harmonica. He was influenced by rock and roll, skiffle, and country music. He joined John Lennon's band, the Quarrymen, in 1958 and became one of the founding members of the Beatles.\n\nRingo Starrâs Birthplace\n\nBeatlesâ drummer Ringo Starr (real name Richard Starkey) was born on July 7, 1940 in 9 Madryn Street, Liverpool (property with red door, centre of photo above). He only lived there for 5 months of his life, moving to 10 Admiral Grove, and also spending time in the Childrenâs Hospital in Myrtle Street. The house here was built in a working-class neighbourhood built in the Victorian period, with the terraced properties being known as the âWelsh Streetsâ (more on this below). The house on Madryn Street was under threat of demolition for several years under city council plans to improve the run-down area, but was saved after a public backlash.\n\nOn a side-note, the group of late 19th century Victorian terraced streets in this part of Toxteth, Liverpool, are known as the Welsh Streets. The houses were designed by Richard Owens and built by Welsh workers to house migrants from Wales seeking work; the streets were named after Welsh villages and landmarks; the moniker âWelsh Streetsâ is given as they were constructed by Welsh builders for Welsh migrants seeking work and housing in Liverpool and named after Welsh towns, valleys and villages. The Welsh Streets have held lasting appeal to young and old alike, offering affordable housing in a friendly neighbourhood. The local area (including Kinmel Street and Powis Street which are either side of Madryn Street) was used as part of filming for the hit BBC drama Peaky Blinders (supposed to be set in Birmingham!).\n\nRingo Starrâs Childhood Home\n\nNot far from Ringoâs birthplace is 10 Admiral Grove. It is the house in which Ringo Starr lived for twenty years before he rose to fame with the Beatles. His infant school, St. Silas Primary School, on Pengwern Street, was a short walk from his front door. Ringo had a difficult childhood, as he suffered from various illnesses and spent a lot of time in hospitals. He also faced poverty and violence in his surroundings. Despite these hardships, Ringo developed a passion for music and learned to play the drums by himself. He joined several bands before becoming a member of The Beatles in 1962, replacing their original drummer Pete Best. He adopted the stage name Ringo Starr because he liked the sound of it and because he often wore rings on his fingers. He was known for his distinctive style of drumming and his witty personality. He also sang lead vocals on some of The Beatles' songs, such as \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". After The Beatles broke up in 1970, he pursued a solo career as a singer and songwriter, as well as an actor and producer. He is one of the most influential and successful drummers of all time.\n\nRingo Starr Mural\n\nNear Ringo Starrâs childhood home on Admiral Grove is the site of the former Empress pub, where his mother worked as a barmaid and as a young lad, served as Ringoâs local. In more recent times it has been converted into a Beatles themed hotel. On the side of the building is an unmissable mural of the man himself (shown above). Covering an entire wall, the artwork was created by Liverpool artist John Culshaw. As a point of note, Ringo Starr pays tribute to the Empress pub on the cover of his 1970 debut solo album âSentimental Journeyâ; the LP cover consisted of a photograph of the pub by Richard Polak.\n\nPenny Lane\n\nThe song \"Penny Lane\", named after the now famous street in Liverpool, was released in 1967 as a double A-side single with \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", another song that evoked John Lennon's nostalgia for Liverpool. Penny Lane was named after James Penny, a slave trader who lived in the area in the 18th century. McCartney wrote most of the song, with some help from Lennon, and based it on his observations of Penny Lane and its surroundings. He said: \"Penny Lane was kind of nostalgic, but it was really [about] a place that John and I knew ... I'd get a bus to his house and I'd have to change at Penny Lane, or the same with him to me, so we often hung out at that terminus, like a roundabout. It was a place that we both knew, and so we both knew the things that turned up in the story.\"\n\nThe Penny Lane terminus described by McCartney is situated at the junction of Smithdown Road, Smithdown Place and Penny Lane. Smithdown Place was originally part of a causeway that emerged in the 18th century and became a major tram junction and bus terminus. The song was actually inspired by this junction and the bus station located there. However, tourists often stop at a Penny Lane sign to take photos at the other end of the road where it is easier for vehicles to stop; as seen from the photograph below, there is not much else to see of note at this end of the road:\n\nSome of the other things that âturned up in the storyâ follow:\n\nâ The barber shop: McCartney saw a barber's shop with pictures of its clients on the wall, and included it in the first verse: \"On the corner is a banker with a motorcar / The little children laugh at him behind his back / And the banker never wears a mac / In the pouring rain, very strange / There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back / In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs / Of every head he's had the pleasure to know\". The barber's shop is still there today, and has become a tourist attraction for Beatles fans [no photo].\n\nFormer bank that helped inspire The Beatlesâ classic Penny Lane\n\nâ The fire station: McCartney also saw a fire station near Penny Lane, and imagined a fireman keeping his engine clean. He sang: \"Then the fireman rushes in / From the pouring rain, very strange / Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes / There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back / Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes / There beneath the blue suburban skies / Penny Lane\". The fire station was demolished in 1976, but a plaque marks its former location.\n\nâ The nurse: McCartney remembered seeing a nurse selling poppies for Remembrance Day (November 11th), which commemorates the end of World War I. He sang: \"Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout / A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray / And though she feels as if she's in a play / She is anyway / In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer / We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim / And then the fireman rushes in / From the pouring rain, very strange\".\n\nThe song lyrics âBehind the shelter in the middle of a roundaboutâ refers to a former tram shed and a bus terminus. The site has seen many changes over the years, eventually becoming a bistro called Sergeant Pepper's that closed in 2003 (shown above). It has been recently transformed into a stunning new restaurant featuring a first floor circular glass extension that offers a panoramic view of the Penny Lane roundabout. Renovation of the site has been slow, with various challenges and delays, such as planning permission issues, trademark disputes, water damage and vandalism. However, with a new tenant for the site, at the time of writing, there is optimism that this will become a must-visit spot for anyone interested in the Beatles heritage.\n\n\"Penny Lane\" was a hit across Europe and America, and is widely regarded as one of the Beatles' best songs. It captures McCartney's fondness for his hometown and his childhood friend Lennon, who would later be estranged from him due to personal and professional conflicts. The song also showcases the Beatles' musical innovation and experimentation, as they used unusual instruments, modulations, and sound effects to create a psychedelic pop masterpiece.\n\nSt Barnabas' Church, Mossley Hill\n\nSt Barnabasâ Church (above) is located in Smithdown Place, Mossley Hill. It stands at the junction of Allerton Road, Smithdown Road, and Penny Lane. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Liverpool South Childwall, the archdeaconry of Liverpool, and the diocese of Liverpool. Paul McCartney said on The Late Late Show with James Corden that he sang in the choir of St Barnabas' Church when he was young. A brass plate on the Choir stalls of the Church was installed to commemorate this. Paul McCartneyâs Mike got married at the church in May 1982.\n\nStrawberry Fields\n\nStrawberry Fields is a famous landmark on Beaconsfield Road close to John Lennonâs Childhood Home on Menlove Avenue. It was originally a Salvation Army children's home where John Lennon used to play as a child, and was to inspire one of the Beatles' most popular songs; Lennon wrote \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" as a nostalgic tribute to his childhood memories.\n\nAbove: Strawberry Fields iconic red gates, gardens and visitorâs centre\n\nToday, Strawberry Fields is a visitor attraction that offers a glimpse into Lennon's life and legacy. Visitors can explore the original Victorian house, the interactive exhibition, the tranquil gardens, and the iconic red gates. They can also learn about the work of the Salvation Army and how they support vulnerable children and young adults. Strawberry Fields is a must-see destination for Beatles fans and anyone interested in Liverpool's rich musical heritage. At the time of writing, it is open daily from 10am to 6pm, and tickets can be booked online or at the gate (link to Strawberry Fields website Here).\n\nSt Peterâs Church and Church Hall, Woolton\n\nWoolton is a quiet suburb of Liverpool, England, that may not seem like a place where history was made. But it was here in a small church hall that one of the most influential musical partnerships of all time began. On July 6, 1957, John Lennon and Paul McCartney met for the first time at St Peter's Church Fete, where Lennon's skiffle band, the Quarrymen, was performing.\n\nThe Quarrymen had played earlier that day in a field behind the church, where McCartney had watched them from the crowd. He was impressed by Lennon's charisma and ability to improvise lyrics on the spot. He was also introduced to him by a mutual friend, Ivan Vaughan, who played in another skiffle group. That evening, the Quarrymen performed again in the church hall, and McCartney stood next to the stage, watching closely. He noticed that Lennon was playing a guitar that was not properly tuned, and that he did not know all the words to the songs he was singing. He decided to show off his own musical skills by playing some rock and roll classics on a piano backstage, and then by borrowing Lennon's guitar and playing \"Twenty Flight Rock\" by Eddie Cochran. Lennon was impressed by McCartney's talent and confidence, and asked him to join his band. McCartney agreed, and thus began a friendship and collaboration that would change the course of music history. The two young musicians soon started writing songs together, and eventually formed the Beatles with George Harrison and Ringo Starr.\n\nAbove: Church hall in Woolton. On the building, a plaque reads as follows: The Quarry Men featuring Eric Griffiths, Colin Hanton, Rod Davies, John Lennon, Pete Shotton and Len Garry performed on the afternoon of 6th July 1957 at St Peters Church Fete. In the evening before their performance at this hall Ivan Vaughan, who sometimes played in the group, introduced his friend Paul McCartney to John Lennon. As John recalled â¦â¦ â that was the day, the day that I met Paul, that it started moving. â\n\nWoolton Village still preserves some of the landmarks associated with this historic meeting. St Peter's Church Hall is still in use, although the stage where Lennon and McCartney met has been dismantled and stored away. John was involved in the church's youth group and occasionally sang in the church choir at weddings. The grave of Eleanor Rigby, who is thought to have inspired one of the Beatles' most famous songs, can be found in the churchyard. John Lennon's childhood home at 251 Menlove Avenue, where he lived with his Aunt Mimi and Uncle George, is just a short walk away (see further up this webpage). Woolton Village is a must-see destination for any Beatles fan who wants to experience the place where it all started. It is a testament to the power of music and friendship, and how a chance encounter can change the world.\n\nThe photo above, left, is of St Peter's Church itself, and above left, the gravestone, situated in the churchyard of St. Peterâs church, marking the grave of Eleanor Rigby. The gravestone includes a list of family members related to a John Rigby, with Eleanor Rigby being marked lower down as the âbeloved wife of Thomas Woods and granddaughter of the above [John Rigby]â.\n\nThe âEleanor Rigbyâ song by the Beatles that represents a departure from their early pop love songs. The song is about loneliness and depression. The Beatles are asking where all the lonely people come from and where they all belong. The song is an early example of the Beatles taking risks and dabbling in other genres, this particular example being baroque pop, as made evident by the string arrangements. The song tells the story of two lonely people. First, we meet a churchgoing woman named Eleanor Rigby, who is seen cleaning up rice after a wedding. The second verse introduces the pastor, Father McKenzie, whose sermons \"no one will hearâ. A detailed account of Eleanor Rigby (âEleanor Rigby - The Story beyond the Graveâ) may be found Here (external link).\n\nThe Museum of Liverpool\n\nBack to the city centre, The Museum of Liverpool includes exhibits covering all aspects of the music scene in the city and invariably includes a variety of Beatles-related displays:\n\nAbove: Suits made for The Beatles in 1963 by London tailor Douglas A Millings. They were produced after the bandâs manager Brian Epstein decided that the group needed a smart new image and were part of a look which was widely copied by fans.\n\nThe Cavern Club\n\nHere we save perhaps the most iconic Liverpool Beatles sight towards the end of this webpage, namely The Cavern Club (at 10 Mathew Street), or the âNew Cavern Clubâ, to be more precise.\n\nThe Cavern Club (above) is a famous music venue in Liverpool where The Beatles performed regularly in their early days. The club opened in 1957 as a jazz cellar, but soon became a hotspot for rock and roll bands. The Beatles made their debut at the Cavern Club on February 9, 1961, and went on to play there 292 times over the next three years. The club was also where they met their manager Brian Epstein, who saw them perform there in November 1961.\n\nThe Cavern Club was not only important for The Beatles, but also for the development of the Merseybeat sound, which was influenced by American rhythm and blues, skiffle, and rock and roll. The club hosted many other local bands, such as The Searchers, Gerry and the Pacemakers, and The Hollies, as well as acts from further afield, such as The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, and The Who. The club became a symbol of the 1960s âBritish Invasionâ (of the United States), and a cultural landmark for Liverpool.\n\nThe original Cavern Club, which was located in the basement of a warehouse, closed in 1973 due to financial difficulties and was demolished to make way for an underground Merseyrail station. However, a replica of the club was built across the same street (Matthew Street) from the original location in 1984, using some of the original bricks and features. The ânewâ club also features a replica of the stage where The Beatles played their famous gigs. The New Cavern Club continues to showcase live music and pay tribute to The Beatles and their legacy. It is a thriving music venue, hosting live performances every day of the week, and also has a museum that showcases memorabilia and history of the club and its performers. The Cavern Club is a must-see attraction for any music lover visiting Liverpool.

It was formerly known as the Magical Beatles Museum. The museum was created by Roag Best, son of Neil Aspinall* and Mona Best, half-brother of Pete Best and was inaugurated on 13 July 2018. The museum is housed in a Grade II listed former warehouse dating from the early 19th century. Inside, it is possible to see some 300 original items (there is an additional 1,200 items in storage), displayed in a five-storey building, with three of the floors dedicated to a different period in the Beatles history. Items on display include George Harrison's Futurama guitar, John Lennon's Sergeant Pepper medals, the cello from \"I Am the Walrus\", Pete Best's Premier drum, Paul McCartney's bass speaker, Lennon's custom-made egg chair, and gifts that Elvis Presley gave to the Beatles.\n\n*Neil Stanley Aspinall was a school friend of Paul McCartney and George Harrison. He was the Beatles' original road manager and went on to run the group's business empire for 40 years, heading the Beatles' company Apple Corps.\n\nâ Cilla Black Statue:\n\nOn Mathew Street, there is also a statue of Cilla Black. As many UK people will know, Cilla Black was an English singer and television presenter. She was born on 27 May 1943 in Liverpool, England, UK and passed away on 1 August 2015. The statue was unveiled in 2017 by her sons as a tribute to her life and career, having been commissioned by them as a thank you to the city for the support they received after her death in 2015. It stands outside the original entrance of the Cavern Club, where Cilla worked and sang in the 1960âs. The bronze statue is one-and-a-fifth life size, and shows Cilla smiling and waving, wearing a dress with squares that depict images and words from her shows, songs, and personal life. It stands on a disc of her number one single \"You're My World\", and has a flower from her wedding bouquet at the base, making it a fitting homage to one of Liverpool's most beloved entertainers. The statue was removed for maintenance in 2021, but was returned to its place in March 2022.\n\nCilla Black was undoubtedly one of Great Britainâs most successful and best-loved entertainers of all time. She began her career as a singer in 1963 and was championed by her friends the Beatles. Many British people will also know her from TV programmes; Cilla Black was a prominent television presenter in the 1980âs and 1990âs, hosting hit entertainment shows such as Blind Date (1985 to 2003), Surprise Surprise (1984 to 2001) and The Moment of Truth (1998 to 2001).\n\n[Photos and Text: March 2023]"
