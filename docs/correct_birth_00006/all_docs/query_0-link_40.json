The houses are not open every day so check with us first.\n\nAdvice for YOUR Beatles Tour: Get your trip of a lifetime right!\n\nIf you are planning your trip to Liverpool, and want a Beatles tour, then you will be taken to see:\n\nwhere Ringo Starr and George Harrison were born, where John Lennon lived with his Aunt Mimi at âMendipsâ and where Paul lived at 20, Forthlin Road.\n\nOne of the hidden gems of the Beatlesâ Liverpool, you need to visit the Casbah Coffee Club, the true âbirthplace of The Beatlesâ.\n\nGo on a private tour and discover the incredible stories, with the club that John, Paul and George helped to paint - and you can still see their artwork. Donât miss it.\n\nYou will also see Brian Epsteinâs home, Penny Lane, St. Peterâs where John and Paul met, and Strawberry Field. You could take a quick bus tour or in a taxi too and see the popular places.\n\nHowever, we donât believe in giving you the tour we want, but the tour YOU want.\n\nWe are different.\n\nThatâs why our Beatles tours have been designed by David Bedford, author of the only book on The Beatles and Liverpool: âLiddypool: Birthplace of The Beatlesâ. We even have VIP tours where David can accompany you. One tour doesnât fit all. We have several unique options, so that you can choose the Beatles tour that YOU want: just tell us where to go!\n\nSpoiled for choice? Use our Tour Planner to tell us what you would like to do and we will recommend the best tour for you. Why Liverpool Beatles Tours? We were chosen by Paul McCartneyâs film team to help with the pre-tour film on his âBack in the Worldâ tour, and showed May Pang, John Lennonâs former girlfriend, around Liverpool too.\n\nOne of our vehicles - Travel in luxury with us in our air-conditioned Mercedes (right)\n\nOr choose a cheaper option in a Taxi for a Fab Four taxi tour\n\nBOOK NOW\n\nOUR TOURS\n\nBeatles Tours\n\nVIP Beatles Tours\n\nSpecialist Tours\n\nVIP TOURS\n\n4 Hour VIP\n\nLiddypool\n\nAll Day 7 & 9 Hours\n\nSPECIALIST TOURS\n\nVIP Tours with David Bedford\n\nWorld War 2\n\nAmerican Connections\n\nOUT OF LIVERPOOL\n\nLake District\n\nNorth Wales & Chester\n\nBespoke Tours\n\nCRUISE SHIP TOURS\n\nUnique tours to fit around your sailing times\n\nWelcome to Liverpool Beatles Tours\n\nâIt was 20 years ago todayâ, as The Beatles sang.
