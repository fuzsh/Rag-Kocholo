However, his parents divorced when he was four years old so Lennon was raised by his aunt.\n\nDespite having a broken family, he maintained strong bonds with his mother, who encouraged him to play instruments and even taught him how to play the banjo and piano.\n\nAt the age of 16, he became so captivated with music that he decided to form a band named “The Quarrymen” which was named after the school he was attending, Quarry Bank High School.\n\nHowever, tragedy struck John Lennon’s life when, at the age of 17, his mother was killed in a car accident.\n\nJohn had emotional breakdowns as a result of the incident, so he turned to music and his band to help him cope. The Quarrymen was eventually renamed The Beatles.\n\nMUSIC CAREER\n\nJohn Lennon is the founder of the Beatles, as well as a singer, songwriter, and rhythm guitarist.\n\n“Love Me Do,” the band’s first single, was released in October 1962 and peaked at No. 17 on the British charts.\n\nWhen The Beatles achieved mainstream success in the United Kingdom in 1963, they were invited to perform at the Royal Variety Show, which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British Royalty.\n\nDespite the Beatles’ worldwide popularity, they decided to split up on August 27, 1967 for various reasons including tight schedules and internal disputes.\n\nHowever, many people also believe that the band’s breakup was caused by the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, who was beneficial in the band’s rise to fame.\n\nLater, John Lennon started his solo career in 1970 with a collaboration with his wife, Yoko Ono, and they were known as the “John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band”.\n\nIMPACT ON THE WORLD\n\nThroughout John Lennon’s career, he was regarded as one of the world’s most influential people in the past century and throughout his career, he became an inspiration to countless people through his music and peaceful protests.\n\nHe made music about being himself and portraying his unethical deeds, and this inspired many artists, musicians, and entertainers to be themselves in front of their fans.\n\nNot only was John Lennon famous for creating meaningful music, but he was also known for being outspoken about his political views during his lifetime and he expressed himself through his songs as well as his actions.\n\nPOLITICAL VIEWS\n\nLennon, during his time, became involved in drug exploration, meditation, therapy cures, world peace, and a variety of anti-government causes.\n\nHe was extremely vocal with his support for the anti-war movement, Native American and African -American rights, and feminism.\n\nSeveral people were aware that John Lennon held anti-system views. Similarly to the songs “Give Peace a Chance” and “Imagine,” Lennon used his social standing to promote awareness about war and marginalization instead of concealing his feelings.\n\nLennon married for the second time in March 1969, ushering in a new phase in his activism. Thus, the couple famously spent their honeymoon peacefully protesting the Vietnam War from their bed at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Lennon wrote ‘Gimme Some Truth,’ in which the lyrics appeared to include President Nixon. By then, Lennon had become a politically divisive figure, and “Gimme Some Truth” had become a rallying cry for anti-war protesters.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS AND LEGACY\n\nAt 1750 Vine Street in Hollywood, California, he was honored with a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Recording.\n\nIn 1987, John Lennon was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame along with Paul McCartney.\n\nThroughout his career as a performer and songwriter, he has had over 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart.\n\nThe Beatles won the Academy Award for Best Music (Original Song Score) for the documentary film “Let It Be” in 1970, and the Brit Award for Best British Group in 1977.\n\nHe also made significant contributions to people all over the world through his music, but also through fashion, hairstyles, and even clothing.\n\nCount your age by friends, not by years. Count your life by smiles, not years.\n\nJohn Lennon\n\nThrough his experimentation in the studio, he was able to contribute to recording techniques which are still applied in recording as of this date.\n\nLATER YEARS AND DEATH\n\nJohn Lennon took a break from his career in the mid-1970s to focus on his family and help raise his son.\n\nHe came out of retirement in October 1980 with the album ‘Double Fantasy.’\n\nOn December 8, 1980, a tragic event occurred that caused fans all over the world to mourn: John Lennon was shot by his fan, Mark David Chapman, whom he had autographed a copy of his album, Double Fantasy, earlier that night.\n\nHe was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital after being rushed there.\n\nJohn Lennon died on December 8, 1980, at the age of 40.\n\nHe was cremated two days after his death, and his memorial at Strawberry Fields is visited by thousands of people each and every year.\n\nJohn Lennon Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle that includes everything you need to know about John Lennon across 23 in-depth pages.
