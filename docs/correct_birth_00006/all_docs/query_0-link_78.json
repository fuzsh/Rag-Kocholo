        "text": "John Lennon\n\nProfession: Musician and Beatle\n\nBiography: Founding member of The Beatles, Lennon formed a songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney that became one of the most successful and famous in the history of music. Born in Liverpool, Lennon was in the group the Quarrymen which eventually developed into the Beatles in 1960.\n\nAs part of the best-selling group in music history, Lennon wrote or co-wrote many of the band's biggest hits. His rebellious nature gave his writings, interviews and work a notably acerbic and sardonic wit. After the group broke up in 1970, Lennon embarked on a successful solo career with his wife Yoko Ono. This included the hit 1971 single \"Imagine\".\n\nHis political activism, particularly in protesting against the Vietnam War, made him a controversial figure; the White House under Richard Nixon engaged in lengthy attempts to deport him.\n\nIn 1975 he withdrew from the music business to raise his son, Sean, but returned in 1980 to release the album Double Fantasy, with Yoko Ono. Three weeks after its release he was shot and killed by Mark David Chapman outside his Manhattan apartment. His death triggered an outpouring of grief on an unprecedented scale throughout the world.\n\nBorn: October 9, 1940\n\nBirthplace: Liverpool, United Kingdom\n\nGeneration: Silent Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Dragon\n\nStar Sign: Libra\n\nDied: December 8, 1980 (aged 40)\n\nCause of Death: Murdered\n\nArticles and Photos\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach, The Pop Chart Wizard!\n\nCelebrated for his choral and sacred music composed nearly 400 years ago, Johann Sebastian Bach has had surprising influence on modern pop charts.\n\nVoice Of The Century – 'And Not Even Close'\n\nFrank Sinatra cut his first disc on this day.
