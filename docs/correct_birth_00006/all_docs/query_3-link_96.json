        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nJohn Winston Lennon was born on this day in 1940. Lennon is one of the most famous and iconic musicians of all time, best-known as one of the members of the Beatles, for his subsequent solo career and for his political activism. Starting with 1967's \"All You Need Is Love\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement including \"Give Peace a Chance\", \"Instant Karma!\", \"Imagine\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\". John would have been 83 today had his life not been taken on December 8, 1980.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1961 - Ray Charles started a two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Hit The Road Jack.\"\n\n1964 - The Beach Boys recorded \"Dance Dance Dance,\" with Glen Campbell playing the lead-guitar intro. It would go on to become the Beach Boys' 12th Top 40 hit.\n\n1964 - Because of an anti-apartheid embargo by the British Musicians' union, the Rolling Stones cancelled a South African tour.\n\n1965 - The Beatles started a four-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with the Paul McCartney ballad 'Yesterday' giving the group their tenth U.S. No. 1. It was first released on the album Help! in August 1965, except in the United States, where it was issued as a single in September. With more than 2,200 cover versions, it is one of the most covered songs in the history of recorded music and was also voted the No. 1 pop song of all time by MTV and Rolling Stone magazine. In 1997, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\n1973 - Elvis Presley and Priscilla divorced after six years of marriage. Priscilla was awarded property, $725,000 cash and $4,200 a month support.\n\n1975 - Sean Taro Ono Lennon was born, the only child of John Lennon by Yoko Ono; John and Sean share the same birthday (John was 35 when Sean was born).

The contract was terminated three months later with the label stopping production of the 'Anarchy In The UK' single and deleting it from its catalogue. EMI later issued a statement saying it felt unable to promote The Sex Pistols records in view of the adverse publicity generated over the last few months.\n\n1978 - Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel died of cancer at age 49.
