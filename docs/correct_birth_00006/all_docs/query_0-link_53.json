This modest house is where many Beatles songs were born, making it a pilgrimage site for fans. It’s also officially labeled by the National Trust as the “birthplace of The Beatles.”\n\nWhere Ringo Starr lived in Liverpool\n\nStarr’s Liverpool address, 10 Admiral Grove, holds its own special place in Beatles history. This modest terraced house in the Dingle area was where Starr lived in his early years. Unlike Lennon and McCartney’s childhood homes, you can’t tour the inside. But Beatles fans can still stop by the outside of the house to see where the band’s legendary drummer started his journey.\n\nGeorge Harrison’s address in Liverpool\n\nHarrison’s Liverpool address, 12 Arnold Grove, is nestled in the quiet neighborhood of Wavertree. Similar to Starr’s childhood home, Harrison’s house is not officially open for public tours. However, Beatles fans often make it a point to visit the street. It’s a simple yet meaningful stop for those exploring The Beatles’ roots in Liverpool.\n\nWere The Beatles Liverpool or Everton fans? This has been a fun debate among fans.
