His father: Alfred Lennon. His mother: Julia Lennon (nee. Stanley). John was named after his grandfather and the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His father was not present at the birth as he was away as a merchant seaman during World War II.\n\nToday, a blue plaque outside the building reminds of the famous Liverpool born son."
