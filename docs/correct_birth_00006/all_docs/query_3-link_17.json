        "text": "John Winston Lennon (born; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1985) was an English singer, songwriter, musician, actor and peace activist who achieved worldwide fame as founder, co-songwriter, co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of The Beatles. Lennon's work was characterised by the rebellious nature and acerbic wit of his music, writing and drawings, on film, and in interviews. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history.\n\nBorn in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed The Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called \"the smart Beatle\", he was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon soon expanded his work into other media by participating in numerous films, including How I Won the War, and authoring In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with \"All You Need Is Love\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture of the 1960s. In 1969, with his second wife, the multimedia artist Yoko Ono, held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration Bed-ins for Peace, and left the Beatles to embark on a solo career.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Lennon and Ono collaborated on many works, several more films, his solo debut Untitled. Moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a five-year deportation attempt by the Nixon administration. Lennon and Ono separated from 1973 to 1977, during which time he re-joined The Beatles and remained until 1976, where he was put under house arrest for alleged marijuana position until 1977, during of which Lennon and Ono reunited. He was later released after an investigation found that the marijuana was planted by the Nixon administration and rejoined The Beatles. Following a four-year hiatus, Lennon and The Beatles reunited for Live Aid in 1985. Lennon died in his home in New York City, just 4 months into the recording sessions of Worlds Apart.\n\nAs a performer, writer or co-writer, Lennon had 36 number-one singles in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Worlds Apart, his posthumous Beatles album, won the 1987 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 1988, Lennon won the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC history poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer and 38th greatest artist of all time. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (in 1997) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice, as a member of The Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994).\n\nDiscography[]\n\nSee also: The Beatles discography\n\nWith George Harrison (as The Herons)[]"
