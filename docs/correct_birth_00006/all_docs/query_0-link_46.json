        "meta_description": "Step inside the lives of a young Lennon and McCartney with this combined escorted tour of Mendips and 20 Forthlin Road &ndash; the childhood homes of John and Paul. This is your opportunity to explore where the Fab Four met, composed and rehearsed many of their earliest songs; a real treat for any Beatles or Quarrymen fan! These two small houses in suburban Liverpool offer the only tour that takes you inside these unique and incredibly atmospheric buildings &ndash; you can practically hear the sounds of the lads, and almost picture their daily routines played out in front of you. &#39;Imagine&#39; walking through the back door into the kitchen where John&rsquo;s Aunt Mimi would have cooked him his tea, or standing in the spot where Lennon and McCartney composed &lsquo;I Saw Her Standing There&rsquo;. &nbsp;Join our custodians on a fascinating trip down memory lane, and take a moment to reflect on these incredible individuals. Mendips Lennon&rsquo;s childhood home and a fine example of 1950s semi-detached housing popular in this suburban area of Liverpool. You might note that it seems more &lsquo;luxurious&rsquo; than 20 Forthlin Road, mainly due to the loving maintenance of John&rsquo;s Aunt Mimi. You&rsquo;ll be able to experience the house and garden just as it was when they lived there; neat, tidy yet still cosy. 20 Forthlin Road Step inside a typical example of post-war terraced council housing, McCartney&rsquo;s childhood home is smaller than Lennon&rsquo;s. Money was tight; after Paul&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s tragic death, himself and his brother Mike were brought up solely by their father Jim. Expect to see mismatched wallpaper, clutter and threadbare sofas; just as it would have been during their time here. Take home memento of your incredible visit&nbsp;by purchasing a souvenir guidebook when booking your ticket. It will be ready to collect when you arrive, so you can take a little piece of your experience away with you. Booking a Tour The tour itself incorporates mini bus travel, which has limited capacity. If you are a wheelchair user, please call us to book and arrane your tour.&nbsp;For information on tour pick-ups, times and any extra information, please visit the tour FAQ&rsquo;s here. We recommend booking well in advance&nbsp;as tours sell out incredibly quickly. The tour is for&nbsp;all ages too, so no need to leave some of your friends of family behind &ndash; child tickets are available to purchase along with adult tickets, and places are free for under 5s &ndash; though you will still need to reserve a space for your little one.",
