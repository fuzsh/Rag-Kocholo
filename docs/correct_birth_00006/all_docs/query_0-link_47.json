        "text": "On 6 July 2024, Universal Music Group and The John Lennon Estate are thrilled to invite fans to Liverpool for a special treasure hunt in celebration of the upcoming release of John Lennon Mind Games (The Ultimate Collection).\n\nJohn Lennon’s Liverpool is a family-friendly event that will offer a unique experience into John’s hometown, kicking off at 9am at Liverpool Town Hall (High Street, Liverpool L2 3SW).\n\nJohn Lennon, widely regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of his generation. As the founder and leader of The Beatles and a solo artist, Lennon amassed seven GRAMMY Awards, including two Lifetime Achievement Awards, five BRIT Awards with two for Outstanding Contribution to Music, 21 NME Awards, 15 Ivor Novellos, and an Academy Award.\n\nHe has also been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and boasts a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIn 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him in the Top 5 on its “100 Greatest Singers Of All Time” list.\n\nThe Treasure Hunt\n\nUsing a specially created map of John Lennon’s Liverpool by fine artist Ed Fairburn, fans will explore locations across the city that hold special significance to Lennon. These locations, which will be revealed on the day, will feature hidden QR codes.\n\nParticipants can scan these codes using their phone cameras to uncover unique stories and earn points.\n\nHow to Participate:\n\nSign up at citizenofnutopia.com.\n\nStart your journey at Liverpool Town Hall.\n\nFollow the map to various key locations.\n\nScan QR codes to capture locations and earn points.\n\nParticipants will have the chance to win prizes based on the number of locations they capture. The grand prize, awarded to the first person to scan all the QR codes, is a Super Deluxe Mind Games (The Ultimate Collection) Box Set worth £1,350.\n\nJohn Lennon’s Liverpool & Yoko Ono’s Tokyo is made up of two 46-inch square gamified map artworks created by Ed Fairburn contain over 700 individually numbered locations, highlighted in ultra-violet ink.\n\nThese maps, depicting Liverpool from the 1940s and Tokyo from the 1930s, come with booklets detailing the historical significance of each location. They are available as part of the Super Deluxe Edition of John Lennon Mind Games (The Ultimate Collection).\n\nJohn Lennon: “Liverpool was a very poor city, and tough. But people have a sense of humour because they are in so much pain, so they are always cracking jokes. They are very witty, and it’s an Irish place.\n\n“It is where the Irish came when they ran out of potatoes, and it’s where black people were left or worked as slaves. And created communities. It’s cosmopolitan, and it’s where the sailors would come home with the blues records from America on the ships. We always talk about the Cavern and the dance halls in Liverpool, ’cause that’s when we were really hot musically.”\n\nYoko Ono: “The first place John took me to after we got together – guess where – was Liverpool! He was proud of the city he was born and grew up in. John had a very warm view of his past. He thought of Liverpool as a place that was incredibly wonderful. I didn’t hear that from many others at the time.\n\n“Some people who leave the city they were born in or grew up in say, ‘Thank God I left.’ But John always thought it was a great place and he loved it. In the last week of his life he was planning to go visit his England on the QE2. He wanted to go to Liverpool and show the city he was from to his son Sean.”\n\nPresented by Universal Music Group and the John Lennon Estate in association with Red And Grey Creative, this event is set to be a memorable celebration of John Lennon’s life and legacy."
