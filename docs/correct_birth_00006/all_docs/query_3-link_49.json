        "text": "John Lennon was one of the most remarkable songwriters and one of the famous Beatles, who left an incredible heritage and changed the world of rock music in the second half of the 20th century. Lennon was born in a poor family in Liverpool and started his musical career as one of the Liverpool phenomenon, The Beatles, alongside Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison. With the band, he managed to reach huge fame at quite early age, deliver hundreds of sensational live performances around the world, and record a dozen of brilliant albums. In 1970, when the band split, he started his solo career which he combined with plenty of political and social activism, spending time with his wife Yoko Ono and his little son Sean. Lennon's legacy includes such epic songs as \"Imagine\", \"Give Peace A Chance\", \"Instant Karma\", \"Working Class Hero\", and others. He is the author of some books and a creator of painting collections. In December 1980, John Lennon was shot dead by a crazy fan of his who had taken the autograph of Lennon just 5 hours before the murder."
