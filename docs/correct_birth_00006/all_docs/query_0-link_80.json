        "text": "Fifty years after the Beatles were at their zenith, I finally made a pilgrimage this year to the places sacred to their story. The crossing on Abbey Road in London. The childhood homes in Liverpool. Penny Lane and Strawberry Field.\n\nI loved it all, but the highlight of my visit to dank, misty Liverpool was surely meeting Colin Hanton, a gentlemanly but tart 79-year-old upholsterer who, six decades ago, played drums for the Quarrymen, the pre-Beatles band that included John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison.\n\nHe was a treat, not only for what he imparted about his teenage friends, but for what he conveyed about the city that shaped them.\n\nLike many Liverpudlians, Mr. Hanton is funny and self-effacing, deeply proud of his roots yet profoundly unimpressed with life’s ephemera. Though he was smack in the middle of the Beatles' formative experiences, he seemed peculiarly indifferent to their celebrity.\n\n“I never bought a Beatles album in my life,” he said — not even the best-selling \"Anthology 1,\" on which he plays. He loved their music, “but it’s weird you see, because they weren’t Beatles to me, they were just the lads. My mates. I wasn’t going to buy their records, was I?”\n\nWe rode over to Ringo Starr's boarded-up birthplace at 9 Madryn St., in the poor Dingle section.\n\nOne street over, abandoned terrace houses on both sides had been painted a grimy black for the TV series “Peaky Blinders.” Mr. Hanton, with a burst of Liverpudlian pride, denied it would have looked like that a century ago. “All those steps would have been scrubbed on a daily basis,\" he insisted.\n\nThe Beatles grew up in a Liverpool that had been pounded by Hitler’s Luftwaffe, leaving craters and smashed buildings. Here, the concept of a teenager took root — the idea that kids deserve to have fun.\n\n“My dad was a copy of his dad. Come 14, you put a suit on and went to work. There was no such thing as a teenager,” Mr. Hanton said. But after the war, “perhaps even the adults had had enough of authority. They had six years of a sergeant major screaming at them. I think they relaxed slightly.”\n\nColin invested his money as a teen in two pairs of socks — fluorescent pink and fluorescent lime green — and a drum kit. A friend invited him to join a group he and John Lennon had formed.\n\n“When I first met John he was quite reserved,\" wary of strangers, worried they might be \"a threat to him.\"\n\nHis fondest memory of John Lennon? Not playing rock 'n' roll. Rather, Mr. Hanton recalled John's excited invitation to join him on a visit with his mom Julia. John was living with his stern, strict aunt, Mimi, rather than with his lively, often irresponsible mother, who had borne children from multiple fathers, in and out of wedlock.\n\nThe boys loved her. She was the one adult they knew who owned an Elvis Presley record, and she did not scold them if they skipped school. But Julia was struck and killed by a car outside Aunt Mimi’s home in 1958 — something that surely bonded John with Paul McCartney, who had already lost his mother to cancer.\n\nWe rode on to St. Peter’s Church Hall, the place where, legend holds, John first met Paul after an afternoon performance by the Quarrymen at a church fete. Sir Paul (McCartney) recalls impressing John there with a rendition of Eddie Cochran’s “Twenty-Flight Rock.” But Colin distinctly remembers a less dramatic meeting earlier in the day, in the field outside the church.\n\n“I saw John talking to [a friend named] Ivan Vaughn and another guy I didn’t know, which turned out later to be Paul.” Mr. Hanton postulated that people are wont to fill in the blanks in their memory with drama. “There was no big arrow saying, ‘This is Paul! Remember this!'”\n\nWe walked across the street in the rain to the churchyard, to look at the gravestone of John Rigby’s family, with a better-known name engraved in smaller letters partway down: Eleanor Rigby.\n\nEdward Achorn (eachorn@providencejournal.com) is the editorial pages editor of The Providence Journal.\n\nThis piece has been updated to correct the address of Ringo Starr's birthplace."
