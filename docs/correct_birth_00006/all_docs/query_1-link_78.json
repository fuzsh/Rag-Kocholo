John Legend beat up DJ and friend Bob Wheeler for poking him and making fun of him and Brian(Beatle's Manager), saying that they had an homosexual encounter.\n\n2. He has admitted to domestic violence against his first wife Cynthia.\n\n3. When he made the comment that 'The Beatles are more popular than Jesus', although the comment went unnoticed in UK, there was a big protest in the US and people burnt their records and their was Ku Klux Klan activity.\n\n4. John Lennon was murdered in the archway of his residence 'The Dacota', New York City. He was shot at five times in his back, but Mark David Chapman missed one shot. It is unbelievably shocking how far can Cognitive Dissonance push a person. So far that a clash of thoughts can make someone shoot another person. This is all that went wrong with Mark David Chapman, in addition to his frustration because of his own incompetency to achieve what John Lennon did.\n\nHe was angry at John Lennon because of his statement, \"Beatles are more popular than Jesus\". He was also furious because John Lennon said that he does not believe in Jesus and Beatles. Chapman did not understand the concept of liberation, just like Holden confused the phrase \"Catcher in the rye\"; the book that he was carrying with himself at the time he shot John Lennon. The character Holden goes all dark after going for ice skating to the Rockefellar Centre. Chapman said, 'Who does he think he is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?'\n\nChapman was imprisoned for 20 years and denied bail 8 times with psychological help in the jail. Lennon arrived dead in the Roosevelte Hospital at 11:15 PM. Lennon had autographed a copy of Double Fantasy for his murderer Mark David Chapman.\n\nBoys, Affairs and MoreMarital StatusStayed married to Yoko Ono till death\n\nChildrenJulian Lennon (Musician)\n\nSean Lennon (Singer)\n\nAffairs/BoyfriendsAlma Cogan\n\nHusband/SpouseCynthia Powell (m. 1962; div. 1968)\n\nYoko Ono (m. 1969â80; his death)\n\nMoney FactorNet WorthWas $800 millionHouseTittenhurst Park\n\nKenwood (Â£20,000)\n\nSurrey HouseCarsPsychedelic Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Ferrari\n\nSome Lesser Known Facts About John Lennon\n\nDid John Lennon Smoke?: Yes\n\nDid John Legend drink alcohol?: Yes\n\nAs a teenager, John Lennon got crazy about Skiffle music (music made with homemade or improvised instruments).\n\nJohn Lennon was the founder of the band The Beatles. He was a member of the band The Quarryman when he was a teenager and the same band turned out to be The Beatles. Their first song of The Beatles was the song âThatâll be the dayâ from the band The Quaryman.\n\nThe reason disbandment of the Band was the death of Brian Epstein. He died of a medical overdose. He was the promoter and the anchor of the band as he took the band to international audience and solved the conflicts of the band. John was very close to him and left after Paul McCartney took control and became over-empowering.\n\nHe was named after his grandfather âJohn Jack Lennonâ and the president âWinston Churchillâ. Hence his full name â âJohn Winston Lennonâ\n\nHis father was normally away but would send checks for his mother and John. The checks stopped once and his father went AWOL. When Alfred Lennon came back six months later to take care of the family, Johnâs mother rejected the idea because she was already pregnant with some other manâs child.\n\nSister of Johnâs mother, Mimi took Lennonâs custody after reporting to the local social services. His father tried to take him away to New Zealand but got chased by Lennonâs wife and her partner. At the age of 5, John chose to be his father twice but went to his mother crying when she walked away.\n\nLennon was raised by his maternal aunt and her husband, who didnât have a kid of their own. His mother Julia would visit him often.\n\nHis aunt used to play the song âIsnât that a shameâ which John learned and his uncle bought him a mouth-organ and banjo.\n\nHe always was a bad-mouthed poet and musician and in his childhood. He was one of those kids that the parents ask their kids to stay away from. He was raised by five sisters, his mother being the youngest one. He said parents are not God because he has survived without them.\n\nJohn used to draw comic cartoons that were published in the school magazine âThe Daily Howlâ.\n\nHis school reports, generally, would have remarks like âCertainly on the road to failure â¦ hopeless â¦ rather a clown in class â¦ wasting other pupilsâ time.â\n\nHis mother bought him the first guitar and had it delivered at her own place, instead of Mimiâs because Mimi was not supportive of his musical career because she though heâll never be able to make a living out of it.\n\nLennon was never good at studies. Failed all his O-level exams and was allowed admission in college with help of his aunt and headmaster. Despite the help of a student and girl Cynthia Powell, who he married later on, he failed the final exam.\n\nLennon met Paul McCartney during the second performance of the band The Quarryman. Mimi was always insulting Paul for being from a lower class and Paulâs father always thought of John as a bad influence. Although he later allowed them to practice at his place.\n\nInitially, John didnât âexactlyâ welcome the idea of dressing formally as the band manager Brian Epstein suggested but later he said, âIâll wear a bloody balloon if somebodyâs going to pay me.â\n\nAlthough John himself wasnât very happy with the lyrics and called them irrelevant and written just to create sound, his band members idolized him and stated, âHe was like our own little Elvisâ¦ We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest.â\n\nDuring the Royal Variety Show, in the presence of the Queen and other royalties, John Lennon, being himself came up with â âFor our next song, Iâd like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands â¦ and the rest of you, if youâll just rattle your jewellery.â\n\nHe said that his song âHelp!â was him actually asking for help as it was his âFat Elvisâ period.\n\nLennon was close to loosing his sense of self-identity because of regular use of LSD. Although his creativity enhanced and the Time magazine said that the song Strawberry Fields had âastonishing inventivenessâ.\n\nJohn attended Maharishi Mahesh Yogiâs âTranscendental Meditationâ camp in Bangor, Wales and then also went to his ashram in India. The band manager died during that time and they wrote most of the songs for Beatles and Abbey Road while they were there.\n\nJohn Lennon appeared in a dark comedy How I won the War â the only non-Beatles movie he ever did.\n\nJohn wanted his wife Cynthia to like an actress he liked and when she cut her hair short, he didnât talk to her for two days!\n\nThe Beatles formed a production company called Apple Corp for artistic freedom but faced problems due to personal commitments and lack of organisational skills. The Beatles approached several different managers but only Allen Klein (The former manager of The Rolling Stones) agreed to be their bandâs manager but Paul McCartney never signed the contract to hire him.\n\nJohn was furious about Paulâs announcement of him leaving the band on releasing his solo album when John had left the band but didnât make it public because there were still negotiations going on.\n\nThe critic Greil Marcus said, âJohnâs singing in the last verse of âGodâ may be the finest in all of rock.â\n\nLennon wrote the song âHow do you sleep?â in answer to his song âRamâ. Paul agreed that he had directed the lyrics towards Lennon and Ono. John later said that he just used the situation to write a song relating it to himself.\n\nJohn Lennon and his wife Ono called their honeymoon Bed-in Peace and used it for bringing awareness and peace. He wrote the song Give Peace a Chance during that time. The song was adopted as the anti-war song during the Vietnam War.\n\nThere were attempts to deport Lennon from San Diago as Nixon thought that Lennonâs anti-war songs can cost him re-election.\n\nThe US embassy was also started the deportation process for Lennon and barring his entry because he was found to possess marijuana in London.\n\nEnthralled by his rebellion, he was asked to leave the US within 60 days.\n\nProving John Lennon right, Nixon was found guilty in the Watergate scandal and was asked to resign from the post after 14 months.\n\nJon Weiner filed a case against the FBI for its involvement in the deportation of John Lennon. Weiner partially won the case under the influence of Bill Clinton the report was released except 10 pages. The story is told in The US vs John Lennon documentary.\n\nJohn was playing the mouth organ on a bus when the driver heard him and was impressed. He asked John to come to the depot and collect an unclaimed harmonica which replaced his childhood toy.\n\nLennon knew how to play mouth-organ, different kinds of guitars and Piano too.\n\nHe was always insecure about his voice and asked for editing if it cracked or didnât come out the way John wanted it.\n\nHis song âImagineâ was announced by BBC to be the best lyrical piece of art.\n\nHis statue is erected in front of the Cavern Club, Liverpool.\n\nJohnâs solo and collaboration work won him 25 number one singles on US Hot 100 and a Grammy Award for The Album of the Year for his album Double Fantasy. He was also honored with the BRIT Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.\n\nAfter his separation with his father at the age of five, he met him after 20 years at the time when his manager Brian Springsteen died.\n\nJohnâs body was cremated, not buried.\n\nLennon and Yoko had a psychic on board who was paid as good as their lawyers and accountants.\n\nThe first time Lennon had LSD when his dentist slipped it into his coffee.\n\nJohn asked Yoko to make a list of all the people she has slept with.\n\nFed up with the kind of performances The Beatles did, john said, âBeatles concerts are nothing to do with music any more. Theyâre just bloody tribal rites.â\n\nJohn had said that âYou have to be a bastard to make it, and thatâs a fact. And the Beatles were the biggest bastards on earth.â\n\nLennon started loving to cook in his later years and used to prepare food for his staff of around twelve members.\n\nJohn Lennon nick named his album Rubber Soul as âThe Pot Albumâ and Revolver as âAcid Albumâ.\n\nWhile in college, Lennon punched a guy because he asked Johnâs then lady love Cynthia Powell to dance with him.\n\nWhen Yoko was pregnant, John lied on the bed next to her and held her hand.\n\nThe most of the time that Lennon spent with his first wife Cynthia was on the weekends, when he would try to turn her on to LCD and termed it as âOperation Cynthiaâ.\n\nLennon explained his relationship with Yoko as nascent and stated, âThis is different from anything before. This is more than a hit record. Itâs more than gold. Itâs more than anything.â\n\nHis father used to be the mascot for his schoolâs Soccer Team.\n\nWhen Lennon was about to leave Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Yogi asked him that why is he leaving soon, John replied saying, âWell, if you are so cosmic, you should know whyâ.\n\nJohn turned the guitar into a sort of banjo by taking two strings off the guitar and then Paul showed him how to play six-stringer.\n\nIn the early days of Beatlesâ performances, just for fun, Lennon used to sing the songs in a humorous German, French, or Mexican accents.\n\nThe judge J. Edgar Hoover, in the FBI trials, read all of Johnâs lyrics and watched all the videos to find a reason to get rid of him and deport him from the US.\n\nThe Beatlesâ producer once said that Lennon was âa completely impractical manâ.\n\nJohn was embarrassed of wearing glasses and would go on without wearing them even if had to be half-blind. Thanks to Buddy Holly that he asked his aunt to get him a pair. He was also found dyslexic later on.\n\nHe did not choose acting as a career because it is more binding on a person than being a singer.\n\nJohn and Cynthiaâs marriage started to fall apart when he started consuming heavier amounts of LSD.\n\nSoon as he got his driverâs license, several car dealers parked their cars outside Lennonâs house as samples hoping that he would but their brand.\n\nLennon got canned in The Sunday School for calling Scribes and Pharisees in the Bible âFascists.â\n\nWhile he was in his yacht in The Bermuda Triangle, he survived the 65 mph windy storm with 20 feet high waves!\n\nThe Beatles were honored with the Most Excellence Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. However, John Lennon returned the medal saying â âYour Majesty, I am returning my MBE as a protest against Britainâs involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing, against our support of America in Vietnam and against âCold Turkeyâ slipping down the charts. With love. John Lennon.â\n\nLennon accepted of abuse with his first wife and accepted in an interview with Playboy saying â âI used to be cruel to my woman, and physically â any woman. I was a hitter. I couldnât express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace, you see. It is the most violent people who go for love and peace.â\n\nOff the Ireland coast, Lennon bought an island called the Dornish Island where he invited Hippies to establish a community. After thriving there for two years, a fire destroyed most of their property.\n\nLennonâs psychedelic car was sold at $2.3 million which he gave away for $230,000 to settle a tax bill.\n\nHe was the only Beatle who did not turn vegetarian.\n\nJohn liked sleeping in a coffin that was placed in a cafe.\n\nNasir Khan (Johnny Walkerâs son) Height, Weight, Age, Wife, Biography & More\n\nBadri Seshadri Age, Wife, Family, Biography & More\n\nPraveen Tokas (Fitness Trainer) Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Biography & More\n\nPrakash Raj Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More\n\nCarl Eiswerth Death, Height, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More\n\nArya (Actor) Height, Weight, Age, Wife, Affairs, Biography & More\n\nKaustav Bauri (NEET 2023 AIR 3) Age, Caste, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More\n\nNaresh Agarwal (Politician) Age, Wife, Controversies, Family, Biography & More\n\nncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FtMHNn6alnJWZe6S7zGihqKCeYrmmus2opWg%3D\n\n← Previous Post\n\nNext Post →"
