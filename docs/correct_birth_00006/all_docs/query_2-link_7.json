        "text": "The first home of John Lennon, The Beatles' singer, songwriter and guitarist, and one of the 20th century most respected musical figures, is found in the eastern suburb of Wavertree. 9 Newcastle Road, a red brick terraced house, is located just a fifteen minute walk from George Harrison’s childhood home on Arnold Grove. Lennon was not born at the house, but at the Liverpool Maternity Hospital, in October 1940. He lived here only as a very young child; his parents, Alfred and Julia Lennon, moved to another home in the city in 1942.\n\nJohn Lennon, the first and only child of his parents, suffered a difficult upbringing from his very first days at 9 Newcastle Road. His father was a merchant seaman, frequently away from home, and his mother Julia struggled to cope when he was absent, cutting the supply of pay cheques to the family home. Lennon’s aunt, Mimi Smith, ultimately raised concerns with the local Social Services department and, eventually, Lennon went to live with her and his uncle at the Mendips, a semi-detached suburban house he saw as his permanent childhood home. Lennon praised the role of his aunt and mother in his upbringing, and many consider his troubled mother to be one of the greatest influences on his work.\n\nBeatles Tour in Liverpool, Part III\n\nNow that you have been to a good number of spots around Liverpool associated with The Beatles, it is high time to explore the “early days” of the Fab Four in their hometown and see where it all started.\n\nOne such place is Strawberry Field, immortalized in their song \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\" It was a Salvation Army children's home, and although the original building no... view more\n\nTour Duration: 2 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 5.3 Km or 3.3 Miles\n\nLiverpool Historical Sites Walking Tour\n\nFor a city steeped in history and culture as much as Liverpool, it is only natural to have many historical sites illustrative of its glorious past.
