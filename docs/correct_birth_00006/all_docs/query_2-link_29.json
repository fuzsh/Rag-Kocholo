        "text": "John Lennon, a member of the Beatles, was born on October 9, 1940, in Liverpool, England. With the Beatles and as a solo artist, Lennon was hugely influential musically, culturally, and politically throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Lennon wrote and recorded many songs over the course of his career, including the antiwar song \"Give Peace a Chance.\" He was murdered by a crazed fan on December 8, 1980, in New York City.\n\nJohn Lennon is well known for many songs; however, his most famous song is probably \"Imagine,\" in which he asks his listeners to consider a world without war and violence. After listening to the song or reading the lyrics, ask students to discuss the following questions, depending upon their grade and skill level:\n\nThe speaker refers to himself as a \"dreamer.\" What other words would you use to describe the speaker?\n\nIs the world that the speaker imagines possible? What prevents peace from happening? What can be done to try to make it happen? How has September 11 changed your feelings about world peace?\n\nWrite a stanza of your own for the song that begins with the phrase \"Imagine...\" Draw a picture below your stanza to illustrate the world you have imagined."
