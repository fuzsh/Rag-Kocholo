        "text": "Assignment In what way did John Lennon's political beliefs, expressed in so many of his songs and in his public protests, affect and influence the music and politics of his generation? Background John Lennon was born on October 9, 1940 in Liverpool, England and later became one of the most famous singers and musicians of this century. He was known not only for his musical talents with the Beatles and his later solo career but also for his controversial political beliefs and public protests. His second marriage to Yoko Ono in 1969, as well as his persistent drug habit, brought the many faces and attitudes of Lennon to the surface. Some even blame his marriage to Yoko for the eventual split of the Beatles. The Beatles took the world by storm with their influential rock and roll style and powerful musical performances. Lennon was one of the group's leading figures and often took the role of lead vocalist as well as writer of many of the songs, with the help of his friend, Paul McCartney. John and Paul met during the fifties and along with George Harrison formed a group called the Quarrymen. The group went through many changes before becoming the Beatles. The group started its musical career playing in local clubs and pubs in Liverpool, and it was in one of these clubs that the Beatles were discovered by Brian Epstien (who had surprisingly very little experience in the music business) in the early sixties. This led to the first record deal with Decca and later EMI. Ringo Starr was last to join the group after meeting them in Hamburg in 1960, where he was playing with his band, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Through their great music and influential style, the Beatles became more popular, touring around Europe and eventually to the United States, where their music was taking the rock and roll scene by storm. In the eyes of their fans, the Beatles could do no wrong. Nearly all off their songs became hits. By the time they reached America in 1964, over two million copies of the song, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" had been sold. Their continuing success took them into the film industry. The films Hard Day's Night, Help! and Let it be were all a new direction for the Beatles. Unfortunately, their film debuts were met with much criticism, with the latter of the films showing clear signs of a breakdown in communication within the band. The band began to experience the strains of fame. Tensions grew within the band, and Paul and John often voiced differing opinions that resulted in conflicts. Such conflicts and strains led to the eventual split of the famous group in 1969. Their last memorable performance together took place on the roof of their headquarters on Savile Row in London. The break up of the Beatles was devastating for the fans, but both Paul and John went on to pursue successful solo careers. John was a controversial figure for most of his ensuing solo career. Yoko and he staged many \"bed-ins\" in protest against violence and war, and John became a spokesperson for the peace movement in his actions as well as in his music, producing some of his best work in the late seventies. Unfortunately John's life was taken from him on December 1980, when he was shot by Mark Chapman.
