        "text": "By the time he was six Lennon’s father Alf was back on the scene, after spells at sea during the Second World War. He had missed his son’s birth. In 1946 he took Lennon from Mimi’s to a friend’s house in Blackpool. That trip would bring about one of the most formative experiences of Lennon’s life.\n\nThe apocryphal account, now thought to be exaggerated by Beatles scholars, is that Lennon was asked to choose between staying with his father and possibly emigrating, or returning to Liverpool to live with his mother. Lennon, the story goes, chose his father initially but changed his mind after seeing how upset it had made Julia.\n\nWe will never know exactly what happened in Blackpool, but Lennon carried the anguish for decades. Julia took him back to Liverpool but he was dropped straight back to Aunt Mimi’s, where he would continue to live. He would not see his father again until he was one of the most famous people in the world.\n\nLennon at 20\n\nOn 9 October 1960 Lennon celebrated his 20th birthday in Hamburg as a Beatle. His band were playing their sixth night of 56 at the Kaiserkeller club with its original line-up of Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe on bass and drummer Pete Best.\n\nThe group had come together bit by bit after a happier formative moment for Lennon, hearing Elvis Presley for the first time in 1956. When he discovered Little Richard months later he felt so overcome he was unable to speak. But it was the short-lived skiffle boom which inspired his first group, the Quarry Men, named after the Quarry Bank secondary school he attended. By July 1957 his band was playing at a church fete, where he would meet McCartney for the first time. Two months later at Liverpool College of Art he became friends with Sutcliffe.\n\nLennon remained a one-off. Beatles biographer Mark Lewisohn describes a 1957 recording of the Quarry Men in his essential book Tune In: “It is unmistakably John Lennon… Singers always start off as impersonators, mimicking whoever made the record they’re performing, some perhaps going on to develop their own voice. That John Lennon… was so audibly himself, is the mark of a true original.”\n\nBetween the ages of 10 and 20 Lennon continued to create, producing his own newspaper the Daily Howl. He wrote his first songs. He was short-sighted to the point where he couldn’t see crowds in front of a stage, but seldom wore his specs in public until the mid 1960s. Darker traits had also started to emerge. He had developed a lingering macabre interest in deformities. He became a voracious drinker and enthusiastic drug taker, using the appetite suppressant Preludin for its stimulant qualities to power punishingly long sets in Hamburg. He had also hit women, at least twice, including art school girlfriends Thelma Pickles and Cynthia Powell. He would admit as much in interviews and lyrics in the years to follow.\n\nGrief was never far away. The death of his stand-in father figure, Mimi’s husband George, was devastating. Not least because Lennon had been sent away, unaware George was ill. By the time he returned the funeral had already happened.\n\nHe had become closer to his mother Julia, occasionally staying with her but never as a permanent arrangement. She taught him how to play banjo, his gateway to the guitar. She was killed in July 1958, hit by a car outside Mimi’s house after visiting her son. Lennon believed it was driven by a drunk off-duty policeman, cementing an anti-authoritarian streak which would last his whole life. “Liverpool is a very odd place because there is a genuine culture of disrespect for authority,” says Dr Mike Jones, senior lecturer in music at the University of Liverpool, “and Lennon had that in spades.”\n\nHis mother’s death left understandably deep scars for Lennon, aged 17 when it happened. “He was a boy at 17,” says Lesley-Ann Jones. “And I think he actually never grew up, he remained a boy-man, a late teenage delinquent for the rest of his life. And that has to relate back to the fact that he was deprived of his mother so young, you always have to cling to somebody.\n\n“The most appalling thing about that was he stayed in that bedroom [at Mimi’s], and he had to draw the curtains, every single day on that spot she was killed. His way of dealing with it was to get angry and to blame everybody else.”\n\nThe Beatles’ first of five Hamburg residencies finished in December 1960. Lennon returned home to Liverpool on 10 December, unsure of his future with the Beatles, and unaware he had less than half of his life left.\n\nWas Hamburg the making of him as a musician? “Absolutely, also as a performer and as a personality,” says Dr Mike Jones. “John Lennon’s personality is quite challenging, anybody who interacted with him will say he was difficult to be around. He’s a very upset, very angry person.\n\n“What Hamburg does, because the conditions are so extreme, playing for hours in a tough place in front of a tough audience, it allowed him to vent a lot of his anger. It created him a persona.”\n\nOn return to Liverpool, the chastening experience of Hamburg left him doubting his self-defined destiny as a musician. “I was always a sort of poet or painter and I thought, ‘Is this it?’,” Lennon later said, as recalled in the Beatles Anthology book. “Nightclubs and seedy scenes, being deported, and weird people in clubs? Nowadays they call it decadence but those days it was just in Hamburg, in clubs that groups played at, strip clubs. I thought hard about whether I should continue.”\n\nBut things began to fall into place quickly for the Beatles once back in Liverpool. They built a loyal audience around Merseyside, making their first appearance at the Cavern in February 1961. Sometimes their crowds would scream at them. Hamburg beckoned again by 27 March, where the band spent 92 nights at the Top Ten club, putting in hundreds of hours on stage. They were recorded as the backing band for singer Tony Sheridan on a single that June.\n\nOnce back in Liverpool, Lennon again had doubts about continuing, fearing the band had plateaued. For his 21st birthday he hitchhiked to Paris with Paul McCartney, where Hamburg pal Jürgen Vollmer gave them both brushed-forward hairstyles known then as the ‘exi’, after ‘existentialist’. The world would know it as a mop top.\n\nYoko Ono rescued him. He was besotted with his new wife, calling her “mother” and spending their honeymoon preaching about peace on a world tour of hotel beds. “Cynthia said to me that she had a very strong sense that John didn’t actually care whether he lived or died,” says Lesley-Ann Jones. “He had no respect for his own life at all. And that made her want to mother him.\n\n“Yoko isn’t fake. She was a guru to him in so many ways because she managed to change his opinion about children, spirituality, feminism, world disease, and to think more widely, to broaden his reach. She turned him around. I think he would have died a lot sooner having not met her.”\n\nYoko had a child from a previous marriage, Kyoko, but suffered a miscarriage when pregnant with Lennon’s child. In September 1971 they moved to America, never to return to England.\n\nThe month before his 31st birthday Lennon released his second solo album, Imagine. Its title song is undoubtedly the solo work for which he is most remembered. “There’s lots of things that you can accuse Lennon of and quite rarely is hypocrisy one of them,” says Jack Pelling, co-host of the Beatles podcast Your Own Personal Beatles. “But I think singing ‘imagine no possessions’ in your massive mansion on an ivory-white piano, it’s not going to do you any major favours.\n\n“I wouldn’t suggest that it wasn’t completely heartfelt but maybe it was just a phase that didn’t stick around too long.”\n\nMaintaining the serene mood of that song would not be easy for Lennon in the next decade\n\n“I think John Lennon to the man on the street is the caricature of who he was as a Beatle,” says Jack Pelling. “He’s the Lennon of an era, which is the glasses, the long hair, the bed-in period. I think when you close your eyes and think of John Lennon you think of that doodle that he drew of himself. It was pretty much his intention of how he tried to turn himself into more of a symbol, that sort of iconography is very self-styled.”\n\nHe is not entirely flattered by the film. He mugs to the camera at one point using the ‘cripple’ face which he adopted with unfortunate regularity during the Beatles’ career. It’s hard to envisage such a moment making the cut today.\n\nBy 1989 the Beatles’ ancient legal disputes were on the way to being settled. This meant their catalogue could now be fully re-promoted for the first time. Sanitised, sanctified and commercialised, Lennon was ready to be re-sold to the world."
