        "text": "Vintage Beatles concert ticket: Odeon, Lewisham, Dec. 8, 1963\n\nPaul McCartney adding 'One Hand Clapping' 'Backyard Sessions' to Digital Platforms\n\nVia Paul's camp: During a break in the One Hand Clapping sessions, Paul went into the garden behind Studio 2 and was filmed performing what would come to be The Backyard Session. One Hand Clapping - The Backyard includes the unreleased track ‘Blackpool’, The Beatles’ iconic ‘Blackbird’, Wings B-side ‘Country Dreamer’, and cover versions of Eddie Cochran’s ‘Twenty Flight Rock’ (the first song Paul played to John Lennon when they met in 1957), Buddy Holly’s ‘Peggy Sue’ and’ I’m Gonna Love You Too’. The tracks will be on Spotify and Apple Music tomorrow . The 2-LP special edition of One Hand Clapping includes these extra tracks on a 7-inch EP but they are not on the standard vinyl or CD releases of the album. Like the rest of One Hand Clapping , they've circulated on bootlegs for a zillion years. A video of Paul performing \"Blackpool\" from the session also will debut on YouTube tomorrow. Here (maybe, if it's not taken down) is an unofficial video of the entire Back\n\nRingo Guests on New Album from 10cc's Graham Gouldman - Listen\n\nSuper Deluxe Edition interviews Graham Gouldman about his new album, I Have Notes , which includes guest appearances by Ringo, Brian May, Hank Marvin, Albert Lee and Beth Nielsen Chapman. Relevant portion, plus the tune below: Ringo Starr plays on ‘Couldn’t Love You More’, which has a real late-period Beatles sound… I wrote that song with Phil Thornalley – him and I go way back. He produced the first album that I made with the late, great Andrew Gold, as Wax. I’d started this song, and it was so blatantly Beatles… I said, ‘There’s only one person… we’ve got to ask Ringo to play on it…’ I’m very happy that he did. Did he come to the UK to do it? No – he did it at his studio in Los Angeles.\n\nRecording Engineer Ken Scott Shares Stories about Working with the Beatles, Along with Strong Opinions about 'Now and Then'\n\nKen Scott, in orange shirt, with Paul, George and George. Headliner Magazine has a lengthy new interview with recording engineer Ken Scott with quite a bit of info about his work with The Beatles. Scott also mentions that he's not a great fan of the \"final\" Beatles single, \"Now and Then\": I know that George was not particularly fond of finishing [\"Now and Then\"] back in the day. To me, it's kind of milking a dead cow. It's putting something together to sell more records, kind of thing. It's that, ‘If there are differences between the mono and stereo, we may be able to sell twice as many records; If we put out a new single that we put together, it doesn't matter if it's not quite as good as our old stuff, but it will boost the interest again, so maybe we'll sell more records’. \"I almost get that feeling, and it could be I could be completely wrong,” he says, holding up his hands.”But that's what turns me against it.”"
