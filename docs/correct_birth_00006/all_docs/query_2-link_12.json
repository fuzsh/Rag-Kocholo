        "text": "(1940–80). During his career with the Beatles, and later as a solo performer, John Lennon wrote and sang some of the most enduring songs of the 20th century. His impact on music and culture in the 1960s was immeasurable and continued well beyond his murder at age 40 by a crazed fan.\n\nJohn Winston Lennon was born into a troubled household on Oct. 9, 1940, in Liverpool, England. When the child was 3, his father left home; soon thereafter, Lennon’s mother Julia found herself unable to care for the boy, and he was sent to live with an aunt in the Liverpool suburb of Woolton. Although he continued to see his mother frequently, the separation had a strong impact on the sensitive boy. In 1957, Lennon’s mother was killed when an automobile struck her while she stood outside his aunt’s home. The teenager witnessed the accident, which was to haunt him for the rest of his life.\n\nBright but increasingly bored at school, Lennon grew into a rebellious teenager, cutting class frequently and spending his time drawing and writing stories. His gift for drawing, which later led him to enroll in art school, was accompanied by a strong interest in music, particularly recordings by American rock and roll artists such as Gene Vincent. Lennon received his first guitar from his aunt while in his early teens and taught himself to play. At 15 he formed his first band, a skiffle group called the Quarrymen that later included fellow teenagers Paul McCartney and George Harrison. Over the next few years, the band evolved, adding members and changing names. Lennon and McCartney began to write songs together. In 1962 the band—having added drummer Ringo Starr to their lineup—recorded their first single, a Lennon-McCartney composition called “Love Me Do.” The record was an immediate hit in England, and within a year the band’s recordings were receiving airplay on U.S. radio stations.\n\nIn 1964 the band traveled to the United States to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show, generating among their fans the hysteria that came to be called Beatlemania. Lennon’s quick mind and sarcastic wit was a highlight of the band’s first film, A Hard Day’s Night (1964), and soon earned him the nickname of The Smart Beatle. A book of his drawings and stories, In His Own Write (1964), was published to critical acclaim. Over the next two years, the band’s mass appeal continued unabated, prompting Lennon to remark to a reporter in 1966 that the band was more popular than Jesus Christ. The controversial statement generated a backlash that led to their records being banned in some towns. Lennon later apologized for the statement.\n\nDrained by the demands of live performances, the Beatles stopped touring in 1966, choosing to focus on studio work, though Lennon took time off from recording to appear in the film How I Won the War (1967).\n\nLennon was the only married member of the group at the onset of Beatlemania in 1964; in 1962 he had married Cynthia Powell, with whom he had a son, Julian. By 1968 Lennon had divorced Powell, having begun an association with Japanese artist Yoko Ono, whom he had first met in an art gallery in 1966. Ono’s avant-garde films and art installations fascinated Lennon, and soon they were collaborating on experimental recordings such as Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins (1968), which featured a cover photograph of Lennon and Ono in the nude. At Lennon’s insistence, Ono began attending all of the Beatles’ rehearsals and recording sessions, an intrusion that drove a wedge into Lennon’s relationship with his bandmates, particularly McCartney.\n\nLennon and Ono married in 1969 and continued to generate publicity by staging events that intrigued, amused, and annoyed Beatle fans. Increasingly vocal in their opposition to the Vietnam War, the couple used their honeymoon in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, as a protest statement, spending the week in bed and inviting reporters to discuss the probability of world peace. In 1970, the Beatles announced that they had broken up, and while fans blamed Ono for the band’s demise, Lennon steadfastly insisted that the group had simply run its course.\n\nIn 1971, Lennon and Ono moved to New York City and continued to collaborate on musical projects. Lennon’s public statements regarding politics and war came under suspicion from the Nixon administration, who saw his popularity with youth as a security threat. The government began deportation proceedings, using a drug arrest from years past as the legal basis for denying him residency. Lennon eventually won the case and was allowed to remain in the United States. He continued his recording career with several albums, notably Mind Games (1973), Walls and Bridges (1974), and Rock ’n’ Roll (1975), though his greatest solo success was the title song from his second album, Imagine (1971). At the end of the 20th century the song was voted in some polls as the one of the greatest pop songs of all time.\n\nIn 1973 Lennon and Ono separated for 18 months, during which time Lennon moved to Los Angeles, Calif. In 1974 Lennon made what would be his last public performance, as a surprise guest at an Elton John concert in New York City. Having reconciled with Ono by 1975, Lennon retired to their home in the Dakota apartments in New York, staying out of the spotlight to focus on raising their son Sean, who was born on Lennon’s 35th birthday.\n\nIn late 1980 Lennon and Ono returned to the music world with a joint effort, Double Fantasy. The collection of songs was greeted with critical praise and commercial success, and Lennon’s comeback seemed assured. On Dec. 8, 1980, Lennon and Ono were returning home from a recording session when he was shot in front of his home by a deranged fan. Although Lennon was rushed immediately to a nearby hospital, within an hour he was dead. The fan was later convicted of murder."
