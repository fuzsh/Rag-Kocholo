        "text": "1939\n\nCity Locations\n\nMonument Valley, AZ\n\nLocation Types\n\nFilm Studio\n\nLocation Styles\n\nAmericana/Anywhere, Colonial, Building Dated/Retro, Georgian/Southern, Southwestern, Rustic\n\nAbout Stagecoach\n\nUnfolding amidst the rough and rugged times of the 1880s, Stagecoach (1939) is a cinematic tour de force directed by the critically acclaimed John Ford. This pioneering Western stars John Wayne and Claire Trevor as they lead an eclectic group of strangers on an exciting adventure traveling the treacherous Apache country in a stagecoach.\n\nThis narrative brings together a wide variety of people, all with unique histories and secrets to share. A whiskey salesman, a pompous Southerner, an alcoholic doctor, and a prostitute are among the many characters they meet along the route. There will be chances for self-improvement as well as danger and Apache raids along the way. The film deftly examines themes of virtue, redemption, and the indomitable will to survive as they set off.\n\nAfter its 1939 premiere, Stagecoach garnered widespread praise and became a cultural touchstone of the Hollywood Golden Age. The film's outstanding director, screenplay, and performances received accolades from critics worldwide. The esteemed United States Library of Congress has recognized it as having \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" qualities. A further accolade for the film is its selection for preservation in the esteemed National Film Registry.\n\nWith its deep and meaningful themes reverberating throughout cinematic history, Stagecoach is considered one of the most groundbreaking films ever. Its cultural significance in determining the future of Western film is attested to by its long-lasting impact, which reflects its universal appeal. In addition to being nominated for Best Picture and Supporting Actor for Thomas Mitchell, the film also won Best Scoring.\n\nStagecoach Locations\n\nAlong with making John Wayne a household name, the groundbreaking American film Stagecoach cemented Monument Valley in everyone's mind as the quintessential image of the American West. Monument Valley, on the Utah/Arizona border, is where the majority of the breathtaking outdoor scenes were shot.\n\nThis region's scenery is defined by towering mesas and buttes, creating an unmatched background that has since become synonymous with the Western genre. Despite its iconic significance, it's interesting to note that only John Wayne, out of the principal cast, ventured to this rocky region during the 1938 production. The rest of the picture was shot mainly in California's San Fernando Valley. The journey to Monument Valley promises more than just a pilgrimage for cinephiles; it offers a glimpse into a land of stark beauty and resilience, managed by the Navajo Nation as a Tribal Park rather than a National Park. The valley's unique geological formations have served as the backdrop for Stagecoach and have been featured in various other films, making it an important cinematic site.\n\nAdditionally, the film utilized diverse Californian landscapes, from the Kern Rive crossing near Kernville to the historic wagon paths at Newhall's Fremont Pass and the staged Indian chase at Lucerne Dry Lake. These varied locations collectively enriched the film's visual narrative, making a trip to these sites worthwhile for fans of Stagecoach and those captivated by the allure of the American West and its cinematic representation.\n\nIn the opening scene, we see a diverse group of strangers setting off on a dangerous adventure through the American West's harsh landscapes. On their way to Lordsburg, New Mexico, a group of people are getting on a stagecoach at Tonto, Arizona Territory, in June 1880. This unusual mix includes Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell), an alcoholic physician; Dallas (Claire Trevor), a marginalized woman forced out of town; Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt), a pregnant lady accompanying her cavalry officer husband; and Samuel Peacock (Donald Meek), a whiskey dealer.\n\nIn a critical scene, the Arizona/Utah border town of Monument Valley is elevated to the stature of a symbol of the American Old West. Easy Rider, Back to the Future III, Transformers: Age of Extinction, and numerous other films have featured Monument Valley's famous mesas and buttes, in addition to its usage in earlier John Ford Westerns.\n\nMonument Valley, located on the Navajo Nation at the Arizona/Utah border, is renowned for its awe-inspiring natural beauty. The landscape is characterized by vast, open spaces punctuated by crimson mesas and towering sandstone buttes under a vast expanse of sky. This remarkable desert terrain captures an array of colors that seem to exist only in nature, embodying the spirit and majesty of the American Southwest.\n\nVisitors to Monument Valley can experience the wonder of this iconic location through the 17-mile dirt loop known as Valley Drive. This self-guided tour allows travelers to immerse themselves in the stunning scenery that has captivated audiences and filmmakers alike.\n\nTo reach Monument Valley, travelers can drive from nearby cities such as Flagstaff, Arizona, or Albuquerque, New Mexico. The closest major airport is in Page, Arizona, with car rentals available for the scenic drive to the valley.\n\nA crucial turning point occurs when the group learns that the ferry has been destroyed by Apaches, leaving them stranded and exposed. In a moment of unity and desperation, the lawman Curley (George Bancroft) decides to uncuff Ringo (John Wayne), the imprisoned bandit, to help with the critical task of stringing logs together to float the stagecoach across the river.\n\nThis renowned river crossing scene was not filmed in the harsh terrains of Arizona or Utah, as one might anticipate given the film's depiction of the American West. The locale instead was the Kern River, close to Kernville, California, about forty miles east of Bakersfield.\n\nFor fans eager to explore the location where this memorable scene was filmed, the journey begins at Riverside Park in Kernville. Covering an area of 4.1 acres, Riverside Park is not only a gateway to retracing the steps of the Stagecoach cast but also a lovely destination for outdoor activities. Visitors can enjoy a leisurely walk, engage in sports with the park's basketball court, or simply take in the natural scenery. The park also offers restroom facilities, making it a convenient starting point for fans and nature lovers to immerse themselves in a piece of cinematic history while enjoying the beauty of the Kern River area.\n\nAccess to this location is exclusively possible by vehicle. Departing from Los Angeles, expect a journey of nearly three hours through I-5 N and then by taking the CA-178 E/E 178 Freeway. If you're starting from Las Vegas, the travel time increases to approximately five hours, utilizing the I-15 S route.\n\nWith the stagecoach party whizzing away from their Apache pursuers, the tension is at an all-time high. Despite suffering injuries in the never-ending struggle to ward off their assailants, the characters show their real courage amidst the mayhem.\n\nThe scene is punctuated by a moment of poignant sacrifice; Hatfield (John Carradine), a gambler with a heart of gold, prepares to use his last bullet to spare Mrs. Mallory (Louise Platt) the horror of capture, only to be mortally wounded himself. When all hope seems lost, the Sixth U.S. Cavalry arrives, turning the tide in a thrilling climax.\n\nThis memorable pursuit sequence was artfully created amidst the lonely stretches of Lucerne Dry Lake near Victorville, nestled within the expansive vistas of Chatsworth and Calabasas in Southern California. The selection of this locale was influenced by its historical use in the 1937 Monogram movie Riders of the Dawn, where the famed stunt performer Yakima Canutt orchestrated the thrilling chase anew. To ensure the safety of the cast and crew and facilitate the filming process, extensive terrain preparation was undertaken, involving the digging up of 20 acres of ground with a tractor to soften the harsh desert floor.\n\nHowever, visitors should be aware that all recreational off-road activities, including dirt bikes, quads, and 4WD vehicles, are prohibited at Lucerne Dry Lake to preserve the natural environment and maintain safety.\n\nFor enthusiasts eager to explore the historical location that served as the backdrop for this cinematic classic, Lucerne Dry Lake is situated near Victorville, California. The journey from Los Angeles to this iconic site takes approximately two-and-a-half hours when traveling via I-15 N.\n\nIn Lordsburg, the scene unfolds with Gatewood (Berton Churchill), the banker, being apprehended by the town's sheriff while Mrs. Mallory receives relief that her husband's injury is minor. Grateful, she thanks Dallas, who, in a gesture of kindness, offers her shawl to Mrs. Mallory. Dallas pleads with Ringo, urging him to avoid a showdown with the Plummers, yet his desire to resolve the conflict remains firm. Ringo glimpses the brothel as they make their way through the town, marking Dallas's return to her past life.\n\nThis cinematic voyage was brought to life through the magic of Republic Studios, known in the film as Tonto, and Goldwyn Studios, which served as Lordsburg. Republic Studios, an emblem of Hollywood's golden era from 1935 to 1967, was nestled in the heart of Los Angeles.\n\nThe studio was famed for its elaborate standing sets, offering filmmakers a treasure trove of locales ranging from quintessential Western streets to idyllic middle-American homes, from bustling small-town businesses to a vibrant New York street, and from a quaint Mexican village to dramatic cowboy cliffs. The studio's diverse landscapes also featured a serene lake, a dense jungle area, and an opulent mansion reminiscent of Gone with the Wind's Tara. Although the grandeur of Republic Studios' outdoor sets has essentially given way to studio production bungalows, the legacy of its cinematic contributions endures.\n\nFor film enthusiasts and historians wishing to trace the steps of Stagecoach's legendary journey, visiting the former sites of Republic Studios and Goldwyn Studios offers a glimpse into the bygone era of classic Hollywood filmmaking. Situated in Los Angeles, these iconic studios are accessible via US-101 N, with a journey from downtown taking approximately 25 minutes by road. Additionally, public bus services offer routes to this location."
