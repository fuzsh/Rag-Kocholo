        "text": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- Allen Woll, an associate professor of history at Rutgers University in Camden, is the author of ''The Latin Image in American Film.'' By ALLEN WOLL\n\nProtests and boycotts in several major cities greeted the premiere of Daniel Petrie's ''Fort Apache, The Bronx.'' Hispanic groups argued that the film portrayed the Puerto Ricans of the South Bronx as criminals, prostitutes and murderers. Even Paul Newman's girlfriend in the film, a nurse played by Rachel Ticotin, was also depicted as a dope addict. Mayor Koch attended an opening night performance and agreed with the protesters, calling the film ''racist'' and ''unkosher.''\n\nDespite these charges, many critics reacted favorably to the film. Vincent Canby found ''Fort Apache, The Bronx'' a ''tough talking street melodrama,'' both ''entertaining and very moving.'' Similarly, the director and stars of the film expressed surprise at the extent of the controversy, maintaining that ''Fort Apache'' presents a realistic view of a policeman's life at the embattled station house 41 in the South Bronx.\n\nThe anger of the Puerto Rican Alliance and other Hispanic groups with ''Fort Apache, The Bronx'' is understandable in light of screen history. Hispanics maintain that Hollywood films have always portrayed them as either vicious bandits, lazy peasants, or humorous buffoons. While emphasizing these stereotypes, Hollywood motion pictures have ignored the positive contributions of Hispanic-Americans to life and culture in the United States. While blacks and native Americans have found their screen images improving in recent years, Hispanics argue that Hollywood still utilizes caricatures that flourished at the turn of the century. The furor over ''Fort Apache, The Bronx'' is therefore the latest battle in a 60-year struggle to improve the image of the Latin on the American screen.\n\nThe earliest silent films quickly identified the Mexican as among the most vile of the screen's villains. He robbed, murdered, pillaged, raped, cheated, gambled, lied and displayed virtually every vice that could be shown on the screen. This image flowered in a series of ''greaser'' films, such as ''Tony the Greaser'' (1911), ''Bronco Billy and the Greaser'' (1914), and ''The Greaser's Revenge'' (1914). The term ''greaser'' swiftly supplanted ''Mexican'' or ''Latin'' as a synonym for the violent Hispanic on the screen.\n\nThe coming of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 accentuated the Latin image of violence on the screen as a series of pseudo-documentaries of the conflict were exhibited in American theaters. Real and fictional events soon began to blur, as one of the leading agrarian revolutionaries, Pancho Villa, signed a contract with the Mutual Film Corporation. Villa allowed Mutual cameramen to follow his exploits, and, in return, he agreed to fight during daylight hours if possible and delay his attacks until the cameras were in position. Villa accepted this unusual arrangement since his forces needed money for munitions. The resultant films tended to emphasize the gory details of the Mexican Revolution and ignore the political questions. For example, The New York Times noted that ''Barbarous Mexico'' (1913) tended to linger on ''the burning of dead bodies on the battlefield.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
