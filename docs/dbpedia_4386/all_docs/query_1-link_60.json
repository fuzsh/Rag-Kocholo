        "text": "Cinema | History\n\nThe film industry has always been a difficult business, especially for Hispanic and Latinx artists who have faced an uphill battle in Hollywood for years. Despite making up a significant portion of the population, Latinos are underrepresented in the industry, with only 5.2% of lead actors, 5.1% of screenwriters, and 2.6% of directors being of Latino origin in 2023. This lack of representation can be traced back to the history of the industry itself.\n\nIn the early days of cinema, from the late 19th century to the early 1920s, the film industry lacked a standardized structure. This allowed Latinos from primarily privileged economic backgrounds and predominantly of Spanish ancestry to participate in filmmaking, both in front of and behind the camera. However, the rise in popularity of the Western genre, the most popular during that period, perpetuated a surge in stereotyping."
