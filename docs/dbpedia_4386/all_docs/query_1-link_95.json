        "text": "Pre-Code Hollywood refers to the era in American film history that took place between the \"talkies\" of 1929 to mid-year 1934. During this time, Hollywood studios operated under a less stringent censorship regime, allowing filmmakers to explore controversial and provocative themes that were later restricted or banned under the draconian Motion Picture Production Code (Hays Code).\n\nThe Hays Code, named after its chief proponent William H Hays who was the president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) at the time, was introduced in 1930 but wasn't strictly enforced until July of 1934 when it became the industry standard. This code and its censorship standards lasted until 1968.\n\nDuring the Pre-Code era, filmmakers enjoyed a remarkable degree of creative freedom, resulting in movies that pushed the boundaries of moral, social, and artistic conventions. Some defining characteristics of Pre-Code Hollywood films include:\n\nMature themes: Pre-Code films tackled subjects like adultery, promiscuity, prostitution, and substance abuse. These themes were often depicted more openly and realistically than in later eras.\n\nStrong and independent female characters: The period saw the rise of strong and assertive female protagonists who challenged traditional gender roles and norms. Actresses such as Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, and Greta Garbo portrayed multifaceted women who made their own choices and decisions.\n\nSocial commentary: Many Pre-Code films delved into societal issues, including poverty, political corruption, racism, and class disparities. They didn't shy away from critiquing the establishment or questioning authority.\n\nSexual innuendo and suggestive content: Sexual humor and suggestive scenes were common in Pre-Code films. This included scenes with scantily clad actors and risqué dialogue, elements that would be heavily censored in later years.\n\nViolence and crime: Gangster films, in particular, gained popularity during this era, with movies like \"Little Caesar\" (1931) and \"Scarface\" (1932) featuring antiheroes and glamorizing the criminal underworld.\n\nNontraditional endings: Pre-Code films were not bound by the moralistic endings later enforced by the Hays Code. Consequently, movies often concluded with morally ambiguous or tragic resolutions.\n\nUnconventional storytelling techniques: Filmmakers experimented with narrative structures and visual styles, paving the way for advancements in cinematic storytelling.\n\nDespite the creative freedom and boundary-pushing of the Pre-Code era, it also faced criticism from various groups, including religious organizations and civic leaders, who believed that movies were becoming morally corrupting. As a response to mounting pressure, the Hays Code was strictly enforced from 1934 onward, leading to a more sanitized and family-friendly Hollywood for several decades. However, Pre-Code Hollywood remains an essential and intriguing period in cinema history, reflecting a time when filmmakers were unafraid to explore the complexities and darker aspects of human nature on the silver screen.\n\nDuring the Pre-Code Hollywood era, several actors left a significant impact on the film industry and shaped the way Hollywood portrayed characters and stories. While there were numerous influential actors during this time, here are some of the most notable ones:\n\nGreta Garbo: Often referred to as the \"Divine Garbo,\" Greta Garbo was one of the most iconic and enigmatic actresses of her time. Her performances in films like \"Anna Christie\" (1930) and \"Grand Hotel\" (1932) showcased her immense talent and emotional depth, making her a symbol of sophisticated sensuality and introspective drama.\n\nClark Gable: Known as the \"King of Hollywood,\" Clark Gable's charisma and rugged charm made him a popular leading man in Pre-Code films. His roles in movies like \"Red Dust\" (1932) and \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) earned him widespread acclaim and solidified his status as a Hollywood legend.\n\nJoan Crawford: With her alluring beauty and versatility as an actress, Joan Crawford became a prominent figure in Pre-Code Hollywood. She portrayed strong and complex female characters in films such as \"Rain\" (1932) and \"Grand Hotel\" (1932), leaving a lasting impact on the portrayal of women in cinema.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck: Renowned for her versatility and powerful performances, Barbara Stanwyck was an influential actress during the Pre-Code era. Her roles in films like \"Baby Face\" (1933) and \"Stella Dallas\" (1937) showcased her range as an actress and her ability to tackle challenging and controversial characters.\n\nJames Cagney: A dynamic actor known for his intensity and energy, James Cagney made a name for himself in gangster films during the Pre-Code era. His iconic roles in movies like \"The Public Enemy\" (1931) and \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938) made him synonymous with the gangster persona and left a lasting impact on the crime genre.\n\nMae West: A true trailblazer, Mae West was not only an actress but also a talented playwright and screenwriter. Her wit, double entendres, and daring sexual innuendos in films like \"She Done Him Wrong\" (1933) and \"I'm No Angel\" (1933) challenged societal norms and solidified her as an influential figure in Hollywood.\n\nJean Harlow: Often referred to as the \"Blonde Bombshell,\" Jean Harlow epitomized the glamorous and seductive Hollywood starlet of the era. Her roles in films like \"Red Dust\" (1932) and \"Dinner at Eight\" (1933) made her a symbol of sensuality and allure during the Pre-Code era.\n\nThese actors, among others, played pivotal roles in shaping the landscape of Pre-Code Hollywood. Their performances, charisma, and influence on film genres contributed to the era's creative freedom and willingness to explore daring themes, leaving a lasting legacy in the history of cinema.\n\nThe Pre-Code Hollywood era produced numerous influential films that pushed the boundaries of storytelling and challenged societal norms. While it's impossible to list every influential film from this period, here's an extensive list of some of the most significant Pre-Code films:\n\n\"The Jazz Singer\" (1927) - The first feature-length motion picture with synchronized sound, starring Al Jolson, which signaled the end of the silent film era.\n\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930) - An anti-war film based on Erich Maria Remarque's novel, offering a powerful and unflinching portrayal of the horrors of war.\n\n\"Pandora's Box\" (1929) - Starring Louise Brooks, this German film explores themes of sexuality and desire and remains a classic of world cinema.\n\n\"City Lights\" (1931) - A silent romantic comedy-drama directed by and starring Charlie Chaplin, showcasing his iconic character, the Tramp.\n\n\"Dracula\" (1931) - Starring Bela Lugosi, this film brought Bram Stoker's famous vampire to the screen and established the Universal Monsters franchise.\n\n\"Frankenstein\" (1931) - Another Universal classic, directed by James Whale, and starring Boris Karloff as the iconic monster.\n\n\"Scarface\" (1932) - Directed by Howard Hawks and loosely based on the life of Al Capone, this gangster film set the standard for the genre.\n\n\"Freaks\" (1932) - A controversial horror film directed by Tod Browning, featuring a cast of real-life circus performers and challenging societal norms.\n\n\"Grand Hotel\" (1932) - A star-studded ensemble drama that brought together Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford, and Wallace Beery, among others.\n\n\"Shanghai Express\" (1932) - Directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Marlene Dietrich, this film is known for its lush visuals and exotic setting.\n\n\"King Kong\" (1933) - A groundbreaking monster film directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, featuring pioneering special effects.\n\n\"Duck Soup\" (1933) - A Marx Brothers comedy directed by Leo McCarey, known for its zany humor and satirical take on politics and war.\n\n\"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\" (1932) - Starring Paul Muni, this powerful drama shed light on the harsh realities of the prison system.\n\n\"Baby Face\" (1933) - A controversial film starring Barbara Stanwyck, where she uses her sexuality to climb the social ladder.\n\n\"42nd Street\" (1933) - A Busby Berkeley musical extravaganza that showcased innovative choreography and camera work.\n\n\"She Done Him Wrong\" (1933) - Mae West's breakout film, known for her risqué humor and iconic one-liners.\n\n\"King Kong\" (1933) - A groundbreaking monster film directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, featuring pioneering special effects.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" (1934) - A romantic comedy directed by Frank Capra, starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, which became the first film to sweep the five major Academy Awards.\n\nThese are just a few examples of influential Pre-Code Hollywood films that left a lasting impact on the industry and paved the way for future generations of filmmakers to explore bold and daring storytelling.\n\nann dvorak\n\n​(1911-1979)\n\nAnn Dvorak, born Anna McKim on August 2, 1911, was an American actress who achieved fame during the Golden Age of Hollywood. She appeared in numerous films during the 1930s and 1940s and was known for her versatility and talent as an actress.\n\nDvorak was born in New York City to silent film actress Anna Lehr and actor/director Edwin McKim. Her parents divorced when she was very young, and she was primarily raised by her mother. Growing up in a showbiz family, she had early exposure to the entertainment industry.\n\nShe made her film debut at the age of 5 in \"Scarlet Days\" (1919), a film directed by her father. However, her acting career didn't take off until the 1930s when she was signed by Warner Bros. under the name Ann Dvorak. She quickly became a prominent actress and was often cast in both leading and supporting roles.\n\nSome of her notable films from the 1930s include \"Scarface\" (1932), where she played the sister of Paul Muni's character; \"Three on a Match\" (1932), alongside Joan Blondell and Bette Davis; and \"Heat Lightning\" (1934), among others. Dvorak's performances were well-received, and she was praised for her range and emotional depth.\n\nDespite her talent, Dvorak struggled to break free from typecasting and conflicts with the studio system. She wanted more challenging roles and often felt frustrated by the roles she was assigned. In 1936, she tried to break her contract with Warner Bros., leading to a legal battle that affected her career negatively.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Dvorak continued to work in films, but her career wasn't as prominent as it had been in the previous decade. She appeared in movies like \"I Was an American Spy\" (1951) and \"The Secret of Convict Lake\" (1951). However, she eventually turned her focus to television and theater work.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Dvorak largely retired from acting and chose to focus on her personal life. She married and had a family, enjoying a quieter existence away from the spotlight. Despite her relatively brief career, she left a lasting impact on classic Hollywood cinema.\n\nAnn Dvorak passed away on December 10, 1979, at the age of 68. While she might not be as well-remembered as some of her contemporaries, her contributions to film during the 1930s and her performances in notable films have solidified her place in Hollywood history.\n\nQuotes:\n\n[when asked how her last name is pronounced] \"My name is properly pronounced \"vor'shack\". The D remains silent. I have had quite a time with the name, having been called practically everything from Balzac to Bickelsrock.\"\n\n[July 18, 1932] \"I don't want to go back to Hollywood if I can help it. I want to go back to the stage. The trouble with Hollywood is everybody is crazy for money. The producers are trying to make pictures cheaper and faster. They do not realize the public is becoming more critical, and can see the cheapness.\"\n\n- Ann Dvorak\n\nTrivia:\n\nAttempted to have her Warner Brothers contract terminated over financial issues, after finding out that she made the same money as the five-year-old who played her son in Three on a Match (1932).\n\nMoved to England during World War II and, between film gigs, worked as an ambulance driver to support the war effort.\n\nHer friend Joan Crawford was the one who introduced her to Howard Hughes, who in turn was looking for a girl for his production of Scarface (1932). She made $250 a week.\n\nShe made her film debut when she was five years old in the silent film version of Ramona (1916), credited as \"Baby Anna Lehr\". She continued in children's roles in The Man Hater (1917) and Five Dollar Plate (1920), but then stopped acting in films.\n\nAnna May Wong\n\n(1905-1961)\n\nAnna May Wong was a pioneering Chinese-American actress who achieved international fame in the early 20th century. She was born Wong Liu Tsong on January 3, 1905, in Los Angeles, California, USA. Her parents were Chinese immigrants who ran a laundry business.\n\nAs a child, Wong developed an interest in acting and began her career in silent films at the age of 14. She faced significant racial discrimination and stereotyping in the film industry, but she persevered and worked hard to break barriers and challenge the limited opportunities available to Asian actors at the time.\n\nIn 1922, Anna May Wong landed her first leading role in the film \"The Toll of the Sea.\" This role garnered critical acclaim and marked the beginning of her rise to stardom. Over the next decade, she appeared in numerous films, including \"Piccadilly\" (1929), where she starred opposite Gilda Gray. Wong's performances were praised for their beauty, grace, and charisma.\n\nHowever, Wong faced the frustrating reality of being often typecast as exotic or stereotypical Asian characters, perpetuating racial clichés. The restrictive Hollywood environment, combined with the anti-miscegenation laws of the time, made it difficult for Wong to secure leading roles opposite Caucasian actors, further limiting her career opportunities.\n\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s, Wong traveled to Europe, where she starred in several successful films, earning her recognition and admiration from European audiences. Despite her success overseas, Wong continued to face racial discrimination upon her return to Hollywood.\n\nOne of the most significant setbacks Wong experienced was the controversial casting of the character O-Lan in the film adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's novel \"The Good Earth\" (1937). Despite being a talented and well-known Chinese-American actress, Wong was passed over for the lead role in favor of a white actress, Luise Rainer, who was given makeup to appear Chinese. This casting decision was a major disappointment for Wong and highlighted the systemic racism prevalent in the entertainment industry.\n\nDespite the challenges, Wong persevered and continued to work in films, radio, and television. She became the first Asian-American actress to have her own television show, \"The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong,\" which aired briefly in 1951.\n\nAnna May Wong's impact on Hollywood and the film industry cannot be overstated. She was a trailblazer who fought against racial stereotypes and paved the way for future generations of Asian-American actors. Wong's legacy extends beyond her acting career; she remains an icon for representation and diversity in the entertainment world.\n\nAnna May Wong passed away on February 3, 1961, in Santa Monica, California. Her contributions to film and her advocacy for Asian representation continue to be remembered and celebrated today.\n\nAnna May Wong's impact on pre-Code Hollywood was significant, as she was one of the few Asian-American actresses to achieve fame during this era and challenged racial stereotypes on screen. The pre-Code era (late 1920s to 1934) allowed for more creative freedom in filmmaking, but it was still characterized by racial stereotypes and limited opportunities for actors of color. Despite these challenges, Wong managed to carve out a notable place for herself in the industry and made significant contributions.\n\nBreaking Stereotypes: During the pre-Code era, Asian characters in Hollywood films were often portrayed through demeaning and exoticized stereotypes. However, Anna May Wong sought to challenge these portrayals by playing more authentic and nuanced roles. While she still faced limitations in the types of characters she could portray, Wong's performances often showcased a dignity and complexity that defied the narrow stereotypes of the time.\n\nLeading Roles: Wong managed to secure leading roles in films, a rare feat for an Asian-American actress in Hollywood during that period. Her talent and screen presence allowed her to transcend racial barriers and become a prominent figure in the film industry.\n\nInternational Fame: Wong's fame was not limited to the United States; she achieved recognition and popularity worldwide, particularly in Europe. She became a symbol of Asian representation in cinema and broke down barriers in international markets.\n\nCollaboration with Major Studios: Wong worked with major Hollywood studios, including Paramount and MGM, which helped elevate her status as an actress and brought her performances to a broader audience.\n\nAsian-American Trailblazer: Anna May Wong's success in pre-Code Hollywood paved the way for future generations of Asian-American actors and actresses. Her visibility and accomplishments in the industry inspired others to pursue careers in film and entertainment, even as they faced the same racial barriers she had confronted.\n\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge that despite her achievements, Wong still faced significant challenges due to the prevailing racism and discriminatory practices in Hollywood. She often lost out on roles to white actresses in yellowface, as exemplified by the casting decisions in films like \"The Good Earth.\" This reflected the systemic racism and limited opportunities for Asian actors during that time.\n\nIn conclusion, Anna May Wong's impact on pre-Code Hollywood can be seen as a trailblazing effort to challenge stereotypes, advocate for better representation, and open doors for Asian-American performers in the film industry. Her contributions to cinema and her fight for more authentic portrayals of Asian characters continue to be recognized and appreciated today.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"I see no reason why Chinese and English people should not kiss on the screen, even though I prefer not to.\"\n\nIn Photoplay (June 1923): \"I couldn't find a taxi, and I haven't got a car myself. I ruined the last one I had trying to beat a motor cop to a bridge. I beat him all right, but I missed the bridge.\"\n\n- Anna May Wong\n\nTrivia:\n\nLucy Liu dedicated her Hollywood Walk of Fame speech to her. Their stars are adjacent to each other.\n\nAnna once had an affair with noted silent film director Marshall Neilan. Most of her romances tended towards Caucasian men, as many Chinese men looked down on actresses as prostitutes.\n\nIt is believed by some that Wong never kissed her leading man on the lips on screen but she does share just such a kiss with John Loder in Java Head (1934). Such a scene was filmed for her film The Flame of Love (1930) with John Longden but was deleted by censors who felt that moviegoers might be offended by an interracial kiss. Also in Lady from Chungking (1942), Harold Huber, a Caucasian playing a Japanese general, kisses her on the lips as the scene fades, in the 63rd minute of the film.\n\nDesperately wanted the role of O-Lan in the romance film The Good Earth (1937). However, due to her being ethnically Chinese and the male lead Paul Muni being Caucasian, she was turned down for the role. She was given an opportunity to play Lotus, a Chinese peasant girl, which she turned down.\n\nOnce coached Dorothy Lamour, who was appearing as a Eurasian girl in the film Disputed Passage (1939).\n\nIn 1956, Anna received a long-deferred chance to play a role she lost out on in 1940s Hollywood. Playing the Asian blackmailer in W.

Born on July 29, 1905, in Brooklyn, New York, she was the youngest of three siblings. Bow grew up in a troubled household, facing poverty and an unstable family life. Her father suffered from mental health issues, and her mother struggled to support the family.\n\nAt a young age, Clara Bow began entering beauty contests, and her beauty and charisma quickly caught the attention of talent scouts.

She endured negative publicity, often due to fabricated or exaggerated stories about her relationships and behavior. The advent of talkies (films with synchronized sound) in the late 1920s brought additional obstacles for Bow, as her Brooklyn accent did not fit the image studios wanted to present.\n\nNonetheless, Clara Bow made a successful transition to talkies with the film \"The Wild Party\" (1929).

I really had no idea I would get it. In fact, I was ready to leave for New York the night they called to tell me about it. Dressed in a mousy brown suit, I was escorted into the banquet hall full of diamonds and tail coats. It was especially embarrassing because I imagined they thought I was putting on an act, making an entrance.\"\n\n[on the Motion Picture Production Code] \"They were so strict in the old days. Back then, everything had to be symbolic. As he could not show what they can now, DeMille had to figure out ways to make people imagine what was going on.
