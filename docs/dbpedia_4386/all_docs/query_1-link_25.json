        "text": "Americans who stream a lot of television are likely to have some familiarity with British or South Korean or Latin American TV. They may even have an idea of what to expect from a Turkish or Israeli or South African show.\n\nIt’s less likely that “Finnish TV” would conjure anything in their minds besides snow, or images of dour crime dramas from more celebrated TV-producing neighbors like Denmark and Sweden. But in a TV Venn diagram whose circles were tiny population, high productivity and “surprisingly enjoyable,” Finland would be in the center.\n\nDon’t go looking for Finnish comedies — they may exist, but they don’t appear to be what the streaming services are buying. What you’re going to find are dramas, typically ones that bring a twist to familiar genres. They also tend to have an unforced seriousness, without the sanctimony or self-consciousness that often mar their American counterparts.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the most recent Finnish shows to come to American screens, along with a slightly older one that has come closer than any other Finnish drama to really breaking through in the United States.\n\n‘Piece of My Heart’\n\nPremiering Thursday on the streaming service Topic (also home to “The Killing,” an icon of Scandinavian Noir), this eight-episode drama takes the conventions of the buddy-cop show and transfers them to an occupation not often featured on TV: child protective services.\n\nRita (Lotta Lehtikari) is the embittered veteran obsessed with a case that went wrong; Laura (Niina Koponen) is the idealistic, empathetic newcomer. They adjust to each other while going out on calls — yes, it’s a child-welfare procedural — involving Helsinki’s homeless, abused or simply troubled youngsters. Freaked-out parents and disingenuous bureaucrats are the antagonists; the police, the usual heroes in this sort of scenario, are a necessary evil, indifferent and sometimes hostile.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
