The stunningly beautiful island of Nuku Hiva is the largest of the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia, and an overseas territory of France. The first people to arrive here came from Micronesia over 2000 years ago, and later colonized Tahiti, Hawaii, the Cook Islands and New Zealand. The legend has it that Ono, the god of creation, promised his wife he would build a house in one day, so he gathered together land and created these islands, all named after parts of the house. Nuku Hiva is the roof of Ono's house. Its volcanic origins are responsible for the dramatic scenery and vast natural harbor that exist due to the partial collapse of a volcano's caldera.
