        "text": "Tiki statues in the jungle, black-rock mountains, and a laid-back culture, all on the undeveloped Marquesas Islands.\n\nFor a glimpse into the jungle-snarled landscapes and Polynesian culture that existed before the French, you might consider a visit to the Marquesas. Steep basaltic mountains, a laid-back culture, and very few other visitors make this a great place to unwind for a week or so, without the crowds that you'll find on Tahiti, which is located about a four-hour flight away.\n\nThese islands are unprotected by barrier islands and the shores are mostly battered by the deep-blue rollers of the Pacific. This, combined with their mountainous interiors, means the islands have largely been bypassed by resorts and other visitor infrastructure. You can enjoy a rustic stay at the simple hotels here or visit via cruise from other islands, combining the luxury of a ship with the adventure of visiting this undeveloped archipelago.\n\nThings to see and do in the Marquesas Islands\n\nExplore Nuka Hiva on a 4x4 tour\n\nThe largest of the Marquesas, Nuka Hiva has few people but a wealth of untrammeled tropical landscapes and historic ruins. You can explore on your own, or we can arrange for a guided Jeep tour of the island’s highlights. You’ll meet local craftsmen, traverse a lush valley planted with banana trees, and visit several of the tiki (sacred statues) and tohua (sacred gathering places) that dot the island.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive of these is Hikokua. Dating to the 13th century, this gathering space boasts a collection of powerful statues, some original and others carved by modern artists. They surround several platforms that were (and are) used for dance performances and other important community gatherings. Your guide can unpack the complex cultural uses of this space on your tour.\n\nTour Tahuata Island\n\nFor a contrast, you can also take a day-long tour of Tahuata Island, the smallest inhabited island in the Marquesas. You’ll visit the small villages of Vaitahu and Hapatoni, both a short boat ride from Hiva Oa, where you can explore a church, a museum, and meet the craftspeople who live here. Hapatoni is particularly known for its sculptors who create art from rosewood, bones, and even swordfish beaks. You’ll also have time to relax on the golden-sand beach and swim in the sparkling bay.\n\nBest time to visit the Marquesas Islands\n\nYou’ll encounter the least rain between June to October, making it an ideal time to visit."
