        "text": "Criterion B: Distribution and Abundance\n\nSub-criterion B2: Aggregations\n\nLarge groups (up to several hundreds) of melon-headed whales are seen aggregating on a daily basis very close to the shore around most of the main islands of the archipelago within the IMMA. Over 6,000 dorsal fin photographs collected among 14 melon-headed whales’ groups at four islands (Mohotani, Ua Huka, Ua Pou, and Nuku Hiva) in the IMMA were analysed. A total of 393 distinctively marked individuals were identified. Based on these data, the minimum abundance of melon-headed whales in the Marquesas Islands was estimated at about 1,800 individuals using the Lincoln-Petersen, two-sample, mark-recapture model (McClung 2017; Poole et al. 2013).\n\nCriterion D: Special Attributes\n\nSub-criterion D1: Distinctiveness\n\nThe unusual use of coastal habitat by Melon-headed whales in the Solomon’s during daytime is a distinctive behavioural/ecological feature of the IMMA. Furthermore, preliminary mtDNA analyses have shown genetic structuring of Melon-headed whales inhabiting the waters of Mohotani, compared to those that occur around the northern islands of Nuku Hiva, Ua Huka and Ua Pou (Baker, unpublished), i.e. within the IMMA. Melon-headed whales are usually described as pelagic and therefore their regular occurrence in coastal waters of the Marquesas is noteworthy, although it’s important to note, that aggregations of this species have also been reported at Palmyra atoll (Brownell et al., 2009) and Mayotte (Kiszka et al., 2011). Therefore, although unusual, this behaviour is not necessarily unique. However, the fact these aggregations happen simultaneously at several islands of the same archipelago is unmatched to our knowledge.\n\nGenetic analyses (mtDNA sequencing and microsatellite genotyping) have shown that spinner dolphins from the Marquesas are genetically distinct from other populations in the Pacific (Oremus et al. 2007, Baker Unpublished report; Baker 2015). In addition, Oremus et al (2007) found clear genetic differentiation between spinner dolphins in the Marquesas and Society Islands.\n\nSub-criterion D2: Diversity\n\nAll dedicated cetacean surveys conducted in the Marquesas so far have confirmed a high diversity of cetacean species (16 species) in the IMMA (Gannier et al., 2002, Laran et al,. 2012, Poole et al., 2013). Gannier et al. (2002) recorded a total of 154 groups of odontocetes on-effort in the Marquesas, including ten delphinids species (S. attenuata, S. longirostris, T. truncatus, P. electra, S. bredanensis, G. macrorhynchus, P. crassidens, F. attenuata, G. griseus and O. orca). In April-May 2011, Laran et al. (2012) conducted aerial surveys across the Marquesas archipelago, resulting in the identification of 11 species. Finally, Poole et al. (2013), despite concentrating their effort only in coastal/nearshore waters, identified 7 cetacean species during small boat surveys in April 2012.\n\nBaker, C.S. 2015.
