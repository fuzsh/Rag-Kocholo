        "text": "Reminiscent of a pilgrimage\n\nNuku Hiva is one of the three airports in the Marquesas Islands, along with Ua Huka and Hiva Oa.\n\nIt was a bumpy arrival. But the ATR 72 made it through without a problem and landed at the Nuku A Taha airport, also known as Deserted Land. The name fits. I expected even more pronounced lushness than in the Society Islands—this is a steppe. The sun darts beneath a band of dark clouds. The deserted land is then bathed in sun and rain. We stand there, motionless in the face of this unbelievable beauty. The light just feels different in the Marquesas.\n\nExploring the Marquesas is not about tourism. The first thing that comes to mind when I think of the Land of Men (Te Henua Enana in Marquesan) is more like a pilgrimage. This is the real name of this archipelago, located in the far northeast part of French Polynesia. The more commonly known name Marquesas was given by the Spaniard Álvaro de Mendaña in 1595. But the ancient name, “Land of Men,” has a deeper meaning.\n\nConquering the Polynesian Triangle\n\nThe Marquesas Islands are an essential part of Polynesian history. The ancestors of the Marquesans set out to colonize the eastern, northern, and extreme southeast regions of the Pacific Ocean. Their recklessness, faith in their gods, and ignorance of the stars led them to the southwest regions of Hawaii and Aotearoa (New Zealand). To this day, the Hawaiians and Maori still speak a Polynesian language that is similar to Marquesan.\n\nThey traveled eastward to the coast of South America, where they brought with them various items like sweet potatoes (kumara) and calabash (hue). Their influence may have even led to a rare mastery of sculpture and the creation of massive statutory art like no other throughout Polynesia.\n\nThe Marquesas Islands are so diverse and rich in their landscapes, culture, and archaeological sites that it would be impossible to see everything in one trip. How can anyone choose? Here are six must-see sites."
