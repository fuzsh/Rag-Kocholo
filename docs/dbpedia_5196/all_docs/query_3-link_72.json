        "text": "Tahiti on the Map\n\nâ\n\nTahiti, also known as The Islands of Tahiti, or French Polynesia, is located in the South Pacific Ocean about halfway between California and Australia. Â Although, it seems half a world away, Tahiti is in the same time zone as Hawaii and is about as far south of the equator as Hawaii is north of the equator.\n\nOnboard a comfortable, modern widebody jet, you can cover the approximately 4,000 miles from California to Tahiti on a quick overnight flight from Los Angeles or San Francisco.\n\nThe inset image on the map below, shows Tahiti resting in the South Pacific. The island nation is easily accessible from North America, South America, New Zealand, Australia and Asia. Seemingly small when viewed in the context of the vast Pacific Ocean, French Polynesia's many islands are actually spread across approximately 1,200 miles.\n\nThe larger map below illustrates that the outer boundary of the islands is approximately the size of the European Union. Most of this area is made up of ocean and lagoons as these 118 islands and atolls only have approximately 1,600 square miles of land mass between them.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nThe Islands of Tahiti\n\nJust the mention of âTahitiâ or âBora Boraâ evokes visions of an idyllic, tropical paradise. Islands filled with stunning beaches, crystal clear lagoon waters, overwater bungalows, and warm and welcoming Tahitian people.\n\nThese islands are primarily divided into five main island groups and are truly a magical destination for any occasion. On the more popular islands, you will find a wide variety of luxury resort accommodations, culinary delights, spa services, land and water-based activities, and much more.\n\nThe island of Bora Bora is one of the more famous of the 67 inhabited islands and home to several of our favorite hotels and resorts. Â Other well-known islands include: the main Island of Tahiti, Moorea, and Tahaâa. We list our favorites in more detail below. Â\n\nGiven its tropical location, the islands are blessed with a wonderful climate all year round. On some of the more remote islands, you could visit a Tahitian village to experience normal island life or just get away from it all. Â Tahiti has something to satisfy all your vacation desires. These islands are the place where your dreams of paradise can truly become a reality!\n\nFrench Polynesia has a local government, but is an overseas collectivity of France and subject to French rule of law. Below you will find a list of our favorite islands in Tahiti. Our team visits the area frequently and we are happy to provide our unique insights into the best resorts, the most exciting excursions, our favorite restaurants, the most decadent spas and more. We can certainly help you customize the perfect itinerary tailor made to your personal specifications that includes visits to as many islands as you like!\n\nâ\n\nâVenture Tahiti Travel Tip: When we plan itineraries, we would typically recommend spending at least 3 nights on each island you choose (except possibly Tahiti) to avoid feeling rushed. Â Since you are going to Tahiti to relax, we normally recommend against just 2 nights per island or resort. Â Also, as there is so many islands to see and each island is relatively small, we usually recommend spending no more than 8 nights on one single island.\n\nâ\n\nWe cover each of the individual islands listed below in more detail in âThe Islands of Tahitiâ section of our Tahiti Travel Guide, includingÂ where to stay, what to do and where to dine.\n\nBelow, is a short, but wonderful video providing a visual introduction to The Islands of Tahiti followed by brief descriptions of each major Tahitian island group or archipelago.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nSOCIETY ISLANDS\n\nThe Society Islands is one of the most popular archipelagos in French Polynesia as it is home to the capital city of Papeete and the International Airport. These islands are divided into the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands. They are all a tropical dream! Amazing blue lagoon waters and white sand beaches abound at the many excellent resort choices. Choose between various land and water activities or just relax on the private deck of your overwater bungalow. There is something for everyone in the Society Islands!\n\nTo read more about some of our favorite islands, click the links below.\n\nThe Island of Tahiti\n\nBora Bora\n\nâMoorea\n\nâHuahine\n\nâTaha'a & Raiatea\n\nâTetiaroa\n\nTUAMOTU ISLANDS\n\nThe Tuamotu Islands, with the pristine beauty of their lagoons and unique underwater worlds, offer some of the best diving in the world. This island group is only a short flight away from the Society Islands. Â In fact, on clear days, you can see Bora Boraâs Mt. Otemanu from Tahaâa. Â This region is more remote, however, and consist of 77 atolls spread over approximately 930 miles.\n\nTo read more about our favorite islands in Tuamotu, click the links below.\n\nRangiroa\n\nTikehau\n\nTHE MARQUESAS ISLANDS\n\nThe Marquesan people call their 12 islands âTe Henua âEnanaâ, the âLand of Menâ. This unique landscape is painted with legendary high cliffs, volcanic peaks, wild nature settings and amazing beaches. Â Only 6 of the Marquesas are inhabited and take a little more effort to reach. Two of the Marquesas, Nuka Hiva and Hiva Oa, are accessible by plane from the main Island of Tahiti. Â You can also venture out to the islands aboard a custom-built freighter/ passenger cruise ship named The Aranui. There are a couple of hotels located on Nuka Hiva and Hiva Oa, which offer a truly authentic island experience, well off the beaten path.\n\nTHE GAMBIER ISLANDS\n\nThis archipelago is the most remote (about 1,000 miles from the Island of Tahiti) and the least populated region of French Polynesia. With only 1,000 inhabitants, there are four main mountainous islands lying within the same lagoon with dozens of smaller islets, called motu. Â The Gambier are an important source of the famous Tahitian Black Pearls.\n\nTHE AUSTRAL ISLANDS\n\nLocated south of The Island of Tahiti on the Tropic of Capricorn, these 7 islands represent the southernmost boundary of French Polynesia. The climate is cooler than in Tahiti and the shape and ecology of these self-sufficient islands make them a charming world apart. Â Each year between August and October, humpback whales return to these waters to give birth.\n\n***\n\nBy now, you should have a better understanding of where the beautiful Islands of Tahiti are located and the make up of this island nation. We hope this piques your interest and helps make you feel like a visit to these islands is more within reach."
