The installer should find the Flight Simulator 2020/Community folder, if not, browse manually for this route as the scenery must be installed in this location.\n\nNOTE: Some antivirus, e.g., avast, can give a false positive to the Setup.exe file. If so, you can exclude the file from your antivirus program or disable it during the download/installation.\n\nUNINSTALLATION:\n\nTo uninstall the scenery, go to the Windows Control Panel and search the option in the “Uninstall or change a program” tab, or go to the Community folder and click the “unins00X” executable."
