        "text": "Hiva Oa\n\nHiva Oa, the second largest island, is located in the southeastern group. Home to the harbor town of Atuona, this island is usually the first port of call for sailboats crossing west over the Pacific. This is the most historic island in the group, with some of the largest ancient tiki statues in French Polynesia. Known as Gauguin's Island, Hiva Oa is also the final resting place for painter Paul Gauguin and poet Jacques Brel. Both artists are buried at the Cimetière du Calvaire, Calvary Cemetery, overlooking Atuona.\n\nThe Artistry\n\nIn the spirit of true artistry, it is here in the Marquesas Islands that many Polynesian art forms originated. The locals have proudly safeguarded the ancient techniques of tattoo, sculpture and woodcarving. They are also leaders in the revival of the traditional pahu (drum). Every four years, Nuku Hiva hosts the Marquesas Arts Festival, a celebration of the renowned artistic talent and deeply rooted traditions of these islands.\n\nThe Aranui\n\nThe best way to experience the primitive beauty of these faraway islands is to take an adventure cruise aboard the Aranui V. This working cargo freighter, which transports everything from food and medicine to fuel, also operates as a cruise ship for passengers who want to explore each of the fascinating Marquesas Islands.\n\nFinal Impression\n\nThe Marquesas, more than any other island in French Polynesia, beckon a very different type of traveler—one with an innate thirst for adventure. As you ride horseback through these wild and untamed landscapes, you will fall completely captive to their powerful and dreamlike qualities."
