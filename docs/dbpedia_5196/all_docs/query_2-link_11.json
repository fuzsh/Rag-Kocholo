        "text": "The Marquesas Islands are situated 1,500 km to the northeast of Tahiti. A land of tales and legends, called Te Henua ‘Enata in the Marquesan language, which means ‘The Land of Men’. The rugged landscape with its craggy mountains, cascading waterfalls and majestic bays, is home to an impressive number of archeological sites. Everywhere you go in these mystical islands, you are envelopped in the spiritual force that is part of Marquesan culture, the mana.\n\nWhy visit the Marquesas Islands?\n\nNuku Hiva\n\nThe biggest island in the archipelago with lofty mountain peaks which slope steeply down into the blue Pacific Ocean. The island’s main village, Taioha’e, is situated in a large bay which bears the same name. Taioha’e is also also the regional capital. The local population is famed for the warm and friendly welcome it gives visitors to this rugged island. Rich in archeological sites and ancient legends Nuku Hiva is home to a thriving ancestral culture.\n\nDiscover\n\nHiva Oa\n\nHiva Oa is known as the ‘garden of the Marquesas Islands’ because of its very fertile soil and lush vegetation. The intense green countryside hides roads and houses from view. The craggy mountains and deep valleys are home to a multitude of archeological sites and vestiges of an ancient civilization. Among these are the biggest tiki statues in The Islands of Tahiti. The beaches of Hiva Oa are of volcanic black sand and lie in the shade of rocky cliffs. Atuona, the main village, is deep in Taaoa Bay, at the foot of Mount Temetiu, which rises to 1,276 meters and Mount Fe’ani which is 1,016 meters high. The village cemetery is the last resting place of the artist Paul Gauguin and the singer Jacques Brel.\n\nDiscover\n\nUa Pou\n\nThere are four immense basalt pillars in Ua Pou, two of which, Poutetaunui and Poumaka reach high into the sky. In 1888, Robert Louis Stevenson described them as two ‘volcanic arrows like church bell-towers’. They are said to represent ancient warriors and they stand guard over the island’s main village of Hakahau in the bay below.\n\nDiscover\n\nUa Huka\n\nUa Huka is reputed for its dry soil and magnificent countryside. Wild horses gallop around on the arid plains and wild goats climb the slopes and ridges of this mystical island. Ua Huka is unspoiled and authentic, a land where the ancestors are part of the everyday life of the islanders.\n\nDiscover\n\nTahuata\n\nAccessible only from the sea, Tahuata is a haven of peace and tranquility, full of pleasant surprises for the visitor. A mountainous island with fertile valleys and crystal clear waters, where the local inhabitants earn their living by selling superb sculptures in bone or miro (rosewood). They also produce mono’i, the famous Tahitian oil extracted from dried coconuts and perfumed with flowers such as the tiare Tahiti or frangipani.\n\nFatu Hiva\n\nFatu Hiva is the most isolated of the inhabited islands in the archipelago. Accessible only from the sea, it is a small, but beautiful island with high mountains and lush green valleys. In 1937, Thor Heyerdahl and his wife exchanged their modern lifestyle for the natural authenticity of Fatu Hiva. It was here that he developped his erroneous theory that the Polynesians originally migrated to these islands from South America. The inhabitants live close to the village of Omoa, where they make traditional tapa cloth from the bark of the mulberry tree. One of the most picturesque sites in the South Pacific is the ‘Bay of Virgins’ at Hanavave, where the setting sun makes the mountain peaks glow like burning embers.\n\nNot to be missed\n\nWhat to do in the Marquesas Islands\n\nRugged and mystical, the Marquesas Islands are a land where the ancestral culture thrives to this day.
