        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn 1999, the Polynesian Voyaging Society launched it’s most difficult sail to date, to Rapa Nui at the far southeastern corner of the Polynesian Triangle. To get there Hōkūle‘a sailed southeast to Nukuhiva in the Marquesas Islands, then to Pitcairn and Mangareva, then into the southeasterly trades to Rapa Nui, one of the most isolated islands in the world. (See “The Voyage to Rapa Nui” at the Polynesian Voyaging Society website.) The escort boat Kamahele under Captain Alex Jakubenko, with his wife Elsa, and crew accompanied the canoe from Hawai‘i to Rapa Nui and back.\n\nBefore departing for Pitcairn and Mangareva, Captain-Navigator Chad Baybayan wanted to share Hōkūle‘a with the inhabited islands of the Marquesas, starting with the northern group, besides Nukuhiva, Ua Pou and Ua Huka; then the three southern islands of Tahuata, Fatu Hiva, and Hiva Oa. From Hiva Oa, the crew headed south for Mangareva. I joined the crew for two weeks in the Marquesas to help document this small portion of the historic voyage.\n\nTaiohae, Nukuhiva\n\nJuly 26: The Hōkūle‘a crew for the leg to Mangareva arrived at Nukuhiva Airport. Tava Taupu and others from the first crew met the new crew at the airport. In the hills above the airport, Tava had arranged a greeting by Marquesan schoolchildren at a summer camp. The children presented traditional songs and dances; the bananas and grapefruit were ‘ono.\n\nThe drive from the airport to Taiohae, where Hōkūle‘a is anchored on the west side of the bay, takes three hours by dirt and rock roads over mountains and across the central plateau called Tovii. The hills were being planted with pines for forestry, replacing the native flora, one of the native trees related to Hawai‘i’s ‘ōhi‘a lehua.\n\nFrom the heights of Mouake, the road winds down to the U-shaped bay of Taiohae, opening to the south, with Ua Pou on the horizon, 20 miles away. Above the bay, at Mouake Pass, veteran crew member Tava, a native of Taiohae who lives in Hawai‘i, points out a kuku, an endangered native pigeon, flying across the valley.\n\nBefore departure from Taiohae for Ua Pou, scheduled for August 2, the crew has been working on canoe repairs. They are redoing the battens on two canvas sleeping compartments nicknamed “The Swamp” and “Niagara Falls” on the first leg. Batteries for radio and running lights were not recharging, so Aldon Kim is working on the electrical system. Gary Yuen, Mona Shintani, and Mel Paoa are building a new toilet seat for the canoe. Hōkūle‘a will be in top shape for its sail through the Marquesas and beyond, thanks to the hard-working first crew.\n\nJuly 28: the crew celebrates crew member Gary Suzuki’s birthday with barbequed goat, a Marquesan delicacy. The goat was shot last week by Kimitete Kamehameha and another Marquesan. Crew members T. Gilliom, R. Amimoto, and K. Hoe helped pack the goat out of a remote valley on the north side.\n\nJuly 29: the crew loaded water and supplies under quartermaster Moana Doi.\n\nJuly 30: Captain-Navigator C. Baybayan conducted on-board training for the new crew.\n\nJuly 31: The crew prepped for a thank-you pā‘ina for their hosts in Taiohae. On the menu was a pig to be roasted in an imu.\n\nTava dug an imu on the beach to kalua the pig.\n\nA multilingual camp has been set up at Nuku a Hoe Canoe Clubhouse, Marquesan, Hawaiian, English, and French spoken. Mona, from Ni‘ihau, talks in Hawaiian in his sleep. The canoe club is training for the paddling race across Hawai’i’s Kaiwi channel in October. We watched a video shot by Attwood “Maka” Makanani of the voyage from Hawai‘i to Nukuhiva, scenes of the crew under Captain-Navigator Bruce Blankenfeld catching an ono, searching for land, sighting Eiao in morning rain squalls.\n\nCultural exchanges: D. Antone taught a Hawaiian song and Maka a chant to children at the school next to the canoe club. Maka has carved stones to present as gifts to the Nuku a Hoe canoe club and the school next to their club house.\n\nThree crew members got Marquesan tattoos.\n\nTava took Cat Fuller, Kaniela Akaka, and me on a journey through his childhood and family traditions in the valley of Pakiu, Kaniela recording the talk on video. We walked up a six-foot-wide stone path, the ancient road that ascends up a ridge to Mouake Pass and across the central plateau to all parts of the island. Paepae (stone house foundations) line the trail. We stopped at the me’ae (temple) of Pakoko, famous Marquesan warrior and ancestor of Tava, four generations ago. Pakoko led the Marquesan resistance to the French during his time. On a stone above a stream, Tava pointed out where an ancestress bathed in the blood of a Frenchman who had raped her, after the rapist was killed by Pakoko.\n\nAugust 2: The planned daytime departure of Hōkūle‘a to Ua Pou, was delayed till midnight tonight. An ARGOS transponder for tracking the canoe and a charger for a Betacam that would be used to document the voyage came in on a flight from Pape’ete to Nukuhiva yesterday, but was stuck at the airport because the delivery truck broke down. The airport closes for the night and doesn’t open till the next flight comes in at 11 the following morning. Ro’o Kimitete, the mayor of Taiohae, was going to the airport to pick up his wife Deborah, who was returning from Pape’ete on the morning flight, so he offered to pick up the equipment and bring it to Taiohae.\n\nOur camera man Hugh came out to the escort boat Kamahele with the charger in hand; it made the 2.5 hour journey over the mountains safely. It was too late in the day to depart for Hakahau, Ua Pou, as the five-hour sail would take us into the harbor at nightfall, too dangerous in an unfamiliar place. Captain-Navigator Baybayan has decided to sail at midnight tonight and arrive at the harbor at dawn.\n\nThe new plan was a plus for the crew, as we would be sailing at night under the stars—a good time to orient the new crew members to navigating by celestial bodies. The nights have been mostly clear, full of stars, with passing trade-wind clouds. The Milky Way stretches from the Southern Cross setting in the west to Vega and Altair rising in the east. Musca, the Pointers, Atria in the Southern Triangle, Maui’s Fishhook (Scorpio), and the Peacock appear in the Southern sky over the ocean at the mouth of Taiohae Bay. The Milky Way is known as the Shark in some parts of Polynesia and Maui’s fishhook is set in it. The navigators have been studying their southern pointers—pairs of stars that point to the South Celestial Pole, which is 9 degrees above the horizon in Taiohae (but below the horizon in Hawai’i.)\n\nThe plan is to pull up two of the three anchors at 4 p.m., have dinner at 6 (final farewells) and rest on the canoe before getting under way at midnight, when the last anchor will be pulled. The crew members who have been here since the canoe arrived three weeks ago from Hawai‘i have been adopted by the community and feel like they are leaving home again. Many thanks to Nuku a Hoe Canoe Club for hosting the crew at their club house and the rest of the community of Taiohae for their support. The crew has been well cared for.\n\nWinds have been easterly trades at 10-15 knots for the whole week. Today the winds are E by S, a good wind to get the canoe to Ua Pou. Captain Baybayan received an invitation to visit from the mayor of Vaitahu on Tahuata, so we will be anchoring there rather than at Hana moe noa when we travel to that island in the Southern Marquesan group. The village of Vaitahu has a canoe building project going.\n\nA voyage is a lei of greetings and farewells. The mayor Ro’o Kimitete and his wife Deborah came to say farewell. Ro’o chanted in honor of Tanaoa, god of the ocean. The crew was presented with tiare leis, then departed to sleep on the canoe. Most the the crew members give their lei to Hōkūle‘a, realizing that it’s not the individual crew members who were being honored at the farewell, but the canoe. It was a time to reflect on all who sailed her over the last 25 years, who had made her famous throughout Polynesia, particularly the crew of the first voyage in 1976, who ventured out into the unknown with navigator Mau Piailug. It’s hard to believe a generation has passed; crew member Mona Shintani is the nephew of Hōkūle‘a first captain, Kawika Kapahulehua. Deborah recalled that she was in France when Hōkūle‘a arrived in Tahiti, but her father told her about the arrival, and she saw photographs of the thousands who came out to greet the canoe after the historic voyage.\n\nWe left Taiohae Bay at 4 am on August 3, so we would arrive in Hakahau, Ua Pou, at about 10 am for a welcome ceremony.\n\nUa Pou\n\nAugust 3: Ua Pou is famous for its spires of stone that rise hundreds of feet from the sea on ridges above the town…no other sight like it in the world.\n\nA dance group greeted the canoe. The leader of the group, Petrano Toti, took the crew on a short tour of the island, south of Hakahau, to the Valley of the King, a place that is kapu after the first and only king of Ua Pou who lived there passed away. He is considered a god so after he died, no one can live in the valley. The paepae of his house is still intact—a large stone platform in the middle of the bushes off the side of the road.\n\nToti tells us the story of Makaianui, the pig demi-god of the Marquesas and how once when the islanders were starving, a tuhuna called out to the pig god and the pig arrived with aku all over his body, having bitten onto his bristles. He shook his body and the aku fell off to feed the people. The pig god sacrificed his own body as well to feed the people.\n\nA version of the story of Makaianui appears in Von den Steinem’s Marquesan Myths (32-35):\n\nAka-ui (Polynesian: Raka, the wind god; Hawaiian: La’amaomao) lives at Hanapaaoa, on the north side of Hiva Oa. He goes to Ua Pou and exchanges names (becomes friends) with Toa’etini (“Many Tropic Birds”; Hawaiian “Koa’e-kini”). But Toa’etini has no pork to offer him…the pig in the imu has already been eaten, only the skull is left. (In the oral version we got on Ua Pou, the storyteller says Toa’etini boasted that he could bring a pig back to life from bones…i.e., that it would have flesh on it; but when the imu was open, the people found only bones.) When Toa’etini calls on his birds to bring fish and water, and his rat to bring kava, Akaui kills the birds and the rat to humiliate his host (because his host cannot provide for his guest). Then he tells Toa’etini that his pig Manaiaanui (Makaiaanui on Nukuhiva) is well fed. He tells Toa’etini to chop wood and dig an imu. Then he calls out to Manaiaanui in Hanapaaoa on Hiva Oa. The pig swims across the ocean to Ua Pou. “Flocks of birds and fishing boats follow the swimming pig and the sea moves like a school of bonito fish [aku].”\n\nWhen Manaiaanui arrives, Akaui tells him to die, and the pig dies and is cooked and eaten. Akaui takes the head, the choicest part, another humiliation to his host. When Akaui takes up his kava cup, Toa’etini tries to get even by telling the daughters of Pahua-Titi to piss in Akaui’s cup as they swing from a pua tree on Te-Ava, the central peak of Ua Pou. Akaui sees them pissing in his cup and throws his cup away. Angry, he sends two of his warriors back to Hanapaaoa to get two stone balls. When they return, he calls for kava again; when the girls try to urinate in his cup again, his warriors hurl the stones at the branch they are swinging from, the branch breaks, and they fall to their deaths. Then Akaui returns to Hanapaaoa and weeps for his pig.\n\nEditor Jennifer Terrell interprets this story as a nature allegory: Aka-ui, the wind god, brings pigs (metaphorically life-giving rain clouds) on the ESE trade winds from Hiva Oa to Ua Pou, particularly during the winter wet season; Toaetini represents the dry season, when there is less food available; the two girls are the clouds that hover at the tops of the mountains and sprinkle only lightly.\n\nOn the way back to the harbor, Petrano went into the lush roadside vegetation to cut a bunch of bananas as a gift for the departing canoe.\n\nWe left Ua Pou for Ua Huka in the morning.\n\nHane, Ua Huka\n\nAugust 4: On the sail to Ua Huka, Tava told me that the story of Makaianui explains the mana of pig bristles tied onto aku lures. Aku lures in both Hawai’i and the Marquesas have pig bristles on them. The bristles attract the aku.\n\nHōkūle‘a arrived at 11 a.m. at Hane, a small bay on the southern coast of Ua Huka, the easternmost island of the northern Marquesan group.\n\nHane Bay extends back into a valley with a small village and coconuts palms growing up the slopes of steep mountains behind it. The island is a large crater, the southern half of which has fallen into the ocean, the northern rim still intact.\n\nWe were greeted by Leon Lichtle, the mayor of Ua Huka, and taken on a tour of the southern coast. When we returned, a dance group performed a dance of canoe building and a song praising the valleys of the island.\n\nWe departed early in the evening for Tahuata in the southern Marquesan group, 65 miles away.\n\nNOTES ON UA HUKA: The bay of Hane where we landed on August 4 is where Dr. Yoshihiko Sinoto of the Bishop Museum found pottery fragments from an early Polynesian settlement, c. 250-300 AD. It is the earliest archaeological site in the Marquesas so far.\n\nThe road along the southern coast runs from Hane to Vaipaee, winding along the steep sea cliffs (no guard rails). The landscape is mainly dry grass lands, where wild horses and goats roam, cut through by lush green valleys where streams flow down from the northern mountains. On the way to Vaipaee we stopped at a botanical garden with plants from all over the world. Mayor Lichtle said that they have been experimenting with plants (e.g. orange trees) to find those that might grow well for commercial purposes on Ua Huka. In Vaipaee, we visited a museum which displayed some original and some reproductions of Marquesan artifacts.\n\nVaitahu, Tahuata\n\nAugust 5: Hōkūle‘a anchored in the morning in Vaitahu, a small bay and village on the leeward side of Tahuata, the smallest populated island in the Marquesas, with 19 sq. miles and 600-700 inhabitants.\n\nWe left Hane, Ua Huka, at 6 pm yesterday; the projected 13-hour sail to Tahuata turned into a 20.5-hour sail and tow. During the night, the canoe made a course of Hema (South) and was set 32 miles WNW of Tahuata by the ESE tradewinds and the west-flowing current. We picked up the tow from escort boat Kamahele at 6 am and were towed for 8 1/2 hours, into Vaitahu, anchoring at about 2:30 pm.\n\nAt Vaitahu, we were greeted by the mayor and a dance and drum group of schoolchildren; had an excellent meal at the mayor’s house—raw and cooked fish, raw and cooked ‘a‘ama crab, pork, chicken, breadfruit, kalo, etc. We spent the night on the canoe. A wind gusted out of the valley all night, coming down the steep mountains at the back of the valley. The shade-rain tarps flapped wildly each time a gust blew. The bottom of the bay is steep so anchors don’t hold well. The crew had to reset the anchors at 3 am. Today the crew will tour the town and then go in boats to visit Hapatoni valley a few miles down the coast.\n\nThe bay of Vaitahu is rich in fauna. Just offshore as we approached, we saw piles of aku birds off the starboard side. Fisherman Terry Hee landed some āholehole and akule from the canoe last night with a light rod and reel. Gary Yuen fried them for breakfast—‘ono! Some ulua were swimming around the canoe last night, as well as the ubiquitous mano (shark). Tava says that the Marquesans never swim for recreation as the waters around all the islands are shark-infested, but fishing from canoes and boats and diving are part of the people’s livelihood. A school of porpoises feeds in the bay—they look smaller and darker than the porpoises in Hawai’i. This morning, while we were preparing breakfast, a lone ‘iwa bird soared above, fishing the bay. He dropped his fish in mid-air then swooped down to catch it in its sharp beak again; Tava said the ‘iwa did this to kill the fish.\n\nAugust 6: This afternoon the crew went by boat to Hapatoni, which is situated on a narrow strip of land beneath the cliffs south of Vaitahu. Hapatoni has no cars, and there is no road in. The crew was greeted by the school children with dances and a meal of fish and fruit. The newly-formed Hōkūle‘a dance troupe (M. Doi, C. Fuller, N. Wilson, and A. Polo), with musicians K. Akaka and D. Antone, responded with “Hi’ilawe” and “Aloha Kaua’i.” In the village, Mel Paoa met more of the Paoa family, which has spread throughout Polynesia.\n\nCaptain Baybayan plans to depart Vaitahu this afternoon before sunset. Maka will present the mayor with a stone petroglyph of the canoe as a farewell gift. We will arrive tomorrow morning in Fatu Hiva, the southernmost of the Marquesas Islands and spend a day there, then depart before sunset for Hiva Oa, our final stop at these emerald mountains rising out of the sea. We should arrive in Hiva Oa on Sunday morning.\n\nWe left Vaitahu at 5 pm. Hōkūle‘a was towed by Kamahele down the leeward coast of Tahuata, close to shore, so the crew could say goodbye to the people of Hapatoni, which they visited earlier in the day. The rock spires of Ua Pou, protruding like fingers from the horizon, were visible one house north of the setting sun.\n\nA flock of about thirty noio (noddy terns) appeared, flapping out of the sun, returning home; ‘iwa (frigate birds) circled above the steep mountainside covered with hau, coconut, mango, banyan and a few albizzia trees, their vibrant greens tinged with orange sunlight. A few goats climbed a cliff. Our hunter Aldon Kim swore one day he would be back for them.\n\nAs Hōkūle‘a approached Hapantoni at sunset, Maka, Kealoha, and Kaniela let loose some blasts of their pū (conch shells), and the children and parents came out to wave goodbye.\n\nTava Taupu stood on the navigator’s platform and started shouting: “Aloha nui! I love you! Kaoha nui ia outou! Eo Nukuhiva! Eo Vaitahu! Eo Hapatoni! Eo Hawai’i!”\n\nTava has been rejuvenated by his visit to his homeland. Earlier in Vaitahu he met a childhood friend. When he left in the sixties there were no cars and airplanes, only horses and boats. “Aloha nui! I love you! Kaoha nui ia outou!” he shouted again, one arm raised and waving goodbye. His voice echoed and faded in the darkening mountainside. We were towed out of sight of the villagers. When we turned the southern end of Tahuata, the wind and seas came at us again.\n\nHōkūle‘a towed through the night to Fatu Hiva, as tacking there would be too time-consuming for the tight schedule. We approached the island before dawn under a waning crescent moon, and anchored by 8 am. The small bay is spectacular, with huge monolithic stones towering overhead.\n\nHanavave, Fatu Hiva\n\nFatu Hiva, the southernmost island of the Marquesas, has even fewer people than Tahuata–about 300. No one told the villagers we were coming, but they were happy to host Hōkūle‘a and Kamahele. The children and their parents began lining the shore. The women brought flowers and leaves and began making waist bands, head dresses, and lei for a dance performance.\n\nThe mayor greeted us at his house, and invited us to a dinner at 7 pm. The crew hiked with some of the children up to Vai-Ee, a 100-foot waterfall at the back of the valley.\n\nOn the way up, we saw petroglyphs.\n\nTava disappeared on his own to explore the valley, and when he came back, he was wearing a head-wreath of ferns.\n\nWhen we returned to the canoe, the children swam out to the canoe and hung out, eating peanut butter and crackers from the supplies on board.\n\nThe crew helped prep the food for the evening.\n\nAt 6:30 the 100 or so villagers began showing up with food at the tables set up near the shore. After dinner, six musicians and about 24 dancers, men and women, boys and girls broke out in dance, the beating drums booming in the still night air; the backdrop was coconut trees and pitch black cliffs, with the Southern Cross, the Pointers, Maui’s Fishhook, and the Milky Way arching overhead.\n\nNotes on Vai-Ee Waterfall at the Back of Valley of Hanavave\n\nThe crew visited this waterfall and some of the brave practiced lele kawa (cliff jumping) from a ledge 40 feet above the pool. They saw a freshwater eel swimming in the pool. (The children who came with us kept shouting, “There’s an eel in the pool!”) A legend tells of Koee-iti (“small eel”), who lives under this waterfall, which feeds the large clear stream called Uiha that empties into the bay. Various versions of this legend can be found in Von den Steinen’s Marquesan Myths (1-5):\n\nKoee-iti (small eel), who lives under the waterfall Vai-Ee in Hanavave, went to visit Koee-nui (“large eel”). who lived in a cave beneath the waterfall of Kuenui in Taipivai (or the waterfall in Hakaui) on Nukuhiva. The small eel ate only flowers and fruit; the big eel ate pig and human flesh. The small eel boasted of his home and his food supply and lured the big eel to Hanavave. The small eel swam up the stream of Uiha; the big eel followed and got stuck. The people of Hanavave then killed the eel, cut it up, and ate it.\n\nThe story may record a battle between a large number of warriors from Nukuhiva in the Northern Marquesas and a small number of warriors from Fatu Hiva in the Southern Marquesas (in one version the small eel is from Tahauku on Hiva Oa, the largest island in the Southern Marquesas). The warriors of Fatu Hiva apparently ambushed the Nukuhiva warriors in the narrow valley of Hanavave. In one version, the fantastic upcroppings of rocks that line the valley of Hanavave are said to be the remains of the big eel.\n\nHanavave is one of the few places in the Marquesas where the water is drinkable for outsiders, as it comes from a mountain spring rather than an open stream. The children of the village seemed unafraid of swimming in the clear, shallow near-shore waters of the bay; elsewhere people seem to fear the water because of the large number of tiger and hammerhead sharks that live near shore in the nearly reef-less islands.\n\nAtuona, Hiva Oa\n\nAugust 10: We left Fatu Hiva in the morning and anchored in Atuona, Hiva Oa, in the afternoon.\n\nThe winds were 10-12 knot easterlies until we came abreast of Terihi, a small jagged island off of Mohotani, when stronger winds hit the canoe from a fast-moving squall off the starboard side.\n\nWe closed sails until the squall passed, then reopened the sails and continued on with brisker winds. As we approached Hiva Oa, the Kamahele towed us into Atuona harbor.\n\nAugust 11: The freight ship Aranui from Pape‘ete arrived in Hiva Oa early this morning carrying crew member Kamaki Worthington and supplies for the sail to Mangareva. A second shipment leaving Pape’ete on August 13 will go to Mangareva for the voyage to Rapa Nui. The crew unloaded the supplies from the container and took them up to the house of Robert O’Connor to re-pack the food before loading it onto the canoe this afternoon and tomorrow.\n\nThe crew also cleaned the hulls and deck and did minor repair work. Robert & Ziella ‘Oconnor hosted the crew for dinner last night. Robert is president of the Kua Moehau canoe club of Atuona.\n\nWeather: winter rains; hot, humid days; chilly nights. Hōkūle‘a plans to leave Atuona on August 12 or August 13, weather permitting.\n\nAugust 12: Hōkūle‘a‘s crew finished packing the food into the hulls of the canoe and made their last minute preparations for departure, which has been pushed out a day or two.\n\nThe day was spent on a sightseeing trip to Puamau on the NE coast, at the far eastern end of Hiva Oa, where the me’ae (heiau) of Ipona is located. Puamau mayor Bernard Heitaa gave us a tour of the grounds, which includes the largest stone tiki in French Polynesia.\n\nThere was also a large, flat fish-shaped stone; a sacrificial stone; and a flat-topped stone for preparing the ink for traditional tattoos—all beneath towering breadfruit trees and a gigantic stone cliff.\n\nHeitaa said that the people of Puamau believe that people migrated to Rapa Nui from this valley. He said that his family was not originally from Puamau, but came from a more remote valley that was abandoned when the young people left for places such a Puamau and Atuona.\n\nThe drive from Atuona to Puamau was over an unpaved road, carved into the rugged Marquesan mountains and cliffs by the machines of Caterpillar, Case, Komatsu, Hyundai, Volvo, and Mercedes. Toyota 4-wheel drives rule out there. The 12-mile drive took about 3 hours. The eventual paved road will no doubt be another victory for the multinationals, determined to spread modern culture into one of the wildest, remotest terrains on the planet.\n\nWeather: for the past 24 hours, the weather has been poor. 90% cloud cover, with frequent squalls. The winds have picked-up a few knots as well, blowing in the 15-20 kt range. Accompanying this weather has been a substantial south by south-west swell. Some local kids have been taking advantage of the good surf in the bay of Atuona.\n\nAugust 13: Hokule’a’s departure from Atuona for Mangareva was delayed another day to wait for better weather. In the afternoon, the crew visited ‘Ohua Upeke at Ta‘aoa Village, southwest of Atuona on Ta‘aoa Bay. ‘Ohua Upeke is the largest archaelogical site in French Polynesia, formerly a me’ae, or religious center, with stone walls platforms (paepae) and tiki.\n\nThe plan now is to leave for Mangareva tomorrow morning at first light. It should take about 18 days to get there, with a stop at Pitcairn. Apprentice navigators Moana Doi and Cat Fuller will hold a course of SE by E for the first segment of the 660-mile voyage. They will backsight on the islands of Hiva Oa and Motane to hold the course as long as land can be seen, lining up Feki Point between Atuona Bay and Tahauku Harbor with the peak of Feani (3300 ft.) above Atuona; then the north end of Motane island and Feani once the canoe passes Motane. The rising sun will also give the navigators a bearing as the canoe departs Atuona.\n\nThe sail plan is different from the plan developed before the crew left Hawai’i. Because of light winds and a schedule that requires the canoe to reach Mangareva by the first week of September to prepare for the push eastward to Rapa Nui, captain-navigator Chad Baybayan decided that instead of sailing NE by E to gain easting toward Pitcairn, the canoe will be towed SE by E into the trade winds to eliminate about 500 miles of tacking. The tow boat Kamahele will be guided without instruments from the canoe by Moana and Cat. At about 16 degrees S and 130 degrees W, the canoe will break the tow and head S by E for Pitcairn, about 540 miles away. At the latitude of Pitcairn (25 degrees S), the canoe will begin a search pattern, tacking SW and NW in 30 mile runs to look for the island. This second segment will be navigated by Baybayan. Once Pitcairn has been sighted, the canoe will either land or head WNW for Mangareva, about 300 miles away (whether or not the canoe anchors and the crew lands on Pitcairn depends on sea conditions). This last portion will be navigated by newly appointed student of navigation Aldon Kim.\n\nLast night in Atuona: a Marquesan dance group named Te Pua o Feani (“The flower of Feani peak”) under the leadership of Patrice Kaimuko hosted the crews of Hōkūle‘a and Kamahele for dinner. They performed a revived form of Marquesan dance. The dances were based on traditional Marquesan stories, such as Makaianui (the giant pig) and the creation of Marquesas by a man named Oatea (Hawaiian Wākea) and a woman named Atanua.\n\nAugust 14: the crew departed for Pitcairn and Managreva; I caught a ride to the airport and flew back to Pape’ete.\n\nChad and crew were able to land on Pitcairn, then ended their journey on Mangareva arriving on August 26. There, Chad joined navigators Nainoa Thompson and Bruce Blankenfeld and crew for an incredible 16-day sail navigated into the trades without instruments to Rapanui. (See Chad’s “Journal, Mangareva to Rapa Nui.”) They sighted Rapanui on October 8, 1999.\n\nOn Mangareva, Maka, Hōkūle‘a crew member and stone carver, joined the crew of the escort boat Kamahele.\n\nTravels with the Polynesian Voyaging Society\n\nOn Hōkūle‘a, from Tahiti to Rā‘iātea (1992): on a sail from Tahiti island to the marae of Taputapuātea on Rā‘iātea\n\nOn Hawai‘iloa, from Vancouver to Juneau (1995): a journey to Native Alaska on Hawai‘iloa, a voyaging canoe made from logs donated by Native Alaskans\n\nMarquesas Island Journal (1999); journal of a voyage to the six islands of the Marquesas\n\nOn Hōkūle’a, Uwajima to Yokohama (2007)\n\nOn a Hōkūle’a Training Sail for Teachers to Lāna‘i, Kaho‘olawe, Maui, and Moloka‘i (2010)\n\nPublications and Writings on Polynesian Voyaging\n\n“Introduction to “Voyaging Chiefs of Havai‘i” (1996)”: introduction to the settlement of Polynesia\n\n“The Discovery and Settlement of Polynesia (1999)\n\n“Voyaging Chiefs of Kāne‘ohe Bay” in Storied Landscapes: Hawaiian Literature and Place (1999)\n\n“Crossing Seas” in Local Geography (2004)\n\n“Hōkūle‘a in Yokohama” in Roads of Oku: Journeys in the Heartland (2015)\n\nTravels in the Pacific and on the Pacific Rim\n\n“Journey to the Isles of Hiva” (1993): traveling to Nukuhiva in the Marquesas Islands with an archaeological team from the University of Hawai‘i led by Professor Barry Rolett\n\n“Sanctuary” in Local Geography: Essay on Multicultural Hawai‘i (2004): traveling on the scientific research vessel Rapture in 2000 to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands before they was designated Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument\n\n“Among the Mayan Ruins in the Yucatan” (2000)\n\n“Manila and Beyond” (2006): traveling to the Philippines with a delegation led by Governor Linda Lingle in 2006 to commemorate the centennial of Filipino immigration to Hawai‘i.\n\nPacific Journeys: Home and Away"
