        "text": "When we sailed, we opted for the Cooks Islands as we had been told the the Marquesas Islands were little more than overgrown atolls with limited options. I think the judgement was a little harsh and we plan to visit them when we head back to the islands in '08. However, we did have a great time in Rarotonga and I did a lot of shopping due to the strength of the USD against the AUZD. Also had the best fish and chips of my life there. We walked into town, visited the college and just had a blast with the locals.\n\nWe went the first part of January and managed to catch just the tail end of a typhoon. It resulted in about three days of rain the first part of the cruise, with sunny weather the rest of the trip. Everyone had warned about a possibly rocky trip to Rarotonga and the reality that you can't always tender in due to the wave action (it was pretty rocky getting back on board). That's also something to consider because it's a day out and back -\n\nhope this helps!\n\nCharlie\n\nWe did the Cook islands, but only saw them from the ship. We were on the 2-18-06 cruise. Our cruise was not able to tender in Rarotonga and they hadn't since 12-24-065. Keep this in mind since it will be the same time of year. We had great weather. we did have some showers on and off. It is hot and humid, so the rain was sometimes a welcomed treat!\n\nYou'll have a great time with either itenerary!\n\nI did the Marquesas itinerary in November and I would not do that one again. I did not enjoy the Marquesan islands we visited. In fact, the first one (Nuku Hiva), the local people did not care for us much. And there's really nothing to do on the Marquesan islands. They are not snorkeling islands, they are very mountainous. And I found them to have more and heavier rain. In fact we had to leave the second isladn (Hiva Oa) early due to a bad storm. I'd definitely opt for the Cook one next time.\n\nWe had a wonderful time in the Marquesas. You can read our review and see pictures at our website www.thepreismans.com\n\nSince we took a wonderful private tour in Nuku Hiva, it was just wonderful. We went to these islands to see what French Polynesia was like in its primitive early years. We did see what it was like. The people were wonderful to us. A major plus to the Marquesas itinerary is that you get to go to Rangiroa, which has great beaches, diving and snorkeling. The Marquesas don't. The Cook Island itinerary appears to have the better islands and I would like to do that one also; but I am really glad I did the Marquesas, since it is quite unique.\n\nI don't know which Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa you naysayers went to, but we loved the Marquesan stops and the Rangiroa stop. One of our dive buddies was a professional instructor and he said Hiva Oa was the best dive he had been on in years (as in hundreds of dives)!!\n\nI'll give the names of the two local operators if anyone wants (there are only one on each island, and Eric on Hiva Oa only opened in Dec, the first operator there ever.) We were swimming and playing with the mantas, who were curious but not afraid, for 30 minutes. One great photo was so close up the entire frame is a manta eye!\n\nhttp://www.marquises.pf/pagestour/2page108.html\n\nAnd a group snorkleing right in the Hivo Oa harbor ran into three hammerheads and a manta...snorkling. The people who stayed on the ship reported feeding a hammerhead and dolphins right from the sun deck!\n\nAnd then there is Rangiroa. Not only the world famous diving and snorkling, but the best place for black pearls, bar none.\n\nAs for Nuku Hiva, I suggest reading Melville's Typee en route there. You'll see the same places he was. It is truly awesome. And I found the people very friendly, but a little shy. You had to approach them and a few words (please, hello, thank you, etc) in their own language made me a near celebrity.\n\nNo problem. Here is the English website for the Nuku hiva operator. The are a class operation, although not so fancy, this is the Marquesas (you'll see what I mean). A very comfortable dive boat and all their equipment was in great shape. Same one in the above post. Also, their e-mail address ison the site, either Xavier or Marie will respond. (We had a 2 tank dive). Remember, cash only at these places. They are still not plastic oriented.:rolleyes:\n\nhttp://www.marquises.pf/pagestour/2page108.html\n\nAlso, a general site for Marquesas tourism.\n\nhttp://www.go-to-tahiti.com/islands/marquesas/description.asp\n\nEric on Hiva Oa does not have a site, he is really small and just started in November. I have his phone number here somewhere, just can't put my hands on it now. However, the Centre Plongee Marquesas know him well. I suggest when you e-mail the Centre, you ask them to assist you in reserving Eric on Hiva Oa. They will gladly help. At first glance, Eric's operation looks suspect, but all his stuff was new: he even had to take one of the loaner shorties out of the package!! And very professional and knowledgeable.:)\n\nAs for the snorkeling, they were just on their own. When you come to the pier, you are in the bay of the only real village on Hiva Oa, with a beach. They just went off the far side of the crescent beach.\n\nHave a great trip.\n\nNo, we didn't do anything on land, as the northeast wind kicked up and they had to recall everyone and close down tendering. The villagers did put on a show for a large group, but it was while we were diving. There were a few cars when we first arrived, I think you needed to arrange them ahead. You can find the phone numbers in Jan prince's Tahiti book. No car rentals, just private car owners making a little money on the side.\n\nSeveeral great hikes start right in town, if they are hikers."
