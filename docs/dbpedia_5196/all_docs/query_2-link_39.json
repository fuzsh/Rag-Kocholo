        "text": "THE ANCHOR COMES OFF THE BOTTOM FINALLY\n\nOh, it is hard to leave a lovely anchorage, but there is always something new to see around the corner. We finally defeated INERTIA and lifted the anchor out of the sandy bottom of Anaho Bay in search of Nuku Hiva’s west coast. The sail down the islands north coast was idyllic. Gentle trades with the swell running behind us. The dramatic high mountains of the coast as back ground. We sailed on by the islands airport and tucked into an tiny cove on the north west point, Haahopu Bay.\n\nNuku Hiva’s dramatic north coast\n\nWHY STOP THERE?\n\nBefore the construction of the road, the only way to get to the airport on the north coast of this island was by boat. Haahopu Bay was a busy port for travelers and workers alike. But now the wharf and all its amenities have fallen in disrepair. The bay a silent, but beautifully sheltered, little anchorage. Coming here is still fun!\n\nCOOL BEACH\n\nThis little cove, on the northern tip of the island’s west coast, is really very small. If you plan to anchor here do not bring more than one other mate. But you will be rewarded with a very sheltered anchorage and a great white sandy beach. The rocky points either side of the cove block any swell from entering so the waters inside are perfectly calm. The high mountain ranges of the islands interior steal all the moisture from the predominate easterly trade winds making the west coast very arid. But this does mean there is no rain water run off and therefore crystal clear waters. We could not only see our anchor and chain clearly in 8m of water, but the sting rays below hunting in the sand for food.\n\nLOTS OF FUN\n\nDo not get me wrong. This is a tiny cove in an arid part of the island. But there are some fun things to get up to. The locals and fisherman obviously agree with me. There are several camps set up on the beach area with tables, fire pits and even grills. I assume the beach is a happening place on the weekends.\n\nThe poor old wharf is looking ‘worst for wear’ but it is also a grave yard for old JCBs, so have a little fun climbing about in them. The surf is light here, so it is also a great swimming beach. We did not get out snorkeling, but I am sure the rocky points would be lots of fun.\n\nAbandon JCB near the wharf\n\nMuch too tempting for at least one of the humans to resist\n\nOn the wharf with Spirit of Argo in the back ground\n\nNOT STAYING LONG\n\nWe have ‘dragged our heels’ for much too long, so we are not staying more than an evening. But we had heard from Kevin (Yacht Services Nuku Hiva) there is another lovely anchorage on this west coast. Onward James!\n\nEND"
