        "text": "Background: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuku_Hiva_Campaign\n\nWI Congress accepted Porter's action and US annexed the islands?\n\nSince, at the time European explorers estimated the population to be 100,000+ around that time, it proves the islands could support that much people.\n\nCould Washington Islands today be a US territory/state with a population of 150-200,000 (or even more) with a large European-descendant and Euronesian (mixed European-Polynesian) segment? I guess it would resemble Hawaii, in a having lots of Asians and large tourism sector etc. I guess the earliest white settlers would have hailed from New England, whence Porter would've recruited colonists. It would be awesome if Madisonville (actual Taiohae with a population of few thousand) could be skyscraper city with 100,000+ people. and if WI were admitted to the Union as a state there could theoretically be a US president born there..\n\nAssuming that things go better for the US on Nuku Hiva, and they maintain a presence post 1814? Well, first off, I suspect that Congress will be wary over the idea of such a territory , one fundamentally different from existing territories in the continental US, which were seen more as a mere transitional phase to statehood. There was apparently unpleasant talk of Porter's action in Congress, and of of his \"empire building\". I think it's more likely to see a protectorate established, rather than a formal annexation and transition into a territory, though by the latter half of the 19th century, that would likely change.\n\nI don't foresee much 19th or early 20th century migration from the mainland - aside from serving as a resupply and repair station for American vessels, the islands will likely be an ignored backwater, with whites limited to a small populace near the main port and perhaps some missionaries. Perhaps there might be a few sporadic attempts at developing plantations there for tropical crops at the turn of the century, as an alternative to Central and South American imports, but I don't see that spurring large scale white settlement.\n\nSo a large populace would have to come predominantly from natives - looking at other small tourism oriented islands in the South Pacific, I doubt modern emigration from the mainland would suffice to bring a hypothetical state composing all of the Marquesas Islands up to 200,000 people. The populace of the islands shrank drastically over the course of the 19th century, due in large part of Peruvian slave raids and smallpox epidemics. It's possible that the presence of even a small US naval squadron could deter the slave raids, and as for smallpox, inoculation was well known to doctors of the time. It's possible that an immunization campaign could be carried out, which would help cut back on the population decline.\n\nAs for statehood, it seems unlikely - perhaps if American control extends across a large swath of Polynesia, you'll have have a sufficiently large population that \"Pacifica\" could become a state, but the Marquesas alone would likely be too small. Even then, nothing guarantees that these clusters of islands would want to be merged into one entity - some of the OTL Pacifica proposals, which would have combined Guam, the North Marianas Islands, American Samoa, and the Pacific Trust Territories in an attempt to reach a more palatable size for admission, foundered on these grounds."
