        "text": "The final port of our 35-day South Pacific Cruise was Nuku Hiva. This small South Pacific Island was host to the fourth episode of Survivor “Survivor: Marquesas”. Visiting the site where they filmed Survivor is not an option on any readily available excursion.\n\nCruise lines will usually offer the following excursion: Taipivai Valley: Scenic Drive for $140\n\nTaipivai Valley was originally made famous by the American writer and sailor, Herman Melville (1819-1891), who deserted his ship and hid in this valley. Captured by the indigenous natives, he lived there for three weeks — a period during which he observed their way of life. This experience enabled him to write the novel called Typee. This landmark was more recently made famous by being the base camp for the Survivor television show filmed here in 2001. An on-road panoramic drive will lead you through lush vegetation among valleys and great viewpoints. The coastline of this part of the island is breathtaking and ensures you some time for rewarding pictures. You will pass small villages and plenty of churches. Visit the sacred Te A’itua temple and enjoy a refreshment. You’ll continue to Hooumi black sand beach before returning to the pier. Handicrafts are usually available for purchase at Te A’itua or at the beach; bring small denominations of cash, as credit cards are not accepted.\n\nYou can contact Jocelyne Henua EnanaTours at jocelyne@mail.pf and inquire about arranging something similar for a prearranged group. Here is a good blog with additional information about visiting Nuku Hiva.\n\nHere is a video with the highlights of our day on Nuku Hiva\n\nWe anchored about 7:30 am and the tenders were ready to go a little after 8 am. Our plan was to go ashore around noon and visit the large sculpture on Fort Collet, which is on a small rise south of the tender pier and an easy walk, albeit a little uphill.\n\nSnail Rolls were offered on the open decks during our arrival to Nuku Hiva\n\nThe tender ride is short, and the harbor is protected so the ride is usually smooth. Once off the tender, you can expect to be greeted by local citizens dressed in floral attire and enjoy live music from a local band.\n\nNuku Hiva Tender Landing area Nuku Hiva main tourist area\n\nA local band meets all the arriving tenders\n\nDirectly behind the tender dock are a couple of shops selling T-shirts and other souvenirs.\n\nAs you leave the dock you will find a couple of cafés selling drinks and a limited selection of food. A clean and modern restroom is along the right side of the road leading to the small town.\n\nIf you head left along the harbor, you will find a few restaurants, including a Pizza place about ½ mile away. A little off the main road you will find the Notre Dame Cathedral. You will find the He’e Tai Restaurant and museum at the end of the main road. The museum is located behind the restaurant. Look for a sign as the museum is not well marked.\n\nUp the road leaving the tender dock, you pass the new toilets. Off to your right is the main town, with a few public buildings and a school. The uphill path to Fort Collet is about 50 yards off to your right once you are on the main road and is about 125 yards to get to the Sculpture at the top.\n\nThese toilets are new and very modern (2022)\n\nFort Collet was established in 1842, turned over to Catholic missionaries in 1859 and finally to local authorities in 2013. The Tiki Tuhiva sculpture was constructed in 2017, and at 40 feet tall, is the highest contemporary sculpture in the Pacific. The view from here is spectacular and worth your time to make the hike.\n\nThe Zuiderdam at anchor off Nuku Hiva as seen from Fort Collet Tim and Pete enjoying some beers at the local cafe\n\nBefore we headed back toward the tender dock, we stopped by the café to visit with some friends for about an hour while enjoying some cold beer and soft drinks.\n\nThere is a market selling fresh produce next to the cafe\n\nBack on the ship we stopped by the Sea View Pool for our final Sail Away party. The Ocean Bar dance band entertained the crowd as we sailed off toward San Diego.\n\nHere is a short video with some Sail Away Highlights\n\nMaruc Winter, aka The Sandman, put on an amazing show on the World Stage. Pete with “The Sandman”"
