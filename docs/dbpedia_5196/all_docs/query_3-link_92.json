There are on one hand: Nuku Hiva, Ua Pou, Ua Huka, Hatutaa, Eiao and Motu One: the northern islands. And on another hand: Hiva oa, Tahuata, Moho Tani, Fatu Hiva and Motu Nao, the southern islands. Although they differ from other archipelagos, the Marquesas are animated by the same breath and bubbling with creativity. The Polynesian population is true to itself: generous and welcoming. Expect to be greeted by a warm “kaoha nui” at every street corner.",

        "text": "It is in the bay of Puamau, at Me’ae Lipona, that were discovered the largest tikis of Polynesia. Dating from the eighteenth century, they have kept their charm of yesteryear.\n\nAmong them are Maki Taua Pepe, known as the “lying tiki”, is a surprising statue with its posture, broad smile and wide-eyed eyes. It represents a woman who gives birth, which is why it was found on its back at the origin.\n\nThe Tiki Manuiotaa, slimmer, had its head cut and then put back in place by archaeologists.\n\nThe Tiki Te Tovae E Noho, lost its head but retains its original 6 fingers!\n\nTakaii is undoubtedly the biggest tiki of Polynesia. Carved in keetu, red volcanic rock, it is around 2m67 high.\n\nFinally, the Tiki Fau Poe is represented sitting with legs straight and apart, traditional position of women working on the ground. Legend has it that it is Takaii’s wife."
