        "text": "If you’re seeking out an authentic Polynesian experience, try going beyond the much-visited islands of Tahiti, Moorea, and Bora Bora. Tucked away in remote archipelagos, you’ll find castaway islands with pink-hued sands, bright blue lagoons, and fascinating local culture. Stay in family-run Tahitian guesthouses, enjoy fresh home-cooked meals, and get a glimpse into everyday life in the secluded South Pacific.\n\nHere are 11 of our favourite far-flung French Polynesian islands, perfect for a dose of rustic barefoot bliss.\n\n1. Raiatea\n\nNestled in the Society Islands archipelago just north of Tahiti, Raiatea sits on the edge of a huge, protected lagoon that offers some of the best sailing, deep sea fishing, and scuba diving in the South Pacific. For this reason, it’s the top yachting location in French Polynesia.\n\nMany charter companies are based in Raiatea, so if you’re in the market for a sailing adventure, it’s the perfect spot. Raiatea is home to many moorings, making it easy to explore its beautiful calm bays, ancient volcanic craters, and tropical waterfalls. The sailing conditions are excellent, so glide through the Leeward Islands and jump off-board into the turquoise lagoon.\n\nSailing aside, Raiatea holds a special place in local hearts. In Polynesia legend, Raiatea is sacred because it’s believed to be where the Great Polynesian Migration started. It was here that the islanders built simple dugout canoes and sailed towards New Zealand and Hawaii. For this reason, Raiatea is considered the ‘Cradle of Polynesian culture’. Today, you can visit Marae Taputapuatea, the remains of a ruined temple which was a place of pilgrimage for Polynesians from as far as Easter Island.\n\nTowering above the northern part of the island, you’ll also find the extinct volcano, Mount Temehani, which is perfect for hikers. If you trek through the island’s lush interior to the slopes of Mt Temehani, you might even spot the incredibly rare, five-petaled, white Tiare Apetahi flower. Raiatea is the only place in the world that it grows.\n\nTo the south, head to the Fareatai Valley and take a guided jeep safari into the jungle to uncover the huge archaeological site with many ancient petroglyphs (rock etchings). Head to the island’s main market at Uturoa to source local handicrafts like printed pareos (sarongs), necklaces and sculptures.\n\nIf you’re after action, take to the waters of the Faaroa River (French Polynesia’s only navigable river). It’s a great place to try stand-up paddle boarding or kayaking.\n\nGetting to Raiatea\n\nYou can easily reach Raiatea on a 45-minute flight from Papeete. These run daily and the views are magnificent!\n\n2. Taha'a\n\nSharing the same beautiful lagoon, Taha‘a is the little sister island of Raiatea. Taha’a is around half the size of Raiatea and there are just 2.5 miles between them, so they’re very close buddies. You can sail from Raiatea to Taha’a in just 20 minutes, so it’s worth exploring both islands during your trip.\n\nTaha’a is known as the ‘Vanilla Island’ because 80% of French Polynesia’s vanilla is grown. Its lush, fertile valleys and slopes are given over to agriculture, so you’ll see hillside slopes abundant in bananas, watermelon and coconut, and the highly prized Tahitian vanilla orchid. The air here is filled with the sweet earthy scent of vanilla, adding another level of magic to the island.\n\nStunning ivory-coloured beaches surround the island and there are delicate coral gardens just offshore, which you can explore with your snorkel. If you enjoy scenic hikes, there are some lovely walks with views over the lagoon and its sandy motus (tiny islets scattered across the lagoon).\n\nAside from the laid-back Vahine Island Resort and the upscale Le Taha’a Island Resort and Spa, the accommodation here is mostly small Tahitian guesthouses dotted around the lagoon on little motus. The motus surrounding Taha’a are amongst the most beautiful in the French Polynesian islands. Although they’re not exactly cheap, they’re more affordable than the international chains on the main islands.\n\nIf you stay on the northwest coast of Taha’a, you’re promised utterly spectacular views over the familiar twin peaks of Bora Bora. You can enjoy these world-class views from one of the sleepiest spots in the Society Islands, away from the crowds and the eye-watering price tags. Put simply, it’s perfect!\n\nGetting to Taha’a\n\nTaha’a is reached by a short ferry ride over from the airport in Raiatea. Most of the hotels and guesthouses on Taha’a will arrange boat transfers for you, so you’re journey can be simple and worry-free.\n\n3. Huahine\n\nNext to Moorea, you’ll find Huahine, known locally as the ‘Garden of Eden’. This enchanting island is the perfect place for an authentic French Polynesian getaway. Huahine is a tranquil, beautifully manicured island which truly delivers on the promise of offering ‘time out’. The locals take great pride in tending their surroundings, so you’ll find an abundance tropical flowers around every corner. In fact, Huahine is often considered the most beautiful island in French Polynesia.\n\nThe southern of the two islands (Huahine Iti, meaning ’small’), offers the best beaches and a deliciously sleepy pace of life. Don’t expect much in the way of high-end luxury here. Instead, you’ll find comfortable, authentic guesthouses with warm welcomes.\n\nHowever, if you’re looking for a classic overwater bungalow experience, the Royal Huahine offers bungalows with a little more privacy than you can expect in Bora Bora. This makes it ideal for a peaceful, secluded honeymoon.\n\nThe Sunday market in the main town of Fare is a great spot to source local produce and handicrafts and, nearby, you’ll find some of the best surf spots in the South Pacific. We also highly recommend taking an outrigger canoe tour around the island, as you’re guaranteed breathtaking views from the water.\n\nInland, Huahine is home to the largest concentration of ancient temples in French Polynesia, so take a guided archaeology tour to learn about Polynesian history and legend. The locals will tell you how the god Hiro cut the island in two with his canoe, which is why there are now two parts to Huahine, linked by a short bridge.\n\nHuahine derives its name from the Tahitian word ‘vahine’ meaning ‘woman’, and the Polynesia people believe that the island is good for fertility. From Fare, you can see how the mountain ridge resembles the outline of a pregnant woman.\n\nGetting to Huahine\n\nYou can reach Huahine on a 40-minute flight from Papeete. Trust us, it’s worth it!\n\nFakarava is as beautiful below the water as it is above. These pure and calm waters are teeming with tropical marine life, making it superb for snorkelling. Beyond the beaches, you’ll find sleepy villages, friendly locals, and family-run guesthouses. The charm of this place is its seclusion and extraordinary wildlife, so it’s somewhere to soak up the glory of the natural world.\n\nGetting to Fakarava\n\nYou can reach Fakarava by taking a direct flight from Papeete, which takes 1 hour and 10 minutes.\n\n5. Rangiroa\n\nThe lagoon surrounding the atoll of Rangiroa is so big that the entire island of Tahiti could fit within it. The main draw is the marine life, which will simply take your breath away. You’ll often spot wild dolphins jumping in the waves as they play in the passage that links the lagoon to the ocean.\n\nThe clear, calm waters form a haven and nursery for the young, black-tipped sharks that frolic in the shallows by the beaches. Swimming between the islands is completely safe, so get in and join the party!\n\nWhen you’re not in the water, you can enjoy the solitude on the deserted pink beach at ‘Les Sables Roses’, or visit the quaint village and church. You can also take a boat trip to ‘Ile aux Recifs’, where find some impressive, eroded coral formations, or sail across the beautiful blue lagoon, which is surrounded by twelve islands.\n\nFor a glimpse into everyday Polynesian life, hop on a bike and cycle through the local villages. You can also visit a pearl farm to find out how pearls are cultured before choosing your own ‘Jewel of the Ocean’ as a keepsake from your time here.\n\nUniquely, Rangiroa is also home to French Polynesia’s only winery. It’s not open for touring, but you can taste the sweet wine from the harvest at most Tahitian guesthouses and hotels.\n\nGetting to Rangiroa\n\nYou can reach Rangiroa by taking a short one-hour flight from Tahiti.\n\n6. Tikehau\n\nWith a tiny population of 500 people, the low-lying coral islands of Tikehau’s atoll offer a contrasting experience to the mountainous Society Islands. Tikehau consists of many small motus around the edge of the long, broad lagoon. With so many islands making up the atoll, it’s a popular spot for lagoon excursions, diving, snorkelling, and surfing.\n\nTikehau is known for being very natural and authentic. As a result, many visitors return again and again to experience this very special place. This is the kind of island that daydreams are made for, with rare pink-hued beaches formed from corals.\n\nAs you discover Tikehau, you’ll get a strong sense that there’s more to the island than its beaches and coconut trees. Here, you can really sense the Tahitian ‘Mana’, the embracing life force and spirit that surrounds the soul.\n\nOne of the best ways to explore Tikehau is by jumping in a boat and heading to your own private island for the day! You’ll stop en route to catch the fish for your BBQ lunch, and you’ll be able to snorkel above the fishermen diving with spear guns to catch the fish.\n\nYou can stop in at Bird Island, where it’s so safe from predators that the indigenous birds don’t even bother to build nests. Instead, they simply lay their eggs on the tree branches.\n\nWhen it comes to accommodation, think of beautiful seclusion. We recommend spending at least three nights here, as Tikehau’s guesthouses and resorts tend to be very private. In fact, many of them are with many situated on their own islands! If you’re on the main motu, it’s easy to explore at your own pace, as most places have bicycles freely available for their guests to use.\n\nGetting to Tikehau\n\nYou can reach Tikehau by taking a 55-minute flight from Papeete.\n\n7. Ahe\n\nLocated between Rangiroa and Maniti in the Tuamotu Archipelago, Ahe is a tiny atoll that is rarely visited by foreign tourists. This untouched paradise is ideal for a real off-grid island experience and total digital detox. Spend your days picnicking on the shallow sandbanks sprinkled across the lagoon, snorkelling amongst the clouds of pink and orange fish, and visiting the local black pearl farms.\n\nOne of the motus surrounding the lagoon is filled with dense, leafy trees called Pisonia Grandis. This is some of only remaining indigenous forest left in French Polynesia, as settlers cleared the native trees to make room for coconut palms. The lush islet is covered in these unique trees, with their thickly twisted roots reaching across the ground and the forest motu is heavily protected by the locals.\n\n8. Nuku Hiva\n\nThe largest of the Marquesas Islands (and second largest island in French Polynesia), Nuku Hiva is a lush, wild island with strong traditions and a proud sense of identity. The variety of its landscapes will knock your socks off, while the welcome from the locals will steal your heart.\n\nHome to waterfalls, lush valleys, forested mountains and striking black-sand beaches, it’s perfect for off-the-beaten-track outdoor adventures.\n\nOften known as the ‘Mysterious Island’, the remote magic of Nuku Hiva will soon get under your skin. Wander between mythic tiki statues and temple ruins at one of the archaeological sites on the island, learn about age-old Polynesian traditions, and feel the ‘mana’ (Polynesia life-force) in full flow.\n\nThe Marquesas have their very own language and local cuisine as well as a rich history of myths retold in songs and dances. If you’re looking for an authentic French Polynesia packed with history and atmosphere, you’ve found it.\n\nGetting to Nuku Hiva\n\nIt takes almost four hours to fly from Papeete to Nuku Hiva, which is about as far off the grid as you can get. No wonder the island is sometimes described as a paradise at the end of the earth. You can also visit Nuku Hiva by sailing on the iconic Aranui 5, an extraordinary experience that we can’t recommend highly enough.\n\nOn Hiva Oa, you can explore the village of Atuona, which was once home to the impressionist artist Paul Gauguin. You can visit the colonial store where he shopped, see a replica of his infamous “Maison du Jouir”, and explore the adjoining museum.\n\nIn the cemetery at the top of the hill, beneath a large frangipani tree, you’ll find a tombstone with these simple words: Paul Gauguin 1903.\n\nGetting to Hiva Oa\n\nYou can fly directly from Papeete to Hiva Oa in 3 hours and 20 minutes. You can also reach the island by sailing on the iconic Aranui 5 or booking a boutique cruise with Paul Gauguin. If you get the chance to visit this incredible place, grab it with both hands!\n\n10. Rurutu\n\nLocated 355 miles south of Tahiti, Rurutu is one of the remote Austral Islands. Wild and staggeringly beautiful, it’s a mix of paradise coves, towering cliffs, limestone caves, archaeological sites, and taro plantations. Horses roam the beaches, the skies are full of birds, and the local culture is lively. Safe to say, it’s a special place.\n\nOften called ‘Whale Island’, Rurutu offers the wildlife experience of a lifetime. In July, the blazing red blooms of the atae tree trumpet the annual arrival of the humpback whales, who arrive here to breed in the warm waters. While the new mothers rest on the shallow seafloor, their curious calves frolic at the surface. From July to October, you can spend your days swimming with humpbacks and your evenings on the beach watching whales splash in the ocean.\n\nSo, while you may not be able to stay in an overwater bungalow with 24-hour room service, Rurutu offers you a unique chance to swim and snorkel with humpback whales. There’s no lagoon here, so the deepwater offshore tempts the whales to come very near to the island. They may be huge, but they’re gentle giants, so grab a mask and head into the waves!\n\nGetting to Rurutu\n\nYou can fly directly from Papeete to Rurutu in 1 hour and 30 minutes, and there are also flights available from the neighbouring islands of Raivavae and Tubuai.\n\n11. Raivavae\n\nAnother of the temperate Austral Islands, Raivavae sits on an emerald lagoon surrounded by tiny islets. Home to a jagged mountain with lush green hillsides, calm waters and perfect white sands, Raivavae looks a lot like Bora Bora. However, unlike Bora Bora, you’ll have these spectacular beaches to yourself. Basically, you get all the natural beauty with none of the crowds. It’s a rustic, traditional and magical island.\n\nThere are 28 motus (islets) dotted around the lagoon and the beautiful Motu Piscine (Swimming Pool Island), is a particularly special place. Soak in the natural pools, hike along picturesque paths, and cycle between villages where you’ll be warmly greeted by the locals. Life is slow and peaceful here, and staying in a Tahitian guesthouse is like being welcomed into the family home.\n\nGetting to Raivavae\n\nYou can fly directly from Papeete to Raivavae in 1 hour and 30 minutes, and there are also flights available from the neighbouring islands of Rurutu and Tubuai.\n\nReady to explore French Polynesia?\n\nWe’re experts at creating unforgettable holidays in the South Pacific and we can build French Polynesia trips of all shapes and sizes.
