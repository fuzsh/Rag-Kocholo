        "text": "Numerous artists walked on ancestral lands of the Marquesas: Herman Melville, Paul Gauguin, Jacques Brel, and many others.\n\nRock creeks in the littorals dive directly into the great blue of the Ocean. As for beaches, they are embedded in valleys. Landside, vegetation is in perpetual abundance which seems like paradise on earth. Dance is one of the activities with annual festivals embracing tradition and culture.\n\nThe richness of the Marquesas Islands culture is expressed through tattoos, sculptures, art objects, jewelry, paintings…\n\nNumber of islands : 12\n\nName of the islands : Nuku Hiva, Ua Pou, Ua Huka, Hiva Oa, Tahuata, Fatu Hiva, Motu One, Hatutu, Eiao, Motu Iti, Fatu Huku, Mohotana\n\nSurface area : 997km²\n\nNuku Hiva is the largest Island of the Marquesas. This volcanic island still wild and raw has a road that cut the pine wooded valley of the Tovi’i plateau which overhangs Nuku Hiva with its 800 meters of altitude.\n\nVaipo’s waterfall is the highest one in French Polynesia and it is located at the bottom of Hakaui valley after an expedition-like hike. All the roads of Nuku Hiva can be visited as well on foot or on horseback.\n\nFrom Muake Mont, the sight is breathtaking. In the distance, we observe on the waterfront a deep ocean blue. Its white sand beach is protected from the swell and the wind by the unique coral shelf of the Marquesas archipelago. Nuku Hiva waters are rich with fishes and turtles, their visits promise to surprise young and old.\n\nNuku Hiva ancestors’ life stays all along Paeke’s me’ae (marae in Marquesan).

Numerous are historical sites with legendary stories about Nuku Hiva.\n\nNuku Hiva will make you live an authentic trip with ancestral flavors.\n\nHiva Oa has impressive cliffs, majestic forests, tropical vegetation, and steep roads. Hiva Oa's bays offer beautiful beaches with forests and fragrant frangipani trees.\n\nThe still wild road leads to Motuua and Nahoe’s valleys before arriving at Puamau village. Matafenua cap is a very long brownish rock point eaten away by the sea which directs the boat in the bay. At the bottom of the valley, Te I’Ipona site owns the highest tiki of French Polynesia: Taka’i’i, giving the impression of watching and protecting this sacred area. It takes part of the symbols of the “Land of Men”.\n\nAtuona, Hiva Oa main village, contains for its part the remains of the past life of the singer Jacques Brel and the famous painter Paul Gauguin. Their graves are situated on high ground and are regularly flowered and visited.\n\nFatu Hiva welcomes and taunts at the same time its visitors with its authentic and breathtaking reefs. This island surprises with its cathedral looks with more than 1 000 meters of elevation changes for only 10 kilometers long and 4 kilometers wide.\n\nOmoa’s bay and the famous Virgin’s bay open toward the West being this way sheltered from the waves formed by the trade winds. However, it is the island that owns the most humid climate of all archipelagoes. The rain pours in abundance allowing rich vegetation: mangos, bananas, lemons, oranges, papayas, grapefruits…"
