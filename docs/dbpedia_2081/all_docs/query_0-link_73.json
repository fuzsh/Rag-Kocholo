During the ensuing night he searched for wounded on the ground in front of the enemy's lines for four hours.\n\nNext day he took one stretcher-bearer to the advanced trenches, and under heavy shell fire carried an urgent case for 500 yards into safety, being wounded in the side by a shell splinter during the journey. The same night he took up a party of twenty volunteers, rescued three wounded men from a shell hole twenty-five yards from the enemy's trench, buried the bodies of two officers, and collected many identity discs, although fired on by bombs and machine guns.\n\nAltogether he saved the lives of some twenty badly wounded men, besides the ordinary cases which passed through his hands. His courage and self-sacrifice, were beyond praise.\n\nMedals\n\nOne of only 3 people to be awarded the VC twice.\n\nVC - Victoria Cross\n\nMC\n\nBio Details\n\nBorn : 9 November 1894\n\nDied : Died of Wounds 4 August 1917\n\nBuried : Brandhoek New Military Cemetery, Belgium.\n\nMedical Education: Liverpool & Oxford\n\nNoel CHEVASSE\n\nBattle of Guillemont\n\nIn 1925, the RAMC Association was formed to further the camaraderie of WW1 Corps veterans with Sir William Leishman being the first President. There are now some 25 branches around UK with a predominantly veteran membership although most serving Corps members also are members centrally. The Association has traditionally been supported by Corps Funds and especially for the expenses of the branch standards and standard bearers."
