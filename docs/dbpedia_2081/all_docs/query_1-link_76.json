        "text": "In researching the history of Brookline soldiers in the First World War, old editions of the Pittsburgh Press revealed the following special feature on the contributions of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania soldiers in that Great War. It is a revealing documentary detailing the role that our local men and women played in bringing an end to that global conflict. It is a part of Pittsburgh history that has been buried in the newspaper archive for nearly a century. It has been recreated here after so many years in hiding.\n\nThe documentary covers the work of the Pennsylvania National Guard's 28th Keystone Division and the infantry regiments and artillery battalion comprised of Pittsburgh men. It also follows the 80th Blue Ridge Division, made up of men drafted into service from the Western Pennsylvania area, the 15th Engineer Battalion, raised and trained in Pittsburgh, and Base Hospital No. 27, comprised in large part of students and faculty from the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe story takes the reader from the early days at training camps in the United States to the battlefields of France and on to the armistice. Pittsburgh soldiers were instrumental in several campaigns, including the Second Battle of the Marne, the Battle of Soissons and the Argonne-Meuse Offensive.\n\nAt the time of America's entry into World War I, Pittsburgh was the eighth largest city in the United States. It was an unrivaled industrial giant. From factory output at home, to the foot soldiers in the field and the medical staff in the Army hospitals, Pittsburgh did as much as any other city or state in helping to bring the Great War to a successful conclusion for the Allies.\n\nThe Carnegie Steel Homestead Works.\n\nWhen the guns ceased firing and the doughboys from Pittsburgh came home, 508 did not return, and many thousands had suffered wounds. Many of our Pittsburgh boys remained in France, buried in military cemeteries that will forever be hallowed ground, and a reminder to future generations of the costly toll paid by the young men and women of the United States of America to help preserve freedom and rid the world of tyranny.\n\nThis story, written by John V. Hanlon of the Pittsburgh Press, documents these achievements and is presented below as it was printed in the Sunday Press a century ago. There were four missing editions in this thirty-edition chronicle. The gaps in the text are unfortunate, but do not take away from the gripping history of the soldiers from Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania.\n\nThere are some additions and images included at the end that substantiate and enhance the original text, including some personal remembrances from a Mount Washington nurse that served in France and a Somerset native that spent four months in German captivity. Finally, there are additional links to online, readable Google Books that detail the wartime experiences of individual regiments, complete with maps and plenty of photos.\n\nA History of Pittsburgh and\n\nWestern PA Troops in the War\n\nby John V.

Such a history would have its opening chapters dating from the day when he who was Emperor of the Germans summoned his militaristic hordes and sent them forth on an orgy of murder, pillage and terrorism to satiate his unholy greed for power and to realize his ambition of a fettered world.\n\nLong before the United States entered the war and indeed from its very first days, adventurous sons of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania were bleeding and dying on the battlefields where the allies were striving to stop the ravages of the Hun.\n\nTurn where you would in stricken Belgium and bleeding, torn France; in the plague-ridden Balkans; along the cold, barren wastes of Russia or on the hot sands of far-off Egypt, wherever the crimson tides of war surged back and forth in the struggle for humanity, they could be found performing acts of charity or mercy or of war itself.\n\nThey pressed the cup of water to the fevered lips of Serb and Cossack and Poilu and Tommy. The men from India and Australia and Canada hailed them from beds of pain as ministering angels and the sons of sunny Italy were familiar with their work.\n\nThe Hun, too, had tasted of their prowess with the cold steel on land and sea, under the waves and in the air. When sudden death and destruction would pour from the heavens at the enemy lines the steady skillful hand of a Pittsburgh man was frequently at the helm of that battleship or in the air.\n\nUNTOLD DEEDS OF HEROISM\n\nIt is very likely that some of the most notable deeds performed in this war will never be set down to enrich the pages of the history or the advance of mankind towards that goal where shines the radiant lights of equality and justice. Many of these deeds were unobserved and those who performed them made the supreme sacrifice. Their lips are forever sealed in the silence of the grave. Perhaps had they lived the stories would have remained locked close in their hearts, for brave men are not prone to boast of valor.\n\nAnd although many of these sons of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania had fought and died, winning for themselves the deathless crown of victory under foreign flags, before Columbia unloosed the mighty hurricane of her wrath, nevertheless they contributed their all to the final determination of the great cause. And as the story of their deeds is cherished in the archives of other nations it is not possible at this time to include in this narrative more than acknowledgement of their contribution to humanity. Anything further would not be right for it could not give them that measure of exact justice which is their due.\n\nFor this reason this resume of the part played by Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania soldiers in the war must begin with the entry of the United States into the conflict and even then it is only possible to follow the activities of certain designated units in which the personnel was made up largely of men from this section.\n\nWhen the United States declared that a state of war existed with the Imperial German Government there were hundreds of men from Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania serving in the regular army establishment. There was hardly a unit of any size which did not carry their names upon its roster of commissioned or enlisted personnel.\n\nONE OF THE FIRST THREE\n\nOne of the first three men to make the supreme sacrifice in the first actual clash between the soldiers of Uncle Sam and the enemy was a Pittsburgh lad, Private Thomas Enright, of 6641 Premo Street. He, together with Privates James B. Gresham, of Evansville, Indiana, and Merle D. Hay of Glidden, Iowa, headed the first honor roll of casualties which came home to America from overseas.\n\nThomas Enright, James Gresham and Merle Hay.\n\nPrivate Enright had enlisted in the Regular Army eight years before and had been assigned to Company F, Sixteenth United States Infantry. He was therefore a trained and seasoned man and when he met his death he was in a training sector securing the actual combat knowledge necessary to effectively instruct his less experienced comrades back of the lines.\n\nIt was on Saturday, November 3, 1917, that the little band of about forty Americans to which Private Enright was attached was cut off by artillery fire which literally ripped their trench to pieces. The Germans had learned, in some manner or other, that Americans were holding this salient, and desired to capture prisoners in order to ascertain, if possible, the strength of Pershings forces then in France.\n\nIt is recorded in the data on that first fight that 210 Germans rushed the forty Americans after the artillery preparation and in the hand-to-hand combat which followed the Americans gave a good account of themselves, fighting in a manner which would have delighted their revolutionary ancestors. It was a fight worthy of the best traditions of their country and flag.\n\nAmerican troops manning the trenches.\n\nThe American casualties were three dead, five wounded and twelve missing. The German casualties are known to have been extremely heavy and although they secured prisoners the cost to them in lives was out of all proportion to the numbers they engaged.\n\nWhen the story of this first clash and the casualty list reached Washington and was made public it sent a thrill throughout the nation and the war department was besieged with inquiries from many anxious homes. The news brought to America the first distinct appreciation that her part in the great world struggle was not to be a bloodless one.\n\nBURIAL OF PITTSBURGH HERO\n\nAnd this appreciation of the heartaches and suffering which war was to bring to many firesides was especially felt in Pittsburgh, the home of one of those three patriots who went to their deaths on that bleak November day.\n\nThey buried the three heroes close to the place where they fell; while the shells screeching overhead sang the only requiem. American troops and French veterans were massed in the form of a hollow square and the three caskets, draped in the flag of the country they had loved so well were carried upon the field by comrades.\n\nFrom the lines there stepped a soldier of France wearing the insignia of a general. He walked to the caskets. With tears streaming down his war-seamed face he removed his cap and bowing before each bier he called the names of Private Enright, Private Gresham and Private Hay, and then in a voice husky and choked with emotion said:\n\nIn the name of France I bid you farewell. In the name of France I thank you. May God receive your souls. Farewell.\n\nThen he asked in the name of France that the mortal remains of these three young men be left with that nation forever* and that upon their tombs would be the words:\n\nHere lie the First United States Soldiers to Fall on French Soil for Liberty and Justice.\n\nThomas Francis Enright\n\nPittsburgh\n\nAs he finished there was a terrific roar, the salute for the dead, and it was not fired with blank cartridges, but by batteries of the great French 75s, manned by American artillerymen who sent a salvo of shells hurling into the German lines and with every shell there went a prayer that it would find an avenging mark.\n\nAnd the names of Privates Enright, Gresham and Hay will have a special and distinguished niche in history. The French will see to that for they already have erected a monument to the memory of these brave soldiers where all the world and generations yet unborn may read of the day when the Hun first met the men of that nation which was destined to wreck his vain ambition.\n\nThe remains of Private Thomas Enright were brought back to the United States in 1921.\n\nUpon his return to Pittsburgh, his casket laid in state at Soldiers and Sailors Hall\n\nin Oakland. He is buried in Saint Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Lawrenceville.\n\nA WAR OF METAL AND METTLE\n\nAnd this is where Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania was first brought to a true realization of the sacrifices necessary to the conduct of this war and the truths brought home did not go unheeded. The story of Private Enright and his comrades but strengthened that grim determination to go on to a victorious end, let the cost in blood and treasure be what it might.\n\nAs there was scarcely a unit of any size in the Regular Army which did not carry the names of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania men upon its roster, even from the earliest days of the Republic, so it is today in the mighty and unconquered host which Uncle Sam has created, for Pittsburgh brains and brawn and bravery were found necessary wherever the War or Navy departments carried on their activities.\n\nThousands of the most skilled men in the military establishment were summoned from the industries of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania to do for the government what they had been doing for private employers. Pittsburgh and the surrounding industrial districts furnished many of the very best mechanics and men trained in the various metal crafts and trades.\n\nThis was a war of metal and where else in the world could men be found so eminently fitted for keeping the combatant branches supplied with the weapons they used so effectively against the Hun!\n\nAnd so to write the story of their achievements would be to write of the work of every unit and branch of the military service - ordnance, quartermaster, motor transport, tank, chemical warfare and many other and special and new sections necessary to the modern army.\n\nFor instance, it was Pittsburgh chemists who strove night and day in gas research work and contributed much towards making our gas defense and gas assault sections so effective that even the Germans with all their boasted expertness in chemical warfare were both outguessed and out-gassed.\n\nMAN LOCAL MEN COMMISSIONED\n\nThrough every ramification of the service, in every rank and station the men of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania toiled through all the weary months when our stupendous military establishment was building, to weld it into a solid whole and which even in its infancy turned the tide of battle and strewed the Central Empires with fear, internal dissensions and empty thrones.\n\nHundreds of highly trained executives from this section of the country were commissioned and ordered to the nations capital to help direct the activities of the war. They were searched out and summoned to the most important tasks by both the military and civil authorities of the Federal government and although many were restless because they could not secure assignments overseas where the actual fighting was being done, nevertheless they did not flinch from their work and contributed much to the success of their brothers over there.\n\nBut it was not alone in the military service of the nation that the sons of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania helped to make the world safe for democracy. It was necessary that many should remain at home to tend the mines, and mills, and factories. The Pittsburgh district became the Arsenal of America in many respects.\n\nTo this great manufacturing section where steel is king the nation looked for the implements and machines of modern warfare. Here was planned the huge ordnance plant which was to have furnished the heavy engines of destruction with which our fighting men proposed to blast a way through the enemy lines, and then on to Berlin.\n\nTo those who served in the mines and the mills, the furnace and the forge, acknowledgement of the part they played in the victorious outcome is justly due. They will never be accorded the place in history that will go to those who stood on the far-flung battle line, but, nevertheless, they wrought efficiently and effectively back of that line.\n\nThe German Kaiser bit off more than\n\nhe could chew when he drew\n\nAmerica into the war.\n\nARSENAL OF THE WORLD\n\nAnd thus it came about that what was known as the Workshop of the World in times of peace turned in the passing of a day into an arsenal of the world. The thousand glares which light the skies of night marking the abode of a wealth of peaceful industry and a world a-building became the demon eyes of an outraged and determined people flashing ominous warnings of swift and terrible retribution for those who dared to taunt the Giant of the Occident.\n\nThen it was that Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania resolved to drain the blood of manhood to the dregs with the same determination with which the precious metal is drained from the melting pots in order to make sure the triumph of our arms. The lids of the treasure chests and strong boxes were thrown open and gold was literally poured into Columbias coffers.\n\nThen it was that the call went forth from Washington for men as well as munitions and money, and our people saw those famous regiments from the western slopes of the Pennsylvania Alleghenies depart for their training stations to secure that military instruction which together with their traditional bravery later enabled them to throw back the Hun from the very gates of Paris; to confound and demoralize and annihilate the very flower of German Soldiery; to break the armies of the Kaiser in twain at the Argonne, and force an early ending of the Great War.\n\nLater came the selective service calls which summoned thousands more of the very cream of our manhood to take up the rigors of military training; a training which eventually made the Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania draftees the superiors of any Hun who ever wore the uniform of his overlord.\n\nAnd the accomplishments of the selective service men who left the plow and the forge, the store and the factory, to do battle on the blood-stained soil of Europe; who left peaceful homes for trenches reeking with all that chills the heart - demonstrates that they were of a type beyond compare.\n\nThey were men with iron in their blood and the advance of their legions was irresistible. The German horde fell back withered and palsied before those living walls of valor as if stricken with the most dreaded arrow in the quiver of the Grim Destroyer.\n\nPRAISE FOR PITTSBURGH MEN\n\nIt has always been the policy of the War Department since Columbia threw down the gage of battle to refrain from making public the standards of proficiency attained by the various army divisions. This policy, no doubt, is a commendable one, preventing, as it does, any feeling between the men from various sections of this country.\n\nNevertheless, it has recently come to notice and from the highest authoritative sources that the soldiers of Pennsylvania were among the very best taken overseas. A great military leader of a foreign power recently remarked in private conversation that they proved themselves to be among the foremost soldiers of the world.\n\nThe 28th Division (Pennsylvania National Guard) and the 80th Division (selective service men mostly from Western Pennsylvania) both became Red divisions - divisions designated as shock troops of the highest known type and only so honored after being thoroughly tested in actual combat with the enemy.\n\nThe 28th Division is known to have been the most proficient National Guard division in the United States. That is why this division was among the first to be sent to Europe and also why it was used so continuously and successfully, bringing upon itself the record of so many glorious achievements.\n\nThe casualties of this division and especially of some of the Western Pennsylvania regiments which are a part of this unit demonstrated it was regarded so highly by the supreme command that it was always used in the most difficult places and where failure to hold or obtain objectives was not to be even thought of, regardless of the resistance offered.\n\nLikewise, the 80th Division became one of the most proficient of the draft divisions because the records show that even before departing for overseas it was held in high regard by military leaders. But these facts will not surprise Western Pennsylvanians, for their section of the state has given to our armies of the past many skilled and notable men-at-arms.\n\nAlthough ordinarily following peaceful pursuits they are primarily of fighting stock and can readily be transformed into soldiers capable of successfully meeting the choicest of what William the Murderer was proud to boast of as his unconquerable and matchless legions.\n\nThe Gunners of an American Battery, though reduced to two wounded men,\n\nkeep their gun in action through a gas attack.\n\nUNSURPASSABLE MORALE\n\nThe spirit and morale of the Western Pennsylvania soldiery in this war was characterized by the military authorities as unsurpassable. The traditions of their state coupled with a free-born love of justice, together with a natural aptitude to face and solve the serious problems of life, made of these men antagonists to all tyranny.\n\nThey were accustomed to laugh under the strain of the most arduous labors, for theirs was the life of the mines and the mills where only the fittest survive and thus they furnished some of the most desirable military material obtainable in America.\n\nThey went to their training camps with a song and a smile upon their lips just as they later sang and laughed while a hurricane of German machine gun bullets was cutting wide swaths of death in their ranks. They knew no such word as failure and they also knew that no man from the Keystone state had ever turned his back upon his flag. In their creed to die was one thing and to die bravely was another and that is why they were always found with their faces toward the enemy.\n\nThe folks at home already know how true they kept to these teachings for in the accounts of their battles cabled by the war correspondents it has been a matter of frequent comment that the men of the Pennsylvania regiments always fell with their faces in the direction from which came the steel and leaden hail of the Hun.\n\nThis statement does not mean, of course, that there were any Americans who refused to face the enemy and go forward where sudden death was stalking beside them at every step. It does show, however, that those from Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania lived up to every cherished tradition of their home district; that they were men unafraid.\n\nIn addition to the two divisions mentioned above, Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania sent many men to other fighting organizations. The Marines claimed hundreds and everybody knows how the Soldiers of the Sea accounted for themselves when they met the enemy. The Navy and Merchant Marine claimed other hundreds while the dangers of the Tanks and Aviation tempted many more to forsake the ways of peace even before the draft calls were made.\n\nA GLORIOUS CONTRIBUTION\n\nAnd hundreds of men from this section flocked to the officer's training camps very early in the war there to learn how to lead and train other men. Most of them passed their period of intensive military instruction successfully and they were scattered throughout every arm of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nThe 79th Division which trained at Camp Meade carried the names of about 3,000 Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania men on it's muster rolls and the 83rd Division which trained at Camp Sherman, Ohio, also received men from the counties of Butler, Beaver, Lawrence and Washington.\n\nThe Fifth (now the Fifteenth) Engineers which trained at Oakmont and which were one of the first units to go overseas was recruited from in and about Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh likewise contributed the University of Pittsburgh Base Hospital No. 27, which included an Allegheny Hospital Unit, known as Unit L.\n\nTaken all-in-all it was a glorious contribution to the cause given by Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania in stalwart manhood and it is predicted that when it is possible to secure the final total of those who donned the uniform of Uncle Sam from this section the percentage of men directly serving the nation, either as soldiers or civilians, will be the highest of any section of the country.\n\nMany of the boys will never come home again, they will not participate in the last grand review and many a mothers heart is aching because she will never see her son again. They sleep under the soil of a people who gave us Lafayette and freely shed their blood that our Republic might live. Their graves are tended by loving hands and will be kept green and flower-bedecked until such time as our government will bring the bodies home.\n\nThe women of France do not forget. The hero dead will come home either to find eternal rest beside loved ones in some quiet country churchyard or maybe in Arlington, that magnificent city of the nations soldier and sailor dead where one may trace the history of Columbias greatness in the carven words upon the marble monuments pointing to the last abode of those whose memory our people delight to honor.\n\nSome have died in the very forefront of the battle while others were the victims of accident or disease, but one and all gave the last full measure of sacrifice and devotion. It matters not where they fell, nor under what soil they repose either now or in the years to come. They have built for themselves tombs which are indestructible, which even the ever shifting hands of time shall only serve to polish and make more brilliant the records of their deeds. Their names shall go ringing down the centuries alongside those heroes of the world who have gone before.\n\nOthers will return maimed and torn by shot and shell - some to go through a living death of perpetual darkness or mad from the shock of the close-bursting bomb or crippled beyond human skill to repair. They want no charity and none will be offered for they belong to the nation and it is not likely that our people will allow the Congress to forget.\n\nAnd those who return from the conflict well and hearty will have treasures beyond the wildest dream of the youth; treasures which they would not exchange for all the gold in the universe and for which many men would today give everything on earth which they hold dear. These treasures are the knowledge of having been over there, of having participated in the greatest military struggle in the history of the world, of having gained the victors wreath.\n\nThey will have ever before them the memory of what they did for mankind and wondrous stories to tell until their dying days. Then when the dark night comes and they pass ever to the comrades who have been gathered to their fathers they will have a heritage to leave their offspring as lasting and substantial as the rock of ages.\n\nWhen on April 6, 1917, at 1:13pm, President Wilson signed the memorable Joint Resolution of the Congress declaring the existence of a state of war and five minutes later issued a call for volunteers to fill up to war strength the regular military establishments, Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania commenced to change the habiliments of peace for the panoply of war. The transition was accomplished swiftly, smoothly and thoroughly.\n\nThe great army of toilers in the mines and mills and factories only paused long enough to utter a defiant word to the Hun, to clench their fists and set their jaws in determination. Then they turned to their work again and with increased production began literally to jam the avenues of transportation with the implements of war.\n\nThey knew that they must gird Uncle Sam with armor against which the Hun might launch his thunderbolts in vain and that the requirements of our gallant allies must not be forgotten or neglected. Without the Pittsburgh industrial district to turn to in the emergency there might have been a different story to tell.\n\nIn Washington and London, Paris and Rome, the contribution of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania to the winning of the victory is well known by those who directed our civil and military enterprises. Foch and Pershing, Haig and Petain can tell, and so can the former German warlord and all his Prussian brood, for the enemy was unable to withstand those avalanches of steel which rolled out of Pittsburgh, tagged for Berlin.\n\nAnd while every drop of energy was being expended to turn out those products so necessary to the prosecution of the war, Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania did not forget that men must also go forth to make effective the use of the material in the areas where despots sought to dispute with free men in the future conduct of the world.\n\nTHE EIGHTEENTH ORDERED OUT!\n\nEven before Congress had finally passed the law to determine whether the military policy of the nation should be volunteer or selective service, Pittsburgh experienced an early realization of the cruel part of war, that part which summons the sons and the husbands and the fathers from the firesides and company of their loved ones and sends them forth with the prospect that they may never return.\n\nDeath is hard at any time but to go forth to face the end far away from kinfolk or even kindly neighbors oftentimes makes even a brave man shudder. And when men are destined to days of suffering from disease or wounds there is something in the gently loving touch of mother or wife, daughter or sister, which seems to possess the magic of transmitting power to endure pain. This is the part of war which tears and rends the heartstrings, but it is a part of the toll civilization has ever been forced to pay. The progress of the world is but an escalade of battles.\n\nSo to many anxious homes in Pittsburgh there came the first real stir of wars alarms when on April 12, 1917 the old Eighteenth Regiment of the Pennsylvania National Guard was ordered to mobilize and proceed to patrol the great avenues of transportation which radiate from this city.\n\nThe officials at the head of our government knew only too well that the country was enmeshed in a network of enemy espionage directed by agents who would not hesitate to order any crime which might retard the stupendous preparations Uncle Sam was making. There were few more likely places to commit such outrages than in the Pittsburgh district. The railroad bridges spanning the rivers and valleys and the tunnels piercing the mountains offered especially excellent objectives.\n\nSoldiers of the Eighteenth Regiment guard the Radebaugh and Gallitzin Tunnels in May, 1917.\n\nTHE VOLUNTEERS DEPART\n\nThe presence of the Eighteenth regiment on this important duty was first revealed May 18, but even before that date a Pittsburgher at the head of a little band of intrepid Americans with the flag of the country above them was marching through Paris for the front and being acclaimed amid that greatest demonstration that city had witnessed in years.\n\nThis event occurred on May 9, 1917, and the man was R.T. Scully, who was one of the officers in charge of this unit of sixty Americans clad in khaki and armed with rifles. They comprised the first detachment of the then newly created munitions transport branch of the American Ambulance corps. This was the first American armed force to pass through France.\n\nAnd while the Eighteenth continued to guard the strategic points along the railways leading out of Pittsburgh, thus assuring the speedy transportation of the material for war, martial events began developing quickly throughout this section of Pittsburgh more and more as each day passed by realization of the stern requirements of the nation.\n\nSoon the rhythmic tread of marching feet echoed through Pittsburghs streets as the early squads of volunteers departed from recruiting offices of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps for the various training stations. Tented cities began to appear in and about Pittsburgh and armories were made ready for the mobilization of the units of the National Guard which had not been placed upon patrol duty.\n\nThe order for the mobilization of the National Guard of Pennsylvania was sent from Washington to Governor Brumbaugh on the night of May 17, 1917 and was immediately transmitted by the Adjutant General of the state to all commands. The mobilization was set for July 15 at the armories of the various units, there to be mustered into the Federal service and await the order to proceed to the training camp. The guard was drafted into the Army of the United States, August 5, 1917, by proclamation of the President.\n\nMeanwhile, Colonel Edgar Jadwin, formerly in charge of the United States Engineers office in the Pittsburgh district, had received permission from Washington to go ahead with his pet scheme of recruiting a regiment of engineers in Pittsburgh. He worked fast and aroused such enthusiasm over the prospect of an early journey to France that he organized and trained a splendid body of men within a short time. At Oakmont, Colonel Jadwin established Camp Gaillard and the regiment mobilized there for training May 23, 1917.\n\nThen came the news of June 6, 1917. It was a day which will always be remembered for those who were to comprise the principal part of the great draft army registered for service. Ten days later the first Liberty Loan campaign was launched and Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania went into the business of beating the Kaiser with renewed vim.\n\nTHE ENGINEERS DEPART\n\nThe first troop movement of consequence out of Pittsburgh occurred on July 4, 1917, when the Fifth Engineers (now the Fifteenth Engineers) finally departed from this section for a port of embarkation to take ship for overseas, there to build railroads and wagon roads for the legions Uncle Sam was preparing to hurl against the Hun.\n\nFrom that time on until the signing of the armistice hardly a day passed in which men from Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania did not depart, either singly or in squads, companies or regiments, with their objective as the battlefields of France. The uniform became a familiar sight upon the streets for many officers and enlisted men were assigned to this district to supervise in the various industries performing war work and to inspect the finished products.\n\nFourth Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh was alive with the Spirit of America on July 19, 1917.\n\nMany Pittsburghers had just left for war and many more were being mobilized.\n\nJuly 15, 1917, the National Guard units not already on patrol duty mobilized. The Tenth and Sixteenth Regiments of infantry assembled by companies at their home armories throughout Western Pennsylvania and the First Field Artillery took up quarters in Motor Square Garden.\n\nTroop H, First Pennsylvania cavalry, camped on Bayard Street, opposite the Schenley Riding Academy and Duquesne Garden was used to house Truck Companies No. 5 and 6. The First Field Battalion Signal Corps, Field Hospital No. 1 and Ambulance No. 1 were stationed at the Armory, Penn Avenue and Station Street. Ambulance No. 4 remained at its armory in Coraopolis and Field Hospital No. 4 departed for camp at Mt. Gretna.\n\nEIGHTEENTH CAMPS HERE\n\nThe Eighteenth Regiment of infantry was relieved from patrol duty along the railroads and after a parade through the downtown section of Pittsburgh went into camp at Schenley Park. During all this time the Guard units were busy recruiting up to war strength and close to 4,000 soldiers were stationed in Pittsburgh and another 4,000 scattered throughout the cities and towns in Western Pennsylvania where the various companies maintained their headquarters.\n\nIn the meantime, the great draft lottery had been held at Washington and the various local and district draft boards in Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania were busy selecting the men who were desired by the Federal government to make up the personnel of the 80th Division of the new National Army to be organized at Camp Lee, near Petersburg, Virginia and the 83rd Division at Camp Sherman, near Chillicothe, Ohio. The draftees from the counties of Beaver, Lawrence, Butler and Washington were sent to Sherman and those from all other sections of Western Pennsylvania to Lee.\n\nAugust 24, 1917, witnessed the departure for Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, of 600 officer candidates who had assembled in Pittsburgh from every section of Western Pennsylvania preparatory to entraining for the southern camp. They departed in three squads over the P & L E, Pennsylvania and B & O railroads and were cheered on their way by hundreds of friends and well wishers who had gathered at the depots.\n\nGUARDSMEN GO SOUTH\n\nThe first of the guardsmen began to move towards Camp Hancock August 17, 1917, when Field Hospital No. 1 and Ambulance Company No. 1 of the Eighteenth regiment entrained. Then on August 30 the Western Pennsylvania contingent of the First Field Artillery Battery, a sanitation detachment and regimental band numbering 622 men and 18 officers entrained at East Liberty station. Colonel W.S. McKee was in command and the local units were joined later by Battery A, of South Bethlehem, Battery D, of Williamsport and Battery C, of Phoenixville.\n\nThe units marched from their armory to the station in a steady downpour of rain but this did not deter thousands of relatives and friends together with city and county officials from braving the elements to give the men a rousing farewell. The same scenes were re-enacted when the Eighteenth regiment pulled stakes at it's camp in Schenley oval and entrained for Camp Hancock September 7, 1917.\n\nSeptember 11, 1917, the last guardsmen in this section departed for the south; Troop H, First Cavalry of Pittsburgh, which was later joined by Troop F, First Cavalry of New Castle. During this period of the guard movement the Tenth regiment and the Sixteenth regiment, both with companies scattered all over Western Pennsylvania, entrained for Camp Hancock.\n\nAmericans driving the Germans out of a French farmyard. The enemy held thesefarmhouses and buildings until the\n\nlast moment in order that he might harass the Allied troops. The fighting was hand-to-hand and company work.\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nDEPARTURE OF PITTSBURGH AND WESTERN PA TROOPS\n\nThe night of September 4, 1917, in Pittsburgh and in practically every city, town and village in this section of the state, was a somber night for many Western Pennsylvania families. The draftees received notice from their draft boards to hold themselves in readiness to go to war.\n\nThe demonstrations of farewell that took place in the thousands of Western Pennsylvania homes were of the type that create fond memories for both the soldier and his proud yet anxious family. The memories of these cherished moments, for families and friends and soldiers alike, would be their last together for many months or years, however long it took to push the German aggressors back to the gates of Berlin.\n\nTHE DRAFTEES DEPART\n\nThe large crowds gathered at the railway stations of Pittsburgh and other towns around Western Pennsylvania on September 23, 1917, to bid farewell to those assembled, were filled with pride and anxiety. The somber reality that many of the thousands of draftees departing for military training would never return could not dull the excitement of family and friend, but the morbid anxiety was real.\n\nThe population of the United States knew the bloody strife that awaited our soldiers and only too well the terrible toll to be exacted by this war for they had received first-hand information from our nearby neighbor Canada, where there remained hardly a home that had not been touched with sorrow for lost sons. Canada had paid a horrible price thus far on the European battlefields by reason of the dash and daring of her unconquerable legions.\n\nBut with all the sadness and the bitter thoughts of what the future might have in store for the boys who were going away, nevertheless there was a brave attempt at cheerfulness, and many a mother went through the ordeal with Spartan spirit as she gave her only son to Uncle Sam.\n\nNo one will ever know the heartaches and the torture which the mother suffered during the days when all these Western Pennsylvanians were leaving for the armed camps, and then on through the long days and nights until the armistice was signed and the casualty lists finally were completed.\n\nFirst disease invaded the camps and death claimed many of the lads even before they had completed their training, and then when they were safely overseas the cables would commence to bring stirring accounts of battles and tell of the brilliant fighting of the Pennsylvanians. And after the news of the battles would always come those lists of sorrow for many homes.\n\nThere would be a rap at the door and a messenger would quietly hand out a telegram from the War Department at Washington. That was all, and it was oftentimes the sudden end of the hope and joy of a lifetime. But there was always the consolation in knowing that he died with the bravest of the brave and for a cause in which millions of other men cheerfully gave up their lives.\n\nDrafted men from the First, Third and Twelfth Wards at the B & O Station,\n\nPittsburgh, on Sunday, September 23, 1917.\n\nLOCAL BOYS GOOD FIGHTERS\n\nAnd, many a home in Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania had good and sufficient reason to know the casualties among the troops from this section were especially heavy. Our families suffered this toll due to the fact that our soldiers were efficient and dependable forces.\n\nWherever the vitally important work was, where it was necessary to use soldiers who would not fail in the tasks assigned them, our boys were sent. And such work was usually found where the fighting was thickest and hottest and the enemy offering desperate resistance with picked regiments.\n\nDuring September, 1917, the University of Pittsburgh Base Hospital No. 27, the female personnel of which had been encamped at Ellis Island, embarked for France. The unit numbered about 300 persons and was in command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Miller. This base hospital was recruited in Pittsburgh and was originally financed by a contribution of $25,000 made by Mrs. Henry S. Collins from the funds of the Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Red Cross.\n\nThe Allegheny Hospital Unit, known as Unit L, was mobilized early in September and departed for France early in December 1917, under the command of Major Victor King.\n\nIn addition, there were hundreds of men leaving this section of the country almost daily under orders inducting them into certain special branches of the military establishment where their particular skill, along mechanical and other lines, made their services greatly desired.\n\nSome received commissions while others were inducted as privates or in various non-commissioned grades. It was this gradual filtration of the skilled men in and about the Pittsburgh industrial district which eventually helped make the new Army of the United States so proficient in almost every line of it's endeavor.\n\nMANY PITTSBURGH AVIATORS\n\nNo matter where one would turn, either in this country or overseas, in aviation, quartermaster, ordnance, signal corps or in any of the many different and exacting branches of the service, Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania men could be found performing the most difficult work and gaining lasting reputations for energy, close attention to duty and as master craftsmen.\n\nThe aviation service, offering as it did exceptionally hazardous opportunities, was a favorite with many of the young men of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania and hundreds of them later won the right to wear on their uniforms the wings of the graduate flying man.\n\nMany thousands of others who offered were unable to get into the aviation camps because of the great popularity of this branch of the service and were forced to seek some other arm. But those who did gave a good account of themselves both in the air as pilots and observers or on the ground as engineers and mechanics.\n\nThe tank service was another branch which was attractive for the men from this section and many hundreds were accepted and became highly proficient in manipulating these monsters of modern warfare. Chemical warfare, too, was attractive to many Pittsburghers and Western Pennsylvanians, because in this section there were many men skilled in chemistry and Uncle Sam had crying need for these experts in order to make ineffective the avalanches of gas so frequently sent over by the Hun.\n\nTERRIBLE GASES READY\n\nIf the war would have gone on much longer the Germans would have had occasion to learn even more of the work of these chemists from Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, for they had devised gases so devilish and deadly that even the worst the enemy had to offer were mild in comparison.\n\nTo enumerate all the special branches of the service in which men from Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania were engaged both at home and abroad would require a book itself. They were everywhere and doing every imaginable sort of work and in every rank and station in that great army.\n\nPittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania physicians and nurses were at the front in large numbers administering to the soldier boys, and the work of men and women from this section of the country in connection with the various religious, athletic and other activities must not be forgotten. Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania furnished many men and women who voluntarily left peaceful and happy homes to undergo the hardships of life on the battlefield so that they might assist our fighting men.\n\nMany such were striving by night and by day in connection with the YMCA, Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare Board, Salvation Army and the other agencies, and they helped materially to lighten the load of the soldier boy billeted on a foreign shore away from home and kinfolk.\n\nGeneral Pershing says:\n\n\"The fact that our soldiers, in a land of different customs and languages, have borne themselves in a manner in keeping with the cause for which they fought, is due not only to the efforts on their behalf, but much more to other high ideals, their discipline and their innate sense of self-respect.\"\n\n\"It should be recorded, however, that the members of these welfare societies have been untiring in their desire to be of real service to our officers and men. The patriotic devotion of these representative men and women has given a new significance to the Golden Rule, and we owe to them a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid.\"\n\n330,000 FROM PENNSYLVANIA\n\nIn the Red Cross, too, were many men and women from the western section of Pennsylvania, and wherever there were works of mercy or relief to be performed, either among the soldiers or the civilians of devastated towns and villages, their kindly ministrations will be long remembered.\n\nPennsylvania furnished the stupendous total of 330,000 men to the World War, according to figures obtained from the draft headquarters at Harrisburg, and estimates made from the state totals indicate that Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania alone furnished almost half this number.\n\nHundreds of Pittsburghers and Western Pennsylvanians are sworn in to the service at Memorial Hall.\n\nDraft boards throughout the entire state furnished 195,203 men, and of this number 77,514 were supplied by this section of the Commonwealth. The Harrisburg draft officials estimate that in reality the state supplied 250,000 men through the draft, because there were individual inductions amounting to 7,528 men sent to the student army training camps and 219 to the navy. The balance of the estimate is made up by adding delinquents and deserters and replacements for rejected men at camps.\n\nThe State National Guard furnished approximately 30,000 men, and in the neighborhood of 50,000 men volunteered in the various branches of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nRecruiting officers in charge of the Pittsburgh stations of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, and who have charge of all enlistments in Western Pennsylvania, estimate that they received into the service more than 10,000 men. Of this number the Army had about 3,000, the Marine Corps 2,200 and the Navy approximately 5,500. Aviation and other special branches also obtained relatively large quotas here.\n\nHere are the draft figures for Pittsburgh and the various counties of Western Pennsylvania:\n\nAllegheny County 14,198; Beaver 2,850; Blair 1,261; Butler 1,827; Bedford 568; Clarion 830; Clearfield 2,239; Crawford 1,130; Cambria 4,726; Elk 981; Erie 3,207; Pittsburgh 18,467; Fayette 4,202; Forest 182; Greene 622; Huntingdon 701; Lawrence 1,648; Mercer 2,425; McKean 1,050; Somerset 1,372; Venango 2,381; Warren 806; Washington 4,565; Westmoreland 5,276.\n\nWhen the National Guardsmen from Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania arrived at Camp Hancock and the drafted men at Camp Lee, those who had never participated in military affairs before received their first taste of the hardships which often accompany Army life. Especially was this so at Camp Lee, because there was a scarcity of bed clothing, no heat and the weather was anything by comfortable.\n\nThe National Guardsmen had considerable equipment before they departed for the South and so were more fortunate in this respect than the selective service men, but even then there were other inconveniences with which the boys had to put up until such time as the camp was thoroughly organized and equipped. Many were the complaints of unnecessary hardships which filtered back from Camp Lee to the folks at home, and what was true of Lee was true of most every camp in the country.\n\nA section of the trenchworks at Camp Hancock, where the 28th Division prepared for war.\n\nAT THE CANTONMENTS\n\nIn undertaking to create so large an Army, Uncle Sam had many obstacles to meet and overcome, and it was no small task to provide the necessary equipment for so large a body of men in so short a time between the declaration of a State of War and the calling of the men to camp. In addition to bedding being scarce considerable time elapsed before all the men were equipped with uniforms and other articles of clothing required to withstand the rigors of an Army camp in winter.\n\nThere were instances of carelessness on the part of officers in exposing the new men to the elements, and no doubt much sickness was caused as a result. This carelessness most generally took the form of forcing the men to stand in line in unheated buildings to await their turn for medical examination or for various inspections, but such conditions were soon corrected by the chief military authorities.\n\nThere were also some cases of neglect in properly caring for men who were ill, but these, too, were incidents due to the inexperience of the officers in handling large bodies of troops and they did not happen after the camp became thoroughly organized and in smooth running order.\n\nBut these experiences only served to give the men an idea of what might be expected in the way of hardships under war conditions, and on the whole they bore up bravely, accepted their lot with a highly commendable spirit of patience and prepared to acquire everything offered in the school of the soldier.\n\nThey later gave ample and sufficient demonstration on the battlefield that, although they learned the arts of war quickly, nevertheless they had learned their lessons thoroughly and well. And some of the former Kaisers best well knew the truth of this statement.\n\nAt the two camps, Hancock and Lee, where the large majority of the Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania boys were stationed, the usual courses of intensive training were commenced shortly after their arrival and continued without interruption until the divisions were declared fit to go overseas to complete their studies.\n\nLEARNING THE ART OF WAR\n\nOf course, the guardsmen were for the most part familiar with military discipline and the major field maneuvers, so that it was possible to start them in the advanced studies of the most modern forms of warfare within a few weeks after they went into camp.\n\nMaj. Gen. Adelbert Cronkhite\n\nBut the selected men at Camp Lee were, with few exceptions, entirely without any previous military experience, so it was necessary to teach them the very rudiments of the camp. From the start the men at Camp Lee had one of the most successful soldiers in the Regular Army as camp commander, Major General Adelbert Cronkhite, and it was freely predicted in high Army circles in Washington that if the Pittsburghers and Western Pennsylvanians had the stuff in them to make soldiers that he would turn out one of the best divisions in the new Army.\n\nHow well this prediction held out is known to the General Staff, for the 80th Division was noted as one of the most highly trained and proficient divisions of the National Army when it finally received orders to move to France.\n\nAnd while the selected men at Camp Lee were going along steadily and developing into first-class soldiers, the guardsmen down at Camp Hancock were commencing to have troubles in the shape of an order for the entire reorganization of the Pennsylvania National Guard Division to conform to the new Army standards. General Pershing, after making a study of the British and French army organization standards, had worked out a plan taken from the best points of both, and the carrying into effect of this plan played havoc with the various guard units.\n\nSCHEME CAUSES BIG PROTEST\n\nThe strength of an infantry regiment under the new standards called for many more men and officers than under the old scheme of organization. Thus some regiments were broken up to bring others up to the new strength, and it was at this time that the stir was caused when it became known that the Old Eighteenth, of Pittsburgh, was to lose it's identity entirely by being broken up, with part of the regiment to be used as a depot brigade.\n\nMajor General Charles M. Clements, then division commander, had arranged the scheme of reorganization and some ugly stories were circulated at the time relative to an attempt by Philadelphia politicians to save the identity of a Philadelphia regiment at the expense of the Pittsburgh unit. The citizens of Pittsburgh were indignant that the historic Duquesne Greys, upon which the regiment was founded, should be thus relegated into oblivion, and a mighty protest went up.\n\nDelegations composed of the Pittsburgh representatives in Congress, together with Colonel E.L. Kearns, the commander of the regiment, hastily appealed in person to Secretary of War Baker and to General Tasker H. Bliss, then Chief of Staff of the Army, to save the Eighteenth. The information was given that the reorganization was purely a matter for Major General Clements to decide. The Governor, Martin G. Brumbaugh, was asked to exert himself on behalf of the Eighteenth, and he even made a trip to Washington to consult with the Secretary of War.\n\nThe tide of dissatisfaction was running uncurbed for a time over this controversy. As the result of some alleged irregularities, including a telegram bearing the signature of the governor, which he declared he never signed, an investigation by the War Department into the whole affair was threatened. Congress also began to hear of the row and rumors of an investigation by the House Military Affairs Committee were rife.\n\nTHE OLD EIGHTEENTH IS SAVED\n\nLater, however, and much to the relief of the citizens of Pittsburgh and the men of the Eighteenth, the plans were changed so as to allow this regiment to retain it's identity, but it had a narrow escape from not being able to add more glorious chapters to it's long history.\n\nAll fair men in or out of the Pennsylvania National Guard will admit that, although considered excellent as a state militia division, this organization had much to learn about the brand of warfare being waged in Europe when it entered camp. Politics, both internal and external, had left imprints in spots, and such imprints were considered as retarding the efficiency of the men and the units.\n\nThe General Staff in Washington was well aware of these conditions and did not hesitate to clean up these spots, although taking full cognizance of the fact that such renovation would undoubtedly cause much talk and dissatisfaction in the quarters attacked. Nevertheless, to have left matters as they were would have been to needlessly jeopardize the interest of the soldiers in the division, both as regards training and leadership.\n\nThe first and foremost consideration was capable officers throughout every branch of the organization, and today none know better than the men themselves how important, and for their interests, were the changes made at Camp Hancock.\n\nThe weeding-out process removed many officers either for physical defects, age or for other reasons deemed in the interests of the service. Many of the officers so removed were patriotic, sincere men, who had given a lifetime of service to the guard and were loved and respected by the men of their commands, but in this war there was no room for sentiment and so some had to suffer.\n\nGENERAL MUIR TAKES CHARGE\n\nMajor General Clements, the guards division commander when it went to camp, was early separated from direct contact with his command by being sent overseas on an observation trip, and upon his return was retired and replaced by Major General Charles E. Muir. Before being relieved of his command, Major General Clements had also removed and shifted a number of officers, including Colonel E.L. Kearns, commander of the Eighteenth Regiment, of Pittsburgh. And Major General Muir did not hesitate to carry out this policy of swinging the ax whenever he became convinced the service could be benefited.\n\nMaj. Gen. Charles Muir\n\nA lifelong and thorough soldier, Major General Muir had not been long in command of the division before improvement was noticeable in the discipline and morale of the troops. Regulations Muir they called him. He demanded promptness and efficiency on the part of officers and men and he did not hesitate to speak his mind when things were not to his liking.\n\nHe won the admiration and confidence of the men by demanding respect for them on the part of officers as well as absolute obedience by the men. And from that time on there was a new spirit of service, a new atmosphere about the camp reflected in every activity. Thus was the 28th Division re-made, and thus was it brought up to the new standard of proficiency where it stood first on the list of all the National Guard divisions of the United States.\n\nLOCAL GUARD REGIMENTS\n\nBefore proceeding further with the story of the activities of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania units in the Great War, it would be well to examine somewhat the history of the guard regiments from this section of the state and also to set forth the results of the reorganization whereby these regiments may be identified in the Army of the United States. This history will deal chiefly with the 28th and 80th Divisions, because it was in these divisions where a large majority of these men served.\n\nThe 319th and 320th Regiments of infantry, 160th Brigade, 80th Division, were the units comprised for the most part of the selected men from Pittsburgh and the western end of the state, although many were scattered throughout this organization in the various arms of the service.\n\nThe guard regiments were the 10th Infantry (now the 110th Infantry), 55th Brigade, 28th Division; 18th Infantry (now the 111th Infantry) and 16th Infantry (now the 112th Infantry), 56th Brigade, 28th Division; 1st Artillery (now the 107th Artillery), 53rd Artillery Brigade, 28th Division; 1st Field Battalion, Signal Corps (now the 103rd Field Signal Battalion), 28th Division; Ambulance Companies (now the 103rd Sanitary Train), and Field Hospitals No. 111 and 112, 28th Division; Truck Companies No. 5 and 6 became the 103rd Supply Train of the 28th Division.\n\nTHE FIGHTING TENTH\n\nThe 110th Infantry, formerly the Tenth Regiment of the National Guard, was mustered into the state service in December, 1873. Its military district comprises the counties of Westmoreland, Washington, Somerset, Blair, Fayette, Indiana, Beaver and Greene. The respective company headquarters are located at Greensburg, Latrobe, Mount Pleasant, Connellsville, Somerset, Holidaysburg, Blairsville, Indiana, New Brighton, Monongahela, Washington and Waynesburg.\n\nColonel John A. Black, of Greensburg, was it's first commanding officer, and he was succeeded by Colonel Alexander L. Hawkins, who had been Captain of Company H, at Washington. The regiment served during the Spanish-American war in the Philippines, where it obtained the sobriquet of the Fighting Tenth. It's tour of duty there was from July 17, 1898, until July 1, 1899, when it embarked for home. The regiment suffered casualties in the Philippines of: killed in action 6; wounded 70; died of wounds 9; died of disease 6; and missing 1.\n\nThe death of Colonel Hawkins occurred on shipboard July 18, while on the journey home. The regiment was re-organized in 1900, with Colonel James E. Barnett as Commander who served in that capacity until 1907. He was succeeded by Colonel Richard Coulter Jr., of Greensburg. The regiment served on the Mexican border during the Mexican aggressions from July 8, 1916, until October 4 of the same year.\n\nIn August 1917, Colonel Coulter was promoted to be Brigadier General and he was succeeded in command of the regiment by Lieutenant Colonel Henry W. Coulter. In the reorganization for service overseas as part of the 28th Division the table of organization called for 3,750 officers and men, and to effect this change the Third Infantry was directed to transfer the enlisted personnel of that organization, less 346 men to the Tenth (now 110th) Regiment. Orders also assigned some officers of the third regiment to the 110th and Colonel George E. Kemp was named as regimental commander, with Lieutenant Colonel Coulter the second in command.\n\nPITTSBURGHS OWN\n\nThe Eighteenth regiment was Pittsburghs Own and perhaps the most historic military organization in the state and one of the oldest in the nation. It was known as the Duquesne Greys and was organized August 5, 1831. In the Mexican War it served as Company K, First Pennsylvania Volunteers. In the Civil War it served as Company B, Twelfth Pennsylvania Volunteers and gave 69 officers to the Union Army, including Major General James S. Negley and seven colonels.\n\nThe Duquesne Greys was organized as a regiment of the National Guard of Pennsylvania in September 1869. The organization in the early days of it's existence was given certain special privileges, vested rights and immunities, and all military codes of the Commonwealth since 1832 have contained clauses recognizing these grants made by the Legislature.\n\nDuring the Spanish-American War the regiment became the Eighteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers. It was on Mexican border service during the Mexican aggressions in 1916, was called to do patrol duty in the state April 12, 1917, and drafted into the Federal service August 5, 1917, by proclamation of the President. Upon reorganization of the 28th Division it became the 111th Infantry, 56th Brigade. Sufficient of the enlisted and commissioned personnel of the Sixth Infantry were transferred to the Eighteenth to being it up to the new standards.\n\nSince the organization of the Duquesne Greys as a regiment in the National Guard of Pennsylvania, it has been commanded by Colonel David Campbell, 1869-1870; Colonel Presley N. Guthrie, 1870-1883; Colonel Chambers McKibben, 1883-1884; Colonel Norman M. Smith, 1884-1899; Colonel Frank I. Rutledge, 1899-1909; Colonel Albert J. Logan, 1909-1912; Colonel James H. Bigger, 1912-1916. Colonel Edward L. Kearns was in command of the regiment on the Mexican border and also when it went into training at Camp Hancock.\n\nTHE SIXTEENTH REGIMENT\n\nThe Sixteenth Regiment, used as a nucleus around which to build the 112th Regiment, hails from the thriving oil and manufacturing cities and counties of Western Pennsylvania north of Pittsburgh. It was organized in 1878 with General John A. Wiley, a veteran of the Civil War, as its first colonel.\n\nFrom the time of it's organization until it's entry into the service of the United States during the Great War, it had but three commanders; General Wiley, General Willis J. Hulings and Colonel George C. Richards. During the Spanish-American War the regiment saw active service in Puerto Rico and was frequently mentioned in official dispatches for its excellent work. At the close of the Spanish-American War the regiment was reorganized by bringing in five companies of the old Fifteenth infantry which then went out of existence.\n\nThe respective company headquarters are located at Oil City, Corry, Bradford, Kane, Franklin, Erie, Ridgeway, Warren, Kittanning, Butler and Grove City.\n\nIn the new reorganization at Camp Hancock sufficient commissioned and enlisted personnel to make up the new standard were drawn from the Eighth infantry, which formerly had headquarters at Harrisburg and was recruited from the central portion of the state.\n\nFIRST FIELD ARTILLERY\n\nThe First Field Artillery, which became the 107th Field Artillery of the new Army, dates back to Civil War days for it was formed around Battery B from the Allegheny Valley, known as Hamptons Battery. Hamptons Battery was organized October 8, 1861 and served in the Civil War from 1861 to 1865. It was in some of the greatest battles of the Rebellion including Bull Run, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg and others.\n\nAs a regimental unit the First Artillery was officially organized November 30, 1915. The headquarters are in Pittsburgh, but it's batteries are drawn from all sections of the state. The regiment was in service during the Spanish-American War but did not leave the country. During the Mexican aggression, the regiment was stationed on the Mexican border. Colonel William S. McKee was the commander at the time the regiment went into training at Camp Hancock.\n\nThe First Field Battalion, Signal Corps, which became the 103rd Field Signal Battalion of the 28th Division, was recruited in and around Pittsburgh a number of years ago and was composed of experts in all branches of signal work. The battalion was considered one of the very best in the United States by reason of it's skilled enlisted and commissioned personnel.\n\nIt saw service on the Mexican border during the Mexican aggressions. How well this battalion accounted for itself in the Great War will be apparent to all who read of it's exploits in the chapters to follow. The battalion was in command of Major Frederick T. Miller when it went into training at Camp Hancock.\n\nOFF FOR FRANCE!\n\nThe Truck Companies which became the 103rd Supply Train, the Ambulance Companies which became part of the 103rd Sanitary Train, and the Field Hospitals which took the numbers 110, 111 and 112 were all recruited for the most part in Allegheny County and had been part of the state guard organization with headquarters in Pittsburgh.\n\nLate in April 1918, the 28th Division completed it's training and was declared ready for preliminary work close to the scene of actual fighting. Overseas orders were received by General Muir. The division embarked May 3 and was in France by June 1, 1918.\n\nThe 80th Division was transported to France during the latter part of June and the forepart of July 1918.\n\nIt was almost impossible to obtain an accurate record of the many shifts in the commissioned personnel of the 28th Division during the time which elapsed between its arrival at Camp Hancock and departure for overseas. There were many changes and additions due to the reorganization as well as in the career officers who were found unfit physically and otherwise.\n\nThe following officers were in command of the principal units from Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania when the 28th Division embarked for France: 110th Infantry, Colonel George E. Kemp; 111th Infantry, Colonel Edward C. Shannon; 112th Infantry, Lieutenant Colonel Albert C. Crookston; 103rd Field Signal Battalion, Major Frederick G. Miller.\n\nCurious Frenchmen watch as the doughboys of the 28th Division arrive in France, June 1918.\n\nBATTLE CHRONOLOGY OF THE 28TH DIVISION\n\nJuly 6 - Under shell fire in rear of the line below the Marne.\n\nJuly 15 to July 21 - Stopped last German offensive and participated in the counter attack which started the German retreat.\n\nJuly 24 to August 4 - The drive from the Marne to the Vesle.\n\nAugust 4 to September 4 - Battle of Fismes and Fismettes.\n\nSeptember 10 to September 25 - In rest billets in St. Mihiel sector under constant artillery fird while being incorporated as part of First American Army.\n\nSeptember 26 to October 10 - Participated in The Battle of the Meuse, better known as the Argonne-Meuse Offensive.\n\nTowns and positions freed of invaders by division, alone of with other troops: St. Agnan, La-Chapelle-Monthodon, Boise de Conde, Epieds, Trugny, Courpoil, La Charmel, Fresnes, Roncheres, Courmont, Boise de Grimpettes, Sergy, Fismes, Fismette, Blanzy-les-Fismes, Barbonval, Glennes, Neuvilly, Boureuiles, Varennes, Montblainville, Baulby, Apremont, Chatel-Cheherry, Fleville.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAMERICANS ARRIVE JUST IN TIME\n\nWhen the 28th Division arrived in France our allies were facing the most critical period of the war. All during the previous winter and early spring the Germans had prepared for a series of drives which they expected to break the backbone of the British and French armies before the Americans could arrive in force.\n\nThe German expectations were heralded to the world, so confident was the enemy high command that nothing could go wrong with the carefully worked-out plans. The Russian fiasco had released to them many thousands of seasoned veterans and, with these added to the armies already on the West Front, the order to advance was given on March 21, 1918. Then on a 50-mile front, stretching from La Fere to Arras, the Germans went over the top.\n\nThe French and British lines joined in and around St. Quentin, and the objective was to force a break and separate the forces of the two allies. This plan did not succeed, but the enemy was able to drive a great wedge, and Amiens, the important British distributing point, was seriously menaced.\n\nThe second phase of the German offensive was launched April 9 against the British in the Ypres sector, and with such fury and persistence that Marshal Haigs troops were thrown back for a considerable distance before they were able finally to stem the assault. But the British line did not break and the French sent reinforcements whereby it was possible to counterattack and regain a portion of the territory lost.\n\nRaids and local actions then constituted the principal activities for several weeks while the Germans were preparing for their third effort. It began May 27 when the Crown Princes army was hurled forth from Chemin des Dames, in Champagne. The Allied armies were forced back until the enemy had reached the Marne and Chateau-Thierry by June 1.\n\nThe French capital Paris was directly threatened. It was at this juncture of the German offensive that American troops were rushed to the front and so successfully helped the French stem the oncoming hordes of the Kaiser. Every American knows the story of Chateau-Thierry and Cantigny.\n\nSituation on the Western Front, July 1918, when the 28th Division arrived to help stop the German advance.\n\nThe Spring Offensive had gained much territory, but the Hun lacked the strength for a push to Paris.\n\nThe fresh American troops provided the manpower needed to bolster the Allied defense.\n\nWHAT THE AMERICANS DID\n\nHere are the words of the Commander in Chief, General Pershing:\n\n\"The Allies faced a crisis equally as grave as that of the Picardy offensive in March. Again every available man was placed at Marshal Fochs disposal, and the Third Division, which had just come from it's preliminary training in the trenches, was hurried to the Marne. It's motorized machine-gun battalion preceded the other units and successfully held the bridgehead at the Marne, opposite Chateau-Thierry.\"\n\n\"The Second Division, in reserve near Montdidier, was sent by motor trucks and other available transport to check the progress of the enemy towards Paris. The division attacked and retook the town and railroad station at Bouresches and sturdily held it's ground against the enemys best guard divisions.\"\n\n\"In the Battle of Belleau Wood, which followed, our men proved their superiority and gained a strong tactical position, with far greater loss to the enemy than ourselves. On July 1, before the Second was relieved, it captured the village of Vaux with most splendid precision.\"\n\nUnited States Marines drive the Germans from Belleau Wood.\n\nThus the enemy began to secure demonstration of the fighting ability of the Americans, and to meet lines of adamant resistance that would neither bend nor break. The enemy was stopped at the Marne, but one week later opened another offensive between Montdidier and Novon in a new thrust for Paris.\n\nThe allied supreme command had advance information and this blow was readily checked. This was the situation during the last days of June, the darkest hour of the Allied cause when it was feared that Paris was doomed and such a catastrophe would literally take the heart out of the French.\n\nIt was during these stirring times in June that the Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania infantrymen were billeted within sight of Paris and hearing of the wonderful work of their countrymen who were privileged to be taking part in the mighty struggle.\n\nThey heard of Chateau-Thierry, Bois de Belleau, Bouresches, Cantigny, those milestones already recorded in the history of the American arms and they fretted and strained at the leash which held them far from where there were deeds of valor to be performed and glory to be won.\n\nNOTE: Brookline's Sgt. Raymond P. Cronin was a member of the 1st Battalion, 5th Regiment, 4th Marine Brigade, assigned to the U.S. 2nd Divsion during the Battle of Belleau Wood. He was killed during the Battle of Hill 142. For his bravery during that engagement, Sgt. Cronin was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross and the Silver Star Citation. Learn more about Sgt. Raymond P. Cronin, Brookline's most decorated soldier.\n\nIt was during this Battle of Belleau Woods that the United States Marine Corps Leathernecks earned the nickname \"Devil Dogs.\" The German soldiers were so shocked by the fierce grit and determination showed by the Marines under the most horrific of conditions that they began calling them \"Teufel Hunden.\" They name stuck and to this day a U.S. Marine is refered to as a \"Devil Dog.\"\n\nBRIGADED WITH THE BRITISH\n\nWhen the division arrived in France it was split up into small units and brigaded with the British troops to receive it's final instruction before going to the front. At times the men became discouraged as the result of what they deemed an exceptionally long training period for they felt fit to meet any Boche that ever lived. Some of the men even began to wonder if they were ever to see any of the real fighting.\n\nThe Supreme Command had worked out a special system for training new troops whereby they were gradually brought to that state of steadiness and perfection required for the line by a series of movements ever nearer the front and thus closer and closer to the sound of the guns. Then the artillery fire where through experience gained, at times as the result of casualties, their nerves were steeled to withstand the din of battle.\n\nNext there was a period in the front line under the watchful eye of experienced officers. But the Americans made good.\n\nDuring the course of training with the British, the Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania troops were stationed near Lumbres and later at French training centers near Gonesse and Rebais.\n\nThe Division was partly reassembled a few miles northwest of Paris with headquarters at Gonesse. This town is about ten miles from the heart of the French capital. The four infantry regiments together with the engineers were scattered throughout the surrounding towns and countryside wherever billets were available.\n\nUNITS ARE SEPARATED\n\nAt the time of arrival in France, the artillery brigade of the division, which included the 107th Regiment, was separated from the other units and sent to an artillery training camp many miles away. Other units had been sent to other places for specialized training.\n\nThe infantry and engineer regiments assembled first and then awaited the arrival of other units at the divisional center, and it was during this wait that the Pennsylvania doughboys began to long for a nearer approach to that direction from which came the low rumbling sound like continuous thunder. To the southeast on clear days they could see the great Eiffel Tower in Paris.\n\nBut the men did not get much time to ponder over the reasons for the delay in keeping them out of the conflict. They were busy those warm July days in going through that maze of work incidental to their final graduation from the school of the soldier. It was a trying period but it was soon forgotten in the days which followed.\n\nThe Germans were preparing for another thrust at the Marne. The bald, naked truth is that the British and French were fearful that they did not have sufficient men to stop the Hun. Even during the last rush the lines were but thinly held and would probably have given away had not the few American troops which were ready been rushed up in the night in motor trucks and thrown into the battle.\n\nAs appeal had gone forth for more Americans, and casting aside all thoughts of a distinct American Army for the time being, General Pershing offered all the troops available to be brigaded with the French and British armies in a supreme effort to save the world.\n\nThe American Army at that time was merely an army on paper because it had not yet been assembled. Divisions were the largest unit then working as a whole and by brigading these divisions with the British and French the gaps would be stopped up and their forces strengthened by all the available American forces. Their army units were functioning with the experience of the long years of war and it was an easy task to assimilate the American divisions. Time was short, too, in which to work effectively.\n\nA convoy of trucks carrying soldiers to the front line.\n\nIt was at this juncture in the fortunes of our Allies that the order came down the line for the 28th Division to prepare for a journey. The artillery brigade had not yet come up to join the division, so the infantry and engineers were to go away without it.\n\nWhen the time came to depart for their new destination the men noticed that long lines of motor trucks awaited them and there was much jubilation, for here indeed was evidence of a respite from the wearisome hikes. They were to ride in state, for the motor trucks looked to them like the best to be had in the way of transportation.\n\nThere was expectancy in the very air, for to be accorded the luxury of a motor ride was unusual up to that time for the men of the 28th. However, they were disappointed when the direction taken was not to the northeastward or to the northward from whence came that rumbling sound, but eastward from Paris.\n\nThey journeyed on through pretty French villages where the townspeople greeted them as saviors when it was discovered they were Americans. The Pennsylvanians sang and cheered until they were hoarse. Soon they came to a little river, the Petit Morin, and down along it's beautiful winding valley the great trucks lumbered carrying their happy and cheerful burdens.\n\nSuddenly the men discovered that the distant thunder was gradually getting louder, and they commenced to realize that they were approaching that zone where the guns were continuously belching forth their messengers of death. They knew, too, from the people along the way that they were nearer the battle lines, and then finally they stopped in a little town beside the river.\n\nAT MONTMIRAIL\n\nThis town was Montmirail and the distant guns could be heard distinctly. Part of the division passed through Montmirail and stopped at another town a few miles to the eastward. This town was Vauchamps. The rear of the column turned off and stopped at Verdelot, to the westward a few miles from Montmirail. The surrounding countryside was dotted with villages and in the three towns and these villages the local doughboys and engineers were billeted.\n\nThe pause here was but another step in the advanced training of the men so that they could become more familiar with the sound of the guns, and it was only a few days before they ceased to notice that ever rising and falling rumble which made the earth tremble under foot even at that distance.\n\nNow the soldiers from Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania began to grow serious and to buckle down to their training work with even more determination to approach nearer perfection, for they realized that the day would soon come when they would have an opportunity to let the folks at home, and the world, know that the men of the 28th were not afraid of anything the Hun had to offer.\n\nWithin a few days they commenced to grow restless, however, because they had not moved nearer to the guns so that they might at least obtain a distant view of the activities which were going on just to the north of them; activities among the most important in the long war and with Paris as the stake. They were not more than ten to fourteen miles from the front lines along the Marne and could not understand why they were not up there helping the French to hold back the enemy from any further advances.\n\nThis was the situation as it pertained to the Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania regiments during the last days in June. Little did the men dream that before the end of another month they would have decisively demonstrated their mastery over the pick of the Prussian soldiery and had written large on the pages of history that state of valor and achievement which sent a thrill throughout America, and the Kaiser reeling with disappointment and chagrin.\n\nAnd little did they realize that there were many there in those last days which would never be with them again; many whom would be found, after the tide of battle passed, with cold set features and with the light gone from their eyes, the victims of the Hun; others cruelly shattered in mind and body and facing a lifetime of helplessness and misery.\n\nBut even if these soldiers from Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania could have known in advance the bloody days directly ahead of them they would not have been less keen for the carnage; to have known would have only whetted their desire to rise to even greater heights of bravery and daring if such were possible. There were folks at home who in other days had spoken of the guardsmen as tin soldiers.\n\nAnd there were officers of the regular military establishment who had scoffed at them and questioned their usefulness in a crisis. Both these insults were to be wiped out forever; wiped out in such a sea of blood by men who were to prove themselves the peers of any men-at-arms the world had ever known that a blush of shame would mount to the cheek of every person who ever uttered an unkind remark against the old Pennsylvania National Guard.\n\nON THE FOURTH OF JULY\n\nCame July 1, 1918, and the Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania boys were still billeted in and around the vicinity of Montmirail, from ten to fourteen miles from the front lines on the Marne. They were planning for some sort of celebration for the Fourth in order to help while away the tedious hours of waiting for a shot at the Boche.\n\nSomething extra in the way of food to be topped off with concerts, sports, etc., was on the program. There was some comfort in the prospect of getting away from the tiresome and heavy routine, too, because they expected to be allowed to rest at least part of Independence Day.\n\nMidnight, Wednesday, July 3, 1918, there was a stir in camp when the 109th Regiment, from Philadelphia and the eastern part of the state, was rousted out and formed into companies in heavy marching order. Here at last was a prospect of action! Wild rumors flew up and down the line to the effect that the Hun had broken through and that the Pennsylvanians were going out to stop him. Some of the Pittsburghers and Western Pennsylvanians in the 110th, 111th and 112th Regiments heard of the sudden movement and were wondering why it had not been their luck to be called.\n\nThe night rang with the hastily snapped out commands as officers prepared the 109th Regiment to move forward. Then when the order to march at double time was given the men were sure that something was happening. It was a long, weary hike with the sound of the guns ever getting closer. Then, just before the dawn, the head of the column was stopped by a staff officer who arrived in the sidecar of a motorcycle, and Colonel Millard D. Brown, of Philadelphia, in command of the regiment, was ordered to return to billets.\n\nThis was a disappointment indeed, and when the order for a short rest was given the men just dropped down in their tracks, equipment and all. They were dead tired after the long, hurried journey. But while there were prospects of real work to do they were willing to bear without flinching the rigors of that wearisome march in the dark.\n\nThe night had been cool, but when they were ready to trudge back towards their billets the sun was well up and beating down in all its July fury upon their heads. They thought of the celebration they had missed back in camp, and they wondered what the loved ones back in America were doing to while away the holiday.\n\nCHUCKLES OVER FALSE ALARM\n\nIt was night before all the companies were finally back in camp, and so all thought of any Fourth festivities was gone. They were mighty glad to crawl into bed. As to the celebration conducted by the other regiments, it is said by officers, that, when it became generally known that the 109th had gone forward in the night, the men considered themselves so out of luck that they didnt care whether they extracted any joy out of the Fourths festivities or not. However, the men of the other regiments surely did chuckle the next day when they learned of what the 109th had been through.\n\nBut during this period the Pennsylvanians were wondering as to the experiences of certain of their number who were actually on the front line receiving advanced instruction under the French. Several platoons had been picked from the Division and sent in with the French just west of Chateau-Thierry. This sector was not a quiet one, nor was it a really active just at that time.\n\nTwo of these platoons were from the old Eighteenth, under the command of Lieutenants Cedric H. Benz, of Company B, and John H. Shenkel, of Company A, both of Pittsburgh. Then the sector in which they were stationed commenced to grow hotter as each hour passed. On July 1 the French decided to launch attacks against the nearby village of Vaux and Hill 204.\n\nThe Americans carefully watched the French go about the preparations for this attack, with that skill which is only obtained after long and arduous campaigning. The Americans were invited to take position where they could easily view the whole operation.\n\nThe platoons from Pittsburgh had made such an impression on the French that the French Commander informed them they might participate in the attack if they so desired, but that such action would be entirely voluntary. Those who elected to go were invited to step out of the ranks and every man of the two platoons came forward with a snap that demonstrated how eager they were to get into some actual fighting.\n\nThey went into the battle with the French, and under French command and they were the first troops of the 28th Division to engage in important fighting. Here is the story of that attack told by the French general commanding:\n\nAMERICANS ROUT THE ENEMY\n\nOn the morning of July 1 a platoon of the 111th Infantry, in command of Lieutenant Shenkel, participated with several platoons of French infantry in the attack on Hill 204. The battle opened with sharp machine gun fire from the German forces, concealed in trees, underbrush and trenches. Immediately, on gaining the heights of Hill 204, Lieutenant Shenkel deployed his troops to the right and left of him for the purpose of making flank movements.\n\nAs the Pittsburghers and the French commenced to close in on the German troops an avalanche of machine gun fire greeted them. The soldiers refused to give ground and continued their advance. Seeing that the machine gun fire could not check the advance, the German officer in command called for a barrage artillery fire. But before this could be laid down the Americans had routed the enemy from his first line of trenches.\n\nLieutenant Benz went in on the left of Hill 204 with his platoon and together with the French completely routed the German forces. He succeeded in bringing thirty-nine prisoners back to his lines.\n\nAmerican soldiers attacking a German position near Chateau-Thierry, July 1918.\n\nThe French general in his report on the work of Lieutenant Benz said:\n\nLieutenant Benz and his platoon of American and French soldiers, in spite of the firing of the enemys heavy and light machine guns, trench mortars and riflemen placed in trees, bravely threw themselves on their adversaries in a fierce hand-to-hand contest. In a thick and almost impregnable wood, they not only routed the German forces but took thirty-nine prisoners back to the allied lines.\n\nThe sector where Lieutenant Benz operated was of the utmost importance. The enemy had concentrated large forces, and a menacing shrapnel fire was continually harassing our troops located at Vaux directly within the range. The lieutenant and his men started towards the crest of the hill. They soon gained its heights and were forcing their way through the heavy underbrush when a burst of machine gun bullets was sprayed on them.\n\nFOUGHT LIKE DEMONS\n\nTaking position as skirmishers the men pressed forward even under this heavy fire, while the enemy troops quickly retired to second line trenches. The lieutenant saw a chance for a rush before the enemy could set up his machine guns in the new position and his men were quickly upon them, forcing them back to the their line and then finally out of the woods.\n\nIt was then that a number of the Germans became panic-stricken and beat a hasty retreat, leaving Benz with his thirty-nine prisoners.\n\nLieutenant Shenkel was also busy on the other side of the hill during all this, for by a flanking movement a detachment of German soldiers had succeeded in trapping Shenkel and a squad of his men. This crisis was quickly broken up by a counterattack.\n\nThe lieutenant and his seven men fought like veritable demons, cutting and hacking their way through the Germans with bayonets and the butts of their rifles. Lieutenant Shenkel flirted with death more than once that day, for three times he was targeted by a German sniper who was concealed in a tree. Each time the bullet pierced part of his uniform.\n\nIn commending Lieutenant Shenkel for his part in this battle the French high command, after telling of his ardor and bravery in the taking of the hill, declared that the American people should be proud of the wonderful soldiers that are now fighting with the allies.\n\nThe odds were ten-to-one against you, said the General, but this great disadvantage did not dampen the ardor and bravery of your men. You troops today did what I thought was the impossible. You have taken a position which is of the utmost importance.\n\nAmerican soldiers engaging the Germans in close combat.\n\nThus with the taking of Hill 204 one of the most important gains of the Marne sector was made. The Germans, prior to the engagement with the French and Americans, had concentrated more than 1,000 soldiers and an exceptionally large amount of ammunition.\n\nThey were preparing for an attack on Vaux, which had been previously wrested from their grasp by the Marines. Had not the Pittsburghers taken Hill 204 the Germans would have had a commanding position whereby they could have readily shelled the Americans out of the town.\n\nThe battle opened at 6:00am, July 1, and raged all that day, Before dawn of the next day there was not a single Boche remaining on Hill 204.\n\nGLORY FOR OLD EIGHTEENTH\n\nBoth the Pittsburgh lieutenants were cited by the French for their part in this glorious victory and both received the coveted Croix de Guerre. In speaking later of the work of the men who were in his platoon, Lieutenant Shenkel said that the boys showed wonderful courage and ability and that the people of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania should be proud of every one of them. Lieutenant Benz says that too much credit cannot be given the boys of the Old Eighteenth for the wonderful work they did in chasing the Boche from Hill 204.\n\nBefore many hours had passed the news of this action filtered back to the regiment, and also stories of the wonderful work of their comrades, with the result that each man pledged himself, in his own heart, to live up to the standards established by the men of the two platoons from Pittsburgh. Now more than ever before were the men chafing under the restraint which held them back from the front lines, for they were absolutely confident that they could outfight any Boche that ever lived.\n\nBut the regiments kept up that dayly routine of drill, bayonet work and rifle practice, together with frequent hikes and all the other activities of intensive training. The men at times began to feel they were going stale from overtraining, but the real trouble was their anxiety to get into action.\n\nThe work of the airplane in attacking, at low altitudes, the ammunition and transport wagons of\n\nthe enemy has been very successful in cutting off huge quantities of supplies for the front lines.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE BATTLE OF THE MARNE\n\nDuring the first days of July, 1918, Marshal Foch had been gradually working the Germans into a position where there was only one loophole towards which to launch the forthcoming drive, and the Supreme Commander wanted the enemy to make just that move. The direction was straight south at the tip of the Soissons-Rheims salient and in the direction where the Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania troops were stationed.\n\nHere Marshal Foch set a trap, for although the lines were only thinly held by the French, he had the Americans in reserve. He had already tested the valor of some of the Pennsylvanians and the other American forces assembled in that section, and he was supremely confident that the great moment had arrived.\n\nThe Germans would cross the Marne, but they wouldnt go far until they met those unyielding lines of doughboys. There would be a violent clash as the Americans unloosed their pent up energy, and then the Germans would find themselves on the defensive and making a hurried effort to get back on the other side of the Marne.\n\nThat was the way Marshal Foch expected the affair to work out. He was banking on the Americans, and the Americans did not fail him. Then it was that the German military leaders realized for the first time that the war was lost to them. General Pershing said it was the turning point of the war, and the ex-Crown Prince has since admitted that he knew it was the beginning of the end for Germany. The Boche had never met an Iron division.\n\nJuly 5, 1918, there was a noticeable stir at brigade headquarters. Then messengers began to hurry to the various regimental headquarters and soon the word was passed along that the regiments were to move up in closer support of the French lines. This was cheering news indeed. At last the Pittsburghers and Western Pennsylvanians were actually going up into the zone of fire where the great shells would go screeching overhead and fall menacingly near at times.\n\nEarly on the morning of July 6, 1918, the 110th, 111th, and the engineers shouldered their equipment and moved forward to the positions assigned them. The 112th was held in reserve.\n\nDuring the journey one of the soldiers was seen to reach up and pull a branch from a tree alongside the road. He stuck a leaf-covered twig in his cap with the remark that now I am camouflaged. The flies were troublesome and his comrades soon perceived that the soldier with the camouflage was not bothered.\n\nThen there was a rush for head decorations until the regiments looked like the famous Italian Bersaglieri. The Bersaglieri wear plumed hats. The 110th, 111th and the engineers arrived at their positions without incident, except an occasional reminder from the Boche in the shape of a shell which passed overhead and exploded in the distance. The cannonading also became ever louder and increased in volume as the troops advanced.\n\nDODGING THE GERMAN SHELLS\n\nThe 109th Regiment did not fare so well, for it encountered an area in it's march northward which was being vigorously shelled by the Boche. The regiment had passed the little village of Artonges, where the Dhuys creek joins the road and then follows along the valley towards Pargny-la-Dhuys. The latter town was almost in sight when a shell burst in a field a few hundred yards away.\n\nThen an officer came rushing from brigade headquarters with orders for the regiment immediately to seek cover in the woods nearby. The Germans were raking the countryside in an attempt to locate French batteries. The shelling kept the regiment in the woods until July 10, 1918. Then came orders to advance, and after going through what was left of Pargny, after that terrific shelling, the regiment was ordered off the road into a long ravine.\n\nThen the bombardment started again and the men realized that it was much safer to have the protection of the ravine than to be caught on the shell-swept open road. For three days the enemy kept up the fire. July 13, 1918, when the hour for taps arrived, and no orders for the night had been given, the men realized that something was going to happen. At midnight the regiment was formed in light marching order - no heavy packs, no heavy clothes, nothing but fighting equipment and two days rations.\n\nThen the column moved northward through the night; up toward the Marne while star shells shed a glow from the sky and shrapnel and high explosives were being showered in all directions. When the column reached the designated position to the lef"
