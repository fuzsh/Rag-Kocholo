        "text": "1 July – 18 November 1916: the Somme. A Franco-British offensive that was undertaken after Allied strategic conferences in late 1915, but which changed its nature due to the German attack against the French in the epic Battle of Verdun, which lasted from late February to November. Huge British losses on the first day and a series of fiercely-contested steps that became attritional in nature. For all armies on the Western Front it was becoming what the Germans would call “materialschlacht”: a war not of morale, will or even manpower, but of sheer industrial material might. 15 September 1916 saw the first-ever use of tanks in the step known as the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. The British army in France is now approaching its maximum strength in numbers but is still developing in terms of tactics, technology, command and control.\n\nThe Somme is also the source of more mythology and mis-interpretation of the Great War than any other action in which Britain participated with the possible exception of the campaign at Gallipoli.\n\nBackground to the battle\n\nThe political and strategic background to the offensive\n\nThe tactical planning for the start of the offensive\n\nThe logistical preparations necessary before the offensive\n\nThe artillery bombardment before the infantry attack\n\nPart of a map contained in the British Official History [Crown Copyright]. The Somme offensive was begun by the British Fourth Army (red) and the French Sixth Army (blue), attacking the German Second Army (green). The map shows the position of the front line just before the start of the offensive.\n\nPart of a map contained in the British Official History [Crown Copyright]. The British Fourth Army faced three formidable German defensive systems of trenches, dugouts, underground shelters and deep barbed wire defences (green). The map shows the arrangement of the British Divisions deployed for the opening attack.\n\nOpening phase: the Battle of Albert, 1 – 13 July 1916\n\nIn this opening phase, the French and British assault broke into and gradually moved beyond the first of the German defensive systems. For the British, the attack on 1 July proved to be the worst day in the nation’s military history in terms of casualties sustained. It is the aspect of the battle that is most remembered and most written about, and for good reason – but to concentrate on the failures is to entirely miss the point of the Somme and why the battle developed into an epic period of the Great War.On the first day, British forces at the southern end of the British line made an impressive advance alongside the French Sixth Army, capturing the villages of Montauban and Mametz and breaking through the enemy’s defensive system. North of Mametz the attack was an almost unmitigated failure. The situation led to a redirection of effort, with the offensive north of the River Ancre effectively being closed down and all future focus being on the line south of Thiepval. There was a stiff fight for Trones Wood and costly, hastily planned and piecemeal attacks that eventually took La Boisselle, Contalmaison and Mametz Wood during the rest of the period up to 13 July.\n\nBritish order of battle for this phase\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\nIII Corps (Pulteney)\n\n1st Division;\n\n8th Division;\n\n12th (Eastern) Division;\n\n19th (Western) Division, which captured La Boisselle on 4 July;\n\n23rd Division, which captured Contalmaison on 9 July;\n\n34th Division.\n\nVIII Corps (Hunter-Weston) (transferred to Reserve Army on 4 July)\n\n4th Division;\n\n29th Division;\n\n31st Division;\n\n48th (South Midland) Division.\n\nX Corps (Morland) (transferred to Reserve Army on 4 July)\n\n12th (Eastern) Division;\n\n25th Division;\n\n32nd Division;\n\n36th (Ulster) Division;\n\n49th (West Riding) Division.\n\nXIII Corps (Congreve)\n\n3rd Division;\n\n9th (Scottish) Division;\n\n18th (Eastern) Division;\n\n30th Division, which captured Montauban on 1 July;\n\n35th Division.\n\nXV Corps (Watts)\n\n7th Division, which captured Mametz on 1 July;\n\n17th (Northern) Division, which captured Fricourt on 2 July;2\n\n21st Division;\n\n33rd Division;\n\n38th (Welsh) Division, best remembered for its costly fight for Mametz Wood.\n\nReserve Army (Gough)\n\nTook over VIII and X Corps on 4 July\n\nDetail: the fight for Montauban and Trones Wood\n\nDetail: the fight for Mametz\n\nSubsidiary attack on Gommecourt, 1 July 1916\n\nA local attack on the northern flank of the main offensive, designed to ensure that Germans could not send reserve troops southwards and to conceal the actual extent of the front being attacked. No efforts were made to keep preparations secret. Casualties were very high and it can be argued that the attack had no effect on the rest of the offensive.\n\nThird Army (Allenby)\n\nVII Corps (Snow)\n\n37th Division;\n\n46th (North Midland) Division;\n\n56th (1st London) Division.\n\nThe Battle of Bazentin (or the Bazentin Ridge), 14 – 17 July 1916\n\nBy 13 July the British advance had taken it to a point where it was now facing the second German defensive system. A well planned and novel night attack on 14 July took British troops through that system in the area of Bazentin. There was a fleeting but lost opportunity to capture High Wood beyond it.\n\nBritish order of battle for this phase\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\n2nd Indian Cavalry Division, which took part in a famous cavalry charge near High Wood on 14 July.\n\nII Corps (Jacobs)\n\n1st Division;\n\n23rd Division;\n\n34th Division.\n\nXIII Corps (Congreve)\n\n3rd Division, which captured Longueval;\n\n9th (Scottish) Division, which also captured Longueval on 18 July;\n\n18th (Eastern) Division, which captured Trones Wood on 14 July.\n\nXV Corps (Watts)\n\n7th Division, the first formation to enter High Wood;\n\n21st Division;\n\n33rd Division.\n\nReserve Army (Gough)\n\nX Corps (Morland)\n\n25th Division;\n\n32nd Division;\n\n48th (South Midland) Division, which captured Ovillers on 16 July;\n\n49th (West Riding) Division.\n\nThe attack at Fromelles, 19-20 July 1916\n\nOfficially not a part of the Battle of the Somme and positioned a considerable distance away, the attack at Fromelles was conceived to be a major diversionary action. The untried 5th Australian and 61st (2nd South Midland) Divisions were launched into an ill-planned attack against German defences which had already successfully repelled similar efforts in 1915. The attack achieved nothing of a diversionary nature and cost thousands of casualties.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nFirst Army (Monro)\n\nXI Corps (Haking)\n\n61st (2nd South Midland) Division;\n\n5th Australian Division.\n\nThe attacks on High Wood, 20 – 25 July 1916\n\nThe fight for High Wood, which had begun on 14 July, went on until mid-September. The wood sits on ground that gives the occupier militarily vital observation south to the Montauban ridge, east to Delville Wood and north east towards Flers and Guedecourt The first British units entered the wood late on 14 July 1916, but the Germans had recovered from the British breakthrough at Bazentin earlier that day and were now manning the “Switch Line” trench system which ran through the back of the wood. Both sides fought tenaciously to possess the wood. It became an epicentre of the bloody attack and counter-attack attritional fighting that characterised much of the Somme offensive after 14 July.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\nXIII Corps (Congreve)\n\n19th (Western) Division.\n\nXV Corps (Watts)\n\n5th Division;\n\n7th Division;\n\n33rd Division;\n\n51st (Highland) Division.\n\nThe Battle of Delville Wood, 15 July – 3 September 1916\n\nDelville Wood, which is within sight and today and easy walk of High Wood, was also fought over countless times for similar reasons and became a charnel house, choked with the dead of both sides. It is perhaps most remembered for the sustained attack mad by the South African Brigade of the 9th (Scottish) Division, a formation which was to all intents and purposes destroyed during its valiant efforts.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\nXIII Corps (Congreve) (relieved by XIV Corps at night 16-17 August)\n\n2nd Division;\n\n3rd Division;\n\n9th (Scottish) Division;\n\n24th Division;\n\n53rd Brigade of 18th (Eastern) Division.\n\nXIV Corps (Cavan) (relieved XIII Corps at night 16-17 August)\n\n20th (Light) Division;\n\n24th Division.\n\nXV Corps (Watts)\n\n7th Division;\n\n14th (Light) Division.\n\nThe Battle of Pozieres, 23 July – 3 September 1916\n\nPozieres was a small, straggling village on the main Albert-Bapaume road. It is situated on high ground that gives the occupier observation southwards along the road towards Ovillers, La Boisselle, Albert and beyond; to the east across to High Wood, Delville Wood and beyond; and westwards to Thiepval. Possession of Pozieres was key to making possible any further advances towards Bapaume, the capture of the Thiepval ridge and the breaking of resistance at High and Delville Woods. The battle for Pozieres and nearby Mouquet Farm became an epic in its own right, with tenacious German defence keeping determined British-Australian attack at bay for several weeks. This was the first large-scale Australian battle in France and proved to be its costliest in terms of total casualties.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\nIII Corps (Pulteney)\n\n1st Division;\n\n15th (Scottish) Division;\n\n19th (Western) Division;\n\n23rd Division;\n\n34th Division.\n\nReserve Army (Gough)\n\nNote: all below except 49th (West Riding) Division took part in fighting for Mouquet Farm\n\nII Corps (Jacobs)\n\n12th (Eastern) Division;\n\n25th Division;\n\n48th (South Midland) Division;\n\n49th (West Riding) Division.\n\nI ANZAC Corps (Birdwood)\n\n1st Australian Division;\n\n2nd Australian Division;\n\n4th Australian Division.\n\nThe Battle of Guillemont, 3 – 6 September 1916\n\nSouth of Delville Wood, the second German defensive system snaked down to the village of Guillemont. It became another place where men of both sides were cut down in their thousands, as attack and counter-attack took place.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\nXIV Corps (Cavan)\n\n5th Division;\n\n16th (Irish) Division;\n\n20th (Light) Division.\n\nXV Corps (Watts)\n\n7th Division;\n\n24th Division;\n\n55th (West Lancashire) Division.\n\nThe Battle of Ginchy, 9 September 1916\n\nAnother stoutly-defended location, Ginchy could only be attacked once Delville Wood and Guillemont were in British hands.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\nXIV Corps (Cavan)\n\n16th (Irish) Division;\n\n56th (1st London) Division.\n\nXV Corps (Watts)\n\n55th (West Lancashire) Division.\n\nThe Battle of Flers-Courcelette, 15 – 22 September 1916\n\nThis was a large-scale general renewal of the offensive after the weeks of attritional fighting for the third German system at Pozieres, High Wood, Delville Wood, Guillemont and Ginchy. It is historically noteworthy for being the first time that tanks were used in battle. Few in number, mechanically unreliable and as yet without proven tactics for their best use, the small numbers of tanks that actually went into action had an important positive effect. High Wood and Delville Wood were finally cleared and a deep advance was made to Flers and towards Combles. The Canadian Corps entered the Somme fighting for the first time.\n\nThe British army used tanks for the first time in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. Developed in great secrecy, they came as a surprise to the Germans and British troops alike. This London press advertisement appeared on 12 October 1916, just a few weeks later. The cartoonist, quite forgivably, has clearly never seen a tank but has done his best!\n\nOrder of battle\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\n1st Cavalry Division;\n\n2nd Indian Cavalry Division\n\nIII Corps (Pulteney)\n\n1st Division;\n\n15th (Scottish) Division, which captured Martinpuich;\n\n23rd Division;\n\n47th (2nd London) Division;\n\n50th (Northumbrian) Division;\n\n103rd Brigade of 34th Division.\n\nXIV Corps (Cavan)\n\nGuards Division;\n\n5th Division;\n\n6th Division;\n\n20th (Light) Division;\n\n56th (1st London) Division.\n\nXV Corps (Watts)\n\n14th (Light) Division;\n\n21st Division;\n\n41st Division;\n\n55th (West Lancashire) Division;\n\nNew Zealand Division.\n\nReserve Army (Gough)\n\nII Corps (Jacobs)\n\n11th (Northern) Division;\n\n49th (West Riding) Division.\n\nCanadian Corps (Byng)\n\n1st Canadian Division;\n\n2nd Canadian Division;\n\n3rd Canadian Division.\n\nThe Battle of Morval, 25 – 28 September 1916\n\nHaving broken through the prepared lines of German defence, the British force now faced a new set of challenges as it was now fighting in much flatter, open ground and approached the distant gentle slopes of the Transloy ridges. Fighting was, as before, severe but gradually the British chipped away and pushed forward. The weather began to turn autumnal, bringing rain, making the battlefield increasingly difficult and stretching men to limits of their physical endurance.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\nIII Corps (Pulteney)\n\n1st Division;\n\n23rd Division;\n\n50th (Northumbrian) Division.\n\nXIV Corps (Cavan)\n\nGuards Division, which captured Lesboeufs;\n\n5th Division;\n\n6th Division, which also captured Lesboeufs;\n\n20th (Light) Division;\n\n56th (1st London) Division, which captured Combles.\n\nXV Corps (Watts)\n\n21st Division, which captured Gueudecourt;\n\n55th (West Lancashire) Division;\n\nNew Zealand Division.\n\nThe Battle of Thiepval, 26 – 28 September 1916\n\nThiepval had been one of the strong points in the German first line that had proved so impossible for the British attack on 1 July. Now outflanked to the east, Thiepval and the heights on which it sat fell to an efficiently executed attack.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nReserve Army (Gough)\n\nII Corps (Jacobs)\n\n11th (Northern) Division;\n\n18th (Eastern) Division.\n\nV Corps (Fanshawe)\n\n39th Division.\n\nCanadian Corps (Byng)\n\n1st Canadian Division;\n\n2nd Canadian Division;\n\n3rd Canadian Division.\n\nThe Battle of Le Transloy, 1 – 18 October 1916\n\nA period of fighting in terrible weather in which the heavy, clinging, chalky Somme mud and the freezing, flooded battlefield became as formidable an enemy as the Germans. The British gradually pressed forward, still fighting against numerous counter-attacks, in an effort to have the front line on higher ground from which the offensive could be renewed in 1917.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\nIII Corps (Pulteney)\n\n9th (Scottish) Division;\n\n15th (Scottish) Division;\n\n23rd Division, which captured Le Sars;\n\n47th (2nd London) Division, which captured Eaucourt L’Abbaye;\n\n50th (Northumbrian) Division.\n\nNote: all above except 50th (Northumbrian) Division took part in attacks on the Butte de Warlencourt during this phase; 48th and 50th attacked that feature at a later date.\n\nXIV Corps (Cavan)\n\nGuards Division;\n\n4th Division;\n\n6th Division;\n\n20th (Light) Division;\n\n56th (1st London) Division.\n\nXV Corps (Watts)\n\n12th (Eastern) Division;\n\n21st Division;\n\n30th Division;\n\n41st Division;\n\n55th (West Lancashire) Division;\n\nNew Zealand Division;\n\n88th Brigade of 29th Division.\n\nReserve Army (Gough)\n\nCanadian Corps (Byng)\n\n1st Canadian Division;\n\n2nd Canadian Division;\n\n3rd Canadian Division;\n\n4th Canadian Division.\n\nThe Battle of the Ancre Heights, 1 October – 11 November 1916\n\nNow that Thiepval had fallen, the Germans no longer had dominating positions over looking the valley of the River Ancre. The British attack, long since dormant in this area, was now renewed.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nReserve Army (Gough)\n\nII Corps (Jacobs)\n\n18th (Eastern) Division, which captured the Schwaben Redoubt;\n\n19th (Western) Division;\n\n25th Division, which captured Stuff Redoubt;\n\n39th Division (transferred from V Corps on 4 October), which also captured the Schwaben Redoubt;\n\n4th Canadian Division (transferred from Canadian Corps on 4 October).\n\nNote: all above except 19th (Western) Division played a part in the capture of Regina Trench.\n\nV Corps (Fanshawe)\n\n39th Division (transferred to II Corps on 4 October).\n\nCanadian Corps (Byng) (withdrawn 17 October)\n\n1st Canadian Division;\n\n2nd Canadian Division;\n\n3rd Canadian Division;\n\n4th Canadian Division (transferred to II Corps on 17 October).\n\nThe Battle of the Ancre, 13 – 18 November 1916\n\nThe battle was now extended northwards across to the far side of he River Ancre. The British force attacked in fog and snow on 13 November from the very same front lines from which the attack had failed so badly on 1 July. Beaumont-Hamel was finally captured but Serre once again proved an objective too far. Considerable casualties were sustained before the battle was called off.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nFourth Army (Rawlinson)\n\nIII Corps (Pulteney)\n\n48th (South Midland) Division.\n\nFifth Army (Gough) (retitled from reserve Army)\n\nII Corps (Jacobs)\n\n18th (Eastern) Division;\n\n19th (Western) Division;\n\n39th Division;\n\n4th Canadian Division.\n\nV Corps (Fanshawe)\n\n2nd Division;\n\n3rd Division;\n\n32nd Division;\n\n37th Division;\n\n51st (Highland) Division, which captured Beaumont-Hamel;\n\n63rd (Royal Naval) Division.\n\nXIII Corps (Congreve)\n\n31st Division;\n\n120th Brigade of 40th Division.\n\nEnd of the Somme offensive\n\nThe Somme offensive had been conceived of as part of a huge simultaneous war-winning attack by the Allies on the Eastern and Western Fronts. The strategy was blunted by the German attack at Verdun in late February 1916, which turned French attentions to that area for most of the rest of the year. The strategy had failed. There was no striking territorial or positional benefit to an advance on the Somme: the war would not be won by advancing eastwards into yet more miles of rolling French farmland. It would have been tempting to abandon the offensive, but this was simply not possible: the obligations of coalition meant that the British had to keep on applying pressure on the Somme in order to relieve pressure on the French at Verdun: at least, that was the theory. Once the offensive had been reduced in its weight by the need to concentrate French forces at Verdun, the Somme’s only contribution to winning the war would be the material reduction of the German ability and willingness to fight. It can be argued that it did make such a material reduction, but it came at enormous and at least equivalent cost in Allied manpower and resources due to dogged and skilful German defensive fighting. While the Somme was going on, German high command was already making preparations to give up the ground and to withdraw into the impregnable defences the British would come to know as the Hindenburg Line.\n\nBut there is a British positive from the Somme: the army, much of which was a new citizen army raised in 1914, was learning its trade and beginning to match its enemy. Equipment, munitions, tactics, command and control were all rapidly developed as a result of the bloody debacle of the first day and of all the subsequent attritional fighting since. Even in the appalling ground and weather conditions of the later phases of the battle, it does not appear that morale fell. As the awful battles of 1917 would show, there was much necessary development and learning yet to come, and it came at high cost in blood – but the war-winning force of 1918 began its life on the Somme in 1916.\n\nLinks\n\nBattles of the Western Front in France and Flanders\n\nSir Douglas Haig’s second despatch (the Battle of the Somme, 1916)\n\nAmbulance Train evacuations from the Battle of the Somme\n\nBooks\n\n. . .\n\n1916 Battle of the Somme film – a must"
