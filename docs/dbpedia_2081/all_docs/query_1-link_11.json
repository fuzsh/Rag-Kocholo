        "text": "First Division (Regular Army)\n\nThe division insignia is a crimson figure “1”, on khaki background. Chosen because the numeral “1” represents the number of the division and many of its subsidiary organizations. Also, as proudly claimed, because it was the first division in France; first in sector; first to fire a shot at the Germans; first to attack; first to conduct a raid; first to be raided; first to capture prisoners; first to inflict casualties; first to suffer casualties; first to be cited singly in general orders; first in the number of the division, corps and army commanders and general staff officers produced from its personnel; last to leave war zone.\n\nThe first units left the United States June 14, 1917, and the last units arrived in France July 2, 1917. The division went into the Grondrecourt training area for training. It entered the line in the Sommerville sector, ten kilometers southeast of Nancy, for instructional purposes under French command October 21st, and withdrew the night of November 20, 1917. This sector was quiet. Entered the Ansauville section under tactical command of the French. This sector was approximately twenty kilometers northwest of Toul. Sector quiet with occasional active days. Division withdrew April 3d. The 1st Artillery Brigade was the only American artillery in action during this period. Entered the Cantigny section, five kilometers west of Montdidier, April 25th. The Cantigny operation was carried out the morning of May 28th, the division advancing the line three to six hundred yards on a twenty-two-hundred yard front. Division was relieved July 7, 1918. Entered the line the night of July 17, 1918, for the Soissons operation, approximately fifteen kilometers southwest of Soissons. The fighting was severe throughout the attack, especially July 20th and 21st. The division was relieved after having reached Berzy le Sec. Entered the Saizerais section on August 7th. The sector was quiet and the division was relieved August 24th.\n\nSt. Mihiel operation: Elements of the division commenced entering the sector of September 6th, completing the relief September 11th.

Crossed the Rhine on December 13th. Occupied its area east of Rhine in the Coblenz bridgehead, December 14th.\n\nGeneral Pershing, almost without exception, picked out the 1st Division for the vital position, or post of honor, in most of his big engagements, for example, he put the 1st Division in the front line for seventy-two continuous days and nights, without divisional relief, at the battle of Picardy, when the Germans were driven through from St. Quentin to Montdidier. Again, at the second battle of the Marne, which began July 18, 1918, and was the turning point of the entire war, Pershing put the 1st Division practically directly at the hinge of this great door movement, at Soissons, only one French division being on the inside of it, and the 2d Soissons, only one French division being on the inside of it, and the 2d Division, containing the much advertised marines, were placed two whole divisions farther away from the hinge of our right. Again, it was the 1st Division that Pershing gave the post of honor, the inside position, just east of dangerous Mont Sec, when the St. Mihiel salient was closed.\n\nThe division captured 165 officers and 6,304 men, numerous machine guns, pieces of artillery of all calibers and a great quantity of supplies.
