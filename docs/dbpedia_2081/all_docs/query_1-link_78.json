        "text": "The 56th Artillery, C.A.C.\n\nTranscribed from photo copied records of the original typed records Apr. 16, 1920 Obtained from the National Archives Records Administration, Washington D.C. Record Group 165 War Dept. General and Special Staff. History of the 56th CAC Regt. Box 330, 4W2/26/10/D Transcribed by Joe Hartwell 18 November, 1998\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nIn compliance with instructions contained in CONFIDENTIAL communication (322.05) dated War Department Adjutant Generals Office, Washington, November 20, 1917, the 56th Artillery (C.A.C) Regiment was organized by the Coast Defense Commander, Coast Defenses of Long Island Sound.\n\nAll transfers of enlisted personnel from the Coast Defenses to the Regiment being made effective December 20, 1917. The several organizations of the Regiment were made up of the following classes of troops on duty in the Defenses:\n\n1) Headquarters Company, Battery A and Battery C form enlisted personnel of the Regular Coast Artillery.\n\n2) Supply Company, Battery B, Battery D, Battery E and Battery F from enlisted personnel of the Connecticut National Guard Coast Artillery.\n\n3) Medical Detachment from personnel of the Regular Army and from the National Guard.\n\n4) The Band was originally the 11th Artillery Band but prior to the departure of the Regiment for France a number of the bandsmen were transferred back to the defenses and an equal number of men from the Connecticut Coast Artillery Band was transferred to the 56th Regiment Band.\n\nDuring the period that the Regiment was in training in the Coast Defenses, from the time the organization was completed to the time that orders were received to proceed overseas, a great many transfers of commissioned and enlisted personnel were made. The principal transfer being that of relieving fifty National Guardsmen from each of the Batteries composed of National Guard Troops and assigning in their stead fifty National Army Troops for each of those Batteries.\n\nIn General the several organizations were made up as follows:\n\nHeadquarters Company: Personnel from 14th Company, Long Island Sound, formerly the 4th Co. Fort Terry, New York, formerly the 100th Co. C.A.C. Also certain non-commissioned staff officers and enlisted specialists from the Coast Defenses. Also bandsmen from the 11th Artillery Band and the Conn. Coast Artillery Band.\n\nSupply Company: Composed principally of men from the 26th Co., Long Island Sound, formerly members of the Conn. Coast Artillery and men of the National Army who mostly came from Connecticut.\n\nMedical Detachment: Composed of men from the Regular Army and the Connecticut Coast Artillery.\n\nOrdnance Detachment: Composed of men on duty in the Coast Defenses and assigned to duty with the Regiment by Headquarters Eastern Department (Special Order No. 40, 1918)\n\nBattery A: Composed principally of men from the 13th and 16th Co's, Long Island Sound. The 13th Co. was originally the 133rd Co. C.A.C.\n\nBattery B: Composed principally of men from the 37th Co. Long Island Sound, formerly members of the Conn. Coast Artillery and members of the National Army most of whom came from Connecticut.\n\nBattery C: Composed principally of men from 3rd Co. Long Island Sound, formerly 5th Co. Fort H. G. Wright, N.Y. formerly the 146th Co. C.A.C.\n\nBattery D: Composed principally of men from 38th Co. Long Island Sound, formerly members of the Conn. Coast Artillery and members of the National Army most of whom came from Conn.\n\nBattery E: Composed principally of men from 29th Co. Long Island Sound, formerly members of the Conn. Coast Artillery and members of the national Army most of whom came from Conn.\n\nBattery F: Composed principally of men from 27th Co. Long Island Sound formerly members of the Conn. Coast Artillery and National Army men most of whom came from Conn.\n\nRECORD OF EVENTS\n\nAfter the organization of the Regiment was completed, December 20, 1917, the Regiment remained in the Coast Defenses of Long Island Sound until March 26, 1918. During this period training of commissioned and enlisted personnel was carried on to the fullest extent to fit the Regiment for overseas duty. Schools of instruction for Officers and men were established at Forts Terry and Wright by competent instructors. Enlisted men were sent to Automobile schools to take special courses.\n\nEvery man was fully equipped and requisitions for the Regimental equipment were forwarded and the material was received to be taken overseas when orders to leave arrived.\n\nOrders were received by the Regimental Commander to move the Regiment on March 26, 1918. On the afternoon of March 26, 1918 the entire Regiment consisting of 62 officers and 1679 enlisted men left Fort H.G. Wright, New York for overseas. The Regiment traveled by boat to New London, Conn. and from there by New York,New Haven & Hartford Railroad to Harlem River Yards, at this place the Regiment detrained and was transported by ferry to Pier 59 North River and boarded the Admiralty Transport No. 527, RMS Olympic. http://members.aol.com/WakkoW5/olympic.html\n\nRMS Olympic dressed out in her Dazzle paint. This was supposed to camoflage the ship and keep the U-boats from getting a good fix on there target. It was said that it really didn't do much good anyway.\n\nOn March 28th the 56th Regiment (62 Officers and 1679 Enlisted men) and the 59th Regiment (69 Officers and 1712 Enlisted men) together sailed on the White Star liner \"Olympic,\" without convoy. Colonel Sydney Grant, C.A.N.G., was in command of the 59th Regiment. The \"Olympic\" was headed for Liverpool, but wireless orders en route changed the course to Brest. Alternate concerts by the bands of the 56th and 59th helped relieve the tension that came from daily wearing of life preservers and that even the arrival of the convoying destroyers, in the danger zone, could not remove.\n\nThe Transport sailed from Port of Embarkation for France at 10 o'clock in the morning March 28, 1918. During the time the Regiment was aboard the Transport abandon ship drills were held frequently but nothing of importance occurred during the trip.\n\nOn April 3rd while the Transport was in mid-ocean, Private Leonard S. Davis a member of the Medical Detachment passed away from the effects of Pneumonia. Private Davis was buried at sea at 12 o'clock noon with full military honors.\n\nThe Transport arrived at Port of Embarkation, Brest , France at 8 o'clock P.M. April 4th, 1918. The Regiment started debarking on the morning of April 5th and marched to Pontaczen Barracks a distance of about 2 1/2 miles from the point of landing.\n\nThe Regiment was quartered in Barracks until April 7th when orders were received to move. The Field and Staff, Batteries D, E, F, and Supply Co. and one half (15 men) of Sanitary Detachment left Pontanczen Barracks 8 o'clock A.M. April 7th and marched to the Railroad yards at Brest and entrained for Clermont-Ferrand. The balance of the regiment left Pontanczen Barracks at 5:30 P.M. April 8th and marched to Brest and entrained for Clermont-Ferrand.\n\nThe Field and Staff, Batteries D, E, F, Supply Co. and Sanitary Detachment arrived Clermont-Ferrand at 7 o'clock A.M. April 9th, detrained and marched to Gribeauval Barracks (French) and were assigned quarters. The balance of the Regiment arrived Clermont-Ferrand at 7:30 P.M. April 11th and proceeded to Gribeauval Barracks and were assigned quarters.\n\nOn April 12th, 20 Officers were detached and sent to Tractor School at Vincennes, France. On the same date 40 enlisted men were detached and sent to Tremblay for course of instruction.\n\nOn April 13th, 31 commissioned officers were attached to the Regiment for duty. most of the officers were junior Lieutenants and were recent graduates of various schools in England and France.\n\nOn April 14th, 31 officers were detached from the Regiment and directed to proceed to Mailly-le-Camp to attend the Army Heavy Artillery School established at that place. On April 14th the First Battalion moved from Clermont-Ferrand to Le Cendres and went into billets at that place.\n\nOn April 19th, 20 additional officers were assigned to the regiment for duty.\n\nOn April 21st, 42 enlisted men of the Regiment transferred to the 57th Field Artillery Brigade and 43 enlisted men were transferred from the 57th Field Artillery Brigade to the Regiment.\n\nOn April 30th, 8 officers of the Regiment returned from the Army Heavy Artillery School at Mailly-le-Camp.\n\nOn April 29th, the Second Battalion moved from Clermont-Ferrand to Lempdes and went into billets at that place.\n\nOn May 4th the Regimental Headquarters, Supply Co. and Third Battalion moved from Clermont-Ferrand to Cournon and went into billets at that place.\n\nOn May 9th, 79 enlisted men were detached and sent to Boulogne-sur-Seine for instruction.\n\nOn May 10th, 45 replacement troops joined the Regiment for duty.\n\nOn May 17th, 34 enlisted men were sent to O&T Center No. 3, Clermont-Ferrand to take a course of instruction.\n\nOn May 20th, 20 Officers reported from Tractor Artillery School, Vincennes. On this same date 108 men were sent to O&T Center No. 3, Clermont-Ferrand to take a course of instruction.\n\nOn May 22nd, one Officer and two non-commissioned officers from the 146th Field Artillery Reg. were assigned as instructors at each of the billets occupied by this Regiment. On this same date 114 men were sent to O&T Center No. 3, Clermont-Ferrand for instruction. Also 15 Officers sent to take a special course.\n\nOn May 23rd, 4 Officers were detached and sent to take a course for Aerial Observers.\n\nOn May 25th, 70 enlisted men were sent to O&T Center No. 3, Clermont-Ferrand for Special Duty at the School.\n\nOn May 30th the Regiment participated in a Brigade Field Meet at Aulnat, France.\n\nOn June 11th, 72 enlisted men were returned to the regiment from the Tractor School at Boulogne-sur-Seine.\n\nOn June 13th Private John Schraeder a member of Battery A died of fever at Base Hospital No. 30, Royat, France.\n\nOn June 15th, 24 men were sent to O&T Center No. 3, Clermont-Ferrand for instruction. Also 24 men to O&T Center School at Le Cendre, (near Clermont-Ferrand).\n\nOn June 17th, 4 Privates (Medical) attached to Regiment.\n\nOn June 20th, 4 Officers were relieved from duty with the Regiment.\n\nOn June 21st, 15 enlisted men transferred from the Regiment to the 54th Artillery (Replacement).\n\nOn June 24, 10 men transferred to the 55th Artillery C.A.C.\n\nOn June 26th, 4 men were transferred to the 54th Artillery (Replacement) for the purpose of attending the Army Candidate School.\n\nDuring the remaining days of June 1918 and the first part of July the Officers and men who had previously detached to attend schools at various places in France were returned to the Regiment and intensive training was taken up in all billets preparatory to the Regiments leaving for action at the front.\n\nDuring the month of July 1918, 3 Officers were transferred out or the regiment, 15 enlisted men were transferred to the regiment and 49 transferred out.\n\nThis post card has Cpl. Edington's handwriting on it. It says \"56th C.A.C. Loaded here leaving for front. July 3rd 1918.\" The date seems to be wrong as the Regiment did not leave for the front until 31st July 1918. It is possible that Cpl. Edington wrote this on the card sometime after and didn't recall the correct date. Or another explanation could be that this was the date they headed for the target range. The post card is the rail yard at Clermont-Ferrand, France. At this place was O&T Center No. 3 APO 723. This is where the firing range was that the 56th Regiment trained at before moving up to the front.\n\nTarget Practice\n\nDuring the month of July each Battalion of the Regiment spent 10 days at the target range located at Randanne, Puy-de-Dome. The work at the range consisted of emplacing and camouflaging the 155mm. guns, firing various problems with both 75mm. guns and 155mm. guns. The Battalions of the Regiment were sent to the range in accordance with a standard of proficiency determined by the Artillery Instructors at the O&T Center No. 3, Clermont-Ferrand. The 3rd Battalion was first at the range then the 1st Battalion and then the 2nd Battalion. The work done by all Battalions at the range was considered by the Inspectors to be well done and the Regiment was declared sufficiently well trained for service at the front.\n\nSERVICE IN THE ZONE OF THE ARMIES\n\nDuring the months of June and July 1918, the Regiment received the material it was to use at the front. This material consisted principally of 24 French G.P.F. 155 mm. Guns, 24 seventy five horsepower Holt Tractors, ammunition and cargo body trucks, gas defense equipment and necessary Signal Corps and Engineer equipment. Notwithstanding the fact that every effort was made to complete the full equipment there still existed a considerable shortage especially of motor transportation when during the latter part of July orders were received for the Regiment to entrain for service in the Zone of Advance.\n\nOn July 13th the Guns and Motor transportation the Regiment was sent from the Various billets to Clermont-Ferrand railroad yards.\n\nOn July 31st all material was loaded on cars and the personnel entrained. Three trains were necessary to accommodate the Regiment, each train consisted of about 50 cars. The Commissioned personnel traveled in first-class coaches and the enlisted personnel in wooden box cars. The box cars accommodating from 30 to 40 men each.\n\nThe trains carrying the Regiment and material arrived at La Fort-sous-Jouarre during the night of August 1-2. As the trains arrived the personnel detrained and the material was unloaded. Billets for the personnel was previously arranged for at Charly (on the Marne River). As soon as the trains were unloaded personnel and materiel was moved to the billets.\n\nThe entire Regiment remained at Charly until August 5th on which day the 1st Battalion under command of Colonel James L. Long were ordered to go into position for action against the enemy. During the period the Regiment was together at Charly the Motor Transportation was increased to a considerable extent so that by the time the Regiment moved a sufficient number of motor trucks were available to handle all materiel and personnel although it was necessary to double up at times, this being done by one Battalion making a forward movement and then loaning its motor equipment to the next Battalion.\n\nNOTE: Inasmuch as the movements of the various Battalions of the Regiment were separate after August 5th, 1918 the Record of Events will be noted separately for each Battalion up to the time the Battalions were brought together after the signing of the Armistice, by the German Nation, on November 11th, 1918.\n\nREGIMENTAL SECTION: AUG. - NOV. 1918\n\n1 August, 1918: Regimental Section arrived at La Ferte-sous-Jouarre from Clermont-Ferrand at 9:00 P.M.\n\n2 August: Moved from La Ferte to Charteve.\n\n3 August: Moved from Charteve to Charly-sur-Marne and established Regimental Headquarters.\n\n4 August - 14 August: Routine duties performed.
