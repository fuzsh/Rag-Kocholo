        "text": "BRIEFHISTORIES OF COMBAT DIVISIONS\n\nTHE1ST DIVISION1, 2\n\n(Regular Army.Â Insignia:A crimson figure 1 on a khaki shield)\n\nThe 1st Division was organized inJune, 1917, from troops of the Regular Army which, at that time, were muchscattered, most of them being in service on the Mexican border. All wereat peace strength and were raised to war strength by transfers from otherunits. The division was not concentrated until arrival in France. The organizationwas as follows:\n\n1st Infantry Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 16th and18th Infantry; 2d Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n2d Infantry Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 26th and28th Infantry; 3d Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n1st Field Artillery Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 6th and7th (light), 5th (heavy) Field Artillery; 1st Trench Mortar Battery.\n\n1st Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n1st Engineers.\n\n2d Field Signal Battalion.\n\nTrains:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 1st SanitaryTrain (Field Hospitals Nos. 2, 3, 12, 13, and Ambulance Companies Nos.2, 3, 12, 13).\n\n974\n\nThe first troops sailed from Hobokenon June 13, 1917, and disembarked at St. Nazaire on June 26, 1917. Divisionheadquarters landed on June 27, 1917. The remainder of the troops followedin rapid succession, except the supply train, which did not arrive in Franceuntil May 6, 1918. The division (less Artillery) was sent to the Gondrecourtarea for training. For a similar purpose the Artillery brigade went toValdahon. En route from St. Nazaire to Gondrecourt, the 2d Battalion, 16thInfantry, participated in the Fourth of July parade in Paris, the firstpublic appearance of American troops in France.\n\nField Hospital No. 13 and AmbulanceCompany No. 13 arrived at St. Nazaire, with the division, on June 27, 1917.Headquarters field hospitals, headquarters ambulance sections, Field HospitalsNo. 2 and No. 12, and Ambulance Companies No. 2 and No. 12 arrived September26, 1917. Field Hospital No. 3 and Ambulance Company No. 3 arrived December29, 1917. While the division remained in the vicinity of St. Nazaire, allsick were cared for by a French military hospital, in that city. Latera part of this hospital was turned over to us and staffed by American medicalofficers, nurses, and enlisted men from Base Hospital No. 18 (Johns Hopkins),which had arrived in the same convoy with the 1st Division. On July 11,1917, Field Hospital No. 13 and Ambulance Company No. 13 (the only sanitarytrain units in France at that time) proceeded under their own transportationto the training area around Gondrecourt, arriving there July 15, 1917.The field hospital established a hospital in frame barracks at Gondrecourt,which was expanded by additional equipment, and designated Camp HospitalNo. 1. It provided permanent care for all sick, there being no hospital,except a small French one, to which it could evacuate. When, later (inSeptember, 1917), Base Hospital No. 18 was established at Bazoilles, CampHospital No. 1 evacuated all its serious sick and operative cases to thathospital. Field Hospital No. 13 was relieved by Field Hospital No. 12 onOctober 21. On November 7, Field Hospital No. 12 was relieved and a permanentpersonnel was assigned to Camp Hospital No. 1. On January 25, 1918, FieldHospital No. 3 took over the camp hospital and operated it until April3, 1918, when it was taken over by the Services of Supply. The trainingarea, consisting of 32 towns, was evacuated in turn by Ambulance CompanyNo. 13, stationed at La Neuville, and by Ambulance Company No. 12. stationedat Hevilliers; their evacuation included that to the base hospital. Theremainder of the sanitary train was located at Villiers le Sec, Hevilliers,and La Neuville.\n\nLuneville Sector, October 21, 1917,to November 20, 1917.\n\nOn the night of November 29, thedivision was withdrawn from the line to the Gondrecourt area, where itcontinued its training until January 15, 1918.\n\nAnsauville Sector, January 15 toApril 3, 1918.\n\nCantigny Sector, April 25 to June8, 1918.\n\nMontdidier-Noyon operation, June9-13, 1918.\n\nCantigny Sector, June 14 to July7, 1918.\n\nAisne-Marne operation, July 18-23,1918.\n\nThe division, after its relief fromthe Soissons operation, was again moved eastward. On August 7, 1918, ittook over the quiet Saizerais sector, near Toul. Here it remained untilAugust 24, when it was withdrawn to Vaucouleurs, in preparation for a newoffensive. When the division moved into the Saizerais sector, on August7, 1918, the sanitary train was disposed of as follows:\n\nField Hospital No. 2 was stationedat Avrainville for contagious and venereal diseases. Field Hospital No.3, at Griscourt, functioned as triage. Field Hospital No. 12, at Roziers-en-Haye,was for surgical cases. Field Hospital No. 13, at Rogeville, took careof sick and skin diseases.\n\nA dressing station was establishedby Ambulance Company No. 12 at Jezainville; United States Army AmbulanceService Section 649, assigned to the division, took station at Pont-a-Moussonand evacuated wounded from the front to the dressing station. Divisionalambulance companies evacuated from the dressing station to the triage andhospitals\n\n975\n\nat Toul. During its stay in thissector, intensive efforts were made to free the division from lice andto overhaul all motor equipment. Field Hospital No. 2, heretofore animaldrawn; was motorized, thus rendering all these units equally mobile. Whenthe division moved to the vicinity ofÂ Vaucouleurs, most of the sanitarytrain was located at Pierrot. Field Hospital No. 12 was established atBurey-en-Vaux for the sick and Field Hospital No. 13, at Sauvigny, forskin and venereal diseases. All seriously sick were evacuated to Base HospitalNo. 66 at Neufchateau.\n\nHere the division engaged in maneuvers,simulating those it expected to employ in the coming St. Mihiel operation.Field hospitals and dressing stations were actually established and movedin conformity with the general problem worked out by the division.\n\nAmbulance company equipment was increasedby the addition of large quantities of dressings, litters, splints, andblankets, each ambulance now carrying 12 blankets, 6 to 8 litters, anda supply of leg and arm splints. Arrangements were made for replacing suppliesunloaded with patients. Dressing-station supplies were supplemented bysuch additional articles as antigas suits and gloves, sodium bicarbonate(for mustard gas), hot water bottles, shell-wound dressings in three sizes,issued to litter-bearer detachments, and additional tourniquets, furnishedto stations and bearers.\n\nThe Medical Department belt for enlistedmen was abandoned at this time and small pouches were issued in their stead.The former would not hold the larger dressings now required, nor did itpermit the wearer to carry a litter. Each field hospital now carried 70litters and 500 or more blankets.\n\nAfter training and reequipment the1st Division moved to the St. Mihiel salient, and the entire sanitary trainwas assembled at Raulecourt.\n\nSt. Mihiel operation, September 12-13,1918.\n\nMeusse-Argonne operation, September26 to November 11, 1918.\n\nArmy of Occupation.\n\nDivision headquarters embarked atBrest on August 25, 1919, and arrived at New York, September 5, 1919.\n\nDIVISION SURGEONS\n\nCol.

Insignia: A reddiamond)\n\nThe 5th Division was organized atCamp Logan, Tex., December 1, 1917, from units of the Regular Army. Thesebeing at peace strength, the shortage was made up by assignment of NationalArmy men.\n\nThe following organizations composedthe division:\n\n9th Infantry Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 60th and61st Infantry; 14th Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n10th Infantry Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 6th and11th Infantry; 15th Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n13th Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n5th Artillery Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 19th and20th (light), 21st (heavy) Field Artillery; 5th Trench Mortar Battery.\n\n7th Engineers.\n\n9th Field Signal Battalion.\n\nTrains (5th Sanitary Train, FieldHospitals Nos. 17, 25, 29, 30, and Ambulance Companies Nos. 17, 25, 29,30).\n\nThe first unit of the division arrivedin France March 20, 1918, the last June 19, Bar-sur-Aube was selected asthe training area for the infantry, while the artillery was sent to Valdahonfor a similar purpose.\n\nOn June 1 the division was placedat the disposal of the French Thirty-third Army Corps, then operating inthe Vosges. To this sector it was immediately moved. Here the troops weremingled with the French behind the lines for further training. June 14the division entered the line with combat units, half French. The sectorwas quiet, but the division suffered its first casualties June 14.\n\nOn July 15 the division was transferredto the quiet St. Die sector, and on July 19 the command of this sectorpassed to the Americans. The artillery joined the division July 28, afterhaving completed its training at Valdahon. In a local engagement of August17 the town of Frapelle and Hill 451 were taken and held against counterattacks.\n\nThe division was relieved by theFrench August 26, and repaired to Arches, south of Epinal, for rest andtraining. From this point it moved to the vicinity of Luneville, August28.\n\nThe 5th Sanitary Train did not arriveuntil June 20; but due to the urgent need of medical personnel and transportation,Field Hospital No. 161 and Ambulance Company No. 161, 41st (Depot) Division,were assigned to the 5th Division on May 11, 1918. These units opened CampHospital No. 42, at Bar-sur-Aube, for division sick. When the divisionmoved to the Anould sector, in the Vosges, on June 2, 1918, Field HospitalNo. 141 and Ambulance Company No. 141 were ordered to duty with FrenchEvacuation Hospital 2/29 at Fraize. On June 8 Field Hospital No. 163 andAmbulance Company No. 162, of the 41st Division, reported for duty. Thefield hospital was assigned to French Evacuation Hospital 2/8 at Gerardmerand the ambulance company performed evacuation. These organizations wererelieved from duty with the 5th Division during the latter part of Julyand early part of August.\n\nService in the Anould sector wasof peculiar interest because of the character of the terrain and the closeassociation with the French. The country was rugged, with but few roadsleading through the mountain passes. Though steep, these roads were good,and at certain points narrow-gauge railways were sometimes available forthe evacuations of wounded. As allied trenches were usually on the easternslope of the hills, roads leading to them were under direct enemy observationand frequently were shelled, especially during a raid from either side.These circumstances prohibited the near approach of ambulances to the advancestations and required that the wounded be removed from them by hand carriageor wheeled litter for a distance of from 3 to 5 km. (1.8 to 3.1 miles)over steep\n\n981\n\nand winding trails. From one advancestation it was necessary that eight bearers carry a wounded man for fourhours before he could be placed on a vehicle. First aid was applied atbattalion stations located in front-line trenches, and the patients werethen taken by handcarriage or on wheeled litters through communicatingtrenches or over trails to the nearest point accessible by motor-cyclelitter or ambulance. Ambulance centers were maintained near the hospitals,from 5 to 8 km. (3 to 4.9 miles) from the front. Here approximately two-thirdsof the ambulances were parked, the others being posted at protected andaccessible points as near the lines as possible. When casualties occurred,notice was telephoned to the hospitals and an ambulance was sent forwardto the post which had been vacated by the ambulance sent to collect thecasualties in question. Thus there was kept up a circuit of vehicles andprompt service, compensating for inability to maintain a number of ambulancesat a forward post because of enemy airplane observation and direct fire.Animal-drawn transportation was not used in the American service in thissector. The use of wheeled litters and motor cycles for removal of thewounded in this rugged terrain is discussed in Chapter IV.\n\nSmall hospitals--practically postsfor rest and emergency treatment--were installed at protected points, andhere patients were retained until roads were passable or until, if seriouslywounded, they had recuperated sufficiently to continue the journey. Regimentalhospitals, where the less seriously sick and the slightly wounded werekept, were located at the base of the mountains. Back of these were theFrench evacuation hospitals where, under French command and instruction,our sanitary train personnel received training and rendered service. Theseunits were the following: Fraize, French Evacuation Hospital, 2/28, 7 km.(4.2 miles) from the front, frequently shelled and later evacuated; Gerardmer,French Evacuation Hospital 2/8, 15 km. (9 miles) from the front by road.Well situated in a large hotel; St. Die. HÃ´pital St. Charles, wellequipped and located in the city hospital building, 7 km. (4.2 miles) fromthe front and too near to be used in time of activity; Bruyeres, FrenchEvacuation Hospital 2/14, 25 km. (15 miles) from the front and thereforetoo distant for emergency work, though well equipped; Le Rudlin, AlpinAmbulance No. 305. Though frequently shelled, this unit was used for theimmediate treatment of serious cases.\n\nAll these sanitary formations, inrear of the battalion aid stations--and even these if necessary--receivedFrench and American disabled alike.\n\nFrom July 15 the division occupiedthe front east of St. Die, in the Vosges. Here, on August 17, about 2,500men, including Companies L, M, and C of the 6th Infantry, with troops fromother organizations, carried out a local attack which resulted in the captureof Frapelle and Hill 451. Resulting casualties numbered 418, but most ofthose due to gas occurred among troops in dugouts in the vicinity of theattacking troops.\n\nThe system of evacuation in the St.Die sector was similar to that described above. Ambulance centers werelocated at St. Die and Raon l'Etape, where in times of stress the vehiclesavailable were augmented by ambulances from Evacuation Hospital No. 2.Evacuations were made to Field Hospital No. 29 and to St. Charles Hospital(French), at St. Die, to Field Hospital No. 17 and HÃ´pital Mixte(French), at Raon-l'Etape, and for nontransportables to Evacuation HospitalNo. 2, Baccarat, and to Field Hospital No. 25 with French Evacuation Hospital2/14 (French), at Bruyeres. From the southern front of the sector disabledmen passed through the hospitals at St. Die, where Field Hospital No. 29received the sick and the gassed and HÃ´pital St. Charles operated;the seriously sick from the entire sector were sent to Bruyeres. Casualtiesfrom the northern part of the line were sent to Field Hospital No. 17,which transferred seriously wounded patients to the HÃ´pital Mixte,at Raon-l'Etape. All other battle casualties, including gassed, were sentto Evacuation Hospital No. 2, at Baccarat. At each of the French hospitalsFrench and American teams alternated in service.\n\nDuring the Frapelle attack the regimentalaid station of the 6th Infantry was located at Dijon, with aid stationsat Nayemont, Chapelle Ste. Claire, Charmont, and Neuvillers. Seven medicalofficers and seventy-four enlisted men from the sanitary train were attachedto the 6th Infantry to reinforce its medical personnel. Six ambulances,with litter squads\n\n982\n\nfrom Ambulance Companies No. 25 andNo. 29, were posted at the stations mentioned above, and the remainderwere held at the \"alert\" at St. Die, where Field Hospital No. 29 operatedthe triage.\n\nNo arrangements had been made atthis time for details of litter bearers from the line, and use of bandsmenproved unsatisfactory. As regimental personnel was fully engaged in renderingfirst aid, it was decided that it should not be employed for bearer service,yet during a general engagement the details to the regimental service,from ambulance companies which were already fully occupied, proved inadequate.\n\nOf the 261 gas casualties in theFrapelle attack, more than 50 percent were so slightly affected that theirremoval to the rear was not necessary. The number mentioned included thosesuffering from gas fright, and also malingerers.\n\nAn information service was initiatedat this time, which was utilized and developed in subsequent engagements.It is described as follows in the medical history of the 5th Division:\n\nInformation was furnished to thedivision staff every hour during times of activity, and less frequently--dependingupon the character of action--as to the number and nature of casualtiesand the location from which they came. Such information was of value inconfirming reports received from other sources and in forming an estimateof the relative gravity of the militaryÂ situation at various pointson the line, as well as the kind of shells and other means of warfare usedby the enemy.\n\nInformation was required from regimentalsurgeons and others. Reports were sent to the division surgeon of the progressof the attack, the number and kind of casualties, the number of cases receivedat the hospitals, the need for supplies and anticipated casualties.\n\nThis information enabled the divisionsurgeon in some instances to anticipate the needs of sanitary units atthe front. Knowledge that gas shells were being used in quantity was anindication for obtaining a supply of blankets and additional uniforms.Before the request for these articles was received at headquarters thesupplies were on their way to the front. Information regarding actual andanticipated casualties enabled officers at the triage and at other hospitalsto plan work and distribute patients so that each case could receive attentionat the earliest possible moment. * * *\n\nNegative information was often ofgreat value. Report that activity had subsided and that few or no caseswere to be expected for a time was helpful in relieving the nervous strainof the hospital personnel and allowing at least a part of them to obtainmuch-needed rest. It was found of value not only for the hospitals butalso for ambulance company troops.\n\nReports received from medical sourceswere of value to the operations section, G-3. These included statementsconcerning the character of wounds and injuries, estimates of number ofwounded on the field, the presence of gas in certain areas, and generalphysical resistance of the men.\n\nInformation received through headquartersand transmitted to medical officers with the line included (a) prior tothe engagement, plans for the action, routes for evacuation, number ofambulances available, and other preparations; (b) information relatingto development in the military situation which required preparations onthe part of the medical officers.\n\nPrior to the engagement there wasa conference of the medical officers of line troops, the commanding officersof ambulance and field hospital companies, and others concerned. A thoroughreconnaissance was made of the terrain not then occupied by the enemy.Locations for ambulance stations were selected and plans made from studyof maps for location of stations in the occupied area as soon as an advancewas made. It is interesting to note that these plans were executed withpractically no variation either as to location or as to time.\n\nSt. Mihiel operation, September 12-16.\n\nFrom September 17-27 the division,minus the artillery, was stationed at Domevre-en-Haye, near Toul, for restand training. The artillery remained in the St. Mihiel sector until afterthe signing of the armistice, and formed a part of the Second Army. OnSeptember 27-28 the division moved to Pagny-sur-Meuse, west of Toul, andthere resumed training.\n\nMeuse-Argonne operation, October5 to November 11, 1918.\n\nArmy of Occupation.\n\nThe division was relieved, May 10,1919, for return to this country, but its departure was delayed until July.Headquarters sailed from Brest July 13 and arrived at New York July 21.\n\n983\n\nDIVISION SURGEONS3\n\nCol.

Insignia: A six-pointedred star)\n\nThe 6th Division was organized atCamp McClellan, Ala., in November, 1917, from units of the Regular Army.These being at peace strength, the shortages were made up by assignmentof National Army men. Especially was this true of the 318th Engineers.Which was composed almost exclusively of the latter. The following organizationscomposed the division:\n\n11th Infantry Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 51st and52d Infantry; 17th Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n12th Infantry Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 53d and54th Infantry; 18th Machine Gun Battalion. 16th Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n6th Field Artillery Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 3d and78th (light), 11th (heavy), Field Artillery; 6th Trench Mortar Battery.\n\n318th Engineers:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 6th FieldSignal Battalion.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Trains(6th Sanitary Train; Field Hospitals Nos. 20, 37, 38, 40, and AmbulanceCompanies Nos. 20, 37, 38, 40).\n\nThe first unit of the division arrivedin France July 10; the last July 26, 1918. Many units landed first in Englandand Scotland and then crossed the Channel. While at Le Havre the artillerycame under fire from an enemy airplane and suffered the first casualtiesinflicted upon the division.\n\nAfter training in the vicinity ofChateauvillain, the division, minus the artillery, departed August 27 forGerardmer, in the Vosges, which sector it occupied, under French command,until relieved October 11. During this period the sector was quiet, althoughenlivened with frequent raids and patrol combats. The divisional artilleryat this time was in training at Valdahon.\n\nThe sanitary train arrived in FranceJuly 22, 1918, and was sent to the training area of the division. Trainingwas immediately taken up under a training schedule issued by General Headquarters.Instruction was very intensive, but was carried out under considerabledifficulties due to lack of manuals and necessary equipment. Units werescattered over a wide area, and it was very difficult to collect the personnelof the various units, excepting that in the sanitary train, for collectiveinstruction. The sanitary train had no transportation. It received four-muleambulances shortly prior to departure from this area, but these could notbe taken along owing to lack of animals. Evacuation service was performedby Camp Hospital No. 9, and the divisional specialists were also assignedto this hospital for duty. While in this training area the health of thecommand was exceptionally good, with the exception of the occurrence ofdiarrhea.\n\nWhen the division moved to the Gerardmersector, August 17, the sanitary train functioned for the first time, takingover the hospitals from the 35th Division; sites of two of these were changedalmost immediately after arrival. These hospitals were located as follows:Field Hospital No. 20 was at Gerardmer, functioning as a surgical and ageneral medical hospital, the surgical portion being in Hotel de Lac inconjunction with a French hospital, and the general medical in MaternelleHospital. Field Hospital No. 37 was located at Storkensohn, working inconnection with a French hospital. This hospital was in Bessonneau tents,and functioned as a surgical hospital for the southern\n\n984\n\nportion of the sector. Field HospitalNo. 38 was located in Kruth, in buildings formerly occupied by a Frenchhospital, the buildings having been turned over to it by a factory. Thishospital functioned as a general medical and gas hospital. Field HospitalNo. 40 was located at the same place in temporary wooden buildings andfunctioned as a skin, contagious disease, and venereal hospital. Thesehospitals acted as evacuation hospitals also, there being no evacuationhospital in the area. Evacuations were made to Base Hospital No. 23, atVittel, about 61 km. (36.6 miles) distant.\n\nA surgical team was assigned to thedivision, September 11, 1918, and functioned with Field Hospital No. 37,at Storkensohn. X-ray outfits of the French were used at both surgicalhospitals. The mobile laboratory was assigned to work with Field HospitalNo. 38, and the divisional specialists were attached to the sanitary trainand visited all the division hospitals.\n\nEvacuations in a sector of this characterwere carried on under many difficulties. All forms of transport were usedover the mountainous terrain, and included Sunbeam motorcycles, with sidelitters, mule litters, mule ambulances, G. M. C. ambulances, and Ford ambulances.Hand carry was in some places long and tedious, and in several localitiesas many as three or four relays had to be provided, necessitating sometimes16 men to transport one wounded man before he could be placed on mechanicaltransport. As the division had no ambulances regularly assigned to it,these were provided by attaching United States Army Ambulance Service SectionNo. 524 and Ambulance Company No. 162, giving a total of 32 ambulances.These ambulances were distributed pursuant to a scheme of distributionmade by the director of ambulance companies. There was considerable difficultyin the use of ambulances in this particular type of terrain, owing to theburning out of brake linings of both the Ford and the G. M. C.\n\nThe supply service, though also workingunder difficulties owing to lack of transportation, was, nevertheless,very efficient, medical department supplies being distributed through thedressing stations to the front-line organizations. The medical supply depotwas located at Gerardmer, with a branch depot at Kruth. The American RedCross rendered very valuable services, procuring and distributing theirown supplies. They established five advance comfort stations where theysupplied hot chocolate and doughnuts to the troops on the march. The AmericanRed Cross supply depot was located at the railhead at Cornimont.\n\nThe Meuse-Argonne operation beingunder way, the division, on October 27, was sent north to take its placein the line. Detraining near St. Menehould, south of the Argonne, a longand trying march due north was begun. Lack of transportation facilitiesforced the troops to drag their machine guns and other equipment by handthrough the forest and over roads which a retreating enemy had used everymeans at his command to make impassable. After a march of approximately50 km. (31 miles), divisional headquarters was established, November 6,at Stonne. At this time the division was a unit of the First Corps andin reserve.\n\nOn November 6, the left of the FirstCorps rested in the vicinity of Stonne. They began the turning movementeastward to the Meuse. As the left flank of the corps swung to the northeast,liaison with the French on the left was temporarily lost. Into this gapunits of the 6th Division were hurried, and what promised to be a dangeroussituation was thus saved.\n\nThe enemy at this time was in fullretreat; and the necessity for its services no longer existing, the 5thDivision was moved to the area northeast of Verdun. Before it could enterthe line in this sector the signing of the armistice ended the fighting.The 11th Field Artillery went into action with the 89th Division duringthe Meuse-Argonne operation.\n\nForty days were spent by the divisionin quiet sectors and none in active ones. Twelve prisoners were capturedand casualties totaling 576 were suffered. When the division arrived inthe Meuse-Argonne region, the sanitary train took station near Froidos.Due to shortage of ambulances in the corps, United States Army AmbulanceService Section No. 524 was detached from the division, leaving it only12 G. M. C. ambulances.\n\n985\n\nEight were assigned to the divisionorganizations which evacuated their own patients to evacuation hospitalsin the vicinity. The sanitary train was without other transportation withthe exception of six mule ambulances, without animals, and two motor trucksfor its own supplies.\n\nThe sanitary train, while the divisionwas in the Meuse-Argonne operation, was moved from its first camp, nearFroidos, to the site of a former German hospital about 2 km. (1.2 miles)north of Apremont, where it was immobilized until the division was withdrawn.One field hospital function, taking care of a number of sick of the 6thDivision and of sick from other divisions. One dressing station was established.This was at Stonne, the farthest point north reached by the 6th Division.Here a number of refugees and wounded from other divisions were cared for.\n\nDivision headquarters was establishedat Aignay-le-Duc, November 30, 1918. On April 12, 1918, movement of thedivision to Germany was begun. Division headquarters was at Bad Bertrichon April 30. On May 6 the movement of the division was stopped, about 60percent of the personnel having arrived in Germany. On May 20 movementto Brest was begun. Division headquarters embarked on June 3, 1919, andarrived at New York on June 10.\n\nDIVISION SURGEONS3\n\nCol. Paul L. Freeman, M. C., December28, 1917, to May 12, 1919.\n\nCol. James M. Phalen, M.

For a similar purpose the artillery brigade wassent to Camp Meucon (Morbihan). It never joined the division during operations.\n\nThe division, less artillery, departedon September 27 for the front, detraining in the vicinity of Toni. It becamereserve of the Fourth Corps, First Army. Headquarters was established successivelyat Gondreville, Villers-en-Haye, and Euvezin.\n\n986\n\nThe sanitary train arrived at Brest,France, August 25, 1918, and four days later proceeded to the trainingarea, arriving at Ancy-le-Franc September 1, 1918. The train arrived withoutany equipment, and as there were no hospital facilities in the area withthe exception of a 10-bed French hospital, seriously sick were shippedby train to Base Hospital No. 17, at Dijon. Those unable to stand transportationwere held at the overcrowded French hospital.\n\nOn September 20, 1918, Camp HospitalNo. 49 opened at Laignes and relieved the situation. Field Hospital No.22 assisted in the operation of this hospital while the division was inthis area.\n\nPuvenelle Sector, October 10 to November11, 1918.\n\nJanuary 10, 1919, the division movedto the region north of Toul, with headquarters at Saizerais (Meurthe etMoselle), one regiment (34th Infantry) remaining in the devastated areafor guard and police duty.\n\nIn April the division moved to theColombey-les-Belles area, and then to the Le Mans Embarkation Center preparatoryto returning to the United States.\n\nHeadquarters embarked on June 12,1919, and arrived in New York on June 20, 1919.\n\nDIVISION SURGEON3\n\nCol.

Insignia: Dark-bluemonogram YD on diamond-shaped field of olive drab)\n\nThe 26th Division was organized inAugust, 1917, at Boston, Mass., from National Guard troops of the New EnglandStates, supplemented by the small quota of National Army troops from CampDevens, Mass.\n\nThe organization was as follows:\n\n51st Infantry Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 101st and102d Infantry; 102d Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n52d Infantry Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 103d and104th Infantry; 103d Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n101st Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n51st Field Artillery Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 101st and102d (light), 103d (heavy) Field Artillery; 101st Trench Mortar Battery.\n\n101st Engineers.\n\n101st Field Signal Battalion.\n\nTrains (101st Sanitary Train: FieldHospitals Nos. 101, 102, 103, 104, and Ambulance Companies Nos. 101, 102,103, 104).\n\nThe first unit to go overseas arrivedat St. Nazaire, France, on September 20, 1917. The last element arrivedon November 12, 1917.\n\nThe division (less artillery, engineers,and signal battalion) remained in a training area with headquarters atNeufchateau until February, 1918. For purposes of training, the artillerywas sent to Coetquidan. It, as well as all other elements, rejoined thedivision early in February and remained with it during all activities inwhich it participated.\n\nThe division proceeded to the vicinityof Soissons on February 6, 1918, where attached to the French EleventhCorps, its units went into line in the Chemin des Dames sector on February10. It was withdrawn March 21, and moved to the La Reine and Boucq sectornorthwest of Toul, relieving the American 1st Division and the French 10thColonial Division in line on April 3. From April 10-13 the division successfullyrepelled an attack by the enemy on the Bois Brule subsector at Apremont.This was the first engagement in which American troops took part in anynumber. On April 20-21 the\n\n987\n\ndivision was involved in a defensiveoperation known as the \"Seicheprey raid.\" This was an enemy attack in forceagainst the defenses of the town of Seicheprey. Although American losseswere heavy, the enemy was repulsed, and all ground taken by him was recapturedby counterattack. Minor operations of both an offensive and a defensivecharacter kept this sector active during the remainder of the division'sstay therein.\n\nThe sanitary train arrived in Francein September and October, 1917, and was sent to the Neufchateau trainingarea. Here the sections of the sanitary train were located in widely separatedtowns, the ambulance section at Liffol-leGrand and the field hospital sectionat Bazoilles-sur-Meuse.\n\nField Hospital No. 101 assisted inthe construction of the hospital center at Bazoilles and Field HospitalNo. 104 opened at Neufchateau for division sick. On December 7, 1917, FieldHospital No. 101 established a hospital at Liffol-le-Grand for the sickand Field Hospital No. 104 cared for contagious diseases only. Field HospitalNo. 103 was sent to Dijon, where it assisted in the construction of BaseHospital No. 17. Field Hospital No. 102 was sent in detachments to theoperating division hospitals and to line organizations. In the last weekof January, 1918, preparations were made for a move, and the hospitalsbeing operated by the field hospitals were turned over to Base HospitalNo. 66, at Neufchateau. The field hospital personnel was assembled andreorganized. On arrival in the Chemin-des-Dames sector, the sanitary trainwas subdivided among French medical personnel. Though line troops receivedvaluable training here, the medical Department had no opportunity to trainsatisfactorily its units by actual experience in their field duties, andthe French cared for almost all casualties. It made observations, however,in gas treatment, in operation of the triage, and in other details of fieldservice. As our troops had no base hospitals in this region, the Frenchpermitted us to transfer patients to the American Ambulance (later AmericanRed Cross Hospital No. 1), at Paris.\n\nThe field hospitals functioned asfollows: Field Hospital No. 101 went to Bois Roger; No. 102 to AmbulanceSt. Paul at Soissons for seriously wounded; No. 103 operated in a chateauat Muret et Crouttes; No. 104 assisted in a French evacuation hospitalat Vasseny. Detachments were also sent to various other French hospitals,including contagious, gas, venereal, skin, and psychoneurotic hospitals.\n\nWhen the division entered the linesin the Toul sector, dressing stations were operated at Gironville and Liouville,on the left, and at Mandres-aux-Quatre-Tours and Bois de Rehanne, on theright. Ambulance companies were reinforced by United States Army AmbulanceService Section No. 647. Because of the long frontage of the Toul sector--18km. (10.8 miles)--two triages were established. That for the left of theline, operated by Field Hospital No. 104, was located successively at Aulnois-sous-Vertuzeyand at Abbaye Rongeval; while that on the right, operated by Field HospitalNo. 102, was located first at Menil-la-Tour and later, after June 2, ata point near Minorville.

This was effected by combining two ambulance companies andtwo field hospitals. One ambulance company and one field hospital thenconstituted a provisional field ambulance. The two units thus formed werenumbered 129 and 130, and both were equipped with British medical matÃ©riel.\n\nProvisional Field Ambulance No. 129went into training at Famehon, operating in conjunction with Field AmbulanceNo. 42 (British).

Field Hospitals No. 131 andNo. 132 rejoined the division on August 31, but the remaining two ambulancecompanies (No. 131 and No. 132) did not join until October, and United StatesArmy Ambulance Service Section No. 600 was assigned to the division toreplace them.\n\nThe sanitary train was located atMenil-sur-Sauix and Field Hospital No. 129 established a sick collectingpoint at Tronville. When the division moved to the Verdun sector, the sanitarytrain was disposed as follows: Field Hospital No. 131, at Glorieux, triage;Â Field Hospital No. 130, gas cases, at Souhesmes; Ambulance company No.129 established an advanced dressing station at La Claire. The remainderof the sanitary train took station at Sivry-la-Perche, where Field HospitalNo. 132 opened a divisional sick collecting station.\n\nFrom the field hospitals casualtieswere evacuated to Evacuation Hospitals No. 6 and No. 7, at Souilly.\n\nOn September 16 the sanitary trainmoved to Thierville and Glorieux and preparations were made for the comingoperation.\n\nMeuse-Argonne operation, September26 to October 23\n\nTroyon sector, October 26 to November11, 1918.\n\n995\n\nOn December 8, 1918 the divisioncommenced an advance which carried its leading brigades across the Moselleinto Rhenish Germany. During this movement it was attached to the armyof occupation, but upon the revocation of this disposition, on December15, it was withdrawn west of that river and established in the northernpart of Luxemburg, with headquarters located at Diekirch.

Insignia: SantaFe cross within two circles of varying colors, the outer one divided intofour arcs)\n\nThe 35th Division was organized atCamp Doniphan, Fort Sill, Okla., in September, 1917, from National Guardunits of Missouri and Kansas.\n\nThe organization was as follows:\n\n69th Infantry Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 137th and138th Infantry; 129th Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n70th Infantry Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 139th and140th Infantry; 130th Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n60th Field Artillery Brigade:\n\nÂ Â Â Â 128th,129th (light), 130th (heavy) Field Artillery; 110th Trench Mortar Battery.\n\n128th Machine Gun Battalion.\n\n110th Engineers.\n\n110th Field Signal Battalion.\n\nTrains (110th Sanitary Train: FieldHospitals Nos. 137, 138, 139, 140 and Ambulance Companies Nos. 137, 138,139, 140).\n\nThe first unit of the division arrivedin France May 11, 1918; the last, June 8, 1918.\n\nFor training purposes, the division(less artillery) was sent to the vicinity of Eu (Somme), where it remaineduntil June 8, 1918. It moved to the vicinity of Epinal on June 11, andon June 30 it moved to the Vosges, where it was brigaded with the Frenchin line in the Gerardmer sector. Command of the sector passed to the commandinggeneral, 35th Division, on July 27. The Artillery brigade trained at CampCoetquidan. It rejoined the division in the Vosges, August 14.\n\nOn August 31, the division was relievedby units of the American 6th Division, and French 131st Division, and proceededto the Foret de Haye, west of Nancy, for concentration preparatory to theSt. Mihiel operation, in which it was in the reserve of the First Army.\n\nOn September 15, the division wasplaced under the tactical control of the French Second Army, and movedto the Naives-devant-Bar area, with headquarters established at Passavant-en-Argonne,on September 18. On September 19, it moved to the Vraincourt--Auzevillearea, with headquarters at Autrecourt. On September 23, it relieved theFrench 73d Division, in the line in the Grange-la-Comte sector.\n\nThe sanitary train did not join thedivision until June 12. Practically no medical equipment had been broughtfrom the United States except the personal equipment of officers and enlistedmen. Battalions were supplied with British equipment and three Britishfield ambulances. Nos. 96, 97, and 98, were assigned to the division astraining units as well as to care for division casualties. When the divisionarrived in the vicinity, of Epinal, the sanitary train rejoined it andwas billeted at Eloyes. The train arrived with but little equipment, andno transportation was available for the first 36 hours.\n\n996\n\nTen large 3-ton trucks were assignedto the train, eight of which were used to collect and evacuate the sickand injured. Within a week after its arrival in this sector, 42 trucksand 12 motor ambulances were received.\n\nField Hospital No. 137 establishedin tents and buildings at Eloyes for sick and contagious cases.\n\nField Hospital No. 140 and AmbulanceCompany No. 140 were stationed at La Racine for the hospitalization andevacuation of the 69th Brigade and 110th Engineers. Field Hospital No.136 and Ambulance Company No. 136 were at Le Menu, to cover the 70th Brigadeand Machine Gun Battalion.\n\nField Hospital No. 139 and AmbulanceCompany No. 139 were held in reserve. Ambulance Company No. 137, with headquartersat Eloyes, operated as an evacuation ambulance company.\n\nWhen the division began to filterin with French troops in the Vosges, Field Hospital No. 139 took over asection of a French hospital at Bussang and Ambulance Company No. 140 establishedin part at Ranspach. On June 20, United States Army Ambulance Section No.606 reported for duty with the sanitary train and was assigned to Ranspachfor evacuation from battalions in the line to the field hospital at Bussang.\n\nOn June 28 Field Hospital No. 138relieved No. 139 at Bussang, the latter moving to Ninth, where it operateda hospital for contagious diseases. A section of Field Hospital No. 137established a hospital for surgical and gas cases at Storkensohn. FieldHospital No. 140 operated at Urbes for medical and venereal cases. Themedical supply depot was also at the latter place. A section of Field HospitalNo. 137 remained at Eloyes to care for seriously sick at that point.\n\nAmbulance Company No. 138 moved upto Bussang, and the remainder of the ambulance companies established theirheadquarters at Ranspach.\n\nMotor ambulance stations were establishedat Larchey, Dreh, Kruth, Haag, Wagram, and Moosch. Ambulance Company No.140 operated its animal-drawn ambulances from Thann and Mittlach. The dressingsections of Ambulance Companies No. 139 and No. 140 were operating in connectionwith Alpine ambulances at Larchey and Wagram. Dressing station sectionswere also operating at Haag and Wagram. On July 1 the section of FieldHospital No. 137, operating at Eloyes, was closed and consolidated at Storkensohn.Sections from Ambulance Companies Nos. 137, 139, and 140 also occupiedparts of the Alpine ambulances at Mittlach, Larchey, and Nonette. Thesethree principal dressing stations served the front line and were the farthestpoints to which ambulances could be sent. From the battalion aid stationsto these dressing stations it was necessary to transport the patients byhand, pack mule, or wheeled litter.\n\nThe Alpine ambulances were permanentsector installations, with a small personnel from the French medical department.They were absolutely shell-proof and were practically entirely underground;each was equipped for the treatment of the gassed and had its wards, operatingrooms, etc., as well as quarters for the personnel.\n\nOn July 20 the dressing station atNonette was given up. Ambulance Company No. 137 established a dressingstation at Ventron. At this time Ambulance Company No. 139 operated thestation at Mittlach and Ambulance Company No. 138 at Larchey. The transportsection of the latter operated as an evacuation ambulance company.\n\nUnited States Army Ambulance ServiceSection No. 606 was relieved from duty with the division and a part ofsection No. 642 was assigned.\n\nOn August 10 units of the sanitarytrain were located as follows: Field Hospital No. 137, operating in threesections, at Storkensohn, with Surgical Unit No. 13, for surgical cases,at Kruth for surgical and gassed cases, and at Dreh for gas and nontransportablewounded.\n\nField Hospital No. 138, at Bussang,functioned as an evacuation hospital; No. 139, at Le Menil, for contagious;No. 140, at Ventron, for medical, venereal, and skin cases. Ambulance CompanyNo. 137 operated dressing stations at Larchey and performed evacuation in that sector. Ambulance Company No. 138, at Bussang, evacuated to basehospitals. Ambulance Company No. 139, at Ventron, evacuated the reservearea. Ambulance Company No. 140 operated a dressing station at Mittlach,evacuating that sector.\n\n997\n\nThe problem of evacuation of thewounded from the front in the mountains back to the field hospitals presentedat all times almost every imaginable difficulty. The character of the terrainrendered any plan of uniform evacuation impossible. On account of the differencein the lateral elevation of most of the trenches, it was necessary foreach of the battalions to establish from two to four aid stations, and,in addition, there were always one or two Medical Department men operatinga small aid station with each company in line.\n\nFrom the front-line trenches it wasalways necessary to carry the wounded back by hand; in most instances noteven a litter could be used, the men being transported on the backs ofthe litter bearers. Litter bearers ordinarily worked in squads of four,the litter being carried on the shoulders of the four men. Occasionallyit was possible to use a wheel litter, where the paths were not too roughand not too steep.\n\nFrom battalion aid stations to thedressing station it was occasionally possible to send up narrow double-deckedFrench litter ambulances carrying two patients recumbent. This ambulance,however, was unsatisfactory because of its weight and unwieldiness, andalso because on the steep paths it always required two mules. The packcarrier, or cacolet, was tried out, but was soon abandoned because of thepain that transportation by it gave the wounded man. In spite of all thedifficulties and the long distances, no patient was ever received at thesurgical hospital later than 12 hours after his injury.\n\nWhen, on August 31, the divisionwas relieved in the Gerardmer sector, the relief of the Medical Departmentwas carried out in conformity with the following orders:\n\nD.S. 35TH DIVISION,\n\nAugust 31st, 1918.\n\nSecret.\n\nFIELD MEDICAL ORDERNo. 8\n\n1.Â In compliance with orders,headquarters, 35th Division and 33d French Corps, the sanitary units ofthe 6th Division will relieve the sanitary units of the 35th Division.This relief will be completed before midnight of September 1, 1918.
