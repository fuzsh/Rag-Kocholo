        "text": "The first day of the Battle of the Somme was the worst day in the history of the British Army.\n\nAt 7:30am on July 1, 1916, thousands of British soldiers began an attack against a German trench line which was supposed to have been destroyed. It wasn't. Over the next 12 hours 29,000 people were killed and many more wounded. Many of those who survived were changed forever – as was the world, and Britain's understanding of itself.\n\nScroll down and read upwards to follow the events of that momentous day, minute by minute and hour by hour, just as they happened 100 years ago.\n\nSources\n\nIn assembling this account I am deeply indebted to the scholarship of the following:\n\nRobert Kershaw: 24 Hours at the Somme (WH Allen)\n\nMartin Middlebrook: The First Day on the Somme (Pen & Sword)\n\nJohn Keegan: The Face of Battle (Vintage)\n\nEdward Liveing: 24 Hours on the Somme (Amberley)\n\nAndrew Roberts: Elegy (Head of Zeus)\n\nGarry Sheffield: Douglas Haig – From Somme to Victory (Aurum)\n\nWilliam Philpott: Bloody Victory (Abacus)\n\nPaul Fussell: The Great War and Modern Memory (OUP)\n\nSiegfried Sassoon: Memoirs of an Infantry Officer (Faber)\n\nCecil Lewis: Sagittarius Rising (Pen & Sword)\n\nGeoffrey Malins: How I Filmed The War (Project Gutenberg)\n\nI would also like to thank the following for their generous help:\n\nThe National Army Museum\n\nStuart Eastwood at Cumbria's Museum of Military Life\n\nPeter Donnelly of the King's Own Royal Regiment Museum\n\nDavid Stevenson (info boxes) and Richard Burgess (graphics)\n\nJacob Furedi and Olivia O'Neill who helped greatly with research\n\nNigel Jones for showing me where to look\n\nThe evening train back to reality\n\nEd Liveing has been lucky. He has a place on a hospital train – in the officers' carriage, no less, in a bed with soft sheets. Already it feels like being back in England: like taking the sleeper train from London to Glasgow.\n\n\"More wounded were brought or helped in – men as well as officers – till the white walls of the carriage were lined with bllod-stained, mud-covered khaki figures, lying, sitting, and propped up in various positions.\n\n\"The medical officer in charge of the train came round and asked us what we should like to drink for dinner.\n\n\"'Would you like to whisky and soda, or beer, or lemonade?' he questioned me. This sounded pleasant to my ears, but I only asked for a lemonade.\"\n\nAs the train puffs out of the station, Liveing glances back out of the window. The last thing he sees of the Somme is an aeroplane, wiggling slowly through the evening sky, dodging tiny little puffs of smoke.\n\n\"Men began to wonder, 'why?'\"\n\nAmong those left alive, doubts and questions are beginning to germinate about how this was allowed to happen. Many soldiers are now realising just how badly their battalions or companies have been gutted\n\nLieutenant Ulick Burke, 2nd Devonshires:\n\n“There was frustration. We’d lost so many people, and taken so little ground. And men began to wonder, ‘why?’ There was no feeling of giving up; they were just wondering ‘why?’ And when you came out into the billets, you saw these endless lines of walking wounded, and ambulances, and we wondered how long we could exist.\"\n\nA.V. Pearson, Leeds Pals:\n\n“The memories of those heartbreaking days will last forever. The name Serre and the date July 1st is engraved deep in our hearts, along with the faces of our ‘pals’, a grand crowd of chaps. We were two years in the making and ten minutes in the destroying.”\n\nPeace comes to Montauban\n\nIn the three-mile captured sector there is a strange calm, and soldiers are set loose to explore, to relax.\n\nOne group finds a dead German machine gunner chained to his gun by his ankle (which later sparks a rumour that the Germans man their guns with convicts). Another explores the lavish German dugouts with their electric lighting (“so much for the artillery preparation,” remarks one Tommy).\n\nIn just such a dugouts Paddy Kennedy finds a small black kitten, very nervous, and adopts it, fastening it in his pack. He also finds perfume, which his comrades sprinkle on their uniforms.\n\nThere are no orders. There is no plan – not yet. Kennedy spends the evening with some Pals of a different regiment, and the cat.\n\nMalins gets his picture\n\nAs the fighting dies down, Geoffrey Malins films the roll call of the Seaforth Highlanders opposite Beaumont Hamel.\n\n\"I filmed them as they staggered forward and dropped down utterly worn out, body and soul. By an almost superhuman effort many of them staggered to their feet again, and formed themselves into an irregular line.\n\n\"In one little space there were just two thin lines – all that was left of a glorious regiment (barely one hundred men). I filmed the scene as it unfolded itself. The sergeant stood there with note-book resting on the end of his rifle, repeatedly putting his pencil through names that were missing.\n\n\"This picture was one of the most wonderful, the most impressive that can be conceived. It ought to be painted and hung in all the picture galleries of the world, in all the school and public buildings, and our children should be taught to regard it as the standard of man's self-sacrifice.\"\n\nHe has all the footage he needs. Soon he will be back in London to edit it. The resulting film, simply entitled The Battle of the Somme, is immensely popular. Although it includes pictures of men dying on camera, and of dead bodies, it only seems to inflame patriotic feeling. Malins gets the Military Cross.\n\nGermans assault the Schwaben Redoubt\n\nThe south prong of the German counter-attack arrives. Infantry press along Staufen Trench, under fire from British machine guns on three sides. The German commander, not far off retirement, is surprised at close range by a British soldier and shot dead before someone can pass him a rifle.\n\nBut the sheer weight of bombs gives them momentum. The Germans are experts, working in teams of two – carriers and throwers. They lob in explosives, secure each traverse with bayonets and revolvers, and move up, erecting sandbag barriers behind them as they go. It's a rhythm, a war dance.\n\nA soldier of the 14th Royal Irish Rifles recalls:\n\n\"There was a carpet of dead and dying Ulstermen and Germans. Blood lay like a layer of and, do you know, you couldn't tell one blood from the other...\"\n\nPanic spreads among the Brits\n\nVon Bram’s three-pronged counter-attack is finally under way. Brits occupying the old German gun position at Grandcourt are charged twice with bayonets, forced out, and shot down as they flee.\n\nThe ejection sends a little spark of panic through the redoubt as the survivors dash for safety. Lieutenant Colonel F.O. Bowen, with the Belfast Young Brigade, recalls:\n\n\"We had to stop them at revolver point and turn them back, a desperate show, the air stiff with shrapnel, and terror-stricken men rushing blindly. These men did magnificently earlier in the day, but they had reached the limit of their endurance.\"\n\n\"Our front line in an awful state\"\n\nAnother message makes it back from Cedric Dickens in the German trenches:\n\n“Sap absolutely impassable owing to shell fire. Every party that enters it knocked out at once…our front line in an awful state…”\n\nHaig: \"I have great hopes of getting some measure of success\"\n\nA tale of two command networks\n\nThe formidable Ulstermen, deep in the German lines, are getting no support. Major-General Sir Edward Percival, commander of a nearby reserve division, urges his corps commander to let him move in to support them, following their line up the Schwaben Redoubt and widening the wedge from there. Instead he is told to split his forces and assist the other, unsuccessful attacks on either flank.\n\nThe Germans are not so picky. Within an hour of the Ulsters’ first assault Generalmajor Franz von Soden knows that they have taken Schwaben. Despite the desperate situation his troops are passing back accurate reports. He asks for backup, and is denied, so instead sends a subordinate to establish a temporary headquarters, round up whoever is available, and lead an immediate counter-attack.\n\nThe state of play at noon\n\nAcross the 16 miles of Somme front, roughly one third of the British battalions have gained their objectives. Another third are in precarious positions with heavy casualties. The final third have achieved nothing, at great cost.\n\nIn the centre, little has been achieved. The Ulsters are a knife thrust into the German line, but in danger. Hunter-Weston's attack near the Hawthorn Ridge has captured only one German position, the Quadrilateral Redoubt.\n\nAt Gommecourt, in the north, the 56th London Division used a smokescreen and tunnels to capture the whole German front line. A reserve battalion is now pushing ahead of them.\n\nThe complicated, rigid artillery plan is breaking down. In some places soldiers who are unable to take their objectives quickly enough get pinned down and repulsed because the bombardment lifts on to the next objective. Pleas to bring it back are lost in the noise.\n\nNewfoundlanders all but wiped out\n\nThe Ulsters hit a \"wall of flame\"\n\nSausage and Mash\n\nNear the village of La Boiselle the British are advancing up two fortified valleys, \"Sausage\" and \"Mash\". Within ten minutes of attacking 80 per cent of the first wave troops are dead or wounded. The first soldiers to reach the parapet disappear in the plume of a German flame thrower.\n\nIn Sausage the Germans wait until the Brits are very close and then let loose. They are so eager, and the slaughter so complete, that many of them stand up in the open on the lip of their trench to shoot down into the valley.\n\nDetachment\n\nAt his observation platform Rawlinson can see nothing. A few flashes are visible through the thick mist. There is very little he can do now to affect events.\n\nThe attack is quickly unravelling\n\nDesperate defence\n\nAt the Hawthorn Ridge redoubt the Germans are in crisis. Though some have beaten the Brits to the parapet, the Brits are now moving into the crater and the surrounding trench system.\n\nUnteroffizier Aicheler and his machine gun team have been blown backwards into the bottom of their firing pit by the mine explosion. By the time they disentangle themselves and get their gun set up the British are inside a German trench just twenty meters away.\n\nAicheler opens fire, but after ten rounds the gun stops. “Back!” he shouts, pulling his men back into the next traverse, where they set up again and try to clear the jam. The British follow – and are cut down at point black range.\n\nNow Aicheler turns his attention to a second British group. Within seconds he kills six men and the rest immediately surrender.\n\nOver the top\n\nThe first lines of men who have crept out into No Man’s Line now stand up and start moving. Those in their trenches take to their ladders. Across fifteen miles of front thousands of men step onto ground on which nobody has stood in daylight for nearly two years.\n\nAttacking the crucial village of Montauban, Captain Nevill of the East Surreys has equipped each of his platoons with a football and offered a reward to whoever can get theirs into the German lines first. One ball is lettered:\n\n“The Great European Cup\n\nThe Final\n\nEast Surreys v Bavarians\n\nKick Off at Zero”\n\nNevill goes first, his ball rising high into the air. His men follow.\n\nHawthorn Ridge becomes a pillar of flame\n\nThe Hawthorn Ridge mine goes off. Its force rushes upwards at nine miles per second. Entire German platoons vanish. Geoffrey Malins watches in awe:\n\n“The ground where I stood gave a mighty convulsion. It rocked and swayed. I gripped hold of my tripod to steady myself. Then, for all the world like a gigantic sponge, the earth rose in the air to the height of hundreds of feet. Higher and higher it rose, and with a horrible, grinding roar the earth fell back upon itself, leaving in its place a mountain of smoke.\n\n“From that second I was cold, cool, and calculating. I looked upon all that followed from the purely pictorial point of view, and even felt annoyed if a shell burst outside the range of my camera.”\n\nAs he turns his handle, men and pieces of planking blown high into the air begin to fall towards the ground.\n\nHere is his film:\n\nRawlinson's fatal mistake\n\n'All the Germans will already be dead'\n\nRawlinson’scertainty about the artillery has filtered down to his brigadiers, and from them to the lower ranks. The Newcastle Commercials (a \"Pals\" regiment made up entirely of clerical workers from Newcastle) have been told:\n\n“You will be able to go over the top with a walking stick. You will not need rifles. When you get to Thiepval you will find the Germans all dead. Not even a rat will have survived.”\n\nThe 11th Sherwood Foresters were assured:\n\n“You will meet nothing but dead and wounded Germans. You will advance to Mouquet Farm and be there by 11am. The field kitchens will follow you and give you a good meal.\n\nAnd the 8th King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry were told:\n\n“When you go over the top, you can slope arms, light up your pipes and cigarettes, and march all the way to Pozieres before meeting any live Germans.”\n\nPreliminary raids during the bombardment suggested that this optimism is misplaced. But junior officers who raised such concerns have not been well received.\n\n\"The greatest bombardment in the history of the world\"\n\nIn his cockpit 7,500 feet above the battlefield, Cecil Lewis watches the hurricane bombardment.\n\n“It was the greatest bombardment of the war, the greatest in the history of the world. The whole salient, from Beaumont Hamet down to the marshes of the Somme, covered to a depth of several hundred yards with the coverlet of white wool – smoking shell bursts!\n\n“The clock hands crept on, the thrumming of the shells took on a higher note. It was now a continuous vibration, as if Wotan, in some paroxysm of rage, were using the hollow world as a drm and under his beat the crust of it was shaking. Nothing could live under that rain of splintering steel.\n\n“A whole nation was behind it. The earth had been harnessed, the coal and ore mined, the flaming metal run; the workshops had shaped it with care and precision; our womenkind had made fuses, prepared deadly explosives; our engineers had designed machines to fire the product with a maximum of effect; and finally, here, all these vast credits of labour and capital were being blown to smithereens.\n\n“It was the most effective way of destroying wealth that man had yet devised; but as a means of extermination (roughly one man for every hundred shells), it was primitive and inefficient.”\n\nLt Gen Rawlinson observes the action"
