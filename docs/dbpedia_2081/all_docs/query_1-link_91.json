        "text": "MICHAEL DUREY For the past thirty years historians have focused on examining the processes involved in turning the British Army into a war-winning force by the second half of 1918. The trajectory of the army's development as it discovered and implemented a successful combined arms strategy has sometimes been described as a 'learning curve'. This concept embraces much more than battlefield tactics and includes analysis of the development of military doctrine and training programmes; logistics; the use of new technology; and command and control at the higher echelons of the BEF (divisions, corps and armies). 1 The learning curve has had its critics and even some of those who accept its basic premise see it as more like a rollercoaster than a smooth upward curve. 2 All, however, acknowledge that the process accelerated with the Battle of the Somme, when the enormous quantities of military hardware essential for success-not just shells for the artillery but Lewis guns and trench mortars for the infantry, tanks and better aeroplanes for the RFC-became available and the \"new\" British Army underwent its first major trial in an offensive campaign on the continent. 3 Moreover, the full arsenal of military arms required to achieve battlefield success only arrived in the middle\n\nThe battles of 1915 at Neuve Chapelle, Aubers Ridge, Festubert and Loos were, with the exception of Festubert, all fought following Sir Douglas Haig’s doctrine, of the ‘decisive’battle. But the BEF faced considerable difficulties in conducting offensive operations in 1915 – a lack of trained officers and men, munitions and materiel – and research into the operational development of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front in 1915 is still a much understudied area of the Great War. Nigel Atter investigates whether the BEF was too poorly prepared, staffed and equipped to conduct effective offensive operations in 1915 and whether it really was the worst year of the war for the BEF.\n\nAt the beginning of July 1916, the British and French armies launched a massive offensive against the Germans along the Somme River. Surprised by both the intensity and ferocity of the Entente battle of material on the Somme, the German army was caught completely off guard and suffered high casualties, if not great loss of terrain. Over the course of the battle, the Germans were forced by superior Anglo-French weaponry and tactics to improvise a new defensive tactical doctrine. This article makes use of contemporary German ‘lessons-learned’ reports to explore the development of these new defensive tactics and show that the lessons-learned system refined during the battle allowed the German army to stay intellectually flexible despite the overwhelming pressures of the battle."
