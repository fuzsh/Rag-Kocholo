        "text": "In the scale of WW1 battles, one fought a few days before the Armistice with \"only\" a 1,000 deaths seems very small beer for that conflict.\n\nHaving had the wild exultation of forcing a major breakthrough in the British lines in March, to find that a few months later that they had used up all their Eastern Front troops and had been forced back to the initial holdings of 1914 must have disheartened the Germans, seeing the fruits of 4 years blood being swiftly lost.\n\nSo, I doubt there was much \"heart\" in the defenders, as long as it wasn't the loss of German soil....\n\nIt looks as if there were a total of 286 Canadian deaths between 1st and 3rd November, some of course elsewhere, but 121 looks a little conservative.\n\nAnd were the CEF the only unit to sustain casualties in the battle?\n\nNo cynicism intended here, but I would advise caution about that figure of 800 dead Germans. Do German accounts bear out that number ?\n\nThere are still plenty of German regimental histories that give details of their casualties, and sometimes they give figures very different from the estimates that were furnished by the troops that fought them.\n\nIf the estimate of 800 dead Germans was provided by the Canadians, treat it with great circumspection.\n\nThis is not to say that Canadians were liars.....the same sorts of claims were made by all armies.\n\nBearing in mind the conditions of the battle, it is indeed hard to believe that defending soldiers with a good field of fire would have lost six times as many men killed as the soldiers that attacked them....you might have believed it if it was the other way round !\n\nPerhaps the German lines were stormed and no quarter was given for a while ; maybe the Germans broke and ran, and were cut down by artillery fire and machine guns as they fled; there is no doubt that the Canadians were about the best storm troopers out there at that time, and I can certainly imagine that they would have been adept at capturing strong positions and inflicting disproportionate casualties. But to that extent ? No, I doubt it. I wonder if the account you cite mentioned 800 dead, when it should have stated eight hundred dead and wounded. That sounds more plausible.\n\nPhil (PJA)\n\nEight hundred casualties is one thing : eight hundred dead is another. It's important that we differentiate.\n\nI hesitate to press this point, but I believe it is pertinent..............\n\nIn both World Wars the fighting between Germans and Canadians seems to have reached unparalleled levels of bitterness as far as Western armies are concerned. Dieppe and Normandy in the later conflict come to mind...in both cases killing of prisoners was conspicuous. I wonder how far the experience of the Great War impinged here. St Julien in April 1915 and the legend of the Crucified Soldier; the gas attack, religious connotations of Calvary at that time of the year. Much anecdote abounds about ANZACs killing prisoners, but I have a suspicion that the Germans might have feared the Canadians even more in this respect.\n\nI am loathe to believe that 800 Germans were killed at Valenciennes for a loss of 121 Canadian dead...but it must not be dismissed as impossible; and if the figure does have any validity, I would suspect killing of Germans during or after surrender.\n\nPhil (PJA)\n\nThe battle of Valenciennes had a number of singularities which makes it stand out among Great War battles. Certainly, starting on 1st Novemeber 1918, it was one of the last significant battles of the War, and the last major planned operation of the Canadian Corps. There is no doubt it was a genuine success, with the attackers achieving their objectives and inflicting far greater loss on the defenders than they suffered themselves. As to whether or not the numbers of German dead usually quoted are credible, I will venture the following opinions and observations:\n\n- A completely successful battle will normally result in lobsided casualties.\n\n- As has been mentioned above, at this stage of the War, German morale was not what it had been previously. Some days they fought well; other days, when hit with a heavy and well coordinated assault, they ran away easily.\n\n- There had been a mostly unsuccessful attack on this possition a few days earlier by the 51st (Highland) Division. I suppose there may have been some German casualties still on the field which may have been counted in this estimate of 800 dead.\n\n- There were not very many Canadian infantry involved, so their casualties were bound to be limited in number. The attack was conducted by a single Division (the 4th), advancing with two Brigades up and one in reserve.\n\n- It seems the attack went in at about the time a German Divisional relief was in progress. 4th Division identified all units of three different German Divisions during the operation, and parts of two others.\n\n- The most significant thing about this battle is the effect of artillery, and particularly heavy artillery on its outcome. Tucked away in the online War Diary of the Canadian Corps Heavy Artillery is a report on this operation. Eight Field Artillery Brigades and six Heavy Artillery Brigades were employed, resulting in what the Report claims was the greatest weight of heavy artillery to have supported any Canadian Corps Operation of the War. This was for a single Division advancing on a 2500 yard front! The artillery programme was quite sophisticated, especially since an attempt was made to spare many areas known to house civilians. It seems to have been held by many that the large number of prisoners was due to the breaking of German morale by the ferocity of the artillery.\n\nThere were also a couple of minor controversies that popped up afterwards concerning the actions taken by some of the actors in this drama.\n\nThere are similar accounts of lopsided slaughter of Germans in the story of the New Zealand Division's successful advance in the closing phase of the war, especially in the fighting in and around Bapaume, a battle which cost the Kiwis heavy casualties in late August and the first days of September 1918.\n\nThe German defenders resisted sternly, and deployed large numbers of machine guns in the ridges and hamlets of the surrounding countryside. The New Zealanders fought skillfully and took these positions, inflicting great carnage. I suspect that there was a visceral determination to slaughter an enemy that wavered and broke, amplified by the loss of friends who were cut down by the MG fire.\n\nHere's an account written by Major Lindsay Inglis, a Kiwi machine gunner :\n\n\" The enemy had grouped here what appeared to us enough machine guns to stop the British Army, but he had sited them too much in a line without provision for mutual support and had not protected their flanks properly by intelligent digging or the distribution of the guns. The result was that our infantry had worked around ther flanks and slaughtered them, judging from the number of field grey dead, to a man. \"\n\nThis is cited in Glynn Harper's DARK JOURNEY, pages 462-3.\n\nThere are several other accounts similar to this, describing how Germans were killed in disproportionate numbers when their positions were taken .\n\nIf this was the case in the way the New Zealanders unleashed their combat skills on the enemy, then I'm sure the Canadians matched them.\n\nPhil (PJA)\n\nHi\n\nLopsided 'casualties' could happen throughout the war another example is Grid Trench on 26 September 1916 when a party of the 7th Leicesters began to bomb down the trench in the direction of where the Guards Division was located. 'War in the Air' Vol. 2, page 291, takes up the story:\n\n\"Twenty-five minutes later an aeroplane of No. 3 Squadron (pilot, Second lieutenant L. G. Wood, observer, Lieutenant H. J. L. Cappel) was sent out to see how the Leicesters were getting on. When the aeroplane got over the trench, the officers found the bombers had already made some progress and that a tank was getting into position to help them. They saw this tank begin its crawl along the line in company with the bombers at a quarter past seven. Half an hour later the German infantry were compressed in great strength along about 500 yards of the trench between the oncoming bombers and the Guards, and the observer, giving the pin-points of their flanks sent down an area call to the artillery for fire on them. Shells fell thickly at once. Within a few minutes the tank and its bombing party had got as far as the sector which was being bombarded, a second call to the artillery to cease fire was tapped out. As the shelling ceased, the pilot dropped to three hundred feet and flew along the trench raking the unhappy occupants with machine-gun fire. Their endurance snapped, and they waved arms and white handkerchiefs in surrender to the airmen. This fact was transmitted to the infantry by message bag, and they advanced and accepted the surrender of eight officers and three hundred and sixty-two men. The total of British casualties in this brilliant little action numbered five.\"\n\nThere must have been German dead as well. It is an interesting example of 'combined arms' battle in miniature with aggressive infantry, supported by a tank with artillery support called in to shell close to 'friendly troops' and supported by an aeroplane, and in 1916!\n\nMike\n\nThere is another, unpalatable, aspect to this syndrome as well. Men who see their enemy in disarray become feral, and the urge to kill is heightened. I'm sure it's the same thing that enrages an animal if it sees another creature turn its back and run.\n\nLet me cite another Kiwi example from Glyn Harper's book.\n\nMarch 30th, 1918....a very unusual episode at the height of the German offensives, when the tables were turned and a fierce local attack was mounted against a German redoubt at La Signy Farm. The 2nd Auckland Battalion\n\n\"...entered the trenches with rifles, bayonets and bombs at the ready and the slaughter of the surprised Germans was fearful.\"\n\npage 264.\n\nAt one contested point the German machine gunners were able to cut down a Waikato Company, of whom fourteen fell shot through the head. This served to intensify the murderousness of the New Zealand attack, and the end result was that 30 New Zealanders (from the 2nd Auckland) were killed and 82 wounded ; 140 German dead were counted.\n\nThis vignette exemplifies the sort of fighting that develops when one side falls apart after initial stern resistance, and I reckon the Valenciennes action will attest to this, too.\n\nPhil (PJA)\n\nThe OP reminds us that at Valenciennes the Germans were dug in with a good field of fire.\n\nThis has got me wondering whether their deployment was fatally compromised by the same sort of defects that the NZ officer alluded to in the fighting around Bapaume that I mentioned in post 17.\n\nIn more general terms, I wish to ask : were the Germans falling back in disarray at that phase of the war, fighting \" on the back foot\", so to speak ?\n\nTrying to pitch a defensive battle in those circumstances is very different from defending the Hindenburg Line in 1917, or the Thiepval Spur in 1916.\n\nHow harried, demoralised and shaken up were the German soldiers ? Of course, there must have been tremendous variation, both in the quality of troops defending and in the prowess - and motivation - of their attackers.\n\nThe fact that 385,000 German prisoners were captured between mid July and the Armistice is cited as evidence of men choosing to surrender rather than risk combat. On the other hand, this figure might disguise a great deal of killing that was being meted out ; it could testify to awareness of what had happened at battles like Bapaume and Valenciennes.\n\nPhil (PJA)"
