        "text": "World War I, also called the First World War, the Great War, and the War to End All Wars, began in Europe in 1914. But it was not until April 6, 1917—100 years ago—that the United States Congress declared war against Germany. The American Expeditionary Force was organized and sent off to France to join the fight; by the time an armistice was declared, in November of 1918, more than 4.7 million Americans had served, 53,000 of whom were killed in action, 63,000 had died of disease, and 205,000 had been wounded.\n\nIn 2017, Green-Wood decided, in anticipation of the 100th anniversary of the United States’ entry into World War I, to identify and honor as many as possible of those who had served in that conflict, whether civilian or military, and are interred here. For the last year, our volunteers and staff have searched Green-Wood’s grounds, its records, and various online databases, in order to accomplish this goal. As of this writing, we have identified 161 men and women and written a biography for each. Their dramatic stories cover a wide range: the Cromwell twins, Red Cross nurses who served in France, then committed suicide as they began their journey home; Intelligence Officer Louis Abel, who wrote just before he was killed in battle, “As the war goes on and as I come out of each engagement still alive, I think often of those at home and wonder if I will ever see them again”; Lieutenant Kenneth Culbert, who while flying with the First Aero Squadron, photographed enemy trenches under heavy fire, only to be shot down as his plane returned to its base; Robert Bayard Cutting, associate organizing secretary of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), who volunteered to serve in France, only to die there of disease; aeronaut Private Lloyd Ludwig, who was flying over France, went into a spin, and had a wing on his plane fall off as he plummeted to his death; many men killed in the trenches of France in 1918, interred in France, then brought back home to Brooklyn in 1921; and those who served in World War I and went on to live long lives, including Louis Belmer, the last of our surviving veterans, who died in 1980. We remember them and honor their sacrifices.\n\nOn November 13, 1917, three members of the American Expeditionary Force became the first United States casualties of World War I, killed near Verdun, France. They were quickly buried near where they had fallen. This was in accord with the orders from General John Pershing, commanding American forces. Pershing had dictated that, with no time to set up logistics and no space on ships going back to America, as well as with a desire to spare survivors from seeing the corpses of their loved ones, no bodies would be sent back to the States. He decreed that all American troops who were killed in France would have their final resting place there.\n\nBut then something happened. Congressmen began to hear from their constituents—when would these men, their loved one who had died for their country, be brought home? The popular sentiment was strong: bring the bodies of the fallen home.\n\nThe British, who had lost 700,000 men, were opposed to the idea of bringing their fallen home—it would be a monumental task. The French, fearing the spectacle of bodies dug up and transported across their land, and hoping to concentrate on rebuilding, were aghast—and banned the transportation of bodies for three years.\n\nAs the debate raged, ex-President Theodore Roosevelt and his wife, Edith, wrote that they wanted their son Quentin, who had died in battle, to remain interred in France: “To us it is painful and harrowing long after death to move the poor body from which the soul has fled,” he wrote. “We greatly prefer that Quentin shall continue to lie on the spot where he fell in battle and where the foeman buried him.”\n\nBut thousands of Americans who had lost their loved ones were of a different mind: they wanted the United States government to return their sons to them for burial at home. A Brooklyn mother wrote: “My son sacrificed his life to America’s call, and now you must as a duty of yours bring my son back to me.”\n\nIn October, 1919, the U.S. War Department announced a compromise: next of kin would decide whether their fallen would remain interred in American cemeteries in France or be sent back to them. Late in 1920, France relented and agreed to allow bodies to be removed. It would take the next two years for the Americans, at great cost, to bring remains home. In all, 46,000 bodies of the fallen were brought back from France; 30,000 still remain there.\n\nOn July 21, 1921, General John Pershing was on the dock in Hoboken, New Jersey, when the first transport ship, bearing the remains of the men who had served and died under him, arrived. Pershing spoke at a ceremony honoring the first three men who had died while under his command in France—with their caskets in front of him, having returned to their native land. “They gave all,” he said, “and they have left us their example. It remains for us with fitting ceremonies, tenderly with our flowers and our tears, to lay them to rest on the American soil for which they died.” In 1921 and 1922, many of the fallen would be interred at Green-Wood Cemetery.\n\nGreat thanks to our volunteers—Susan Rudin, Ed Damato, Lou Saverese, Jim Lambert, Wallace G. Lane Jr., and all the others, as well as researcher Vincent Katinas, who made these identifications and biographies possible. Volunteers searched through Green-Wood’s chronological books, looking for men who died in France and were brought back to Green-Wood. We have searched Green-Wood’s grounds, looking for monuments dedicated to those who served in World War I. And we have gone through applications to the United States government, filled out by widows and parents, sisters and brothers, daughters and sons, for Veterans Affairs markers for their World War I veterans. Many of these veterans died in France; others lived to a ripe old age. In all, we offer biographies of 161 men and women, the last of whom died in 1980, in two sections, alphabetically; there was just too much data to put all of this into one document.\n\nThe biographies below are Green-Wood’s tribute to the men and women who served in World War I—as pilots, nurses, infantryman, gunners, pay clerks, intelligence officers, and more, who are interred at Green-Wood or who have cenotaphs here. We honor their service and sacrifice with the stories of their lives. We invite you to browse or search these biographies.\n\nBiographies\n\nABEL, LOUIS RAYMOND (1881-1918). Lieutenant and intelligence officer, 112th Infantry, 28th Division, American Expeditionary Forces, United States Army. A Brooklynite by birth and an electrical engineer by trade, Abel applied for a passport in 1905 on which he stated that he would return to the United States in about three years. A resident of Lebanon, Connecticut, he described himself as 5′ 10½” tall with gray eyes, brown hair, Roman nose, broad forehead, light complexion and oval face. He was an electrical engineer in the contracting business living in Brooklyn at the time of the 1910 census; his house on 86th Street was mortgaged. According to his great-grand-daughter, his electric contracting business took him to many cities in the Northeast. His great-grand-daughter states that he was working in Boston for two years prior to his induction into the Army.\n\nAbel enlisted at New York City and was sent abroad in May 1918. As per his Military Service Record for the State of Connecticut, he was married with one child and was affiliated with the Baptist religion. That document indicates that Abel had served with the 13th Regiment, Heavy Artillery National Guard in Brooklyn, was a Freemason and was employed as an electrical engineer. During World War I, he was a first lieutenant and intelligence officer with responsibility for reconnaissance behind German lines. He wrote this letter to his brother on September 14, 1918, thirteen days before his death.\n\nMy dear brother Eugene,\n\nAs the war goes on and as I come out of each engagement still alive, I think often of those at home and wonder if I will ever see them again.\n\nYou all are in my thoughts continually when I have time to think of other things besides the continual shellfire and fighting.\n\nYou may readily believe brother of mine that we think of nothing but shells, gas, and bullets and bayonets when we are in action and when a man says differently you can believe he has never been under fire. All one thinks of is where the next shell is going to land.\n\nIt gives one a great feeling of comfort to know that there is a competent doctor near at hand and enough stretcher bearers and ambulances to carry one to the rear when hurt. I have been gased once and was ill for a short while but did not go out of action. I also got a scratch from a machine gun bullet but it is all O.K. now. Have been troubled with diarrhea for several weeks but am getting better. That is a common complaint here. So many dead bodies both horses and men and the doctors say the flys (sic) carry the germs to the food we eat. With the coming of cold weather the flys will disappear and we will be rid of this I am sure.\n\nMany of our fine boys have gone never to return. And of my first Scout Platoon of 28 men I had 20 casualties and only 8 men were left after our advance at the Marne and I now have a new Platoon of 40 men and have lost a few of these.\n\nMy work takes me in front of the advance and the lines reconnoitering in the Boche lines for enemy positions. It is awe inspiring work especially in the darkness of night. The best times are the darkest nights when it is stormy.\n\nI recently lay several hours with four men in a ditch partially submerged in water and mud while the Boche were all around me. I thought I was a gone goose that night.\n\nMy nerves have been sorely tried and many officers and men have lost out completely due to nervous strain making them useless.\n\nI sincerely hope all is well with you and yours. Love to all and may the God who watches over us all bring us together again.\n\nLovingly your brother\n\nLouis\n\nAbel was killed in battle in Argonne, France, on September 27, 1918. His mother was notified of his death by telegram on November 3, 1918. His body was returned to the United States and he was interred on September 25, 1921.

He described himself as tall, of medium build with blue eyes and light hair (not bald). As per one New York State Abstract of World War I service, in which his name is spelled “Abrahamson,” he enlisted in the United States Navy as a chief yeoman on the USS Ozark on February 9, 1916.

From July 12, to September 11, 1918, he was stationed at the Naval Air Station at Brunswick, Georgia. Abrahamsen then served in Washington, D.C., at Naval Operations under Supply Officer of Northern Bombing, Squadron, France, until November 8, 1918 (another document lists the expiration of that assignment as the date of the armistice, November 11, 1918). He returned to the Naval Air Station in Brunswick, Georgia, where he died on December 13, 1918. He last lived at 747 43rd Street in Brooklyn.

At that time, he was self-employed, working at 31 North Broad Street in Ridgewood, New Jersey. His last address was 44 Carlton Avenue in Ho-Ho-Kus. On October 1, 1961, Alma K. Adams, his widow, applied for a government-issued headstone with a Christian cross, citing his World War I service and medals earned. Section 131, lot 33207, grave 1.\n\nAITKEN, MARY M. (1888-1971).

According to his daughter, who has researched her father’s genealogy, he was born in Smyrna (now Izmir), Turkey; his soldier records and census data list his place of birth as Greece. His birth name was Stulianos Andrikides. He immigrated to the United States on the Themistocles on August 23, 1914; his name was spelled Stylianos Androkidis on that ship’s manifest. His name, spelled Shilianos Andrikides, is on the manifest of the Morro Castle, a mail ship from Havana, Cuba, arriving in New York on February 26, 1917; he was a seaman on that vessel until his induction into the Army. (The captain of the ocean liner, also named the Morro Castle, which traveled between Havana and New York in the 1930s, is buried at Green-Wood; he died when that ship caught fire and ran aground in Asbury, New Jersey, with many lives lost, on September 8, 1934.)\n\nAndrikides served in World War I under the name Stulianos or Shilianos Andrikides. His Draft Registration Card, dated June 5, 1917, reports that Shilianos Andrikides, born in Piraeus, Greece, was a seaman and cook with alien (non-citizen) status; he was single, 5′ 6″ tall, of medium build with brown hair and brown eyes. At that time, he lived at 4 James Slip in New York City. As per his New York Abstract of World War I Military service, which spells his given name as Stulianos, he was inducted at Local Board #91 in New York on June 28, 1918, and assigned to the 152nd Depot Brigade until July 18, 1918, at which time he was transferred to Company L of the 346th Infantry.

The census of 1940, which states his name as Stephen Andres, indicates that he was married with five children, lived at 8121 Fourteenth Avenue in Brooklyn, was a naturalized citizen, and worked as a chef. He reported that he rented his residence for $51 per month, had completed an eighth grade education, and had earned $2,800 the previous year. His World War II Draft Registration Card, filed in 1942 under the name Steve Andrikides, notes that he still lived at the Fourteenth Avenue address and was self-employed at 410 86th Street in Brooklyn. He became the owner of Andres Catering Corporation, a well-known enterprise in the Bay Ridge/Fort Hamilton neighborhood of Brooklyn with five catering halls hosting weddings and other special events. He was interred under the name Steve Andres. Section 170, lot 41089, grave 1.\n\nANDREWS, RUFUS (or RUBEN) F. (1895-1950). Private, 22nd Infantry, Company K; 2nd Developmental Battalion, Company G, United States Army. A native of New York City, Andrews completed two years of high school and worked as a clerk for the American Tobacco Company, according to his Draft Registration Card filed on June 5, 1917, at Manual Training High School (now John Jay High School) in Brooklyn. The aforementioned document also notes that he was 5′ 3″ tall, weighed 125 pounds, and had gray eyes and brown hair. His home address was 416 2nd Street in Brooklyn. He was subsequently drafted into the Army on May 21, 1918, and assigned as a private to Company K of the 22nd Infantry until September 13, when he was transferred to Company G, 2nd Developmental Battalion, from which he received an honorable discharge on November 22, 1918, eleven days after the armistice. Andrews did not serve overseas. His discharge included a 12.5 % disability “in view of occupation.” Development battalions were organized for soldiers who had literacy issues or minor mental or physical problems that would normally preclude them from service.\n\nAccording to the 1930 census, Andrews was single, lived in Brooklyn with his aging parents, and was employed as a clerk for lawyers. Although the 1940 census shows him to be unemployed and living at home in Brooklyn with his 80 year old step-mother, his military records indicate that he was admitted to the Roseburg Branch of the Home for Disabled Soldiers in Hampton, Virginia, in 1933; it is unclear if he was discharged from the Soldiers’ Home before 1940. The paperwork at the Soldiers’ Home noted that Andrews could read and write, worked as a clerk for a lawyer, and was Catholic. He died at the Northport Veterans Hospital in Northport, New York. On November 6, 1950, shortly after his death, Helen Andrews of 149 Pierrepont Street in Brooklyn, applied for a government-issued upright granite headstone with a Christian emblem, citing Rufus Andrews’s World War I service. Section 160, lot 11712.\n\nANKELMAN (or ANKELMANN), RUDOLPH D. (1895-1918). Private first class, 307th Infantry, Company H, American Expeditionary Forces, United States Army. A native Brooklynite, Ankelman’s Draft Registration Card reports that he was of medium height and weight with brown eyes and light hair. He was unmarried and was employed as a clerk at that time. Ankelman was inducted into the Army on July 17, 1917, and assigned to Company H of the 307th Infantry. He was shipped out to France on April 7, 1918.\n\nDuring World War I, the 307th Infantry was assigned to the 154th Infantry Brigade and became part of the 77th Infantry Division and served with distinction in the following campaigns in France: Oise-Aisne, Meuse-Argonne, Champagne, and Lorraine. Ankelman was killed in action on August 27, 1918. His last residence was 459 6 Avenue in Brooklyn. His remains were returned to the United States in 1921 and were interred on June 6, 1921. On April 16, 1932, Lavinia Adami applied for a government-issued headstone citing Ankelmann’s World War I service. His surname was spelled with two n’s on the headstone paperwork. Section 206, lot 27769, grave 1.\n\nANNABLE, OLIVER STEVENSON (1890-1952). Field clerk, Headquarters Eastern Department, United States Army. Annable was born in Brooklyn. According to the 1910 census, he was employed as a stenographer at a heating company. As per his Draft Registration Card for World War I, filed at Manual Training High School (now John Jay High School), he claimed exemption from military service because of bad eyesight and the aftereffects of infantile paralysis (polio). At that time, he was described as of medium height and build with blue eyes and brown hair and lived at 411 3rd Street in Brooklyn. Although he asked for an exemption, he nonetheless entered the United States Army on July 23, 1917. He was assigned as an Army field clerk at Headquarters of the Eastern Department located on Governor’s Island in New York Harbor. He was honorably discharged on September 12, 1919, having served stateside.\n\nThe Registrar’s Report from his World War II Draft Registration on April 25, 1942, notes that Annable was 5′ 9″ tall, 175 pounds with blue eyes, brown and gray hair, and a ruddy, freckled complexion. He lived at 2807 Farragut Road in Brooklyn at that time. His last residence was 628 East 28th Street in Brooklyn. He died at Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn. On December 14, 1953, a year after his death, his family applied for a government-issued upright marble headstone and cited his World War I service at Headquarters. Section 202, lot 25915.\n\nARCHER, ROBERT (or ROB) A. (1892-1922). Private first class, 48th Infantry, Company A and Quartermaster Corps, United States Army. Archer was born in New York City. According to the census of 1910, he lived on Third Avenue in Manhattan with his parents and siblings and worked as a clerk for a jeweler. The 1915 New York State census reports that he was living in Brooklyn with his mother and siblings and working as a bookkeeper. As per his World War I Draft Registration Card, filed on June 5, 1917, Archer lived at 39 Prospect Place in Brooklyn, was single, worked as a clerk and claimed an exemption from the draft because he was supporting his mother. On that aforementioned form, he described himself as tall and slender with blue eyes and brown hair. Although he asked for an exemption, he was inducted into the Army at Brooklyn on May 21, 1918, and assigned to Company A of the 48th Infantry until August 6, 1918, when he was promoted to private first class. He was then detached to the Quartermaster Corps #2 at Newport News, Virginia, until August 28 when he was transferred to the Quartermaster Corps #5 until October 30, 1918, and then returned to the Quartermaster Corps #2 until his discharge on December 14, 1918. Archer did not serve overseas.\n\nOn November 25, 1919, Archer married Lena H. Baumer in Manhattan. His obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, which confirms his service in the 48th Infantry in the World War, notes that he was a clerk in the Engineering Department of the New York Central Railroad. Archer was a member of the American Legion and the Hanson Place Methodist Episcopal Church. His funeral took place at the home of his mother, Annie Archer, at 1644 New York Avenue in Brooklyn. He last lived at 1485 Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn. Section C, lot 36067.\n\nARMSTRONG, FRANK (or FRANCIS) EDWARD (1896-1969). Sergeant, 104th Field Artillery, Battery E, American Expeditionary Forces, United States Army; 1st Field Artillery, New York State National Guard, Battery E. Armstrong was born in Brooklyn. According to his grandson, one of his ancestors was John Armstrong Jr., the Secretary of War in President James Madison’s cabinet. As per his New York State Abstract of World War I Military Service, he enlisted as a private in the New York State National Guard on February 5, 1914, and was assigned to Battery E of the 1st Field Artillery when he mustered in on June 28, 1916. Armstrong’s muster roll for the Mexican Punitive Campaign reports that he was a clerk who lived at 1289 St. John’s Place in Brooklyn, and was 5′ 7″ tall with blue eyes and brown hair; his mother, Alice Armstrong, was listed as his next of kin. He mustered out with his battery on November 15, 1916, at New York City, and entered the Reserves on February 26, 1917.\n\nOn July 20, 1917, Armstrong returned to the National Guard for service in World War I; his unit was designated as the 104th Field Artillery on October 1, 1917, and was later part of the 27th Division. He was promoted to corporal on November 6, 1917, and to sergeant on April 14, 1918. On June 30, 1918, he was shipped overseas and served until March 13, 1919; he was honorably discharged on April 1, 1919. Armstrong was awarded the Silver Star for his valor in World War I. His soldier record for World War I notes that on December 27, 1919, he was cited “for gallantry in action during operations in the vicinity of Brabant-sur-Meuse, France, October 14, 1918, for repairing and maintaining telephone lines under heavy enemy shell fire.”\n\nThe 1924 Voter List shows that Armstrong lived at 570 St. Marks Avenue in Brooklyn. In 1927, he married Marjorie Wilkes. The 1940 census reports that he was married with two children, and owned his house, valued at $6,ooo, at 2984 Avenue T in Brooklyn. He was employed as a switchman and had earned $4,000 in 1939; that census also indicates that he had graduated high school. His World War II Draft Registration Card, filed in 1942, reports that he still lived on Avenue T with his wife, had a home telephone, and worked for the New York Telephone Company at 335 14th Street in Brooklyn. He died in Lakewood, New Jersey. As per his descendant, Frank Armstrong was buried in the family lot which was purchased by his ancestors, James (a cousin of the aforementioned Secretary of War) and Margaret Armstrong on February 15, 1848, for $80. Section 57, lot 2283.\n\nARNESEN, ERLING (1890-1945). Sergeant, 14th Infantry, New York State National Guard, Company C, United States Army. Originally from Stavanger, Norway, Arnesen’s family immigrated to the United States in 1904 and settled in Brooklyn. As per the census of 1910, he was single, living with his parents and siblings on 29th Street in Brooklyn, able to read and write, and working as a clerk. According to his Abstract of World War I Military Service, he enlisted as a corporal in the New York National Guard on April 20, 1914, and was assigned to the 14th New York Infantry. His muster roll reports that he worked as a correspondent. His family’s application for a government-issued headstone and his muster roll indicate that he was in Federal Service from July 31 to October 11, 1916, in the Mexican Punitive Campaign. During the Mexican Campaign, he was promoted to sergeant on September 6, 1916. He was honorably discharged on July 17, 1917.\n\nHis World War I Abstract notes that he did not serve overseas or suffer any wounds during his military duty. Arnesen’s World War I Draft Registration Card, filed at Brooklyn on May 14, 1918, notes that he was employed by A.F. Langhorst as a salesman who worked at 100 Hudson Street in Manhattan, was a naturalized citizen, and lived at 204 33rd Street in Brooklyn with his wife and child. Arnesen was described on that form as 5′ 5 ½” tall with a fair complexion, slender build, blond hair and blue eyes. He also claimed an exemption from the draft and stated that he had served three years in New York State National Guard. He last lived at 37 South Union Avenue in Cranford, New Jersey; he died at Norwegian Hospital in Brooklyn.

Corporal, 11th Regiment, Company C, United States Marine Corps. Born in Newark, New Jersey, he lived in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1909, and then in Jersey City as of 1910. As per the 1905 New Jersey State census, Arrison’s family lived at 83 Kensington, Jersey City. His father, a widower and a ticket agent for the railroad, was listed as head of household. Residing in that home was Arrison, nineteen years old and not employed, and his older sister, Jean, a school teacher. The 1910 federal census records the family living at 166 Belmont Avenue, Jersey City. Arrison’s father, now retired, is documented as head of household and Arrison was a draughtsman for a house roofing company. The 1915 New Jersey State census indicates that Arrison and his father resided at 58 Belmont Avenue, Jersey City, and that Arrison was single and a clerk.\n\nArrison enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on July 21, 1918, three months after the United States declaration of war against Germany. He was assigned to Company “U” at the Marine Barracks, Port Royale, South Carolina, where Marine recruits were sent to train. The facility was expanded extensively during the war and re-designated as Marine Barracks, Paris Island. According to the November 1918 Marine Corps muster roll, Arrison was assigned to Company “C,” 11th Regiment. Also appearing next to his name on the muster roll is this notation: “6 to 30 Military Police at Mehua.” Company C’s deployment during World War I was brief. As per the website on the 11th Marine Regiment’s history:\n\nThe present 11th Marine Regiment has been preceded by three other organizations having similar designations. The first was activated during World War I on 3 January 1918 as the 11th Marine Regiment. Originally planned as a light artillery regiment, it was converted to an infantry unit and went to France as part of the 5th Marine Brigade in the waning days of the war. It failed to see combat and returned home to be disbanded on 11 August 1919.\n\nA 1919 muster roll, month unknown, reveals Arrison was promoted to corporal.\n\nThe 1920 census shows him to be single, able to read and write, and living on Belmont Avenue in Jersey City, New Jersey, with his father and Arrison’s older brother and wife, and their four children. Arrison married Kathryn E. Schaefer on September 4, 1926. The 1930 census notes that he was the head of household, a wholesale grocery merchant, and lived in Hudson City, New York, with his wife and son. The Hudson City Directory of 1931 shows Arrison to be married and employed as a salesman. At the time of the 1940 census, Arrison, now a salesman for a biscuit company, still lived in Hudson City with his wife and son.\n\nAs per his World War II Draft Registration Card filed in 1942, he was living at 39 Parkwood Boulevard in Hudson, New York, and was employed by the Ontario Biscuit Company in Albany; his wife, Kathryn, was designated as the contact person. His registrar’s report, dated April 26, 1942, describes him as 5′ 7″ tall, 170 pounds with hazel eyes, gray hair, and light complexion. According to the New York death index, Kathryn passed away on August 25, 1944. On November 3, 1945, as per the New York State marriage index, he married Lorraine Lawler. He lived in Hudson at the time of the 1950 census. His last address was 20 Hanes Street in Albany, New York; he died at Albany Hospital. Four days after his death, Lorraine Arrison applied for a government-issued headstone with a Christian emblem, citing his World War I service. As indicated on the United States Headstone Applications for Military Veterans, Arrison served in the Marines from July 21, 1918 to August 11, 1919 and was honorably discharged. Section 92, lot 1900.\n\nBAHAN, CHESTER THOMAS (1874-1936). Plumber and fitter, United States Navy. Bahan was born in New York. At 43 years of age, he enlisted in the United States Navy on April 3, 1917, at the 3rd Naval Base located at Tompkinsville, Staten Island. He worked as a plumber and fitter for Mine Sweeping Squadron No. 10. Bahan received a citation for efficiency. He was honorably discharged on April 2, 1921.\n\nAccording to the 1930 census, Bahan was employed as a master plumber for Sun business, owned his home valued at $6,500, and owned a radio set. His last address was 10 Edwin Street, Bay Shore, New York. The town of Islip, Long Island, included his name and service record in their archives honoring local veterans who served in World War I. The archive was dedicated to General of Armies John J. Pershing and includes this quote attributed to Pershing, “…I pay supreme tribute to our officers and soldiers of the line. When I think of their heroism, their patience under hardship, their unflinching spirit of offensive action, I am filled with emotion which I am unable to express. Their deeds are immortal and they have earned the eternal gratitude of our country.” On March 10, 1936, soon after his death, Bahan’s family applied for a government-issued marble headstone, citing his Naval service in World War I.

Section 131, lot 35146, grave 1.\n\nBANKER, GRACE DERBY (1892-1960). First lieutenant and Chief Operator of Female Switchboard Operators, American Expeditionary Forces, United States Army Signal Corps. Born in Passaic, New Jersey, on October 25, 1892, Grace Banker grew up there. Her parents were William Bushnell Banker and Edith Lillian Armstrong Banker, according to her “Overlooked No More” New York Times 2019 obituary. They were married on October 22, 1889, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, as inscribed in the Derby family bible, per the Dutchess County Historical Society.\n\nThe Banker family is listed in the 1900 United States federal census as living at 58 Storms Avenue in Jersey City, New Jersey. Grace spoke English and, at 7 years old, she attended school and was able to read and write. Her father was 40 years old and had been born in New York, while her mother was 30 and had been born in New Jersey. Grace had a 9-year-old sister, Helen S., and a 5-year-old brother, Eugene A.\n\nBy the 1910 federal census, the family was living on Raid Avenue North in Passaic. Grace was 17 and, in addition to Helen and Eugene, there was now another daughter, Marjorie F., age 9. Grace’s father was an accountant and, per the United States Army National Museum, both parents valued education deeply. An honor graduate of Passaic High School, Grace received her bachelor’s degree in 1916 from Barnard College in New York City with a double major in French and history.\n\nGrace began work as a telephone operator for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, one of the few jobs available to women at the time, and she quickly rose to the role of switchboard instructor, as noted in her New York Times obituary. The Times reported that, in December 1917, Grace answered an Army advertisement in The New York Post seeking women who could speak French and English to operate switchboards, a relatively new technology at the time. According to Elizabeth Cobbs’s 2017 book, The Hello Girls, women recruits were more expert and faster at this type of work than their male counterparts. The operators underwent months of training and then were given dog tags and uniforms that included skirts and bloomers. The work was fast-paced and exhausting, with some 150,000 calls a day and the use of memorized coded language that was frequently changed. Lorraine Boissoneault’s April 4, 2017 article, “Women on the Frontlines of WWI Came to Operate Telephones,” in Smithsonian magazine, explained that, in 1918, the United States Army Signal Corps sent 223 women to France. In addition to constantly fielding simultaneous calls, they needed to translate from English to French and vice-versa, since an American officer might not speak French, and a French officer might not speak English. They worked in extremely dangerous conditions, in one of the few non-medical roles available to women, as described in the records of the National Museum of the United States Army, allowing American and French armies to communicate efficiently.\n\nOn March 7, 1918, Grace wrote in her diary that she sailed for France to take up the assignment as chief operator for First Army headquarters in Paris. From there, she and her team of 33 female telephone operators were posted to the headquarters of General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, in Chaumont sur Haute Marne. As detailed in Christopher H. Sterling’s Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century (2008), after five months, they were sent on to the war front, stationed at the First Army headquarters at Ligny-en-Barrois, where Grace served as the chief operator. She and six other operators supported the American assault on German-held St. Mihiel by sending, decoding, and intercepting messages. When Pershing led the American Expeditionary Forces against the Germans at the Battle of the Meuse-Argonne, Grace was with him, keeping the lines of communication open in the closing campaign of the war, as written in Richard Cowen’s article, “Number, Please? ‘Hello Girls’ Answered the Call in World War I,” in the July 10, 2019 North Jersey Record.\n\nWhile overseas, Grace received news that her father had died in July 1918. As reported in the New York Herald on May 26, 1919, with the fighting over, she oversaw the telephone exchange at the Paris Peace Conference in Versailles in January 1919. Per her obituary in the Passaic, New Jersey Herald-News, she then remained with the Army of Occupation in Germany. She was presented the Distinguished Service Medal for bravery “before a crowd of admiring officers and enlisted men” on May 22, 1919, in Koblenz, Germany, the first woman to receive the medal. It was presented to her by Lieutenant General Liggett at Army Headquarters. The citation reads, as reproduced in the holdings of the National World War I Museum and Memorial:\n\nFor exceptionally meritorious and Distinguished services. She served with exceptional ability as Chief Operator in the Signal Corps Exchange at General Headquarters, American Expeditionary Forces and later in a similar capacity at First Army Headquarters. By untiring devotion to her exacting duties under trying conditions, she did much to assure the success of the telephone service during the operations of the First army against the St Mihiel salient and the operations to the north of Verdun.\n\nAccording to Doran Cart, senior curator at the National World War I Museum, the Signal Corps women were not called “Hello Girls” during the war. However, a June 13, 1919 Lansing State Journal article, “Hello Girl Wins D.S.M.,” published soon after the end of the war, led with that term. An “All Things Considered” National Public Radio program, aired on November 9, 2018, explained that the term was used “to put women in their place, to call them girls, to show that they were not as important as the men who were serving in the war.”\n\nGrace returned to her home at 227 Van Houten Avenue in Passaic after having served 20 months overseas. United States Army Transport Passenger Lists show she left Brest, France, on August 24, 1919, as a civilian, arriving in Hoboken New Jersey on September 3, 1919.\n\nA March 5, 1922 New York Times marriage notice reveals that she married Eugene Hiram Paddock Jr. in St. John’s Episcopal Church in Passaic on March 4, 1922, and was thereafter known as Grace Banker Paddock (the name that is cut into her gravestone). Her husband graduated Columbia University in 1915 and was a civil engineer, living at 148 West 72nd Street in New York City, when they married. He had worked on the construction of the Tayford Company’s power plant in East Lee, Massachusetts prior to their marriage, as detailed in their March 8, 1922 Berkshire County Eagle wedding announcement.\n\nBy the time the 1925 New York State census was undertaken, the couple was living in White Plains, New York, with their infant son, Arthur Royce Paddock, as well as their eldest son, Eugene Alden Paddock, age 2 (he wrote his year of birth as 1923 on his World War II draft registration card.) They had moved to Scarsdale, New York, by the time of the 1930 federal census, and were dwelling on Greenacres Avenue with their two sons – Arthur R. Paddock was then listed as 3 years old and another son, Stephen Banker Paddock, was listed as two. Ida Rosskopf, a 21-year-old servant, also lived in the household.\n\nThe 1940 federal census shows the family living at 98 Greenacres Avenue in Scarsdale. Grace was not working outside the home and the family included, in addition to Arthur, age 14, and Stephen, 12, a daughter Grace Seabury Paddock, age 9. Roselle McCullum, a 60-year-old servant, lived in the house as well. Grace’s occupation in the 1950 census was listed as “keeping house,” at the same address on Greenacres Avenue in Scarsdale. The only child living at home was their son Eugene A. Paddock, with his age listed as 26 (he wrote 1927 as his year of birth on his World War II draft registration card.)\n\nGrace died of cancer at her home at 98 Greenacres Avenue according to her obituary in the December 19, 1960 Reporter Dispatch. She had been a member of the Church of St. James the Less in Scarsdale. In addition to her husband and four children, she had two grandchildren, Andrew and Peter Timble, sons of her daughter, Grace Seabury Paddock Timble, as mentioned in her December 19, 1960 Herald-News obituary.\n\nAfter World War I, Grace and the other female telephone operators had been treated as civilian contractors and discharged without veteran’s status. Per information supplied by the National World War I Museum and Memorial, it wasn’t until 1977, long after Grace’s 1960 death, that this was rectified by legislation and the surviving telephone operators received recognition as veterans. However, they received no other benefits, such as healthcare, back pay, etc., except to be interred with this recognition on their headstones.\n\nEugene Paddock died on November 18, 1976, in Westchester County, New York, and is interred with his wife at Green-Wood, as are their sons Eugene and Stephen, the senior Eugene’s parents, and other members of the Paddock family.

Barnaby, who was born in Brooklyn, was listed as single and living with his parents according to the census of 1910. On April 16, 1917, he enlisted in the 14th Regiment of the New York State National Guard and was promoted to corporal on October 9 of that year. Barnaby was sent overseas with the 106th Infantry (a unit that had its roots in the 23rd Regiment with strong support from the 14th Regiment) on May 10, 1918. On September 27, 1918, he was killed in France while his unit was engaged in action along the Hindenburg Line, a German defensive position along their Western Front. His father was notified of his death. He last lived at 12 Waldorf Court in Brooklyn. After his remains were returned to the United States, Barnaby was re-interred on April 19. 1921. Section 5, lot 34355, grave 3.\n\nBARNETT, SAMUEL (1978-1918). Private, Depot Battalion (Central Ontario), Canadian Infantry. Of Irish birth, Barnett was a founder of Empire City Wheelman, a bicycle club. An article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on July 14, 1918, reports that a service flag with one gold star was hung at the entrance to Prospect Park in honor of the thirty members of the aforementioned club, one of whom was Barnett, who had enlisted in the World War. That article identifies Barnett, who had the gold star by his name, as one of the best-known judges of bicycle racing in the East. In addition, it notes that he enlisted in the Canadian Officers Training Corps and that he died from pneumonia.\n\nHis name appears on an online list, Commonwealth War Graves, of the final resting places of British Commonwealth veterans. He died in Toronto, Canada. Section J, lot 33488, grave 1.\n\nBARNUM, WILLIAM PECK (1861-1929). Boatswain’s mate, United States Navy.

As per the 1920 census, he was married, able to read and write, living at 21 Clinton Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island, and working as a boatswain’s mate in the United States Navy; the 1925 Newport City Directory lists him at the same home address and his occupation as helper. He last lived at 21 Clinton Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island; his death was attributed to senility. On July 16, 1931, Loretta Barnum, his widow, applied for a government-issued headstone with a Christian emblem, citing her husband’s World War I service.

On November 12, 1943, he became a naturalized citizen; he then lived at 14 Sutton Place South in Manhattan. Rufino Barrera Jr., his son, served in the Navy during World War II. Section 76, lot 4141.\n\nBARTHMAN, HENRY CHARLES (1868-1941). Commander, Depot Battalion, 47th New York State National Guard. Barthman was born in Brooklyn. As per his obituary in The New York Times, he enlisted as a private at Brooklyn in the old 47th Regiment of the New York State National Guard in 1886 and served as a major in Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War and was a colonel of that regiment until retiring in 1913. When the 47th was federalized in 1917 during World War I, Barthman organized a depot battalion of the regiment, now known as the new 47th Regiment; he served as its commander. The depot battalion was responsible for the New York National Guard’s wartime duty within the State. He retired in 1919 as a brigadier general.\n\nIn civilian life, he was a senior member of the prominent Barthman jewelry store at 174 Broadway. That establishment was founded in 1884 by him and his father, Frederick William Barthman (a Civil War veteran with whom he is buried) and brother, who bore his father’s name. In addition, he was treasurer of the Jewelers Security Alliance and the Maiden Lane Historical Society.\n\nBarthman’s obituary notes that he was an avid fisherman. He spent three months of the year fishing in Maine and three months in Florida, where in 1939, he caught the largest tarpon off the Useppa Island area on the west coast, in the last 10 years.
