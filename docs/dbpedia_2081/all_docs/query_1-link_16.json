        "text": "William Ellsworth Kepner\n\nHoward County, Indiana\n\nDistinguished Service Cross:\n\n\"While in command of a battalion, Captain Kepner personally led one company of his command in an attack on a woods occupied by a company of German machine gunners. He was the first man to enter the woods, and later when part of the attacking company was held up by flanking machine-gun fire, he, with a patrol of three men, encircled this machine gun, and after a hard hand-to-hand fight, put the gun out of action.\" (Ed note: Lt Kepner transferred to the Army Air Corps after the war and became an airship pilot. He was promoted to Major General in WW2 and commanded the 8th Air Force, 2nd Bomb Division completing 24 combat missions.)\n\nEarl Charles Kleiner, AEF,\n\nRipley County\n\n“Had orders to ‘go over the top’ on the morning of November 11, 1918, to take the city of Adenaard, Belgium which was held by the Germans. The order was held up on November 10 and the troops halted until the evening of November 11, when they moved into Adenaard and stayed until November 18th.\n\n“On November 11, the refugees began coming through the lines in the forenoon. They were extremely destitute, being very inefficiently clothed. Most of them found their homes destroyed. They had no funds, so a bread and soup kitchen was opened for them in the Hotel de Ville. For shelter, these refugees were quartered in cellars and other parts of large, empty buildings such as stores and warehouses.\n\n“The soldiers cleaned up the city while occupying it; hauled refuse such as brick and plaster from the streets. Moved church property from a place of storage in the convent, back to the churches not destroyed. All bridges across the Scheldt were mined and these mines are thrown as soon as the Americans entered the city and had to be rebuilt.\n\nFlorence Leo Fischer, Co. F, 334th Inf., 84th Div.,\n\nRipley County, Indiana\n\nSpent 21 days under fire in the trenches at Verdun.\n\nWalter Morrison, Infantry, AEF,\n\nRipley County, Indiana\n\n“Hiked to Germany November 11 – December 3, 1918, via Luxembourg into Coblenz Area, at Cochon from Dec. to April 10, 1919. Moved up to the Rhine until July 1, 1919. Returned by train through Belgium to Brest, France.\n\n“The 4th Division was known as the ‘Lost Division’ due to lack of newspaper exploitation. This lack is explained by the fact that this was a miscellaneous division, belonging to no particular section of the United States in the organization.\n\n“The insignia is four ivy leaves in a circle, its meaning ‘The ivy clings to its friends, is poison to its enemies.”\n\n(See patch below)\n\nLeora McKinley Weare, Infantry, 30th Div., KIA St. Quintin,Ripley County, Indiana\n\n“Hiked to Belgium from Eperlocques, July 4, 1918. Reached Watteau, Belgium on July 4. Went to Lyons and relieved the British soldiers in the trenches between Ypres and Kimmel Hill. Held the trenches for 17 days, going in on July 15 and coming out on August 2, 1918. Rested at Watteau, 4 days. Returned to the trenches for 20 days more. On August 3rd, captured Voormezeele with several prisoners and guns.\n\nLeft Belgium on September 5, 1918. Went in boxcars to Roelle-court, France. Was attached to the Second British Army and trained until September 17th. Moved South to Trencourt, Sept., 22, and took over first-line trenches from the Australians on Sept 23rd and 24th. Held this position until September 29th.\n\nOn September 29th, 1918 the 30th American Division, 27th American Division, and 46th British Division on the right, the 30th in the center, assaulted the Hindenburg Line which at the point of the assault curved in front of St. Quintin and was considered by the Germans to be unbreakable. The 60th Brigade, the 119th and the 120th Infantry, supported the 117th and 118th Infantries, American troops, 30th Division, attacked at 5:50 AM and captured with the tunnel system, the German troops holding the city of Bellecourt with five adjacent smaller towns and two entire German Divisions were defeated. 147 officers and 1,434 soldiers were taken, prisoners.\n\nCo. M went into the fight with 218 men, came out with 49. Fifty-two were killed, 17 wounded. Ora Weare was killed by a high explosive shell. He was hit in the back and suffered a double fracture of the leg.\n\nThe dead were buried on October 2, about 200 yards of the wall of St. Quintin, 3 Ripley County boys, side by side as they fell.\n\nCharles Allan Schofner, Sergeant,Vanderburg County, Indiana\n\nCo. K, 335th Infantry, 84th Div.\n\nCo. K, 28th Infantry, 1st Div.\n\nCo. B, 3rd Army Composite Regiment\n\nWhile with Co.

Also paraded in London, England this parade July 19; New York, September 10 and in Washington, September 17, 1919.\n\nRussell Manship, Co. M, 126th Infantry, 34th Div., Goldstar, Hamilton County\n\nDied Oct. 18, 1918, from wounds received in action while fighting in the Argonne Sector.\n\nClyde Charles Peters, Infantry, AEF, Ripley County, Indiana\n\n“34th & 64th Infantry were the 14th Brigade and were trained in France until October 1, 1918, when pronounced ready for action and sent to the Puvenelle Sector. Here they were under fire from German snipers and machine guns, artillery barrages, and also airplane bombardment. The order to advance came on November 9th. The regiment was formed to advance in three waves. The first wave advanced to the objective assigned them, the second wave advanced through this line to the next objective and the third wave on through the third objective. Thus it was a continual drive until November 11 when the Armistice stopped the advance. Only 84 men were left of the 250 of the month before in Company K. 34th Infantry.”\n\nJames Bethel Gresham, Company F, 16th Infantry, Vanderburg County\n\nFirst American casualty of World War I.\n\n\"Prof. John B. McMaster in his work, 'United States in the World War,\" gives the following account of the battle:\n\n\"The first trench fighting occurred just before dawn on the morning of November 3, with a small detachment of Americans in a front line instruction salient were attacked by a superior force of Germans and the salient cut off from the rest of the men by a heavy barrage. The fighting then became hand-to-hand. In the course of it, three Americans were killed, five wounded and 11 taken prisoners. The dead were buried on the slope of the hill overlooking a little village somewhere in France, in the site a few months later was marked by a stone monument bearing the name and Regiment of each of the dead and the inscription: 'Here lies the for soldiers of the great Republic of the United States who died on the soil of France for justice and liberty, November 3, 1917.\n\nIt is the pride of this community that the first of these three Americans was Cpl. James Bethel Gresham. The other two Americans were Private Thomas F Enright, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Private Merle D Hay, Glidden, Iowa. (Source 41, Sons of Men.)\n\nThere is a memorial to Cpl. Gresham at the Indiana War Memorials in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nHugo August Prell, KIA, Meuse-Argonne, Ripley County, Indiana\n\n“Government memorial stone is placed in M. E. Cemetery at Batesville, Ind. The body was not returned but lies in France with a comrade who died instantly with him as they crouched in the same shell-hole.”\n\nDavis J. H. Wagner, Infantry, Ripley County, Indiana\n\n“Was on patrol at one time, with an officer and three more men. We were sent out for information. When trying to get through two-wire entanglements, that were uncut, we had to crawl along in front of it, as we could not get through. We had not gone far when the Germans spotted us and threw five grenades among the patrol, one of them hitting the Lieutenant on the leg, tearing it off, and one-piece hitting myself on the head. The other fellows ran and I stayed with the Lieutenant and carried him in. It was for this action I was cited. (Specific citation not listed, but the reference made to DSC file).\n\nWilliam Norris Ocheltree. Infantry, Connersville,Fayette County, Indiana\n\nAssignment to mess officer and Belgian Camp necessitated the organization of 22 kitchens, large enough to feed 1000 men at each kitchen. Being thrown into a responsible position and upon his own resources to a certain extent, the writer had to develop the organization in such a way as to be ready to feed 22,000 men on a few hours notice. This was accomplished only by the selection of a highly efficient corps of noncommissioned officers, upon whom the real work devolved and unto whom the credit of success achieved is due. In fact, it was the writer's experience that the success of the American army was due to the intelligence and diligence of its NCOs.\n\nSgt Victor Carleton Lee, Co. H, 355th Inf, 89th Div, KIA,Orange County, Indiana\n\nDistinguished Service Cross: Sergeant Lee, was one of six to succeed in crossing the river Meuse on a voluntary reconnaissance mission in enemy territory, despite heavy artillery, hand grenade & machine-gun fire, & immediately thereafter made the supreme sacrifice.\n\nClinton Meister, Infantry, AEF, Ripley County, Indiana\n\n“Drove to the front at night with food and ammunition. Were shelled by enemy almost every trip. Out of 156 men in the company, however, lost only two, one gassed, one with influenza. During the day was located five or six miles from the firing lines aimed to keep out of range of shells. Airplane located them from time to time and signaled the artillery. Drove through field detours as all roads were constantly shelled and dangerous. Also badly torn up by the shelling, holes depending in size, upon the size of shells used by the enemy. In one retreat the Germans left two horses and a mule in a stable at Brancourt which were taken over by the Americans.”\n\nFloyd Dillon Holmes, Co, D, 125th Inf.,KIA, Grant County, Indiana\n\nCorporal Holmes’ body was buried by his comrades on the battlefield and near the spot he was killed. Several months later it was removed to the American Cemetery at Seringes-et-Nesle, Aisne, near Fere-en-Tardenois, France. His grave is #144, Plot #3, Section R.\n\nThe commanding officer, Co. D., 125th Infantry, in a letter to a relative of Corporal Holmes, stated that he died in the Field of Honor and while engaging in the performance of his military duties, also the commanding officer and the members of this company, extend you and the members of Corporal Holmes family, their deepest sympathy and constantly bear in mind the remembrance of one of their most loved and respected non-commissioned officers.\n\nLater, relatives of Corporal Holmes also received a letter from General John J. Pershing, commander-in-chief of the American Expeditionary Forces, in which he expressed his sympathy and stated that “Corporal Holmes died bravely in the line of duty on the Field of honor.”\n\nAmos George Wesler, Musician,Ripley County\n\n“The 112th Infantry Band won a contest with three other infantry bands of the 28th Division in the first week of March 1919 and was sent to Monte Carlo for two weeks as compensation.

My first time in the trenches was October 14th, 1918 in the Verdun Sector.

Hospitalized in Beaumont, France: lower limbs burnt.\n\n“This soldier’s memory seems to be affected so that his record is somewhat vague and uncertain. It doesn't seem that he could have been assigned to the 30th Division. He was surely assigned to the 84th Division.”\n\nRobert E.

I have been in many of them, as scarcely a night passes but that we see battles in the air. Just now as I write there is real excitement outside. Some of the experiences I've been through have made the outcome for the time seemed doubtful. There are several boys here with me now, and they are making a remarkable showing for themselves.\n\nAfter the event I went in a mopping up party, and we went through miles of an underground tunnel. I buried several little German boys, seemingly not more than 15 years of age, and we found several of them chained to machine guns. We found a crematory where the Germans cut up their own dead, and use the grease for their high explosives.\" It was a gruesome spectacle of which only the eye can get a fair conception.
