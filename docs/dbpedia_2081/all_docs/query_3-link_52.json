        "text": "Battle of Sharpsburg, or Antietam\n\nThe regiment was reduced to 40 men. Colonel Stuart was forced to give up command due to illness, leaving Captain John McPhail in command. The men were employed as skirmishers supporting the Washington Artillery. Captain McPhail and 7 enlisted men were wounded.\n\nFrom the War Department marker to Garnett’s Brigade on the Antietam battlefield:\n\nGarnett’s Brigade reached Sharpsburg at 11 A.M. September 15th, and took position on the southwest slope of Cemetery Hill where it remained until the morning of the 17th, when it relieved Geo. T. Anderson’s Brigade in support of the Washington Artillery. When that command was relieved by S. D. Lee’s Artillery in the afternoon, the Brigade advanced into the cornfield in front of Lee’s guns, between this point and the cemetery wall, and engaged the right of the advancing Federal line.\n\nThe right of the Confederate line west of the Burnside Bridge Road being turned, the Brigade was withdrawn, by the cross streets, to the north of the town, and cooperated with Drayton’s Brigade and A.P. Hill’s Division in the attack on the Federal left.\n\nBattle of Gettysburg\n\nThe regiment was commanded by Colonel William D. Stuart and brought 289 men to the field. It was part of Pickett’s Charge on July 3, sustaining heavy casualties. The regiment lost 51 men killed, 72 wounded, and 76 missing or captured. Colonel Stuart was mortally wounded, and died in a hospital in Staunton, Virginia. Lieutenant Colonel Philip P. Slaughter took over command from Stuart.\n\nCasualties were heavy among the officers. Lieutenants William A. Blick, Robert S. Ellis, William E. Jones, and Joseph H. Smith were killed. Captain James C. Wyantt and Lieutenant John T. Burton were mortally wounded and captured. Captain Charles J. Clarke and Lieutenant Mathew Brown were wounded, and Lieutenants Stephen D. Cronin, Ira A. Miller, and Henry C. Mitchie were wounded and captured. Captains Joseph D. Frazer, John W. Jones of Company B and John P. Jones of Company D, Lieutenants Francis C. Barnes, George W. Finley, Jacob R. Rudisill and Assiatant Surgeon B.C. Harrison were captured.\n\nFrom the marker on the Gettysburg battlefield:\n\nJuly 2. Arrived about sunset and bivouacked on the western border of Spangler’s Woods.\n\nJuly 3. In the forenoon formed line on Kemper’s left in the field east of the woods. At the cessation of the cannonade advanced and took part in Longstreet’s assault on the Union position in the vicinity of the Angle. This advance was made in good order under a storm of shells and grape and a deadly fire of musketry after passing the Emmitsburg Road. The lines were much broken in crossing the post and rail fences on both sides of that road but with shattered ranks the Brigade pushed on and took part in the final struggle at the Angle. Gen. R. B. Garnett fell dead from his saddle in front of the stone wall.\n\nJuly 4. Spent the day in reorganization and during the night began the march to Hagerstown."
