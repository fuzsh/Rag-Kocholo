        "text": "A familiar comment on women is poetically but succinctly written in the King James Bible:\n\n“But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.” St Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians.\n\nAppropriately Paul always struck me as a typical male chauvinist and the Catholic Church, which prizes his writings, has remained a bastion of male dominance. But the pre-occupation with women’s hair and what it may represent runs through many cultures and innumerable art works. And this is as true of cinemas as it is of other mediums. What first set me thinking of this as a motif was a double screening on a Sunday afternoon at the old ‘little bit Ritzy’ in Brixton. This consisted of Nuts (Warner Bros. 1987) and Mortal Thoughts (Columbia Pictures 1991). In both films a woman suffers a rape: in parallel in Nuts this is followed by Claudia Draper (Barbra Streisand) and in Mortal Thoughts by Cynthia Kellogg (Demi Moore) cutting her hair. Another example would in The Accused (Paramount Pictures 1988) where Sarah Tobias (Jody Foster) also cuts her hair after she has been raped.\n\nThere are many tropes representing women’s hair on film but a number recur very often and would seem to have a metaphoric sense. The cutting of a woman’s hair is found in other art forms, some of which presumably had an influence of cinema. in ‘Le Rouge et le Noir’ (1830) a young woman cuts her hair as a sign of defiance. A famous example in a novel adapted a number of times on film is ‘Jane Eyre’ (1847) where cutting hair is a punishment and accompanies the covering of girl’s hair in the name of religious morals. A later example is ‘For Whom the Bells Toll’ (1940) where a young woman is imprisoned, brutalised and raped by the fascist military and also has her head shaved.\n\nHaircuts – trauma\n\nFor Whom the Bells Toll, USA 1943\n\nA studio production that broadly follows the novel but which was cut on release. Robert (Gary Cooper) is an irregular with the Spanish Republican army during the 1930s Civil War. He is sent on a mission behind enemy lines to liaise with a guerrilla group. There he meets María who was the victim of a fascist rape and who has cut her hair extremely short.\n\nHiroshima Mon Amour, France 1959\n\nEmmanuelle Riva as Elle (“Her”) has a brief affair with Eiji Okada as Lui (“Him”) whilst working on a film in Hiroshima. The film recreates events marking the bombing of the city by the USA [with British assistance] with a nuclear device and the subsequent horrific devastation. Elle recounts in flashback a wartime romance with a German soldier, part of the occupation forces in her native France. She also recounts how, when the war ended, she was punished by the local people, including having her hair brutally cut. Here the actual hair cut is the trauma.\n\nHandgun, Britain 1983 [filmed in USA]\n\nKathleen (Karen Young) is raped at gunpoint by Larry (Clayton Day). She cuts her hair but also takes lessons in gun skills to exact revenge. The film was cut under orders from the Production Company, EMI.\n\nNuts 1987\n\nStreisand plays Claudia Draper who is on trial for the murder of a client. In the investigation Claudia’s back ground emerges including molestation by her father, Arthur Draper (Karl Malden).\n\nThe Accused, 1988\n\nJodie Foster plays Sarah who is gang-raped by three men in a bar, cheered on by other men. Her response is to cut her hair very short. The film details how she attempts to obtain justice; this includes a fictional US law used in court\n\nMortal Thoughts, 1991\n\nDemi Moore plays Cynthia Kellog who works at a hairdressing salon run by her friend Joyce Urbanski (Glenne Headley). She kills Joyce’s husband “Jimmy” when he attempts to rape her. What actually happened only becomes clear in flashbacks as the police investigate.\n\nAnna Karenina 1997 USA\n\nAn adaptation of the novel by Tolstoy. Anna (Sophie Marceau) has her hair is cut during the fever that follows her miscarriage of the child fathered by Count Vronsky (Sean Bean).\n\nWater Canada / India 2005\n\nSet in 1938 under British colonial rule Chuyia (Sarala Kariyawasam) is only eight and married. When her husband dies she is forced to enter a widows’ ashram; and her hair is cut and her head shaved. Later she is a victim of prostitution. Another inmate Kalyani (Lisa Ray) has also been prostituted. When she attempts to marry she is locked up and her head is shaved. Later, she commits suicide.\n\nEsme’s secret / Esma’s secret Bosnia-Herzogovina 2006\n\nSet following the Balkan war Esma (Mirjana Karanovic) and her teenage daughter Sara (Luna Mijovic). Late in the film Sara discovers that her father was not a dead ‘shaheed’, [Bosnian mujahideen fighter]; and that she was conceived after her mother suffered multiple rapes by Serbian soldiers. Sara shaves her hair when she discovers this. The original title ‘Grbavica’ means ‘woman with a hump’.\n\nFour Minutes / Vier Minuten Germany, 2006\n\nJenny (Hannah Herzsprung) is a convict in a prison who receives piano lessons from an elderly music teacher, Gertrud (Monica Bleibtreu). We learn via flashbacks that Jenny suffered abuse as a child and that Gertrud was tortured during the war by an SS Officer, who cut her hair before a planned execution which was not carried out.\n\nThe Wind That Shakes the Barley, Irreland / Britain 2006\n\nSet during the Ireland’s War of Independence. Sinéad Ní Shúilleabháin (Orla Fitzgerald) is a member of the nationalist Cumann na mBan [The Women’s Council]. In retaliation for an ambush of British military the family home irs raided and burnt by Black and Tans [British military auxilaries) and Sinéad’s hair is brutally cut with what looks like a pair of garden shears.\n\nThe Wall / Die Wand, Austria / Germany 2012\n\nThe film is adapted from a novel by Marlen Haushofer published in 1963. A woman, (Die Frau – Martina Gedeck), accompanies two friends with their dog Lynx [Luchs in the novel] to a hunting lodge in the Austrian Alps. The friends go to a nearby village leaving the woman and the dog, a Weimaraner, at the lo0dge. When they fail to return she tries to find them but finds that she is trapped by an invisible glass wall; the apparent wall covers large area including an alpine pasture. Deprived of human contact the woman sets about survival, her only companion, Lynx, later joined by a cow Bella and a stray cat which delivers a kitten, Pearl. She survives like this for three years; with Lynx her\n\n“”only friend in a world of troubles and loneliness”—always happy to see her.”\n\nThen tragedy strikes. Whilst up at the pasture she finds a strange man who kills Bella’s calf and then Lynx; she shoots the man, rolls his corpse over a cliff and then buries Lynx. Left alone back at the lodge she cuts her hair; a sign of the trauma. She then finishes a report that she has been writing as her various types of paper run out.\n\nA girl at my door / Dohee-ya South Korea 2014\n\nYoung-nam (Bae Doona) is a police officer transferred to the command of a small seaside village; her misconduct is an affair with a fellow woman officer. She comes across Do Hee (Kim Sae-ron) a young girl who has suffered abuse from her step father. Do Hee at one point cuts her hair.\n\nAn Impossible Love / Un amour impossible, France 2018\n\nRachel (Virginie Efira) has a brief affair with Philippe (Niels Schneider). Rachel becomes pregnant but Philippe refuses to marry her and |Rachel raises the daughter Chantal (Ambre Hasaj as Chantal at 3–5 years old: Sasha Alessandri-Torrès Garcia as Chantal at 6–8 years old: Estelle Lescure as Chantal in adolescence). Philippe, who marries, continues to see Chantal. Later, with Chantal an adult (Jenny Beth) Rachel and we learn that she was sodomized from when she was a young girl by Philippe and in her teens cut her shoulder length hair.\n\nNomadland (2020), a sort of US road movie. Fern (Frances McDormand} leaves her home town in Nevada after it is devastated by economic downturn. Se sets off and for a time becomes part of a nomadic group, living on the road, with itinerant work and an alterntive life style. Early in the film an erstwhile neighbout remarks that Fern has cut her hair and we also learn that she lost her husband.\n\nThe Rhythm Section, USA 2020\n\nStephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) is a traumatised young woman working as a prostitute. Her hair is short, likely cut by herself. Flashbacks reveal her family of five were killed in a plane accident; also that prior to this Stephanie had long hair. Learning that the plane crash was due to terrorists Stephanie sets out on a trail of vengeance.\n\nLynn and Lucy, Britain 2020\n\nSchool hood friends who are both married with a child. Lucy’s child dies in suspicious circumstances. Her husband is arrested. The neighbours blame Lucy and she is ostracised. Insults are painted on her car and the house. Lynn gradually comes to believe Lucy is responsible. Lucy calls in at the hair salon where Lynn works and demands she cuts her hair. Lynn cuts it short [similar to The Accused] including most of her hair dyed purple. Lucy leaves and later commits suicide.\n\nLa Civil (2021) is an international production set in Mexico; now notorious for gang violence and kidnapping. In the feature Cielo (Arcelia Ramirez), a single mother, is shocked when her daughter Laura (Claudia Goytia) is kidnapped by cartel members. Laura has long and luxurious hair. Cielo’s is usually tied back but when loose hangs past her shoulders. Her husband, Gustavo (Álvaro Guerrero), who has left her for a younger woman, is initially not very helpful; and the same is true of the police and authorities. The cartel members demand and receive a ransom but do not release Laura. Cielo sets outs on a dangerous search for her daughter. Well into what is a long drama Gustavo has retunred to the family home when his young mistress left him. At night Cielo retunrs home, now fairly certain that Laura is dead. She cuts her hair shorter rather than short. Gustavo says he likes it and that it is the shortest it has ever been. Cielo tells him it was shorter before she met him. By the end of the story Laura’s DNA has been identified among the remains in a mass grave.\n\nMothering Sunday 2021\n\nThis is a British period drama. It was made digitally and is in colour and the less common 1.66:1 aspect ratio. It has a complex flashback structure; the story is told from the viewpoint of the present but this is only apparent half-way through the movie. The movie is based on a novel by Graham Swift; the novel seems to make more of reading fiction and literary influences. Moreover in the movie and, possibly in the book, not all the characters’ backstories are clealry set out; leading to a number of ambiguities.\n\nThe central character is Jane (Odessa Young) who is actually a writer in the 1930s. However, the novel she is writing has herself as the central chcracter. This Jane is in service in a substantial upper-middle class home, the Niven family, in the 1920s. The Sunday in question is in 1924 when the most dramatic events occur. This day the Niven’s meet with their friends the Hobdays and the Sheringhams. The Hobday daughter Emma (Emma D’Arcy) was engaged to the Niven’s son David who died in World War I. Now Emma is engaged to Paul Sheringham (Josh O’Connor); his family is even wealthier with an even larger mansion. But Jane is having a secret affair with Paul and meets him surreptionsly at the mansion on this Sunday for sex.\n\nWe see Jane, with a day off from service, cycling to meet Paul. Her hair, with long strands, is tied up but she loosens it as she cycles; a sign of freedom from service as well as the forthoming sexual encounter. Intriguingly in a flashback we see the meeting where Jane loses her viginity to Paul; though here her hair is still tied up. It appears that their sexual activity started as a paid service.\n\nAs the drama suggest Paul is killed in an accident driving to join the families’ luncheon. Jane returning to the family home has to accompany the senior Niven [Colin Firth} to take the news to the Sheringham mansion.\n\nIn another flashback we see Jane working in a bookshop and starting to write her novel, which is, at least in part, based on her own experience of being in service. She meets Donald (Sope Dirisu) and the two set up together. Donald is African or African Caribbean; Swift’s novel brings in Joseph Conrad, which may explain this but not so in the movie. Here Jane’s hair is loose but in a different style from the Jane in service. Sadly for Jane Donald dies from a brain tumour.\n\nNeither following the death of Paul in the novel nor following the death of Donald do we see Jane cut her hair. However, at the movies’ end, we see the now older Jane (Glenda Jackson) meeting the press after her novel/s win a literary prize. Her hair is now cut short; presumably cut some time after the death of Donald.\n\nDrift (2023) is a multi-territory production set in Greece and in English and Greek [with some subtitles]; it is based on a novel ‘A Marker to Measure Drift’ by Alexander Maksik and he worked on the screenplay. Jacqueline (Cybthia Erivo) is a African illegal migrant on a small Greek island. She wanders around making money on the beach, hiding out at night in antique ruins but clealry trying to come to terms with a severe trauma. Flashbacks fill in part of her story which includes her affluent home and family in Liberia and studies in london and a relationhip there with Helen (Honor Swinton Byrne).\n\nShe is befriended by a US woman, Callie (Alia Shawcat) and the pair bond. Finally, she is able to recount her trauma to Callie, [presented in another flashback) when her family is murdered by a gang and both Jacqueline and her sister raped, the latter also killed. This takes place in one of Liberia’s civil wars, but not dated\n\nIn the present Jacqueline has closely cropped hair; in the flashbacks she has long luxuriant beaded locks. It is not clear in the film whether the gang has shaved her hair or that she has done this after the massacre.\n\nHaircuts – change and/or defiance\n\nHis Majesty the Barber / Hans Kingl, Höghet Shinglar / Majestät Scheidet Bubiköpfe, 1928 Sweden / Denmark\n\nThis is a ‘Ruritarian’ romantic comedy. The barber is André Gregory (Hans Junkermann) in a small Swedish town. His supposed grandson is Nickolo (Enrique Rivero), possibly the heir to throne of Tirania. He is attracted to Astrid (Brita Appelgren), granddaughter of wealthy Sophie (Karin Swanström). Nickolo is an expert in the shingle and the bob; both fashionable styles for women in the period. At one point Nickolo visits Sophie’s castle to cut hair, but Sophie interrupts his hair styling of Astrid. Annoyed and resistant Astrid cuts a lock of her own hair. Intriguingly whilst we see three different women having haircuts there is only one male customer to the barber shop; he is being shaved and walks out before this is completed.\n\nThe Nun’s Story, USA 1959\n\nGabrielle (Audrey Hepburn) leaves the secular world, [and a young suitor], to enter an order of nursing sisters and life in a Catholic convent. When she takes her vows as Sister Luke she is required to have her hair cut and to henceforth wear the restrictive and veiled nun’s attire. This is both a sign of renuinciation but also of commitment.\n\nJane Eyre (1996) Helen Burns (Leanne Rowe) poses for a drawing by Jane (Anna Paquin) who loosens her hair. Spotted by Mr Brocklehurst (John Wood). Helen is stood in the centre and Jane is sent for scissors. Standing alongside Helen Jane loosens her hair and both girls bow in a flamboyant gesture that sends their hair flailing. Earlier versions also feature the cutting of hair as found in the original novel.\n\nElizabeth (1998), a joint production by Polygram, Working Title and Channel Four Films. It is, supposedly, a biopic of the early years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth of England. Wikipedia has an extended paragraph on the many historical inaccuracies. It is worth noting that the director, Shekhar Kapur, previously made Bandit Queen (1994), a biopic of Phoolan Devi, a famous outlaw in India. That film was roundly criticised by some for inaccuracies and exploitation of her story.\n\nIn this drama of England’s first Queen Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) we see and hear her ascension to the throne and her early years as monarch. She has to face potential ursurpers, rebellion, attenpted assasination and religions conflicts. Her key adviser, William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley (Richard Attenborough) constantly pressures her to make a politically expedient marriage. But his replacement, Francis Walsingham (Geffrey Rush), advises her as they stand by a statue of the Virgin Mary, that she needs to become an iconic figure for the nation.\n\nIn the following scene Elizabeth’s ladies-in-waiting cut her hair and paste on make-up to achieve a statue like appearance, recorded in a number of famous portraits. Presenting herself to her courtiers Elisabeth tells Burghley ‘I am married to England’.\n\nEnfants du Siécle / Children of the Century 1999 France / Britain\n\nThe film records the affair between George Sand (Juliet Binoche) and Alfred de Musset (Benoit Magimel). Sands cuts her hair after the parting with Musset.\n\nCoco before Chanel / Coco avant Chanel 2009 France\n\nThis biopic follows Coco’s career before she becomes Chanel, the famous fashion designer. Played by Audrey Tatou Coco has a varied and at time difficult career in various jobs and also a number of sexual liaisons. Her early design work is for her friend the actress Émilienne d’Alençon played by Emanuelle Devos. When she opens her first salon we also see that she has cut her hair short; “A woman who cuts her hair is about to change her life.”\n\nSarah’s Key / Elle s’appelait Sarah, France 2010\n\nJulia (Kristen Scott Thomas) investigates the tragic story of Jewish children who suffered in the round-up of Jews by the French police and French Secret Service. The key is for the door were a child is hidden who subsequently dies. His sister Sarah (Mélusine Mayance as young Sarah: Charlotte Poutrel as adult Sarah) is stricken with guilt. Unravelling the story is complex but finally Julia has it complete. She also finds, unexpectedly, that she is pregnant. Her husband involved in an affair with another women, leaves her and their existing daughter. After the divorce is complete Julia cuts her hair.\n\nWonderstruck, 2017 USA\n\nRose (Millicent Simmonds) is one of two children and stories. hers is set in 1927. Living in her father’s home in New Jersey she sets of to find her mother, an actress. Before doing so she cuts her hair.\n\nLittle Women, USA 2019\n\nIn this adaptation of the Civil War story Jo (Saoirse Ronan) cuts her hair to sell for 25 dollars so that her mother can afford a train ticket to travel to Washington to see her husband and the father of the sisters. Whilst Jo dismisses the cut as not important later we see her crying on stairs with sister Beth (Eliza Scanlen). The father is absent for nearly the whole film, told in flashback. The story is one of female emancipation, mainly in the character of Jo.\n\nHair up and down– sexuality\n\nInspector Calls, An Britain 1954\n\nInspector [Alistair Sims] calls on a family to seek out reason for death of young woman. In flashbacks we see her with [among others] the fiancée who set her up as a mistress; her hair is up? Then the son who picks her up in the street; shot of girl by window with hair down, ringlets.\n\nAnatomy of a Muirder, USA 1959\n\nLawyer Paul Biegler (james Stewart) defends Lt. Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) on a murder charge. Frederick claims the killing was in response to the rape of his wife Laura (Lee Remick). During the trial the prosecution lawyer Claude Dancer (George C. Scott) tries to suggest that Laura was flirtatious and provocative to other men. When Laura appears on the witness stand Paul has her dressed decorously and with her hair up under a hat. Challenged by Claude Paul invites Laura to display her hair which she does with aplomb, full hair of ‘glory’,\n\nThe Virgin Spring, Sweden 1960\n\nA revenge movie. Töre (Max Von Sydow) has a daughter Karin (Birgitta Pettersson) who is raped and he kills the perpetrators’. Karin rides to church on Sunday; when her mother tries to tie her hair back with a ribbon Karin objects and wears her hair pinned in two locks. The rape is observed by serving girl Ingen (Gunnel Lindblom) who carries an illegitimate child and wears her hair loose throughout.\n\nDeer Hunter, the USA 1978\n\nReturning from Vietnam Michael (Robert de Niro) has a liaison with Linda (Meryl Streep) who lets her hair down before joining Michael in bed at the motel.\n\nThe Midwife (Sage Femme, Curiosa Films, France 3 Cinéma, 2017) centres on Claire (Catherine Frot) as the midwife of the title and her relationship with terminally ill Béatrice (Catherine Deneuve). Béatrice was once the mistress of Claire’s father and when she left him he committed suicide. Her function in the relationship is to motivate Claire’s freeing-up from her repressed and irritable persona. In the course of this Claire develops a relationship with Paul (Olivier Gourmet), truck driver who also works a plot in the local allotment. However, the changes in her hair style from its usual pony tail are mainly occasioned by Béatrice. At her behests she visits am acquaintance to borrow money and accepts a drink of liqueur: normally she eschews alcohol. Later in Béatrice’s apartment she tries on her lipstick and perfume and then lets her hair hang loose. A little later she loosens it again as she meets up with Paul, a meeting that leads to sex in the allotment shed. Claire again lets her hair down in further sexual scenes with Oliver, but also, and more notable, as she lies with Béatrice on the bed in her apartment watching slides of her father, Antoine. Thus in this film the loosening of the hair signals a liberation occasioned by a friendship with another woman.\n\nOnly You Britain 2019\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Elena (Laia Costa), 35, meets Jake (Josh O’Connor), 26, on the way home. They return to her flat where both talk avoiding and the obvious attraction . Sitting on couch Elena unpicks her hair from top-knot. Then, embarrassed, she goes to the toilet where she pins he hair back up. Later during sex her hair is loose again.\n\nMen’s hair cut – related to religious rituals but also homophobia.\n\nThe Ancient Law, Germany 1920\n\nBaruch (Ernst Deutsch) is the son of an orthodox rabbi in a small shteli [Yiddish term for the small towns with predominantly Ashkenazi Jewish populations in late C9th Eastern Europe]. Against family opposition he goes to Vienna to become an actor. After seeing the director of the theatre and realising the prejudice that exists he returns to his room and cuts off his traditional locks.\n\nKnock On Any Door, USA 1949\n\nThis drama takes issue with capital punishment through the story of one delinquent. John Derek plays Nick ‘pretty boy’ Romano charged with murder and defended by Andrew Morton (Humphrey Bogart). Morton is partly motivated by guilt as his law firm did not defend Romano effectively in an earlier misdemeanour. The motif of hair appears when Romano, found guilty and sentenced, is escorted from his cell to the death chamber. The film’s director Nicholas Ray and the cinematographer Burnett Guffey present a reverse long shot as Romano and guards walk slowly to the death chamber; and clearly visible on the top of Romano’s head is a small shaved patch where the head cap of the electric chair mechanism will be fitted. The condemned person’s legs and head are shaved for the execution.\n\nRomano’s nickname of ‘pretty boy’ is relevant here. Throughout the film he is presented as a good looking youth with, in particular, a fine head of hair. He constantly smooths the hair back with his hand and there is a sense of the feminine in his actions and in his nick name. In the final shot, as ‘The End’ starts to roll, he once more smooths his hair over the shaved patch. In this particular shot the shaved portion of the head resembles a tonsure; the religious hair shave.\n\nEarlier in the film Romano had said that one should\n\n“Live fast, die young, and have a good-looking corpse.”\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai, Britain / USA 1957\n\nAt the climax, as the characters prepare for the opening of the bridge, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) prepares to commit hara-kiri [seppuku – ritual suicide). He cuts a tuft of hair and wraps it in a letter; presumably to his family.\n\nSummer of Sam, USA 1999\n\nSet in 1977 when the ’44 caliber [serial] killer’ caused a panic in new York. The main characters live in an Italian-American neighbourhood. One of these is Ritchie (Adrien Brody), who is gay and affects a punk style of hair and dress. At the film’s climax he is attacked by a macho gang led by Joey T (Michael Rispoli) including having his punk hair style shorn.\n\nThe Road to Guantánamo, 2006 Britain\n\nThe film is a record of the rendition and incarceration of three British citizens, ‘The Tipton Three’, first in Afghanistan, and then at the U.S. Guantánamo Base. Among the violence and torture inflicted on them they have their head hair shaved. This particular action appears in a number of movies representing the U.S. ‘war on terror’. Here it would seem to be mainly a punishment; but it needs to be noted that at Guantánamo, and indeed in Abu Ghraib, the violence involves sexual torture and rape.\n\nManusangada, 2017 India [Tamil]\n\nKolapan (Rajeev Anand) returns home when his father dies. The family struggle to arrange a burial due to Brahmin prejudice against Dalits. Finally when the funeral is arranged, Kolapan’s hair is shaved as part of the funeral rites.\n\nMonster, 2023 Japan (Kaibutsu).\n\nThis is another fine drama by Kore-eda Hirokazu and features his continuing concerns with family and children. The narrative is presented in three segments which provide a take on the same events from the viewpoints of the three central characters: a single mother Mugino Saori (Andō Sakura): her son in fifth grade Mugino Minato (Kurokawa Sōya): and his school teacher Michitoshi Hori (Nagayama Eita). The film opens with the a series of events as experienced by Saori who believes her son is being mistreated at school by Hori: Hori’s flashback shows that the events are more complicated than they seem, partly complicated by Japanese mores and customs: whilst finally the flashback from Minato’s viewpoint shows that the problems have arisen from his friendship with a fellow pupil, Hoshikawa Yori (Hiiragi Hinata), who is abused by his father but bullied by his classmates. The latter causes Minato to try and keep the friendship secret and the relationship seems likely to be considered outside the social norms. In the opening segment there is the discovery by Saori that Minato has been cutting his own hair; this is expanded in the two flashbacks. And the cutting of his own hair, along with other behaviour that seems odd, is due to the tramaus surrounding his friendship.\n\nVariations\n\nAn interesting example occurs in the USA/Canadian title Arrival ((2016). Louise (Amy Adams) is a linguist, is recruited by the US military to help in establishing communications with aliens who have appeared in a futuristic spaceship; the question of language is central to the story. The complexities of the plot includes flashbacks and flashfowards, though it takes time to identify how these work. In what is the present for most of the narrative Louise has her hair tied back. In some future sequences, with a husband and a daughter, it hangs loose. But the most intriguing sequence is in what we think is the present; as the climax approaches, [different from the source short story], Louise enter the space ship alone, for the first time. We see her in a cloud of mist wheeling and tumbling as if in a linguistic orgasm; and her is loose and also tumbling. The sequence is reminsicent of the sexual scene in the earlier The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976).\n\nOne the promising highlights for 2020 was the Locarno Film Festival’s intention to screen a retrospective of the work of Japanese actor and director Tanaka Kinuyo. I have long been a fan of this talented and pioneering film-maker so I was working on plans to be able to attend. The arrival of the pandemic torpedoed this prospect. However, the Locarno Festival postponed the retrospective to 2021. Now, whilst only a possibility, there was a prospect of being able to enjoy this programme of films in the summer; 35 titles including a large number in 35mm prints.\n\n“Locarno to fete Japan’s Kinuyo Tanaka in first retrospective devoted to female film-maker.\n\nThe Locarno Film Festival will celebrate the work of Japanese director and actress Kinuyo Tanaka at its upcoming 73rd edition (August 5-15), in its first ever retrospective dedicated to a female artist.\n\nTanaka (1909 –1977) was a pioneering figure in Japanese cinema throughout her 50-year career, appearing in the films of legendary directors Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi before striking off to direct her own films.\n\nThis is the first time that the festival will be dedicating its retrospective to a female director, after 73 years,” said Locarno Film Festival artistic director Lili Hinstin, who is embarking on her second edition at the helm.\n\nAt the same time, she added, it also raised the question of how an artist like Tanaka – with such “an original and exciting filmography” had been overlooked for so long.\n\nTanaka first rose to fame in the 1920s, initially working under contract for the Shochiku Film Company, the film department of which is celebrating its centenary this year. There, she collaborated with Japan’s best-known “modernist” directors such as Heinosuke Gosho, Ozu and Hiroshi Shimizu.\n\nIn the years immediately after World War Two and the 1950s, her striking screen presence became a hallmark of some of the best work by directors of the golden age of Japanese cinema, including Keisuke Kinoshita, Mikio Naruse and Kaneto Shindo.\n\nShe also renewed her collaboration with Ozu but her most important artistic partnership was with Mizoguchi, with whom she made 14 films, including the 1952 drama The Life Of Oharu (Saikaku ichidai onna), which premièred at the Venice Film Festival, winning Best International Film.\n\nAround this time, Tanaka also started going behind the camera to direct a number of films of her own with various studios. At the time, she was only the second women in the history of Japanese cinema to direct after Tazuko Sakane.\n\nLocarno described her six features films as “innovative portraits of women’s roles and conditions in the changing social environment of modern Japan”. The retrospective will screen Tanaka’s complete filmography as a director as well as a selection of 250-odd films in which she appeared..” (Melanie Goodfellow, 23rd January 2020).\n\nThen a friend informed me of the bad news; set about in a report in ‘Screen Daily’:\n\n“The Locarno Film Festival will turn the spotlight on the work of late Italian director Alberto Lattuada for the retrospective of its 74th edition, scheduled to run from August 4- 14 this year.\n\nThe programme is the first element of Locarno’s 74th edition to be unveiled by the festival’s newly appointed artistic director Giona A. Nazzaro.\n\nPlans have been dropped for a retrospective celebrating the work of Japanese director and actress Kinuyo Tanaka, which was announced by Nazzaro’s predecessor Lili Hinstin for last year’s cancelled edition as the festival’s first-ever retrospective dedicated to a female artist.\n\nRegarding the decision to cancel the Kinuyo Tanaka retrospective, a spokesperson for the festival said: “The programme was a personal choice of [former artistic director] Lili Hinstin. Therefore, in respect to her work and despite it is a great programme, we have decided to propose another author to our audience for the next edition of the festival.”\n\nMy thoughts are best summed up by a borrowing from Oscar Wilde:\n\n“To lose one female artist, dear festival, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness.”\n\nI also realised how fortunate I was that in 2012 we had a small but very fine retrospective at the Leeds International Film Festival of the work of Tanaka Kinuyo both as an actor and as a film director; the majority on 35mm film. So I am revisiting my reports from that Festival. Note, there is much plot detail on the individual films; whilst quotations are taken from the English sub-titles in the prints.\n\n“Retrospective of legendary Japanese actress and filmmaker Kinuyo Tanaka\n\nRetrospectives has an especially strong selection this year. The ‘special focus’ is a profile of the Japanese actress and filmmaker Tanaka Kinuyo. She worked through several different periods of Japanese film and with three of its greatest masters, Kenji Mizoguchi, Mikio Naruse and Yasujiro Ozu. Her scene at the end of Sansho Dayu (1954) is one of the most sublime endings in World Cinema. She was also a pioneer woman direction in the Industry. There are five of her films, all in either 35 or 16mm, in the retrospective. And there is a workshop on November 3rd at the Centre for World Cinemas at the University of Leeds.\n\n“Our second film retrospective announced for LIFF 26 is dedicated to legendary Japanese actress, and filmmaker, Kinuyo Tanaka (1909-77). While Kinuyo Tanaka is widely recognised as one of the greatest actresses in the history of her nation’s cinema, a lesser known fact is that she was also the first Japanese woman to build a body of work as a filmmaker in her own right. The retrospective aims to remedy this by screening The Eternal Breasts and Girls of Dark, two of Kinuyo Tanaka’s rarely-screened directorial works, both presented on archive 35mm prints imported from Japan. These two films will be accompanied by a selection of her finest performances in films by three of the masters of Japanese cinema: Kenji Mizoguchi (Sansho the Bailiff, 35mm print), Yasujiro Ozu (A Hen in the Wind, imported 16mm print) and Mikio Naruse (Mother, imported 35mm print). The retrospective, to be screened at the Hyde Park Picture House, will both celebrate and shed new light on the career of a figure of significant importance to world cinema history. The retrospective is curated by Michael Smith and is supported by the Japan Foundation and the Mixed Cinema Network/Centre for World Cinemas, University of Leeds.”\n\nI wanted to record some overall comments on the retrospective of this Japanese actress and filmmaker at this year’s Leeds International Film Festival. I had been fortunate enough to see a few of the films in which she starred at Festivals and in other retrospective. But the five films featured in Leeds showed her working as an actress with three of the finest filmmakers in Japanese cinema, and then working in her right behind the camera.\n\nEarly on in the Festival there was a workshop on Kinuyo Tanaka at Leeds University. Co-incidentally [or perhaps not as the writer delivered a talk at the workshop} the December 2012 issue of Sight & Sound contained an article by Alex Jacoby on one of her greatest roles, Sansho Dayu (Sansho the Bailiff, 1954). The workshop provided a context and an overview of Tanaka’s career and pointed up some aspects of her work to look out for.\n\nThere was one slight misnomer, as one academic [male] suggested that she was not beautiful in the conventional sense of film stars. I suspect that can be said of a number of my favourite actresses. But when Kinuyo is on screen a sense of beauty is irrelevant. She has a great screen presence. In particular she makes impressive use of her body and her movements. Her positions in scenes and in relation to set and props often accentuate the emotion of a sequence. In her later career, when she often played somewhat tragic roles, one trope was kneeling and leaning slightly askew: displaying the weight of oppression or of the emotional demands on her character.\n\nA Hen in the Wind (Kaze no naka no mendori, 1948)\n\nThis first Leeds Film Festival Retrospective screening was a real pleasure. A fine performance from the lead actress Tanaka Kinuyo: a rare masterwork from director Ozu Yasujiro: and viewed in the fine old auditorium of the Hyde Park cinema. The slight drawback was an old 16mm print, somewhat worn with the image quality rather dark, leading to loss of the film’s definition and its play with the nuances of light and shadow. But it is a remarkable and distinctive melodrama showing Ozu’s mature style in its early days.\n\nThe film centres on the wife and mother Tokiko (Tanaka Kinuyo) with her son Hiroshi. Tokiko’s husband has been away at war and is among the last of the Japanese soldiers to be repatriated. Tokiko and her son are boarders in the household of the Sakai family. She is hard up and post-war prices are high. Then her son is taken ill with a catarrh of the colon. The distraught Tokiko has to find a doctor and then pay for the subsequent hospital care. This leads her into unseemly action in order to raise the money. When her husband returns and he learns of her actions a marital crisis ensues.\n\nOff-screen Tokiko makes money in a brothel. We only learn of this indirectly; however, from the comments and settings we can infer quite explicit aspects of the incident. Tokiko describes it as ‘foolish’ whilst her husband uses the word ‘mistake’.\n\nTanaka’s performance is the centre of the film. And she plays the changing responses and emotions of the wife with an emotional flair, whilst avoiding melodramatic excess. In the latter part of the film the focus shifts to the returned husband Shuichi (Sano Shuji) whose conflicting emotions are played out as he grapples with and then comes to terms with his wife’s tragic ‘mistake’. The strong supporting cast include Tokiko’s friend and confidante Chieko, the Sakai family father (Sakamoto Takeshi) and his wife Tsune (Takamatsu Eiko), a colleague of Shuichi, Satake (the familiar Ryu Chishu) and the most negative character Orie (Mizukami Rieko ).\n\nTanaka presents Tokiko as much through her movement and position as through her delivery and facial expressions. One particular trope in her performance sees her leaning, usually against a set of drawers in her room, displaying at various points the sense of weariness, worry and concern and at potent moments – despair. Shuji, as the husband Shuichi, is at times is tellingly still and passive, as he works through his anger. At other times he is active and even violent. The contrast in styles is very effective.\n\nOzu’s direction offers many familiar tropes found in his later classic films. The low-angle camera: the sequences between scenes of building and objects: the cutting between shot and reverse right down the 180% line. However, the film makes less use of the long takes and long shots that increased in his later years. And there are two exterior tracking shots which stand out in the film. In fact at times there are many relatively short camera shots and relatively rapid cutting. Several times he focuses on a character, mainly Tokiko, in a series of reverse shots. The most powerful is a scene where the now shamed Tokiko regards herself in the mirror, a set of images that vividly convey her feelings. A later scene has a similar set of shots and cuts as she regards a portrait of her absent husband.\n\nThe film has more dramatic moments that are found in later Ozu. In the climatic moments of the film Shuichi throws his wife down and she falls headlong down the stairs. She lies passive, and then obviously in severe pain rises and climbs painfully back up the stairs. She finds her husband once more in a position of angry passivity. As so often in the film he is shot and framed from behind, emphasising the emotional gulf in the scene.\n\nAlex Jacoby commented on this sequence in his presentation at the Workshop’ drawing attention to the rarity of action on staircases in Ozu film but presenting comparisons with staircases in film that Yanak made with other directors.\n\nThe stairs are one of the settings that Ozu returns to with great frequency. Earlier at a moment of anger Shuichi kicks a can and it rolls down the stairs, a premonition of what will follow later.\n\n{Alex Jacoby in his talk at the Workshop presented some sequences from other films starring Tanaka not directed by Ozu. There seems to be an association between Tanaka and stars across these films; whereas seeing someone on a staircase as distinct from at the top or bottom is rare in Ozu.]\n\nEqually Ozu’s frequent exteriors positioned between scenes both place the action but also comment upon the changing story. It may be I missed some relevance in the later films, but these seem to me to carry greater meaning than in those later works. The Sakai house is set near some tanks or gas tanks, which loom large over the streets. At times characters traverse places beyond their small neighbourhood. Tokiko and Chieko share a picnic with Hiroshi on the banks of the river and reminisce about their youth and their dreams for the future. Later Shuichi sits on the bank of the same river and converses with a girl from the brothel – a point at which he can be seen to be coming to terms with his situation and that of his wife. Shuichi had visited the brothel earlier in his driven attempt to discover his wife’s actions. On the way he passes along a dilapidated street and crosses a wasteland covered with industrial piping. And close-up draws attention to a shattered pipe on the ground: a potent symbol of his situation.\n\nMusic is used frequently in the film, but with care and deliberate attention. In one scene Shuichi and Tokiko watch their son play with pleasure, and there is light cheerful music on the soundtrack. In a later scene as Shoichi relentless questions his wife the music is darker with a clearer bass sound. This precedes a scene of marital rape. When Shuichi visits the brothel, which is situated behind a school, we hear the children singing, reminding the girl with whom he converses that she once studied there. At work, where he has returned, he discusses his situation indirectly with his colleague Satake. Next door is a dance studio, or even a brothel. Shuichi finds the ‘jazz’ ‘sad’ whilst his colleagues correctly identifies it as ‘merry’.\n\nOzu also shows his customary attention to objects. A bottle of saké given Tokiko by Tsune is shown several times, once in close-up and then in different positions in the frame. It again speaks volumes regarding the husband. And shortly before the rape (which occurs partly off-screen and in partly implied) a large ball falls to the floor. In the shot following the rape Shuichi sits in a hunched position and the ball is clear in the lower right of the frame.\n\nIn the final moments of the film husband and wife embrace and Tokiko tightens her arms around her husband and her hands lock in an attitude of prayer. David Bordwell comments on this moment, “as in the 1930s films [of Ozu], the male falters, scraping by on good intentions and the strength of his woman . . . ”. This seems a fair assessment of the film’s resolution. It also points up what I find to be a major difference between Ozu and his contemporary Naruse Mikio. In Ozu’s films despite their strength, women continue in their predominately subservient role. In many of Naruse’s films women are unable to continue in such roles, and what is striking is their resilience and determination to soldier on, providing them with a flawed independence. Whilst both directors’ films are frequently referred to as belonging to the genre of shomin geki [stories of the little people] Ozu tends to focus on the strata between the working classes and the bourgeoisie, including the petit bourgeoisie: Naruse’s films are more determinably concerned with the working classes and often the lumpen proletariat. However, A Hen in the Wind shows Ozu working much more closely to the territory occupied by Naruse. This might account for the fact that this is a film which is somewhat, neglected on the Ozu oeuvre. I thought it the equal of his famous films from the 1950s.\n\nOne last point that struck me was there seemed to be little sense of the US occupation, under which this film was produced. There are a few visual references to US popular culture in the flat of Orie, whose manipulation of Tokiko leads to her situation. She comments at one point that there is ‘an easier life’. There are also western references in some of the music, both diegetic and non-diegetic, though the use of western music in common in films of this period. And the workplace of Shuichi and Satake has a large ‘Time Life’ sign emblazoned on it. But there is little else. However, Bordwell refers to a Japanese critic who sees the film as part of a cycle which comments both on the war and the post-war world. With the plight of Tokiko providing metaphors for the pre-war and post-war codes in Japanese society. This seems an apt reading, the best melodramas comment not just on the personal but on the social as well.\n\nNote:- The Japanese title of the film translated into English does not obviously relate to the narrative. I have looked at a number of reviews and commentaries but I found no-one who addressed the issue. Some on-line fans of the film have made their own attempts.\n\nThe first thing the heroin Tokiko did was to sell her wardrobe one by one — she had to pluck her feathers like a hen. Then she had to be plucky and strong in the cold wind.\n\nLiterally, it means “If the hen sings, the home will perish.” Figuratively, it means that if the wife gains more power than the husband, their home will be ruined. – l’électeur Feb 9 ’15 at 14:06\n\nIt is possible that the title was selected by the studio as indicating a generic story; though the title makes more sense in terms of the first comment rather than the second translation..\n\nMother (Okasan, 1952)\n\nThe second screening in the Leeds International Film Festival tribute to Japanese actress Tanaka Kinuyo is a film directed in 1952 by Naruse Mikio. Naruse is one of the outstanding masters of what is often referred to as the ‘golden age’ of Japanese cinema. The film belongs to a popular genre of haha-mono, a ‘mother picture’ which usually deal with the relationships between a mother and her children. Tanaka plays Fukuhara Masako with Misaim Masao as her husband Ryosuke. Her eldest daughter is Toshiko played by Kagawa Kyoto, who can also be seen as the daughter in Sansho Dayu, and who plays the youngest daughter in Ozu Yasujiro’s celebrated Tokyo Story (Tôkyô monogatari, 1953)\n\n. There is an elder son Susumu (Katayama Akihito), a younger daughter Chako (Enonami Keiko) and Tetsu the son of Masako’s widowed sister Noriko (Nakakita Chieko). The other important characters are Uncle Kimura, a family friend (Kato Daisuke, one of the ‘magnificent seven’ in Kurosawa’s famous samurai film) and Shinjiro (Okada Eiji) a friend of Toshiko and son of a local bakery family.\n\nAt one time the Fukuhara family ran a laundry business, destroyed in a fire. Now the father works as a factory guard, but he is also converting the front of the house and plans to re-launch the laundry with help of Kimura. Two bereavements strike down the men of the family. Masako struggles with the laundry, helped by Kimura. Toshiko works at a street food stall, pancakes in winter, popsicle in summer. The economic hardships finally compel Masako to accept help from relatives who adopt Chaco. She continues to care for her sister’s son whilst Noriko works to train and succeed as a hairdresser.\n\nTanaka brings the same reticence but also emotional power that she displayed in A Hen in the Wind. She is able to communicate powerfully with her face, her body and her gestures. At the Festival / University workshop on the actress attention was drawn to her use of gestures before her face: and I noted one striking moment as she faintly touches her shoulder in a moment of reflection. We also learnt about her early career when she as a major young star noted for her ‘pert smile’. In a flashback in this film she recreates that character as she remembers her youthful marriage. And her mature smile at moments in the film recalled the younger attractive smile.\n\nKagawa is also impressive as the young daughter. She is a ‘modern miss’, frequently seen in jacket and slacks: a contrast to the garb of her more traditional mother. It is Toshiko who narrates the story of the film, looking back at the travails and devotion that her mother gave to her family. The voice-over is particularly potent in the introduction of the film as Toshiko sets the scene and in the final prayer for her mother, full of sentiment but very effective.\n\nToshiko’s relationship with Shinjiro provides the romantic strand in the film: though it is an essentially chaste romance, but enlivened by Toshiko’s own pert responses. This relationship also introduces one of the complications into family life. Shinjiro recounts gossip locally about Masako and Kimura to Toshiko. And for a time this produces a tension in the relationships, only resolved when Kimura (probably unwillingly) moves away to a new job.\n\nNaruse is a filmmaker who concentrates on character and performance. The settings outside the family home in the local streets, on a river trip and a day at an amusement park, are mainly plot directed. The focus of the film is the family relationships and the home in which these develop. Whilst Naruse has a fairly conventional camera style and shot length, he carefully places characters in the mise en scène. There are any number of framings that allow the setting to relate to the characters. There is a recurring framing that places several characters in a proscenium as we view them. Likewise he only occasionally focuses closely on objects and props: one powerful image being a drawing of her mother by the youngest daughter Chato. And he frequently uses head-on close-ups of individual characters, relying on the performer to communicate the emotion of the scene. The most dramatic events, like the deaths, take place off-screen and it is the characters that tell us of what has occurred and of their responses.\n\nThere is plentiful music in the film, ranging from bright and light music at times of happiness or pleasure, and lower bass-like music for the monument of darkness and concern. One of the lighter moments in the film is a traditional music festival. Toshiko performs a traditional song whilst Chato performs a traditional dance. Later Shinjiro sings a popular imported song, ‘O Sole Mio’: and this theme recurs frequently through the film from then on.\n\nSet in 1950 the film notes without emphasis the travails of the period. Besides Noriko there are other war widows among the characters. Kimura has only recently returned from a Soviet prison camp. And Masako’s difficulties with customers and the work by Toshiko point up the economic hardships. However, I noticed no sense of the occupation or indeed little sign of the authorities of the period. There are however, signs of the ravages of war in the settings around the family house.\n\nThe film also presents the contrast between the traditional cultural codes and the new codes of post-war Japan. Whilst Shinjiro sings his imported song at the Festival his parents turn, slightly sadly, and leave: clearly out of tune with the new music. And the only time we see Toshiko in traditional garb is when she models for her aunt Noriko: an event that is completely misread by Shinjiro.\n\nThis is a lower key film than A Hen in the Wind but it has beautiful pacing and the force of the performances is completely engrossing. The script is by a female writer. Mizuki Yoko, who worked on several Naruse films in this period, and who adapted the story from a prize-winning school essay. Tanaka provides another fine central lead and the film is a masterful depiction of Naruse’s world of lower class life and of a woman’s resilience in the face of adversity. The film won the Silver Lion at the 1952 Venice Film Festival.\n\nSansho the Bailiff (Sansho Dayu, 1954).\n\nThis was the third of the films featuring Tanaka Kinuyo screened in 2012. This was a film that I had seen before on 35mm, unlike the other titles. It is one of the great films by Mizoguchi Kenji with whom Tanaka worked on a number of occasions.\n\nThe film opens with a set of titles on-screen, setting out the story:\n\n“This story dates from medieval Japan when there was a form of feudal society. The majority of the people were considered less than human. This legend has been told since those days.”\n\nIn the manner of legends the exact times and places are not spelt out. It is apparently set in the 11th century. This was a period of imperial rule with the capital in Kyoto though the military class exercised effective power. In is mainly from the dialogue that ages and places can be discerned. The film falls into three segments separated by time and space; again only discernible in the dialogue. The titular character, the bailiff of a mansion of a high official, only appears in the second segment, forty minutes into the film.\n\nAfter the initial titles the film presents a family on a journey. There is the mother Tamaki (Tanaka Kinuyo): her son Zushiô (Hanayagi Yoshiaki) now about 13 years: her daughter Anju, (Kagawa Kyôko) aged about seven: and a woman servant, Ubatake (Naniwa Chieko). As they walk through the Japanese countryside there are several flashbacks, not obviously motivated’ but apparently the memories of Tamaki; mainly opened and closed by lap dissolves. These are set six years earlier when her husband Mausaji Taira no (Shimizu Masao), the father of the children, was the Governor of a province, Mutsu. Provinces were the basic level of administration in Feudal Japan; and this large province was in the North East alongside the sea.\n\nThe Governor had fallen foul of military leaders by opposing increased conscription of the peasants. His humanity had made him popular with the ordinary people but not with officials. As a punishment he is sent into exile to the province of Tsukushi, far away in the south of Japan. We see his support amongst the poor. And we see the farewells to his family who are to stay with Tamaki’s brother. When he parts from Zushiô the father recites his philosophy to his son and gives him an amulet, the Goddess of Mercy.\n\n“”Without mercy, a man is like a beast. Be sympathetic to others. Men are created equal. No one should be denied happiness.”\n\nThese mantras will be repeated at key stages of the subsequent narrative and the amulet becomes an important icon in the story.\n\nOn their journey the family are misled by a woman claiming to be a priestess. The result is the death of Ubatake, Tamaki being sold into prostitution and the children sold into slave labour.\n\nWe now encounter the mansion of which Sansho is the Bailiff ((Shindo Eitaro). He is a brutal and exploitative master; illustrated by the branding of an inmate who attempts escape. However his son Taro (Kono Akitake) is critical of his father’s brutality and attempts to ease the plight of the labourers; then leaving the mansion for Kyoto. The children do not reveal their names for fear of the consequences, [the possibility of ransom demands?]. For their time at the mansion they are known as Mutsu and Shinobu.\n\nThere is an ellipsis of ten tears and now Zushiô/Mutsu is 23 and Anju/Shinobu is 17, Zushiô has been brutalised over time and has become an overseer. The illustration is when he brands another would-be escapee. Anju remains committed to the teachings of their father. In an important sequence she hears a new girl worker sing a song;\n\n“How I long for you, Zushiô, Anju”\n\nOn Sado Island [in the Sea of Japan] Tamaki {now called Nakayama] desperately tries to flee and find her lost children. As a punishment she is hamstrung and disabled. We see her singing her sad refrain. Anju realises this is their mother pining for her children. She tells Zushiô but he is immured in their situation.\n\nAn opportunity now arises for Zushiô and Anju to escape when they have to carry an aged woman, no longer able to work, to a place to die alone. . But to prevent her brother’s recapture Anju remains and commits suicide rather than betray Zushiô. He gains sanctuary in an Imperial Monastery where he meets Taro again; now a Buddhist monk.\n\nIn the final section Zushiô journeys to the capital Kyoto. His father has died recently and it is too late to reinstate him. However, the injustice suffered is recognised and Zushiô is appointed Governor of the province of Tango, which contains the Mansion overseen by Sansho.. Once there Zushiô goes even farther than his father and confronts Sansho and the system of forced labour. He then journeys to Sado Island and after some travails find his mother in a hovel on a beach, now blind as well as crippled. He has to tell her of the death of both her husband and her daughter. Whilst they comfort each other he shows his mother the amulet of the Goddess of Mercy that he still carries.\n\nHis mother responds,\n\n“I do know that you followed your father’s words. That is … that is why we can meet here now.”\n\nThe scene and the film end with a crane shot which pans across the beach and rests two small islets: offering what critics have called a transcendental conclusion to the film: reinforcing the humanist values which are embodied in the film. The ending uses as music woodblocks, flutes and a harp, adds an appropriate emotional tone. The whole films show the command of Mizoguchi and his craft team, especially cinematographer Miyagawa Kazuo, of visual style: there are frequent graceful tracking shot and the mise en scene uses the landscape to great effect: physically beautiful on occasions, grimly realistic on others. The contrasting vistas add to the dramatisation of the story. When we first encounter the family the landscape is beautifully set; at one point they traverse a bed of flowered reeds. One spot is where Zushiô and Anju collect wood and reeds for a night time shelter. This scene has a parallel in the woody spot just before Zushiô’s escape, offering a motivation for his change of heart. Later the open and large seascape when the family are seized has an appropriately desolate feel. The mansion of Sansho is a grim setting as is the hovel on Sado island. These contrast with the opulent and highly formal setting of Kyoto, the Governor’s palace and the reception offered by Sansho to an emissary of the owner. And the monastery presents a solemn silent space rudely disrupted by Sansho armed retainers; and Taro’s care a contrast to the brutal treatment of the serfs in the mansion. The music, led by the woodblocks, flutes and harp has occasional orchestral backing but is minimal only accompanying key scenes. The harp dominates in the sequence as Anju slowly walks into the lake in a sacrificial suicide. Parallel music accompanies the scene as Zushiô stands by the lake mourning his sister. And the song we hear in the sequence showing Tamaki prostituted on Sado island re-appears in the final sequence but now the crippled Tamaki can hardly sing the words and mostly she is just humming theme.\n\nThe cast are excellent. Tanaka Kinuyo has an important presence in the opening section ; following this she appears in shorter sequences in the middle and concluding sections. In the course of the film she is changed from a formally attired aristocratic lady to a crippled and poverty stricken old woman. Her use of her body emphasises the changes from the formal characterisation of her early appearances to the wasted and stricken character at the finale. This is a part of the powerful and tragic development in the film.\n\nThe critical sense in the narrative also develops. Mausaji Taira opposes the ruling of the military elite but accepts the punishment laid down. But when Zushiô becomes a governor he is warned not to overstep the bounds but deliberately does this and confronts the unjust laws. Immediately he resigns knowing that this will lead to his punishment. So his conduct is more radical than that of his father thought the oppressive system remains. An audience may wonder what happens to the protagonist after mother and son are reunited. But they should also wonder if the oppressive serf system will not be re-imposed when a new Governor takes office.\n\nMizoguchi was one of the directors in the 1950s who bought Japanese cinema to the attention of western critics and audiences. A number of the films were winners of prestigious awards at European film festivals; Sansho dayu won the Silver Lion Award at the 1954 Venice Film Festival, alongside Kurosawa Akira’s Seven Samurai / Shichinin no samurai.\n\nThe Eternal Breasts (Chibusa yo eien nare, 1955)\n\nThis was the first film directed by Tanaka Kinuyo in the Leeds International Film Festival retrospective. I found the film impressive. It deals with a topic that even today that filmmakers find difficult to address directly, a woman who suffers a mastectomy. Tanaka, and her scriptwriter Tanaka Sumie [not related], have taken the story of an actual character, Tanaka Fumiko. She was a tanka poet [an important short poem form] who suffered a cancer, which led to the removal of her breasts. As the catalogue comments this is developed into “an unflinching account of a modern-minded woman afflicted with breast cancer’. Fumiko (Tsukioka Yurneji) is married to a taciturn and unsympathetic husband and has two children, Noboru and Aiko. She seems like a devoted and dutiful wife, but is dissatisfied with her situation. Her husband has an extra-marital affair that leads to a divorce, with her son residing with the father whilst she remains with custody of her daughter. Her family pressurises her to consider remarriage. Then she is diagnosed with breast cancer. After the operation Fumiko is partly distraught by the effects on her body but also show signs of an awakening as a new woman. This is signed visually by her changed and stylish hair cut, [a sign in Japan of a woman’s change and in wider cinema often a sign of a woman’s trauma].\n\nFumiko has also been involved in a local poetry circle. The publication of some of her poems leads to interest by the Press, mainly it seems because of her tragic situation. This leads to her meeting a reporter from the Tokyo Daily News, Ōtsuki. At first part of the cynical exploitation of her, a relationship develops between them, but it is cut short by her death.\n\nThe basic plot suggests a fairly melodramatic story and a large dose of sentiment. In fact this is avoided, partly by the emphasis on her personal development and by an astringent depiction of the travails of her situation. It is only in the last scenes of the film that sentiment becomes unrestrained, as Ōtsuki and her children in a traditional gesture cast flowers into the water. This is presumably to provide a more upbeat tone to a tragic tale.\n\nWhat impressed me was that the film mainly avoids the sense of tragedy. The focus in this tale is on the change in Fumiko, in her developing strength and in her unsentimental response to her situation. The catalogue describes her as follows: “ Fumiko is instead refreshingly presented as an imperfect, often selfish character and Tanaka’s handling of the film as a whole is tinged with the same even-handed humanity as she projected in the best of her own performances.” This is in part due to the fine performance of Tsukioka Yurneji in the lead role. After her operation she is transformed, not just visually with her new hairstyle, but in her behaviour. She becomes obviously sexy in a way that was absent when she was seen as the dutiful wife.\n\nLooking back the signs were there even in her married times. Her poetry acts as an outlet for her frustrations. She writes poems that are critical of her husband: which occasions catty comments from other women in the poetry circle. At the same time, after her operation, she remains a loving mother, caring and concerned for her children. She leaves them a final poem as a recollection of herself for her two children.\n\nThe style of the film is also impressive. Just as Fumiko changes after her operation, so does the film. The early scenes are fairly conventional. The family live in a rural location surrounded by farmland, sheep and cows. The camera positions are straightforward, as is the editing though occasional shots suggest the darker side of the situation. At the moment when Fumiko discovers her husband’s infidelity there is a close-up as hand reaches back to collect a forgotten handbag. Another close-up shows a pair of white gloves, which Fumiko flings at her husband’s head.\n\nFollowing the operation the film has a much more urban feel [set in the city of Hokkaido], we spend much of the time in a hospital. Outside visits are to streets, the railway station and a local school. The camera seems more mobile and there are very effective shots set in corridors and stairways: the latter settings for moments of great intensity. Noticeable the amount of close-ups increases: often of Fumiko but also of the characters that surround her.\n\nThere are several powerful scenes placing Fumiko behind frames and bars. As Ōtsuki leaves her to return to Tokyo Fumiko stands behind the bars of a window and the camera very slowly tracks in on her. Another especially effective sequence has a camera tracking Fumiko as she follows a corpse and grieving relatives to the hospital morgue. This group is framed in a long corridor and the sequence ends with Fumiko stopped by the bars of the door into the morgue. This is also an example of how effectively the film uses repetition: after her death Ōtsuki and her children follow her body to the morgue. But the gate into the receptacle of death again bars the children.\n\nAlex Jacoby offers comments in his excellent ‘Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors on Tanaka’. He suggests she lacks the individual style that marks out the auteur. This is the old chestnut of auteur versus metteur en scéne. What Tanaka does is to extremely effectively bring to visual and aural life the story provided by from actual life and adapted her scriptwriter. It is true that Tanaka’s films shows the influence of the directors with whom she worked as an actress. Apparently her earliest film followed the style of Yasujiro Ozu, with whom he worked several times. There are occasional signs of his style in this film. There are low-angle camera shots: exteriors that occur before or after an interior scene, though much shorter than those found in Ozu. And there is the frequent continuation of a sequence when the main plot interest has ended. However, a more marked influence in Mikio Naruse, with whom she also worked on a number of films. Much of the framing recalls Naruse, as do the frequent powerful close-ups relying on the performer for impact. Like him the exteriors seem mainly about setting, the drama is almost completely played out in the interiors. Like both Naruse and Ozu Tanaka also frequently uses very effective deep staging to place the characters and their relationships. Costumes and sets reinforce this angle. In the course of the film Yoshio marries. However at the ceremony Fumiko remains preparing food and avoids wearing the traditional kimono required for such ceremonies. The music, by Kojun Saitó, recalls Naruse, with varied combinations from orchestral string, through a recurring accordion and the occasional combination of vibraphone and piano. And in the dramatic operation scene there is an insistent bass drum. There is a parallel with an earlier film: in the scene where Fumiko bathes she is heard humming ‘O solo mio’ – a song that featured in Naruse’s film Mother, starring Tanaka.\n\nThe influence is probably due in part to the writer Tanaka Sumie, who wrote several of Naruse’s fine 1950s films, also addressing women’s issues. One influence that is missing is that of the director with whom Tanaka worked most frequently, Mizoguchi Kenji. The record of Mizoguchi opposing her move into direction could explain this, whereas Ozu was very supportive, letting her film one of his scripts. But it is probably also due to Mizoguchi’s contradictory treatment of women characters. In his films women tend to remain dutiful, and are often the victims of sacrifice for the men.\n\nThis is definitely not the case with Tanaka. Fumiko is a rounded character with contradictory emotions and responses. But she shows remarkable resilience as she faces the crises in her life. Here she is closer to both Ozu, whose women are strong but usually dutiful, and even more to Naruse, whose women stolidly face up to the oppression of life. Tanaka goes further however in detailing the actual experience of women and how they learn to live with these travails.\n\nThe operation includes close-up of her breast as the nurse prepares for the surgeon’s knife and then there is a close-up of the scalpel that will cut away the flesh. Equally the film openly addresses women’s desires. In an early scene Fumiko visits the home of her friend Hori and his wife Kinuko. At the start of the sequence Kinuko heats the stove whilst her husband takes a bath. At one point she slides back the small window looking into the bathroom, as her husband relaxes in the hot water. After Fumiko’s arrival Kinuko leaves for a teachers’ meeting and in the course of the evening Fumiko expresses her love for Hori, though this remains unconsummated. Hori dies and in a later scene, after her operation, Fumiko uses the same bath and Kinuko heats the water. Kinuko slides open the window but is shocked when Fumiko happily displays her disfigured chest, [not though to the audience]. After this incident Fumiko admits her love for Hori and says that she wanted to once bathe in the same place that he had done. The later apparently sexual relationship between Fumiko and Ōtsuki is handled with much greater discretion.\n\nIn introducing the film Michael Smith suggested that Fumiko is not a ‘likeable character’, a different emphasis from his description in the catalogue. And after the film a young woman said that she really liked the film but that ‘the men were terrible’. This is partly true but it is a larger issue in the film. The husband is discredited and the reporter also, at least in his early appearances. But Fumiko suffers a great amount of unsympathetic treatment from other characters. I have already mentioned the poetry circle and the Press exploitation. At another point in the film she tells her mother [grandma] that it was her insistence that led to Fumiko’s marriage. And her friend Kinuko is seen as hidebound by social attitudes and is unable to face her new condition. It is in this context that I find Fumiko shows great strength of character.\n\nIt should be noted that she is strongly supported in her illness by her mother and by her brother Yoshio. And Kinuko visits her and gives her a music box that belonged to her husband Hori. In a parallel between her loves, later in the film Fumiko gives the music box to Ōtsuki.\n\nThere is possibly an autobiographical theme in the film. In the early 1950s Tanaka, a popular star, returned from the USA and arrived back in western style clothes. She received many complaints from fans and criticism in the press for this ‘lapse’. Whilst in her many film roles she is often strong and also stoical, I have not seen a film in which she was able to play a character that represents the liberation of the ‘modern miss’. But this is the battle that Fumiko is fighting in this film.\n\nAlex Jacoby, whilst praising the film and the performances, criticised the emphasis on the personal rather than on a women making her own life and career in place of marriage. This is a fair point; in fact Tanaka’s own career followed that pattern, she never married but she made her way as a star and then as a filmmaker. However, the film is dealing with a particular oppressive aspect of life for women: not just in terms of their sexual roles but in their ability to determine their own relationships. I think the film remains an early and powerful expression of a woman’s struggle. And it seems that Tanaka remains a rare example of a successful and really interesting woman filmmaker in Japanese cinema.\n\nGirls of Dark ( Onna bakari no yoru, 1961)\n\nThis film was the last screening in the Tanaka Kinuyo retrospective at the Leeds International Film Festival. It was her fifth film and was released in 1961. The scriptwriter was once again Tanaka Sumie together with Masaka Yana. The film deals with the rehabilitation of prostitutes. Prostitution was a common theme in Japanese films in this period. In 1956 the Government passed an anti-prostitution law which came into effect in 1958. The book from which the film was adapted came out in this period. There were also a cycle of films dealing with prostitution, a famous example was Mizoguchi Kenji’s Street of Shame (1956). However, Tanaka’s film is atypical in dealing with the question of the rehabilitation of these ‘fallen women’. The film seems to have differed from the book in a number of respects. The scriptwriters changed some of the story, including explicit references to lesbianism. However, it seems that the director re-introduced at least aspects of the last theme, and that topic is explicit in the finished film.\n\nThe opening of the film features a series of short newspaper articles, and sequences in the red light district, including raids by the police. After the credits the action opens in the Chiragiku Home for Women [a rehabilitation centre]: it is worth noting that the more recidivist offenders were sent to reformatories. We meet the staff, including the directress Nogami and a group of new inmates. The centre is toured along with a group from a Ladies Club, and includes a young married woman, Mrs Shima (Kyoko Kagawa who had already appeared alongside Tanaka Kinuyo in Mother and Sansho Dayu). I found the opening scenes not easy to follow as we meet a large number of characters and I found it difficult to catch all their names.\n\nOne couple that stood out were two older inmates, Kameju asnd Yoshimi. Kameju constantly makes advances to Yoshimi, who is fairly unrepentant about her trade. And at one point Kameju snuggles down besides Yoshimi under a coverlet telling her that ‘‘woman are better than men’. Yoshima makes frequent attempts to escape and this finally leads to a tragic end for the smitten Kameju.\n\nThen the narrative narrows to focus on Kuniko (Hara Hisako) and to a lesser extent on her friend Chi-chan. Having obtained a good record in the Home Kuniko is allowed to leave and to attempt to re-establish herself in society and work. We follow her as she makes her way through three different jobs. Occasional voice-overs give us access to her thoughts and feelings. And she writes letters to Nogami, which the director reads out to the inmates.\n\nIn the first job Kuniko is a paid help for a married couple with a shop. The work is hard and the wages low, 2,500 yen a month: apparently not a living wage. [It is worth noting that in the Home the inmates receive anything from a 62 to 15 yen rate for their work]. Embittered Kinuko wreaks her revenge on the husband and momentarily considers returning to her previous life. However, she is picked up by the police.\n\nBack in the home Kuniko is now placed in a factory. She is set apart from the other girls there, and when she tells them about her past she is subjected to bullying and a sadistic attack by a group of fellow workers. She returns to the home painfully injured.\n\nHer third job is in a ‘rose nursery’ owned by the husband of Mrs Shima. The husband is a lecturer. The young wife is very supportive of Kuniko, and there has already been a hint of attraction on her part when she visited the Home. Kuniko shares a room with her friend Chi-Chan, who has a job in a local cafeteria. The rule of the Home is to avoid entanglements with men, however Kuniko develops a relationship with the young worker in the nursery, Tsugasa. She is also visited by an old flame and pimp from her past. The social antagonisms around prostitution follow her here as she attempts to make a new life.\n\nMichael Smith in his introduction remarked that the film showed more of a distinctive style than Tanaka’s earlier films. This was apparent and one of the visual pleasures was the use of the Tohoscope format in black and white. This is a fine film format and there are some striking compositions, especially in the several dramatic exteriors. I noted that more of the drama of this film was played out in the exterior settings. But there was also the use of framing and the drama on staircases and corridors that we saw in her earlier film, The Eternal Breasts. In many scenes Tanaka used the widescreen format to place characters in the setting and to place significant objects in the frame. There are placements and close-ups of roses in the nursery sequences which comments upon the situation. The filming of groups in especially well handled, and there are several stark tableaux-like shots at moments of intense drama.\n\nI found the action and characters more conventional than in the earlier The Eternal Breasts. For example there are fights among the women in the factory section, a staple of such films. The red light scenes seemed very familiar. However, my colleague at the screening thought the film the less conventional of the two. My feelings were that whilst the relationships between the women were very interesting, the treatment of rehabilitation and of prostitution was familiar from other film treatments.\n\nI was though, struck by the final sequence of the film. Kuniko is once more working, this time with woman collecting marine food in the waters along a beach. Her voice-over speaks of her wish to achieve stability and purity. The final shot shows her in a line of women returning with their heavy baskets along the sands. Then we have a great camera crane above the women, tilting up to show the sea and surrounding vista. The shot seems like a reverse image of the famous shot that ends Mizoguchi Kenji’s Sansho Dayu and conjures up a similar feeling of calm and perseverance. Perhaps it was homage to a master. In the Mizoguchi film the final shot shows two humped-back islets. In Tanaka’s film the equivalence are two rock pillars: Freudians would be able to make great play with this.\n\nThe whole series of films has been remarkably absorbing and extremely enjoyable. Michael Smith summed up the week with thanks to the Leeds International Film Festival, The Centre for World Cinema, The Japan Film Foundation and the Hyde Park Cinema Picture House. The applause from the audience was also a well-deserved thank-you to him from the audience for his labours in bringing these rare films to Leeds and introducing us to a little known but clearly very fine actress and outstanding woman filmmaker."
