No one is more pleased than I am to finally see the book roll off the press. Writing the book has been a tremendous labor for the other committee members and me. However, we are overjoyed to see the results of almost a decade of work.\n\nThe Murray County History Committee was jointly appointed by the Whitfield-Murray Historical Society and the Murray County Grand Jury in late 1977. We began work in 1978, knowing that a book was far in the future because we were virtually \"starting from scratch.\" The only history of Murray County in existence was the short volume written by Charles Shriner three quarters of a century ago. Therefore, we began our labors not sure when we would see the results.\n\nAs the committee worked, we surveyed cemeteries, wrote letters, visited libraries and archives, read countless volumes of deeds and county records, researched a hundred years of newspapers, and interviewed many older residents. As our files grew, we tried to compile the information, but, as the months passed, more facts kept coming to light and we just could not go to press when so much history was not yet recorded. Attempts to get others to help us with church and organization histories as well as histories of specific eras, areas, and events were only somewhat successful. Yet, we pressed on.\n\nAt the same time, members of the committee restored the Old Spring Place Methodist Church to house the materials we collected. We were also involved with other historical society projects, families, school, jobs, church, personal interests, and other activities. All the work has been donated and I am grateful to the many who have helped this book become a reality.\n\nForemost among the contributors have been the committee members-Mildred McCamy (who suggested the book's title), Sarah Dillard, Sybil Mc-Lemore, Katherine Raine, Nell Ruth Loughridge. and especially Louise Coker and Emily Cogburn-along with my very supportive family. In the long course of our work many of those we interviewed first have since passed away. While I am glad we recorded their memories, my greatest regret is that people like R.E. Chambers, Mamie Pierce, Carl Davis, Jennie Weyman, Mattie Lou Pritchett, Mark Baxter, Roy McGinty, and our own Kate Raine did not live to see their words in print. A special thanks to Polly Boggess for all her help.\n\nAlso, 1 know some areas are sketchy, omissions will be noted, and some inaccuracies will be found. I apologize for this. We tried to include everything possible, but we are not experts on all aspects of Murray County history. No one knows how many hours were spent researching, writing, reconciling different versions of the same stories, editing, verifying, proofreading, and indexing. Even while we were writing things changedTennga's stores closed and it got a new postmaster, new churches (like Liberty Bell Baptist) were established, businesses came and went, and new facts kept coming to light-like the location of a Civil War prison camp 8 miles northeast of Spring Place and the site of a Union camp of 400 men 4 miles north of Spring Place. We just could not include every detail.\n\nHowever, we are pleased with the book and hope you will be, too. Read, learn, and enjoy along with people all across the country who have a Murray County \"connection.\" To quote the Psalmist David, \"The lines are fallen ... in pleasant places... I (we) have a goodly heritage.\" (16:6);\n\nYours,\n\nTim Howard, Chairman\n\nReturn to TOP of page! -ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS-\n\nAppreciation is expressed to all those people who have helped us gather the information for this history. Over the years we have had countless people loan us pictures, pass on information, provide us with encouragement, tell us about resource people, give us documents, and assist with the actual research and writing. Without you we could never have accomplished what we set out to do back in 1978. The history is truly a book about Murray County by Murray Countians (whether by birth or by feeling). Following is a list of many who helped. If your name is omitted, please forgive us-we still appreciate you.\n\nConway Gregory, Jr.Emily CogburnPolly BoggessJoann WarmackBill WarmackLouise MitchellFrances HeartsellMarie KellyMr. &Mrs. Hill JonesTucker & Grace BrownLovadah MaynardR.F. & Wave HillMinnie GryderCharlie HallKirby & Lucy YoungLee TimmsFrank &, Lee BrindteBertie RobinsonJohn & Mae FoxMattie Lou PritchettWillie Mae SextonMina BiamblettMattie RobinsonAgnes KempEdna Jo ButlerCarl & Ora DavisJim & Odetta HowardC.N. & Sarah KingPauline HemphillMr. & Mrs. Colquitt CarterDan & Milma EinestSadie WilsonMarie RoeMr.&Mrs. R.E.

The northern boundary of the county, part of the state line between Tennessee and Georgia, is the 35th parallel of latitude. Once much larger. Murray County now consists of 342 square miles.\n\nMurray has a variety of topographic elevations ranging from 700 feet above sea level in the valleys, to more than 4,000 feet in the mountains. Prominent peaks in the Murray skyline include Fort, Grassy, Cohutta. Bald, and Potato Patch mountains. Mountains occupy about one-third of the eastern part of the county and have long been noted for their beauty.\n\nAll surface drainage in the area flows into the Mobile River Basin. The Conasauga and Coosawattee Rivers, the two most important streams in Murray, join to form the Oostanaula near Resaca in Gordon County. Other significant streams are Sumac, Mill, and Holly Creeks, all of which flow westward into the Conasaugathe boundary between Murray and Whitfield.\n\nMany minerals are present in Murray. Gold was mined for a time while marble, iron, lead, silver, and manganese exist in smaller amounts. For many years large quantities of talc {earlier called soapstone) have been mined in the mountains.\n\nLong an agricultural region, Murray fields have yielded countless amounts of corn, cotton, wheat, fruit, grasses, other vegetables, and, in more recent years, soybeans. The land is fertile and provides excellent pasturage for cattle as well as other animals. The lumber business has also thrived in the area for many decades.\n\nMurray's population has shown various increases and declines in the 20th century. The number of residents climbed from 8.623 in 1900 to 9,400 in 1920. Although the population decreased to 9,215 in 1930, it rose almost 2,000 by 1940 (11,137). During the years during and following World War II the number of residents declined and by 1960 the population was 10,447. This change is attributed to agriculture declines and the number of people who left the area for jobs in other places during the war. Between 1960 and 1970 Murray enjoyed a population increase of 24.3 percent (12.986). Since then the population has continued to grow. Thus the labor force and school enrollment have increased steadily.\n\nMurray County has changed tremendously in the last two decades. Many long-time residents have passed away and, with them, much of our heritage. A significant number of people have moved to Murray, and are learning about the area's long and fascinating history. Here then is the written account of \"Murray County Heritage.\"\n\nReturn to TOP of page! -Chapter I-\n\nThe Old Federal Road\n\nAs mentioned earlier, James Vann helped get the Cherokee Nation's first highway built by convincing the chiefs that a road would be beneficial to the Indians (and perhaps more importantly, to James Vann). In 1803 the Cherokees granted informal permission for the Federal government to build a road across heir land. This major thoroughfare became known as the Federal Road and connected Tennessee with points to the southeast.\n\nMr. Lewis Richardson again shares his knowledge of early North Georgia history as follows: . . . These [roads] served a dual purpose: provide easier movement of supplies to the [Indian] agencies and western settlements and, if war came, speed the passage of army baggage trains . . .\n\nThe informal agreement was ratified by the Treaty of Tellico in 1805 and the road was opened for wagons by the next year. Mr. Richardson continues:\n\nBy this time, there was no money available from the federal coffers. The Administration referred the matter to the Governors of Tennessee and Georgia, suggesting that the states pay for locating and opening the road. Both states refused any responsibility. The road was actually opened by private effort, for the most part by tavern owners and trading post operators. No federal money was expended on any part. It should have been christened the \"Cherokee Road.\"\n\nIn a few years there was an increasing flow of traffic on the route. At first there were the heavy freight wagons with four and six horse teams; later lightly built post stages began to carry the mail and an occasional passenger. By 1820, there were the \"movers,\" families passing through the Nation seeking new homes in Tennessee or Northern Alabama. Some few liked what they saw in the Cherokee country, made an accomodation with the Indians and settled along the road. The track also became an important drovers route, with herds of cattle and droves of hogs, from Hast Tennessee to markets in Georgia. And always there were the individual horsemen, politicians, military men, traders, missionaries and curious travelers.\n\nIt was inevitable that other connecting toads would be opened to serve the larger villages. New Echota and Ellijay, for example. By the rnid-1830's, there was a considerable network of wagon roads, cart tracks and pack horse trails in the Nation, ll should be noted, however, there had been almost no attempt to improve any of these roads There was no grading, bridges, or surface treatment other than poles d brush thrown in the worst stretches of mud and swamp. By our standards, they could hardly be classed as roads. This was the transportation system in the region when the removal of the Cherokees began in the late 1830's.\n\nThe Old Federal Road began west of Athens, went to Vann's Ferry near present-day Lake Lanier, curved north and west through several modern counties, and entered Murray County near Carters. In the early 1950's John H. Goff, a professor at Emory wrote this description of the Road in Murray County:\n\nTravelers......forded the [Coosawattee) river just above [the old bridge | .where the stream widened into swift but shallow shaols ... At Cuniston, two miles farther on. the old road strikes U.S. 411...\n\nNear this place also, not far from a present large dairy barn, in frontier days was an interesting place named \"Bloodtown.\" Origin of the name is obscure, but the site was a noted spot where south-bound cattle drovers penned their stock at night for feeding and resting while en route to markets. Traces of Bloodtown have long since disappeared, but tales of the reveling and brawling which took place there persisted long.\n\nUp the road a little farther, in front of a filling station which now marks Ramhurst, Georgia, on U.S. 411, the Old Federal Road branched. One fork . . . turned left toward Chattanooga and Nashville. The other continued straight ahead, approximately along the course of U.S. 411. via prcscnt-day Chatsworth, Eton, and Cisco to Tennga on the Georgia-Tennessee line.\n\n(The U.S. 411 mentioned is old 411 today.)\n\nGoff gave additional information about the western fork of the Road from Ramhurst as follows:\n\n... the left branch leads northwest by historic Spring Place in Murray County toward Chattanooga. No one living along its course now seems to remember it as a Federal route; generally it is referred to as the \"Old Chattanooga Road,\" although in rare instances a few old timers recall it as the \"Georgia Road.\" The last is its oldest name, under which the government first sought a passageway through the Cherokee country. At Spring Place the road bore to the north of the village and the majestic old Vann house that stands just notth of that place.\n\nA stretch of the early trail is missing along here, But it takes up again at Free Hope Church Crossroads, northwest of Spring Place, and runs straight north to the Old Chattanooga l-ord below the mouth of Mill Creek on Conasauga River. The ford is no longer used, but the former trace is still there.\n\nThe road then went through Whitfield County.\n\nThe Old Federal Road soon became the major post and stagecoach route in the Cherokee Nation. A stage began running through Spring Place as early as '825 and by 1833 regularly ran to Athens, Tennessee. A post office had been established at Spring Place earlier.\n\nAnother important event during this era was the beginning of a canal system in Georgia. Designed to improve \"internal\" transportation, these canals were very ambitious undertakings, but the canal era did not last long due to the coming of railroad and almost none were even begun in Georgia. However, \"the Conasauga River was once a busy artery of commerce and was twice considered as part of a canal system,\" according to historian Lewis Richardson. One proposal was for the River to become a portion of Georgia's Northwest Canal. \"In 1825. Wilson Lumpkin and State Engineer Hamilton Fulton led an exploratory party through the area and selected the river as the best route.\" The Cherokees refused to permit the canal building at that time or in 1826 and 1827 when the Tennessee General Assembly chartered the Hiwassee Canal Company. Plans were drawn to connect the Conasauga with the Ocoee River by means of 15 locks spaced over 10 miles. However the canals were not to be.\n\nReturn to TOP of page! -Chapter I-\n\nIndian Settlements And The Moravians\n\nThe area that now comprises Murray County was long the home of native Americans. Paleolithic and Archaic Era Indians were gradually replaced by the Woodland Indians after 1000 B.C. Although hunting, fishing, and gathering remained the principle sources of food, agricultural methods and larger, more permanent villages characterized this Woodland period. The Woodland Indians were also the first to develop religious systems and to build dirt mounds over graves of important people. Mound building reached its height during the succeeding \"Mississippian Age.\" Evidence of this period exists in Murray County near Carters Darn. Several mounds have been excavated there.\n\nAround 900 A.D. a strong group of Indians from the north invaded Georgia, probably from Tennessee. About 200 years later the older natives reconquered parts of Georgia and their descendants, the Creeks, later played an important par! in Georgia history. The invaders from the north retained control of the Murray area although some Creek placenames were retained in North Georgia. By 1540, when the Spanish explorer Hemando DeSoto came through Georgia, two groups of Indians existed, the Creeks in the south and in the north the people who were to be called Cherokees.\n\nAn Indian town called Guaxule is mentioned in DeSoto's records. The Spaniards received a warm, peaceful welcome from the chief of this village which included some 300 houses. Five hundred warriors dressed in skins with feather decorations escorted their leader to his meeting with De Soto. Georgia historian Charles C. Jones, Jr. identified Guaxule as being in Murray County. Apparently the Cherokees occupied an old Creek settlement and later renamed it \"Coosawattee\" which means \"old Creek place.\" DeSoto's men stayed in the area about 4 days and following their departure, the Cherokees were left alone for about 200 years.\n\nIn the early days of the 18th century, the Cherokees roamed freely over most of what is now the states of Virginia, Kentucky. North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee. Georgia, and Alabama. As the white settlers moved inward from the Atlantic the native Americans were forced to relinquish pieces of land, first in Virginia and South Carolina, then in North Carolina and Georgia, then in Tennessee and Alabama. Finally, by the 1820's the once vast Cherokee Nation included only a small area where North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia, and Alabama join. But many changes had taken place within the Nation in that space of 100 years.\n\nThe Cherokees had decided that there was no need to try to fight the encroaching white people, but rather agreed to settle down, build log homes, become an agricultural nation and adopt the ways of the whites in hopes of retaining their homeland. Traders were allowed into the Cherokee domain as well as French and British Indian agents. As the American colonists revolted for their independence, the Cherokees felt they should fight with the British, feeling that the mighty Englishmen would surely defeat the Americans and would then treat the Cherokees in a favorable manner. Unfortunately for the Cherokees, the British lost the colonies.\n\nAfter the War for Independence, the Cherokees made peace with the new United States Government. More and more whites pushed toward the Indian lands and with this came a greater exchange of ideas between the Indians and the white culture. Murray County soon had a number of white residents who lived among and married Cherokees.\n\nCoosawattee Old Town, located near Carters, became a thriving settlement. Ebenezer Newton traveled through the area in 1818 and found that Coosawattee was \"a considerable town of the Indians on both sides of the river.\" Newton commented that the Indians were \"very civil and kind\" and that the area was very beautiful. The Newton party spent the night at \"Captain Foster's\" in a comfortable log cabin. Foster was a prominent Cherokee who had several slaves. Newton remarked that the blacks spoke English better than their master.\n\nOther early names near Coosawattee were the McDaniels, Harlans, and the Martins. Judge Martin built the house now known as Carters Quarter. During the Carter ownership of the land much was discovered about the earlier Indian settlement. In the 1880's two large silver crosses which pointed to DeSoto's visit were unearthed. In the late 1920's and 1930's excavations were conducted on the burial mounds, by Prof. Warren Moorehead, while in 1934 a large cave was discovered and was thought to contain lost Indian treasures. Professor J.R. Stull was told of the cave by an aged Cherokee in Utah and followed markings on trees to the spot where some \"stone images\" were found. Iron objects, shells, arrow points, pottery, and skeletons had been found during the earlier diggings. Other burials were unearthed in the 1960's prior to the building of Carters Dam.\n\nApparently this area, under its various names of Guaxule, Coosawattee Old Town, and Carters, is the oldest continually occupied \"town\" in Murray County.\n\nReturn to TOP of page! -Chapter I-\n\nThe Vanns and the Vann House\n\nWhile Coosawattee was older and the home of the wealthy Martins, no other town or family could rival the Vanns of \"Diamond Hill,\" \"Vann's Town,\" and Spring Place. No family adopted white ways to the extent that the Vanns did. Their fame, fortune, and failures are known not just in Murray County and Georgia, but across the United States. Their story is the story of the Cherokees as well as the story of Murray County in the first quarter of the 19th century.\n\nAccounts of the first Vann to come to the Cherokee Nation vary a great deal. Some say his name was James, others say Clement, and still others compromise and say it was James Clement. Several versions of the family story report that the first Vann to come to Georgia was James Vann's father, while others feel that it was James's grandfather, a Scot trader perhaps running from the law, who entered the Cherokee Nation near its southern boundary and married a full-blooded Cherokee princess named Wawli. Some authors write that the first Vann had married Ruth Gann. A more recent genealogist proposes that two brothers began the Vann family trading business with the Cherokees. James came first but died a short time after marrying Waw-li who then married James's brother. Clement, a later arrival to the Cherokee lands. At any rate, Waw-li, the chieftain's daughter, married a Scot trader named Vann and had at least three children: Avery, James, and Nancy (according to most sources, anyway). Here the saga of the Murray County Vanns really begins.\n\nThe Vann family moved to the Murray area in the late 1700's. Since they were already well-to-do traders and farmers, the clan quickly built up vast land-holdings. Avery Vann moved back south to what became Vann's Valley in Floyd County, while James built his Murray plantation called Diamond Hill. At this time Spring Place was still merely a stopping place for hunting and trading parties.\n\nJames increased his wealth, establishing a mill, trading post, and slave cabins on Mill Creek. He is said to have built the first wagon in the Cherokee Nation. He married three wives. Jennie Foster, Elizabeth Thornton, and Margaret \"Peggy\" Scott (born 1783). Of the first two, one was Indian and one was white, while \"Peggy\" was of mixed blood. Her father had been an Indian agent for the British. James fathered five legitimate children: James, John, Sally, Delilah and, the youngest, Joseph (bom 1798), his only child by Peggy.\n\nMr. Vann developed quite a reputation as a fierce man, particularly when he had been drinking which was very often. Nevertheless, in 1793 he was called upon by U.S. Government Indian Agents to clear the Cherokee lands of thieves and other white men who were causing trouble. He continued in this \"police\" action until his death. James Vann killed many white men in duels or to enforce his authority over them. One account reports that he murdered Georgia militiaman Leonard Rice and most sources reveal that he was very strict on his workers, whites as well as slaves. He once whipped his overseer Mr. Crawford 100 strokes and tried to shoot another employee, Mr. Giger, on another occasion. He also had an overseer named Bohing at one time. His most violent action came in 1805 against a slave named Isaac. Isaac and three other blacks (two were Bob and Peter) stole $3,500 from Vann's money chest upon the instigation of a white visitor named Spencer, along with Mr. Bowen. When Isaac was captured he was burned alive while the others were shot or \"strung up in a tree.\" Earlier, Vann had abused an elder chief and even shot his own uncle under terms of an old Cherokee blood law which demanded revenge.\n\nDespite his fierce temper and drinking problem, James Vann did care for his mother's people, the Cherokees. He hated to see them robbed and mistreated by white intruders. He was also concerned for their education. While on a business trip to the eastern coastal cities, including Washington, D.C., he met a group of Moravian Missionaries from Salem, North Carolina. Impressed with their dedication and desire to work among the Cherokees, he promised them supportfinancially and physicallyif they would come to Georgia and establish a school for the Cherokee children.\n\nVann took the plan to the other chiefs and persuaded them to allow the establishment of a mission on James Vann's property.\n\nThe Moravians were installed in two small cabins which were being vacated by a Mr. Brown and located about 1& miles from Diamond Hill between James Vann's field and his mother's field near a limestone spring. Vann promised them some new buildings and the Moravians were pleased with the arrangementuntil they found that Vann was planning to build a still on the spring a short distance from the missionaries' cabins. They asked Vann about building their new mission complex on a hill just west of their present spot and he agreed, but to the missionaries' dismay, Vann soon had plans made to build a new house for himself on the hill. The missionaries then were given land a short distance southeast of the proposed spot for their mission. They were not displeased at being a distance from the home of Vann.\n\nVann hired a German named Vogt to design his new house, a house which would rival any house within the bounds of the Cherokee nation, a house on the scale of others Vann had seen in the east during his many travels. So while the Moravians were attempting to build their own dwellings and a school, Vann asked them to help instruct his slaves and other Indians in how to build his new brick house. All Moravians were excellent craftsmen and he must have been pleased at his choice of missionary teachers to come to his town. The work on the house began late in 1803 with most of the work being done in 1804. The Vanns moved into the newly completed house in March, 1805. Everything used in building the house was made on the site except the glass for the windows which was shipped from Savannah.\n\nMeanwhile the Moravians had begun their school which also pleased James Vann. In sponsoring the school, Vann contributed greatly to the education of the many men who would lead the Cherokees through their most trying hours in the next two decades. Although the Moravians were interested in making Christian converts, this was difficult since the spirits of James Vann were in such close proximity.\n\nThe Moravians named the mission complex Springplace or \"place of many springs\" due to the large number of excellent streams in the area. The town which sprang up after Vann moved his family nearby was soon going by the name of Vann's Town. Vann reigned both as plantation owner and master as well as a town chief over the area. He had increased his wealth until he owned over 4,000 acres of land as well as operating taverns, stores, a grist mill, a sawmill, a blacksmith shop, ferries, and other types of businesses throughout the Cherokee nation. Many of his business ventures were located on the Old Federal Road, built in 1805 under his sponsorship. While the other chiefs voiced protest about building a road through the Cherokee lands, James Vann forced it through the Councilthe road would be very advantageous to his businesses. His Diamond Hill complex became known as Vann's \"Old Town.\"\n\nHowever, James Vann did not get to enjoy his fine \"Showplace of the Cherokee Nation\" very long for his life was nearing its end. In 1807 or 1808 James killed his brother-in-law, John Falling, in a duel near Spring Place. Some say the duel came about after James abused his mother and beat his sister (Falling's wife) while she was with child. Another source mentions that Falling had been involved in the theft ring which had resulted in Isaac's death. Whatever the cause, the following account of the duel was recorded later:\n\nVann met Falling. He charged him with Treachery. Words ensued. A challenge passed. Such an instance never before occurred in the nation; nor has it ever occurred since.\n\nThe parties agreed !o meet at a certain cross path, where four roads intersect. They were to be armed at their own choice. Vann had a long French musquet, Falling a double bundled fowling piece; each were loaded with 21 buck shot; each well mounted.\n\nAt the hour fixed, each started at a full gallop. When they caught view of each other, each gave the war whoop, as they dashed onward. Their horses heads neatly struck together, ere they fired. The guns went off almost on the same instant. Vann's horse gave a slight dodge, and the charge grazed Vann as it passed. Falling dropped dead , ..\n\nIt caused much excitement and it was thought prudent that Vann should not be seen until the excitement could have time to cool.\n\nThe death went unavenged until February 21,1809. At this time there were loud complaints of the depredations committed in the nation by horse thieves, white and red, as well as other rogues, emanating from the whites upon the border. James Vann gathered some followers and paraded the country to punish the aggressors. They caught and flogged some of each complexion. Vann now returning from his judicial and patriotic expedition; and at Buffmgton's on the Etowah he stopped to wind up his adventures with a frolic. In the log hut tavern the interstices between the logs of which were open, he stood in the center of the group carousing. He had been at high words with some of his ancient associates-to Alexander Sanders, for one, he had been very abusive. The bottle was in one hand & he was lifting the cup of whiskey to his lips with the other. The door, which swung loosely, was silently pressed open by the point of a rifle. In an instant, James Vann was dead, and no one has ever known his slayer. He was buried at High Tower, near Blackburn's. The death of Falling by his hand had never been revenged and hence there was no search made to discover his own murderer.\n\nThe Moravian missionaries added that \"after hearing the shot, Joseph (James's son) and a Negro rapidly gathered up the belongings of father and son including Vann's \"pocketbook\" containing . . . cash and valuable bank notes. Wrapped in a blanket Joseph and the Negro fled to his father's plantation on the Chattahoo-chee River . . . Almost frightened to death, Mrs. Vann and her parents-in-law fled to Buffmgton's at dawn.\" The body had already been buried in an old nearby cemetery when they arrived.\n\nReaction to Vann's death was mixed. Mrs. Vann and \"Mother\" Vann were distraut for weeks as were other members of the Vann household. The missionaries wrote:\n\nThus ended the life of one who was feared by many and loved by few in the 41st year of his life ...\n\nVann had been an instrument in the hand of God for establishing our mission in this nation. Never in his wildest orgies had he attempted to harm us. We could not but commend his soul to God's mercy.\n\nThey had lost their \"greatest friend and benefactor.\"\n\nAccording to legend a rhyme was placed on his marker which said \"Here lies the body of James Vann who killed many a white man. At last by a rifle ball he fell and the Devil dragged his soul to Hell.\" Ebenezer Newton, the 1818 traveler, gave this report of the inscription: \"here lies the body of James Vann who departed this life Feb. 1809 aged 43. This man was once a Chief of the Cherokee Nation, and was considered a great man among them, and was very rich. But his greatness and his riches could not ward off the stroke of death.\n\nHe lies a monument of greatness lost and an evidence of the frailty & mutability of Man, whether he be white or red.\"\n\nJames Vann had expected to leave his vast holdings to his young son, Joseph, but the Council of Chiefs intervened to divide the property between his widow and all his children. Nevertheless, the 11-year-old Joseph inherited the bulk of his father's estate. Joseph grew up. married, and began his family as master of the Vann House. Upon reaching legal age, he received full title to the plantation and made many improvements in the house and on the land. He was an even better businessman than his father and won the nickname \"Rich Joe\" because he had a cousin also named Joseph who was not quite as wealthy. (The cousin was Teaultle or \"Big Joe.\") Rich Joe had been educated at the Moravian School and in South Carolina. At the young age of 16 he had joined other Cherokees and Americans under the command of Andrew Jackson to defeat the Creeks at Horseshoe Bend, Alabama, during the War of 1812. The \"Cherokee Croesus\" was a representative of the Coosawattee District (along with John Martin) in the Cherokee legislature. He was also a delegate to Washington. D.C., as the Indians sought governmental recognition. The 6-feet-6 man had two wives, Jennie Springston and Polly Black. His children were James Springston, Mary, John Shepherd, Delilah, Henry Clay, Sally, David, Nancy, William, Jane Elizabeth and Joe.\n\nIn 1819 Joseph entertained President James Monroe at Spring Place when the President made a trip through the South. Both James and Joseph left their doors open to any visitors and. like his father. Joseph also loved to drink, but apparently was not quite so beliggerent. Lewis Richardson, a descendant of an old area family and now a resident of Gainesville, wrote (his account of the presidential visit:\n\nThe tour of James Monroe through the Southeast and the Cherokee Nation in 1819 is of interest for two reasons. He was the firsl President to visit what is now Murray County and the travel arrangements, the size of the party and the lack of publicity is in startling contrast to similar Presidential tours today.\n\nMonroe made this southern joumey for three reasons. First, to review the defenses of the young nation along the coast and on the southern frontier; second, for political purposes. As do all politicians, he welcomed the chance to meet people and to promote the policies of his administration and his party. His last objective was to view the work of the Government and the private Missions in the Cherokee country. Monroe was a compassionate man and sympathized with the plight of the native Americans. He believed that with the help of tools and implements supplied by the Government, by teaching the older Indians the arts of agriculture and by educating the young, the Indian problem would cease to exist. On this trip he would see for himself how well his policies were working.\n\nThere were only (hree in the original group, the President; his secretary, Samuel Gouvernor and his military aide, Lt. Monroe, It was almost a family affair. Lt. Monroe was the son of the President's brother, Joseph, and, in the following year, Gouvernor would marry Hester Maria, the President's youngest daughter. In the course of the journey, this small group would be augmented by numerous politicians, military officers, office holders and assorted notables. Most would travel only a short distance and would be replaced by others in each new town.\n\nThe party left Washington, April 1, 1819 and proceeded to Savannah by slow stages. From the Georgia coast they went northwest through the State, arriving in Athens, May 21st, seven weeks from Washington. The next morning they traveled to Jefferson in Jackson County where they partook of a \"noon dinner\" provided by the citizens of the village.\n\nFrom this point they would follow the Federal Road into Tennessee. That afternoon, they crossed the Georgia State line and entered the Cherokee Nation. The Chattahoochee River was crossed at Vann's Ferry and they spent the night in the village on the west bank. The Ferry and the Tavern in the Indian village had been opened by James Vann about 1805. (The old Tavern building has been moved to New Echota State Park, near Calhoun,)\n\nThe 24th of May was spent in crossing present Forsyth County. That night they forded the Etowah River and slept at Lewis Blackburn's Tavern about a half mile west of the river. Ten years before, James Vann had been murdered near Blackburn's place and he is said to lest in the Blackburn Cemetery nearby.\n\nThe next day, the route was west, then north to the crossing of Long Swamp Creek, just east of Tate, in present Pickens County.\n\nOn the 26th, the travelers continued through Pickens County, passing the Indian village Of Sanderstown. They arrived in Spring Place late in the evening, unexpectedly, and the Moravians recorded the event:\n\nMay 25, 1819. Very late In the evening, Mr. James Monroe came with the overseer. Brodewell, to announce that the President of the United States and his party had arrived at Joseph Vann's. We were told by James Monroe that because so many were in his party that they did not wish to worry us for a night's lodging. The President had sent him to tell us thai he was in the neighborhood and that he would like to see Br. Gambald before the party leaves the next moming. The overseer asked for several lights for the company.\n\nThe \"Mr. Monroe\" was, of course, Lt. Monroe, The President's announced reason for not stopping at the Mission may be classed as a polite subterfuge. He was acquainted with Joe Vann, and the prospect of staying in the comfortable Vann home rather than the austere quarters of the missionaries is understandable. He did take time the next morning to inspect the Indian school and expressed his satisfaction with the work of the Brothers. There is no evidence of Federal aid having been offered or solicited. The Moravians were self sufficient.\n\nLater in the day, the party left Spring Place, going northwest to the old crossing of the Conasauga River, later known as the Chattanooga Ford. In present Whitfield County, they crossed the Coahulla Creek below the site of Prater's Mill and spent the next night at Richard Taylor's Tavern, just east of present Ringgold. Early the next afternoon, they arrived at Brainerd Mission, again unheraJded.\n\nThe party lefl Brainerd on May 27th and visited Winchester, Huntsville, Fayette-ville, Murfreesboro and Shelbyville before calling on Gen. Jackson at the Hermitage. They arrived in Nashville, June 13th.\n\nWhen they left the Tennessee Capitol, the route was north to Frankfort and Lexington, then east to Washington where they arrived on Sunday moming, the 8th of August. They had traveled about 5,000 miles in four months.\n\nThe long journey was unremarkable, except for the distinguished participants, for that period in our history. Two factors however, make it almost unbelievable by present-day standards. First, the trip was accomplished with so little attention. Newspapers of the day gave the President little space, even in those towns he was visiting. In fact, for the time between the departure of the group from Jefferson the arrival at Jackson's home near Nashville, the nation had no idea of the President's whereabouts.\n\nEven more astonishing, the four month junket cost the taxpayers nothing! In those days, \"Traveling Presidents sponged, like royalty, on the local gentry, (and) accepted free transportation from the mail contractors . . .\n\nSome say that Andrew Jackson, John C. Calhoun, and Sam Houston might have also visited Spring Place.\n\nBy the 1820's the Cherokees had discarded the traditional Indian clan system of ruling a tribe, with an indefinite number of clan and town chiefs making up the council. Instead, they patterned their government after that of the United States with a written constitution and a republican form of control with four delegates from each of the eight districts making up the National Council.\n\nThe capital was moved from Tennessee to New Echota, near present-day Calhoun in Gordon County, and since the Vanns lived on the major thoroughfare through the land, many of the visitors to Council at New Echota stopped at Vann's Town and Spring Place for refreshment. The Cherokees also had a written language, thanks to Sequoyah, and in 1826 established the only newspaper printed by an American Indian tribethe Cherokee Phoenix. The Cherokees were very advanced-thanks to leaders like the Vanns.\n\nBut all was not to last for the wealthy Vanns and their Cherokee brothers. Gold had been discovered in the mountains of North Georgia and the white citizens of Georgia began demanding immediate removal of the Indians so that they could take the gold from the Indians who had known of its existence for many decades. Georgia had surrendered its claim to western lands to the Federal government in 1802 with the concession that all Indians would be removed from its borders. The Creeks in South and Middle Georgia had been moved already, but until now no one had wanted the mountain land of the Cherokees. The demands of the State of Georgia now found a listener in Washington-Andrew Jackson. The Cherokees would be removed he said and the State began passing a series of laws extending its authority over the Cherokees.\n\nWithout waiting for the Federal government to remove the Cherokees, white Georgians began moving in to claim their property. Inevitably Joseph Vann and his fine home became involved in the \"land grab-\" At this time his holdings in Georgia included 800 acres of cultivated land, 42 cabins, eight com cribs, six barns, a sawmill, the grist mill, five smokehouses, a blacksmith shop, a foundary, a trading post, a peach kiln. 1,133 peach trees, 147 apple trees, a whiskey still, 110 slaves, and \"other property\" besides the house.\n\nIn the fall of 1833 Joseph left on a business trip, but before leaving he \"employed a Mr. Howell, a white man, to oversee for him in the year 1834to commence on the first day of January, 1834. He returned about the 28th or 29th of December. 1833, and learning that Georgia had prohibited any Cherokee from hiring a white man. told Mr. Howell he did not want his services. Yet Mr. Bishop, the State's agent, represented to the authorities of Georgia that Mr. Vann had violated the laws of that state by hiring a white man. had forfeited his right of occupancy and that a grant ought to issue for his lands.\"\n\nIn February, 1835, Bishop, who happened to command a militia unit of the \"Georgia Guard,\" arrived at Vann's with a detachment of soldiers to take possession of the house. A white boarder. Spencer Riley, claimed the house as his and a battle resulted between the rival claimants while the Vann family huddled within the house. Gunfire was exchanged before Bishop ordered that a small fire be built on the stairway to smoke out Riley. Riley left-for the time being!\n\nSince the winter was not yet over, the Vanns moved to a small farm Joseph owned near Ooletewah, Tennessee. They lived there until about 1836 and Vann built a racetrack where he raced his favorite horse \"Lucy Walker.\" The family then moved on to Indian Territory, Oklahoma, where Joseph began operating a steamboat line. Named for his racehorse, the boat had been docked at Ross's Landing (Chattanooga, Tennessee) when Vann lived in Georgia. Now the goods it carried helped the dispossessed merchant reaccumulate his wealth.\n\nAs early as 1834 Vann began legal proceedings against those who had taken his property. Though the case began in Murray County Superior Court, not until 1840 did he receive payment for his land-after his claim went to the Federal government. He received S19,60S for all his Georgia holdings; his Murray County property alone had been valued at over 518,000 in 1836. Nevertheless, according to the government, the claim was settled.\n\nThe Vanns made Webber Falls their Oklahoma residence and built a replica of the Spring Place mansion there. Unfortunately, Federal troops destroyed this western Vann House in 1863 during the War Between the States. However, by that time Joseph Vann, like his father, had met a tragic end.\n\nIn the fall of 1844 Vann went on what was both a business and a pleasure trip to Louisville, Kentucky. \"The Lucy Walker,\" under the command of Captain Hadderman, was laden with produce from Vann's plantations. After selling these goods and buying wood, coffee, gunpowder, calico, linen, etc. to take back to Oklahoma, Joseph, along with friends and business associates went to a horse race. Some say Vann's Lucy Walker was in the race and won. At any rate, Vann and his guests returned to the steamboat to celebrate.\n\nSoon. Joseph was drunk and in a rage quarrelled with Captain Hadderman over just who really ran the ship. As the return trip was about to begin, the captain, who had had enough, walked off the ship. Vann decided to be his own captain and ordered the vessel to set forth.\n\nVann's valet. Percy, was still serving drinks to his master's guests when another boat, the \"Firefly,\" eased past the \"Lucy Walker.\" To the intoxicated Vann, this marked the beginning of a race! He ordered that some salt pork be put on the fire to create more steam and slowly his own vessel passed the \"Firefly.\" However, the \"Lucy Walker\" had to stop at New Albany on the Indiana shore to let off some of the guests and the \"Firefly\" steamed past. When Vann's craft resumed the race, he ordered more steam. A servant, Nebuchadnezzar, protested that the boiler was taking all the steam it could, saying, \"But Massa' Vann, if I t'rows dat [more meat] in dere, dem b'ilers is goin' to splode an' blow us all to Hell!\" The angry, drunken, self-appointed captain replied, \"If they do, we'll all go together and if you don't I'll blow you there by yourself!\" \"Nebby\" threw the meat on the fire, jumped overboard, and by his account was the only survivor of the explosion which occurred seconds later. Some bodies, including that of Vann's youthful son-in-law Preston Mackey were recovered, but not Joseph Vann's.\n\nMeanwhile the Vann House in Spring Place was suffering through rough times. Captain Bishop took possession of the place, and then rented it to his brother, Absalom. The actual owner of the house was Revolutionary War veteran Thomas Turley of Warren County who had drawn lot 224 (9th District, 3rd Section) in the land lottery. Mr. Turley died soon after and in 1837 the administrators of his estate, J.R. and Jane Brooks, authorized none other than Spencer Riley to sell the Vann property for them. At last Riley got the upper hand over the Bishops! He sold the 160-acre lot to Alexander Shotwell of Decatur County and then purchased the house, kitchen, barn, orchards, and one-third of the land from Shotwell for himself.\n\nBarely a year later Riley sold his prize to a Roger McCarthay who in 1840 surrendered title to the Bank of the State of Georgia. For the next decade the Bank officially owned the house but several people occupied it. Apparently at one time it was a sort of hotel. George Wacaser lived in the house once as did the Charles Warmacks (1846). Joseph B. Smith also tried to purchase the house during this era. Finally in January, 1S49 the Bank deeded the house to Benjamin Snider and Henry Weed.\n\nBy 1852 James Edmondson. who had come to Murray County very early, owned the house. For the next 11 years the home was once again the center of an extensive plantation as former Edmondson slave Levi Branham recorded in his My Life and Travels years later. During the Civil War Mr. Edmondson refugeed to South Georgia after selling the Vann property to William H. Tibbs, a Tennessee Confederate of some means who had recently arrived in Spring Place and had begun to accumulate large land holdings.\n\nIn 1866 Tibbs deeded the Vann House to his son and daughter-in-law. Jacob and Lavinia. They used the house as rental property at least part of the time for the Stephen John Howard family occupied the house in 1873. John Bryant bought the place in 1875 and sold it 2 years later to Oscar and Esther Coins.\n\nThe Coins couple resided in the house for some years and for some time it even look the name \"Coins Hill.\" During their ownership the outside kitchen, dating back to the Vann era. was dismantled. Some say that it also was a two-story brick house smaller and not as well built as the Vann House, Its second floor had lately been used for a ballroom. The Coins built a one-story frame building on the same spot and added a kitchen to the north side of the Vann House. They also constructed a large barn west of the house (across the road).\n\nOn the interior, Mrs. Coins is said to have sold some of the hinges for $5 a set and removed some original carvings of scorpions, snakes, lizards, and frogs from tops of mantels.\n\nMrs Thomas (Nannie) Dill, a friend of the Coins family, became the owner Of the Vann House in October, 1895. From 1901 until 1906 Mr. C.T. Owens technically owned the house although Mrs. Dill continued to live there for a time Mr. D.D. Kemp bought the house in 1906 and his family moved in the following year. C.E. Dooley was me owner from 1914 until 1917 and sold it to jW Sellers. Dr. J.E. Bradford, who bought the house in 1920, owned the house longer than anyone-even the Vanns. Dr. Bradford used the house for rental purposes as had several of the earlier owners. Countless people occupied tile house during this era. Among those remembered are the W.L. Roberts, W.G. Blassingame, Pritchett. John Cox (1927-30), Jim Jones (1926), Morrison (1940's), and Jase Jones (1945) families.\n\nOver the years all the Vann plantation buildings had disappeared and the porches on the house itself had been changed several times. By 1950 the house was in very poor condition. The roof was gone; parts of the floor had collapsed; the brick arches over the doors had cracked; and every window pane had been shattered by vandals. Therefore, various groups began discussing the possibilities of restoring the Vann House as a shrine to the Cherokees.\n\nThe Chatsworth Lions Club sent a committee to see Dr. Bradford in hopes of obtaining an option to purchase the house if Bradford were not going to restore it himself After the committee was turned down, V.C. Pickering, a state official, offered to buy the place. He too was refused. Then in 1948 a Chamber of Commerce which became Chatsworth Enterprises, was founded. The group's officers, consisting of President J.T. (Dick) Kenemer, Vice President Charles A. Pannell. Sr and Secretary-Treasurer R.E. Chambers, comprised a Vann House Restoration Committee. For 2 years these men tried to interest Dr. Bradford in a plan to restore the rapidly deteriorating Vann House, but could not do so. Finally Mr Pannell contacted members of the Georgia Historical Society feeling that outside help would convince Dr. Bradford to sell the property.\n\nDr. A.R. Kelly of the University of Georgia Department of Anthropology and Archeology and consultant Dr. Joe Mahan met with the committee, examined the Vann House, and agreed that Dr. Kelly would talk with Dr. Bradford. When the two met, Dr. Bradford explained why he had refused earlier offers. The Doctor felt that those groups which were financially able to carry out the project were more interested in making a profit than in preserving the landmark and that those who cared the most did not have the resources needed. He had been particularly bothered by a proposal by a Dalton group which said \"The Vann House, in its present location, would never pay back its restorers. Therefore , . . recommended that it be moved and restored at Dalton, which needs an outstanding tourist attraction, and could commercialize on this property ...\" The plan would have made the Vann House a drawing card to sell bedspreads! Dr. Bradford told Dr. Kelly that he would consider the new proposal.\n\nIn the meantime Mrs. Sidney H. (Gertrude) Ruskin of Decatur, a leader in the District Womans Club, unaware of the efforts already underway, called a public meeting for October 10, 1951 for the purpose of acquiring the Vann House. Held at Atlanta's Henry Grady Hotel, the meeting was attended by a large delegation from North Georgia and prominent Atlanta people, including Ivan Allen, Sr. a native of Dalton whose ancestors had lived in Spring Place. The result of this meeting was that the committee, now including Dr. Kelly, could arrange for an option to purchase the Vann House in the name of the Georgia Historical Commission, newly created by the Legislature to take important landmarks out of private hands for public ownership.\n\nDr. Kelly visited Dr. Bradford on December 27, 1951 and left with a handwritten \"Memorandum of Agreement for option for Purchase of Vann House:... It is agreed that the owner will give an option to purchase of this property for the cash payment of six thousand dollars, of which the owner will give one thousand dollars. It is further agreed that the owner will be paid five hundred dollars in^advance, to be applied on the purchase price, at the time the option is signed.\" The first $500 was raised in Murray County and on January 3, 1952 the option was signed.\n\nDuring the next six months many people across the state worked many hours to raise the needed 4,500. Dr. Kelly worked in Athens, Mrs. Ruskin, Mrs. Kooert Jones, and Mr. Allen in the Atlanta area, and Miss Agnes Kemp, a one-time Vann House resident, in Spring Place. Her students pooled their nickels to make a contribution to the cause.\n\nMr. Chambers and Mr. T.W. Kenemer called a meeting of interested citizens in Dalton on February 19. 1952. This meeting resulted in the formation of the Whit field-Murray Historical Society, Mrs. B.J. Bandy of Dalton was elected president and became the driving force behind the Vann House Restoration. She was joined by Mr. Kenemer, Odell Ingle, Mrs. W.M. Sapp, Mrs. A.K. Gregory, Miss Mary Louise Horan. Blanche Gardner, and the original committee in fund-raising efforts. They got an extension on the deadline, but made the $4,500 payment only 2 days late. On July S, 1952 the Vann House and three acres of land became the property of the State of Georgia. The restoration began.\n\nAfter making emergency repairs the Historical Commission and the Historical Society began researching to find information about the house and its original owners. From April through June, 1953 Clemens de Baillou conducted an archeological investigation at the Vann House. Brick walkways were uncovered along with signs of a kitchen, a guesthouse, and an office to the east of the house. In 1956 a 120-year-old cabin of Indian origin was reconstructed on the site of the Vann \"harness and tack\" shop. South of the house were a blacksmith shop and stables as well as a garden. Slave cabins were probably located farther south. The carriage drive was uncovered on the north side and marked the original entrance to the house. The site of the brick kilns where the bricks for the house were made was uncovered near the Bradford Spring.\n\nSince the Vann House was the first project either of the historical groups had undertaken, progress on the house itself was slower. Odell Ingle was selected to be the contractor for the repairs as designed by restoration architect Henry Forman of Easton. Maryland. Frum a painting of the house as it was in 1884, the men learned that the house had originally had gabled porches though later owners had changed them several times. The porches were rebuilt; the more recent kitchen addition was removed; plaster was replaced; missing hinges and locks were reproduced; damaged flooring was replaced; broken glass was replaced; and original doors, trim and wainscoting were copied. Interior decorator Marjorie Rhodes spent hours scraping through layers of paint and wallpaper (19 in some places) to find the original colors of the woodwork. The house was then repainted with the colors of nature-blue for the sky, green for the grass and trees, yellow for ripened grain, and red for the rich Georgia clay. A safety rod was added to the mysterious hanging or floating stairway, the oldest example of cantilevered construction in Georgia, but workmen did not discover the secret of the stairway which originally had no visible means of support. Cherokee Roses adorn the house both inside and out.\n\nFurnishing the house was not an easy task. Franco Scalamandre of New York's Scalamandre Silk Mills donated $10,000 worth of fabric for draperies and upholstery. Ivan Allen donated several pieces of furniture from the old Chester Inn in Spring Place. Other pieces were purchased or donated and loaned by other individuals. Finally by July 27, 1958 the house was ready for a great day of dedication. Some 42 descendants of the Vann family and dignitaries from across the country gathered on the hill to hear addresses by Secretary of State Ben Fortson and Governor Marvin Griffin. More than 6,000 people visited the house that day.\n\nIn the course of the restoration and during research since that time, many important facts about the house have been uncovered and legends proven false. The bricks were made on the farm; only the glass had to be brought from Savannah. According to tradition James Vann had visited England, Charleston, Boston. New York, and Savannah where he saw the type of furnishings he wanted. Robert Howell, an Englishman, was the brick mason. Moravian missionaries Byhan and Schneider, both excellent craftsmen, helped build the house. Their influence is particularly evident in the Christian doors whose top contains a cross and whose bottom represents an open Bible. There is no secret passageway from the third floor to the basement and the third floor coffin-shaped rooms were bedrooms for the children, not secret council rooms. The only secret compartments in the house are drawers beneath two windows in the dining room which were used for storing silver and tableware. The basement was sometimes used as a prison for slaves that misbehaved while another room was a storage area and wine cellar.\n\nMrs. Bandy hoped to find the grave of James Vann and move the remains to Spring Place. Mrs. Heard of Forsyth County remembered seeing the grave as a child. Located in the Blackburn cemetery near the tavern where Vann was killed, the cemetery was later used as a Negro burial ground. In 1959 Mrs. Heard had described the area where the grave was. Three years later Mrs. Bandy, Raymond Vann (a descendant), and two experienced excavators looked for the exact spot. Eventually a grave site was found and excavated. Several buttons, nails, screws, a buckle, and two rings were found along with the skeleton. Authorities with the Historical Commission examined the evidence and felt that the remains were those of a male, but were much too recent to be those of James Vann. Mrs. Bandy was firmly convinced that they were the remains of Mr. Vann and buried a small box of the Forsyth County ashes at the Vann House, a small disiance southwest of the reconstructed cabin.\n\nAnother accomplishment of the early preservationists was the designation of Georgia 225 between Spring Place and Calhoun as the \"Chief Joseph Vann Highway,\" The authorizing legislation was passed in 1955 under the sponsorship of Representatives Fred Long of Murray County and Henry Mauldin of Gordon County.\n\nDr. Bradford once estimated that the cost of building the Vann House was about $10,000. Excluding the purchase price, the initial restoration bills totaled at least $75,000. Since 1958 several improvements have been made at the beautiful historic site which has been under the operation of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Parks and Historic Sites Division since the Historical Commission was abolished in 1973. Soon after the dedication additional furniture reproductions were placed in the house and in 1962 a log kitchen was reconstructed just east of the house. Due to structural and historical problems the building was dismantled in 1965. In 1968 five more acres of land were purchased from the Bradford Estate and in 1985 fifteen additional acres, including the springs, were obtained. Lightning protection was installed in 1973 and in that same decade a security system, window light shields, new draperies and upholstery, and further landscaping were added to the house and site. A climate-control system designed to preserve the house and furniture has since been installed. Several paint jobs and repair work have kept the National Register of Historic Places site looking grand. In 1981 the house was included in a Georgia Historic Homes cookbook and has been featured in countless periodicals and on television and radio. Mr. R.E, Chambers donated his papers relating to the purchase and restoration to the site in 1978.\n\nVisitation at the Vann House has consistently ranked in the top four of all Georgia Historic Sites. Several special programs have brought additional attention to the Vann House in recent years. For several years students from Spring Place Elementary School performed a drama highlighting President Monroe's visit and the eviction of the Vanns. C.L. Dunn and Frances Townsend directed these plays. In 1978 two annual events were begun-Vann House Days in July in commemoration of the restoration and the Moravian Christmas featuring candlelight tours. Local volunteers and groups such as the Garden Club, Woman's Club, the Sheriffs Auxiliary, and the Historical Society have contributed to the success of these programs. Lela Latch Lloyd who authored the book // The Chief Vann House Could Speak frequently visits the site and meets some of the 14.000 guests who enter the gate each year. R.E. Ellis was the first curator of the Vann House. Present Superintendent James E. Hall and his wife Pat have cared for the site and greeted guests for 15 and 20 years respectively. Others who have worked at the site for several years are Mildred Ellis, France Adams, and Tim Howard.\n\nToday, the Federal-style mansion boasts a sleigh bed from Carters Quarter, a table that is said to have been used by Alexander Stephens and novelist Will Harbin, a canopy bed that was possibly owned by General P.G.T. Beauregard.a corner cabinet and chair from the pioneer Bates family, an 1825 Rosewood piano loaned by Inez Gurley, and a reproduction of Chief John Ross's dining room table, a gift of Mr. & Mrs. R.G. McCamy of Dalton. The Vann House has often been called me \"Showplace of the Cherokee Nation\" and it is certainly that. However, it is more; it's the Showplace of Murray County.\n\n-Chapter I-\n\nThe Moravian Mission\n\nWhether the project was house building, canal constructing, road building or any other project, James and Joseph Vann were certain to be involved. However, their greatest contribution to the Cherokees was their sponsorship of the Moravian Mission at Spring Place. Dedicated missionaries labored in the Cherokee Nation for more than three decades and from their diaries we have much information about the days before Murray County was drawn on the map.\n\nThe Moravian Church traces its origin to the pre-Reformation awakening led by John Hus and was formally organized as the Unity of the Brethren in 1457. Because much of its early history centered in Moravia the Brethren's Church later came to be called the Moravian Church. Persecution and wars reduced the Brethren to a few scattered remnants in Central Europe until 1722 when the church was revived in Saxony. Within 10 years the reorganized Moravians launched into a world-wide foreign mission program.\n\nAmong the teachings and practices of the Moravian church include Infant Baptism. Confirmation, and missions. It is a Protestant church with evangelical emphasis on salvation through faith in Jesus Christ as personal Savior. Subscribing to the Apostle's Creed, the Moravian Church is life-centered rather than creed-centered, however. Noted for beautiful music, love feasts, and historic preservation, the Moravians follow the motto; \"In essentials unity; in non-essentials liberty; in all things charity.\"\n\nChristian charity brought the Moravians to Georgia with James Edward Oglethorpe in 1735. When war broke out between the colonists and the Spanish in Florida, the Moravians resettled in Pennsylvania in 1740. Some of the group returned to the South in 1753 and made North Carolina their home. By the end of that century Salem and Wachovia had become thriving Moravian communities.\n\nIn 1784 Martin Schneider had tried to begin a work among the Cherokees, but the chiefs, busy with other matters, did not have time to discuss the mission with him. By 1799 the Cherokees were more open and the Society for Propagating the Gospel at Salem appointed Abraham Steiner to visit the Indian leaders. Christian Frederic de Schweinitz volunteered to go with him, but when they reached the Cherokee capital in Tennessee, the chiefs were on a hunting expedition. The next year the two men were more successful. Through the influence of Charles Hick, a half-blood interpreter, and James Vann, the ministers were granted permission to establish the long-desired mission on land provided by Mr. Vann.\n\nIn 1801 Rev. Steiner and young Gottleib Byhan rode horseback to Spring Place to begin the first mission in a small cabin built with their own hands. Three months later a Mr. Brown vacated his farm and the brethren moved there. Due to the longevity of the mission, the meticulous ministers accumulated volumes of records now in the Moravian Archives at Salern. Some of the materials have never been translated from the original German. However. Records of the Moravians in North Carolina by Adelaide Fries, Edmund Schwarze's History of the Moravian Missions Among Southern Indian Tribes, and the Spring Place Mission Diaries translated by Carl Mauelshagen tell us the story of the mission and the Cherokees of Murray County.\n\nThe Moravians began their diaries with many descriptions of the geographic and natural features of the area. In addition to identifying the various springs, the writers listed the many types of plants and trees which grew in the area. In early days the name was often spelled in one word-Springplace-but as the years passed many people, particularly the white men, changed the name to Spring Place.\n\nAdditional information about the Vanns and other Indians is given, such as the fact that the due] between James Vann and John Falling occurred near Spring Place. Falling and his wife Nancy lived near Coosawattee where several Indian ballgames were held. After Falling's death, Nancy married George Harlan, another Coosawattee Indian resident. Also, several Indians and whites made \"Sumach Town\" their home. Among them were Edmund Falling, Charles Hicks, and \"Doctor\" Bean-a white man who was a self-taught physician.\n\nThe Brethren were as amazed (or confused) by the Vann family tree as many present-day genealogists. The Moravians mention many Vanns by name and record that Wawli, James Vann's mother, had several sisters, while Clement Vann had at least one. Jenny. Wawli also had several daughters besides Nancy Falling, including Jenny Brown who lived near the mission for a time. Also noted is that as James built his new house, his mother, who had been living near the construction site, planned to move 3 miles away!\n\nThe brethren recorded that Joseph Vann entered their school in 1806 but often accompanied his father on trips and therefore was absent a great deal. After James' death. Margaret Scott Vann, Joseph's mother, moved away from the brick mansion to a new house about 1 mile away. Later she married Joseph Crutchfield. her former husband's overseer, and moved to Montjoy, a plantation south of Spring Place. After her death, Mr. Crutchfield left Montjoy. By this time. Joseph (described as a behavior problem by the missionaries) had two wives. Jenny lived at Spring Place while Polly resided at Montjoy.\n\nThe Moravians were extremely dedicated to their work, to the Cherokees, and to God. They labored long hours and were hampered by language difficu ties. Several interpreters helped them, but services were often canceled when no one who knew both English and Cherokee was present. Many times Negro slaves were the only ones who understood the sermons. Negroes regularly attended Moravian services, particularly at Christmas. According to tradition the Moravians possibly had the first Christmas tree in Georgia at Spring Place in 1805.\n\nThe names of many visitors to Spring Place are recorded in the diaries. Some were curious Indians, others were white travelers on the Old Federal Road, many were residents of the Spring Place area, and some were employees of the Vanns. Among the Cherokees who visited were Chulea (an early supporter of the school), MacDonald from Coosawattee, Bear. Red Bird, Sour Mush, Fish, several Hickses, Standing Turkey, Tussiwaliti, Major Ridge. Dear Head, Little Broom, Squirrel, Bark, and the Flea. Major Lovely, the Markhams, Mr. Geiger, John Miller, Indian Agents Return Jonathan Meigs and Hugh Montgomery, a Vann blacksmith named Hall, Clarks, and Mr. McNair were among the white and mixed-blood visitors. Additional Vann overseers are mentioned including Tynor, Bridewell, Gann, Josiah Vann. and George Brown, as administrator of James Vann's will.\n\nMany visitors were itinerant ministers of various faiths. Some came to Spring Place to examine the Moravian work prior to beginning a mission of their own. Others were merely curious, but the Brethren were happy to see anyone who \"loved the Savior\" and spoke English. These visits were probably the most welcome of any of the thousands they received. Among the notable religious visitors were a former Jewish rabbi, an Episcopal priest, a Quaker elder, and several Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists like Samuel Worcester and Cyrus Kingsbury of the \"American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions\" which began a work at Spring Place about 1817. Two famous Baptists were Jesse Bushyhead, a native, and Humphrey Posey, who spent some months in the Murray area.\n\nThe Moravians were called upon to feed these \"guests\" as well as the various Indians who came for assistance and instruction. They performed baptisms for travelers and became a haven for the poor, the families of men who were away on trips, and the ill. Many times school was dismissed so that pupils could help the Brethren tend the crops. They raised sheep, flax, hogs, oats, wheat and sweet potatoes in large quantities. Several times the Mission Board at Salem sent extra household and farm laborers. More than one missionary felt as if they were operating an inn!\n\nThe day at Spring Place began in winter at day break, in summer at sunrise, all up and dressed and kneeling in family prayer. Breakfast over, school was in session until dinner. The hours until late afternoon were spent working in the houses or on the farm, with some time allowed for play. Another school session followed by supper, evening songs, prayer, and an early bedtime completed the day. One historian noted that \"Moravian Mission dwellings and premises were always noted for spotless cleanliness and well kept appearance.\"\n\nThe curriculum of the school included reading, grammar, writing, sacred history, mathematics, geography, weaving, and botany. Music was also important and. when interpreters were scarce, music was the line of communication. In later years the mission had a piano but several missionaries possessed musical talents. Jacob Wohlfahrt played the trumpet and Christian Burkhardt the clarinet, while Henry Clauder and Karsten Petersen were violinists. Gottlieb Byhan is thought to have built and played the first organ in what is now Georgia. He was also a trombonist.\n\nSeveral Spring Place students went to the Salem Female Academy and several future chiefs left Spring Place for further education in Cornwell, Connecticut. Among them were John Ridge, John Vann, Buck Watie (Elias Boudinot), and David Taucheechy who visited in Salem and Washington, D.C.\n\nMission founder Abraham Steiner (born 1758) had several attacks of fever and was not able to stay at Spring Place very long, but continued to visit regularly. Gottlieb Byhan (born 1777 in Saxony, died in Salem 1861) and his wife Dorthea Schneider (1769-1854) were the first Moravians to be regularly in charge of the Spring Place Mission. They began the diaries which were continued by their successor and which yield the following chronology of interesting, noteworthy events:\n\n1802 - Jacob (175S-1807) and Elizabeth (1759-1812) Wohlfahrt came to assist the Byhans.\n\nSchool opened with two pupils: Sally Vann and her cousin Polly, with one hour of instruction per day. Progress slow, chiefs more interested in the 3 R's than in the Trinity, and put the mission \"on trial.\"\n\n1803 -Two cabins built\n\n1804 - More land cleared Nathaniel Byhan born\n\n1805 - Rev. John and Anna Rosel Kleist Gambold arrive to replace the Wohlfahrts, This devoted couple gave the rest of their lives to the Chetokees, remaining at Springplace for 16 years. Several descriptions of their work reveal the extent of their labors:\n\n\"Rev. & Mrs. Gambold made (he ... mission famous for their hospitality and kindness to strangers and their earnest zeal for the education and Christianization of the Cherokees. Mrs, Gambold was a good botanist. She furnished and correctly named about fourteen hundred botanical specimens to Henry Steinhauer, a distinguished scholar of Fulneck, England.\n\nCorrea de Serra, a Catholic abbe'. Minister to Portugal from the United States and a naturalist, after spending a day and night at Spring Place, wrote as follows: \"Judge of my surprise, in the midst of the wilderness, to find a botanic garden, containing many exotic and medicinal plants, the professor, Mrs, Anna Rosel Gambold, describing them by their Linnean names. Your missionaries have taught me more of the nature of the manner of promulgating civilization and religion in the early ages by the missionaries from Rome, than all the ponderous volumes which I have read on the subject. I there saw the sons of a Cherokee Regulus learning the lessons, and reading their New Testaments in the morning and drawing and painting in the afternoon, though to be sure in a very Cherokee style; and assisting Mrs. Gambold in her household work, or Mr. Gambold in planting com.\n\nTraveler Ebenezer Newton wrote in 1818:\n\n... we came to Mr. Gambold's, a Moravian missionary in the Cherokee Nation; he said he had been established there now 13 years. He appears to be a very pious man, and zealously engaged in the laudable employment of endeavoring to enlighten & civilize the Indians. He has had some success, and seems very sanguine as to the ultimate success of the important business of Christianizing the natives.\n\nTo relate how our company was received by this aged man and his lady exceeds my powers of description. The good lady used all the politeness and put on all the airs of a French Lady just from the city of Paris. She is, I believe very pious, and wishes to be useful, and has been useful, to the Indians. She was not willing that we should depart, untill she had prepared some refreshment for us. In the meantime while this was preparing, the male part of the company took a turn or two into the gardens, the work shop and some other things about the lot & yard.\n\nIn due time the repast was prepared, and we were invited in to partake of it. The table was spread & covered with eatables. A dish of bacon occupied one end, next a plate of bread, after that a dish of stewed pumpkins and a pan of butter occupied the centre; towards the other end a dish of smoked beef chipped, then another plate of bread & a vessel of pickled cucumbers, which were nearly as large as stuffed chickens. By the side of each one's plate was a large bowl or mug of tea with a spoon that each one may sweeten to his own liking\n\nA later historian wrote:\n\n.Brother Gambold's optimism and purely consecrated spirit were the inspiration dvanced this cause. He had charge of all religious instruction and services besides temporal affairs, taking an active part in the labor of the mission home and Every Moravian' Brother was truly a missionary in spiritual matters; at the same he was also skilled in some vocation either as carpenter, joiner, cooper, weaver, or shoemaker. Mission work included careful instruction and training of pupils and converts in Christian life, besides giving due attention to their temporal interests and needs which built up \"the physical, moral, and spiritual life of the native community 'thus making \"its good influence contagious.\"\n\nMrs Gambold had charge of the school at Springplace. She has been described as ...sprightly in person as well as in fancy and imagination\" with the gift of making the hearts of her Indian pupils \"blossom like the rose,\" Her first Christmas at the mis-'on a few weeks after her coming, six children in the school under her direction sang \"How shall I Meet My Savior?,\" each child carrying a real wax taper. They had helped to decorate the room with evergreens and a gilded inscription \"Christ is Born! \" Thus, many years before festivities had been made a usual part of the Christmas celebration in the States, these Cherokee girls and boys had learned old-time Moravian customs. Mrs. Gambold was a highly talented woman who had previously been for a number of years, principal of the Moravian Boarding school for young ladies in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\n\nMrs. Gambold had another claim to fame. She had once met George Washington and had been given a lock of his hair. She gave the souvenir to Abijah Conger a Presbyterian missionary who married at Spring Place in 1823. Mrs. Gambold became the next diarist.\n\n1806 - \"Many Indians coming for food,\" 8 pupils. 3 living at mission and 5 at Vann's.\n\n1807 - Sophia Dorothea Byhan born in October.\n\nChristian Burkhardt and Karsten Petersen, master craftsman, make an extended visit and build a loom,\n\n1808 - Rev. Gambold's brother Joseph (born 1753) sent to help with fanning. Missionaries now held in great esteem by Cherokees.\n\n1809-7 scholars; big Christmas celebration\n\n1810 - The widowed Margaret Vann, a year after her husband's murder, becomes the first Christian convert among the Cherokees. Her baptism took place on August 13th in the large new barn-the only building big enough to hold the crowd. This description was left by Mrs. Gambold:\n\nThe Candidate had spent most of the preceding night in prayer. She was radiantly happy when the great morning of her life dawned, and the light in her face on that morn was prophetic of the Sun of Righteousness arising with healing jn His wings upon the whole Cherokee Nation. Dressed in white, she entered before the Urge congregation and the service began. The school children sang heartily with their teachers and Brother Gambold delivered a short, earnest address and poured out his heart in prayer to God for the Candidate, the whole assemblage, the entire Cherokee Nation. Many persons wept during the service, early from her heart Margaret answered the questions directed to every Candidate for Baptism in the Moravian Church, whereupon she knelt and was baptised by Brother Gambold, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, receiving the name Margaret Ann.\"\n\nSpringplace, though struggling, was the only school in the Cherokee Nation.\n\n1811 - June: grain scarce, no mills operating.\n\nDecember 16 & 17 - \"earth tremors\" shook Springplace\n\n1812 - Margaret Vann marries Joseph Crutchfield.

During this Silver Anniversary year 42 souls were under the care of Spring Place. Rev. Theodore Schultz visited and left this description\n\n\"Spring Place, located six hundred steps from the main road between Nashville and the interior of Georgia, is barely three miles from the Tennessee road leading to Georgia. It is a healthful location, good soil, plenty of woods, good pasturage and wonderful springs. The mission buildings area blockhouses, placed in a square, enclosing a yard. The church stands fifty steps from the dwellings. The yard is very pretty with cherry trees, china trees, catalpa, peach and apple trees. There is an orchard in fine condition, in the midst of which lies the graveyard.\"\n\nDecember: Church bell was rung for first time. It's clear tone can be heard for several miles. (This is probably the bell now on display at the Vann House and was given to the mission by Joseph Vann.)\n\n1827 - The Schmidts transfer to Oothcaloga and the Byhans along with their son, Nathaniel, and daughter, Rachel return. Nathaniel was schoolmaster. January 20, Longtime leader, member, and chief Charles R. Hicks died and according to his own wishes he was brought to Spring Place for burial.

Disturbances between the Cherokees and whites increased, soldiers arrived, two forts were built, the Indians were removed, land was surveyed, and white government was established.\n\nGoff gave additional information about the western fork of the Road from Ramhurst as follows:\n\n... the left branch leads northwest by historic Spring Place in Murray County toward Chattanooga. No one living along its course now seems to remember it as a Federal route; generally it is referred to as the \"Old Chattanooga Road,\" although in rare instances a few old timers recall it as the \"Georgia Road.\" The last is its oldest name, under which the government first sought a passageway through the Cherokee country. At Spring Place the road bore to the north of the village and the majestic old Vann house that stands just notth of that place.\n\nA stretch of the early trail is missing along here, But it takes up again at Free Hope Church Crossroads, northwest of Spring Place, and runs straight north to the Old Chattanooga l-ord below the mouth of Mill Creek on Conasauga River. The ford is no longer used, but the former trace is still there.\n\nThe road then went through Whitfield County.\n\nThe Old Federal Road soon became the major post and stagecoach route in the Cherokee Nation. A stage began running through Spring Place as early as '825 and by 1833 regularly ran to Athens, Tennessee. A post office had been established at Spring Place earlier.\n\nAnother important event during this era was the beginning of a canal system in Georgia. Designed to improve \"internal\" transportation, these canals were very ambitious undertakings, but the canal era did not last long due to the coming of railroad and almost none were even begun in Georgia. However, \"the Conasauga River was once a busy artery of commerce and was twice considered as part of a canal system,\" according to historian Lewis Richardson. One proposal was for the River to become a portion of Georgia's Northwest Canal. \"In 1825. Wilson Lumpkin and State Engineer Hamilton Fulton led an exploratory party through the area and selected the river as the best route.\" The Cherokees refused to permit the canal building at that time or in 1826 and 1827 when the Tennessee General Assembly chartered the Hiwassee Canal Company. Plans were drawn to connect the Conasauga with the Ocoee River by means of 15 locks spaced over 10 miles. However the canals were not to be.\n\nReturn to TOP of page! -Chapter II-\n\nMurray County's Early Years\n\nThe 1830's were troubled years in Murray. This decade saw the Moravian Mission close, a Cherokee Land Lottery, the Trail of Tears, military rule in Spring Place, a hanging in Murray County, innocent people arrested, bloodshed at local elections, and the beginnings of white rule in an Indian land. This era's story is not easy to record.\n\nAs the decade began the Moravian brethren found themselves in a precarious position. In early 1831 Georgia passed a law saying that al! white males living within the Cherokee Nation without a license or permit from the governor or Indian agent must take an oath to the State of Georgia or they would be imprisoned at hard labor for 4 years. However, Moravians did not take oaths or take part in political affairs, but \"went about the Master's business.\" The Oothcaloga mission closed. Reminger left, and then the Clauders and Sister Gambold were ordered out of Georgia. The news of the death of Joseph Gambold in Friedland, NC, caused even more sadness. Gambold had labored at Spring Place for almost 20 years.\n\nMany white men were thus forced out of the Cherokee Nation. Only those who chose to obey the Georgia law and Brother Byhan who was the Federally appointed postmaster were allowed to stay. Other missionaries went to McNair's just inside Tennessee while some returned to North Carolina. The Spring Place congregation then numbered 71. The Moravian diarist of 1831 noted that the mission's guest facility \"was more like a public inn\" and by December even other religious groups called Spring Place \"Pilgrim's Rest.\"\n\nA Colonel Nelson was sent to Sumach town where \"Bean\" and others were arrested. Fort Gilmer was also mentioned and in the fall a Lieutenant Brooks arrived in Spring Place with a company of soldiers. Several mixed-blood Cherokees from the area signed to go to Arkansas, but some stayed and even dared to try to mine gold. This angered the white men even more.\n\nThe new year began ominously with a 6-inch snow on January 29; 1832 would be a hard one for both Indians and whites. Byhan left Spring Place and Henry Clauder was allowed to return as postmaster. His wife, the former Sophia Dorothea Ruede, was in charge of the school when classes resumed. In April, surveyors for the State of Georgia appeared and even though the Georgia Guard was at Sumach the missionaries saw conditions worsen. Laws were lax and there was much theft. \"Georgia abrogated Indian law, but doesn't bring in anything else.\" wrote the brethren. Then, in December, men appeared at Spring Place and told the devoted Moravians about the land lottery and that they now lived in Murray County, Georgia.\n\nThe Georgia Laws of 1832 said:.... And be it further enacted, That such parts of the twenty-seventh, twenty-sixth, twenty-fifth and twenty-fourth districts of the second section, as lie west of the lines here-in-before designated, and the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-eighth districts of the third section, and the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, eighteenth and nineteenth districts of the fourth section, shall form and become one county, to be called Murray . ..\n\nAnd be it farther enacted by the authority aforesaid, That on the first Monday in Much next, the persons who may be resident in said counties, entitled to vote for members of the Legislature, may meet together at the several places herein-after designated in their respective counties, and under the superin ten dance of three suitable and capable persons, elect five justices of the Inferior Court, a clerk of the Superior and Inferior courts, a Sheriff, a Tax Collector, a Tax Receiver and a county Surveyor, and Coroner for each county-who shall hold their respective offices, for and during the time hereinafter prescribed in the seventeenth section of this act.\n\nAnd be it further enacted, That the placed of holding elections for said counties, shall be as follows: ...\n\nIn the county of Murray, at New Echota ...\n\nAnd be it further enacted.
