        "text": "A guide on the most beautiful buildings in Athens, by the team at Greeklist.\n\n1. The rebirth of Athens during the 19th century\n\nAthens’ story in the early 19th century is one of phoenix-like rise from the ashes. Following centuries of Ottoman rule and a devastating yet succesful War for Independence, the city lay in ruins. Yet, from this rubble emerged a fervent nationalistic spirit and a grand vision for the future. King Otto, the first king of Greece, was an admirer of Ancient Greece, so se chose Athens as the nations capital. Many famous European architects where invited to renovate Athens. One of the defining characteristics of 19th-century Athenian architecture is Neoclassicism, inspired by the art and architecture of ancient Greece and Rome and was seen as a way to connect the new Greek state with its glorious past.\n\n2. What is Neoclassical architecture?\n\nA grand revival took hold in 18th-19th century architecture with Neoclassicism. This movement looked back to the grandeur of ancient Greece and Rome for inspiration. Buildings like Athens’ House of Parliament showcase the style’s hallmarks: clean lines, perfect symmetry, and the incorporation of elements like Doric columns. Neoclassical architects aimed for a sense of order and reason, reflecting the Enlightenment ideals of the time. This focus on balance stood in stark contrast to the more playful and ornate Rococo style that preceded it. Historical themes and mythology were often referenced, adding a layer of intellectual depth to these architectural statements\n\n3.
