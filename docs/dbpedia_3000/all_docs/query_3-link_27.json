        "text": "A HISTORY\n\nOOWET4 COUNTY \\j \\J ? T J_j _L J~JL \\J \\J U JLi X i\n\nFROM\n\n1825 TO 1880\n\nBY\n\nW. TJ. A.NDERSON.\n\n<-'''- :;\":?' .'!<' ::\n\nC? $ C\" \" '/ .\n\n/ ; :: - (' '\"'\n\n(1\n\n|N attempting to present to the people of Coweta my \" little sietch of their history, I cannot claim anything like a correct account of fall the transactions in our\n\nCounty, but in the main I think as far as they go are cor rect. The historical account of officers and members of the Legislature can be relied upon as correct. Having .scarcely any records to refer to, most of it is made up from recollections and verbal information from others. I am satisfied of its correctness. I have sought much infor mation that would be of interest, but have not been able to obtain it in a reliable manner, hence will have to leave out many interesting facts, hoping that my rough and inexperienced efforts may induce others in the future to keep a more correct history of our County, and that the next generation will have a complete history from this time on, and that much improvement may be made on my feeble efforts, and all will take a pride in furnishing a correct history of all passing events in the future as I have gathered the rough stones and heavy timbers from the quarry and the woods, some more polished architect will furnish a more beautiful history of Coweta.\n\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\nHAVING, as before stated, gone through by each year and searched out the material to build with, and wanting a proper architect to fit and frame it together to make our efforts at all interesting, I have not attempted, if I pos sessed the ability, to eulogise any one, but have put all in the quarry of rough stone and timber collected together, which is much greater than I anticipated at the outset, but we must not despair of getting through in our rough way.\n\nWe will notice in the first place our legal population, as it has come out much larger than we set out for--75. We have continued to increase it till we close with 103, out of which we have some quite favorable specimens from rough timber. We, I think, have furnished seven judges of our Superior Courts, for our own Circuit Court and United States District Court, which will do very well for so small a town (or city) as ours, and I will remark that all are from humble families--no wealth or ; to push any of them forward--but all have own merits and perseverence.\n\n4\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\nThe first was his Honor Dennis F. Hammond, who is well recollected by many when he first commenced the practice of law in our city without wealthy friends or library to aid him, but by perseverence is now, after serv ing a term as Judge of our Circuit, a prominent lawyer at the Atlanta bar--all now recollect him.\n\nThe next is the Hon. John Erskine, United States Dis trict Judge for Georgia, who fills his station well and is well received by the bar and people generally. Newnan should feel proud of even having such citizens. We mustbe brief.\n\nOur old and honored friend, Lucius H. Featherston, is next to be noticed. He was not a citizen when Judge of our Circuit, but now is, and is a respectable, able lawyer;, has given satisfaction wherever he has been tried--never found wanting.\n\nThe next, Hon. John S. Bigby. Born and raised in Coweta, it is useless for me to say anything in his praise, for his works and legal abilities as Solicitor General and Judge of the Superior Court is too fresh in the minds of all to need even a passing notice from me, but that his history may not be omitted, all know how ably he sus tained himself on the bench, which he resigned to fill a more exalted station as your immediate Representative in Congress from the 4th Congressional District of Georgia, and is now United States Attorney-General for the District of Georgia, Coweta should be proud of such legal ability and statesmanship as his.\n\nThe next in rotation is the Hon. William F. Wright, who served you faithfully in the Legislature and in your State Conventions with credit to himself, and succeeded the Hon. J. S. Bigby as your Judge of the Superior Court. All know his legal abilities and fearless, independent course on the bench, at the bar, or for his friends, always ready to serve them honorably and faithfully. If he erred it was of head, not o? the heart, but he has, like others, left us.\n\nOur next to notice is the Hon. Hugh Buchannan. He has been partially noticed as a school teacher before, but we notice him now as y< ur Senator in the Legislature of Georgia. On the battlefield in our late war, his record will compare favorably in any place with any of his comrades. He was elected to Congress by a considerable majority, in 1876, but was not allowed, under reconstruction acts,.to take his seaf, and had to be content, like many others, to be set aside. He succeeded Judge Wright as your present ...Judge of the Superior Court. His legal ability, impartial decisioas and courtesy to all, need not be mentioned by me 'here; for they are written more indelibly in the hearts of\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\n5\n\nthe people than my feeble pen could describe them. It is only to perpetuate such names as his, and all I have men\n\ntioned hereafter, when we are laid cold, for our children to reflect upon and to take pattern from; for all of them were poor and have made themselves what they are by their own exertions at the bar and as useful citizens. None need be discouraged--the world is open to them now as it was to those who. have now gone before. We have no hereditary aristocracy to build up anyone.\n\nI have unintentionally passed the Hon. Walter T. Colquitt, our first judge and for three or four years a citizen of Coweta county, an honored judge and\" fine Christian\n\npreacher, Representative in Congress and Senator. Such men are scarcely ever found. His history is more fully written, as will be many others mentioned in your State\n\nhjstory, than in Coweta's short history. Let me here digress a little, and for the encouragement\n\nof all the little boys, tell them that our Governor, Alfred H. Colquitt, learnt crucifix in Coweta, and you can all fol low his example. Who knows but what some other Coweta\n\nhoy may become Governor of Georgia. Let some one set out for the prize--it is open to you as well as others. I would like to see some other of Coweta's boys fill the place\n\nhe now does with credit to themselves. The Hon. Owen H. Kenan, another of our lawyers, was\n\njudge, but not in our circuit, but was one of our lawyers at the time, should be mentioned, so I must add one more, making eight judges Coweta has furnished that is now recollected, besides others in other States from Coweta. We know of several others, but as ours is a local history, we must not run out after them.\n\nThere is always some change in the history of every thing. If I mistake not, one of our lawyers was stricken\n\nfrom the bar. I will leave that to our legal friends to find out their erring brother. Two others ran away. I will not mention any names or the crimes.\n\nWe might leave our lawyer friends here, but we are not\n\nquite done with them yet, as the little V>y said--\"Lie\n\nstill; there is more to come yet,\" they were like some of the rest of us. When we all came here we were poor. There was at one time nine lawyers in town and but one of them owned a horse--no livery stable nor railroads then either.\n\nHow they got about I will not now tell. Before I begin on our lawyers generally, we will give\n\nour lawyer friends one other encouragement, that of the\n\nSolicitor-Generals from the Coweta Circuit--five of them\n\nhave become judges. The rest of our lawyers, after the Judges runaway, and\n\nwe have a very respectable list left. If time and space\n\n6\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\nwould admit of personating of them we could make a veryrespectable showing--some of them have been Senators, and Representatives in the Legislature, and filled other respon sible positions, and many would compare favorably with any bar in the State, while others are young, they may ascend yet to the uppermost round in the ladder. Your way is as clear and open as it was to any before you ; you have your own destiny in your own hands, if you will manage it well you may yet be as honored as any that has preceded you.\n\nThe above will apply to our Doctors, we have had many eminent physicians among us, who have served long in our County, and have made for themselves characters and rep- utations that will live long after they are laid in the silent tomb, who were like most of the lawyers, started from nothing, so far as money was concerned, but have made, money with their reputation, and can now retire to the younger men who has to succeed them. There has gone from Newnan and Coweta, Doctors to almost every State, some very distinguished ones among them. I dislike to : personate any, or discriminate, but I will venture to name one who was born and raised in Newnan, that is an honor to such an honorable profession. I allude to Dr. Abner W.. Calhoun, of Atlanta. Others are Avorthy sons of our County, that we should be proud to recollect them and greet them,, were they to return to our county. I will not, if I had time, discriminate on others, I know of none who is not worthy of their profession, though we have had one hun dred and seventeen in our County, now recollected, others may have been omitted unintentionally. It is a hard race between the doctors and lawyers, but the doctors have come out a head this time. AVe will leave them now for others.\n\nWe will here notice our merchants, and will say that our city and County, as a general thing, has been more con trolled by local citizens and Georgians than any city of the same size I know of in the State. Turn to your present merchants, nearly all of them were born and raised in your County, (and I might say the same of your lawyers and' doctors) together with all your county officers, with very few exceptions, are natives of your County, those that are not have married native wives, and we might say_ ours is a Coweta County and city in deed as well as in name. Another very remarkable thing about Coweta and her citi zens and merchants, is, that all the capital we have has been made in our own County and by our own citizens, noforeign capital, or man of wealth, has ever come among us with his money, to aid us in any way, so what we are, if we cannot compare with Atlanta, we are a self-made (town,, or) city, by our own exertions, and the capital we have-\n\nHistory of Goweta County.\n\n7\n\nproduced at home. The same will apply to our hotels, workshops, schools and churches. Having digressed a little from our merchants, let any one turn to them, look into their standing and business character, and see if they will\n\nnot compare favorably with the same number of business . men in any county or city. None are close, penurious men, but are liber.il towards each other and to their cus tomers, not disposed to oppress any, for self aggrandize ment, but ready with helping hands to all honest men, who are striving to do right. I must not omit to mention that one of our former merchants was honored with a seat in Congress from the 4th Congressional District, in the person\n\nof Col. W. B. W. Dent, His integrity, honest dealing, natural good sense, caused him to be chosen over honored\n\nprofessional men who had made some reputation as States men and Congressional experience. He is the second mer\n\nchant I recollect of, from Georgia, ever honored with Con gressional honors. As I am only dealing in historical facts, will not indulge in anything like praise or eulogies of none. I think the above description of the merchants of Newnan will hold good with the merchants of Senoia and Grantville, and our country merchants, not leaving out\n\nTurin. I think I may how dismiss our merchants to take\n\ncare of themselves.\n\nWe cau not omit a short notice of our banks, which I believe has been doing business in our city for about ten\n\nyears, meeting all demands upon them when ever called upon; no one ever loosing a cent by any failure on their part to comply with their part of the contract; but the same I regret to say cannot be said of those whom they have accommodated with their mon?y. The same may be said of them as of our merchants--they are Coweta banks. Coweta capital and Coweta officers, all owned and perma\n\nnent in Coweta, which should reflect honor upon our County, that we have the capital and the men capable of managing of it in Coweta; showing we are not required to import men to manage our business. We might boast\n\nof two of Atlanta's best bankers, that used to live in our County, the Hon. John H. James, and J. F. Coker, were both poor boys when in Coweta, but are both now almost naillionares. Many others have gone from us, if we could locate them, that we would like to notice, but we will\n\nhave to neglect it for the wftnt of correct information about\n\nthem and their location. |*We might mention the Hon. Samuel P. Thurmond, of Athens, who used to live here, a\n\nbig awkward boy, nowj one of Georgia's leading lawyers, and a man of wealth. Jf\n\nWe will here notice the election of Wm. B. Berry, as President of the Atlanta and West Point Railroad, to sue-\n\n8\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\nceed the Hon. John P. King, resigned, showing the busi ness character of our fellow townsman. May he sustain himself as well as his predecessor, that we may all rejoice at his success, as a Coweta man of business. Many others whose notice we should like to give to the public, if we had their proper addreses, but have to omit them for that reason.\n\nOur farmers are pretty much like our merchants, most of them are natives of Coweta; children of the older settlers, who have grown up with us. Over two-thirds of them were raised up here in the County, several that we could mention that started the world with nothing, that are now what any one could call wealthy, with every com fort necessary for their ease, to make them enjoy life. Our farmers are generally doing well, and our county is improvinr; in a few years, we will have overcome all our losses from the war, and soon ours will be the Empire State of the South, and Coweta will be over an average county in the State; and I here make the prediction, that the child is now born that will live to see the time, cotton gins and bales of cotton will be things of the past, like the rolling of tobacco There is now but few living can tell of ever seeing a tobacco hogsheadVolled from Buncomb, N. C., to Charleston, South Carolina, with raw hide traces. Ailon-r cotton will be manufactured from the seed at home, and the manufactured goods shipped off in lieu of the raw material. We are only in our infancy as a progressive people. Our county now has a populat : on of 21,116; in fifty years who lives to see the census, then will see our county will have 50,000 inhabitants, and it will be a moi;e prosperous county than now. Lands that are-now selling for five to ten dollars per acre, will then sell for twentyfive to fifty dollars, and be more ready sale at these prices than the present. I make these statements not as histori cal facts, but to show they will be historical facts then, and that I know in 1880 make them, and put them on record.\n\nWe may here notice another of our county and city's history is the press or printing offices of our county, we have had more, perhaps, than most any other county or city of our size.\n\nThe first was in 1835, by Samuel W. Minor, the Coivsta Advertiser.\n\nThe second, soon after the same year, by Mr. J. Nelson, name not recollected.\n\nThe third, the Palladium, by Charles P. Sherborn.\n\nThe fourth, the Transcript, by J. and F. M. Welch, after wards changed to the Georgia Banner and Sentinel\n\nThe fifth, the B'ade, by T. W. Baton and F. D. Bowen, Esqs.\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\n9\n\nThe sixth, the Literary Companion, by James Daves. The 7th. Miss Barber's Weekly, by Miss Barber. The 8th. The People's Defender, by J. Troup Taylor. The 9th. The Newnan Herald, by J. A. Welch and J. S. Bigby; afterwards by \"Wooten and Welch, and is now in successful operation in our city. The 10th. The Fly Leaf Quarterly, by College Temple .girls. The llth. The Star, by Mr. Fish. The 12th. The Newnan Blade, by T. J. Banon. The 13th. The Ne^nan Leader, by Banon & Bro. The 14th. Name forgotten, by Mr. I. Burch. The 15th. The New Departure, College Temple girls. The 16th. The Lift'e Humbug, the biggest bugof all bugs, by the girls at College Temple.\n\nThe 17th. The Journal, formerly published at Senoia ; went down for want of patronage.\n\nThe 18th. The Farm and Home, of Senoia, is now a flourishing paper. Edited and published by Rev. N. N. Edge. Success to him ; may it live to catch any in Newnan.\n\nThe history of our papers, with very few exceptions, are recollected well by our citizens. Some have been well sustained ; others died out for the want of patronage. The county, not needing so many, consequently were not pat ronized sufficient to sustain them. We should feel proud of a well regulated press, and well sustained. Many of our papers would compare favorably with any others of the same kind in the State. If we have omitted to notice any other paper, it is from not recollecting it, not wishing to leave out any one or any other historical fact in our county.\n\nSince writing the above, we have received a copy of the Youth Guard, a succession of the New Departure, from Col lege Temple, a neat, well printed paper, and well edited, making our 19th.\n\nWe also mention the change of the Newnan Herald, Judge Welch retiring and Capt. A. B. Cales succeeding him as editor of the Herald. We hope it wM sustain its good character, and all will be proud to sustain it in the future as in the past.\n\nI will here refer the reader to the list of all officers of the county and State officers in another part of this work : Your Judges, Solicitors of the Coweta Circuit; the Gen erals; your Senators and Representatives in the Legisla ture ; your Judges of the Inferior Court of Coweta county; the Sheriffs, Clerks, Tax Receivers, Tax Collectors, County Surveyors, Coroners, Ordinaries, County Treasurers, City Councils, Mayors and Postmasters--all will be seen by reference to these lists.\n\n16'.-.\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\nI will mention that I failed to mention the election in\" ihe proper place of J. C. Evans as Major General of our\n\nDivision. He was a citizen of Troup county, but had command in Coweta as Major General. He served up to 1861, when John M. Hill was elected Major General to suc\n\nceed him. Thomas A. Grace was elected Brigadier Gen eral to succeed Gen. J. J. Neely, resigned.\n\nI believe all militia officers have ceased, except some' volunteers officers, which we have none to report from' Coweta county, except the Newnan Guards. We hope they may eclipse their old namesake soon, and all will be proud we have such a company.\n\nI now make my concluding chapter, after having gone' through fifty-five years of our county's history, from the\n\nwilderness as it was then to the present position. It is interesting and solemn to contemplate on its past history;;\n\nto remember the many good old fathers and mothers that have been with us that are now in their silent home, the grave, and many that have gone to other countries to make their homes with strangers, that we shall never meet again on this earth; it is a solemn reflection that soon all old historical facts will be remembered by none living and but\n\nfew of them left on record. If my history shall prove worthy of reading by others and aid in perpetuating the\n\nearly history of our county, I shall be content in having, in my imperfect way, collected the facts thrown together in so disjointed a manner as they are, be satisfied that the\n\neffort, feeble as it is, may cause some more competent to keep the history hereafter more correct, and that our his tory may yet be worthy of a place in every family in the county and many in other States and counties besides our own. Now in conclusion, let me make the contrast with our present situation and what it was fifty-three years ago, when we had no schools nor churches, and we were all liv ing on dirt floors or split puncheons to our cabins, with one door and one room for cooking, eating and sleeping,,\n\nand nearly all of us barefooted in summer from necessity o? money to buy shoes--and those that had money could\n\nnot get them, for they were not in the country to buy. We then rocked our children in hollow-log cradles; men,, women and children would walk five miles barefooted to\n\na Saturday night frolic, dance all night and go home with the gals in the morning. We then thought we were as big as big indian and as proud as onyone now with their red\n\ncalico dress with a dozen tuck?. All then nearly wore our\n\nown homespun. We felt proud of it, too; for it was home\n\nmanufactory--no tariff on it to quarrel over as now. But\n\nwe soon began to improve. A distinguished preacher not long since was talking to me about the early settlement of\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\n11\n\nour county. He said when his father had gotten off of his\n\ndirt flcoron a split puncheon floor he thought he was rising fast, and he let this preacher (then a boy) go with.him to a neighbor's house, never before being away from home. That neighbor had built him a framed house, the first one\n\nhe ever saw, and they were building a brick chimney to it, putting on one brick at a time. He thought they would never get it done that way. He said he looked on very much surprised and wondered if anyone else would build framed houses and brick chimneys. He afterwards got to be Justice of Peace in our county. Now what do you think of him? He has quit our county; left his dirt and puncheon floor, and has gone to Atlanta and is step\n\nping about there with his two-story hat on with those judges and lawyers like he had corn to sell--he did use to\n\nhave in Coweta. This is applicable to many others of our old citizens.\n\nI will mention one other circumstance. A young man coming to this county when he was but a youth was pass ing by about the first painted house I recollect of in the country. He was, he said, barefooted, for the reason his shoes had blistered his feet so he could not wear them--he\n\nhad no socks; it was getting dusk, he wanted to stay all night, he sat down by the roadside to rest and think whether he could venture up to that house to get to stay\n\nall night or not, wondered in his mind if he would ever have a white house to live in, his heart failed him, he put on to a log cabin to stay all night; went on to Alabama;\n\nstayed there a few years, came back to Georgia and is now a\n\ncitizen of our city, Newnan, and like our Atlanta man with his two-story hat and two-horse corriage to rideahout\n\nin. I don't know whether he has any corn to sell or not, but it would be dangerous to step up to him and tell him he used to go barefooted in our county. I will say for him though now he owns several painted houses, so you see\n\nthere is no telling the outcome of barefooted boys and girls. I could relate several incidents of young ladies, but I will\n\nnot tell on them--it used to be against the rules to tell tales out of school. There is a tale on Joe Brown and his plow\n\ning a bull in Cherokee county. We can come nearer home. We have a man in Coweta that long before Joe Brown\n\ncame to Georgia, the first year he came to Georgia rented land and was to give the third for the rent, and he plowed\n\na steer and did make the third, so he quit farming and has\n\nbeen a corn buyer ever since. He has no two-story hat nor white house, so you see things don't work right for all\n\nor all don't work them right one. He has never been Gov\n\nernor nor Senator as Joe Brown with his bull has. Many\n\nother such cases might be extended to a volume itself\n\n12\n\nHistory of Coioeta County.\n\nwere we to indulge in them. We will mention one other\n\ncase of plowing the cattle kind. There was a case in Coweta where a man plowed his milch cow and milked her every day and made his crop. Others have made .crops\n\nwith their hoes and elbow grease alone, without any plows at all. Plowing is not the only thing to make the man. If it is not in him neither the bull, steer or cow plowing, or if he has a Sam Weller to plow, he will be minus with out the brain otherwise to help him.\n\nTime and labor work wonders in a country. Only little over half century ago we were in the wilderness, as above stated, now see what we are, (and behind others at that). We now have fine churches, schools, comfortable, fine\n\nhouses to live in, and none need go barefooted. .We have the facilities for the making of almost anything we need, have our farms well stocked, our factories, mills, and all in\n\ngood order, with our railroads almost to any point, why should we not be contented and prosperous? Our ministers,school teachers, lawyers, doctors, merchants, bankers, mechanics, farmers, loafers, have plenty and in good health and sound condition. We need nothing more to.^ make us prosperous and happy, but industry, perseverance, and soon, too, we can say Coweta is really the best place\n\nwe know. People live long and enjoy good health, good neighbors, never scourged with an epidemic, famine or pestilence; then we should be contented. Imploring the\n\ncontinuance of Divine blessing upon us and our County, we close our story.\n\nA HI8TOEY\n\nOP\n\nCOWETA COUNTY\n\nFROM 1825 TO 1880.\n\n1825.--COWETA COUNTY was formed out of a portion of the land purchased from the Creek Indians at a treaty held at the Indian Springs, in the county of Butts, in Georgia, on the 12th day of February, 1825, by David Meriwether and Duncan G. Campbell, as commissioners on the part of the United States, General William Mclntosh, Col. Hawkins and others, chiefs of the Indians, to sell the lands to the United States for Georgia. General Mclntosh, Coi. Hawkins and others were killed by the In dians for selling the lands belonging to the Indians to the whites ; others would have been killed if they had not made their escape through a back window and swimming the Chattahoochee River in their night clothes to make good their escape. The killing of General Bfclntosh was in Carroll county, at the reserve, at Mclntosh's own house.\n\nCoweta County received its name from a tribe of the Cherokee Indians, called the Coweta tribe, of which Gen eral Mclntosh was the principal chief; this name will be perpetuated as the name of that tribe of the Indians, the former owners of the lands of Coweta.\n\nCoweta County had originally nine Districts and ex tended up to near Sandtown, then in the county of DeKaib, but now in Fulton county, and before we leave this description of the County we can now only find one man who was in the County in 1825, that is Aquilla Hardy, in the Sixth District, now 85 years of age.\n\n1826--was engaged in the surveying and partly drawing for the land. We don't know of but one man now living who settled in the county in 1826, that is Christopher B. Brown, who is now living on the same lot of land he set tled on in the fall of 1826, and has lived there ever since, and is now well and healthy in his eightieth year. All others that were here in either of these years are either dead or moved away.\n\n14\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\n1827.--We now come to this year in which the town\n\nwas settled at a place called Bullsborough, two and one-\n\nhalf miles north-east of Newnah, on the Fayetteville road,\n\nat which place the first election was held, which resulted\n\nin the election of James Hicks, John Guddice, John\n\nUnderwood, Nicholas Dwyer and Cabel Fields, as Judges\n\nof the Inferior Court; Benjamin Easley, Sheriff; John S.\n\nBeavers, Clerk Superior Court; J. Pollard, Clerk of the\n\nInferior Court; John Fleming, R. T, Returns, Josephus\n\nEchols, Tax Collectors; Charles Cleghorn, County Surveyor.\n\nAt the election on the first Monday in October, for\n\nmembers of the Legislature, James Hicks was elected Sen\n\nator; George Pentecost, Representative.\n\nThe first Superior Court was held in Coweta at Bull-\n\nborough, Walter T. Colquitt, Judge; Samuel A. Baily,\n\nSolicitor-General.\n\nThe first Grand Jury was :\n\n1. Isaac Gay, Foreman.\n\n2. Eli Nason,\n\n11. Moses Kelly,\n\n3. James Gal well,\n\n12. Lewis Pantill,\n\n4. Samuel Walker,\n\n13. Robert 0. Beavers,\n\n5. Anthony North,\n\n14. Elijah Hammond,\n\n6. Edward Secour,\n\n15. John Colwell,\n\n7. Thomas Dyer,\n\n16. S. Green,\n\n8. Edward Reeves,\n\n17. John Kezer,\n\n9. Daniel Wester,\n\n18. Miles Wood, -\"\n\n10. Nathaniel Nichols,\n\n19. Daniel Hull.\n\n1827--We have got our first set of officers and first\n\ncourt, but they don't serve long. On the first Monday in\n\nJanuary there was the regular election day for county\n\nofficers every two years, and every year for Tax Receiver\n\nand Collector, so that on the first Monday in January,\n\n1828, was the regular election for Sheriff and Clerk, and\n\nBradlyBell was elected Sheriff and Wm. A. Hicks Clerk\n\nSuperior Court, Sehon House Clerk Inferior Court, Johi).\n\nFlemming Receiver Tax Returns, Silas Reynolds Tax Col\n\nlector, Charles Cleghorn County Surveyor, Wiley Jones\n\nCoroner. County Treasurer then was appointed by the\n\nCourt, and we then had no Ordinary. The Inferior Court\n\nset as a Court of Ordinary for transacting ordinary busi\n\nness.\n\nThis will bring us to the location of the town of New-\n\nnan, which was done in February, 1828, and the lots sold\n\non the 25th day of March, same year, ranging in prices\n\nfrom $611.50, the highest, down to $40.00, according to size\n\nand location. We are getting rather ahead of our busi\n\nness, we should first have given the name of our town or\n\ncity, and why it was named Newnan. It was named New-\n\nnan in honor of Gen. Daniel Newnan, who served in the\n\nHistory of Coweta County,\n\n15\n\nrevolutionary war, and was a distinguished officer in the war of 1812, and fought well with Jackson against the Indians. He was a native of North Carolina, but at the time of the location of our town and naming of it he was a citizen of Georgia, and in 1831 he was elected on the gen eral ticket to Congress, and afterwards was made Adjutant General of Georgia, and died in Walker county at about .82 years of age. Every one should respect his name and honor him for his services, and the merits due such a sol dier and statesman.\n\nWe now have our town laid off, lots sold and the name given it, and why it was given its name. We will now give the name of most or all of the first settlers up to the first three or four years of our county as far as can be recol lected or can be procured from others. We will hold open a space for all information we can get from others, and to do justice, we will take it by districts, beginning with the first district up to the ninth. It will be rather dull read ing, but it will remind all of many old friends that have .been among us in times past, and we should cherish their memory for all time :\n\nFIRST DISTRICT.\n\nArthur Spince, John Neal,\n\nWillis Strengers,\n\nCullen Harp,\n\nWm.

A. Hicks and James Caldwell, they both had bouses of entertainment\n\nfor travelers. Jacob L. and James A. Abrahams had a log cabin in the square with a store ; this was all of Newnan then, and from that it has grown to its present size, 2,002 in population. We may speak 'of improvements as they occur to our recollection. The author purchased a lot in Newnan at the sale, and moved to Newnan one month\n\nafterwards for permanent settlement, and found the town had improved with the following settlements and citi zens : Clark A. Roney, with a store where the First National\n\nBank now is, and Thos. Roney, our first Postmaster. Wm. Low, Wm. W. Barrett, William Nemmons, Willis Kellgore, Richard M. Hackney, David Wright, Jeremiah L. Cheatham, Peter Hilton, John 0. and Charles Dickson, as car penters. Winchester Dumas as hotel keeper ; Wm. Hunt.. as tailor; Peter Henin, with his blacksmith shop, Peter Mercer, as his foreman, and his negro smith, Peter. James Hutch enson with a store on the west side of the square. Lawyers: William Daniel, John M. Thomas, Jas. Thompson, Josephus Echols. Doctors: James M. Lyons, J. Palmore, Levi T. Willborn. Messrs. Kellers and McGii-\n\nvary, came to Newman about a month afterwards with the fourth store. Your author erected him blacksmith shop\n\non tbe lot where the jail now stands. William Salsberry\n\nand John Willson, as brick mason, and with that noted steam saw mill, run by Robert Davis & J. Stewart, known\n\nas the whip saw; they would easily whip out their 500 feet of lumber per day. This is about the strength of Newnan for her first month after the sale of the lots; others came in constantly. The same year our old friend\n\nJoseph Williams came soon after; remained with us for\n\nover forty years, and moved to Cartersville, and died last January, in his one hundredth year. Also a Mr. King,\n\nfrom Tennessee, as brick mason; William and Stephen Hayse, as carpenters : William Terry, as hotel keeper. He bought out Winchester Dumas, and Mr. Dumas then set-\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\n21\n\ntied the old Fisher lot, whew Mr. Ormstead is now doing business, and opened another hotel. He had a large wooden goose for a sign. Mr. Terry, the same year, sold his hotel\n\nto that old prince of hotel keepers, John Dougherty. I could not say any thing to add to his history as a hotel keeper, as it is better known from himself than I could tell it, consequently we will let it speak for itself.\n\nMr. Terry then bought what is now the Virginia House, but has since went through many changes, as we will speak of hereafter. Peter Herrin bought an interest in Mr. Hick's hotel, and it was Herrin & Hicks, making four\n\nhotels this year. Dr. Palmore taught the first school in Newnan, in the Courthouse in the square, this year. Col.\n\nZachariah Phillips settled in Newnan, and James Climmons, Col. Thomas A. Lathum was added to the lawyers. This will bring us to the election on the first Monday in October, for members of the Legislature. Joseph Shaw\n\nwas elected,Senator, Anothony North, Representative. At the Legislature that fall, they cut off from our County the Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Districts, except two ranges of the Seventh and Eighth Districts on the south side, to form 'Campbell County. We have unintentionally passed over\n\nseveral things that should have been mentioned earlier this year. The First Methodist Church in the County was organized by our good old friend, father Wm. Stegall, in\n\nthe Ballered settlement in February, of this year. He was on the circuit in Fayette County, but came over and or ganized the church as above, so he informs me. The Rev.\n\nWillis D. Mathewes was circuit rider here then. The First Baptist Church in Newnan, was organized on the lot where R. D. Cole now lives, Rev, John Wood, as pastor. They have moved their church twice since, making their present\n\none the third church. The Methodists now have their third church; it was first organized 1828, the same with the Presbyterians. Their church was organized out near Bullsborough, in June, 1828. What a change has passed since\n\nthen; there is not but one minister of any of the different churches that were preachers then to answer to their names if called now, when this is read in 1880, and but two mem\n\nbers of all the churches of Newnan that were members then to answer to their names; soon it will be entirely new organization of pastors and members; it might now be said\n\nso to be. One other thing I will mention before I close, for 1828,\n\nthat is a widow lady by the name of S. Griffin, with two\n\nchildren, came to Newnan, and a carpenter by the name of Leonard Griffin, came to Newnan; no relation to Mrs,\n\nGriffin, but boarded with her, and sickened and died in Newnan. It was the first death ever occurred in the town,\n\n22\n\nHistory of Coioeta County.\n\nhis grave is unmarked and not known to any one where it is. This will close for 1828. If we are half as tedious in other years no one will read us through ; we must men tion, though, before we leave this year, that Dr. Palmer did not teach school long, and Col. Thomas A. Latham succeeded him, as teacher, in the log cabin on the Square.\n\n1829.--We will begin the year with elections, on the first Monday in January. Samuel D. Echols, Christopher B. Brown, Beniah McLendon, Dr. Levi T. Yvrellborn and Nicholas Dyer were elected Judges of the Inferior Court, John Fleming, K. T. R , Silas Reynolds, Tax Collector. This court let out the contract to build our court bouse. It was awarded to Capt. William Hitchcock,- who, by vigor ous work, completed it the same year. His principal brickmason was Capt. John D. Brown, his principal car penter was Mercer Babb. Brown and Babb both became citizens of Newnan afterwards. Capt Hi ten cock > was then one of the foremost contractors in Georgia, there- are now about twenty court houses, of his building, in.Georgia, besides other work. Our academy was completed and ready for school this year. Col. W. B. W. Dent was the first teacher in our academy--he did not teach long--only part of the year. A circumstance occurred (not necessary here to mention) caused him to leave the school. He was suc ceeded by the Eev. W. Eming, a Presbyterian minister, who taught that year out, who left our town at the close of his school. I think returned to Ohio.\n\nWe will mention our lawyers. Col. Thomas A. Latham left Xewnan for Campbellton, James G. Lyle, John Say, William B. Cobb and William B. Prycr became lawyers of Newnan, and will be mentioned hereafter, and I might here s&y to our lawyer friends, as the boy said to his mother when he went home from muster, and was asked, if he fired his gun as the others did, he loaded, though, every time, according to orders, he said, no, he was afraid. His mother told him to give her the gun, she would' show him she was not afraid--raised the gun to her shoulder and fired away, \"it kicked her over flat on her back, the boy cried out, lay still mother, there is seventeen more loads to come yet ; so our lawyers may lay still, there is seventy-five more to come yet, before we get through with them. The same will apply to our doctors, there will be seventy-five more of them to report.\n\nWe will now turn to the doctors. Dr. Joel W. Terrell, Dr. Wheeler Randle, Dr. Win. P. Echols, became citizens, this year, of Newnan. Dr. James M. Lyons left for WestPoint, Ga. Dr. J. Head, should have been mentioned before, in the First District. There is seventy-five more to lay still. Winchester Dumas went into merchandising\n\nHistory of Cowcta County.\n\n23\n\nthis year with his hotel business, but failed before the year was out. Earnest L. Whittick and Samuel McJunkin be came merchants this year, in Newnan.- Mr. A. Clark, of the firm of Clark & Roney, left for Campbellton. Dennis Sullivant took Clark's place with Mr. Roney. A. J. Berry came over from Bullsborough, this fall, to Newnan. Judge Keller and Miss Stokes were married in March, 1829. Richard M. Heckney and Miss Griggs were married this year, in Newnan, the first wedding, or marriage, ever occurred in Xewnan. Mr. John 3. Robinson and Miss Winkfield was the secend. I will not attempt to keep all, for I don't know them. This year, 1329, we had our first drinking saloon, it was kept by Minor W. Harris, as pro prietor. The first saddler's shop, this year, by Samuel Keller, but he was enticed off to Campbellton with the expectation of steam boats soon to be run there, but I don't think they have arrived yet: also, our first shoe and boot shop, by Willard and William Bradley. Mr. Salsberry sold out his brick yard to Ca.pt. Hitchcock, and moved to Columbus. Two additional tailors, this year, Angus Mclver and Charles Xelms. One painter, and/our first, this year, Richard W. East. Col. George Pentecost was married to Miss Williamsou, at Palmetto, but settled in Newnaa. Xo deaths to record, this year, but or.e, a child of Mr. and Mrs. Kilgore, poisoned by eating jimsonweed seed.\n\nThe election on the first Monday in October: Samuel D. Echols was elected Senator and Dr. Levi T. Wellborn, Representative.\n\nTo make our history more complete, we should not omit to say that Walter T. Colquitt was our first Judge, and Samuel A. Bailey our first Solicitor-General. Judge Colquitt was a citizen of our County during his first ierm and part of his second ; Judges, then, were only elected for three years. John W. -Hooper was our second SolicitorGeneral, for three years.\n\nWe omited, in 1828, to mention the election for Colonel and Major. Jacob L. Abrams was elected Colonel, and. Andrew J. Berry, Major, but Gov. Forsyth refused to coinmission them, for the reason that he did not know that our population was enough to entitle us to a Colonel. He ordered an election for Major, and Nicholas Dyer was electee Major. After ascertaining we were entitled to a Colonel, he ordered an election for a Colonel and another Major. Wenston Wood was elected Colonel, and Abraham Roberts, Major. Col. Wood soon resigned, and moved to Heard county. Major Roberts never uniformed, but moved away ; I don't know where he moved to. The Justices of the Peace and Bailiff's not being courts of record, we will not attempt to\n\n24\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\nkeep them in our history, though, it would be interesting\n\nif we could get them complete, but that we cannot do, and\n\nwill leave them out. I will mention one little incident.\n\nWillis S. Stunger, mentioned above, came to town, put \"up\n\nwith Mr. Terry to stay all night, got up to go, and think\n\ning he was on the lower floor of the hotel, and the upper\n\npiazza not being banistered, he walked out of the upper\n\nstory. He said he thought it was the longest step he ever\n\ntook, he got up not very much hurt, said he would not try\n\nit over again. Samuel D Echols rented.Mr. Terry's hotel,\n\nbut did not continue the business long, he retired for Win.\n\nHenry. Herrin & Hicks sold out to Levi Willcoxon, who\n\nbecame a citizen of Newnan.\n\nI will mention here that James Powel, Sr. died down on\n\nthe White Oak, in this ---- year of his age. A whole his\n\ntory might be written about the winding up of his estate,\n\nbut I shall not attempt even a description of it. Deaths--\n\nJoseph Shaw, our Senator, died this year.\n\n;\n\n1830.--I think from the above we might begin with the\n\nelection on the first Monday in January for county officers.\n\nDaniel Whitaker was elected Sheriff, William A. Hicks,\n\nClerk of the Superior Court; Sihon House, Clerk of the\n\nInferior Court; John Fleming, Receiver of Tax Returns;\n\nZachariah Chandler, Tax Collector; George Pentecost,\n\nCounty Surveyor; M. Dickson, Coroner. On Sunday night\n\nbefore the election one of the candidates made a regular\n\nbarbecue and secured his election. Our second drinking\n\nsaloon was opened this year by Benton Walton. James\n\nWood came to Newnan with a stock of goods for Benjamin\n\nBarber and opened a store in Newnan. John W. Pentecost,\n\nWillard Fisher, George Scott, all were new merchants in\n\nNewnan this year. The country store were Turrentine &\n\nCheek, Thomas Watson, in the third District, B. 0. & T. M.\n\nJones, on Line Creek; John H. Johnson, in the Seventh\n\nDistrict, Hugh Bruster in the Sixth, with some new-com\n\ners, Charles Tolliver, Owen H. Kenan, Thomas White and\n\nothers. We have gotten away from Newnan, but will\n\nreturn to it and say one of them seventy-five lawyers men\n\ntioned above was added this year in the person of John T.\n\nLeftwick, who afterwards married a Miss Lane, a music\n\nteacher in Newnan, and two doctors, Dr. W. P. Kainey, Dr.\n\nJeremsah Bell, who should before have been mentioned,\n\nIsham S. Rayney and Herbert C. Rainey as merchants.\n\nColonel Thomas Hudson became a citizen of our county\n\nthis year. Dr. Palmore left for Villa Rica, in Carroll county.\n\nThree additional carpenters, Thomas and Signa Moore.\n\nJames Holstack; one additional blacksmith, Wilshen L.\n\nShipp. Robert Shipp and Dr Lowery opened a hatters,\n\nshop--the first in Newnan. The population of Newnan\n\nHistory of Coweta County,\n\n25\n\nincreased by A. P. Hunter and family, Joel Hick, Mrs. Pryor, old man Hicks, the father of all the other Hickses in town, Thomas Cooper, Samuel Hutchenson, Taylor,\n\nWilliam Hunt--Hunt moved away--Samuel McJunkin, a merchant, though never a citizen. His clerks were Thomas Cummis and J. Cummis, King W. Perry and J. J. Penson--Elkany Denson, with his cake shop, then a regular business. Charles Wheelan, a tailor, became a citizen this year. The old man Keber, a regular traveling tailor, was with us often for many years.\n\nAt the election on the first Monday in October, John McKnight was^elected Senator, and .John Terry, Represent ative. At the session of the Legislature they cut off a por\n\ntion of the Third and Fourth Districts to Heard county, taking off our Sheriff and one of our Judges of the Inferior\n\nCourt. David W right, one of our carpenters, moved to Pumpkin Town, and William W. Barrett, another, moved to Whitesville, in Harris county. Robert J. Pinson came to New nan this year as clerk for George Scott. Our old friend, Judge Berry and Miss Parks were married August of this year.\n\nI fear I will be too tedious to give all the circumstances of our town, but I will mention one. A man by the name of John Huff, came to our town this year with three likely\n\nnegroes, a horse, cart and yoke of oxen, with Abel Harrison as driver of this cart. Mr. Huff drank considerably; was a batchelor, and his negroes and cart could not keep him up. He wanted some money ; he borrowed twenty-five dollars; put one of his negroes in pawn and to work until the mooey was paid back; gave his note as he thought for the money, but when he went to take up the note and\n\nredeem his negro, he was told that he had sold the negro; the man produced a bill of sale, all regularly witnessed, all right. He contended it was no sale--only a note given\n\nfor the money. He sued for his negro, tendering the money he received, but was met with his bill of sale. He never recovered his negro. Soon after he was indebted to others a considerable amount. He sells his horse, cart and\n\noxen and makes his escape between two days, leaving his\n\ncreditors to shift best they could for their debts. Abel Harrison, for his wages of eight dollars per month, after several fruitless trips in search of Huff and his negroes,\n\ngave up his losses; but not willing to content himself over his losses, went over to Carroll county. The gold fever\n\nwas raging pretty high. He rolled up his sleeves, pitched into work, and soon overcame his losses and made a hand\n\nsome property, and was one of Carroll's representativa men.\n\nOthers should do likewise, and we would have less com plaint of hard times, no bankruptcies or homesteads, it is the\n\n26\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\nbest cure for all of them that can be prescribed. In loss of the territory for Heard county we lost many other good citizens besides our Sheriff and Judge, and a very fine por tion of good farming land, but we had to submit to it. Judge Brown is now living where he settled in the fall of 1826, is a comfortable good farmer, with plenty for himself and his old friends, when they call on him, don't know any other man living so long on the same place, now over half century. We close for 1830. Mr. Xorman Bradly came to Newnan, this year, with his gin shop. His history, as will be remembered by many, and his only son, and child, Col. J. W. Bradly, will be mentioned hereafter, is now a citizen of Xewnan.\n\n1831--We open this year with an election, on the first Monday in January. Henry Seller was elected Sheriff in the place of D. Whitaker, cut off' to Heard; John Flem\n\ning, Receiver T. R ; Zachariah Chandler, Tax Collector. This was rather a quiet year for X'ewnan, only one lawyer to add to the name we have to make up, J. Howard. Xo nevv' Doctors : but I think two left our town, Drs. Bell and Bainey left. Three new stores this year--two young man' by the name of Cowan, from Virginia, Willcoxea and McGilvany. James Wood boughs out Sulivant & Honey. Mr. Sulivant moved to Columbus. Mr. Roney served the gentleman a while, and without taking leave of his credi tors, left for parts unknown, with his bills yet unpaid. Mr. Wood became our second Postmaster.\n\nOur late old friend, Thomas TV. Batton, bought Jlr, Terry's hotel, and his nephew, Dr. H. L. Lestergett, moved to Xewnan and took charge of it, and kept it for three years. Benton Walton sold his first drinking saloon to George E. Smith, and built another, at present occupied by Sam Leigh, making our third drinking saloon. Then it was common for all stores to keep liquor to sell in any quantity. John S. and Wm. M- Storey, as blacksmiths,. have been omitted unintentionally before in their proper :' place, and now Peter Hurston and John S. Storey, Jr., must be added to them. Minor W. Harris sold his con fectionery to Willard P. Taft. Mr. Harris left Mewnan, Mr. R. M. Hackney moved to Fayette county, but did not stay but one or two years. He \"will be mentioned again.\n\nThe population of our county was considerably in creased this year in the families of Robert Russell, James Russell, Wm. Russell, Robert Y. Brown, James Brown. Uncle Abraham Carmichael, and several others of the Carmichaels; James Thompson, Leonard Peak, Edward\n\nPass, James Gray, Hosea Gray, James Bixly, Hir m Camp, George Hendrix, Elisha Simms (his widow is now living in our county in her 85th year), Richard and Rev. Chas.\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\n27\n\nLevit, Dr. I. E. Smith, George Smith, James Eckless, and others not now recollected, except a family by the name of\n\nAustin came to Newnan from Columbus, all sick, one child died, and when, their health improved they moved away; don't know where to.\n\n\"We will now keep our record of elections. On the first Monday in October Samuel D. Echols was elected Senator and James Wood as Representative. Several things as we reflect have been omitted. The Rev. Joseph Y. Alexander moved to our town, took charge of the Academy as teacher and taught until 1843. including said year, and was pastor of the Presbyterian Church until 1S51. More will be said of him hereafter. The Rev. James Bavis, I think, this\n\nyear settled, in Newnan, and was pastor or supplied the Baptist Church for several years.\n\nThe vacancies of Col. Winston Wood and Major Roberts\n\nwas filled by the election of John W. Pentecost, Colonel, and John Jester as Major.\n\nThis year there was considerable excitement in gold speculations, in Carroll county lands, for gold, and some in Coweta became excited in it. A man passed through Newnan on his way in search of a gold mine, stopped for dinner and to have his horse shod, and 1 after leaving, the\n\nhotel keeper found a paper he dropped in the betel, reveal ing his business, what lot he was after and where the man lived who drew, the lot. In an hour afterward there was a company formed' to beat the first man to the drawer's\n\nhome, down on the Florida line. None was willing to un dertake the trip. At two o'clock in the evening the}^ came to Wm. U. Anderson, at his blacksmith shop, the author, with a fine tale and a fortune ahead, if he could only beat the other man to the drawer's home, in Decatur county, with a promise of a full share for his service, if he suc ceeded. He replied, if he could buy a certain mare, in\n\ntown, he would try it. He went and bargained for the mare, for $150, but when the owner found what he wanted with her he refused to stand to the trade, and would not\n\nlet him have her at all. By this time all were determined not to be defeated. One of the party had a good old horse,\n\nhe said he had never failed yet, take him and be off; so, by four o'clock in the evening, Anderson was off. Took\n\nsupper in Greenville, and next morning, beakfast in Tolboton, that second night lodged one hundred miles from\n\nNewnan. Next morning, by daylight, him and the old\n\nhorse was on the road. The horse seemed as if he was as much interested as any one, in the race, he distanced his\n\nman over one hundred miles. The first man found he was\n\nso far distanced, and heard the drawer had moved, turned back to hunt him up. Anderson went to the drawer's old\n\n28\n\nHistory of Coioeta County.\n\nhome, found him gone, and no gold, but, not discouraged, started in pursuit of the drawer, to Laurens county, but, on his return, on Tuesday morning, he found his first man had turned back from then, Saturday morning, giving\n\nthree days ahead, he gave it up, come home, like all other gold hunters, minus his ride and expenses for nothing.\n\nThe night, after Anderson left it was found out what was up, and that the drawer had a brother living in Coweta, and a third company was formed, and the brother of drawer, ready for a daylight start next morning to get the land from his brother. He reached him, told him he\n\nwanted to buy his land in Carroll. He said he had sold it to their, brother-in-law, a Mr. Burch. He proposed to Burch to buy the land. Burch inquired aoout the gold in\n\nCarroll. He told him he did not know of any; he never was in Carroll at all, and finally bought the land for $25 and the grant fee, what it cost Mr. Burch. Thinking, all\n\nwas safe, he wanted to rest a while, and lays over until Monday morning to draw the deed, and they went td> a Justice of the Peace to draw the deed. By this time the first man was there, and found there was no deed, he offered $200 for the land, the brother of the drawer offered 250, the\n\nfirst man bid $300 on it. Mr. Burch said if they were try ing that way to swindle him, none of them should have it. Mr. Burch had never had his deed recorded. The drawer\n\nand his brother, from Coweta, went home and the drawee makes a second deed to the land to his brother from Cow eta, he hurries home to Newnan to make a deed to a third party, then pushes off to Carroll and has it recorded. The true owner of the land comes on, goes to Carroll, examines the land, and, not being much of a gold hunter, was not much excited over it, returns. On his way home, in Newnan, the company having the second deed gets him off and secures him from access to any other person, buys his title\n\nfor $500, he takes his money, goes off, I expect, well satis-. fied, but the trouble was not over, part of the company goes over to Cvrroll to test the lot, and was not very well\n\npleased with their tradr, and wanted to make money out of it, sinks a pit and g-ts some gold and (salts the pit, as\n\nit was then called) came home, and proposes to sell out to the other part of the company, gets some of them to go and try the pit they had sunk, found the gold, and thought\n\nit was very rich, buys out four of the company for $300 each, making $1,200 for one-half the lot. When they\n\ncame to try other pitts and this old one, it did not pan .out\n\nwell. Suspicion was raised that there was foul play, and it leaked out that the parties who had sold out had bought\n\nabout the amount of gold that was found in the salted pit. Then the trouble begun, to get rid of the payment of the\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\n29\n\nnotes for the purchase of the interest sold. It was in law for some time, and finally abandoned, as a gold mine, and it lay for several years, finally Mr. Bonner bought the lot\n\nfor what the parties concluded it was worth for farming. He, Bonner, has thoroughly tested it, and its history is bet ter known than I could describe it if I were to try, which I will not do. This is about all Coweta has had to do with it. We will leave Mr. Bonner and his gold mine.\n\nWe have omited, in our early part of our history of our County, to say we had a regular Beecher case in our town, and a Belknap case, but neither was ever prosecuted, and they died out, and all he parties are dead and moved\n\naway, and we will let it pass with the things that are gone.\n\nCol. John Dickson, an old citizen and Elder in the Pres\n\nbyterian church, died this year, his age not known, but was quite old, about eighty years of age, an old revolution ary soldier.\n\n1832.--It must be recollected that in those times we had annual elections for members of the Legislature, and some\n\ncounty officers, hence we begin and end with elections gen erally each year.\n\nDavid Dukes, was elected Sheriff; George Pentecost,\n\nClerk Superior Court; Richard W. East, Clerk Inferior Court; John Flemming, Receiver Tax Returns; Shenod\n\nRowlan. Tax Collector; Wily Jones, Coroner ; County Sur veyor not recollected.\n\nThis was a quiet year; no change of hotels nor stores recollected, except the Mr. Cowans left our town. No lawyers to add this year; one was married--Mr. James Thornpon and the widow Hyatt; William T. Williamsen and Miss E. Philips were married this year. Mr. A. M. Gilchrist, Clerk for W. Fisher. James H. Campbell, with a negro workman, started the first wagon shop Newnan ever had. John and Charles Dickson moved to G-reenville.\n\nAnderson D. Abrahams came to Newnan this year and went into the ice business; but made a good failure; never\n\nsaved a pound of ice till warm weather. Jacob L. and Anderson D. Abrahams went into mer\n\nchandising, with a new store this year. This year we had\n\nthe first temperance barbecue on the Fourth of July, and the first public speaking on temperance, I ever recollect of hearing. The Eev. Dabney P. Jones made about his first\n\ntemperance speech at that time; from that his temper\n\nance lecture began. Mrs. Bird, afterwards Mrs. Napier, of Macon, taught\n\nschool with the Rev. J. Y. Alexander; the first female\n\nteacher ever taught in Newnan. Winchester Dumas, Jas. Colwell, John Colwell, all moved, I think, to Walker\n\n30\n\nHistory of Goweta County.\n\nCounty; Col. William B. W. Dent moved to Franklin ;\n\nJohn T. Leftwick moved to Franklin.\n\nOn the first Monday in October, Samuel D. Echols was\n\nelected Senator, Dr. I. E. Smith and James Wood, Bepre-\n\nsentatives. Mrs. Keller, wife of Judge Keller, died this\n\nyear. Our old friend, James Watkens, became a citizen\n\nthis year of Coweta, and many others not now recollected.\n\n1833.--We can now begin with 1833, with the election\n\nfor Judges of the Inferior Court: Samuel D. Echols, Wm.\n\nSpralter, John D. Hintin, Nicholas Dyer, James McClure;\n\nJohn Fleming, Receiver Tax Returns; Shenod Rowland,\n\nTax Collector. One lawyer left Newnan this year. Wm.\n\nDaniel, John Waits both left for Cherokee County; Dr.\n\nWheeler Randle left for Alahama; Dr. A. B. Calhoun came\n\nto Newnan to practice medicine. I neeed not say anything\n\nabout him, his history is too well known to all for me to\n\nsay anything in his interest or his success until he retii-ed\n\nfrom practice.\n\nWe have a new Judge of the Superior Court and a new\n\nSolicitor-General; Gresby E. Thomas, Judge, and J. P. H.\n\nCampbell, Solicitor.\n\n;\n\nWm. B. Cobb moved to Campbell County and W. B.\n\nPryor to Troup, so we are three lawyers out this yeal*.\n\nWillcoxon & McGilvary, closed their merchandise this\n\nyear.

Williamson, who\n\nwill be remembered by many old citizens.\n\nDavid Dukes, Sheriff, left very suddenly, not even noti\n\nfying his securities, leaving them to settle his delinquen\n\ncies as Sheriff; his other debts are yet unpaid. It is hardly\n\nnecessary to speak here of our churches, but I will say the\n\nFirst Presbyterian Church was built this year, but all of\n\nthe churches have changed three times each, and each one\n\nnow has their third church, but none on the original\n\nchurch lots.\n\nBenjamin Barker sold out his goods and closed busines\n\nin Newnan. Batty H. Mitchel came to Newnan and started\n\nour second saddle and harness shop. His history is as\n\nhousehold words to all, up to his death in December, 1879,\n\nin his eighty-first year; more will be said of him in the\n\nvarious offices he filled in our County.\n\nMr. Jacob L. Abrams and Miss Parks were married this\n\nyear. James Fleming, clerk for A. J. Berry. Mrs. Mary\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\n31\n\nWinkfield Robinson, consort of John E.

Long Solicitor-General, both are well remembered by many old friends; they will be mentioned again. Our lawyers are beginning to scatter, James Thom son moved to Walker county, and was soon elected Sena tor from that county, and .died, in Milledgeville, during the session of the Legislature; all may see his tomb in the\n\nfraveyard there, now. James G. Lyle moved to Alabama, euben Echols, Michael Dickson moved from our County. Mrs. Phillips and Williamson retired from the hotel. Major William A. Terrell succeeded them. Dr. Lestergett left Newnan for Altoona gold mines and Charles F. Sherburn succeeded him in the hotel. Samuel McJunkin closed out his merchandise business ; Jacob L. and Anderson D. Abrahams dissolved copartnership;-A. D. Abra hams went to South Carolina; Dr. Wimbush left also. Carpentering was very dull this year; two of them left-- Segna and Thomas Moore. Cordial T. Willburn estab lished the first buggy and carriage shop in Newnan this year. William U. Anderson sold his blacksmith shop to Peter Hurston; went to the country, three miles north of Newnan, and settled the place now owned by James Brewster. Tailors and shoemakers--no change in them this year. William F. & E. M. Storey located the second tanyard in .Newnan, previously having one out on Wahoo creek. Judge Keller left town and settled Willow Grove. (at present the home of our old, respected friend, James Watkins) and merchandised there two years. William Nimms, Esq., became our third postmaster. William B. Word, saddler.\n\nOn the first Monday in October Samuel D. Echols was elected'Senator; Dr. I. E. Smith and James Woo'i, Repre sentatives. The Legislature this fall elected James Wood Brigadier General to fill Gen. Sledge's vacancy by resigna tion. I will ha.ve to keep things correct, and make cur history more complete. I will mention our first general\n\n32\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\nofficers. They did not live in our county, but had com\n\nmand here. Samuel Armstrong Baily was our first Major\n\nGeneral; J. Sledge was our first Brigadier General,\n\nwith the lamented Fannin, of the Fannin and Ward Mas-\n\nsacree in Texas, as his brigade inspector.

Jackson Neely\n\nand John Goddice moved from our county, and William\n\nand Charles Clegborn also moved away.\n\nWe now have to mention the execution of Harrison\n\nSoutherland for the killing of J. Hillsman. It was the\n\nfirst death sentence in our county. Other murders we're\n\ncommitted; some were never arrested and made their Es\n\ncape; others were tried, but come clear. The first murde'r\n\nI recollect of in the county was the killing of J. Cowden\n\non the St. Cloud road, about two and a half miles frorh\n\ntown, by ---- Waters and Samuel A Dennis. Mr. Dennis\n\nstood his trial and was acquitted; Mr. Waters was never\n\narrested--made his escape.\n\nMajor Beverly D. Thompson commenced the practice of\n\nlaw in Newnan after being a school teacher for seven years\n\nin the county. Many of our lawyers have been school\n\nteachers in their time, and some of the doctors also.\n\n1885 -On the first Monday in January, John Hardeman\n\nwas elected Receiver of Tax Returns, John Carrington.\n\nTax Collector. He collected the money, and like David\n\nDukes, Sheriff, mentioned, left his securities to settle his\n\ndefalcations, and went to parts unknown. E. M. Story\n\nwas elected Major. It was the beginning of his military\n\nlife. We shall have occasion to mention him several\n\ntimes before we get through. There were several changes\n\nin lawyers this year. Josephus Echois moved to Colum\n\nbus, Ga., Ebenezer McKenly came to Newnan, and Robert\n\nS. Burch. Mr. Burch has moved away and back again\n\nthree or four times.

Dr. Leroy Holt came to Newnan,\n\nremained about two years and moved away,\n\nSeveral changes of merchants this year.

Minor came to Newnan and published the first paper ever published in Newnan. Name of paper\n\nCoweta Advertiser. He left our town. We will not give the reason for his leaving for fear we cannot give the cor rect one. As many rumors were in circulation about his\n\nleaving, we will leave them unexplained. Mr. -------- Nelson came afterwards the same year and\n\nestablished the second paper. In the fall he sold out to\n\nC. F. Sherborn, who afterwards published the Palladium, which we will notice hereafter.\n\nOn first Monday in October, Samuel D. Echols, Senator; Pr. I. B, Smith, James Wood, Representatives. King W.

D. Thomasson. William U. Anderson bought out Will-\n\ncoxon's hotel and opened it on the first of the year as a\n\nhotel.\n\nThis was a year of excitement in the Florida and Creek\n\nwars. Wm. U. Anderson raised a company for the Florida\n\nwar, but the requisition from Georgia was filled before his\n\n34\n\nHistory of Coweta C'ovMy.\n\nreport was received by the Governor. Anderson resigned\n\ntbe command of the company and went into other busi\n\nness, bat was soon ordered to tbe Creek war, He called\n\nout the company, read bis orders to them, and stated to\n\nthem be \\yould not attempt to assume command of tbe\n\ncompany unless re elected. Others, outs derg, -who had no\n\nbusiness witb tbe company, assumed that tbey bad orders\n\nto disband tbe company, and caused some trouble. An-\n\nderaoa wrote to Governor Schley on tbe subject. He re\n\nplied no one bad authority to disband tbe company, but\n\nhe would countermand bis order for the company to march\n\nto the Creek war, but ordered another company, raised by\n\ndraft o? voluntary enlistment. Anderson was acting as\n\nAdjutant for Col. Pentecost. Be received tbe orders and\n\nordered out tbe regiment in three days for a draft, which\n\ncaused considerable excitement. Z&ny went to Col. Pen\n\ntecost to know what it meant. He replied he could .not\n\n;sU un.'il He saw bis Adjutant; if he was right in whai:he\n\nhad ck:.<y h% -vould sustain him, if a;'!; he would dismiss\n\nshe regiment and let them go home.

The cavalry\n\ncompany was mustered into service on the 6th of June,\n\nand the infantry on the 7th day of June, 1836, for three\n\nmonth, unless sooner discharged. The cavalry, while in\n\nColumbus, was organized into a battalion, and elected\n\nJulius C. Alford, from Lad-range, Major. We remained in\n\nColumbus two or three days, and we were ordered up to\n\nWest Point, Ga, with General James Wood, as our com-\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\n37\n\nmander. We had there seven companies of infantry, com posed of the following counties : Major E. N. Calhoun as .Brigadier-Inspector.\n\nCaptain Anderson, Coweta.\n\nCaptain Parr, Carroll.\n\nCaptain Camp, Campbell. Captain Jones, DeKalb.\n\nCaptain Mam, Fayette. Captain Still, Payette.\n\nCaptain Dent, Heard. We were organized into a battalion and elected Wil liam Wood, of Heard County, Lieutenant-Colonel; John Chambers, of Carroll County, Major; Nicholas Tompkens, Adjutant. But few of the above list can now answer to their names if the roll was called. In a very few more years all will have answered to the last earthly roll call. Having somewhat digressed from Coweta to give the short sketch of our campaign in 1836, we will now return to Coweta and give the reception of Captain H. Garmaney's first company, from Gwinnett County. On their return home, on the 26th June, as they passed through Newnan, from the Creek War, stopped at Newnan. Their visit was thus noticed in the Newnan Palladium, taken from White's Statistics of Georgia. We now notice the election on the first Monday in October: Samuel D. Echols, Senator; Dr. I. E. Smith and James Wood, Representatives. Nothing much of interest in our County this fall, except some changes in merchants, Keller & Watkens; a new store in. Newnan; Dr. Watkins & Hugh Houston, at Willow Grove; Coleman & Huggins, at Oak Lawn ; Skein & Brother, up on county line; Turrentine & Levell, in the First District; Sanders W. Lee, in the Second District; John H. Tinch, on White Oak ; S. J. Harbsr in the Fourth District, is about all the changes in merchandise recollected. John B. Tendal, on Cedar Creek and several of the Randals in the Third District; Major Holland. Mr. Wadsworth, with his tan yard, and many other changes not now recollected; but we must not forget Charles Emlin's cabinet shop, and John Hall's thrashing machine factory; it was then common for all to do their own thrashing at home in their gin houses. Samuel S. Mayors died 1836, Sixth District. We will here mention the death of one of our earlier settlers of Coweta, who was cut off just over the line in Heard County, Major James Wood, a revolutionary soldier and gallant officer in said war, died 82d year of age. Willard Fisher died this year; age not known. 1837.--We begin 1837: with our January elections-- Samuel D. Echols, Henry Keller, John B. Tendal, James\n\n38\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\nMcClure, Sanders W. Lee, were elected Judges of the Inferior Court; John Hardeman, Receiver Tax Returns; Silas Reynolds, Tax Collector.\n\nWe have a new Judge and Solicitor this year; or rather the re-election of Judge Warner, and Col. George D. Anderson, from DeKalb, as Solicitor. Thomas Hughey, as our sixth Postmaster; some change in lawyers. Robert S. Burch, Wiley G. Parks, Eddy Ware and Philip Ware, left our County and others not now recollected. Charles F. Sherbern closed his Palladium this year.\n\nSome new merchants arid changes: Kilgore & Rey nolds, Wm. U. Anderson, merchants: Mr. W. Fisher's business was wound up this year; John and William B. Brown, merchants; John Brown soon left for the low country for his health--did not live long down there ; Geo. T. Anderson, as a blacksmith ; Valentine Harden & Sons, as carpenters; William J. C. Kenada, as clock and wate-aV repairer and jeweler; Elam S. Ashcroft, as carpenter; he'; tried, the broom business, but made a successful failure at' it. Col. John W. Pentecost died the early part of this. year, and E. M. Storey was elected Colonel to fill his': vacancy; Daniel C. Turrentine was elected Major. We will now mention that William G. Kobb, who killed Mr. Easterwood down on the State read, at Mr. Jackson's gro cery ; all well recollect it and his trial, and I need only to : mention it. Our first Female Academy was built this year, and the Misses Chamberlains were the first teachers. They had a fine school. They were succeeded by the Misses Bakers; one of them afterwards married a mission ary and left us. Mrs. Martha M. Pinsoa died 1837--E. C., 6th district.\n\nThis will bring us to the election. O.n the first Monday in October Samuel D. Echols was made Senator, and Dr. I. E. Smith and Nicholas Dyer, Representatives.\n\nJohn Neely was 93 years old at the time of his death. He received nine scars in his head in the revolutionary war. T. F. Jones, Tax Receiver for 1877-'78, was wounded at Morristown, East Tennessee, in the left groin, and bone broke near the shoulder joint, October, 1864. . The general officers of the militia were then elected by the Legislature, and Willis Kilgore was elected to fill Gen. J. Wood's vacancy by resignation.\n\nWm. W. Sellrnan was a merchant in the first district, and Miles Jones in the sixth district. Kins; W. Perry. moved out on Line Creek to merchandise awl fann. We will mention the marriage of Col. E. M. Stmey to MissD. Owen, and Mr. J. J, Pinson to Miss Mary A. Reynold. Both married this ye^r.\n\nJ. J. Pinson bought out William Nemrnons, of the firm\n\nHistory of' Coweta County.\n\n39\n\nof Nemmons & Terrell, and it was then that Pinson & Ter-\n\nrell and George Scott left our county for Alabama. John\n\nD. and Seaborn Hinton sold their mills to Mrs. Ann C.\n\nWilkins this year. She will be remembered by many old\n\nsettlers Seaborn A. Hinton moved' to Walker county,\n\nand John D. Hinton to Mississippi. Michael and Asa\n\nD'ickson moved to Walker county.\n\n1838--The election o-'county officers was Thos. Hughey\n\nSheriff; Batty F. Mitchell. Clerk Superior Couri; David\n\nMosely, Clerk of the Inferior Court; John Hardeman -- --;\n\nJesse Rhodes, Tax Collector; John Kelly, Coroner; George\n\nPentecost, County Surveyor. Not many changes in busi\n\nness this year in JSTewnan. William U. Anderson sold out\n\nhis hotel to Col. William Sellman, and he succeeded him\n\nin the hotel business. -: Marshal Sheets moved from our\n\ncounty. Lawyers about the same, except Robert W.\n\nSimms commenced the practice of law. Dr. A. B. Calhoun\n\nwill be recollected as taking a trip to France for a course\n\nof lectures in medicine by many now. John B. Tendall,\n\none of the Judges of the Inferior Court, died August 30,\n\n1838 This year the Cherokee Indians were removed from\n\nCherokee. Ga. One company from Coweta, commanded by\n\nCa'pt. E. M. Storey, was engaged in their removal. Au\n\ngustus H. Stokes was a Colonel in that campaign from\n\nCoweta.\n\nE. M. Storey, Captain.\n\nB. D. Thomasson, First Lieutenant.\n\nThos.

J.,\n\nYork, Isaac.\n\n>_'\n\nShadex, Thomas,\n\nRichard-M. Fletcher closed business this year in New-\n\nnan and moved to Carroll County. Albert Sears became a cit\n\nizen of Newnan, this fall, whose history, as a money dealer,\n\nis familiar with all, and will be long remembered. Our\n\nmembers to the Legislature were Dr. I. E Smith, Nicholas\n\nDyer, Gilbert D. Greer, Representatives. This will about\n\nclose 1838, as lar as recollected at present. The Legisla\n\nture, this fall, elected Hugh A. HaraUon, Major General,\n\nand he appointed Col. E, M. Story his Division Inspector.\n\n1839.-- We now7 commence this year with the election of\n\nLive Newton as Tax Collector. There was considerable\n\nchange in business this year with merchants. Keller &\n\nWatkins failed, William U. Anderson moved his goods to\n\nMarietta and closed business in Newnan; sold his house\n\nand lot where H. J. Sargent no>v lives to Davis Owen,\n\nwho became a citizen in Newnan. He (Anderson) moved\n\nto the lot north of the Methodist Church and improved\n\nthat lot. Judge Ishmael Dunn was a citizen that\n\nought to have been mentioned sooner--not too late yet.\n\nHe only lived in Newnan a few years and returned to Fay-\n\nette county. We must mention though that while he was\n\nin our county, our old friend, Major T. A. Grace married\n\none of his accomplished daughters and retained her as a\n\ncitizen when her father left. William U. Anderson this\n\nyear bought out C. T. Wellborn's carriage shop, on what is\n\ncalled Bay street, and took up his old trade of blacksmith-\n\ning with the carriage business.\n\nIt was remarkably dry that fall--all will recollect it--\n\nwe could not get any grinding done except at the river\n\nmills, and they were so crowded it was about a week's trip\n\nto go to mill and get grist of meal. Anderson & Martin\n\nHistory of Coweta County.\n\n41\n\nbuilt a horse mill in Newnan, or rather started it just by hand with two cranks. It was kept running nearly day 'night, and they afterwards geared it up for horse-power, and ran it for some time, but rains came about Christmas, and took their custom off, so they abandoned horse-power. We had no steam-power then in the country; everything was hand work. We made our wagons, carts and all our plows, axes, farming tools at home. We had our smoke houses at home, and corn-cribs in our horse lots, and if a neighbor had to buy corn or meat, he did not go to Ten nessee or Ohio for it. He went to his neighbor and got his supplies. We then lived at home and boarded at the same place ; had our washing done in the yard. Now contrast that with the present All our workshops are now run by steam, and most of them are in the Northern or Western States. I need not say to the people which is the best plan those days or the present. If I was to claim those good old times, I would be dubbed an old fogy, and it would be said I would do as our fathers did--carry a pumpkin in one end of the bag and a rock in the other ; but I think the next generation though will get a'bout right, and we will have our shops, corn cribs and smoke-houses at home again --our country will be at home once more. I think we are improving very fast considering what we have went through in the last nineteen years. We will not complain but hope for improvements. Much more might be said, but the above is as much as we have space for at present.\n\nJohn D. Brown and Daniel Whitaker went into the grocery and liquor business this year in Newnan. Hugh Houston was killed by lightning on Sandy Creek. Watkins & Houston closed business at Willow Grove; John and -James Turner and James Watkins, jr., moved to Texas; William A. Speer bought out Keller & Watkins goods in Newnan ; soon after sold them to Heard & Philips; many will recollect the firm, it, did not last long, but resulted in sev eral law suits in Alabama, where part of them were over taken in making their escape with their negroes.\n\nThe Reverend Robert Fleming became the teacher in our Female Academy. John A. Fleming succeeded the Hon. Hugh Buchannan in the Academy.\n\nGeneral James Wood left our town for Co^mbus in 1837, Should have been mentioned sooner, and Constantine W. Buckley, a prominent young man, left with him. They did not stay long in Columbns, but went to Texas, on a pigeon-roost money speculation. C. W. Buckley returned to our town in 1838 and married Miss Jane Phillips and returned to Texas; became a prominent lawyer there, and was Judge of the Superior Court, and was unfortunately drowned in attempting to cross a creek which was very\n\n42\n\nHistory of Qoiceta County.\n\nmuch swollen. He and hia horse were both washed down\n\nthe creek and drowned in the prime of his life.\n\nGrace & Long were merchants in Newnan this year;\n\nB. D. Thomasson, a lawyer, left New-nan for Franklin : old\n\nman Norman, the seedman, name to our county about this\n\ntime and remained until 1856, and moved to Florida, but\n\ndid not stay there ten days; returned to Thomas County\n\nand died there. His family returned to Newnan and will\n\nbe remembered by many.\n\nThis brings us to the election of our members to the\n\nLegislature on the first Monday in October: Dr. I. E.\n\nSmith, Senator; Dr. A. B. Calhoun, Gilbert D. Greer and\n\nJohn Jester, Representatives.\n\nCharles Emben and' John Hull broke up their shop;.\n\nJosiah and Elisha Brown closed business and left our town.\n\nNoel B. Knight, of Covington, was elected Solicitor of the\n\nCoweta Circuit. Col. Thomas Hudson, a prominent citizefi,\n\ndied this year; .his age unknown or the day of his death'.\n\nJoh.n Thurm$n| an old revolutionary soldier, died in New-\n\nnan, aged eighty years; also,i:Hill Thurmg;n|,died this year:\n\nno other deaths now recollected.\n\n-\n\n1840.--This brings that memorable year of log cabins\n\nand eocn skins. Just forty years ago, a great Presidential\n\nelection, as the present 1880 is now just opening of a\n\ngreat contest. May ths present end as peaceably as that\n\ndid, and our country as that did, change the great political\n\nparties, and our country be at peace as we were after that\n\nchange. We had many rides on log cabins and boat races.\n\nOars working hard with their canoes on wagons, and\n\nmany other memorable things not necessary here to men\n\ntion. We have rather got the cart before the horse here;\n\nwe should have mentioned our election on the first Monday\n\nin January, first, then set out with our log cabins. Win.\n\nIlogan was elected Sheriff; Batty H, Mite-hell, Clerk.\n\nSuperior Court; Jonathan W. Lee, Clerk Inferior Court;\n\nJohn Hardeman, Receiver Tax Returns; Levi Newton, Tax\n\nCollector; John Kelly, Coroner; County Surveyor not rec\n\nollected. The Democrats were more surprised then at\n\nColquitt, Cooper and Black, coming to the Democratic\n\npariy, than they are now over the resignation of General\n\nGordon, and the appointment of Governor Brown as his\n\nsuccessor. The first added considerable strength to the-\n\nDemocrats, the latter, I think, will be the means of uniting\n\nthe party on a, solid basis We have Colquitt in each case.\n\nThe saying was then that wise men sometimes change\n\ntheir opinions, but fools never do. I must be a very hard\n\nfool; I have been over fifty years voting for the Democrats,\n\nand don't see where I can get away from them yet. But\n\nthis is getting away from the history of Coweta on to gen-\n\nHistory of Coiveta County.\n\n43\n\neral politics; pardon the digression. We will return to Coweta. James and Frank Welch came to Xewnan and started the old Transcript, and Saxon M. Anderson, an apprentice, as printer. Judge J. A. Welch has continued the printing and publishing business ever since in Newnan, and is now your leading journalist. I could not de scribe him as well as his journals have done to the people, were I to try. I shall leave him and his marks as his best historian. This, 1840, was also census year, as 1880. Many predictions, fault-findings, about VanBuren taxing the old women's soap, chickens and ducks, and our population, then, was little over ten thousand', in the county. I will give the number this year, when it is completed, to show our increase in population. One of our members to the Legislature, this year, was taken with a leaving in March and has never yet returned, I allude to John Jester. I learned afterwards he died near Little Rock in Arkansas. His history is not one of much credit to Coweta, though, he did represent them in the Legislature once. Thomas 0. Carter was elected Colone, to fill Col. Story's p"
