        "text": "William Jay’s significance in the world of architecture is exemplary, and can be admired to date throughout the city of Savannah. While Savannah has a vast history, and a myriad of artists, architects, and engineers have left their mark on the city, Jay’s influence expands further than most of his predecessors. Coming from England, Jay brought in a fresh, innovative perspective to building design that had not been seen in the United States yet.\n\nJay was born and raised in Bath, England, a city of wealth and innovation shaped by palladian and neoclassical architecture. As he grew up, he left home and moved to London where regency style architecture was emerging, and the world of architectural design was booming. Here, he spent six years as architect David Riddall Roper’ apprentice.\n\nIn 1817, Jay traveled to the United States, settling in Savannah, GA. The city was rife with potential, and was developing exponentially with architects from across the world coming to make their mark.\n\nAs the first planned city, Savannah was imagined by James Edward Oglethorpe with the vision of creating a gridded system intertwining public spaces, like parks or squares, and businesses. Since its foundation in 1733, many notable architects have left their mark on the city, with nearly half of its buildings today being of notable historical significance. While Jay is responsible for just 8 buildings scattered throughout the city, the significance of each far outweighs the impact of others who have left a bigger physical footprint.\n\nBy the time Jay arrived, word had spread of his innovative style, and he immediately got to work on designing for some of Savannah’s most prestigious clients. Today, Jay’s buildings serve different purposes than their original intent, but are nonetheless considered historical monuments that shaped the city as we know it.\n\nOwens-Thomas House\n\nThe Richard Richardson House, now named the Owens-Thomas House is a regency style mansion located on Oglethorpe Square. The mansion includes gardens, a carriage house and slave quarters which was completed in the year 1819.\n\nThe years following its construction were troublesome for the Richardson family, as they suffered sickness and death. By 1830, the house had been bought by George Welshman Owens, the city’s mayor at the time. After Owens’ death, the house was passed down through generations until 1951, when it was gifted to the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences by the last descendant of the Owens family, Margaret Thomas, in her will with a request that it be transformed into a museum honoring her late father and grandfather.\n\nThe Telfair Mansion\n\nLocated at the intersection of Barnard Street and President Street is another one of William Jay’s designs, the Telfair Mansion. The Telfair Mansion is also a regency style mansion commissioned by Alexander Telfair. Alexander left the estate to his three sisters after his passing. Mary, being the last sister to pass away, directed that the mansion become an academy of arts and sciences in her will.\n\nThe structure and interior spaces were altered to make room for the museum, with certain spaces like the kitchens on the main level and basement being left intact as historical spaces.\n\nWilliam Scarborough House\n\nYet another house designed by Jay, the Scarborough house was commissioned by William Scarborough, one of Savannah’s most prominent distinguished shipowners. Unlike the Owens-Thomas House and the Telfair Mansion, this house is an example of Greek Revival architecture. At the time of construction in 1819, this architectural style was new to the south, and was one of the first buildings erected in this fashion.\n\nDespite several renovations and restoration efforts throughout the years, the original design intent has been honored and the building has housed a multitude of occupants throughout history. After the Scarboroughs left, the building was used to house the West Broad Street School. Following that, it became the headquarters for the Historic Savannah Foundation. Presently, it houses the Ships of the Sea Maritime Museum.\n\nSavannah Theatre\n\nSitting on Chippewa Square is Jay’s Savannah Theatre. Since its opening in 1818, the theatre has operated continuously showing a mixture of both live performances, and movies.\n\nThe theatre has had a few run-ins with nature, being shaken up by hurricanes and fires. While the damage it has suffered has been extensive, restoration efforts have rehabbed the building to maintain its functionality. The facade’s original design has been altered from Jay’s design, receiving a brick facade after the fire of 1906. Later, in the 1940’s, another fire struck and the building was renovated with an art deco architectural style. To this day, live performances and music fill the space catering to the local residents, and visitors.\n\n21 West Bay\n\nAs the name suggests, this work by Jay is located on West Bay Street just one block from the Savannah River. Originally housing Savannah’s first hotel, a post office, bank, and bar until it shut its doors in 1864.\n\nThe building struggled to maintain tenants throughout the next century, going from a storage warehouse to sitting empty at times. At last, by 1999, its current tenants had renovated the space into a brewhouse and pub and opened their doors as one of Savannah’s local breweries, Moon River Brewing Company."
