        "text": "Get ready to experience a curated selection of Greek Revival homes to satiate your hunger for stunning architecture!\n\nAs preservers of American buildings, the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America has saved their fair share of Greek Revival homes. Let’s explore early-nineteenth American history with a tour of the Great American Treasures that reflect Greek Revival architecture.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll cover:\n\nKilbournetown House in Shorewood, WI\n\nClarke-Ford House Museum in Chicago, IL\n\nCraik-Patton House in Charleston, WV\n\nThe Oaks House Museum in Jackson, MS\n\nEasy Listening For Your Journey to Greek Revival Homes\n\nMilwaukee, Here I Come – Dolly Parton, Porter Wagoner\n\nWisconsin Polka – Markic & Zagger Orchestra\n\nWisconsin Small Town Polka – Mr. Blink\n\nMy Kind of Town – Frank Sinatra\n\nMannish Boy – Muddy Waters\n\nSweet Home Chicago – Robert Johnson\n\nTake Me Home, Country Roads – John Denver\n\nMy Little Home in West Virginia – Bill Emerson\n\nWest Virginia Line – Cumberland Gap Connection\n\nMississippi – The Cactus Blossoms\n\nMiss Maybelle – R.L. Burnside\n\nLaughing to Keep from Crying – Mississippi Joe Collicott\n\nKilbourntown House – Shorewood, WI\n\nKilbourntown House was built by Benjamin Church, a carpenter from New York who moved to Wisconsin in the 1840s, the height of the Greek Revival architectural movement. It’s clear that Church valued Greek Revival architecture as his house follows the classic formula: fluted, Doric columns, triangular pediment, and symmetrical façade.\n\nAlthough the house did not house anyone particularly powerful or important, the little home was such a fine example of Greek Revival architecture that it was saved from demolition in the 1930s and moved to a new location. Thanks to the hard work of these preservationists, the Kilbourntown House is now the oldest surviving house in Milwaukee. Admission is free, and the house is open in the afternoons on Sundays from June through September.\n\nThings to Do Nearby:\n\nVilla Terrace Decorative Arts Museum– Historic lakefront villa showcasing fine & decorative arts from the 15th to 18th centuries.\n\nBlack Cat Alley – Outdoor gallery in an urban alleyway featuring huge, colorful murals by diverse global artists.\n\nMilwaukee River Greenway – Restored riverfront area featuring multi-use trails, kayaking, picnic tables, and lots of green space.\n\nPlaces to Eat:\n\nBenji’s Deli – Charming diner serving classic deli favorites\n\nSALA – Modern Sicilian Dining – Destination for Sicilian pasta & pizzas in a red-walled, art-rich space with a patio.\n\nCafé Corazón – Colorful eatery serving locally sourced Mexican fare.\n\nPodcast:\n\nThis is Milwaukee’s Oldest House – A little back story on Milwaukee’s oldest original house.\n\nClarke-Ford House Museum – Chicago, IL\n\nBack in the 1820s, “Chicago wasn’t anything more than a glorified mudhole, but a perfectly located mudhole for a country that was growing west,” says Chicago cultural historian Tim Samuelson. When Henry B. and Caroline Palmer Clark arrived in Chicago, a place that was still mostly prairie at that point, they had plans to make their home a statement of not only their wealth and importance but also the future success that they believed Chicago would have. What better style could they choose than Greek Revival?\n\nConstructed over the course of two years and actually never fully finished, the Clark-Ford House still stands today as Chicago’s oldest house. The Greek Revival aspects of the home are unmistakable. In fact, no one would blame you for thinking this home was a Greek temple with its grand staircase entrance beneath a pediment resting on four substantial columns. Like so many Greek Revival homes, this house also features wooden clapboard siding that’s been whitewashed to make it look like marble. As of September 2022, the house is closed for renovations, but that won’t stop you from reveling in the beautiful Greek Revival architecture from the outside in the meantime!\n\nThings to Do Nearby:\n\nGlessner House – Docent-led tours of a landmark 19th-century house & Chicago’s oldest building.\n\nField Museum – State-of-the-art museum of science & invention, with the world’s largest Tyrannosaurus Rex (kid-friendly)\n\nJane Addams Hull-House Museum – Mansion where Jane Addams began the settlement-house movement & now a museum with exhibits & tours\n\nPlaces to Eat\n\nWentworth Seafood House – Seafood-focused Cantonese dishes along with bubble tea served in an easygoing atmosphere.\n\nRicobene’s – Old-school pizza parlor serving a famous breaded steak sandwich alongside pizza & Italian standards.\n\nThe Burger Point – All-natural burgers, wings & chili with gourmet garnishes ordered via iPads & made while you wait.\n\nDigital Tour:\n\nClarke House Museum Digital Tour – Join Chicago’s cultural historian Tim Samuelson on a virtual tourof Chicago’s oldest house, the Clarke House Museum.\n\nCraik-Patton House – Charleston, WV\n\nEven though West Virginia is known more for its rolling hills than anything else, one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture exists in the state’s capital, Charleston.\n\nThe Craik-Patton House was built in downtown Charleston in 1834 by lawyer James Craik, whose dad had been George Washington’s personal secretary and whose grandfather was Washington’s personal physician. With his family connections, it’s no wonder that James Craik hoped his home would reflect the ideals of American democracy, even in a town as secluded as Charleston.\n\nThe lawyer and amateur architect lived in the home, which he named Elm Grove, with his wife and eleven children. The home features four large columns that support the extended center roof, a door with three symmetrical windows on each side, and a central staircase. After living there for a decade, Craik moved to Lexington, Kentucky, to pursue work in the Episcopal Church, but his appreciation for and commitment to Greek Revival architecture can still be seen today. The house is open to the public from 10 am – 12 pm & 1 pm – 4 pm Monday through Friday and over the weekend by appointment.

Large windows flank a central front door, and the front of the house is adorned with simple columns. The house was constructed for James H. Boyd, Eliza Ellis Boyd, their six children, and numerous grandchildren.\n\nSpared from the burning of Jackson during the Civil War, perhaps because Boyd was an alderman of Jackson at the time or maybe because the structure was an unassuming and modest residence, The Oaks House Museum is now one of the oldest structures in the city. The house is open for visitors on Tuesdays and Fridays from 10 am to 3 pm. The cost of admission is $4.50 for adults, $3.50 for children, and $4.00 for adults over the age of 65.
