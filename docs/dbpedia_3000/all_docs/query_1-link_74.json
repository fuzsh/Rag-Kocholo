        "text": "When you’re in the process of buying a house, there are a lot of different home styles to consider. From a Tudor to a Craftsman to a Colonial, each home style has its own distinct features. One of the most popular and enduring home styles is the Federal-style house.\n\nBut what design elements define a Federal-style house, and how do you know if they’re right for you? Let’s go over everything you need to know about a Federal-style home.\n\nWhat Is A Federal-Style House?\n\nA Federal-style house is a popular type of house that has stood the test of time. Easily recognized by their shape and façade, Federal-style houses utilize some of the same elements and materials used in colonial homes while still having their own unique features.\n\nDrawing inspiration from ancient Roman and Greek architecture, examples of the Federal style include the Oval Office of the White House and the famous Hamilton Hall in Salem, Massachusetts.\n\nWhat Does The Federalist Architecture Style Look Like?\n\nFederal-style homes are marked by a few key architectural elements, including a square or rectangular shape and Palladian windows and columns.\n\nDespite these easily identifiable characteristics, the Federal home style is often confused with the Colonial style – so let’s break it down in a little more detail.\n\nFederal-Style House Exteriors\n\nFrom the outside, Federal-style houses are simple in their design, often consisting of a brick face and a basic square or rectangular floor plan. These homes are often accented by ornamental features. While there isn’t a front porch and the front door itself is simple, the detailed molding and columns surrounding it are grander than what you might encounter with similar architectural styles.\n\nFanlight doors are common as well, which include a small, half-oval window above the front door. It’s also common for Federal-style homes to have a hipped roof, or a roof where all four of the sides slope upward to a single peak.\n\nOn the rest of the house, window displays are always linear and often Palladian, meaning they feature a centralized, arched window with smaller square windows situated on either side. Dormers, or window structures that typically jut out of a roof, are also common for Federalist-style houses.\n\nAll windows, doors and details are symmetrically placed, and geometric shapes are often used.\n\nFederal-Style House Interiors\n\nDespite their rectangular exterior, you’ll find curved lines and shapes inside a Federal-style house. A common characteristic of Federal design is the oval shape, which is frequently used in things like furniture and decor. The oval shape often extends to the shape of the room itself, like in the case of the Oval Office in the White House.\n\nFederal-style interiors also typically utilize simple, muted tones on walls, accented by detailed molding and cornices. Other ornamental details include festoons, wall niches and decorative ceilings.\n\nThe History Of Federal-Style Architecture In The U.S.\n\nFederal-style architecture has been around since 1780, though it draws inspiration from Classical-, Colonial- and Georgian-style homes. Classical style architecture, popularized by Andrea Palladio during the Italian Renaissance, was known for Corinthian columns and an emphasis on symmetrical design. The Georgian house style also influenced Federalist architecture and is characterized by symmetrical designs and balanced proportions.\n\nThese style elements can easily be found within Federal design as well, though the Federal style wouldn’t come to fruition until 1780.\n\nFollowing the Revolutionary War, many Americans continued to be deeply influenced by British artists and architects like Robert Adam, whose neoclassical style would shape Federal design. The Federal style was further popularized by architects like Charles Bulfinch and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nJefferson suggested using a Roman temple as the model for the Capitol Building in Richmond, Virginia, and went on to utilize Federal principles in the design of several other well-known buildings. Today, the Federal style can be found in homes, town halls, schools and even churches.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Federal-Style Houses Bring History To Life\n\nAt its core, Federal-style architecture is rooted in symmetry and simplicity with a dash of ornamentation that sets it apart from similar house styles. Federal-style homes, which first entered the scene in 1780, can still be found sprinkled across the country. For buyers wishing to own a piece of U.S. history, a Federal-style house may be just the ticket.\n\nIf you’re ready to buy a house, apply for approval online today so you can start browsing for your dream home."
