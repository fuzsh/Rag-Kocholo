        "text": "Approaches to Literature\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 9:00 - 10:00 a.m.\n\nIn this class we will explore some of the significant techniques commonly used in different genres of writing in English. The texts we will be exploring examine the themes of technology and science. N.B.: Some of the materials for this course deal with violence and sexuality and could be considered offensive and/ or disturbing.

We'll be considering questions like: how many Englishes make up contemporary Canada? What happens to traditional concepts of genre when the great divide between poetry and prose, 'reality' and 'imagination' is challenged? Whose 'tradition' and whose ways of knowing prevail? Two novels --Eden Robinson's Monkey Beach and David Chariandy's Soucouyant-- are at the heart of the course together with a selection of poems, short stories, and an interactive website. Thanks to these writers, you'll never see Canada the same way again!\n\nRequired texts:\n\nSmaro Kamboureli, ed., Making a Difference: Canadian Multicultural Literatures in English, 2nd ed. (Oxford); Eden Robinson, Monkey Beach (Vintage); David Chariandy, Soucouyant (Arsenal); \"High Muck a Muck: Playing Chinese.\" An interactive website by Nicola Harwood, Thomas Loh, Fred Wah, et al. Nelson, B.C., Oxygen Art Center. <http://highmuckamuck.ca>\n\nApproaches to Literature\n\nTerm 1\n\nT 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. (Discussion); Th, 11:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. (Lecture )\n\n\"That's when the hornet stung me\" -- Gord Downie and the Tragically Hip, \"Ahead by A Century.\"\n\nNarrative, or the act of storytelling, is one of our most basic daily activities, as H. Porter Abbott, a narrative expert, reminds us. We encounter narratives in newspapers, advertisements, text messages, letters, novels, plays, poems, paintings, rock songs, films, political speeches, health reports, and academic textbooks. Narrative is everywhere because it is a foundational dimension of language and human thought.\n\nThis course is an introduction to the study of narrative elements, especially as found in examples of Canadian fiction, drama, poetry, and film. Some of the fundamental questions that we will take up include the following: What exactly is narrative? Why are narratives important for organizing human experience? How and why do writers manipulate narrative time?\n\nThese questions and others will be explored in lectures, group activities, discussion groups, and weekly readings in H. Porter Abbott's core textbook on narrative. The course requirements include one in-class essay, one home essay, one short answer test, pop quizzes, active participation, and a final examination.\n\nRequired texts:\n\nCORE TEXTBOOK: H. Porter Abbott, The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative, 2nd Ed.\n\nSHORT STORIES: Madeleine Thien, Simple Recipes (M &S)\n\nNOVEL: Michael Ondaatje, In the Skin of a Lion (Vintage)\n\nDRAMA: John Gray and Eric Peterson, Billy Bishop Goes to War (Talon)\n\nPOETRY/SONGS: Selected poems -- and songs by the Tragically Hip, and others\n\nFILM: Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner (Isuma/NFB 2001), directed by Zacharias Kunuk and screenplay by Paul Apak Angilirk: http://www.isuma.tv/hi/en/fastrunnertrilogy\n\nApproaches to Literature\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 10:00 - 11:00 a.m.\n\nOmnia mutantur, nihil interit (\"everything changes, nothing perishes\") -- Ovid, The Metamorphoses, book 15\n\n“Metamorphosis” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as “the action or process of changing in form, shape or substance” through either natural or supernatural means. It can also mean a change in “the appearance, circumstances, condition or character” of a person or a state of affairs. This course will explore the marvelously productive idea of metamorphosis as it is represented in a variety of literary forms and historical contexts. We will define the term loosely so we can use literature to think about physical alterations; sex changes and human-animal metamorphoses; changes of heart; environmental catastrophes; geo-political conversions; commercial exchanges and literary translations.\n\nTexts will include Ovid (The Metamorphoses), William Shakespeare (Midsummer Night’s Dream and select sonnets), John Keats (Lamia), Christina Rossetti (Goblin Market), Viginia Woolf (Orlando) and Angela Carter (“In the Company of Wolves) as well a range of works by contemporary writers including Rachel Qitsualik (“The Final Craft”) and André Alexis (Fifteen Dogs).\n\nApproaches to Literature\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.\n\nAlong with substantial work on poetry, this section of English 110 will focus on one play and two novels about shipwrecks and the people who survive them. In addition to the excitement of disaster, we will consider the significance of the ways in which these stories of the loss of what the characters understand to be “civilization” leads them to think about some of the big questions with which human beings have long struggled: What makes us human and not animal? What is human nature? What about race, gender and other kinds of difference? Who has power and why?\n\nWhat about God, and is that the same thing as religion?\n\nThrough the study of selected examples of poetry, drama, and fiction, this course will introduce students to the analytical skills and critical thinking essential to university-level literary reading, thinking and writing. In lectures and discussions, students will engage concepts of genre and form in literature and will pursue hands-on practice of methods of literary analysis.\n\nReading ahead? Choose one of HG Wells’ The Island of Dr. Moreau and Yann Martel’s The Life of Pi or Shakepeare’s The Tempest.\n\nApproaches to Literature\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 1:00 - 2:00 p.m.\n\n“Time is a valuable thing/ Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings/ Watch it count down to the end of the day/ The clock ticks life away” – Linkin Park, “In the End”\n\nIs time really so inflexible? For centuries, philosophers, artists and writers have experimented with the idea that time is not a relentless ticking of the clock - we can travel in and through time, we can change or remake history, we can experience multiple temporalities. Time travel might be a fantasy, but it is an inspirational and provocative one. In this course, we will read and discuss literary experiments with time and time travel, including two novels (H. G. Wells’ The Time Machine and Olivia Butler’s Kindred), a plays (Carol Churchill’s Top Girls), a film (Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys) and a graphic novel (Jess Fink's We Can Fix It!). We will ask particularly how playing with the past, present, and future in literature can lead us to question familiar notions of progress, causality, nature, society, race, and gender. Students will also be invited to bring to the class their own reflections on time travel and related issues as featured in film, television, and popular culture. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short essays, a creative-critical project, and a final exam.\n\nENGL 110 counts as 3 credits toward most faculties’ English/Writing requirements, and also can count as 3 credits of the Faculty of Arts Literature requirement.\n\nApproaches to Literature\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 1:00 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nThis course will examine a selection of contemporary literature from diverse Canadian contexts at a timely moment for national self-reflection. Canada marked its Sesquicentennial anniversary of Confederation this year with months of celebration culminating in the #Canada150 events on July 1, Canada Day. Yet many artists and activists pushed back against this swell of nationalist pride in creative and critical ways (within and beyond the Twittersphere), rebranding #Canada150 as #Resistance150, #Colonialism150, and #Unsettle150. These discrepant perspectives make clear that Canada has always been a contested colonial project—a site of celebration but also of struggle and conflict at different times for different communities and peoples. How does literature enable us to read the nation as a site of multiple, competing narratives? What are the forms and genres authors use to write back to, or beyond, Canada and its history? Indeed, what is a nation, what does it have to do with literature, and how many nations exist within the lands we call Canada? We will take up these and other questions by turning to a range of contemporary Indigenous and multicultural authors whose writing interrogates topics central to the story of “Canada,” such as settlement, the land, belonging, immigration, multiculturalism, and national borders. Primary texts will include Thomas King’s children’s book A Coyote Columbus Story, Eden Robinson’s gothic novel Monkey Beach, Fred Wah’s prose-poetry “biotext” Diamond Grill, and Lawrence Hill’s novel The Illegal, along with a custom selection of poetry, orature, and short films. #Canada150Plus invites you to think and write critically and creatively about literature within the complex cultural politics of Canada.\n\nApproaches to Literature\n\nTerm 2\n\nT 10:00 - 11:00 a.m. (Discussion); Th, 10:00 a.m.- 12:00 p.m. (Lecture)\n\nAs we approach the end of the second decade of the twenty-first century, the impact of the human race on the global climate are increasingly undeniable. From the beginning of the European Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, human civilization has entered what scientists now term the Anthropocene: the period of time when human activity is leaving indelible marks on the geological history of the earth. Global warming looms over our early twenty-first century civilization, with dire warnings of future catastrophe appearing on a weekly basis. But what is the average citizen supposed to do in the face of such impending doom? Recycle? Cycle? Buy a Tesla? Remember to turn your lights off when you go out? Vote Green? Take transit? Buy eco-soap? Shop local? Become vegetarian? So many small possibilities, but all seemingly insignificant in the face of the onrushing apocalyptic storm. Instead we are faced with the question of how we will experience dramatic climate change? How we will survive it? How we will witness it?\n\nIn the first section of this course we will examine how “nature writing” began in the nineteenth century, and encoded a romantic view of Nature that still impacts how western society views the environment today. We will then move on to examine how cli-fi (or climate fiction) writers of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have addressed our fears of global climate change. We will begin by reading the Nature poetry of the Romantic period, in order to understand where our ideas of Nature come from, before turning to contemporary novels and short stories that examine our current-day fears about environmental apocalypse. Texts will include: Romantic and Victorian Poetry (online selections), Learning to Die in the Anthropocene, The Collapse of Western Civilization, Cli-Fi: Canadian Tales of Climate Change (short fiction), We Stand on Guard (Canadian graphic novel), The Water Knife, Oryx and Crake, The Year of the Flood.\n\nENGL 110 counts as 3 credits toward most faculties’ English/Writing requirements, and also can count as 3 credits of the Faculty of Arts Literature requirement.\n\nApproaches to Literature\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 12:00 - 1:00 p.m.\n\nThis course looks to works of poetry, fiction, and drama to answer some fundamental questions about the place of reading and writing in our lives. Why read? Why write? Why study literature? Is writing an adequate means of self-expression? Of cultural expression? Can literature have an impact on the “material” world? Does reading give us access to the minds of others? Does it help to shape a moral worldview? How do lived identity categories like class, race, and gender shape reading and writing practices? How does technology change the place of literature in our lives? Rather than looking at reading and writing as acts that are universal and uniform across history, we will understand them as practices that both are informed by and help to inform different cultural, political, and aesthetic formations across history. At different points in history, different authors have held contrasting views of the role of literature in our lives, from those who insist that reading and writing are essential for political liberation, to those who lament the impotence of literature in the face of existential absurdity. Authors' views on these issues often find their way into literary works, whether in direct meditations on the nature of literature or through less overt “metafictional” reflections. And such considerations of reading and writing often open up broader questions about how we come to know the world and the other people we share it with—that is, about how we find and make meaning. Selections for study include works by the likes of Herman Melville, Langston Hughes, Henry James, Frederick Douglass, Mary Shelley, Bertolt Brecht, and Samuel Beckett.\n\nTexts:\n\nHenry James, The Turn of the Screw and Other Stories\n\nMary Shelley, Frankenstein: 1818 Text\n\nSamuel Beckett, Waiting for Godot\n\nBertolt Brecht, Mother Courage and Her Children\n\nFrederick Douglass, The Heroic Slave: A Cultural and Critical Edition\n\nApproaches to Non-fictional Prose\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 1:00 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nIn her graphic memoir Persepolis, Marjane Satrapi writes that she must “never forget” who she is or where she has come from. Other writers similarly turn to life narratives -- texts often known as “autobiography” or “memoir,” and expected to be both personal and “true” – to remember and then share personal experiences that they think must not be forgotten. This section of ENGL 111 will consider “non-fictional prose” by examining the stories individuals write about themselves and/or others in auto/biographical narratives. Through our analysis of the choices these writers make about how to represent experience, shape it into narrative form, and make meaning(s) of it for different audiences and purposes, we will think about the work life narratives do in the world. In particular, we will consider how life narratives offer the potential for resisting dominant (mis)representations of marginalized groups. Our readings will include five book-length narratives (Born a Crime, by Trevor Noah; Girl, Interrupted, by Susanne Kaysen; The World is Moving Around Me by Dany Laferriere; Persepolis: A Story of Childhood by Marjane Satrapi; and Woman Warrior: Memoir of a Girlhood among Ghosts by Maxine Hong Kingston), and two essays (TBA). Our discussions of these narratives will be informed by relevant scholarly conversations, and students will contribute to those conversations in a research paper as well as in two short analytical essays and a final exam.\n\nApproaches to Non-Fictional Prose\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 12:00-1:00 p.m.\n\nIn our heavily mediated world, senses of self and of place are becoming increasingly uncertain. In this course, we will examine the basic concepts behind and writing practices of literary non-fiction, focusing in particular on autobiography as a writing form (and reading work by Claudia Rankine, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Fred Wah, Kathleen Jamie, Marjane Satrapi and Maxine Hong Kingston). How do we try to write ourselves into place? How do we identify and document ourselves through writing? What are the demands of placing ourselves in particular discourses and locations? We will deal with ideas of the human subject and of the depiction of and address to others (and the creation of various kinds of community), with the complex relationships between art and fact, and with the interconnections of the graphic and spoken or written language. Questions of representation and self-fashioning will form a crucial part of our investigation into how non-fiction becomes literary work.\n\nReading and Writing About Literature\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 9:00 - 10:00 a.m.\n\nThis writing course about literature meets the Faculty of Arts writing requirement as an alternative to WRDS 150. Aristotle says, “without friends no one would choose to live, though they had all other goods.” Friendship claims to exist uniquely upon a principle of equality, in an economy of even exchange. It promises a private intimacy free from masquerade and convention; only a friend knows and loves your “true portrait,” proposes Montaigne. But what would a cultural history of friendship show? Is modern friendship something new? Could you have a friend briefly? Can friendship be erotic or romantic? This course thinks about “two going together”: remarkable friendships in fiction and in life. Some readings: Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, Angela Carter’s Nights at the Circus, a few philosophy excerpts and critical readings, selected modern short stories and poems. The course will also extend your abilities to pull together and analyze research sources, to organize and support sound and interesting arguments, and to revise and edit for clarity and tone. Four writing assignments, final exam, and lively participation.

Why do some remain popular even two or three hundred years after they were first published? And why do modern writers so often return to the form, sometimes to rewrite old tales and sometimes to compose brand-new ones? In this course, we will address these questions by reading and discussing a variety of classic tales by the Brothers Grimm, Charles Perrault, and Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont as well as modern versions of those tales by Emma Donoghue and Francesca Lia Block. We’ll end the term by examining a recent tale by Neil Gaiman that seems to have no literary predecessors. In lectures and discussions we’ll consider how fairy tales have been adapted to meet the needs of distinct historical periods, and how different critical approaches to the same text can yield entirely different—even competing—interpretations. A full description can be found here.\n\nReading and Writing about Literature\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 1:00 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nThe philosopher Simone Weil said that love is “intense, pure, disinterested, gratuitous, generous attention.” Romantic love can feel profound, even transformational. The little prince falls in love with a rose and travels from asteroid to asteroid to earth, in part, to mend his broken heart. The protagonists in the stories in Islands of Decolonial Love relate to human and non-human species intimately, even lovingly. Mandy Catron, in her book, How to Fall in Love with Anyone, tells personal stories about love and examines cultural narratives about love that have profound influence on what we expect of love.\n\nIs love merely personal, intense, private or is it also politically useful? What does literature have to say about this? Hannah Arendt argued that “love can only become false and perverted when it’s used for political purposes such as the change or salvation of the world.” On the other hand, Martin Luther King Jr. in his sermons, Strength to Love, argued for nonviolent political action as a deep and abiding expression of agape. In All About Love, bell hooks echoed this: “Love is an action. Never simply a feeling.” Leanne Simpson articulated in an interview with Naomi Klein a politic of love as antidote to extractivism, an ideology that justifies human exploitation of land, water and non-human creatures at all costs.\n\nWe’ll read three core texts in this course---The Little Prince by St. Exupery, Islands of Decolonial Love by Leanne Simpson, How to Fall in Love with Anyone by Mandy Catron---alongside philosophical excerpts and critical readings. This course offers students an introduction to the skills and practices of literary criticism. We’ll read each book closely, learn new reading strategies and encounter critical readings alongside each text to deepen our readings of it. You will be asked to write often in this course. You will be invited to ask rich and provocative questions about literary texts, find and analyze research sources and write good, clear arguments.\n\nReading and Writing About Literature\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.\n\nEnglish 100 offers a writing-intensive introduction to the discipline of literary studies through the exploration of texts in their critical contexts. It focuses on foundational skills in literary analysis, scholarly research, and critical writing. This section highlights fiction and poetry inspired by the First World War (1914-1918). The blasted landscapes, shattering losses, social upheavals, and protracted legacies of this conflict impact writers from different countries (Britain, America, Canada, and Ireland) and distinct generations (participants and descendants). In particular, we will examine selected poems by Wilfred Owen and three novels, namely The Sun Also Rises (1926) by Ernest Hemingway, The Wars (1977) by Timothy Findley, and A Long Long Way (2005) by Sebastian Barry. The issues of trauma, mourning, memory, and history shaping modern and contemporary controversies on war and society will organize our studies of celebrated texts. Critical readings and audio-visual materials will guide our conversations in the classroom. Students will be expected to contribute to discussions as they develop analytic and synthetic skills in reading and writing through the investigation of formal features, relevant contexts, and academic discourses. In addition to four writing assignments, requirements for this course include attendance, participation, and a final examination.\n\nReading and Writing About Literature\n\nTerm 1\n\nTTh, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nLiterature offers a representation of the world, but its value is more than representative. Among many considerations, this course examines how literature can render visible forms of violence otherwise unseen. Why does literature matter at all in our current cultural moment when other media are competing for our attention? How does literature morph and shift in response to other these other forms of media circulating around us? Finally, what is the social value of literature? How does literature’s placement of the reader in the role of “other” lend itself to a transformative experience?\n\nThis course will engage these questions in relation to a selection of recent literary texts and critical scholarship. Note: this section of English 100 is a writing-focused course that will require four written assignments and a final examination. Written assignments will gear you toward presenting and supporting a critical argument and responding sensitively to literary texts through analysis.\n\nReading and Writing About Literature\n\nTerm 1\n\nTTh, 2:00 - 3:30 p.m.\n\nThis section of English 100 will introduce you to the scholarly practice of literary criticism as we explore the role of emotion in literature. How does literature move us to feel and think in new and sometimes intense ways? What does literature do to us and for us? How and why does literature matter? In our exploration, we’ll encounter strategies writers employ to express affect and create the ground for communal feeling, and we’ll see how stories can move a reader through sympathy to social justice. We’ll also examine how words attempt to embody love and grief, or capture the sentiment of the times. Texts include selected poems by Emily Dickinson, as she wrote them by hand, as well as three works of prose: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, an autobiography by Harriet Jacobs; Written on the Body, a novel by Jeannette Winterson; and Hold It 'Til It Hurts, a novel by T. Geronimo Johnson. We will deepen our understanding of these texts and their contexts with critical readings and theory on affect and emotion in literature.\n\nReading and Writing About Literature\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.\n\nFocused on literary texts in their critical and theoretical contexts, ENGL 100 is a course in academic writing that fulfills the first-year component of the Faculty of Arts Writing Requirement.\n\nThis course is an introduction to the reading, enjoying, and study of both primary literary texts—including Regeneration (1992), by Pat Barker; Aleta Day (1919), by Francis Marion Benyon, and Three Day Road (2006), by Joseph Boyden—and selected secondary scholarly essays written about them. By examining several theoretical approaches to the course readings, and by applying the skills of close reading, informed discussion, formal writing, and intelligent analysis to selected poetry, fiction, and non-fiction (diaries, letters, autobiography), students will enhance their critical thinking and writing abilities and broaden their knowledge of literary elements, techniques, and types.\n\nMarking one hundred years since the infamous 1917 Battle of Vimy Ridge, this section’s theme is “‘Lest We Forget’: Literary Representations of World War I.” The first all-encompassing world conflict, World War I (1914-1918) was a murderous cataclysm which misshaped the twentieth century and haunts the twenty-first. We will examine some of the ways in which the “Great War” has been depicted in literature, music, posters, painting, and photography. We will investigate the problems of representing historical “fact” as part of a “fictional” work, the relation between history and story, and how the works under study contribute to the construction of the public memory and memorialization of a war whose surviving veterans and eyewitnesses have all passed away.\n\nReading and Writing about Literature\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.\n\nThis course will be an exciting exploration of the intricacies, conflicts, and possibilities of late twentieth, early twenty-first century identity through analysis and discussion of a variety of fictional and critical texts. We will begin with Fred Wah’s biotext Diamond Grill, and his racial shame over his cravings for garlic and rice, before moving onto Trumpet and discussions on sexuality, gender, physicality, and the trans-. The course will next shift to a consideration of the blurred line between humans and machines in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? before concluding with conversations on the Internet and social media through our reading of Feed. Our understandings of identity will undergo a constant layering process as we examine the specific identity questions in each of the works. The course will also incorporate secondary articles as we develop your critical thinking skills, your research capabilities, and your abilities to construct clear and effective written argumentation. Expect a mind altering, engaging, and enlightening ride.\n\nReading and Writing about Literature\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nAs I speculate about a January 2018 course while writing about it in March 2017, I’m aware of my future need to organize the course into a coherent whole. Right now, though, what can be stated with some degree of certainty is that the course will a) look at contemporary fiction and b) feature novels and short stories in which the past (of a protagonist, perhaps, or a remote historical era) is represented and explored. As a writing course, students will be presented with assorted analytic or argumentative assignments that will encourage them to showcase their insights about these texts. Beginning with Alice Munro's Lives of Girls and Women, the course texts include two other novels: Trumpet by Jackie Kay and The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz.\n\nReading and Writing About Literature\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 12:30 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nThis section of English 100 will introduce you to the scholarly practice of literary criticism as we explore watery tales of environmental catastrophe and upheaval. How does environment shape us and our perceptions? How have we imagined the environment and its elements in different times and cultures? What impact does our valuation of the natural world have on its material reality? How can literature help us imagine new relationships with the environment? In our exploration, we’ll study how writers use the environment in general, and water in particular, as a metaphor. We’ll consider how stories can shake up our unexamined ideas about the world and challenge us to broaden our understanding. Through close-reading and discussion, we will closely examine how authors use language to teach and delight their audiences. Texts include William Shakespeare’s play A Midsummer Night’s Dream and two works of prose: The Frozen Thames, a collection of short stories by Helen Humphreys and Green Grass, Running Water, a novel by Thomas King. We will deepen our understanding of these texts and their contexts with critical readings on ecocritical theory and literature.\n\nReading and Writing About Literature\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 2:00 - 3:30 p.m.\n\n“Have you ever retired a human by mistake?” – Rachael to Deckard, Blade Runner\n\nFrom V for Vendetta to The Hunger Games to The Walking Dead, the near-future landscapes of literary and popular culture are terrifying places. In this course, we will consider dystopian speculations that reflect on the present and recent past, especially concerning the threats of mass surveillance, profit-motivated technology, environmental crisis, and redefinitions of human identity. Our core texts will be John Wyndham’s The Chrysalids, William Gibson’s Neuromancer, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go, and the Director’s Cut of Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (though you will be encouraged to introduce other relevant texts). Through readings in current criticism and theory, we will develop strategies for textual analysis in literary and cultural studies. We will also consider the difficulty, if not impossibility, of reaching a “fixed” or consensus reading of any text. You will write two short essays, a term paper requiring secondary research, and a final examination, all focused on literary textual analysis, and will contribute to in-class and online discussion. Please check my blog at http://blogs.ubc.ca/drgmbaxter/ for updates.\n\nNOTE: THIS IS A GENERAL DESCRIPTION FOR ALL SECTIONS OF ENGL 112.\n\nThrough the study and application of the principles of university-level discourse and with emphasis on the specific genre of academic writing, this course will introduce students to critical reading and university-level writing. In lectures and discussions, instructors will focus on the rhetorical principles and strategies central to university-level discourse. Students will examine methods for discovering and arranging ideas, and they will consider ways in which style is determined by rhetorical situation and scholarly audiences. English 112 is not a remedial course. Students with serious deficiencies in their writing should seek early and expert tutorial help.\n\nNote: This course is required of students who intend to enter the Faculties of Commerce and the Schools of Nursing and Physical Education. It is also recommended by a number of other faculties\n\nand schools. Students should check the current UBC Calendar for further information about the first-year English requirements for particular faculties and schools.\n\nCourse Prerequisite: In order to remain registered in this class, all students must fulfill the First-Year English Course Entry Requirement (LPI).

The examination will test critical reading and writing skills by asking students to write two clear, coherent, well-developed essays: one analysing a passage of university-level prose in a way that demonstrates the specific critical skills learned in class, and one writing a scholarly essay in response to specific critical readings studied in class.\n\nDistribution of Marks: course work (essays and exercises), 70 marks; final examination, 30 marks.\n\nTexts: Reading lists for individual sections of the course will be available in the Language and Literature section of the UBC Bookstore in mid-August for Term 1 courses and mid-November for\n\nTerm 2 courses.\n\nLanguage Myths\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 1:00 -2:00 p.m.\n\nWhat can we believe of what we hear and read about language?\n\nIs language change bad?\n\nDo some people have “good grammar”?\n\nDoes language shape thought and/or culture?\n\nAre young people destroying the language?\n\nIs texting destroying the language?\n\nIs learning a language easier for kids?\n\nDoes your ability to learn a language reflect your intelligence?\n\nIs all thought linguistic?\n\nWhere in your brain is language located?\n\nDo bilinguals have an advantage or are they disadvantaged?\n\nIn this course, we critically examine a broad range of commonly held beliefs about language and the relation of language to the brain and cognition, learning, society, change and evolution. Students read a series of short scholarly articles in order to understand language myths, the purpose for their existence, and their validity (or not). We use science and common sense as tools in our process of “myth-busting”.\n\nCourse evaluation is based on two midterm examinations, a written project (pairs or groups), participation and attendance, including “Linguistics outside the classroom”, and low-stakes short weekly writing. For the project, students select a language myth discussed in popular media (online, newspaper, etc.). Based on scholarly readings concerning the myth as well as material covered in class, they “bust” or confirm the myth.\n\nThis course is an excellent introduction for students contemplating the English Language Major as well as an appropriate elective for students already in the Major.\n\nThis course in cross-listed as Linguistics 140 and is co-taught by instructors from the English and Linguistics Departments.\n\nNote: This course does not fulfill the university writing requirements or the literature requirement in the Faculty of Arts.\n\nPrerequisite: Prerequisite for all 100-level English courses: Language Proficiency Index (LPI) level 5 or exemption.

In lectures and discussions, students will be taught the basic concepts of genre and form in literature, and methods of literary analysis, to enable them to continue in more specialized English courses at the second year or beyond.\n\nCourse Prerequisite: completion of all sections of the Language Proficiency Index Test with a level 5 on the essay section of the Test, or exemption from the LPI requirement.\n\nCourse Requirements: regular attendance and participation in the activities of the class; a minimum of three essays, two to be written in class and one at home; and a final examination.\n\nDistribution of Marks: course work, 70 marks; final examination, 30 marks.\n\nThrough the study of a selection of non-fictional prose works ranging in length from the essay to the book, this course will enable students to extend their critical and analytical skills and to develop an awareness of the rhetorical principles that inform effective discourse. Through exposure to a variety of prose texts, principally from the twentieth century, students will develop a critical awareness of the relationship between style and meaning. They will learn how prose can mirror changing social and philosophical views, and how writers give shape to their experience and interests.\n\nCourse Prerequisite: completion of all sections of the Language Proficiency Index Test with a level 5 on the essay section of the Test, or exemption from the LPI requirement.\n\nCourse Requirements: regular attendance and participation in the activities of the class; a minimum of three essays, two to be written in class and one at home; and a final examination.\n\nDistribution of Marks: course work, 70 marks; final examination, 30 marks\n\n** not available to students in the Faculty of Arts **\n\nThrough the study and application of the principles of university-level discourse, this course will introduce students to critical reading and university-level writing with emphasis on processes of research-based writing.

The course may consider such issues as feminism, psychoanalysis, or deconstruction, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of particular approaches.\n\nCourse Prerequisite: a minimum of \"A\" in English 12 (BC equivalent) or a minimum of \"B+\" in English Literature 12 (BC equivalent).\n\nCourse Requirements: regular attendance and participation in the activities of the class; a minimum of three essays, two to be written in class and one at home; and a final examination.\n\nMark Distribution: course work (essays and exercises), 70 marks; final examination, 30 marks (or as determined by the instructor).\n\nA selective sample of past texts include:\n\nBennett & Royle, Introduction to Literature, Criticism and Theory\n\nByatt, Possession: A Romance\n\nEagleton, Literary Theory: An Introduction\n\nKaplan & Anderson Criticism: Major Statements\n\nMakaryk, ed., Encyclopedia of Contemporary Literary Theory\n\nMurdoch, The Black Prince (Penguin)\n\nRichter, ed., Falling into Theory: Views on Reading Literature\n\nShakespeare, Hamlet\n\nLiterature in Britain to the 18th Century\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 12:00 - 1:00 p.m\n\nThis course together with 490 is one of two required courses for the English Majors Program. It is intended to provide an introduction to notable works of English Literature from the Anglo Saxon period to the end of the 18th century, in a range of genres, thus preparing students for senior level courses in English. It will provide scholarly and critical tools for the study of literary and other texts, and a substantial knowledge of literature from Chaucer to Blake. Students will learn to employ strategies of close reading, library research, and textual analysis supported by reasoned argument. They will engage in lively discussion in class, be encouraged to evolve their own ideas, and to defend them effectively. We will examine several kinds of critical theory and other current methods of reading and writing about literature. Our focus will encompass the political and cultural history relevant to particular works, including matters of religious, philosophical, aesthetic and social importance. We will also investigate ideas concerning class, nationality, and gender identity relevant to these centuries. While remembering that literature is written within specific material conditions influencing its production, and usually with reference to other works, we will approach our texts as distinct imaginative constructs.\n\nTexts: “The Wanderer”, “The Dream of the Rood”; Geoffrey Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales (“General Prologue” and “The Wife of Bath’s Prologue and Tale”); Christopher Marlowe, Doctor Faustus; William Shakespeare, Antony and Cleopatra; assorted poems by Sidney, Donne, Cavendish, Marvell; selections from: John Milton, Paradise Lost; Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan; Alexander Pope, “The Rape of the Lock”, “An Essay on Man”; William Blake, The Songs of Innocence and Experience, selections from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Jane Austen, Persuasion.\n\nLiterature in Britain: 18th Century to the Present\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.\n\nEnglish 221 surveys British poetry, drama, fiction, and non-fictional prose from the 18th century to the present. This section addresses historical events spanning from the upheaval of the French Revolution (1789) to the destruction of the Twin Towers (2001). We will read a broad array of texts from The Longman Anthology of British Literature 4E/5E (2012), namely Volume 2A (The Romantics and their Contemporaries), Volume 2B (The Victorian Age), and Volume 2C (The Twentieth Century and Beyond). Writers ranging from Edmund Burke to Zadie Smith will illuminate shifts in class hierarchies, (post)colonial bonds, gender norms, and local environments, enabling us to observe continuities and differences in linguistic conventions, literary genres, thematic preoccupations, and rhetorical techniques. By situating British literature in its historical contexts, we will analyze the dynamic interrelationships between cultural tradition and social change, extending to the reinterpretations afforded by selected adaptations, documentaries, and performances. Throughout, students will cultivate spoken and written skills in literary criticism through close engagement with texts as they also compare and contrast forms, issues, and styles across historical periods. The course requirements include participation, a midterm, an essay, and a final examination.\n\nLiterature in Britain: 18th Century to the Present\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 10:00 - 11:00 a.m.\n\nThis survey will introduce students to major authors from the eighteenth century to the present, with a particular emphasis on the intertwinement of monstrosity and modernity. We begin with the works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and John Keats, then turn to Mary Shelley’s seminal monster novel Frankenstein, considering the catastrophic birth of the eponymous scientist’s creation in relation to the scientific and political upheavals of the early nineteenth century. Pausing in the middle of the nineteenth century to examine Christina Rossetti’s sinister “Goblin Market,” we then plunge into a world of decadent horror in the Victorian fin-de-siècle with such texts as Bram Stoker’s Dracula and Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray. Next, we examine the existential monstrosities of the modernists, including T.S. Eliot’s monumental long poem The Waste Land and H.P. Lovecraft’s pulp masterpiece “The Call of Cthulhu,” before finally turning to China Miéville’s sprawling New Weird fantasy Perdido Street Station. Our discussions will focus on the ways that monsters reflect and exceed cultural and ontological categories, and the aesthetic, political, and metaphysical implications such category crises engender.\n\nLiterature in Canada\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.\n\n\"Is it possible to imagine being named by a place? And – were we to contemplate such a thing – how would we come to merit that honour?\" – Don McKay, The Muskwa Assemblage\n\nCanadian identity “is less perplexed by the question ‘Who am I?’ than by some such riddle as ‘Where is here?’” – Northrop Frye\n\n“The city as we imagine it, the soft city of illusion, myth, aspiration, and nightmare, is as real, maybe more real, than the hard city one can locate on maps, in statistics, in monographs on urban sociology and demography and architecture.” – Jonathan Raban\n\nHistorical identity, national identity, regional identity, provincial identity, local identity, community identity, familial identity, peer identity, student identity. While entertaining the many influences on individual, communal and national identity in a Canadian context, we’ll investigate literature from Canada (and Vancouver).\n\nTexts are cultural artefacts: as such, they make claims about and against culture and creatively detail how humans manifest that culture or worldview. “Literature in Canada” is a class about the process of reading literature, and the different ways in which people (scholars, students) go about making meaning of it. This class is also about students finding interesting and creative ways to read and contextualize literature. Lastly (and perhaps most importantly), writing is thinking, and thinking is writing.\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nAll That Matters, Wayson Choi; Canadian Literature In English: Texts and Contexts (Volume II), eds. Moss and Sugars; Connect Online Course Page @ http://elearning.ubc.ca/connect/\n\nLiterature in Canada\n\nTerm 1\n\nTTh, 2:00 - 3:30 p.m.\n\nAs W.H. New, one of our prominent historians of Canadian Literature, has written, \"To read Canadian literature attentively is to realize how diverse Canadian culture is—how marked by politics and religion, how influenced by differences of language and geography, how preoccupied (apparently) by the empirical world, but how fascinated by the mysterious and the uncertain.\" This course will provide a survey of the historical range and diverse forms of Canadian literature and media, including First Nations oral storytelling and contemporary Inuit film, arctic exploration journals and settler memoirs, modernist and postmodern poetry, short fiction and novels. One important aspect of our study will involve the careful analysis of how language and narrative structures across different periods convey alternative systems of belief. We will also consider how competing narratives of Canadian identity are debated through the dialogues initiated by Canadian writers, and we will be especially interested in how writers either reinforce or challenge restrictive assumptions about social class hierarchies, racial and ethnic formations, and norms of gender and sexuality.\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nBrief selections from Canadian Literature in English: Texts and Contexts, Volume 2 , edited by Laura Moss and Cynthia Sugars (Pearson Education).\n\nFILM: Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner (Isuma/NFB 2001): Directed by Zacharias Kunuk; story and screenplay by Paul Apak Angilirk; English screenplay by Norman Cohn. The screenplay version is available at the Koerner library and the film is also streamed through the following website (click on “view in SD”): http://www.isuma.tv/hi/en/fastrunnertrilogy\n\nNOVELS: Alice Munro, Lives of Girls and Women (Penguin); Joy Kogawa, Obasan (Penguin); Michael Ondaatje, In the Skin of a Lion (Penguin); Thomas King, Green Grass, Running Water (Harper)\n\nA selection of brief excerpts from eighteenth and nineteenth century exploration journals, epistolary novels, settler memoirs, satire, and poetry will be available freely from open-access web sources through Project Gutenberg and Canadian Poetry Online: http://www.library.utoronto.ca/canpoetry/\n\nCourse Requirements: Four short-answer content quizzes: 10%; 2) In-class Essay: 20%; Home essay: 30%; Class participation: 10%; final exam: 30%.\n\nLiterature in Canada\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 2:00 - 3:30 p.m.\n\nThis course will track the work of a group of writers who walk and write Vancouver, a Coast Salish city on the river whose watery course traces generations of diasporic movements and histories. Our journey begins on Musqueam territory and follows the watercourse to New Brighton Park and the urban waterfront with Lisa Robertson and Meredith Quartermain as our guides. Making our way to Hastings Park, we will reflect on Obasan and the Japanese-Canadian Redress movement. Steveston takes us to the south arm of the river and a different history of the Issei as well as of the river itself. Compton and Thien return us to the complexities of Indigenous and diasporic communities in the city. An online coursepack will enable us to read selections a variety of contemporary writers relevant to course themes. Pre-reading of the major course texts is encouraged.\n\nReading list (provisional)\n\nJoy Kogawa, Obasan\n\nDaphne Marlatt, Steveston\n\nMeredith Quartermain, Vancouver Walking\n\nRita Wong, Undercurrent\n\nMadeline Thien, Simple Recipes\n\nCoursepack including selections from Lisa Robertson, Roy Miki,, Eden Robertson, Wayde Compton, Steve Collis, Gregory Scofield, Alex Leslie.\n\nLiterature in the United States\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 12:00 - 1:00 p.m.\n\nThis course offers a selective introduction to literature written in the United States between the 1830s and the 1930s. The course material ranges from essays (by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Thoreau, and W.E.B. Du Bois), to short stories (by Edgar Allan Poe and Dashiell Hammett), poetic projects (Emily Dickinson’s and Walt Whitman’s), novels (by Frank Norris and Nella Larsen), and comics (by George Herriman). Our work will be to read and think about this writing in relation to a number of different kinds of environments: literary, aesthetic, theoretical, historical, and political. We will be thinking about what is going on in the text and around it – in its historical moment as well as in the present of our reading. The span of roughly one hundred years covered in this course saw enormous transformations which helped to compose the texture of contemporary North American life: rapid industrialization, shifting centers of power towards big urban centers, a civil war (1861-66) and the economic changes following the end of slavery, political consolidation and the emergence of an America with imperial interests, and changes in relations among and between genders, races, classes, and sexualities. A main goal of the course is to introduce students to literary critical reading practices in order to develop techniques for beginning to describe how a given text engages with its various moments, including this one.\n\nLiterature in the United States\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 10:00 - 11:00 a.m.\n\nThis course surveys some of the great innovators in the U.S. novel over the past 50 to 60 years, ranging across the stalwarts of realism, postmodernism, and the proliferation of important multicultural voices in the American canon. Questions we will address include: What have been the major innovations in fictional form in the U.S. in the past sixty years, and what forces seem to have driven them? What structures have writers developed in this era to demonstrate new layers of guilt, innocence, and moral complexity? Does the novel, as informational and imaginative medium, have authority in this era? If so, what sort of authority is it? What difference has the explosion in prominent ethnic writers within U.S. literature made for definitions of “American culture”? Students will write three essays: a close-reading paper (about 500 words) and two longer papers (1500 and 2000 words), as well as a final exam. Texts are likely to include Philip Roth’s The Ghost Writer, Joan Didion’s Play It As It Lays, Toni Morrison’s Jazz, Chang-rae Lee’s A Gesture Life, Jennifer Egan’s A Visit From the Goon Squad, and one other.\n\nWorld Literature in English\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 1:00 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nThis course on colonial education offers an introduction to some of the key concerns of postcolonial studies, and attempts to reflect both the range and the particularity of postcolonial cultural and critical practices by emphasizing works written from and about the Anglo-speaking Caribbean (Antigua, Barbados, Trinidad) and Southern Africa (Botswana and Zimbabwe). The imaginative work of the five authors help us think through ways colonial school system was an arm of the British empire and was established to promote its educational agenda and curriculum, thus enforcing allegiance to Britain. In what ways are (classical) education and imperialism closely linked in English colonial expansion? Is there an entwined history of colonial education and the rise of English literature as a discipline in its own right? Issues for investigation will include: relations of identity, difference, place, displacement and dispossession; the aesthetics and politics of representation; decolonization and anti-colonial resistance; alternative and interventionist histories; critical and contextual studies of race, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, history, and sexuality.\n\nIntroduction to Drama\n\nTerm 1\n\nTTh, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nIn this course, we will explore theories of laughter and its theatrical expressions through the study of comedies that take us from ancient Greece to the present-day. How does comedy challenge political, religious and social norms? Through laughter, our certainties are scrutinized and broken down, and in the world of comedy, rebellion itself often becomes the norm. Power hierarchies are reversed, and the unexpected results expand our ideas of what is possible. The most powerful comedy refuses to be polite, and invites its spectators to become participants in unruly behaviour and unruly ideas. We will encounter leaders of misrule in our plays, and examine what can happen when rules are violated and disorder overcomes order. We will attend live performances of plays and explore theatrical worlds through performance exercises. Our plays will include Lysistrata, Twelfth Night and The Importance of Being Earnest, among others.\n\nProse Fiction\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 10:00 - 11:00 a.m.\n\nThis course will delve into fictional worlds of teen angst, desire, and identity negotiations by focusing on a selection of recent bestselling YA novels (Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Twilight, The Hunger Games, The Uglies, The Knife of Never Letting Go). The course will begin by considering genre and the possibilities of YA texts and their in-between readership. We will examine each of the texts, considering how questions of subjectivity, sexuality, trauma/violence, subjectivity, and agency manifest themselves. Our discussions will also confront the market popularity/success of these works and the problematic and/or “successful” ways in which they mobilise the demands of their readers/viewers. We will also address enabling re-writings, especially how fantastical, dystopian, and vampirical imaginings allow for different accessing and confronting of the struggles and preoccupations of fraught adolescent years. Prepare to revisit your teen years in all their complex, ambivalent, and empowering glory.\n\nProse Fiction\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nFrom Time magazine’s May 2014 cover story, “The Transgender Tipping Point,” to National Geographic’s January 2017 special issue dedicated to the “gender revolution,” the question of what gender is and where it might be going is top of mind at present. As a recent spate of so-called “bathroom bills” suggests—as well as one Canadian professor’s much-publicized refusal to use gender-neutral pronouns—not everyone is happy about these developments. Unsurprisingly, artistic and cultural expression have not been immune to this activity, leading to television shows and movies like Transparent, Sense8, and The Danish Girl, as well as a seeming renaissance of novels, short stories, poetry, and literary non-fiction by transgender authors (including prominent Canadians like Casey Plett, Kai Cheng Thom, Jia Qing Wilson-Yang, Vivek Shraya, Tom Cho, and Chase Joynt). New literary presses dedicated to publishing such work have even sprung up. Some argue that this changing understanding of gender is evidence of a rapidly decaying social fabric, and can only lead to social destruction, while others praise it for moving society toward unprecedented liberation and freedom for people of all genders, old and new. Through a selection of novels and short stories, television and film, as well as new media, we’ll investigate this turbulent and changing cultural and literary landscape. Whose gender counts, and whose doesn’t? Where is gender going? Will we even recognize it when we get there?\n\nTopics in the Study of Language and/or Rhetoric\n\nTerm 1\n\nTTh, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nExpressing meaning is why we use language in the first place, but understanding how we choose the words is not straightforward. How do we decide whether to see the tree in front of the house or the house behind the tree? Why can someone’s smile be described as warm or cold even though temperature is not the issue? If someone has done something nice for you, why do say you owe them? In the course, we will learn how linguistic meaning emerges at the intersection of our embodied experience, our conceptual abilities, and our social and cultural context. Through reading and analysis of examples, we will learn what it means to view language as a tool supporting conceptualization. Examples illustrating the concepts will come from various areas of linguistic usage, including a range of textual genres, some grammatical constructions, and the discourse of the media.\n\nApproaches to Media Studies\n\nTerm 1\n\nTTh, 9:30 - 11:00 a.m.\n\nBased on Julian McDougall’s text Media Studies: the basics (2012), this course will invite students to investigate various approaches to the study of media and popular culture, focusing in particular on the analysis of representation, of reception, fandom and interpretation, of technology and materiality, and of globalization and cultural impact. Through the term, we will take up a set of five or six cases studies centred on various media and media platforms: a recording (Bob Marley and the Wailers, Catch a Fire), an audio podcast (Welcome to Night Vale), a television show (Stranger Things or Buffy the Vampire Slayer), a novel (Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone), a comic (Black Panther, 2016), and a video game (Minecraft). How do the studies of mass media and of popular culture intersect? What do popular media tell us about how we think and communicate and create today?\n\nRhetoric of Science, Technology, and Medicine\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nOn May 8, 2016, the main story on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver concerned scientific studies. Oliver talked about media reports of not-really-scientific studies that invite people to believe that certain findings, even in the face of completely contradictory findings, are reasonable bases for decision making, especially on matters of health. You can see Oliver’s 19-minute segment at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw. Less than a year later, it has had nearly 10 million views. English 309 takes up, among its topics, some of Oliver’s concerns.\n\nAlthough we typically think of science as existing in a realm separate from the realm of rhetoric (that is, persuasion), it is actually the case that science, even when it is working very well, relies on persuasion quite a bit. In fact, persuasion occurs in spaces we don’t typically think of as rhetorical: in the pages of scientific journals, in laboratories, in working groups tasked with arriving at diagnostic categories, in meetings of the FDA, and so on.\n\nGiven the prominence of health topics in public discourse currently, the course pays special attention to the rhetoric of health and medicine, especially as scientific (and quasi-scientific) knowledge migrates into a public realm. Here are some questions we’ll consider: What are the strategies, and what are the effects, of direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription pharmaceuticals? How does the Internet, and how does public-health messaging, help to shape the contemporary health subject? What is the persuasive effect of technologies of self-tracking? Is the “vaccine controversy” really a controversy?\n\nNote: English 309 requires no special preparation in rhetorical theory or in science and medicine.\n\nDiscourse and Society: Analysing Spoken Discourse\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.\n\nThe activity of conversation is central to our lives and to the construction of our social identities. Yet in formal linguistic studies, casual conversation is often overlooked in favour of written texts or instances of spoken text involving a single speaker. This course introduces discourse analysis techniques for the analysis of language events involving interaction between two or more speakers. Drawing on a range of linguistic and semiotic approaches, we will study dialogue as a semantic activity. We will explore techniques for analyzing language at a variety of linguistic levels, from micro-patterns in the grammar of conversation, to turn-taking, to text type and genre.\n\nThe general goals of the course will be: 1) Developing skills in using analytic techniques to describe and interpret dialogue in context; 2) Developing skills in seeing pattern frequency and functional variety in spoken texts; 3) Finding how natural language can be viewed as a resource for social interaction and activity; and 4) Designing and producing a research project involving the collection and analysis of conversational or other natural language data. There will be a number of in-class and take-home assignments including learning activities (6 activities worth 2% each), a midterm assignment (15%), presentations (10%), a quiz (15%) and a final project (40%). Students will be encouraged to collect and analyze their own data. The textbook for the course will be Eggins and Slade’s Analysing Casual Conversation (Cassell 1997/2005).\n\nHistory of the English Language: Early History\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF 1:00 -2:00 p.m.\n\nThis course provides an understanding of how the English language has changed in from its Indo-European origins to the end of the Anglo-Saxon period (1100). It begins with discussion of attitudes towards language change, the nature, causes, and mechanisms of linguistic change, and the genealogical and typological classification of languages. It then embarks upon a survey of the historical development of English.\n\nConsidering first the prehistoric changes from Proto-Indo-European to Germanic, we will then study how the language called Old English (449-1100). developed. We will look at all aspects of the Old English language, including its sounds (phonology), spelling (orthography), forms of words and their endings (morphology), sentence structure (syntax), and meanings of words (semantics), and vocabulary. Our focus will be on the “synthetic” nature of Old English grammar. In addition to language-internal causes of change, there will be discussion of the “external history” of the language, that is, the historical, political, and social events that shaped Old English.\n\nEvaluation is in terms of four online quizzes, two in-class midterms, and a short written project. For a complete description, see http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/lbrinton/\n\n**** No formal background in language or linguistics is required, but students must have third-year standing and have completed the Writing Requirement of their Faculty.****\n\nHistory of the English Language: Later History\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF 11:00 a.m. -12:00 p.m.\n\nThis course provides students with an understanding of how the English language has changed from the Norman Conquest (1100) to today.\n\nThe course begins with a description of the historical events leading to the growth of Middle English (1100–1500). The linguistic features of Middle English are studied, focusing on the rise of analytic features. We then trace phonological, grammatical, and lexical changes into Early Modern English (1500–1700), with an emphasis on the Great Vowel Shift. Grammatical and lexical changes in the Late Modern English period (1700-1920) are explored and the rise of prescriptivism in the eighteenth century is studied in depth. Finally, the course considers lexical and grammatical changes in Present-Day English and the effects of media and computer-mediated language upon the development of English. The concept of ‘global English’ is also explored.\n\nCourse evaluation is in terms of four online quizzes, two in-class, and one short written project. For a complete description, see http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/lbrinton/\n\n*****Knowledge of the International Phonetic Alphabet is required. ENGL 318 or ENGL 330 or the equivalent is recommended. Students must have third-year standing and have completed the Writing Requirement of their Faculty.*******\n\nEnglish Grammar and Usage\n\nTerm: 1\n\nMWF, 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to English grammar and usage. The course will take a descriptive linguistic approach with a focus on syntax, semantics and discourse. We will begin with the study of basic sentence structure. We will classify parts of speech and identify transitivity patterns and grammatical functions. We will describe in detail the structure of noun phrases and verb phrases, with specific attention to patterns of modification. We will then analyze coordination and subordination in clauses. Throughout the course, consideration will be given to developing consciousness of the natural rhythms of language, applying knowledge of grammar for self-expression, and understanding the relevance of grammar for everyday communication and the usefulness of prescriptive rules. The emphasis will be on learning to do grammatical description and understanding how the rules of English grammar are applied for effective communication.\n\nEvaluation will be based on 2 tests worth 21% each, a final group project (10%) and a final assignment (30%). There will also be a series of short, practical activities worth 10% in total. One of these will be graded (4%), and the others will be given grades for completing them. The textbook for the course is Huddleston and Pullum’s A Student's Introduction to English Grammar, Paperback (Cambridge University Press, 2005). Prerequisites are six credits of first year English or the equivalent.\n\nEnglish Grammar and Usage\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 12:30 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nThe English 321 course provides an introduction to English grammar and its use in everyday communication. We take a descriptive stance when considering the rules of grammar, starting with the study of words and their parts, proceeding to word classes, phrases and clauses, and concluding with the different communicative functions that grammatical structures can perform when we package information in particular ways. This course equips students with skills to identify and describe the effects of derived or deviant structures in various communicative situations and provides a strong basis for further study of the English language and of literary and non-literary stylistics as well as for teaching English. The course includes numerous exercises analyzing sentences and chunks of discourse. Students complete one collaborative assignment, two monthly tests, and a final exam counting 30% of the final grade. The prescribed books are Börjars & Burridge (2010) and Leech, Deuchar and Hoogenraad (2006).\n\nEnglish Grammar and Usage\n\nTerm A\n\nOffered Online\n\nThis section of ENGL 321 is offered online.

We will look at regional variation (“dialects”), starting with linguistic atlas projects and their approaches to the study of variation. After dealing with Canadian English as a geographical (regional) dialect, we will consider linguistic and social co-variation in its most prevailing aspects: linguistic variation and age of the speaker, social class, social networks (as a pre-facebook concept). A research component is offered with a guided study of linguistic variation in texting, for which we will use the data in your own phones and you will work together with a partner.\n\nWe will give considerable focus to language and gender (Is there a men’s or women’s language? What about transgender speakers?), involving aspects of linguistic performance and identity creation. The last part of the course explores concepts of World English (now often used in the plural: “World Englishes”) and how the use of English varieties world-wide is influencing the English language as a whole: now that more speakers use English as a second language than as a first language, what are the consequences?\n\nThis course is recommended for anyone interested in the English language, including aspiring teachers of English. No linguistic knowledge is needed, but a willingness to acquire basic linguistic terminology, to be introduced over the semester, is welcome.\n\nThe Structure of Modern English: Sounds and Words\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.\n\nThis course explores and examines contemporary English linguistic structure at the level of sounds and words. It begins with a study of speech sounds. We study the articulation of sounds in English, methods for phonetic transcription and the possible sound combinations in English (phonology). We then study words, and the processes of word formation and word classification in English (morphology). Finally, we consider word meaning and look at a variety of approaches to appreciating the nuances of meaning in English words (lexical semantics). Our focus will be on developing skills for analysing these three components of language, with an eye toward understanding how they belong to one communication system. There will be 3 tests of equal weight (30%) and a class participation mark of 10%. A variety of in-class, homework and test questions will be given, including definitions, fill in the blanks, problem solving, short answer questions and matching. The textbook for the course will be Brinton and Brinton’s The Linguistic Structure of Modern English (Benjamins, 2010).\n\nThe Structure of Modern English: Sentences and Their Uses\n\nTerm 1\n\nTTh, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to the structure of sentences and their uses in Modern English. We study the structure of phrases and the clause functions of phrases, sentence types, finite and non-finite clauses and sub-clauses, the meaning of sentences, information packaging and speech acts. Students are required to learn the techniques of labelled bracketing and tree diagrams for syntactic description. The course is offered from a descriptive perspective, an approach not situated exclusively in any specific linguistic theory. To be successful in this course, it is important to participate in the numerous exercises assigned from the workbook and in addition to it. There are three monthly tests, the last of which is the final exam, each contributing one third towards the final grade. The prescribed book is Brinton & Brinton (2010).\n\nThe Structure of Modern English: Sentences and their Uses\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 12:00 - 1:00 p.m.\n\nIn this course, we study the form and use of English sentences. In the first part, we learn to describe English sentential forms and recognize the connections between the structures we choose and the meanings we express. In the second part of the course, we investigate how speakers choose linguistic expressions to match the situation of use. We look at various contexts, such as journalistic reporting, conversational discourse, or narrative discourse. The emphasis throughout the course is on the description of English as it is now used rather than on any linguistic theory in particular. No linguistics background is required, but some familiarity with English grammar is helpful. Students are expected to acquire a broad area of technical vocabulary and develop enough knowledge and skill to be able to work on new examples and problems, in class and in test situations.\n\nApproaches to Media History\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 2:00 - 3:30 p.m.\n\nWhat can we discover about historical media and the technologies that underlie them through reading literary works? This course aims to answer this question through case studies in the cultural significance of five technologies from the last two centuries: electromagnetic telegraphy, photography, radio, film, and television. It investigates the meanings of these technologies by way of literary writing as well as historical, critical, and theoretical texts. The course is premised on the idea that writing and print, themselves mediums, are particularly sensitive to the emergence of those new media that pertain to writing (those based on -graphy technologies). By paying close attention to writing as well as to poetics (ideas about how writing works), we will explore the possibilities and limits that accompany new technologies, and the discourses by which they are understood. Note, our geographical focus will be mostly, but not exclusively, the United States. We are interested in the spatial and conceptual idea of \"America\" as it comes to be identified with so-called mass media in the twentieth century. This course will be taught as a mix of lecture and discussion.\n\nIntroduction to Old English\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.\n\n“You must remember we knew nothing of [Old English]; each word was a kind of talisman we unearthed…And with those words we became almost drunk.” –Jorge Luis Borges, “Blindness”\n\nOld English provides an uncanny sensation: so different from present-day English that it must be studied as a foreign language, it is an ancestor whose patterns reveal themselves quickly to the learner. Old English literature is strange, intimate, and violent: an exile paddles in the ice with his bare hands, listening to birdsong; a feud erupts at a wedding; a tree, torn from the wilderness to become an unwilling instrument of torture, clings to Christ in what Borges calls a lovers’ embrace. This literature is usually read in translation, but in this class you will begin to read it in the original. You will learn the fundamentals of Old English grammar, vocabulary and syntax, the basic rules of poetic composition, and unusual features that have been lost in the journey from Old to present-day English.\n\nMedieval Studies\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.\n\nWe will read, in modern English translation, works in several of the languages of twelfth-century Britain. The “contests” of this era included, among others, those between contenders for the throne; rivalry between Church and state; disputes over the “true” history of Britain; battles for control of various border regions; and the confrontation of tradition with new ideas arising in the renascence of twelfth-century Europe. While keeping steadily in view the history and geography of Britain, we will also explore the shifting borders of different kinds of writing, such as chronicle, romance, saga, topographical description, saint’s life, miracle narrative, and “history.” Our goal will be to understand how diversity, fluidity, and translation (broadly defined) could serve as sources of energy and creativity even in an age beset by political division and catastrophe. Works to be read will include selections from Geoffrey of Monmouth, Layamon, Gerald of Wales, Marie de France, and from anonymous works such as the Peterborough Chronicle.\n\nMedieval Studies\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 12:30 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nMedieval romance (OF: romanz) was one of the most popular of medieval genres. First appearing in the twelfth century as the predominant mode of literary entertainment of the aristocratic courts of Western Europe, romance narratives dominated European literature for much of the Middle Ages. Early romances took as their theme the lives, battles, and loves of chivalric knights and ladies, but the romance genre was – over time – appropriated for purposes as diverse as religious instruction, national and global identity politics, and eventually parody and humour.\n\nThis course will examine the romances of medieval England during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, in what has been termed the great flowering of late medieval romance. During this period the genre became highly popular not only with the nobility, but also with the rising mercantile and gentry classes of England, and this changing audience – and the changing expectations that they brought with them – led to a literature diverse in both form and content. We shall be reading of knights and ladies, giants and dragons, incestuous fathers and wicked usurpers, fearsome Saracens, malicious Faeries, children of the devil, lepers who bathe in baths of blood, and – of course – sex and sword-play. All in all, a bit like A Game of Thrones but with more difficult grammar.\n\nShakespeare and the Renaissance\n\nTerm 1\n\nTTh, 12:30 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nThis course takes as its starting point Peter Quince's words to Bottom the weaver: \"Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art translated.\" This course we will consider the idea of translation as it is intended here: as metamorphosis, or to use another term relevant to Shakespeare’s contemporaries, conversion.\n\nIn our discussion of Shakespeare’s writing we will keep religious conversion in mind but we will also open up our definition of the term to include other forms of transformation: alchemy and other physical alterations; sex changes and human-animal metamorphoses; changes of heart; environmental catastrophes; geo-political conversions; commercial exchanges; literary translations. We will also ask how literary forms of conversion (both poetic and dramatic) transformed their audiences by translating various kinds of knowledge.\n\nPrimary texts will likely include The Taming of the Shrew, Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Henry V, King Lear, The Winter’s Tale, Cymbeline, The Sonnets, Venus and Adonis\n\nShakespeare and the Renaissance\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.\n\nThis course will focus primarily on the plays of Shakespeare, with some attention given to other Renaissance dramatic and non-dramatic works. We will discuss Shakespeare’s plays in the context of his particular moment in cultural history, when Renaissance Humanism began to falter, the emerging Sciences were challenging traditional knowledge in a number of spheres, emerging capitalism was displacing traditional ways of life, and religious, philosophical, and political controversy had become increasingly divisive. We will also examine aspects of domestic, sexual and social interaction relevant for the study of these works. Our readings of the drama will take into account the conditions influencing production, Elizabethan playing, and audience reception. A variety of different critical approaches will be explored, including those of earlier decades, and those more current. Shakespeare’s theatre can be seen as a commercial enterprise, licensed by the authorities, and dependent on royal patronage, involving complex negotiations of class and subjectivity. It can also be seen as a marginal or liminal space wherein the dilemmas of Shakespeare’s time and now of our own can be evoked and given form; where competing cultural voices find expression; where “things as they are” can be challenged by the very manner of their representation. The dramatic poetry of Shakespeare is both historical document and unfinished experiment - a boundlessly eventful experiential realm.. To enhance our understanding of the dramatic texts in their time, we will discuss brief selections from the works of Montaigne, Machiavelli, Giordano Bruno, and other important figures of the English and Continental Renaissance. Film versions of the plays will be viewed as time permits.\n\nPlays: Shakespeare, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, King Lear, Coriolanus, Cymbeline; John Webster, The Duchess of Malfi\n\nCourse requirements: Students will be asked to write one researched term paper and one in-class essay, as well as a final exam.\n\nSeventeenth-Century Studies\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 12:00 - 1:00 p.m.\n\nThis course proposes to bring drama, poetry and pictures together on a number of historical and aesthetic planes. We will explore the tensions between words and images that were figured in the religious discourses of the early modern period. We will look at poetic figures that ask readers to see pictures and we will consider moments of lyric introspection in plays that beg spectators to hear words. We will consider the role of vision and audition in the reception of both poetry and drama and we will compare private reading to the experience of public viewing. We will explore how writers conceptualized the differences between stage and page and we will think of what it means to understand literary works as visual things, not entirely different from paintings, prints and statues. We will also take stock of the developing publishing industry, the rise of the commercial theatres in London and the growing interest in prints and art collecting.\n\nAuthors studied will include: William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Thomas Middleton, John Webster, Aemelia Lanyer, John Donne, Andrew Marvell, George Herbert, John Milton and Aphra Behn.\n\nStudies in an Eighteenth-Century Genre\n\nTerm 1\n\nTTh, 12:30 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nCurrent studies popular culture have illuminated the complex relationships that individuals and groups maintain with the larger artistic, political, and social movements around them. Through detailed engagements with theorizations and representations of popular culture, our class will work collaboratively to illuminate the relationships among high culture, popular culture, and women’s culture and the ways in which the conventional masculinization of high culture constitutes the feminine as the popular. Recognition and of the historically naturalized links between the feminine and the popular in fiction (both frivolous, both products of fashion, both determined by performance and consumption) will provide a scaffold for our work in other literary and cultural contexts that have previously been regarded as separated by less nuanced boundaries of high and low culture.\n\nWhile most of this course will focus on women and popular culture in the eighteenth century, we will end with a module on the ways in which eighteenth-century women are depicted in modern popular culture, including fiction adaptations such as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, graphic novelizations, and film/television adaptations. Texts will include works by Aphra Behn, John Gay, Eliza Haywood, Mary Davys, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Samuel Johnson, and Jane Austen, plus material in course packages on areas such as music, letters, actresses, and fashion.\n\nWant to read ahead this summer? read try Austen’s Pride and Prejudice; Behn’s The Fair Jilt; Haywood’s The Masqueraders and/or Richardson’s Pamela.\n\nStudies in an Eighteenth-Century Genre\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 12:00 - 1:00 p.m.\n\nThe century that separates the portraits of Montagu Drake and the Wood children saw many changes in how children were understood and treated. By the end of the eighteenth century, for example, almost no one took seriously any more John Locke’s belief that children should be prepared for the demands of adult life through cold baths, hard beds, and leaky shoes; and, as Lawrence Stone notes, parental practices of giving more than one child the same name and recycling the names of dead children had more or less died out. In this course, we will examine how seventeenth- and eighteenth- century beliefs about childhood influenced writing for and about children and adolescents. We will consider such matters as parent-child relations, the models of education proposed by John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the rise of literature for young readers, and the commodification of childhood. Throughout the course, we will place particular emphasis on the connections between the educational theory of the time and children’s reading.\n\nStudies in Romanticism\n\nTerm 2\n\nMWF, 1:00-2:00 p.m.\n\nTwo decades ago, Fredric Jameson described the emergence of imperial and global networks at the end of the eighteenth century as an event in the history of thought and feeling as well as in political and economic history. He wrote that the “experience of the individual. . . becomes limited to a tiny corner of the social world. . . . But the truth of that experience no longer coincides with the place in which it takes place. The truth of that limited daily experience of London lies, rather, in India or Jamaica or Hong Kong; it is bound up with the whole colonial system of the British Empire that determines the very quality of the individual’s subjective life.” This course revisits Jameson’s statement in the form of two questions: how did British writers at the turn of the nineteenth century experience (consider, perceive, or sense) the emergence of global networks? How did they represent or register their experience in their work? We will read works by writers who explored or travelled, by migrant, emigrant, and immigrant writers, and by writers who spent time imagining connections between themselves, or Britain, and the world. While our readings will be arranged around four important categories in the early nineteenth-century history of Britain’s global activities (slavery, commerce, exploration, love), we will also think in an ongoing way about the relationships and resonances among these categories, and these readings.\n\nStudies in a Nineteenth-Century Genre\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 10:00 - 11:00 a.m.\n\n“I know that ghosts have wandered on the earth.” – Emily Brontë, Wuthering Heights\n\nWhether we take Edith Cushing, Abraham Van Helsing, and Heathcliff at their word, the 19th-century Gothic revival certainly emphasized possibilities for horror and terror in tales of the supernatural. However, these interventions of un-dead beings often take place in the recognizable present; they speak to its anxieties. Perhaps they speak to ours as well, given our recent fascination with Neo-Victorian texts such as Penny Dreadful, From Hell, Crimson Peak, etc. As we journey into the dark days of autumn, we will address issues of gender and sexuality; class, race, and culture; realism and the supernatural; urban and rural settings, all in a century known for developments in science and technology, social upheaval, and a veneer of respectability, yet with monsters lurking in closets and under beds. The tentative core text list includes Wuthering Heights, Carmilla, Dracula, The Turn of the Screw, and short fiction including works by Elizabeth Gaskell, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, M.R. James, Arthur Machen, Sheridan LeFanu, W.W. Jacobs, and E. Nesbit (and possibly others; we may even look at a few excerpts from the genuine penny dreadful serial, Varney the Vampire). We will consider the evolution of academic critical responses (as well as popular reaction) to such texts, and the way in which such texts have shaped the way we think about and visualize the 19th century. Evaluation will be based on two short essays, a term paper, and a final examination, all focused on literary textual analysis, as well as contribution to in-class and Connect-based discussion. Please check my blog at http://blogs.ubc.ca/drgmbaxter/ for a fuller description of the course, its texts, and its requirements (this will be posted in late April or early May).\n\nStudies in a Nineteenth-Century Genre\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nThis course explores a prominent strand of nineteenth-century U.S. fiction that is distinguished by its concern to influence society and politics by appealing to and generating extreme audience feeling, whether terror or floods of tears. In addition to looking at the texts in the list below, we will be looking at theorists who try to explain how human emotion and intellect might be related to our apprehension of works of fiction. Classes will consist of lectures, discussions, and small group work. Primary Texts include: Susanna Rowson, Charlotte Temple (1791); tales of Edgar Allan Poe, including, \"Ligeia\" (1834); \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" (1839); \"The Black Cat\" (1843); \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1842); “The Purloined Letter”(1844); tales of Nathaniel Hawthorne, including \"The Birthmark\" (1843) \"Rappaccini's Daughter\" (1844); Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852); Herman Melville, \"The Paradise of Bachelors and The Tartarus of Maids\" (1855); Rebecca Harding Davis, “Life in the Iron Mills” (1861); Charlotte Perkins Gilman, \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" (1892); Henry James, The Turn of the Screw (1898); Kate Chopin, The Awakening (1899). We will also be reading theories of fear and disgust, including works by Sigmund Freud and Julia Kristeva.\n\nNineteenth-Century Studies\n\nTerm A\n\nOffered Online\n\nThis course focuses on 5 Victorian novels known for being sensational, not only in their plots, but in their challenges to the norms of their society. In these novels, we encounter women who refuse to be silent and obedient, and men who refuse to be respectable and self-controlled. Instead, by challenging class constraints, gender constraints and even the constraints of the physical world, characters such as Bertha Mason, Tess Durbeyville, Dr. Jekyll and Dorian Gray draw attention to the constructed nature of their world, and put themselves in danger of losing family, status and even selfhood. We will explore how rebels come to be seen as either mad or dangerous monsters that must be destroyed.\n\nAssigned novels: Jane Eyre, Tess of the D’Urbervilles, Hard Times, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Picture of Dorian Gray\n\nThis is an online course, and the full description is here.\n\nThe History of the Book\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 9:30 - 11:00 a.m.\n\n“Never judge a book by its cover,” we are often told, and yet we do judge books, not only by their covers, but also by their typefaces, their illustrations, and any number of other factors not apparently directly related to their content. This course will introduce students to book history, a discipline that unravels the complex relationships between particular books, the texts they contain, the cultures that produced them, and the readers who encounter them.\n\nWe will explore how materiality and meaning interact, in a range of historical and cultural contexts. Along the way, students will learn about the many forms texts have taken over the centuries, from oral recitations to ebooks, and everything in between.\n\nA unique feature of this course is that we will meet regularly in Rare Books and Special Collections. Here, students will have the opportunity for hands-on experience with a wide collection of rare materials dating from the Middle Ages to the present. Course assignments will include explorations of typefaces, cover design, and non-print formats. For the final assignment, each class member will adopt a favourite item from the RBSC collection, and will research and write about it, to introduce it to a wide audience. The result will be a book blog (using UBC blogs or similar tools). Students will leave this course with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience concerning the history, and future, of media-text interactions.\n\nCourse text: Michelle Levy and Tom Mole, eds., The Broadview Reader in Book History\n\nTwentieth-Century British and Irish Studies\n\nTerm 2\n\nTTh, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nThis course explores the complex cultural legacies of watershed events in the history of Britain and Ireland: the Great War and the Easter Rising. Over one hundred years after the Proclamation of the Irish Republic in Dublin (April 1916) and the notorious losses at the Battle of the Somme (July 1916), we will reflect on the contested meanings of these fateful conflicts throughout the twentieth-century and beyond, meanings shaped differently in relation to class, creed, gender, generation, and nation. We will read selected poetry and fiction from Britain (Wilfred Owen, The Poems of Wilfred Owen; Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway; Pat Barker, Another World) as well as drama and fiction from Ireland and Northern Ireland (Sean O’Casey, The Plough and the Stars; Frank McGuinness, Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme; Sebastian Barry, A Long Long Way). We will study celebrated authors and canonical texts as we also attend to social and cultural history by engaging with documentaries, memorials, music, and propaganda. This course invites students to consider charged sites of individual and collective memory in Britain and Ireland through modern and contemporary literature as well as popular culture. Course requirements include participation, a group presentation, an annotated bibliography, a research essay, and a final examination.\n\nTwentieth-Century British and Irish Studies\n\nTerm A\n\nOnline Course\n\nThis course examines developments in British writing and its milieu from the turn of the 20th century to 1930. Our readings provide the opportunity to explore the major preoccupations of various British and Irish modernists – preoccupations both aesthetic (including narrative voice, experiments in reproducing individual perception, novel shape and focus, the influence of visual arts movements) and political (including first wave feminism, questions concerning gender constructs, anti-industrialism, the end of empire). We’ll consider various constructions of the modernist canon, including the one created by the Leavisites and New Critics, the various revisions by feminists and post-colonial and race critics/historians in the latter half of the 20th century, and the versions presented more recently by the “new modernisms.” The course incorporates work from the big names – Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, D.H. Lawrence, E.M. Forster – and from a less influential but perhaps equally interesting writer: Vita Sackville-West. Some discussion of the visual and plastic arts is also incorporated into the course. Reading beyond the text list in the relevant material and related texts from the period is, of course, encouraged. Where possible, you’ll access relevant supporting material, including films, through the wonderful UBC Library.\n\nThis is an online course, and the full description is here.\n\nTwentieth-Century Studies\n\nTerm 1\n\nMWF, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.\n\nWhen Eloise Knapp Hay discusses T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land as a poem of “radical doubt and negation,” she argues that its city made no “convincing allusions… to St. Augustine's vision of interpenetration between the City of God and the City of Man in this world.” That vision of divine interpenetration was the unconscious of political fiction for many centuries, the eternalized Platonic Form of utopia. But toward what does political fiction point after the City of God becomes unavailable? Modernism and its scions carried out a lengthy thought-experiment through much of the twentieth century, devising new political fictions without the support of a divine guarantee of goodness. We will read a set of books whose politics are overt and whose aesthetic prowess is distinctive, but not straightforward. Possible readings: The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists, Heart of Darkness, Brave New World, It Can’t Happen Here, Animal Farm, The Man in the High Castle, The Dispossessed. Online discussion forum and other participation, midterm essay, final paper, final exam.

Children rarely write children’s books, nor have they produced a body of research on children’s literature. Instead, adult authors write for imagined child readers, and adult academics pursue research based on the foundations of consciously (or unconsciously) constructed models of childhood. Our class will grapple with this defining problem of children’s literature—the difficulty of constructing the child reader—by applying a variety of critical approaches to European fairy tales and their descendants. We’ll begin by reading fairy tales that were published in England, Germany, France, and Russia in the 17th to 19th century. We’ll then turn to modern versions of these tales and finish by examining recent novels and graphic novels that adapt conventions of traditional fairy tales to explore the complexities of modern life. In a nod to the folklorist Max Lüthi, who saw sevens nearly everywhere he looked, I’ve chosen the following approaches for our class: interactions between text and image, socio-historical criticism, formalism, psychoanalytic theory, f"
