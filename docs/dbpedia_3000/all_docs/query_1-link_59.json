        "text": "Architecture of Charleston: 7 Signature Styles and 12 Historic Buildings\n\nTop Hotel Collections\n\nDowntown Hotels\n\nDowntown Hotels\n\nNear Trident Medical Center\n\nPet-friendly Hotels\n\nView All Hotels In Charleston\n\nThe city of Charleston in Carolina has a riveting visual appeal, being crowned as America’s first historic district by the Board of Architectural Review. People travel here across continents for savory food and shopping smorgasbords, in search of Southern vintage culture. Founded in 1670 as “Charles Town”, Charleston has witnessed centuries of evolution in architecture, now making it the fifth largest city in the USA.\n\n7 Types of Architecture in Charleston\n\nElegant, authentic and picturesque houses have been a part of Charleston’s history. Copper lanterns, earthquake posts, magnificent doors and intricate hitching posts flank the streets, creating 7 distinct architectural styles. Here are the various types of architecture in Charleston: -\n\n1. Georgian\n\nRoughly finished limestone trim, granite pedestals, decorative molding and massive stone arches are a part of Georgian architecture in Charleston. This elite style features symmetrical themes and cornice entries.\n\n2. Greek Revival\n\nCharleston is a quintessential model of Greek revival, with stunning buildings full of Ionic columns, modilian style cornices, domes and arched windows.\n\n3. Federal\n\nA subset of Italian Renaissance style, Federal architecture refers to Charleston’s buildings with a central floor plan, elliptical fanlights, palladian windows and oval shaped rooms. Delicate details make this style one of the most fascinating.\n\n4. Charleston Single House\n\nCharleston single house is not a particular style and may be built out of any material. Piazzas, duplex porches and spacious rooms are characteristic. This style dates back to the 1730s but can be found in every single Charleston street.\n\n5. Art Deco\n\nCombining modern styles with refined materials, Art Deco buildings are influenced by geometric domes and cubism. Smooth-facing stone, terracotta, glass, steel and aluminium are some of the sleek contemporary materials used.\n\n6. Italianate\n\nAdopted from traditional Italian villas, Italianate architecture in Charleston flourished between 1870 and 1900. Stucco, masonry and stone are often used to build spectacular cupolas, slim arched windows, overhanging eaves and cornice are found in this Romantic style.\n\n7. Gothic Revival\n\nPerhaps one of the most prevalent types of architecture in Charleston, Gothic Revival showcases castle-like towers, pointed arched windows, vertical facades, pitched roofs and parapets.\n\nOther prominent styles: Victorian, Queen Anne, Antebellum, Adamesque, Romanic.\n\nFacts and Myths About Charleston Architecture\n\nCharleston architecture is exclusively found in and around Peninsular Charleston, unlike other Southern styles. This has earned the city the nickname “Holy City”, known for its massive collection of pre-civil, candy-colored war houses and cobblestone streets. But no matter the architectural style, all homes in Charleston feature a consistent interior layout where front doors open to a foyer leading to staircases, bedrooms to the left, a living lobby on the right and a kitchen. Rooms are separated by arched doorways.\n\nIt is often said that the architecture of Charleston’s homes had extremely narrow facades on the street-facing fronts to avoid higher taxation. Another myth says early residents cultivated sugar plantations. However, both have been disproved.\n\n12 Iconic Buildings Representing Architecture of Charleston\n\nCharleston is a treasure chest of over 2,800 well-preserved historic buildings.
