        "text": "Ever wonder what makes Charleston’s historic streets so beautiful? While the answer to this question encompasses multiple factors, the tapestry of architectural styles grace the city together to form Charleston’s distinctive character. This guide presents the architectural styles found throughout the city and provides tips on how to identify them.\n\nColonial Revival\n\nThe Colonial Revival style draws inspiration from the simplicity and charming nature of early American architecture. The style reflects classic colonial design in a more contemporary manner for the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Colonial Revival structures feature symmetrical layouts, gabled roofs, dormers, and light neutral tones. Aspects of classical elements such as columns and ornate moldings further enhance their aesthetic appeal.\n\nA perfect illustration of this design aesthetic can be found at 83 East Bay Street. This residence beautifully embodies the timeless charm of Colonial Revival architecture. The pastel color, central dormer, and perfect symmetry all work to represent the classic roots of this architectural style.\n\nGreek Revival\n\nGreek Revival architecture arrived in Charleston in the mid-19th century, adding elegance to the city’s streets. The style reflects ancient Greek architecture with intricate Ionic and Doric columns, expansive porches, triangular pediments, low gable roofs, and balanced designs. Historic homes in this style, such as 89 Smith Street, feature a variety of details that reflect Greek Revival architecture. This is evident in the fluted Doric columns, dental molding, perfectly symmetrical design, and the simplistic details, which lend the home a stately appearance.\n\nGeorgian\n\nGeorgian-style architecture, influenced by Greek and Roman design, has been popular in Charleston since the 18th century. The style exhibits symmetrical facades, a brick exterior, window sashes, and beautiful ornamentation. 117 Broad and 17 Orange Street, also known as the Governor’s House, is a prime example of Georgian architecture with Charleston’s classic touch. The home features a perfectly symmetrical facade, uniform windows, and doors, simple column and capital details. Each of these elements enhance the homes classical ambiance. One of the only sections with detailed ornamentation appears in the frieze and cornice sections of the facade, which is typical of Georgian-style homes. Drayton Hall is another example which features a classic example of Georgian architecture. The renowned Drayton Hall showcases the Georgian style seen in the red brick materials, the decorative columns, and the symmetry of the structure.\n\nFederal\n\nCharleston features an abundance of Federal-style architecture, found in both grand government buildings and elegant residences. While similar to Georgian design, Federal architecture stands out with its refined simplicity and delicate ornamentation. This timeless style gained prominence in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Typically constructed with brick and stone, Federal homes command attention in any neighborhood. It is easy to identify a Federal style home from the ornate entryways, porches, and two-room-deep floor plans. The historic home known as 38 Tradd Street showcases various elements of the Federal style, as seen in its simple details, brick facade, cottage-style dormers, and symmetrical layout.\n\nVictorian\n\nVictorian-style homes are commonly seen throughout all neighborhoods in Historic Downtown Charleston. Homes of this style are filled with various complex architectural details. Commonly seen in the ornate trim and architectural elements that are reflective of the Gothic style. The facade consists of wood and sometimes stone. Homes of the Victorian style are typically more extensive, with multiple floors and towers, as well as unique floor plans due to their elaborate designs. Vibrant usage of color is a staple for Victorian-style homes making them stand out in neighborhoods as a showstopper structure.\n\nItalianate\n\nItalianate architecture, drawing inspiration from the Italian Renaissance, made a significant impact on Charleston from the mid-19th century onward. It’s characterized by expansive porch overhangs that create generous outdoor spaces, complemented by ornate balconies embellished with intricate moldings and wrought iron railings. The style features a plethora of windows and doors, often with rounded tops. A stunning creation of Italianate architecture in Charleston is found at 81 Rutledge Avenue, distinguished by its generous side porches, tall windows and doors, and balconies decorated with wrought iron railings."
