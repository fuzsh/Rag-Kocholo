        "text": "Below are some of the books I read this year, with my honest opinions, and it may give you some ideas of what you might like to read in the coming year. By the way, if like me you’re a legalist who has to finish every book they begin, then I may have discovered a cure! I created an ‘Abandoned’ list for awful books. This enabled me to relegate an unfinished book without feeling I’d wasted time. So I recommend you develop your own ‘A list’ for 2024. I’ve not given you my complete 2023 reading list because, even with my A List, I still finished some books that were just not that good. I properly abandoned only three – but I’m working on it!\n\nChristian Teaching\n\nHoly Bible NLT – Chronological Bible (Audible)\n\nThis is my second time through the NLT and, although I rarely preach from it nor use it for study, I must say that it remains one of the most enjoyable translations to simply read through. As with all English translations there are verses here and there that you feel don’t carry the weight of other translations (and therefore presumably the original), but I am happy to recommend it.\n\nJohn Bunyan – All Loves Excelling\n\nA devotional symphony based on Eph 3.18-19, with these chapter titles: 1. Describing the Inexpressible. 2. Desiring the Incomparable. 3. Obtaining the Unsurpassable. Just go and buy a copy!\n\nJohn Wimber and Kevin Springer – Riding the Third Wave\n\nDennis Bennett – Nine O’Clock in the Morning\n\nIt was in 1984 that I first experienced an infilling of the Holy Spirit that floored me and utterly changed my life. This experience of being ‘clothed with power’ was not, of course, competing with conversion, but it enhanced and enlivened every aspect of my Christian life from that point. The ecclesiastical context of that and subsequent experiences of the Spirit was the Newfrontiers family of churches – a movement committed to planting and building churches as far as possible along strictly New Testament lines rather than traditional historic denominational lines. It was to my loss, then, that I hadn’t read anything by Dennis Bennett, nor the experiences of individuals in Wimber’s book Riding the Third Wave, most of whom were pastors in traditional denominations. I strongly recommend Bennett’s Nine O’Clock in the Morning. It’ll give you a lift, and draw you towards the great Baptiser in the Spirit.\n\nRandy Clark and Bill Johnson – The Essential Guide to Healing\n\nForgive me, if you like these guys, but I must say I was expecting something barmy bonkers wacko or harmy. In fact, this was generally good, with plenty of caveats on not over-promising etc. And more often than not I was saying to myself, ‘I need to pray for more people who are struggling or suffering,’ which is not a bad thing. Probably worth noting that Clark and Johnson don’t hold to the classic ‘faith’ type teaching exemplified here.\n\nAndrew Wilson – Spirit and Sacrament\n\nAndrew Wilson – God of All Things\n\nSee here for my short review of Spirit and Sacrament. God of All Things was a pure joy. The short chapters are actually like short columns in a paper or magazine, and most contain some fresh fact or insight that makes the heart sing. Taken as a whole this would be a perfect gift for a pastor, or friend who needs a refreshing reminder of God’s goodness reflected in numerous simple materials, things, objects. Excellent.\n\nOpenness Unhindered – Rosaria Champagne Butterfield\n\nI find Rosaria Butterfield’s testimony and exhortation to hospitality absolutely refreshing. She can occasionally phrase something a little strongly and with both books I’ve read I haven’t always agreed with everything. But isn’t that the case with many books? But her work is definitely worth your time. I didn’t agree with everything here, specifically her taking up Romans 7.14f to be a description of the normal Christian life, and her description of the Adamic pre-converted you not as dead (unlike Rom 6.6) but like a tree stump that keeps sprouting after it’s been cut.\n\nLeadership/Character\n\nChuck DeGroat – When Narcissism Comes to Church\n\nKyle Johnston, who is Chairman of BiblicalCounselling Africa, first mentioned the name Chuck DeGroat to me and stressed how vital his work is to the health of Christian organisations and churches. But it’s only very recently that I got round to reading this important book. DeGroat implores counsellors and leaders to listen up and be aware. Because narcissism is so devastating to those caught in its damaging force field, and is usually at the heart of most, if not all, of the ‘falls’ of celebrity pastors around the world, it’s not surprising that this book is being recommended to church teams. Too much is at stake to not assess the character, broken histories, or historic relational problems of those who volunteer to govern the church of Jesus. Like others, DeGroat strongly warns against us being wowed by platform performances, theological education, or the sheer drive of personality, and offers hope to those who have suffered, and for narcissists who acknowledge their ‘shadow side’.\n\nOther recommended books on leadership and character development\n\nC Peter Wagner – Humility\n\nNot a bad accompaniment to DeGroat as we seek to assess our own weaknesses and become more Christlike. A superb self-evaluation type book that could be of great help.\n\nRick Warren – God’s Power to Change Your Life\n\nHope for those who need to change but feel stuck.\n\nSophie Hannah – How to hold a grudge\n\nA surprisingly helpful approach to protecting yourself by noting that sometimes the other person will never change, and she suggests a means of categorising the hurt or the person in such a way that enables you to move on. So ‘holding’ a grudge, as it were, is a play on words.\n\nLiza Huie and Kyle Johnston – How to get the most out of your Counseling\n\nSimon Lancaster – Winning Minds\n\nBoth helpful. Lancaster looks at the relationship between language and leadership.\n\nLiterary fiction\n\nCharles Dickens – Oliver Twist (Audible)\n\nSurprisingly not so good.\n\nAlain de Botton – Essays on Love\n\nA cracking beginning but tapers off.\n\nFrancis Spufford – Light Perpetual\n\nLove Spufford and enjoyed this.\n\nHG Wells – The Invisible Man\n\nApart from the brilliant idea of an invisible man, the story doesn’t really go anywhere and he’s just a nasty character. How different from Wells’s excellent The Time Machine which so creatively tantalises the imagination.\n\nBiography\n\nDaniel Nayeri – Everything Sad is Untrue\n\nOne of the very best books I read this year. Utterly fascinating, moving. Couldn’t put it down and I don’t want to tell you any of the story. I read it without knowing anything about Daniel and was thrilled and thrilled again as the story unfolded. It sounds too boring to describe it as the story of a refugee finding his way to the USA. It’s very much more than that. Go and get yourself a copy.\n\nLuis Bunuel – My Last Breath\n\nActually quite funny and sad. The avant-garde film director Lius Bunuel, writing in his later years, also describes the loneliness of an older person who doesn’t have family close by. ‘Sometimes an entire week goes by without a visitor, and I feel abandoned.’ and ‘I don’t want to die in a hotel room with my bags open and papers lying al over the place. On the other hand, an even more horrible death is one that’s kept at bay by the miracles of modern medicine, a death that never ends. In the name of Hippocrates, doctors have invented the most exquisite form of torture ever known to man: survival.’ Also, ‘my own sexual desire has waned and finally disappeared, even in dreams. And I’m delighted; it’s as if I’ve finally been relieved of a tyrannical burden.’\n\nOlaudah Equiano – The Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavas Vassa\n\nDevastating. And devastating again. Equiano was an enslaved African (18th century) who accomplished his own freedom and then became an active abolitionist.\n\nStewart Copeland – Strange things happen\n\nCopeland was the drummer for The Police, and his father was a US intelligence agent who was a friend of Kim Philby in Beirut. I enjoyed his podcast about his father, but found this boring.\n\nRosaria Butterfield – The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert\n\nButterfield’s conversion story. Well worth reading.\n\nWilliam Hague – William Wilberforce\n\nDetailed. Careful. Surely the standard biography of Wilberforce.\n\nThomas C Oden – A Change of Heart\n\nGood if you’re already a ‘fan’ of Oden, which I am. This autobiography tracks Oden’s theological development from liberal Marxist to consensual classical and evangelical theology. Good stuff, but for an intro to Oden read, How Africa Shaped the Christian Mind.\n\nHistory\n\nJames Sutherland (Ed) – The Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes\n\nAbsolutely brilliant. An excellent bedside book. I’ve just bought the updated new edition.\n\nDean Merrill – 50 Pentecostal and Charismatic Leaders you should know\n\nFerguson/Beeke – Church History 101\n\nBoth OK, but not anything to get excited about. Especially as church history is something we should get very excited about.\n\n©2023 Lex Loizides\n\nIn the early 1960s a conservative Episcopalian journalist, John Sherrill, was commissioned to write an investigative book on Pentecostalism. He began consulting with academics and church historians to see if this was a worthwhile pursuit. He was surprised to discover that they spoke of Pentecostalism not in terms of small churches, or a single denomination, but of an apparently unstoppable global movement growing by millions every year. The academics claimed that, in terms of its breadth of influence, and size, that this was the most significant religious shift since the Reformation.\n\nSo Sherrill got to work, and part of his investigation was examining its distinctive features. He soon found that the experience of the baptism, or infilling, of the Spirit followed by the gift of tongues was a key distinctive.\n\nThe definition of ‘tongues’: Tongues is a prayer language not learned but which is spoken out by the believer usually after being filled with the Holy Spirit, and which then becomes a regular part of their spiritual life.\n\nTesting the claims\n\nHe interviewed people of all denominations who had experienced being filled with the Spirit and who spoke in tongues. They claimed to have received these various languages as a gift. They weren’t making up the sounds. Could he test whether that claim was true?\n\n‘I’d decided to get some tape recordings of people speaking in tongues, with the idea of playing them back for some language experts and seeing what they made of it all.’\n\nHe invited people to come and make the recordings at his publisher’s offices in New York. He tried unsuccessfully to sound-proof the room, with hilarious results as his fellow-workers eagerly listened to whatever it was that was happening inside.\n\nSpeaking in tongues – What does the Bible say?\n\nAt the same time he needed to find out whether this was a legitimate part of Christian worship. Here’s some of his results:\n\nHe discovered the New Testament contains some 30 references to tongues, and that they were used in different ways:\n\nto exalt the greatness of God, not only as a one-time event but as a regular spiritual exercise\n\nto build up the believer in prayer;\n\n– that they helped the believer pray when he wasn’t sure what to pray for, or in worship;\n\n– that they were spoken out in public meetings, followed by an interpretation by someone else, and that this combination invigorated the church gatherings.\n\nIn terms of Paul’s response to tongues he found:\n\n‘there was no sense of surprise about tongues…He accepts them without discussion as a genuine part of the Christian experience.’\n\nthat Paul considered the Holy Spirit to be the source of tongues, and that their use is appointed by God\n\nthat they are given for ‘useful purpose..the strengthening of the one who uses them.’\n\nthat he is not teaching about them theoretically, ‘but from personal experience. He himself uses tongues extensively.’ ‘I thank God I speak in tongues more than you all…’ 14.18\n\nthat he not only prays in tongues but sings in tongues too 1 Cor 14.15\n\nthat he does not expect the tongue to be understood by the hearers\n\nthat not everyone in the church speaks in tongues\n\nthat he encourages them, ‘Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues.’ 14.5\n\nand that one of the cautions them, ‘do not forbid speaking in tongues’. 14.39\n\nBut, he asked, why is there a gift of tongues? He asked one of those tongues speakers: ‘What’s the use of speaking in tongues?’ She replied, ‘The only way I can answer that is to say… ‘What is the use of a sunset? Just sheer, unmitigated uplift, just joy unspeakable and with it health and peace and rest and release from burdens and tensions.’\n\nIn the end, rather than focus on Pentecostalism as such, Sherrill called his book, ‘They Speak with Other Tongues’. He recounts instances where someone praying in tongues in church is discovered to be praying in a known language with highly specific knowledge of a visitor. These are amazing accounts, but relatively rare. Tongues usually are unknown languages.\n\nLanguage experts examine the taped recordings of people speaking in tongues\n\nAfter making recordings he gathered six language experts to examine a selection of the tapes: Two specialists in modern languages, three in ancient languages, and an expert in language structure. They convened at Columbia University:\n\n‘I was interested in their reactions to our experiment. They were extremely attentive, dubious without being hostile. As I put on the first tape each one leaned forward, straining to catch every syllable. Several took notes…For the better part of an hour we listened to one prayer after another, spoken ‘in the Spirit’.’\n\n‘There were some interesting observations… One of the linguists reported that although he did not identify words he felt that one tape had been structured in much the same way as a modern poem is structured. ‘Modern poetry depends upon sound as much as upon verbal meaning to get across its message,’ he said. ‘In this one prayer, I felt that although I didn’t understand the literal sense of her words, I did catch the emotional content of what she was saying. It was a hymn of love. Beautiful.’…\n\n‘Although no language known to these men was recorded, they frequently identified language patterns on the tapes. The shape of real language, the variety of sound combinations, infrequency of repetition and so forth, is virtually impossible, they said, to reproduce by deliberate effort…\n\nFake tongues exposed!\n\n‘I had slipped onto the tapes two instances of pure made-up gibberish, one by our son, Scott, and one by Tib [his wife]. They had tried to sound as much as possible like the tongues on the rest of the tapes, but the linguists spotted the deception immediately.\n\n“That’s not language,’ one man said. ‘That’s just noise.”‘\n\nThe academics were impressed. And Sherrill was impressed that these unknown tongues had definite structural similarities to known languages. He continues,\n\n‘I had always read the opening words of St Paul’s great thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians, ‘Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,’ in a poetic sense…But there is no doubt in my mind now that Paul was speaking of tongues in the specific Pentecostal sense, and of angel tongues as one variety of these.’\n\nRead the book for the rest of John Sherrill’s story! It’s an intriguing read!\n\nOther books by John Sherrill include:\n\nThe Cross and the Switchblade (about David Wilkerson) – John and Elizabeth Sherrill\n\nGod’s Smuggler (about Brother Andrew) – John and Elizabeth Sherrill\n\nThe Hiding Place (about Corrie Ten Boom) – John and Elizabeth Sherrill\n\nThe Happiest People on Earth (about the ‘Full Gospel’s business fellowship) – John and Elizabeth Sherrill\n\nMy Friend the Bible – – John Sherrill\n\n©2022 Lex Loizides / Church History Review\n\nWhat I read in 2021\n\nAll the way back in 2020 I thought it would be fun to make a record of what I was reading. I’d never done it before and was surprised by how much I read (although 2020 was lockdown year). When I came to putting the list here I merely added ‘Excellent’ by way of recommendation. Although I read less in 2021 (it was an even more crazy year), I thought this time I’d add a comment about some of the books. This could spark some interest in an author or topic that may be new to you. My hope is that perhaps one or two of these books will open up a new area of delight and discovery for you. I’ve tried to organise the books in each category chronologically, rather than in terms of recommendation.\n\nOld Books (or books about old books)\n\nNew King James Version (Re-read) – I generally move from translation to translation reading the whole Bible through. This is the second time I’ve read the NKJV and enjoyed it very much. What could be better than to be grounded in the Book of Books?\n\nPlato – Gorgias (c.380 BC) in which Socrates debates with a couple of friends, and reaches as close to the gospel (from a moral point of view) as you could possibly get without actually knowing it.\n\nTwo quotes: ‘I make it my aim to present my soul to its judge in the soundest possible state.’\n\n‘All the other theories put forward in our long conversation have been refuted and this conclusion alone stands firm, that one should avoid doing wrong with more care than being wronged, and that the supreme object of a man’s efforts, in public and in private life, must be the reality, rather than the appearance, of goodness.’\n\nOvid – Amores (16 BC) translated by Guy Lee. This should probably be in the Poetry section. And it was thoroughly enjoyable, and quite often funny. Over the years I’ve found myself wading dutifully through whole volumes of modern poetry only finding refreshment in one or two poems: Ovid was much more fun.\n\nProcopius – The Anecdota, or Secret History (AD 550) Was this a behind-the-scenes exposé? a craftily written guarantee of allegiance to the next emperor? or a pack of lies written by a bitter servant? We don’t know, but fascinating 6th C memoir nonetheless.\n\nAbelard and Heloise – Forbidden Fruit (Letters) (c.AD 1120) A tragic story of love, scandal, castration, and monasteries. Yes. You read that correctly.\n\nHistory\n\nSimon Sebag Montefiore – Titans of History comprising of brief biographical sketches of hundreds of key historical figures. Therefore, some of it engaging. But great if you just wanted to fill in the gaps.\n\nTom Holland – Dominion Not a church history, but a fascinating look at the parallel history of (mainly) the West and how the story of the church changed and then influenced so much of what we now assume is normal, decent, humane morality. Well worth reading although, if you’re a believer and haven’t read a decent overview of church history I’d begin elsewhere, and then come back to Dominion. A few years ago Sociologist Alvin Schmidt offered a direct ‘Christian’ exposition of the same type of material in his How Has Christianity Changed the World (Zondervan). Also worth reading.\n\nBruce Shelley – Church History On Audible, this is just under 22 hours of our story including those non-Protestant bits that are not always as interesting to read. I was slightly disappointed at the US focus towards the end, redeemed somewhat by the addition of material from Philip Jenkins and the mighty growth of Christianity through the Pentecostal/Charismatic movement in the global South in the second half of the 20th C.\n\nCecil M Robeck – The Azusa St Mission and Revival Fascinating and very helpful. I was unaware that ‘singing in the Spirit’ in church meetings was a feature of the Azusa St meetings.\n\nBiography/Autobiography/Memoir\n\nThe World of Samuel Pepys Being fascinating selections from his Diary. He was an unrepentant scallywag of epic proportions, and someone we would not allow into church membership without a thorough renunciation of the behaviour he describes. He was a lecherous, entitled opportunist in a puritan world. Having said that, his very detailed descriptions of life in London, the great fire, and many other aspects of 17th C life make addictive reading.\n\nJohn Suchet – Beethoven Not brilliantly written, but not a bad introduction to the life of arguably the greatest music maker in history. The anger, the fire, the passion, the pathos. It all springs out of Beethoven’s inner turmoil.\n\nLaura Tunbridge – Beethoven, a Life in Nine Pieces A better edited book, but start with the Suchet if you can get hold of it.\n\nRobert Greenberg – The Life and Times of Beethoven I listened to this Great Courses series on Audible and was gripped. Greenberg is a fabulous communicator. Again, the anguish of Beethoven’s life gives additional depth (is that even possible?) to his incredible music. Beethoven represents the pinnacle of musical achievement (with the Beatles coming in a distant second – I’ve just noticed wordpress won’t let me put a laughing emoji here).\n\nTheodore Vrettos – The Elgin Affair More of a biography of Elgin than a discussion on the Marbles. And there’s more than one affair, as the cover implies. Elgin’s life is tragic too. Like many of the statues of antiquity, he lost his nose (was it syphilis or something else?) and lived in physical and emotional pain for a significant part of his life. Regarding the Greek marbles, of course, the fact that it was the occupying Turks who gave Elgin permission to remove them from the Parthenon in Athens reinforces the ethical weight of Greece’s claim for their return. I can fully believe that Elgin did in fact save many of the works from being chopped up and sold off to wealthy tourists (many of the artefacts on the Acropolis already had been lost in that way), but – especially now with the state-of-the-art Acropolis Museum completed – what serious argument remains to keep the Parthenon marbles separate from the rest of the structure from which they have been separated?\n\nHG Wells – HG Wells in Love You may have suspected he was a scallywag. You were right.\n\nAnthony Burgess – Flame into Being For those interested in DH Lawrence.\n\nDylan Thomas – Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog\n\nDylan Thomas – Adventures in the Skin Trade Thomas’s prose is outstanding, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed reading beyond his poetry. His sense of humour is irrepressible. These two books are autobiographical. Come and enjoy the English language, said a Welshman who outdid most of his English friends.\n\nEva Schloss – Eva’s Story Like all Holocaust survivor stories this is both haunting and inspiring. What makes the copy I have so special to me is that it is signed by the author. I was unaware of that when I bought it from a local charity shop. And that simple fact hit me very powerfully as I read it: that I have a first-hand testimony of one of the world’s worst atrocities actually signed by a survivor. That’s how close it all is to our own time.\n\nEva Mozes Kor – The Twins of Auschwitz A similarly powerful autobiography.\n\nSpike Milligan – Where Have all the Bullets Gone? I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading the earlier volumes of his autobiography, but Milligan is going deeper with each volume. I am currently reading the final one, but can’t get hold of the Mussolini. If you’re in Seffrica and you have it, drop me a line. The world needs Milligan.\n\nAbigail Santamaria – Joy A lengthy biography of Joy Davidman, the love of CS Lewis’s life (Well, apart from Mrs Moore, if you believe that line of thought). Davidman was further to the Left than Lewis, having been a committed Communist in her earlier years. And part of her need to stay in England was to avoid the McCarthy trials in the US where she may well have fallen foul of the rampant anti-Communist fervour at the time. Lewis, himself very definitely on the Left, and having rejected a CBE because it was offered to him by a Conservative government, had political as well as aesthetic sympathies with her. I’ll post an article about this some time, but Lewis’s refusal of the CBE (Commander of the British Empire) was because he did not want to give the impression that Christianity was in favour of right wing politics. And he was nervous of misrepresenting the gospel.\n\nJeremy Lewis – The Life and Times of Allen Lane I loved this. My copy is a big beautiful hardback and I loved every page. It’s the story of Penguin Books and the drive to put good literature into the hands of ‘the man in the street’. What Pygmalion toys with, and Howard’s End promotes, Allen Lane actually helped accomplish. What a character! And what a debt we owe this man.\n\nAnthony Burgess – Little Wilson and Big God Roger Stott, a friend of mine from pre-Christian days used to speak highly of Burgess and, having read A Clockwork Orange in 2020, I thought I’d get to know this writer a bit better. Little Wilson is the first volume of his two-volume autobiography.\n\nLarry King – My Remarkable Journey I enjoy interviewing folk during our Sunday services and thought I’d pick up some tips from the most famous of all, but this is more of a life story.\n\nCarol Wimber – John Wimber: The way it was For some reason I’d missed that Wimber had been a Quaker. At first he was very much a non-quaking Quaker, but, following his mighty baptism in the Spirit and the resultant controversy in his local Quaker church, he quickly became a quaking non-Quaker. Such is denominationalism. It’s not brilliantly written but gives some great insights into John and Carol’s early journey towards the Vineyard, and does reflect the breadth of Wimber’s generosity of spirit.\n\nKhaya Dlanga – To Quote Myself Superb South African story of resilience and success. Full of good humour and hope.\n\nDom Joly – Here Comes the Clown Refreshing. Funny. Self-effacing. Better than any of the clips of Trigger Happy TV that I subsequently watched on youtube.\n\nEben Alexander – Proof of Heaven Well, yes, but…It started out OK and gradually pulled further and further away from anything biblical, like a resolutely squiffy supermarket trolley.\n\nTrevor Noah – Born a Crime As with Khaya Dlanga, Trevor Noah’s story is a micro-history of South Africa as well as being a tough, passionate, joyous ride towards professional success.\n\nMortimer & Whitehouse – Gone Fishing Hilarious. I haven’t seen the print version of this but the Audible is heartwarming and full of what seem to be spontaneous moments of hilarity and silliness. Bob Mortimer is a humble wonder.\n\nMartin Amis – Inside Story Amis calls this a novel – perhaps the safest way to blend a brilliant novelist’s gift with memoir. Cover-to-cover enjoyable if you are interested in the literary world of the 20th C. As with his other autobiographical work, Experience, the presence of Kingsley pervades all.\n\nBob Mortimer – And Away Genuinely funny, sad, touching, inspiring – all in one. Back to back interesting stories. Had me laughing out loud on several occasions. The humility is refreshing.\n\nLiterature/Studies/Words etc.\n\nCS Lewis – An Experiment in Criticism Excellent, as you would expect.\n\nHarold Bloom – Hamlet: Poem Unlimited\n\nClive James – Latest Readings\n\nStephen King – On Writing I haven’t read anything by Stephen King except this. It was superb, and got me writing.\n\nChristian Teaching\n\nJohn Piper – Filling up the Afflictions of Christ (Tyndale/Paton/Judson)\n\nJohn Piper – The Legacy of Sovereign Joy (Augustine/Luther/Calvin)\n\nRebecca McLaughlin – Confronting Christianity I somehow missed that I’d read this in 2021, but it was tremendous and I tweeted about it several times. I need to do a proper book review, but let me say I think it’s the best ‘apologetics’ style book I’ve read in years (and I’ve read quite a few). Absolutely stunning.\n\nRebecca McLaughlin – Is Christmas Unbelievable? She’s done it again! A brilliant, snappy, winsome explanation of the gospel and why we should give serious thought to its claims.\n\nJohn Sherrill – They Speak with Other Tongues (re-read) An absolute pleasure to revisit this brilliant little book. If you have questions about the New Testament gift of tongues – such a normal feature of New Testament Christianity and yet still so controversial in today’s conversation – get hold of this book. It’s the story of a sceptical journalist investigating this apparently ‘new’ feature of modern Christianity.\n\nBilly Graham – Nearing Home Reflections on old age, retirement, weakness, and the inevitable approach of death. An encouraging volume to give to those in our congregations who are older.\n\nDane Ortlund – Gentle and Lowly Beautifully written, devotionally rich. The closest modern book to the great English Puritan writers. Definitely worth buying.\n\nDavid Cross – Soul Ties Although I disagree with the essential premise, the prayers of renunciation at the end of the book are very good, and may prove very helpful to someone who feels stuck in the past.\n\nBrandon J O’Brien/E Randolph Richards – Misreading Scripture with Western Eyes Written by modern American missionaries, but these guys are not like the caricature of American missionaries you’ve read about. A sensitive and helpful discussion, with many examples, making us aware of our blindspots and assumptions as we approach the text of Scripture itself.\n\nJohn Lennox – Have No Fear A short and welcome exhortation to evangelism.\n\nDavid Devenish – Succession or Multiplication? The story and thinking behind the expansion of Newfrontiers into different apostolic ‘spheres’ based on existing apostles working into the churches they’ve planted and overseen.\n\nFrancis Spufford – Unapologetic Hmmm. Beautifully written. Perhaps a little flamboyant in places, but why not? This would do if you wanted to know what a church-going Anglican believes, although I suspect most Anglicans don’t enjoy as much effing and blinding as Spufford does. Several points of difference but, as you’ve probably picked up, I think it’s good to read beyond one’s own preferences. If you’re a beginner don’t start here. Start with Keller’s Reason for God, or CS Lewis, or try John Piper.\n\nTimothy Keller – The Prodigal God Starts slowly but every pastor should read, with trembling, the chapter on the Elder Brother. Chapter 4. Go and get your copy and read it!\n\nJonathan Leeman – Church Discipline Again, we’re not on the same page on some things but worth reading nevertheless.\n\nNovels\n\nVoltaire – Candide I expected fisticuffs, or something of a tussle at least, but I was genuinely delighted with how funny this short book is. In fact, I started noting down each time I either laughed or chuckled to myself. 32. It reminded me of Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels because of the biting satire, as well as how modern the whole thing feels (it was published in 1759). Humour does carry us over the centuries.\n\nJames Weldon Johnson – The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man Gut wrenching and powerful. I assumed it was autobiography until I looked online, but the author is clearly drawing on his own and others’ experiences.\n\nOscar Wilde – The Picture of Dorian Grey I assumed I’d read this before, as it’s such an iconic story. It’s good but, eish, the language is too flowery, and there’s was a whole unnecessary chapter. But, as with Jekyll and Hyde, A Christmas Carol, and others, it’s a powerful moral fable.\n\nFranz Kafka – Metamorphosis Reminiscent of the Theatre of the Absurd, or a Monty Python, or Reeves and Mortimer, sketch. There is little doubt in my mind that Kafka intended this as a satirical poke at the expectations of family and society. You know the kind of thing: man wakes up to find he is now a loathsome bug, and is primarily concerned not with his bugginess but with what excuse he will make for being late for work, and how embarrassed his parents will be etc… Also, I thought I should read at least one Kafka before I die, and this was the one my daughter was studying at university. Her lecturers don’t seem to agree with my ‘hilarious absurd satire’ interpretation by the way, but load it with serious meaning about the modern condition.\n\nGeorge Orwell- A Clergyman’s Daughter Surprisingly bad (I mean properly bad and breaking half of Orwell’s Why I Write rules). It’s also weighed down with Orwell’s characteristic pessimism. Probably not worth reading unless, like me, you’ve decided to read everything by him.\n\nGeorge Orwell – 1984 (Re-read) A haunting triumph. As with Animal Farm, this is one of the all-time must-reads.\n\nMartin Amis – Time’s Arrow The idea of telling a story in reverse order is not new. But oh how brilliantly written, with the strangest haunting image of the air growing blacker, forming into clouds, funnelling down from the heavens into high chimneys and producing a persecuted, and then ultimately triumphant and gifted Jewish people.\n\nFrancis Spufford – Golden Hill Well written. A bit naughty.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw – Pygmalion (re-read) What’s not to love?\n\nPoetry\n\nThe Love Songs of Sappho (b.630 BC) translated by Paul Roche – Sappho was apparently considered the world’s greatest poet for about a thousand years. Only fragments remain, and these just don’t give us enough. The mystery around her is largely due to the fact that so little of her work has been preserved. So I found this particular version frustrating.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare – A Midsummer Night’s Dream\n\nWilliam Shakespeare – All’s Well that Ends Well I read at least one Shakespeare play each year and have always found it invigorating. This is a play with a very modern feel, with some powerful themes touching on ‘Me too’, and on the stupidity of classism.\n\nGeorge Herbert – Selected Poems As with the Ovid, I enjoyed most of these poems. I have to be honest and acknowledge that so much modern poetry is practically indecipherable, or boring. Herbert had the sherbet. Try him.\n\nJohn Donne – Love Poems\n\nLibertine Lyrics (Pauper Press, 1940) I emphasise the date there as the title (as with many of the more recent anthologies of love poetry) sounds more racy than it is.\n\nGeorge Orwell – The Complete Poetry Awful. Avoid.\n\nPenguin Modern Poets 6 (Clemo/Lucie-Smith/Macbeth)\n\nPenguin Modern Poets 7 (Murphy/Silkin/Tarn)\n\nPenguin Modern Poets 8 (Brock/Hill/Smith)\n\nCarol Ann Duffy (ed.) – Hand in Hand\n\nWendy Cope (ed.) – The Funny Side (101 poems)\n\nKate Tempest – Hold Your Own I genuinely enjoyed this. Pace, insight, cheek. I liked it.\n\nSeamus Heaney – Beowulf Probably 8th Century, so this is an ‘older’ work. Over the years, I’ve enjoyed some of Heaney’s poetry. But no. I just couldn’t get into it.\n\nCulture etc.\n\nGeorge Orwell – Essays (Penguin:Great Orwell), incorporating:\n\nInside the Whale/Decline of the English Murder/The Lion and the Unicorn Like CS Lewis, some of Orwell’s best writing is in his essays. It’s so rare to read a single volume of essays and enjoy every one, but Orwell always rewards your attention. As with the end of Down and Out where he sharply, and I think unfairly, criticises the Salvation Army for its work among the homeless (he experienced them as being emotionally cold and sterile), he takes a few pot shots at Christianity, but that’s OK. He’s also great in terms of literary comment. His insights are still relevant.\n\nDavid Baddiel – Jews Don’t Count Baddiel convincingly exposes the strange acceptability of, or acquiescence in, anti-semitism. And the callousness of the caricature, ‘it doesn’t matter because they’re rich’. Yes, Fagin in Oliver Twist; a nasty, insulting, Jew caricature right in front of our eyes. This is a necessary reminder.\n\nAnthony Storr – Freud Helpful overview which will add to the impression you already have that Freud was a bit pervy, but that it’s good to listen to people and let them talk.\n\nNigel Warburton – Free Speech A concise and helpful introduction. It’s very useful for all communicators to read up on the thinking around free speech, wherever the legislation currently stands. We always want to be helpful in our communication (‘the goal of our instruction is love’, says Paul). There are inevitably moments of frustration in this book, of course. But good to read.\n\nMargaret Walters – Feminism Again, very helpful. She honestly and fairly gives the Christian roots of feminism and traces its development through the first two ‘waves’. She doesn’t seem to acknowledge a third wave which Naomi Wolf and others certainly do (cf. The Beauty Myth). The Christian will likely be in agreement all the way up until abortion on demand.\n\nTeaching/How to…etc\n\nOdds and ends here, really…\n\nDavid Quantick – How to Write Everything Nah. But I was looking for a jolt to get into the discipline of writing (I’m working on a memoir).\n\nBrown & McNeil (ed.) – DADS Mostly humorous comments from celebs on fatherhood. I was able to use some of this for a sermon.\n\nJonathan Perks – Inspiring Leadership Some good reminders here, particularly about motivating and serving our teams and staff.\n\nJohn Maxwell – The Right to Lead I found it helpful to read a paragraph or two before leading meetings of various kinds.\n\nMichael Pollan – Caffeine I can’t remember why I read this. After a coffee it’ll come back to me.\n\nFaith G Harper – Un**** Your Brain Not recommended, but I wanted to hear how ‘hard-ball’, tell it like it is secular psychologists help people. As the title implies, this is not an academic treatment of the subject.\n\nRoy Lilly – Dealing with Difficult People Wait? What? I can be difficult too? Good to read.\n\nHenry Cloud – Necessary Endings Some very helpful stuff here also. Cloud is the Boundaries guy.\n\nLaura Mucha – We Need to Talk About Love Conversation-based reports of a wide variety of peoples’ views about relationships, from friendship to marriage. Again, not recommended necessarily, but a kind of check-in to see where the thinking is.\n\nWow! You made it to here. Well done. My advice to you for 2022 is this: spend a bit more time reading. And, with all the books out there, don’t forget the Book of Books.\n\n©2022 Lex Loizides / Church History Review\n\nGeorge Orwell – The Road to Wigan Pier (Book Review)\n\nI should have read this book years ago but, in the current climate where clear thinking is so needed, this 1937 semi-autobiographical, semi-sociological work seems uncannily relevant. Spoiler Alert: Orwell very strongly criticises (and mocks) the language and the alienating aspects of strident left-wing activism while supporting the values of justice and liberty.\n\nHe opens with superb but harrowing descriptions of life as a lodger in shared housing in the depressed North of England between the wars, and then of several trips into the coal mines to get a sense of working conditions. These high definition descriptions are utterly compelling and shocking. Our empathy and humanity is aroused and fortified. It’s impossible not to think of so many of our current workers who work and live in such similar conditions, nearly one hundred years after Orwell wrote.\n\nThere are some excellent insights into class identity, because Orwell, a plummy-accented Etonian, finds it difficult to remove himself from the target of socialist critique of ‘bourgeois ideology, manners etc’. This even though he (as a ‘sinking lower middle-class man who has never worked with his hands’) supports the cause of the working man. He continually finds his humane impulse towards the poor, and his desire to help a coherent movement emerge to address their needs, frustrated by the hackneyed slogans of Marxist propaganda.\n\nYet fascism must be resisted – gaining ground as it was with terrifying ease across Europe in the 1930s – and, he argues, socialism must become less repellant in order to attract people whose sympathies and sense of decency would point in that direction, whatever their background: ‘Throughout left-wing thought and writing…there runs an anti-genteel tradition, a persistent and often very stupid gibing at genteel mannerisms and genteel loyalties (or, in Communist jargon, ‘bourgeois values’). It is largely humbug…but it does major harm, because it allows a minor issue to block a major one. It directs attention away from the central fact that poverty is poverty, whether the tool you work with is a pick-axe or a fountain pen…For what I am worth it would be better to get me in on the Socialist side than to turn me into a Fascist. But if you are constantly bullying me about my ‘bourgeois ideology’…you will only succeed in antagonizing me. For you are telling me either that I am inherently useless or that I ought to alter myself in some way that is beyond my power. 201\n\nOn Dignity and Indignity. One miner he go to know suffered a debilitating injury as a result of a mining accident (‘Health and Safety’? What ‘Health and Safety’?). This man received a small allowance from the company but, Orwell notes, the man had to spend half a day each week, waiting at the company office to receive his pittance in cash: ‘This business of petty inconvenience and indignity, of being kept waiting about, of having to do everything at other people’s convenience, is inherent in working-class life. A thousand influences constantly press a working man down into a passive role.’ 43\n\nBy contrast: ‘A person of bourgeois origin goes through life with some expectation of getting what he wants, within reasonable limits. Hence the fact that in times of stress ‘educated’ people tend to come to the front; they are no more gifted than the others and their ‘education’ is generally quite useless in itself, but they are accustomed to a certain amount of deference and consequently have the cheek necessary to a commander.’ 44\n\nGood sense in the midst of poverty: In England, at least, there was no political assault on the working-class family: ‘A working man does not disintegrate under the strain of poverty as a middle-class person does. Take, for instance, the fact that the working class think nothing of getting married on the dole [receiving state benefits]. It annoys the old ladies in Brighton, but it is a proof of their essential good sense; they realize that losing your job does not mean that you cease to be a human being…Families are impoverished, but the family-system has not broken up. 78\n\nHumour: ‘In a Lancashire cotton-town you could probably go for months on end without once hearing an ‘educated’ accent, whereas there can hardly be a town in the South of England where you could throw a brick without hitting the niece of a bishop.’ 102\n\nOn the instant gentrification of lower middle-class Europeans emigres: ‘It was this that explained the attraction of India (more recently Kenya, Nigeria etc) for the lower-upper-middle class. The people…went there because in India, with cheap horses, free shooting, and hordes of black servants, it was so easy to play at being a gentleman.’ 108\n\nOn the servility and intimidation of the poor: ‘During the past dozen years the English working class have grown servile with a rather horrifying rapidity. It was bound to happen, for the frightful weapon of unemployment has cowed them. ‘Before the war [WW1] their economic position was comparatively strong, for though there was no dole [state benefits] to fall back upon, there was not much unemployment…A man did not see ruin staring him in the face every time he cheeked a ‘toff’, and naturally he did cheek a ‘toff’.’ 111\n\nOn Empire, Imperialism, and oppression: ‘I was in the Indian [Burmese, now Malaysia] Police five years, and by the end of that time I hated the imperialism I was serving with a bitterness which I probably cannot make clear…It is not possible to be a part of such a system without recognizing it as an unjustifiable tyranny. Even the thickest-skinned Anglo-Indian [by which I think he means a white Brit born there] is aware of this. Every ‘native’ face he sees in the street brings home to him his monstrous intrusion…The truth is that no modern man, in his heart of hearts, believes that it is right to invade a foreign country and hold the population down by force. Foreign oppression is a much more obvious, understandable evil that economic oppression…All over India there are Englishmen who secretly loathe the system of which they are a part; and just occasionally, when they are quite certain of being in the right company, their hidden bitterness overflows. … Not only were we [the Burmese Police, judicial system] hanging people and putting them in jail and so forth; we were doing it in the capacity of unwanted foreign invaders. The Burmese themselves never really recognized our jurisdiction…For five years I had been part of an oppressive system, and it had left me with a bad conscience…I was conscious of an immense weight of guilt that I had got to expiate…I [therefore] had reduced everything to the simple theory that the oppressed are always right and the oppressors are always wrong: a mistaken theory, but the natural result of being one of the oppressors yourself.’ 126-130\n\nOn the alarmingly sudden rise of tyrants: ‘Just how soon the pinch will come it is difficult to say; it depends, probably, upon events in Europe; but it may be that within two years, or even a year we shall have reached the decisive moment [He was writing in 1937. WW2 did indeed break in 1939]. That will also be the moment when every person with any brains or any decency will know in his bones that he ought to be on the Socialist side…It is doubtful whether a…heavy dragoon of Mosley’s stamp [Mosley, a British fascist and supporter of Hitler] would ever be much more than a joke to the majority of English people; though even Mosley will bear watching, for experience shows (eg. the careers of Hitler, Napoleon III) that to a political climber it is sometimes an advantage not to be taken too seriously at the beginning of his career…’ 186 Chilling stuff.\n\nOn how fascism rose so swiftly in the ‘30s: Fascism draws its strength from the good as well as the bad varieties of conservatism. To anyone with a feeling or tradition and for discipline it comes with its appeal ready-made. Probably it is very easy, when you have had a bellyful of the more tactless kind of Socialist propaganda, to see Fascism as the last line of defence of all that is good in European civilization…[It is] partly due to the mistaken Communist tactic of sabotaging democracy, i.e. sawing off the branch you are sitting on…As a result Fascism…has been able to pose as the upholder of the European tradition, and to appeal to Christian belief, to patriotism, and to the military virtues. It is far worse than useless to write Fascism off as ‘mass sadism’, or some easy phrase of that kind. If you pretend that it is merely an aberration which will presently pass off of its own accord, you are dreaming a dream from which you will awake when somebody coshes you with a rubber truncheon.’ 188\n\nOrwell’s conclusion: ‘Justice and liberty! Those are the words that have got to ring like a bugle across the world.’ 190\n\nYou can see, as I did, the relevance of much of this surprising book. Not one chapter is wasted or irrelevant. Not all are equally relevant of course – all chapters are equal, but some chapters are more equal than others – but as a stimulant to clear thinking, it’s well worth reading, even if you land in a different place to Orwell.\n\n©2020 Lex Loizides\n\nWhen I get a good book I try and make it last. When I get a great book it takes over and I don’t regret reading into the early hours of the next day. Like Bizos’ amazing autobiography, this is a great book.\n\nGeorge Bizos is South Africa’s most respected and most influential lawyer. Along with other legal experts like Arthur Chaskalson, and Bram Fischer, Bizos used his fine legal skills from the ‘50s onward not only to repeatedly attempt to restrain and frustrate the wickedness of the Apartheid Government but to actually keep Nelson Mandela and the other Rivonia trialists alive. South African history would have been very different if he had failed. It’s an amazing thing that the thirteen year old boy who came as a refugee fleeing Nazi-occupied Greece, and who for years couldn’t leave the country for fear the authorities would rescind his residence status, ended up defending the fathers of the nation, and became a key author of the South African Constitution.\n\nThis is a wonderful book, with the pace of a spy novel and the intricacy of a courtroom blockbuster. It’s a testimony to years of painstaking work that led finally to political freedom for the majority of South Africans. It’s also a testimony to life-long friendship through thick and thin.\n\nIf you’re South African you obviously want to learn your history, but if you have any aspirations to be a leader in South Africa whether in business, in church, in government, or in your local community you absolutely must, in my view, read about these heroes who have given so much for the future of the country.\n\nThere’s an informative three minute video that highlights Bizos here\n\nThere’s a review of Bizos’ autobiography, An Odyssey to Freedom here\n\nSome quotes:\n\nSpeaking of his early meeting with Mandela: ‘He was proud and made no apologies for his blackness. He once described apartheid as a moral genocide – an attempt to exterminate an entire people’s self-respect; he was not prepared to bend his knee.’ 28\n\nQuoting Greek thinker Pericles as an example of how to advance the cause of Africans in South Africa: ‘We decide or debate, carefully and in person, all matters of policy, and we hold, not that words and deeds go ill together, but that acts are foredoomed to failure when undertaken undiscussed. For we are noted for being at once most adventurous in action and most reflective beforehand.’ And after quoting Pericles he adds, ‘When I had finished, Nelson grinned. “That sounds just like what is needed here.”… The debates of the philosophers of Ancient Greece would permeate not only our discussions, but also our decision on legal strategy in the future.’ 74-75\n\nOn funding for the Treason Trial: ‘Christian Action in London took responsibility for fundraising and the Treason Trial Defence Fund was set up in South Africa to ensure that a proper trial could be conducted.’ 85\n\nOn Walter Sisulu: ‘Walter…grew up in a poor district of the Transkei and left school at sixteen to become a cowherd – but he had a brilliant mind. He was a short, pale man – his father, Victor Dickinson, was a white magistrate who had abandoned his two children and their Xhosa mother to move to Johannesburg. Walter would sometimes attend court to watch him preside, but his father never acknowledged him.’ 133\n\nOn Oliver Tambo: ‘ Oliver Tambo played a key role as the leader of the ANC in exile. On a visit to the United States, he was told that the student leader of a multi-billionaire banker was leading the anti-apartheid campaign at her university. Oliver asked to see her. Within days of meeting her, her father’s bank announced that it would not extend the repayment period of a large loan to South Africa. Other banks followed suit. The rand lost more than half its value against foreign currencies.’ 184\n\nOn discussions during negotiations just prior to Mandela’s release, when NM was given a small cottage to live in: ‘His time here was such that when he built his home in Qunu after his release it was designed on the same floor plan. Nelson welcomed his many guests wearing suits and ties, his collared shirts perfectly starched. He would take his daily constitutional along the garden paths and sometimes I would join him for the more confidential of our conversations. We learnt only later that the flowers were bugged.’ 195\n\nNM to Govt representatives during the negotiations: ‘the majority need the minority. We do not want to drive you into the sea.’ 197\n\nOn FW de Klerk: ‘In his speech after his release on 11 February 1989, Nelson had told the world that President FW de Klerk was “a man of integrity”. Not long afterwards, he confided in me that he was mistaken…there was no personal warmth between them… “He has sometimes very little idea of what democracy means”. When Nelson was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with De Klerk in 1993, he was not sure whether he should accept it. He felt that…he should not have to share it with a man who had spent most of his political life upholding apartheid. His hesitation was compounded by his personal difficulty with De Klerk’s lack of humility or self-reflection…’ [At the prize giving event] ‘Nelson expected De Klerk to acknowledge the immorality of apartheid and the suffering it has caused the majority of South Africans in his acceptance speech…Instead, De Klerk said only that ‘both sides had made mistakes’… ‘At a private dinner hosted by the Norwegian prime minister to honour the two laureates, Nelson’s patience finally snapped. Before the one hundred and fifty invited guests, he spoke off the cuff. In horrible detail he described the treatment of political prisoners on Robben Island, recounting an incident in which prison warders buried a man in the sand up to his head and urinated on him. He attacked the apartheid regime for the oppression of black people and for the murders committed by its squads. ‘What mistakes did we make when you were brutalising us and locking us up and banning us and not allowing us to vote?’ he asked angrily of De Klerk.’ 213-214\n\nOn the violence before the first election: ‘My message to those of you involved in this battle of brother against brother is this: Take your guns, knives and your pangas and throw them into the sea.’ 215\n\nNelson Mandela on Greece: ‘Greece is the mother of democracy and South Africa, its youngest daughter.’ 240\n\nGeorge Bizos – 65 Years of Friendship (Umuzi, Penguin Random House South Africa)\n\nI first picked up The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels when I was sixteen. Of course, I didn’t feel like a precocious sixteen-year-old then. I felt like a free-thinking young intellectual discovering poetry and politics, and exploring the vast literary landscape with a hunger and delight that, frankly, I wish I could maintain now. Like many significant works of literature this little book had its own killer line. Not quite the first line, but certainly as memorable as the best of them. It read: ‘The history of all societies is a history of class struggle.’ I read on eagerly. Thus The Communist Manifesto became my first conscious encounter with what I later learned was a ‘worldview’ and it was exhilarating to read something that claimed to know what was really going on in the world.\n\nMy teenage romance with Marxism didn’t last too long and suffered numerous blows as I discovered not its power to transform but, disappointingly, its consistent failure. And when I later became president of the Students’ Union at a small college in Sussex I was appalled at the sanctimonious reverence Marx was paid. The primary example of this happened not at the National Conference but at an (ironically) exclusive and somewhat secretive gathering of three Students’ Union presidents at Sussex University. Our host, the Sussex Uni president, asked us to be seated. He then proceeded to unveil, by pulling down on a little fluffy cord, a red velvet curtain, behind which were revealed portraits first of Marx, then Lenin, and finally the then General Secretary of the Soviet Union, Yuri Andropov. Once this ceremony was complete he opened the meeting. It was both strangely religious and hopelessly sad.\n\nBut that kind of obsequious nonsense was the least of it. The philosophy itself was problematic. Apart from his impressive, often accurate view of the past, Marx’s vision for future revolution and collective ownership had already obviously failed in the terrifyingly authoritarian regimes that claimed him as their founder. Even George Orwell said – somewhere in Homage to Catalonia – that he only saw communism work once, and then only for about three weeks, after which the usual egotistical impulse for status reasserted itself. One set of status/power/money lovers had been replaced by another set who soon began to act like those they replaced.\n\nThe Significance of Marx\n\nMarx and Engels felt they had discovered a scientific assessment of social progress akin to Darwin’s theory of evolution. The parallel is oddly appropriate for many Christians: we may agree with much of what both Darwin and Marx observed, but may also have considerable doubts about the projections they made based on the observation.\n\nAnd so to Peter Singer’s highly readable, Marx, A Very Short Introduction. He asks, ‘Can anyone now think about society without reference to Marx’s insights into the links between economic and intellectual life? Marx’s ideas brought about modern sociology, transformed the study of history, and profoundly affected philosophy, literature, and the arts. In this sense of the term – admittedly a very loose sense – we are all Marxists now.’ (3)\n\nHegel, History, and God\n\nThere were a number of points at which the thinking of others encouraged Marx to see religion as ultimately negative (for Marx this inevitably meant Christianity). In describing Hegel and the young Hegelians who influenced Marx Singer writes, ‘The goal of history became the liberation of humanity; but this could not be achieved until the religious illusion had been overcome.’ (22) Of course! Singer has unintentionally sent us back to a conversation in Eden in Genesis 3. And later, ‘theology is a kind of misdirected anthropology. What we believe of God is really true of ourselves. Thus humanity can regain its essence, which in religion it has lost.’ (23) And in an inevitable statement of absolute naturalism, ‘Thought does not precede existence, existence precedes thought.’ (24) Christians love the fact that in the beginning was thought and word, and all creation came into existence as a result of thought and word. But Marx only saw the way religion created compliance rather than progress.\n\nEconomic Injustice and its Cure\n\nWhen Marx came on to his views of economic injustice we find some of his arguments compelling but his solutions naive. When pointing out that driving wages down to as close as is necessary to merely keep workers alive, while keeping for themselves a significant amount of the value the workers create, Marx is highlighting a genuine manipulation of human resources. (33) Sure. We need just laws, and we ought to have them. But Marx asserted ‘the solution is the abolition of wages, alienated labour, and private property in one blow. In a word, communism.’ (36) and claimed, ‘Communism…is the genuine resolution of the antagonism between man and nature and between man and man…It is the riddle of history solved and knows itself as this solution.’ Singer adds, ‘One might expect that Marx would go on to explain in some detail what communism would be like. He does not – in fact nowhere in his writings does he give more than sketchy suggestions on this subject.’ (37)\n\nMarx and Engels consistently preached for a kind of millennial era of liberation, freedom from oppression, and peace among men. In one sense, the very best motivations of the communist vision are an echo of genuine Christianity, but with man, not God, at the centre. In fact it’s difficult to imagine the birth of Marxist philosophy in any but a Christian cultural environment, and a muscular 19th century Christianity at that. ‘From each according to his ability, to each according to his need,’ could have been bellowed out by William Booth and the Salvation Army; could, in fact, have been written by Luke in the Book of Acts (see Acts 2.45 [i], and 4.34 [ii]).\n\nMarx was also echoing a widely held Christian sentiment when he asserted that history has a definite goal; that of humanity reaching its greatest potential in an era of liberation and freedom. He probably didn’t realise how much a view of God’s sovereignty, of providence, and the millennial hope he carried in his thinking about the future. Singer brings us up to post-Christian speed: ‘Few historians…now see any goal in history. They do not explain history as the necessary path to anywhere. They explain it by showing how one set of events brought about another.’ (57)\n\nRevolution and Transformation\n\nMarx believed that Capitalism would force its own failure as workers would realise their exploitation, rise up, and redistribute wealth on a fair and equal basis. Private property would be abolished. The State would draw the allegiance of all men and the common good would be the goal of all. Absolutely wishful thinking. Singer: ‘According to Marx’s view of history, as the economic basis of society alters, so all consciousness alters. Greed, egoism, and envy are not ingrained forever in the character of human beings. They would disappear in a society in which private property and private means of production were replaced with communal property and socially organized means of production. We would lose our preoccupation with our private interests. Citizens of the new society would find their own happiness in working for the good of all. (81) Surely only the most inexperienced revolutionary could believe that? ‘It has been said that later in life Marx developed a less Utopian view of communism, but it is difficult to find much evidence of this.’ (83)\n\nHis view was so utopian in fact that he believed communism would become fully international in its reach, and therefore single nation-states would cease to exist, thus eradicating the impulse for war between nations. Armed forces would become a thing of the past. Cue not-the-only-dreamer, John Lennon. Actually though, while it’s certainly not imaginable now, it is nevertheless a hope that’s deeply embedded in the human psyche (we’re made in the image of God after all) and it echoes an idea worked out in Christian eschatology.\n\nHow do we assess Marx’s philosophy?\n\nSinger: ‘More than a century after Marx made these predictions, most of them are so plainly mistaken that one can only wonder why anyone sympathetic to Marx would attempt to argue that his greatness lies in the scientific aspects of his work. Judged by the standards of Marx’s time, the gap between rich and poor has narrowed dramatically throughout the industrialized world…Real wages have risen. Factory workers today earn considerably more than they need in order to remain alive and reproducing…Capitalism has gone through several crises, but nowhere has it collapsed as a result of its alleged internal contradictions. Proletarian revolutions have broken out in the less developed nations [Marx predicted it would happen in the more developed ones]. (88) He supposed ‘that real wages would remain around subsistence level; in fact the increase in productivity has allowed real wages to rise.’ (91) The ‘conception of freedom Marx espoused contains within it a difficulty Marx never sufficiently appreciated, a difficulty which can be linked with the tragic mutation of Marx’s views into a prop for murderously authoritarian regimes. This is the problem of obtaining the co-operation of each individual in the joint endeavour of controlling our society.’ (92) ‘Marx never intended a communist society to force the individual to work against his or her own interests for the collective good.’ (97)\n\nMarx’s view of human nature was hopelessly optimistic. The economic injustices he identified were not simply the result of capitalist systems (though those systems enabled them) but of fallen human nature, sinful nature. And even though today we can see improvement to human rights and progress in many areas, enacted in many laws, the fundamental problem of human sin is still wildly underestimated. This doesn’t let ‘capitalism’ off the hook of course, let alone individuals greedy for their own advancement at the expense of others. In fact, those Christian leaders and pastors living in countries with ever-widening gaps between rich and poor need to develop a healthy desire and determination to work for a more just society. Nevertheless, the communism that developed in the twentieth century was never the utopia Marx dreamt of; that dreamt-of equality only ever appeared in propaganda films. Equally unconvincing are the arguments that true Marxism has never been properly tried. The reason it never lasts longer than a few weeks is because the philosophy radically over-estimates the goodness of human nature. What is needed is a philosophy that (goes beyond philosophy and) gets into the heart and changes human nature, that leads to repentance from sin and faith in Christ, and produces an unwavering resolve for social justice. To put it in the words of the most famous prayer, ‘Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.’\n\nMarx, A Very Short Introduction is by Peter Singer and published by the Oxford University Press.\n\nIs Singer too hard on Marx? Too soft? How does the gospel address the injustices Marx raised? Comment below.\n\n[i] Acts 2.45 ‘and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need.’\n\n[ii] Acts 4.34 ‘there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales.’\n\n© 2019 Lex Loizides / Church History Review\n\nCS Lewis talked about the quest to gain access to the ‘inner ring’, something he was unable to do at Oxford due to the snobbery of the English establishment, and the embarrassment Lewis caused fellow academics by writing about the devil as though he were a real being.[i] As you gain entrance to one ring, you discover yet another further in which holds yet more influence. Every effort is made to progress to the inner rings. Entrance becomes more costly. You can forfeit your soul as you gain the world. Once inside each ring, you strengthen its walls so that it remains difficult for others to enter (one UK pastor was telling me of South African émigrés to England who, having scrambled to get British passports and residency, are now solidly and immovably pro-Brexit).\n\nOf course for outsiders like Lewis, slowly earning your way to an inner ring may not only take years but may turn out to be a hollow promise after all. But the nature of the old British establishment was that if you were born into the right family, went to the right school, had the right kind of accent and bearing, you could skip all those tawdry outer rings and accelerate right to the centre of things where commoners rarely, if ever, appear. The inner rings are inevitably smaller, and fewer people share the high-octane experience of access to key decisions and key information.\n\nWhat MI6, the UK’s secret intelligence organisation, hadn’t bargained for was that once their trusted men were in the inner ring it was practically the only place they could let their guard down and share their experiences without fear of a snooping ear. And boy did they offload. Here were brothers, comrades, co-spies in a world where no one else knew their true work, not even their wives. And, from the 1930s through to the early 1960s, one man in particular – charming, intelligent, a veritable Bond – was picking them clean of every detail, every initiative, and every name.\n\nEntrance into the UK spy organisation’s inner rings was surprisingly easy for Kim Philby. He simply asked a friend of his father’s to recommend him. ‘I know their people!’ was recommendation enough. In the 1940s the old boy network was considered as sound as a pound. A typical Eton old boy was as British as you could be. But it was at Cambridge that Philby first encountered the vision of a communist society. And it was an idealistic vision that held his loyalty for the remainder of his life. In fact he was so devoted to this ideal that he gave uncritical obedience to his KGB handlers from first to last. Philby’s beliefs as a student were well known, but when the Soviets recruited him they advised him not to join the Communist Party but rather to appear to grow out of that youthful phase and adopt more right-wing views. He obeyed, and became the KGB’s most senior operative; one who infiltrated the British security system to the highest levels. Philby, the Eton and Cambridge old boy, who loved cricket and was a thoroughly good egg, was ushered into the inner ring, and became the most notorious spy of his generation. He was so thoroughly British that the British refused to doubt him, and the KGB refused to trust him.\n\nAs Ben Macintyre describes in this highly readable account of Philby’s adventures, he actually became head of the UK’s anti-Soviet division – an almost unbelievable feat. The most senior Soviet spy in Britain became the head of Britain’s anti-Soviet operations. And the information Philby was sending to the Soviet Union was so thorough and so accurate that the KGB began to be very nervous of him.\n\nAfter two other well-to-do Cambridge recruits were exposed as Soviet spies and defected, the spotlight fell on Philby. He must have tipped them off. The CIA in America was certain of it. MI5 (British security service) and MI6 (British foreign intelligence service) had differing views on Philby. MI5 were convinced he had been a double-agent. MI6 thought those horrible people at MI5 were just slandering him, and had nothing concrete against him. And so, as an old boy truly in the security of a tightening inner ring, Philby was exonerated and declared to be so in Parliament by fellow-Etonian, Harold Macmillan. Incredibly, only a few years after such a close shave, he was working for MI6 again.\n\nOf course, it all finally caught up with him, and he was probably allowed to escape to avoid British embarrassment at such negligence within the intelligence community. But if he had expected a hero’s welcome in Moscow he was to be sorely disappointed. He was still not trusted and was kept at arms length. He lived in a small flat, avidly reading through old cricket games in old copies of the Times when he was able to get them, desperate of news from home. A humbling isolated end. A Briton in exile.\n\nPhilby’s betrayal, not only of country, but of friends, was intensely difficult to process by those who were closest to him. They were left devastated by the sheer scale of the deceit when the evidence was revealed. We’re told Nicholas Elliot, in MI6, never fully recovered from the shock of it all. His closest friend was working for the Communists. He re-lived whole segments of his life with a new perspective. The realisation that he had spilled the beans on numerous activities which was relayed to the Soviet Union must have been unbearable to him. And the American James Angleton, another close friend, nearly destroyed the CIA through increasingly invasive internal witch-hunts prompted by post-Philby paranoia.\n\nSuave, sophisticated, well educated, gracious, the quintessential British gentleman, Kim Philby deceived his closest friends. And all for an ideal he didn’t seem to review beyond his earlier infatuation with it. Somehow he looked past Stalin’s crimes and doggedly held on to a pristine ideal. He looked past the ruthless disappearance of KGB handlers who were suddenly under suspicion, and kept looking for the communist dream. He didn’t live to see the fall of it all along with the Berlin Wall in 1989.\n\nAs a result of his winnowing work he frustrated numerous cold-war operations, sent hundreds of agents to their deaths, and told a gazillion bare-faced lies, not least of which were his declarations of innocence in his mother’s flat before a crowd of reporters after Macmillan’s statement in the House of Commons. You can see footage of that and of him speaking in the USSR here\n\n‘Meet it is I set it down that one may smile, and smile, and be a villain’, says Hamlet. Macintyre’s superbly readable account of the secret world of high-class spies has certainly been one of my most engaging reads of this year, and is a subject which continues to fascinate. Surely it’s time for a film version.\n\nBen Macintyre, A Spy Among Friends.

Wilson’s highly readable C.S. Lewis – A Biography I thought Lewis might get a little rough treatment. That’s because I’d already seen how Wilson dealt with him in his biography of John Betjeman.\n\nIt’s true that Lewis and Betjeman couldn’t stand each other, but it wasn’t entirely Lewis’s fault. Lewis, a young man, had become a Tutor of English at Magdalen College, Oxford. Betjeman was one of his first difficult students. To Betjeman Lewis seemed overly serious, unimaginative and hard. To Lewis Betjeman appeared affected, unintelligent and lazy, regularly failing to hand in essays on time. In fact, on one occasion Lewis was pleasantly surprised by Betjeman submitting a decent essay and looked forward to the tutorial. He later wrote in his diary, ‘I soon discovered [the essay] to be a pure fake, for he knew nothing about the work when we began to talk. I wish I could get rid of the idle prig.’[i]\n\nHe did eventually, and possibly unnecessarily. Betjeman never forgave him and, in letters written years later, referred to Lewis as ‘my old enemy’.\n\nHis career\n\nClive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast on November 29, 1898 and died on November 22, 1963. Although bright, he hated school and was moved from place to place until his father finally agreed to have him privately tutored. After gaining a triple first at Oxford he became Tutor of English Literature and Language at Magdalen, Oxford, a position he held for nearly 30 years. Shockingly, he was never made Professor until he was invited by Cambridge University to take the Chair of Medieval English Literature where he served until retirement.\n\nHis literary ambition was to be a poet, but he is best known for the Narnia Chronicles a series of children’s books. Through the influence of friends such as J.R.R. Tolkien, Charles Williams and others he moved from atheism to theism and finally to Christianity. He wrote some of the most influential Christian books of the 20th Century and was the central member of an influential literary circle called ‘The Inklings’.\n\nA.N. Wilson’s C.S. Lewis – the best bad biography I’ve read!\n\nIt’s a speedy, engaging, infuriating read. Wilson is rightly peeved by attempts to ‘canonize’ Lewis. ‘There are those readers who are so uplifted by the sublimity of Lewis at his best as a writer that they assume that he was himself a sublime being, devoid of blemishes.’ Even though that is an exaggeration one can understand Wilson’s desire to describe the man more realistically. There’s a difference, however, between bringing a man back down to earth and burying him.\n\nAfter reading Wilson I also read an earlier Lewis biography to get a little balance. Wilson refers to (and draws heavily from) Green and Hooper’s biography from the early 70s. Undeniably less well written, I didn’t, however, find it gushing with hero-worship. Surprised by Joy although frustrating for different reasons, is also essential reading.\n\nWhy is ANW’s biography of Lewis ‘bad’?\n\nWhere to begin? First of all, it must be said that since writing about Lewis, A.N. Wilson has had a change of heart about Christianity itself, and has moved from atheism to the Christian Faith. This does, in some degree, temper our response to what appears to be one of his aims in the biography: to discredit Christianity itself. This constant sneering disrupted my enjoyment of the book, like an irritating fly.\n\nFrom the cover endorsements to Wilson’s clunky misunderstanding of ‘A Grief Observed’ (Lewis’s most authentic, mature expression of belief was doubt, supposedly) the reader senses a quiet celebration that this is the book that humiliates Lewis and his faith. With a silent nod and smile, we can breathe a sigh of relief, congratulate Wilson and go back to our skepticism unscathed: Lewis has been put in his place.\n\nMy copy is the Harper Perennial 2005 edition (which I understand includes some revisions based on reader’s reactions to the first edition of 1990). Before this, I don’t recall ever seeing the cover of a biography which says more about the biographer than the subject:\n\n‘Wilson’s biography is probably the best imaginable…he is a brilliant biographer.’ Anthony Burgess (front cover).\n\n‘The more biography Wilson writes, the better he gets – this life of CS Lewis is his best yet. It’s a vivacious and compassionate book. Wilson’s range of interests makes him an ideal match for the subject.’ Andrew Motion\n\n‘It seems fitting that AN Wilson should have written the definitive biography of Lewis, and it is a superb job.’ John Bayley\n\nThe fact that the cover endorsements are primarily about Wilson’s literary skill, rather than Lewis’s, should be a clue: this is a take-down!\n\nBut enough of covers. It’s an odd thing to be forced to ask yourself a series of distracting questions as you move through the book: Does the biographer respect the subject?\n\nDid he understand the nature of religious conversion and its implications? Does he understand the role and limitations of Christian apologetics?\n\nHe exposes the jealousies and nastiness of CSL’s peers but is ANW himself entirely free from such nastiness given that he appears to support their criticisms?\n\nWhy the persistent schoolboy name-calling, likening CSL to a low-class ‘police court solicitor’ (a disrespectful mocking of CSL’s father’s occupation)? Yet, even schoolboys have an opportunity to respond. Lewis has no ability to respond.\n\nWhile there may be some debate about the nature of CSL’s relationship to Mrs. Moore in the early days, are we to believe that CS Lewis cherished being both a domestic and sexual masochist? You needn’t be a Freudian scholar to have a few chuckles at some of Wilson’s psychoanalytical observations.\n\nThe bigger question is if Wilson is so repelled by Lewis’s Christianity and by Lewis as a personality, then why on earth write a biography of him? May we ask for a proper revision?\n\nWhat we have here is a gossipy attempt to cut the puffed-up Lewis down. Positively tabloid my good man! It just makes Wilson appear pompous and mean-spirited.\n\nIn an attempt at balance, Wilson writes, ‘Insufferably annoying as he may have been in life, there was also something glorious about him.’[ii] Seriously? Glorious?\n\nLewis’s Reluctant Conversion\n\nIt may have struck you as odd that Lewis is usually quoted as describing his conversion negatively. He says that in 1929 he ‘gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed; perhaps that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.’[iii]\n\nBut actually, as both ANW and Green/Hooper helpfully point out, this was an intellectual assent to theism, not his decision to follow Jesus Christ which came about two years later. Wilson adds that Lewis, at the time, was emphasizing his unwillingness to accept any high sounding ‘divine call’ which might undermine him.\n\nHe still considered himself a ‘prodigal’ looking for any opportunity to escape the inevitable. Green/Hooper write of Lewis’s 1929 experience, ‘This conversion was, however, to theism pure and simple, and not to Christianity. He knew nothing about the incarnation at this stage.’[iv]\n\nLewis, Tolkien and Dyson\n\nAlthough in his autobiography Surprised by Joy Lewis only touches on the events surrounding his Christian conversion Green/Hooper describe it in some detail:\n\n‘Lewis was still thinking about myth and resurrection when, on Saturday evening (19 September 1931), he invited Tolkien and Hugo Dyson to dine with him at Magdalen. Probably none of them had any idea what a momentous impact this night’s conversation would have to Lewis…In Lewis’s rooms they talked about Christianity till 3.00am when Tolkien left to go home. After seeing him through the little postern door that opens on to Magdalen Bridge, Lewis and Dyson continued the discussion for another hour, walking up and down the cloister of New Buildings…On Monday, 28 September, Lewis and Warren [his brother] took a picnic lunch to Whipsnade Zoo…But something happened to Lewis on the way to Whipsnade for, as he says in Surprised by Joy: ‘When we set out I did not believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and when we reached the zoo I did…It was…like when a man, after a long sleep, still lying motionless in bed, becomes aware that he is now awake.’\n\nA few days later (1 October) Lewis wound up a long letter to Arthur Greeves with the news: ‘I have just passed on from believing in God to definitely believing in Christ…My long night talk with Dyson and Tolkien had a good deal to do with it.’[v]\n\nLewis on ‘Low Church’ and ‘High Church’\n\nLewis was not a so-called ‘high church’ Anglican. In fact, he was forthright on this point. ‘I’m not…what you call high. To me the real distinction is not high and low, but between religion with a real supernaturalism and Salvationism on the one hand, and all watered down modernist versions on the other.’[vi]\n\nLewis on Adam as an Historical Figure\n\nOn one evening, fellow academic Helen Gardner was dining with Lewis and a number of others at Lewis’s home. Wilson writes:\n\n‘Conversation at the table turned on the interesting question of whom, after death, those present should most look forward to meeting. One person suggested he would like to meet Shakespeare; another said St. Paul.\n\n‘But you, Jack,’ said the friends (or, as Helen Gardner felt, the disciples), ‘who would be your choice?’\n\n‘Oh I have no difficulty in deciding,’ said Lewis. ‘I want to meet Adam.’ He went on to explain why, very much in the terms outlined in A Preface to ‘Paradise Lost’, where he wrote: ‘Adam was, from the first, a man in knowledge as well as in stature. He alone of all men ‘had been in Eden, in the garden of God.’…He had ‘breathed the aether and was accustomed to converse with God ‘face to face’.\n\nBe that as it may, Adam is not likely, if she has anything to do with it, to converse with Helen Gardner. She ventured to say so. Even, she told Lewis, if there really were, historically, someone whom we could name as ‘the first man’, he would be a Neanderthal ape-like figure, whose conversation she could not conceive of finding interesting.\n\nA stony silence fell on the dinner table. Then Lewis said gruffly, ‘I see we have a Darwinian in our midst.’’[vii]\n\nThe inclusion of this incident may be intended to make Lewis appear either misogynistic, self-serving, rude, a fundamentalist or all of the above. The point, though, is that Lewis did consider Adam to be a real historical figure.\n\nC.S. Lewis, T.S. Eliot, and J.R.R Tolkein\n\nThere are numerous other small points of interest like this one. Lewis’s resistance to modern poetry alienated him from the emerging generation of poets. His own relative failure as a poet, especially as a narrative poet, even after publishing two books of poetry, was a source of sadness to him. And indeed, for those of us who have actually put in the hours to read every published poem by Lewis, we concur that he wasn’t a success (although there are a few brilliant pieces).\n\nSome may, however, sympathise with him when considering the work of the modernists’ leading light T.S. Eliot. Lewis wrote:\n\n‘For twenty years I’ve stared my level best\n\nTo see if evening – any evening – would suggest\n\nA patient etherized upon a table;\n\nIn vain. I simply wasn’t able.’[viii]\n\nWilson also describes such fascinating moments as when CSL and Tolkien decide they’ve had enough of the popular novels being published and made a commitment to each other that they will write ‘better’ books: ‘I’m afraid we shall have to try and write some ourselves!’ What a result!\n\nC.S. Lewis – never Professor of English at Oxford\n\nIs it not strange that Lewis never became a Professor at Oxford?\n\nWilson gives us the reason:\n\n‘It could be said that Lewis was exiled, in some sense, for his refusal to toe the line. It was not his failure to be a good graduate supervisor which cost him the Oxford chair, it was Mere Christianity and The Screwtape Letters.’[ix]\n\nIn 1954, however, Cambridge established a new ‘Chair’ of English and Lewis was invited, and accepted the position: Professor of Medieval and Renaissance Literature. His lectures were sensationally popular.\n\nOther Biographers\n\nTowards the end of Wilson’s book, apart from a somewhat rushed feel, there is an attempt to undermine other biographers and historians of Lewis. Hooper is dismissed as unreliable. Wheaton College is snubbed with characteristic upper-class English pomposity: It’s not a real University is it, after all? Once again, we hear the persistent drone undermining Lewis’s Christianity: it’s that pesky fly again.\n\nThere is much to enjoy in Wilson’s biography but so much that is disappointing. In a book so littered with uncharitable moments, perhaps Wilson’s final paragraph gives a typical example: ‘Those who knew Lewis in the days of his flesh might suppose that he would chiefly be remembered as a vigorously intelligent university teacher and critic who also wrote some children’s stories.’\n\nSo that’s it then! Lewis, phenomenally popular during his own lifetime and an inspiration to thousands of Christian intellectuals, is triumphantly minimised and dismissed: not a Professor, not a best-selling author, just a ‘university teacher who wrote children’s stories’.\n\nIt’s time for a better CS Lewis Biography\n\nTo coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of Lewis’s death in 2013, when he was honoured in Poets’ Corner in Westminster Abbey, Alister McGrath released a new biography of Lewis. For a review in Christianity Today check here. Readers of that biography may still feel we need something more like Wilson in style and more like Hooper in appreciation.

It’s an exciting time. We’re launching a congregation of Jubilee Community Church in the heart of Cape Town and we’re ready to go!\n\nThere has been, in recent years, a much-needed focus on cities. Christians have been moving steadily away from the city centres and into the suburbs, often leaving the city without a strong witness.\n\nYet, we’re told, that the creative culture-making heartbeat (the heart that sends its influence to the rest of our culture) is right back in the place the believers left. If we reach the cities (so the argument goes) there will be a ‘trickle down’ effect that will effect the rest of society.\n\nSmall Town Jesus by Donnie Griggs is a robust response. Griggs, who pastors a large church in Morehead City, North Carolina (a town of about nine thousand) raises a banner for the myriad of small towns that may, therefore, seem less significant.\n\nWhile not denying the importance of cities, he makes a plea for the importance of mission to smaller towns. He speaks from his own experience of being known and getting to know the folk in Morehead, while seeking to build a church that cares for its community and is engaged in a wider mission.\n\nNow, why would I spend time reading a book devoted to mission in small towns when I am about to relocate my work space into the heart of the world’s most beautiful city (I could easily support that assertion with sources, but it’s just a fact).\n\nAnd – I’ll go further – why am I recommending this book to you, whatever size town you’re in, but especially if you live in a city?\n\nBeing a Good Local\n\nSimply for this reason: that I have realised, both as I’ve been traveling into the city regularly over the last year, and as I’ve read Donnie’s book, that, in my section of the city centre, I need to become a local.\n\nThat’s not something we tend to think of in our cities. We have the dubious luxury of being anonymous much of the time. We expect speed. We expect quality. If something’s not good we complain. And we complain properly. We’ll put a bad review online. We’re helping raise standards by complaining. Griggs has a technical term for this that’s worth remembering. It is called ‘being a jerk’. Hmm. Maybe it’s time to change.\n\nHere are a few pointers Griggs gives for being a good local in a small town. I want to encourage you to take these on board in your locality especially if you’re in the city centre. And feel free to add your own thoughts and comments below. Let’s learn from each other.\n\nYour reputation matters in a small town\n\nThings are really close in a village or town. Yet, in the city, you can also develop a different kind of reputation by deliberately seeking to serve those around your work space. Be different from those who rush by. Do good in the city. Be honest. Build a good reputation by being consistently compassionate.\n\nLearn to Enjoy Small Talk\n\nIn the city, people are often in a rush. But people are also incredibly lonely. Slow down and look around. You’ll see lots of people who are alone and who would benefit from your friendship. Cape Town is not a European city. It is an African city with a lot of Europe in it. People are very open to making connections. There’s a warmth that you sometimes don’t feel in a European city. Griggs writes, that ‘always acting like you have somewhere better to be will eventually lead to unnecessarily offending’ people. That’s good for your city too, even if the rush is tolerated.\n\nShop Local as much as possible\n\nHe writes, ‘I would encourage you to see shopping local as an opportunity to become a good local.’ Whether it’s caterers, lunchtime appointments in the city, printing, or just where you regularly purchase coffee or church refreshments, I want the businesses in my section of Cape Town to know we’re part of the neighbourhood. We’re buying local and eating local because we are local. Griggs talks a lot about loving local food and then there’s a whole section about soft-shell crabs. Normally you’d expect an editor’s intervention but these guys in Morehead City love their soft-shell crabs.\n\nDon’t be a Jerk\n\n(It’s worth mentioning again) He prefaces this section helpfully by noting, ‘I’m not saying that everyone who lives in a big city is a jerk.’ Followed by the word, ‘But…’ and then so helpfully corrects how, even we as Christians, can act in an unnecessarily discourteous way when dealing with folks in a city.\n\nBut, ‘in a small town, you should take every opportunity to be kind and courteous.’\n\nThere’s a danger in city life because we probably won’t see a person again, and can therefore treat them with less respect than they deserve, especially if they’re serving us poorly. In a small town our bad responses will get known very quickly. But that behaviour is no less acceptable in the city. And will also be known. You reap what you sow. As in the town and suburb, so in the city, a Christian’s rudeness can have a deadening effect on mission.\n\nBe a Blessing\n\nI am taking this on board for our city site: ‘When considering how you can engage the culture of your small town with the gospel, please don’t just settle for contextualized church programs and church facilities. Love where you live and serve where you live. Let everyone know that you really care about them, whether they come to your church or not.’\n\nDonnie has written a highly readable book with a great and simple message: be a blessing to your town. Be deliberate and consistent.\n\nI want to add that, if you’re in the city, see your section of the city, whether you work there each day, or whether you live there, as your own locality, your own small town within the city, and act accordingly.\n\nSmall Town Jesus is available on Amazon here\n\nJubilee Community Church’s City Congregation will begin meeting on Sundays from 25th September, 10.30am, 33 Kloof Street, Cape Town\n\nFor a 30-Day Prayer Guide to pray for the launch of the site click here\n\n©2016 Lex Loizides / Church History Review"
