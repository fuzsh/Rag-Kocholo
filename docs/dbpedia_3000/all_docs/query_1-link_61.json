        "text": "When many people think of New York, their minds immediately leap to the bustling, busy New York City. While NYC is a worthwhile place to visit, many smaller towns in New York deserve their share of recognition, especially for those looking to escape the busy city and relax in scenic, off-the-beaten-path towns filled with historical significance and unique architecture. From quirky theatres showcasing vibrant designs to historic museums with intricate stories to share, there is a lot to see in terms of beautiful architecture. Whether from a small town or a large city, you will want to pack your bags and visit these ten beautiful towns to immerse yourself in their designs and well-preserved histories.\n\nSaugerties\n\nNestled along the Hudson River, Saugerties is a quaint town filled with spectacular examples of 19th-century architecture. The town’s main street hosts a series of cozy antique shops, family-owned businesses, and the historic Orpheum Theater, whose history dates back to 1908. Driving about 15 minutes from Saugerties’s downtown, one can find The Opus 40, a sculpture park sculptor Harvey Fite created in the 20th century. Filled with impressive dry-stone platforms, ramps, and pedestals, Fite created the structures in the 14-acre park entirely by hand. Additionally, a visit to Saugerties is not complete without visiting the Saugerties Lighthouse, which dates back to 1869. Today, the lighthouse also serves as a bed and breakfast, filled with furniture that attempts to serve as a time capsule and replicate its late 19th-century appearance.\n\nKingston\n\nKingston, settled in the mid-17th century, hosts an incredible array of historic architecture. The Rondout-West Strand Historic District in Kingston is truly unique, as it is a neighborhood of 500+ historic buildings on a waterfront, mainly from the 19th. Even a short stroll through the district is full of cultural charm and Instgrammable spots that tourists adore. Moreover, behind the views, visitors can check out all types of retailers in the district, from antique dealers to restaurants to art galleries. Nearby sits the Stockade District, with architecture that dates back to the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The Ulster Country Courthouse and Senate House are especially worth the visit in the zone. Lastly, a visit to the Old Dutch Church will surely be memorable. Built in 1852, it features Renaissance Revival architecture, with a vaulted ceiling interior and a Tiffany window from 1891.\n\nCold Spring\n\nWith over 200 historic buildings, visiting Cold Spring feels like a trip back to pre-Civil War times. Walking down Main Street, one can see an abundance of well-preserved Victorian and Colonial buildings. Hidden in the woods sits the Ruins of the Cornish Estate, formerly a grand mansion that tragically burned down in 1958. Today, the forest is gradually intertwining with the ruins, making it a beautifully unique site to visit. Moreover, at a five-minute drive from Cold Spring, visitors can see the Bannerman Castle, a beautiful but abandoned military arsenal built in the early 20th century and modeled after an old Scottish castle. Beyond the architecture, Cold Spring is a fun town with plenty of waterside opportunities along the Hudson River, such as hiking, sightseeing, and boating.\n\nIthaca\n\nIthaca, famed for its Ivy League Cornell University, is also an abode of stunning history and architecture. The town has multiple historic districts and is a haven for visitors who want to see many architectural styles. The most prominent styles on display include Greek and Gothic Revival, Federalist, Italia Villa, Shingle, Queen Anne, and Second Empire. Most visitors head straight to the downtown Historic District, which has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2005. With 64 contributing buildings, one can choose from various landmarks, such as the Clinton Hall, State Theater, and Boardman House, showcasing Greek Revival and Italianate styles. This district also contains the Ithaca Commons, a two-block, eclectic pedestrian mall redesigned in 2016 with architectural inspiration from Ithaca’s famous gorges and their geometric patterns. Concluding a tour in Ithica, one must visit the Clinton House downtown. Being a beautiful example of Greek Revival, four US presidents have stayed in the building.\n\nRhinebeck\n\nWith tales dating back to the 17th century, Rhinebeck is a town visitors who want to see unique architecture must visit. The Rhinebeck Village Historic District, for example, is on the National Register of Historic Places and contains over 270 buildings with varying architectural styles. Most buildings here are from the colonial period through the 19th century. The Beekman Arms and Delamater Inn stands out, and claims to be America’s oldest continuously operated hotel. Dating back to the 1730s, the Benner House is the oldest in this village and features stone architecture based on German traditions. Another must-visit location is The Wilderstein Historic Site, a grand house built in 1852 featuring a Queen Anne style and many fine details, such as stained glass windows.\n\nRome\n\nSituated in upstate New York, Rome has several beautiful architectural attractions that cannot be missed. The Gansevoort-Bellamy Historic District is a quaint area of the city that hosts a variety of architectural styles, with highlights including the Rome City Hall, St. Peter’s Catholic Church, and the Oneida County Courthouse.\n\nAnother important landmark in the city is the Rome Train Station. Having been constructed in the early 20th century, it has a neoclassical design that features magnificent white pillars at the entrance and tall, arched windows in the interior. A recent restoration from the Rome municipality added a complementary, vibrant, modern feel to the atmosphere. Although small, the neo-gothic design of the Zion Church, built in 1850, is also worth the visit. After touring the landmarks, most people end the day at Copper City Brewing Company, which boasts great beer and fun conversations.\n\nSleepy Hollow\n\nContrary to its name, Sleepy Hollow is a lively and vibrant town that cannot be left off the list. The community initially garnered fame thanks to the Washinton Irving tale, “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” and its spooky specter, the Headless Horseman. Visiting the Headless Horseman Monument is a must for those familiar with the tale and ready to brave the horror. Afterward, one can find the Phillipsburg Manor, a colonial-era trading center nearby.\n\nPerhaps one of the most impressive architectural marvels of the town, The Kykuit Mansion of the Rockefeller Estate is a meticulously well-preserved, 40-room house built in the 20th century, where the Rockefeller family resided for four generations.\n\nSkaneateles\n\nAnyone road-tripping through New York needs to stop by Skaneateles. Not only is it situated along the scenic Skaneateles Lake, but the Skaneateles Historic District is home to numerous Federal, Italianate, and Greek Revival homes. Here, a short stroll contains landmarks like the 1806 Thayer House and the 1888 Bank Building. To fully immerse in the historic architecture, visitors can stay in one of the many historic inns or bed and breakfasts to fully immerse in the historic architecture. The Sherwood Inn is one of the most famous, featuring a Victorian Structure that dates back to 1807. Although some renovations have been made, the inn’s original charm and architecture largely remain, making guests feel they are stepping back in time. Similarly, the Reuel E. Smith House (also known as Cobweb Cottage) features timeless Gothic Revival architecture from 1852 and is the only remaining house by Davis in Onondaga County.\n\nWoodstock\n\nThe colorful town of Woodstock is filled with cultural, artistic, and architectural gems. A great place to start is Tinker Street, the eclectic center of this small town, filled with souvenir shops and restaurants. Sitting on a hill nearby, the Judge Jonathan Hasbrouck House is a historic, two-story home built in 1800 with Federal-style architecture, a bluestone structure, and a gable roof. Although small, the Holy Transfiguration Church is full of history, dating back to 1891, handcrafted with a wooden, Gothic Revival-style structure. Due to its history, it is now on the National Register of Historic Places. Behind the architecture, the town is home to some lovely destinations that all tourists adore. While nature enthusiasts head to the Thorn Preserve - Catskill Center for outdoor views, foodies can enjoy an Asian meal at Good Night.\n\nNew Rochelle\n\nNew Rochelle is a town dedicated to preserving its heritage and history, which can be felt the moment visitors step into its city limits. The town is home to the Thomas Paine Cottage, a well-maintained wood frame saltbox structure house. Founding father and author of Common Sense, Thomas Paine, resided in this property from 1802 to 1806. The cottage maintains some furniture used by Thomas Paine himself, which is open to the public for visitors to see. Leland Castle is another item that must be on New Rochelle visitors’ bucket lists. This Gothic Revival-style building dates back to 1859, with walls composed of coarse granite stone. For visitors who want to see more of the Gothic Revival structure in New Rochelle, the Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church is an excellent addition to the itinerary. Built in the mid-19th century, this church, with stone walls and stained glass windows, continues to function today. While the architecture in New Rochelle is more than enough to last tourists multiple days, the town has a lot more to offer. From sunbathing along the Hudson Park and Beach to Rock Climbing at The Rock Club, the possibilities are endless.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nNext time you plan a vacation or a long weekend away, make sure to include these towns on your itinerary.
