        "text": "The earliest architectural style most commonly encountered in Kentucky is the Federal style. Classified as ranging from 1780 to 1820 nationally, it persisted in the Commonwealth until around 1840. Compared with the Greek Revival style, which succeeded the Federal in popularity, characteristics of the latter style can seem…severe. Restraint is one of the hallmarks of the style in Kentucky, and many of the surviving examples tend to be brick buildings.\n\nOther features of the Federal style in Kentucky include an emphasis on symmetrical composition, with double-hung sash windows with six-over-six, nine-over-nine and twelve-over-twelve configurations. Muntins are typically thin, and lintels and sills are plain and restrained (there’s that word again!).\n\nJackarches are often used over openings on the exterior – and are sometimes the only hint of a “decorative” feature of the facade of a Federal house (although obviously the jackarch is also utilitarian).\n\nDoorways might feature transoms, or fanlights, with narrow moldings.\n\nFederal-style buildings in the Commonwealth are typically rectangular or square in plan. Floor plans employed include hall-parlor, side-passage and central passage (although this is by no mean the rule – there are some single pen log houses in Kentucky with spectacular Federal woodwork on the interior).\n\nMany Federal-style dwellings in Kentucky are brick, laid in Flemish bond, with a side-gable roof.\n\nMy favorite aspect of the Federal style lies not on the exterior, but on the interior – which is characterized by elegant lines – and unlike the Greek Revival style – human-scale proportions.*\n\nBaseboards are not very high, maybe four to six inches; chair rails are common; beaded edges are featured on windows, cupboards, and doors; and mantles are delicate and decidely not over-the-top.\n\nThe Federal style marked the “end” of Kentucky’s pioneer days, and as it was overtaken by the oft-overblown proportions of the Greek Revival style, many Federal style dwellings were modified or updated with more current and trendy styles. I was drawn to the simplicity of the lines of the Federal style even as a child, and it remains one of my favorites today.\n\nThere are many, many more Federal-style buildings I could have shared – especially some high-style examples – but I hope this post serves as a basic introduction to the first nationally popular style employed across Kentucky.\n\n*The Greek Revival style is fabulous – but sometimes I feel dwarfed by the 14 foot ceilings, massive baseboards, and heavy woodwork…not to mention the temple-front portico…"
