        "text": "The Second Bank of the United States was designed in 1818 by William Strickland and constructed between 1819 and 1824. It is located on the south side of Chestnut Street between Fourth and Fifth Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The building served as the federal governmentâs second attempt to establish a national banking institution and represented Philadelphia as the financial center of the country. The Second Bank is one of the earliest examples of Greek Revival architecture in America and helped set a precedent of this form and style of monumental design for governmental and financial buildings. The porticoes of the north and south faÃ§ades are designed in the Doric order of the Parthenon in Athens, Greece. The pediment and entablature complete with metopes and triglyphs, rest on eight marble columns at each faÃ§ade. After the Bankâs charter was not renewed in 1836, the Second Bank became the United States Bank of Pennsylvania for a brief period and later served as the U. S. Custom House until 1935. The National Park Service acquired the building in 1939 and it now serves as a gallery museum open to the public within the Independence National Historical Park. The increasing importance of the use of monumental masonry construction in American building began in the early nineteenth century with the revival of Greek classicism. White marble, cut and assembled to evoke the building prowess of the ancients, was promoted as the material of choice. The massive and easily accessible beds of Pennsylvania marble, also known as Pennsylvania or Montgomery County marble, quarried just north of the city, was an important regional building stone for public and domestic structures during the first half of the nineteenth century. Benjamin Latrobe's Bank of Pennsylvania (1798-1801-demolished) and William Strickland's Bank of the United States (1818-1824) were among the first monumental stone structures to showcase the area's famous marble. By the middle of the century the overall poor performance of the stone and improved transportation systems that increased the availability of other marbles from Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont all contributed to the demise of Pennsylvania marble as a building stone. Once a building stone acquires a record of poor weatherability and is no longer commercially viable, there usually is little motivation for continued use or testing of the material. In most cases, it is only through conservation studies of deterioration and treatment of historic buildings that information about the properties and performance of specific building materials and technologies is updated or reevaluated. In the case of Pennsylvania marble, its short-lived fame and restricted use have resulted in limited modern scientific study of its deterioration and responses to conservation treatments."
