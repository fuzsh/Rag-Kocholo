        "text": "1) Whitcomb Mansion\n\nBuilt in 1879, the Whitcomb Mansion, also known as Whitcomb House, is a high Victorian Queen Anne-style mansion. It was designed by renowned Worcester architect Stephen Earle. It served as the home of George H. Whitcomb, a leading businessman and philanthropist of the era. The mansion is one of the few surviving examples of Earle's residential designs, making it a significant architectural and historical landmark in the city.\n\nGeorge Whitcomb, originally from Templeton, Massachusetts, amassed his fortune in the envelope manufacturing industry and also engaged in extensive real estate dealings in Worcester and beyond. He was well-known for his philanthropic endeavors, particularly in the field of education across the United States. After Whitcomb's death in 1918, his mansion was bequeathed to the Society for the Blind, showcasing his lasting commitment to charitable causes.\n\nArchitecturally, the Whitcomb Mansion is an asymmetrical, polychromatic, three-story granite structure. Its front facade is divided into three sections, with the central section featuring a projecting gable-ended entry. This entryway includes a front door flanked by sidelights and topped by a half-round window, all set within a recessed archway. Above the door on the second level, a pair of windows is adorned with a decorative cast iron balcony. A carriage house with a steep slate roof and cupola stands behind the mansion, constructed from local stone.\n\nRecognizing its architectural and historical significance, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places twice: individually in 1977 as Whitcomb House and as part of a multiple resources listing in 1980 as Whitcomb Mansion.\n\n2) W. H. Goulding House\n\nThe W. H. Goulding House, built sometime before 1849, is a notable example of Greek Revival architecture. Its architectural features include a gabled roof, a clapboarded exterior, and a front facade that is three bays wide. The entrance is in the leftmost bay, adorned with sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by a transom window. A front porch, supported by fluted Doric columns, extends across the entire facade, and the corners of the building feature paneled pilasters that rise to an entablature, showcasing the Greek Revival style's characteristic details.\n\nThe house was originally constructed at 26 Harvard Street between 1847 and 1849 for Henry Goulding, a prominent local industrialist. Goulding owned some of Worcester's largest industrial enterprises and was a founder of the Worcester Mechanics' Association, a key organization in the city's industrial development. In 1850, Goulding moved the house to its present location to make way for a more opulent Italianate-style residence, reflecting the evolving architectural tastes of the period. Following the move, Goulding sold the house, which has since remained a significant piece of Worcester's architectural heritage.\n\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, the W. H. Goulding House has retained its historical and architectural integrity. The elongated ground floor windows on the front facade and the classic Greek Revival elements, such as the fluted Doric columns and paneled pilasters, contribute to its distinction as a well-preserved example of this architectural style. The house's relocation in 1850 underscores the dynamic nature of urban development in 19th-century Worcester and the aspirations of its influential residents.\n\n3) Otis Putnam House\n\nThe Otis Putnam House, constructed in 1887 and designed by the architectural firm Fuller & Delano, stands as a distinguished example of Queen Anne architecture in Worcester,. Built for Otis Putnam, a prominent local department store owner, the house is notable for its elegant design and historical significance. Putnam, originally from Leicester, rose through the ranks to become a leading partner in one of Worcester's largest department stores. He also served as a director of the local electric company and the Worcester and Holden Street Railway Company, cementing his status as a key figure in the city's economic development.\n\nThe house itself is a 2½-story brick structure set on a stone foundation, featuring a front-facing gable roof. Its roughly rectangular plan is punctuated by asymmetrical projecting sections that add to its Queen Anne charm. The east-facing front facade is particularly striking, with a two-story porch recessed under the main gable. The first-floor section of the porch projects outward, covered by a shed roof across part of its width and a gable above the granite steps, creating a welcoming entrance.\n\nThe second-floor porch, supported by turned posts set on shingled piers, features a latticework frieze that adds a delicate, decorative touch. The main gable is framed in wood and finished with shingles arranged in a wavy pattern, enhancing the textural variety typical of Queen Anne style. At the center of the gable is a projecting bay with two round-arch windows, providing a focal point that draws the eye upward. The first-floor windows are set in segmented-arch openings with brick lintels, while the second-floor windows have square openings with stone lintels, all contributing to the building’s refined aesthetic.\n\nA band of decorative brickwork serves as a frieze below the roofline, further embellishing the house's exterior. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, the Otis Putnam House has been preserved and repurposed to house offices, allowing it to remain a vibrant part of Worcester's architectural heritage.\n\n4) Jerome Marble House\n\nThe Jerome Marble House is a prime example of Second Empire architecture, designed by the noted architectural firm E. Boyden & Son and completed in 1867. This historic house stands out as one of the few in the city for which the architect is definitively known. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, the Jerome Marble House has been remarkably well-preserved and now serves as professional office space, allowing it to maintain its relevance and utility in modern times.\n\nJerome Marble, a prominent dealer in pharmaceuticals and chemicals, commissioned the house. Marble also held a significant role as a director of the Quinsigamond Bank and was involved in an ambitious, though ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to establish an excursion railroad. His residence reflects his stature and ambition, featuring the opulent and distinct characteristics of the Second Empire style, which was popular in the United States during the late 19th century.\n\nArchitecturally, the house is notable for its symmetry and the elegant detailing typical of the Second Empire style. The main facade is distinguished by polygonal bays that extend to the roof level, flanking a central entrance. This entrance is highlighted by an open porch that spans the inner front corners of the bays. Above the porch, on the second level, two narrow round-arch windows are set within a single segmented-arch opening, adding to the visual appeal. The building's corners are accented with brick quoining, providing a sturdy and decorative element to the structure.\n\nThe windows of the flanking bays are framed in rectangular openings, with stone beltcourses serving as sills and stone lintels above, enhancing the house's refined aesthetic. The distinctive mansard roof, a hallmark of the Second Empire style, is punctuated with dormers featuring various designs, including round-arch openings and windows with center-gable caps and pointed-arch windows.\n\n5) Tilley Raymond House\n\nThe Tilley Raymond House, constructed around 1847, stands as a well-preserved example of the Greek Revival side hall style. Adorned with clapboard siding and pilastered corners, the house features a front-facing gable roof and a single-story porch that extends across the front facade. Fluted Doric columns support the porch's entablature and hip roof, creating a stately entrance.\n\nBuilt by Tilley Raymond, a prominent figure in Worcester's building industry during the mid-19th century, the house exemplifies the architectural trends of its time. Alongside Horatio Tower, Raymond emerged as one of the city's leading builders in the 1840s and 1850s. After Raymond's departure for California, presumably to pursue opportunities associated with the gold rush, his son Edward assumed ownership of the house. Edward Raymond, a Civil War veteran, played significant roles in local governance, serving as the chief of police and clerk of the district court. He later pursued legal studies under George Hoar and was admitted to the bar in 1880.\n\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, the Tilley Raymond House has retained its architectural integrity and historical significance. Although converted into apartments in 1898, the house's original design elements, including the pilastered corners and fully pedimented gable, remain prominent features. Through its association with Tilley and Edward Raymond, the house reflects Worcester's growth and development during the 19th century, offering a glimpse into the lives of influential individuals who shaped the city's history.\n\n6) George Cobb House\n\nThe George Cobb House is a fine example of late Gothic Revival architecture. Built around 1875, this 2½-story wood-frame house has maintained its original character with minimal alterations, making it a well-preserved piece of architectural history. The house is distinguished by its slate hip roof, granite foundation, and clapboard siding, elements that contribute to its stately appearance.\n\nThe front facade of the George Cobb House, facing south, features a symmetrical design with three bays. It includes single-story polygonal bay windows flanking the main entrance, which is set in a slightly projecting central gabled pavilion. The entrance is protected by a porch that extends between the bay windows, supported by square columns with arched openings and a low balustrade. Above the entrance, on the second level, is a three-part round-arch window set under a stylized cap, adding to the Gothic Revival aesthetic.\n\nThe roof of the projecting section is adorned with Stick style bargeboard in the gable, flanked by gabled dormers featuring a simplified version of the same decorative detail. The windows on the side elevations are notable for their bracketed sills and lintels; the first-floor windows have lintels capped by gabled cornices, while the second-floor windows are flat. A two-story polygonal bay projects from the right side of the house, situated below a steeply pitched gable, enhancing the structure's intricate and dynamic design.\n\nOriginally occupied by George Cobb, a fish and oyster merchant, the house's architectural significance and historical context led to its listing on the National Register of Historic Places on March 5, 1980.\n\n7) Harris-Merrick House\n\nThe Harris-Merrick House, built between 1832 and 1844, stands as an enduring example of Greek Revival architecture. This 2½-story wood-frame structure, with its classic gabled roof and clapboard exterior, is a rare surviving element of the early residential development that occurred west of downtown Worcester in the 1830s. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 5, 1980, the house reflects the architectural preferences of the period and the early growth of the city's west side.\n\nOriginally located on Chestnut Street, the Harris-Merrick House is believed to have been constructed either for Clarendon Harris, a bookkeeper who bought the land in 1832, or Pliny T. Merrick, a prominent local attorney who owned the property in 1844. Merrick's adjacent home further emphasizes the area's significance during its developmental phase. In 1874, the house was relocated to its current position at the southwest corner of Fruit Street and Marston Way and converted into a two-family residence, adapting to the changing urban landscape.\n\nThe architectural details of the Harris-Merrick House highlight its Greek Revival roots. The structure's L-shaped plan features paneled pilasters at the building's corners and fully pedimented gables, typical of the style. The main facade, three bays wide, is distinguished by full-length first-story windows and an inviting main entrance situated in the rightmost bay. This entrance is sheltered by a porch with round columns, an entablature, and a fully pedimented gable, all contributing to the house's stately appearance.\n\n8) Francis Dewey House\n\nThe Francis Dewey House, designed by the esteemed Boston firm Little & Browne and built in 1912, is a notable example of architectural eclecticism. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, it is a 2½-story wood-frame structure clad in stucco, characterized by its unique curving Flemish gables that rise to urned tops at various points on each facade, lending an ornate and dynamic appearance to the building.\n\nThe house's front facade, facing south, is symmetrical and divided into five sections, with the central section slightly projecting. This central section, along with the outer sections, is topped by the Flemish gables. Each of the four sections, except for the center, features two-story polygonal projections, adding to the building's architectural complexity. The main entrance is located in the center section, sheltered by an elegant porch made of cast stone, complete with Tuscan columns, an entablature, and an upper balustrade, all of which contribute to the house's grand and stately presence.\n\nFrancis H. Dewey, the house's original owner, was a prominent lawyer and businessman. He represented the fourth generation of his family in the legal profession and served both as a judge and a railroad company executive, reflecting his significant role in the community. The house was constructed based on one of three designs submitted to Dewey, all of which shared a similar footprint. This suggests that the new structure may incorporate elements of the older house that previously stood on the property, dating back to around 1860. Dewey ultimately chose an eclectic Flemish style for his residence, while the other designs featured Colonial Revival and English Revival (Tudor) styles.\n\n9) Charles Allen House\n\nThe Charles Allen House is a historically significant residence built in 1870. This house is a notable example of Second Empire architecture, characterized by its distinctive mansard roof and elegant design. The house was commissioned by Charles Allen, a prominent Massachusetts lawyer, politician, and jurist, who played a significant role in Worcester's legal and political spheres. The property on which the house stands previously belonged to Governor Levi Lincoln, Jr. Allen orchestrated the relocation of Lincoln's original house to make room for his own residence, reflecting the high-profile nature of the individuals associated with this location.\n\nArchitecturally, the Charles Allen House is a three-story structure with a square layout, featuring a projecting ell at the rear. The front facade is distinguished by a central pavilion that slightly projects outward and rises two stories, culminating in a pedimented gable. This central feature adds depth and prominence to the building’s design. The house's main roof cornice and the cornice of the front porch are adorned with modillions, which are small, bracket-like projections that add to the decorative richness typical of Second Empire architecture. The porch, which shelters the front entry, further enhances the building's stately appearance.\n\nThe Charles Allen House is also notable for its historical context and associations. Charles Allen was a native of Worcester and had a distinguished career in law, practicing with John Davis, another Massachusetts governor. Allen's influence and status in the community are reflected in the grandeur of the house he designed. The house’s preservation and subsequent listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 highlight its architectural and historical significance."
