The conference summoned by His Majesty the Sultan to pronounce on the measures necessary to organize the police declares that the following provisions should be made:\n\nArt. 2. The police shall be under the sovereign authority of His Majesty the Sultan. It shall be recruited by the maghzen from Moorish Mohammedans, commanded by Moorish kaids, and distributed in the eight ports open to commerce.\n\nArt. 3. In order to aid the Sultan in the organization of this police, Spanish officers and noncommissioned officers as instructors, and French officers and noncommissioned officers as instructors, shall be placed at his disposal by their respective Governments, which shall submit their designation to the approval of His Shereefian Majesty. A contract drawn between the maghzen and these instructors, in conformity to the regulation provided by article 4, shall determine the conditions of their engagement and fix their pay, which must not be less than double of the pay corresponding to the rank of each officer or noncommissioned officer. In addition they will be allowed living expenses, varying according to their residences. Proper lodgings will be placed at their disposal by the maghzen, which will likewise supply them with their horses and the necessary fodder.\n\nThe Governments having jurisdiction over the instructors reserve the right to recall them and replace them by others, accepted and engaged under the same conditions.\n\nArt. 4. These officers and noncommissioned officers for a period of five years, to date from the ratification of the act of the conference, shall give their service to the organization of a body of Shereefian police. They shall assure instruction and discipline in conformity with the regulations to be drawn up in respect thereto. They shall also see that the men enlisted are fit for military service. In a general way they shall supervise the administration of the soldiers and superintend the payment of their salary, which shall be effected by the “Amin,” assisted by the accounting officer instructor. They shall extend to the Moorish authorities invested with the command of these bodies their technical aid in the exercise of the said command.\n\nThe regulations to assure the recruital, discipline, instruction, and administration of the bodies of police shall be established by mutual agreement between the Shereefian minister of war or his delegate, the inspector provided by article 7, and the highest ranking French and Spanish instructors.\n\nThe regulations shall be submitted to the diplomatic body at Tangier, which will formulate its opinion within a month’s time. After that period the regulations shall be enforced.\n\nArt. 5. The total strength of the police shall not be more than 2,500 men, nor less than 2,000. It shall be distributed, according to the importance of the ports, in groups varying between 150 and 600 men. The number of Spanish and French officers shall be between sixteen and twenty; of Spanish and French noncommissioned officers, between thirty and forty.\n\nArt. 6. The funds necessary to maintain and pay soldiers and officers and noncommissioned officer instructors shall be advanced by the state bank to the Shereefian treasury within the limits of the annual budget assigned to the police, which shall not exceed two million and a half pesetas for an effective strength of 2,500 men.\n\nArt. 7. During the same period of five years a general inspection shall be made into the working of the police. Such inspection shall be intrusted by His Shereefian Majesty to a superior officer of the Swiss army, who will be submitted to his approval by the Swiss Federal Government. This officer will be styled inspector-general, and reside at Tangier.\n\nHe shall inspect at least once a year the different bodies of the police, and after such inspection he shall draw up a report, which he will address to the maghzen.\n\nIn addition to such regular reports, he will, if he regards it as necessary, draw up special reports with reference to the working of the police.\n\nWithout directly intervening either in the command or the instruction, the inspector-general will ascertain the results obtained by the Shereefian police, as regards the maintenance of order and security in the places where this police shall have been established.\n\nArt. 8. A copy of the reports and communications made to the maghzen by the inspector-general, with reference to his mission, shall at the same time be transmitted to the dean of the diplomatic body at Tangier, in order that the diplomatic body be enabled to satisfy itself that the Shereefian police acts in conformity to the decisions taken by the conference, and to see whether it guarantees effectively, and in conformity with the treaties, the security of person and property of foreign citizens, subjects, and protégés, as well as that of commercial transactions.\n\nArt. 9. In the case of complaints filed with the diplomatic body by the legation concerned, the diplomatic body may, upon notice given to the representative of the Sultan, direct the inspector-general to investigate and report for all available purposes in the matter of such complaints.\n\nArt. 10. The inspector-general shall receive an annual salary of 25,000 francs. In addition, he will be allowed 6,000 francs for the expenses of his tours. The maghzen will place at his disposal a suitable residence and will look after the maintenance of his horses.\n\nArt. 11. The material conditions of his engagement and of his establishment, as provided by article 10, shall be the subject of a contract drawn up between him and the maghzen. A copy of this contract shall be communicated to the diplomatic body.\n\nArt. 12. The staff of instructors of the Shereefian police (officers and noncommissioned officers) shall be Spanish at Tetuan, mixed at Tangier, Spanish at Larache, French at Rabat, mixed at Casablanca, and French in the other three ports.\n\nChapter II.—Regulations concerning the detection and repression of the contraband of arms.\n\nArt. 13. Throughout the Shereefian Empire, except in the cases specified by articles 14 and 15, the importation and sale is forbidden of arms of war, parts of guns, ammunition of any nature, loaded or unloaded, powder, saltpeter, gun cotton, nitroglycerin, and all compositions destined exclusively for the manufacture of ammunition.\n\nArt. 14. Such explosives as are necessary for industry and public works may, however, be introduced. A regulation drawn up in the manner indicated by article 18 shall determine the conditions under which their importation may be effected.\n\nArt. 15. The arms, parts of guns, and ammunition intended for the troops of His Shereefian Majesty will be admitted after the fulfillment of the following formalities:\n\nA declaration signed by the Moorish minister of war, describing the number and nature of such articles ordered abroad, must be presented to the legation of the country of their origin, whose vise shall be affixed thereto.\n\nThe passage through the customs of the cases and packages containing the arms and munitions, delivered at the order of the Moorish Government, shall be effected upon the presentation:\n\n1.\n\nOf the aforesaid declaration;\n\n2.\n\nOf the invoice indicating the number and weight of the packages and the number and kind of the arms and munitions contained therein. This document must be viséed by the legation of the country of their origin, which will mark on the back the successive amounts previously passed through the customs. This visé will be refused when the order shall have been entirely delivered.\n\nArt. 16. The importation of sporting and high-priced arms, parts of guns, cartridges loaded and unloaded, is likewise forbidden. It may none the less be authorized—\n\n1.\n\nFor the strictly personal requirements of the importer;\n\n2.\n\nFor supplying the gunshops authorized by article 18.\n\nArt. 17. Sporting and high-priced arms and the ammunition for the same will be admitted for the strictly personal requirements of the importer on presentation of a permit issued by the representative of the maghzen at Tangier. If the importer is a foreigner, this permit will only be granted at the request of his legation.\n\nWith respect to ammunition for sporting purposes, each permit shall allow a maximum of a thousand cartridges or the supplies necessary for the manufacture of a thousand cartridges. The permit shall only be issued to those who have never been sentenced for any offense.\n\nArt. 18. The trade in sporting and high-priced arms, not rifled, of foreign manufacture, as well as of the ammunition appertaining to the same, shall be regulated, as soon as circumstances permit, by a Shereefian decision made in conformity with the advice of a majority of the diplomatic body at Tangier. This shall be the case, as well, with decisions intended to suspend or restrict the exercise of such trade.\n\nOnly such persons as have secured a special and temporary license from the Moorish Government shall be allowed to open and operate retail shops for the sale of sporting guns and ammunition. This license shall only be given at the written request of the applicant, indorsed by his legation.\n\nRegulations drawn up in the manner indicated by the first paragraph of this article shall determine the number of such retail shops which may be opened at Tangier and, if occasion arises, in the ports that may be later designated. They shall fix the formalities to be imposed on the importation of explosives intended for industry and public works, of arms and ammunition intended to supply such shops, as well as the maximum quantity of stock that can be kept.\n\nIn case of the violation of the regulating ordinances, the license may be temporarily or permanently withdrawn without prejudice to other penalties incurred by the offenders.\n\nArt. 19. Every introduction of, or attempt to introduce, the prohibited merchandise shall make it liable to confiscation, and further to the punishments and fines mentioned below, which shall be pronounced by the competent jurisdiction.\n\nArt. 20. The introduction or attempt to introduce in a port open to commerce, or through a custom-house, shall be punished:\n\n1.\n\nBy a fine of from 500 to 2,000 pesetas and an additional fine equal to three times the value of the imported merchandise;\n\n2.\n\nBy imprisonment of from five days to a year, or else by only one of these two punishments.\n\nArt. 21. The introduction or attempt to introduce outside a port open to commerce or a custom-house shall be punished:\n\n1.\n\nBy a fine of from 1,000 to 5,000 pesetas and an additional fine equal to three times the value of the imported merchandise;\n\n2.\n\nBy imprisonment of from three months to two years, or else by only one of these two punishments.\n\nArt. 22. The fraudulent sale, the receiving and peddling of merchandise prohibited by the present regulations shall be punished according to the penalties specified in article 20.\n\nArt. 23. The accomplices in the offenses set forth in articles 20, 21, and 22 shall be liable to the same penalties as the principals. The elements determining complicity shall be adjudged according to the laws of the court in charge of the case.\n\nArt. 24. When there is good reason to suppose that a vessel anchored in a port open to commerce carries guns, ammunition, or other prohibited merchant dise, with a view of introducing the same into Morocco, the officers of the Shereefian customs shall so inform the competent consular authority, in order that the latter may carry out, in company with a delegate of the Shereefian customs, such investigations, verifications, or searches as may be judged necessary.\n\nArt. 25. In the case of the introduction or the attempted introduction by sea of prohibited merchandise outside of a port open to commerce, the Moorish customs authorities may bring the vessel to the nearest port, to be turned over to the consular authority, who shall have the right to seize it and continue such seizure until payment of the fines decreed. The vessel may, however, be released at any period of the trial, provided that the judicial proceedings shall not be impeded thereby, on the deposit made with the consular authority of the maximum of the fine, or else under responsible bail accepted by the customs.\n\nArt. 26. The Maghzen may retain the confiscated merchandise either for its own use, if able to utilize it, on condition that the subjects of the Empire shall not be able to get possession of it, or it shall dispose of it abroad.\n\nThe conveyances of the same on shore may be confiscated and shall be sold for the profit of the Shereefian treasury.\n\nArt. 27. The sale of arms condemned by the Moorish Government shall be prohibited throughout the Shereefian Empire.\n\nArt. 28. Rewards taken out of the amount of the fines levied are to be given to the informants who have been instrumental in discovering forbidden merchandise and to the agents who have effected its seizure. Such rewards shall be assigned after deducting, if necessary, the costs of the trial, one-third to be distributed by the customs among the informants, one-third to the officers who seized the merchandise, and one-third to the Moroccan treasury.\n\nIf the seizure has been effected without the intervention of an informer one-half of the fines shall go to the officer making the seizure and the other half to the Shereefian treasury.\n\nArt. 29. The Moorish customs authorities shall notify directly the diplomatic or consular agents of any violations of this regulation, committed by those under their jurisdiction, in order that the same may be prosecuted before the proper jurisdiction.\n\nSimilar violations committed by Moorish subjects shall be submitted directly by the customs to the Shereefian authority.\n\nA delegate of the customs shall be assigned to follow the procedure of cases pending before the different jurisdictions.\n\nArt. 30. In the region bordering on Algeria, the enforcement of the regulations on the contraband of arms shall be the exclusive concern of France and Morocco.\n\nSimilarly, the enforcement of the regulation on the contraband of arms in the Riff and in general in the regions bordering on the Spanish possessions shall be the exclusive concern of Spain and Morocco.\n\nChapter III.—Act of concession for a state bank.\n\nArt. 31. A bank shall be established in Morocco under the name of the “State Bank of Morocco,” to exercise the following specified rights, which are granted to it by His Majesty the Sultan for a period of forty years, to date from the ratification of this act.\n\nArt. 32. The bank, which will have power to carry on all transactions entering into the operations of a bank, shall have the exclusive privilege of issuing notes to bearer, payable on presentation and receivable for public dues throughout the Moorish Empire.\n\nThe bank shall maintain for a period of two years, to date from its going into operation, cash on hand at least equal to half its notes in circulation, and equal to at least one-third after the expiration of said period of two years. At least one-third of such cash on hand is to be gold bullion or gold coin.\n\nArt. 33. The bank shall, to the exclusion of every other bank or establishment of credit, discharge the duty of disbursing treasurer of the Empire. To this end the Moorish Government shall take all necessary measures to deposit in the bank the proceeds of the customs revenues, exclusive of the part thereof applied to the loan of 1904, and such other revenues as it may designate.\n\nWith reference to the special tax established in order to carry out certain public works, the Moorish Government must have the same deposited in the [Page 1501] bank, as well as the revenues it may later pledge for its loans, the bank being especially charged with the payments thereon, except, however, in the case of the loan of 1904, which is governed by special contract.\n\nArt. 34. The bank shall be the financial agent of the Government both within and without the Empire, without prejudice to the Government’s right to apply to other banking houses or establishments of credit for its public loans. The bank, however, shall enjoy, in regard to such loans, a right of preference, other conditions being equal, over any banking or credit establishment.\n\nFor treasury notes or other short-term notes which the Moorish Government may wish to negotiate without making it a public issue, the bank shall, however, be charged, to the exclusion of every other establishment, with negotiating the same for the account of the Moorish Government, either in Morocco or abroad.\n\nArt. 35. The bank shall make advances to the Moroccan Government on account current up to a million francs, chargeable against treasury receipts.\n\nThe bank shall likewise open a credit account for the Government for the period of ten years, to date from its establishment, such account not to exceed two-thirds of its initial capital.\n\nThis credit account shall be distributed over several years and employed primarily for the expenses of establishing and maintaining the bodies of police, organized in conformity to the decisions adopted by the conference, and secondarily for the expenses of such works of public interest as might not be charged to the special fund as provided for by the following article:\n\nThe maximum rate for these two advances will be 7 per cent, bank commission included, and the bank may ask the Government to give as security an equal amount in treasury notes.\n\nIf before the expiration of the said term of ten years the Moorish Government should contract a loan, the bank would have the right to obtain the immediate reimbursement of its advances made in accordance with the second paragraph of the present article.\n\nArt. 36. The proceeds of the special tax (articles 33 and 66) shall form a special fund for which the bank shall keep a separate account. This fund shall be employed in conformity to the regulations adopted by the conference.\n\nIn the case of its insufficiency, and chargeable to later receipts, the bank may open a special credit for such fund, the amount of which should not exceed the total of the receipts for the previous year.\n\nThe conditions of the rate and commission shall be the same as those established by the preceding article for advances to the treasury on account current.\n\nArt. 37. The bank shall take such measures as it may deem conducive to a sounder monetary situation in Morocco. Spanish currency shall continue to be permitted to circulate as legal tender.\n\nIn consequence, the bank shall have the exclusive charge of purchasing precious metals, of striking and melting coins, as well as of all its other monetary operations for the account and profit of the Moorish Government.\n\nArt. 38. The home office of the bank shall be at Tangier, but it shall establish branches and agencies in the principal cities of Morocco or in any other place it may deem expedient.\n\nArt. 39. The land necessary for the establishment of the bank, as well as its branches and agencies in Morocco, shall be placed gratuitously at its disposal by the Government, and at the expiration of the concession the Government shall retake possession of it and reimburse the bank for the cost of building these establishments. The bank shall further be authorized to purchase such houses and land as it may require for the same purpose.\n\nArt. 40. The Shereefian Government shall insure and be responsible for the safety and protection of the bank, its branches and agencies. To this end it shall place an adequate guard at the disposal of each establishment in every city.\n\nArt. 41. The bank, its branches and agencies, shall be exempt from all imposts or dues, ordinary or extraordinary, existing or to be created. The same exemption shall be extended to real estate devoted to its use, and to the certificates and coupons of its shares and to its notes. The importation and exportation of metals and coins intended for banking operations shall be authorized and exempted from every tax.\n\nArt. 42. The Shereefian Government shall exercise its high supervision over the bank by a high commissioner, whom it shall appoint after a previous agreement with the bank’s board of directors.\n\nThis high commissioner shall have the right to examine into the management of the bank. He shall supervise the issuance of bank notes and shall see that the provisions of the concession are strictly observed.\n\nThe high commissioner shall sign every note or affix thereto his seal. He shall be charged with the supervision of the relations between the bank and the imperial treasury.\n\nHe shall take no part in the administration or transaction of the banking, business, but he shall always have the right to attend the meetings of the censors.\n\nThe Shereefian Government shall appoint one or two deputy commissioners, who shall be especially charged with the supervision of the financial transactions of the treasury with the bank.\n\nArt. 43. A set of rules defining the relations of the bank and of the Moorish Government shall be framed by the special committee provided for in article 57 and approved by the censors.\n\nArt. 44. The bank, organized with the approval of the Government of His Shereefian Majesty in the form of a corporation, shall be governed by the French law relative thereto.\n\nArt. 45. Actions instituted in Morocco by the bank shall be brought before the consular court of the defendant or before the jurisdiction of Morocco, in accordance with the rules of competence established by the Shereefian treaties and firmans.\n\nActions instituted in Morocco against the bank shall be brought before a special tribunal consisting of three consular magistrates and two associates. The diplomatic body shall, each year, arrange the list of magistrates, associates, and substitutes.\n\nThis tribunal shall apply to such cases the rules of law, procedure, and competence established by the French legislation in commercial matters. Appeals from judgments pronounced by this tribunal shall be taken to the federal court of Lausanne, whose decision shall be final.\n\nArt. 46. In case of dispute over the clauses of the concession or litigation arising between the Moorish Government and the bank, the difference shall be referred, without appeal or recourse, to the federal court of Lausanne.\n\nAll disputes arising between the shareholders and the bank in regard to the enforcement of the by-laws or by reason of the corporate business shall likewise be referred, without appeal or recourse, to the same court.\n\nArt. 47. The by-laws of the bank shall be framed on the following bases by a special committee provided for in article 57. They shall be approved by the censors and ratified by the general assembly of shareholders.\n\nArt. 48. The general constituent assembly of the corporation shall fix the place where the meetings of the shareholders and the sessions of the board of diiectors shall be held; the latter, however, shall have the faculty of meeting at any other city if it deems it expedient.\n\nThe officer of the manager of the bank shall be at Tangier.\n\nArt. 49. The bank shall be administered by a board of directors consisting of as many members as there are parts in the initial capital.\n\nThe directors shall have the most extensive powers for the administration and management of the corporation; they shall especially appoint the managers, assistant managers, and members of the commission indicated in article 54, as well as the managers of branches and agencies.\n\nThe employees of the company shall be recruited so far as possible from among the citizens, subjects, or protégés of the several powers which have taken part in subscribing the capital.\n\nArt. 50. The directors, who shall be appointed by the general assembly of shareholders, shall be nominated by the groups subscribing the capital.\n\nThe first board shall remain five years in office. At the expiration of this period, there shall be a renewal at the rate of three members annually. The order of outgoing directors shall be determined by lot; they may be reelected.\n\nOn the constitution of the corporation, each subscribing group shall have the right to nominate as many directors as it shall have subscribed entire parts, but such groups shall not be compelled to select candidates of their own nationality.\n\nThe subscribing groups shall not retain their right of nominating directors when the latter are superseded or reelected, unless they can prove that they still have in their possession at least one-half the share conferring that right upon them.\n\nIn a case where, by reason of these provisions, a subscribing group should be no longer in a position to nominate a director, the general assembly of shareholders shall make a direct nomination.\n\nArt. 51. Each of the following institutions, the Bank of the German Empire, the Bank of England, the Bank of Spain, and the Bank of France, shall, with their Government’s approval, appoint a censor for the State Bank of Morocco.\n\nThe censors shall remain in office four years. The outgoing censors may be reappointed.\n\nIn the case of death or resignation, the institution which had appointed the former incumbent shall fill the vacancy, but only for the unexpired term of the vacated office.\n\nArt. 52. The censors who shall exercise their mandate by virtue of this act of the signatory powers shall, in the interests of the latter, see that the bank in efficiently operated and insure the strict observance of the clauses of the concession and of the statutes. They shall see that the regulations governing the issuance of notes are precisely fulfilled, and shall supervise the operations tending to put the monetary situation on a sound basis, but they shall never, under any pretext, interfere in the conduct of business or in the internal administration of the bank.\n\nEach of the censors shall be empowered to examine at all times the bank accounts, and to call for information either from the board of directors or the manager’s office with regard to the management of the bank, and attend the meetings of the board of directors, but only in an advisory capacity.\n\nThe four censors shall meet at Tangier in the discharge of their duties at least once every two years, at a time to be fixed by them. Other meetings at Tangier or elsewhere may take place if three of the censors should demand it.\n\nThe four censors shall draw up in common accord an annual report, which shall be annexed to that of the board of directors. The board of directors shall transmit without delay a copy of such report to each of the governments signatory to the act of the conference.\n\nArt. 53. The censors’ emoluments and traveling expenses shall be fixed by the committee on by-laws. They shall be paid directly by the banks charged with their nomination, and the amount reimbursed to these institutions by the State Bank of Morocco.\n\nArt. 54. To assist the manager’s office a committee shall be established at Tangier, the members of which shall be chosen by the board of directors, without distinction of nationality, from among the notables residing at Tangier and holding shares of the bank.\n\nThis committee, which shall be presided over by one of the managers or assistant managers, shall give its advice on questions of discounts and opening of credit accounts.\n\nIt shall transmit a monthly report on these various subjects to the board of directors.\n\nArt. 55. The capital, of which the amount shall be fixed by the special committee designated in article 57, shall be not less than 15,000,000 francs nor more than 20,000,000 francs, and shall be of gold coin, and the shares thereof, of the value of 500 francs each, shall be inscribed with the various gold coinages at a fixed rate of exchange, as determined by the by-laws.\n\nThe said capital may thereafter be increased at one or more times by a decision of the general assembly of shareholders.\n\nThe subscription to the increased capital shall be reserved for all shareholders, without distinction of groups, in proportion to their individual holdings.\n\nArt. 56. The initial capital of the bank shall be divided into as many equal parts as there are participants among the powers represented at the conference.\n\nTo this end, each power shall designate a bank which shall exercise either for itself or for a group of banks the above-specified right of subscription, as well as the right of nomination of the directors, as provided in article 50. Any bank selected as head of a group may, with its Government’s authorization, be superseded by another bank of the same country-States wishing to avail themselves of their rights of subscription must notify such intention to the Royal Government of Spain within a period of four weeks from the signature of this act by the representatives of the powers.\n\nTwo parts, however, equal to those reserved to each of the subscribing groups, shall be assigned to the consortium of banks signatory of the contract of June 12, 1904, in compensation for the cession which shall be made by the consortium to the State Bank of Morocco:\n\n(1)\n\nOf the rights specified in article 33 of the contract;\n\n(2)\n\nOf the right inscribed in article 32 (paragraph 2) of the contract concerning the available balance of the customs receipts, with the express reservation of the general preferential right to the aggregate proceeds of customs granted to bondholders by article 11 of the same contract.\n\nArt. 57. Within a period of three weeks from the time of closing the subscriptions, notified by the Royal Government of Spain to the powers interested, a special committee composed of delegates appointed by the subscribing groups, as provided in article 50 for the appointment of directors, shall meet with a view to elaborating the by-laws of the bank.\n\nThe general constituent assembly shall meet two months after the ratification of this act.\n\nThe functions of such special committee shall cease upon the organization of the corporation.\n\nThe special committee shall fix the place of its meetings.\n\nArt. 58. No modification shall be made in the by-laws except on the motion of the board of directors and with the advice and consent of the censors and the imperial high commissioner.\n\nSuch modifications must be voted by a three-quarters majority, either present or represented, of the general assembly of sharehoulders.\n\nChapter IV.—A declaration concerning a better return of taxes and the creation of new revenues.\n\nArt. 59. As soon as the “tertib” shall have been put into regular operation with regard to Moorish subjects, the representatives of the powers at Tangier shall subject their citizens, subjects, and protégés in the Empire to the application thereof. But it is understood that this tax shall not be applied to foreign subjects except—\n\n(a)\n\nUnder the conditions stipulated by the regulation of the diplomatic body at Tangier on November 24, 1903;\n\n(b)\n\nAt places where it shall effectively be collected from Moorish subjects.\n\nThe consular authorities shall retain a certain percentage of the receipts of the taxes they collect from those subject to their jurisdiction to cover the cost of tax bills and collection.\n\nThe rate of such percentage shall be fixed by mutual agreement between the maghzen and the diplomatic body at Tangier.\n\nArt. 60. In accordance with the right granted by article 11 of the Madrid convention, foreigners shall have the right to acquire property throughout the Shereefian Empire, and His Majesty the Sultan shall issue to his administrative and judicial officers such instructions as may be necessary for them not to refuse the registration of deeds without lawful cause. Subsequent transfers, either by deeds between living parties or by death, shall continue without hindrance.\n\nIn the ports open to commerce and within a radius of 10 kilometers around such ports, His Majesty the Sultan, generally and without it being necessary henceforth for foreign subjects to obtain a special permission for each purchase of property, now grants the consent required by article 11 of the Madrid convention.\n\nAt Ksar el Kebir, Arzila, Azemour, and eventually in other towns of the coast or the interior, the general authorization stated above is likewise granted to foreigners, but only for purchasers within a radius of 2 kilometers around those towns.\n\nWherever foreigners may have acquired property they will be permitted to erect buildings in compliance with regulations and usage.\n\nBefore authorizing the execution of deeds for transferring property, the cadi will have to satisfy himself of the validity of the title in conformity to the Mohammedan law.\n\nThe maghzen shall designate in each city and district specified in this article the cadi who shall have charge of such verification.\n\nArt. 61. With a view to creating new resources for the magazines, the conference recognizes in principle that a tax may be established on city buildings.\n\nA part of the receipts thus realized shall be set aside for the requirements of municipal streets and hygiene, and generally for the expense of improvement and conservation of the cities.\n\nThe tax is due from the Moorish or foreign owner, without distinction, but the tenant or the holder of the key shall be responsible to the Moorish treasury.\n\nRegulations issued jointly by the Shereefian Government and the diplomatic body at Tangier shall establish the rate, its method of collection and application, [Page 1505] and shall determine the quota of revenue thus created which shall be devoted to the expense of improvement and conservation of the cities.\n\nAt Tangier this quota shall be turned over to the international sanitary-council, which shall decide as to its use until the creation of a municipal organization.\n\nArt. 62. His Shereefian Majesty having decided in 1901 that the Moorish officials who collect the agricultural taxes should no longer receive either the “sokhra” or the “mouna,” the conference is of the opinion that this rule should be made general, so far as is possible.\n\nArt. 63. The Shereefian delegates have stated that habou property, or certain state property, notably buildings of the maghzen, occupied at a rental of 6 per cent, are held by persons subject to foreign jurisdiction without regular title or by virtue of contracts subject to revision. The conference, desirous of remedying this state of affairs, charges the diplomatic body at Tangier to solve these two questions equitably, in accord with the special commissioner whom His Shereefian Majesty may be pleased to designate to that effect.\n\nArt. 64. The conference takes formal note of the proposition formulated by the Shereefian delegates on the subject of taxes to be created on certain trades, industries, and professions.\n\nIf as the result of the collection of such taxes from Moorish subjects the diplomatic body at Tangier should deem it advisable to extend the same to those under foreign jurisdiction, it is hereby specified that the said taxes shall be exclusively municipal.\n\nArt. 65. The conference adheres to the proposition proposed by the Moorish delegation to create, with the assistance of the diplomatic body—\n\n(a)\n\nA stamp tax on contracts and notarial acts brought before “adouls.”\n\n(b)\n\nA maximum transfer tax of 2 per cent on sales of real estate.\n\n(c)\n\nA statistical and weighing tax of a maximum of 1 per cent ad valorem on merchandise transported by coasting vessels.\n\n(d)\n\nA passport fee to be collected from Moorish subjects.\n\n(e)\n\nEventually, wharfage and light-house dues, the proceeds of which shall be devoted to harbor improvement.\n\nArt. 66. Merchandise of foreign origin shall temporarily be subject on entry into Morocco to special taxes amounting to 2 per cent ad valorem. The whole proceeds of this special tax shall form a special fund, which shall be devoted to the execution of and expenses connected with public works for the development of navigation and the general trade of the Shereefian Empire.\n\nThe programme of works and their order of priority shall be determined jointly by the Shereefian Government and the diplomatic body at Tangier.\n\nThe surveys, estimates, plans, and specifications appertaining thereto shall be made by a competent engineer, appointed by the Shereefian Government jointly with the diplomatic body. This engineer may, if necessary, be assisted by one or more assistant engineers. Their salaries shall be charged to the special fund.\n\nThe special fund will be deposited with the State Bank of Morocco, which is to keep its accounts.\n\nPublic contracts shall be awarded in the form and under the general terms prescribed by the regulations that the diplomatic body at Tangier is charged to frame, together with the representative of His Shereefian Majesty.\n\nThe board of awards shall consist of one representative of the Shereefian Government, of five delegates of the diplomatic body, and of the engineer.\n\nThe award shall be given in favor of the bidder who, in conformity with the specifications, may submit the bid offering the most advantageous general terms.\n\nAs for the sums yielded by the special tax and collected at the customs-houses in the districts specified in article 103 of the customs regulations, their expenditure will be determined upon by the Maghzen, with the consent of the neighboring power, in accordance with the clauses of this article.\n\nArt. 67. The conference, without detriment to the observations offered upon this point, expresses the wish that the export duties on the following merchandise be reduced as follows:\n\nChick-peas Per cent. Corn 20 Barley 50 Wheat 34\n\n[Page 1506]\n\nArt. 68. His Shereefian Majesty will consent to increase from six to ten thousand the number of head of cattle of the bovine species which each power shall have the right to export from Morocco. Such exportation may be effected through any custom-house. If by misfortune there should be a scarcity of cattle in any particular district His Shereefian Majesty shall have the right to temporarily forbid the exportation of cattle through the port or ports of that district. Such measure shall not exceed two years; nor shall it be applied at the same time to all the ports of the Empire.\n\nIt is further understood that the preceding provisions do not modify the other conditions for the exportation of cattle as fixed by previous firmans.\n\nThe conference expresses the additional wish that a veterinary inspection be organized as soon as possible at the seaports.\n\nArt. 69. In accordance with the previous decisions of His Shereefian Majesty, and notably the decision of September 28, 1901, the transportation is allowed by coasting vessels, between all ports of the Empire, of cereals ‘grains, vegetables, fruits, eggs, poultry, and in general of merchandise and animals of every kind, of Moroccan origin or not, except horses, donkeys, and camels, for which a special permit from the Maghzen will be necessary. Such coasting trade may be carried on by vessels of every nationality without such articles being subjected to payment of the export duties, but subject to the special taxes and regulations relative thereto.\n\nArt. 70. The rate of sojourn and anchorage dues levied on ships in Moorish ports being fixed by treaties with certain powers, the said powers are disposed to consent to a revision of such dues. The diplomatic body at Tangier is therefore charged to effect an agreement with the Maghzen on the terms of such revision, which can not, however, take place until after the improvement of the ports.\n\nArt. 71. The customs storage dues shall be collected in all Moorish ports where there are adequate warehouses, in conformity to the regulations existing or to be adopted in regard thereto by the Government of His Shereefian Majesty in accord with the diplomatic body at Tangier.\n\nArt. 72. Opium and kiff will continue to be a monopoly of the Shereefian Government. The importation of opium specially intended for medicinal purposes will, however, be allowed by special permit issued by the Maghzen at the request of the legation, the physician, or apothecary importing the same. The Shereefian Government and the diplomatic body shall jointly determine the maximum quantity which may be thus introduced.\n\nArt. 73. The representatives of the powers take note of the Shereefian Government’s intention to extend to tobacco of all kinds the monopoly existing in the case of snuff. They reserve the right of their citizens, subjects, and protégés to be duly indemnified for damages which the said monopoly may cause such of them as carry on a tobacco business established under the present system. In case no amicable agreement shall be reached, the damages shall be fixed by experts designated by the Maghzen and the diplomatic body, in conformity with the provisions governing expropriation for public purposes.\n\nArt. 74. The principle of awarding contracts on bids without preference of nationality shall be applied to the farming of the monopoly of opium and kiff. The same rule would apply to the tobacco monopoly, if created.\n\nArt. 75. If the occasion should arise to modify any of the provisions of this declaration, the Maghzen and the diplomatic body at Tangier shall reach an understanding on this point.\n\nArt. 76. In all the cases provided for by the present declaration whore the diplomatic body shall be called upon to intervene, except in what concerns articles 64, 70, and 75, the decision shall be reached by a majority of the votes.\n\nChapter V.—A regulation concerning the customs of the empire and the repression of fraud and smuggling.\n\nArt. 77. Every captain of a merchantman coming from a foreign or a Moorish port shall, within twenty-four hours after having been granted free pratique in any of the ports of the Empire, deposit at the customs an exact copy of his manifest, signed by him and certified to by the vessel’s consignee. He shall furthermore, if required to do so, produce before the customs authorities the original of his manifest.\n\nThe customs shall have power to station one or more watchmen on board to prevent illicit trade.\n\nArt. 78. The following are exempt from depositing the manifest:\n\n1.\n\nMen-of-war or ships chartered for the account of a power.\n\n2.\n\nBoats belonging to private individuals for their personal use and never carrying any merchandise.\n\n3.\n\nBoats or craft used for shore fisheries.\n\n4.\n\nYachts intended only as pleasure boats and registered as such at their home ports.\n\n5.\n\nShips especially charged with laying down and repairing telegraphic cables.\n\n6.\n\nBoats exclusively used in life-saving service.\n\n7.\n\nHospital ships.\n\n8.\n\nTraining ships of the merchant marine not engaged in commercial operations.\n\nArt. 79. The manifest deposited at the customs shall state the nature and origin of the cargo, with the marks and numbers of the cases, bales, bundles, casks, etc.\n\nArt. 80. If there is serious reason to suspect the accuracy of the manifest, or in case the captain of the ship should refuse to allow the visit and verifications of customs officers, the case shall be brought to the attention of the proper consular authority, in order that the latter, in company with a delegate of the Shereefian customs, shall undertake the investigations, visits, and verifications that he may judge necessary.\n\nArt. 81. If after twenty-four hours, as stated in article 77, the captain has not deposited his manifest, he shall incur, unless the delay be a case of vis major, a fine of 150 pesetas for each day’s delay: Provided, however, That the fine shall not exceed 600 pesetas. If the captain has fraudulently presented an inaccurate or incomplete manifest, he shall be personally condemned to pay a sum equal to the value of the merchandise for which he has failed to produce the manifest, and a fine of from 500 to 1,000 pesetas, and the vessel and merchandise shall be further liable to seizure by consular authority as security for such fine.\n\nArt. 82. Any person about to pass through the customs merchandise imported or intended for exportation shall file in the custom-house a detailed statement setting forth the nature, quality, weight, number, measurement, and value of the merchandise, as well as the nature, marks, and numbers of the packages containing the same.\n\nArt. 83. If there should be found at the time of the visit fewer packages or less merchandise than declared, the declarant, unless able to prove that he has acted in good faith, shall pay double duties for the missing merchandise, and the merchandise presented shall be retained in the customs as security for such double duty. If, on the contrary, there should be found at the time of the visit an excess of packages, or quantity, or weight of the merchandise, this excess shall be seized and confiscated for the benefit of the Maghzen, unless the person making the declaration can prove his good faith.\n\nArt. 84. If the declaration should be found inaccurate as to kind or quality, and the declarant is unable to prove his good faith, the merchandise wrongly declared shall be seized and confiscated by the proper authority for the benefit of the Maghzen.\n\nArt. 85. If the declaration should be found inaccurate as to the declared value, and the declarant should be unable to prove his good faith, the customs may either levy the duty in kind, then and there, or, if the merchandise is indivisible, take the said merchandise by at once paying to the declarant its declared value plus 5 per cent.\n\nArt. 86. If the declaration should be found false as to the nature of the merchandise the latter shall be considered as not having been declared, and the offense shall fall under articles 88 and 90 hereinbelow, and shall be punished by the penalties provided for in the said articles.\n\nArt. 87. The smuggling, flagrant or attempted, in or out of the country, by land or by sea, of merchandise subject to duty shall be punishable by confiscation of the merchandise, without prejudice to the penalties and fines hereinbelow, which shall be imposed by the proper jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, the conveyances on shore shall be seized and confiscated when smuggled goods form the greater part of the load.\n\nArt. 88. The smuggling, flagrant or attempted, in or out of the country, through a port open to commerce or through a custom-house, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed triple the value of the merchandise so smuggled and by imprisonment of from five days to six mouths, or by only one of these penalties.\n\nArt. 89. The smuggling, flagrant or attempted, in or out of the country, outside of a port open to commerce or of a custom-house, shall be punished by [Page 1508] a fine of from 300 to 500 pesetas, and by an additional fine equal to three times the value of the merchandise, or by imprisonment of from a month to a year.\n\nArt. 90. The accomplices in offenses as provided by articles 88 and 89 shall be liable to the same penalties as the principals. The elements constituting complicity shall be adjudged according to the law of the tribunal in charge of the case.\n\nArt. 91. In the case of smuggling, flagrant or attempted, in or out of the country, by a vessel outside of a port open to commerce, the Moorish customs shall have the right to take such vessel to the nearest port, to be turned over to the consular authority, and the said authority may seize and detain the vessel until it shall have paid the amount of the penalties imposed.\n\nThe vessel shall be released at any stage of the action, in so far as the preliminary judicial proceedings are not impeded thereby, upon deposit made with the consular authority of the maximum of the fine, or else under responsible bail accepted by the customs.\n\nArt. 92. The provisions of the preceding articles are also applicable to coasting vessels.\n\nArt. 93. Such merchandise as is not subject to an export duty, shipped in a Moorish port to be transported by sea to some other port in the Empire, shall be accompanied by a certificate issued by the customs, under penalty of being subjected to the payment of import duties, and even of being confiscated, if not entered in the manifest.\n\nArt. 94. The transportation by coasting vessels of products subject to export duties can only be effected by depositing at the custom-house of the port of departure the amount of export duties on such merchandise and taking receipt therefor.\n\nThis money shall be returned to the depositor by the custom-house where it was deposited, on production of a declaration on which the customs certify the arrival of such merchandise and of the receipt for the deposit of the amount of the duties. The documents proving the arrival of the merchandise shall be produced within three months from the time of shipment. After this term, unless the delay be a case of vis major, the amount deposited shall become the property of the Maghzen.\n\nArt. 95. The import and export duties shall be paid cash at the custom-house where liquidation has been made. The ad valorem duties shall be liquidated according to the cash wholesale value of the merchandise delivered in the custom-house and free from customs duties and storage dues. Damages to the merchandise, if any, shall be taken into account in appraising the depreciation thereby caused. Merchandise can only be removed after the payment of customs duties and storage.\n\nThe holding of the goods or the collection of duty shall, in every case, be made the subject of a regular receipt delivered by the oflicer in charge.\n\nArt. 96. The value of the chief articles of merchandise dutiable in the Moorish customs is to be appraised every year under the conditions specified in the foregoing article by a committee on customs valuations, meeting at Tangier, and consisting of—\n\n1.\n\nThree members appointed by the Moorish Government.\n\n2.\n\nThree members appointed by the diplomatic body at Tangier.\n\n3.\n\nOne delegate of the State Bank.\n\n4.\n\nOne agent of the delegation of the 5 per cent Moroccan loan of 1904.\n\nThis committee shall appoint from twelve to twenty honorary members resident in Morocco, whom it shall consult when called to determine the value, and whenever it may see fit. These honorary members shall be selected from the lists of notables drawn up in the case of foreign subjects by each legation, and in the case of Moors by the Sultan’s representative. They shall be appointed as far as possible in proportion to the importance of the commerce of each nation.\n\nThe committee shall be appointed for the term of three years.\n\nThe schedule of values fixed by it shall serve as a basis for the appraisals which the administration of Moorish customs shall make in every custom-house. It shall be posted at all custom-houses and in the chanceries of the legations and consulates at Tangier.\n\nThe schedule may be revised at the end of six months in case of considerable changes in the values of certain articles.\n\nArt. 97. A permanent committee, to be known as the “Committee of customs,” shall be organized at Tangier and appointed for a term of three years. [Page 1509] It shall consist of a special commissioner of His Shereefian Majesty, of a member of the diplomatic or consular body appointed by the diplomatic body at Tangier, and of a delegate from the State Bank. It shall be empowered to add to its members, in an advisory capacity, one or more representatives of the customs service.\n\nThis committee shall exercise its high supervision over the customs service, and shall have the right to propose to His Shereefian Majesty such measures as are likely to effect improvement in the service and assure the regularity and supervision of operations and collections (landing, shipping, land transportation, handling, the incoming and outgoing of merchadise, storage, appraisal, liquidation, and collection of duties). The creation of such a committee of customs shall in no way infringe the rights stipulated in favor of the bondholders by articles 15 and 16 in the loan contract of June 12, 1904.\n\nInstructions to be drawn up by the committee of customs and the services interested therein shall determine the details of the enforcement of article 96 and of the present article. They shall be submitted to the advice and consent of the diplomatic body.\n\nArt. 98. In custom-houses where sufficient warehouses exist the customs service shall take charge of the disembarked merchandise as soon as it is turned over by the captain of the vessel to the officers in charge of the lighterage, who shall receipt therefor, and until such time as it shall have been regularly cleared from the customs. The customs service is responsible for injuries caused by loss of or damage to merchandise which may be imputed to the fault or negligence of its officers. It is not responsible for damages resulting either from the natural decay of merchandise, or from too lengthy a storage in the warehouse, or from cases of vis major.\n\nIn custom-houses where there are not sufficient warehouses the agents of the maghzen are required only to employ such means of preservation as may be at the disposal of the custom-house.\n\nA revision of the storage regulations now in force shall be made under the direction of the diplomatic body, whose decisions shall be taken by a majority vote, in concert with the Shereefian Government.\n\nArt. 99. Confiscated merchandise and conveyances shall be sold under direction of the customs service within eight days from the date of final judgment rendered by the competent tribunal.\n\nArt. 100. The net proceeds of the sale of confiscated merchandise and articles become the final property of the state; as to pecuniary fines and compromises thereof, the amount, after deduction of costs of all kinds, shall be divided between the Shereefian treasury and those who have participated in the repression of fraud or smuggling:\n\nOne-third to be distributed by the customs among the informants,\n\nOne-third to the officers who have seized the goods,\n\nOne-third to the Moorish treasury.\n\nIf the seizure has been made without the intervention of an informant, one-half the fine shall be awarded to the officers making the seizure and the other half to the Moorish treasury.\n\nArt. 101. The Moorish customs authorities shall directly inform the diplomatic or consular agents of any violations of this regulation which may have been committed by those under their jurisdiction, in order that they may be prosecuted before the competent court.\n\nSimilar violations by Moorish subjects shall be brought directly by the customs before the Shereefian authority.\n\nA delegate of the customs shall be charged to follow the legal proceedings in cases pending before the several jurisdictions.\n\nArt. 102. Every confiscation, flue, or penalty must be imposed on foreigners by consular jurisdiction, and on Moorish subjects by Shereefian jurisdiction.\n\nArt. 103. In the region bordering on Algeria the enforcement of these regulations shall be the exclusive concern of France and Morocco.\n\nThe enforcement of these regulations in the Riff and in general in the regions bordering on the Spanish possessions shall likewise be the exclusive concern of Spain and Morocco.\n\nArt. 104. The provisions of the present regulations, other than those relating to penalties, may be revised by unanimous decision of the diplomatic body at Tangier and in accord with the Maghzen, at the expiration of a term of two years from the date of their taking effect.\n\n[Page 1510]\n\nChapter VI.—A declaration relative to public services and public works.\n\nArt. 105. With a view to assuring the application of the principle of economic liberty without any inequality, the signatory powers declare that none of the public services of the Shereefian Empire can bealienated for the advantage of private interests.\n\nArt. 106. In case the Shereefian Government should invoke the aid of foreign capital or foreign industry for the working of public services or for the operation of public works, roads, railways, ports, telegraphs, and other public works, the signatory powers reserve to themselves the right to see to it that the authority of the state over these great enterprises of general interest remains entire.\n\nArt. 107. The validity of the concessions which may be made under the terms of article 106, as well as for government supplies, shall, throughout the Shereefian Empire, be subordinated to the principle of public awards on proposals, without preference of nationality, whenever applicable under the rules followed in foreign laws.\n\nArt. 108. As soon as the Shereefian Government shall have decided to invite proposals for execution of public works, it shall so inform the diplomatic body. It shall later communicate to it the plans, specifications, and all documents annexed to the call for proposals, in order to enable the nationals of all the signatory powers to form a clear idea of the contemplated works and compete for the same. A sufficient term for this shall be specified in the call for proposals.\n\nArt. 109. The specifications shall not contain, either directly or indirectly, any condition or provision which may be prejudicial to free competition and which may give advantage to competitors of one nationality over those of another nationality.\n\nArt. 110. The contracts shall be awarded in the form and according to the general conditions prescribed by the regulations which the Shereefian Government shall draw up with the assistance of the diplomatic body.\n\nThe contracts shall be awarded by the Shereefian Government to the bidder who, while conforming himself to the specifications, shall have submitted the bid fulfilling the most advantageous general conditions.\n\nArt. 111. The rules of articles 106 to 110 shall be applied to concessions for working cork forests, in accordance with the customary provisions in foreign laws.\n\nArt. 112. A Shereefian firman shall determine the conditions of the concession and the working of mines and quarries. In the composition of this firman the Shereefian Government shall be guided by foreign laws relating to such matters.\n\nArt. 113. If in the cases mentioned in articles 106 to 112 it should become necessary to occupy certain property, its expropriation may be effected by previous payment of a fair indemnity, in conformity to the following rules:\n\nArt. 114. Expropriation can only be effected on the ground of public utility, and when necessity for the same shall have been ascertained by an administrative investigation, the formalities of which shall be determined by Shereefian regulations drawn up with the assistance of the diplomatic body.\n\nArt. 115. If the property holders are Moorish subjects, His Shereefian Majesty shall take the necessary measures that no hindrance shall impede the execution of works that he shall have declared to be of public utility.\n\nArt. 116. If the owners are foreigners, the method of expropriation shall be as follows:\n\nIn case of disagreement between the competent administration and the owner of the property to be expropriated, the indemnity shall be fixed by a special jury, or, if the occasion arises, by arbitration.\n\nArt. 117. This jury shall be composed of six expert appraisers, three to be selected by the owner, three by the administration desiring to expropriate. A majority vote shall rule.\n\nIf there be no majority, the owner and the administration shall each appoint an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators shall name an umpire.\n\nIn case no agreement can be reached in selecting an umpire, he shall be appointed by the diplomatic body at Tangier.\n\nArt. 118. The arbitrators shall be selected from a list drawn up at the beginning of each year by the diplomatic body, and they shall be selected, as far as possible, from experts not living within the district in which the work is to be carried out.\n\nArt. 119. The owner may appeal from the arbitrators’ decision to a competent jurisdiction, and in accordance with the rules set for arbitration cases by the law of the country to which he belongs.\n\nChapter VII.—General provisions.\n\nArt. 120. With a view to harmonizing its legislation, if the occasion arises, with the engagements contracted under the present general act, each of the signatory powers engages to take the necessary steps leading to the enactment of such legislation as may be necessary so far as it is concerned.\n\nArt. 121. The present general act shall be ratified according to the constitutional laws of each state. The ratifications shall be deposited at Madrid as soon as practicable, and at the latest by December 31, 1906.\n\nA procès verbal shall be made of such deposit and a certified copy sent to each of the signatory powers through the diplomatic channel.\n\nArt. 122. The present general act shall enter into effect as soon as all the ratifications shall have been deposited, and at the latest on December 31, 1906.\n\nIn case the special legislative measures which may be necessary in certain countries to insure the application to their nationals living in Morocco of certain stipulations of this present general act shall not have been enacted by the date fixed for ratification, these stipulations shall only become applicable in respect to them after the legislative measures above referred to shall have been promulgated.\n\nArt. 123, and last. All treaties, conventions, and arrangements of the signatory powers with Morocco remain in force. It is understood, however, that in case of conflict between their provisions and those of the present general act the stipulations of the latter shall prevail.\n\nIn faith whereof the delegates plenipotentiary have signed the present general act and have affixed their seals thereto.\n\nDone at Algeciras this 7th day of April, 1906, in a single copy, which shall remain deposited in the archives of the Government of His Catholic Majesty, and of which certified copies shall be transmitted through the diplomatic channel to the signatory powers.\n\nFor Germany: [l. s.] Joseph de Radowitz.
