        "text": "Algeciras\n\nSpain\n\nAlgeciras, port city, Cádiz provincia (province), in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Andalusia, in extreme southern Spain, across the Bay of Gibraltar from Gibraltar.\n\nThe port, at the mouth of the Río de la Miel, was founded in 713 by Moors and is probably on the site of the Roman Portus Albus; its Arabic name, Al-Jazīrah al-Khaḍrāʾ, means Green Island, in reference to the offshore Isla Verde. The port was taken by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1344 and then was recaptured and destroyed in 1368 by the Moors. It was refounded in 1704 by Spanish refugees from Gibraltar and in 1760 was rebuilt by Charles III on its present rectangular plan. The Algeciras Conference was held in 1906 in the Casa Consistorial (Town Hall).\n\nThe city’s main commercial activity is connected with the port, which is a stopping place for transatlantic shipping (mainly oil imports). The port also provides ferry service for passengers traveling to and from Tangier and other ports in Morocco. Tourism, based on the mild winter climate, is growing. Algeciras has a petrochemical refinery, as well as ice-making and preserving plants. Fishing and fish salting are important. Local agricultural products include cereals, tobacco, hogs, and cattle. Pop. (2007 est.) mun., 114,012.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica This article was most recently revised and updated by Amy Tikkanen."
