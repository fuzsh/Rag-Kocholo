        "text": "HOW TOREACH THE PORT\n\nYou can access the port of Algeciras by car, bus, train or on foot.\n\nThe port of Algeciras is situated in the city center, so it is within walking distance from the Old Town and easily accessible through the central entrance -Paco de Lucia-\n\nThere are two accesses by car to the Port of Algeciras -North and South-. The most recommended if you are approaching Algeciras via the A7 highway is the North access, through which you can directly access the port without crossing the city. The Southern access is recommended if you are already inside the city or are accessing it from Tarifa.\n\nThe bus station is located 800 meters from the Port of Algeciras, just a 10-minute walk away. In addition, there is a taxi stop at the bus station to quickly get to the port.\n\nThe train station is next to the bus station. So, if you're planning to arrive at the port from the train station, the best choice is to walk for about 800 meters or take a taxi instead.\n\n! USEFUL PRE-EMBARKATION INFORMATION\n\nDue to our compliance with the security regulations of the ISPS (International Ship and Port Facility Security) code, all passengers are required to proceed to the embarkation area at least two (2) hours prior to the scheduled departure time of the vessel.\n\nPassengers with vehicles are required to proceed to the embarkation area at least two (2) hours prior to the vessel's scheduled departure. All passengers are required to present their boarding card and a valid passport or ID to the Vessel's authorized personnel.\n\nThe Company reserves the Company's rights to deny embarkation to any individual who, according to the best of Company's knowledge, does not appear to possess valid travel documents or fails to prove, beyond a doubt, his/her identity. In the event of a fine being imposed on the Company by the immigration office, the amount will be charged to the passenger who failed to provide the proper legal documents."
