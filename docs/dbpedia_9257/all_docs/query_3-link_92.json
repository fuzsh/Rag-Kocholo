The city is separated from Spain by the Strait of Gibralta and is located along the boundary between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nVisitor attractions in the city include the Royal Walls which are a system of coastal defences and the Mediterranean Maritime Park which covers an area of some 56,000 sq. m and is home to two salt water lakes, solariums and gardens. In the middle of the park there is a castle which was inspired by the city walls of Ceuta. The park also contains a casino, restaurant and nightclub with a marina located alongside the park.\n\nThe city's port receives a large number of ferries each day, mostly from Algeciras in Andalucia in the south of Spain. There is a bus service throughout the city which does not pass into neighbouring Morocco.\n\nAlgeciras Guide\n\nThe Spanish port city of Algeciras is located in the south of the country and lies on the shores of the Bay of Gibralta. The city has a long maritime history but today is a modern and cosmopolitan city that is aided by its important position between two continents (Europe and Africa) and its large port. The first settlement on the site of the present city was the Roman town of Iulia Traducta, from the 1st century AD. Later in 711, Tarik founded Al-Yazirat-al-Hadra (Green Island) on the Roma ruins.\n\nThere are a number of popular visitor attractions and important monuments at Plaza Alta in the city, including the Parochial Church of Nuestra Senora de la Palma and the small Chapel of Nuestra Senora de Europa. The city's architecture is quite lovely and good examples include the City Hall, the Market Place, the Chapel of Santo Cristo de la Alameda and the Chapel of San Anton.\n\nThe city's port is located around 20 km to the north east of Tarifa on the Rio de la Miel, Europe's most southerly river. Visitors travelling out of the port should keep an eye open for wales and dolphins which can sometimes be seen in the waters outside the port."
