        "text": "Territory\n\nStrategic location\n\nAlgeciras Bay is located in the southernmost part of the Iberian Peninsula and Andalusia, southeast of the Cadiz province. Its border position, between Europe and Africa, and its location amid the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, makes the region one of Europe's strategic areas.\n\nThe territory around the Algeciras Bay, is the region of Campo de Gibraltar, composed of seven municipalities: Algeciras, Los Barrios, La Línea de la Concepción and San Roque, located in the arc forming the Algeciras Bay, together with Tarifa, oriented towards the Atlantic Ocean, and Castellar de la Frontera and Jimena de la Frontera, both inland.\n\nDemography\n\nWith a population of about 265,000 people, the towns of Algeciras, La Linea, San Roque and Los Barrios, are the largest populations (in this order) and account for 88% of the inhabitants of the region.\n\nCommunication Infrastructure\n\nCommunication is a key element in the development of the area of Algeciras Bay. Its potential as a reference area for the industry and logistics activities depends on them.\n\nAerial: You can access the area by the Spanish airports of Jerez, Seville and Malaga, or Gibraltar Airport in Gibraltar (UK territory).\n\nMaritime: Algeciras and Tarifa ports offer excellent communications, infrastructure and services for both passengers and goods.\n\nRoad: The region of Campo de Gibraltar is communicated to the east by the A-7 and to the west towards the city of Cadiz by the N-340 (E-5 in the future once the construction of the section between Vejer and Algeciras is complete). It is connected to Jerez and Seville by the A-381. The A-405 communicates the municipalities in the bay with those inland towards the Serranía de Ronda.\n\nRailway: The railway line Algeciras-Bobadilla enables the transit of people and goods from the stations in Algeciras, Los Barrios, San Roque-La Linea, Castellar de la Frontera, Jimena and San Pablo de Buceite towards the interior of the Iberian Peninsula. By this route circulate trains with different destinations such as Granada, Malaga, Seville and Madrid, either directly or with a transfer at Bobadilla.\n\nThe Infrastructure and Transport Strategic Plan from the Ministry of Public Works includes the Bobadilla-Algeciras railway line as one of the elements to modernize and adapt to the high-speed trains, improving communications from Algeciras to Europe.\n\nIndustry\n\nThe current industry situation in the area of the Algeciras Bay has as a starting point the establishment of the Campo de Gibraltar as Preferred Location for Industrial Area in 1966. Since then, the installation of an industrial centre began, that has favoured the creation of an important subsidiary industrial sector around a cluster of large industries which form the first industrial hub of Andalusia and the second of Spain. Most of these companies are grouped by the association of large Industries of the Campo de Gibraltar (AGI, by the acronym in Spanish), which promotes and coordinates the efforts of its partners in order to defend their common interests and actively contributes to the development and improvement of the area.\n\nPort facilities\n\nThe unique strategic location of the Algeciras Bay, with favourable shelter and depth of water, and excellent facilities, have led to the development of the Algeciras Port. The progress achieved is shown by its position among other ports, leading the Spanish port system and fifth of the European Union, after Rotterdam, Antwerp, Hamburg and Amsterdam.\n\nOrganizations which promote development in the Algeciras Bay\n\nThe presence of these entities favours the development of infrastructure and services in the region, promotes relationships and synergies between companies and contributes to promote the area at an international level.\n\nThe main organizations in the Algeciras Bay are:"
