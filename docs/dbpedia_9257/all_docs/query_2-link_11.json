        "text": "Algeciras - The Armpit of Iberia\n\nTuesday, April 21, 2015\n\nAlgeciras, Andalusia, Spain and Canary Islands\n\nThe western terminus of the rail line I have been following\n\nfor the last week is Algeciras on the sea at the Strait of Gibraltar . Algeciras\n\nis one of Europe’s largest container ports and the main port for crossing the\n\nstrait to Morocco. In 2007 on my West Africa trip with Dragoman we boarded a\n\nferry to Ceuta, one of Spain’s two port towns in North Africa, in Algeciras. I\n\nsaw nothing of the town, though.\n\nThe rail journey from Ronda to Algeciras is a very scenic\n\none through mountains and valleys, all very green in late April. It looks much\n\nmore like northern Europe now than what I usually think of as the landscape in\n\nSpain. The books say the rail line from Algeciras to Ronda was actually built\n\nby the British in the late nineteenth century to enable the forces in Gibraltar\n\nto access the cooler mountain regions for rest and relaxation in the sweltering\n\nsummers.\n\nI chose to book a cheap room in a pension near the rail and\n\nbus stations for 16 Euros/night because it made for easy transport connections\n\nfrom Ronda, for a day trip to Gibraltar, and onwards to Cadiz . When I arrived I\n\nwondered if one of the tunnels on the rail journey might have whisked me under\n\nthe Strait to Africa. Algeciras absolutely feels like a developing country\n\nrather than part of Europe.\n\nI’ve traveled a lot and stayed in some pretty skanky places,\n\nso a cheap basic room in a town like Algeciras doesn’t bother me. But after all\n\nthe interesting and appealing and beautiful places I’ve travelled through over\n\nthe last five weeks, this has to be a low point. I can laugh about it because\n\nit’s costing me next to nothing and enabling me easy access to Gibraltar, but\n\nthis is one of the saddest and ugliest towns I’ve been to in a long time. As I\n\nwalked through the streets there were a fair number of restaurants and tapas bars\n\nand OK buildings; it’s not exactly the pit of hell but……am I still in Europe?\n\nI like to buy some beer or wine in a shop to consume in my\n\nroom most evenings as I’m blogging away. I’m well past the age where going out\n\nto a bar or clubbing has any appeal to me . But in Algeciras most of the small\n\nstores are owned by members of large Muslim population from North Africa and\n\ndon’t sell alcohol. Well, if your Allah doesn’t let you sell alcohol, I’m just\n\ngoing to take all my business and everything I was planning to buy to a store\n\nthat does! Fortunately, all over Spain there are Chinese-owned stores, and in\n\nAlgeciras the Chinese do sell beer and wine.\n\nThe morning bus ride to La Linea, the town on the Spanish\n\nside of the border with Gibraltar, was gray and misty, but the whole distance\n\naround the bay was in a very industrialized urbanization with big chemical\n\nplants and tall smokestacks ringing the Bay of Algeciras. The Costa del Sol of\n\nresort developments that’s Europe’s Florida may spread eastward from Gibraltar\n\nall the way to Malaga, but the arc around the bay to Gibraltar’s west to\n\nAlgeciras is majorly industrial and not very attractive. Hey, though, places\n\nlike that are what help make the world go around; not everywhere can be perfect\n\nand prettified."
