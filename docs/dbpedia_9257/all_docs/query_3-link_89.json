        "text": "During the Cold War and before easy access to high-resolution satellite imagery, the Soviet Military was secretly mapping the entire world. These aesthetically striking maps are beautiful down to the last detail and fantastic wall art and until now, have rarely been viewed or available to outsiders.\n\nThis series has been covered by Wired Magazine and Greg Miller in his book, All Over the Map: A Cartographic Odyssey. This map is part of the Soviet City Plans Series presented by East View, which has the largest collection of Soviet Military City Plans in the world.\n\nThe Soviet Military City Plan(s) of Algeciras (Spain) is one in a series of highly detailed topographic city maps developed by the USSR Ministry of Defense during the Cold War era. These collectable, high resolution print-on-demand editions are delivered on premium, acid-free, matte paper. This item is sheet number 1 in a set of 1 sheet(s) for Algeciras"
