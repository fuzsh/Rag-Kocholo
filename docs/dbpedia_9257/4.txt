It is populated from the Lower Paleolithic, and has been an area of ​​settlement of Phoenician and Carthaginian colonies. The first city that existed at the site that occupies the current city was the Roman Iulia Traducta (1st century AD).

In the year 711 on these ruins, Tarik, commanding his troops, founded Al-Yazirat-al-Hadra (“Green Island”). Capital of a province and kingdom of a taifa, it was destroyed in the late fourteenth century. The important Villa Nueva de Algeciras site, the Marinid Baths, the Royal Baths of al-Binya and the Marinid city of Algeciras that are exhibited in the María Cristina Park are preserved from its medieval time.

A unique cultural and natural heritage

The Plaza Alta, the social centre of the city, houses important monuments such as the Parish Church of Nuestra Señora de la Palma and the small Chapel of Nuestra Señora de Europa. The heritage of Algeciras is completed with the Town Hall, the Food Market, the Chapel of Santo Cristo de la Alameda and the Chapel of San Antón, which forms a beautiful complex with the Hospital de la Caridad.

Many of the tourist attractions of Algeciras are its beaches, among which El Rinconcillo Beach stands out. Located in the interior of the Bay, 3 kilometres away from the city centre, it extends to the mouth of the Palmones River. Or that of San García and Getares, 4 kilometres away from the city towards the Punta Carnero lighthouse. In fact, it is very interesting to visit the Ensenada de Getares, a valuable natural and scenic environment consisting of attractive cliffs and a splendid beach, formed by the contributions of the Pícaro river and the Marchenilla and Lobo streams. It is also a wonderful point of observation of birds and cetaceans.
