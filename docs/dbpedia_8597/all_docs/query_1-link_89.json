        "text": "Thierry Henry has two Arsenal fears for Champions League quarter-final draw\n\nArsenal legend Thierry Henry has named two teams who Mikel Arteta's men will be desperate to avoid in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final.\n\nHenry, who watched the Gunners beat Porto at the Emirates Stadium, has insisted that there will be no easy draw from this point in the competition. Speaking on CBS Sports, he said: “I’ve been in both situations as a player where sometimes people didn’t want to play us with Arsenal and we didn’t go really far, and we had a team when we went to the final I don’t think was our best team at Arsenal.\n\n“I remember when we drew Real Madrid everyone laughed because they said, ‘Arsenal are the team you want’, and we got Juve and everyone said, ‘that’s a good draw for Juve’, then we played Villarreal, who were a good team at the time, then they said, ‘it’s good to play Arsenal’, then obviously we couldn’t win the final. “I’m just saying, you can never disrespect anyone in Europe.\n\n“There are two teams there who can be cocky – it’s Real Madrid and Man City, that’s about it. The others, you just take who you can play.\n\n“Man City are the team to beat still, for me. I know Pep, it’s not how he’s going to take it, I was just putting it out there. Me as a player, I’ve been in too many situations to know that sometimes the so-called team who was easy to play against is not the case, you arrive and people think, ‘you’re going to win it easy’, no, that’s not really the case.\n\n“So the champions can talk – Man City – and then Real Madrid, we already know they have 14, other than that, let’s see what’s going to happen.”\n\nMan City suffer Kevin De Bruyne blow\n\nKevin De Bruyne will miss Manchester City’s FA Cup quarter-final against Newcastle on Saturday with a minor groin injury.\n\nThe news emerged after the City playmaker was not included in Belgium’s squad for their international friendlies against the Republic of Ireland and England later this month.\n\nThe problem is not considered too serious by City and the club are hopeful he will be fit for their crucial Premier League clash with Arsenal on March 31.\n\nIt is nevertheless another setback for De Bruyne after missing most of the first half of the campaign following hamstring surgery.\n\nIt is unclear when the 32-year-old suffered the injury. He looked frustrated to be substituted after 69 minutes of last Sunday’s 1-1 draw at title rivals Liverpool but there was no suggestion at the time he was injured.\n\nBelgium coach Domenico Tedesco offered an update on De Bruyne’s situation at a press conference on Thursday morning.\n\nTedesco told reporters: “Yesterday was a tough day for us because we had some bad news.\n\n“Kevin De Bruyne will miss this camp due to a groin injury, but the most important thing is that he’ll be back very soon on the pitch and we will have him completely for the Euros. This is our target with Kevin.\n\n“We discussed it with a doctor and then I had a call with Kevin and I decided that it’s too risky.\n\n“I think we have a responsibility, not just for the player, also for the team. It should make always sense, if we call a player, he should be able to play and to train.\n\n“And if he’s not ready to play and to train, or if the risk of a re-injury is too high, I think it’s our responsibility to say it’s better to protect him, to give him the time to have a good rehabilitation in City and then have him ready for the Euros.”\n\nSouthgate explains White England decision\n\nBen White has not been included in Gareth Southgate’s last England squad before making his Euro 2024 selection.\n\nSouthgate revealed the Arsenal defender would have been in the 25-man squad but has made himself unavailable for England selection.\n\n“Clearly on form I can’t sit here and say he doesn’t deserve to be in,” Southgate explained. “We had a call from Edu (Arsenal sporting director) last week (and he) said Ben didn’t want to be considered for England squads at this time.\n\n“For me that is a great shame. He is a player we took to the Euros, a player we took to the World Cup and I spoke to him post-Qatar because I wanted to pick him. He is not available to us and there is no issue between us at all – and I also should say there is never any issue with (coach) Steve Holland, because that has been mentioned in articles and I don’t like that.”\n\nPepe shares verdict on Martin Odegaard performance\n\nPorto's decorated defender, Pepe, has shared his thoughts on Martin Odegaard's performance in Arsenal's nail-biting victory over his Portuguese outfit on Tuesday\n\nPepe spoke to Record about how Porto managed to 'neutralise' Odegaard and limit what Arsenal could do in their game and although the Primeira League team didn't win, their captain was proud of how they handled Odegaard.\n\n\"Both teams worked hard, we neutralised Arsenal's game a lot, we can't forget that they are a great team and that they score a lot of goals in the Premier League,\" Pepe said. \"We came here to play our game, we neutralised Odegaard's game between the lines. The team had a very mature attitude on the field, knowing what they were doing, but unfortunately we couldn't score. The game went to extra time and then on penalties they had that extra point.\"\n\nFull list of possible Champions League quarter-final opponents\n\nThe full eight-team list for the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals - including Arsenal - has now been confirmed after the conclusion of Wednesday's fixtures.\n\nThe teams Arsenal could face in the quarter-finals include:\n\nAtletico Madrid, who defeated Inter Milan 3-2 on penalties after a 2-2 draw over two legs in the previous round.\n\nFC Barcelona, who defeated SSC Napoli 4-2 over two legs in the previous round.\n\nBayern Munich, who defeated SS Lazio 3-1 over two legs in the previous round.\n\nBorussia Dortmund, who defeated PSV Eindhoven 3-1 over two legs in the previous round.\n\nManchester City, who are the current holders and defeated FC Copenhagen 6-2 over two legs in the previous round.\n\nParis Saint-Germain, who defeated Real Sociedad 4-1 over two legs in the previous round.\n\nReal Madrid, who defeated RB Leipzig 2-1 over two legs in the previous round.\n\n'It's going to get better'\n\nBen White has been speaking about committing his future to Arsenal.\n\n\"I have been on loan three times, I have been places for a year,\" he said. \"I think this is the first time I’ve actually settled and known I am not going anywhere in the summer. Being here is unbelievable and I’d love to stay [for more years].\"\n\nThe England international's new deal continues Arsenal's strong run with being able to keep their most important talent. Gabriel Magalhaes, Gabriel Martinelli, William Saliba, Martin Odegaard, Aaron Ramsdale, Reiss Nelson and Bukayo Saka have all signed fresh long-term deals to in recent times.\n\nFor White himself seeing so many of his teammates commit to the project in north London was a key reason as to why he wanted to renew his commitment. \"I think when those sort of players are getting signed, it shows there is a real ambition about the club and it is something I am loving being a part of,\" he said. \"I think if you do look at the ages, it’s going to get better.\"\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nBen White has signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal, it has been announced.\n\nWhite's new deal will last until at least 2028, and includes an option to extend by a further 12 months.

We will just take what we get and we will try to win.\n\n“That’s where we want to be. We want to be on the biggest stage. We want to play the biggest games and fight for the biggest trophies.\n\n“When I came here I believed in the project, in the club, what they were doing, everything around the club, I believed in it – and now we are here doing well.\n\n“We just have to keep pushing each other and make sure we get a little bit better every day. We will see where it takes us.”\n\nArsenal sent Man City warning\n\nFormer Arsenal defender Lee Dixon believes the manner of the victory over Porto can help the Gunners' Premier League title challenge moving forwards, but warned that the lengthy break they have before facing Manchester City on March 31 could cause some issues.\n\nSpeaking to BetVictor Dixon said:\n\nTo be in a first Champions League quarter-final in 14 years is massive for the club and for Mikel Arteta’s reign. That result against Porto will be fuel to their title challenge. It keeps everything ticking over moving forwards for the season. When you’re in Europe, everyone at the club is excited. Being in Europe in the latter stages gives everyone at the club a lift and the more they can keep that going the more it will spread around the club.\n\nHowever, they’ve got a bit of break now until they face Manchester City, which can work in their favour or go the other way… When you’re playing like this you want to play every three days and knock teams over. The fact they are in such good form means a three-week break before playing against their title rivals could count against them.\n\nHaving said that, they’ll be doing a lot of work on the training pitch and Mikel Arteta will have to manage those three weeks of training before the next game, which is a rarity. He’s a young coach still too, let’s not forget, so he’s still learning. On the other hand, last time they had a lengthy break, they came back from warm-weather training in Duabi and knocked everyone aside! So it can be a positive.\n\n'Arsenal can go all the way'\n\nFormer Arsenal defender Lee Dixon has told BetVictor that he believes the Gunners can win this year’s Champions League after their last 16 victory over Porto last night.\n\n“After last night’s result against Porto, Arsenal can go all the way in the Champions League and win it,” Dixon said. “They’ll definitely have to play better than they did against Porto over the two legs, even though they went through, that’s for sure. I didn’t think across the two games they were brilliant, but you don’t have to be – it’s a cup competition and all you have to do is get through, which they did.\n\n“If Arsenal can get a decent draw in the next round and get their performances peaking towards the end of the competition then why can’t they go all the way to the final? They’ve got the ability to beat every one of those teams that are in the last eight of the Champions League – be it a Real Madrid, Manchester City or Bayern Munich. It’s just a matter of everything clicking for them on the night.”\n\nOdds slashed on Arsenal to win Champions League\n\nOdds have been slashed to 5/1 from 6/1 on Arsenal winning the Champions League after reaching the quarter-finals on Tuesday.\n\nMan City remain the 7/4 favourites, while Real Madrid are 5/1 to lift the trophy and Harry Kane’s Bayern Munich 7/1\n\nBetfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom said: “Odds have been slashed on Arsenal winning the Champions League after reaching the quarter-finals on Tuesday. The Gunners are into 5/1, having been 6/1 before their penalty shootout victory against Porto.\n\n“Man City remain the favourites to win the trophy at 7/4, while Jude Bellingham is 5/1 to guide Real Madrid to a 15th Champions League title, with Harry Kane 7/1 to lift the trophy with Bayern Munich.”\n\nBetfair: Champions League winner 2023/24\n\nMan City 7/4\n\nArsenal 5/1 (were 6/1)\n\nReal Madrid 5/1\n\nBayern Munich 7/1\n\nInter 9/1\n\nPSG 11/1\n\nBarcelona 12/1\n\nDortmund 40/1\n\nAtletico Madrid 50/1\n\nPSV 100/1\n\nBukayo Saka refuses to answer Rio Ferdinand\n\nArsenal winger Bukayo Saka didn't want to make any hasty comments when Rio Ferdinand asked him about his ideal opponent in the Champions League quarter-finals.\n\nWhen asked by Ferdinand on TNT Sports if he'd prefer a tough match or an easier one, Saka simply smiled and said: \"I don't want to say anything rash\", avoiding giving a direct answer. Apart from PSG and Arsenal, the other four teams in the quarters have all won the Champions League in the past ten years.\n\nMeanwhile, Borussia Dortmund still have to play PSV, while Atletico Madrid will face Italian league leaders Inter Milan. Arsenal haven't gone this far in the Champions League for a long time.\n\nThierry Henry delivers clear Arsenal verdict\n\nArsenal legend Thierry Henry has provided his immediate thoughts on the Gunners reaching the Champions League quarter-finals.\n\n\"It feels good,\" Henry said on CBS Sports. \"I have told you it doesn't matter how we're going to go through, we just have to go through. We knew it was going to be difficult against Porto. I thought it was going to be a tiny bit more easy at home, but it wasn't. It's the Champions League, you're not playing in your league.\n\n\"When a team comes here [Emirates Stadium] especially a team like Porto when they arrive in the tunnel they look at you and they're not scared. You have to show them on the field that you can beat them.\n\n\"We went through on penalties. It hasn't happened for us in a very long time to be in the quarter-finals, but that's a good result. We are also not playing at the weekend which is important.\"\n\nHow much money Arsenal have made from the Champions League this season\n\nAfter reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League, Arsenal added an impressive €10.6m (£9.05m) to their prize money pot. In total, this means the Gunners have gained €47.97m (£40.99m) from their performances in matches this season, taking into account funds awarded for qualifying for the group stages and round of 16, as well as prize money awarded for group-stage wins.\n\nThe money from the Champions League does not stop when the action ends. Arsenal will gain a minimum of €26.62m (£22.74m) thanks to their ten-year UEFA club coefficient ranking. The Gunners sit 14th in UEFA's coefficient table, although Chelsea and Juventus above them both failed to qualify for this year's competition.\n\nThat would take the amount Arsenal have bagged so far to €74.60m (£63.73m), with TV revenue yet to be added.\n\nArsenal shall also receive a share of €300.3m (£256.6m) for their TV revenue however the exact figure will not be known until the competition ends. A breakdown of the TV market pool can be found here.\n\nWhat David Raya and Aaron Ramsdale did before Arsenal penalty shootout\n\nAfter the final whistle on extra time, all eyes became focused on who would be taking the spot-kicks for Arsenal. Attention also centred on David Raya, with the Gunners goalkeeper tasked with helping his team reach the next round.\n\nBefore the shootout began, Raya was spotted walking towards the home dugout where he sat alongside two Arsenal coaches. It was here that Raya could be seen watching a tablet, appearing to go over a plan for the Porto penalties.\n\nAaron Ramsdale, who was on the bench for Arsenal, was also near the bench offering his support to his teammate. After the crucial spot-kick from Galeno was saved by Raya, Ramsdale could be seen embracing his teammate in a hug as he joined in with the celebrations on the pitch.\n\nWho Arsenal can face in Champions League quarter-final\n\nAfter overcoming Porto, Arsenal will now look to continue their hopes of winning the Champions League for the first-time in Friday's draw. The draws for the quarter-final, semi-final and final will all take place on Friday.\n\nThe draw will take place at 11am in Switzerland and is an open draw. There are no seedings or country limitations, so the Gunners could be forced to face Manchester City in the next round.\n\nThe first-leg of the quarter-final will take place on 9/10 April, inbetween the trip to Brighton & Hove Albion and home game with Aston Villa. The second-leg takes place the following week prior to the visit to Wolves.\n\nBayern Munich, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Barcelona have already booked their place in the quarter-final.\n\nInter Milan currently hold a 1-0 advantage over Atletico Madrid while Borussia Dortmund and PSV Eindhoven are tied 1-1.
