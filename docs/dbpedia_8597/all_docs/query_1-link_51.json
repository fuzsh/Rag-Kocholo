        "text": "The 2023-2024 season across Europe brought forth surprise packages that took their leagues by storm. Europe’s top five leagues tend to have the same teams winning their respective leagues and finishing in the coveted top four positions that see them qualify for the Champions League, Europe’s premier club competition.\n\nNevertheless, from time to time, some clubs defy the odds, making history in the process with their performances throughout the season. This season in particular, Europe’s top five leagues which consist of teams in England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France have had teams who have been a revelation.\n\nAston Villa – England\n\nOn October 21, 2022, Aston Villa sacked Steven Gerrard following a dismal 3-0 loss to Fulham at Craven Cottage leaving the club dangling just above the relegation zone. He was replaced by Unai Emery three days later, with the Spaniard leaving his post at Villarreal to take charge of the Villains.\n\nHis first game was a 3-1 success over Manchester United which was a precursor for what was to be expected at Villa Park. He led the club to 7th that season, clinching a European spot for the following season.\n\nThe first game of the 2023/2024 season saw them suffer a heavy defeat at the hands of Newcastle. Despite this defeat, Sir Alex Ferguson declared that their performance would be enough to be the surprise package of the season and so it has proved. Emery and his men challenged at the top area of the league for the entire season.\n\nA league double over second-placed Arsenal, a dominant 1-0 victory at home against champions Manchester City and a 6-1 drubbing over high-flying Brighton solidified them as a team that would be difficult to beat. They maintained their form throughout the season, ending the season in 4th and managing to bring Champions League football for the first time since the 1982/83 season.\n\nGirona – Spain\n\nGirona was promoted to the top flight of Spanish football in the 2021/22 season after a three-year absence. Favorites to go back down, they finished 10th that season, strengthening the squad with the shrewd additions such as Artem Dovbyk for 8 million euros, Daley Blind on a free transfer and Savio plus Eric Garcia on loan. They started the season on fire, picking up 9 wins from 11 with their only defeat coming at the hands of eventual champions Real Madrid.\n\nThey continued their impressive run of form throughout the season, with a memorable 4-3 win against Atletico Madrid, completing a league double over Barcelona winning 4-2 on both occasions and a 5-1 statement win over Sevilla being their season’s highlight.\n\nWith one game remaining, they are confirmed to finish third and a spot in next season’s Champions League for the first time in their 94-year history. Club manager Michel and co will hope to go far in the competition, making their small stadium, Estadi Montilivi, a place where opponents would find it difficult to play.\n\nLeverkusen – Germany\n\nFor 10 consecutive years, Bayern Munich have been the kings of Germany, dominating the league season after season. Last season, their streak almost ended when Borussia Dortmund needed a final-day win to take the mantle away from the Bavarians. However, a draw and a last-minute Jamal Musiala winner meant a 10th title in a row for Bayern.\n\nHowever, Bayer Leverkusen had other ideas to disrupt the grip Bayern had on the ‘Meisterschale’ this time around. Xabi Alonso and Leverkusen won 15 from the first 18 matches which propelled them to the top of the table.\n\nWith teams like Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig being in similar positions over the years, many questioned if Leverkusen would be able to keep up their performances to be champions come May. Yet, their grit and determination to grind out wins had Europe taking notes. What has been synonymous with this team is their ability to snatch draws from the hands of defeat.\n\nBayer Leverkusen has subsequently gone on to win the Bundesliga, doing it in style by going the season unbeaten and is two games away from going the entire season unbeaten in all competitions.\n\nStuttgart – Germany\n\nLast season, Stuttgart defeated Hamburg in the Bundesliga relegation/promotion playoffs to secure a new season in the league. Fast Forward 12 months and they will be preparing to play in Europe’s premier competition for the first time since the 2009/10 season. Led by Sebastian Hoeneß, the German have transformed a club who have been battling relegation in the past few seasons.\n\nSerhou Guirassy has been the club’s shining light notching 28 goals, the league’s second top goal scorer behind Harry Kane.\n\nWith Bayern collapsing on the final matchday to Hoffenheim and their rampant 4-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach, Die Roten finished second place above Bayern Munich. This means they’ll have a chance at a trophy at the start of next season in the German Super Cup, played between the league’s first and second-placed teams the previous season.\n\nFrom relegation playoffs to Champions League nights, the rise has been remarkable\n\nFC Heidenheim – Germany\n\nFC Heidenheim’s first season in the Bundesliga was something to be remembered. This season was their first appearance in the top flight and they took the league by storm. Their memorable 3-2 comeback win after being two goals down was the highlight of their season, cementing their place as a Bundesliga outfit.\n\nBeating already relegated FC Köln on the final day of the season put them in contention for European football.\n\nIf Bayer Leverkusen wins the DFB Pokal, Heidenheim will play in the Europa Conference League.\n\nWith Leverkusen playing in the Europa League final and Borussia Dortmund playing in the Champions League final, a win for both German teams would place Heidenheim in the Europa League pot for next season.\n\nWith or without European football, the work that Frank Schmidt has done in the club’s first top flight season with limited resources is commendable.\n\nBologna – Italy\n\nBologna has been Serie A’s perennial mid-table club, with their highest finish coming last season after the club’s promotion in 2015. They finished 9th under the tutelage of Thiago Motta, which was a sign for things to come.\n\nWith the club taking the league by storm this season, consistent performances and results meant they stood a chance of playing in the Champions League. And with two games to spare, Bologna made history, finishing in the Champions League spots and a chance to play in the competition for the first time in 60 years.\n\nJoshua Zirkzee switched to the Italian outfit in 2022 from Bayern Munich and has been their standout player. He leads the club in goals and assists, with top European clubs circling the 22-year-old.\n\nClubs are also eyeing up the signature of their manager, Thiago Motta after taking a mid-table club to the holy grail of the Champions League. The Bologna faithful will be hoping to have their star man and their manager at the Stadio Renato Dall’Ara to lead their club against Europe’s elite.\n\nStade Brestois – France\n\nAt the beginning of the season, Stade Brestois’s manager Eric Roy said in a press conference that his team would be playing in the Champions League next season. With his team’s odds on favorite to be relegated, his comments would’ve taken many by surprise.\n\nYet, his prediction was realized and conquered with his side finishing third in final day drama. With LOSC Lille conceding a 93rd-minute equalizer to Nice and Brest’s 3-0 away win over Toulouse, they snuck into an automatic Champions League spot. The club has the second smallest stadium in the league and a wage budget of five per cent that of Paris Saint Germain’s.\n\nStade Brestois’s highest finish in the league was 8th which was achieved over 40 years ago and smashing that record in style puts them as one of the biggest surprise packages in Europe."
