A centre forward and an advanced right-sided winger, despite contributing goals during a what was a successful period for the club he never fully established himself in the side and almost half of his appearances came as a substitute. He left to join Liverpool in January 2013.\n\nContents\n\n1 Before Chelsea\n\n2 Chelsea career\n\n2.1 2009-10\n\n2.2 2010-11\n\n2.3 2011-12\n\n2.4 2012-13\n\n3 International\n\n4 Statistics\n\n5 Goals\n\n6 Career honours\n\nBefore Chelsea\n\nSturridge began his career at local club Aston Villa before moving to Coventry City in 2002, from where he joined Manchester City's Academy in 2003, aged 13. He scored his first goal for City on 27 January 2008 in an FA Cup match against Sheffield United, followed three days later by his first league goal on his full debut, against Derby County. However, first team opportunities were sporadic, so Sturridge continued to play for the youth team in the FA Youth Cup. The Manchester side beat Chelsea in the final, Sturridge scoring in the first leg at Stamford Bridge, before going on to complete a 5-2 aggregate victory. Sturridge was the leading scorer in the competition, and became the only player ever to score in the FA Youth Cup, FA Cup and Premier League in the same season. As of 1 May 2009, after 16 appearances in the 2008-09 Premier League season, Sturridge had scored four goals and provided three assists. At the end of the 2008-09 season, the Manchester City fans voted Sturridge as the Manchester City Young Player of the Season, in which he dedicated the award to his family and his uncle Dean.\n\nChelsea career\n\nWith Sturridge's contract at Manchester City having expired, he signed for Chelsea on a four-year contract on 3 July 2009. As Sturridge was under the age of 24, and the two sides were unable to agree a deal, the fee for Sturridge was decided by a tribunal. The Professional Football Compensation Committee decided on 14 January 2010 that Chelsea would pay an initial fee of £3.5 million with additional payments of £500,000 after each of 10, 20, 30 and 40 first-team competitive appearances. There would also be a further payment of £1 million if the player makes a full international appearance, and Manchester City would receive 15 per cent of any sell-on fee if Sturridge is transferred. With Sturridge reaching 40 first team appearances and making his senior England debut in 2011, the full fee subsequently rose to the maximum £6.5m.\n\n2009-10\n\nHaving scored on a pre-season tour in the USA, Sturridge made his Premier League debut for Chelsea on 18 August 2009 against Sunderland, coming on for Didier Drogba. On 28 October 2009, he made his first start for the club in a League Cup win against Bolton Wanderers. On 20 December, Sturridge came on as a substitute at half time against West Ham United and won Chelsea a controversial penalty which Frank Lampard converted. He made his first start in the Premier League for Chelsea away against Birmingham City on Boxing day. He scored his first two goals for Chelsea against Watford in the FA Cup third round on 3 January 2010. He scored a third FA Cup goal in a 2-0 victory against Preston North End. On 13 February 2010, he netted again in the FA Cup against Cardiff City, as Chelsea won 4-1, and became the only player to score in the third, fourth and fifth round of the FA Cup that season. Sturridge scored his first League goal for Chelsea on 25 April 2010, in a 7-0 victory over Stoke City at Stamford Bridge, latching onto a through ball before rounding the goalkeeper and slotting the ball home. During the 2010 FA Cup Final he came on as a 90th minute substitute for Chelsea, as they won 1-0 against Portsmouth. Sturridge finished the 2009-10 FA Cup campaign as the leading scorer for Chelsea with 4 goals.\n\n2010-11\n\nOn 15 September 2010 Sturridge made his full UEFA Champions League debut against Slovakian side MŠK Žilina, scoring in a 4-1 away win. In November he scored his second Champions League goal, again against Žilina, as Chelsea won 2-1 at Stamford Bridge. Two goals in a 7-0 win against Ipswich Town in the FA Cup followed, but with chances limited Sturridge was allowed to join Bolton Wanderers on loan until the end of the season. The young striker made a significant impact at the Reebok Stadium, scoring 8 goals in 12 appearances. Following his return, Sturridge declared that his aim remained to establish himself in the Chelsea first team. [1]\n\n2011-12\n\nSturridge was a star performer in pre-season prior to 2011-12, but due to receiving a red card in his final game for Bolton Wanderers he was suspended for the opening three Premier League fixtures. However Sturridge was named in the starting line-up for the fourth league fixture, against Sunderland, and made an immediate impact; scoring with a clever backheeled finish in a 2-1 away win. Having picked up a minor injury in a League Cup tie against Fulham on 21 September, Sturridge returned to the starting line-up at the start of October, scoring a brace against Bolton Wanderers – the club at which he had impressed on loan the previous season – in a 5-1 away win. His goalscoring form continued during October, scoring against Everton in both the Premier League and League Cup. Five more goals followed in November and December, taking his tally to ten goals in the first half of the season. By Christmas Sturridge appeared to be establishing himself as a key player, but results under André Villas-Boas – already somewhat sporadic – declined thereafter, and the Englishman would not score again until mid-February, by which time the Portuguese manager was under severe pressure. Villas-Boas was sacked at the start of March, and having been a regular starter up to that point Sturridge often found himself on the bench under interim coach Roberto Di Matteo, as the Italian turned to his most experienced players for the key games. Sturridge scored two more goals towards the end of the season, opening the scoring against both Aston Villa and QPR (with a particularly fine strike in the latter), but his status appeared to have returned to that of a squad player by the end of the campaign, albeit one with FA Cup and UEFA Champions League-winners medals, having been an unused substitute in both finals.\n\n2012-13\n\nWith Didier Drogba having left the club following a glorious final season, Sturridge appeared to be first back-up centre forward to Fernando Torres at the start of the 2012-13 season, however with Victor Moses having joined the club (who could also fill a striker or advanced wing role), along with competition on the flanks from new signings Eden Hazard and Oscar, he found competition for a place in the side no less fierce, with Di Matteo clearly intending to start Torres in nearly every match. Sturridge featured regularly as a substitute under Roberto Di Matteo in the opening weeks of the season, but made only two starts, including what would be his last appearance for the Blues in mid-November; a match that would also turn out to be Di Matteo's last league match as manager. A hamstring injury sidelined the striker for the remainder of the year, with rumours emerging that Liverpool had made enquiries regarding a January transfer. Sturridge duly joined the Merseyside club when the transfer window opened for a reported fee of £12m [2].\n\nInternational\n\nSturridge has represented England at every youth level from under-16 upwards. Most notably he scored at the European Under-17 Championship in the final against Italy, twice against Holland for the Under 18 side in 2007, and again at the Under-19 European Championships against Holland. Sturridge has also played for the England Under-21s, including at the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Denmark.\n\nSturridge was called up to the senior England squad for the first time in November 2011. Having been an unused substitute in a friendly match against Spain, he made his senior debut as a second half substitute in a second friendly against Sweden. He went on to make four appearances for his country while at Chelsea.\n\nHe also represented Great Britain at the 2012 London Olympics, but he missed a decisive penalty in a shoot-out as his side exited the competition at the quarter final stage.\n\nStatistics\n\nSeason Prem FA Cup League Cup Europe Other Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals 2009-10 13 1 4 4 1 0 2 0 0 0 20 5 2010-11 13 0 1 2 1 0 5 2 1 0 21 4 2011-12 30 11 4 1 2 1 7 0 0 0 43 13 2012-13 7 1 0 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 12 2 Total 63 13 9 7 5 2 16 2 3 0 96 24\n\nGoals\n\n# Season Date Year Competition Opponent Score Result Venue 12009-1003 January2010FA CupWatford1-05-0Stamford Bridge 22009-1003 January2010FA CupWatford5-05-0Stamford Bridge 32009-1023 January2010FA CupPreston North End2-02-0Deepdale 42009-1013 February2010FA CupCardiff City3-14-1Stamford Bridge 52009-1025 April2010Premier LeagueStoke City6-07-0Stamford Bridge 62010-1115 September2010UEFA Champions LeagueMŠK Žilina‎4-04-1Štadión MŠK Žilina 72010-1123 November2010UEFA Champions LeagueMŠK Žilina‎1-12-1Stamford Bridge 82010-1109 January2011FA CupIpswich Town1-07-0Stamford Bridge 92010-1109 January2011FA CupIpswich Town5-07-0Stamford Bridge 102011-1210 September2011Premier LeagueSunderland2-02-1Stadium of Light 112011-1202 October2011Premier LeagueBolton Wanderers1-05-1Reebok Stadium 122011-1202 October2011Premier LeagueBolton Wanderers3-05-1Reebok Stadium 132011-1215 October2011Premier LeagueEverton1-03-1Stamford Bridge 142011-1226 October2011League CupEverton2-12-1Goodison Park 152011-1220 November2011Premier LeagueLiverpool1-11-2Stamford Bridge 162011-1226 November2011Premier LeagueWolves2-03-0Stamford Bridge 172011-1203 December2011Premier LeagueNewcastle United3-03-0St James Park 182011-1217 December2011Premier LeagueWigan Athletic1-01-1DW Stadium 192011-1222 December2011Premier LeagueTottenham Hotspur1-11-1White Hart Lane 202011-1218 February2012FA CupBirmingham City1-11-1Stamford Bridge 212011-1231 March2012Premier LeagueAston Villa1-04-2Villa Park 222011-1229 April2012Premier LeagueQueens Park Rangers1-06-1Stamford Bridge 232012-1320 October2012Premier LeagueTottenham Hotspur4-24-2White Hart Lane 242012-1331 October2012League CupManchester United4-35-4Stamford Bridge\n\nCareer honours\n\nChelsea"
