        "text": "Dominic Fifield\n\nBest match\n\nFavourite moment Ashley Cole's goal against Sunderland in Chelsea's 7-2 win in mid-January, cushioning John Terry's pass on his instep, taking a touch then steering a fine finish beyond Marton Fulop. That summed Chelsea up: at their best, they were the best.\n\nLeast favourite moment Seeing a middle-aged female Crystal Palace supporter kicked by Sheffield Wednesday fans as she lay on the ground on the Championship's final day.\n\nUnsung hero Alex McLeish has received the plaudits for keeping Birmingham City up so comfortably, so Mick McCarthy is the unsung hero for doing the same – if not quite as eye-catchingly – at Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nVillain Emmanuel Adebayor for his inflammatory celebrations after scoring against Arsenal at Eastlands in September. Staggeringly ill‑conceived.\n\nOwner of the season Andrew Andronikou at Portsmouth. OK, he's technically an administrator, but at least he has been honest about the disgusting level of debt the club are in.\n\nWhat we have learned Arsène Wenger really does need to sign some experienced players, Chelsea have finally secured the right manager, the Premier League's fit and proper person's act is a nonsense and, when things are threatening to go against you, keep beachballs off the pitch\n\nQuote \"We will finish fourth, don't worry\" - Rafael Benítez, or Roberto Mancini. Take your pick.\n\nIn 20 years they'll still be talking about The year Portsmouth last played in the top-flight, but also claimed the FA Cup?\n\nPremier League XI of the season (4-3-3): Hart; Ivanovic, Dawson, King, A Cole; Milner, Lampard, Malouda; Rooney, Drogba, Tevez.\n\nAndy Hunter\n\nBest match\n\nFavourite moment Arsène Wenger striking a biblical pose up in the Old Trafford stands after the heinous crime of kicking a water bottle.\n\nLeast favourite moment Reading Portsmouth's list of creditors and Liverpool's latest accounts.\n\nUnsung hero Avram Grant. More the unlikely hero than unsung, but his stoicism, humour and, not least, his coaching skills have shone through Portsmouth's despair.\n\nVillain The \"brains\" behind the Premier League's fit-and-proper persons test. When is the exam?\n\nOwner of the season Peter Coates. The rarely seen, rarely heard owner of Stoke City has supported the club since childhood, carries any debt and adheres to a budget.\n\nWhat we have learned That the playing field is beginning to level out. Bad news for English hopes in the Champions League, but good for those who value unpredictability in sport.\n\nQuote \"The team needed certain reinforcements and to keep the squad together, but circumstances dictated that we had to sell players and everything got messed up\" Fernando Torres encapsulates Liverpool's decline.\n\nIn 20 years they'll still be talking about The implosion of Liverpool under Tom Hicks and George Gillett.\n\nPremier League XI of the season (4-3-3): Reina; Carr, Vermaelen, Dunne, Evra; Milner, Fábregas, Pienaar; Rooney, Drogba, Tevez.\n\nDavid Hytner\n\nBest match Manchester United 4-3 Manchester City. The pick of United's last-gasp victories over their neighbours.\n\nFavourite moment The winner by Clint Dempsey for Fulham against Juventus. A heady fusion of technique, drama and emotion.\n\nLeast favourite moment Thierry Henry's Hand of Gaul. Time seemed to stand still. So, sadly, did the referee.\n\nUnsung hero Park Ji-sung. Never lets Manchester United down.\n\nVillain Any of the owners or chief executives at Portsmouth.\n\nOwner of the season Daniel Levy. Has kept Tottenham Hotspur on an even financial keel and yet still assembled a top-four squad.\n\nWhat we have learned The Big Four should not have been put on a pedestal.\n\nQuote \"He is like a PlayStation player. He is the best in the world by some distance\" - Arsène Wenger suggests Lionel Messi is from a different dimension.\n\nIn 20 years they'll still be talking about Portsmouth's fairy-tale run to the Cup final.\n\nPremier League XI of the season (4-4-2): Gomes; Ivanovic, Dawson, Vermaelen, A Cole; Parker, Fábregas, Milner, Malouda; Rooney, Drogba.\n\nJamie Jackson\n\nBest match\n\nFavourite moment José Mourinho talking to the Guardian at San Siro after blanking the Italian press.\n\nLeast favourite moment Owen Coyle swapping Burnley for Bolton.\n\nUnsung hero Gianfranco Zola. Took David Gold's unhelpful criticism, saved West Ham United.\n\nVillain Fabio Capello, for taking the captaincy of the national team from John Terry. What does his private life have to do with the England manager?\n\nOwner of the season Roman Abramovich. The way in which the Chelsea owner berated his players after their defeat by Internazionale clearly worked.\n\nWhat we have learned Carlos Tevez can be a prolific goalscorer.\n\nQuote Fulham knock Wolfsburg out of the Europa League in the week Chelsea and Manchester United are eliminated from the Champions League. Asked if he's proud to still be flying the flag, alongside Liverpool, Roy Hodgson says: \"Well, I suppose it's good for our clubs' Uefa co-efficient\".\n\nIn 20 years they'll still be talking about How Portsmouth had four owners in a season, plus an administrator, no wages, a nine‑point deduction from the Premier League and still reached the FA Cup final.\n\nPremier League XI of the season (4-4-2): Van der Sar; Ivanovic, Terry, Dawson, A Cole; Modric, Fábregas, Lampard, Malouda; Rooney, Drogba.\n\nStuart James\n\nBest match\n\nFavourite moment Jimmy Bullard's brilliantly choreographed celebration at Eastlands, when he mimicked Phil Brown's cringeworthy half-time dressing down at the same stadium the previous season.\n\nLeast favourite moment Seeing Aaron Ramsey, who was enjoying an excellent season, in such agony after suffering a double fracture of his leg at Stoke City.\n\nUnsung hero Alex McLeish (given that Roy Hodgson is no longer unsung). The Birmingham City manager secured the club's best final league position (ninth) since 1959 – and with a promoted team.\n\nVillain John Terry. Not easy to be more unpopular than Ashley Cole. But he succeeded.\n\nOwner of the season Steve Morgan at Wolves. A genuine football fan as well as a businessman. Liverpool's loss has been Wolves's gain.\n\nWhat we have learned That it is more important Premier League clubs pay players' image rights than St John Ambulance.\n\nQuote \"Not at all,\" replied a smiling Carson Yeung when asked whether Alex McLeish's position was safe following the takeover. Not the only thing to get lost in translation since Yeung arrived. Anyone seen that £80m transfer kitty?\n\nIn 20 years they'll still be talking about The day the beachball scored against Liverpool at Sunderland.\n\nPremier League XI of the season (4-3-3): Gomes; Ivanovic, Vermaelen, King, Baines; Milner, Lampard, Malouda; Drogba, Rooney, Tevez.\n\nKevin McCarra\n\nBest match\n\nFavourite moment Darren Bent's goal for Sunderland that deflected off a beachball and was allowed to stand in defiance of the laws of the game. We can laugh because defeat made no real difference to Liverpool's campaign.\n\nLeast favourite moment The Burnley v Blackburn match, where coins were thrown at the referee and players.\n\nUnsung hero Mick McCarthy kept a very ordinary squad safe with no fuss.\n\nVillain Take your pick of the people who took Portsmouth to financial ruin.\n\nOwner of the season John Williams, the Blackburn chairman who has delivered stability as well as cheap season tickets.\n\nWhat we have learned The usual top four clubs all have glaring flaws.\n\nQuote \"Sometimes you have a noisy neighbour. They will always be noisy. You just have to get on with your life, put your television on and turn it up a bit louder\" - Are Manchester City getting to Sir Alex Ferguson?\n\nIn 20 years they'll still be talking about Chelsea's lust for goals.\n\nPremier League XI of the season (4-3-3): Gomes; Ivanovic, Vermaelen, King, Evra; Fábregas, Milner, Lampard; Rooney, Drogba, Anelka.\n\nDavid Pleat\n\nBest match\n\nFavourite moment Seeing Chris Hughton and Colin Calderwood overcome expectations to win the Championship at the first attempt following Newcastle's relegation. Also, seeing the FA's unfairly beleaguered Lord Triesman having breakfast with Sir David Richards in Qatar.\n\nLeast favourite moment Hearing, on too many occasions, that another manager had been dismissed.\n\nUnsung hero Eddie Howe, the 32-year-old who masterminded Bournemouth's promotion to League One.\n\nVillain Less a person, more the mismanagement at Portsmouth. Or the long throws of Rory Delap.\n\nOwner of the season Daniel Levy, who has overseen steady improvement at Spurs on the back of financial good sense.\n\nWhat we have learned Premier League salaries are unsustainable.\n\nQuote \"The referee was a joke\" - The excuse from too many disappointed managers.\n\nIn 20 years they'll still be talking about Barcelona's first 30 minutes at Arsenal in the Champions League.\n\nPremier League XI of the season (4-3-1-2): Hart; Carr, Hangeland, Dawson, Evra; Milner, Fábregas, O'Hara; Lampard; Rooney, Drogba.\n\nDaniel Taylor\n\nBest match\n\nFavourite moment Fulham – tiny, patronised Fulham – being England's last club in Europe.\n\nLeast favourite moment Listening to Chelsea legend (57 appearances, one goal) Jason Cundy on Sky.\n\nUnsung hero Alex McLeish – has not had the praise he deserves for turning Birmingham City into a decent mid‑table side.\n\nVillain Robinho – still has not learned that if he snipes about Manchester City in the Brazilian media the quotes will sooner or later find their way back to England.\n\nOwner of the season The Glazer family, for caring about their customers – sorry, fans – and being sweet enough to freeze season-ticket prices. Nurse ...\n\nWhat we have learned Richard Dunne's name does not roll off the tongue in Beijing, but it does in Birmingham. And Sir Alex Ferguson does, finally, care about Manchester City.\n\nQuote \"The only thing Peter is guilty of is trying to be a hero. We've been living a nightmare\" - Peter Storrie's wife in the Daily Telegraph.\n\nIn 20 years they'll still be talking about Steve McClaren's Dutch accent.\n\nPremier League XI of the season (4-4-2): Van der Sar; Ivanovic, Vermaelen, King, Evra; Valencia, Lampard, Fábregas, Modric; Drogba, Rooney.\n\nLouise Taylor\n\nBest match\n\nFavourite moment Adam Johnson's stoppage‑time equaliser for Manchester City in the 1-1 draw at Sunderland.\n\nLeast favourite moment Mark Hughes's sacking by Manchester City. Cruel.\n\nUnsung hero Scott Parker. The reason why relegation was averted at Upton Park.\n\nVillain Sam Allardyce. Still overly obsessed with spoiling tactics.\n\nOwner of the season Ellis Short, of Sunderland, who provided serious yet sensible investment and refused to panic in face of adverse results.\n\nWhat we have learned Money does not always make money. Also, that Manchester United and English football miss Cristiano Ronaldo. Terribly.\n\nQuote \"If you see him stripped you just think 'wow'. His physique is amazing but this unbelievable body of his somehow just keeps falling to bits\" - Steve Bruce on his injury‑prone defender John Mensah.\n\nIn 20 years they'll still be talking about Steve McClaren winning the Dutch title, a key staging post on his eventual return to Manchester United as manager.\n\nPremier League XI of the season (4-4-2): Given; Cuéllar, Vermaelen, King, Baines; Milner, Lampard, Parker, Bale; Drogba, Rooney.\n\nRichard Williams\n\nBest match\n\nFavourite moment The second goal in Arsenal's 3-0 defeat of Aston Villa in December, Cesc Fábregas stretching a hamstring as he sprinted to turn in Theo Walcott's pass.\n\nLeast favourite moment Reading the list of those to whom Portsmouth FC owe money.\n\nUnsung hero Clint Dempsey, who may yet give England a nasty surprise in South Africa.\n\nVillain The grotesque duo who took over at West Ham and promptly began to undermine Gianfranco Zola.\n\nOwner of the season Mohamed Al Fayed, of whom many criticisms can be made but who has consistently done the decent thing by a decent club.\n\nWhat we have learned That, like casino bankers, the Premier League will do nothing to regulate itself.\n\nQuote \"Only wine. No water. And easy questions, please\" - Carlo Ancelotti celebrates.\n\nIn 20 years they'll still be talking about Darren Bent's beachball goal for Sunderland against Liverpool."
