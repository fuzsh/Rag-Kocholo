        "text": "Aston Villa finished fourth in the 2023/24 Premier League and secured the hugely lucrative bonus of a spot in next season's UEFA Champions League.\n\nUnai Emery's side have taken huge strides since the Spaniard's arrival in October 2022. The former Arsenal boss took over a team who were languishing two places above the relegation zone under Steven Gerrard, but he has masterminded a transition that now sees them preparing to battle with the elite of European football once again.\n\nThe Sporting News takes a look at their history in Europe and what it means for Villa to have qualified for the Champions League next season.\n\nMORE: Explaining the new Champions League format?\n\nHave Aston Villa played in UEFA Champions League before?\n\nSince the competition was rebranded as the Champions League in 1992, Aston Villa have never played in Europe's elite club competition. Their first time in the competition will come in 2024/25.\n\nThey have, however, competed in the old European Cup, which they famously won in 1982.\n\nVilla secured the ultimate club prize in Rotterdam in May that year, when they beat Bayern Munich in the final.\n\nThey had navigated past Valur (Iceland), Dynamo Berlin (East Germany), Dynamo Kiev (USSR) and Anderlecht (Belgium) to make the showpiece — but their chances took a turn for the worse when goalkeeper Jimmy Rimmer was forced off early in the final due to an injury.\n\nHe was replaced by Nigel Spink, a relatively inexperienced youngster with only one previous first-team appearance under his belt. However, Spink's second outing for Villa turned into a spectacle as he made a string of heroic saves to etch his name into Aston Villa club folklore.\n\nIn the 67th minute, winger Tony Morley beat his man to deliver a pinpoint cross from the left flank and he found Peter Withe, who arrived unmarked at the far post and shinned the ball into the back of the net to win the European Cup.\n\nPremier League European places\n\nAs of May 19, this is how qualification for Europe among Premier League teams stands for 2024/25. The FA Cup final will determine the final spots.\n\nChampions League: Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Aston Villa\n\nEuropa League: Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea (if Man City win FA Cup final)\n\nConference League: Newcastle (if Man City win FA Cup final)\n\nEnglish Premier League table 2023/24: Final standings\n\nPosTeamPointsMatches\n\nPlayedGoals\n\nScoredGoal\n\nDifference1.Manchester City (UCL)913896+622.Arsenal (UCL)893891+623.Liverpool (UCL)823886+454.Aston Villa (UCL)683876+155.Tottenham Hotspur (UEL)663874+136.Chelsea633877+147.Newcastle United (UECL)603885+238.Manchester United603857-19.West Ham523860-1410.Crystal Palace493857-111.Brighton483855-712.Bournemouth483854-1313.Fulham473855-614.Wolves463850-1515.Everton*403840-1116.Brentford393756-9 17.

It will be 19 as of 2024/25.\n\nThey earned a comeback 2-2 draw in the first leg of the quarterfinals of the 1977-78 competition after Johan Cruyff had scored one of Barcelona's goals at Villa Park, and they took the lead at Camp Nou before the Spanish giants produced two late replies to progress 4-3 on aggregate.\n\nBetter was to come four seasons later, when that 1-0 win over Bayern Munich in Rotterdam landed Villa the European Cup and allowed them to enter the UEFA Super Cup the following season, which they won with revenge over Barca.\n\nTheir European Cup defence ended in the quarterfinals against Juventus, and five early exits from the UEFA Cup followed between 1983 and the 1997-98 season, when they reached the quarterfinals but were beaten on away goals despite a second-leg home win over Atletico Madrid.\n\nAlongside Paris Saint-Germain and Troyes, Villa were one of three winners of the 2001 Intertoto Cup — a tournament with a reward of UEFA Cup entry, which was discontinued in 2008.\n\nSeasonCompetitionStage1975/76UEFA CupRound one1977/78UEFA CupQuarterfinals1981/82European CupWinners1982/83*European CupQuarterfinals1983/84UEFA CupRound two1990/91UEFA CupRound two1993/94UEFA CupRound two1994/95UEFA CupRound two1996/97UEFA CupRound one1997/98UEFA CupQuarterfinals1998/99UEFA CupRound two2000/01Intertoto CupSemifinals2001/02UEFA Cup**Round one2002/03Intertoto CupSemifinals2008/09Europa League***Round of 322009/10Europa LeaguePlayoffs2010/11Europa LeaguePlayoffs2023/24Europa Conference LeagueSemifinals2024/25Champions LeagueTBD\n\n* Club also won the Super Cup and finished as Intercontinental Cup runners-up\n\n** Won the Intertoto Cup\n\n*** Qualified through Intertoto Cup\n\nUnai Emery's history in Champions League\n\nWhile he has never won the Champions League, Emery's most successful finish in the competition was making the semifinals with Villarreal in 2021/22."
