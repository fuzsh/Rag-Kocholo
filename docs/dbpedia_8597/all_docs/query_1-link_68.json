        "text": "Nobody likes playing Man City, but Watford have been on the receiving end of more punishment from Pep Guardiola's side than most.\n\nIn fact, Watford's woes against City this season are up there with the worst ever experienced at the hands of one team in a single campaign.\n\nTuesday night's thrashing was relatively tame compared to the 8-0 walloping the Hornets suffered at the Etihad way back in September.\n\nIt was just the four goals they conceded against City at Vicarage Road: two from Raheem Sterling, one from Phil Foden and another from Aymeric Laporte.\n\nThat means Watford have conceded 12 goals against City this season alone. TWELVE!\n\nAccording to Opta, that's the the joint-most by a team against an opponent in a season along with Blackburn vs Nottingham Forest in 1995/96 and Spurs vs Wigan in 2009/10.\n\nIf Gabriel Jesus stayed onside for his last-minute header, it would've been the most ever.\n\nPlus, it could be the reason Watford end up going down this season.\n\nThe result completely wiped out their goal difference advantage over Aston Villa and Bournemouth, meaning it will be play for on the final day.\n\nVilla actually wiped out the three-point difference later on Tuesday night with a 1-0 victory over Arsenal.\n\nThey move above Watford by one goal, so the thrashing by City was incredibly damaging for the Hornets.\n\nThey face a tricky trip to Arsenal on the final day, while Villa and Bournemouth go to West Ham and Everton respectively.\n\nIf goal difference decides things, Watford's 12-0 aggregate defeat to City this season will have played a big part."
