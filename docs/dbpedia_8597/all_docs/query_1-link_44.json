        "text": "The draw for the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League has taken place, with Arsenal and Manchester City both learning their fate.\n\nBoth clubs have been given favourable ties as Mikel Arteta's side take on Porto while Pep Guardiola's team take on Copenhagen, who finished above Manchester United in their group.\n\nAs the Gunners and City finished top of their respective groups, they will each have their first-leg match away from home before playing the return match a few weeks later.\n\nCity will play their first leg on Tuesday 13 February while Arsenal's match will take place on Wednesday 21 February. City's return leg is on Wednesday 6 March and Arsenal's is on Tuesday 12 March.\n\nChampions League last-16 draw:\n\nPorto v Arsenal\n\nNapoli v FC Barcelona\n\nParis Saint-Germain v Real Sociedad\n\nInter Milan v Atletico Madrid\n\nPSV Eindhoven v Borussia Dortmund\n\nLazio v Bayern Munich\n\nFC Copenhagen v Manchester City\n\nRB Leipzig v Real Madrid\n\nArsenal's history against Porto\n\nIt will be the fourth time Arsenal have faced Porto in the competition. The last time the Gunners played the Portuguese side was in the 2009/10 season, also in the last 16.\n\nOn that occasion Arsenal lost the first leg 2-1 before winning 5-0 at Emirates Stadium to seal a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nBefore that, both teams met in the 2006/07 and 2008/09 group stage, with Arsenal only losing one of the four meetings, a 2-0 defeat in the latter season at Porto's Estadio do Dragao.\n\nMan City's history against Copenhagen\n\nCity meet Copenhagen in the Champions League for a second successive season.\n\nThey faced each other in the group stage in 2022/23 and City took four points from the two meetings, winning 5-0 at the Etihad Stadium and then drawing 0-0 in the return match.\n\nWhy the draw can be good news for Premier League sides\n\nNext season the Champions League will be revamped as more sides are included in the competition.\n\nThis means that five Premier League teams could qualify for the competition, depending on where England finish in UEFA's co-efficient rankings this campaign.\n\nUEFA calculates which two leagues will be rewarded by adding up coefficient points based on the performances of clubs from each league across the Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League.\n\nEvery win, no matter the competition, earns each league two points, while a draw gets one point, and there are no points for defeat. At this moment in time, England sit third in the standings.\n\nUEFA co-efficient rankings\n\n1) Italy - 14.00\n\n2) Germany - 13.64\n\n3) England - 13.63\n\n4) Spain - 12.69\n\n5) Czech Republic - 12.00\n\nSource: ESPN\n\nShould Arsenal and City win their respective ties then England's coefficient ranking will increase.\n\nAnd because teams from Italy, Germany and Spain have drawn each other in the last 16 then at least one of those nations' co-efficient score will take a hit.\n\nFor example, Italy's Napoli and Inter Milan face Spain's Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, respectively. Whoever gets knocked out from those two ties, their nations will not be able to accrue any more points."
