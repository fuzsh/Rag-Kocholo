        "text": "The Premier League season has drawn to a close for the season, with Manchester United winning a historic, 19th League title but how are the clubs operating financially?\n\nDespite a record income, the 20 top-flight clubs collectively lost nearly half a billion pounds. Rises in revenue saw a £2.1bn total revenue for the Premier League clubs in 2009-10 but large debts and interest rates have stopped the income from soaring as 16 out of the 20 clubs recorded losses.\n\nDavid Conn has written:\n\nAcross Manchester, United made £286m turnover, more than any other club if Arsenal's property income is discounted – yet the costs and interest on the debts the owners, the Glazer family, have loaded on to the club, pushed United into a losing £79m.\n\nDouble-winners in 2009-10 Chelsea, whose owner, the Russian oil oligarch Roman Abramovich, is always cited as a supporter of Uefa's break-even \"financial fair play\" principles, made the next biggest loss, £78m. Tottenham's successful push for Champions League qualification was achieved with a £7m loss and £15m investment from the owners, principally Bahamas-based currency speculator, Joe Lewis.\n\nThe table below shows turnover plus income from things such as gate/matchday and TV and broadcasting as well as net debt for each club and wages as a percentage of turnover. The spreadsheet to download includes additional accounts details such as losses, profits and which money put in by the owners.\n\nThere's a pdf of the accounts too.
