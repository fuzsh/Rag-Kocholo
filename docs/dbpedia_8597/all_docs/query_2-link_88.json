        "text": "On 9 May 2010, exactly a decade ago tomorrow, the Blues were crowned league champions again at the end of a thrilling campaign with a stunning performance against Wigan. It was a microcosm of our brilliant, free-flowing season as we hit the Latics for eight without reply at Stamford Bridge.\n\nManchester United had run us close all season, having won the title themselves in three successive years, and they were hot on our heels going into the final round of league fixtures, trailing by just a point. It meant we had to win against a Wigan side who had already confirmed their top-flight safety.\n\nThe goals were shared among the usual suspects - as well as Ashley Cole - as the thumping win took our league scoring tally for the season to 103, making us the first team to net 100 goals in the league since Tottenham in the 1960s.\n\nDidier Drogba's second-half hat-trick was also notable as it secured the Ivorian his second Golden Boot award, with 29 goals in 32 league appearances that campaign.\n\nAs the ticker tape rained down from the west London skies and the party got into full swing, we had the welcome sight of John Terry stepping forward to lift a third Premier League title for the club in six years. The following weekend, Drogba's goal at Wembley in the FA Cup final completed our one and only Double.\n\nRelive the game in full on the 5th Stand app from 3pm tomorrow (Saturday)."
