        "text": "Whatever your opinion of Manchester City’s legal challenge to the Premier League, the supporting arguments certainly served as an eye-opener.\n\nCity are disputing the league’s Associated Party Transactions (APT) rules, on the basis that they restrict competition — basically, they’re saying that sponsors should be able to pay whatever they want.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nCity are taking legal action against the Premier League - what does it all mean?\n\nThe APT rules brought in shortly after the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund takeover of Newcastle United was confirmed in 2021, and that is part of City’s point — they say that other Premier League clubs are working against owners and investors from the Middle East.\n\nThe full ins-and-outs of the case can be found here, but another element of all this is the reaction from City fans.\n\nSome have welcomed the club’s move, seeing it as a strike back at the aggressor. Others have begun to appreciate the realities of all these legal battles, seeing just how far City will go to get the outcome they feel they deserve and what could come later down the line.\n\nAnd that is partly because City’s arguments in this case have been easy to digest and were widely shared across social media.\n\nThat has not always been the situation previously.\n\nRival fans still talk about City getting off their Champions League ban in 2020 on a time-barred technicality, ignoring the fact that they proved their argument on the charges that were examined. On the other side, even manager Pep Guardiola has said City were proven “completely innocent” by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which again is not completely true either, due to those time-barred elements.\n\nIt is easy to look at the main takeaways and then — depending on where football allegiances lie, in most cases — settle on an opinion from there. It has been ‘We won’ or ‘You cheated’ for four years now.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, the ‘115’ talk has lost a lot of meaning now. The outcome itself is obviously still hugely significant, but the more it drags on, the more that other clubs’ supporters bring it up, the more it becomes almost a badge of honour, either ironically or not, for City followers.\n\nThose on the other side have found an outlet for their frustrations online, but 16 months on it must start to feel like some far-off day of reckoning which may never actually come.\n\nThat is partly because when the Premier League announced the charges in February last year, there was little to take from the statement because most of it looked like this:\n\n“(a) for Season 2009-10, Premier League Rules B.13, C.71, C.72 and C.75 (from 10 September 2009, Premier League Rules B.13, C.71, C.72, C.79 and C.80).”\n\nUnless you were a legal expert, there was little to digest beyond the size of the implications, and, truth be told, even now very few people are certain of what the punishments could be if City are found guilty. Would they be stripped of titles? Who honestly knows? Nobody has even confirmed when the hearings will start and how long they will last once they do.\n\nBut Tuesday’s revelations are another story.\n\nBecause UK newspaper The Times has got hold of the 165-page document that City submitted in support of their case, we know exactly what is being argued.\n\nThe case itself seems reasonable, although not everybody agreed: City are understood to be looking for a change to the APT regulations, rather than an abolishment of them, and they make the case that those rules go against UK competition law. Senior sources at other clubs believe they have a good chance of winning — it is not a frivolous case to bring.\n\nBut some of the arguments, while perfectly normal in a legal setting, are hard to swallow because they appear to use the very essence of football — fans and community — almost as bargaining chips.\n\n“City argue that the present rules will limit their ability to buy the best players, and force them to charge fans more for tickets,” the article in The Times reads. “They say they may also have to cut spending on youth development, women’s football, and community programmes.”\n\nThis is where the reality of all of these battles has begun to hit home, for some.\n\nIt could certainly be argued in court that restricting the club’s income from sponsorships might lead to a rise in ticket prices to make up the difference, but the court of public opinion could easily decide that City would put prices up anyway, as they had been doing for other reasons for years before these APT rules were brought in.\n\nThis all comes a couple of months after City fans protested against such price rises, and the idea that academy and women’s teams, and community projects, would suffer is just as hard to swallow.\n\nOf course, these are arguments to strengthen the core complaint — the idea that APT rules have restricted City to such a degree, all of these things are at risk.\n\nIt is like City’s claim that the Premier League has a conflict of interest because it itself is a “direct competitor for sponsorship”, and that the data analytics company used by the league to determine the fair value of the sponsorship deals is not independent because it has been retained for more than two years.\n\nIt is a case of throwing enough mud so that some of it sticks. City are laying it on thick, and they will know that some of these arguments might be rejected — but they might win.\n\nIt is a bit like City’s approach to the Premier League’s charges against them. It was one thing for Guardiola to say, earlier this year, that he wants the case dealt with as soon as possible, because while he wields an incredible amount of power at City, he cannot dictate how their legal team act.\n\nIt is another, though, for the chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, to say the same thing in an interview released via the club’s in-house media on Wednesday.\n\n“I think we as a club have to respect that there is a process that we have to go through, and we’re going through it,” he says, and that is perfectly reasonable. It is a long process because it is so complicated.\n\n“It’s taking longer than what anyone hoped for, but it is what it is,” he went on to say, which is also hard to swallow because City tried to delay the investigation at several junctures before the charges were even brought.\n\nIt is a bit like the claim in The Times that City — in their supporting document — referred to a “tyranny of the majority” when it comes to the Premier League rule that 14 of its 20 clubs must agree on a particular motion for it to pass, a rule which City want to remove.\n\nIt is easy to imagine that being used to move the needle towards or against certain interests, given it was the American owners of Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United who dreamt up the ill-fated Project Big Picture, a precursor to the European Super League drama just over three years ago.\n\nAnd they cite comments from another Premier League executive, which they say demonstrate “discrimination against Gulf ownership”, which is obviously something that should be properly addressed. But then again, City were part of that Super League proposal anyway, so complaining about clandestine groups seems a bit rich.\n\nThe long and the short of it is that City’s legal team will try any tactic in a bid to clear the club’s name — that is how these things work.\n\nYears ago, they tried to have the Premier League investigation thrown out because, they submitted, the league was not impartial and did not have the power to demand documents from them. When that was overturned, they appealed to a different court, arguing the tribunal which had made that decision was itself biased and did not have jurisdiction to reach it.\n\nLittle is known about that, but this week’s developments are different.\n\nArguing that ticket prices have had to go up and that funding to community projects might have to be cut is just another way to try to get the right outcome for the club.\n\nThat is what fans will want, too, but this week’s events have given people an insight into the off-pitch battles that City have been fighting during the past few years, and how they fight them.\n\n(Top photo: Michael Regan/Getty Images)"
