        "text": "Mathieu Valbuena used to wow crowds on Champions League nights and star for France in major international tournaments but the iconic forward has found a new challenge.\n\nKnown for his small stature, the versatile forward stands at only 5ft 6in and was given the nickname ‘Little Prince’. The former Marseille star featured for France at their doomed 2010 World Cup in South Africa before playing a key part in their 2014 World Cup run to the quarter-finals.\n\nBut in the twilight of his career and turning 40 next month, Valbuena has joined Greek Super League side Athens Kallithea on a free transfer. Kallithea return to Greece’s top tier this season for the first time since 2006 when they were relegated after a four-year stint in the top flight for the first time in their history.\n\nREAD MORE: Coke snorting keeper jailed for saving hostage from Escobar unrecognisable after surgery\n\nREAD MORE: Ex-Premier League striker dropped into non-league after a chance meeting at a wedding\n\nThe Athens side were taken over in August 2021 by Greek-American Ted Philipakos, who was a former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Brand Officer at Italian club Venezia. Following back-to-back second place finishes in the second tier, AKFC were crowned Super League 2 champions earlier this year.\n\nValbuena is set to be the club’s new talisman for their upcoming campaign back in the top flight and the French international’s experience will be a huge asset as he returns to Greece having spent four years at Olympiacos between 2019 and 2023.\n\nWhat do you make of Mathieu Valbuena's career? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nValbuena joined Marseille in 2006 having played amateur football for Langon-Castets after been left go by Bordeaux. He was signed by then-second-tier side Libourne before he was snapped up by Marseille.\n\nThe brightest years of his career came during his days at Marseille where he played 330 times and guided Marseille to a league and cup double in the 2009/10 season amid a background of uncertainty surrounding his future with reported interest from Aston Villa, Arsenal and Liverpool.\n\nValbuena did remain at the Stade Velodrome until 2014 when he joined Russian side Dynamo Moscow, but he was back in France just a year later, signing for Lyon.\n\nValbuena joined Fenerbahce in 2017 ahead of his move to Olympiakos, leaving the Greek giants to move to Cypriot side Apollon Limassol before returning back to Greece this summer."
