        "text": "An all-Manchester Capital One Cup Final is on the cards after United beat Stoke last night.\n\nThe Reds will face Sunderland in a two-legged semi-final, while City take on West Ham in the other last-four showdown.\n\nThat paves the way for Manchester's big two – favourites in both the semis – to go head-to-head for the cup at Wembley on March 2.\n\nBoth Manchester sides will be confident of progressing to Wembley, having beaten their semi-final opponents already in the league this season.\n\nUnited came from behind to beat Sunderland 2-1 at the Stadium of Light with a brace from Adnan Januzaj, while West Ham were the team City picked up their first away win of the season against with an impressive 3-1 victory in East London in October.\n\nThe two-legged semi-finals - the only stage of the competition with return fixtures - will take place in the weeks commencing January 6 and January 20.\n\nAny Manchester team in the final could mean two derbies in a week; the second league meeting of the season between City and United is scheduled for March 1 but the Capital One Cup final will be played a day later, forcing the league date to be switched.\n\nUnited last won the League Cup in the 2009/10 season when they defeated Aston Villa in the final, while City last won the competition in 1976 but they have been knocked out of the semi-finals in two of the previous four seasons.\n\nWhile Reds boss David Moyes would not be drawn on the prospect of potentially meeting the Blues, he was delighted that his team came out on top at a hail-lashed Britannia Stadium.\n\n“I’d like to see United in the final definitely,” he said. “That’s what I would like to see!”"
