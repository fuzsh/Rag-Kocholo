Former Man City financial advisor Stefan Borson believes the Premier League is better off losing the 115-charge case to avoid defaming its own competition.\n\nHe said: \"If they bring this action and are successful against Manchester City, they will just discredit their own Premier League and if they don't… The position you have got is for the Premier League to reverse at this stage…\n\nALSO READ: Everything Guardiola has said on Man City future amid Bayern Munich links\n\nALSO READ: Man City rivals disprove latest excuse being readied for 115 charges\n\n\"It may be in the interests of the Premier League to take it to the independent commission and lose.
