        "text": "The full eight-team list for the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals - including Arsenal - has now been confirmed after the conclusion of Wednesday's fixtures.\n\nOn Tuesday Mikel Arteta's side had a one-goal deficit to overturn in the round of 16 against FC Porto. Leandro Trossard levelled up the aggregate scoreline before half-time, then David Raya gave a big helping hand after the tie had gone to penalties by producing two spectacular saves on the way to victory.\n\nIt confirmed the Gunners' place amongst Europe's elite, and marked their first progression this far in the competition in eight attempts since the 2009/10 campaign. Now that their Portuguese opponents have been successfully dispatched, all eyes will be on Friday's draw to confirm the outset for the rest of the competition.\n\nTaking place at 11am GMT in Switzerland, it will pair together clubs for the quarter-finals first. Once complete, the procedure is then repeated to complete the tournament tree and each team's potential route to the final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nImportantly there are no seeding or country limitations from this point onwards, therefore Arsenal could draw the only other English team left in the Champions League, Manchester City, if that is what fate decides.\n\nREAD MORE: Jurrien Timber can make Champions League Arsenal debut in the quarter-finals after latest boost\n\nREAD MORE: The truth over Sergio Conceicao comments as Mikel Arteta celebrates Arsenal victory\n\nQuarter-final first legs are scheduled to take place April 9/10, then second legs would be played the following week on April 16/17. The order of the draw depends on whether they will play home or away first.\n\nWith those facts in mind, football.london has reviewed the now-complete list of teams that have made it through to the quarter-finals, and therefore Arsenal could face...\n\nPotential opponents in the quarter-final\n\nAtletico Madrid, who defeated Inter Milan 3-2 on penalties after a 2-2 draw over two legs in the previous round.\n\nFC Barcelona, who defeated SSC Napoli 4-2 over two legs in the previous round.\n\nBayern Munich, who defeated SS Lazio 3-1 over two legs in the previous round.\n\nBorussia Dortmund, who defeated PSV Eindhoven 3-1 over two legs in the previous round.\n\nManchester City, who are the current holders and defeated FC Copenhagen 6-2 over two legs in the previous round.\n\nParis Saint-Germain, who defeated Real Sociedad 4-1 over two legs in the previous round."
