        "text": "The Premier League is the top tier of England's football pyramid, with 20 teams battling it out for the honour of being crowned English champions.\n\nHome to some of the most famous clubs, players, managers and stadiums in world football, the Premier League is the most-watched league on the planet, with it reaching 920 million homes in 189 countries.\n\nThe league takes place between August and May and involves the teams playing each other home and away across the season, a total of 380 matches.\n\nThree points are awarded for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat, with the team with the most points at the end of the season winning the Premier League title.\n\nThe teams who finish in the bottom three of the league table at the end of the campaign, are relegated to the Championship, the second tier of English football.\n\nThose teams are replaced by three clubs promoted from the Championship; the sides who finish in first and second place and the third via the end-of-season playoffs.\n\nIf any clubs finish with the same number of points, their position in the Premier League table is determined by goal difference, then the number of goals scored, then the team who collected the most points in the head-to-head matches, then who scored most away goals in the head-to-head.\n\nSince the League began in 1992, there have been seven different winners: Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City and Liverpool. Man Utd have had the most success with 13 titles in the 31 seasons so far.\n\nMan City have the Premier League record for the biggest winning margin, when they finished 19 points ahead of second-placed Manchester United in 2017/18.\n\nThe narrowest winning margin of +8 goal difference came in 2011/12 when Sergio Aguero's goal, deep into stoppage time on the final day of the season, gave Man City the title in the most dramatic of Premier League finishes.\n\nArsene Wenger's Arsenal are the only side to have gone the entire Premier League campaign unbeaten. That record season was achieved in 2003/04, when they won the title by 11 points from Chelsea.\n\nFor more Premier League facts and figures, click here.\n\nA total of 51 clubs have played in the Premier League, with Luton Town being the latest to make their debut, in 2023/24.\n\nSix clubs are \"ever-present\", having been in the Premier League since it formed: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe teams who finish in the top four of the Premier League, qualify for the next season's UEFA Champions League group stages.\n\nA fifth-place Premier League finish will put a team into the UEFA Europa League, but the next best-placed teams who have not qualified for Europe, will also enter the competition if the winners of the FA Cup and/or League Cup qualify through their league position.\n\nThe team finishing sixth or lower depending on who wins the cup competitions will enter the UEFA Europa Conference League.\n\nPremier League champions\n\n2023/24 Manchester City\n\n2022/23 Manchester City\n\n2021/22 Manchester City\n\n2020/21 Manchester City\n\n2019/20 Liverpool\n\n2018/19 Manchester City\n\n2017/18 Manchester City\n\n2016/17 Chelsea\n\n2015/16 Leicester City\n\n2014/15 Chelsea\n\n2013/14 Manchester City\n\n2012/13 Manchester United\n\n2011/12 Manchester City\n\n2010/11 Manchester United\n\n2009/10 Chelsea\n\n2008/09 Manchester United\n\n2007/08 Manchester United\n\n2006/07 Manchester United\n\n2005/06 Chelsea\n\n2004/05 Chelsea\n\n2003/04 Arsenal\n\n2002/03 Manchester United\n\n2001/02 Arsenal\n\n2000/01 Manchester United\n\n1999/00 Manchester United\n\n1998/99 Manchester United\n\n1997/98 Arsenal\n\n1996/97 Manchester United\n\n1995/96 Manchester United\n\n1994/95 Blackburn Rovers\n\n1993/94 Manchester United\n\n1992/93 Manchester United"
