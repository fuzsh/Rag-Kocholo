        "text": "I'll tell you who will win the premiership this season... Wigan Athletic!\n\ndid u see them win vs. Aston Villa 2-0! Wigan all the way for me.... oh damn... they lost last night to Wolves... nevermind!\n\nSeriously though, some of these posts are making me LMAO! It was the first game of the season FFS! Although I think that, at this point, we can safely conclude that Everton most likely won't take the championship this season. Let's remember what happened on the opening day of last season... Man United 1-1 Newcastle @ Old Trafford! So did that mean that Newcastle were going to challenge Man U? Ha! We all know how that story ended....\n\nI do agree though... Manchester City will be a force to be reckoned with.... in the coming years.... but I don't think they will win it this year. It's a process... first, they have to try and become a side that can qualify for the euro cup through their league standing... then they can become the 'best of the rest (outside the big 4)'... next, they need to break into the big four... then they can mount a titled challenge campaign. At the moment, they're just signing and paying whoever wants to come. They need to acquire the depth and build into a cohesive unit in order to mount a serious title-winning campaign... they've got an impressive array of talent - their attack is probably better than anybodies at the moment... Robinho, Tevez, Adebayour, Santa Cruz !!!!\n\nI don't think it's too ridiculous to see city taking 5th this season, especially given the plight of Everton / Villa lately but I doubt they'll be challenging for the championship, or champions league for that matter this season. Next season though, once the team has blended a bit better - I think they'll have more of a chance.\n\nI am a Manchster United fan, but I think the dark horses this season will be Spurs. Liverpool will implode because a] they have no money, b] Benitez seems to flap all the time, as if football is a science, without emotion, c] unless they keep Gerrard and Torres fully fit, they will not have any balance and d] they will miss Alonso more than they thought. Chelsea wil have a good season, but I wonder if the Ancellotti 'diamond' tactic will last in the PL. Arsenal are as beautiful as ever, but a freezing night away at Burnley, or Hull might stunt their fluid play. Everton and Villa will both fall short. So one winner, even without Ronaldo. I hear the dressing room was split about him anyway."
