        "text": "The world’s most exciting/predictable/fast-paced/dull/frenetic/well-funded/unbalanced/compelling (delete as appropriate) football league is back this weekend, as the Premier League 2009/2010 blitzes it’s way inexorably into our national consciousness for the next ten months.\n\nMany moons have now passed since Manchester United eventually saw off Liverpool’s challenge to win a third consecutive league title, Hull City survived on the final day of the season, Fulham secured an unlikely place in Europe and Newcastle United plunged into the depths of relegation woe along with Middlesbrough and West Bromwich Albion. And so as the new season looms large and it all gets underway again we at Just Football present to you our team by team Premier League 09/10 season preview. First up:\n\nArsenal\n\n(Last season – 4th)\n\nIt did not really go to plan for Arsenal last season. Shock early defeats to the likes of Hull, Fulham and Stoke quickly knocked the stuffing out of the Gunners, and by the time Arsene Wenger could restore any confidence to his bruised squad Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and even Aston Villa had already run away from them.\n\nAn impressive 21 game unbeaten run eventually hauled them back above Villa to secure a Champions League spot, but defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi final followed by two demoralising, comprehensive beatings at the hands of United in the Champions League and Chelsea again (4-1 at the Emirates) meant that to all but the most optimistic of fans Arsenal’s season ended in grave disappointment. This malaise was accentuated when Wenger came in for stinging criticism from certain sections at the club’s AGM. Indeed, the Frenchman was so dismayed by the air of negativity around the club that he even briefly pondered moving to Real Madrid.\n\nThat Wenger stayed proves his undying faith in a club and playing staff that has his distinct blueprint firmly imprinted on it and, just as last season, in the buildup to 2009/2010 Wenger has been championing the promising development of his relatively young squad. It is a squad boosted by the return to full fitness of Eduardo and the signing of Ajax captain Thomas Vermaelen, but depleted by the departures of Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Toure – players who were crucially important to Arsenal over the last few years no matter the verdict handed them by Arsenal fans in light of their moves to Manchester City. Nevertheless, to extract £39 million for those two looks a fantastic deal.\n\nHeading into 2009/2010 have Arsenal sufficiently improved the squad to be able to challenge for the title? Well, based on their current summer business no, but there is still time (and money) for Wenger to address that. And anyway, Arsenal’s season will likely be determined more by the players already there than any potential signings. Wenger looks to have settled on a new formation in pre-season, aping FC Barcelona by opting for a fluid, interchangeable 4-3-3.\n\nThis could suit the Gunners perfectly. Samir Nasri, Andrey Arshavin, Robin Van Persie, Eduardo, Theo Walcott, Aaron Ramsey, Carlos Vela, Thomas Rosicky – Arsenal have a nice blend of forward players who can all slot seamlessly into those attacking midfield areas. The immense technical ability of Wenger’s attacking options is clear, and Arshavin in particular looks destined to set the Premiership alight. However, Arsenal fans are still crying out for another dominant defender (Brede Hangeland?) and a marauding midfielder (Patrick Vieira?) to bring in steel to complement the fancy stuff. The squad as it is also desperately needs another target man upfront, someone who can hold the ball up and put it in the net.\n\nGunners fans do not need reminding but it is now 4 years since Arsenal won a trophy. That is plainly not good enough for such an esteemed club. If it becomes five by this time next year how much longer will Wenger be able to withstand the pressure?\n\nKey Man: Andrey Arshavin\n\nOne to Watch: Jack Wilshere\n\nIn: Thomas Vermaelen (Ajax, £10m).\n\nOut: Emmanuel Adebayor (Manchester City, £25m); Kolo Touré (Manchester City, £14m); Abu Ogogo (Dagenham & Redbridge, Free); Rene Steer (Oldham Athletic, Free); Amaury Bischoff (Released); Rui Fonte (Released); Paul Rodgers (Released).\n\nAston Villa\n\n(Last season – 6th)\n\nFor two thirds of last season Aston Villa’s verve and dynamism brought a welcome freshness to the Premier League, and offered real hope to those who have grown tired of the monopoly over Champions League positions held for so long by the so-called big four.\n\nBut early season promise turned to end of season pain for Martin O’Neill’s side, and just when people began to truly believe they might make the top four Villa underwent a slump so drastic they fell from 3rd to an eventual position of 6th, winning just 1 in 12 to round off a truly awful end to an otherwise thrilling campaign.\n\nLack of squad depth was the obvious problem for Villa, not to mention Martin Laursen’s saddening injury recurrence and subsequent retirement, but with the new season fast approaching the lack of numbers at Villa Park has not yet been adequately addressed.\n\nInstead another key player has headed for the exit door, with Gareth Barry making his highly unpopular move to Manchester City. O’Neill has tried his upmost to address the situation by bringing in Stewart Downing, Fabian Delph and Habib Beye, but the squad is still thin, a sentiment evidently also felt by the players – both Curtis Davies and John Carew have publicly called for new faces.\n\nMeanwhile other clubs with similar aspirations to Aston Villa have been busy investing. Spurs promise to be more competitive this year, Everton regularly hover around the upper echelons of the table and Manchester City have blown the transfer m\n\narket apart with their lavish spending. Villa have finished 6th for the past two years now, but given the way things are shaping can the Midlands outfit realistically match or even improve on that this time?\n\nOn the plus side, Villa still have several players more than capable of exciting expectant fans. Ashley Young is still around and might even be able to stake a claim for best winger in the Premiership following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo, while James Milner showed great maturity in England’s U-21 European Championships campaign and looks to be growing in stature all the time. Fabian Delph is also very highly rated and Downing will offer yet more cutting edge to Villa’s game once he recovers from injury. Wilfred Bouma is also back from injury to bolster the defence.\n\nOne area that still looks like it needs addressing however is the strikeforce. Villa still lack a 20-goal-a-season striker to consistently bury any chances the gifted flair players manage to create, and while John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor both made it into double figures last season neither is especially prolific. Emile Heskey too offers good link up play but does not guarantee goals. The relationship between Agbonlahor and Villa fans will also be interesting to watch this season as the young striker was often unfairly booed in the latter stages of 2008/2009. That rapport might well be tested again this year.\n\nWith just a bit more staying power Aston Villa could have been participating in the Champions League this season. As it stands it looks doubtful they will be able to reach similar lofty heights again this time around. An upper mid-table finish appears more likely.\n\nKey Man: Ashley Young\n\nOne to Watch: James Milner\n\nIn: Stewart Downing (Middlesbrough, £12m), Fabian Delph (Leeds United, £8m), Habib Beye (Newcastle United, £2.5m)\n\nOut: Gareth Barry (Manchester City, £12m), Stuart Taylor (Manchester City, free), Zat Knight (Bolton Wanderers, £5m), Martin Laursen (retired)"
