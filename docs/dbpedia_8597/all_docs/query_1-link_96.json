        "text": "Aston Villa have been in exceptional form since Unai Emery's appointment in October 2022, and the Spaniard has brought them on the cusp of a return to European football in the 2023/24 campaign.\n\nAfter finishing 7th on the final day of last season, Villa were granted a UEFA Europa Conference League qualifier berth for 2023/24, and they secured a superb 5-0 first leg playoff win at Scottish side Hibernian, to put themselves on the brink of the group stages.\n\nThe Villans' resurgence under Emery has been eye-catching, and a return to Europe would not be unfamiliar territory for the club, despite the three seasons they spent in the Championship until 2019.\n\nMORE: European places in Premier League for 2023/24: How Champions League, Europa and Conference League are decided\n\nPremier League European places from 2022/23\n\nChampions League berths (Top 4): Man City, Arsenal, Man United, Newcastle\n\nEuropa League berths (5th & 6th place)*: Liverpool, Brighton\n\nConference League qualifying berth (7th place): Aston Villa\n\n*West Ham also qualified for the 2023/24 UEFA Europa League after winning the 2023 UEFA Europa Conference League.\n\nPos Team Points Matches\n\nPlayed Goals\n\nScored Goal\n\nDifference 1.

Aston Villa 61 38 51 +5\n\nWhen were Aston Villa last in Europe?\n\nVilla last competed in Europe when they participated in the UEFA Europa League in the 2010/11 season, marking the third successive campaign in which they took part in the competition.\n\nUnfortunately for Villa, their European exploits ended in August against the same opponents on both of their latter two attempts to reach the Europa League proper.\n\nRapid Vienna went through in the second leg of the playoffs at Villa Park in 2009 and 2010, winning on away goals after a 2-2 draw on their first visit and going through 4-3 on aggregate after a 3-2 win in front of almost 30,000 people a year later.\n\nVilla fared better in 2008, progressing from the group stage to set up an unsuccessful round of 32 tie against CSKA Moscow, who drew 1-1 at Villa Park before winning the return leg 2-0.\n\nHow many times have Aston Villa been in Europe?\n\nStarting with a first-round exit from the 1975-76 UEFA Cup - the predecessor to the Europa League - there have been 17 seasons when Villa have played in Europe.\n\nVilla earned a comeback 2-2 draw in the first leg of the quarterfinals of the 1977-78 competition after Johan Cruyff had scored one of Barcelona's goals at Villa Park, and they took the lead at Camp Nou before the Spanish giants produced two late replies to progress 4-3 on aggregate.\n\nBetter was to come four seasons later, when a 1-0 win over Bayern Munich in Rotterdam landed Villa the European Cup and allowed them to enter the UEFA Super Cup the following season, which they won with revenge over Barca.\n\nTheir European Cup defence ended in the quarterfinals against Juventus, and five early exits from the UEFA Cup followed between 1983 and the 1997-98 season, when they reached the quarterfinals but were beaten on away goals despite a second-leg home win over Atletico Madrid.\n\nAlongside Paris Saint-Germain and Troyes, Villa were one of three winners of the 2001 Intertoto Cup – a tournament with a reward of UEFA Cup entry, which was discontinued in 2008.\n\nSeason Competition Stage 1975-76 UEFA Cup Round one 1977-78 UEFA Cup Quarterfinals 1981-82 European Cup Winners 1982-83* European Cup Quarterfinals 1983–84 UEFA Cup Round two 1990–91 UEFA Cup Round two 1993–94 UEFA Cup Round two 1994-95 UEFA Cup Round two 1996–97 UEFA Cup Round one 1997-98 UEFA Cup Quarterfinals 1998-99 UEFA Cup Round two 2000-01 Intertoto Cup Semifinals 2001-02 UEFA Cup** Round one 2002-03 Intertoto Cup Semifinals 2008-09 Europa League*** Round of 32 2009-10 Europa League Playoffs 2010-11 Europa League Playoffs\n\n* Club also won the Super Cup and finished as Intercontinental Cup runners-up\n\n** Won the Intertoto Cup\n\n*** Qualified through Intertoto Cup"
