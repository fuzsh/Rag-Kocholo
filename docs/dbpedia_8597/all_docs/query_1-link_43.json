        "text": "The Champions League quarter-final draw has been conducted with both Arsenal and Manchester City handed glamorous ties.\n\nBy Charlie Malam\n\nLink copied Bookmark\n\nA thrilling Champions League quarter-final draw sees Arsenal - in this round of the competition for the first time since 2009-10 - take on Harry Kane's Bayern Munich. The ex-Tottenham striker will return to London to face the Gunners with the England captain looking to win the first major trophy of his career, and Arsenal chasing their first ever European Cup triumph.\n\nArsenal have lost their last three games against Bayern all 5-1, and they'll be desperate for revenge against the Germans. But the Bundesliga champions will not have any fans at the Emirates due to a UEFA ban.\n\nHolders Manchester City are reunited with 14-time winners Real Madrid in a heavyweight contest. City thrashed the Spanish giants 5-1 on aggregate in last year's semi-finals courtesy of a 4-0 victory at the Etihad, and they'll be away from home first in this tie too.\n\nTheir 4-0 rout of Los Blancos was one of the greatest Champions League performances of all time but their opponents will be hopeful of revenge. They have Jude Bellingham - one of the most in-form players in world football - in their side now.\n\nElsewhere, Barcelona - who are waving goodbye to manager Xavi at the end of the season - take on PSG, who are doing likewise with star man Kylian Mbappe. The other tie sees Borussia Dortmund travel to Atletico Madrid hoping to do what Inter Milan couldn't.\n\nRecap the Champions League quarter-final draw with Express Sport below...\n\n5 months ago11:34 Charlie Malam\n\nWhat a draw!\n\nThat's all for this blog.
