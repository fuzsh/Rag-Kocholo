        "text": "As the decade turned ten years ago, less than 18 months had passed since publication of the image that symbolised perfectly the dramatic turn in fortune at Manchester City.\n\nManager Mark Hughes, only three months into the role, pinching the corner of a blue jersey with ‘Robinho 10’ on the back, wearing an expression of almost comic incredulity; and the man himself pinching the other corner, a movie star smile plastered on his face, wearing a black t-shirt and backwards-facing black baseball cap.\n\nThe Brazilian forward, who had swapped Real Madrid for east Manchester for a British record £32.5million, paired his casual look with a grey blazer that seemed to have been plucked hastily from a cloakroom to add the necessary gravitas to the occasion.\n\nThe date was September 1, 2008, the day that Manchester City were taken over by Sheik Mansour’s Abu Dhabi United investment group; the Middle Eastern financial giant which had provided hundreds of millions of funding to Hughes and Manchester City in rapid succession, building up both the club’s squad and infrastructure to world-class levels as the new decade reared its head.\n\nAs a measure of just how much was now on offer, Robinho, who had just come off the back of a season where he had outshone a 20-year old Lionel Messi to win the La Liga title, had reportedly opted for the nouveau riche Manchester City over the comparatively old money of Chelsea.\n\nAt the end of the 2009/10 season, Manchester City celebrated their highest ‘Premier League’ finish, 5th, (the team had, of course, won the first division back in 1968), pipped to a Champions League place by Tottenham Hotspur following a winner-takes-all game in May.\n\nNone of the 11 men who started that game had been with Manchester City for longer than two years and only two - Pablo Zabaleta and Vincent Kompany by a matter of months - preceded Sheik Mansour’s investment, encapsulating just how quickly the club had transformed.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the £32.5million forward who had kickstarted the revolution back in September 2008 was back on loan at his boyhood club Santos, left behind by the pace of change in Manchester.\n\nWhen the time came for City to unveil their first set of financial results for the new decade, the club’s then chief executive, Garry Cook, acknowledged, in rather understated terms, the cost of assembling a team jam-packed with international stars: Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure, Wayne Bridge, Gareth Barry, Nigel de Jong, Craig Bellamy, Roque Santa Cruz and, the jewell in the crown, Carlos Tevez.\n\n“Manchester City Football Club is undergoing a significant transformation and our financial results for 2009/10 reflect the pace of that process through rapid and ongoing investment in our infrastructure, facilities and professional capabilities,” Cook said.\n\nAn almost perfect symmetry had been created, with Manchester City losing almost as much money as they were making in revenues. Subtracting all the costs and gains from the club’s £125million income led to a pre-tax loss of £121million. Manchester City’s £133million wage bill that season meant the club was spending £107 on wages for every £100 that was coming through the door in revenues.\n\nMeanwhile the club’s player amortisation charge - the cost of signings added together and split up over the length of the contract - had risen more than ten-fold from the £6million in 2006/07 to £71million in 2009/10.\n\nOnly Chelsea, back in Jose Mourinho’s debut season five years earlier, could boast such losses. City would go one better a year later, as they ramped up spending to levels never seen before in football. But they knew it couldn’t last forever.\n\nPLANNING FOR THE FUTURE\n\nAs the new decade began, Manchester City had a problem. It wasn’t a team, a manager or a player. It was a regulatory body.\n\nIn the preceding decade, when Real Madrid and Chelsea were outspending every team in the world to assemble the best squads, they did so without restriction. Chelsea, who had posted losses of more than £140million back in 2004/05, could have drained Roman Abramovich’s entire bank account in a single season and not faced any repercussions.\n\nNow, with a new decade set to begin, UEFA insisted that teams had to start living within their means, birthing the phrase ‘breaking even’ as a way to restrict clubs from running up huge financial losses and facing the possibility of going out of business if creditors could not be paid.\n\nWith UEFA’s new-fangled Financial Fair Play rules set to roll out from 2011/12 onwards, taking effect from the 2014/15 season, City seized the initiative to have one last splurge before pulling up the draw bridge. UEFA would begin to recognise and cap losses in 2014 and 2015 for all teams competing in UEFA competition. City knew they had to act now.\n\nIf the first two years of City’s newly-found riches had all the seeming self-control and planning of a kid in a sweet shop with his dad’s AmEx, the new decade would mark a dramatic change as the powers that be opted to build a team that could - did - compete for five years and beyond.\n\nIn came the club’s greatest ever player, David Silva, who remains to this day; Yaya Toure, who enjoyed eights years in Manchester; Aleksandar Kolarov, seven; Edin Dzeko and James Milner, five; and Mario Balotelli, who for the loss of the English game lasted only three. Jerome Boateng, who departed for Bayern Munich after a year, was a rare misstep for a team that spent the 2010s essentially trying to find a central defensive partner as good as Vincent Kompany.\n\nWhile City had come close to Chelsea 2004/05 losses a year earlier, they swept it away in 2010/11, racking up a mammoth £198million loss - or around £540,000 every single day throughout the course of the season.\n\nThe club’s wage bill had more than trebled from 2007/08, rising from £54million to £174million, on top of revenues of just £153million for 2010/11. In return, City won their first piece of silverware in 35 years, lifting the FA Cup; and claimed a first appearance in the Champions League for the coming season after finishing third.\n\nCook, who had dressed up City’s losses a year earlier, summarised the situation: “This result is consistent with the guidance provided in the first MCFC annual report that losses would peak in the 2010/11 financial year, as a result of the accelerated investment programme that the club undertook between 2008 and 2011.”\n\nBrian Marwood, City’s football administrator, was a little more forthright. “We’ve got a huge amount of work ahead of us to make sure we are sustainable,” he said.\n\nAs the decade reached its halfway point, City had grown from the promise of that fifth-placed finish back in 2010 to a team of silverware and breathtaking football.\n\nThe zenith had come in 2011/12, when on the back of new signing Sergio Aguero’s goals and quality in every position, Roberto Mancini’s City had ended the club’s 44-year wait for a first division title. Two years later, this time under Manuel Pellegrini, the club repeated the feat, scooping up a league and cup double, albeit in far less dramatic circumstances.\n\nWorth noting is that it was during this period that City upped the ante by establishing the City Football Group, in May 2013, an umbrella company that contains Manchester City in the Premier League, New York City Football Club in the MLS and Melbourne City FC of the A-League. Investments have also been made in teams in in Japan, Uruguay, Spain and China.\n\nAt the end of 2014/15, City also ended their wait for a first profit under Sheikh Mansour’s ownership. With revenues having surged to £351million for the season - they had stood at only £125million five years earlier, remember - the club was able to claim a £10million profit on its profit and loss statement.\n\nIt would be false to say spending had slowed down, more accurate to say it had decreased in velocity. After three straight £100million plus transfer net spends, City spent wisely in 2011/12, while being almost frugal a year later when they hardly reached for their wallet at all in bringing in Javi Garcia, Matija Nastastic, Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair.\n\nIt was this paucity of spending combined with that dramatic upturn in revenues that did for City in 2014/15, as the club once again ramped up proceedings between 2013 and 2015.\n\nWhat had accounted for that rise in turnover? Well, alongside their climbing broadcasting income from appearing in the Champions League and top four finishes, money earned through commercial activities, which had stood at £53million back in 2009/10, had raced ahead to £173million in 2014/15.\n\nAhead of the 2011/12 season, City had unveiled the largest commercial deal of its kind, signing a 10-year, £400million deal with Etihad Airways that changed the name of their home ground. This was an extension to the commercial ties the duo had formed back in 2009, and relationships which continue to this day.\n\nAs was expected, this didn’t simply pass under the radar. Arsene Wenger, who for years had offered broadsides to what he considered ‘financial doping’ in professional football, said the deal “raises the real question about the credibility of the Financial Fair Play.\n\n“If the Financial Fair Play is to have a chance, the sponsorship has to be at the market price. It cannot be doubled, tripled or quadrupled because that means it is better that we don't do it and we leave everybody free,” insisted Wenger, who had seen Manchester City snap up Adebayor, Kolo Toure, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy from his Arsenal side in the space of two years.\n\nManchester City’s efforts to stem the tide of their costs and raise revenues were not quite enough, however. That loss of £197million in 2010/11 had dropped to £23million in 2013/14 before a profit was recorded a year later.\n\nAt the close of the 2013/14 season, after UEFA stepped in, the club agreed to pay a £49million fine - £32million of which was suspended - while their Champions League squad was reduced for the 2014/15 season.\n\nCENTURIONS AND ALLEGATIONS\n\nThe 2015/16 season remains Manchester City’s best ever season in European football terms, as the club fell to a narrow defeat in the semi-final to eventual winners Real Madrid. But even with the near desperation to capture a European trophy, the season feels largely like a footnote now.\n\nEverything that has happened in the three-and-a-half years since Pep Guardiola arrived in town has completely overwhelmed the middle of the decade, when City stagnated, by their own impossibly high standards, under Pellegrini.\n\nAfter Guardiola suffered the ignominy of his first trophyless season as a manager in 2016/17, the club went on to produce some of the best football England has ever seen, a century of points in his second season and hands on all three domestic trophies in the third. The bottom line: three seasons, seven trophies, counting the two Community shields picked up in 2018 and 2019.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, little has changed since Mark Hughes and Roberto Mancini were handed license to sign the world’s best players earlier in the decade. City have continued to outspend as they assembled one of of the most formidable teams in the world.\n\nGoogle Manchester City’s Top 10 costliest signings and you will see 10 names that have appeared from the middle of the decade onwards: Bernardo Silva, Raheem Sterling, John Stones, Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy, Kevin de Bruyne, Aymeric Laporte, Joao Cancelo, Riyad Mahrez and - at the top of the tree - Rodri.\n\nTwo men signed by Pellegrini and eight by Guardiola, as the Catalan was handed carte blanche by the club to reshape Manchester City in his image, having been the number one managerial target for a number of years. The result: a net spend of around £600million since the 2015/16 season began.\n\nTo put that another way, Manchester City’s annual player amortisation charge - which had reached the dizzying heights of £84million by 2010/11 before actually decreasing year-on-year to £70million in 2014/15 as the club slowed its transfer spend - reads: 2015/16 £94million; 2016/17 £122million; 2017/18 £134million.\n\nBy the end of Guardiola’s third season, when final day heroics at Brighton allowed them to capture a second title in two seasons at Liverpool's expense, City earned £535million a year from revenues, second only to Manchester United (£627million). In short, revenues had more than quadrupled since that fifth-place finish back in 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, having spent more on wages than actual revenues earned just a few years earlier, City had managed to slim their wage bill to 59% of income in 2018/19, comfortably within the 70% threshold recommended by UEFA, although some staff have reportedly been outsourced to other businesses within CFG.\n\nNevertheless, this helped produce a UEFA-pleasing profit (or at least, not a loss) for the fifth season running, as City marched towards being self-sustainable. As evidence of this, not a penny of equity was provided to the club by its owners last season.\n\nCity's star continues to rise financially. Having been among the pioneers of the football docu-drama, with the All or Nothing series published last year, City’s successes were recognised on a global scale by the lucrative terms offered by PUMA in February this year.\n\nA ‘long-term deal,’ reported to be for 10 years and worth £650million in all to the City Football Group, will give Guardiola’s men further financial muscle and may also have the effect of City overtaking Manchester United in terms of revenues earned.\n\nYet as the decade ticked to a close, the club - which had of course had a run-in with UEFA over its spending five years ago - are facing scrutiny of their means of complying with UEFA’s FFP rules, allegations which continue into the new decade.\n\nA year ago, the German newspaper Der Spiegel published a four-part series on Manchester City, alleging exactly how the club had violated a series of UEFA’s FFP rules, drawing from a litany of emails and documents published by “Football Leaks.”\n\nThis was followed by another feature in March 2019, outlining “how Manchester City's owners may have used a surreptitious company in the Cayman Islands to conceal a player investment fund.” In response, UEFA opened an investigation into the club.\n\nAmong the specific allegations were that sponsorship deals were artificially inflated and not valued fairly or independent, with tens of millions of pounds actually coming directly from the club's owner; and that City under a scheme called Project Longbow set up a shell company to pay players for image rights, helping shave millions from the wage bill.\n\nGiven the complexity of the case, it’s been reported, a resolution may not be reached until the end of the current season.\n\nCity took the step over the summer of going to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne to challenge the legitimacy of UEFA’s investigation, although just this month CAS ruled against City, meaning a full hearing will go ahead.\n\nNo other team dominated the 2010s financially like Manchester City and no other team won as much silverware, either. Where the project goes in the 2020s - how much will continue to be invested, how far City will now be tasked with sustaining its own operations, what repercussions from UEFA's investigation - remains to be seen."
