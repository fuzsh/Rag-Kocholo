        "text": "After scoring five times against Real Madrid last Sunday, Barcelona sealed the Primera División Femenina title for the seventh time in their history.\n\nThis impressive achievement came after running an unbeaten streak of 24 games, all of which the Catalonians won. They wrapped up the league with six weeks left, showcasing just how dominant they have been this season.\n\nBarcelona’s impressive tally of 174 goals scored and only eight conceded in all competitions can indeed cause vertigo — the sensation someone experiences when they feel like the environment is moving or spinning around them.\n\nThe Cules achievement can only be comprehended fully if someone proceeds to a comparison with other league leaders around Europe. Olympique Lyonnais Feminin, against who Barcelona suffered their last defeat in a friendly match back in August 2021 (2-3), has scored 65 goals in 16 games. Still 69 goals less than Barca.\n\nBarcelona’s performance which attracted Xavi’s praising\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n“For several years (they) have been showing us the way with how they play, how they compete and the hunger they have despite winning everything last year” the current Barcelona’s manager Xavi, said about the women’s team’s perfect storm to the title.\n\nThe men’s team have been struggling both in and out of the pitch, with their star player Lionel Messi departing after a lifetime in the Blaugrana. Moreover, their financial debt was merely one of the reasons the 34-year-old Argentinian superstar had to transfer to PSG last summer from Barcelona.\n\n“They are leading the way in the same way as the Dream Team did in their day or as Pep Guardiola Barca side did later” the former Catalan captain stated. “They are an example for the men’s team” were his comments on the current dominant force in Spanish women’s football.\n\nBarcelona’s in-form status can break records\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nLast season, Barcelona only suffered one loss in 34 matches, ending the season with 99 points out of 102 available.\n\nAtletico Madrid ruined the ‘perfect score’, something that Alexia’s team is expected to not let happen this year. They are also just 31 goals shy of their previous league goal record, which they set in the 2020/21 season with 167 league goals.\n\nBarcelona has scored at least three goals in all league matches against any opponent this term, with Jonatan Giraldez’s scoring machine managing to thrash Sevilla with 10-1, which is their highest scoring margin so far.\n\nBarcelona: A well-oiled team with a scoring abundance\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBarcelona lead the league table by 22 points from their closest rival. Their 34 games unbeaten run is unparalleled in their history. This is not only a result of their attacking pluralism but also an outcome of a perfectly synchronised defence line.\n\nAlexia has scored 23 times in all competitions, while Asisat Oshoala leads the scoring table in the league with 19 goals so far.\n\nNevertheless, Barcelona is blessed to have 20 different goalscorers in the scoresheets with Ona Baradad being the latest to add her name to the list. Players like Lieke Martens, Jennifer Hermoso (last year’s top scorer), Fridolina Rolfö, Claudia Pina, and Aitana Bonmati have also scored more than 10 goals each, making Barca devastatingly dangerous in attack.\n\nAlexia is leading the assist tally with 14, followed by the most likely to depart from the Cules this summer, Martens who has provided one less. Both of them, lead the relevant list of assists in the league.\n\nAlthough injuries have been a constant headache for Giraldez’s plans throughout the season, 28 players have managed to register at least one appearance for the Catalan squad. Vice-captain Marta Torrejon has been a monster of consistency this year, starting 31 games and having played 2,548 minutes so far in all competitions.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBut as Sir Alex Ferguson had said: “attack wins you games, defence wins you titles.” Giraldez’s team averages just 0,24 goals per match conceded this season. In none of the 34 games so far, the goalkeeper had to pick up the ball from the back of their net more than once.\n\nThe quadruple dream\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nLast year’s UWCL winners might have already bagged the Primera División and the Super Cup. But they are chasing to bag the Copa de la Reina and the Champions League too.\n\nThey toppled Real Sociedad with three goals for the Cope de la Reina quarterfinals. And, they are facing their arch enemies, Real Madrid, again two more times in the UWCL next week. Important to note that they have won all three previous meetings against the Blancas.\n\nIf the Cules manage to win everything without losing once. Then we could actually talk about the most fierce and most impeccable team in the history of women’s football.\n\nBut even without winning every game on their way to a historic quadruple, Barcelona would become the first club to have both men’s and women’s teams win everything in a calendar year, after the men’s side did it in the 2009/10 season).\n\nMORE from Her Football Hub:"
