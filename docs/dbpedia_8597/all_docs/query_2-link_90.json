        "text": "Manchester City FC, the club closest to my heart. It's a conundrum wrapped in a riddle hidden inside Pandora's box. My relationship with MCFC was \"forced\" upon me by my dad from a very young age when growing up in Norway. My dad jumped on the bandwagon of high-flying 1968/69 City with Francis Lee, Summerbee, Bell, Young et al and he's supported them ever since, regardless of their terrible fortunes. I've been a loyal supporter myself for about two decades. I'm sure you all know that during this period the club has had quite a roller-coaster ride of relegations and promotions, take overs and general unrest.\n\nBut now thanks to Sheikh Mansour things seems to have changed at the \"small club with a small club mentality\"! We now have professional owners, but more importantly in FM10: unlimited funding. The blue sky is the limit!\n\nTo be honest, the squad you have is capable of a top 4 finish even in the first season. It's a bit unrealistic, but due to how certain players are rated on FM10 your squad is arguably better than real-life equivalent. It's already a solid (almost-)world-class squad ready to go!\n\nYour challenge clearly has to be world-domination: Europa Cup and the Champions League is begging for you to swoop in. In a few years you should aim to be on-par with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Inter and AC Milan. You should be up there, standing tall on your own as the best football team in the world.\n\nBut I personally feel you should also aim to continue the proud history that Manchester City has at bringing through quality youngsters from the Academy.\n\nAnother challenge will be to balance your squad, as clearly you need more players than just a world-class XI. You need an excellent second string XI as well as some youngster and back-up players. How will you keep all these players happy? Well you should know as you're the manager, if you don't you'll need to learn very quickly!\n\nCity of Manchester\n\nManchester is a city and metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, England. In 2007, the population of the city was 458,100. The history of Manchester began with the civilian vicus associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium, which was established circa AD 79. Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a township, but began expanding around the turn of the 19th century, brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The urbanisation of Manchester largely coincided with the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era, resulting in it becoming the world's first industrialised city. As the result of an early-19th century factory building boom, Manchester was transformed from a township into a major mill town, borough and was later granted honorific city status in 1853.\n\nManchester today is a centre of the arts, the media, higher education and commerce.\n\nI'll get it over with and just confess straight away, I've only been to Manchester once and I've never attended a game (SHOCK!). In my defense I've lived in Norway all my life and fairly recently moved to Glasgow. I do however intend to rectify this ASAP so don't worry.\n\nManchester is a busy metropolitan city that arguably might appear nicer for tourist than for residents. Overall I think Manchester is a fantastic city, the gigs they have in the MEN is almost worth it alone. The people are generally friendly and good spirited. I'd recommend a visit to the gay area of Manchester around Canal Street (not I'm not gay) which has a number of cool bars and pubs with seats outside to drink/smoke. For the geeks, this is also were you can find the Alan Turing Memorial. Arndale shopping centre has a good selection of shops, and the surrounding area contains a large number of sights and things to do.\n\nManchester City Football Club\n\nFull name: Manchester City Football Club\n\nNickname(s): The Citizens, The Blues\n\nFounded: 1880\n\nGround: City of Manchester Stadium (Capacity: 47,726)\n\nOwner: Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan\n\nChairman: Khaldoon Al Mubarak\n\nLeague: 2008/09 Premier League, 10th\n\nManchester City Football Club is an English professional football club based in the city of Manchester. They are currently members of the Premier League. The first known competitive fixture was played in November 1880, when the side was known as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they then became Ardwick A.F.C. in 1887 before changing their name to Manchester City F.C. in 1894.\n\nSince winning the League Cup in 1976, the club has failed to win any major honours. The club's decline led to relegation twice in three years in the 1990s, spending the 1998–99 season in the third tier of English football. The club has since regained top flight status, the level at which they have spent the majority of their history. Manchester City is now believed to be the wealthiest football club in the world after its purchase by the Abu Dhabi United Group in September 2008.\n\nPast Honours\n\nFirst Division/Premier League: 1936/37, 1967/68 (Runners-up: 1903/04, 1920/21, 1976/77)\n\nFA Cup: 1904, 1934, 1956, 1969 (Runners-up: 1926, 1933, 1955, 1981)\n\nLeague Cup: 1970, 1976\n\nCharity Shield: 1937, 1968, 1972\n\nEuropean Cup Winners' Cup: 1970\n\nA lot of the younger FM players might not be fully aware that during the last 60s and early 70s Man City had an absolute golden age culminating in winning the First Division, the UEFA Cup Winners Cup, FA Cup, League Cup and Charity Shield (not in the same year of course!).\n\nThey had players such as Colin Bell, Francis Lee, Mike Summerbee, Tony Book and Neil Young. The attacking triangle of Lee, Bell and Summerbee were feared all across England as they linked up beautifully and were fast, deadly and creative. Can you make Tevez, Robinho and Adebayor your new version of this attacking triangle? Or perhaps you'd like some other players?\n\nStaff\n\nManager: Mark Hughes (Soon to be replaced by you?)\n\nAssistant Manager: Mark Bowen\n\nFirst Team Coach: Eddie Niedzwiecki\n\nReserve Team Manager (Coach): Glyn Hodges\n\nGoalkeeping Coach: Kevin Hitchcock\n\nYouth Team Manager (Youth Coach): Andy Welsh\n\nChief Executive (Managing Director): Garry Cook\n\nFootball Administration Officer: Brian Marwood (Not present in game)\n\nCheif Scout (Scout): Mike Rigg\n\nHead of Under-18s Coaching: Scott Sellars (Not present in game)\n\nNaturally, you will be left with a very Welsh bunch of back-room staff but there's nothing wrong with that. Bowen is a capable assistant manager and the others aren't too bad at what they do either. Your scouts are of a fairly high quality but apart from one Brazilian (who's a bit rubbish) they're all English. You might want to sack some scouts and bring in a more international bunch. You also have eight Youth Coaches but only one real coach so I suggest rectifying this balance. Five Physios and only one Fitness Coach also seems a bit strange so this can be looked at as well.\n\nSquad\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nShay Given (GK)\n\nStuart Taylor (GK)\n\nYou're actually a little short on cover here, as Taylor isn't very good. Given is extremely solid and I personally don't see a need to replace him for the next 3-5 seasons (depending on his development of course). I'd recommend getting a young talented keeper that would be happy to be an under-study for a few years. Alternatively just snap up a 31-32 as a stop-gap. You should probably aim for Taylor to be your 3rd choice.\n\nDefenders\n\nKolo Toure (DRC)\n\nJeoleon Lescott (DC)\n\nMicha Richards (DRC)\n\nNedum Onuoha (DRC)\n\nVincent Kompany (DC/DM/MC)\n\nWayne Bridge (DL)\n\nPablo Zabaleta (D/WBR/MRC)\n\nSylvinho (DL/WBL)\n\nThe players you have are quite flexible, but perhaps you're short of a backup DC and world-class wide defenders. Bridge is fairly solid, but there is a lot better left-backs available. Micha Richards has (rightly perhaps) been downgraded slightly, but should still be able to do a job for you. I do still feel that right full-back area should be your #1 priority in terms of signings. Nedum Onuoha has a lot of promise but he's perhaps more suited for DC, and he's not really ready yet. On the bright side, his pace is blinding!\n\nToure and Lescott is a fantastic partnership and can be your first-choice centre-half pairing for years to come, but I would very strongly recommend getting one (perhaps even two) back-up quality DC as you might struggle with injuries. Vincent Kompany is a good utility-player who's injured at the start.\n\nMidfielders\n\nGareth Barry (DM/MLC)\n\nNigel de Jong (DM/MC)\n\nMichael Johnson (MC)\n\nStephen Ireland (AMRC)\n\nMartin Petrov (AML)\n\nRobinho (AML/FC)\n\nVladimir Weiss (AMR)\n\nShaun Wright-Phillips (AMR)\n\nGareth Barry is world-class, he should play every single game for you. De Jong is a very capable player as well. Ireland was quite impressive on FM09, but on FM10 he looks absolutely superb, Superman should play every week in my opinion. Now Robinho can be a problem as he's not very consistent and you have to figure out how to play him and where (ML/AML/AMC/ST). There's not one easy solution here, all I will say is if you get him to play he can be fantastic for you! Petrov is a decent backup, and Bellamy can also play here. On the right side of the pitch you can, if you want, play Tevez. SWP of course is very solid, he usually performs a lot better than his attributes would suggest. Vladimir Weiss is in your reserve team, I suggest you promote him to the first team as this kid has quite a lot of potential. Play him for cup games and other insignificant games and he should develop nicely for you. Michael Johnson is injured so hard to make a judgment on him from the demo, but it's safe to say he'll never be world-class in FM10.\n\nForwards\n\nEmmanuel Adebayor (ST)\n\nCarlos Tevez (FC)\n\nCraig Bellamy (FC)\n\nRoque Santa Cruz (ST)\n\nBenjani Mwaruwari (ST)\n\nWell what can I say about our strike force? Adebayor and Tevez are terrific on FM10, very effective and free-scoring. They make a great tall target-man & short work-horse partnership! Bellamy has been upgraded on FM10 but he's still not fantastic, I'd say he's decent now. He's OK for back-up and exactly the same can be said about Roque Santa Cruz (RSC) to be fair. Perhaps it wouldn't exactly hurt to get rid of Benjani and replace him with a young striker with actual talent...\n\nPlayers Out\n\n(Most important transfers, not complete...)\n\nTransfers\n\nElano- Galatasary (£6.2m)\n\nRichard Dunne - Aston Villa (£6.0m)\n\nDaniel Sturridge - Chelsea (compensation not decided yet)\n\nChed Evans - Sheffield United (£3.1m)\n\nGelson Fernandes - St. Etienne (£3.1m)\n\nKasper Schmeichel - Notts County (£1.6m)\n\nLoans\n\nJoe Hart (Birmingham), Shaleum Logan (Tranmere Rovers), Kelvin Etuhu (Cardiff City), Valeri Bojinov (Parma), Felipe Caicedo (Sporting CP), Jô (Everton)\n\nReleased\n\nMichael Ball, Tal Ben-Haim, Glauber Berti, Didi Hamann, Danny Mills, Daniel Sturridge, Darius Vassell\n\nIt's safe to say MCFC had a massive clear-out of players. Almost all of Sven's purchases have been cleared out, plus some other players that perhaps Mark Hughes didn't feel was up for the challenge. Nobody will be greatly missed in FM10, although Fernandes and Elano were OK, they were rarely exceptional. Jo was horribly erratic but could turn out brilliant on a few rare saves. Dunne was of course very solid in FM09, but in return you have Toure and Lescott who's arguably of a higher quality. Sturridge usually turns out alright, but shouldn't be spoken about...\n\nBudget and Signings\n\nI feel you more than anything need to get a good reliable right full-back so that Richards or Zabaleta can be your back-up. The same also goes for left full-back although Bridge isn't too bad it wouldn't hurt to get a new first-choice. Then you might consider a back-up striker especially if you play two or more strikers as Bellamy and RSC are only decent. Your squad is actually got small so if you have money left you could look at a new central defender or a central midfielder (or both).\n\nTransfer Budget:\n\nContinental Qualification Through League Finish: £55m for transfers, £2m for wages\n\nTitle Challenge: £73m for transfers, £2.3m for wages\n\nWinner: £79m for transfers, £2.3m for wages\n\nI'd recommend going for Title Challenge as you get a lot more money and it's a fairly realistic goal. Actually the transfer budget seems a bit short, but we're spoiled now after the take-over. Also keep in mind that players like Tevez, Adebayor, Barry were bought in this transfer window in real life so you already have them.\n\nRecommended Signings: (season one)\n\nDarijo Srna- Shaktar (£15m - 20m), exceptionally versitile player with some fantastic skills. Lethal on dead-balls and penalties as well. Can cover DL/DR/ML/MR.\n\nArtem Milevskiy- Dinamo Kiev (£10m - 15m), it won't hurt to have a quality backup striker and this guy is excellent. A very technical player, who much like Ibrahimvic has an eye for exceptional goals.\n\nEdin Dzeko- Wolfsburg (£15m - 20m), finally this guy has been done justice by the German researchers. He's world-class at the start of the game and will only get better and better. His main strenghts are heading and jumping but he's also a good all-rounder. As he's not fully developed yet you can easily shape him with training.\n\nJuan Manuel Vargas- Fiorentina (£15m - 20m), not entirely comfortable with Wayne Bridge? Well this guy is absolutely fantastic. He can play fullback, wingback and even left midfield with excellent defensive and attacking stats. He'll roam up and down the left-hand side without leaving himself too exposed.\n\nNicolas Otamendi- Velez (£5m - 7.5m), supposedly the next big thing to come out of South America and in FM10 this is reflected. Should be happy to be backup for a season or two until he matures a bit. Exceptionally talented centre-back which due to his PA is absolutely certain to become world class (think Sakho in FM09). He is incredibly strong with excellent tackling, anticipation and speed.\n\nLong-term Targets\n\nPhillip Lahm- Bayern Munich (£15m - 30m), quite possibly the best full-back in the game and he can play both sides! A complete player that defends and attacks with equal skill.\n\nLionel Messi- Barcelona (£40m - 100m), do I really need to say anything about Messi? I'm sure Tevez would like a to have a fellow Argentinian and this is as good as they come regardless of nationality! You'll have to aim at becoming mega-successful and keep courting him and befriending Barcelona, eventually you'll get him! Play him on the right so he can cut in as he's left-footed.\n\nYaya Toure- Barcelona (£40m - 60m), bring in Kolo's brother so they can finally play together! Might not want to join you first season though... A fantastic and powerful DMC, a couple of notches better than De Jong!\n\nGiorgio Chiellini - Juventus (£70 - 120m), aside from John Terry this is the best defender in the game and he's only 25 years old. The term \"defensive rock\" would be insulting towards Chiellini. He won't join you season one, but as soon as you play in the Champions League he'll be interested. The only problem is Juventus does absolutely not want to let him go so the price you end up paying is rather insane.\n\n(Subject to change as more gets known about who's the \"super-players\" hidden in the FM10 database.)\n\nKey Player (in my opinion)\n\nGareth Barry - DMC/MLC\n\nAn ex-England under-18 captain, Barry joined Aston Villa from Brighton and Hove Albion as a trainee in 1997 along with Michael Standing. As of April 2008, Barry, approaching 400 total appearances for Aston Villa, was the longest serving player in the team. During the league game against Bolton Wanderers on 28 October 2007, Barry became the youngest player to appear in 300 Premier League games (aged 26 years 247 days), replacing former record-holder Frank Lampard. In May 2008, Liverpool made a series of bids to buy Barry, all of which were rejected by Aston Villa.\n\nOn 2 June 2009, Barry signed a five-year contract with Manchester City for a fee of £12 million. Many Aston Villa fans publicly criticised Barry for this move considering his alleged desire to play in the UEFA Champions League. However, Barry responded to this positively claiming that his move to City was for a \"new challenge\". Barry scored his first Premier League goal for City in the Manchester derby versus United on 20 September.\n\nA star player of absolute quality who will command and control your midfield for many years to come. He's got very evenly spread attributes much like Gerrard and Lampard, as such he can be considered one of the few proper box-to-box midfielders in FM10. He defends your back line, he's got beautiful passes, and he'll even chip in with the occasional goal. With very high Influence, Team Work and Composure he's an ideal captain candidate. Barry can also play on ML as he's pretty good at crossing as well. However I'd recommend playing him at MC or DMC as a box-to-box midfielder, possibly a play-maker as well if you like.\n\nBest Senior Player (per assistant manager)\n\nCarlos Tevez - ST\n\nAlthough not the most prolific goal-scorer, Tévez is well-known for his work ethic and never-say-die attitude. He has previously played for Boca Juniors, Corinthians, West Ham United, and most notably for Manchester United. He transferred to Manchester City in the 2009–10 summer transfer window, becoming the first player to move between the two Manchester clubs since 1999. He has made 51 appearances for the Argentina national team, scoring 8 goals. He was described by Diego Maradona as the \"Argentine prophet for the 21st century\". Tévez first came into prominence with Argentina while playing in the FIFA U-17 World Championship. At the 2004 Olympic Games, he won the gold medal and scored eight goals (including the winner in the final) in six matches to be the top scorer of the competition. He was the world's second-highest goalscorer of 2004 in overall international competition with sixteen goals.\n\nTévez and his wife, Vanesa, have a daughter, Florencia. He performs as the frontman for his cumbia villera musical group, Piola Vago, with his brother Diego. The group's most successful hit, \"Lose Your Control,\" charted in Argentina.\n\nMuch like real life, he'll run until he hits the ground then get up and run some more. His Team Work, Work Rate, Stamina and Determination attributes are only rivalled by Kuyt and Olic in FM10. In FM he's always been a lot more prolific than in real life, regularly banging in goals and it's not uncommon for him to get hat-tricks. I love this player, he scores consistently and puts in a real shift for you. Tevez doesn't get injured or loses fitness much either so you can depend on him. You simply have to play him every single game that he's fit to play!\n\nBest Young Player\n\nVladimir Weiss - AMRC\n\nVladimir Weiss (born 30 November 1989) is a Slovakian footballer, currently playing for Manchester City. He plays in midfield, mainly as an attacking midfielder. The 19-year-old shot to prominence in the 2007-08 season when he was one of the star performers in the Blues FA Youth Cup triumph. He scored in the second leg of the final in which City beat Chelsea 3-1 to secure a 4-2 aggregate victory.\n\nBratislava-born Vlad is a right winger with plenty of tricks in his repertoire. It is not surprising he has made his way in the game for football runs in the family. Dad Vladimir senior is currently the coach of the Slovakian national side. Vlad, meanwhile, is now featuring at senior international level and is pushing for a place off the bench for the Blues' first team.\n\nWeiss is actually stuck in your reserves as he's 19 years old now, but I recommend you promptly promote him to your first team. He's been given a good Potential Ability this year so he will most likely become Premier League quality if you give him a chance. Play him in a couple of insignificant games against Hull/Wolves or some cup games. His attributes are quite reasonable from the start, but he might not be ready to replace SWP straight away. Which is OK as SWP should have a good few years left in those speedy legs of his. Vlad is a lot more of a techincal inside winger than the typical wide winger like SWP.\n\nSquad Tactics\n\nWe all heard the \"reports\" in the media about MCFC at one point having ten strikers, which strictly speaking wasn't true. But I'd still say that the squad might be a little top heavy. You might need to give special consideration to Tevez and Robinho, even though they can perform as central forwards, they both excel when playing as an attacking winger (AML/AMR). Therefore you should consider playing a 4-1-2-2-1/4-2-3-1 with wingers as shown below.\n\nPossible Starting XI\n\nAlternative you can choose to play Robinho as a ML (where he also performs well, but seems to not score very often), and Tevez as a ST (he can be prolific in this position if given the right instructions). You can then play a flat 4-4-2 with SWP on MR instead of De Jong as DMC...\n\nIf you feel that our fullbacks might be the weak link of the team, you could try playing a 3-4-3 or even 3-5-2 which could be very interesting in the Premier League!\n\nAt the end of the day, the squad is very flexible, so feel free to try something else than the standard flat 4-4-2. Regardless of formation, I personally feel you should aim for a quick passing game with counter-attack.\n\nAs a fan I don't know if I can do it myself, but I suspect a lot of people will brutally drop/sell Robinho to bring in someone more prolific, consistent and less moody player. It's all up to you of course, but I personally feel he brings that creative spark and ability to break through well organized defensive teams like Fulham.\n\nI believe I touched upon this a bit further up, but Adebayor and Tevez is an absolutely fantastic strike partnership. Adebayor is tall, strong and able to hold up the ball but still has a wicked finish. Tevez is extremely hard working, technical and fairly fast. Perfect tall/short partnership which works excellently in a 4-4-2. It also works with Tevez and Robinho on the wings with Adebayor in the middle.\n\nAlmost regardless of your formation, the point is you should (IMHO) set Adebayor to hold up play, target-man as well if you like. In addition to Tevez and Robinho on fairly free/creative instructions this should get you loads of goals!\n\nFinally...\n\nAs always, any comments/corrections/feedback more than welcome, don't hesitate to get involved!\n\nBut most importantly load up a game as the mighty Manchester City Football Club! Share your experiences, your best buys, your highs and lows and everything else."
