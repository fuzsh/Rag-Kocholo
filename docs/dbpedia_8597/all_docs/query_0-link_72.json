        "text": "Unai Emery’s impact at Premier League side Aston Villa has been nothing short of remarkable. The Basque coach took over at Villa Park in November 2022 with the club languishing above the relegation zone. The new managers impact was immediate as Villa put together an amazing run which saw the Villains winning fifteen of their twenty-five league games and secure 49 points from a possible 75 since his appointment.\n\nThe Irun born coach eventually took Villa to the club’s highest finish in the Premier League since the 2010–11 season with their seventh place finish enough to secure qualification to the UEFA Europa Conference League, the club’s first participation in European football since the 2010–11 season.\n\nWith just eight games remaining in the 2023-24 Premier League season, Villa sit in fourth place and are two points ahead of fifth placed Tottenham with the Villains facing a tricky away trip on Wednesday as they face Man City at the Etihad.\n\nVilla in Europe\n\nAs things stand, short of end of season implosion, the 2023-24 campaign under Emery has been even better for the Villa Park faithful as the team are on the cusp of securing a Champions League place for the first time in the club’s long history (Villa are former European Cup winners in 1982, but have never progressed to the UCL since its inception and are one of just six English clubs to lift European football’s greatest trophy) and face Lille in the quarterfinals of the 23-24 Conference League."
