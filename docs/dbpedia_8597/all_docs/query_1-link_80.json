        "text": "TNT Sports pundit Rio Ferdinand admits he fears for Arsenal's Premier League title challenge - if they get knocked out of Europe this week.\n\nThe Gunners have lost top spot in England after a shock 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa at the weekend.\n\nThat result came hot on the heals of a 2-2 draw against Bayern Munich in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League quarter-final tie.\n\nEuro 2024\n\nWill Palmer start for England at Euro 2024? Ferdinand, Crouch, Hargreaves debate...\n\n07/06/2024 at 14:04\n\nFerdinand says if Mikel Arteta's side fail to respond in the return fixture, live on TNT Sports and discovery+ on Wednesday, April 17, it may have a long-term impact.\n\n\"I think this game coming up is a huge game,\" he told TNT Sports.\n\n\"Listen, they're all big at this stage, but if they lose this game and go out of the Champions League, their confidence is lower than it's been probably since Arteta came to the football club.\n\n\"They'll have to go a lot to rebuild that in a short space of time to get themselves back going. We talk about momentum at this stage. You need to keep it, so tomorrow is so vital for them.\n\n\"Their defenders and the team looked more shaky than we've seen them this season, and this is the most critical part of the season.\n\n\"It's the run in; the final run in to where the trophies are handed out. You need to be at your most composed. I really hope for their sake that they can make things right this week.\"\n\nThis is the first time Arsenal have reached the Champions League quarter-finals since 2009-10.\n\nThey are also looking to end a 20-year wait to lift the Premier League.\n\nThe Gunners face a tough proposition in Bayern though, given their opponents won their most recent of their six European Cups in 2020.\n\nThey can draw confidence from the fact Thomas Tuchel's side are struggling domestically, and will fail to finish top of the Bundesliga for the first time in 12 years.\n\nTNT Sports pundit Peter Crouch believes that means the German side are under huge pressure themselves.\n\n\"Bayern are in the same situation,\" he said. \"I know it's only two points with Manchester City, but you just feel like they're not going to drop any points.\n\n\"So it feels like a huge blow, the weekend against Aston Villa. If they go out to Bayern, that's going to be an awful week for them, but Bayern are in the same situation.\n\n\"They kind of have win the Champions League, or get to the final, because certainly at Bayern, the fans don't tolerate not winning something.\"\n\n- - -\n\nTNT Sports presents the premium live sports rights previously carried by BT Sport including the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Conference League, Gallagher Premiership Rugby, Investec Champions Cup, EPCR Challenge Cup, MotoGP, Cricket, UFC, Boxing and WWE.
