        "text": "This weekend’s biggest Premier League fixture is a meeting between last season’s top two: Arsenal and Manchester City. City won the league title in 2022-23 after Arsenal spent much of the season in first place. Arguably the main thing that cost Mikel Arteta’s side were results in that season’s two head-to-head matches, in February and April.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side beat Arsenal 3-1 at the Emirates before winning 4-1 at the Etihad to take all six points from the two encounters. That seemed particularly crucial by the end of the season when City ended up five points clear of Arsenal. A simple conclusion is that, if Mikel Arteta wants to topple his old boss and win the title, Arsenal must take points off City.\n\nBut how often are matches between the top two actually crucial in determining the destination of the league title? Based on the evidence from 31 Premier League campaigns, perhaps it’s less relevant than you might think.\n\nAssessing this is surprisingly difficult — you have to take into account the results between the two sides, the eventual points gap, and therefore how the full range of the possible 12-point swing could have affected things.\n\nOf course, the final points table doesn’t always reflect how comfortably a team won the title (if they wrapped things up with games to spare) and the final top two aren’t always the sides who truly challenged for the title (on a couple of occasions, title contenders have been pipped to second place on the final day).\n\nBut what follows is the data, based on the sides who finished as champions and runners-up. First, here are the points hauls earned by the top two from the 31 seasons of head-to-head fixtures.\n\nThere are a few striking things here: how often the runners-up won the head-to-head battles in the early years and how rare City’s double last year was, only the sixth time the champions have twice defeated the runners-up.\n\nBelow is a slightly more complex chart. It shows how the points gap between first and second could have changed each season according to the results of the head-to-head clashes.\n\nEach of the lines joining the coloured dots represents the 12-point swing possible according to the outcome of those two matches (going from six points gained to six points gained for the opposition).\n\nThe left axis is the points gap between first and second, with the yellow dots marking the actual points gap between the top two teams. For example, it was 10 points between first and second in 1992-93.\n\nThe red dots show what the points gap would have been if the champions had won both head-to-heads. The blue dots show what the points gap would have been if the runners-up had won both head-to-heads.\n\nWhen the blue dot is below the dotted line representing a zero-points gap, that means the title could have swung the other way if the runners-up had recorded better results in those games.\n\nSo take 2009-10, for example. Champions Chelsea won both head-to-head matches against Manchester United, so the final points gap was one point in their favour. If Manchester United had won both the games, they would have won the league by 11 points. Or look at 2017-18 when runners-up Manchester United took three points from six against Manchester City, but even if they had taken all six and City had got none, City would still have won the league by a mile.\n\nTherefore, there are basically seven different types of outcome from the head-to-head clashes. Here are the seven categories.\n\n1) Honours even but it didn’t really matter in the end\n\nNine occasions: 2000-01, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2010-11, 2012-13, 2014-15, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2019-20\n\nThe most common outcome of matches between the Premier League’s top two is somewhat boring: (a) Neither side gains a points advantage from the two games; and (b) Even a full six points for the eventual runners-up wouldn’t have swung things their way.\n\nThere are two different ways the points can be split evenly, of course — two draws, as happened in 2004-05 with Arsenal and Chelsea, or with both sides winning a game each.\n\nStill, sometimes there’s still entertainment value to be had here, even if the results aren’t truly decisive.\n\nManchester United’s legendary 6-1 thrashing of Arsenal in 2001 avenged a 1-0 defeat at Highbury, for example, and United’s come-from-behind 3-2 victory over Manchester City in April 2018 denied City the chance to clinch the title in style that day.\n\nConversely, while Chelsea lost 1-0 away to Manchester United in November 2005, they sealed the title with a 3-0 victory over their closest rivals at Stamford Bridge in April. But that was the icing on the cake — they would have won the title regardless of their results against United.\n\n2) “That’s the real quiz”\n\nSeven occasions: 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95, 1996-97, 2008-09, 2015-16, 2020-21\n\nThese are the occasions when the second-placed side recorded the better head-to-head record but it wasn’t enough for them to win the title.\n\nThis, somewhat surprisingly, happened in each of the first three Premier League campaigns. Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers took four points from Manchester United in 1992-93 and 1993-94 respectively, at a time when Alex Ferguson was getting criticism for tinkering with his side too much in big matches. United were on the other side of things the next season, defeating Blackburn twice, but finishing one point short after dropping points away at West Ham on the final day.\n\nThe 1996-97 season featured the most classic single result of this genre: Newcastle’s devastating, memorable 5-0 thrashing of the Manchester United side who had just beaten them to the title the previous season and would do so again that season. By the time of the goalless draw at Old Trafford in May, the title was already settled and Newcastle were forced to give their opponents a guard of honour.\n\nThe best example of a runner-up doing the double over the champions is 2008-09, when Rafael Benitez’s Liverpool twice defeated Manchester United, including a famous 4-1 win at Old Trafford. Benitez’s sides tended to perform well on big occasions and then drop points at home to smaller clubs, which cost them.\n\nThe 2015-16 season was a funny campaign in many ways, not least because Leicester won the title. They did so with a 10-point margin over Arsenal, despite losing to them twice, which means Claudio Ranieri’s side collected fully 16 points more than Arsenal over their other 36 fixtures.\n\nFinally, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign at Manchester United was characterised by confusion about the side’s philosophy, he was generally very good at setting up sides against stronger opponents. When City won the title in the behind-closed-doors 2020-21 campaign, Solskjaer’s side drew 0-0 with the eventual champions then beat them 2-0 in the reverse fixture at the Etihad.\n\n3) A crucial 12-point swing\n\nSix occasions: 1995-96, 1997-98, 2003-04, 2009-10, 2011-12, 2022-23\n\nThere have, slightly surprisingly, only been six occasions when the title winners have done the double over the second-placed side.\n\nWhat’s more surprising is that, on five of these occasions, the title was won by five or fewer points (which has only happened 13 times overall). In other words, there’s almost a reverse correlation between dominating the rest of the league and dominating against the runners-up.\n\nThe exception to the rule is Arsenal’s Invincibles campaign of 2003-04 — they won the league by a solid 11 points having taken their foot off the gas towards the end of the campaign and also defeated second-placed Chelsea twice.\n\nBut usually, a ’12-pointer’ is crucial in the title winners edging their noses in front.\n\nThe starkest example is unquestionably 2011-12 when Manchester City won the title on goal difference from Manchester United courtesy of Sergio Aguero’s last-minute winner against Queens Park Rangers. Equally crucially, they famously beat United 6-1 at Old Trafford and then, with three games remaining, won a tight 1-0 at the Etihad, settled by Vincent Kompany’s header. Their two victories didn’t simply ensure the 12-point swing was in their favour but also produced a 12-goal goal difference swing. They won the title by eight goals.\n\nOther notable occasions include 1995-96, when Manchester United beat Newcastle 2-0 at home and then 1-0 away, thanks to some Peter Schmeichel heroics and a late Eric Cantona winner.\n\nTwo years later, Arsenal triumphed twice over Ferguson’s side, with David Platt nodding a late winner in a 3-2 win at Highbury, then Marc Overmars rounding off a sublime individual performance in a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.\n\nAnother notable example was 2009-10 because both of Chelsea’s wins over Manchester United were extremely tight: 1-0 at home, 2-1 away, with refereeing controversies dominating the aftermath of both games.\n\nBut the most pertinent example is last season. Again, it’s worth pointing out that City wrapped up the title before the final day, but ultimately the 12-point swing in their favour courtesy of two victories over Arsenal proved crucial.\n\n4) Honours even — and it mattered\n\nFour occasions: 2006-07, 2007-08, 2013-14, 2021-22\n\nIn 2021-22, Manchester City finished just one point ahead of Liverpool and both head-to-head meetings between the sides were absolute thrillers — 2-2 at Anfield, 2-2 at the Etihad. A win in either game would have clinched Liverpool the title and while we tend to remember knockout blows and decisive victories more than draws, those matches were probably the highest quality “title deciders” the Premier League has seen.\n\nIt was effectively the same situation in 2006-07, albeit in much less entertaining fashion. Manchester United and Chelsea drew 1-1 and 0-0 in the lowest-scoring Premier League season. Two victories for Chelsea would have won them the league. The following season, the same teams finished in the same positions, but this time with a victory apiece. Chelsea’s 2-1 win over United in the third-last game of the season put them level on points, although Ferguson’s side had an almost unassailable goal-difference advantage.\n\nThe 2013-14 season featured a relatively low-key win for City over Liverpool on Boxing Day, when Brendan Rodgers’ side were barely considered title challengers. After a superb run of form in the new year, Liverpool produced an excellent performance to win 3-2 over City at Anfield in April in arguably the best-ever Premier League game. That win seemingly put them on course for the title — only for them to subsequently lose to a second-string Chelsea side.\n\n5) One significant win\n\nThree occasions: 2001-02, 2002-03, 2018-19\n\nOn three occasions, the champions have recorded a win and a draw against the runners-up. In 2001-02, it was something of an anomaly, as Liverpool squeezed into second place on the final day, but Arsenal’s main challengers that season had been Manchester United (who they defeated at Old Trafford to clinch the title).\n\nThe next season, Manchester United recorded a 2-0 win over Arsenal and then played out a superb 2-2 draw at Highbury to maintain their lead in the table. They won the league by five points, so that first ‘six-pointer’ proved crucial.\n\nThe 2018-19 season was more memorable. Manchester City and Liverpool drew 0-0 at Anfield before City recorded a narrow 2-1 win over Liverpool, with John Stones’ brilliant goal-line clearance essentially the difference between the sides by the end of the season, as City won the league by a single point.\n\n6) One win that wasn’t needed anyway\n\nOne occasion: 1999-2000\n\nMaybe the least interesting situation. In 1999-2000, Manchester United got four from a possible six points against Arsenal in a season when they eventually won the league by 18 points anyway. The win wasn’t crucial, they didn’t record a rare double over the runners-up, but nor did Arsenal manage any kind of consolation by beating the eventual champions. Boring.\n\n7) What might have been…\n\nOne occasion: 1998-99\n\nThere has been only one season in the Premier League where the second-placed side got the upper hand over the title winners, winning four points from them, but where a full six points would have won the title.\n\nThat was Arsenal, the year after their first Premier League title (when they beat Manchester United home and away). This time, they convincingly defeated United 3-0 at Highbury, including a goal on debut for Freddie Ljungberg.\n\nThe return meeting, at a dreadfully wet Old Trafford in February, was an underrated classic, with chances at both ends. Dwight Yorke missed a penalty for United before Nicolas Anelka opened the scoring for the away side. Then, Andy Cole headed an equaliser against an Arsenal defence that would only concede 17 goals all season.\n\nIt’s not a game that is mentioned much in the context of the famous rivalry between these sides, or when speaking about great title battles over the years, but that result was crucial and Cole’s goal is among the most important of the Premier League era.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhich teams have won the English top flight three times in a row?\n\n(Top photo: Catherine Ivill via Getty Images)"
