The 21-year-old embodied the club's new emphasis on youth and seemed to relish the responsibility, his performances in 2009/10, when he contributed 15 goals and 13 assists in the Premier League, earning him a place in the PFA Team of the Year. Cambridge United grabbed the headlines as their dreams of creating a fairytale came true, Joe Ironside mirroring his hero Alan Shearer by scoring the winner against Newcastle at St James' Park. Lloris, who has been linked with a move to the MLS, could talk to foreign clubs in January, but Conte is planning to sit down with the Frenchman soon. It is pretty unlikely that once you have it, that it stays with three players - maybe [it spreads to] another three or four, then you have 13 players available to play on the 26th and 28th and that is impossible, he told BBC Match of the Day. The length of time John took to give the penalty gave me encouragement that he wasn't going to give it because it was unusual. One source told Sky Sports News Coutinho would have been open to return to Liverpool this month but the Merseyside club were not pursuing a move for him in January. I am not a fan of absolute freedom, I think that is an easy way to coach - 'Go on lads, go and do it, express yourself' - there has to be a plan. Washington says: Football has been massively important in dealing with the difficult stuff that comes through transition, and building a new social circle, being on the pitch for a while and forgetting everything else that's going on, having some time away. It was the Leicester winger's first goal in the Premier League since February (v Aston Villa), ending a run of nine appearances in the competition without scoring. With hostility pouring from the stands, Milan kept attacking. Their captain Franco Baresi transmitted calm and belief as they searched for a winner. Every time he came out with the ball at his feet, the flames of hell made way, writes Sacchi. But an exhausted Milan could not score again and, with an aggregate score of 2-2, the tie went to penalties. The Premier League champions have been without midfielders Kevin De Bruyne, Jack Grealish and Phil Foden for recent games due to coronavirus, in the Belgian's case, and knocks for the England pair. Jackson: Kyogo has raised expectationsPostecoglou: I need to win trophies nowSky Sports News understands Celtic are targeting moves for Japanese trio Daizen Maeda, Reo Hatate and Yosuke Ideguchi.

Our coach also needs to try to figure out how to get the most out of Ozil. But he doesn't expect to have that title for any sort of extended period, with Harry Kane closing in with 48 goals of his own. While West Ham remain fifth in the Premier League, they have now played one more game than Manchester United in fourth. They trail Ralf Rangnickâs side by a point, with their top-four rivals travelling to Elland Road to face Leeds on Sunday. They always seem to turn a corner at some stage of the season, even when they start badly, and they will be full of confidence now after their recent results.

But that approach jarred with Solskajer's desire to replicate the front-foot attitude of United's great teams of the past - and some of his worst defeats came when they tried to be protagonists. Gallagher played in that game, England U21s won that, and now because of injuries and the fact the next U21 game is a friendly against Georgia, this is seen as a perfect opportunity to bring him into the senior squad. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has said the academy graduate is not affected in the moment by too much praise or by the pressure that can arise with spectators and that he is a calm guy, very focused and knows what he wants.

But by choosing him, Juventus secured a player of the highest level who was much appreciated both on and off the pitch. What was the view in Italy on him as a player and his time at Arsenal?FC: There was a clear awareness of what his path at Arsenal had been. He is so good that maybe you miss a little bit of the footballer player. He is a team player of great quality, without the ball and with the ball. Recent battles between the two have proven more dramatic but this was as comfortable as Liverpool could have hoped for and reaffirmed their title challenge."
