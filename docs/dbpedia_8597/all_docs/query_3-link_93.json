        "text": "The Premier League has charged Manchester City with breaching its financial rules on more than 100 occasions following a four-year investigation.\n\nA statement issued by the Premier League on Monday explained that City's alleged breaches had taken place between the start of the 2009/10 season and the end of the 2017/18 campaign.\n\nThe EPL claims that City failed to provide \"a true and fair view of the club's financial position, in particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs\".\n\nAdditional breaches are said to relate to rules requiring full details of \"manager remuneration\" between 2009/10 and 2012/13 when Roberto Mancini was in charge of the first team.\n\nThis was not the first investigation into City's compliance with financial regulations.\n\nIn February 2020 the club received a £25 million fine and a two-year ban from competing in the Champions League after being found to have seriously misled European soccer's governing body, UEFA, and broken financial fair play rules between 2013 and 2016.\n\nHowever, that ban was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, while the fine was lowered upon appeal to £9m.\n\nThe Premier League's investigation into City's financial affairs will now be passed onto an independent commission.\n\n\"Commissions are independent of the Premier League and member clubs,\" explained Monday's EPL statement.\n\n\"The members of the Commission will be appointed by the independent Chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel, in accordance with Premier League Rules W.19, W.20 and W.26.\n\n\"The proceedings before the Commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the Commission’s final award will be published on the Premier League’s website.\n\n\"This confirmation is made in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1. The Premier League will be making no further comment in respect of this matter until further notice.\"\n\nShould City be found guilty, possible punishments include fines, points deductions and/or expulsion from the Premier League.\n\nCity won the Premier League title three times during the period the charges relate to.\n\nShortly after news of the charges against City broke on Monday, the club responded via an official 79-word statement.\n\nIt read: \"Manchester City FC is surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules, particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with.\n\n\"The Club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent Commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position.\n\n\"As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.\""
