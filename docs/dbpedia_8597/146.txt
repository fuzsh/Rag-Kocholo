The 2009–10 season was Manchester United's 18th season in the Premier League, and their 35th consecutive season in the top division of English football. Having equalled Liverpool's record of 18 English league titles the previous season, Manchester United were looking to break that record with an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title in 2009–10, but they were ultimately beaten to the title by Chelsea by a single point. They also had the chance to be the first team to reach three consecutive Champions League finals since Juventus in 1998, but they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Bayern Munich.

On 3 January 2010, United were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round after a surprise 1–0 home defeat to fierce rivals Leeds United, who were in League One. This was their first exit in the competition at this stage since 1984. Despite this, they won the League Cup for the second season in a row, beating Aston Villa 2–1 at Wembley on 28 February. In doing so, they became the first club to successfully defend the trophy since Nottingham Forest in 1990, and the third club to do so overall, after Forest (1989 and 1990) and Liverpool (1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984). Their fourth League Cup title and their third in five years, it was the first time in the club's history that they successfully defended a major cup.
