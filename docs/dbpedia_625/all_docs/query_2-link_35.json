        "text": "Sources of morphological variation (dimorphism, individual variability, ontogeny, and pathology) can obfuscate taxonomic variation. This is true for Late Cretaceous nodosaurid ankylosaurs, for which several complete, well-preserved skulls and postcrania are known. Although a generalized taxonomy has been accepted for about 25 years, new specimens show mixtures of features considered diagnostic for more than one taxon. Because these taxa are well-accepted and overlap temporally and geographically, they are good candidates for testing intraspecific variation in dinosaurs. This was done by quantitatively testing taxonomic characters a priori with bivariate and clustering analyses. A character-specimen matrix was coded for a parsimony analysis to aid in taxonomic referrals. Because many phylogenetic characters are based on relative proportions or shapes, taphonomic distortion is problematic for this group. Nevertheless, four taxa are valid: Edmontonia longiceps, E. rugosidens, Panoplosaurus mirus, and Denversaurus schlessmani, the latter two more derived. Compared to contemporaneous North American ankylosaurids, nodosaurid taxa do not correlate as well with their stratigraphic distribution. A posteriori character analysis reveals that Panoplosaurus has a shortened skull and rounded cervical/pectoral osteoderms. Denversaurus and Panoplosaurus share inflated cranial sculpturing with visible sulci between individual elements. Denversaurus has a relatively wider anterior snout. The clade shows some overall evolutionary trends: doming of the skull over the orbits, thickening of the vomer and closure of prevomer foramen, encroachment of sculpturing over the anterior temporal bar, shortening and widening of the snout, etc. Use of proportional character data is common in dinosaur systematics, often subjectively. This study demonstrates that quantitatively testing such characters increases their repeatability and clarifies taxonomic decisions.\n\nDinosaur diversity is analyzed in terms of the number of valid genera within each major clade, Mesozoic age, place of discovery and year of description. Aves (Archaeopteryx + Neornithes) is excluded. Nomina nuda and nomina dubia are not counted. The results show 451 valid dinosaurian genera at the end of 2001, of which 282 are saurischian (112 sauropodomorphs and 170 theropods, including 93 coelurosaurs) and 169 ornithischian, including 11 pachycephalosaurs, 26 ceratopsians, 60 ornithopods, 12 stegosaurs, and 38 ankylosaurs. Thirty-eight genera arose in the Triassic, 124 in the Jurassic, and 289 in the Cretaceous, of which a disproportionately high number — 85 and 47 — are from the Campanian and Maastrichtian. The Kimmeridgian was the most productive age, with an average of 11.18 new genera per million years. The Kimmeridgian saw an unparalleled boom in sauropod diversity, with 20 new sauropod genera arising in its 3.4 million years, an average of one new sauropod every 170,000 year...\n\n—Morphological responses of nonmammalian herbivores to external ecological drivers have not been quantified over extended timescales. Herbivorous nonavian dinosaurs are an ideal group to test for such responses, because they dominated terrestrial ecosystems for more than 155 Myr and included the largest herbivores that ever existed. The radiation of dinosaurs was punctuated by several ecologically important events, including extinctions at the Triassic/Jurassic (Tr/J) and Jurassic/Cretaceous (J/K) boundaries, the decline of cycadophytes, and the origin of angiosperms, all of which may have had profound consequences for herbivore communities. Here we present the first analysis of morphological and biomechanical disparity for sauropodomorph and ornithischian dinosaurs in order to investigate patterns of jaw shape and function through time. We find that morphological and biomechanical man-dibular disparity are decoupled: mandibular shape disparity follows taxonomic diversity, with a steady increase through the Mesozoic. By contrast, biomechanical disparity builds to a peak in the Late Jurassic that corresponds to increased functional variation among sauropods. The reduction in biomechanical disparity following this peak coincides with the J/K extinction, the associated loss of sauropod and stegosaur diversity, and the decline of cycadophytes. We find no specific correspondence between bio-mechanical disparity and the proliferation of angiosperms. Continual ecological and functional replacement of pre-existing taxa accounts for disparity patterns through much of the Cretaceous, with the exception of several unique groups, such as psittacosaurids that are never replaced in their biomecha-nical or morphological profiles."
