        "text": "Alvarezsaurs in the Lori matrix\n\nThis time our topology is-\n\nI provide a new definition for Alvarezsauroidea that adds Therizinosaurus as an external specifier since I find it most parsimonious for Therizinosauria to be its sister group, and uses Alvarezsaurus as the internal specifier unlike Sereno's that uses Shuvuuia- (Alvarezsaurus calvoi< - Ornithomimus velox, Therizinosaurus cheloniformis, Passer domesticus) . Alvarezsauroids have had a controversial phylogenetic placement, with the Lori matrix recovering them as basal maniraptorans sister to therizinosaurs. Yet they can be outside therizinosaurs plus pennaraptorans in 3 steps, become avemetatarsalians in 4 steps (can bring therizinosaurs or not), non-maniraptoriforms in 6 steps (they bring therizinosaurs), closer to pennaraptorans than therizinosaurs in 6 steps, paravians in 11 steps (therizinosaurs move with), closer to Compsognathus than to birds in 15 steps, closer to birds than deinonychosaurs in 27 steps, and closer to Archaeopteryx and other birds than to dromaeosaurids and troodontids in 30 steps.\n\nFukuivenator is an odd taxon, recovered here as the basalmost alvarezsauroid. But it can be a therizinosaurian in only two steps, and outside Maniraptoriformes in 4 steps (it emerges in Coeluridae). One thing I don't think it is is a dromaeosaurid, as that takes 27 more steps, and getting it into Paraves or Pennaraptora requires 11 and 7 steps respectively. Still, I wouldn't be surprised to see this taxon work its way around the base of Maniraptoriformes once an osteology comes out.\n\nShuvuuia deserti IGM 100/975 axial elements in ventral view and pelvis in dorsal view (courtesy AMNH).\n\nNqwebasaurus was recently redescribed by Sereno (2017), which I incorporated into its scorings. Choiniere et al. (2012) recovered it in Ornithomimosauria, but note most of the characters they list to support that are also said to be present in alvarezsauroids. Even they could place it in Alvarezsauroidea with only 4 steps. The Lori matrix needs 6 steps to place it in Ornithomimosauria, which I think is higher partially due to it finding Pelecanimimus to be an alvarezsauroid too. So similarities between the two like their teeth being in a common groove and maxillary teeth being confined to the anterior third of the bone are no longer ornithomimosaur-like. As recently noted by Cerroni et al. (2019), this makes more sense biogeographically as well. Oh, and note that the Lori matrix found Afromimus to be a ceratosaur as in that paper. In any case, Nqwebasaurus takes 10 steps to move to Compsognathidae, and 7 steps to move sister to Pennaraptora.\n\nAs for Pelecanimimus itself, it seems plausibly alvarezsauroid if you think about it. The skull is famously similar to Shuvuuia, the posterior tympanic recess is in the otic recess, ossified sterna are otherwise unknown for ornithomimosaurs, the long manual digit I was always out of place compared to Harpymimus, and Europe makes more sense for otherwise Gondwanan clades in the Cretaceous. Now if only someone would release Perez-Moreno's thesis describing it in detail...\n\nShuvuuia deserti IGM 100/975 pectoral and forelimb elements. Note the tiny phalanx from digit II or III at the bottom (courtesy AMNH).\n\nPatagonykus and Bonapartenykus are usually closer to parvicursorines than Alvarezsaurus and Achillesaurus, but the Lori matrix found them just outside Alvarezsauridae instead. Interestingly, Xu et al. (2018) recovered the same results. It takes 3 steps to move Patagonykus closer to parvicursorines, and 4 steps to join Alvarezsaurus and Patagonykus to the exclusion of parvicursorines as in Alifanov and Barsbold (2009). Xu et al. recover these in 5 and 7 steps respectively, and the most recent version of Longrich and Currie's alvarezsaurid matrix (Lu et al., 2018) recovers a basal Patagonykus and a basal Parvicursorinae in 3 steps each.\n\nOne odd result is that the newly described Xiyunykus and Bannykus fall in Patagonykinae too. Yet only 2 steps move them outside the Patagonykus plus Parvicursorinae clade, where they form a clade. Another step breaks that up to place Xiyunykus more basal as in Xu et al.. Them being basal certainly fits better stratigraphically, and Xu et al. use several characters designed for alvarezsauroids that the Lori matrix didn't include yet. Hopefully full osteologies will be published as well.\n\nMononykus olecranus cast YPM 56693 (of holotype) pes in plantar view (courtesy of Senter).\n\nA patagonykine Achillesaurus as suggested by Agnolin et al. (2012) takes 7 additional steps in the Lori matrix where it instead emerges just closer to parvicursorines than Alvarezsaurus. On the other hand, only a single step joins it with Alvarezsaurus as in Longrich and Currie (2009) and only 2 steps makes it just further from parvicursorines than Alvarezsaurus as in Xu et al. (2018).\n\nAlnashetri is known from type hindlimb material, but now also from MPCA 377, a nearly complete specimen with interesting characters like flat and unfused sternal plates. Makovicky et al. (2016) used this data to recover it as the sister group to Alvarezsauridae, and while the few published details left it more derived in the Lori tree, it can go to a more basal position with only two steps. It should be interesting to compare to e.g. Bannykus once it is published.\n\nMononykus olecranus cast YPM 56693 (of holotype) (courtesy of Senter).\n\nThe arctometatarsal clade has a unique topology, but no other analysis has included nearly as many characters or all of these taxa, with Lu et al. omitting Albinykus and Ceratonykus among non-fragmentary specimens, and Xu et al. omitting the more recently described Qiupanykus. Enforcing the Lori topology in Lu et al.'s matrix is only 5 steps longer, and doing so in Xu et al.'s matrix is only 6 steps longer. On the other hand, Xu et al.'s topology is so unresolved at this level, the only difference in mine is placing the Albinykus plus Xixianykus clade basally near Albertonykus, which takes 5 steps to do in the Lori matrix.\n\nIt should be noted that Lu et al.'s illustrated topology (their Figure 3) is not their matrix's real result, as they did not fully analyze tree space. Instead of 20 trees, there are 214 trees. These differ in that Albertonykus, YPM 1049 and undescribed 41HIII-0104 can fall out anywhere more derived than Patagonykus, and that Parvicursor, the Tugriken Shireh taxon, Shuvuuia and Mononykus form an unresolved polytomy. This leaves Linhenykus, Qiupanykus and Xixianykus unresolved between that polytomy and Patagonykus, which is perfectly compatible with the Lori topology. This may also show that the small alvarezsauroid-specific matrix of Longrich and Currie is insufficient given all the new taxa described since 2009. YPM 1049 was far too fragmentary to include (distal metatarsal III) but I tried testing undescribed Quipa specimen 41HIII-0104. Didn't make it into the publication, but here's its scorings-\n\n'41HIII0104' ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????-?? ?????????1 ?10??????? ?????????? ?????????? ???0?????? ????1????? ???1?????{01} ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????0? ????????3? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????1 ?????????1 1????????? 1????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???1?????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????0? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???1?????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????{123}???? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??1???0???\n\nTugriken Shireh parvicursorine (IGM 100/99) vertebrae and ilia in ventral view, forelimb and fibula in lower right (courtesy AMNH).\n\nInterestingly, Agnolin et al., Xu et al. and the Lori analysis all recovered Albinykus sister to Xixianykus outside Parvicursorinae. Wonder if that's a real signal? Unfortunately, the only attempt to name this clade was Agnolin et al. who also recovered Ceratonykus in there and called it Ceratonykini. Xu et al. place Ceratonykus closer to parvicursorines, while I found it more basal than either, sister to Qiupanykus which neither of the other studies used. Forcing Ceratonykus sister to Albonykus plus Xixianykus takes 3 more steps in the Lori matrix. Forcing Ceratonykus sister to Mononykus as in its original description (with or without Qiupanykus) takes 5 more steps. As stated in the paper, we were the first analysis to include Hateg tibiotarsi Bradycneme and Heptasteornis. While the former can fall into many positions in Maniraptora, the latter was resolved as an alvarezsaurid as proposed by Naish and Dyke (2004). Note this used only the tibiotarsus and not alvarezsaurid-like distal femur FGGUB R.1957. A single step moves Heptasteornis to Troodontidae.\n\nWe also provide an updated definition for Parvicursorinae (Mononykus olecranus + Parvicursor remotus), like Choiniere et al.'s (2010) but using species. One accident of our definitional and discovery history is that all these newer arctometatarsal alvarezsaurids (Xixianykus, Albertonykus, Albinykus, Linhenykus, Qiupanykus, Ceratonykus, etc.) emerge outside the originally discovered and defined Parvicursorinae. We could really use some clade defining taxa closer to Mononykus than Patagonykus, Alvarezsaurus or Achillesaurus. In any case, I got a lot of experience with parvicursorine specimens, examining Shuvuuia and the Tugriken Shireh specimen IGM 100/99 in person, and having photos of high quality casts of Mononykus thanks to Senter. I found the Tugriken Shireh taxon closer to Shuvuuia, but moving it closer to Parvicursor as in Longrich and Currie is just 1 step longer.\n\nTugriken Shireh parvicursorine (IGM 100/99) vertebrae and ilia in dorsal view, forelimb and fibula in lower right (courtesy AMNH).\n\nNext time, therizinosaurs...\n\nReferences- Naish and Dyke, 2004.

These are one of the best analyzed clades because I incorporated all of Zanno's (2010) characters, which is by far the largest and most recent analysis of the group until the Lori paper was published. The topology is-\n\nFalcarius is the most basal taxon shown of course, but Martharaptor was pruned a posteriori and can fall out anywhere in Therizinosauria outside the Alxasaurus plus Segnosaurus clade. I tried including Thecocoelurus, but the Lori matrix is pretty terrible when it comes to scoring single vertebrae-\n\nThecocoelurus ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????(01)0? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???1?????? ?????????? ?????2???? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????0?? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????1???? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??0??????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????\n\nJianchangosaurus fell out in the same place as its original description, with Cau's (2018) placement in Alvarezsauroidea taking 18 more steps so is very unlikely. Mine is the only published matrix besides Senter (2011) and its derivatives to use information from the second Beipaiosaurus specimen, and incorporated photos from Zanno and the new paper on the holotype skull elements too.\n\nBeipiaosaurus inexpectus holotype (IVPP V11559) cervical vertebra in dorsal view (courtesy of Zanno).\n\nZanno also provided photos of Alxasaurus and Enigmosaurus, and its depressing how much of the former is lost. Enigmosaurus rather famously was shown by Zanno to not resemble Barsbold's original illustration that was the only reference picture known for over two decades. Placing Enigmosaurus closer to Segnosaurus than Neimongosaurus or Erliansaurus as in Zanno's tree takes 4 more steps. Forcing Enigmosaurus and Erlikosaurus to be sister taxa to simulate the synonymy mentioned by Barsbold (1983) takes 4 steps, so seems unlikely. The duo moves between Nanshiungosaurus and the Segnosaurus plus Nothronychus clade. We were the first analysis to include \"Chilantaisaurus\" zheziangensis, which emerged in a polytomy with Alxasaurus, Enigmosaurus and therizinosaurids.\n\nAlxasaurus elesitaiensis holotype (IVPP V88402a) chevrons in right lateral view (natural order reversed) (courtesy of Zanno).\n\nAs was the case with Archaeornithomimus? bissektensis, we didn't include the possible chimaera of Bissekty Therizinosauria as an OTU, unlike Sues and Averianov (2015). But if you do want to experiment with it, here's the scorings. It emerges in a polytomy in the Suzhousaurus plus Therizinosaurus clade of therizinosaurids. Btw, Archaeornithomimus? bissektensis does fall out most parsimoniously sister to A. asiaticus when all Bissekty material is used.\n\n'Bissekty-Therizinosauroidea' ????1??0?? ????1????? ?????1???? ?1???????? ?????{01}1000 ?01??????? 00???????? 2??21?0??? ???????00{123} {12}00(01)2011?? ??0???0(01)00 ??11????{12}? ?{01}0?100??? ?????????? ?1{01}?0????? ??0?0???{012}0 000(01)?010?? ?????????? ?????????? ?????0{12}?00 1?0???0??0 ??0??{01}0??? 0?1??????? ????0?1?0? {01}0?1???{01}?? ??0??????? ?????????? ?????????0 ???001??00 ??00?01?1? 10???????? ?????????1 ???0?????? ???1?????? ??????0??1 0???1(12)???? ????0???1? ????0?011? ???0????0? ???0{12}0???? ????????0? 0?0????1?? ?????????? ??010101?1 ??0?0(01)???? ?????{01}010? ???100???? ????????11 1010?????? ??0??0???? ?????????? ?????????? ??????0??? ??00?????? ?00??????? ?????????? ???????0-- -??00??010 ?????????? ??????-??? ???-010??1 0100????00 10?1?00??? ???0?00??? ?????????? ????0????? ???000???? ?0???-???? ?????????? ?????001??\n\nEnigmosaurus mongoliensis holotype (IGM 100/84) synsacrum and ilium in ventral view (courtesy of Zanno).\n\nNext is Therizinosauridae itself, which we refined Zhang et al.'s (2001) definition of to include type species. Therizinosaurids first split into a clade of Erliansaurus, Neimongosaurus, Suzhousaurus and Therizinosaurus. Forcing the former two to be outside a clade of Suzhousaurus, Therizinosaurus and the taxa below, as in Zanno's tree, takes 5 more steps. Notably, we did not include the hindlimb IGM 100/45 in the Therizinosaurus OTU since there's no overlap and its not even particularly large. But here's the Therizinosaurus OTU including the hindlimb. Using this version of Therizinosaurus leaves the tree basically the same but destabilizes it somewhat in that Therizinosaurus and Erlikosaurus can now go in multiple positions within Therizinosauridae, and the Nanchao embryos are in a trichotomy with the Suzhousaurus clade and the Nothronychus clade. Is this an indication the hindlimb produces homoplasy and so might not belong to Therizinosaurus?\n\nTherizinosaurus ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????01 0110021000 01?0001100 00001110?? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???0???010 1?0000000? 0?1??1???? ?????????? ?????????? 000??0???? ??????3??1 ?????????0 ???00????? 0?1?0?1??? ?????0???? ?????????1 ?????????? ?????0???? ?????????? ?????????? 1011010101 100100??1? ????{12}?00?? 00?12110?? 101??????? 0????0?111 00?010???? ????????1? ?????????? ????100111 1101110??? ?????????? ????????1? ?1???????? ?????????1 ???0?????? ?000?????? ?????0???1 ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????0???? ??????-00? ?00-000001 0?0100??0? 10000???0{01} ?{01}?0000??0 {01}0???????? ????????00 ?00?????0- -??11-???? ?????????? ???1?0???0\n\nSegnosaurus galbinensis paratype (IGM 100/83) cervical neural arch in right lateral view (courtesy of Zanno).\n\nNow comes the Nanchao therizinosaur embryos, those described by Kundrat et al. inside dendroolithid eggs. While including such young specimens might be seen as risky, my ontogenetically conservative scoring method with state N seems to have worked fine here. They fall out where you'd expect a Santonian-Campanian therizinosaur to do so. Following that is Nanshiungosaurus brevispinus, which Senter et al. (2012) recovered as the next most derived therizinosaur after Alxasaurus. Forcing it into this basal position takes 4 steps. Nanshiungosaurus? bohlini was included but pruned a posteriori since it can go anywhere in the Segnosaurus plus Nothronychus clade. Forcing Nanshiungosaurus monophyly is just a single step longer though, while forcing bohlini to be sister to the contemporaneous Suzhousaurus takes 2 steps.\n\nSegnosaurus itself (which Zanno also provided photos of) pairs with ex-Alectrosaurus forelimb AMNH 6368, which has only previously been analyzed by Zanno (2006) where it pairs with Erliansaurus. Forcing that here compared to other taxa she included results in trees 3 steps longer. Erlikosaurus groups with the Nothronychus species in a trichotomy where it can be sister to either species. Forcing Nothronychus monophyly takes only a single step, but note that no proposed Nothronychus characters involve elements that can be compared to Erlikosaurus (humerus and pes). Forcing Erlikosaurus to group with Therizinosaurus as in Senter et al. requires only a single step, with Erlikosaurus moving to the Therizinosaurus clade.\n\nNext time, oviraptorosaurs...\n\nReferences- Barsbold, 1983.

A Theropod Database update is online, with the main additions being troodontid information and info from the Hayashibara Museum of Natural Sciences Research Bulletins 1-3. I love these publications and wish more like them existed for other collections. They detail the expeditions into Mongolia with exact discovery dates and field numbers for taxa like Nomingia, Elsornis and Aepyornithomimus, and tons of still undescribed specimens. It's amazing just how many ornithomimosaurs are known from the Bayanshiree Formation for instance, when only the Garudimimus holotype has been described. There are over twenty more including the sort-of-described \"Gallimimus\"\"mongoliensis\" specimen IGM 100/14. So often for new taxa, especially those from the Jehol biota, no information is provided in the description as to when the specimen was discovered. I get that many are found by non-professionals and given to museums, but at least say \"the specimen was given to the museum on x-x-xx by someone who said it was excavated around year y.\" Next up, halszkaraptorine and dromaeosaurid updates...\n\nundescribed ?Gobivenator skull (HMNS coll.; field number 940801 TS-I WTB) (after Tsogtbaatar and Chinzorig, 2010).\n\nReference- Tsogtbaatar and Chinzorig, 2010.

When updating The Theropod Database I noticed my entry for Teinurosaurus is pathetically bad- wrong authors, wrong age, wrong size, and generally missing the complicated history of this innocuous vertebra. How embarrassing! So here's the revised version that will be uploaded-\n\nTeinurosaurus Nopcsa, 1928\n\n= Saurornithoides Nopsca, 1928 (preoccupied Osborn, 1924)\n\n= Caudocoelus Huene, 1932\n\nT. sauvagei (Huene, 1932) Olshevsky, 1978\n\n= Caudocoelus sauvagei Huene, 1932\n\nTithonian, Late Jurassic\n\nMont-Lambert Formation, Hauts-de-France, France\n\nHolotype- (BHN2R 240; = Boulogne Museum 500) incomplete distal caudal vertebra (75 mm)\n\nDiagnosis- Provisionally indeterminate relative to Kaijiangosaurus, Tanycolagreus and Ornitholestes.\n\nOther diagnoses- (after Huene, 1932; compared to Elaphrosaurus) centrum wider; narrower ventral surface; ventral median groove wider; transversely narrower prezygapophyses.\n\nWhile Huene attmpted to distinguish Teinurosaurus from Elaphrosaurus, only the wider median ventral groove is apparent in existing photos of the former. This is compared to the one distal caudal of the latter figured in ventral view, but as Kobayashi reports grooves become distally narrower in Harpymimus while Ostrom reports they become distally wider in Deinonychus, groove width is not considered taxonomically distinctive at our current level of understanding. Indeed, this lack of data is most relevent to both diagnosing and identifying Teinurosaurus. Very few taxa have detailed descriptions of distal caudal vertebrae or more than lateral views figured, let alone indications of variation within the distal caudal series. So the facts that Fukuiraptor and Deinonychus share ventrally concave central articulations with Teinurosaurus in their single anteriorly/posteriorly figured distal caudal vertebra, or that Afromimus, \"Grusimimus\" and Falcariusalso have have wide ventral grooves in their few ventrally figured distal caudals, are not considered taxonomically important.\n\nComments- Sauvage (1897-1898; in a section written in January 1898) first mentioned a distal caudal vertebra he referred to the ornithischian Iguanodon prestwichii (now recognized as the basal styracosternan Cumnoria prestwichii) - \"We are disposed to regard as belonging to the same species the caudal vertebra of a remote region, the part which we figure under n ° 7, 8\" [translated]. Note Galton (1982) was incorrect in claiming Sauvage reported on this specimen in his 1897 paper (written December 6), which includes a section on prestwichiinearly identical to the 1897-1898 one but which lacks the paragraph describing this vertebra. This could provide a specific date of December 1897 to January 1898 for the discovery and/or recognition of the specimen. Huene (1932) correctly noted Sauvage mislabeled plate VII figure 8 as dorsal view, when it is in ventral view as understood by the text. Compared to Cumnoria, the caudal is more elongate (length 3.93 times posterior height compared to 2.54 times at most), has a ventral median groove instead of a keel, and the prezygapophyseal base in 71% of the anterior central height compared to ~30-40%, all typical of avepods. Nopcsa (1928) recognized its theropod nature and in his list of reptile genera meant to use a footnote to propose Teinurosaurusas a \"new name for the piece described and figured by Sauvage (Direct. Traveaux Geol. Portugal Lisbonne 1897-1898, plate VII, Fig. 7-10) as late caudal of Iguanodon Prestwichi.\" Teinurosaurusis listed as an aublysodontine megalosaurid (not as an ornithomimine, contra Galton), roughly equivalent to modern Eutyrannosauria. However due to a typographical error, the footnote's superscript 1 was placed after Saurornithoides instead of Teinurosaurus. Sauvage (1929) corrected this in an addendum- \"footnote 1 does not refer to Saurornithoides (line 19 from below) but to Teinurosaurus(last line of text).\" Unfortunately, Huene missed the addendum, and thus wrote \"Nopcsa recognized in 1927 (43, p. 183) that this was a coelurosaur and intended to give it a name, but used one already used by Osborn, namely \"Saurornithoides\" (91, 1924, p. 3- 7). For this reason, a new name had to be given here\" [translated]. Huene's proposed new name was Caudocoelus sauvagei, placed in Coeluridae and \"somewhat reminiscent of Elaphrosaurus.\" Huene is also perhaps the first of several authors to place the specimen in the Kimmeridgian, when it is actually from the Tithonian (Buffetaut and Martin, 1993; as Portlandian). Galton wrote \"Lapparent and Lavocat (1955: 801) gave a line drawing of the vertebra after Sauavage (1898) and included it in the section on Elaphrosaurus\" and that the specimen \"was referred to Elaphrosaurusby Lapparent and Lavocat (1955).\" This was perhaps done because Huene explicitly compared the two, ironically making it the only taxon distinguished from Teinurosaurus at the time. Most of Huene's characters cannot be checked in the few published photos of Teinurosaurus, but the ventral median sulcus is indeed much wider than Elaphrosaurus. Ostrom (1969) was the first author to detail Nopcsa's (1929) addendum, stating \"Nopcsa's name Teinurosaurus has clear piority over Huene's Caudocoelus, but since Nopcsa failed to provbide a specific name, Teinurosaurus is not valid.\" Olshevsky (1978) solved this by writing \"Teinurosaurus has clear priority over Caudocoelus, as noted in Ostrom 1969, and it is certainly a valid generic name. The species Caudocoelus sauvagei is proposed here as the type species of the genus Teinurosaurus, resulting in the new combination Teinurosaurus sauvagei(von Huene 1932) as the proper name of the type specimen.\" He also claimed \"the specimen itself, unfortunately, was destroyed during World War II and thus must remain a nomen dubium.\" This was repeated by Galton, but as Buffetaut et al. (1991) wrote- \"Contrary to a widespread opinion (expressed, for instance, by Lapparent, 1967), the vertebra in question has survived two world wars and years of neglect, like a large part of the other fossil reptile remains in the collections of the Boulogne Natural History Museum (see Vadet and Rose, 1986).\" Olshevsky noted Steel misunderstood Nopsca in a different way, believing Teinurosaurus instead of Aublysodon was a \"name, proposed by Cope in 1869 ... used instead of Deinodon\", as stated under superscript 2. Galton did have the first modern opinion on Teinurosaurus' affinities, stating \"In addition to Elaphrosaurus, elongate prezygapophyses occur in the allosaurid Allosaurus and the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus, so this caudal vertebra can only be identified as theropod, family incertae sedis.\" Buffetaut and Martin (1993) agreed, saying \"no really distinctive characters that would allow a familial assignment can be observed.\" Ford (2005 online) gave the type repository as \"Dortigen Museum\", but this is a misunderstanding based on Huene's \"Boulogne-sur-mer (Nr. 500 im dortigen Museum)\", which roughly translated is \"Boulogne-sur-mer region (No. 500 in the museum there)\", referring to the Boulogne Museum where it has always been held. It was originally number 500, but was recatalogued at some point.\n\nSauvage lists the vertebra's length as 75 mm and his plate at natural size would have it be 79 mm, Huene lists it as 11 cm (110 mm) and his figure at 1:2 size would have it be 152 mm. Galton's drawing with supposed 5 cm scale would have it be 235 mm, while Buffetaut and Martin's plate with scale would leave it at 74 mm. As Huene's and Galton's figures are taken from Sauvage's original plate and the newest and unique photo matches Sauvage's reported length almost exactly, 75 mm is taken as the correct length.\n\nRelationships- While prior authors haven't specified Teinurosaurus' relationships past Theropoda (besides Lapparent and Lavocat's apparent synonymy with Elaphrosaurus), there are several ways to narrow down its identity. Only neotheropods are known from the Late Jurassic onward, so coelophysoid-grade taxa are excluded. Some theropod clades were too small to have a 75 mm caudal, including most non-tyrannosauroid coelurosaurs besides ornithomimosaurs, therizinosaurs and eudromaeosaurs. The former two are unknown from the Jurassic, and additionally paravians like eudromaeosaurs lack any neural spine by the time the centrum gets as elongate as Teinurosaurus (e.g. by caudal 12 in Deinonychus at elongation index of 2.4). Teinurosaurus has an elongation index (centrum length/height) of 3.9, which also excludes Ceratosauridae, Beipiaosaurus+ therizinosauroids and oviraptorosaurs. Prezygapophyses basal depth is significantly less in ceratosaurids, megalosaurids, carnosaurs except Neovenator, compsognathids, Fukuivenator and Falcarius. Remaining taxa are elaphrosaur-grade ceratosaurs, piatnitzkysaurids, Neovenator and basal tyrannosauroids.\n\nReferences- Sauvage, 1897. Notes sur les Reptiles Fossiles (1).

(2016) was only placed as specifically as a non-pygostylian maniraptoriform. But as the deposits are Gondwanan (e.g. Poinar, 2018), the range of potential Cenomanian theropods is better understood. And only one group has caudal centra over three times longer than tall- unenlagiines. I bet DIP-V-15103 is our first sample of preserved plumage in an unenlagiine, which makes you wonder if the weird alternating barb placement was a feature that evolved on Gondwana, and if so did Rahonavis' remiges exhibit it too?\n\n- Does anyone realize both \"Tralkasaurus\" (Cerroni et al., 2019) and \"Thanos\" (Delcourt and Iori, 2018) are nomina nuda? Neither are in an official volume yet, though \"Tralkasaurus\" is scheduled for March and \"Thanos\" will probably make it this year if the average papers per volume of Historical Biology holds up. \"Tralkasaurus\" has an empty space in its \"Zoobank registration:\" section, while the \"Thanos\" paper doesn't mention ZooBank at all, and neither show up in ZooBank searches. Also, one of \"Thanos\"' supposed autapomorphies is a deep prezygapophyseal spinodiapophyseal fossa, which does not exist in abelisaurs as it would require a spinodiapophyseal lamina. The labeled structure seems internal, probably the centroprezygapophyseal fossa or prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa based on CT-scanned noasaurid cervical DGM929-R. That leaves axial pleurocoel size and distance from each other, and ventral keel strength as suggested characters. Which can only be compared to Carnotaurus among brachyrostrans.

This week we got the announcement of a tiny theropod skull in Myanmar amber, which was bound to happen eventually as amazing finds from that deposit keep being published. Alas, whatever Oculudentavis is, it's not a theropod.\n\nOculudentavis skull (after Xing et al., 2020).\n\nJust look at it. No antorbital fenestra, incomplete ventral bar to the laterotemporal fenestra, huge posttemporal fenestrae, teeth that extend posteriorly far under the orbit...\n\nAll of which might be coincidental, but then look at the mandible.\n\nOculudentavis mandible (after Xing et al., 2020).\n\nThat spike-like coronoid process is classic lepidosaur, plus the dentary is way too long compared to the post-dentary elements, then the description says \"The tooth geometry appears to be acrodont to pleurodont; no grooves or sockets are discernable.\" And of course \"the scleral ring is very large and is formed by elongated spoon-shaped ossicles; a morphology similar to this is otherwise known only in lizards (for example, Lacerta viridis).\"\n\nAdd to this the size of this partially fused specimen being smaller than any extant bird (14 mm), and no feather remains, and why is this a theropod again? The endocast is big, but why not a clade of brainier lizards or late surviving megalancosaurs by the Cenomanian?\n\nThe authors add it to Jingmai's bird analysis where it ends in a huge polytomy closer to Aves than Archaeopteryx, but outside fake Ornithuromorpha. That's often what happens when a taxon is wrongly placed in a clade. Note the figured placement between Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis is only found using implied weights. At least add it to e.g. Nesbitt's or Ezcurra's archosauromorph analyses, or Cau's theropod analyses before assuming it's a bird.\n\nThanks to Ruben Molina Perez for suggesting this issue in the first place.\n\nReference- Xing, O'Connor, Schmitz, Chiappe, McKellar, Yi and Li, 2020.

So what is it? To answer that question, I entered it into Simoes et al.'s (2018) sauropsid analysis which emphasizes basal lepidosauromorphs and comes out with basal gekkos and nested iguanians even using just morphological characters. To test Jingmai's avialan hypothesis, I also added Archaeopteryx to the matrix. The result is 384 MPTs of 2337 steps each.\n\nStrict consensus of 384 MPTs of Simoes et al.'s (2018) analysis after adding Oculudentavis and Archaeopteryx. Compare to Extended Data Figure 3 of Simoes et al..\n\nAs you can see, Oculudentavis resolves as a stem-squamate in a trichotomy with Huehuecuetzpalli and squamates, while Archaeopteryx is an archosauromorph sister to Erythrosuchus. And this matrix didn't score for scleral ossicle shape, posttemporal fenestra size or maxillary tooth row length. After scoring Oculudentavis, its teeth are clearly not acrodont, it seems to have a ventral parietal fossa and lacks an ossified laterosphenoid. The authors could have made it easier to evaluate by separating the cranial elements in the 3D pdf file. As it is, a lot of palatal and braincase info is uncertain. But Huehuecuetzpalli is Albian compared to Oculudentavis' Cenomanian, and has a skull length of 32 mm (19 mm in the juvenile) versus 14 mm in Oculudentavis.\n\nHuehuecuetzpalli skull (top; after Reynoso, 1998), Oculudentavis skull and separate mandible (middle; after Xing et al., 2020), and Archaeopteryx skull (after Rauhut, 2014).\n\nReferences- Reynoso, 1998.

After 20 years of waiting, we now have Phylonyms: A Companion to the PhyloCode, by de Queiroz et al. (2020), \"a turning point in the history of phylogenetic nomenclature\" according to its introduction. As the book states \"Phylonyms serves as the starting point for phylogenetic nomenclature governed by the PhyloCode. According to the preamble, “This code will take effect on the publication of Phylonyms: A Companion to the PhyloCode, and it is not retroactive.” Thus, names and definitions published here have precedence over any competing names and definitions published either before (or after) the publication of Phylonyms.\" So for anyone invested in standardized phylogenetic nomenclature, this is it. Nothing better is coming down the pipeline in our lifetimes, so let's see what we're stuck with.\n\nFirst of all, it's expensive. You can get an ebook for $222 on Amazon or a hardcover sometime after June 9th for $234. I found an electronic version for $169 plus tax on VitalSource, but you have to use their reader. It's 1323 pages though, so isn't a bad deal. That's less than five $37.95 Cretaceous Research pdfs, and I figure this is one of those historical volumes it's good to have, like Sibley and Ahlquist's bird phylogeny book.\n\nThe format is an encyclopedia-style list of clades in phylogenetic order with Registration Number, Definition, Etymology, Reference Phylogeny, Composition, Apomorphies, Synonyms, Comments and Literature Cited. Rather like my Theropod Database, so no complaints there. Well, one complaint is really more to do with the PhyloCode itself where they decided to abbreviate definitions with the non-standard del/nabla triangle symbol ∇. If you want people to start using your format, you might want to choose symbols that exist on a standard keyboard. Alt+2207 is supposed to generate it in Windows, but results in ƒ here in Blogger. Anyone know the correct Unicode numbers?\n\nOn to the substance, where Phylonyms covers all life. Dinosaurs are the last section of the book, and non-avian dinosaurs get all of four definitions-\n\nDinosauria R. Owen 1842 [M. C. Langer, F. E. Novas, J. S. Bittencourt, M. D. Ezcurra, and J. A. Gauthier], converted clade name\n\nRegistration Number: 194\n\nDefinition: The smallest clade containing Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden 1881 (Ornithischia/Euornithopoda) Megalosaurus bucklandii Mantell 1827 (Theropoda/Megalosauroidea) and Cetiosaurus oxoniensis Phillips 1871 (Sauropodomorpha).\n\nI'm glad we've standardized which theropod, ornithischian and sauropodomorph are used (or so I thought, see below), but otherwise there's not much to say. The caveats around which apomorphies are also found in Nyasasaurus and at least some silesaurs illustrate why apomorphy-based definitions are bad. The reference phylogeny for this and Saurischia is Lloyd et al.'s (2008) supertree, which is quite outdated and has a lot of artifacts from being a supertree.\n\nSaurischia H. G. Seeley 1888 [J. A. Gauthier, M. C. Langer, F. E. Novas, J. Bittencourt, and M. D. Ezcurra], converted clade name\n\nRegistration Number: 195\n\nDefinition: The largest clade containing Allosaurus fragilis Marsh 1877 (Theropoda/Carnosauria) and Camarasaurus supremus Cope 1877 (Sauropodomorpha), but not Stegosaurus stenops Marsh 1887 (Ornithischia/Stegosauridae).\n\nIt's rather odd the same authors didn't choose the same specifiers for each dinosaurian clade as they did in the previous definition, leaving us without a neat node-stem triplet. Instead they went with the Kischlatian approach of using taxa\"mentioned and figured as examples of their respective groups by Seeley (1888).\" This is funny because I don't think this rationale is ever suggested in the PhyloCode, whereas Dinosauria and Saurischia are actually the official examples used for Recommendation 11F encouraging node-stem triplets (\"If it is important to establish two names as applying to sister clades regardless of the phylogeny, reciprocal maximum-clade definitions should be used in which the single internal specifier of one is the single external specifier of the other, and vice versa\"). Specifically- \"If one wishes to define the names Saurischia and Ornithischia such that they will always refer to sister clades, Saurischia might be defined as the largest clade containing Megalosaurus bucklandiiMantell 1827 but not Iguanodon bernissartensisBoulenger in Beneden 1881, and Ornithischia would be defined as the largest clade containing Iguanodon bernissartensis but not Megalosaurus bucklandii. To stabilize the name Dinosauria as referring to the clade comprising Saurischia and Ornithischia, Dinosauria should be defined as the smallest clade containing Megalosaurus bucklandii and Iguanodon bernissartensis.\"\n\nOrnithoscelida and its consequences are mentioned, but I'm glad more time is not taken up with it as I expect the hypothesis to fall away as Baron's phylogenetic mistakes are not followed by future authors.\n\nSauropodomorpha F. R. von Huene 1932 [M. Fabbri, E. Tschopp, B. McPhee, S. Nesbitt, D. Pol, and M. Langer], converted clade name\n\nRegistration Number: 295\n\nDefinition: The largest clade containing Saltasaurus loricatus Bonaparte and Powell 1980 (Sauropodomorpha) but not Allosaurus fragilis Marsh 1877 (Theropoda) and Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden 1881 (Ornithischia).\n\nI dislike the use of Saltasaurus as the internal specifier, which is a holdover of Sereno's weird use of deeply nested OTUs when others would be more historically relevant and/or eponymous. Fabbri et al. defend the choice because \"Fossil specimens referred to Saltasaurus loricatus are abundant, the species is well known, and its phylogenetic position is consistent among phylogenetic analyses\", but this would be even more true for e.g. Camarasaurus supremus used in Saurischia's definition. The other specifiers are a mix of those in Dinosauria's and Saurischia's definition, so there's absolutely no consistency. The reference phylogeny is Otero et al.'s (2015) Sefapanosaurus description using Yates' matrix, so is fine.\n\nThere's a rare error in the comments for this entry. Fabbri et al. state \"Segnosaurus galbinensis from the Cretaceous was briefly thought to be a relatively early diverging sauropodomorph (Paul, 1984; Gauthier, 1986; Olshevsky, 1991). More material referable to that species and the discovery of closely related taxa later showed that Segnosaurus galbinensis is part of the Therizinosauria\", but material of S. galbinensis besides that initially recovered in the 1970s is not known.\n\nTheropoda O. C. Marsh 1881 [D. Naish, A. Cau, T. R. Holtz, Jr., M. Fabbri, and J. A. Gauthier], converted clade name\n\nRegistration Number: 216\n\nDefinition: The largest clade containing Allosaurus fragilis Marsh 1877 (Theropoda) but neither Plateosaurus engelhardti Meyer 1837 (Sauropodomorpha) nor Heterodontosaurus tucki Crompton and Charig 1962 (Ornithischia).\n\nHere we've chosen two completely different specifiers for Sauropodomorpha and Ornithischia, so again we have no consistency. The reference phylogeny is Cau (2018), which is ideal.\n\nWhat about the rest? It's a HUGE volume, and obviously most of Pan-Biota is outside my area of expertise. One obvious issue is the wildly varying coverage of different clades. Apparently nobody could be bothered with the vast majority of vertebrates (euteleosts) or animals (insects, except one definition for Trichoptera), and Molluska doesn't even get a definition. But we do get several entries for edrioasterid taxa down to subfamily-level, generally obscure Paleozoic echinoderms. Closer to dinosaurs, there's nothing at all for pan-crocs, but we get an entry for Pterosauromorpha for which only Scleromochlus is given as a plausible non-pterosaurian example (perhaps wrongly- Bennett, 2020).\n\nThen there are the apomorphy-based definitions which will cause headaches in the future. Look at Apo-Chiroptera- \"Definition: The clade for which the unique modifications of the hand, forearm, humerus, scapula, hip, and ankle (see Diagnostic Apomorphies) associated with flapping flight, as inherited by Vespertilio murinus Linnaeus 1758, are apomorphies.\" Then you go down to the nine listed sets of Diagnostic Apomorphies like \"Modification of the scapula: Scapular spine originates at the posterior edge of the glenoid fossa. Long axis of scapular spine offset 20–30 degrees from axis of rotation of the humeral head. Scapular spine reduced in height—acromion process appears more strongly arched and less well supported than in other mammals. Presence of at least two facets in infraspinous fossa.\" These are all going spread out as more stem bats are discovered, and indeed the authors already note \"Simmons and Geisler (1998) included the absence of claws on wing digits III-V with this suite of modifications; however, the presence of claws on all the wing digits of Onychonycteris suggests that claws were present primitively in Apo-Chiroptera.\"\n\nUngulata is defined by Archibald as \"The least inclusive crown clade containing Bos primigenius Bojanus 1827 (= Bos taurus Linnaeus 1758) (Artiodactyla) and Equus ferus Boddaert 1785 (= Equus caballus Linnaeus 1758) (Perissodactyla), provided that this clade does not include Felis silvestris Schreber 1777 (= Felis catus Linnaeus 1758) (Carnivora), Manis pentadactyla Linnaeus 1758 (Pholidota), Vespertilio murinus Linnaeus 1758 (Chiroptera), or Erinaceus europaeus Linnaeus 1758 (Lipotyphla).\" But this doesn't exist in molecular studies, including those of ultraconserved elements, which consistently place carnivorans, pangolins and bats closer to perrisodactyls. So this is likely to be a historical footnote, as well established molecular relationships end up trumping morphological relationships in every example I know of.\n\nFinally, we get Pan-Lepidosauria for the total group of lepidosaurs, which has been Lepidosauromorpha for over thirty years. Yet Archosauromorpha is retained as \"The least inclusive clade containing Gallus (originally Phasianus) gallus (Aves) (Linnaeus 1758), Alligator (originally Crocdilus) mississippiensis (Daudin 1802) (Crocodylia), Mesosuchus browni Watson 1912 (Rhynchosauria), Trilophosaurus buettneri Case 1928 (Trilophosauridae), Prolacerta broomi Parrington 1935 (Prolacertiformes), and Protorosaurus speneri von Meyer 1830 (Protorosauria)\" even though Pan-Archosauria is also used for the total group of archosaurs, traditionally the definition of Archosauromorpha. I agree our new Archosauromorpha deserved a name for being a generally recognized group, whereas whether e.g. choristoderes or sauropterygians fell out closer to lizards or birds is highly unstable. But I would have rather kept the tradition of -omorpha for the stem clades and gave this a new name.\n\nOverall, I'm not very impressed for something 20 years in the making that intends to be so important. How do you contradict your own example for choosing specifiers in four papers, where two share the same author list, the other two share another author (Fabbri), and each of those shares an author with both of the first two (Langer and Gauthier)? And one of those is an editor for the volume. Nothing could be negotiated in over two decades? But it's what we have to work with now, and in the name of consistancy I'll adopt the definitions proposed. Now to see what happens when RegNum goes online.\n\nReferences- Lloyd, Davis, Pisani, Tarver, Ruta, Sakamoto, Hone, Jennings and Benton, 2008. Dinosaurs and the Cretaceous terrestrial revolution.

Johnson et al. (2020) reexamine the original material of Steneosaurus, an aquatic croc from the Jurassic of France. It hadn't been seriously looked at since the 1860s, so this is one of my favorite kinds of paleontology papers- restudying a fragmentary old specimen in a modern light. What do they find?\n\nWe first get a detailed recount of its history, with two decades as Cuvier's \"tête à museau plus allongé\" (= head with a more elongated snout; I have to praise the authors for translating all the French to English, even in our spoiled era of Google Translate it saves time), before it was named Steneosaurus rostro-major by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1825. Eudes Deslongchamps and son tackled it in the 1860s, where they viewed the specimen as too poorly preserved and so \"stated that the taxon to represent the genus Steneosaurus should be either ‘Steneosaurus’ megistorhynchus Eudes-Deslongchamps, 1866, or ‘Steneosaurus’ edwardsi Eudes-Deslongchamps, 1868c.\" Ha! You don't get to just take somebody's genus and affix your new species as its type. They were the last to examine the specimen in detail however, making that a pretty bad note to end on.\n\nJohnson et al. then reexamine the type snout of Steneosaurus, correcting the species name by eliminating the hyphen, officially making it the lectotype, noting Steel had determined the posterior skull to be Metriorhynchus, and illustrating and redescribing the specimen. Excellent work and very well done. After eliminating Mycterosuchus nasutus, 'Steneosaurus' leedsi, 'S.' heberti and Lemmysuchus and other machimosaurins based on numerous dissimilar characters, the authors come to the contemporaneous 'Steneosaurus' edwardsi.\n\n\"As mentioned before, this was a second species that Eudes-Deslongchamps (1867–69) considered identical to S. rostromajor. These two taxa share a combination of features including:\n\n1. A subcircular, moderately interdigitating premaxilla-maxilla suture.\n\n2. Maxillae ornamented with irregular grooves.\n\n3. A shallower mediolateral compression of the posterior maxillae, as opposed to ‘S.’ heberti (MNHN.F 1890-13).\n\n4. Horizontally flat posterior premaxilla in lateral view.\n\n5. Deep anterior and mid-maxillary reception pits that gradually become shallower towards the posterior maxilla.\n\n6. Subcircular to circular alveoli that remain relatively the same size throughout the maxilla.\n\n7. Teeth with well-pronounced enamel ridges at the base.\"\n\nWell how cool is that? They put in the hard work, found the matching more complete specimens, and now we have Steneosaurus edwardsi as a junior synonym of S. rostromajor, giving us a good look at what Steneosaurus really was after two hundred years.\n\nLectotype of Steneosaurus rostromajor (MNHN.RJN 134c-d) in dorsal (A, B) and ventral (C, D) views. (after Johnson et al., 2020).\n\nBut no.\n\nJohnson et al. immediately say \"it is important to note that many of these characters may, in fact, be related to sexual dimorphism, ontogeny and intraspecific variation.\" True, but that could be said for basically every character supposed to diagnose Mesozoic croc genera, or theropod genera, pterosaur genera, etc.. Unless you have some specific example like 'enamel ridges have been shown to develop with age and both S. rostromajor and S. edwardsi are larger than S? leedsi or S? heberti with weak ridges', then it's just hand-waving. And no, Johnson et al. never develop such an argument for one of those characters, let alone all seven.\n\nNext, we get \"In addition to the sexual dimorphism/ontogeny problem, one of the critical issues about MNHN.RJN 134c-d is that it is poorly preserved.\" Sure, but you were still able to perform many comparisons. Again, the authors never say any of their seven characters are taphonomic, so it's another objection without substance.\n\nYet the worst rationale for rejecting Steneosaurus is \"in reality, the name Steneosaurus is extremely impractical. It was used for many metriorhynchid specimens (e.g. ‘Steneosaurus’ gracilis, ‘Steneosaurus’ palpebrosus and ‘Steneosaurus’ manselii) during much of the 19th century, largely in part due to Cuvier’s metriorhynchid skull region (MNHN. RJN 134a-b) being attributed to the teleosauroid rostral section (MNHN.RJN 134c-d). Indeed, the concise, classical definition of ‘Steneosaurus’ as we interpret it today was not given until the work of both Eudes-Deslongchampses (1868c, 1867–69)\"\n\nSubstitute Megalosaurus in there to see how ridiculous it is. That has had over 45 species assigned to it, and was named in the 1820s but didn't have a modern concept associated with it until the 1980s. When Johnson et al. lament that for Steneosaurus \"rather than comparing characters outright, comparison is by process of elimination (or the question of ‘what features does this specimen lack?’)\", that perfectly describes the Megalosaurus paralectotype dentary.\n\n\"After the Eudes-Deslongchampses’ treatment, what was left was an undiagnostic, chimeric type specimen for S. rostromajor (MNHN.RJN 134) and the genus Steneosaurus was redefined using a new type species that was not accepted by some researchers. In addition, since the Eudes-Deslongchampses, there has been no attempt to rectify this taxonomic nightmare;\"\n\nYou just showed it was diagnostic, Steel long ago got rid of the chimaeric portion, Eudes-Deslongchamps' stupid attempts to name new type species have no relevance, and you have done the work to finally rectify this taxonomic nightmare.\n\n\"Due to these three significant factors (uncertainty of variable characters, poor preservation and\n\nunreasonable name), we have concluded that S. rostromajor, and therefore ‘Steneosaurus’ (MNHN.RJN 134c-d), cannot be confidently assigned to an existing teleosauroid species.\"\n\nNope, you just showed it can be assigned to the same species as S. edwardsi.\n\nActually, I correct myself. THIS is the worst rationale for rejecting Steneosaurus- \"In addition, MNHN.RJN 134c-d was initially diagnosed based on significant orbital and temporal characteristics (from the metriorhynchid MNHN.RJN 134a-b), along with generic rostral ones. Because the skull material is now known to be from a metriorhynchid, this ‘hybrid type specimen’ factor adds to the doubtful validity of Steneosaurus. According to Article 23.8 of the ICZN Code, ‘a species-group name established for an animal later found to be a hybrid (Art. 17) must not be used as the valid name for either of the parental species (even if it is older than all other available names for them)’ (this also signifies that the species name rostromajor is itself invalid). As such, MNHN.RJN 134c-d serves as an undiagnostic specimen; we, therefore, consider MNHN.RJN 134c-d to be a nomen dubium and, as such, Steneosaurus is treated as an undiagnostic genus.\"\n\nIf the term \"parental species\" didn't tip you off, Article 23.8 applies to hybrid individuals (those resulting from different species interbreeding), not type specimens chimaerically combined from multiple species. The Article doesn't even say what Johnson et al. think- it says a name for a hybrid can't be used for either of the species that bred to make it, so that e.g. even if a mule's scientific name was erected prior to that of horse's or ass's, it can't be the name for horse or ass. And indeed even the cited Article 17 says that hybrids and chimaeras can be the basis of valid names- \"The availability of a name is not affected even if 17.1. it is found that the original description or name-bearing type specimen(s) relates to more than one taxon, or to parts of animals belonging to more than one taxon; or 17.2. it is applied to a taxon known, or later found, to be of hybrid origin...\"\n\nIf Johnson et al.'s interpretation were right, there goes Gojirasaurus, Protoavis, Chuandongocoelurus, Chilantaisaurus, Fukuiraptor, Coelurus, Alectrosaurus, Dakotaraptor, etc..\n\nBefore the big reveal, we have in the Conclusion what can only be described as a lie- \"Through character comparison-and-elimination, the only taxon with which MHNH.RJN 134c-d could hypothetically be referred to is ‘S.’ edwardsi, but the two do not share any clear autapomorphic characters or a unique combination of characters.\"\n\nWhat are your seven listed characters if not \"a unique combination of characters\"? Does any other teleosaurid have them? If not, they are unique. In any case, we get the motivation for dumping Steneosaurus twice at the end of the paper-\n\n\"We believe that establishing teleosauroid taxonomy from the beginning with a series of ‘clean’ type species/specimens, with every nomenclatural act correctly formulated, is the best course of action, which we will highlight in a forthcoming paper (Johnson, 2019).\"\n\n\"We believe that establishing teleosauroid taxonomy from the beginning with a series of ‘clean’ type species/specimens, with every nomenclatural act correctly formulated, is the best course of action. This will necessitate a revised teleosauroid taxonomy, in which species previously referred to the genus Steneosaurus are given new generic names. This work will be published by us in a separate contribution, based on the comprehensive teleosauroid phylogenetic analysis in Johnson’s PhD thesis (2019).\"\n\nBasically everything I hate about a current trend in vertebrate paleontology- just throw out old specimens and dishonor their authors who correctly reported what was new at the time to come up with your own names. At least dumping Stegosaurus armatus or designating a neotype for Allosaurus fragilis could be claimed to save time and effort actually analysing the types, if you don't want to do the science to figure out if armatus is actually different from stenops or if fragilis can be distinguished from Saurophaganax. But Johnson et al. already did all the hard work and found Steneosaurus edwardsi was S. rostromajor, they would just rather use Johnson's new genus name for the taxon.\n\nAnd their reasons are just grasping at straws. 'Sure we identified these seven charactesrs uniquely shared by Steneosaurus rostromajor and S. edwardsi, but uhh.. could be sexually dimorphic? Or anything could be individual variation. Or ontogenetic? Lots of things turn out to be ontogenetic. Plus it's broken. Sooo broken. Sure we could evaluate characters, but who wants a taxon whose holotype isn't pristine? Plus a lot of people had stupid ideas about Steneosaurus over the past two hundred years. What do us scientists do when we have a complicated situation to resolve that was only partially understood historically? Trash their names and give yourselves credit for new genera.' Thus Steneosaurus gets the eternal identity of \"all evidence points to it being Johnsonosaurus edwardsi, but ehhh... we just sort of ignore it now as Teleosauridae indet. and it's forgotten.\"\n\nTo conclude, Steneosaurus is really outside my wheelhouse. But if Johnson et al.'s philosophy spreads, we're in danger of losing a lot of historical taxonomy and deserved credit to lazy or selfish authors. Just look at Microraptor for example, whose holotype of M. zhaoianus lacks a decent skull. Some decades down the line, what if cranial differences support various Jiufotang species and someone's like 'the postcranial proportions are unique between the M. zhaoianus type and M. hanqingi, but I want a complete type specimen, so Microraptor is an invalid undiagnostic nomen dubium, and instead I propose Mybetterraptorgenus hanqingi and M. gui.' Just hope they don't pull a Wilson and Upchurch and claim 'Microraptor is invalid and co-ordinate suprageneric Linnean taxa must likewise be abandoned' and replace Microraptorinae with Mybetterraptorgenusinae.\n\nReferences- Johnson, 2019.

In light of Cau's recent post on the supposed new Mexican deinocheirid \"Paraxenisaurus normalensis\" (Serrano-Brañas et al., 2020), I figured I'd check the taxon out to see what I thought.\n\nThe first thing you might note are the quotation marks surrounding its name, as this is yet another example of authors not including an lsid or reference to ZooBank in their electronic descriptions. ICZN Article 8.5.3. states names published electronically must \"be registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature (ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself that such registration has occurred\", and the pre-print is said to be in preparation for Volume 101 of Journal of South American Earth Sciences, cited as August 2020. Thus it gets to join the ranks of \"Thanos\" and \"Trierarchuncus\"as theropods that will eventually be validly named this year. But at least it's not stuck in the purgatory of twelve Scientific Reports Mesozoic theropods, which will never be physically published and thus will remain invalid unless outside action is taken.\n\nOne of the big takeaways from Cau's blogpost is that \"I am doubtful about the possibility of referring these elements [the paratypes] to the same species of the holotype, since there are very few superimposable elements among the three specimens. Therefore, there is a risk that Paraxenisaurus , - understood as the sum of all three specimens - is a chimera.\" After reading the paper, Andrea REALLY undersold this critique. Here are the specimen materials lists, with the overlapping elements highlighted in matching colors-\n\n(BENC 2/2-001; proposed holotype) proximal manual phalanx II-2 or III-3, partial astragalocalcaneum, partial metatarsal II, phalanx II-1 (115 mm), proximal phalanx II-2, partial metatarsal III, proximal phalanx III-3, distal metatarsal IV, phalanx IV-1 (104 mm), phalanx IV-3 (67 mm), phalanx IV-4 (45 mm), partial pedal ungual IV\n\n(BENC 1/2-0054) distal metacarpal I, proximal phalanx I-1, partial manual ungual I, distal metacarpal II, distal phalanx II-2\n\n(BENC 1/2-0091) several proximal caudal central fragments (66, 75, 76 mm), proximal metacarpal II, partial metacarpal III, distal femur (155 mm trans), distal metatarsal IV\n\n(BENC 1/2-0092) several distal caudal vertebrae (70, 71 mm)\n\n(BENC 30/2-001) pedal ungual II, pedal ungual III\n\nAs you can see, there's only one strict overlap, with BENC 1/2-0091 sharing a distal metatarsal IV with the proposed holotype, found ~14 kilometers away. The paper lists no proposed apomorphies or unique combination of characters for distal metatarsal IV, and indeed the description states they preserve largely non-overlapping portions-\n\n\"In the holotype, the distal articular surface is fragmented (Figures 11a1 and 11a2); but in the referred specimen (BENC ½-0091), this surface is nicely preserved and has a non-ginglymoid outline (Figures 11b1 and 11b2). The medial condyle is mostly preserved in the holotype (Figure 11a3), but in the referred specimen it is completely broken (Figure 11b3). Conversely, the lateral condyle is broken in the holotype (Figure 11a4), but is well preserved in the referred specimen (Figure 11b4). Collateral ligament fossae are well developed on both condyles and have approximately the same size and depth (Figures 11a3 and 11b4). In cross-section, the shaft of metatarsal IV near the distal end is thicker dorsoventrally than wide.\"\n\nNeedless to say, metatarsal IV has a shaft which is deeper than wide in all ornithomimosaurs, and the preserved ligament fossae are on opposite sides in each specimen (medial in proposed holotype, lateral in 1/2-0091). Below is a figure comparing the two Mexican specimens with Ornithomimus velox, with 1/2-0091 flipped so that all are comparable as left elements. I don't see anything the \"Paraxenisaurus\" specimens have in common that could diagnose a taxon.\n\nLeft distal metatarsal IV of (left to right) intended \"Paraxenisaurus normalensis\" holotype BENC 2/2-001, intended \"Paraxenisaurus normalensis\" paratype BENC 1/2-0091 (right element flipped), and Ornithomomus velox holotype YPM 542 in (top to bottom) dorsal, lateral, ventral and medial views (\"Paraxenisaurus\" after Serrano-Brañas et al., 2020; Ornithomimus after Claessens and Loewen, 2016).\n\nWhile no other elements are exactly matched, referred specimen BENC 30/2-001 does include pedal unguals II and III, while the intended holotype has pedal ungual IV. These are again from different localities, although closer this time (~2.8 km), and this time we have characters listed in the diagnosis-\n\n\"(9) distinctively broad and ventrally curved pedal unguals that angled downward with respect to the proximal articular surface and depending on the digit, the proximodorsal process becomes slightly enlarge and changes its position from nearly horizontal to mostly vertical, adopting a lipshaped appearance; and (10) pedal unguals with a rounded, large foramen on the medial side* and a deep ventral fossa that surrounds a strongly developed, ridge-like flexor tubercle.\"\n\nPedal unguals of (left to right) intended \"Paraxenisaurus normalensis\" paratype BENC30/2-001 right digit II, right digit III and intended \"Paraxenisaurus normalensis\" holotype BENC 2/2-001 left digit IV in (top to bottom) right, left, proximal and dorsal views (after Serrano-Brañas et al., 2020). Green lines point to supposedly natural median foramen\n\nVentral curvature is plesiomorphic, the unguals of BENC 30/2-001 are not broader than other ornithomimosaurs', and ventral angling with the proximal end held vertically is common in theropods and present in e.g. Garudimimus and Beishanlong. The proximodorsal process \"changing its position\" is using a difference between 30/2-001's mostly horizontal processes and the intended holotype's more vertical process as character, which in itself presupposes they are the same taxon. The ventral fossa surrounding a ridge-like flexor tubercle is also present in Harpymimus, Garudimimus, Beishanlong and large Dinosaur Park unguals (NMC 1349, RTMP 1967.19.145) and is not shown in the intended holotype but is claimed to be \"partially broken.\" This leaves the medial foramen, which might be a valid character in unguals III and IV (II is damaged in that area), but might also be taphonomic, as there are many other small circular areas of damage (e.g. center of proximal surface of ungual IV). While the two unguals in 30/2-001 are similar to each other, that of the intended holotype is more strongly curved, has that smaller more dorsally angled proximodorsal process, is wider in proximal view, and lacks the expanded ventral half characteristic of ornithomimosaurs that is present in the other specimen. But even if these two pedal unguals are correctly referred, they are all that's present in specimen BENC 30/2-001. So they get us nowhere in determining caudal, manual (besides proximal manual phalanx II-2 or III-3) or femoral morphology.\n\nThe final issue I noticed was the emphasis on \"Paraxenisaurus\" having a first pedal digit. This would ironically be unlike Deinocheirus, but plesiomorphically shared with Nedcolbertia, \"Grusimimus\", Garudimimus, Beishanlong, Archaeornithomimus and Sinornithomimus. The character state is based on metatarsal II, where \"a facet on the posterior surface of the distal quarter of this shaft, indicates the presence of an articulation area for metatarsal I.\" The figure shows a longitudinal groove extending down the posterior center of distal metatarsal II, which as anyone who has scored taxa for Clarke's bird matrix could tell you, is not how non-birds attach their hallux to the metatarsus. Hattori (2016) for instance writes in Allosaurus \"there is no attachment scar corresponding to the metatarsal I fossa on either medial or plantar aspect of MT II\" and in Citipati \"there is no obvious attachment scar of MT I on either medial or plantar aspect of MT II.\" Serrano-Brañas et al. state \"in Garudimimus brevipes ... the attachment site is also placed in the same area as in Paraxenisaurus normalensis\", but the feature in Garudimimus is a raised scar with sharp medial demarcation from the shaft. As Middleton (2003) recognized, this scar is for the m. gastrocnemius, specifically the m. gastrocnemius pars medialis (Carrano and Hutchinson, 2002), and I'll note it's present even in Gallimimus which lacks pedal digit I (Osmolska et al., 1972: Plate XLIX Fig. 1b). \"Paraxenisaurus\"'s groove is then more likely to be the m. flexor digitorum longus II tendon, which \"passed through the ventral groove in its respective metatarsal to insert serially on each of the pedal phalanges\" in e.g. Tyrannosaurus (Carrano and Hutchinson, 2002).\n\nLeft metatarsal II in ventral view of (left to right) intended \"Paraxenisaurus normalensis\" holotype BENC 2/2-001 (after Serrano-Brañas et al., 2020; yellow arrow points to supposed articulation for metatarsal I), Garudimimus brevipes holotype IGM 100/13 (after Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005; line points to supposed articulation for metatarsal I), Gallimimus bullatus ZPAL MgD-I/94 (after Osmolska et al., 1972), and Tyrannosaurus rex FMNH PR2081 (after Brochu, 2003).\n\nWhat exactly is \"Paraxenisaurus\"? Comparison is hindered by the specimens being figured mixed together, and the figures are not in numerical order in the preprint, being shown in the order of- 1, 10-19, 2, 20-23, 3-9. In addition, the scale bars vary within the same figure (e.g. phalanx IV-1 is proximally ~61 mm wide in figure 14a but ~93 mm wide in figure 14e) and the listed measurements are different yet (e.g. IV-1 is listed as 83 mm wide). Thus any composite reconstruction is necessarily approximate. The supposed manual element is too fragmentary to give much information, but it is of the appropriate size and shape to be a proximal pedal phalanx I-1. This would make more sense preservationally since the other material preserved in the specimen is all from the tarsus and pes. It's a shame the astragalocalcaneum is not described better or figured in more views, as the dorsal (= proximal?) perspective has many broken surfaces and edges, so that e.g. the small calcaneum might be preservational. The fused proximal tarsals are like ceratosaurs, deinocheirids (Deinocheirus plus Hexing), alvarezsaurids and caenagnathids. Having any sense of the ascending process morphology could tell us much. Metatarsal II is not obviously deeper than wide, unlike ornithomimosaurs (except Harpymimus; unreported in deinocheirids), but like carcharodontosaurids, therizinosauroids, some oviraptorids and velociraptorines. The proximal outline of metatarsal III would at first glance appear to be the strangest thing about this material, being reconstructed as strictly dorsoventrally oval unlike all(?) other theropods. Tilting it and adding a posterior tapered tip results in a close match to Majungasaurus however (see figure below). If it is an unreduced proximal metatarsal III, tyrannosauroids, most ornithomimosaurs, alvarezsauroids and pennaraptorans would be excluded. Proximal phalanx II-2 lacks a proximoventral heel, so is not from a deinonychosaur. The pedal phalanges are too elongate to be therizinosauroid, and the pedal ungual is too broad. Phalanges are not as dorsoventrally compressed as Mapusaurus, and as noted above they lack the ventrolateral shelves found in ornithomimosaurs. Abelisaurid phalanges seem similar however. I wonder if we have a case like Camarillasaurus or probably Dandakosaurus involving misidentified elements making the specimen seem stranger than it really was, with so many edges of supposed metatarsal III dotted to indicate incompleteness that it could actually be metatarsal II or IV. Certainly nothing connects this specimen with Deinocheirus. As per the numerous errors illustrated by Hartman et al. (2019) nobody should trust Choiniere et al.'s scorings in any case. The Lori matrix recovers \"Paraxenisaurus\" as a ceratosaur closest to Aucasaurus as far as taxa with well preserved feet are concerned, but also doesn't include characters particular to ceratosaurs and isn't great with pedal characters in general. So I would place the specimen as Neotheropoda incertae sedis (or even indet.) pending a better description of the tarsus and of the real bone surfaces on supposed proximal metatarsal III.\n\nPes of \"Paraxenisaurus normalensis\" holotype (center) in dorsal view compared to Majungasaurus crenatissimus composite (left) and Deinocheirus mirificus referred specimen IGM 100/127 (right). Colored proximal view of \"Paraxenisaurus\" is after Serrano-Brañas et al., with reoriented metatarsal III as per my interpretation shown above that. Note \"Paraxenisaurus\" elements were scaled using their scale bars, whereas scaling to listed measurements results in different proportions, so those should be seen as approximate. \"Paraxenisaurus\" after Serrano-Brañas et al. (2020), Majungasaurus after Carrano (2007) and Deinocheirus after Lee et al. (2014).\n\nReferences- Osmólska, Roniewicz and Barsbold, 1972. A new dinosaur, Gallimimus bullatus n. gen., n. sp.

It's a pseudo-toucan, with a long, tall snout formed mostly by the maxilla unlike modern birds. O'Connor et al. recover it as an enantiornithine using Brusatte et al.'s TWiG analysis and O'Connor's bird analysis. Our problem is that we only have the anteroventral skull preserved, so no braincase, mandible or postcrania. And being a Maastrichtian deposit in Africa, we don't have the most detailed coelurosaur record. Add in the fact beaks are known to evolve fast on islands (as Madagascar was even back then) and we have a potential problem on our hands.\n\nFollow your nose to the exciting topic of African coelurosaur diversity. Reconstructed holotype skull of Falcatakely forsterae (UA 10015) (after O'Connor et al., 2020).\n\nThe Lori analysis places Falcatakely in two potential positions- a therizinosaurid or an omnivoropterygid. The former doesn't make much sense biostratigraphically, but there is a Maevarano synsacrum of the correct size (FMNH PA 741) that was claimed to share characters with Sapeornis by O'Connor and Forster (2010). So there's a possibility. Forcing Falcatakely to be an enantiornithine as in O'Connor et al.'s analyses requires six more steps. Most of the discordant characters relate to the beak, but the wide laterotemporal fenestra would be odd in an enantiornithine. While I was writing this, Andrea Cau published a post on this topic and reported that he recovered Falcatakely as a noasaurid, which would be quite the phylogenetic jump, but it only takes three more steps in the Lori matrix, so is more parsimonious than the enantiornithine option. It falls out as an elaphrosaurine, so could relate to e.g. Afromimus. The non-beak contradictory characters here include a lack of antorbital fossa lacrimal foramen, long posterior lacrimal process and triradiate palatine, which seem more convincing to me. Additional evidence against these latter two positions is the absence of small ceratosaur (Masiaksaurus is twice as big) or large enantiornithine (Maevarano elements are much smaller) postcrania. Andrea reported (translated) \"It takes 6 further steps to place it in Coelurosauria, and in that case it is a basal dromaeosaurid: interesting in that regard to note that Rahonavis , known from the same Formation, has also been hypothesized to be a basal dromaeosaurid. Can we rule out that Falcatakely is the (still unknown) skull of Rahonavis? The estimated dimensions of the two animals coincide.\" Forcing Falcatakely to be Rahonavis only requires one more step, which is pretty impressive. In their (amazing) osteology, Forster et al. (2020) refer an isolated dentary \"found near the Rahonavis holotype (its precise location was not recorded during excavation)\" which does not match Falcatakely's upper jaw, being upcurved and extensively toothed. But it is similar to other unenlagiines like Buitreraptor and Austroraptor. So much as we have two synsacrum types at this size, unenlagiine-like Rahonavis and Sapeornis-like, we have two cranial types, unenlagiine-like and Falcatakely which is Sapeornis-like in the combination of reduced maxillary dentition, triradiate palatine, modified/reduced antorbital fossa, anteriorly limited naris and strong postorbital-jugal articulation.\n\nReferred dentary of Rahonavis ostromi (FMNH PA 740) as a transparent CT reconstruction (after Forster et al., 2020).\n\nThus my best guess is that Falcatakely is a basal avialan belonging to the same taxon as FMNH PA 741. But this comes with a huge chunk of salt as it is so far removed temporally and geographically from potential comparable sister taxa. Which is actually a common problem with this part of the tree, as shown by Balaur (= Elopteryx?), Hesperonychus, Imperobator and even Rahonavis itself. We compare these Late Cretaceous taxa to our far more complete Early Cretaceous Jehol record and say Hesperonychus is sorta like Microraptor, Falcatakely is kind of like Sapeornis and Balaur is Jeholornis-grade, but North America, Africa and Europe had their own avialan fauna for 70 million years before them that we're basically unaware of. If the only alvarezsauroid we had was Mononykus' holotype, could we place it correctly as a basal maniraptoran? If the only oviraptorosaur we had was Citipati's skull, would we recover that correctly as the sister taxon of Paraves? I think that's the position we find ourselves in with Falcatakely, and that future discoveries of African small theropods will lead to new interpretations.\n\nReferences- O'Connor and Forster, 2010.

I realize it's been ten months since the last post, and that's because I've been prioritizing updating the Database over writing blogs. As a compromise of sorts and to not force people to constantly check the Database updates page, I decided to try out posting when I update including features that could have made it into their own blog post.\n\nOne thing I've been doing is working my way through Skawiński et al.'s (2017) paper on Polish Triassic dinosaur reports, which in addition to unnamed fragments, also led to the creation of entries for two supposed Megalosaurus species. silesiacus is a generic carnivorous archosauriform tooth too early to be dinosaurian, while cloacinus has been used for basically every carnivorous archosaur tooth from Rhaetian beds of Germany. The interesting thing about the latter is that workers apparently forgot that it was based on lost teeth described by Quenstedt, not the SMNS tooth figured 47 years later by Huene.\n\n\"Zanclodon\" silesiacus Jaekel, 1910\n\n= Megalosaurus silesiacus (Jaekel, 1910) Kuhn, 1965\n\nEarly Anisian, Middle Triassic\n\nLower Gogolin Formation, Lower Muschelkalk, Poland\n\nHolotype- (University of Griefswalden/Göttinger coll.; lost?) tooth (24x12x5 mm)\n\nReferred- ?(Geological Museum of the Polish Geological Institute-National Research Institute coll.) tooth (Skawiński, Ziegler, Czepiński, Szermański, Tałanda, Surmik and Niedźwiedzki, 2017)\n\n?(Silesian University of Technology, Faculty of Mining and Geology coll.) tooth (37 mm) (Surmik and Brachaniec, 2013)\n\nComments- Jaekel (1910) noted (translated) \"a dinosaur tooth from the lower shell limestone of Upper Silesia, which would probably be the oldest known dinosaur tooth to date. It comes from the Chorzov strata of the lower shell limestone of Gogolin, Upper Silesia, and came to me through the kindness of engineer Fedder in Opole. The crown shown is 24 mm high, 12 mm wide and 5 mm thick, so it is quite strongly compressed and slightly curved backwards. Its edge is extremely finely serrated (Fig. 16 A). I call the form, which for the time being cannot be specified generically, Zanclodon silesiacus. The only difference between [phytosaur Mesorhinosuchus] and this tooth form lies in the fact that the former is somewhat thicker, somewhat less bent back, and that no notch can be detected on the edge.\" He referred it to Megalosauridae, and Kuhn (1965) later referred it to the genus Megalosaurus. Carrano et al. (2012) correctly noted \"could be considered as Theropoda indet., but we cannot rule out the possibility that it represents a 'rauisuchian' archosaur.\" Surmik and Brachaniec (2013) describe a tooth from Gogolin Quarry in which \"a poor state of preservation makes it impossible to identification of the presence of edge serration, however it still shows a slightly curvature and specific both sides flattening\" and identify it as seemingly archosaurian. Skawiński et al. (2017) listed this and another tooth labeled as Megalosaurus silesiacus as other material of Zanclodon silesiacus. The latter tooth is stated to be serrated mesially and distally with a density of 12 per 5 mm. They describe the holotype tooth as \"Probably lost\" and \"lost\", and place all three teeth as Archosauromorpha indet.. They are more specifically referred to the Teyujagua plus archosauriform clade here given the recurvature and small serrations, as authors from Kuhn onward have noted plesiomorphic theropod teeth are difficult to distinguish from several clades of archosauriforms (e.g. erythrosuchids, euparkeriids) known from the Anisian. The age is far too early for Megalosaurus or another neotheropod, and the presence of serrations is unlike Zanclodon, so neither genus is appropriate. It should also be noted the three Gogolin teeth differ in shape with the Silesian University specimen less recurved and less tapered than the other two, while the Polish Geological Institute specimen is shorter than the holotype and less concave distally. This could be positional variation, but given the lack of proposed synapomorphies could easily represent multiple taxa.\n\nReferences- Jaekel, 1910.

He also figures a smaller tooth which has mesial serrations apically that transition to a rounded edge basally. These teeth do not share any obvious synapomorphies and differ in elongation (height/FABL ~300% vs. 138%) and transverse thickness (42% vs. 75% of FABL), so may not belong to the same taxon. Miller Endlich (1870) figured seven teeth from the type locality, stating (translated) they \"are mostly flat teeth, slightly curved on one side, with fine serrations on the sharp inner edge. The convex side, the back, does not seem to be serrated, but it is not certain.\" The figured teeth show a wide range of variation, with figure 13 in particular being stout and unrecurved with large serrations, similar to the Lucianosaurus paratype and similarly referrable to Archosauromorpha incertae sedis. The other teeth have small serrations, with 14 and 18 being straight and 15-17 and 19 being recurved, with 14, 18 and 15 being progressively more transversely compressed. As with the syntypes, these exhibit variation which could be positional or interspecific, and share no obvious characters that connect them to each other or the syntypes. Roemer (1870) wrote (translated) \"In the Stuttgart Museum I saw teeth from the bone breccia of Bebenhausen near Tubingen, which show the same fine serration of the side edges as the teeth described by Quenstedt, but are not curved in a sickle shape, but are straight. It is very likely that these latter teeth belong to the same dinosaur as the crooked teeth. With these straight teeth from Bebenhausen, the tooth shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 from the Lisów Breccia from Lubsza near Woźniki completely coincides. The double-edged tooth, which is very delicately and regularly notched at the edges, shows a more strongly curved (outer) and a less curved (inner) surface, both of which are smooth except for a very fine, irregular wrinkle. There is also a much smaller tooth of the same type from the same location.\" The straight Bebenhausen teeth sound similar to Miller Endlich's figures 14 and 18, although the illustrated straight tooth from Lubsza differs from these in having an increased amount of mesiodistal expansion basally. The Lubsza tooth also has this marked basal expansion labiolingually, and both types of root expansion are atypical of dinosaurs, suggesting this is some other type of vertebrate. Dzik and Sulej (2007) suggested it \"may have belonged to a phytosaur\" without evidence but Skawiński et al. (2017) stated \"phytosaur fossils have not been found in the upper Keuper strata in Silesia\" and instead placed it in Archosauromorpha indet.. While this could merely mean phytosaurs were rare in that strata, phytosaur teeth don't seem to have expanded roots either (e.g. Nicrosaurus), and it could even be a fish tooth which often have these types of root expansion. Huene (1905) listed the species as \"Plateosaurus\" cloacinus within Theropoda, stating it includes Rhaetian dentary \"Zanclodon cambrensis\". In 1908 he places it in Plateosauridae within Theropoda and states (translated) \"The originals can no longer be found. The Tübingen collection still has several teeth from Bebenhausen and Schloßlesmuehle, which can be reconciled well with [Quenstedt's] fig. 12 (l. c.), but are larger. The serrations are coarse and short, the mesial carina does not extend all the way to the base.\" He illustrated a tooth in figure 274 as \"From the Rhaetian Bonebed of Bebenhausen near Tübingen. Tooth in nat. Size. The tip is missing. Original in the natural history cabinet in Stuttgart.\" Regarding cambrensis, Huene states \"The teeth have the greatest resemblance to Plateosaurus cloacinus both in the whole shape and in the serrations. Whether it is really the same or just a very similar species, of course, cannot be decided with certainty given the scanty material\", which is not explicit enough to evaluate given published details. Huene later (1932) assigns cloacinus to Teratosauridae within Carnosauria, listed as both Pachysaurus cloacinus (pg. 6) and Gresslyosaurus cloacinus (pg. 72, 114). Steel (1970) calls it Gresslyosaurus cloacinus within Plateosauridae. Buffetaut et al. (1991) mentions \"A tooth referred to Megalosaurus cloacinusQuenstedt, from the Lower Hettangian of the Calcaire de Valognes at Valognes (Manche), [which] has been mentioned by Rioult (1978a) as having been destroyed by an air raid on the University of Caen in 1944.\" Without additional details, it can only be said that the timing suggests a neotheropod. Carrano et al. (2012) incorrectly claimed SMNS 52457, apparently the tooth in Huene's (1908) figure 274, is \"the holotype and only specimen\" of cloacinus, when Huene stated it was only one of \"Many teeth ... in the stone quarries of the Schoenbuch (e.g. Bebenhausen, Schloesslesmuehle), Wuerttemberg; in the university collection in Tubingen and in the natural history cabinet in Stuttgart\", and that Quenstedt's originals were lost. SMNS 52457 could be made into a neotype, but this must be done explicitly (ICZN Article 75.3) and so has not been "
