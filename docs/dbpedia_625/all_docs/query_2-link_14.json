        "text": "This timeline of ankylosaur research is a chronological listing of events in the history of paleontology focused on the ankylosaurs, quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaurs who were protected by a covering bony plates and spikes and sometimes by a clubbed tail. Although formally trained scientists did not begin documenting ankylosaur fossils until the early 19th century, Native Americans had a long history of contact with these remains, which were generally interpreted through a mythological lens. The Delaware people have stories about smoking the bones of ancient monsters in a magic ritual to have wishes granted and ankylosaur fossils are among the local fossils that may have been used like this.[1] The Native Americans of the modern southwestern United States tell stories about an armored monster named Yeitso that may have been influenced by local ankylosaur fossils.[2] Likewise, ankylosaur remains are among the dinosaur bones found along the Red Deer River of Alberta, Canada where the Piegan people believe that the Grandfather of the Buffalo once lived.[3]\n\nThe first scientifically documented ankylosaur remains were recovered from Early Cretaceous rocks in England and named Hylaeosaurus armatus by Gideon Mantell in 1833.[4] However, the Ankylosauria itself would not be named until Henry Fairfield Osborn did so in 1923 nearly a hundred years later.[5] Prior to this, the ankylosaurs had been considered members of the Stegosauria, which included all armored dinosaurs when Othniel Charles Marsh named the group in 1877. It was not until 1927 that Alfred Sherwood Romer implemented the modern use of the name Stegosauria as specifically pertaining to the plate-backed and spike-tailed dinosaurs of the Jurassic that form the ankylosaurs' nearest relatives.[6] The next major revision to ankylosaur taxonomy would not come until Walter Coombs divided the group into the two main families paleontologists still recognize today; the nodosaurids and ankylosaurids.[5] Since then, many new ankylosaur genera and species have been discovered from all over the world and continue to come to light. Many fossil ankylosaur trackways have also been recognized.[7]\n\nPrescientific\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Delaware people of what is now New Jersey or Pennsylvania had a tradition regarding a hunting party that returned with a piece of an ancient bone supposedly belonging to a monster that killed humans. One of the village's wise men instructed people to burn bits of the bone in clay spoons with tobacco and make a wish while the concoction was still smoking. This ritual could bestow such favors as success in hunting, long life, and health for one's children. This tale might be inspired by local fossils, which include ankylosaurs, Coelosaurus, Dryptosaurus, and Hadrosaurus.[1]\n\nTraditional Navajo creation mythology portrays modern Earth as the most recent of a series of worlds. They believe that the earlier worlds were inhabited by monsters that were killed with lightning bolts wielded by the heroic Monster Slayers.[8] The most terrifying monster of the old worlds was the Big Gray Monster, Yeitso.[9] The Navajo of Arizona feared fossil remains, attributing them to his corpse. They believe that Yeitso's ghost still haunts his remains.[10] Yeitso's flint-like scales may have been inspired by the fossilized armored plates of various prehistoric creatures that once lived in what is now the western US. Ankylosaurs like Ankylosaurus are one such potential candidate for the source of Yeitso's armored hide. Others include non-ankylosaurs like the Permian amphibian Eryops, Triassic phytosaurs and Desmatosuchus, as well as other armored dinosaurs like Scutellosaurus or Stegosaurus.[2]\n\nThe Piegan people of Alberta attributed the fossils of dinosaurs to the \"grandfather of the buffalo\" they left offerings of cloth and tobacco to this mythical creature near the Red Deer River. Ankylosaur remains are among those preserved in the area that helped inspire this legend and associated practice, as are the remains of ceratopsians, hadrosaurs, and carnivorous theropods.[3]\n\n19th century\n\n[edit]\n\n1830s\n\n[edit]\n\n1832\n\nQuarry workers discovered a fossilized partial skeleton. The remains were sent to paleontologist Gideon Mantell, who recognized that they represented a significant scientific discovery.[11]\n\nMantell reported the specimen discovered by quarry workers that would later be formally named Hylaeosaurus to the Geological Society.[11]\n\n1833\n\nGideon Mantell described the new genus and species Hylaeosaurus armatus.[12] This was the first ankylosaur ever discovered, although the group itself would not be recognized and named for many years.[13]\n\n1840s\n\n[edit]\n\n1842\n\nEarly April\n\nSir Richard Owen published his second report on British fossil reptiles, wherein he formally named the Dinosauria.[14] Hylaeosaurus was included as a founding member and was the third dinosaur to be named.[15]\n\n1843\n\nFitzinger described the new species Hylaeosaurus mantellii.[12]\n\n1844\n\nMantell described the new species Hylaeosaurus oweni.[12]\n\n1850s\n\n[edit]\n\n1856\n\nJoseph Leidy described the new genus and species Palaeoscincus costatus.[16] He considered it to be an herbivore.[7]\n\n1858\n\nSir Richard Owen published a study on Hylaeosaurus.[17]\n\n1860s\n\n[edit]\n\n1865\n\nReverend William Fox discovered the Polacanthus type specimen.[18]\n\n1867\n\nSir Richard Owen described the new genus Polacanthus.[19] He also described the new genus and species Acanthopholis horridus.[19]\n\n1869\n\nHarry Govier Seeley described the new species Acanthopholis eucercus and A. macrocercus and A. platypus and A. stereocercus. He also described the new genus and species Cryptosaurus eumerus.[19] He also described the new species Iguanodon phillipsii.[16]\n\n1870s\n\n[edit]\n\n1871\n\nBunzel described the new genus and species Struthiosaurus austriacus.[12] He also described the new genus and species Danubiosaurus anceps.[19]\n\n1875\n\nSeeley erected the new genus Priodontognathus to house the species Iguanodon phillipsii.[16]\n\n1879\n\nSeeley described the new genus and species Anoplosaurus curtonotus and Anoplosaurus major.[19] Seeley also described the new genus and species Eucercosaurus tanyspondylus.[19] He also described the new genus and species Syngonosaurus macrocercus.[16]\n\n1880s\n\n[edit]\n\n1881\n\nSeeley described the new genus Crataeomus, with two new species: C. lepidophorus and C. pawlowitschii. He also described the new genus and species Hoplosaurus ischyrus, the new genus and species Pleuropeltis suessi,[12] and the new genus and species Rhadinosaurus alcinus.[16]\n\nHulke described the new species Hylaeosaurus foxii.[19]\n\n1882\n\nThe British Museum of Natural History bought a large number of fossils from Rev. Fox, including the Polacanthus type specimen.[20]\n\n1888\n\nOthniel Charles Marsh described the new genus and species Priconodon crassus.[16]\n\n1889\n\nMarsh described the new genus and species Nodosaurus textilis.[19]\n\nRichard Lydekker described the new genus Cryptodraco to house the species Cryptosaurus eumerus.[19]\n\n1890s\n\n[edit]\n\n1890\n\nMarsh named the Nodosauridae.[21] He regarded them as relatives of the stegosaurs due to the shared presence of bony plates embedded in the skin.[5]\n\n1892\n\nMarsh described the new genus and species Palaeoscincus latus.[16]\n\n1893\n\nLydekker described the new genus and species Sarcolestes leedsi.[19]\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\n1900s\n\n[edit]\n\n1901\n\nF. A. Lucas described the new species Stegosaurus marshi, and later reclassified it as Polacanthus marshi.[12]\n\n1902\n\nLawrence Lambe described the new genus and species Stereocephalus tutus.[21] He also described the new species Palaeoscincus asper.[16] He regarded ankylosaurs as herbivores.[7]\n\nLucas erected the genus Hoplitosaurus to house the species \"Polacanthus\" marshi.[12]\n\nFranz Nopcsa described the new genus and species Onychosaurus hungaricus.[16]\n\n1905\n\nSamuel Williston described the new genus and species Stegopelta landerensis.[19]\n\n1908\n\nBrown described the new genus and species Ankylosaurus magniventris.[21] He also named the Ankylosauridae and Ankylosaurinae. He followed Marsh's 1890 suggestion that ankylosaurs and stegosaurs were close relatives.[22]\n\n1909\n\nWieland described the new genus and species Hierosaurus sternbergi.[16]\n\n1910s\n\n[edit]\n\n1914\n\nWhile collecting fossils in Dinosaur Provincial Park, William Edmund Cutler discovered the type specimen of an ankylosaur taxon that would later be named Scolosaurus cutleri in his honor. However, while undercutting the specimen it collapsed on him \"resulting in serious upper body injuries.\"[23]\n\n1915\n\nNopcsa described the new species Struthiosaurus transylvanicus.[12]\n\n1918\n\nNopcsa described the new genus and species Leipsanosaurus noricus.[12]\n\n1919\n\nLambe described the new genus and species Panoplosaurus mirus.[21]\n\n1920s\n\n[edit]\n\n1923\n\nHenry Fairfield Osborn named the Ankylosauria.[5]\n\nCharles A. Matley described the new genus and species Lametasaurus indicus.[16]\n\n1924\n\nParks described the new genus and species Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus.[21]\n\nHennig described the new species Polacanthus becklesi.[19]\n\n1927\n\nAlfred Sherwood Romer published the first formal diagnosis for the Ankylosauria.[5] He observed that the anatomy of the stegosaur pelvis and hindlimb as well as their primarily Jurassic age distinguished them from the mainly Cretaceous ankylosaurs. As the Stegosauria originally included all armored dinosaurs, Romer's distinction marked the beginning of the modern use of the name to refer to the plate-backed and spike-tailed dinosaurs.[6]\n\n1928\n\nNopcsa described the new genus Scolosaurus.[21]\n\nCharles Sternberg described the new genus and species Edmontonia longiceps.[21]\n\n1929\n\nNopcsa described the new species Scolosaurus cutleri.[21]\n\nNopcsa described the new genus and species Polacanthoides ponderosus, and the new species Rhodanosaurus lugdunensis.[16]\n\nSternberg described the new genus and species Anodontosaurus lambei.[21]\n\n1930s\n\n[edit]\n\n1930\n\nCharles Whitney Gilmore described the new genus and species Palaeoscincus rugosidens.[12]\n\n1932\n\nSternberg described the new ichnogenus and species Tetrapodosaurus borealis from the Early Cretaceous Gething Formation of British Columbia, Canada. He attributed the tracks to ceratopsians, but they would later be attributed to ankylosaurs.[24]\n\n1933\n\nGilmore described the new genus and species Pinacosaurus grangeri.[22]\n\n1934\n\nChakravarti described the new genus and species Brachypodosaurus gravis.[19]\n\n1935\n\nC. C. Young described the new species Pinacosaurus ninghsiensis.[22]\n\n1936\n\nMehl described the new species Nodosaurus coleii.[19]\n\n1940s\n\n[edit]\n\n1940\n\nRussell concluded that ankylosaurs chewed with a simple straight-up-and-down movement of the jaws and only fed on soft vegetation based on aspects of their skull and tooth anatomy.[7]\n\n1950s\n\n[edit]\n\n1952\n\nEvgeny Maleev described the new genus and species Syrmosaurus viminicaudus,[22] as well as the species S. disparoserratus.[16]\n\nMaleev described the new genus and species Talarurus plicatospineus.[22]\n\n1953\n\nBirger Bohlin described the new genus and species Peishansaurus philemys. He also described the new genus and species Sauroplites scutiger, and the new genus and species Stegosaurides excavatus.[16]\n\n1955\n\nNicholas Hotton regarded ankylosaurs as herbivores.[7]\n\n1956\n\nMaleev described the new species Dyoplosaurus giganteus.[22]\n\n1960s\n\n[edit]\n\n1960\n\nT. H. Eaton described the new genus and species Silvisaurus condrayi.[21]\n\n1963\n\nF. H. Khakimov discovered a new dinosaur track site in Shirkent National Park, Tajikistan.[25]\n\nZakharov and Khakimov reported the dinosaur track site discovered by the latter to the scientific literature.[25]\n\n1964\n\nZakharov described the new ichnogenus and species Macropodosaurus gravis. He attributed it to a theropod, but these tracks are more likely to have been produced by ankylosaurs.[25]\n\n1969\n\nHaas interpreted the ankylosaur diet and consisting of soft plants that ankylosaurs chewed with a simple straight-up-and-down movement of the jaws based on their skull and tooth anatomy.[7]\n\n1970s\n\n[edit]\n\n1970\n\nJohn Ostrom described the new genus and species Sauropelta edwardsorum.[21]\n\n1971\n\nWalter Coombs published landmark research into ankylosaur taxonomy, bringing order to a once \"chaotic and confused\" field of study. He recognized two main groups of ankylosaurs, the Ankylosauridae and Nodosauridae.[5] Coombs interpreted the ankylosaur diet as consisting of soft plants that ankylosaurs chewed with a simple straight-up-and-down movement of the jaws based on their skull and tooth anatomy.[7]\n\nHaubold reported the presence of the ichnospecies Metatetrapous valdensis from the Buckeburg Formation of Germany. This ichnospecies is attributed to ankylosaurs.[26]\n\n1972\n\nCoombs observed that Euoplocephalus was so thoroughly armored that there was even a bony plate protecting its eyelids.[27]\n\n1977\n\nTeresa Maryanska described the new genus Tarchia for the species \"Dyoplosaurus\" giganteus. She also named the new species Tarchia kielanae and the new genus and species Saichania chulsanensis.[22] She followed the scheme proposed by Coombs earlier that decade dividing the ankylosaurs into ankylosaurids and nodosaurids.[5] She also made observations regarding ankylosaur limb posture, noting that while the hind limb was nearly straight up and down, the humerus was oriented at an angle downward and toward the rear of the animal. When studying the ankylosaur tail she noted that the centra of the vertebrae near its tip are fused, which would make it hard for the animal to raise the tail club very high.[7]\n\n1978\n\nKurzanov and Tumanova described the new genus and species Amtosaurus magnus.[19]\n\nCoombs published more work on ankylosaur taxonomy.[5] He noted that ankylosaurs were probably completely unable to walk on their hind legs and published further remarks on ankylosaur limb posture. He argued that while some researchers interpreted some aspects of ankylosaur forelimb anatomy as adaptations for digging, their hoof-like toe nails made this interpretation unlikely.[28]\n\n1979\n\nCoombs interpreted the bony tendons near the tip of the ankylosaur tail as a means to convey the forces generated by the tail musculature closer to the animal's body all the way down to its club.[7]\n\n1980s\n\n[edit]\n\n1980\n\nRalph Molnar described the new genus and species Minmi paravertebra.[22]\n\nPeter Galton described the new genus and species Dracopelta zbyszewskii.[12]\n\n1982\n\nDelair described the new genus Vectensia.[12]\n\n1983\n\nTumanova described the new genus and species Shamosaurus scutatus.[22]\n\nCampbell reported the presence of dinosaur footprints in the Toro Toro Formation of Bolivia which he attributed to sauropods.[29]\n\n1984\n\nKenneth Carpenter attributed the ichnogenus Tetrapodosaurus reported by Sternberg from British Columbia in the 1930s to ankylosaurs rather than ceratopsians.[24] He argued that the most likely trackmaker was Sauropelta.[30]\n\nLeonardi described the dinosaur footprints reported by Campbell the previous year in detail and named them Ligabuichnium bolivianum. Rather than sauropods, Leonardi argued that these tracks were produced by ankylosaurs or ceratopsians although it was difficult ascertain which of these taxa were responsible due to the poor preservation of the tracks.[29]\n\n1986\n\nGalton interpreted the ankylosaur diet and consisting of soft plants that ankylosaurs chewed with a simple straight-up-and-down movement of the jaws based on their skull and tooth anatomy.[7]\n\n1987\n\nPaul Ensom described dinosaur footprints from the Purbeck Beds of England once thought to have been left by sauropods. They are now thought to have been left by ankylosaurs.[31]\n\nTumanova erected the new genus Maleevus to house the species Syrmosaurus disparoserratus.[16] Tumanova followed the scheme proposed by Coombs earlier that decade dividing the ankylosaurs into ankylosaurids and nodosaurids.[5]\n\nGasparini and others reported ankylosaur remains from Antarctica.[5]\n\n1988\n\nRobert Bakker described the new genus and species Denversaurus schlessmani.[21] He also erected the new genus Chassternbergia for the species \"Edmontonia\" rugosidens.\n\n1989\n\nCurrie reported the discovery of a Tetrapodosaurus track from British Columbia. Although he could not confidently identify its stratigraphic origin, the rock preserving the tracks has since been attributed to the Dunvegan Formation.[32]\n\nA worker at the Smoky River Coal Mine near Grande Cache, Alberta alerted the Royal Tyrell Museum to the presence of dinosaur footprints in the area. This site would come to be recognized as the most important ankylosaur track site in the world.[33]\n\n1990s\n\n[edit]\n\n1990\n\nCoombs and Maryanska remarked that the boney secondary palate of the ankylosaur skull would have strengthened it by acting as a brace.[7]\n\nA well-preserved skeleton of Minmi was excavated from the Allaru Formation in Queensland, Australia by the Queensland Museum and catalogued as QM F18101. The skeleton was mostly articulated, including its armor.[34] Since most ankylosaur specimens do not preserve the life arrangement of their armor, QM F18101 represented a rare find.[35] The specimen also preserved the animal's gut contents, the first to be discovered in any armored dinosaur.[36]\n\n1991\n\nLockley argued that the supposed sauropod tracks reported by Ensom from the Purbeck Beds of Dorset, England were actually made by ankylosaurs.[37]\n\nFrank DeCourten discovered dinosaur tracks preserved in the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah that were likely produced by ankylosaurs.[38]\n\n1993\n\nTumanova described the new genus and species Tsagantegia longicranialis.[22]\n\nJerzykiewicz and others reported the presence of borings of unknown cause on the bones of some juvenile Pinacosaurus grangeri from Bayan Mandahu, Inner Mongolia, China.[39]\n\nZ. Dong described the new genus and species Tianchisaurus nedegoaperferima.[16]\n\nThulborn proposed that the tail club of ankylosaurs may actually have functioned as a \"false head\" meant to distract predators. However, this hypothesis has not received much support from the paleontological community, and has been criticized as \"dubiou[s]\".[7]\n\nGrady published an illustration of an ankylosaur trackway from the \"Mine\" site in the Smoky River Coal Mine at Grande Cache, Alberta.[40]\n\n1994\n\nKirkland and Carpenter described the new genus and species Mymoorapelta maysi.[12]\n\nPsihoyos and Knoebber described a dinosaur track site in the Smoky Hill Coal Mine of Grande Cache, Alberta and reported that the site had been destroyed in a rock slide.[41]\n\nWhyte and Romano described the new ichnogenus and species Deltapodus brodericki for dinosaur footprints discovered in the Aalenian-Bajocian Saltwick Formation of Yorkshire, England. The authors attributed the tracks to sauropods, but they may actually have been made by ankylosaurs.[42]\n\nLeonardi concluded that the Bolivian Ligabuichnium tracks were made by an ankylosaur after all.[29]\n\n1995\n\nCarpenter, Dilkes, and Weishampel erected the new genus Niobrarasaurus to house the species Hierosaurus coleii.[19]\n\nCoombs studied the anatomy of the tail of Euoplocephalus and concluded that its club was held just slightly off the ground rather than dragging or held and a significant height. He reiterated observations previously made in 1977 by Maryanska that the fusion of the vertebral centra near the tip of the animal's tail would make it difficult to raise very high.[7]\n\nCoombs described the new genus and species Texasetes pleurohalio.[19]\n\n1996\n\nLee described the new genus and species Pawpawsaurus campbelli.[21]\n\nMolnar reported the existence of a second species of Minmi but did not name it.[22]\n\nBlows described the new species Polacanthus rudgwickensis.[19]\n\n1997\n\nWitmer studied archosaur \"craniofacial pneumaticity\". He concluded that rather than performing a biological function, paranasal sinuses in archosaurs \"are best explained as an optimization of skull architecture\". This cast doubt on various researchers' interpretations of the sometimes complex nasal cavities and sinus systems possessed by ankylosaurs. Past workers had thought that these cavities and sinuses may have given ankylosaurs an improved sense of smell, housed glands, acted as a resonating chamber for loud vocalizations, or helped conserve body heat and moisture.[7]\n\n1998\n\nCarpenter, Miles, and Cloward described the new genus and species Gargoyleosaurus parkpinorum.[22]\n\nKirkland described the new genus and species Gastonia burgei.[22]\n\nPang and Cheng described the new genus and species Tianzhenosaurus youngi.[22]\n\nBarret and others described the new genus and species Shanxia tianzhensis.[16]\n\nSereno defined the ankylosaurs as all eurypods more closely related to Ankylosaurus than to Stegosaurus.[43]\n\nMcCrea and Currie described the dinosaur tracks discovered in the Smoky River Coal Mine at Grand Cache, Alberta. They noted that this was the most important ankylosaur track site ever discovered.[33]\n\nMcCrea and others reported the first known ankylosaur skin impression to be preserved in a footprint tracks preserved in the Dunvegan Formation near Pouce Coupe, Alberta.[44]\n\n1999\n\nGodefroit and others described the new species Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus.[22]\n\nSullivan described the new genus and species Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis.[21]\n\nCarpenter and others described the new genus and species Animantarx ramaljonesi.[12]\n\nLockley and others described the 1991 possible ankylosaur footprint discovery in Utah.[45]\n\nIshigaki reported possible ankylosaur footprints from the Djadokhta Formation of Mongolia.[46]\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\n2000s\n\n[edit]\n\n2000\n\nFord described the new species Edmontonia australis[19] and the new genus and species Glyptodontopelta mimus.[19]\n\nMolnar and Clifford reported fossilized gut contents in a specimen of Minmi, which consisted of plant matter.[39]\n\n2001\n\nRybczynsky and Vickaryous studied the jaws and teeth of Euoplocephalus. Contrary to decades of support for ankylosaurs chewing with a simple straight-up-and-down movement, they noticed visible wear facets and microscopic grooves that could only be explained by relatively complex jaw movements.[7]\n\nBarrett reported wear facets on the teeth of Tarchia.[7]\n\nMolnar and Clifford described the gut contents preserved in a specimen of the Australian ankylosaur Minmi.[47] This specimen is catalogued by the Queensland Museum as QM F18101 and was excavated by the museum from near the Flinders River in 1990.[48] The stomach contents consisted of plant vascular tissue, fruiting bodies, seeds, and possible fern spores.[49] Molnar and Clifford described it as the most reliable evidence for the diet of an herbivorous dinosaur ever discovered.[50]\n\nMcCrea, Lockley, and Meyer observed that by this point in the history of ankylosaur research, ankylosaurs track fossils had been reported from North America, South America, Asia, and Europe. Most of these trackways were preserved in moist floodplain habitats where plant life was abundant.[7] They attributed the Metatetrapous valdensis tracks from the Buckeburg Formation of Germany reported by Haubold in 1971 to ankylosaurs.[26] They similarly argued that Macropodosaurus gravis of Tajikistan was produced by an ankylosaur rather than a theropod.[25] The authors reported a single possible ankylosaur footprint from the Dakota Group of Baca County, Colorado.[51] They also proposed that several footprint specimens collected from the Blackhawk Formation of Utah may have been ankylosaurian.[52]\n\nVickaryous and others described the new genus and species Gobisaurus domoculus.[22]\n\nCarpenter and others described the new genus and species Cedarpelta bilbeyhallorum.[21]\n\nXu, Wang, and You described the new genus and species Liaoningosaurus paradoxus.[19]\n\nFord and Kirkland described the new genus and species Aletopelta coombsi.[19]\n\n2002\n\nDong described the new genus and species Crichtonsaurus bohlini.[12]\n\nAverianov described the new genus and species Amtosaurus archibaldi.[19]\n\n2003\n\nGarcia and Pereda-Superbiola described the new species Struthiosaurus languedocensis.[12]\n\nVickaryous and Russell described the common ways ankylosaur skulls were distorted after death that could potentially confound anatomical interpretation. They noted a relationship between this tendency to suffer distortion and their unusual cranial traits like the fusion of the skull bones and their \"embossing\" cranial ornamentation.[39]\n\n2004\n\nAverianov, 2002, vide Parish & Barrett, 2004 described the new genus and species Bissektipelta archibaldi.[53]\n\n2005\n\nŐsi described the new genus and species Hungarosaurus tormai.[54]\n\n2006\n\nSalgado and Gasparini described the new genus and species Antarctopelta oliveroi.[55]\n\n2007\n\nLü Junchang; Jin Xingsheng; Sheng Yiming; Li Yihong described the new genus and species Zhejiangosaurus lishuiensis.[56]\n\nXu and others described the new genus and species Zhongyuansaurus luoyangensis.[57]\n\n2008\n\nCarpenter and others described the new genus and species Peloroplites cedrimontanus[58]\n\nBurns synonymizes Edmontonia australis with Glyptodontopelta mimus and confirms the validity of the latter[59]\n\n2009\n\nMiles and Miles described the new genus and species Minotaurasaurus ramachandrani.[60]\n\nParsons and Parsons described the new genus and species Tatankacephalus cooneyorum.[61]\n\nArbour and others resurrect the genus and species Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus Parks, 1924[62]\n\n2010s\n\n[edit]\n\n2011\n\nBurns and Sullivan described the new genus and species Ahshislepelta minor.[63]\n\nBurns and others describe new juvenile specimens of Pinacosaurus grangeri[64]\n\nStanford, Weishampel, and DeLeon described the new genus and species Propanoplosaurus marylandicus.[65]\n\n2013\n\nChen and others described the new genus and species Dongyangopelta yangyanensis.[66]\n\nKirkland and others described the new genus and species Europelta carbonensis.[67]\n\nPenkalski described the new genus and species Oohkotokia horneri.[68]\n\nYang and others described the new genus and species Taohelong jinchengensis.[69]\n\n2014\n\nHan and others described the new genus and species Chuanqilong chaoyangensis.[70]\n\nArbour and Currie described the new genus Crichtonpelta.[71]\n\nVictoria M.
