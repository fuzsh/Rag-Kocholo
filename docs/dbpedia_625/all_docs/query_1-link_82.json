Teen Courts are judicial diversion programs which use “positive peer pressure” and other appropriate sanctions to show the youthful offender the consequences of violating the law and the positive side of behaving in a more constructive manner. Teen Courts receive cases from the State Attorney’s Office by referral and local law enforcement agencies through civil citations.\n\nStudents from area middle and high schools volunteer to participate in Teen Court. The responsibilities of Prosecutor, Defense Attorney and Clerk are those of the teen volunteers. The jury is comprised of Teen Court volunteers and former Teen Court offenders. Teen Court offenders must admit guilt before being accepted into the program. The “trial,” will determine an appropriate sentence. Examples of sentencing options include community service, restitution, letters of apology, essays, substance abuse education or counseling, peer group counseling and Teen Court jury duty.\n\nThe Court Administrator’s Office operates the Flagler County and Volusia County Teen Court programs. The St. Johns County Clerk of Court’s office operates a Teen Court program in St. Johns County.\n\nOur Teen Court Flyer (PDF) provides more information about our programs. To become a Teen Court volunteer, or to find out more, contact one of our offices:\n\nFlagler County\n\nKim C. Hammond Justice Center\n\n1769 E.

It is an informal and nonadversarial process designed to help the disputing parties reach a mutually acceptable and voluntary agreement. In mediation, decision making authority rests with the parties.\n\nPursuant to Rule 12.740 of the Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure and Seventh Judicial Circuit Administrative Order FM-2012-027-SC, mediation may be utilized in family law matters.\n\nThe Court may refer appropriate family law cases where the combined incomes of the parties does not exceed $100,000 per year to the Seventh Judicial Circuit’s Family Mediation Program. Orders of Referral are attached to Administrative Order FM-2012-027-SC.\n\nParties in Family Law cases with combined incomes of $100,000 or more per year are not eligible for the Circuit’s Family Mediation Program and must be referred to certified private mediators."
