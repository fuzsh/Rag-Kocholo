        "text": "Liberty University complies with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (“Clery Act”), as amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (“VAWA”); Virginia law; and all other applicable laws.\n\nThe Clery Act, as amended by VAWA, requires higher education institutions to annually report certain information concerning campus security policies and campus crime statistics. These policies and statistics are located in the most recent Liberty University Annual Security Report, available below and at Liberty University Police Department (LUPD).\n\nLiberty University not only complies with the Clery Act, as amended by VAWA but also goes above and beyond mere legal compliance to provide high-level security to its campus community. LUPD, which is Liberty University’s police department, is a full-service law enforcement agency staffed by professional, highly-trained personnel. LUPD operates 24 hours a day, seven days per week, and 365 days per year. It consists of approximately 30 Virginia State certified, sworn, and commissioned Police Officers, 22 Virginia State Certified Armed Security Officers, and eight civilian employees. All officers at LUPD have comprehensive arrest powers. The authority, responsibility, and training of LUPD officers are the same as required of any police officer in the Commonwealth of Virginia. LUPD investigates any and all incidents that occur on any property owned or controlled by Liberty University and has the authority to investigate any incident on any adjacent public roadway. All LUPD personnel is trained in Basic First Aid, CPR, and AED services. LUPD also works in conjunction with the Lynchburg Police Department and other law enforcement agencies and emergency responders to protect the University’s community.\n\nFor more information about campus safety and security at Liberty University, contact LU Emergency Communications by email at LUPD@liberty.edu or by telephone at (434) 592-7641 (Non-Emergency) or (434) 592-3911 (Emergency).\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nLU Safe Ride Program\n\nEmergency Information\n\nCampus Alert System\n\nSexual Assault Awareness\n\nSteps to Report Sexual Assault\n\nCampus Crime Reports"
