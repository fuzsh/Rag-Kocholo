        "text": "We start from the premise that PPC rests on two core constructs – intrusiveness and emotional manipulation – as historically shown. Schaefer 1965a (1965a, p. 555) originally conceptualized PPC as “covert, psychological methods of controlling the child’s activities and behaviors that would not permit the child to develop as an individual apart from the parent.” Schaefer (1965b) first operationalized PPC as a construct in the Children’s Reports of Parental Behavior Inventory (CRPBI) (Schaefer, 1965b). This questionnaire consists of multiple scales that measure intrusiveness (e.g., “asks other people what I do away from home”; “always tells me exactly how to do my work”; “wants to control whatever I do” [emphasis added]) and emotional manipulation (e.g., “feels hurt when I don’t follow advice”; “thinks I am not grateful when I don’t obey” [emphasis added]). PPC research bloomed after Barber (Barber, 1996; Barber et al., 1994) revisited the construct and revised its assessment by creating the Psychological Control Scale – Youth Self-Report (Barber, 1996). Barber et al. (1994) conceptualized PPC as “patterns of family interaction that intrude upon or impede the child’s individuation process, or the relative degree of psychological distance a child experiences from his or her parents and family” (Barber et al., 1994, p.1121) [emphasis added]. These conceptualizations entail intrusiveness in that psychologically controlling parents infringe upon children’s decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Intrusiveness was also recognized and acknowledged as a core facet of PPC in the title of Barber’s book on PPC: “Intrusive parenting: How psychological control affects children and adolescents” (Barber, 2002) [emphasis added]. Moreover, the two most widely used scales to measure PPC – the Psychological Control Scale – Youth Self-Report (Barber, 1996) and the Dependency-Oriented and Achievement-Oriented Psychological Control Scale (Soenens et al., 2010) – capture intrusiveness in their items such as “blames me that I no longer want to do things that we used to enjoy,” “interferes in my problems even if I prefer to solve them myself,” and “shows that she/he is disappointed in me if I do not want to share certain things with him/her” [emphasis added]. Thus, both the theoretical and operational definitions of PPC include intrusiveness.\n\nIntrusiveness first concerns “what” parents aim to control and emphasizes that parents attempt to change their children’s minds on matters that do not warrant parental intervention. Such areas that do not require parents’ intervention are in children’s personal domain, according to Social Domain Theory (Smetana, 1999; Smetana et al., 2014; Smetana & Daddis, 2002). The personal domain includes issues that are outside of legitimate parental authority, such as preference, choice of friends or activities, and the state of one’s body and privacy (Smetana & Daddis, 2002), and personal issues involve boundaries that one forms between the self and the social world (Smetana, 1999). Although intrusiveness may also concern “how” parents intervene in the child’s personal domain as well, intrusiveness – parents intruding into children’s personal domain – is one of the two key facets of PPC.\n\nBarber et al. (2012) subsequently suggested the concept of manipulation as a key facet of PPC. PPC compels children to change themselves and their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Barber et al., 2012). Soenens and Vansteenkiste’s (2010) theoretical work on PPC emphasized the emotional manipulation facet of PPC as well. By instilling guilt and shame, PPC appeals to forces within the child (Soenens & Vansteenkiste, 2010). In addition, PPC tactics such as withdrawing love exploit the parent-child bond and also create anxiety in children to pressure children to act in ways that parents deem desirable (e.g., Choe et al., 2020a). Thus, the PPC literature acknowledged the internal pressure that PPC puts on children to coerce them into obeying their parents. These control tactics associated with PPC – such as inducing guilt, threatening the parent-child bond, and withdrawing love – can be summarized as emotional manipulation.\n\nThe second key facet – emotional manipulation – concerns “how” parents control their child. Psychologically controlling parents pressure children to coerce the children into complying with parents’ wishes (Soenens & Vansteenkiste, 2010). Emotionally manipulative tactics include inducing guilt (e.g., “tells me all the things she/he has done for me”), withdrawing love (e.g., “avoids looking at me when I disappointed her/him”), invalidating feelings (e.g., “tries to change how I feel or think about things”), attacking personally (e.g., “brings up my past mistakes when criticizing me”), constraining verbal expressions (e.g., “changes the subject whenever I have something to say”), and engaging in erratic emotional behaviors (e.g., “goes back and forth between being warm and critical toward me”) (Olsen et al., 2002). Emotional manipulation tactics tend to reflect subtle, covert, and indirect ways that psychologically controlling parents communicate their needs (e.g., “You would not leave us and see your friends if you love us”) rather than directly discussing the matters (e.g., “I want to spend time with you”). These emotional manipulation tactics make children think less of themselves to force them to obey their parents (Choe et al., 2020b).\n\nBased on these prior definitions of PPC (Barber, 1996; Barber et al., 1994, 2012; Schaefer, 1965b; Soenens & Vansteenkiste, 2010), Choe and Read (2019) defined PPC as “a set of intrusive parenting techniques that emotionally manipulate children to obey parents” (Choe & Read, 2019, p.2858). This definition distills PPC into two core characteristics: intrusiveness and emotional manipulation (Choe et al., 2020b). In this paper, we adopt this definition emphasizing intrusiveness and emotional manipulation as two core facets of PPC. In simpler terms, both intrusiveness and emotional manipulation constitute PPC, as Figure 1 shows.\n\nDisrespect is closely associated with PPC, and conceptualizing intrusiveness and emotional manipulation as two core facets of PPC can explain the disrespect that children feel from psychologically controlling parents. Barber et al. (2012) characterized PPC as “disrespect of children’s individuality.” They asked adolescents which of their parents’ behaviors made them feel that their parents did not respect them as individuals and analyzed the qualitative data into eight categories: ridiculing, embarrassing in public, invalidating, violation of privacy, guilting, excessive expectations, comparing to others, and ignoring. As PPC crosses boundaries into the personal domain of children (intrusiveness), children may feel that they are perceived as incapable of deciding, thinking, or feeling on their own (Choe et al., 2020b). Moreover, being forced to obey parents because the parent-child bond is threatened (emotional manipulation) may assume hierarchy that psychologically controlling parents have power over children’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in the child’s personal domain. From the child’s perspective, being compelled to give up their autonomy to please their psychologically controlling parents or avoid losing parental affection can feel disrespectful (Choe & Read, 2019). Hence, intrusiveness and emotional manipulation as core facets of PPC can explain the disrespect that children feel when experiencing PPC.\n\nOur reconceptualization can also shed light on the distinction between behavioral control and PPC. Barber et al. (1994) distinguished PPC from behavioral control based on where the locus of parental control attempts to change: behavioral control if parents try to control children’s behavior (e.g., regulation, monitoring, supervision) and PPC if parents aim to control children’s psychological world (Barber, 1996). These terms and approaches based on the target of parental control were challenged later (Grolnick & Pomerantz, 2009). PPC aims to change behaviors of children as well as feelings and thoughts of children, and Grolnick and Pomerantz (2009) suggested referring to psychological control and other controlling parenting as “control” and behavioral control as “structure.” They defined structure as “parents’ organization of children’s environment to facilitate children’s competence” (Grolnick & Pomerantz, 2009, p. 167) via parents’ clear guidelines, consistent rules, explicit expectations, and perspicuous feedback on children’s actions. Based on our reconceptualization of PPC with intrusiveness and emotional manipulation as two core facets of PPC, if any type of parental control intrudes upon the child’s personal domain, that parental control would qualify as intrusive, regardless of what parents tried to change: behaviors, feelings, or thoughts of children. Hence, behavioral control or structure could be intrusive if the child believes the area that their parent intervened in (or structured) belongs to their personal domain. Moreover, the definitions of behavioral control or structure do not specify emotional manipulation as the method that parents adopt to regulate their children. On the other hand, PPC entails both intrusiveness and emotional manipulation in its definition, based on the historical conceptualization of PPC we summarized above. Therefore, intrusiveness and emotional manipulation as two core facets of PPC contribute to differentiating PPC from other types of parental control, including behavioral control or structure.\n\nAlthough empirical evidence on separate factor structures for intrusiveness and emotional manipulation will buttress intrusiveness and emotional manipulation as two core facets of PPC, the existing items measuring PPC do not permit a factor analysis of this sort. The items from the two most widely used PPC scales, the Psychological Control Scale – Youth Self-Report (Barber, 1996) and the Dependency-Oriented and Achievement-Oriented Psychological Control Scale (Soenens et al., 2010), typically measure intrusiveness and emotional manipulation within the very same items. To illustrate, we delineated intrusiveness and emotional manipulation measured by each item from the two scales in Table 1. For example, the item “(my father/mother) is less friendly with me, if I do not see things her (his) way” entails (1) intrusiveness, in that the parent intervenes in how the child sees things, and (2) emotional manipulation, in that the parent withdraws love by being less friendly with the child. Because separate items for intrusiveness and emotional manipulation hardly exist, factor analysis showing intrusiveness and emotional manipulation as two separate factors is not yet possible with the current items measuring PPC. Measuring the boundaries of the child’s personal domain (intrusiveness) and parental behaviors that pressure and/or instill anxiety in children to change their feelings, thoughts, and behaviors (emotional manipulation) separately will allow for such factor analyses. While empirical confirmation of our two-facet conceptualization of PPC awaits further measurement development, we theoretically treat both intrusiveness and emotional manipulation as core facets of PPC, based on the historical conceptualization of PPC that we summarized above.\n\nTable 1.\n\nScale .

Despite ample empirical evidence that PPC was associated with negative developmental child outcomes in interdependent cultures (e.g., Ahemaitijiang et al., 2020; Alpizar et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2021; Cordeiro et al., 2015; Díez et al., 2019; García Mendoza et al., 2019; Gargurevich & Soenens, 2016; Henry et al., 2018; Hsieh, 2020; Jang & Lee, 2020; Kline et al., 2016; Lau et al., 2022; León-del-Barco et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022b; Nunes et al., 2013; Pesigan et al., 2014; Plunkett et al., 2007; Rodríguez-Meirinhos et al., 2020; Shek et al., 2019; Sher-Censor et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2019; Torrente & Vazsonyi, 2008; Valdes et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2020), the relativistic argument has been repeated and perpetuated since its publication. Without conceptual and methodological explanations clarifying why one line of research obtained such relativistic results, whereas the others showed universally detrimental effects of PPC, the field does not have a synthesis. The lack of such conceptual and methodological explanations in the field can cause scholars to cite one or the other line of research and can confuse readers. Thus, the current status in the field makes providing such conceptual and methodological explanations for theoretical synthesis of the contradictory results an imperative task in the field. Many studies that have mentioned or recommended the relativistic argument heavily cited two seminal papers by Rudy and Halgunseth (2005) and Fung and Lau (2012). Hence, we first review the most cited articles that presented two key arguments that PPC might be less damaging and even beneficial to children’s development in interdependent cultures, with emphases on how they defined and operationalized PPC.\n\nRudy and Halgunseth (2005) compared 33 mothers of children aged from 7 to 12 years old from South Asia and the Middle East (described by the authors as more interdependent cultures) with 32 mothers from Canada, the UK, and Switzerland (described by the authors as more independent cultures) on mothers’ inducing guilt, mothers’ reports on children’s personality traits such as helpfulness and selfishness, mothers’ negative attribution of children’s misbehaviors (e.g., irresponsible), and children’s self-control and grades. They measured inducing guilt by administering three items from the Child Rearing Practices Report (Block, 1981) and reported inducing guilt as PPC. They reported that Canadian, British, and Swiss mothers’ self-reports of inducing guilt were significantly negatively correlated with mothers’ reports on children’s positive personality traits and significantly positively correlated with mothers’ negative attribution of children’s misbehaviors, whereas South Asian and Middle Eastern mothers’ self-reports of inducing guilt were not significantly correlated with either mothers’ reports on children’s positive personality traits or mothers’ negative attribution of children’s misbehaviors. Mothers’ inducing guilt was not significantly associated with child outcomes (i.e., children’s self-reports of self-esteem and children’s grades) in either group (Rudy & Halgunseth, 2005). They concluded that PPC – which they measured based on inducing guilt – did not necessarily reflect detrimental processes in interdependent cultures as it did in independent cultures.\n\nIn another study, Fung and Lau (2012) proposed two types of PPC: harsh psychological control and relational induction. They defined relational induction as a parenting practice in the Chinese culture that educates children by drawing attention to how children’s behaviors affect parents. The authors developed a new scale to measure relational induction, which includes inducing guilt, withdrawing love, and comparing the child with other children. In their study comparing European American parents (primarily mothers) with Hong Kong Chinese parents (mostly mothers) of mostly 7–10-year-old children, maternal relational induction was more strongly correlated with maternal rejection among European American parents than Hong Kong Chinese parents. Relational induction was correlated with parental rejection in both groups, but not associated with children’s externalizing behaviors and internalizing symptoms in either group (Fung & Lau, 2012). Based on their results, they argued that relational induction was a beneficial form of PPC in Chinese culture because it guided children’s behaviors using parent-child relationships.\n\nIn contrast, when these same researchers used scales measuring intrusiveness as well, they did not tend to find that PPC might be less damaging or even beneficial in interdependent cultures. When Rudy et al. (2008) measured PPC using the Psychological Control Scale – Youth Self-Report (Barber, 1996), the interaction term of culture (Chinese Canadian vs. European Canadian) and PPC did not significantly predict depression, anxiety, and self-esteem between the two groups (Rudy et al., 2008). Their results suggest that PPC predicted poor child adjustment equally across the interdependent and independent cultures. In addition, when Fung and Lau (2012) also measured PPC with the Psychological Control Scale – Youth Self-Report (Barber, 1996), they found a positive correlation with rejection in both European American parents and Hong Kong Chinese parents, which did not significantly differ in magnitude across ethnic groups (Fung & Lau, 2012). Rudy et al. (2014) also found different results between inducing guilt and PPC measured by the Psychological Control Scale – Youth Self-Report (Barber, 1996) when comparing Indian American and European American emerging adults in the USA. Specifically, PPC predicted low self-esteem in both groups, whereas inducing guilt was positively correlated with self-esteem only among Indian American emerging adults (Rudy et al., 2014). Based on these results, Rudy et al. (2014) argued that inducing guilt and PPC are not equivalent. Consistent with this, many later studies that measured intrusiveness as well as emotional manipulation via administering the Psychological Control Scale – Youth Self-Report (Barber, 1996) or the Dependency-Oriented and Achievement-Oriented Psychological Control Scale (Soenens et al., 2010) found significant correlations between PPC and poor adjustment of children in interdependent cultures, such as Asian cultures (e.g., Lau et al., 2022; Nelson et al., 2006; Safdar & Khan, 2019; Tian et al., 2019) and Latinx cultures (e.g., Gargurevich & Soenens, 2016; Hunter et al., 2015; Rodríguez-Meirinhos et al., 2020; Seay et al., 2016).\n\nThe argument that PPC might be less damaging and even beneficial in interdependent cultures is largely based on the premise that emotional manipulation equates to PPC. Rudy and Halgunseth’s (2005) operationalization of PPC was inducing guilt (a part of emotional manipulation), but not intrusiveness. Moreover, Fung and Lau (2012) framed some emotionally manipulative tactics, such as inducing guilt and withdrawing love, as relational induction and defined relational induction as part of PPC. This limited operational definition of PPC was used to conclude that PPC might be beneficial in Chinese culture because relational induction is beneficial, and the two seminal studies on the topic have been cited by other studies stating that PPC might be less damaging or even beneficial in interdependent cultures. Thus, a need to revisit the definition of PPC arises, to determine if PPC equates to emotional manipulation and subsequently elucidate whether PPC has different developmental consequences across cultures.\n\nWe present a possibility that operationalizing PPC as emotional manipulation might have contributed to discrepant findings and disagreements among scholars as to the meaning and consequence of PPC for child adjustment across cultures. Barber (1996) warned researchers about the importance of distinguishing PPC from induction: “Some confusion on this point can arise when psychological control is not carefully distinguished from other forms of psychologically oriented parental behavior such as induction” (Barber, 1996, p.3315). Induction describes “reasoning that draws children’s attention to the effects of their misdemeanors on others, thereby sensitizing them to events beyond the personal consequences of their actions” (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994, p.5). Instilling guilt in children’s minds and using the relationship between parents and children to discipline children (relational induction) themselves may not always equate with PPC based on the aforementioned conceptualization of PPC, which recognizes both intrusiveness and emotional manipulation as core facets of PPC (Barber, 1996; Barber et al., 1994; Choe et al., 2020b; Choe & Read, 2019; Soenens & Vansteenkiste, 2010).\n\nOne can examine if a behavior qualifies as PPC by checking both facets of PPC. Suppose a child hit another child, and a parent asked the child, “How would you feel if you were hit by your friend?” First, aggression warrants intervention; this parental behavior did not intrude upon this child’s personal domain. Hence, it is not intrusive. Second, guilt is a necessary emotion following morally wrong behavior (physical aggression in this case), as guilt discourages people from repeating the same offense (e.g., Tangney, 1994). As this parent’s behavior responds to the child’s moral transgression and encourages the child to think about others’ perspectives (i.e., perspective taking, Davis (1994), which is the cognitive part of empathy), this parent’s behavior can be considered as educating empathy rather than emotional manipulation. Even if this parent had said that, “it hurts my feelings that you hit another child,” which could be classified as relational induction (part of emotional manipulation) because the parent guided the child using their relationship with the child, this relational induction may not qualify as PPC, because it does not entail parental intrusiveness: parental intervention in the child’s personal domain (Smetana & Daddis, 2002).\n\nRelational induction may not always benefit children’s development either, undermining the argument that PPC might be less damaging or even beneficial in interdependent cultures because relational induction benefits children’s development. Whether relational induction benefits the child may depend on if the area that parents want to change falls into the children’s personal domain (intrusiveness). Suppose a parent told their child that “it hurts my feelings that you wouldn’t eat my food” at a potluck when the child instead ate food that others brought. If the child believes that which dishes to eat falls into their personal domain and had consumed healthy food regardless of who cooked the dishes that the child ate, there is not a need for this child to change their food choices except for pleasing their parent. Then, this parent has intruded upon their child’s autonomy within the child’s personal domain (intrusiveness). Thus, this parent’s behavior can qualify as both intrusiveness and emotional manipulation (e.g., relational induction), thus PPC, and yet may not benefit the child. Another example of both relational induction and PPC could be a parent telling their child that, “I am disappointed in you” for not speaking at a funeral of a family member. This parent’s remark uses the relationship between the parent and child to pressure the child to do what the parent wants the child to do; thus, it is relational induction. However, if the child believes that whether to speak at a funeral or not falls into the child’s personal domain (preference), then it may not warrant parental intervention (intrusiveness), thus qualifying as PPC. Hence, relational induction can guide children’s behavior if the target behavior warrants parental intervention (e.g., aggression), but non-intrusive relational induction may not meet the aforementioned conceptualization of PPC (Barber, 1996; Barber et al., 1994; Choe et al., 2020b; Choe & Read, 2019; Soenens & Vansteenkiste, 2010). Thus, identifying potential benefits of relational induction may not buttress the argument that PPC might be less damaging or even beneficial in interdependent cultures.\n\nMoreover, non-intrusive forms of relational induction may not always benefit children’s development either, which also undermines the argument that PPC might be less damaging or even beneficial in interdependent cultures because relational induction benefits children’s development. Barber (1996) suggested that withdrawing love – part of induction – might function differently from the other forms of induction, which have “been shown to enhance psychological and social development. The one area that could be construed as controversial in this regard is love withdrawal” (Barber, 1996, p.3315). Withholding love has been considered one tactic of PPC and describes parents’ withholding or withdrawing of love, attention, and affection from their children until children engage in the behaviors that parents deem desirable. A similar construct – parental conditional regard – refers to parents providing love and affection when children display particular behaviors or attributes and parents withholding love and affection when children do not (Assor et al., 2004). Previous research has consistently documented the negative effects of parental conditional regard on child outcomes (e.g., Assor et al., 2014). Even though the child’s behavior that prompted parents to withdraw love or attention from their children needed parental intervention (thus, it is not considered intrusive), losing affection from their parents for a behavior can send the message to the children that only their good behaviors earn parents’ affection; thus, their core self is inherently unlovable (Choe et al., 2020a). Ergo withdrawing love can still impair children’s development, regardless of whether it is intrusive, based on both Attachment Theory (Ainsworth, 1969; Bowlby, 1969) and Self-Determination Theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000)’s assertions that feeling connected to one’s parents and having a secure bond with one’s parents are essential to children’s development and survival. Thus, relational induction – especially withdrawing love – may not always promote children’s positive development, even if it is not intrusive, subverting the argument that PPC might be less damaging or even beneficial in interdependent cultures.\n\nTherefore, the argument that PPC might be less damaging and even beneficial in interdependent cultures compared to independent cultures might originate from defining and operationalizing PPC in terms of inducing guilt or relational induction, which include only one facet of PPC (emotional manipulation). Relational induction may differ from PPC when that relational induction is not intrusive; thus, the benefits of relational induction may not equate to advantages of PPC. Moreover, non-intrusive emotional manipulation, such as relational induction, may not always benefit children’s development either, especially withdrawing love. Thus, whether PPC is less damaging or even beneficial in interdependent or not compared to independent cultures remains unanswered and needs more examination. In this sense, viewing intrusiveness and emotional manipulation as the two core facets of PPC can clarify the conceptualization of PPC and also the associated inconsistent findings across cultures."
