        "text": "Information on the processing of personal data\n\nThe collection of personal data required for all visa applications, including photographs and fingerprints, is compulsory for the examination of a visa application. Failure to provide this information will result in the application being declared inadmissible.\n\nThe responsible authorities\n\nMinistère des Affaires étrangères et européennes,\n\nde la Défense, de la Coopération et du Commerce extérieur\n\nBureau des Passeports, Visas et Légalisations\n\n6 Rue de l’Ancien Athenée\n\nL-1144 Luxembourg\n\nservice.visas@mae.etat.lu\n\nData protection officer: dataprotection.mae@mae.etat.lu\n\nThe legal basis\n\nThe legal basis for the collection and the processing of personal data is set out in Regulation (EC) 767/2008 (VIS Regulation), Regulation (EU) 2019/1155 amending Regulation (EC) 810/2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code) and Council Decision 2008/633/JHA.\n\nThe processing of personal data\n\nThe data will be shared with the competent authorities of the Schengen Member States [1] and processed by these authorities for the purposes of decision-making on a visa application.\n\nData and information relating to the decision taken on an application, whether to annul, revoke or extend an existing visa, will be entered and stored in the Visa Information System (VIS) for a maximum period of five years, during the course of which they will be accessible to the visa authorities and to the authorities responsible for carrying out visa checks at the external borders and within the Member States, to immigration and asylum authorities in the Member States, in order to check whether the conditions for entry, stay and legal residence on the territory of the Member States are fulfilled, to identify persons who do not meet or no longer meet these conditions, to examine an asylum application and to determine responsibility for this examination.\n\nUnder certain conditions, the data will also be made available to the designated authorities of the Member States and to Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences.\n\nThird countries and international organisations\n\nPersonal data may also be transferred to third countries or international organizations in order to verify the identity of third-country nationals, including for return purposes. Such transfers only take place under certain conditions [2].

The main objectives of the VIS are to facilitate visa application procedures and external border controls, and to enhance the security of the Schengen area.\n\nThe aim of the global VIS introduction process is to provide applicants with greater protection against identity theft, and to prevent document fraud and the practice of \"visa shopping\". Fingerprints are widely used in the EU as one of the most secure means of identification. The use of biometric data to identify a visa holder is a faster and more precise way of identifying a visa holder by the border police.\n\nThe VIS incorporates a central database, a national interface in each Schengen state, and a communication infrastructure between the central database and the national interface. The VIS is linked to the national visa systems of all the Schengen States via the national interfaces, enabling the competent authorities in the Schengen States to process data on visa applications and on visas either issued, refused, annulled, revoked or extended.\n\nThe VIS consists of two systems: the VIS database, which conducts alphanumeric searches, and the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), which compares fingerprints received with the database and returns a positive or negative response, including any matches.\n\nThe main central VIS is located in Strasbourg (France) and a back-up central VIS, capable of providing all the functions of the main central VIS, is located in Sankt Johann in Pongau (Austria).\n\nThe VIS is continually processing information gathered by the consulates of the Schengen states. For instance, information entered locally by visa authorities can be available in the VIS in a matter of minutes. The VIS offers rapid verification services for visa holders at border crossings, taking just a few seconds to conduct a visa check.\n\nThe Commission was responsible for developing the central database, the national interfaces and the communication infrastructure between the central VIS and the national interfaces. Individual Schengen States are responsible for the development, management and operation of their respective national systems.\n\nThe EU Agency for large-scale IT systems, eu-LISA, is responsible for the operational management of VIS.\n\nWhat is the legal basis for the VIS?\n\nThe main acts constituting the legal framework of the VIS are the following:\n\n· Council Decision 2004/512/EC of 8 June 2004 establishing the Visa Information System (VIS), OJUE L 213, 15.6.2004, p. 5.\n\n· Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning the VIS and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation), OJUE L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 60.\n\n· Council Decision 2008/633/JHA of 23 June 2008 concerning access for consultation of the VIS by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offence, OJUE L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 129.\n\n· Regulation (EC) No 81/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 January 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 as regards the use of the Visa Information System (VIS) under the Schengen Borders Code, OJUE L 35, 4.2.2009, p. 56.\n\n· Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code), OJUE L 243, 5.9.2009, p. 1.\n\nWhat are the consequences of VIS in practice for visa applicants?\n\nFirst-time visa applicants must always present themselves in person when submitting their application to provide their photograph and fingerprints.\n\nThe photograph is currently scanned from an existing paper photograph. At a later stage, the photograph will be taken digitally at the moment of the application.\n\nFor all new subsequent applications submitted within a period of 59 months, the fingerprints can be copied into the VIS from the previous application file.\n\nNevertheless, it should be stressed that in the event of reasonable doubt as to the applicant's identity, the consulate will collect fingerprints again within the 59 months referred to above. Moreover, the applicant may ask for fingerprints to be taken if, at the time the application is submitted, it is not immediately possible to confirm that the fingerprints were taken within the aforementioned period.\n\nThe biometric data of visa applicants may be collected by Schengen State consulates and external service providers (such as VFS, TLS and others), but not by commercial intermediaries (e.g. travel agencies).\n\nUpon arrival at the Schengen external border, visa holders must provide their fingerprints for comparison with those registered in the VIS, at the request of the Schengen States' border control authorities. Searches in the VIS by Schengen border guards are based on the visa sticker number in combination with fingerprints.\n\nVisa holders whose fingerprints have not been taken at the time of application, on the grounds that they have been exempted from this requirement, will not be asked to provide fingerprints at the border.\n\nWhat happens to those who refuse to provide fingerprints for various reasons?\n\nAs a result, a Schengen visa will not be issued if biometric data is not provided. However, in accordance with Article 13(7) of the Visa Code, there are several categories of citizens who are not required to provide this data, as indicated in the FAQ under Question 18.\n\nIf I already have a biometric passport, do I also need to submit my fingerprints?\n\nYes, holders of biometric passports must also appear in person when applying for a short-stay Schengen visa for the first time to submit their fingerprints.\n\nHow is my biometric data protected in the VIS?\n\nStrict data protection rules are defined in the VIS regulation and are subject to control by national and European data protection authorities.\n\nData is kept in the VIS for a maximum of five years from the visa expiry date, if a visa has been issued, or from the new visa expiry date, if a visa has been extended, or from the date on which a refusal decision is issued by the visa authorities.\n\nAll individuals have the right to obtain communication of the data recorded in the VIS concerning them from the Schengen State which entered the data in the system. Individuals may also request that inaccurate data concerning them be rectified, and that illegally recorded data be deleted.\n\nIn each Schengen State, the national supervisory authorities independently monitor the processing of personal data recorded in the VIS by the respective Schengen State.\n\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor monitors the data processing activities of the VIS Management Authority.\n\nWhich data are registered in the VIS?\n\nThe visa authorities in each Schengen state register data relating to short-stay visa applications (i.e. applications to stay in the Schengen area for 90 days or less) in the VIS. Data relating to national long-stay visas are not yet recorded in the VIS.\n\nUpon reception of an application, the visa authorities of the relevant Schengen State create an application file in VIS and record the alphanumeric data contained in the Schengen visa application form, the applicant's digital photograph and the ten fingerprints collected.\n\nIf the applicant is traveling in a group, the travelers' application files will be linked in the VIS. If a previous application has been registered for the same applicant, the two applications will also be linked in the VIS.\n\nOnce a decision has been taken on the application (visa granted/refused) or post-decision (annulment, revocation, extension), the information is recorded in the VIS by the visa authorities of the relevant Schengen States. Once the visa has been issued and all applicant data - including fingerprints - have been recorded in the VIS, a code is inserted in the visa sticker.\n\nWhich authorities have access to the VIS?\n\nThe visa authorities of the Schengen States have access to the VIS for both data recording and consultation. Application and decision data are entered into the VIS by the visa authorities of the Schengen State responsible for examining the application or taking the decision. The data entered by one Schengen State can then be consulted by the visa authorities of all the other Schengen States, for example when examining another application from the same applicant.\n\nOther authorities from the Schengen States have access to the VIS for consultation only.\n\nNational border authorities have access to the VIS in order to verify the identity of the visa holder, the authenticity of the visa and whether the conditions for entry into the territory of the Schengen states have been fulfilled. VIS checks at the Schengen area's external borders, with systematic fingerprint verification, are compulsory, except in a limited number of cases.\n\nThe national authorities responsible for carrying out identity checks on the territory of the Schengen states have access to the VIS in order to verify the identity of the visa holder, the authenticity of the visa and whether the conditions for entry, stay or residence on the territory of the Schengen states have been fulfilled.\n\nNational asylum authorities have access to the VIS to determine the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 and for processing the application.\n\nEuropol has access to the VIS for consultation purposes as part of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences.\n\nNational law enforcement authorities have access to VIS data for the same purposes, provided certain legal conditions are respected: access to VIS data must be necessary in a particular case, and there must be reasonable grounds for considering that consultation of the data will make a substantial contribution to the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorism and other serious crimes.\n\nAs a general rule, VIS data may not be transferred or made available to a third country or international organization. By way of derogation, certain data recorded in the VIS (name, nationality, travel document number, residence) may be communicated to a third country or international organization when a specific case requires it to prove the identity of a third-country national, including for return purposes.\n\nCITIZENS’ RIGHTS IN THE FIELD OF THE SCHENGEN INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\n1. General presentation of the Schengen Information System\n\nThe Schengen Information System (SIS) was implemented as a search system for persons and objects by the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 19 June 1990. The SIS was designed as a compensatory measure to the lifting of internal border controls with the aim of ensuring a high level of security in the European Union’s area of freedom, security and justice.\n\nThe system includes alerts\n\ni. On persons, namely :\n\nThird-country nationals subject to a return decision,\n\nThird-country nationals subject to a refusal of entry and stay,\n\nPersons wanted for arrest for surrender or extradition purposes,\n\nMissing persons, including :\n\nChildren at risk of abduction by a parent, a family member or a guardian, o Vulnerable persons who need to be prevented from travelling,\n\nPersons sought to assist with a judicial procedure,\n\nPersons for discreet, inquiry or specific checks,\n\nUnknown wanted persons for the purpose of identification under national law.\n\nii. On objects:\n\nFor discreet, inquiry or specific checks,\n\nFor seizure or use as evidence in criminal proceedings.\n\n2. Legal framework applicable to SIS as well as to data protection\n\nThe SIS is established by the following legal instruments:\n\n- Regulation (EU) 2018/1860 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 28 November 2018 on the use of the Schengen Information System for the return of illegally staying thirdcountry nationals,\n\n- Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 November 2018 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of border checks, and amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, and amending and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006,\n\n- Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 November 2018 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, amending and repealing Council Decision 2007/533/JHA, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1986/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Decision 2010/261/EU.\n\nThe following legal instruments are applicable in terms of data protection:\n\n- Loi du 1er août 2018 relative à la protection des personnes physiques à l'égard du traitement des données à caractère personnel en matière pénale ainsi qu’en matière de sécurité nationale (Law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data in criminal and national security matters, transposing into national law the Directive 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA) (hereafter « LPD »),\n\n- Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, hereafter « GDPR »)\n\n- Loi du 1er août 2018 portant organisation de la Commission nationale pour la protection des données et du régime général sur la protection des données » (Law of 1 August 2018 on the organisation of the National Data Protection Commission and the general data protection framework).\n\n3. Information to be made available to the individual on data processing in the SIS\n\ni. The data controller\n\nIn Luxembourg, the data controller for the data processing in the context of the SIS is the Grand Ducal Police, represented by its General Director.\n\nii. The purposes of the processing\n\nThe purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended are the following:\n\nPrevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security,\n\nExternal border control,\n\nImmigration control.\n\niii. The categories of personal data that may be processed\n\nThe personal data that may be included in a SIS alert are listed in article 20 of Regulation 2018/1861 and of Regulation 2018/1862 as well as in article 4 of Regulation 2018/1860.\n\niv. The recipients or categories of recipients\n\nNational competent authorities of the Schengen Member States that can access the SIS and are thus to be considered as recipients are listed in article 34 of Regulation 2018/1861 and articles 44 to 47 of Regulation 2018/1862. In addition to these national competent authorities, SIS can also be accessed by Europol, Frontex and Eurojust in accordance with articles 35 and 36 of Regulation 2018/1861 and articles 48 to 50 of Regulation 2018/1862.\n\nv. The storage period\n\nAlerts on persons and on objects shall be kept only for the time required to achieve the purposes for which they were entered.\n\nThe above-mentioned regulations foresee several time limits for a periodic review of the need for the storage of personal data with the possibility to renew the alerts.\n\nAlerts on persons subject to a discrete, inquiry or specific check as well as certain categories of missing persons have in principle to be re-examined at the latest after one year.\n\nAlerts on persons subject to a return decision, subject to a refusal of entry and stay, sought to assist with a judicial procedure as well as unknown wanted persons for the purpose of identification have in principle to be re-examined at the latest after three years.\n\nAlerts on persons wanted for arrest for surrender or extradition purposes as well as certain categories of missing persons are in principle to be re-examined at the latest after five years.\n\nAlerts on objects are in principle to be re-examined at the latest after ten years.\n\nvi. The rights of individuals\n\nConcerning the right for information provided under articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, respectively article 12 of the LPD, the Grand-Ducal Police refers to the information on its website under the heading « Data protection » (Link https://police.public.lu/fr/support/protection-des-donnees-a-caractere-personnel.html).\n\nAs foreseen in article 53 of Regulation 2018/1861 and article 67 of Regulation 2018/1862, individuals have the right to introduce\n\n- A request for access to their data,\n\n- A request for correction of inaccurate data,\n\n- A request for deletion of unlawfully stored data,\n\nIn accordance with articles 15, 16 and 17 of the GDPR and 13 and 15 of the LPD.\n\nThese requests may be submitted to any Member State of the European Union operating the system and any of the four Schengen Associated States (Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Island). The receiving Member State will process the request according to their own national procedures in place as well as according to the European rules in force.\n\nWith regard to deadlines for processing such requests, it should be noted that both the requests for access and the requests for rectification and deletion must be answered within 1 month (article 53(4) of the Regulation 2018/1861 and article 67(4) of the Regulation 2018/1862, both referring to article 12(3) of the GDPR).\n\nRegarding the form, Member States will have to strive to respect both the form (letter or email) of the requestor as well as the language used by them, this of course as far as possible. In general, the Grand Ducal Police processes access requests as well as correction or deletion requests if they are introduced in any of the administrative languages of the country (Luxembourgish, French, German) or in English.\n\nIn accordance with article 12(6) of the GDPR and article 11, paragraph 5 of the LPD, the Grand-Ducal Police must have sufficient guarantees to establish with certainty the identity of the person requesting information, so as not to prejudice the rights of others. The following documents have therefore to be enclosed to the requests:\n\nFor a request from an individual:\n\n- A signed letter,\n\n- A copy of an identity document (identity card or passport).\n\nFor a request from an individual on behalf of another individual:\n\n- A power of attorney duly signed by both parties,\n\n- A letter signed by the represented party,\n\n- A copy of an identity document of represented party (identity card or passport),\n\n- A copy of an identity document of the representing party (identity card or passport).\n\nFor a request from an attorney:\n\n- A power of attorney duly signed by the client and the attorney,\n\n- A copy of an identity document of the client (identity card or passport),\n\n- A copy of an identity document of the attorney (identity card or passport),\n\n- A copy of an attorney card or equivalent.\n\nIt goes without saying that the transmission of a copy of an identity card or passport via the Internet may present a certain risk in the event of possible abuse by a third party (for example, interception).\n\nFinally, in exceptional circumstances and in accordance with article 53(3) of the Regulation 2018/1861, article 67(3) of the Regulation 2018/1862, and articles 14 and 15, paragraph 4 of the LPD, a Member State may take a decision not to provide information to the data subject, in whole or in part, in order to safeguard national security, defence and public security, or for the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, for as long as such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society with due regard for the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of the data subject concerned.\n\nvii. Right to lodge a complaint or to seek judicial remedy\n\nIn case the reply which is provided by the Grand Ducal Police does not satisfy the requestor, the latter has the right to file a complaint with the national supervisory authority, namely the « Commission nationale pour la protection des données », in accordance with article 77 of the GDPR, respectively in accordance with article 44 of the LPD. The national supervisory authority may be contacted under the following contact details:\n\nCommission nationale pour la protection des données (CNPD)\n\nService des réclamations\n\n15, Boulevard du Jazz\n\nL-4370 Belvaux\n\nLuxembourg.\n\nFurthermore, the requestor also has the right to seek judicial remedy within three months after the receipt of the final reply at the Administrative Court of Luxembourg (Tribunal administratif) with the assistance of an attorney."
