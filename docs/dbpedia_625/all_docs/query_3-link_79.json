        "text": "Policy Research, Research and Evaluation Branch\n\nNalinie Mooten, Ph.D.\n\nJuly 2021\n\nProject reference number: R8-2020\n\nExecutive summary\n\nCanada is celebrated as a diverse, multicultural and inclusive nation, with many accolades to its name, and remains a destination of choice for many immigrants worldwide. It is described, similar to Australia and New Zealand, as a “settlement country,” where settlement is an integral part of nation building and immigration an intrinsic component of the national heritage (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015).Footnote 1 In short, despite some challenges, Canada is lauded as a successful immigrant nation, and perceived, in terms of its skilled migration system, as a “benchmark for other countries,” as supported by its strong integration outcomes (OECD, 2019). While the literature points to “cracks” in the Canadian immigration model, including “skilled” migration, overall it is widely considered as a model to be emulated by other Western industrialized nations – a phenomenon otherwise known as Canadian “exceptionalism” in the context of multiculturalism and immigration policymaking (Triadafilopoulos, 2021).Footnote 2\n\nWhen it comes to examining racism and discrimination within the Canadian immigration system as a whole, authors point to certain areas that need particular attention, one of which centers, as per the focus of this paper, on temporary migration.Footnote 3 Indeed, on the subject of migrant workers, the literature is somewhat more tentative as to Canada’s successes. Accordingly, authors raise concerns that there are “two Canadas,” one of which is constituted by fault lines within temporary migration and defined by “zones of exceptionalism” characterized by substandard labour and social protections as well as restrictions on workers’ mobility.Footnote 4 For the majority of authors, “race,” “class,” “gender,” or “geography” (that is, country of origin), but also “skill level” and “entry class” combine with wider historical, and current structures of discrimination to shape the experiences of migrant workers and their migration experience today.\n\nThe primary objective of this review is to identify and analyze potential markers of racism and discrimination in immigration policy that impact migrant workers in Canada, most specifically those in the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program and the Caregiver Streams that are part of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program. The review also examines the International Mobility Program, albeit from a more limited perspective, due to a still nascent, yet fast-growing, literature on the subject.Footnote 5 Overall, studies and reports mostly focus on substandard conditions of labour, lack of access, or restricted access, to social services and permanent residence pathways that are typically available to workers from higher-waged and higher-skilled categories. Indeed, most of the literature, including reports from non-profit organizations, and parliamentary committees refer to issues of “abuse and exploitation” in temporary migration programs, including in specific segments of the International Mobility Program.\n\nWhile on the surface, it may appear that these references are dissociated from the terminologies and practices of racism and discrimination, they are in fact often articulated in the context of the historical racist genesis of the programs, and also to processes of racialization that may be drawn from systemic racism and discriminatory practices. Indeed, there is meaningful literature on the historical formation of temporary programs in Canada, and its relationship to racism and discrimination as constituted through gender, geography, and class. Most scholars suggest that these historical formations are key to understanding the situation facing migrant workers in Canada today as they continue to inform the shape and contents of policy. This is sometimes referred to as history’s “ongoing effects” or “lasting impacts.”Footnote 6 In this light, the federal government recognizes that historical practices continue to drive processes of stigma and discrimination for racialized peoples (Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), 2020). In the case of migrants, for example, some scholars have drawn connections between systems of indentureship – described as a discriminatory practice – and temporary migration programs. Others point out that the seasonality of the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program stems from the racist assumption that racialized peoples cannot adjust to the Canadian climate, nor “assimilate” to Canada due to their inherent nature, as another example.\n\nIn addition to the above considerations, scholars argue that it is key to be cognizant of the factors surrounding the global movement of migrantsFootnote 7 from the (mostly poorer) global South to the (mostly richer) nations of the global North,Footnote 8 which is marked by migrants remitting to countries of origin; their separation from families; and isolation in their communities in Canada due to long hours of work; live-in arrangements (living with, or in close proximity to, employers), as well as language based, and other, barriers in accessing social benefits, labour protection information and compensation, legal aid, and settlement services. Relatedly, the literature refers to the “race”-based and gender-based barriers experienced by migrant workers. Authors point out that these unequal global realities may be replicated within nations, but also within households, for caregivers who still “live-in.”\n\nAs noted, evidence of exploitative practices abounds within these programs, whether for migrant agricultural workers or caregivers. Caregivers, for example, experience downward social mobility in Canada, tied to the absence of the recognition of their foreign credential experience, but also barriers which prevent further study and/or employment choices. In this context, authors depict racism as a structural barrier and the “gendered, racialized, and classed immigration system” that feed into the downward mobility of female care workers (Lightman et al, 2021). There is also a gendered toll on caregiver mothers whose experiences – not unlike those of migrant mothers in temporary agricultural programs – illustrate the importance of examining these issues with an “intersectional” lens.\n\nThe questions underpinning this study, as related to immigration policy, include: What are the commonly accepted definitions of racism and discrimination? What is the historical backdrop that informs Canada’s temporary migrant programs? What do we know about racism, discrimination and migrant workers? What kind of challenges are encountered by migrant workers on the grounds of “race,” class, gender and other identity factors? The intent of this paper is not to arrive at a fixed conclusion as to whether racism and discrimination exist within these programs, but rather to raise awareness of the debates within the literature and among experts. Having said this, there is a wide consensus in the literature that questions of “race,” “gender,” “class,” “geography” are inevitable factors that impact policies regarding migrant workers whether in the Temporary Foreign Worker Program or the International Mobility Program.\n\nThere is also a wide consensus that, in the case of the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program and the Caregiver Streams, their unequivocal rootedness in racism and discrimination inform the current nomenclature of immigration policies. In other words, though racism may no longer sustain or substantiate these programs, they may not be free of racism, due to the fact that they arose from racism. Some scholars point out that racism and discrimination are an intrinsic part of the matrix that make up these programs, depicting it as “institutional racism.” Others note that the rootedness of racism within these programs cannot be ignored, and that though explicit racist ideas may no longer sustain them, they may still have a discriminatory impact that prevents the full “humanization” of racialized migrants.\n\nMost authors, and organizations such as the Ontario Human Rights Commission, explain that discriminatory impact is to be assessed by the disproportional outcomes experienced by a social group, in this case, migrant workers. Are they mostly racialized? Do they mostly originate from the global South? Do they experience differential treatment with adverse and disproportionate effects on their health, participation in their communities, places of work and broader experiences? Are their contributions to the Canadian economy and society proportionally recognized? Depending on how one answers these questions, a thoughtful pause on how Canada addresses potential discrimination in temporary migration, may well be warranted.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nMichael Farrell has been the driving force behind the creation and implementation of this project. I cannot thank him enough for all the qualities of precision, acuteness and kindness, and his infinite patience, which was instrumental in bringing this research piece to fruition. Mike has gone through various iterations of this paper, edited it, and made so many insightful comments on how to best equip the reader, and the text, with an anti-racism lens as it applies to policies and programs impacting migrant workers’ lives, work, and broader experiences in Canada. Mike places research in its multi-dimensionality, and this richness of approach strengthens the anti-racism lens and the subtleties and nuances that describe it. Many hours were spent on reading drafts with exceptional detailed attention and always with so much composure, humility and humour.\n\nThis project could also not have come to fruition without the support of Leanne Dixon-Perera. Leanne has provided comments and precision related to the intricacies of temporary migrant worker programs.

Its primary objective is to identify potential markers of racism and discrimination in immigration programming and policymaking that impact migrant workers in Canada, most specifically participants in the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP), the caregiver streams and the International Mobility Program (IMP).Footnote 10 Accordingly, its overall purpose is to present and analyze the findings of the literature on migrant workers, racism and discrimination, in order to support the work of IRCC’s Anti-Racism Task Force, particularly as it relates to reviewing racism in IRCC policies and programs. The paper is not a “literature review” in the strict sense; however, it strives to provide an accurate summary, and analysis, of the findings and evidence within much of the literature on migrant workers.Footnote 11 It was important to equip the text with quotes in order to illustrate the specific phrasing used in the wider literature given the nature of the subject-matter under study.\n\nIn terms of the structure of this paper, racism and discrimination are explored in Section 1, but readers who are already familiar with these concepts may wish to begin with Section 2 as they may find the explanations in Section 1 redundant. Section 2 explores racism and discrimination in Canadian immigration history, and the last section focuses on migrant workers, also within the lens of racism and discrimination. It bears mentioning that retracing the continuum of racism in the history of immigration policies provides the tools for grasping present-day biases, and the legacies of racism, that may underpin current immigration policies and programs, including those related to migrant workers in Canada. The review concludes with a summary of key messages embedded in the wider literature.\n\nIn alignment with the above purpose, the paper grounds current perspectives, and subsequent findings, on longstanding and established peer-reviewed research, as well as recent findings by academics, including social scientists, governments and non-governmental organizations, provincial human rights commissions, parliamentary committees, journalistic sources and other stakeholders. Accordingly, it uncovers key debates, while being consistent with the literature’s findings as a whole. Much of the literature suggests that this approach is a reasonable one, although there may be other ways of approaching this review. Indeed, this work neither seeks to be an endpoint, nor does it intend to provide any proposed way forward.\n\nIn order to examine racism and discrimination as they relate to migrant workers, it is important to provide a description of both racism and discrimination in order for the reader to have clarity about the findings in this paper. The aim of this approach is not to unpack the debates and the current consensus on definitions of racism and discrimination merely for the purpose of debating these issues – as crucial as this is – but rather, to establish a framework to explore how the literature approaches racism and discrimination as related to migrants, historically and today. In light of these considerations, all the complexities and breadth of racism and “race” cannot be fully addressed by this review.\n\nIt is important to note that while specific aspects of racism have been clearly defined in much of the literature on “race”Footnote 12 (see for instance, scientific racism, stereotypes and other concepts described in Section 1), the debates on racism are ever-evolving. Therefore, society’s understanding of what constitutes racism will, in all likelihood, continue to evolve.\n\nIt has been, however, clearly established that racism is composed of certain descriptions that are now widely acceptedFootnote 13 at the same time as consultations, data collection, research and analysis unfold. Accordingly, racism in Canada is a social phenomenon that adversely impacts diverse populations: it is a lived reality for Indigenous, as well as Black and other racialized peoples,Footnote 14 as acknowledged by the federal government, Canadian courts, Canadian historians, as well as social scientists.\n\nThe Government of Canada has an ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and working towards the elimination of racism and discrimination.\n\nCanadian Heritage.\n\nIt is important to add that while this review refers to Indigenous peoples (that is, First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples as defined in section 35 of the Canadian Constitution of 1982) in certain instances, its scope does not allow for a detailed description of the unique characteristics and experiences of this population, particularly as related to the historical intersection of immigration and Indigenous policy in Canada.\n\nAlthough some of the impacts of the pandemic are mentioned, this report does not cover the theme of COVID-19 and migrant workers with a depth of analysis due to time, scoping, and other constraints.Footnote 15 The amount of literature on this topic is likely to grow in light of the pandemic’s significance for immigration policy, with its particular relevance to migrant workers.\n\nIn addition, the author is cognizant that by focusing on racism, with references to gender, class, migrant status, and geography, there is an inherent lack of focus on other grounds that can be the basis of discrimination, such as age, religion, ability status, sexual orientation, and others. The intent is not to undervalue the importance of these other grounds, as the literature certainly contains examples of discrimination on the basis of these grounds in IRCC’s policies and programs. However, in order to keep the scope of this work within the time constraints of the project framework, it is directed specifically at racism, with explicit acknowledgement that the characteristics of intersectionality will enrich the analysis and provide some indications of the issues that arise from discrimination based on a broad set of grounds.\n\nMethodology\n\nGender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+)\n\nIRCC (2021b) explains, “GBA+ is an analytical tool that enables public servants to achieve the best possible outcomes for clients: Canadians, permanent residents (including refugees), temporary residents, prospective clients (people interested in coming to Canada) and our IRCC colleagues”.\n\nThis review adopts a Gender-Based Analysis Plus approach. IRCC (2019) explains that a GBA+ analysis:\n\nIs an evidence-based process to assess the impact of policies, programs, legislation, and service delivery on diverse groups of women, men, girls and boys;\n\nIs an analytical tool for gender equality that recognizes that equal opportunity does not necessarily mean equal results; and\n\nEnsures that the intersections between gender and other diversity factors are considered, including ethnicity, religion, nationality, class, age and sexuality.\n\nIRCC (2021b) acknowledges that the importance of the “plus” in GBA+ is indeed not solely about gender. The “multiple identity factors” that intersect include (see more in Section 1 on intersectionality):\n\nage\n\nrace\n\ngender\n\nlevels of education\n\nreligion\n\nsocio-economic status\n\nmental or physical disability\n\nethnicity\n\ngender identity\n\nsexual orientation\n\nThe review focuses on “race” and “gender,” but also refers to other identity factors. For instance, “gender” may be more of a consideration for caregivers, who are disproportionately women. Of note, scholars also consider “migration status” and “geography” to be two of the identity factors that differentially impact migrants’ lives, migration experiences and integration outcomes (Spitzer, 2006). Similarly, “levels of education” and “social-economic status,” as identified by IRCC, and also “skill level,” constitute factors that may also impact the experiences of migrant workers in Canada, in relation to their migration process and potential discriminatory practices (see Section 3). GBA+ is central to the federal government’s endeavours to redress inequalities and to place gender and other diversity factors into its policies and programs.\n\nSearch Strategy\n\nPertinent academic sources, that is, peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters and books were obtained from online databases. Searches were conducted in the following databases: The R&E digital library, JSTOR, Social Science Research Network, The Sage Political Science Abstracts, Google, Google Scholar, and the MigrantWorkersRights online database, which contains a multiplicity of peer-reviewed academic and non-academic sources on migrant workers, specifically. Key articles located throughout the searches provided additional relevant references. In addition, the researcher attended, and used recorded, online symposiums, conferences and presentations on the subject-matter while preparing this report. Presentations included the IB-SST led Expert Series.\n\nThe Library of Parliament provided a key publication on migrant workers, and the main characteristics of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), and reports from Standing Committees also provided data for this review. In addition, government publications, and other data, were obtained via government websites (such as Canadian Heritage, Department of Justice, IRCC, Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and/or Statistics Canada) and organizations such as the OHRC, the Migration Policy Institute, the Wellesley Institute, the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, and the Canadian Council for Refugees, among others.\n\nApproximately 160 peer-reviewed articles, books and book chapters were reviewed, or cited, in addition to about 20 NGO and non-profit organization publications, as well as approximately 15 journalistic sources. Some of the keywords that guided this review included: “race,” “racism,” “discrimination,” “migrant workers,” “temporary foreign workers,” “discriminatory immigration history,” “racism in immigration policies,” “SAWP,” “Live-in caregivers,” “IMP” and “Canada.”\n\nEvidence collection methodologies rested primarily on sources such as peer-reviewed academic articles; books; documentaries; reports by federal departments and agencies, parliamentary committees and the not-for-profit sector; experts’ presentations and interviews; government officials’ statements; journalistic reports, which provided the foundational material for the analysis of contents. Sources, therefore, included both academic text as well as, more broadly, “grey literature.” Quantitative data, as related to the demographic characteristics of migrant workers, were located in government and non-governmental publications, including IRCC’s, peer-reviewed articles or presentation of research findings by experts, and referenced whenever applicable to the contents of the report.\n\nSection 1: Racism and discrimination\n\nPart 1: Racism\n\nHistory of racism or scientific (biological) racism\n\nScientific, or biological, racism is an ideology that has been crucial in shaping current debates and understanding of “race.” With its roots in Enlightenment thought, scientific racism supports the belief that there is a hierarchy of “races” with one “race” being superior to others, and that “races” are fundamentally different.Footnote 16 Accordingly, scientific racism lends credence to the belief that racial classifications and differences are biologically real, and it is predicated on the tenet of the inherent inferiority and superiority of specific “races” (Miles, 1982; Li, 2001).Footnote 17 Racial differences, such as skin colour, stature, eye shape or head shape, were arbitrarily chosen to justify racial classification resulting in a hierarchy of human value based on race (Backhouse, 1999; Bolaria and Li, 1988; Fleras, 2017; Nestel, 2012; Satzewich, 2011). In the same vein, Clair and Denis (2015, 857) pinpoint, “Bundled up with eighteenth century classifications of various racial groups were assertions of moral, intellectual, spiritual, and other forms of superiority.”Footnote 18\n\nWhile much of the literature on this subject points to a degree of divergence of viewpoints as to the causes of racism, it nonetheless posits that such notions have had real and devastating impacts (Fleras, 2017, 39-41; Henry, 2004; Nestel, 2012). Scientific racism is believed to have culminated in, as worded by Henry (2004), “discriminatory practices.” Racial classifications, scholars explain, provided the ideological rationale justifying slavery, the seizure of First Nations’ lands, the treatment of Asian immigrants to Canada in the 19th century, and the Holocaust (Aiken, 2007; Arat-Koc, 1997; Clair and Denis, 2015; Goldberg, 2002; Joppke, 2012; Nestel, 2012; Spoonley, 2019; Thobani, 2007). Particularly relevant for this review, Bolari and Li (1988, 7) suggest that racial classifications justified the association of specific “races” with free or cheap labour, and in so doing, sanctioned labour systems such as slavery and indentureship (also known as indentured labour).Footnote 19 According to the federal government, these are not solely regrettable historical events with no links to our current context. For instance, PHAC (2020) recognizes that these historical practices continue to drive processes of stigma and discrimination for racialized peoples.Footnote 20\n\nRace as a social construct\n\nThe belief in scientific racism shifted in the 1950s and 1960s, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, and the establishment of the United Nations and its international agencies. For instance, in a series of statements on “race,” signed by notable scientists, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) asserted that “race” is a social construct and not a biological phenomenon (Nestel, 2012; Satzewich and Liodakis, 2007, 11; Spoonley, 2019, 485). These efforts have been described as a major shift in thinking about “race” throughout much of the literature.Footnote 21\n\n“Race” is biologically meaningless. However, racial differences are still perceived to be real.\n\nRacialization is the socio-political process that attributes social significance to “race” by giving meaning to physical characteristics. Therefore, “racialized” people are defined in relation to a dominant (White) norm.\n\nHowever, despite the urgent need to discredit theories of racial hierarchy in the aftermath of Nazism and the genocide of World War II, much of the literature contends that it is still alive and well (Satzewich and Liodakis, 2007, 11). Rex (1983) argues, “Racism may have originated as a scientific error, but it has taken a life of its own, filtering down into everyday thinking and behaviour, and also into the operations of our social institutions.” In other words, “race” may not “make sense” biologically, but the belief that it is real still persists. In the same vein, Fleras (2017, 36) explains, “…race matters not because it’s biologically real, but because people perceive it to be real or act as if it were real, with often deadly consequences.” (For more details on the continuing relevance of “race,” see Clair and Denis (2015, 857); Galabuzi (2006); Kendi (2016 & 2019); Li (1998); Satzewich and Liodakis (2007)).\n\nSocial scientists have coined the term “racialization” to better reflect the social construction of the term “race,” and its continued use as a marker of current social and economic conditions (Markus and Moya, 2010; Miles, 1989, 76). Li (2001, 78) depicts the use of the term racialization as follows: “The term racialization is often used to highlight the social process of attributing social significance to phenotypicalFootnote 22 features of people and designating those so signified as ‘racial.’” In this sense, diversity refers to non-Whites (see also Thobani, 2007, 158).\n\nA stereotype is the attribution of certain characteristics (whether negative or positive) to a whole group of people. Much of the literature reveals that it constitutes an intrinsic part of racism.\n\nAdditionally, much of the literature points to the fact that “race” continues to be expressed through the assertion of prejudices, such as stereotypes, that is, the attribution of fixed characteristics to social groups. Satzewich (2001, 2) explains that behind stereotypes such as “Asians are good at maths,” or “Black people are good at basketball” lies the belief that “race is an inherent human characteristic,” invoking scientific racism (see also Rex, 1983). Some authors posit that the importance of stereotypes cannot be undermined in the creation and perpetuation of racism. For example, Spoonley explains (2019, 484), “Stereotypes remain an important part of the vocabulary and practice of racism.” Stereotypes, like the concept of xenophobia, are related to “prejudices” in the literature on racism insofar as these beliefs can inform attitudes and set ideas about racialized peoples.\n\nModern forms of racism in Canadian and international literature\n\nThis review continues by examining four aspects of racism: a) Canadian racism, b) the post-racial narrative, c) the subtlety of racism and d) systemic racism. Sub sections b) and c) are quite crucial in understanding systemic racism, as the latter stands opposed to conceptions embedded in the post-racial narrative. The post-racial narrative is also best laid out in the context of the Canadian racism debate and its features.\n\nRacism and xenophobia… often overlap. Racism is an ideological construct that assigns a certain race … to a position of power over others on the basis of physical and cultural attributes, as well as economic wealth...\n\nXenophobia describes attitudes, prejudices and behavior that reject, exclude and often vilify persons, based on the perception that they are outsiders or foreigners to the community, society or national identity. As a sociologist puts it, xenophobia is an attitudinal orientation of hostility against foreigners in a given population.\n\nInternational Organization for Migration, International Labor Organization, United Nations\n\nCanadian racism? Myths, politeness and denial\n\nCanada has been described as having its own brand of racism. What does the literature indicate as to the current debates on Canadian racism?\n\nVucetic (2014) suggests, “Race is a taboo topic in contemporary polite society.” In the same vein, Cole (2020) points out, “Canada keeps being surprised at its own racism.” It often comes as a surprise to learn that slavery existed in Canada, that Canada had its Ku Klux Klan,Footnote 23 and an exclusive White immigration policy well into the 1960s. Thobani (2007, 151), citing McLaren’s work (2004), indicates that theories of scientific racism have not only guided state policies in Germany, but also in other Western nations, including Canada (see Section 2):\n\nAs a partner in the Allied forces fighting fascism, Canada claimed moral superiority over Germany along with its allies in defeating Nazism. But embarrassingly enough, the racial science used by the Nazis could be also found informing Canadian state policy. The heightened association with scientific and biological racism discredited this form of racism so thoroughly that every western nation-state, including Canada, was thereafter compelled to distance itself from the use of such racist science to determine state policy. The continued public use of overtly racialized policies, or the eugenicist values shaping public policy, and of the scientific theories of racial supremacy … become impossible to defend publicly, except among the most extreme sectors of these societies and the overtly apartheid regimes.\n\nFor some scholars, the silences surrounding racism may be telling. Speaking of racism in Canada, scholars note, may seem contradictory in light of its multicultural and equalitarian fabric. After all, Canada is known for having one of the most diverse populations in the world; yet, racism still persists (Dauvergne, 2013; Fleras, 2017; Li, 2001 Teelucksingh, 2021). The coexistence of racism with multiculturalism has been described as “cognitive dissonance” (Dauvergne, 2013), a “Canadian paradox” (Fleras, 2017), a “Canadian myth” (Block and Galabuzi, 2011), or as “ambivalence” (Triadafilopoulos, 2021).Footnote 24 As such, the rhetoric of inclusiveness, it is observed, does not always match social and economic reality for racialized groups (see also Galabuzi, 2001; Nakhaie and Kazemipur, 2013; Schimmele (IRCC), 2016).\n\nIn the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing by police in the United States, several public figures commented on the absence of systemic racism in Canada. In sharp contradistinction to these claims, Walcott (2020) observes, “… denial is part of the system of systemic racism… There are these myths that we are so radically different from the US” (see also Maynard, 2017; Miller, 2020). Similarly, Sandy Hudson (see Bridges, 2020), one of the co-founders of the Black Lives Movement in Canada points out that what really separates Canada from the US in relation to racism is its denial: “The thing that is very different about Canada is the denial that we are faced with when we tell people outside of Black communities that this is a problem that needs to be addressed.” Catrina Tapley (2021), Deputy Minister at IRCC, voices that systemic racism often goes unacknowledged, when it actually needs to be addressed. She states (2020), “if you don’t call it out, nothing is going to change.”\n\nThe Commission on Systemic Racism in the Ontario Criminal Justice System (1995, ii) similarly observes that racism has “a long history in Canada” and “remains a defining feature.” While the focus of this study was on criminal justice, the commissioners note, “Racism has shaped immigration to this country and settlement within it…” The Supreme Court of Canada (2005), likewise, acknowledges that racial prejudice is an indisputable and notorious social fact in Canada.Footnote 25\n\nCannon (1995) reflects upon the idea underlying the politeness, and even gentleness, of Canadian racism, “Canadian racism is, on the whole, more genteel than its American and European counterparts… Because it is more refined, people have a tendency to dismiss racism in Canada, to ignore it, or to forgive it. But that opens the door to more dangerous, more violent forms of racism, and those forms are alive in Canada too” (see also Aiken, 2007, 66 and Ryerson University Symposium, 2021).Footnote 26\n\nHenry and Taylor (cited in Satzewich and Liodakis, 2007, 156) infer that Canadians easily reject the overt “in-your-face” manifestations of racism, and token gestures are regularly made in order to celebrate diversity and inclusion. However, these authors suggest that these gestures mask, rather than address, the root of the problem, especially if the celebration of diversity is used simply as a measure to tick a checkbox to claim that substantive anti-racist actions are being taken. To expand on this concept further, “checkbox diversity” often acts as tokenism and fails to examine the solutions needed to address systemic issues of racial inequality, by presenting demographic representation as the panacea. Anand (2019) explains, “Tokenism is the act of making surface-level tweaks to issues of marginalization that are performative and lack in veritable efforts to reduce inequality.” In other words, diversity, on its own, is not equivalent to equity. McGirt (2019) sheds lights on Anand’s ideas: “if you look to check boxes and simply expect the non-majority culture person to assimilate, you’ve missed the beauty of their presence. Because they walk through the world differently than you, they see opportunities and problems differently than you. That’s the gift.” In sum, while Cannon conveys that Canadian racism is more “refined” or “polite,” and while celebrations of diversity and inclusion are important manifestations of multiculturalism, the impacts of racism remain deeply seated in steep inequalities constructed along “racial” lines (See Part 2, Statistics).\n\nDebates proliferate on the extent to which racism shapes Canadian society. Indeed, not all authors agree on the extent to which racism persists (Satzewich and Liodakis, 2007, 156). Nonetheless, while commentators and scholars disagree on the extent and breadth of racism in Canada, whether in policies, laws, and as a general persistent trait of Canadian society, and while racism is complex and multifaceted, much of the literature highlights that it continues to be impactful. In other words, much of the literature coheres on the point that it exists, has a negative impact on racialized peoples, and needs to be taken seriously.\n\nThe literature, while disparate on the degree to which racism prevails within Canadian society, nonetheless highlights that racism remains a feature of Canadian history, including its centrality to Canadian immigration history.\n\nCanadian courts have recognized that racism exists in Canada.\n\nPost-racial narrative\n\nA feature of Canadian racism, referred to in much of the literature on “race,” is known as “the post racial narrative.” This narrative underpins the idea of a society that is “past the race debate” and is “colour-blind.” This concept suggests that because we are all biologically one species, and benefit from a society legally built around assertions of equality and fairness, racism cannot exist. Ku et al (2019, 293) skillfully sum up this concept, “if race, when defined solely as “biological,” is obsolete, then there is neither race nor racism.”\n\nThis position, coined “democratic racism” by Henry and Tator (2005), includes some of the following features:\n\nColour-blindness: peoples are all the same, despite appearances and underneath various shades of skin tones. Therefore, racism cannot exist.\n\nDiscourse of equal opportunity: it maintains that if everyone is treated fairly and “the same,” all peoples benefit from the same level-playing field. Therefore, no-one is disadvantaged. There are no barriers to accessing opportunities. This thereby leads to the discourse on blaming the victim (see below bullet).\n\nDiscourse on blaming the victim: racialized peoples are making insufficient efforts to partake in a fair and meritocratic Canadian society.Footnote 27 As such, racial disparitiesFootnote 28 (see Part 2, Statistics) exist, but they are the result of the “bad apple” metaphor, e.g. isolated racist incidents or sporadic outbursts. According to this rationale, minorities are responsible for their own problems and lack motivation, or the aptitudes, to succeed.\n\nAccording to this narrative, it is not society that has to change and become less racist, but rather racialized individuals’ behaviour, temperaments, work ethics and overall efforts. In addition, a handful of racialized people, who attains positions of relative power, can be celebrated as “successful” and/or as living proof of the existence of a meritocratic society. Others are, therefore, held responsible for their own predicaments (Satzewich and Liodakis, 2007).\n\nAccording to the post-racial narrative, all human beings are equal. If there are differential outcomes, it is the result of racialized individuals’ lack of efforts, motivations or ability.\n\nIn sum, while those abiding by the post-racial narrative believe in racial equality in principle, or that exclusions may persist, these, according to them, are more so the result of the actions (or inactions) of racialized individuals, rather than structural or institutional. Accordingly, the post-racial, or colour blind, narrative proposes that, “Race based disparities reflect the function of perceived cultural inferiorities and moral flaws rather than structural barriers or inaccessible opportunities structures” (Byrd, 2001, 1,005-1,017).\n\nOvert forms of racism are likely to be strongly condemned and considered unacceptable and reprehensible in today’s society. However, racism is increasingly subtle and less identifiable.\n\nThe subtlety, or insidiousness, of racism\n\nMuch of the literature has shown that blatant racism has been replaced by more subtle and complex forms. Clair and Denis (2015, 857) argue, “while overt forms of racism are now widely condemned, one challenge for social scientists is to conceptualize and measure its more subtle and diffuse manifestations and lasting effects… Contemporary approaches to racism center on explaining the well-documented persistence of racial inequality and racial discrimination in an era of declining overtly racist attitudes.” Similarly, Li (2001, 77 & 79) asserts that “racial messages are often articulated subtly in a democratic society,” and remarks on the challenges of “measuring” subtle racism.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, new conceptual frameworks, such as “implicit bias,” suggested that racism had transformed itself into more subtle, covert, forms. Deputy Minister Quan-Watson (2020) sums up this idea of subtle racism, by conveying that racism is not necessarily about “obvious outbursts and the spectacular,” or “the burning of a cross or the shouting of a racially-based insult,” but is rather more “like an iceberg to a ship travelling at night,” that is, racism is increasingly still and subtle, difficult to detect, and potentially quite damaging.\n\nAs noted, while the decline of biological racism has succeeded in stamping out overt forms of racism as unacceptable, racism still exists, albeit subtlety. Li (2001, 79) argues that is precisely because scientific racism has been discredited, that its expression is more subtle. And while it is “easier” to identify and condemn overt racism, the challenge in identifying its subtle forms is not as yet resolved. Current forms of racism are likely to be less identifiable. The literature reveals a gap in detecting these subtle, contemporary, forms of racism.\n\nSystemic racism\n\nThe core elements of systemic racism (see the box on the following page) are introduced in this section. Systemic racism is further developed in the context of systemic discrimination in Part 2. As conveyed in the definition in the box, and in much of the literature (for instance, Nnorom cited in McDevitt, 2021) systemic racism is made up of interlocking layers. These include an individual, or interpersonal level (personal interactions); an institutional level (organizations and institutions producing rules and policies); and a structural level. The latter constitutes a web connecting all these organizational and ideological structures at the societal (macro) level, with the consequence that compounding effects result in differential, and adverse, outcomes based on “race” (see Part 2, Statistics). Accordingly, Tuyisenge and Goldenberg (2021) define systemic racism as, “the macro-level systems, social forces, institutions, ideologies and processes that interact with one another to generate and reinforce inequities faced by racialized communities.”\n\nSystemic racism stands opposed to the “post-racial,” “colour-blind,” narrative, and points to structural and systemic causes, as opposed to the actions or inactions of racialized individuals, as an explanation for persisting racial inequalities. In this sense, systemic racism underpins the idea that disadvantages, inequalities and exclusions are the inadvertent consequence of systems (read: institutions, organizations) rather than an intentional outcome. The discussion about systemic discrimination in Part 2 explores this concept in more detail.\n\nAdditionally, systemic racism exists when institutions, which appear to develop neutral-based rules, consistently and inadvertently exclude racialized peoples because these rules reflect the norms and experiences of the dominant group (Nnorom, 2021; see also Li (1989), cited earlier in the paper). In other words, the norm by which institutions operate was not devised with racialized individuals in mind. In Fleras’ words (2017, 36), systemic racism can perpetuate disadvantage by “seemingly benign practices.”\n\nSystemic racism is not a “one-off” process. “The literature on systemic racism is diffuse but coheres on the point that macrostructural processes, or its whole structure, as opposed to individual acts, provide more meaningful explanations on racial inequality” (Clair and Denis, 2015). The process of systemic racism does not occur once, but repeatedly produces disproportionate outcomes for racialized peoples.\n\nRelatedly, Rose (2018) explains that systemic racism is not a “one-off” process: it normalizes and legitimizes a set of policies, practices, and institutional behaviours that do not happen exceptionally, but routinely, and produce cumulative, chronic, and adverse outcomes for racialized and Indigenous peoples. It is much more difficult to identify, and condemn, namely because it has been normalized and framed in ways that render it “invisible.” Aiken (2007, 72) argues:\n\nRace continues to influence the opportunities and experience of racialized peoples in North America, even after controlling for other factors… Depending on the context, institutional racism can be manifested in the form of explicitly racist policies in which the state directly reinforces existing racist biases in society or it can be found in a systemic form (“systemic racism”) and concealed in systems, practices, policies, and laws that appear neutral and universal on their face but disadvantage racialized persons.\n\nSystemic racism is an interlocking and reciprocal relationship between the individual, institutional and structural levels which function as a system of racism.\n\nThese various levels of racism operate together in a lockstep model and function together as a whole system:\n\nIndividual (within interactions between people) racism. Structured by an ideology (set of ideas, values and beliefs) that frames one's negative attitudes towards others; and is reflected in the willful, conscious/unconscious, direct/indirect, or intentional/unintentional words or actions of individuals. This is one of the three levels that make up Systemic Racism.\n\nInstitutional (within institutions and systems of power) racism. Exists in organizations or institutions where the established rules, policies, and regulations are both informed by, and inform, the norms, values, and principles of institutions. These in turn, systematically produce differential treatment of, or discriminatory practices towards various groups based on race. It is enacted by individuals within organizations, who because of their socialization, training and allegiance to the organization abide by and enforce these rules, policies and regulations. It essentially maintains a system of social control that favours the dominant groups in society (status quo). This is one of the three levels that make up Systemic Racism.\n\nStructural or societal (among institutional and across society) racism. Pertains to the ideologies upon which society is structured. These ideologies are inscribed through rules, policies and laws; and represents the ways in which the deep rooted inequities of society produce differentiation, categorization, and stratification of society's members based on race. Participation in economic, political, social, cultural, judicial and educational institutions also structure this stratification. This is one of the three levels that make up Systemic Racism.\n\nSource: OHRC\n\nPart 2: Systemic racism and systemic discrimination\n\nIntroductory concepts\n\nPart 2 begins with a presentation of the main processes underpinning systemic discrimination. Subsequently, statistical findings on disparities based on “race,” as potential markers of discrimination, will be fleshed out. The last portion will then explore systemic discrimination, and its principles, as expressed by the federal government, the OHRC, the Supreme Court, and social and legal scholars. As in Part 1 of this review, Part 2 highlights the findings of the literature, in recognition that concepts underpinning discrimination are ever-evolving, and that an all-inclusive review of its legal intricacies and complexities cannot be fully uncovered by the scope of this review. Notwithstanding this challenge, much of the current thinking on the core principles underlying discrimination are herein provided, in line with the purpose of this review.\n\nPoints 1 and 2 (following) will identify the processes that are central to generating systemic discrimination: the first point underlines that, like racism, discrimination does not occur on a personal level only, but also on a societal level. The second point delves into how biases and prejudices in a wide array of domains (health, education, employment and so on) may cumulatively produce, and reproduce, systemic disadvantages and discrimination for racialized peoples.\n\nMuch of the literature points to the key idea that systemic racism and systemic discrimination embody a parallel process of producing systemic disadvantage for racialized peoples (see the two related text boxes that draw on these similarities). Accordingly, systemic discrimination is more than interpersonal discrimination, or how we treat one another on a personal level (e.g. micro-level discrimination). As indicated by the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) and other organizations, systemic racism and systemic discrimination constitute “patterns of behaviour, policies and practices” that “create or perpetuate disadvantage,” and/or “produce… or reinforce chronic adverse outcomes” for racialized persons (Chadha-OHRC, 2021;Footnote 29 Ellermann, 2020; Galloway, 2019; Rose, 2018; Sheppard, 2010).\n\nRelatedly, systemic discrimination has been associated with barriers encountered by racialized peoples in accessing, for instance, education, health care, employment or housing, though access may seem universal. For instance, a job may be open to “all,” but biasFootnote 30 may play role in the disproportionate hiring of White applicants.Footnote 31 Research shows that this is not restricted to employment. In relation to health care, studies demonstrate that the bias of certain health care providers may lead them to treating Black and other racialized and Indigenous patients differently by, for example, not taking their concerns seriously which impacts the level of care they receive, resulting in adverse health outcomes (Amin, 2019; Nestel, 2012; Nnorom cited in McDevitt, 2021; PHAC cited in Amin, 2019; Physicians for Human Rights, 2003). As Riley (2012) argues, “the subtle role of bias in creating and/or exacerbating health disparities is well documented in the literature.” In the field of education, studies show that the bias of some educators is a significant contributing factor to higher rates of suspension among Black students (James and Turner, 2017; Ottawa Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) 2020; PHAC, 2020; Statistics Canada, 2020b).\n\nCumulatively, these biases produce systemic barriers that reproduce disparities – also identified as inequities and inequalities in the literature – in health, education, or employment and so forth, for racialized peoples. Bias or stereotypes are therefore captured as significant factors contributing to systemic discrimination (Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC); Rose, 2018; Kendi; 2019; PHAC, 2020).\n\nThe first process refers to systemic discrimination as a set of behaviours, practices and policies that may create or perpetuate disadvantage for racialized peoples, resulting in adverse outcomes for them.\n\nThe second process refers to discrimination as differential treatment of racialized persons based prejudice (bias, stereotypes, xenophobia) and barriers to inclusion across an array of social goods. Whether intentional or not, the cumulative and adverse outcomes may be deemed discriminatory.\n\nIn line with this phenomenon, the OHRC (2021) underscores that the purpose of anti-discrimination laws and policies “is to prevent … the imposition of disadvantage, stereotyping, or political or social prejudice.” In this sense, much of the literature points to existing biases, barriers, disadvantages and inequities as potentially significant markers, and initiators, of systemic discrimination. Indeed, it is not uncommon to see the phrasing “bias, discrimination and stereotyping” used in an interlocking manner, in the literature (Canadian Centre for Diversity and Inclusion, 2017; Hinton, 2017; Nestel, 2012; United Nations declarations or statements on discrimination).\n\nDiscrimination may be built into an organization’s behaviour, practices and policies. This can lead to a genuine disadvantage for some people… This is called systemic or institutional discrimination. Organizations and institutions have an obligation to be aware of these forms of discrimination.\n\nWhen systemic discrimination is found to exist, an organization must change its practices.\n\nOHRC\n\nSystemic racism plays a role in this process insofar as it sustains the inequities (e.g. disadvantages, disparities). What are some of these disparities?\n\nSystemic racism, discrimination and racial inequalities: Some facts and figures in Canada\n\nNestel (2012, 8) finds that, “Evidence of racial inequities in Canada is substantial. An examination of these inequities can be helpful in thinking about the extent to which racial inequality manifests itself institutionally and within everyday social interactions in Canadian society” (See also Nnorom cited in McDevitt, 2021; Statistics Canada, 2020b). According to Statistics Canada (2020b):\n\nMany recent studies on Canada’s Black population have explored the discrimination this population experiences. Discriminatory practices were noted in several social and economic areas, including the justice system and relations with police services, the immigration system, the child welfare system, the education system and the nursing workforce. According to data from Cycle 28 of the 2014 General Social Survey on Victimization, approximately 24% of Black individuals aged 15 or older reported that they had experienced some form of discrimination because of their ethnicity, culture, race or skin colour in the five years preceding the survey. In comparison, 4.6% of the rest of the population had experienced such discrimination.\n\nCanadian research indicates that “not everyone is created equal when it comes to distributing the power, privilege, and property, with the result that Canada is characterized by racialized inequality” (Galabuzi, 2006). Relatedly, much of the literature points to systemic racism and discrimination as one of the prevalent causes of racialized disparities, also known as differential outcomes (Fleras, 2017; Galabuzi, 2006; Rose, 2018; Teelucksingh, 2021). The OHRC writes:\n\nRacialized persons experience disproportionate poverty, over-representation in the prison population, under-representation in the middle and upper layers of political, administrative, economic, and media institutions, and barriers to accessing employment, housing, and health care to name just a few. Courts have recognized that racism exists in Canada. It is all too easy for those who do not experience it to deny the reality of racism. This is counterproductive and damaging to our social fabric. Racial discrimination and racism must be acknowledged as a pervasive and continuing reality as a starting point.\n\nThe concept of systemic racism, referred to above, posits that discriminatory structures and attitudes, coupled with the continuing impacts of historical disadvantage, may maintain such disparities. Nnorom (in McDevitt, 2021) observes that statistics can reveal the “constant barriers,” faced by peoples by reason of their “race.”\n\nIn relation to these debates, as recently as 2017, the United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent released a report on its mission to Canada. The Working Group (in O’Neill, 2020) finds that:\n\nCanada’s history of enslavement, racial segregation and marginalization of African Canadians has left a legacy of anti-Black racism and had a deleterious impact on people of African descent, which must be addressed in partnership with the affected communities. Across Canada, many people of African descent continue to live in poverty and poor health, have low educational attainment and are overrepresented at all levels of the criminal justice system.\n\nSimilarly, PHAC (2020) argues:\n\nDiscrimination against Black people is deeply entrenched and normalized in Canadian institutions, policies and practices and is often invisible to those who do not feel its effects. This form of discrimination has a long history, uniquely rooted in European colonization in Africa and the legacy of the transatlantic slave trade. Slavery was legal in Canada until 1834. Almost two centuries later, racist ideologies established during these periods of history continue to drive processes of stigma and discrimination.\n\nThough all racialized peoples are impacted by racism, people of African descent remain one of the groups most disadvantaged by its effects in Canada and worldwide. Indigenous peoples are also significantly impacted by racism in Canada and internationally, as widely recognized by Canadian and international studies, the federal government, and the United Nations. In Canada, Black, other racialized and Indigenous peoples face notable disparities. They are still experiencing inequities in power, income and privilege (Block, 2011; Galabuzi, 2006; Pendakur and Pendakur, 2011; Teelucksingh and Galabuzi, 2005).\n\nThe following data show that Black, other racialized and Indigenous peoples are impacted by disproportionate outcomes (“inequities”) in health, education, housing, employment and so forth. For more details, the reader may refer to Statistics Canada’s publications, and publications by the not-for-profit sector and academia. It is important to note that the aim of these statistics is not purely a mathematical exercise. Indeed, extracting these statistics without an anti-racism lens may reinforce racist ideas. For instance, Statistics Canada (2020b; see also the concept of “democratic racism” cited above) observes that Black youth are less likely to have attended a higher educational institution and to have earned a postsecondary diploma, compared with other youth.\n\nRacist ideas may rely on stereotypes to justify disparities (e.g. lazy; unmotivated; lacking in intelligence and drive; good at sports). Statistics Canada’s (2020b; see also OCDSB, 2020) analysis draws on an anti-racist lens to explain these disparities: “studies suggest that factors contributing to this situation include certain teachers’ attitudes, behaviours and biases toward Black youth.” Likewise, an anti-racist lens asserts that “employment discrimination may contribute to the racial wage gap” (Conference Board of Canada, 2017). In the same vein, in terms of health outcomes, Tam (PHAC, 2021) observes that if people of colour are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, it has nothing to do with biology, but rather with “experiences of racism, discrimination and historical trauma” and their impact on health.\n\nWealth and employment\n\nAccording to the 2016 Census, 20.8% of racialized people in Canada are low-income compared to 12.2% of non-racialized people (2016 Canadian Census);\n\nRacialized Canadians who are university-educated earn an average of 87.4 cents to the dollar compared to their White Canadian peers (Conference Board of Canada, 2017);\n\nRacialized people are disproportionately more likely to be working in low-wage jobs (Block – Wellesley Institute, 2011; See also Stapleton – Metcalf Foundation, 2019);\n\nEmployers are about 40% more likely to interview a job applicant with an English-sounding name despite identical education, skills and experience (Canadian Heritage, 2020);\n\nOne in five racialized families live in poverty, compared to one in 20 non-racialized families (sometimes referred to as “racialized poverty”) (Canada without Poverty, 2020; see also Block, 2011).\n\nCrime and criminal justice\n\nIn 2018, 43% of hate crimes were motivated by hatred of a race or ethnicity (Statistics Canada, 2020g);\n\nThe incarceration rate of Black Canadians is approximately three times that of their proportion of the general Canadian population (see Office of the Correctional Investigator, 2021; Thorne, 2020);\n\nBased on two surveys (COVIDRacism and elimi8hate.org), the Chinese Canadian National Council captured 1,150 incidents of anti-Asian racism across Canada between March 10, 2020, and February 28, 2021 (Nicholson, 2021);\n\nBetween 2013 and 2017, a Black person in Toronto was 20 times more likely to be fatally shot by police than a White person (OHRC, 2020).\n\nEducation\n\nBlack youth are less likely to have attended a higher educational institution and to have earned a postsecondary diploma, compared with other youth (Statistics Canada, 2020b).\n\nHousing\n\nJust over 50% of racialized households reside in homes that are not affordable, leading to a risk of homelessness. These homes are neither adequate nor suitable: they may be in need of repair, maintenance, and be overcrowded. In comparison, 28% of non-racialized households encounter these issues (Colour of Poverty, 2019).\n\nHealth\n\nRacialized peoples are more likely to get chronic health conditions (Nestel, 2012 – Wellesley Institute);\n\n“Between 2010 and 2013, 14.2% of Black Canadians age 18 years and older reported their health to be fair or poor, compared to 11.3% of White Canadians of the same age” (PHAC, 2020).\n\nCOVID-19 has amplified disparities in health and other outcomes for racialized persons (for example, in Ottawa, racialized peoples made up 66% of COVID-19 cases in 2020. Racialized people in Ottawa represented approximately 25% of the total population in 2020 according to the 2016 Census, as noted by Statistics Canada (Ottawa Public Health, 2020; Jones, 2020).\n\nIndigenous statistics\n\nIndigenous peoples represent 4% of the population in Canada. Statistics related to Indigenous peoples are staggering:\n\nApproximately 24% of Indigenous people residing in urban areas live in poverty compared to 13% of the non-Indigenous population in these areas (Statistics Canada, 2020e).\n\nAccording to the Canadian Census 2016, Indigenous children account for 7.7% of the child population. However, they represent 52.2% of children in foster care (Indigenous Services Canada, 2021).\n\nAccording to a national study, 53% of First Nations’ children living on reserves experience poverty, which represents four times the rate for White children (Upstream – Assembly of First Nations and Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, 2019; for statistics on Inuit and Métis children, see same study).\n\nIndividuals with an Indigenous identity were more than twice as likely (18%) to have experienced hidden homelessness as their non-Indigenous counterparts (8%) (Statistics Canada, 2016a).\n\nIndigenous women are 12 times more likely to be missing or to be murdered in comparison to any other demographic group in Canada (Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, 2019).\n\nIn 2014, service agencies observed that of the trafficked and exploited women they served, 51% of trafficked women were Indigenous (Canadian Women’s Foundation, 2014).\n\nApproximately 34% of Indigenous peoples have no high school certificate, or equivalency, compared to 18% of the rest of the Canadian population (Canadian Census 2016).\n\nSuicide rates are five to seven times higher for Indigenous youth than for non-Indigenous youth. The rate is among the highest in the world for Inuit youth (Health Canada, 2015).\n\nApproximately 28% of the federal prison population in 2017 were Indigenous people, who only comprised 4.1% of the Canadian population (Department of Justice, 2018).\n\nAlmost half of incarcerated youth are Indigenous (Statistics Canada, 2018a).\n\nThe average income of Indigenous peoples is 75% of that of non-Indigenous peoples (Indigenous Services Canada, 2020).\n\nOvercrowding, substandard and inadequate living conditions have led to disproportionate health outcomes for Indigenous peoples, especially as they relate to the spread of communicable disease like tuberculosis. Indeed, tuberculosis transmission in Inuit Nunangat – the four regions of the Inuit homeland – is more than 300 times higher than among the Canadian-born non-Indigenous peoples (Indigenous Services Canada, 2018; see also Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami’s website).\n\nPrinciples underpinning systemic racism: overview of findings from the literature\n\nRacial disparities cannot be explained by the actions or inactions of racialized individuals.\n\nRacism is considered one of the causes of differential treatment leading to discrimination.\n\nBiases, stereotypes and xenophobia (prejudices) may perpetuate differential treatment feeding into systemic racism and discrimination.\n\nSystemic racism includes interpersonal relationships as well as institutional practices.\n\nSystemic racism works through systems (e.g. patterns of behaviour, policies and practices) that may appear neutral.\n\nHistorical discriminatory practices and their continuing impact on racialized groups constitute a facet of systemic racism.\n\nStructural causes and historical disadvantage may represent one of the key causes of systemic racism and discrimination.\n\nSystemic racism places the culture and experiences of the dominant group as the norm.\n\nSystemic racism is not a one-off occurrence; it routinely and cumulatively produces disparate outcomes for racialized peoples.\n\nStatistics on racialized disparities in outcomes reveal an interlocking web of inequities.\n\nSources: Social scientists, OHRC, Government of Canada, United Nations\n\nPart 3: Systemic discrimination: Intersectionality, substantive equality and the supreme court\n\nOverview\n\nIn addition to the above discussion, much of the literature makes the connection between discrimination and human rights. As noted by the Report of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage (2018), Canada has established a framework to combat systemic discrimination and racism over the years. One such significant piece is the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Charter), as well as other human rights legislation, including the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Canadian Multiculturalism Act and the Criminal Code. United Nations human rights conventions usually describe non-discrimination as a pivotal concept, which may be reflected in domestic legislation. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), for example, stipulates (paragraph 3.3(f)), “This Act is construed and applied in a manner that… complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory.”\n\nIn Canada, the Charter prohibits discrimination on grounds related to “race,” including colour, nationality or ethnic origin. Other grounds such as gender, disability and/or class, may intersect with race-related grounds to produce a form of systemic discrimination that is grounded in multiple forms of disadvantage. Much of the literature recognizes the intersectionality of these grounds.Footnote 32 For instance, Anderson (2010 cited in Nestel 2012, 6) refers to “the intersection of class, racialization and gender relations,” grounded in experiencing life “not solely as gendered persons, but as classed and racialized persons.” Intersectionality, as a concept, will be further referenced in Sections 2 and 3, in relation to the history of immigration policies, and the situation of migrant workers in Canada. While intersectionality can be a highly complex issue, the adjacent text provides a basic definition which the reader can further draw from.\n\nSubstantive equality is a concept that is central to the discourse on systemic discrimination, as recognized by human rights law, the federal government, the OHRC and the Supreme Court. It constitutes one of the more significant concepts in the development of responses to discrimination and inequity of marginalized groups, e.g. those not part of the norm (Dauvergne, 2013; Fleras; 2017; MacKinnon, 2011; Sangiuliano, 2015; Sheppard, 2010). In this regard, according to the Department of Justice (2021), “…the Supreme Court has consistently characterized the guarantee of equality as substantive. That is, the Court has underscored that “the concept of equality does not necessarily mean identical treatment and that the formal ‘like treatment’ model of discrimination may in fact produce inequality.” In recognition of existing disparities, substantive equality allows for “… an appreciation of the complex structural and systemic inequalities in society” (Sangiuliano, 2015, 606).\n\nSheppard (2010) observes, “In the mid-1980s, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that a seemingly neutral employment policy that was not intended to cause discrimination could, however, constitute a form of “adverse effect discrimination” (also known as indirect discrimination). This means that a policy may unintentionally result in disproportionately impacting a protected group (racialized peoples, women, peoples from a specific faith or religion etc.) by means of exclusion, or by reinforcing their disadvantage.Footnote 33 In supporting substantive equality, the Supreme Court challenged the neutrality of dominant norms, or the principle of “equality as sameness,” in recognition that society’s standards revolved around a dominant norm or standard (male, heterosexual, non-racialized, able-bodied etc.) that did not necessarily apply to “all.” Reflecting on Sheppard’s work on substantive equality, Fleras (2017, 86) points out, “the challenge was no longer about incorporating racialized minorities and women into a “palemale” world, but about modifying institutional worlds to make them more accommodative and responsive to those historically disadvantaged.”\n\nSource: Coalition Ending Gender-Based Violence\n\nLong description for the image above: Equality vs Equity\n\nTwo scenes, where the first image is titled Equality.

Each person now sees over the fence to the ball game.\n\nDiscrimination, legal experts and the supreme court: Principles underlying discriminationFootnote 34\n\nThis final and brief section will place the concept of discrimination within the lens of the Supreme Court, and legal interpretations. Of note, not all of the complexities of this subject can be included for reasons of space and scoping; however, the core ideas pertaining to this review will be highlighted, namely in relation to the concepts of disadvantage and discrimination. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Canada acknowledges the importance of the principle of substantive equality, in recognition of the disadvantages experienced on the grounds of immigration status.\n\nRelatedly, while section 6 of the Charter – which refers to the right of every citizen “to enter, remain in and leave Canada” – allows for a distinction between citizens and non citizens (see also Joppke, 2005), that right is not, in all cases, a blanket justification for treating non citizens without attention to already existing vulnerabilities, as highlighted by Canadian experts\n\nDauvergne, 2013; Ellermann, 2019; Galloway, 2019; Triadafilopoulos, 2012.\n\nIn the Andrews decision, Justice Wilson notes:\n\nRelative to citizens, non-citizens are a group lacking in political power and as such vulnerable to having their rights to equal concern and respect violated….I emphasize, … that this is a determination which is not to be made only in the context of the law which is subject to challenge but rather in the context of the place of the group in the entire social, political and legal fabric of our society. While legislatures must inevitably draw distinctions among the governed, such distinctions should not bring about or reinforce the disadvantage of certain groups and individuals by denying them the rights freely accorded to others.\n\nGalloway (2019, 30-31; see also Dauvergne (2013)), by referring to the relevant example of migrant workers, has argued that an appraisal of discrimination should consider the “context and factors” (e.g., context of a social group in its entire fabric, including the consideration that a social group may already be vulnerable on the grounds of their immigration status) as well as a review, or examination, of the following elements:\n\nXenophobia, e.g. the ways in which migrant workers may be portrayed by public discourse etc.;\n\nDoes the policy or law reinforce xenophobia?\n\nAn appraisal of historical experience, namely raising the question of whether historical developments have consistently shown a certain bias toward certain groups;\n\nDoes the policy or law reinforce historical bias toward certain groups?\n\nRecognition of disadvantage, e.g. a consideration of whether the social group is already disadvantaged;\n\nDoes the policy or law perpetuate socio-economic disadvantage, prejudice or stereotyping?\n\nWider impacts on society and consideration for equal concern and respect.\n\nIs wider society impacted by the disadvantages experienced by certain groups?\n\nGalloway (2019) argues that cases by the Supreme Court have taken into consideration “the values that should underpin the concept of discrimination.” In Law (see also Withler and Quebec), the Court insisted that non-discrimination analysis “is to be undertaken in … a contextualized manner,” and further emphasized that discrimination must not constitute a violation of human dignity by creating, or exacerbating, “disadvantage, stereotyping or political or social prejudice” (Nakache and Crépeau, 2006, 11); Sheppard, 2010, 34-35):\n\nIt may be said that the purpose of [the Charter] is to prevent the violation of essential human dignity and freedom through the imposition of disadvantage, stereotyping, or political or social prejudice, and to promote a society in which all person enjoy equal recognition at law as human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally capable and equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration.\n\nSheppard (2010, 40) makes a link between discrimination and how it impacts the dignity of oppressed groups, “the stereotyping, exclusion, prejudice, and mistreatment of individuals because of their membership in historically disadvantaged groups undermines dignity.” As noted above, the recognition that the neutrality, or uniformity of an approach, may reproduce, or reinforce, disadvantage (see “adverse effect discrimination”) may be considered discriminatory. Sheppard provides an example of adverse effect discrimination that is crucial for the purpose of this review. She explains that adverse effect discrimination may occur when differential treatment disproportionately impacts individuals from specific socially disadvantaged groups. More than this, she (2010, 21) observes that a seemingly neutral policy may have discriminatory impacts:\n\nFor example, if domestic workers are excluded from labour standards regulation, the legislation on its face may not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, or national or ethnic origin. However, if we assign the gender, race, and national and ethnic origin of domestic workers, who are largely women who have migrated from developing countries, the discriminatory impact of the differential treatment of domestic workers is clear. Facially neutral categories, in this instance, may have disparate effects on groups traditionally protected in human rights laws. (See also Sections 2 and 3)\n\nWhile cases and interpretations are ongoing, and jurisprudence complex and in-flux, these considerations have been brought to the reader’s attention so that key aspects of the debates may be captured by the review.\n\nThis section has reviewed much of the literature regarding discrimination, as grounded in the Charter and enumerated by Canadian legal theorists, social scientists, the OHRC and the Government of Canada. The literature suggests that while Canada has the right to discriminate with regards to immigration (section 6 of the Charter), this right is not absolute and should not diminish core Charter values and human rights. Such values include reciprocal respect, substantive equality, respect for human dignity and caution as to whether laws and policies may augment xenophobia, and/or stereotypes, and enhance historical disadvantage based on “race,” or other grounds.\n\nFurthermore, much of the current literature highlights that discrimination is not only a legalistic concept, but one that is embedded in values and ethics by which the government abides. A recognition of the vulnerability of certain populations should be acknowledged in any decision that impacts them.\n\nAs observed in the literature, and by Canadian legal experts, a deracialized/neutral discourse which has racist effects is still discriminatory.\n\nPrinciples underpinning systemic discrimination: Overview of findings from the literature\n\nDiscrimination may be present in facially neutral policies.\n\nDiscrimination does not have to be intentional to qualify as discriminatory.\n\nDiscrimination reproduces stigma and reinforces stereotypes and xenophobia.\n\nDiscrimination reinforces historical disadvantages.\n\nDiscrimination systematically violates the rights of certain groups.\n\nDiscrimination accelerates inequities, ignores the vulnerabilities of certain groups, and leads to further institutionalization of group disparities.\n\nDiscrimination ignores, or reinforces, barriers to accessing services and opportunities.\n\nDiscrimination ignores substantive equality, or the presence of disadvantages as a starting-point.\n\nDiscrimination violates the principle of equal respect, and demeans inherent human dignity and worth.\n\nSources: Supreme Court of Canada, Government of Canada, OHRC, social scientists, legal theorists\n\nSection 2: Racism and discrimination in Canadian immigration history\n\nPart 1: Racism in Canadian immigration history\n\nSection 2 explores racism in immigration history, starting from the late 19th century. It will be divided into two parts: the first part relates to immigration history and racism, which is key to understanding the literature on racism and the emergence of temporary migration programs, in Part 2. Triadafilopoulos (2012) depicts two main periods as central to the development of Canadian immigration policy – the first being the turn of the 20th century until the Second World War. This approach to immigration policy during this first time period was primarily justified, and bolstered, by scientific racism (see Section 1). In the literature, this time-period is commonly referred to as the building of “White Canada” or the “Keep Canada White” era.Footnote 35\n\nThis time period overtly favoured British and European immigration in order to preserve the cultural typography, or White British “character,” of Canada. Stasiulis and Bakan (1997, 33) accordingly suggest, “A racial/ethnic hierarchy in immigration policy emerged that judged potential migrants according to their distance from, and proximity to, ‘white British’ ideals.” The belief in the superiority of certain peoples was not merely a point of debate, but was enshrined in Canadian law.\n\nThe second period centred on the aftermath of the Holocaust, decolonization and the emergence of a global human rights culture and coincided with the discrediting of racism internationally (Triadafilopoulos, 2007, 3). It witnessed the emergence of the points system, or the human capital approach, as well as the introduction of temporary migrant programs. According to much of the literature, these two periods have influenced, and shaped, Canadian immigration policies to this day.\n\nPart 2: The building of “White Canada”: Turn of the century until the Second World War\n\nThe first period, which in the words of Hawkins (1989, 8), is often relegated to “discreet silence,” is reviewed by a complex literature derived from legal scholars, sociologists, and historians who describe the construction of Canada as an extension of Britain (Venkatesh 2019, 83). In this context, Jakubowski (1997, 12) writes, “Striving to preserve the British character of Canada, efforts were directed towards excluding some people from entry, while encouraging others to settle” (see also settler colonialism).Footnote 36 Potential migrants were ranked into categories, with “preferred” immigrants being drawn from Great Britain, the United States, France and, to a lesser extent, Northern and Western Europe. When these recruitment efforts failed to produce the large numbers required to settle Canada’s western prairie land, the federal government extended its preferential policies to include other “White” immigrants – for example Ukrainians, Italians, Poles and Hutterites – classified as “non-preferred.”\n\nIn the late 19th century, Canada sought to import White agriculturalists to contribute to the settlement of western Canada. The literature overwhelmingly suggests that White immigrants were viewed as being of “superior stock” and “good stock,” and consequently more preferable to, and assimilable than, immigrants of colour (Jakubowski, 1997; Satzewich, 1991; Stasiulis and Jhappan, 1995; Triadafilopoulos, 2012). Nonetheless, even with the expansion of the “White category” to include more immigrants from less desirable source countries – e.g. Central and Eastern Europe – Canada’s labour needs could still not be met (Bolaria and Li, 1988).\n\nAsian Immigration\n\nProjects that necessitated the recruitment of non-White labour included the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) from 1881 to 1885. The western section of CPR was mostly built by Chinese workers and led to a notable increase in immigration (Bolaria and Li, 1988, 72; Venkatesh, 2019, 86). Chinese workers were considered to be a cheap and readily available source of labour. Their non-whiteness, however, did not go unnoticed, especially upon near completion of the CPR. As Venkatesh (2019, 86) explains, “Immigration policies towards people from China provide the paradigmatic example of the coexistence of migrant labour with the xenophobic construction of anti-immigrant myths.” Stereotypes built around Chinese workers depicted them as unclean, deprived of morality, and as a threat to Canadian health and safety. This prompted public calls to limit the entry of “inferior” foreigners leading to the implementation of controls on Chinese immigration (Triadafilopoulos, 2013, 27). Prime Minister John A. Macdonald stated in this regard, “It will be all very well to exclude Chinese labor, when we can replace it with white labor, but until that’s done, it is better to have Chinese labor than no labor at all” (cited in Triadafilopoulos, 2013, 27).\n\nIndeed, Chinese immigration was accepted so long as its labour was indispensable. Because British Columbia sought an outright exclusion of Chinese labour, the federal government sought to appease tensions by introducing the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 which required Chinese immigrants to pay “a head tax” of $50, with exemptions for diplomats and merchants, so as to restrain their entry.Footnote 37 This tax was subsequently raised to $100 in 1900 and $500 in 1903 (Abu-Laban, 1998, 77; Matas, 1985, 8-9). Generally, the wives and children of Chinese labourers – working class immigrants – were excluded from entering, and settling in, Canada (Abu-Laban, 1998, 72).Footnote 38 Thobani (2007, 130) reveals the interwoven raced (non-White), classed (working-class), and gendered effects (wives and children) of lasting family separation: “Many Chinese men, as is well known, lived out their lives in Canada as ‘married bachelors’ because their wives and children were forced to remain in China. Immigration policies had specific gendered and classed consequences for family life well after the mid-20th century” (In Section 2, some of these historical patterns will be linked to the subject of migrant workers in the contemporary context).\n\nOther discriminatory policies of the time included the 1907 Gentleman’s Agreement with Japan and the 1908 Continuous Journey Stipulation that primarily impacted immigrants from India and Japan (Bolaria and Li, 1988, 170; Jakubowski, 1997, 14; Canadian Museum of Pier 21). Under the first agreement, the Japanese government agreed to voluntarily limit the number of Japanese immigrants arriving in Canada on an annual basis. This was within the context of anti-Asian sentiment rising in the province of British Columbia, which called for restrictions on Japanese immigration (Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21).\n\nAccording to the Continuous Journey Stipulation, immigrants arriving in Canada “otherwise than by a continuous journey from countries of which they were natives or citizens … may be refused entry.” To be able to enter Canada, people had to come through “one continuous journey” and “through ticket” from their country of origin. The only company able to provide a continuous journey from India to Canada was the CPR. However, the Government of Canada directed the CPR to prohibit the sale of any “through ticket to Canada” (Bolaria and Li, 1988, 170). This was considered a subtle way of restricting entry from India – a restriction subsequently exemplified by the Komagata Maru incident which challenged the regulations of the Continuous Journey regulation.\n\nOf note, the Komagata Maru was a Japanese ship transporting 376 passengers from Punjab province in British India. It set anchor in Vancouver harbour in 1914 and stayed for approximately two months. The owner of the ship argued that, as British citizens, passengers had the right to disembark in Canada. However, passengers were not admitted to Canada, by order of the Canadian courts. Canadian courts settled the matter as such (see Macklin, 2011, 59):\n\nIn that our fellow British subjects are of different racial instincts to those of the European race – and consistent therewith, their family life, rules of society and laws are of a very different character – in their own interests, their proper place of residence is within the confines of their respective countries in the continent of Asia, not in Canada… [Their customs will] give rise to disturbances destructive to the well-being of society and against the maintenance of peace, order and good government ... Better that people of non-assimilative race should not come to Canada, but rather that they should remain of residence in their country of origin…\n\nFrom an historical perspective, not only were Indian customs considered “destructive” to Canada, but the climate rationale entered this discourse by designating them as a “non assimilative” race. Indeed, retracing this period, scholars explain that the theory underlying racial discrimination at the time was grounded in “the assimilation argument” (Bolaria and Li, 1988, 171). In 1908, for instance, Mackenzie King’s report on Indian immigration stated that “the native of India is not a person suited to this country… accustomed as many of them are to the conditions of a tropical climate, and possessing manners and customs so unlike our own people,” or, spoke of “their inability to readily adapt themselves to surroundings entirely different…” (cited in Bolaria and Li, 1988, 171).\n\nHenry et al (1995, 73; see also Jakubowski, 1997, 15) specify that the 1908 Continuous Journey Stipulation, “amended the Immigration Act to allow the government to control East Indian immigration without having the appearance of doing so.” A year after its introduction, six South Asians entered Canada compared to 2,500 the year preceding it (Henry et al, 1995, 73; Jakubowski, 1997, 15; Thobani, 2007, 92), while the departure of the Komagata Maru “signalled the virtual cessation of Indian immigration to Canada.”\n\nIn sum, the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Gentleman’s Agreement and the Continuous Journey Stipulation were mechanisms by which almost no Asians emigrated to Canada until after the Second World War based on the racist belief that they constituted “non-assimilative “races” of “destructive customs” (Henry et al, 1995; Jakubowski, 1995, 73; Kelly and Trebilcock, 2010).\n\nClimatic unsuitability and exclusion from Canada: Differential treatment based on “Race”\n\nBlack people were excluded from subsidized settlement opportunities in western Canada (Aiken, 2007, 63-4; Venkatesh, 2019, 83). The Laurier government (1896-1911) chose to restrict African-American immigration, including with \"informal” measures which encompassed medical and character examinations. Any examination at the border was to result in the rejection of most Black immigrants (Triadafilopoulos, 2012, 31). Indeed, Schwinghamer (2021) explains that “remarkable efforts” were made to discourage African-American immigration at their points of origin. In the early 20th century, Canadian immigration officials prevented African-American immigration to Canada through the use of “selective enforcement of regulations, deception, bribery, and other questionable methods” (Schwinghamer, 2021).\n\nIn the early 20th century, Canadian immigration officials prevented African American immigration to Canada through the use of “selective enforcement of regulations, deception, bribery, and other questionable methods.”\n\nSteve Schwinghamer, 2021\n\nBetween 1905 and 1912, while hundreds of thousands of Americans came to Canada, only about 1,000 African-Americans, who sought to escape discrimination in the United States (Schwinghamer, 2021), did so. The reasons for this exclusion were based on Canadian domestic pressure, including the fact that many Canadian civic organizations asked for a ban on black immigration, fearing social unrest. Campaigns of dissuasion were embedded in the enacting of “passive but deliberate barriers” by Canadian immigration authorities against African-Americans (Schwinghamer, 2021; see also Dunsworth, 2018, 566). These “passive barriers” included: bribes to medical officers to turn away potential African-American settlers; Canadian authorities requesting agents in the U.S. to warn potential African-American settlers of the dangers posed by Canada; forbidding immigration officers to provide African-Americans with a certificate verifying their status as farmers; or requiring railway representatives to demand full fare, instead of the reduced fare for settlers. The secretary in the department of immigration justified such exclusion on the grounds of the unsuitability of the Canadian climate for Black peoples. He wrote, “the climate and other conditions of this country are not such as would be found congenial to coloured people” (cited in Schwinghamer, 2021).\n\nWhat is more, scholars suggest that as the need for labour diminished, the government started passing discriminatory legislation and policies to restrict the entry of immigrants from “undesirable” sources based on their “race.” The Immigration Act of 1910 gave the government the authority to exclude the entry of immigrants “belonging to any race deemed unsuitable to the climate and requirements of Canada or immigrants of any specified class, occupation, or character.”Footnote 39\n\nThe aim of the Immigration Act of 1910 was to limit immigration to “healthy, white, preferably British or American agriculturalists,” or, as explained by Thobani (2007, 92) and Jakubowski (1997, 17) the Act was a “principal instrument” for the maintenance of the “Keep Canada White” policies (see also Triadafilopoulos, 2012, 31). The Act remained in effect for the next 50 years, explicitly favouring European immigration (Thobani, 2007, 92). Paragraph 38(c) stipulated that “race” was a prohibitive legal category that created an undesirable category of immigrants. In 1919, it was amended to include “nationality,” a race-related ground. Paragraph 38(c) described those who could be denied entry as:\n\nany nationality or race of immigrants of any specified class or occupation, by reason of any economic, industrial or other condition temporarily existing in Canada or because such immigrants are deemed unsuitable having regard to the climatic, industrial, social, educational, labour… or because such immigrants are deemed undesirable owing to their peculiar customs, habits, modes of life, methods of holding property and because of their probable inability to become readily assimilated or to assume the duties and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship within a reasonable time after their entry.\n\nThis idea was also circulated in an immigration promotion pamphlet of the time (Law Union of Ontario, 1981, 26):\n\nCanada is situated in the North Temperate Zone… The climate is particularly suited to the white race. It is the land of homes – the new homeland of the British people. British people soon find themselves at home in Canada. It is a British country, with British customs and ideals…\n\nJakubowski (1997, 16) contends that by including paragraph 38(c), discrimination became enshrined in law by instituting “differential treatment based on race,” which was reflected in the creation of a list of preferred countries:\n\nThe policy of the Department [1910] at the present time is to encourage immigration of farmers, farm labourers, and female domestic servants from the United States, the British Isles, and certain Northern European countries, namely France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Iceland. On the other hand, it is the policy of the Department to do all in its power to keep out of the country … those belonging to nationalities unlikely to assimilate and who consequently prevent the building up of a united nation of people of similar customs and ideals.\n\nSimilarly, the total exclusion of Chinese migrants was advocated by many, including the Trades and Labour Congress, the Retail Merchants Association of Canada, and the Ku Klux Klan of Canada.\n\nThis culminated in the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 which limited entry or landing of persons of Chinese origin bar exemptions (Triadafilopoulos, 2013, 36). Consequently, between 1923 and 1947, less than 50 Chinese immigrants were allowed entry into the country (Thobani, 2007, 92). Bolaria and Li (1998) underscore that discrimination against the Chinese cannot be framed in terms of a “historical accident”: “the removal of citizenship rights and the restriction on occupational competition were legally sanctioned by the state, and as such, were incorporated into the institutions of Canada.”\n\nThe authors go on to underline the unconcealed racist contours of immigration policies, “Such discrimination was systematic and legal, and was rationalized by an ideology which advocated the racial superiority of whites over non whites”\n\nBolaria and Li, 1988, 109.\n\nBy the end of 1920, most Asians, Africans, and Continental Europeans, particularly Jews, were categorically excluded from Canada. Immigration was limited to those deemed “desirable,” that is, immigrants constructed as “preferred races” (Thobani, 2007, 17). In 1939, the MS St. Louis, a ship carrying more than 900 Jewish refugees, was forced to return to Europe because Canada had refused passengers safe haven. As a result, 254 Jews later died in concentration camps. During the Nazi regime (1933 to 1945), “Canada accepted fewer Jewish refugees than any other Western nation. A senior Canadian immigration official asked during the war about how many Jews would eventually be considered for entry into Canada, provided a now infamous response: “None is too many” (BBC, 2018). This phrase is widely quoted insofar as it reflects the policies of the time. Frederick C. Blair, Director of Immigration Branch in the MacKenzie King administration, supported a closed door policy on Jewish refugees and advised the government not to accept the entry of Jews aboard the St. Louis.Footnote 40 While other examples may be cited, scholars have described this period as “racist in orientation, assimilationist in objective” (Elliott and Fleras cited in Jakubowski, 1997, 11). In the aftermath of two world wars and the depression, immigration had reached an all-time low of 7,576 in Canada (Elliott and Fleras, 1996, 16). The renewal of immigration did not occur until 1947.\n\nPart 3: Post-World War II period\n\nThe second period, characterized by a discrediting of racism, the aftermath of the Holocaust, and the initial enunciation of human rights principles, was supported by an individualist ethic, “holding that all persons were endowed with fundamental rights regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality” (Triadafilopoulos, 2012, 8). Triadafilopoulos (2012, 9; see also Satzewich, 1991) goes on to state, “This is not to say that racial discrimination disappeared after the Second World War; rather, the discrediting of racism and integral nationalism as legitimizing principles made discriminatory policies harder to defend and maintain in the face of normatively sanctioned criticism. In both Canada and Germany, governments’ sensitivity to these views created the conditions for policy change.”\n\nSimilarly, Thobani (2007, 15 and 109) points out that the citizenship and immigration legislation that distinguished between “preferred” (initially British and French, and thereafter other European nationalities) and “non preferred” (Asians, Africans and Caribbeans) “races” prevailed until the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, this feature was a result of earlier thinking on “non assimilative races.” For instance in 1947, Prime Minister Mackenzie King provided a statement on immigration that reflected the undesirability of certain migrants based on origin (House of Commons Debates, 1947):\n\nPrime Minister MacKenzie’s statement, underpinning the right of Canada to select immigrants (now section 6 of the Charter), can nonetheless result in discriminatory effects if prejudice/xenophobia are part of the selection process, as reviewed in Section 1. These stereotypes rooted in claims of inability to assimilate led to the racist belief that racialized peoples were not compatible with an idealized view of Canada as White in nature and culture. Preferential treatment was still to be given to “British subjects from the U.K., Ireland, Newfoundland, New Zealand, Australia or the Union of South Africa, and also citizens of the United States” who were considered to be more easily assimilated into Canada’s white “character” (Manpower in Immigration, 1974, 203; Jakubowski, 1997, 17).\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Canada repealed the Chinese Immigration Act and enfranchised Asian Canadians. Likewise, Canada established an annual quota for immigration from India, Pakistan and Ceylon, with the aim of dismantling racial discrimination. This did not, however, modify the intent of the Immigration Act of 1952 which maintained paragraph 38(c), but replaced the category of “race” with “ethnic group” (Hawkins, 1989, 17). The Minister was given discretion to ban or limit the admission of people on the grounds of “ethnicity, nationality, geographic origin, peculiarity of custom, unsuitability of climate or inability to become assimilated” so as not to disrupt the character of Canada’s population, which is to say, of White European origin (Jakubowski, 1997, 17).Footnote 42\n\nAs Jakubowski and Glasbeek (1997, 9) demonstrate, while initially the idea was to build a “White Canada,” the need for labour and the rise of internationalism put an end to th"
