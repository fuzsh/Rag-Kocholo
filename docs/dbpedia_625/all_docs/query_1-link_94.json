Introduction\n\nThis practice guidance aims to assist all agencies working with children; adults who are parents/carers or with pregnant women and their partners in identifying situations where action is needed to safeguard a child or promote their welfare as a result of an adult’s mental ill health.\n\nThe mental health of a parent or carer does not necessarily have an adverse impact on a child, but it is essential to assess the implications for the child. Just as there is a range in severity of illness, there is also a range of potential impact on families. The majority of parents with a history of mental ill health present no risk to their children, however even in cases of low-level concerns; the needs of the children should be paramount.\n\nIt is important to recognise other issues that can exacerbate the risk presented by mental health issues. For example; the presence of drug or alcohol dependency and domestic abuse in addition to mental health problems with little or no family or community support would indicate an increased likelihood of risk of harm to the child, and to the parents’ mental health and wellbeing. Relying on a diagnosis is not sufficient to assess levels of risk. This requires an assessment of every individual’s level of impairment and the impact on the family.\n\nIt is essential that the diagnosis of a parent/carer’s mental health is not seen as defining the level of risk. Similarly, the absence of a diagnosis does not equate to there being little or no risk. An assessment should consider the impact on the child of behaviour and support services.\n\n2. Key Definitions\n\n‘Parent’ may refer to biological and non-biological parents or carers including grandparents, pregnant women and their partners and any adult who has regular responsibility for the care of a child or young person (this may not necessarily mean that the adult in this context has Parental Responsibility in legal terms).\n\nThe term “mental ill health” is used to cover a wide range of conditions, from eating disorders, mild depression and anxiety to psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\n\nInformation about some of the most common conditions can be accessed here:\n\nhttps://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems\n\nhttps://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/problems-disorders\n\n3. Responding to Concerns\n\nThe most effective response to children and families affected by mental ill health comes through all agencies adopting a holistic whole family approach. This is based on coordinating the support provided by adult and children’s services to a single family “at risk” in order to secure better outcomes for the children and adults through the use of targeted, specialised and whole family approaches to addressing family needs.\n\n3.1 Fundamental to this approach is good inter-agency practice characterised by:\n\nRoutine enquiry\n\nRobust inter-agency communication and information sharing\n\nJoint assessment of need\n\nJoint planning; and action in partnership with the family\n\nEarly Help Assessment (EHA) processes should support this and, where necessary, Child in Need and Child Protection Assessment and planning processes\n\nIn any situation where there is a perceived conflict between the interests of the adult and those of the child, all agencies must treat the child’s needs and safety as paramount.\n\n3.2 Most children with additional needs due to an adult’s mental ill health are considered under the EHA processes and without the intervention of Children’s Social Care.\n\nhttps://www.peterborough.gov.uk/healthcare/professionals-area/early-help/the-early-help-approach-in-peterborough/\n\nhttps://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/children-and-families/parenting-and-family-support/providing-children-and-family-services-how-we-work/\n\nHowever, all agencies must be alert to the potential risks to children of parental mental ill health and must consider its impact on the safety and well being of the children and the need for specialist assessment, consulting other agencies as necessary.\n\nIf any agency has concerns that a child is at risk of harm because of the impact of the parent/carer’s mental health they should check to see if the child is subject to a Child Protection Plan.\n\n3.3 The Children Effective Support for Children and Families in Peterborough and Cambridgeshire (Thresholds) Document Nov 2018 should be used to assess the level of support or need for specialist referral on a case to case basis.\n\nFull details about Early Help and access to Social Care, including processes and contact details are contained within this.\n\nIf an EHA is required, professionals should seek the parent’s/carer’s consent and follow the EHA process.\n\nProfessionals should follow their own agency’s safeguarding procedures. They should consult their line manager or agency safeguarding lead if they are uncertain about the need to refer to Children’s Social Care.\n\nThroughout their involvement with the adult and children, professionals must continually review the impact of mental ill health on parenting capacity and the safety and well being of the children.\n\n4. Children are at greatest risk when:\n\nThe child features within parental delusions.\n\nThe child becomes the focus of the parent’s aggression.\n\nIn these circumstances the child should be considered at immediate risk of harm and a referral made to Children’s Social Care Services in accordance with the Referrals Procedure.\n\nIf you have a concern regarding a child or young person and would like to discuss it further, you should consult the Safeguarding Lead or a Safeguarding Professional within your organisation.\n\nIf at any time you have reasonable concern that a child or young person has suffered significant harm or may be at immediate risk of suffering significant harm, please contact children’s social care:\n\nCambridgeshire\n\nTelephone 0345 045 5203\n\nPeterborough\n\n(01733) 864180\n\nEmergency Duty Team\n\n(01733) 234724\n\nor contact the Police if you feel the child is at imminent risk.\n\nYou should then complete this form to confirm your referral within 24 hours of your telephone call.\n\nSafeguarding-Children-Referral-Form\n\n4.1 Where it is believed that a child of a parent with mental health problems may be suffering or likely to suffer Significant Harm; a Strategy Discussion/Meeting should be held and consideration should be given to undertaking a Section 47 Enquiry.\n\n4.2 In circumstances whereby a parent/carer has mental health problems it is likely there will be a number of professionals involved from different services. It is important that these professionals work together within enquiries and assessments to identify any links between the parent’s mental health, their parenting, and the impact on the child. Any assessment should include an understanding of the needs of the family and children and an identification of the services required to meet these needs (see appendices for contact details within organisations).\n\n5. Implications of Parent/Carer Mental Health Difficulty\n\nAny professional undertaking an assessment needs to consider the following questions to determine how a parent/carer’s mental problem may impact on their parenting ability and the child’s development:\n\nIs there a child or young person living in or visiting the household regularly? If so, does the child/young person take on roles and responsibilities within the home that provide physical or emotional care or support that is inappropriate, excessive or harmful to their health, education or overall development?\n\nDoes the parent/carer neglect their own and their child’s physical and emotional needs?\n\nDoes the mental health problem result in chaotic structures within the home with regard to meal and bedtimes, etc?\n\nDoes the parent/carer’s mental health have implications for the child within school and attending health appointments etc?\n\nIs there a lack of the recognition of safety for the child?\n\nDoes the parent/carer have an appropriate understanding of their mental health problem and its impact on their parenting capacity and on their child?\n\nAre there repeated incidents of hospitalisation for the parent/carer or other occasions of separation from the child?\n\nDoes the parent/carer misuse alcohol or other substances?\n\nDoes the parent/carer feel the child is responsible in some way for their mental health problem?\n\nIs the child included within any delusions of the parent/carer?\n\nDoes the parent/carer’s mental health problem result in them rejecting or being unavailable to the child?\n\nDoes the child witness acts of violence or is the child subject to violence?\n\nDoes the wider family understand the mental health problem of the parent/carer, and the impact of this on the parent/carer’s ability to meet the child’s needs?\n\nIs the wider family able and willing to support the parent so that the child’s needs are met, and inappropriate, excessive or harmful caring activities are prevented or removed?\n\nDoes culture, ethnicity, religion or any other factor relating to the family have implications on their understanding of mental health problems and the potential impact on the child?\n\nHow the family functions, including conflict, potential family break up etc.\n\n6. Guidelines for Joint Working\n\n6.1 Adult mental health services are provided by CPFT. In office hours you can seek advice from a central source (CPFT safeguarding duty team 01733 777961 CPFT Safeguarding Children (NHSMail) CPM-tr.cpftsafeguardingchildren@nhs.net). Out of hours, please contact CPFT First Response service (FRS). Professional line is 01480 442007\n\n6.2 Adult mental health services – including those providing general adult and community, forensic, psychotherapy, alcohol and substance misuse and learning disability services – have a responsibility in safeguarding children when they become aware of, or identify, a child suffering or likely to suffer Significant Harm.\n\nThis may be as a result of a service’s direct work with those who may be mentally ill, a parent, a parent-to-be, or a non-related abuser or in response to a request for the assessment of an adult perceived to represent a potential or actual risk to a child or young person. Adult mental health staff need to be especially aware of the risk of neglect, emotional abuse and domestic abuse to children. Staff should be able to consider the needs of any child in the family of their patient or client and to refer to other services or support for the family as necessary and appropriate, in line with local child protection procedures. Consultation, supervision and training resources should be available and accessible in each service.\n\nIn order to safeguard children of patients, mental health practitioners should routinely record details of patients’ responsibilities in relation to children, and consider the support needs of patients who are parents and of their children, in all aspects of their work, using the Care Programme Approach. In CPFT the use of alerts and completed ‘Keeping Children safe Tool’ is promoted in all service users.\n\n6.3 Mental health practitioners should refer to Royal College of Psychiatrists policy documents, including:\n\nParents as patients – supporting the needs of patients who are parents and their children\n\nSocial Care Institute for Excellence Guide 30 Think child, think parent, think family: a guide to parental mental health and child welfare\n\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists has also written guidance around ‘Parental mental illness: the impact on children and adolescents: for parents and carers, 2017’ https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/parents-and-young-people/information-for-parents-and-carers/parental-mental-illness-the-impact-on-children-and-adolescents-for-parents-and-carers\n\n6.4 Close collaboration and liaison between adult mental health services and children’s social care services are essential in the interests of children. It is similarly important that adult mental health services liaise with other health providers, such as health visitors and general practitioners.\n\nThis may need to start before the birth of the child e.g. where there are concerns around parental mental health and potential impacts on unborn child http://www.safeguardingcambspeterborough.org.uk/children-board/professionals/procedures/pre-birth_assessment/\n\nThis may require sharing information to safeguard and promote the welfare of children or to protect a child from Significant Harm. The expertise of substance misuse services and learning disability services may also be required. The assessment of parents with significant learning difficulties, a disability, or sensory and communication difficulties, may require the expertise of a specialist psychiatrist or clinical psychologist from a learning disability service or adult mental health service.\n\n6.5 Joint work will include mental health workers providing all information concerning:\n\nTreatment plans.\n\nLikely duration of any mental health problem.\n\nEffects of any mental health problem and medication on the carer’s general functioning and parenting ability.\n\n6.6 Child protection workers must assess the individual needs of each child and within this incorporate information provided by mental health workers. Within Peterborough this is promoted further by the Family Safeguarding model; this will be further implemented across Cambridgeshire.\n\n6.7 Mental health professionals must attend / provide information to any meeting concerning the implications of the parent/carer’s mental health difficulty on the child. These will include:\n\nStrategy Meetings.\n\nInitial and Review Child Protection Conferences.\n\nCore Groups.\n\nIf there are difficulties obtaining mental health involvement please contact CPFT safeguarding duty team 01733 777961 CPFT Safeguarding Children (NHSMail) CPM-tr.cpftsafeguardingchildren@nhs.net .\n\n6.8 All plans for a child including Child Protection Plans will identify the roles and responsibilities of mental health and other professionals. The plan will also identify the process of communication and liaison between professionals. All professionals should work in accordance with their own agency procedures / guidelines and seek advice and guidance from line management when necessary.\n\n6.9 Effective working together depends on an open approach and honest relationships between agencies. Problem solving and resolution is an integral part of professional co-operation and joint working to safeguard children and young people. Where there are difficulties please access http://www.safeguardingpeterborough.org.uk/childrenboard/professionals/procedures/escalation_policy/\n\n7. Contingency Planning\n\n7.1 Childcare and mental health professionals should always consider the future management of a change in circumstances for a parent/carer and the child and how concerns will be identified and communicated. This may include:\n\nRelapse in the parent/carer’s mental health.\n\nFailure to maintain medication.\n\nChange in family dynamics/relationships.\n\n7.2 Professionals need to carefully consider the implications for children when closing their involvement with parents with a mental health problem. Consideration should be given to informing the appropriate Children’s Social Care Services team in order that the implications for the child are assessed.\n\n7.3 In cases of significant risk, professionals can request a multi agency risk management meeting. Please contact the named nurse via CPFT safeguarding duty team 01733 777961 CPFT Safeguarding Children (NHSMail) CPM-tr.cpftsafeguardingchildren@nhs.net\n\n8.

We know very little about the needs and experiences of families where at least one parent has learning disabilities but who are not in contact with social care; and we currently know very little about the experiences of fathers with learning disabilities, although research is now being undertaken in this area.\n\nEstimates of the total number of parents with learning disabilities in the United Kingdom vary widely, from 23,000 to 250,000. What is clear, however, is that there are increasing numbers of parents with learning disabilities in contact with services. Over the last decade or so, clinical psychologists have reported an increase in requests for assessments, and community learning disability teams have seen an increase in the number of parents with learning disabilities on their caseloads. Most children and family teams have at least one family affected by parental learning disability on their caseloads (Booth and Booth, 2005).\n\nThere are also varying estimates of the proportion of parents whose children are removed from their care. It would appear, from a national survey of people with learning disabilities, that about 40% of parents are not living with their children. They are more likely to be living with their children if they are living with other relatives (particularly in the case of mothers), and fathers are more likely to be living with their children than mothers. Six out of ten mothers, who live either on their own or with a partner, are not living with their children aged under 18.\n\nIn one local authority area, about a sixth of family court care proceedings concerned children with at least one parent who has learning disabilities and in about 75% of cases children were permanently removed from their family (Booth et al, 2005).\n\nHowever, analysis of case files across 10 local authority areas found that in less than a fifth of cases involving parents with learning disabilities where their children were removed, most were fostered rather than adopted, and there ‘was no evidence to suggest that parental learning disability in itself was the reason children were removed’ (Cleaver and Nicholson, 2007).\n\nThere is anecdotal evidence of local variations in social care practice and court decisions.\n\nMost parents with learning disabilities in contact with social care experience a range of difficulties. Parents with learning disabilities, who are in contact with social care often experience poverty, unemployment, poor housing, difficult neighbourhoods and lack of information (Social Care Institute for Excellence, 2005). While these are factors experienced by most families in contact with children’s social care; parents with learning disabilities have particularly high levels of need, often experiencing severe poverty and inadequate housing (Cleaver and Nicholson, 2007).\n\nMoreover, the lack of information experienced by poor families generally is compounded for parents with learning disabilities by the inaccessibility of most forms of information. Research on parenting support generally, finds that it is very difficult for stressed families to benefit from such support when they face disadvantages such as poverty, poor health and difficult housing situations (Moran et al, 2004). Social care services, therefore, often need to work with other agencies to attempt to, for example, improve a family’s housing situation.\n\nFamilies affected by parental learning disability are also particularly likely to experience negative attitudes from those with whom they come into contact. For example, small scale studies (e.g. Cooke 2005) and messages from parents with learning disabilities themselves (e.g. CHANGE 2005) indicate that harassment and bullying, and sometimes violence and financial or sexual exploitation can be a major problem for parents with learning disabilities and their children.\n\nMost parents with learning disabilities who receive core assessments from children’s social care also experience other difficulties such as ‘poor mental and physical health, domestic violence, growing up in care, or substance misuse’ (Cleaver and Nicholson, 2007).\n\nParents with learning disabilities may also have low self-esteem and lack confidence, primarily because of previous experiences of discrimination, abuse and segregation. People with learning disabilities are more likely to have experienced physical, emotional or sexual abuse as children and young adults and will carry the legacies of these experiences into their own parenting experiences.\n\nSome professionals have raised concerns that parents with learning disabilities experience undiagnosed mental health problems including: post-natal depression and argued that it is important to diagnose and respond to such needs (Cotson et al, 2001)\n\nProfessionals consulted for this guidance raised their concerns that physical health problems experienced by parents with learning disabilities are also sometimes undiagnosed.\n\nThe presence or absence of social support would seem to be more important than the presence or absence of learning disability in terms of the implications for parenting capacity. Social support and stress are negatively correlated amongst mothers with learning disabilities ‘suggesting that the former may buffer the adverse effects of the latter’ (Feldman et al, 2002).\n\nThe larger more recent and more helpful the support network reported by mothers with learning disabilities; the better their psychological wellbeing and the greater likelihood of positive parenting experiences (Kroese, et al, 2002).\n\nLearning disability may also mean that a parent has some specific support needs relating to their impairment.\n\nThere is no clear relationship between IQ and parenting, unless it is less than 60 (McGaw and Newman, 2005). Although IQ is not a good indicator of parenting capacity, cognitive impairment may mean that a parent has difficulty with reading and writing, remembering and understanding, decision-making and problem-solving, and this will create particular support needs for parenting. Indeed, most parents with these difficulties recognise that they need practical support and help with learning about childcare (Tarleton et al, 2006). Parents who came to a National Gathering of parents with learning disabilities emphasised, for example, that they need information in accessible formats:\n\n“The information given to parents in booklets like ‘Birth to 5’6 is not accessible to parents with learning disabilities. We need information in pictures, plain English, and on tape” (CHANGE, 2005, p.17).\n\nParents’ learning disability can also impact on their children’s development for example; their own language difficulties may inhibit their ability to stimulate their children’s language development. This may mean they need advice about verbal interaction with children and/or additional support to children to help with language development (Cotson et al, 2001).\n\nChildren’s experiences\n\nWe know very little about the experiences of children of parents with learning disabilities, other than that which concerns their parents’ experiences of children’s social care and the child protection system. A study of assessments of families affected by parental learning disability found that half the children had severe developmental needs and two-thirds were experiencing family and environmental disadvantages (Cleaver and Nicholson, 2007).\n\nOne study interviewed 30 adult children of parents with learning disabilities about their experiences of childhood and adulthood. These were children who remained with their families and no comparison was made with children taken into alternative care. Four themes emerged from the interviews:\n\nMore attention needs to be paid to the protective factors which promote resilience amongst children and which “shield them from the potentially harmful effects of parenting deficits”\n\nFamilies affected by parental learning disability are also particularly likely to experience negative attitudes, and worse, from those with whom they come into contact. For example; small scale studies (e.g. Cooke 2005) and messages from parents with learning disabilities themselves (e.g. CHANGE 2005) indicate that harassment, bullying and sometimes violence, financial or sexual exploitation, can be a major problem for parents with learning disabilities and their children.\n\nMost parents with learning disabilities who receive core assessments from children’s social care also experience other difficulties such as “poor mental and physical health, domestic violence, growing up in care, or substance misuse” (Cleaver and Nicholson, 2007).\n\nParents with learning disabilities may also have low self-esteem and lack confidence, primarily because of previous experiences of discrimination, abuse and segregation. People with learning disabilities are more likely to have experienced physical, emotional or sexual abuse as children and young adults, and will carry the legacies of these experiences into their own parenting experiences.\n\nSome professionals have raised concerns that parents with learning disabilities experience undiagnosed mental health problems including post-natal depression, and argued that it is important to diagnose and respond to such needs (Cotson et al, 2001).\n\nProfessionals consulted for this guidance raised their concerns that physical health problems experienced by parents with learning disabilities are also sometimes undiagnosed.\n\nThe presence or absence of social support would seem to be more important than the presence or absence of learning disability in terms of the implications for parenting capacity. Social support and stress are negatively correlated amongst mothers with learning disabilities ‘suggesting that the former may buffer the adverse effects of the latter’ (Feldman et al, 2002). The larger, more recent and more helpful the support network reported by mothers with learning disabilities, the better their psychological wellbeing and the greater likelihood of positive parenting experiences (Kroese, et al, 2002). This and other quotes from parents with learning disabilities, come from meetings held with parents as part of putting together this good practice guidance."
