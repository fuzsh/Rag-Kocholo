        "meta_description": "Uncertainty is a common psychological reaction to the experience of cancer. It is defined as “the inability to determine the meaning of illness-related events” and accurately anticipate or predict health outcomes (Mishel, 1988, p. 225). Uncertainty may be present at any point in the cancer trajectory but is common at diagnosis, initiation of new treatments, and transitions of care, when patients must cope with unfamiliar, complex, and potentially threatening experiences.",

        "text": "Mishel’s uncertainty in illness theory provides a conceptual framework to explain how uncertainty is generated and how it affects psychological adjustment to the cancer experience. Since 1981, when it was created, researchers have used the theory to develop and test uncertainty management interventions in multiple populations of patients with cancer. This article reviews the theory’s concepts and propositions, summarizes supporting evidence, and discusses extension of the theory, clinical implications, and future directions for research.\n\nMembers Only\n\nAccess to this article is restricted.
