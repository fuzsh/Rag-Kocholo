        "meta_description": "Institutional distance is well-recognised as having a significant influence on MNE subsidiary performance in host countries. However, there is less clarity as to how the institutional distance is managed by top management teams of MNEs. Specifically, it is not known whether the previous work experiences of the top management team (TMT) can moderate how institutional distance impacts subsidiary performance. The purpose of our research is to address the research question, how do different work experiences among the TMT moderate the relationship between institutional distance and subsidiary performance? To empirically answer this question, we use a sample of 6119 Chinese MNE subsidiaries with 34,870 TMT managers. We apply ordinary least square (OLS) regression and bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap (BCa) to the data. The results indicate that the strength of the negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance is conditional on the different work experiences of the TMT. We show that the negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance is strengthened with an increase in expatriates in the TMT who have home country work experience (β = −0.346, p &lt; 0.05) but mitigated with an increase of managers in the TMT who have host country work experience (β = 0.129, p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, the negative relationship between institutional distance and subsidiary performance is weakened by increasing diversity of TMT’s international experience (β = 0.555, p &lt; 0.01). Notably, the TMT’s international experience in weak-institution markets has a more salient mitigating effect on the negative relationship than work experienced gained in strong-institution markets. This study contributes to the integration of TMT perspective into institutional management and has practical implications for the staffing strategy of MNE subsidiaries.",

        "text": "Institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance\n\nFactors such as intangible assets (Delios and Beamish, 2001; Nguyen, 2011; Phene and Almeida, 2003), financing (Nguyen and Rugman, 2015), entry modes (Zhao et al., 2017), product diversification (Delios et al., 2008), market learning (Liu et al., 2016), subsidiary entrepreneurship (Birkinshaw et al., 1998; Birkinshaw et al., 2005), host country market environments (Gaur et al., 2007) host country experience (Mata and Alves, 2018) all influence MNE subsidiary’s performance. In addition to all these diverse factors, institutional distance must also be considered in any study of MNEs performance in host countries and indeed this topic has been receiving considerable attention from scholars (Chao and Kumar, 2010; Gaur and Lu, 2007; Shirodkar and Konara, 2017; Wocke and Kgotle, 2021).\n\nInstitutional distance is a crucial concept in international business because of its explanatory power of MNE behaviours (Bae and Salomon, 2010; Xu and Shenkar, 2002). It captures the extent of the difference or similarity of institutional environments between two countries (Kostova and Zaheer, 1999). Institutional distance has been regarded as a salient factor influencing subsidiary performance among researchers in international business (Bai et al., 2018; Nguyen, 2011; Shirodkar and Konara, 2017; Trąpczyński et al., 2019) as it is seen as a key driver behind the liability of foreignness (Eden and Miller, 2004). As institutional distance increases, the liability of foreignness, which is the social cost of doing business abroad associated with the unfamiliarity, and relational and discriminatory hazards increases (Eden and Miller, 2004; Zaheer, 1995). MNEs that face a high liability of foreignness will have poor financial performance because of the increasing cost of coordination, transaction and knowledge transfer (Salomon and Martin, 2008; Zaheer, 1995).\n\nInstitutional distance influences MNE subsidiary performance through its effect on legitimacy and the firms’ transfer of strategic organisational practices (Xu and Shenkar, 2002). Specifically, the precondition for MNEs to survive and thrive in an institutional field is to obtain legitimacy, that is, to be accepted and approved by the external constituents in the social system (Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975). Institutional arrangements define the social contexts of MNEs and shape MNE behaviours (Kostova et al., 2008). Local isomorphism strategy is one way for MNEs to obtain legitimacy by imitating domestic firms (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). MNEs need to adopt a higher level of local isomorphism strategy, especially when subsidiaries face more significant institutional distance because they have to conquer a higher level of information asymmetry and business model incompatibility in the host country (Salomon and Wu, 2012). An alternative way for MNEs to achieve legitimacy is to negotiate with the constituting actors in the social system. In terms of negotiation, a political process of interaction, communication or exchange with the constituting actors is involved (Kostova et al., 2008). The greater the institutional distance, the more effort is required for firms to reach the coordination between the MNEs and the constituting actors. Trade-offs between the external legitimacy in the host country, such as local responsiveness, and the internal legitimacy of the MNEs, such as global integration, are always a concern for MNEs. A broader institutional distance makes this concern more salient because it triggers the conflicting demands for external legitimacy and internal legitimacy within the MNE system (Kostova and Zaheer, 1999). Therefore, it is harder for MNEs to obtain legitimacy in countries with distant institutions, and in this way, institutional distance will negatively affect MNE subsidiary performance.\n\nFurthermore, institutional distance also influences the transfer of strategic organisational practices from the parent company in the home country to the subsidiary in the host country (Xu and Shenkar, 2002). Kostova (1999, p. 308) explains that “Strategic organisational practices are those practices considered to be dominant, critical or crucial for achieving the strategic mission of the firm”. Organisational practices vary across countries because of the different socio-cultural environment (Kostova and Zaheer, 1999). The bigger the institutional distance, the greater the difference between the home and host country institutional profiles. A country’s institutional profile includes regulatory, normative and cognitive institutions. Regulatory institutions refer to the nation’s laws, whilst normative institutions relate to the dominant societal values and cultural norms. Cognitive institutions are the shared conceptions, or the frames through which events are interpreted and meaning is constructed (Kostova, 1999). In this way, differences in the institutional profiles of two countries, in other words the institutional distance between the two countries, can limit and obstruct the transfer of organisational practices between home and host country. This is because organisational practices that reflect the home country’s institutional characteristics may not fit with the host country’s institutions (Kostova and Zaheer, 1999). Another factor that needs to be considered for the successful transfer of strategic practices between home and host country is whether a subsidiary’s employees have correctly understood the strategic practices, and whether they are motivated to engage in the transfer.\n\nThus the success of transfer from home to host country is influenced by the local employees’ cognitive and psychological perspectives (Kostova and Zaheer, 1999). If a practice from the home country is perceived to be conflicting with the host country’s regulatory institutions, normative institutions, cognitive institutions, the local employees will feel reluctant to implement the practices (Kostova, 1999). In summary, institutional distance hinders the legitimacy of multinational subsidiaries and the transfer of strategic organisational practices to multinational subsidiaries. Therefore, we propose:\n\nHypothesis 1: There is a negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance.\n\nThe moderating role of TMT characteristics - an upper echelon perspective\n\nThe upper echelon perspective links individuals and organisations together and indicates that organisational outcomes such as subsidiary performance, are partially predicted by background characteristics of managers in the firm (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Each manager’s unique background and experiences influence their cognitive base and personal values and consequently their behaviour. Hambrick and Mason (1984) define cognitive base as “knowledge or assumptions about future events, knowledge of alternatives and knowledge of consequences attached to alternatives” and personal values as “principles for ordering consequences or alternatives according to preference”. Given managers’ cognitive bases and personal values, their strategic choices are made under conditions of bounded rationality. This means firstly, managers operating in a different institutional environment have a limited field of vision and selective perception of any situation. Secondly, managers will interpret situations through their own personal cognitive maps and values (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). TMT managers’ cognitive maps stem from their stored knowledge and derives from their different life and learning experience and careers (Denzau and North, 2000). Thus, all things being equal, different managers with different previous work experience may perceive and interpret situations in a host country in a range of different ways and respond to the management of the institutional distance in a range of uniquely different ways. Consequently, there will be variation in the performances of subsidiaries caused by the way individual managers respond differently to situations related to managing institutional distance.\n\nWe will use the following two mechanisms of legitimacy-building and strategic practice transfer to explain how TMT’s beliefs and values from their past experiences influence their management of institutional distance. On the one hand, senior managers’ different beliefs will manifest in the process of forming, mobilising and managing the company’s social capital to facilitate legitimacy building (Xu and Shenkar, 2002). On the other hand, successful transfer depends on TMT’s beliefs about how they do things and implement the practices (Kostova, 1999). Strategic practice is less imitable and critical, and according to Kostova (1999, p. 310), “more complex and broader in scope, and more “people” rather than “technology” focused”.\n\nThe moderating role of TMT expatriates\n\nMNEs face multiple stakeholders such as the parent company, the home and host country institutions such as the government and the regulatory and tax authority (Batrancea et al., 2012; Ramona-Anca and Larissa-Margareta, 2013). MNEs need to balance local responsiveness and global integration for their international business strategy (Devinney et al., 2000). Thus, subsidiaries always face a tension between localisation and integration. On the one hand, subsidiaries must customise their products and business methods in the host country using local resources and knowledge but on the other hand, they also need to maintain consistency with the parent organisation’s business methods and products.\n\nWhen MNE consider their staffing strategy for subsidiaries in host countries, they will often want managers to be expatriates from the home country (Abugre et al., 2020; Lupton et al., 2022; Rickley, 2019). Expatriates understand and operate according to the norms and mindset of parent firms and follow parent firms’ strategic practices but that also need to adjust to the local business environment in the host countries. Previous studies have identified that employing expatriates in subsidiaries is not favourable when there is greater institutional distance between the home and host country (Abugre et al., 2020; Chao and Kumar, 2010; Rickley and Karim, 2018). We argue expatriates’ mindsets influence their management of institutional distance, specifically through two mechanisms, legitimacy-building and strategic practice transfer. We start with legitimacy building. One way for the MNE to guarantee control over a subsidiary is to dispatch expatriates to manage and supervise the subsidiary to ensure that it is in alignment with the strategic orientation of the parent company (Devinney et al., 2000). However, parental control of the subsidiary comes at the expense of local responsiveness, which means, achieving local legitimacy by operating in line with the host country’s regulatory institutions, social norms and cultures (Gaur et al., 2007; Lazarova et al., 2017). Local isomorphism strategy is an important way to achieve legitimacy by imitating domestic firms’ behaviours (Salomon and Wu, 2012). However, as an extended form of parent supervision, expatriates are habituated to employing the same mental models used in the parent company (Tao et al., 2018) and tend to have less commitment to local adaption (Fang et al., 2010). With a substantial presence of expatriates from home, there is a challenge for the MNE subsidiaries to establish legitimacy efficiently in the host country.\n\nTurning now to the second mechanism by which MNE subsidiaries achieve legitimacy, this occurs by negotiating with the important legitimating actors (Kostova et al., 2008). It is the local managers rather than the expatriate managers who have greater knowledge and competency in engaging with the political process of approaching, interacting and bargaining with the important legitimating actors in the host country’s environment. An increase in expatriates in the subsidiary TMT raises the coordination and political cost for negotiation.\n\nIn addition to exerting challenges in building legitimacy, expatriates will also influence the process of the transfer of strategic practices. MNEs use expatriates to facilitate knowledge transfer from parent companies to subsidiaries (Chang et al., 2012; Dahms, 2019; Fang et al., 2010). However, the assumption of the facilitating role of expatriates in practice transfer is that there is no expatriate failure. Unfortunately, in reality, expatriate failure is a common problem (Harzing, 1995; Hung-Wen, 2007). Given institutional distance, expatriates and their family members may find it hard to deal with the uncertainty that is inherently part of the oversea expatriation process with the risk that there is expatriate failure. An example of expatriate failure would be the inability to adapt to the new environment, or the inability of expatriates’ spouses or dependent children to accept the relocation, and failure of willingness or ability to learn (Hung-Wen, 2007). As Kostova (1999) indicated, the success of strategic practice transfer is embodied in the degree of implementation and institutionalisation of the strategic practices in the subsidiary. However, expatriate failure will hinder the implementation of the strategic organisational practices in the subsidiary.\n\nTherefore, in summary, we propose:\n\nHypothesis 2: The negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance is conditional on the number of expatriates in the TMT such that the more expatriates in the TMT, the stronger the negative relationship.\n\nThe moderating role of TMT managers’ host country work experience\n\nThe literature on liability of foreignness proposes that the social cost of unfamiliarity, relational and discriminatory hazards of doing business will reduce over time (Johanson and Vahlne, 2015). This is because company managers will gradually gain work experience in the host country and the unfamiliarity with the business environment and relational disadvantage will disappear over time. By learning about the social practice of doing business in the host country, business managers can lead the company in adapting better to the local environment by, for example, developing good relationships with local businesses and thus build up legitimacy.\n\nExisting research shows that firm-level host country experience influences the relationship between the relationship between institutional distance and subsidiary’s financial performance (Gaur and Lu, 2007; Shirodkar and Konara, 2017). The literature also points out that liability of foreignness derived from institutional distance applies not only to firms but also to individuals (Mata and Alves, 2018). However, how individual-level TMT’s host country experience influences the institutional distance and subsidiary performance relationship is yet to be studied. As mentioned, we can explain the moderation effect of TMT’s host country experience on institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance through two mechanisms: legitimacy-building and through strategic practice transfer.\n\nIn regard to the first mechanism of legitimacy, mangers’ previous embeddedness in social networks in the host country’s institutional environment help them to make better sense of social obligations, taken-for-grandness and shared understanding that are inherent to the culture in the host country. Furthermore, managers with host country work experience know what kind of political process is necessary to approach, interact and negotiate within the business ecosystem in order to obtain legitimacy (Kostova et al., 2008; Kostova and Zaheer, 1999). Therefore, a subsidiary can obtain legitimacy more efficiently in host countries in which the TMT has previous work experience.\n\nIn regard to the second mechanism of strategic practice transfer, managers with host country experience will know the institutional idiosyncrasies that differentiate the home and host markets. They will therefore understand how to transfer the strategic practices to subsidiaries more efficiently without provoking difficulties or risking conflicts. The managers’ perception of lower uncertainty makes them feel less hesitant to facilitate the transfer of strategic organisational practices to the host market with distant institutions. Considering the above arguments, we propose:\n\nHypothesis 3: The negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance is conditional on the number of managers who have host country work experience in the TMT such that the more managers who have host country work experience, the weaker the negative relationship.\n\nThe moderating role of TMT managers’ diversity of international work experience\n\nThe literature on the diversity of TMT international work experience indicates their significant influence on firm internationalisation such as export channel choice (Kalinic and Brouthers, 2022), and international performance or innovation (Belderbos et al., 2022; Miller et al., 2016). In our study, instead of investigating the direct effect of the diversity of TMT international work experience on MNE subsidiary performance, we investigated the moderation effect of diversity of international work experience, in other words, how diversity of international work experience moderates the relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary relationship.\n\nAs mentioned, TMT’s diversity of international work experience influences institutional distance management through two mechanisms, legitimacy-building and strategic practice transfer. Legitimacy-building occurs in two ways. TMTs with international experience are more capable of learning about new foreign markets (Carlsson et al., 2005) and make sense of the international business environment and respond appropriately and in a timely way to the legitimacy requirements of the host country environment (Kostova and Zaheer, 1999). Managers with international experience know the essential legitimating factors and can therefore obtain legitimacy more easily compared to those with less international experience. The second way in which legitimacy building occurs, is that TMT managers with international experience perceive a lower level of uncertainty in international operations (Lu et al., 2014). A lower perception of risk and uncertainty enables managers to transfer their practice from the home country to the host country with confidence. Indeed, TMT’s previous work experience enlarges managers’ social networks and can be a potential facilitator for identifying novel business opportunities. Therefore, it can be argued that TMT’s international work experience will help the subsidiary to cope with the liability of foreignness derived from institutional distance.\n\nNotably, managers perceive different levels of uncertainty in different institutional environments. We posit that senior managers with international experience in countries with weak institutions helps them to better obtain the ability to deal with institutional uncertainty compared to senior managers with international experience in countries with strong institutions. Institutional voids and weak institutions prevail in developing markets because of the rapid changes in politics, economy and institutions (Hoskisson et al., 2013; Wright et al., 2005). Companies operating in this kind of institutional environment have a strong impetus to engage, negotiate and solve problems with the other actors in the social system (Carney et al., 2016). Under this situation, companies gradually accumulate the institutional capabilities through experiential learning, and the heuristics, skills and routines that enable companies to navigate under institutional voids or weak institutions (Carney et al., 2016). Senior managers’ experiential learning about how to engage, negotiate and solve problems under high institutional uncertainty help them when they face a new market with distant institutions. Therefore, MNEs with internationally experienced TMTs in a weak institutional environment show the attributes of institutional entrepreneurial ability in managing the institutional uncertainty (Guillén and García-Canal, 2009).\n\nGiven the above, we posit that managers with the improved institutional entrepreneurial ability obtained through their prior experiential learning in markets with institutional uncertainty, are better equipped to deal with institutional uncertainty. They are also better able to penetrate the local networks through political processes and overcome the liability of “outsider-ship” (Carney et al., 2016). The higher the ability to approach, negotiate with and achieve coordination among the important constituting actors, the more efficiently the MNE subsidiary will obtain legitimacy. At the same time, managers who have experience in a market where the rules of the game are in flux will be more flexible as to how they transfer and implement the strategic practices. With an open mind to dealing with uncertainty, these managers may be more innovative and capable of modifying their firm’s business model in order to fit with the local social-economic conditions (Carney et al., 2016).\n\nBased on the above arguments, we propose:\n\nHypothesis 4a: The negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance is conditional on the diversity of the TMT’s international work experience, such that the more diverse the TMT’s international work experience, the weaker the negative relationship.\n\nHypothesis 4b: The negative relationship between institutional distance and multinational subsidiary performance will be weakened by TMT’s international work experience, especially when the work experience was obtained in markets with weak institutions rather than markets with strong institutions.\n\nThe theoretical framework of this study is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nData and Sample\n\nThe hypotheses were tested using data on Chinese foreign subsidiaries obtained from Orbis which a comprehensive database with information on about 360 million private and public companies and is globally complied by Bureau van Dijk. The database provides detailed information on companies’ financial performance, TMT’s characteristics, ownership structures and is widely used in international business research (Limaj and Bernroider, 2019; Trąpczyński and Banalieva, 2016). The Orbis database provides company information and was used to identify foreign subsidiaries belonging to Chinese MNEs.\n\nChinese foreign subsidiaries in 58 host economies outside of mainland China were studied. The following selection criteria were used to retrieve the final sample: 1) subsidiaries where more than 50% of shares are controlled by the ultimate owner; 2) subsidiaries whose ultimate owners operate in China; 3) subsidiaries that are located in foreign countries other than China; 4) subsidiaries that have complete information on key variables of return on assets, TMT background information, date of incorporation, and total assets; 5) subsidiaries located in overseas territories such as Bermuda or Cayman Islands are omitted because of the lack of the measurement of governance indicators in these territories.\n\nFollowing the above procedures, a primary sample consisting of 6145 foreign subsidiaries with a corresponding 35,906 TMT manager observations from 58 host economies was obtained. This paper focuses on the TMT given their leading role in decision-making and strategic management (Shahul Hameed et al., 2022). Next, the dataset was prepared by undertaking the following procedures. First, individual-level TMT managers’ information from Orbis was summarised and aggregated to the firm-level. The number of expatriates and the number of TMT managers who have host country work experience as well as the diversity of international work experience within the TMT for each subsidiary were calculated. Second, the dataset from Orbis was merged with World Governance Indicators (WGI) data developed by the World Bank (Kaufmann et al., 2011). Third, GDP per capita and GDP annual growth rate were extracted from the World Development database developed by the World Bank. Fourth, the Index of Economic Freedom (IEF) developed by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal (HF-WSJ) was added to our dataset for a further robustness check. The final dataset included 6119 Chinese foreign subsidiaries with a corresponding 34,870 TMT manager observations. The slight reduction of observations is due to the deletion of outliers in our analysis model based on Cook’s distance (Mehmetoglu and Jakobsen, 2022). Stata (version 17) software was used to analyse the data.\n\nDependent variables\n\nThe dependent variable in our study is return on asset (ROA). ROA is calculated as the net income divided by the total value of assets. It is widely used as an indicator for organisations’ economic performance and often adopted in international business research (Kotabe et al., 2002).\n\nIndependent variables\n\nInstitutional distance is our independent variable. The World Bank Governance Indicators were chosen to measure institutional distance in line with previous research (Dikova, 2009; Gallego and Casillas, 2014; Hernandez et al., 2018; Malhotra et al., 2009). Beugelsdijk et al.’s (2018) guidelines were followed to construct and operationalise the concept to ensure validity. Kogut and Singh’s (1988) approach shown in Eq. (1) was employed to calculate institutional distance.\n\n$$KSIndex_j = \\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_{i = 1}^n {\\left\\{ {\\left( {G_{ij} - G_{iHOME}} \\right)^2/V_i} \\right\\}} /N$$\n\n(1)\n\nThe \\(KSIndex_j\\) is a Euclidean distance with variance connection. Equation 1, \\(G_{ij}\\) refers to the host country j’s score on the ith dimension of WGI. \\(G_{iHOME}\\) refers to the home country’s score on the ith dimension of WGI. \\(V_i\\) refers to the variance of the ith dimension of WGI and N refers to the number of dimensions. According to Beugelsdijk et al. (2018, p. 1119), ‘World Bank calculates standardised country scores for these six dimensions, hence re-scaling the dimensions by correcting for variance differences is not required’. Thus, the measurement of institutional distance was operationalised based on WGI indicators following Eq. 2. Additionally, to check the model’s robustness, IEF was used as an alternative measurement of institutional distance following De Beule et al., (2014). Equation 1 was used to compute the institutional distance variable based on the IEF. All 12 dimensions of IEF were used to construct the institutional distance indicator and to perform a robustness check. The 12 dimensions of IEF include property rights, government integrity, judicial effectiveness, government spending, tax burden, fiscal health, business freedom, labour freedom, monetary freedom, trade freedom, investment freedom and financial freedom.\n\n$$EuclidenDist_j = \\sqrt {\\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_{i = 1}^n {\\left( {G_{ij} - G_{iHOME}} \\right)^2} }$$\n\n(2)\n\nModerating variables\n\nThe TMT characteristics are the moderators in the institutional distance and firm performance relationship in this study.\n\nTMT managers who have home country work experience as expatriates\n\nParent companies influence the strategic decisions of subsidiaries by posting expatriates. The expatriates in this study refer to employees who have Chinese nationality but reside in host countries. The number of expatriates among the subsidiary TMT was calculated. This helped to capture the parent level influence on the relationship between institutional distance and subsidiary performance.\n\nTMT managers who have host country work experience\n\nThe TMT’s capability of dealing with the liability of foreignness in the host country was captured by measuring the TMT’s host country work experience. This indicator is measured by the number of TMT managers who have worked in the host country.\n\nTMT’s diversity of international work experience\n\nWhether TMT managers were previously or currently working in a country outside of China was manually coded. The number of countries represented among TMT was recorded to capture the diversity of the TMT’s international experience. In addition, the differences in international experience of TMT managers in terms of their work experience in countries with different levels of institutional developments were noted and categorised. Previous studies have argued that there are profound differences in institutional development between developing and developed markets (Cuervo-Cazurra and Genc, 2008; Peng et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2013). Following the United Nations’ country classification of developing and developed countries, TMT’s international experience was categorised into two groups, international experience in markets with weak or international experience in markets with strong institutions.\n\nControl variables\n\nSubsidiary firm-specific characteristics\n\nFirm age was controlled to measure the accumulated influence of subsidiaries’ specific resources on performance, using the duration of operation in years since a subsidiary’s incorporation. Firm size was controlled for by using the natural logarithm of the subsidiary’s total assets. State ownership of the focal subsidiary was also controlled for. This is because state-owned enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises are exposed to different political pressures to implement government policies and have different capabilities to access political resources. Capital was controlled for using the total capital in the subsidiary in the given year to capture the influence of financial assets on subsidiary performance. Current ratio was controlled to capture liquidity performance, which is the current assets divided by the current liabilities. Intangible assets were employed as a proxy for firm specific advantages which determine the subsidiary performance (Nguyen, 2011). Intangible fixed assets were controlled for in the focal subsidiary.\n\nHost country-specific characteristics\n\nMarket attractiveness of the host country has generally been considered a driver of subsidiary performance. Therefore, the annual percentage growth rate of GDP at the market price based on constant local currency was controlled to capture the market potential in the host country. GDP per capita was used to control for the market size in the host country. Both these indicators were extracted from the WDI database developed by the World Bank.\n\nStatistical Model\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{{\\mathrm{ROA}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} = \\alpha _0 + \\alpha _1{{{\\mathrm{INDIS}}}}\\_{{{\\mathrm{WGI}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\alpha _2{{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Expatriates}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\alpha _3{{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Host}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Exp}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\\\ \\qquad\\qquad+ \\,\\alpha _4{{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Int}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Exp}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\,\\alpha _5 {{{{\\mathrm{INDIS}}}}\\_{{{\\mathrm{WGI}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} \\ast {{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Expatriates}}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\\\ \\qquad\\qquad+ \\,\\alpha _6{{{\\mathrm{INDIS}}}}\\_{{{\\mathrm{WGI}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} \\ast {{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Host}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Exp}}}}_i + \\alpha _7 {{{{\\mathrm{INDIS}}}}\\_{{{\\mathrm{WGI}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} \\ast {{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Int}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Exp}}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\\\ \\qquad\\qquad+ \\,\\alpha _8{{{\\mathrm{Control}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\varepsilon _{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\end{array}$$\n\n(3)\n\nWhere TMT expatriates denotes TMT managers’ home country work experience manifested in expatriates, TMT Host Exp denotes TMT managers’ host country work experience, TMT Int Exp denotes TMT managers’ diversity of international work experience all over the world. Control collectively denotes a vector of previously denoted control variables. The robustness of the model was tested by using an alternative measurement of institutional distance. The institutional distance measured by World Governance Indicator in Eq. 3 was replaced with the institutional distance measured by the Index of Economic Freedom in Eq. (4) in the robustness check.\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{{\\mathrm{ROA}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} = \\alpha _0 + \\alpha _1{{{\\mathrm{INDIS}}}}\\_{{{\\mathrm{IEF}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\alpha _2{{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Expatriates}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\alpha _3{{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Host}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Exp}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\\\ \\qquad\\qquad+ \\,\\alpha _4{{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Int}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Exp}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\alpha _5 {{{{\\mathrm{INDIS}}}}\\_{{{\\mathrm{IEF}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} \\ast {{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{\\mathrm{Expatriates}}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\\\ \\qquad\\qquad+ \\,\\alpha _6{{{\\mathrm{INDIS}}}}\\_{{{\\mathrm{IEF}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} \\ast {{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Host}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Exp}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\alpha _7{{{\\mathrm{INDIS}}}}\\_{{{\\mathrm{IEF}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} \\ast {{{\\mathrm{TMT}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Int}}}}\\,{{{\\mathrm{Exp}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\\\ \\qquad\\qquad+ \\,\\alpha _8{{{\\mathrm{Control}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{i}}}} + \\varepsilon _{{{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\end{array}$$\n\n(4)\n\nDescriptive analysis\n\nWe report the variables of interest, measurements and the sources for each variable in Table 1. We report the descriptive analysis, results of the number of observations, variable mean, standard deviations, skewness, kurtosis in Table 2 and the correlation matrix in Table 3. To summarise, our sample includes 6199 observations of Chinese multinational enterprises in 58 host countries. The observations are recoded based on the latest year for which information was available in Orbis. The dependent variable ROA has a mean of −0.296 which means on average the management of Chinese multinational subsidiaries is not very efficient in generating profit from their total assets. However, the standard deviation of 20.556 indicates the Chinese subsidiaries’ performance varies a lot from firm to firm. Furthermore, the ROA is slightly negatively skewed (−0.569) but largely leptokurtic (9.52). Both the Skewness and Kurtosis test for normality and the Jarque Berra test are significant confirming a non-normal distribution of ROA (Ghasemi and Zahediasl, 2012). Following the same analysis, we found that the independent variable institutional distance and moderating variables including home, host work experience and diversity of international work experience are similarly not normally distributed. Therefore, we conducted the correlation analysis with Spearman’s rank correlation analysis which, as a nonparametric analysis, does not require data to be normally distributed (Bishara and Hittner, 2015; Schober et al., 2018). Moreover, the test is much less sensitive towards outliers and extreme values than the Pearson’s correlation test (Bishara and Hittner, 2015; Schober et al., 2018). Table 3 showed the Spearman’s rank correlation matrix with Spearman’s rho. The result shows that the dependent variable is significantly correlated with most of the predictors and the correlation coefficients are all smaller than 0.3 which can be interpreted as weak correlations (Xiao et al., 2016). Regarding the focal moderating variables, TMT expatriates with home country work experience is negatively weakly correlated with ROA (rho = −0.0317), TMT host country work experience (rho = 0.0475) and international work experience diversity (rho=0.0460) are positively weakly correlated with ROA. Institutional distance captured by World Governance Index and Economic Freedom Indicator are highly correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.8822. Besides this, the absolute values of the correlation coefficient among the rest of the predictors are all less than 0.7 which is seen as a benchmark for distinguishing high correlation in Spearman’s rank correlation matrix (Xiao et al., 2016), indicating that the selected predictors have low multicollinearity in a linear regression analysis, confirmed by the variance of inflation factor (VIF) ranging from 1.02 to 4.83, which is far below the threshold for multicollinearity at 10 (Baum, 2006).\n\nModeration analysis with ordinary list square regression and the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method\n\nA moderation effect is said to occur when a third variable changes the relationship between a predictor and outcome (Hayes, 2013). According to central limit theorem, the Ordinary least square (OLS) coefficient estimators are asymptotically normally distributed in large samples and the usual test procedures such as the t and F tests are still valid (Ghasemi and Zahediasl, 2012; Gujarati, 2022; Lumley et al., 2002; Schmidt and Finan, 2018). Therefore, as our sample is sufficiently large with 6119 observations, we tested our moderation effect with OLS estimators and the results are shown in the multiple regression models M0 to M4 in Table 4. To confirm that our results are robust, we also conducted the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method (BCa bootstrap) to test the moderation effects for M0 to M4 following previous studies (Batrancea et al., 2018; Nichita et al., 2019). BCa bootstrap is advantageous due to improved accuracy in confidence intervals (CIs) such as the bias corrected intervals and percentile intervals compared to other bootstrap methods and furthermore BCa bootstrap does not require the normality assumption for the regression (Efron and Hastie, 2021; Rochowicz, 2011). Results of the bootstrap with the 95% BCa confidence intervals and 5000 resamples for the multiple regressions are reported following OLS regressions from Table 4.\n\nWe mean-centred the variables of institutional distance and TMT characteristics, including the number of expatriates, TMT managers’ host country work experience, and the diversity of the TMT’s international work experience to generate the interaction terms (Aiken et al., 1991). To address any potential heteroscedasticity, we also adopted robust standard errors in our regression. The main results are presented in Table 4. Model 0 serves as the baseline, which contains the subsidiary, parent firm-level and host country-level control variables and the independent variable. Hypothesis 1 predicted that institutional distance would exert a negative effect on MNE subsidiary performance. Consistent with hypothesis 1, the results indicate that there is a significant negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance in both the OLS models (M0, β = −2.420, p < 0.01; M1, β = −2.489, p < 0.01; M2, β = −2.349, p < 0.01; M3, β = −2.333, p < 0.01; M4, β = −2.376, p < 0.01) and the BCa bootstrap models (M0, β = −2.420, 95% CI [−3.356,−1.563]; M1, β = −2.489, 95% CI [−3.396,−1.578]; M2, β = −2.349, 95% CI [−3.259,−1.482]; M3, β = −2.333, 95% CI [−3.218,−1.476]; M4, β = −2.420, 95% CI [−3.356,−1.563]). Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is strongly supported. Model 1 to Model 4 exhibit the moderating effects of TMT work experiences in the institutional distance-subsidiary performance relationship. Hypothesis 2 states that the negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance is conditional on the number of expatriates in the TMT such that the more expatriates in the TMT, the stronger the negative relationship. The findings confirm this assertation. The negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance is strengthened because the interaction term INDIS-WGI*TMT Expatriates is negative and significant in both the OLS model (M1, β = −0.346, p < 0.05) and the BCa bootstrap model (M1, β = −0.346, 95% CI [−0.637, −0.056], p < 0.05). Thus, Hypothesis 2 is supported. Hypothesis 3 states that the negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance will be weakened by TMT’s host country work experience. The result shows that the interaction term INDIS-WGI*TMT Host is positive and significant in both the OLS model (M2, β = 0.129, p < 0.01) and the BCa bootstrap model (M1, β = 0.129, 95% CI [0.072, 0.193], p < 0.05). Therefore, Hypothesis 3 is supported. Hypothesis 4 suggests that the negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance will be weakened by the diversity of TMT’s international work experience. The findings confirm this assertation. The interaction term INDIS-WGI*TMT Int Exp is positive and significant in both the OLS model (M3, β = 0.555, p < 0.01) and the BCa bootstrap model (M3, β = 0.555, 95% CI [0.217, 0.886], p < 0.05). Therefore, Hypothesis 4a is supported. When we consider all the TMT managers’ international work experience in aggregate in M4, we found that the moderation effect of TMT managers’ home country experience is negative and significant in both the OLS model (M4, β = −0.386, p < 0.01) and the BCa bootstrap model (M4, β = −0.386, 95% CI [−0.690, −0.117], p < 0.05). In contrast, the moderation effect of TMT managers’ host country experience is positive and significant in the OLS model (M4, β = 0.110, p < 0.01) and the BCa bootstrap model (M4, β = −0.110, 95% CI [0.489, 0.178], p < 0.05). The moderation effect of the diversity of TMT managers’ international work experience is positive and significant in both the OLS model (M4, β = 0.382, p < 0.05) and the BCa bootstrap model (M4, β = 0.382, 95% CI [0.223, 0.735], p < 0.05).\n\nTo further show the moderation effects visually, we plotted marginal moderating effects shown in Figs. 2–4 which are based on M1, M2 and M3 in Table 4. Figure 2 shows the moderation effects of TMT expatriates with home country work experience. Figure 3 shows the moderation effects of TMT managers with host country work experience. Figure 4 shows the diversity of TMT managers’ international work experience. We present the moderation effects at the 50th percentile, 75th percentile, 90th percentile, 95th percentile, 99th percentile, respectively, where the data exhibits conspicuous variations.\n\nAdditional analyses\n\nWe further distinguished subsidiary TMT managers’ international work experience in markets with strong and weak institutions. We hypothesised that the negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance would be weakened particularly by the TMT’s international work experience in markets with weak institutions as opposed to strong institutions. Our findings in Table 5 support this assertation. The interaction term INDIS-WGI*TMT Int Exp Weak between institutional distance and TMT’s international experience in weak-institution markets is positive and significant in both the OLS model (M2, β = 0.640, p < 0.01) and the BCa bootstrap model (M2, β = 0.640, 95% CI [0.213, 1.067], p < 0.05), but the interaction term INDIS-WGI*TMT Int Exp Strong between institutional distance and TMT’s international experience in strong-institution markets is not significant in neither the OLS model (M1, β = −0.161, p > 0.1) nor the BCa bootstrap model (M1, β = −0.161, 95% CI [−0.537, 0.204], p > 0.05). Therefore, we can confirm that the TMT managers’ international experiences in weak-institution markets have a higher weakening effect on the negative impact that institutional distance imposes on subsidiary performance. Therefore, hypothesis 4b is supported. Model 3 in Table 5 also confirms our assertion that the negative relationship between institutional distance and multinational subsidiary performance will be weakened by TMT’s international work experience, especially when the work experience was obtained in markets with weak institutions as opposed to markets with strong institutions.\n\nRobustness test\n\nWe used the economic freedom score to calculate the institutional distance indicator, and the corresponding results are presented in Table 6. The robustness check confirms Hypothesis 1 that institutional distance has a significant and negative impact on subsidiary performance in both the OLS model (M0-M4, p < 0.01) and the BCa bootstrap model (M0-M4, p < 0.05). In the robustness check, we find the interaction term NDIS-IEF*TMT Expatriates is negative and marginally significant in the OLS model (M1, β = −0.0213, p < 0.1) but not significant in the BCa bootstrap model (M1, β = 0.382, 95% CI [−0.048, 0.735], p > 0.05). Therefore, Hypothesis 2 is not supported in the robustness check. The interaction term INDIS-IEF*TMT Host is positive and significant in the OLS model (M3, β = 0.008, p < 0.05) and in the BCa bootstrap model (M2, β = 0.008, 95% CI [0.001, 0.016], p < 0.05). Therefore, Hypothesis 3 is supported. The interaction term INDIS-IEF*TMT Int Exp is negative and significant in both the OLS model (M3, β = 0.064, p < 0.01) and the BCa bootstrap model (M3, β = 0.064, 95% CI [0.030, 0.097], p < 0.05). Therefore, Hypothesis 4a is supported.\n\nInstitutional distance generates liability of foreignness when MNE subsidiaries operate abroad. Mata and Alves (2018) point out that the liability of foreignness applies not only to firms but also affects individuals. We specifically explore the liability of foreignness exerted by institutional distance at the individual level. We extend the work of Shirodkar and Konara (2017) and Gaur and Lu (2007) who both similarly explored the moderation effect of host country experience on the institutional distance-MNE subsidiary performance relationship. In contrast to their focus on firms’ host country experience, we investigate the role that TMT managers’ host country work experience plays in the relationship between institutional distance and Chinese MNE subsidiaries’ performance. Following the postulates of the institutional perspective and the upper echelon perspective, we have tested hypotheses in relation to the moderation effects of TMT’s different work experiences including home, host and international work experience. Our findings correspond with previous work revealing the negative impact that institutional distance imposes on MNE subsidiary performance (Aguilera-Caracuel et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019; Shirodkar and Konara, 2017; Teng et al., 2017; Trapczynski and Gorynia, 2017). Our findings extend this literature by demonstrating that the magnitude of the negative impact of institutional distance on MNE subsidiary performance is conditional on the TMT’s work experience. Our findings are of particular importance for MNE subsidiaries’ staffing strategies. Specifically, our findings suggest that MNE’s consider recruiting mangers for their subsidiaries with host country work experience. Furthermore, MNE should consider recruiting in order to achieve greater diversity of international work experience among the TMT of their subsidiaries. Our results are congruent with the extant literature which has identified that MNEs are less likely to staff their subsidiaries with expatriates mangers when institutional distance between the home and host country is large (Abugre et al., 2020; Chao and Kumar, 2010; Rickley and Karim, 2018). However, our findings differ from the work of Abugre et al. (2020) and Rickley and Karim (2018) both of whom directly investigated the effect of institutional distance on staffing of expatriates in MNE subsidiaries. In contrast, we investigated the indirect effect of expatriates in the TMT on their management of the institutional distance and how this impacts MNE subsidiary performance. We identified that expatriates are not fit for managing the institutional distance and conquering the liability of foreignness, and this will increase the negative impact institutional distance has on MNE subsidiary performance.\n\nWe found that the moderation effect of expatriates with the home country experience on institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance is only weakly supported in our main analysis and not supported in the robustness check. Theoretically, an explanation for this finding is that the extent of the negative impact of institutional distance on MNE subsidiary performance is confounded by how well expatriates can adjust to the host country work environment (Abugre et al., 2020). MNEs can minimise expatriate failure by providing cross-culture training or a comprehensive overseas expatriate support system (Petison and Johri, 2008). If the expatriate managers can adapt well to the new physical, social and cultural environment, they will integrate better, have greater employee voice (Hosseini et al., 2022) and feel more confident, competent and motivated in working overseas. As a result, there will be less hindrance from the expatriate managers to manage the liability of foreignness. Our findings suggest that if expatriates can adapt to their host country work environment avoiding expatriate failure, then the negative impact which institutional distance has on MNE subsidiary performance will be significantly attenuated.\n\nWe also investigated the moderation effect of TMT’s host, as opposed to home, country work experience. Our findings here also resonate with and supplement the previous literature in this area which demonstrates that host country experience reduces the negative impact institutional distance has on MNE subsidiary performance. Previous studies investigated the moderator of firm level host country experience (Gaur and Lu, 2007; Quer et al., 2019; Shirodkar and Konara, 2017). Our findings supplement previous work in this area by looking at the individual level moderator of TMT host country work experience. The results confirm that host country experience equips managers with the enhanced ability to manage the liabilities of foreignness derived from institutional distance.\n\nIn addition to the findings of TMT’s host and home country work experience, we also confirmed our assertion that the negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance is conditional on the diversity of the TMT’s international work experience, such that the more diverse the TMT’s international work experience, the weaker the negative relationship. Previous research by Belderbos et al. (2022) and Miller et al. (2016) identified that diversity in TMT’s international work experience positively impacts MNE subsidiary performance. Our work adds to this by revealing a positive moderation effect of diversity of TMT’s international experience on the negative relationship between institutional distance-MNE subsidiary performance. We also present novel findings on the differential effects of TMT’s international work experience, specifically differences between experience gained in markets with strong institutions compared to experience gained in markets with weak institutions. Empirically, we found that TMT managers’ international work experience, especially work experience gained in the weak-institution markets, mitigates the negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance. An interpretation of this finding is that MNEs with TMT managers who have more experience in markets with weak institutions are more capable of navigating weak institution environments and dealing with adverse and uncertain situations (Ramamurti, 2009). These TMT managers are required to be innovative in circumventing the institutional voids and developing institutional capabilities that their MNEs can leverage to optimise performance across-borders (Carney et al., 2016).\n\nContributions\n\nThis study makes three main contributions to the international business and the TMT literature by examining how the TMT moderates the institutional distance-subsidiary performance relationship. First and foremost, theoretically, we have applied upper echelon theory in a novel way to interpret the moderation effect of micro-level TMT international experiences on the macro-level institutional distance and subsidiary performance relationship. TMT’s international work experience shapes managers’ cognitive maps which influences the way they perceive and interpret institutional distance. Whilst previous studies on the moderation effects of firm characteristics on institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance have been based on macro-level analysis (e.g., Gaur and Lu, 2007; Shirodkar and Konara, 2017), our study of the same moderation effect is based on the micro-level analysis of TMT managers’ characteristics.\n\nSecond, our study reveals how different TMT’s characteristics increase or decrease the negative effect of institutional distance on MNE subsidiary performance and our results provide practical implications for MNE subsidiaries’ staffing strategies.\n\nThird, our study also contributes to the TMT international experience literature. It does this in three ways. First, we look at the moderation effect of TMT’s work experience theoretically from two important mechanisms that are subsidiary legitimacy building and strategic organisational practices transfer (Xu and Shenkar, 2002). Second, whilst previous work focuses on one aspect of TMT’s work experience (Belderbos et al., 2022; Vallone et al., 2022), we have adopted a more comprehensive approach by including home, host and international work experience. Third, we extend the TMT literature in international business by examining more contextual features of TMT managers’ experience obtained from different institutional environments, i.e., strong versus weak and multiple as opposed to singular institutional environments (Georgakakis et al., 2016; Mohr and Batsakis, 2019).\n\nFinally, our work has managerial implications. We identified that TMT managers who gained work experience in weak-institution markets, as opposed to strong-institution markets, are associated with a greater mitigating effect on the negative relationship between institutional distance and MNE subsidiary performance. This finding therefore suggests that for staffing foreign subsidiaries MNE should seek to employ managers with work experience gained in weak-institution environments, over those with experience gained in strong-institution environments, as the former are likely to be more skilled at managing institutional distance.\n\nLimitations and future research\n\nThe focus of this research is the moderating effect of TMT managers’ work experience on the institutional distance-subsidiary performance relationship. Therefore, we simply look at institutional distance as a abstract construct. Future research should explore the complexity of institutions and distinguish different institutional contexts (Jackson and Deeg, 2008). The abstract construct of institutional distance is criticised for lost dimensionality and assumed symmetry (Zaheer et al., 2012). Different dimensions of institutional distance and the directions of institutional distance have been gaining growing attention (Gama et al., 2016; Hernandez et al., 2018). We outline below the potential to revisit this relationship in the following ways.\n\nTheoretically, a thicker view of institutional contexts is called for in international business, and comparative capitalism offers the opportunity to look at how particular kinds of institutional configurations influence particular kinds of MNE activities (Jackson and Deeg, 2019). Our study could be extended from a comparative capitalism perspective to breakdown the institutional distance in a more context-specific manner. For example, Fortwengel (2017) argues the particular combination of different dimensions of institutional distance, including coordination, strength, thickness and resources, will actually translate into behaviours involving MNEs overcoming institutional distance. In addition to the dimensionality, the direction of institutional distance whether positive or negative, should also be considered (Hernandez et al., 2018).\n\nMethodologically, further research can explore how TMT managers’ international experience influence their management of different dimensions of institutional distance, and institutional distance with different directions. Furthermore, longitudinal data would be conducive to revealing more information about how the institutional distance between two countries changes over time and how the TMT’s international background influences their management of institutional distance over time.\n\nIn addition to quantitative research methods, qualitative research methods such as multiple case studies and qualitative comparative analysis offer the possibility to study the moderation effect of TMT on the institutional distance and subsidiary performance relationship in novel ways. These qualitative approaches would enable the contextualisation of insights into the conditions when MNEs can overcome institutional distance (Fortwengel, 2017). Identifying the interaction effects between these context-specific conditions of institutional distance and TMT characteristics will lead to fruitful theoretical and empirical results."
