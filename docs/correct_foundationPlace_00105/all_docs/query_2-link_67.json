        "text": "On Wednesday, Russian prosecutors requested a 4-year prison sentence for activist Gleb Kalinychev in a court hearing in Nizhny Novgorod. He is charged with donating $21.9 to Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK). In September, Kalinychev was arrested on charges of “financing an extremist organization,” and police raided his family's apartments. The prosecutors accuse Kalinychev of transferring donations of $2 to FBK's accounts in 2021-2022. Alexei Navalny's FBK was declared an extremist organization in 2021. FBK and all persons associated with it were subjected to severe repression. Alexei Navalny, founder of the organization, head of the opposition, and prominent critic of Putin, was killed while serving his 19-year sentence on “extremism” charges. HRF demands the immediate release of Kalinychev and all activists illegally detained by Putin's regime. https://buff.ly/3ylETlR\n\nHong Kong pro-democracy tycoon Jimmy Lai will testify in his defense this November after the court dismissed his bid to drop his national security case. Lai’s lawyer contended that the prosecution’s evidence was insufficient to warrant a case. Lai, the founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, faces two counts of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and one count of conspiring to publish seditious materials. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, but a conviction could result in a life sentence. The 76-year-old British citizen has been held in solitary confinement since 2020, enduring multiple trial delays. Initially set for 2022, his trial only began in December 2023 and has now been adjourned to November. Cases under the National Security Law lack transparency and are heard by courts that are not independent. Hong Kong courts have continued to unduly delay Lai's case and make an example of him. HRF expresses grave concern over Lai’s health due to his prolonged imprisonment and prosecution and continues to call for his immediate and unconditional release. https://buff.ly/3SluzB6\n\nOn July 19, Bangladeshi journalist A.T.M. Turab was killed by police gunfire while covering the recent student protests. As students protested controversial quotas for public jobs, violence escalated between students, police, and journalists reporting on-site. Turab is the second journalist to be killed. Earlier, Hasan Mehedi, a journalist with Dhaka Times, was also killed while reporting on the protests. Dozens of journalists were assaulted and injured, with some being beaten or shot by the police. As the crackdown on protests intensified, journalists reporting on-site were targeted. Some were attacked by counter-protesters aligned with the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of the ruling Awami League Party. HRF calls for an independent and thorough investigation into the killing of A.T.M. Turab and Hasan Mehedi. HRF also calls on Bangladesh to ensure the safety of journalists while reporting.\n\nOn Monday, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al Sudani called for “unifying efforts” to tackle the trafficking and consumption of illegal drugs in the Middle East. In Iraq, the most widely used drug is crystal methamphetamine, followed by Captagon. Iraq has increased operations aimed at curbing drug smuggling and trafficking. From 2019 to 2023, Captagon seizures increased by 3.38%. In 2023, officials seized more than 4.1 tons of Captagon tablets, worth between $84 million and $144 million. Iraq is the nexus of the world’s major trafficking routes, serving as a critical proxy for drug smugglers. Captagon is primarily produced in Syria, serving as a crucial source of funds for dictator Bashar al-Assad. The drug is used by extremist militant groups like ISIS for its stimulant effects. Captagon keeps fighters awake, giving them “a sense of invincibility.” Officials attempting to curb drug smuggling and consumption have been assassinated. In 2022, Judge Ahmed Faisal Khasaf, who specialized in drug cases, was shot in his car. As methamphetamine, which is more potent and addictive than Captagon, trafficking increases in Iraq, Arab governments must adjust their drug policies and collaborate to curb the ongoing crisis.\n\nOn Sunday, Iranian ambassador Hassan Shah Hossenei was welcomed in Sudan by the army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, restoring diplomatic ties for the first time in eight years. Iran continues to supply Sudan’s army with weapons and drones against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The move comes as Sudan’s army struggles to gain an advantage against the RSF in the over-year-long war that has displaced 10 million. Access to its 400-mile Red Sea coastline remains a strategic interest for actors like the UAE, Iran, Turkey, China, and Russia. Extensive war crimes are being committed between the army and the RSF, with the latter committing ethnic cleansing in West Darfur against the Masalit people. The UN estimates that between 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed in the city of El-Geneina in West Darfur in 2023. HRF grieves the loss of innocent lives in Sudan and condemns the continued funding of the war by outside actors. It calls for an immediate ceasefire and urges the international community to increase humanitarian aid to the region and spotlight the humanitarian crisis.\n\nToday, #Uganda’s security forces raided a hotel in the capital, Kampala, where youth civic groups were scheduled to hold a press conference, a day after the regime’s crackdown on the #March2Parliament protest against public corruption. Security forces arrested an unknown number of people on the premises of Hotel Eliana in Ntinda, a Kampala suburb. A public prosecutor charged activists Ruth Nalunkuma, Abigail Kalenda, and Denis Pate of the youth civil group @vijanacorps with unlawful assembly. They are due for a hearing on Thursday. The three activists join more than 50 people detained and charged with common nuisance in connection to the #March2Parliament protest. HRF condemns #Uganda’s raid and arrest of the #March2Parliament youth activists. The move illustrates the regime’s fear of the democratic aspirations among its population. HRF calls for the immediate release of Ruth Nalunkuma, Abigail Kalenda, Denis Pate, and all those arbitrarily detained for peacefully exercising their constitutional rights to expression and assembly.\n\nOn July 22, police in Equatorial Guinea detained prominent poet and opposition figure Francisco Ballovera Estrada as he attempted to deliver food and water to those arrested for protesting environmental crimes on #Annobón island. Estrada is a leader of the main opposition party in Equatorial Guinea, a well-known literary figure, and a prominent voice for Annobón culture. He is detained without charge in the capital, Malabo. Estrada’s detention comes amid a wave of arrests targeting citizens from #Annobón on suspicion of links with the island’s pro-independence political movement. HRF calls for the immediate release of Francisco Ballovera Estrada and all citizens arbitrarily detained in connection to the peaceful protests on #Annobón island."
