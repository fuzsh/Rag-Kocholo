        "text": "Away league match played on 10 September 2016.\n\nKicked off at 2:30 PM\n\nA sluggish start yet again from Pegasus Reserves made the opening 15 minutes a bit of a nightmare for both teams. Neither could get started and struggled gaining any sort of control of the play. The breakthrough came in 18 minutes when Colin Thow was played through 1 on 1 and unselfishly played the ball across the keeper for Vadim to tap the ball into an empty net to make it 0-1. The dominance then started from Pegasus Reserves and some great play was on show creating a hat full of chances from the flanks, however none of these found the back of the net. 35 minutes on the clock seen the second goal added after Arron McGinty played a clever pass into the box for Colin Thow to tap the ball in to make it 0-2. 1 minute later a third was added after Colin Thow gave the ball to Andy Silley on the edge of the 18 yard box, who then ran past a couple of defenders and unleashed a lobbed cross/shot which left the keeper with no chance. 0-3. Sean Porch then picked up an ankle injury and was replaced by Lee Sinclair. 5 minutes later Pegasus Reserves sent a free kick into the Park Rovers penalty box which found Hoggy who flicked the ball with a header to the path of Colin Thow who made no mistake 6 yards out and slotted in his second of the match to make it 0-4. Right on the stroke of Half Time Colin Thow kept his cool in a 1 on 1 situation and completed his well deserved Hat Trick to make it 0-5 going in to HT.\n\nNo changes were made at HT and the second half began with one way traffic yet again. Thainy played a defence splitting pass into Colin Thow 55 minutes in and he continued his dominance in front of goal to score his 4th of the match and Pegasus Reserves 6th. Complacency began to set in to the Pegasus lads and the final 3 changes were made, which seen Paul Wright, Allan Scott and Scott Brady introduced for Arron McGinty, Jack Rosborough and Vadim Becs to freshen things up. The standard then dropped and it became really scrappy with Park Rovers beginning to create a host of half chances but none clinical enough to find the back of the net. Pegasus Reserves tempo dropped and they moved down 2 or 3 gears to gift Park Rovers a corner after hesistancy between Scott Porch and Jonny. The corner wasnt dealt with and the opposing striker tapped the ball in to make it 1-6 in the 77th minute. 2 minutes later Colin Thow yet again found himself in the right place at the right time and scored his 5th of the match to make it 1-7. The final goal of the match came in the 84th minute when Jonny Crawford made an absolutely howler of a dummy which fell right in the path of the Park Rovers player, who rolled the ball into an empty net. Final Score - 2-7.\n\nA fantastic response from the Pegasus Reserve lads to clinch the first 3 points of the season in style. Yet again defensive errors gifting goals, something that will need to be addressed and worked on. But there was no taking away the graft and quality before hand which seen Pegasus Reserves completely destroy Kettering Park Rovers for large parts of the game. Credit to all 15 lads involved today. MOM was Colin Thow, 5 goals and 2 assists make it an easy choice this week. Roll on next week where Pegasus Reserves host Daventry Drayton Grange at home."
