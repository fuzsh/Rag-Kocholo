        "text": "The most recent data we have available indicates that this area is fairly densely populated, with 2337 people living in the neighbourhood.\n\nWhile population density on its own doesn't mean a huge deal, a fairly densely populated area might mean that you're more likely to experience issues like noise or congestion caused by local traffic. However, it also might mean that key services and facilities are more accessible, located where the largest number of people can reach them.\n\nData released by the government each year indicates that this part of Kettering is, statistically, one of poorer scoring areas when it comes to official government deprivation figures\n\nThis information is modelled on the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, a national dataset compiled by the department for Communities and Local Government. This ranks neighbourhoods from ‘best’ to ‘worst’ across a number of criteria including access to employment, life expectancy, income and health. While this might be a simplistic way of viewing things, there is a strong relationship between an area’s IMD ranking and its desirability as a place to live.\n\nData released by the government each year indicates that this part of Kettering is, statistically, one of poorer scoring areas when it comes to official government deprivation figures\n\nThis information is modelled on the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, a national dataset compiled by the department for Communities and Local Government.
