A world-renowned pancreatic cancer pathology expert, his areas of clinical expertise include pancreatic cancer and its precursors, neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and pancreatic pathology.\n\nHis research contributions include the characterization of PanINs, the precursor lesions that give rise to invasive pancreatic cancer.\n\nDr. Hruban is the Baxley Professor and Director of the Department of Pathology. He also serves as director of the Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at Johns Hopkins and is a member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\nAfter receiving an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago and a medical degree from Johns Hopkins, Dr. Hruban continued his residency training in anatomic pathology at Johns Hopkins.
