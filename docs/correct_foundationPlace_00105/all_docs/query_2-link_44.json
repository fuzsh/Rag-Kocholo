        "text": "7 min read\n\nFor Prelims: Pegasus spyware, Zero-click and Zero-day vulnerabilities, National Cyber Security Strategy, Cyber Surakshit Bharat\n\nFor Mains: Spyware and Privacy Concerns, Cyber Attacks, Government Initiatives\n\nSource: TH\n\nWhy in News?\n\nThe Pegasus spyware has once again ignited a debate on privacy and security. Recent reports by Amnesty International point to its utilization in targeting the phones of two prominent Indian journalists, prompting inquiries into potential government involvement.\n\nAmnesty International is a global movement of more than 10 million people who are committed to creating a future where human rights are enjoyed by everyone.\n\nWhat is Pegasus Spyware?\n\nAbout:\n\nPegasus spyware is a highly invasive mobile surveillance tool that can secretly infiltrate and monitor smartphones, collecting data and information from various apps and sources.\n\nIt was developed by the Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group, which claims to sell it only to government agencies for fighting crime and terrorism.\n\nNSO emphasizes mechanisms in place to avoid targeting journalists, lawyers, and human rights defenders not involved in terror or serious crimes.\n\nOperating Procedure:\n\nPegasus uses “zero-click” methods to infect devices; it is a malicious software that allows spyware to be installed on a device without the device owner’s consent.\n\nThe spyware doesn't necessitate any user actions for installation, distinguishing it from regular apps that require explicit user confirmation.\n\nIt can exploit vulnerabilities in apps such as WhatsApp, iMessage, or FaceTime, and send a message or a call that triggers the installation of the spyware, even if the user does not open or answer it.\n\nPegasus is a spyware that can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities to deploy spyware on Apple products.\n\nA zero-day vulnerability is an undiscovered flaw or bug in an operating system that the mobile phone’s manufacturer does not yet know about and so has not been able to fix.\n\nTargets:\n\nSeveral investigations and reports have revealed that Pegasus spyware has been used to spy on journalists, human rights activists, lawyers, opposition leaders, and heads of state.\n\nSome of the countries that have been accused of using Pegasus spyware to target their critics and enemies include Saudi Arabia, Mexico, India, Morocco, Hungary, Azerbaijan, and Rwanda.\n\nImplications:\n\nPegasus spyware threatens privacy and security for individuals and groups exposing corruption, defending human rights, and advocating democracy.\n\nIt undermines press freedom by exposing journalists' sources, methods, and materials, compromising their independence.\n\nThe spyware poses a risk to the sovereignty and stability of nations, enabling foreign interference and espionage in internal affairs and decision-making processes.\n\nChallenges:\n\nPegasus spyware is difficult to detect and remove, as it can hide its presence and activity on the device, and can self-destruct if it senses that it is being discovered or analyzed.\n\nPegasus spyware is difficult to regulate and control due to its operation in legal grey areas.\n\nNSO Group and its clients commonly deny or evade responsibility for the misuse and abuse of spyware.\n\nMajor Types of Cyber Threats\n\nWhat are the Related Cybersecurity Initiatives?\n\nIndia:\n\nInformation Technology Act, 2000.\n\nNational Cyber Security Strategy.\n\nCyber Surakshit Bharat.\n\nComputer Emergency Response Team - India (CERT-In).\n\nCritical Information Infrastructure.\n\nIndian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C).\n\nInternational Mechanisms:\n\nInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n\nBudapest Convention on Cybercrime\n\nWay Forward\n\nEstablish an international oversight mechanism to hold companies accountable for any unethical use of surveillance tools and facilitate independent audits.\n\nStrengthen national and international legal frameworks to explicitly address the use of spyware and protect the privacy and human rights of individuals targeted.\n\nConduct public awareness campaigns to educate individuals about the risks posed by spyware and how to safeguard their devices against potential infiltration.\n\nStrengthen national cybersecurity infrastructure to proactively detect and neutralize cyber threats, including the continuous monitoring of potential spyware activities.\n\nEncourage tech companies to adopt ethical guidelines that align with human rights principles, promoting responsible corporate behaviour.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination, Previous Year Question (PYQ)\n\nPrelims\n\nQ.
