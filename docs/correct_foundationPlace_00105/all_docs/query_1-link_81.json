        "text": "Households and businesses undertaking removals to Northamptonshire will be looking for removal companies with a good knowledge of the region. Based in East Anglia, Hamiltons organises many moves to the county each year, both for people moving within the local area and those from elsewhere in the UK or abroad. We can arrange your relocation to Northampton, Kettering, Wellingborough, Corby, Daventry, Rushden, Desborough, Oundle, Brackley or any other town or village in the county.\n\nMoving to Northamptonshire\n\nNorthamptonshire has a population of around 630,000, but is one of England's fastest-growing areas, so this number is rising quickly. Major investment is being made in the area under government growth schemes. One reason for moving to Northamptonshire is commuting to London, while another is to work for the wide range of employers based within the county itself. Quality of life is yet another attraction.\n\nLondon Commuting: The rise in property prices within London has seen many people deciding to move out and commute. Northamptonshire is an increasingly popular location for commuters because it has good fast rail links to the capital, but housing prices here are well below those in Greater London. The North Northamptonshire Development Corporation even at one time advertised its area as \"North Londonshire\".\n\nEmployment - Northamptonshire has one of the highest rates of employment anywhere in Britain. One reason for this is the county's good accessibility, with major roads such as the M1 and A14 meaning that it is well-positioned for people to travel from all areas of the country, including the neighbouring counties of Cambridgeshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire. This has led to it being a hub for logistics firms and other major businesses. The county's motorsport industry is another important area of employment.\n\nQuality of Life - South Northamptonshire recently came near the top of a national survey for areas with the best quality of life in Britain. It is being hailed for its schools and beautiful rural villages, as well as good health and life expectancy. Factors like these make the area attractive to people wanting to move out of London on retirement.\n\nA Look at the Main Areas of Northamptonshire\n\nNorthampton and South Northamptonshire\n\nNorthampton, the county town, is by far the largest settlement in Northampton, with a population of more than 212,000. The town is expected to see major growth in both housing and jobs over the coming years, with a number of regeneration schemes under way. In a recent national survey, Northampton was named as one of the top UK locations for business.\n\nThe town was known historically for its footwear companies, and there are still some shoemakers based there. However, today's major employers in the area are now in more varied fields, such as financial companies like Barclaycard, the Nationwide Building Society and iPsl Financial Services, and retailers like Avon and Travis Perkins. Many people also work for the University of Northampton, which has more than 14,000 students. Villages on the outskirts of the town include Kislingbury, Harpole, Rothersthorpe, Collingtree and Hardingstone.\n\nTo the south of the town, South Northamptonshire is known for its beautiful countryside, fields and forests. The biggest settlements are the small market towns of Brackley and Towcester, while villages in the area include Middleton Cheney, Bugbrooke, Deanshanger and Helmdon. Another village, Silverstone, has given its name to the world-famous racing circuit, on the border with Buckinghamshire, which is a major employer and a hub for motor sport firms.\n\nWest and North Northamptonshire\n\nTo the west of the county, a large rural area surrounds Daventry, a fast-growing market town. It has many historic buildings in its centre, with expanding modern housing areas in the outer areas. The diesel engineering firm Cummins is a major employer, while the Daventry International Rail Freight terminal is also a centre for employment. The main villages in the Daventry district are Brixworth, Long Buckby and Weedon.\n\nTo the north, Kettering is one of Northamptonshire's main towns, with a population of more than 80,000. As well as being close to Leicestershire, it is only an hour from London by train, meaning that it has become attractive to commuters moving to Northamptonshire. It has a high proportion of residents in work, with the main employers based locally including Weetabix, Tresham College and Pegasus Software. Many service and distribution companies also have premises in Kettering Business Park. Other towns in the Kettering region include Desborough, Rothwell and Burton Latimer.\n\nKettering is in a growth area in the north of the county, as are Wellingborough and Corby. Wellingborough has around 50,000 people, but thousands of new homes are being built to the east in the Stanton Cross development. Corby, a \"new town\"of the 1950s, has a population of around 61,000, and is also growing fast. Both towns have strong engineering traditions, and are also increasingly popular with commuters because of their rail links to London. Other communities in the northern area include Weldon, Bozeat and Wollaston.\n\nEast Northamptonshire\n\nThe east of the county shares borders with Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire, and is known for its attractive countryside and large wooded areas. This part of the county has many attractive villages and a number of small towns, with the largest of these being Rushden, together with the neighbouring Higham Ferrers. Between them, these two market towns have a population of around 37,000.\n\nThe ancient market town of Oundle is known for its medieval streets and historic buildings, as well as its famous school, which is one of the largest independent boarding schools in Britain. The luxury yacht builder Fairline Boats is a major employer in the area. Other towns and villages in the east of the county include Thrapston, Raunds, Irthlingborough and Easton on the Hill.\n\nIf you are arranging removals to Northamptonshire and need to find house movers with an expert knowledge of the area, contact Hamiltons now for a free quote."
