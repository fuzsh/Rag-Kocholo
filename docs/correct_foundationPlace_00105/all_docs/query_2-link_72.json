        "text": "Background\n\nThere is a growing marketplace of private spyware firms developing and selling sophisticated surveillance technologies to governments around the world. This multi-billion dollar industry is not yet meaningfully constrained by international regulations and is helping to facilitate physical violence, reinforce authoritarianism, and support political repression. From Pegasus spyware targeting human rights activists to malware targeting the Ukrainian infrastructure, these attacks affect every area of our lives and underscore the magnitude of the risks we all face – and the need for a global field of civil society organizations advancing threat research, advocacy, and accountability.\n\nThe Ford Foundation’s Dignity and Justice Fund, fiscally sponsored by the New Venture Fund, has launched a new funding initiative for spyware accountability with a founding contribution from Apple and additional contributions from Open Society Foundations, Okta for Good, and Craig Newmark Philanthropies, and more donors are expected to join over the course of the initiative. The funding initiative will last for at least the next five years and will primarily support civil society organizations working to investigate, expose, and prevent spyware and help bring accountability to global trade in surveillance technologies.\n\nThe funding initiative will deploy grants in several different ways, including through direct invitations to leading organizations modeled on the Ford Foundation’s Technology and Society grantmaking practice. The funding initiative may also run additional open requests for proposals (such as this one), as well as support convenings, research, communications, and other shared field infrastructure.\n\nWe know this work has real-life consequences for civil society. In recent years state and non-state actors have used spyware to track and intimidate human rights defenders, political dissidents, and environmental activists in virtually every region of the world. And every day these threats broaden and deepen. The Citizen Lab and Amnesty Tech first publicly spotlighted NSO Group, a major player in the mercenary surveillance industry. That company’s Pegasus spyware has been used in some of the most insidious attacks on human rights defenders. Researchers have linked Pegasus to hundreds of acts of physical violence. And it’s not just one company or piece of software - commercial spyware is a lucrative and growing industry. This new funding initiative will support a range of strategies toward effective accountability for the trade and use of spyware.\n\nThis initiative will be making grants for work on spyware accountability, and this is our first open call for concept notes. We invite concept notes from civil society organizations, journalists, and others who are looking to build and sustain their capacity to engage on this critical issue.\n\nScope\n\nThe goal of the Spyware Accountability Initiative (SAI) is to address the harms of the global spyware industry on civil society through regulation, litigation, research and investigation, and other means to ensure that governments and corporations cannot use spyware to harm or unjustly surveil the civil society organizations that aim to keep them in check.\n\nSAI’s funding strategy will evolve over time. For this round of funding, we invite proposals to help build and sustain the capacity of organizations working on spyware accountability. This is a broad remit and future rounds of funding may be more targeted.\n\nAreas of work that may qualify for funding include:\n\nThreat intelligence and research capabilities focused on cyberweapons used offensively against civil society and social movements.\n\nBuilding the organizational capacity of both existing and emergent civil society cybersecurity research and advocacy groups, and increasing field coordination.\n\nBuilding the capacity of human rights defenders and journalists - individuals, organizations, and networks - to identify and respond to spyware attacks.\n\nCoordinated sharing of information, research, and best practices to confront advanced threats among response organizations.\n\nAdvocacy or litigation strategies and interventions focused on the global spyware trade, use of advanced cyberweapons against civil society, and accountability of corporations responsible for the proliferation of these technologies.\n\nIncreasing awareness among investors, journalists, policymakers, and the general public about the global mercenary spyware industry.\n\nEnabling civil society to more effectively partner with device manufacturers, software developers, commercial security firms, and other relevant companies to identify and address vulnerabilities as well as the design and implementation of protections that directly address the risks and harms of spyware.\n\nImplementation, management, and use of technical infrastructure that takes advantage of threat intelligence to identify and contain targeted incidents, and that facilitate the sharing of intelligence across the field.\n\nInvestigation into, and support for the harms and consequences of, spyware. This may include: developing psychosocial support programs for high-risk individuals and organizations, understanding the longer-term harms that are experienced by individuals and organizations following targeted spyware attacks, and researching the impact of spyware technologies on democratic societies.\n\nSupport for additional safety and security measures directly related to proposed work in any of the areas of work listed above.\n\nWhat is not being considered for this round of funding:\n\nNew end-user technology development (e.g., new secure messaging applications)\n\nGeneral training or capacity building that is not focused on countering spyware or targeted surveillance.\n\nTo submit a concept note, please click \"Respond\" and fill out the form. You are also welcome to upload supplemental materials but please ensure that the most important information in your proposal is included in the written answers as we cannot guarantee a review of all supplemental material. We strive to keep the concept note submission short as we anticipate a large number of responses. Applicants that move forward will be asked to provide additional information such as a full proposal.\n\nConcept notes will be reviewed by a committee that includes the technical advisory council for SAI. New Venture Fund will make final grantmaking decisions based on recommendations from the Ford Foundation.\n\nThe final number of grants and grant amounts will depend on a variety of factors. We anticipate funding 10-20 proposals at $50,000-$200,000 each. Grant terms may be from 12 to 24 months. These ranges are subject to change. You are welcome to indicate flexibility around your budgets or timelines in your submission. Grants must be directly related to the work in the aforementioned scope and may be requested as project-specific, core, or general support."
