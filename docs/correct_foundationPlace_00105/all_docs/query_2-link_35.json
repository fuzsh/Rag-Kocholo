presidente de México, de Enrique Peña Nieto, y de su familia, que no podían explicar.\n\nQue desde luego no podía haber obtenido el presidente con los ingresos que el presidente pudo haber tenido como presidente, como gobernador o como hijo de una familia de clase media.\n\n♪ ♪ Es que yo sospecho que mi teléfono está intervenido y el teléfono de mi hijo Emilio está intervenido es cuando Emilio, un chico menor de edad, me pregunta: \"¿Oye, mamá, eh, tú sabes por qué recibo estos mensajes tan extraños?\"\n\nY yo le digo: \"Yo también estoy recibiendo mensajes extraños.\"\n\n♪ ♪ (chattering indistinctly) Que hicieras clic para ver algún problema de tu visa en Estados Unidos.\n\n>> Claro, claro, claro, ¿qué puede estar mal con tu visa, no?\n\n>> CARMEN: Sí, pero era imposible que no hicieras clic.\n\n>> A ver, yo veía mi visa y decía, pues que vigencia tiene... tiene.\n\nFuera de la vigencia, ¿qué problema puede tener?\n\nPero, sabe, es algo que es inevitable, que hagas un clic.\n\n>> Que les piques.\n\nSabemos que Pegasus se vendió a la Procuraduría General de la República, se vendió Pegasus al Ejército, se vendió Pegasus al CISEN, al Sistema de Inteligencia, se vendió Pegasus a algunas instancias de caracter publico.\n\n>> SOURCE (voice distorted): No puedo decirles mi nombre.\n\nNo puedo referir con exactitud la institución en la cual me desempeñé.\n\nY puede resultar peligroso para mí la identificación y el conocimiento de que yo tengo o tuve acceso a cierta información.\n\nEl sistema Pegasus, pues era toda una novedad para nosotros.\n\nEl procedimiento era tener el número objetivo, hacer lo que se denominaba la ingeniería social, que es búsqueda de información en fuentes abiertas del objetivo con la finalidad de elaborar mensajes de texto que pudieran ser enviados al dispositivo móvil.\n\nDebiera ser uno o dos intentos muy precisos con información que le resultara útil al objetivo y que este pudiera dar clic.\n\nSi lográbamos el éxito de que diera clic en el mensaje, eso automáticamente instalaba el software en el equipo móvil, y a partir de ahí, ya podíamos tener acceso al teléfono, a toda la información.\n\nLos resultados, pues, eran increíbles porque una vez que se lograba instalar infectar el dispositivo, se tenía acceso pleno al equipo móvil.\n\nEra una pantalla negra.\n\nEn la parte superior izquierda teníamos la visualización principal y en la parte del lado derecho y abajo estaban, digamos, módulos o pestañas en donde se tenía cada una de las aplicaciones de las que se extraía información.\n\nPor ejemplo, teníamos el cuadro de la aplicación de WhatsApp, Telegram.\n\nAbajo teníamos los micrófonos, el micrófono, las cámaras, la geolocalización y dependiendo de lo que nos interesara, le dábamos clic y era lo que se proyectaba en la visualización principal.\n\nA partir de la infección cualquier información que sea eliminad podemos verla nosotros.\n\nY a sea en fotos o conversaciones.\n\nPero podemos seguir viéndolas.\n\n>> CARMEN: Cuando empiezas a saber qué cosa es Pegasus, te vas de espaldas.\n\nQuedas desnudo frente a un poder que no sabes quién detenta.\n\nQuedas vulnerable frente a alguien que está observándote bajo una lupa.\n\nPueden estar contigo en la oficina, en la regadera, en la cocina con un amigo, con una fuente.\n\nTodo el tiempo.\n\n♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ >> All the time during this investigation, we tried every day to identify the person behind that phone number.\n\n(indistinct phone chatter) This is what all the partners in Forbidden's team were doing most of the time.\n\n>> Basically, the consortium had access to a list of potential targets.\n\n>> Exactly.\n\nTo be sure that you was indeed infected or surveilled, we would have to run forensic analysis.\n\n>> (gently): Of course, of course.\n\n(sighs) >> I saw one number in the list that belonged to a friend, a journalist in Azerbaijan.\n\n>> Her name is Khadija Ismayilova.\n\nShe's an award-winning investigative reporter and an outspoken critic of the government, renowned for her exposés of corruption at the hands of the country's president.\n\n>> Azerbaijan, you have a lot of oil and gas.\n\nIt's a dictatorship.\n\nAnd the dictator's name is Ilham Aliyev.\n\nAnd this person and this state is extremely violent against dissidents, political opponents, journalists.\n\n>> I first met Khadija Ismayilova in Azerbaijan in about 2006, 2007.\n\nKhadija Ismayilova relentlessly kept on exposing the wrongdoing and the corruption of the Aliyev regime.\n\nShe showed how, you know, they were having their hands into a big chunk of the Azerbaijani economy.\n\nShe was showing how they were, you know, taking money in a covert way, how they were stealing money, basically, from the people.\n\n>> (speaking Azerbaijani): (shouting) >> She kept on doing what she was doing.\n\nAnd she got arrested.\n\nShe got thrown behind bars.\n\nAfter all this investigating reporting, Khadija became a prime target for the government in Baku and for the Aliyevs.\n\n>> I don't know how to, to proceed with Khadija, because I don't want us to put Khadija in danger.\n\nThe thing that is quite difficult is how to get in touch with Khadija without communicating on electronic device.\n\n>> This is very sensitive, right?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> This is very, very sensitive, especially for her, because she's basically on probation.\n\nThat's gonna be a risk anyway.\n\n>> We learned that Khadija was about to go to Turkey for some personal reasons, and so we set up immediately a team who went to Turkey to meet Khadija once she landed in the airport.\n\n♪ ♪ >> Now, I'm nervous.\n\n(chuckles) >> I'm nervous too.\n\nI cannot stand still.\n\n>> (sighs) There she is.\n\n>> Khadija!\n\n(laughs) >> So many years!\n\n(indistinct chatter) (indistinct chatter) >> It's a good size.\n\n>> We can take these off, right?\n\n>> So we have about 1,000 numbers from Azerbaijan and you're among them.\n\n>> Oh!\n\n>> And then we also have some people who are your friends.\n\n> Okay, and what does that program do?\n\n>> So what the program does is, it basically, without you knowing, um, it installs things on your phone.\n\n>> (bleep) >> And then it allows... >> Even if I didn't click on anything?\n\n>> Yes, so the secrecy of this, it's called Pegasus, and the secrecy of it is that you don't actually see or you don't do anything.\n\nSo before, you had to click on something, to be infected.\n\nIn this case, it all happens in the background, and you have no idea that you are infected.\n\n>> (bleep) >> And when you're infected, it's transmitting your messages your images, everything that's happening on your phone, including on signal, because they have the phone itself.\n\n>> And it's legal to sell it?\n\n>> Yes, so what we know is that most likely, sometimes in 2018, the government got it.\n\n>> Okay.\n\n>> And we have a lot of data from 2019.\n\nAnd, you know, that was a big year of protest.\n\nYou were on a hunger strike with other people.\n\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\nYou guys had a woman march.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> You were leading the march.\n\n>> (quietly): (bleep) (laughs) >> It's... kind of the most, like, in the country.\n\nSo one way for us to verify that, you know, what exactly, you know, was done in your case would be to do forensic on your phone.\n\n>> Yes, why not?\n\nIs there any way to avoid this surveillance?\n\n>> Yes, we will set you up with a new device that you will be able to use.\n\n>> And a phone.\n\n>> Is there a balcony?\n\n>> ...be some way, you know, to do it like...\n\nThere are other ways to communicate.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\nIt's like...\n\nIt makes you to want to live in the bubble.\n\nBut then, like, so no one can enter.\n\nLike, in some sort of...
