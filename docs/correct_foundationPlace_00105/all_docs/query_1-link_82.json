If you want to deal with proper lawyers who are friendly and approachable, our team can help you.\n\nYou will have a direct line straight through to your legal team, and direct email addresses. You can guarantee that your query will reach the right people, whether you want to ask about search fees in Kettering , drainage and water fees in Northamptonshire or something else.\n\n\"The team always provided me with clear, pragmatic and commercially viable advice with efficient and focused communication.\"\n\nWe're a Conveyancing Quality Scheme accredited firm providing conveyancing to clients in Kettering . This is a guarantee that our processes and procedures have been approved, that we operate to a certain standard, and is a mark of the excellence of our service approved by the Law Society, the body which represents solicitors throughout England and Wales.\n\nWe are on the panel for most major lenders, and many smaller ones too. Whether you want to use your local Building Society in Northamptonshire or one of the larger corporates, chances are we have you covered.\n\nIn short, you get an excellent conveyancing service at an affordable price. You don't have the risk of going to the cheapest providers, most of whom aren't solicitors; instead you get a great service from proper lawyers.\n\nWhy don't you need a conveyancer based in Kettering ?\n\nIn the old days you used your local solicitor. You would visit their office in the centre of Kettering , and all documents would be hand-produced and posted or delivered by hand.\n\nThat service came at a price, but the truth is that it is no longer needed. With modern technology such as scanning, emailing and even Skype or Facetime video calls there is no need to use your local solicitor. Your conveyancer can be based anywhere and still provide a great service - even if he or she is in an office many miles away from Kettering or perhaps not even in Northamptonshire.\n\nWe have successfully dealt with thousands of conveyancing transactions all over the country, even with clients from the other side of the world. It is not unknown for us to talk to clients outside the UK using Skype, and once we had clients in Thailand talking to us through an interpreter in New Zealand!\n\nThere will be no need for you to visit our offices or hand deliver documents. You need never leave Kettering - our conveyancers will talk you through the process via phone and email, and everything works just as smoothly as it would if we were just down the road.\n\nOnline Conveyancing in Kettering\n\nThere isn't really any such thing as online conveyancing. Clients come to us for conveyancing in Kettering , Barton Seagrave, Cransley and all sorts of other places, having first found us via our website.\n\nAfter that, the relationship between you and your conveyancer is the same as any other. We have the same professional obligations towards you, and deal with your conveyancing file in the same way.\n\nIt might feel like online conveyancing because you can talk to us through email on your computer, but really it is proper conveyancing.\n\nSearch Fees in Kettering\n\nEvery local authority is different. We use an excellent, trusted national search provider, which means we can provide searches to clients in Kettering and all over the country, knowing that we will get a product we're happy with and which we know is properly insured and protects your interests.\n\nWhat is the process to instruct us for your conveyancing?\n\nFirst, fill in our conveyancing quote form for conveyancing in Kettering . You can find the links at the top of this page.\n\nOur helpful conveyancing support team will then guide you through the initial stages, and once your conveyancing file is opened your Kettering conveyancing solicitor and their small team will deal with the legal side of the conveyancing transaction.\n\nYou'll be given direct contact details for your conveyancing lawyers and they'll keep in touch with you every step of the way.\n\nWhether you're moving to Kettering or away from Kettering to somewhere else, our conveyancing team can help you do so with the minimum of fuss and inconvenience.\n\nFees for conveyancing in Kettering\n\nOur fees are transparent and, so long as the situation does not change (for example so long as your property doesn't turn out to be leasehold when we thought it was freehold) the fee we quote is the fee you will be charged.\n\nWe don't add extras on for things like photocopying, postage, or the like. Those are our overheads and we don't pass them on to you.\n\nAll our conveyancing fees are dependent on the nature and value of the transaction, so we naturally charge a bit more for more complicated and high value work. However, the fee charged will be the same for a customer in Newcastle as it would be for someone in London, or indeed in Kettering .\n\nThere are some aspects of our conveyancing fees which we can't change. Fees charged by other bodies such as HM Land Registry, or by HMRC for Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) are out of our control.\n\nIntroduction to Kettering\n\nKettering is a town in Northamptonshire, about 81 miles from London. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 67,635. The town is mainly situated on the west side of the River Ise, a tributary of the River Nene, which meets at Wellingborough.\n\nThe name 'Kettering' originally derives from the name Cytringan, Kyteringas and Keteiringan in the 10th century.\n\nWhilst it is not particularly close to London, there are fast InterCity trains directly to London St Pancras, which take approximately 1 hour. Consequently, Kettering has a surprisingly large London commuting population.\n\nIn terms of the local population, Kettering has a history of boot and shoe manufacturing, which allowed the town to develop significantly.\n\nNowadays, like many large British towns, the service and distribution industries have become much more prominent. Notable employers include Weetabix, Pegasus Software, RCI Europe and Timpsons Ltd.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to the town's prominent economy, it has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, with over 80% of adults in full time employment.\n\nKettering also has a relatively large sporting presence in the town. Kettering Town Football Club are one of the principal sports clubs in the town. They currently play at Latimer Park, which has a capacity of 2,300.\n\nThere are a few interesting facts about the club; it was the first British team to wear sponsorship upon their shirts in 1976, the first club to have their initials in their floodlights, and the club are also the leading FA Cup goalscorers of all time.\n\nThere is also a rugby club, Kettering RFC, who are located in Waverley Road on the eastern side of the town.\n\nIn terms of transport, the A14 road skirts the west and south of the town, and links the town with the A45 dual carriageway, as well as the M1 and M6 motorways. The A6003 links the town with Corby as well as the county town of Northampton and the A509 links Kettering with Wellingborough.\n\nKettering railway station is the main station in the town, and provides a half-hourly service to London St.Pancras, an hourly service to either Leicester or Nottingham, and there are also one train per day to York at the Weekends."
