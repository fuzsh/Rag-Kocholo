        "text": "Much has been written about NSO Group’s collision with government reality when the Israeli firm found itself on the wrong side of a business decision to sell their technologies to entities that used it to target human rights activists, political leaders, journalists, and a bevy of U.S. persons. The collision came in the form of the U.S. government blacklisting the company, effectively drying up a great percentage of their clients to the point where bankruptcy was seen on the horizon.\n\nWhite House nixes L3Harris interest in NSO\n\nThen, according to a recent New York Times expose, U.S. defense contractor/supplier L3Harris allegedly attempted a Phoenix-like save and raise the charred NSO from the ashes, with the sub rosa assistance of the U.S. intelligence community. Apparently, L3Harris had its eye on the “zero-click” exploit provided by NSO’s Pegasus for resale or exploitation by the U.S. To those not well versed in the government supply and contract world, L3Harris has expertise in the exploitation of cellphones.\n\nL3Harris was the provider of the Stingray cell phone tracking equipment for years until it was rendered obsolete by the rollout of the nationwide 5G network. (The void is being filled by Stingray-like devices manufactured by others, including Canadian firm Octasic, which sells the Nyxcell cell-site simulator. Gizmodo in an October 2020 piece inspected Octasic’s patent and noted, “Nyxcell forces a connection with nearby mobile devices when its signal is stronger than the nearest legitimate cellular tower. Once connected, Nyxcell prompts devices to divulge information about its signal strength relative to nearby cell towers.”)\n\nThe L3Harris foray into the possibility of acquiring NSO and its technologies/apps for alleged arms distance use by the U.S. intelligence community ran into the wall of realpolitik when the effort was brought to the attention of the White House. Words were not minced, and the message was direct: It isn’t going to happen. With that, it is said that L3Harris stepped away from the table. The skeptics will say, “Well, did they really step away?”\n\nFor now, as of July 2022, it looks like NSO is in a death spiral. Who picks up their technologies in the upcoming fire sale will be of global interest.\n\nApple takes lead on holding surveillance firms accountable\n\nIn early July, Apple announced that it was all-in at developing their own technology to protect their users from “highly targeted cyberattacks from private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware.” Apple announced their development of “Lockdown Mode,” which should be available for iOS16 devices in the autumn of 2022. Lockdown Mode should be considered for use only in the gravest of situations, as it will cause the iPhone to not function as advertised and limit the accessibility of many apps and some may no longer function at all.\n\nAccording to Ivan Krstic, Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture, “While the vast majority of users will never be the victims of highly targeted cyberattacks, we will work tirelessly to protect the small number of users who are. That includes continuing to design defenses specifically for these users, as well as supporting researchers and organizations around the world doing critically important work in exposing mercenary companies that create these digital attacks.”\n\nLockdown Mode features are:\n\nMessages: Most message attachment types other than images are blocked. Some features, like link previews, are disabled.\n\nWeb browsing: Certain complex web technologies, like just-in-time (JIT) JavaScript compilation, are disabled unless the user excludes a trusted site from Lockdown Mode.\n\nApple services: Incoming invitations and service requests, including FaceTime calls, are blocked if the user has not previously sent the initiator a call or request.\n\nWired connections with a computer or accessory are blocked when iPhone is locked.\n\nConfiguration profiles cannot be installed, and the device cannot enroll into mobile device management (MDM), while Lockdown Mode is turned on.\n\nApple continued how they are making available “a $10 million grant, to be added to any damages awarded from the lawsuit filed against NSO Group, to support organizations that investigate, expose, and prevent highly targeted cyberattacks.”"
