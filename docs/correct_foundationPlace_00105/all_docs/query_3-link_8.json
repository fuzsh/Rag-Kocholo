        "text": "A pegasus crossing, sometimes known as an equestrian crossing, is a push-button controlled crossing system which is usually found along bridleways and can be used by both pedestrians and riders mounted on horses. There are normally two sets of control panels; one for pedestrians (as on a puffin crossing) and one mounted two metres off the ground for mounted riders to press. These crossings may also feature fenced enclosures to keep the horses at a safe distance from the road before crossing. The pictograms feature red and green horses and riders as well as the standard green and red person. These are usually located on public bridleways.\n\nHow should pedestrians and equestrians approach a pegasus crossing?\n\nHorse riders do not have to dismount in order to cross at a pegasus crossing. After they have pushed the button, they should remain a safe distance from the road before crossing. If there is an enclosure, the horse and rider should wait there until the person/rider light signal turns green and it is safe to cross. It is important to keep to one side of the road when crossing and to be aware of fellow road users, whether they are walking or riding.\n\nHow should drivers approach a pegasus crossing?"
