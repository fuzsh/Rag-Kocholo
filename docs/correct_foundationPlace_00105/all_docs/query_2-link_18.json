        "text": "PEGASuS 5.1: Take it Further\n\nFuture Earth, with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation’s Science Program, is now offering a new grant opportunity to existing research teams and their new partners. This opportunity will support teams to engage in transdisciplinary research in one of two different thematic areas:\n\nUsing Nature-Based Solutions to mitigate or adapt to climate change specific to the oceans and coastal systems and\n\nScience-informed decision-support tools for reducing risk and/or improving response to disaster scenarios.\n\nThis opportunity will focus on enhancing and accelerating the existing projects, fostering new cross-project collaborations, and facilitating the involvement of new partners. The supported projects should develop new knowledge, innovative and integrated solutions and tools. The collaborative proposal must be submitted by a project lead based at an institution in a country in the Global South or by an indigenous-led organization in any country. Applicants must have an established organizational bank account to receive funds.\n\nProjects may request up to $50,000 USD and have to be completed by December 31, 2025.\n\nThe application submission deadline is 29 February 2024 by 23:59 local time.\n\nPEGASuS 6 – Risk, Response, and Responsibility in Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nFuture Earth’s PEGASuS is launching its sixth thematic research call. The PEGASuS VI call solicits proposals from transdisciplinary teams in Latin America and the Caribbean addressing the theme of Risk, Response, and Responsibility. The goal of this call is to support approaches that advance decision making and planning capabilities through integration of multiple sciences with lived experience from stakeholder groups, including but not limited to community and government representatives, planning councils, disaster response and humanitarian aid organizations, insurance and reinsurance companies, and communications partners.\n\nBecause of the many human elements in both the management, recovery, and reduction of risk, all proposals must include a social scientist or public health expert. Other knowledge holders and experts may come from a breadth of other disciplines and professions depending on the risk being addressed. Other details and required elements of proposal submissions follow below.\n\nFunding for this program is provided by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The program plans to award 2-4 successful proposals in this call. Projects may request up to $250,000 USD and have to be completed by December 31, 2025.\n\nFull proposals are due by 29 February 2024 at 20h00 EDT (UTC -5)\n\nPEGASuS 5: Engineering the Design of Nature-Based Solutions for Sustainable Development\n\nTraditional hard engineering coastal structures can be valuable in terms of mitigating coastal hazards. However, these hard solutions may not be aesthetically pleasing, can have deleterious effects on the environment, negative impacts on the cultural and socio-economic aspects of a community, may not always be able to be made adaptable to uncertain climate changes, are not self-sustaining, and require resources for maintenance throughout the design life of the structure.\n\nNatural ecosystems can serve as part of, or as the whole solution, for addressing these coastal problems in a sustainable manner while facilitating development works. Small Island Developing States (SIDS), such as those in the Caribbean can embrace nature-based solutions for coastal hazard mitigation not only to maintain aesthetic appeal of tourism-driven coastal infrastructure, but to provide climate-resilient solutions. Sustainable approaches must optimize solutions to minimize the impact on the environment and engage key stakeholders in decision making to maximize benefits to the wider society. Particularly, in the face of a changing climate with the potential increase in frequency and intensity of hazardous events, engineered designs must provide a given level of protection throughout the solution’s design life. These solutions must be appropriate, justifiable, cost-efficient, adaptable, yet effective. To achieve this goal successfully, a more universal approach to the design specification of nature-based solutions is critical to the development, design and uptake of these solutions in the wider Caribbean. To advance the knowledge and skill of designing these nature-based solutions, physical and numerical modelling, along with field work at various coastal sites, will enable the assessment of how the physical and natural environment is modified with the implementation of these various types of solutions. In addition, a concomitant emphasis on the impacts of the social environment should be included if sustainability is to be truly achieved. The critical views of stakeholders/partners will be solicited to ensure relevance and the improved adoption of recommendations at a regional scale which is of paramount importance if the output is expected to assist designers, planners and decision makers in determining optimal solutions.\n\nPI and study countries: Trinidad & Tobago, USA, Barbados, Jamaica and other selected Caribbean Island territories.\n\nLearn about the project outcomes.\n\nPhotos from the project:\n\nPEGASuS 4: Transdisciplinary Research for Pathways to Sustainability\n\nAs a key partner in the Belmont Forum CRA on “Transdisciplinary Research for Pathways to Sustainability”, Future Earth supported 4 projects and their activities expected to address the following topics:\n\nCreation of networks and communities of practice through facilitating and supporting knowledge/experience sharing among on-going efforts on topical and methodological aspects.\n\nSynthesis of knowledge or methodologies among regions and among on-going projects.\n\nThe collaboration with the Belmont Forum will help to provide a science base for achieving sustainability goals and focus on integrated qualitative and quantitative approaches to develop Earth-system-based transformation pathways for sustainable development. The funded projects must consider all important interactions among the sustainable development goals, and address cross-cutting issues among at a minimum three or more explicitly identified Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nBy increasing the international profile of researchers supported both by the Belmont Forum collaborative research actions, as well as the facilitation of the development of research consortia with these awards, the program is the most diverse and has the highest global geographic coverage to date. The research consortia supported by the program are 25% from the African continent, increasing the impact of the research funds in the Global South.\n\nPEGASuS 3: SUGI-NEXUS “Take it Further”\n\nThe Belmont Forum’s and JPI Urban Europe’s Sustainable Urbanisation Global Initiative Food-Water-Energy Nexus (SUGI/NEXUS) provides a unique collaboration framework for technical and social scientists, small and large businesses, cities and non-governmental organizations, to tackle the urban challenges of food, energy and water nexus. The 15 existing SUGI/Nexus projects are currently developing new knowledge, innovative and integrated solutions and tools to address food, water and energy challenges in urban areas.\n\nFuture Earth, with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation’s Science Program, is partnering with the Belmont Forum to make available a new grant opportunity to the existing SUGI/Nexus teams and new partners. This opportunity “PEGASuS: SUGI-NEXUS Take it Further” grants, focuses on enhancing and accelerating the existing Belmont-funded projects as well as fostering new cross-project collaborations and facilitate the involvement of new partners. Particular consideration was given to projects that focus on the Global South.\n\nNine proposals were received in mid-July 2020. Each proposal was reviewed by at least three anonymous reviewers and scored against the evaluation criteria given. Reviewers were selected from the Future Earth Member Portal community of experts. Four proposals were selected for funding based on reviewer recommendations and available funding.\n\nResearch teams come from 14 countries. Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Jordan, Madagascar, South Africa, Sweden, USA, UK.\n\nStudy locations cover 12 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, India, Jordan, Madagascar, USA, South Africa, Sweden, USA, UK."
