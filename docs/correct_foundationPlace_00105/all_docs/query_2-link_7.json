        "text": "A powerful hacking tool called Pegasus, sold to governments around the world by the Israeli surveillance company NSO Group, has been used to spy on journalists, human rights activists, the fiancée of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and others, according to a months-long investigation by 17 news organizations, including FRONTLINE.\n\nThe investigation of the spyware was coordinated by the journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories, with technical support from Amnesty International’s Security Lab. Forbidden Stories and Amnesty had access to a leak of more than 50,000 records of phone numbers concentrated in countries known to be NSO clients. NSO has disputed the findings of the reporting and said it will investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action.\n\nFRONTLINE is producing a documentary with Forbidden Stories.

They drove her, blindfolded and in handcuffs, to an interrogation cell on the edge of the city, she said. There, she was questioned all night and into the morning about her fiance, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe next day, at 10:14 a.m. on April 22, 2018, while her devices were still in official custody, someone opened the Chrome browser on one of the Androids. They tapped in the address of a website “https://myfiles[.]photos/1gGrRcCMO”, on the phone’s keyboard, fumbling over the tiny keys, making two typos, and then pressed “go,” according to a new forensic analysis by cybersecurity expert Bill Marczak of Citizen Lab. The process took 72 seconds. The website sent the phone a powerful spyware package, known as Pegasus, according to the new analysis.”\n\nRead More (subscription required)\n\nFriday, December 3, 2021\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nPegasus spyware used to hack U.S. diplomats working abroad\n\n“Apple alerted 11 U.S. diplomats that their iPhones had been hacked in recent months by spyware from NSO Group, an Israeli-based company that helps government clients in dozens of countries secretly steal files, eavesdrop on conversations and track the movements of its targets, according to people familiar with the notifications.\n\nThe news, first reported by Reuters and confirmed by The Washington Post, comes a month after U.S. officials blacklisted the NSO Group amid allegations that its foreign government clients had enabled hacking against embassy employees, political activists, human rights workers and others.”\n\nRead More (subscription required)\n\nTuesday, November 23, 2021\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nApple sues Israeli spyware maker NSO over its Pegasus spyware\n\n“Apple announced Tuesday that it has sued Israel-based NSO Group over the use of its Pegasus spyware to attack Apple devices, the latest move in an escalating global campaign to curb surveillance abuses against smartphone users.\n\nThe suit, which seeks an injunction against NSO to stop it from using any Apple software, service or device, comes after the July publication of the Pegasus Project by The Washington Post and 16 other news organizations that detailed the use of Pegasus in dozens of attacks against journalists, human rights workers and political activists in countries across the world.”\n\nRead More (subscription required)\n\nWednesday, November 3, 2021\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nBiden administration blacklists NSO Group over Pegasus spyware\n\n“The United States on Wednesday added the Israeli spyware company NSO Group to its ‘entity list,’ a federal blacklist prohibiting the company from receiving some American technologies, after determining the company’s phone-hacking tools had been used by foreign governments to ‘maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers.’\n\nThe move is a significant sanction against a company spotlighted in July by the global Pegasus Project consortium, including The Washington Post and 16 other news organizations worldwide.”\n\nRead More (subscription required)\n\nTuesday, August 3, 2021\n\nDirekt36\n\n‘A story like out of a spy movie,’ personal reports by two surveilled Direkt36 journalists\n\n“How did it feel to find out they were surveilled through their phones for weeks or months?

Dubai, a monarchy in the United Arab Emirates, wanted NSO to give it permission to expand its potential use of the spyware so it could target mobile phones in the UK.”\n\nRead More\n\nThursday, July 22, 2021\n\nThe Guardian\n\nIsrael to examine whether spyware export rules should be tightened\n\n“An Israeli commission reviewing allegations that NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware was misused by its customers to target journalists and human rights activists will examine whether rules on Israel’s export of cyberweapons such as Pegasus should be tightened, a senior MP has said.\n\nThe move came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, convened an emergency cybersecurity meeting after reports his mobile phone and those of government ministers appeared in the leaked list.\n\nNSO has said Macron was not a ‘target’ of any of its customers, meaning the company denies he was selected for surveillance using its spyware, saying in multiple statements that it requires its government clients to only use its powerful spying tools for legitimate investigations into terrorism or crime.”\n\nRead More\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nFrance orders spyware investigation following Pegasus Project reports\n\n“The French government said Thursday that investigations are underway into reports from The Washington Post and other international news organizations that phone numbers for President Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders, as well as for activists and journalists, were found on a list that included some people targeted by government clients of the Israeli surveillance giant NSO Group and its spyware tool Pegasus.\n\nThe journalism consortium, operating as the Pegasus Project, revealed that the numbers for three presidents, 10 prime ministers and the king of Morocco had all been discovered among the more than 50,000 phone records on the list. None of the world leaders’ devices was forensically examined, but tests of other phones on the list found evidence of an attempted or successful spyware intrusion.”\n\nRead More (subscription required)\n\nThe Guardian\n\nDalai Lama’s inner circle listed in Pegasus project data\n\n“The phone numbers of a top ring of advisers around the Dalai Lama are believed to have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group. Analysis strongly indicates that the Indian government was selecting the potential targets.\n\n…\n\nNSO’s Pegasus spyware allows clients to infiltrate phones and extract their calls, messages and location. The selected Tibetans did not make their phones available to confirm whether any hacking was attempted or successful, but technical analysis of 10 other phones on the suspected Indian client list found traces of Pegasus or signs of targeting related to the spyware.\n\n…\n\nIn multiple statements, NSO said the fact a number appeared on the leaked list was in no way indicative of whether it was selected for surveillance using Pegasus. ‘The list is not a list of Pegasus targets or potential targets,’ the company said. ‘The numbers in the list are not related to NSO Group in any way.'”\n\nRead More\n\nWednesday, July 21, 2021\n\nThe Washington Post\n\n‘Somebody has to do the dirty work’: NSO founders defend the spyware they built\n\n“The agents said the Israelis’ technology, which helped carriers troubleshoot their customers’ smartphones by sending them an SMS link that enabled the carrier to access the phone remotely, could be useful for saving people’s lives. Traditional methods of wiretapping calls were becoming obsolete in the age of the smartphone, the officers explained, because early encryption software blocked their ability to read and listen to the conversations of terrorists, pedophiles and other criminals. Would Hulio and Lavie be able to help them, by building a version of their technology that the officials could use?\n\nMore than a decade later, the cybersecurity company that arose out of that fateful conversation — the NSO Group, an acronym based off the first names of the three founders — is at the center of a global debate over the weaponization of powerful and largely unregulated surveillance technology.”\n\nRead More (subscription required)\n\nThe Guardian\n\nDubai suspected after Princess Haya listed in leaked Pegasus project data\n\n“As her plane touched down in April 2019, Princess Haya bint al-Hussein, who was accompanied by her two children, might have hoped she was beyond the reach of her ex-husband, the emir of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.\n\n…\n\nShe did not know, however, it was likely mobile phone numbers belonging to her, her closest aides, advisers and friends, were being entered into a computer system operated by agents of the emirate of Dubai, one of the clients of spyware manufacturer NSO Group.”\n\nRead More\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nA princess raced to escape Dubai’s powerful ruler. Then her phone appeared on the list.\n\n“Princess Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum, the 32-year-old daughter of Dubai’s fearsome ruler, believed she was closer than ever to political asylum — and, for the first time, real freedom in the United States, members of her escape team said in interviews.\n\nBut there was one threat she hadn’t planned for: The spyware tool Pegasus, which her father’s government was known to have used to secretly hack and track people’s phones. Leaked data shows that by the time armed commandos stormed the yacht, eight days into her escape, operatives had entered the numbers of her closest friends and allies into a system that had also been used for selecting Pegasus surveillance targets.”\n\nRead More (subscription required)\n\nThe Guardian\n\nIsrael ‘creating task force’ to manage response to Pegasus project\n\n“Israel’s government is reportedly setting up a task force to manage the fallout from Pegasus project revelations about the use of spying tools sold to authoritarian governments by the Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group.\n\nA team including representatives from the defence ministry, ministry of justice, foreign ministry, military intelligence and the Mossad, the national intelligence agency, is poised to conduct an investigation into whether “policy changes” are needed regarding sensitive cyber exports, several Israeli media outlets reported on Tuesday night, quoting unnamed officials.”\n\nRead More\n\nThe Guardian\n\nTelegram founder listed in leaked Pegasus project data\n\n“Cybersecurity experts who have examined how NSO’s Pegasus spyware works say the software does not discriminate between encrypted messaging apps and can access pretty much everything on an infected phone.

By Monday, government and political opposition leaders from the European Union and France, India, Hungary and other countries had expressed fury and demanded answers as to whether the surveillance system had been abused.”\n\nRead More (subscription required)\n\nThe Guardian\n\nEmmanuel Macron identified in leaked Pegasus project data\n\n“The leaked database at the heart of the Pegasus project includes the mobile phone numbers of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and 13 other heads of state and heads of government, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nThe South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and the Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, are also listed in the data, which includes diplomats, military chiefs and senior politicians from 34 countries.\n\nThe appearance of a number on the leaked list — which includes numbers selected by governments that are clients of NSO Group, the Israeli spyware firm — does not mean it was subject to an attempted or successful hack.

It can collect location logs of where a user has been and also determine where that user is now, along with data indicating whether the person is stationary or, if moving, in which direction.\n\n…\n\nThese kinds of “zero-click” attacks, as they are called within the surveillance industry, can work on even the newest generations of iPhones, after years of effort in which Apple attempted to close the door against unauthorized surveillance — and built marketing campaigns on assertions that it offers better privacy and security than rivals.”\n\nRead More (subscription required)\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nThe spyware is sold to governments to fight terrorism.
