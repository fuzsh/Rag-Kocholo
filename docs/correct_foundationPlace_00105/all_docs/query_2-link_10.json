        "text": "Pegasus, the notorious spyware, was created in 2010, but it wasn’t until six years later that its existence was revealed following an intriguing phishing incident. In 2016, a human rights activist received a text message promising information about alleged prisoner abuse in the United Arab Emirates. Instead of acting impulsively, the recipient decided to take cautious action and shared the message with the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, an organization specializing in the study of online threats at the Munk School of Global Affairs.\n\nIn collaboration with Lookout, a foundation dedicated to security and privacy, researchers discovered that Pegasus used malware to exploit a design vulnerability in iPhone devices, allowing it to gain unrestricted access.\n\nDeveloped by NSO Group, a cyber intelligence company based in Israel, Pegasus has constantly evolved, anticipating the security measures adopted by Apple to protect the iOS and Android operating systems. This spyware has evolved from its initial spread via short text messages to the implementation of “Zero click” attacks. This is alarming as it does not require the user to take any action from their device. It can be introduced by simply sending a WhatsApp or iMessage message or by making a missed call without the need for the other party to read or answer the message. Pegasus camouflages itself practically undetectably on both iOS and Android, being highly effective in what are known as Zero day attacks, in which the phone manufacturer has no prior knowledge of the exploited vulnerability.\n\nPegasus has been used by governments and entities for the purpose of spying on a wide range of individuals and organizations around the world. Targets include journalists, human rights activists, politicians, democracy advocates and other actors who are considered a threat or who possess information valuable to the interests of those who use this software.\n\nSome notorious cases of spying with Pegasus have been reported in countries such as Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Reports suggest it has been used to spy on critical journalists, political opponents, human rights lawyers and other individuals fighting for transparency and justice.\n\nMore than 600 government officials and politicians from 34 countries are on the Project Pegasus list including 10 Prime Ministers, three Presidents and one King. Nowadays it can be used to spy on any device.\n\nAt Encriptados we have the best digital security and secure communications tools with which you can confront Pegasus and any other software that tries to access your information.
