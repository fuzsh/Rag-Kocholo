        "text": "When I went to World Fantasy in Columbus, Ohio, we debuted my book, The Angels of Our Better Beasts, and as a bonus, I offered to draw a free beast of your own creation. Many people took me up on that! They described to me beasts and I drew them, and here are some of those beasts. If I drew a beast for you and it isn’t present, it could be because I didn’t have a photo of it, but if you send it, I will add it to the collection of beasts.\n\nWhat I learned: that we all have a favorite creature–and that we have imagined them before. Very few of you made up something on the spot. You were ready. You had a Beast in Mind. As part of our childhood, as part of our parenting, or as just something we’ve longed to see as real. At different times as a child, I used to walk around with an invisible Pegasus, an invisible Lassie, and I can’t tell you too much more about the werewolf I thought would come for me when I was a teen–except that he was there, on the fringes of my consciousness. I was a creative kid. You are too. Your beasts travel with you.\n\nThere is nothing to be ashamed of in having your Beasts. They are often playful, sometimes scary. But the scary ones even bring a smile to people’s faces, as if the very badass-ness of the Beast they’ve created is wonderful.\n\nI know one man, Alex, said that he created Uber-Corgi for his son, and that they told stories of Uber-Corgi. Maybe you’ve made up a beast for your kids too…\n\nMost of the beasts were Whimsical which I guess means that we see furry creatures as part of a fantasy, not a horror. I know online RPGs enjoy giving you “pets” of exotic beasts and people love collecting those.\n\nI’m glad I could be a part of making your beast come to life!\n\nSo if you have a beast not pictured here, and you send me the picture of it, I’ll add it here.\n\nI know we did about 25-30 beasts in Columbus, about ten in Toronto (one I can’t put online–you know why, Stephen!). I didn’t have a chance to capture them all–but maybe you know where the fantastic beasts are and where to find them… hehe…\n\nJust a note: I’m not running the free beast with a book program right now. All of you I’ve promised a beast to are still getting one, if you don’t have it already… but it was a great promotion for the launch and for the Toronto Launch too.\n\nI will start this up as a promo later in the year with ChiZine again so watch for the chance to get your Beast realized. Until then, please enjoy these beasts! And let me know where to find the rest!\n\nMany folks are writing up their last year’s work for possible awards eligibility, and since I did a compilation of work, I want to distinguish what’s new and what’s not.\n\nBut first can I say: Finally, after years of writing, I published a book! YAY! It feels good to get something out and in a finished form. Needless to say, I’m very proud of this book. Whatever it does in the world is fine with me. It is a record now of what I’ve done. I hope you like it.\n\nFor your consideration:\n\nCollection of Stories: The Angels of Our Better Beasts, from ChiZine.\n\nThis collection pivots around beasts–the animal kind, the monster kind, and the kind we turn into with those we love–and asks questions about the influence we have on each other.\n\nThe Lemmings are really researching the Arctic biologists, the werewolves sing sweet Christian praise songs, and the signing gorilla just wants someone back in the cage for a minute or two. The Gryphon can fight your war for you, and there isn’t really a problem when the man you’ve been online dating turns out to be a bear, is there? No worries. Those old lions in the canyon aren’t up to something, are they? The doctors in the red coats just want to cure you of a terrible blood disease. Trust them. In the forest, the sasquatch has fallen in love with the cryptozoologist who follows him, while the god of the Brazos River courts the young, pretty Texas college students.\n\nFour of the stories in this collection were new in 2016 and are eligible:\n\n“Sam McGee Argues With His Box of Authentic Ashes” (a narrative poem)\n\nSam McGee is famous for his appearance in the Robert W Service poem, “The Cremation of Sam McGee” so famous, that the real Sam McGee was once offered a bag of his own ashes when he came back to the Yukon. This poem is him in sudden conversation with his own “famous” ashes….\n\n“Heartbreak, Gospel, Shotgun, Fiddler, Werewolf, Chorus: Bluegrass”\n\nAlways loved werewolves but wanted to play with the trope. This werewolf is hiding in a gospel bluegrass band as the lead singer and banjo player. The other members know, and they keep him shackled on moonlit nights, but they won’t kill him because the band is the best-selling, triple platinum soul-winning force for Jesus. And though he’s killed two people, they are saving souls and doing good in the world and maybe that balances out two murders…\n\n“You Will Draw This Life To Its End”\n\nAuguste Rennault is an older painter famous for his depiction of our human advance throughout the solar system–but he wants to retire to a mining colony in Jupiter-irradiated space around Ganymede to be with a man he loves. The art community and his funders resist so he creates a great work to paint the miners, living with them, knowing it will be his last. Instead of retiring, he starts using his fame to change the balance of power between miner’s unions and corporations, illustrating the Miner’s Strike, trying to see how far the corporations will go to protect the famous painter in a dangerous place. But it’s not easy to ascribe fame onto others, or use your fame for social change, and there are limits…\n\n“Awake, Gryphon!”\n\nA young prince awakens to find his Holy City under siege, his father and brothers and sisters dead in a battle and himself as the recipient of the crown and the “great wisdom” that is said to pass from King to oldest surviving heir. But are all his choices now coming from “the wisdom”? And is it wise to awaken the unpredictable Gryphon to save the Holy City? Everyone seems to have a plan on what to do for him, but none can really trust a prince who wants to wake the Gryphon.\n\nI wrote one flash fiction piece, “Your Weird Aunt Pollymorph Says Hello,” that appeared in FLIGHT: the Queer Scifi Flash Fiction Anthology from Mischief Corner Books and won first place in the contest they had.\n\nIt’s about a sentient holographic computer interface that can take on the shape of the person best suited to work with you, but who is struggling to understand who to be for a ten year old girl whose mother has taken her from her friends and brought her on the ship.\n\nI also was able to write a couple of good blogposts, namely “My Mother, My New Club, and the Swastika On My Shoes” and “Wealth has always been the greatest (unspoken) superpower”\n\nSince I’m both American and Canadian, my work is eligible for Auroras and Sunbursts as well as World Fantasy and LGBT awards.\n\n_______________________________\n\nOverall, this year was a production year of getting the book ready to be published and then getting it in front of as many eyes as we could. I moved Dec 30-31 of last year to a new place–so I was in Kettering when this year began. An upstairs lofty, quirky kind of bedroom and outer-room that became an office. From January-February, I was packaging the book together to give to Andrew Wilmot, my amazing editor, working at the behest of ChiZine. I wrote two of the stories then–the long ones. We had to make decisions at the end to not finish a couple I’d have loved to have in there, but they were long and they were taking a lot of time to get finished and would have made the book unbalanced.\n\nI taught a class for the Lifelong Learning Center on Jesus in Science Fiction, which went over really well, and was also a guest speaker for the Fantasy And Science Fiction Appreciation Club on the University of Dayton campus and started a Science Fiction Writing Workshop Club on campus after being a guest speaker at LitFest in April. I teach there as an adjunct.\n\nAfter Andrew sent the manuscript back with edits, I worked on it even more through April. Then in May I moved back into my friend’s house in Vandalia and drew 15 illustrations for the book. My banjo playing werewolf from “Heartbreak” is one of them:\n\nOnce I sent those off, I went off to see my birthmother in Daleville, IN, some friends in Chicago, and then off to a novel-writing workshop in Kansas–met Kij Johnson, Andy Duncan, Chris McKitterick and a lot of wonderful new writers. It was a hot, muggy, but informational two weeks where I learned a lot about myself as a writer and what I was prepared to do to write a novel.\n\nWhen I returned from that, I taught a six week research writing course at UD and then moved into my new place in August in the Fairview area of Dayton. Sept-Dec was teaching, teaching, teaching, and grading, grading, grading and taking on a new job as a Marketer for ManCo Property Services. I market their property and work on their Salem Avenue Peace Corridor newsletter. In October, my book came out! I took it to World Fantasy in Columbus and launched it there (even though it wouldn’t be available in the US till Dec 13, another two months), then went to Toronto for the Canadian book launch of AoBB, and Texas for Thanksgiving to see my folks, followed quickly by a long trip to Whitehorse, YT and Calgary AB to see friends and recuperate from a long year.\n\nIn September I did an overhaul of this website, but will do another in a few days. I’m making a promise to use blogging more this year and Facebook less. Facebook is ephemeral and it’s hard to recapture what you did unless you want to scroll back through everything slowly….\n\n2017 will be a huge production year too as I get One Nation Under Gods written and finished by the Fall for ChiZine, as well as a couple of stories that have been waiting a long time to be done. I want them done by February. I take on a new editing project–more on that in April–and some new changes in the Fall of 2017 for me, most likely.\n\nIn all, I got work to do.\n\nSo this was my year! It was a good one. We’re gonna make another one like this, but better for 2017. Thanks for being a part of it!"
