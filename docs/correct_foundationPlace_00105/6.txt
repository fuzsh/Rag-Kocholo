Once believed to be obscure, the name Kettering is now taken to mean 'the place (or territory) of Ketter's people. From the 17th century Kettering was a centre for the production of woollen cloth and later of silk and plush, this later changed in the 19th century with the development of the boot and shoe industry, for which Northamptonshire as a whole became famous.

Today as a fast-growing and centrally located English town in the UK, Kettering's economy is increasing well above the national rates. The area has a mix of markets and industrial companies including Aryzta, Weetabix, Pegasus Software, RCI Europe and Timsons Ltd to name a few.

Also above the national average is Kettering's employment rate as over 80% of its adults are in full-time employment.
