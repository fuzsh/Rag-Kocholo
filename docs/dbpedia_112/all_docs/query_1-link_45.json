        "text": "The Vibe\n\nThis is an aesthetically pleasing neighbourhood. Large homes are situated around green space, ponds and water features and brand new condo buildings are surrounded by amenities and well planned roadways. The residents seem happy to be there, enjoying the quick access to amenities and opportunities to get in touch with nature.\n\nMeet the Neighbours\n\nThere are a lot of families in The Meadows with 58 per cent of residents having children at home, according to the latest report from Census Canada. The census also showed that 23 per cent of the population is in their 30s and 19 per cent are children aged nine and under.\n\nIn the Area\n\nA major commercial complex is located at the corner of 17th Street and Whitemud Drive offering box stores, restaurants, supermarkets, banks and anything else you could need. Schools for kids in kindergarten to grade nine are here, and high schools are a short ride away. A large transit centre, public library and the Mill Creek Ravine are all here.\n\nPlanes, Trains & Automobiles\n\nBoth 34th Street and 17th Street will take you to the Whitemud Drive, which runs completely through the city both east and west. The Meadows Transit Centre is on 17th Street offering transport to other parts of the city and major bus routes run through the residential streets. You can get on the Anthony Henday ring road via 17th Street south, which will take you around Edmonton entirely.\n\nThe Good, the Bad & the Rest\n\nThe Meadows has many neighbourhoods that are still being developed. You’ll find new construction for detached homes, apartment condos, row homes and commercial areas. Though it means population density will increase in the next few years, it also opens up a lot of new housing for those looking to move into the area with plenty of amenities to go with it.\n\nDollars & Sense\n\nThe box stores and chain restaurants set the bar for the neighbourhood’s general price range. Entertainment, dining and shopping is as expected of these tiny commercial villages. Real estate and rentals are reasonably priced. This is a great neighbourhood to shop in if you’re looking for a newer home and don’t have a massive budget."
