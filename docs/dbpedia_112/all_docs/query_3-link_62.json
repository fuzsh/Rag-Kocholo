        "text": "Transportation\n\nCars are an excellent medium of transportation in this area. It is a rather short car ride to the closest highway from any location in Aster, and coming across a parking spot is generally easy. On the other hand, getting around by public transit is very hard in this area. The bike is a rather poor mode of transportation in Aster as the cycling infrastructure is not very comprehensive, and there are a good number of hills for cyclists to brave. Walking is also not very feasible for residents in Aster since most daily needs are challenging to meet without having to use a vehicle.\n\nServices\n\nParents and their kids will value that no matter where their home is situated in Aster, primary schools are close by. In contrast, there are no high schools in Aster. Concerning eating, getting to the nearest supermarket on foot is possible for some, but not all, home buyers in this part of Edmonton.\n\nCharacter\n\nThere is a broad selection of green spaces in Aster. Although Aster does not contain any green spaces, parks are well-situated in nearby neighbourhoods, which results in them being easy to get to from the majority of locations within this neighbourhood. Since there are very few pedestrians, this part of Edmonton is relatively serene."
