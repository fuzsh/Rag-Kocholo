        "text": "If you have been injured in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in Alberta, you are entitled to accident benefits coverage under the Motor Vehicles Act, regardless of whether you were at fault. The amount of coverage that you receive will depend on the type of injury that you have sustained.\n\nIf you have been in a car accident you should contact your insurance company to let them know. Then book an appointment immediately with a chiropractic to get an early assessment.\n\nThe good news is that you don’t have to seek approval of the insurer to get an assessment. The chiropractic clinic will bill the automobile insurer directly so you can focus on recovering and not on administrative hassles.\n\nTreatment length is usually 10 – 12 weeks for car accident injuries. There is a large variance and you may only require a couple of visits or you may require years of treatment depending on the extent of your injuries. Under Section B Accident Benefits your insurance company is required to cover all reasonable expenses incurred within 2 years from the date of the accident for necessary chiropractic and other medical services that are essential for rehabilitation.\n\nInjured at work? Then you may be eligible to have your entire treatment covered by WCB.\n\nIf you have injured yourself at work you and your employee need to fill out a WCB claim. You can then go for an assessment at an approved WCB chiropractic clinic. The initial chiropractic examination and first treatment will be paid for by WCB.\n\nFurther chiropractic treatment is only approved once the claim is accepted. If approved, the WCB may authorize chiropractic treatment for up to six weeks. That means you won’t be required to pay anything out of your own pocket and your treatment will be free.\n\nDirect billing is the chiropractic clinic taking on the tedious task of submitting your claim to your insurance company for you!\n\nTake advantage of the clinics that provide this service for you. It is a huge time saver for you and you won’t have to submit claims after every visit. The insurance company pays the chiropractic clinic directly for your treatment. Depending on your health care coverage only part of your treatment may be covered so you will need to pay for the portion that the insurance doesn’t cover.\n\nIf none of the above funded options are available to you then you will have to pay out of your own pocket.\n\nPrices will vary depending on the type of assessment, injury and time that is required. Chiropractic that have taken additional education and require certification for specialized skills will charge more per visit.\n\nAssessments: $105 to $180\n\nTreatments $75 – $140\n\nYou will always be told the cost of the services when you book your first appointment and then the therapist will give you a detailed treatment plan including expectations and costs after your initial assessment.\n\nThere are a few different ways to get your best chiropractic treatments covered in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nWere you injured at work?\n\nThen you may be eligible to have your entire treatment covered by WCB. If you have injured yourself at work you and your employee need to fill out a WCB claim. You can then go for an assessment at an approved WCB chiropractic clinic. The\n\ninitial chiropractic examination and first treatment will be paid for by WCB.\n\nFurther chiropractic treatment is only approved once the claim is accepted. If approved, the WCB may authorize chiropractic treatment for up to six weeks. That means you won’t be required to pay anything out of your own pocket and your treatment will be free.\n\nAre you covered under Alberta Health Services?\n\nThere is limited coverage from Alberta Health Services for chiropractic. An assessment at a clinic that provides provincial funding is required to determine if you are eligible. To find AHS-funded chiropractic services, visit Alberta Health Service’s\n\nwebsite and search for “chiropractic.” This program provides early, limited intervention (3-7 visits) for clients that have had a recent decline in their function following musculoskeletal (i.e. muscle/joint) injury or surgery. Chiropractic treatment and teaching will be offered to help decrease pain, increase strength and flexibility and manage daily activities.\n\nAre you covered under Employer Insurance Benefits?\n\nChiropractic is normally included in employer or purchased health benefit plans. Coverage varies from plan to plan and can range from $500 to unlimited so you need to look into the details of your health coverage. Some insurers require a referral from a doctor to access your chiropractic coverage. Most clinics offer direct billing so they will manage the administration of reimbursement for you so you can focus your efforts on your treatment instead of managing paperwork."
