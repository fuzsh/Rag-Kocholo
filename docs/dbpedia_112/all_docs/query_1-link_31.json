World-class attractions and stunning outdoor urban parkland and landscapes surround Edmonton houses for sale and draw homebuyers as well as tourists from around the globe. From our picturesque prairies to our Boreal Forests and citywide hiking, biking and walking trails Edmonton communities are connected to our natural landscape.\n\nWe also receive more sunshine than most other Canadian cities, with mild winters and low precipitation. Perhaps this is why we're the host city for some of the largest festivals in the country, including the annual K-Days that features carnival rides, live music, tradeshows, fireworks, food stops and more.\n\nHomes For Sale Outside Edmonton\n\nLooking for a home in one of Edmonton's neighbouring communities?
