        "text": "Pick Brad and you won't regret it. We chose him after interviewing 2 other Realtors. His straight forward approach may not be everyone's preference at first, but you will appreciate it when he is working for you in your corner. He treats you with the utmost respect and never pushes you into or out of a decision leaving it up to you to comfortably come to your own conclusion after he walks through the options which my wife greatly appreciated.\n\n- Brian Swille\n\nBrad Richardson is a dedicated real estate agent who kept my specific requirements in mind. He treated me with respect and kindness, never pressuring me to make an offer. Brad took the time to listen then answered my many questions with his expert knowledge and patience. He was able to facilitate brokers, painters, movers, lawyers, and renovation specialists, etc. His advice during the negotiations proved invaluable, for both the sale of my home as well as the purchase of a condo. I would sincerely recommend Brad Richardson for any of your real estate needs.\n\n- Lois Bruce\n\nMy experience working with Brad Richardson REALTORÂ® Edmonton HQ | MaxWell Progressive team was 5 stars for the following reasons related to selling a 2 bedroom /2 bathroom condo in NW Edmonton. 1) Responsive to my requests in a timely manner & listened (ie concerns & questions). Brad & team always answered my calls and were friendly throughout the process. I never felt I was intruding with my questions or had to chase the team for answers. Listening to your customer's is a very important quality & is a foundation for working collaboratively. 2) Attention to detail. If something needed to be done that required attention I was always kept in the loop & advised accordingly. This was clear from my initial conversation with Brad when discussing condo requirements in preparation before listing & contract responsibilities.\n\n- Stefan Ginder"
