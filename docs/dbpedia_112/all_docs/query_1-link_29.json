As the city expanded, it grew around the valley and preserved it as the focal point of the region. Today, the river is one of the region's greatest natural features, running from southwest to northeast Edmonton, carving its way through the heart of the city and bringing with it a healthy greenbelt. These areas are home to many popular public spaces for picnicking, swimming, and ice skating, just to name a few.\n\nEdmonton is more commonly renowned for its annual festivals and grand shopping destination, West Edmonton Mall. Each year, ethnic groups from around the city unite to showcase their cultural pride at one of the city’s prime cultural centres, in Sir Winston Churchill Square, at the Art Gallery of Alberta, or in West Edmonton Mall. Residents not only frequent the mall for one of Canada’s best shopping experiences, but also to take in a show, concert, or event at the mall’s ice rink and many stages.\n\nThe city is also home to some of Alberta’s best schools and universities, including the University of Alberta and the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT), and MacEwan University.\n\nGet In Touch.\n\nExpert knowledge, professional service, unparalleled commitment.\n\nFind your dream Edmonton or Sherwood Park home with Ralph Henze today.\n\nCall Text Email\n\nBack To Edmonton Real Estate"
