        "text": "Our Division offers a variety of schools and programs for families to consider. Each school has their own mix of courses, clubs and culture, but no two schools are quite the same. No matter where you go, your child will receive a high-quality education in all of our schools.\n\nDESIGNATED SCHOOLS\n\nEvery home address in Edmonton has a designated public school for resident students. Your designated school isn’t always the one closest to your home. Use our Find a School tool to search for your designated elementary, junior high and high school.\n\nRESIDENT STUDENTS\n\nSome Division schools and programs don’t have enough space for all the students who wish to attend. When that happens, schools give priority to resident students of Edmonton Public Schools.\n\nIn most cases, a resident student has at least one parent or legal guardian living in Edmonton who is not Roman Catholic.\n\nCHOOSING A SCHOOL\n\nResident students can attend their designated school if they register or pre-enrol before 4 p.m. on March 22. However, if their designated school uses a lottery process, some students may not be able to attend that school.\n\nStudents may also choose to attend any other Division school, as long as:\n\nthe school has space\n\nthe student meets any entrance requirements of that school\n\nFind lists of schools or search the Find a School tool.\n\nNON-RESIDENT STUDENTS CHANGING SCHOOLS\n\nNon-resident students who are changing schools, including students who are entering junior high or high school, are welcome to attend any Division school with space. Enrolment will depend on:\n\nwhich level the school is at on the Growth Control Model, and\n\nif there is space at the school after all resident students are enrolled\n\nThe Education Act requires us to enrol resident students first.\n\nFACTORS TO CONSIDER\n\nEvery student who chooses Edmonton Public Schools receives high-quality programming and supports. Choosing the right school depends on what is most important for your family. Ultimately, the school you choose should be one where your child feels happy, confident and excited to learn.\n\nSome considerations might include:\n\nyour child’s strengths and interests\n\nthe school's academic focus orprogramming\n\nthe school's atmosphere or culture\n\nlocation andbus service\n\nchild care\n\nRESEARCH YOUR OPTIONS\n\nTo find the right fit for your family, learn more about our schools and the programs they offer by:\n\ntalking with friends, family or neighbours\n\nvisitingschool websites\n\nattendingopen house events\n\nmaking an appointment to meet the principal or tour the school\n\nREGISTER FOR SCHOOL"
