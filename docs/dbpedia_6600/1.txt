Cleopatra, American epic film, released in 1963, that was perhaps best known for its off-screen drama, notably production overruns that nearly bankrupted Twentieth Century-Fox and the affair between stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.

The film traces the romances between the Egyptian queen Cleopatra (played by Taylor) and her Roman suitors Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) and Mark Antony (Burton). Caesar, infatuated with the beautiful Cleopatra, declares her sole ruler over Egypt, although he keeps her as his own lover. When Caesar is assassinated in Rome, Antony, his protégé, assumes power, and he too becomes obsessed with Cleopatra. He eventually marries her, which causes a scandal in Rome and emboldens his political rival Octavian (Roddy McDowall), who launches an invasion fleet to Egypt. In a fierce battle, Octavian’s forces defeat Antony at Actium, near Greece. Wrongly informed that Cleopatra is dead, Antony takes his own life—an act that leads Cleopatra to do the same.
