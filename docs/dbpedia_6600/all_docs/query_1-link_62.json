        "text": "Wordplay. A popular myth exists that states that the cesarean section procedure (or caesarian section, as it’s called in many English-speaking places) is named after Julius Caesar. This myth is based on a misconception put forth in the 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia The Suda, which describes how Caesar had to be cut from the womb when his mother, Aurelia, died in her ninth month of pregnancy. This can’t be true, however, since Aurelia not only survived Caesar’s birth but went on to serve as his unofficial political advisor. It’s more likely that the medical procedure’s name comes from the Latin word caedere, meaning “to cut.”\n\nFilm Cred. Gabriel Pascal’s 1945 film Caesar and Cleopatra is an adaptation of Shaw’s play. The film stars Claude Rains as Caesar and Vivian Leigh as Cleopatra. Shaw was heavily involved in the film’s production."
