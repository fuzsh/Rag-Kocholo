        "text": "The Roman conqueror Julius Caesar (Claude Rains) takes over the Egyptian city of Alexandria, and in so doing inherits a pressing problem: in accordance to with local custom, the beautiful young princess Cleopatra (Vivien Leigh) and her even younger brother Ptolemy (Anthony Harvey) have been married and are to rule the country together, despite their competing desires to rule alone. Caesar takes Cleopatra under his wing, mentoring her in the uses of political power. Delivered sealed in case with artwork as shown on our page.\n\nStarring: Viven Leigh, Claude Rains, Stewart Granger\n\nViewer Review: \"Claude Rains is perfectly cast as the cynical, world-weary and \"ready for the knife\" Julius Caesar. And Vivian Leigh as Cleopatra, she has learned well at Caesar,s knee and possesses the ruthlessness and guile of statecraft - she is a queen. The cast is great, and the chemistry between all, especially Leigh & Rains, is superb -- as well as the sets and filming, too.\"\n\n2h, 3m\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nThis DVD is encoded NTSC Region ALL (playable worldwide).\n\nUsually ships in 1-3 days from the United States via USPS w/tracking."
