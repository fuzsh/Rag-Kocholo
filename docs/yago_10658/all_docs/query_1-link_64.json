        "text": "The film spin-off of the popular TV series Downton Abbey was released in the U.K. this Friday, September 13, and is due to be in the U.S. on September 20. The feature is directed by Michael Engler, based on a screenplay by the show's original creator Julian Fellowes.\n\nIn this special theater-released feature of Downton Abbey, the Crawley family find that King George V and Queen Mary have invited themselves to stay at theirs for one night for their royal tour of Yorkshire, a county in the north of England. This is of course no problem for the Crawleys, as it is the downstairs servants who must prepare everything.\n\nThe film is sure to be a crowd-pleaser for fans of the show as it follows directly from where the story was left off after the last series and its Christmas Special which aired in 2015.\n\nIt is now 1927, two years after the Christmas Special episode which marked the end of the last series. Mary and Tom (played by Michelle Dockery and Allen Leech respectively) are still in charge of the running of the estate. Mary is still married to Henry (played by Matthew Goode) but he is largely absent from the film, away on some business in the U.S. Edith, who is still married to Bertie Pelham, the Marquess of Hexham, is bored living in her castle in Northumberland and hosting dinners. She returns to Downton on invitation from her mother (Elizabeth McGovern) to attend the Royal visit. Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham (played splendidly by Maggie Smith) is still bickering with Isobel (Penelope Wilton, equally splendid).\n\nNothing has changed downstairs. Carson (played by Jim Carter) is still retired and married to Mrs Hughes (Phyllis Logan) who is still the head housekeeper. Barrow (Robert James-Collier) has settled in Carson’s place as the estate’s butler. Mrs Patmore (Lesley Nicol) is still the head cook with the help of Daisy (Sophie McShera) who still can’t decide whether to marry the footman Andrew Parker (Michael Fox).\n\nEverything is as was left after the Christmas Special. The beginning of the film, however, offers no recaps, no explanations as to who is who for those who may have not watched the series. The film starts on the assumption that the viewers know the show and are up to date with the storyline. With that said, even if you haven’t been watching the series, the film is pretty easy to follow, you just won’t have the backstories of each character.\n\nSo much time is spent relating the royal preparations that the two-hour long film spin-off of Downton Abbey felt almost like a dramatized guide, outlining the positive and negative sides, the do’s and don’ts, to hosting a Royal visit in one’s own grand house (for example, the silverware must be polished!). I jest, of course, but a little too much of the film was dedicated to the preparations and the unfolding of the dinner (in slow motion at times, which seemed a tad over the top). This new film is just as enjoyable and comforting as the TV series with its beautiful scenery, historical settings, and sweeping shots of Highclere Castle. Nothing much happens in this film, apart from the royal visit and a ball, which everyone keeps mentioning, reminding the viewers of its coming, but the film’s strong characterization holds everything together perfectly.\n\nDownstairs, everyone is excited (especially Molesley) about the visit of the royal couple, apart from Daisy who claims her indifference. All the excitement is somewhat dampened once the royal butler and housekeeper arrive with the royal servants to take their place. A rather unrealistic “coup” ensues in the downstairs’ quarters.\n\nA few subplots spring from the main plotline which are intriguing, but it felt like someone dipping their toe in the water and never plunging fully in. Barrow’s subplot, for example, demanded its own episode really, rather than be a dramatic side note, intercut within the royal dinner sequence.\n\nThis film special feels very much like two episodes stuck together, or a Christmas special. It is an exact continuation of the series, and so in a way I wish this would have been a whole new series, in which some of the subplots sketched could be expanded upon further. Did it really need to be shown in movie theaters? No, although the very subject, a Royal visit, makes it a nice touch that such an episode should be viewed on a bigger screen."
