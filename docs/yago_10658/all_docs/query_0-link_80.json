        "text": "Value Reading Articles Like This? Help Us Produce More\n\nThis site remains committed to providing local community news and public interest journalism.\n\nArticles such as the one above are integral to what we do. We aim to feature as much as possible on local societies, charities based in the area, fundraising efforts by residents, community-based initiatives and even helping people find missing pets.\n\nWe’ve always done that and won’t be changing, in fact we’d like to do more.\n\nHowever, the readership that these stories generates is often below that needed to cover the cost of producing them. Our financial resources are limited and the local media environment is intensely competitive so there is a constraint on what we can do.\n\nWe are therefore asking our readers to consider offering financial support to these efforts. Any money given will help support community and public interest news and the expansion of our coverage in this area.\n\nA suggested monthly payment is £8 but we would be grateful for any amount for instance if you think this site offers the equivalent value of a subscription to a daily printed newspaper you may wish to consider £20 per month. If neither of these amounts is suitable for you then contact info@neighbournet.com and we can set up an alternative. All payments are made through a secure web site.\n\nOne-off donations are also appreciated. Choose The Amount You Wish To Contribute.\n\nIf you do support us in this way we’d be interested to hear what kind of articles you would like to see more of on the site – send your suggestions to the editor."
