        "text": "The popular ITV drama Downton Abbey has had many a romantic story line.\n\nFrom Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley's winding road to the altar to the sweet pairing of Mr Bates and housemaid Anna, the halls of Highclere Castle were where several fictional relationships blossomed.\n\nHowever, away from the television cameras relationships between cast members also blossomed and in some cases the period drama was a chance for well established couples to act alongside each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Alec Baldwin contemplates what life is like in 'little town' Alton in new Instagram video\n\nPhyllis Logan and Kevin McNally\n\nThe character Mrs Hughes (played by Phyllis Logan) was the strict but fair housekeeper at Downton Abbey. In series two Logan acted alongside her husband Kevin McNally who portrayed Horace Bryant.\n\nBryant's son had an affair with one of the Downton maids (Ethel Perks played by Amy Nuttall) before dying in the First World War and leaving her pregnant.\n\nMrs Hughes acts as a go-between for Ethel and the Bryants who wish to take their grandchild from Ethel and raise him in a 'respectable' household.\n\nAfter falling on hard times Ethel agrees to give her son to his grandparents, but later moves nearby in the hopes of being part of his life.\n\nWhilst Logan and McNally met in 1994, they did not marry until 2011 - the same year that the character of Horace Bryant first appeared in Downton Abbey.\n\nHave your say on this story in the comments section.\n\nLaura Carmichael and Michael Fox\n\nSouthampton-born Laura Carmichael plays the second daughter of the Earl of Grantham in the Downton Abbey franchise.\n\nAlthough she experiences several failed relationships on the show the series did introduce Carmichael to her long term partner Michael C Fox, who played footman Andrew Parker.\n\nThe pair were romantically linked in 2016 and went on to co-star in the Downton Abbey film in 2019.\n\nBoth actors are set to reprise their roles for the film sequel, Downton Abbey: A New Era.\n\nJim Carson and Imelda Staunton\n\nCarter and Staunton have acted together a few times over the course of their 39-year marriage, including in 2007 when they performed alongside their daughter in an episode of Cranford.\n\nBut it was not until 2019 that the pair were seen together in Downton Abbey.\n\nCarson played the staunchly traditional butler in every series of Downton Abbey and reprised the character for the feature film.\n\nMeanwhile Staunton was cast as the queen's lady in waiting Lady Maud Bagshot.\n\nHer character was also the first cousin of the Earl of Grantham's late father but is estranged from the family because she refuses to name him heir to her estate.\n\nBecause of Carson being below stairs, the husband and wife didn’t share scenes in the film. However things could change in the upcoming sequel in which they are both set to appear.\n\nFind out how you can get more HampshireLive news straight to your inbox HERE .\n\nElizabeth McGovern and Simon Curtis\n\nElizabeth McGovern portrayed the Countess of Grantham since the series began.\n\nHer loyalty to husband Robert is made clear when she defends him after his failed investment in series three and when she forgives him for flirting with a maid.\n\nBut whilst McGovern and Bonneville have played a married couple on screen several times, in real life she is married to director Simon Curtis.\n\nCurtis is known for directing films such as My Week with Marilyn and A Short Stay in Switzerland.\n\nIn April 2021, it was announced that Curtis would direct Downton Abbey: A New Era."
