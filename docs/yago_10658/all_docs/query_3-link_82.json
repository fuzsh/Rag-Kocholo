        "text": "Despite 36 years in show business, it seems that actress Phyllis Logan has never quite escaped domestic service. Her first paying role was that of a maid, for which she earned 37 pounds.\n\nHere she is again, as the starchy Mrs. Hughes in service at \"Downton Abbey,\" which returns tonight for its new season on PBS.\n\nWhen Logan first read the part, she thought she'd have to assume a strange English accent. After all, Mrs. Hughes is the senior housekeeper of the estate, and all the \"downstairs\" people come from the blue-collar area of northern England.\n\nBut Logan is a Scot with a thick Scottish brogue, rolling her R's and stretching out her vowels. And a revolutionary thought occurred to her: Why not make Mrs. Hughes a Scot?\n\n\"So I read the part and looked at the scenes and I thought, 'Oh, this would also work quite well as a Scottish character,\" she says, looking nothing like Mrs. Hughes in gray chiffon with sequins and extinguishing an electronic cigarette.\n\n\"So when I was there, I went in and spoke to (the producer) and he said, 'Oh, you've got such a nice accent, maybe we should try Mrs. Hughes as Scottish.' I said, 'Well, funnily enough that you should say that, I was going through and thinking that the syntax of what she said, the type of person she was - I thought this could really work as a Scottish woman.' They were delighted and said, 'Yes, that's fine.'\"\n\nWhile she may be deft with serving trays and choosing the proper linen, her first meaty role was that of a lady of England's aristocracy in the detective series \"Lovejoy,\" with Ian McShane. That followed with roles in almost every popular British crime series there is, including \"Wallander,\" Mike Leigh's \"Secrets & Lies\" and, of course, \"Downton Abbey.\"\n\nThough she participated in school plays and joined the film club as a teen, the idea of acting for a living never occurred to her until a friend suggested she try out for drama school.\n\n\"Because I came from a small town outside Glasgow, nobody from my school had ever gone into the acting profession. It was just something you didn't do,\" she shrugs. \"You joined the bank or became a teacher or whatever you did. I suggested it to my career adviser who said, 'No' — basically, 'Why would you want to do that, you'll never get the grades?' He was talking about being a drama teacher and that's not what I was talking about.\"\n\nShe ignored him, sent for a prospectus to drama school in Glasgow and auditioned her way in. Her parents thought she was a bit loony, she says.\n\n\"Not so my mum, but I think my dad just thought, 'That's not a job.' Sadly, my father died before I graduated so he didn't see any of the success, at all. And my mum, bless her, who just died two years ago, she was very happy. I think she was proud of me.\"\n\nLogan's Scottish accent first intruded when she was studying drama. \"We were always told we had to get rid of our Scottish accent. You need to start off with what they call RP — Received Pronunciation, that's what they do on the BBC ... I didn't really buy that idea at all. So when I first did 'Lovejoy' and was playing a very upper-class lady, I went to the interview and spoke like that and they gave me the part and I thought, 'When am I going to break it to them that THIS is how I sound?'\"\n\nExcept for a very brief stint working for tips as a hat-check girl, Logan has never had another job, nor has she ever wanted to quit acting. \"It's true as a woman particularly, the older you get the parts get thinner on the ground and not quite as interesting, that's for sure,\" she sighs.\n\n\"People are trying and I think maybe the industry is waking up to the fact that women can be funny in comedies and can be in hit films.\"\n\nWed to actor Kevin McNally (Gibbs in \"The Pirates of the Caribbean\" series), Logan says she never intended to marry an actor, and they took their time about it. \"I'm the first to say I would never have had one in the house,\" she says. \"But you can't legislate love. We've been together for 20 years. We met on a job, some television thing years ago. But we didn't really get together on the job, at all. We'd known each other, but I thought he was a bit of an arrogant twit, but there's so much more to him.\"\n\nThey have a 17-year-old son, David. Motherhood at 40 changed her, she says. \"When somebody's calling you mommy, it's a wonderful thing. But also to have that responsibility and to know that you and your partner have this little thing that's totally relying on you - and it made me, I suppose, less selfish. Not that I was mega-selfish to start with, but it's lovely having that responsibility. It's scary.\"\n\nDeath and taxes dominate the opening episodes of the new fourth season of \"Downton Abbey.\" Six months after the death of the heir, Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens), in a car accident, the future of the great house, land and family are still in turmoil. But change is in the air both above stairs and below. In the first minutes of the first episode, a main character leaves, and what happens will usher in events that will affect the entire household. The new season is set in the 1920s, when many of society's conventions of the past were being broken, especially for women. Matthew's widow, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), is still frozen in depression. Mary's sister Edith (Laura Carmichael) has become a writer, independent of her family and attracting the attention of her married editor. The youthful feeling of rebellion is summed up in Downton's visitor, Lady Rose MacClare (Lily James), who loves to dance to the new music, but sometimes in inappropriate company for her social standing. The men are locked in the battle over the future of the estate. Tom Branson (Allen Leech), the Irish chauffeur who married Mary's late sister Sybil, is at odds with the lord of the manor - Robert, Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonneville). The servants downstairs deal not only with the death above, but the exit of a major character. And Branson's daughter, Sybil, and Matthew's son, George, now have a new nanny who runs afoul of the staff. TISH WELLS, MCCLATCHY WASHINGTON BUREAU\n\nWHERE SEASON 4 BEGINS"
