        "text": "Phyllis Logan plays the role of stalwart housekeeper, Mrs Hughes, whose engagement to Carson (Jim Carter) provided the happy ending to last year's Downton Christmas Special.\n\nFamiliar to many as Lady Jane Felsham in the long-running series Lovejoy, Logan has also starred in Mike Leigh's Secrets & Lies, Silent Witness and every good British TV staple, from Holby City to A Touch of Frost.\n\nWe spoke to her about Michelle Obama, Jim Carter's crying and finally getting to see her husband (actor Kevin McNally) now it's all over.\n\nWhat was your reaction when you got the first scripts for this last series, in terms of what Julian’s (Fellowes, creator of Downton Abbey) done?\n\nWe didn’t actually get the whole scripts at first. In fact, we didn't get the last one that long ago. The denouement, as it were. I’m happy with what season six brings to Mrs Hughes – or what Mrs Hughes brings to season six. I’m very happy with that. Julian doesn’t disappoint in that department.\n\nWho was the most emotional, at the end of filming?\n\nI think the crew. There were a couple of very butch crew members who were sobbing.\n\nAnd out of the cast?\n\nWe’re all as bad as each other, aren’t we? We all cried. But I didn’t think I was going to. When Jim Carter suddenly cracked a little, that sent us all off. And we felt relieved. We thought, if he can do it, so can the rest of us.\n\nWhat’re you going to do next?\n\nNext? I’ve no idea what I’m going to do next, apart from just have a bit of fun. Not that I didn’t have fun [on this job], but I’m going to see my husband, which I didn’t do for a long time. All sorts. It’s going to be lovely. Housework, probably. Seeing friends and family, I suppose, is a thing that you’re not able to do so much of.\n\n\"I’m happy with what season six brings to Mrs Hughes – or what Mrs Hughes brings to season six...\"\n\nDoes every character get a good ending?\n\nYes, definitely. That applies to nearly everbody, but not always in the way that you would imagine, I suppose.\n\nObviously, it’s globally hugely successful. Who are the most famous people who’ve come up to you, and said they were fans?\n\nWhen we went to the American embassy dinner for Thanksgiving, Michelle Obama sent a message to all of us. Yeah, that was really nice. And we had Anthony Hopkins saying he’s a huge fan, and who else? The Duke of - what's his name? Prince William. He gave us a tribute as well, up on the screen, because he loves the show, and Kate (Middleton) loves the show.\n\nDid you get to work with George Clooney, when he was involved?\n\nYes. Excuse me while I go into a swoon.\n\nYou’re still swooning even now?\n\nWell, he’s just staggeringly beautiful. But what a gentleman! And what a sport! He stayed there all day. He just put himself into the whole thing, stayed and chatted with the crew. He was delightful to everybody. He’s a man. He’s a Leg End. A legend. Phil, who was directing it, he said at one point he wanted him (Clooney) to take Elizabeth into a traditional sort of… sort of scoop her off feet. And he said, “But hey Phil, I got a question – I don’t know if I can manage to do that sitting.” But Phil said, “for God’s sake, you’re George Clooney”, and he said “you’re right.” So he was willing to take the mick out of himself, you know what I mean? What a guy. What a guy...\n\nDownton Abbey begins its final series on Sunday Sept 20, ITV, 9.00pm"
