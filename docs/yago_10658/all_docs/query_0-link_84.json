        "text": "Amovie saga as iconic as 'Pirates of the Caribbean' owes much of its success to memorable characters.\n\nWhile Johnny Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow drew considerable attention, the franchise would have lacked its depth without Kevin McNally's portrayal of Joshamee Gibbs, Sparrow's loyal companion.\n\nMcNally, an American actor, appears to have distanced himself from the franchise, although it remains a fact that their careers are intertwined beyond the realm of fiction.\n\nMcNally was recently arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of domestic violence, as reported by The Sun.\n\nThe 'Pirates of the Caribbean' star was in the coastal city for a 'Doctor Who' convention, a BBC series in which he also had a role. The Sun reported that the arrest was related to an alleged traumatic injury inflicted on his former wife, the mother of his child.\n\nDetails of the incident are unclear\n\nPhyllis Logan, McNally's current wife, has stated that she is unaware of the details of the arrest or the identity of the alleged victim.\n\nMcNally was also accompanied by Stevie Harris, with whom he shares two children. The actor was released from custody after posting a 45,000-dollar bond and has chosen not to comment on the charges against him. He is scheduled to appear in court in a month's time to face trial for the alleged domestic violence.\n\nKevin McNally supported Johnny Depp during his legal battle with Amber Heard, in which Depp was accused of domestic violence. This high-profile case has been one of the most publicized trials in recent Hollywood history."
