        "text": "Kevin McNally made a surprise appearance on Good Morning Britain on Friday, after he decided to gatecrash his wife Phyllis Logan’s TV interview.\n\nPhyllis had been on the ITV breakfast show to discuss the new series of Highland Vet which she narrates, but was interrupted by her famous husband who stormed over in his dressing gown.\n\nSurprising both his Downton Abbey star wife and host Lorraine Kelly, Kevin joked: ‘Can you keep it down? I’m trying to sleep.’\n\n‘Oh, look who it is! How are you, Kevin? It’s so good to see you,’ Lorraine said.\n\nShe was seen launching into a fit of giggles and couldn’t resist commenting on the fact that Kevin was in his robe, as she teased: ‘I love that dressing gown.’\n\nSitting down for a quick chat, after Phyllis had moved over to let her husband in shot, Kevin joked about the couple racking up their wine bill in lockdown before quickly retreating into another room.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean actor and Phyllis have been married since 2011 and the pair starred alongside each other on Downton Abbey.\n\nKevin played Horace Bryant in the show’s second and third series, while Phyllis is known for portraying Elsie May Carson (Mrs Hughes) in the period drama.\n\nPhyllis had also discussed the possibility of a Downton Abbey making another movie – following the release of the show’s film in 2019.\n\nShe revealed that while most of the cast would be on board, they are still very much in the dark over whether a follow-up film is in the making.\n\n‘I remember you asking me this the first time and I could tell you nothing, it’s much the same,’ Phyllis teased.\n\n‘We’d love to do another one, but of course things are so tricky at the moment, there may be moves afoot, but who knows. We’ll find out in due course.’\n\nInsisting she’d be keen, Phyllis added: ‘Fingers crossed it does.’\n\nGood Morning Britian airs weekdays from 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : James Gandolfini once threatened to ‘beat the f*** out of’ Harvey Weinstein"
