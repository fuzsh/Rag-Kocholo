        "text": "Given the era - series six is set in the 1925 - such conversations would never have taken place. However, in Downton viewers watched as a series of awkward conversations took place between Mrs Hughes, Carson and Mrs Patmore as the go-between.\n\n“I thoroughly enjoyed doing all those scenes with both Leslie and Jim, they did brilliantly. But what a funny storyline and what a friend Mrs Patmore is that she actually did that for Mrs Hughes,” Phyllis said.\n\nSeries six will see a change in fortunes for the Crawleys as the grand old houses and aristocracy starts to buckle under social mobility as the time change. But it appears that faithful butler Carson remains a stalwart to the old way and the traditions of serving.\n\nDespite the changes going on around him, Phyllis admitted that Mrs Hughes would have trouble trying to modernise her new husband: “I don’t think even Mrs Hughes is able to drag him into the 20th Century.”\n\nSeries six will be the final series of the critically acclaimed Julian Fellowes’ drama and the doors of the Abbey will be shutting for the last time this Christmas with a special to round things off.\n\nDownton Abbey continues on ITV on Sundays."
