        "text": "Downton Abbey couple Jim Carter and Phyllis Logan open up on real-life relationship when the cameras aren't rolling\n\nJim Carter and Phyllis Logan (aka Mr. Carson and Mrs. Hughes) dished the dirt to us in an exclusive interview that you can read in full in this week's print edition.\n\nThe nation was bowled over when a certain butler and housekeeper tied the knot in season six of Downton Abbey back in 2015. Mr. Carson (Jim Carter) and Mrs Hughes’ (Phyllis Logan) marriage was undoubtedly one of the highlights of the 52 episodes of the hit ITV drama.\n\nAs the DVD and Blu-Ray release of the period drama’s debut film looms, we caught up with Jim and Phyllis to quiz them about what it was like making the film some four years after filming wrapped up on the show...\n\n“Getting back together was like slipping back into the same old clothes,” Jim told us. “There was a feeling that this film might be the last!”\n\nThe pair may play a convincing couple on screen, but both actors actually have recognisable spouses…\n\nJim has been married for nearly four decades to actress Harry Potter star Imelda Staunton and Phyllis lives in west London with her husband of nine years, Pirates Of The Caribbean actor Kevin McNally.\n\n\"Do you socialise with other members of the cast outside work?\" we asked.\n\nJim answers first: \"I go out on hot dates with Mrs Hughes, Mrs Patmore, and Daisy the maid! We have hot dinner dates, don’t we Phyllis?\"\n\n\"Yes, except I missed the last one because I was working,\" offers up Phyllis.\n\n\"Yeah, you were working,\" replied Jim. \"So Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol), Daisy (Sophie McShera) and I could talk about you...\"\n\n\"I was furious!\" jokes Phyllis.\n\nWe had to know, so we asked... Where do you go on these dates?\n\n\"A nice quiet little restaurant,\" revealed Jim. Neither worry too much about being recognised, especially not Phyllis. \"I don’t get recognised that much. They notice Jim mostly, he’s quite unmistakable!\"\n\n\"When they hear the voice, that alerts them. Then they see the nose and the eyebrows and I’ve had it,\" he laughs.\n\n\"I had something lovely happen to me recently,\" Jim reveals when we quizzed him about what his fans are like. \"We went to a Q&A event, and there was a guy in the audience who was shaking with nerves. He told us that he was severely autistic and he had made a film about growing up with autism in Ireland with the love of the local community.”\n\n“He said, “Men like Mr Carson have been so important in my life, because their kindness has helped me survive. I have made a film and I want to thank Mr Carson who I think helped me make the film.” I thought, 'Oh, my God!'. It was really brilliant – he’s given me the DVD and I still write to him.\"\n\n\"I had dinner with Dame Maggie the other night,\" Jim tells us when we ask about his famous co-star. \"She was on top form! Maggie’s a legend and I worry that when her generation go... will they ever be replaced? I don’t know that they ever will because the world has changed.\""
