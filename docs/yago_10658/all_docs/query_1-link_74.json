        "text": "Rating: 9/10\n\nIt is a very well-known fact that I own the title to the biggest Downton Abbey fan that has ever lived. I adore everything about the show – how very British everything is, a look back into a lost era and the class systems. That and the excellent costume design, dramatic sequences and veiled sarcasm that only the British can manage? The show was designed for me. Downton Abbey came around at a time where I was desperately tired of the vulgarity of shows like Game of Thrones – yes, shoot me, I know there is an enormous fan base, but is anyone else tired of it? It has no class and it has no style and senseless violence.\n\nAnyway, now that I’m done sounding like a pompous little prick, let me tell you what I loved about Season 6 of Downton Abbey. Clue: Nearly everything.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nAnna and Bates. These two have had so many plights throughout the show that I’d been thoroughly exasperated at the end of Season 5. Like can they just stop being accused of killing people or stealing or whatever?! Sheesh. The season ended so sweet for them that this I was willing to cry of happiness for them. I was.\n\nMr. Carson and Mrs. Hughes. Everyone knew they should marry because Mrs. Hughes is the only one on earth that can sass Mr. Carson right back. I loved this entire story arc and they managed to pull it off in such a way that it wasn’t fake or annoying and just seemed so lovely that two people could find love nearing the end of their lives.\n\nEdith and her Bertie. Oh, Edith. How you’ve grown on me. Arguably the most beleaguered character ever, frequently by her own design, but Edith Crawley somewhere grew a backbone and received a purpose in life. I loved her Bertie too – here was a man tailor made for her, kind, caring, and could properly assess the complexity of her relationship with her surviving sister. Their wedding is the most romantic thing I’ve seen since Mary and Matthew’s wedding SOB SOB SOB.\n\nMary’s incredibly attractive new counterpart, Henry Talbot (Matthew Goode). Where has this man been all my life?! Mary made me so angry. I’ve always been a Mary fan but when she nearly messed up Edith’s life (AGAIN), I was legitimately pissed at her. In my mind the best version of Mary will always be the woman she was when she was married to Matthew, but I found that Henry Talbot had all the wonderful characteristics of my beloved Matthew and could influence her as well. And I reiterate – Matthew Goode is so beautiful.\n\nThe darling boy they cast as Matthew Crawley’s son – it ripped out my still bleeding heart but that child could really be the child of Dan Stevens.\n\nTom returning – let’s face it, everyone loves Tom the most.\n\nHow perfectly happy everything ended. Some people will roll their eyes at how tidily every arc was wrapped up and how everyone got their happiness.\n\nI’m mentioning Edith’s wedding again. The happiness. The romance. How deserving she was of her big moment.\n\nThe new puppy – awwwwww\n\nWhat I didn’t like:\n\nSpratt and Denker. I don’t know why these two got so much time in the show. Their quarrels were annoying and silly and it really grated on me.\n\nDaisy. The character has always been a hit and miss for me but she truly grated on my nerves in the final season. She comes across as an ungrateful and immature child, and I just wanted to smack the petulance out of her.\n\nThat big fright with Lord Crawley’s health scare. DON’T DO THAT TO ME AGAIN, DOWNTON.\n\nWell, there you have it. My favorite show has come to an end. I will always rewatch this show and even though I am sad that it has ended, I applaud Julian Fellows for stopping while they were ahead. Gosh Downton, I’m going to miss you.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nThe entire cast: Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern, Michelle Dockery, Dan Stevens, Maggie Smith, Laura Carmichael, Jim Carter, Dan Stevens and Phyllis Logan (to name just a few) does a phenomenal task with the material they have. The cast works together perfectly and has an intimate connection that gives the impression that Downton Abbey is a real place with real people living in it.\n\nThe portrayal of the war. It was ever present with so many of the young men away all the time, but it never completely overshadowed the main plots. I thought it was excellently depicted and the filming of the war scenes was really well done.\n\nRobert’s frustration at being a poster boy for the war but not being able to take part. I LOVE Robert. There is something he did that made me so angry at him but overall I really like his character. I’ve been on a rampage lately that older men and women should always feel like they still have a part to play in society when they retire, and Robert’s frustration at the “there-there” condescending nature of his superiors really highlighted the fact.\n\nLavinia Swire. I really enjoyed the character even though her sole purpose was to keep my two favourites apart from each other.\n\nThat dance scene with Matthew and Mary. Are all British women so wonderfully contained? If Dan Stevens danced with me like that and looked at me like that I would have passed out on the scene.\n\nSybil and Tom. I LOVE both of them so much ❤ ❤\n\nThe Christmas episode and the proposal. GAWSHHHHH ❤\n\nWhat I didn’t like\n\nEthel. This whole storyline seemed so unnecessary and preposterous. I didn’t like the character’s entitled attitude and even though I had sympathy with her plight, what did she actually think would happen??\n\nIsobel Crawley. What an annoying woman. She started out as quite entertaining and I enjoy her banter with the Dowager Countess, but her perstering attitude quickly got old.\n\nThe resurfacing of Patrick Crawley – it also had no point only to highlight Edith’s persistent desire to keep herself unhappy.\n\nBates and Anna. I love these two and their story but sheesh it gets really melodramatic in this season!\n\nOverall this was a phenomenal season. I am so ridiculously addicted to this show it is not even funny. Even when I’m mad at the characters (I get hopelessly invested) I still can’t turn myself away!\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nThe humor: It is plentiful, intelligent, sharp, everywhere and of a higher quality that entertainment produces as a usual standard. It is dry wit properly used. I can’t get enough of it.\n\nI now know that it is pronounced “Downton Abbey” and not “Downtown Abbey”\n\nThe costume design is gorgeous and suitable to the periodical setting\n\nThe estate – just wow. It is absolutely gorgeous and such a strong structure. I don’t often freak out about many buildings – architecture is not my greatest passion but I can really get behind a beautiful structure if it appeals to me. It was even more fascinating that this is a real holding and not just a magnificent prop stage.\n\nThe depiction of relationships between upper, middle and lower class is keeping me really intrigued. All the sides are really well developed and gets proper show time. The Class system remains one of the most amusing hierarchical systems in the world. It is not really prevalent in South-Africa so I cannot imagine how people would willingly subject to such forms of oppression. It is interesting though, and the clear line between the classes even while they are still perfectly civil to each other.\n\nMaggie Smith slays. Just WOW. This role is so worthy of her time. The dry sarcasm, the disdain, her supreme lack of care of what people think of her, that entire character she brings so authentically to life. She’s my idol. That’s all.\n\nThere are some characters I love and some I dislike, but every cast member does a wonderful job. The characters I dislike are purely because they were written for that exact reason – as antagonists. The characters I love the most: Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens), who I can easily devote this entire post too, Mary Crawley (Michelle Dockery), whose sad and intriguing lifestyle I can think days about, John Bates (Brendan Coyle) – THAT FIRST SAD EPISODE WTF, The Lord Crawley, who has such a loyal heart and works so hard to save his inheritance.\n\nTheo James, I am so sorry. HAHAHA. My demented sense of humor was way too tickled about what happened to the Middle-Eastern prince when he visited Downton. It is just…. HAHAHA. The ramifications of how that poor girl must have felt. (Not disclosing who though #notospoilers). You are absolutely gorgeous though, sir.\n\nThat kiss. OMFG I nearly went through the roof. It is so beautiful and proper and appropriate and introduced on the perfect time in the story.\n\nDan Stevens and his eyes. I get really irritated when people harp on other people’s pretty eyes. It seems so… false. But Dan Stevens has eyes that make me finally understand that sentiment of carrying on about it. It’s so blue and gorgeous and when he focuses on something… just hold me back haha. ❤ ❤ I also love the character that he plays. Matthew Crawley has the biggest heart and the most common sense, and I just adore his determination to stay true to who he is.\n\nI really mostly liked all of it. The pilot episode is the weakest but it is still very good and the show picks up pace and character as it progresses through the season. It remains such an extremely cultured experience to watch, that I kid you not, I wore stockings the next day to work as a testimony of my adoration and desire to be part of 1912’s England. I really do dislike two of the characters, not for their acting, because it is wonderfully good and exceeds in making their characters exactly as unlikable as they were created to be. The relationship between Edith and Mary has so many complex layers and is quite satisfying to watch. I really sympathize with both of them – Mary has such a daunting task that goes against every grain of her personality and poor Edith is always found lacking next to her two absurdly pretty and charming sisters. They both did something that made me shake my head in exasperation – sisters should never fight like that. I see both of their sides and the vindictiveness of their actions – it’s horrid but there is an element of reason to what they do.\n\nThis is truly a wonderful show and enormous amounts of fun. It might be somewhat chaste to people who like things constantly bawdy (hey, not judging, I enjoy bawdy fun too), but it is such a lovely experience watching this DownTON Abbey and I can’t wait to get through the rest.:)"
