        "text": "Pirates of the Caribbean actor Kevin McNally was arrested on suspicion of 'domestic violence' last week, with him said to have since been released on bail in the US, it has been reported.\n\nThe actor, 67 - who is best known for his role as Joshamee Gibbs in the film series - was reportedly arrested on Friday, prior to his scheduled appearance at annual Doctor Who convention Gallifrey One, which was held in Los Angeles.\n\nMcNally - who first appeared on the beloved BBC show in 1984 before returning as a different character in 2021 - is said to have since been released on bail of £40,000 and is due in court next month.\n\nAccording to the Sun, McNally was arrested on suspicion of 'domestic violence' in the early hours of Friday. It was announced later that day by organisers of fan convention Gallifrey One that he would be \"unable\" to attend the event.\n\nThe outlet adds that police in Los Angeles have said that McNally was \"held on suspicion of inflicting an injury that caused a traumatic condition on a victim who was his current or former spouse, cohabitant, or child’s parent\". Police however are said to have declined to give details of his alleged victim, citing confidentiality rules.\n\nIt's also been reported that McNally's wife, fellow actor Phyllis Logan, 68, denied knowing about his arrest when approached at his family home in the UK over the weekend. McNally and Logan - who have worked together on ITV's Downton Abbey - are understood to have been married since 2011.\n\nThe Mirror has reached out to the LAPD and McNally's reps for comment.\n\nFor confidential support, call the 24-hour National Domestic Abuse Freephone Helpline on 0808 2000 247 or visit womensaid.co.uk If you or your family have lost a friend or family member through fatal domestic abuse, AAFDA (Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse) can offer specialist and expert support and advocacy.
