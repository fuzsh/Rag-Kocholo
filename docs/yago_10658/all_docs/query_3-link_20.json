        "text": "Logan was never married to Paul Pender. They lived together for four years and broke up after 11years. She only has one child, son David, with actor Kevin McNally.\n\nSadly, my father died before I graduated, so he didn't see any of the success at all.\n\nI am not much of a TV addict, and if I have a day off, and I'm pottering around at home, I will always listen to Radio 4."
