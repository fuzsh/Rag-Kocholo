        "text": "…is an actress, best known for her roles as Lady Jane Felsham in Lovejoy and Mrs Hughes in Downton Abbey. She lives in Chiswick with her family. he was younger. If it was a rainy day, we would watch Singing In The Rain together, or perhaps ‘Mary Pop’, as my son would call it.\n\nWhat are you working on at the moment?\n\nThe play Switzerland – it’s a brilliant psychological thriller by Joanna Murray-Smith about the eccentric novelist Patricia Highsmith. We performed the UK premiere earlier this year at Theatre Royal Bath and it’s so exciting to revisit. I’m finding time to rehearse it while filming the Downton Abbey movie, which has been such fun.\n\nWhen are you at your happiest?\n\nCatching up with my husband – we’re often working, so when we have an evening together we’ll cook a nice dinner and enjoy it over a glass of wine.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nI worry for my son – that he’s happy. I hope his life is going to be gorgeous.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nI’m struggling to do up my little woollen pink shoes, but my chubby three-year-old fingers can’t work the little button.\n\nWhat do you dislike about yourself?\n\nI like to be in control – I’m trying to get better.\n\nWho has been your greatest influence?\n\nMy parents. They make up your biggest memories, which stick with you throughout your whole life.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nI’m trying to declutter and feng shui myself by not keeping hold of lots of stuff.\n\nWhat trait do you most deplore in others?\n\nMeanness. I can’t stand people who are ungenerous. We have a Scottish saying: ‘Someone who would peel an orange in his pocket.’\n\nDo you have any pets?\n\nMy beloved lurcher, Carlos. Sadly he died several years ago, but he’s irreplaceable. He loved his home comforts.\n\nFavourite book?\n\nThe Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller. Greek history with a modern spin, very beautifully written.\n\nFavourite film?\n\nI love Bette Davis. One of my favourites of her films is All About Eve. I could watch that on a loop. It’s all about personalities and, like Switzerland, it’s a psychological thriller. But there’s also the two movies my son used to request when he was younger. If it was a rainy day, we would watch Singing In The Rain together, or perhaps ‘Mary Pop’, as my son would call it.\n\nFavourite piece of music?\n\nPachelbel’s Canon in D Major – I remember hearing it when my dad died when I was 20 and it has always stuck with me. It’s a sad piece, but it has an uplifting feeling, too. Somehow it enhances your sadness, in a good way.\n\nFavourite meal?\n\nI love Thai food, but unfortunately my husband does not. You can’t beat a traditional Sunday roast with chicken… but I’m also mad for pasta.\n\nWho would you most like to come to dinner?\n\nMy husband. I always vowed not to have an actor in the house, but you can’t legislate for love.\n\nWhat is the nastiest thing anyone has ever said to you?\n\nIn Harry Hook’s film, The Kitchen Toto, I played Janet Graham, the wife of a police officer (Bob Peck). One critic said I looked like Stanley Baxter!\n\nDo you believe in aliens?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat is your secret vice?\n\nStrictly Come Dancing, although it’s very popular, so I’m not sure you could call it a vice.\n\nDo you write thank you notes?\n\nI used to. Most of the time I probably don’t now, to my shame.\n\nWhich phrase do you most overuse?\n\n‘You know what I mean?’\n\nWhat single thing would improve the quality of your life?\n\nIf people weren’t so rude.\n\nTell us something people might not know about you.\n\nI was sports champion of my primary school.\n\nWhat would you like your epitaph to say?\n\nI’d have to borrow a line from my favourite writer, Jessie Kesson. The inscription on the tombstone would read: ‘HERE, VERY MUCH AGAINST HER WILL, LIES…’"
