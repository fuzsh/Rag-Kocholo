E! News has reached out to Michelle's rep for comment and has not heard back.\n\nThe wedding took place more than seven years after the actress' previous fiancé John Dineen died at age 34 following a cancer battle.\n\nThe bride, 41, wore a white, sleeveless, drop-waist, square-neck satin Emilia Wickstead gown with a long train and long veil to the ceremony, as seen in photos posted by the Daily Mail, which first reported news of her nuptials. Jasper, 35, wore a navy suit."
