        "text": "Downton Abbey's Phyllis Logan has revealed the real-life chemistry behind the on-screen marriage between housekeeper Mrs Hughes and butler Carson.\n\nThe pair were a key part of Julian Fellowes' ITV hit from the very first series in 2010, running the downstairs staff during the dramatic events of six seasons and now two movies.\n\nThe slow-burning romance finally blossomed when Carson proposed to Mrs Hughes in the 2014 Christmas special watched by 9.7 million TV viewers.\n\nPaisley-born Phyllis, 66, says that her co-star Jim Carter was aware of the potential for romance between the two much-loved characters before she was.\n\nShe told the Daily Mail's Weekend magazine: \"Jim kept saying to me that people in the street would say to him, 'When are you and Mrs Hughes going to get together?' I didn't think it would work but when I read Julian's [Fellowes] scripts about the lead-up to it, I thought, 'It's beautiful, so yes this has to happen.'\"\n\nJim, 73, added: \"Carson and Mrs Hughes would enjoy a sherry together at the end of the day, and we both relished those moments. Phyllis and I work well together and we're fond of each other. So that helped inform the chemistry of the longest-burning romance in TV history.\"\n\nNow the couple are back in Downton Abbey: A New Era, in which Carson joins Crawley family on a trip to France while a Hollywood film crew takes over the hall.\n\nJim laughed: \"There's a bedroom scene with Mrs Hughes before he goes, where she's starting to fall asleep and I'm reading - in horror - a travel guide to France. That's about as sexy as we get.\"\n\nPhyllis added: \"We're very happy we got together, but now there's a bit more carping and sniping between the characters, which is a classic marriages.\n\n\"Mrs Hughes loves Carson because he has great attributes, but she also has to accept he's a bit of an old curmudgeon.\""
