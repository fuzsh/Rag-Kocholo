Have an account? .\n\nThe second \"Downton Abbey\" movie, \"Downton Abbey: A New Era,\" premieres on Friday.\n\nThe series originally premiered in the UK in September 2010. It aired in the US a few months later.\n\nHere's how the cast of \"A New Era\" has changed since their first appearance on the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHugh Bonneville has played Robert Crawley, The Earl of Grantham, since the first episode of season one in 2010.\n\nAs the head of the Crawley household and the agent of Downton Abbey (at the beginning of the show), Robert takes his responsibilities very seriously.\n\nThe series begins with Robert finding out the heir to Downton, his cousin, died in the sinking of the Titanic. Much of the first season focuses on Robert's attempts to keep Downton in the family, as his three daughters cannot inherit the estate.\n\nBy the 2022 film \"Downton Abbey: A New Era,\" Robert has stepped down from running the estate.\n\nDuring the events of the second film, which takes place in 1928, Robert finds out that his mother Violet, the Dowager Countess, has inherited a villa in southern France. In order to get to the bottom of the mystery of why his mother was given the villa, Robert travels to France, leaving the care of Downton in his daughter Mary and son-in-law Tom's hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis wife, Cora, is played by Elizabeth McGovern. She also debuted in the first episode.\n\nMcGovern is the lone American in the cast of \"Downton Abbey,\" as she plays a US heiress, Cora, who Robert married in order to secure Downton's financial future. However, the two ended up actually falling in love and having a happy marriage which produced three daughters.\n\nMcGovern returns for \"A New Era,\" accompanying her husband in his journey to France.\n\nShe's now the grandmother of multiple grandchildren and, as usual, is on hand to support her husband and daughters in their various adventures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichelle Dockery has played Mary Crawley (now Talbot) since the first episode.\n\nIn the first episode of \"Downton,\" Mary is dealing with the death of her fiancé and cousin, who died on the Titanic.\n\nThroughout the first few seasons, her relationship with another distant cousin, Matthew Crawley (played by Dan Stevens) was one of the biggest plotlines in the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary is now married to Henry Talbot, and she co-runs the estate with her brother-in-law, Tom.\n\nMary married Talbot (Matthew Goode) in the last season of \"Downton.\" By the second movie, the two are still married, but her husband is busy traveling the world — in real life, Goode couldn't be in the film due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nWhile her sister Edith, brother-in-law Tom, and parents travel to France, Mary stays behind to supervise the production of a movie being filmed at their estate while dodging the advances of its director, played by Hugh Dancy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary's younger sister Edith Crawley (now Pelham) has been played by Laura Carmichael since the first episode.\n\nEdith began the series as the oft-overlooked middle Crawley sister and remains unlucky in love throughout the series — she was both left at the altar and essentially widowed when her fiancé died (and she was then-pregnant with his illegitimate child).\n\nShe eventually finds love with Bertie Pelham. They got married during season six.\n\nEdith and her husband Bertie welcomed their first child together in the first \"Downton Abbey\" film.\n\nEdith accompanies her parents on their journey to France, along with her husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe breakout character of the entire show, of course, is Maggie Smith's Dowager Countess Violet, Robert's mother. She is also introduced in the series premiere.\n\nViolet is easily the funniest character on \"Downton,\" as her sharp wit never fails to make us laugh. Her schemes, while a tad conniving, always come from a love of her family and her ancestral home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the beginning of \"A New Era,\" Violet reveals she has a mysterious past that her family doesn't know about.\n\nAt the end of the first film, Violet revealed to her granddaughter Mary that she had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and wasn't sure how much time she had left. But when \"A New Era\" picks up, Violet is still among the living — and actually has inherited a villa in the south of France.\n\nViolet decides to leave the villa to her great-granddaughter and asks her son, daughter-in-law, granddaughter, and grandson-in-law to take stock of the home. While there, Robert discovers that his ancestry might not be what he thought it was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Crawley's longtime butler, Mr. Carson, has been played by Jim Carter since the first episode.\n\nCarson has been part of the Grantham estate for almost his entire life, as his father was the head groom, and Carson started out as a junior footman. By the time the show starts, Carson is the head of all of the male servants and is a trusted confidante of Robert and his daughter, Mary.\n\nThroughout the series, fans watched the relationship between Carson and the Crawley's housekeeper, Mrs. Hughes, develop. They got engaged during the season five Christmas special and were wed in season six.\n\nDuring the series finale, Carson is finally forced to retire due to a health condition.\n\nAfter being brought back into service during the first movie, Carson is back at Downton for the second film.\n\nAlong with making the journey to France with some of the Crawley family, Carson is also brought back to the estate at Mary's request to train a new butler.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhyllis Logan has played Mrs. Hughes (now Mrs. Carson) since the first episode.\n\nMrs. Hughes starts off the show as the head housekeeper at the estate, and essentially the most important opinion in all things happening \"downstairs\" with the servants — not even Carson likes to do things without Mrs. Hughes' approval.\n\nThe new Mrs. Carson is still working at Downton in the new film.\n\nAfter being very stressed out about the royal visit in the first \"Downton Abbey\" film, Mrs. Carson (née Hughes) now has to contend with a film shooting at the estate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the series premiere's storylines is the introduction of Mr. Bates, played by Brendan Coyle, to Downton Abbey as a new valet to Robert.\n\nBates and Robert first served together in the army, which is why Robert feels obligated to hire him and keep him on staff, despite an injured leg that many of the fellow servants believe makes him unsuitable for the work. However, he proves them all wrong and becomes a beloved member of the staff.\n\nBates also falls in love with a fellow employee, Anna, the head housemaid. Their up-and-down relationship is the focus of many a storyline. They married in season two and had their first child in the series finale.\n\nNot much is known about Bates' plot in the 2022 sequel, but he is seen in the trailer with his wife and son.\n\nAfter the drama that those two endured in the original show, they deserve a relaxing time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis on-screen wife, Anna, is played by Joanne Froggatt.\n\nAt first, Anna is the only person at Downton who is kind to Bates when he arrives, and the two share a special bond that eventually progresses into love.\n\nAnna also proves herself as a maid and is promoted to lady's maid for Mary during the course of the series.\n\nAnna was also at the center of one of \"Downton Abbey's\" most controversial storylines when she is sexually assaulted by a visiting valet during season four.\n\nFroggatt returns in \"A New Era\" as a new mother to her and Mr. Bates' son.\n\nThere's not much to go off in the trailer for Anna, but there are a few shots of her looking happy — thankfully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the most polarizing characters on \"Downton Abbey\" is Thomas Barrow, played by Robert James-Collier since the series premiere.\n\nBarrow starts off the show as one of the most consistent villains, constantly scheming to take out Bates — and then anyone else who is in his way of getting promoted to Carson's position when he retires.\n\nBarrow slowly undergoes a transformation and becomes one of the most beloved members of the staff, all while experiencing the hardships of being a closeted gay man in the 1910s and '20s.\n\nBarrow ended the first movie with a chance at romance, but by the second movie, he seems to be single again.\n\nBarrow begins \"A New Era\" as the butler of the estate, and seems to make an impression on the star of the movie that's filming at Downton, Guy Dexter, as played by Dominic West.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaisy Robinson is played by Sophie McShera, beginning in season one.\n\nDaisy begins as one of the kitchen maids at the estate who is frequently taken advantage of, or is the subject of pranks, due to her innocent and gullible nature. Over time, she develops a strong relationship with the cook, Mrs. Patmore, and eventually becomes the assistant cook.\n\nBy the series finale, she has fallen in love with Andy Parker, a footman at her father-in-law's farm.\n\nDaisy gets engaged to Andy during the first film, and they are married in \"A New Era.\"\n\nDaisy Parker, as she's now called, is married to Andy after the events of the first film and the two are living together on her father-in-law Mr. Mason's farm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLesley Nicol has played Mrs. Patmore, the cook, since the beginning.\n\nMrs. Patmore forms a strong relationship with Daisy over the course of the series and takes her on as an apprentice. She also begins seeing Daisy's father-in-law, Mr. Mason.\n\nMrs. Patmore is balancing her duties at Downton with her bed-and-breakfast.\n\nAs per usual, Mrs. Patmore seems to relish her latest challenge: cooking for an entire film cast and crew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenelope Wilton made her debut at the very end of the first episode of the show as Isobel Crawley, Matthew's mother.\n\nThe first episode of \"Downton Abbey\" ends with Matthew receiving the news that he is the new heir of the estate while eating breakfast with his mother. While he is reluctant to take on the responsibility, his mother is determined for her son to accept the offer.\n\nAfter her son's death, Isobel becomes genuinely close with Violet, and the two bond.\n\nIsobel is now Lady Merton, as she accepted a marriage proposal in the final season of the show.\n\nIsobel married Lord Merton, aka Dickie, in the series finale. The two will both appear in \"A New Era.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaquel Cassidy became part of the cast in season four. She plays Phyllis Baxter, one of Cora's maids.\n\nWhen Baxter joins the staff, it becomes clear that Thomas Barrow knows a secret about her, and uses it to manipulate her. Eventually, it's revealed that she had stolen jewels from a previous employer and spent time in prison.\n\nShe and Molesley have affection for each other, but nothing really happens between the two during the series.\n\nBaxter returns for \"A New Era,\" and she's still working at the estate.\n\nBaxter is still working at Downton and appears to have a romantic storyline with Joseph Molesley, one of the valets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Doyle joined the cast in the second-ever episode as Joseph Molesley, Matthew's valet.\n\nMolesley becomes part of the Crawley household when Matthew arrives at Downton, and he is named his valet.\n\nAfter Matthew's death, Molesley is left without a job and struggles to find work until he's welcomed back as a second footman under Carson.\n\nMolesley finally acts on his attraction to Phyllis Baxter in \"A New Era.\"\n\nNo spoilers, but Molesley and Baxter had a long-simmering attraction to each other that was never fully explored in the series or the first movie — you can expect that to change in \"A New Era.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllen Leech joined the cast halfway through season one as Tom Branson, the Crawley's Irish chauffeur.\n\nTom is the most explicitly political character on the show, as he's a vocal supporter of Irish independence and socialism. He bonds with Lady Sybil, the youngest Crawley daughter, and the two eventually get married.\n\nSadly, Sybil dies in childbirth, leaving Tom alone to figure out where he fits in his new family, as a new member and former employee. He is eventually named co-agent of the estate with his sister-in-law, Mary.\n\nTom is now married to Lucy Smith, and the two travel to France together to check out the villa Violet left to Tom's daughter.\n\nDuring the first movie, Tom falls in love with Lucy, and \"A New Era\" begins with their wedding. After the reception, Violet gives her lawyer permission to tell Tom and Lucy that Tom's daughter with Sybil, her great-granddaughter, will be inheriting the mysterious villa that's the subject of the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert's younger sister, Rosamund Painswick, debuts in the season one finale. She's played by Samantha Bond.\n\nRosamund begins the series as a widow. She and her late husband, Marmaduke (yes, really), lived together in London, and she remained there after his death.\n\nThroughout the show, Rosamund is a well-meaning, if meddlesome, member of the Crawley family, but is always a welcome addition.\n\nRosamund is on hand to hear the news of her mother's French villa.\n\nAs the film's main plot has to do with her mother, you can be sure Rosamund will be around to hear all the gossip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndy and Daisy got married at some point between the first and second films.\n\nThe two seem to be in a happier spot than they were in the first film, during which Daisy seemed unsure about marrying Andy until the end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry Hadden-Paton first appeared in a Christmas special before properly joining the cast in season six as Bertie Pelham.\n\nBertie is who finally gives Edith her happy ending — despite her sister Mary's best efforts — and marries her in the series finale. And, since Bertie becomes a Marquess due to a distant cousin's death, Edith now outranks her entire family with her husband's title.\n\nBertie and Edith welcomed their first child together before \"A New Era.\"\n\nBertie also decides to accompany his wife and her family on their journey to France.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonathan Coy appeared in the first three seasons of \"Downton Abbey\" as George Murray, the Crawley's lawyer.\n\nIn fact, it's Murray who lets the Earl of Grantham know who the next heirs of Downton could possibly be, eventually settling on Matthew.\n\nMurray returns in \"A New Era\" to explain Violet's new property.\n\nWe haven't seen Murray since season three — glad to know he's still around to help the Crawleys out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouglas Reith began playing Lord Merton, aka Dickie, in season three.\n\nLord Merton's first appearance involves him apologizing for the legitimately gross (and potentially illegal?) behavior of his son, who drugs Tom Branson the night before Mary and Matthew's wedding.\n\nHe appears later on in seasons five and six to court Isobel, Matthew's mother. They were married in the series finale.\n\nLord Merton can be spotted in the trailer alongside his wife and Lady Rosamund.\n\nPresumably, he's there to celebrate the wedding of Tom Branson and Lucy.\n\nRead next\n\nMovies\n\nAdvertisement"
