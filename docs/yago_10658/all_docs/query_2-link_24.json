[LAUGHTER] PHYLLIS: You've got me, I'm afraid.\n\nDo you want the TVR?\n\nIt's too low down for me.\n\nI'd never get in there with my lumbago.\n\nI think we'll go for classic beauty, and we'll leave the nouveau brashness to them.\n\n- Oh!\n\n- Outrageous!\n\nMark?\n\nMark, are you going to be driving, and Phyllis will sit in the back?\n\nYes, shall we do that?\n\nCome along.\n\nHave you got your chauffeur's hat on?\n\nNARRATOR: So that'll keep Downton fan, Mark, happy, whilst Thomas is in for a right pirates meet up.\n\nAnd what an adventure awaits.\n\nOur route starts in Barham, Kent.\n\nThen we take a trip to the coast before heading over the border into Sussex, finally making for an auction by the Thames at Greenwich.\n\nThis little village with three bears, passons on its coat of arms, was the home of one of the four knights who murdered Thomas a Becket at nearby Canterbury Cathedral in 1170.\n\nLord Kitchener, of recruitment poster fame, once lived near Barham, too.\n\nWhat do you think Kevin's going to be like?\n\nIs he quite competitive?\n\nOh, yes.\n\nIs he?\n\nCompletely.\n\nHonestly.\n\nSee, playing games with him, he's got to win.\n\nMARK: Oh.\n\nSo we need to win.\n\nWell, I'd really like to win.\n\nI'd really like to.\n\nSo do I. NARRATOR: I think those two will do all right.\n\nPHYLLIS: Oh Mark, look.\n\nShall I give it a pull?\n\n[LOUD RING] MARK: Oh!\n\nOh wow!\n\nLoud ring.\n\nWell it's worked.\n\nAnd it's worked, indeed.\n\nCHRISTIAN: Hello.\n\n- I'm Mark.\n\n- I'm Christian.\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nHi, Christian.\n\nI'm Phyllis.\n\nHi Phyllis.\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nMARK: You've got some antiques, I gather.\n\nCHRISTIAN: Yes, we've got one or two around the corner.\n\nMARK: We're dying to see them, aren't we.\n\nPHYLLIS: We are.\n\nWe can't wait to get started.\n\nThat way to the showroom.\n\nPHYLLIS: Thank you.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] - Yes, we shall.\n\nCome on.\n\nNARRATOR: He's not wrong.\n\nThere are at least one or two.\n\nGood quality, as well, which could put a bit of a strain on the old funds.\n\nIt's not 16 pounds 50, is it.\n\nUnfortunately not.\n\nThat's the table, of course.\n\nLook.\n\nI like this.\n\nReally?\n\n[PHYLLIS CHUCKLES] NARRATOR: Don't tell me our co-stars are falling out already.\n\nFancy a duel?\n\nPHYLLIS: We got taught this at drama school.\n\nOh did you?\n\nYes.\n\nEn garde.\n\nPHYLLIS: Oh it's even got the rapier, too.\n\nOh.\n\nPHYLLIS: Take that.\n\nMARK: Oh you've remembered it.\n\nPHYLLIS: Yes.\n\nMARK: Very professional.\n\n[PHYLLIS CHUCKLES] NARRATOR: Conservatoire trained.\n\nMARK: So if you were ever in The Scarlet Pimpernel, that would be wonderful, wouldn't it?\n\nNARRATOR: Now those look cheap and familiar.\n\nMARK: Those are very old keys.\n\nYes.\n\nBut that's what I wear.\n\nNARRATOR: Very Mrs. Hughes.\n\nA bit rusty, though.\n\nNow that might suit a pirate film, don't you think?\n\nMARK: Could you see anything?\n\nNo.\n\nMARK: Take that off, that's it.\n\nShip ahoy, cap'n.\n\nNARRATOR: The ticket price is 175 pounds, whatever they see in it.\n\nPHYLLIS: Yes I can.\n\nNARRATOR: Which is quite a bit.\n\nJust what did the actor say to the auctioneer?\n\nKEVIN: Are you a good haggler?\n\nTHOMAS: Yes, very good haggler, because I'm a Bristolian.\n\nKEVIN: I was born in Bristol, myself.\n\nTHOMAS: Were you?\n\nThat's a lovely part of the world.\n\nIt's a lovely part of the world.\n\nAnd of course it's where pirates come from.\n\nIt's exactly where pirates come from.\n\nPieces of eight?\n\nKEVIN: Pieces of eight.\n\nIt's a Bristol thing.\n\nTHOMAS: It's a Bristol phrase.\n\nKEVIN: It's a Bristol thing.\n\nTHOMAS: And also, to have the meanness of a Bristolian.\n\nThe meanness-- won't spend a penny.\n\nThey're so tight with money.\n\nWas your mother tight with money?\n\nBut she was careful.\n\nShe'd always say to me, no, you hold on to your money.\n\n[THOMAS CHUCKLES] NARRATOR: They seem like shipmates already.\n\nDoes that make Tom the cabin boy?\n\nTime for a trip to the seaside as we go looking for a deal in Deal.\n\n[INSTRUMENTAL SEA SHANTY MUSIC PLAYING] Just north of Dover, and a mere 25 miles from the French coast, Deal has a bit of a reputation for smuggling.\n\nSeems to be the perfect port of call for a pair of pirates to land up in.\n\nArr.\n\nLook.\n\nCanute Road.\n\nThat's where King Canute lived.\n\nYes, he lived there on Canute Road.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] Number 46, I think.\n\n[THOMAS CHUCKLES] NARRATOR: Well, vikings were pirates, too, weren't they?\n\nHello, I'm Kevin.\n\n- Nice to meet you.\n\n- Nice to meet you.\n\nHow are you doing?\n\n- Thomas.\n\nHello Thomas.\n\nNARRATOR: Plenty of loot in 'ere, maties.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] NARRATOR: And Kevin certainly knows what he doesn't like.\n\nMy nickname on Pirates of the Caribbean was Badger.\n\nYes.\n\nKEVIN: Although I wouldn't want to buy that because I can't stand stuffed animals.\n\nMy grandmother's house was full of them.\n\nDogs.\n\nPottery dogs.\n\nPottery dogs, yeah.\n\nNever saw the point.\n\nNARRATOR: Strangely enough, Phyllis has other ideas.\n\nMARK: Oh, it's quite heavy.\n\nNot very old.\n\nAnd it's produced by a factory called Winstanley.\n\nThey're more known, actually, for their cats.\n\nOh.\n\nSo that's quite unusual.\n\nI've never seen a bulldog by them.\n\nWell how much are you-- Oh dear.\n\n150.\n\nBut I think bulldogs are very popular subject.\n\nPeople like bulldogs-- British bulldog.\n\nPHYLLIS: Yes, yes.\n\nMARK: The fighting spirit.\n\nThat's true.\n\nAnd we are in a battle.\n\nNARRATOR: Time to see what Christian can do.\n\nCHRISTIAN: How are you getting on?\n\nWe quite like, funny enough, the bulldog.\n\nShall we just be bold?\n\nYes, I think we should be bold.\n\nThey would only ask us to leave.\n\nI know, exactly.\n\nAnd we've got the car ready, haven't we.\n\nAnd I'm sure we won't do that.\n\nWe don't want to insult you, but-- But we do, really.\n\nBut we are on a very tight budget.\n\nWe thought around 30, really.\n\nMARK: And then I thought we might make a reasonable profit on it.\n\nI'm going to go a bit more.\n\nWhat about 60?\n\nMARK: Oh gosh.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWell, it's not a [INAUDIBLE],, is it?\n\nPHYLLIS: Oh?\n\nSo maybe 40.\n\n55?\n\nMARK: Oh gosh, It's going down in fives.\n\nNARRATOR: Come on, Phyllis.\n\nThis is definitely a speaking part.\n\nI think Phyllis and I would be delighted if we could get it for 45, wouldn't we.\n\nI mean, if we could just do that, because I think it'll be estimated at 40 to 60 pounds.\n\nWhat about meeting me in the middle?\n\n2 pounds 50 each, and make him 50.\n\nYou happy with 50?\n\nYes.\n\nThere, shake his hand.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPHYLLIS: Thank you very much.\n\nNARRATOR: Quite a reduction mark.\n\nBut now Phyllis has spotted something else, it seems.\n\nWe're rather intrigued by this, which we couldn't find a price on it, though, could we.\n\nCHRISTIAN: It's part of the display-- MARK: Oh!\n\nCHRISTIAN: --I'm afraid.\n\nPHYLLIS: We like it.\n\nThat appealed as a piece of an occasional table, almost.\n\nMARK: It's kind of modernist in a way, isn't it?\n\nI mean because, obviously the glass is a later top, but I love that sort of sinuous-- it's Art Nouveau, really, isn't it?\n\n1900, 1905, something like that.\n\nPHYLLIS: But it's not for sale.\n\nDon't give up so easily.\n\nChristian, I know, wants to help us.\n\nAnything is for sale for the right price, my dear.\n\nPHYLLIS: Oh I see.\n\nWell what if we started again at, say, around 40 pounds?\n\nWhat if I said about 70 pounds?\n\nOh.\n\nPhyllis is not looking happy about that.\n\nI mean we like it, but in the auction it might not appeal to anybody.\n\nNARRATOR: One of your finest performances, Phyllis.\n\nI feel another BAFTA coming on.\n\nWhy don't we say 50 again, and then it's a round 100, isn't it?\n\nCould we do that?\n\nCHRISTIAN: A round 100 for the bulldog and the pedestal.\n\nWell I would say a lot more than that, really.\n\nMake it 60?\n\nPHYLLIS: Shall we say yea?\n\nTo 60?\n\nMh-hm.\n\nIt's 100 for the two.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's all right, isn't it?\n\n- 110?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nYes.\n\nSound like a deal?\n\nIts does.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] Thank you, Christian.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nNARRATOR: Team Phyllis is off the mark, purchasing the bulldog and the lamp table for 110 pounds.\n\nWith that deal done, what about Deal?\n\nThe place, that is, where Kevin's taking charge.\n\nHere we go.\n\nKEVIN: I like the look of these.\n\nTHOMAS: What, the scales?\n\nThe butcher's scales, yeah.\n\nThey're rather good, aren't they.\n\nKEVIN: But does he have the weights with it?\n\nTHOMAS: With weights.\n\nOh.\n\nThere we are, with brass weight weights.\n\nI do think they're rather handsome.\n\nYes, that has to go.\n\nWe're not having that.\n\nNARRATOR: He's made an impressive start.\n\nStill needs a guiding hand, though.\n\nThis is where the a lack of experience comes in.\n\nNARRATOR: He can play a bit, too.\n\nKEVIN: Yeah, if you don't pump it, it won't make a noise.\n\nYeah, it's like a Georgian aerobics.\n\nIt's fantastic it works.\n\nIt's a shame it's got that little wheeze in it.\n\nI think if you were 150 years old, you might have a bit wheeze.\n\n[HARMONIUM MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: The harmonium, or pump organ, was once very popular in the home and in small churches and chapels where huge pipe organs would have been impractical.\n\nSo yes.\n\nKEVIN: How do you think that would do?\n\nI think it's quite fun.\n\nIt's small enough to be-- It is small enough, isn't it?\n\nYeah.\n\nShould we put that in our memory banks and come back to it?\n\nBecause it's-- NARRATOR: Quite a price.\n\nNot exactly going for a song.\n\nKEVIN: We can't buy everything, can we?\n\nTHOMAS: You can't.\n\nBut you've picked out some amazing things.\n\nI'm quite impressed with your eyes.\n\nIs there anything you're looking for?\n\nNo.\n\nNo?\n\nNARRATOR: Well I'm sure Thomas can come up with something.\n\nI've never seen this before, ever, in my working career.\n\nKEVIN: What is-- oh, it's to hold a pipe.\n\nPlay pipes, you used to buy them in packs of 20.\n\nRight, because they break so easily.\n\nAnybody who knows that.\n\nBut this is for traveling.\n\n[KEVIN GASPS] THOMAS: To keep them safe.\n\nNARRATOR: The ticket says 45 pounds.\n\nTHOMAS: It's mahogany-- KEVIN: Lovely.\n\nTHOMAS: --and comes with its own pipe.\n\nKEVIN: Yeah.\n\nTHOMAS: Well I think that's a lovely little item.\n\nYou just slip it in your breaches.\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nKEVIN: The great thing on the day will be, with it being one of my lots, is it's darn piratey.\n\nTHOMAS: It is, isn't it?\n\nKEVIN: Yeah.\n\nAnd somebody might like to say, I got this from a real pirate.\n\nNARRATOR: I think that might be taking it a bit far.\n\nMethod actors, eh?\n\nWorth talking to Mick about that, and the harmonium, though.\n\nKEVIN: Now we need to speak to you, quite severely.\n\nWe'd need a very, very good deal from you, because it's a lot of my bank.\n\nMICK: I'll come straight to the point.\n\nI can take 100 pounds off that.\n\nOh, you'd have to take more than 100 pounds off it, mate.\n\nThat would still be half my money.\n\nMICK: Oh my heart bleeds.\n\nYeah I know.\n\nI can see how sympathetic you are to my plight.\n\nMICK: OK, bottom line, 150.\n\nKEVIN: 150.\n\nTHOMAS: And the pipe holder, you haven't cleaned it up.\n\nWhat can that be?\n\nAgain, bottom line would be 30 on that.\n\nNARRATOR: With negotiations at a bit of a lull, it's time to refocus.\n\nThe closure is-- You could take the two for 150.\n\n[GASPS] Offer him that.\n\nYou know what's coming, don't you?\n\nThe harmonium and the pipe for 150.\n\nThis is your last opportunity, Mick.\n\nIt's not going to happen again.\n\nNARRATOR: He's good.\n\nHardly needs an agent, I'd say.\n\n165.\n\nKEVIN: Aw!\n\nI've got to make a little bit, haven't I.\n\n160 and you got a deal.\n\nOK.\n\nI like your style.\n\nI was going to say that myself.\n\nExcellent THOMAS: I step in with my sweaty paw-- MICK: Go on then.\n\nTHOMAS: --and give you the dosh.\n\nKEVIN: Excellent.\n\nNARRATOR: After all that effort it's time for a pirate timeout.\n\nOh!\n\nYeah!\n\nThree!\n\nNARRATOR: Although I'm not sure skimming stones is very Treasure Island.\n\nTHOMAS: I've never been to Deal before.\n\nOf course, like you, being a Bristol boy, it's Weston-super-Mud.\n\nWeston-super-Mud?\n\nMy grandmother used to take me there, loads.\n\nKEVIN: It's great.\n\nTHOMAS: I remember one year we went there and the tide was in, so it was really exciting, yeah.\n\nNARRATOR: But while Kevin and Thomas have been making a bit of a splash in Deal, [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Phyllis and Mark have temporarily suspended all purchases, motoring to another part of the Kent coast, Birchington-on-Sea.\n\nAnd Quex House, once the regency home of hunter and collector, Percy Powell-Cotton.\n\nHello KIETH: Hello.\n\n- You're Keith, yeah?\n\n- I am.\n\nHello.\n\nHi I'm Phyllis.\n\nI'm Mark.\n\nVery nice to meet you.\n\nGood to meet you both.\n\nSpectacular house.\n\nKIETH: It's amazing, isn't it?\n\nPHYLLIS: Lead on.\n\n[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] I feel as though I'm back in the Maasai Mara.\n\nNARRATOR: This impressive-- if slightly disconcerting-- museum was first established in 1896 by Major Powell-Cotton to house the specimens and cultural artifacts he collected whilst exploring the globe.\n\nKIETH: He collected animals-- you know, he shot them.\n\nIt was a very different world to the world that we're in now, and he was collecting with this scientific purpose.\n\nThere was always this drive to understand the world he was in.\n\nNARRATOR: Africa was the continent Powell-Cotton fell in love with, making 20 expeditions over the course of 50 years.\n\nBut although he slaughtered many thousands of animals, the meticulous records that Powell-Cotton kept of each kill can now play an important role in conservation.\n\nSo this is one of the specimens.\n\nIn this case-- PHYLLIS: A warthog.\n\nExactly.\n\nSo this gives a breakdown of what he brought back, but also we have the latitude and longitude for every specimen he brought back.\n\nPHYLLIS: That's very useful.\n\nKIETH: It really is.\n\nThe latitude and longitude today can be used to help protect areas of Africa and species.\n\nSo someone was recently working with bush babies, and they were identifying where they used to be found, and then using that information to say, well, they were here once.\n\nSo if you protect this space there's a chance they'll be back.\n\nNARRATOR: As well as the 500 creatures on display in the museum's dioramas, there are over 4,000 skeletons and 6,000 skins-- a huge DNA database which has helped breeding programs designed to save species from extinction.\n\nIn the collection we have this type of thing.\n\nSo every time you find a red label-- PHYLLIS: A Diana colobus monkey.\n\nWhich is just behind you.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nKIETH: Percy brought some back that had not been identified to science before.\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nCan I touch?\n\nYeah, please do.\n\nAnd again, used by researchers looking at primates.\n\nNARRATOR: So was the Major a misunderstood conservationist, or just a big game hunter who kept good books.\n\nLike many Victorians, he had the urge to educate, and didn't always use his gun to do the shooting.\n\nHis 16mm films of his expeditions depict tribal ceremonies, as well as wildlife.\n\nHis daughters also followed in the family tradition, contributing to a huge archive.\n\nKIETH: In 1905 he wrote a book, In Unknown Africa.\n\nAnd in that book he talks about how if we don't protect the wild places of Africa, we will start to lose species in special areas.\n\nAnd he even goes far as to say it might reach a point where the only place you'll see these animals is in a museum.\n\nNARRATOR: Whatever his methods, Powell-Cotton certainly had a genuine love of Africa, even getting married there in 1905.\n\nOne of the most striking displays at the museum results from that same expedition.\n\nPHYLLIS: That is amazing.\n\nNARRATOR: The Buffalo is yet another example of a previously unknown species, which the Major soon had his name appended to.\n\nAnd the lion has an even closer connection to the museum's founder, having nearly killed him.\n\nKIETH: So if you look at his clothing you'll see that the major wound he suffered was on his back.\n\nHe thought he'd killed the lion, went over to it, and it leapt up-- dragged him to the ground.\n\nHe suffered his major wound here, but the thing that saved him was tucked in his trousers, was a copy of Punch.\n\nPHYLLIS: Oh, and that saved his life.\n\nKIETH: Saved his life.\n\nAnd when he got back to Britain, Punch magazine had published the story of the lion.\n\nWell of course.\n\nNARRATOR: Time to find out what our other pair of antique explorers are up to in darkest Kent, heading to the famous resort of Margate.\n\nThe painter, Turner, described these skies as the loveliest in all Europe, and there's now an art gallery here in the great man's name.\n\n[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] No point in locking it, it doesn't got to top.\n\nNo.\n\nThere's a door here.\n\nOh, is it?\n\nRight there, it's a walk in the door.\n\nNARRATOR: Well it's a big place.\n\nHi there.\n\nKevin.\n\nHi welcome to Tony Margate.\n\nI'm Ron.\n\n- Yeah Ron, nice to see you.\n\n- Pleased to meet you.\n\n- Thomas.\n\n- How are you doing.\n\nKEVIN: A lot of clocks, I see.\n\nYeah.\n\nI'm a clock fancier, myself.\n\nThey're not very good business at the moment, to be honest.\n\nOh, well thanks for the advice.\n\nWe won't be looking at clocks, then, thank you.\n\nNARRATOR: Decisive Kevin.\n\nHe continues to impress.\n\nThe Tu-95.\n\nVery, very nice long range bomber.\n\nSoviet, of course.\n\nNARRATOR: Perhaps they'll pick up a piece of military, then.\n\nM-85 helmet, first Gulf War.\n\nHoorah!\n\nOh.\n\nWish I never had fish and chips at lunchtime.\n\nYou look lovely, but could you please press on?\n\nI don't think I can take it off.\n\nI'm stuck.\n\nNARRATOR: Ron's huge establishment is very different from the shop they were in earlier.\n\nThis is overwhelming.\n\nNARRATOR: But Kevin still seems intent on following his instincts.\n\nTHOMAS: Zealand?\n\nRON: Yeah.\n\nTom.\n\nTHOMAS: Yeah, coming.\n\nWhat have you got?\n\nOh, is this a dentist chair, or a barber's?\n\nThat's a dentist.\n\nIt's a dentist chair.\n\nYes.\n\nPeople associate these things with pain.\n\nNARRATOR: Remember Larry and Dustin in Marathon man?\n\nKEVIN: Put your head back.\n\nLet's have a look.\n\nNo!\n\nNARRATOR: But is it safe?\n\nWell that'll have to come out, for a start.\n\nOw!\n\nNARRATOR: I think that Thomas's advice, plus the 300 pound price tag, might deter a splurge.\n\nAh.\n\nMore pain.\n\nIt's a Cat o' nine tails.\n\nIs this something you use on your films?\n\nOh yes, yeah.\n\nThe lashings will continue until morale improves.\n\nNARRATOR: It seems that Ron's always got a bit more shop to explore.\n\nOh look.\n\nKEVIN: Do you remember Steptoe and Son?\n\nYeah.\n\nI think it was shot here.\n\nNARRATOR: I'm not sure the warehouse is actually open to the public, Kevin.\n\nIt's my sideburns.\n\nKEVIN: Oh look.\n\nTHOMAS: They got a Tuba there.\n\nA big, old Tuba.\n\nBut look, there's nothing there.\n\nYou wouldn't be able to play it.\n\nThat doesn't matter.\n\nReally?\n\nNo, because these are converted to lamps now.\n\nI love it.\n\nNARRATOR: It's a Boosey, and so predates 1930 when the company merged with the other great British musical dynasty of Hawkes.\n\nLadies and gents, Tony Hancock in.\n\n[PLAYS HANCOCK HALF HOUR THEME] H-Hankock's half hour.\n\nHey, a Boosey?\n\nIt's a Boosey one.\n\nReally?\n\nOh, I slipped up there.\n\nWhat do you mean you slipped up there?\n\nNARRATOR: Ron's asking 50 pounds for this slightly battered bit of brass.\n\nCould this be better than the 50?\n\nI think 50 is a gift, to be honest with you.\n\nDo you think so?\n\nI didn't know it was Boosey, or I-- [INAUDIBLE] THOMAS: 40, because there's a lot of work on here.\n\nRON: Yeah, you've wheedled your way into my warehouse.\n\nYou don't like, that do you?\n\nOh I don't mind.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] you can't come here and then [INAUDIBLE] the floor things in the warehouse.\n\nKEVIN: If I could take that away with me and still have 200 quid left for tomorrow, I'd be such a happy bunny.\n\nBut once we give him 50 I'm under the 200, I've got no negotiation, you see.\n\nThen I've just got no leverage, you see.\n\nTHOMAS: For 40 pounds, I think Kevin would take it away.\n\nRON: No, I'm sorry.\n\nI mean I thank you very much for the interest, but honest the truth, I think it's a steal at 50 quid.\n\nBoosey is better than Boosey & Hawkes.\n\nIt's earlier.\n\nYeah, it is earlier.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] RON: I've had a little practice, you know.\n\nYou're good, you're good, your good.\n\nRON: [INAUDIBLE] 45 quid and we'll have a deal.\n\nGo on.\n\n- Come on, quickly.\n\n- Absolutely.\n\nYes.\n\nGot it.\n\nLovely.\n\n- That's it.\n\nGood man.\n\nYes, all the thrill, the adrenaline.\n\nI'm becoming a junkie.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] [LAUGHTER] NARRATOR: Never a script, darlings.\n\nImprov every time.\n\nLet's go.\n\n[HANCOCK HALF HOUR THEME PLAYS] NARRATOR: After quite a day, Kevin and Phyllis are together again.\n\nOh is that a squirrel?\n\nIt was a rabbit!\n\nOh.\n\nWe really are in the countryside.\n\nWe really are.\n\nWhere there's a little bunny rabbit there.\n\nMARK: I think we're lost.\n\n[PHYLLIS CHUCKLES] We should have brought a map.\n\nOh well.\n\nDoesn't this not get any satnav?\n\n[MARK CHUCKLES] Afraid not.\n\nNARRATOR: I do hope they find their way.\n\nNighty-night.\n\n[UPBEAT MUSIC] Next morning we're in Sussex, where it's raining.\n\nWould you need your wipers on?\n\nDo you know where they are?\n\nKEVIN: Have a look to see if one of those say wipers.\n\nOh there we are, look.\n\nWhitwers.\n\nKEVIN: Lovely.\n\nPHYLLIS: Weee!\n\nNARRATOR: That's what marriage is all about.\n\nTeamwork.\n\nAnd betting on household chores, of course.\n\nI think we should forget about that whole breakfast thing and just make it totally about the bins.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nYes, no exactly.\n\nBins and recycling.\n\nWhat a chore.\n\nSee, that's you in the next six months.\n\nDon't be so cocky.\n\nNo, no.\n\nMark's got me sorted.\n\nWell sorted.\n\n[KEVIN CHUCKLES] Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nWell I love to see you confident, darling, but I'm very sad to see it so misplaced.\n\nNARRATOR: Phyllis and Mark were the cautious couple yesterday, spending a mere 110 pounds on a bulldog and a lamp table, as you do.\n\nWe don't want to insult you, but-- But we do, really.\n\nNARRATOR: Leaving just under 300 pounds to spend today.\n\nWhile Kevin and Thomas splurged out on a tuba, a pipe holder, and a harmonium.\n\nYou be careful with that, now, because it belongs to me.\n\nNARRATOR: For a total cost of 205 pounds, meaning they have almost 200 pounds in their wallet.\n\nKEVIN: I'm feeling a little bit of insecurity from you.\n\nFrom me?\n\nYeah, you're cracking-- No, darling, no.\n\n--under the strain.\n\nNARRATOR: Later they'll be ending up in the capital for a Greenwich auction.\n\nBut in the meantime, we're in Sussex at Eastbourne.\n\n[RAGTIME MUSIC PLAYING] The comedian Charlie Chester was born in Eastbourne, and political theorist Friedrich Engels, who co-wrote the Communist Manifesto with Karl Marx.\n\nHe has his ashes scattered at nearby Beachy Head.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] PHYLLIS: Are we going to the same place?\n\nKEVIN: I think we are.\n\nOh, we'd like to get there before them.\n\nCome up there.\n\nNARRATOR: I wonder if there'll be much chit chat about the theory of surplus value as our gang of four shop together.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] Yesterday, Phyllis took a bit of a supporting role when it came to the choosing, so she's keen to play her part today.\n\nOh do we like this clock?\n\nThis?\n\nWell it's nice.\n\nI mean it's Art Deco-- ish.\n\n- Hm.\n\nIt's French.\n\nProbably 1940s.\n\nThey don't do terribly well.\n\nNARRATOR: Maybe not.\n\nKevin's after a new career.\n\nDo you want to go over and do Pirates of the Caribbean 5, and I'll do this.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nFor sure.\n\nWe'll do that.\n\nYeah, OK, great.\n\nNARRATOR: Lordy.\n\nMARK: I mean I know Thomas quite well.\n\nAnd you obviously know Kevin very well.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat do you think they're going for?\n\nToys.\n\nTHOMAS: It's a model aeroplane.\n\nIt's an actual flying aeroplane.\n\nThey're going for blokey things as well.\n\nYeah.\n\nTrain sets.\n\nOh.\n\nSoldiers.\n\nThat lives there.\n\nNARRATOR: Uncanny.\n\nAnd here's something you'd like.\n\nA Lancaster, or Wellington bomber cockpit compass.\n\n[KEVIN GASPS] KEVIN: Let me in there.\n\nTHOMAS: Can you see that?\n\nKEVIN: Oh that is great.\n\nThat could be my military thing.\n\nNARRATOR: Let's have a closer look with shopkeeper, Damien.\n\nTell him we hate it.\n\nNARRATOR: The price of the compass is 85 pounds.\n\nNot sure they can see that, though.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] I want to see the date.\n\nVery interesting.\n\nTHOMAS: You like that?\n\nKEVIN: It works, which is great.\n\nI love the fact that it's got that box.\n\nTHOMAS: We should wash our hands after this.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell I think if this is a luminescent, there'll be some radiation.\n\nOh, will there?\n\nNARRATOR: Crikey, step away from the antique.\n\nMeanwhile Phyllis has taken mark outside.\n\nPHYLLIS: Well what about these chairs?\n\nMARK: Well, yes, you see, these are what I would call nursing chairs.\n\nPHYLLIS: Nursing chairs?\n\nYes, you know, for a mother to sit on.\n\nThey probably date a sort of 1890, 1900, so they're antique.\n\nThey're asking 155 for the pair.\n\nBut again, if they're outside, maybe the dealer wants to get rid of them.\n\nMaybe they bought them with some other stuff.\n\nAnd actually they'd be glad to see the back of them.\n\nEverybody watching at home will be saying, don't buy them, don't buy them.\n\nNARRATOR: There'll be some lively discussion, for certain.\n\nMARK: Have a go.\n\nSee what you think.\n\nOh yes.\n\nTHOMAS: What does it feel like?\n\nIt feels lovely, actually.\n\nYou could put your feet up in that one.\n\nI think you should.\n\nOh.\n\nOh it's hard work, all this, isn't it?\n\nI know.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nMARK: Well I think we can maybe-- PHYLLIS: Knock them down a bit.\n\n--knock them down a bit.\n\nShall we?\n\nI'm feeling like grrrr!\n\nOh you're feeling like you really going to get-- I was so wussy yesterday.\n\nI'm feeling more grrrr!\n\nOh, you weren't wussy.\n\nNARRATOR: Prepare yourself, Paul.\n\nShe means business.\n\nWe are on quite a tight budget, here.\n\nAnd, of course, I'm going to try and knock you down a bit.\n\nBut we need these at a really special Downton Abbey price, don't we.\n\nI'm emphasizing the word \"down\".\n\nNARRATOR: Subtle, Mark.\n\nHow does 110 sound?\n\nNo, no.\n\nI'm sorry, we can't do that.\n\nNo, we-- I know you-- How does 90 pounds sit?\n\nWe're headed in the right direction.\n\nWe're going down.\n\nIn order for the better team to win.\n\nMARK: I like that.\n\nPHYLLIS: I like your style.\n\nI'll give you the pair of chairs for 70 pounds.\n\nMARK: We are so close.\n\nPHYLLIS: We are so close.\n\nI was thinking maybe a round figure of 60 and we could shake your hand.\n\nYou know you want to.\n\nShake his hand, before he changes his mind.\n\nI hope you win this one.\n\nThank you so much, Paul.\n\nWe are thrilled with those.\n\nNARRATOR: Well done, Phyllis.\n\nHow are the boys getting on with their much-loved compass?\n\nPAUL: We can't have the compass.\n\nThe gentleman who owns it is currently in Europe and I can't get hold of him on the phone.\n\nWhat could you do that for normally?\n\nWe could do it for 65.\n\nNARRATOR: With 195 pounds still in the kitty, it's affordable.\n\nBut the pirates go back on the prowl for more treasure.\n\nHe's doing that walking away thing.\n\nI really like that.\n\nNARRATOR: The rivals, however, look altogether more relaxed.\n\nHave you ever worked together?\n\nNot or age-- oh well, mind you, having said that, he did come on to Downton Abbey.\n\nMARK: Oh did he?\n\nYes, it was horrible-- no it wasn't.\n\nIt must be quite fun.\n\nIt was quite fun, I must say.\n\nAnd this is nice.\n\nI mean this is like being on a little holiday.\n\nYeah.\n\nYes it is.\n\nComing around another look.\n\nNARRATOR: The boys, though, are keeping their minds on the game.\n\nTHOMAS: That Iraq is silver.\n\nKEVIN: At the back, that is nice.\n\nI do like that.\n\nTHOMAS: 19th century Islamic dish for Turkish delight or sweets, baklava, or something like that.\n\nSo this is on copper with silver.\n\nKEVIN: Is there any interest in it?\n\nI mean I think it's lovely.\n\nHuge amount of interest, because you are thinking of the emerging economies of the Middle East, and this is a near Middle East piece, and they do like to buy back their works of art which they created.\n\nAh, right.\n\nSo you have got a possibility with something like this.\n\nKEVIN: The price is at 161.\n\nIt's got to be 100 quid, really, isn't it?\n\n[INAUDIBLE] KEVIN: Go talk to him about that, yeah?\n\nNARRATOR: What can Damien do?\n\nDAMIEN: [INAUDIBLE] He's coming at 110 pounds.\n\nHe wouldn't do it for 95?\n\nHe actually 110 for it.\n\nAnd what, 65 for the-- DAMIEN: Market comes down to 60, so that gives you 170 for the two items.\n\nYeah, that's all right.\n\nOK. NARRATOR: I think we're almost there.\n\nAlmost all the cash gone, too.\n\nTHOMAS: Well I think it's these two, isn't it.\n\nWe're going to do it?\n\nYes.\n\nLeaves us a little bit of money left, but we didn't spend it all.\n\nWe'll spend it on the pub.\n\nThank you.\n\nGood idea.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nBetter give you some money.\n\n- Pay the man.\n\nYeah I will.\n\nAbsolutely, yes.\n\nNARRATOR: Cool.\n\nThey came out with a bang, wrapping up their shopping with the World War II compass, and the Middle East and silver inlaid copper plate for a total of 170 pounds.\n\nTime for a parting of the ways, with one side still hot to shop, and the other aiming for the stars.\n\nYou're quite into astrology, aren't you?\n\nAstronomy.\n\nAstronomy.\n\nAstronomy.\n\nNARRATOR: Really, Thomas.\n\nThey may sound the same, but astronomy, the study of the stars and planets, is really quite different from looking at horoscopes, or, astrology.\n\nKEVIN: When I was a kid I took one of the first astronomy o-levels-- Astrology.\n\nAstronomy.\n\nAstronomy.\n\nAstronomy.\n\nNARRATOR: Oh Thomas.\n\nThey're making for Herstmonceux, East Sussex.\n\nThe Greenwich Royal Observatory moved their telescopes here after the war, and although they've since gone further abroad to escape this weather, much remains.\n\nTHOMAS: Are you like a boy in a sweety shop?\n\nOh, absolutely.\n\nI can't express how excited I am.\n\nHi, I'm Kevin.\n\n- Hello Kevin.\n\nI'm Helen.\n\nHelen nice to meet you.\n\nI'm Thomas.\n\nCome on in.\n\nThis is Tom, but don't mind him.\n\nNARRATOR: Some regular viewers may recognize these domes from a previous pit stop by Charlie Ross.\n\nToday, however, Thomas and Kevin are here to learn about an outlandish experiment using two telescope lenses that turned an unknown Austrian physicist into one of the world's most famous men.\n\nIn 1919, two of the lenses that are on this site now were taken to Africa and Brazil, respectively, and they were instrumental in improving Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\nNARRATOR: One of the key points of Albert Einstein's famous theory was that even light is affected by gravity.\n\nTo prove this, he predicted that if you could see stars in the daytime, any stars hidden behind the sun would appear to have moved position.\n\nBut it was actually the sun's gravity bending the star's light.\n\nDeep stuff, eh?\n\nYou keeping up?\n\nAnd the way it worked was, that they proved that the gravity of a big object like the sun would bend light, which is a central core of special relativity.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWell that's what I was going to ask.\n\nWhat is the theory of relativity?\n\nI'll tell you later.\n\nWill you?\n\nWe don't have the time to do that here.\n\n[MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Well we've all heard of E=mc squared, but fear not, Thomas.\n\nEven the world's best scientists at the time couldn't wrap their minds around Einstein's ideas.\n\nThe only chap who saw the vast potential was British physicist Arthur Eddington, with the help of the Royal Astronomical Society, Eddington set out on a grand global expedition to get observational proof of part of Einstein's theory.\n\nThey knew they'd need a solar eclipse to view the stars and sun together, so a ship carrying two huge telescopes was sent along the route of the next eclipse.\n\nThe goal was to photograph the position of the stars during the eclipse to prove Einstein was right.\n\nThat's why the eclipse is so important, because the sky goes dark and you can take the photograph.\n\nThe stars come out-- Absolutely.\n\n--because they're always there, but obviously we could see the blue sky of the atmosphere.\n\nKEVIN: It was a brilliant experiment, isn't it?\n\nActually, when you break it down, it's an extremely simple experiment.\n\nKEVIN: Yes.\n\nWell that's the genius of it, I think.\n\nYes.\n\nNARRATOR: But the task was far from easy.\n\nWeather clouded their six-minute window, obscuring all but a few seconds of the eclipse.\n\nThey had one usable picture, but it was all that was needed.\n\nThe stars were shown to be out of position.\n\nEinstein was proved right, and science was changed forever.\n\nHe became an overnight celebrity, thanks to the team of intrepid British pioneers and two telescope lenses, both of which are now housed on this site.\n\nThis is an actual lens from the telescope?\n\nHELEN: The actual lens that was taken to Africa.\n\nKEVIN: It's a mighty lens, isn't it?\n\nAnd to think, they were hand-ground at that time, as well.\n\nTHOMAS: Where's the rest of the telescope?\n\nYour guess is as good as mine.\n\nI think it was left.\n\nTHOMAS: Left?\n\nKEVIN: They just brought the important bit, the lens.\n\nAll we have is the lens, now.\n\nTHOMAS: That's where the money is, the lenses.\n\nKEVIN: Yeah exactly.\n\nTalking of which, just shut that up because they'll have that auction by the end of the week.\n\nTHOMAS: Lot one-- a very famous lens.\n\n5 million pounds.\n\nKEVIN: Make sure it's locked up.\n\nNARRATOR: Incredibly, the lens from the second telescope used in the experiment is still in use here in Sussex.\n\nThis on top is the viewfinder, right?\n\nYes, that's the guidescope.\n\nThe guidescope.\n\nAnd this is the telescope, but is the original the Brazilian lens.\n\nThis is the lens that was taken to Brazil.\n\nTHOMAS: It's like you're some sort of mad professor.\n\nI am a mad professor.\n\nI feel like I should get my hair up a little bit more and start talking like Patrick Moore.\n\nTHOMAS: And Helen and I are your sort of people.\n\nAnd you know so much, I'm so impressed.\n\nWell, I know so little compared to these guys.\n\nCould I move this telescope, please?\n\nYeah I can take the clamps off for you and you can move it yourself.\n\nOK. THOMAS: Are you excited?\n\nKEVIN: Oh I'm so excited.\n\nAre the clamps off?\n\n[GASPS] Look at that.\n\nThe simplest touch, just move around the sky.\n\nTHOMAS: Love the dial there.\n\nKEVIN: Oh yeah.\n\nNARRATOR: Boys and their toys, eh?\n\nOh that's amazing.\n\nNARRATOR: Hang on.\n\nAh, we're doing that again, are we?\n\nThere they are.\n\nMeanwhile, back at Eastbourne.\n\nPHYLLIS: This looks rather intriguing.\n\nMARK: It does, doesn't it?\n\nNARRATOR: Phyllis and Mark still have work to do.\n\nOh it's nice to dry in here.\n\nIt's good to see you again.\n\nWell, pleased to meet you.\n\nMARK: And you.\n\nHello, I'm Phyllis.\n\nPleased to meet you.\n\nHi.\n\nNARRATOR: Those two are looking for a couple more objects.\n\nAlthough I think they're taking it in turns.\n\nWell we've got a dog.\n\nMaybe we should give it a cat.\n\nNARRATOR: Mark's got a similar approach, it seems.\n\nI think this is Indian.\n\nIndian brass.\n\nOh yes, cowbells.\n\nMARK: I think it's quite nicely made, actually.\n\nIt's all hand engraved there and [INAUDIBLE].. And the bells are quite nice.\n\nSo that would have been made when, do you think?\n\nMARK: You'd think something like that was fairly modern, wouldn't you really?\n\nYou know.\n\nBut I think it's got a bit of age.\n\nIf you look, this is all handmade nails here.\n\nI don't think it's any later than around about 1920.\n\nSo we're heading off to 100 years old.\n\nDo you think it would do well?\n\nThese type of items are becoming more collectible.\n\nYou know, Chinese, Indian, Arabic items with a bit of age.\n\nNARRATOR: The ticket price is 30 pounds.\n\nBut are they agreed?\n\nI mean if we could get that really down, I think it just might stand a chance.\n\nNot impressed with my old cow.\n\n[PHYLLIS CHUCKLES] You know people who go to the auction don't appreciate this type of art, and it could sell for a fiver.\n\nI know.\n\nI think it might.\n\nShould we leave it?\n\nI think we should leave we leave it.\n\nPHYLLIS: But then-- You're not indecisive at all, are you?\n\nLook, should we just [INAUDIBLE]??\n\nPHYLLIS: Yes.\n\nNARRATOR: Phew!\n\nWe finally got there.\n\nWe might have a little something which intrigued us.\n\nMARK: An old cow.\n\nThat's no way to speak to your guest!\n\nMARK: Well I just think it's rather fun.\n\nSHOP OWNER: It is.\n\nFar and away.\n\n10 pounds?\n\n[SHOP OWNER SNORTS] I hear you snorting there.\n\nMARK: 11?\n\nSHOP OWNER: Oh do try harder.\n\n11.50.\n\nSHOP OWNER: Come on.\n\n15?\n\n12 pounds.\n\nYes, 12 pounds.\n\n15.\n\nWell, 15 is such an odd number, isn't it?\n\n12 is pretty odd as well.\n\nMARK: Shall we say 50?\n\nAre we being too mean?\n\nI think we pay 15.\n\n15?\n\n15.\n\nDeal.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n15 pounds.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPHYLLIS: Thank you for the little cow and baby.\n\nI do hope we can milk a profit on it.\n\nOh!\n\nNARRATOR: Quite.\n\nTime to move on.\n\nMoooo.\n\nMoooo.\n\nNARRATOR: Now motoring towards the village of Hailsham and their last chance to buy.\n\nPHYLLIS: Oh Hello.\n\nYou must be Rhoda.\n\nI am, indeed.\n\nHello, I'm Phyllis.\n\n- Nice to meet you.\n\n- I'm Mark.\n\n- Hello Mark.\n\n- Lovely to meet you.\n\nWe've got you in the nick of time, but we have so little time.\n\nIs there something here, you think, you want to help two desperate people?\n\nNARRATOR: Interesting question, because as well as quite a few traditional antiques on offer, Rhoda has a bit of an eye-catching novelty item.\n\nAnyone spotted it yet?\n\nAh yes.\n\nSay hello to Diana.\n\n[OMINOUS MUSIC] MARK: Oh my gosh.\n\nIt's scary, isn't it?\n\nNARRATOR: Sounds like a \"no\" to the lovely Diana.\n\nAnything a bit smaller?\n\nMARK: This is quite interesting.\n\nHe looks like a sort of military Naval type, doesn't he?\n\nIs it a doorstop?\n\nIt is.\n\nIt's filled with lead in the bottom.\n\nIt looks 19th century.\n\nI mean I thought it might have been Nelson.\n\nUnfortunately he's not.\n\nPHYLLIS: No.\n\nMARK: We'd love it if we could find something with Nelson on it.\n\nOr we be absolutely ridiculous, and if the doll in the box is terribly cheap, we take that for a laugh.\n\nBecause Thomas and Kevin will think we've gone completely and utterly mad.\n\nAnd we have, haven't we?\n\nDiana in the box.\n\nMARK: Yes.\n\nLife size.\n\nThey won't be expecting that, will they.\n\nPHYLLIS: They certainly will not.\n\nBecause you hate the doll, don't you?\n\nOh, absolutely.\n\nAnd I hate the doll.\n\nOh I see.\n\nAnd they hate the doll.\n\nYes.\n\nNARRATOR: You don't have to buy it, Phyllis.\n\nPHYLLIS: I'm not even sure I want to touch it.\n\nAnd she's really this sort of-- MARK: I don't want to touch it.\n\nPHYLLIS: --plastic.\n\nIt's like a jockey's outfit, or something.\n\nMARK: I just think she is so ridiculously hideous.\n\nYeah.\n\nMARK: Could we appeal to your generous side, Rhoda?\n\nUh-huh?\n\nAnd could you please let us have it for 10 pounds?\n\nNo.\n\nWell I tried.\n\nI'll do her for 20.\n\nYes, go on then.\n\nAre you happy?\n\nYes, ecstatic.\n\nYou won't shout at me at the auction?\n\nNo.\n\nMARK: Let's not put any naked flames near her.\n\nHere you are, Rhoda.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nRHODA: Goodbye Diana.\n\nPHYLLIS: Get back in your box.\n\nMARK: Don't want to go back in the box.\n\nShe's going back in the box.\n\nMARK: I don't want to go back in the box.\n\nNARRATOR: Well, that rather unusual purchase completes their shopping.\n\nSo what will they make of each other's offerings?\n\nTHOMAS: I was going to let the lady reveal first.\n\nI think we should.\n\nI think that's very sensible.\n\nMARK: So I'm going to take this off first.\n\nTHOMAS: Right!\n\nOh interesting.\n\nNARRATOR: He is an actor.\n\nKEVIN: Well we've obviously got a doggy here.\n\nTHOMAS: Is that a Winstanley bulldog?\n\nI know, but I've seen the cats.\n\nI've never seen a bulldog.\n\nI've never seen a Winstanley bulldog.\n\nAnd I think he's rather charming.\n\nTHOMAS: OK. And the pair of chairs?\n\nMARK: The pair of chairs, again, are-- Are they inlaid?\n\nShould we walk around?\n\nCome on, Kevin.\n\nNo, they're inlaid.\n\nI did want a chair, but we got a pair.\n\nInlaid, and I've just seen the horror show.\n\nMARK: Yes.\n\nKEVIN: Oh my-- God almighty.\n\nMARK: You know that's the reaction I wanted.\n\nWhat have you done?\n\nBut I thought, rather than go safe, we'd go hideous.\n\nDidn't we?\n\nYes we did.\n\nKEVIN: That, you achieved, let me tell you.\n\nHow much is the horror show?\n\n20 quid.\n\nOh my-- So how much have you spent?\n\nMARK: Actually I'm sorry, we didn't spend a lot.\n\n20, 60, 80.\n\nMARK: 205 pounds.\n\nTHOMAS: We spent that on the first day!\n\nYeah, well, they're playing a canny game that I would never have considered myself.\n\nNARRATOR: Let's have a look at your booty then, chaps.\n\nMARK: Oh my gosh!\n\nTHOMAS: It's a pirate's pipe holder.\n\nA traveling pipe.\n\nPirates, yeah.\n\nMARK: I love it.\n\nIt's lovely.\n\nKEVIN: This is a compass from a World War II Lancaster or Wellington bomber.\n\nPHYLLIS: Oh!\n\nMARK: Oh wow!\n\nWhere did you get that?\n\nKEVIN: We got that in one of the tidiest places I've ever been in my life.\n\nAnd of course, this has a great relevance to me as being the instrument upon which the theme to Hancock is played.\n\n[PHYLLIS MIMICKING TUBA SOUNDS] MARK: I like that.\n\nNARRATOR: Mark and Phyllis definitely approve.\n\nBut the centerpiece-- and the biggest gamble for us-- is-- PHYLLIS: Fwishhhh!\n\nKEVIN (IMITATING TRUMPET): Tada!\n\nOh wow!\n\nSweet.\n\nGosh!\n\nNot the most practical thing for your home.\n\nTHOMAS: Not the most practical, but a fun object.\n\nKEVIN: I can't imagine our sets of objects being any more different.\n\nTHOMAS: They are.\n\nNARRATOR: But what did they really think?\n\nI've never seen such a pile of tat in all my life.\n\nI just thought it was all hideous.\n\nWell they managed to spend every last penny, practically.\n\nI don't dislike any of their items at all.\n\nPHYLLIS: No.\n\nI don't.\n\nIt's the worst thing in the world.\n\nIt's a horror show.\n\nI love the little Islamic brass and silver tray.\n\nPHYLLIS: That's lovely.\n\nWe have definitely won the battle.\n\nBut we could lose the war.\n\nHe loves the wartime stuff, Kevin.\n\nThe military thing I am quite frightened of.\n\nPHYLLIS: What, the compass?\n\nMARK: Mm.\n\nKEVIN: Thank you.\n\nI am proud that we have bought well like the true men we are.\n\nYes.\n\nLike the pirates!\n\nWe are the pirates, ha-har!\n\nTHOMAS: Let's go and tell them we think it's lovely.\n\nNARRATOR: After starting out in the Kent countryside at Barham, our celebrities and experts are making their way towards an auction in Greenwich, one of London's most internationally famous boroughs with a fine and rich maritime history.\n\nPHYLLIS: Well it's a lovely day for it.\n\nKEVIN: Brilliant, isn't it.\n\nThere's nice credit in it.\n\nI feel like a bit of an East End villain in this car, though.\n\nI used to drive for the Crasian.\n\nDid you?\n\nTHOMAS: How do you think you're going to fare at the auction?\n\nI'm not terribly confident, Tom.\n\nTo be honest.\n\nOh really?\n\nI honestly think that because you've spent little, you might gain a lot.\n\nI see what you mean.\n\nSo you're building up now already for [INAUDIBLE]..\n\nI am.\n\nI really like your stuff, but I don't think it's going to make any money.\n\nI know, I think that's probably a very fair appraisal and the way things are going to turn out.\n\nI really like it.\n\nI would, personally, have all your stuff.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut I wouldn't pay that for it.\n\nI wouldn't have yours in the house.\n\n[UPBEAT JAZZ PLAYING] Is it a tight squeeze?\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nNARRATOR: With everyone in a sparring mood, this Southeast road trip concludes at Greenwich auctions.\n\nReady for a trouncing?\n\nThey're the ones who should worry, aren't they.\n\nCome on, let's go in.\n\nShall we do it?\n\nYeah, we should do it.\n\nNARRATOR: So who will win the day?\n\nLet's hear from auctioneer, Robert Dodd.\n\nIt's an iconic piece.\n\nTypical 1970s.\n\nLovely.\n\nIt's got its box with the illustrations.\n\nAnd let's hope we've got a Diana doll collector.\n\nI think the one that's going to struggle is the harmonium.\n\nI don't think you'd be happy if you lived next door to someone who could play one of these things.\n\nNARRATOR: Yeah.\n\nKevin and Thomas bought five auction lots for a total cost of 375 pounds, whilst Phyllis mark also bought five auction lots, spending just 205 pounds.\n\nFasten your safety belts, it's going to be a bumpy ride.\n\nNARRATOR: First out of the traps-- Phyllis and Mark's bulldog.\n\nIt's going to make 65, 75 pounds.\n\nYou don't know that.\n\nStop trying to predict-- He's an auctioneer.\n\nOh yeah, but-- A really bad one.\n\nHave you been to a sales auction?\n\nWill you, please!\n\nIt's got a start, I think we may have 45 pound only on the bulldog.\n\nDo we have 48?\n\n50 with me.\n\nLooking for 55 anywhere.\n\nCome on.\n\nAre we all done?\n\nMARK: Come on.\n\nOn the bulldog glass toy at 50 pounds.\n\nOh no!\n\nWe've broken even on that one.\n\nIt's a travesty.\n\nIt's a travesty.\n\nI'm so disappointed.\n\nNARRATOR: He doesn't look all that happy, either.\n\n[INAUDIBLE],, but I want a bit of that 80, 85, 90.\n\nYou'd like that, don't you.\n\nYeah, I'll have a bit of that.\n\nNARRATOR: Hmm.\n\nThat may well be a pipe dream.\n\nIt's a lovely lot.\n\nAnd it's got to start with a bid with me of 22 pound on this, which is cheap.\n\nLooking for 25.\n\nI've got 22.\n\nGo on.\n\nAUCTIONEER: Looking for 25.\n\n28.\n\n30 on one.\n\n30 pound, or I'm out.\n\nLooking for 32.\n\nI've got 30 pound on it, I'm looking for 32 anywhere.\n\nAre we all done?\n\nLast time at 30 pounds.\n\nOh gosh.\n\nNARRATOR: Looks like Kevin's parrot endorsement didn't pay off.\n\nI just hope one ours creates a bit of-- I don't even mind if it's Phyllis's anymore.\n\nThat's very magnanimous of you.\n\nIt is magnanimous of me.\n\nNARRATOR: Now for Phyllis and Mark's table that wasn't even for sale.\n\nAnd it's got to start with a bid with me of 38 pounds.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] It's worth more than that.\n\n42 with me.\n\nLooking for 45.\n\n45 on the phone.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] AUCTIONEER: - 48 or I'm out.\n\nCome on, a bit more.\n\nAUCTIONEER: We all done?\n\nMARK: We need more.\n\n48 with the boys.\n\n50 I need.\n\nIt's important now.\n\nAUCTIONEER: 48 in the back of the room.\n\n50 pound only I need.\n\nMARK: Go on.\n\n50 I've got.\n\nI'll take 52.\n\n- Someone with taste.\n\nAUCTIONEER: Well done.\n\nLast time at 50.\n\nMARK: Come on a bit more.\n\n50 pounds.\n\nWell done.\n\nNARRATOR: Better than it might have been, but another loss, I'm afraid.\n\nIt all changes from now on in.\n\nDoes it?\n\nWe start with our tuba, and this is it.\n\nThis is our game changer.\n\nOh is it?\n\nThe game changes.\n\nThis is when you get really trounced.\n\nNARRATOR: Yeah, can that thing play The Last Post?\n\nLovely lot, this.\n\nQuality.\n\nGot to start with a bid with me on 35 pound only on that.\n\nIt's worth more than that.\n\nLooking for 38.\n\nI've got 35 on the Boosey & Co Tuba.\n\nI'm looking for 38.\n\nI've got 35.\n\nLook 38.\n\n40 with me.\n\nLooking for a 42.\n\nI'm looking for 42 anywhere.\n\nWe all done?\n\n- No!\n\nMore, more, more!\n\nAUCTIONEER: Last time on the tuba.\n\nAt 40 pound.\n\nOh Thomas.\n\nI think you were too \"boosey\" when you bought that.\n\nNo, we weren't boozy.\n\nNARRATOR: Someone's got a nice tuba for not very much money.\n\nI wonder how Phyllis's chairs will fare?\n\nI'm not sanguine.\n\nBut best of luck to you both.\n\nThank you.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] Paid to me, and only 45 pound on these on the pair.\n\nI've got 45.\n\nMARK: They're worth that each.\n\nThey are, at least.\n\n48.\n\n50.\n\n5.\n\nI'm out if you want them.\n\nGo on with him.\n\nGo on.\n\nYeah!\n\nAUCTIONEER: 55 I'm out.\n\nLooking for 60.\n\nBid at the back.\n\nYes.\n\nCome on.\n\nBid more.\n\nAUCTIONEER: 62.\n\nHello, stop shaking your head.\n\n62.\n\nCan't get a Happy Meal for that.\n\nYeah, 60 pound.\n\n62.\n\nYes!\n\nCome on, a bit more.\n\n68 of seven-- no?\n\n68 there.\n\nLooking for 70.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nLast time.\n\nAt 68 pound.\n\nTHOMAS: Oh, well done.\n\nNARRATOR: Sadly, that's a loss after auction costs.\n\nTHOMAS: Our first profit.\n\nWell done.\n\nNow it's \"our\".\n\nOh yes, did you hear that?\n\nHe's like, we're all in it together.\n\nIt's \"our\" profit.\n\nWe're going to take a commission-- No it's not.\n\nIt's ours.\n\nI'm going to call them the coalition from now.\n\nWe're all in it together.\n\nNARRATOR: Kevin and Thomas's plate is up next.\n\nI'm feeling bad that they're over 100 quid now.\n\nI'm feeling bad there's over 20 quid, actually.\n\nAnd it's got to start with a bid with me, straight in at 32 pounds.\n\nWe've got a long way to go.\n\nLong way to go.\n\n35.\n\n38.\n\n45.\n\n55.\n\n65.\n\n75.\n\n80.\n\nI'm out.\n\nGo on, more.\n\nLooking for 85.\n\nI've got 80 pound.\n\nI'm looking for 85 on this dish.\n\nAre we all done?\n\nNo, we can see more.\n\ncome on.\n\nLast time at 80 pounds.\n\nBad luck.\n\nThat was like a knife in my heart.\n\nNARRATOR: Can you be coppered off?\n\nAt least Phyllis and Mark's figurines came cheap.\n\nAUCTIONEER: Great likeness.\n\nIt's a late 19th-early 20th century.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] And it's got to start with a bid with me of only 10 pound on this.\n\nOh!\n\nLooking for 12.\n\nIt's worth all of that, the golden calf sculpture.\n\nCome on.\n\nI've got 10, 12, 15 with me.\n\nLooking for 18.\n\nI've got 15.\n\nOh come on.\n\nAre we all done?\n\nYou sure?\n\nAt 15 pound.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nBecause I really loved that.\n\nCan we have our money back?\n\nNo.\n\nCan we go out and do it again?\n\nThis is just a dress rehearsal.\n\nCan we do it next week?\n\nYay!\n\nWhen we really do it, it's going to be much better, right?\n\nYes, it is.\n\n, NARRATOR: Yeah, break a leg, everyone.\n\nTat.\n\nAre you talking about us?\n\nI'm talking about your doll.\n\nIs that the last lot?\n\nI think it's your last lot.\n\nThat's your piece de resistance.\n\nIgnore him.\n\nI do.\n\nThey really are a pair of pirates.\n\nWe are.\n\nPenzance and Caribbean over there.\n\nIt's the compass which guides us to our golden doubloons.\n\nOh.\n\nNARRATOR: The Isle of Dogs, more like.\n\nGoing to start with a bid with me of only 45 pound.\n\nWe want more.\n\nCome on.\n\nLooking for 48.\n\nHello?\n\nIs there anyone out there?\n\n[LAUGHTER] AUCTIONEER: 55.\n\n65.\n\nI'm out.\n\n62 I'll take.\n\nFor two

right?\n\nYou've got to pamper him.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nStroke his ego.\n\nNARRATOR: I'd almost given up hope.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIt's the doll.\n\nIt's the doll from hell.\n\nThis is going to walk us right into profit.\n\nNARRATOR: Was that a joke, Mark?\n\nThere will be no justice if that is the case.\n\nI won't be able to show my face.\n\nDon't be so bitter.\n\nWhere do you think this is anyway now?\n\nYou'll be known as the doll lady from now on, won't you?\n\nAttention please.\n\nAbsolutely cracking, stunning, lot coming up here.\n\nI've got to be honest with you, I want to start this at three grand.\n\n[LAUGHTER] It's got to start with a BID with me of only 18 pounds.\n\nOh!\n\nI want 20 pounds on this.\n\nI've got 18.\n\nI want 20 pound on the doll.\n\nCome on.\n\nI'm not moving on.\n\nMight as well stay.\n\nAll I want is 20 pound.\n\nIt's worth all of that.\n\n20 pounds I've got.\n\nLooking for 22.\n\nDid you bid?\n\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\nI'll take 21.\n\nI'll do 50, please.\n\nI've got 20 there.\n\nI'll take 21 pound.\n\nWe all done?\n\nLast time.\n\nOh!\n\n21 there.\n\n[LAUGHTER] AUCTIONEER: 22 on you, madame.\n\nYou can't pull out now, you started.\n\n22 pounds I've got.\n\n23 there.\n\nLooking for 24.\n\n24 pound I've got.\n\n25 there.\n\nLooking for 26.\n\nGo on.\n\nGo on.\n\nAre we all done?\n\nLast time.\n\nAre you all sure?\n\nYou'll kick yourself when you get home.\n\n[LAUGHTER] - 24.\n\nLooking for 26.\n\nAre we all done?\n\nLast time at 25 pounds.\n\nOh Mark!\n\nNARRATOR: She'd make a good scarecrow for someone.\n\nNow for our climax.\n\nThat man I hired with a sandwich board saying, harmonium for sale, is obviously paying off.\n\nNARRATOR: Let's pull out all the stops.\n\nHa!\n\nWe tried to go online to find out if there was a Harmonium Appreciation Society, but they closed in about 1795.\n\n[LAUGHTER] Let's get down to it.\n\nBids we made at only 70 pounds on that harmonium table.\n\nI want 75.\n\nI've got 70 for it.\n\nI want 75.\n\nIt's worth all of that.\n\nIt is.\n\n75.\n\n80 pounds.\n\n85.\n\n90 pounds.\n\n95 I need.\n\nI want 95 anywhere.\n\nIt is working.\n\n95 I need.\n\nI'll take 92.\n\n90, I'm looking for 92.\n\nNo.\n\nNo!\n\nLast time for 90 pounds.\n\nOh.\n\nOh.\n\nThat's it.\n\nIt's all over.\n\n90 pounds.\n\nNARRATOR: That organ failure has almost certainly sunk the pirates.\n\nBut Thomas has the scores.\n\nTHOMAS: I've done my math.\n\nPHYLLIS: Uh-huh.?\n\nTell us.\n\nI'm afraid, Kevin, you're taking out the recycling.\n\nOh.\n\nSix weeks.\n\n- Oh.\n\nYes!\n\nYes!\n\nYes!\n\nWell done.\n\nNobody likes a gloater, Phyl.\n\nOh.\n\nNARRATOR: Kevin and Thomas began with 400 pounds, and after paying auction costs, they made a loss of 116 pounds and 70 p leaving them with just 283 pounds and 30p.\n\nWhilst Phyllis and Mark, who also started out with 400 pounds made, after paying auction costs, a loss of 34 pounds and 44p.\n\nSo they are today's victors with 365 pounds and 56p.\n\nThere's really nothing in it.\n\n[LAUGHTER] We've had a great time.\n\nIt's been fantastic.\n\nTHOMAS: I'm very sorry we didn't make any money.\n\nI know, but it was really good fun.\n\nTough luck.\n\nOh, never mind.\n\nIt's been a real pleasure.\n\n- It's been fantastic.\n\n- You too.\n\n- Well done, victor.\n\n- Thanks, Tom.\n\nThank you, Mark.\n\nLet's do it again sometime.\n\nWell done, us.\n\nSee you later.\n\nNARRATOR: Bye bye.\n\n[ENGINE STARTING] We'll flog the Jag and make some money.\n\n[PHYLLIS CHUCKLES] [UPBEAT MUSIC]"
