        "text": "The Lost Love in the Foreign Land\n\nThe Jeffersonian team investigates the murder of an immigrant maid whose remains were found on the side of the road. The victimâs wealthy former employer, Sandra Zins, is a key suspect in the case, but when the team discovers that the victim might have been brought into the country illegally, the team realizes the case is much bigger than it seemed. Amidst talks of marriage between Cam and âsquinternâ Arastoo, tensions rise between Brennan and Cam as Arastoo prepares his dissertation for Brennanâs approval.\n\nThe Russian\n\nThe team investigate a multi-millionaire Soviet investor, who the government see as the saviour of the NHS. But is his offer of financial intervention too good to be true?\n\nEpisode 10\n\nThe environmental terrorist group, Divine Earth, has stormed the Thames Barrier and is threatening to flood London if the Government doesn't publish a secret document entitled Aftermath. An emergency meeting of senior Ministers and security services is called, and an engineer explains the death and destruction they face if the terrorists carry out their threat. The Deputy Prime Minister denies any knowledge of the Aftermath document, making it impossible to meet the terrorists' demands."
