        "text": "Truly a classic! Downton Abbey caught the attention of millions of viewers throughout its six seasons — and fans are still binge-watching the drama well after its finale.\n\nThe British series aired on ITV from 2010 to 2015 and was brought to PBS audiences across the pond. Starring Hugh Bonneville, Dame Maggie Smith and more iconic English actors, the show was met with critical acclaim and earned numerous awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film and an Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries.\n\nNot only was Downton Abbey a major hit on the small screen, but it was also transformed into movie magic. Several of the original cast members reprised their roles in two feature-length film spinoffs of the successful series in 2019 and 2022.\n\nScroll down to learn what the cast of Downton Abbey is up to now:"
