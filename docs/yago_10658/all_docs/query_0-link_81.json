        "text": "In the UK thereâ€™s nothing we enjoy more than drama.\n\nBe it a sensational soap opera storyline, a shocking news story or a last minute score in a sporting event, nothing grips the nation quite like drama.\n\nYou can most certainly throw historical television dramas into that category, be it fictional or, well slightly fictional.\n\nREAD MORE: Downton Abbey actress Tuppence Middleton to star in new horror film\n\nThe Crown and Downton Abbey have had viewers on the edge of their seats for a number of years.\n\nBoth have won multiple Emmy awards, have been viewed millions of times and are one of the most successful shows ever produced by their respective production companies, Carnival Films and Netflix.\n\nBut the series have more in common than the numerous accolades theyâ€™ve shared.\n\nThere are a number of links between actors from both Downton Abbey, filmed on the cusp of Hampshire at Highclere Castle, and The Crown.\n\nMatt Smith, former Doctor Who and The Crown star, was in a relationship for a number of years with Downton star Lily James after meeting on set of the movie Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\n\nAmy Nuttall, who captured the imagination as Ethel Parks in Downton, tied the knot to Andrew Buchan in 2012, who portrayed Andrew Parker Bowles in series three and four of The Crown.\n\nThe pair are however not the only married couple who have starred on both shows.\n\nPhyllis Logan is perhaps best known for her role as stern but loyal housekeeper Elsie Hughes-Carson in Downton Abbey.\n\nThe 65-year-old has played the character in every season of the television series and in the Downton Abbey movie. She is also set to return for Downton Abbey: A New Era, the sequel movie set to be released in the new year.\n\nOn screen her characterâ€™s relationship with butler Mr Carson develops into a romantic one, with the pair marrying in series six.\n\nOff screen however the Scot is married to actor Kevin McNally who not only starred in The Crown, but also appeared in Downton.\n\nThe couple met in 1994 and have a son David who was born two years later. The pair didn't marry until 2011 and currently live in London.\n\nBristol born actor Kevin, who is perhaps best known for his role as Joshamee Gibbs in all five of the Pirates of the Caribbean films., appeared as Horace Bryant in the ITV drama.\n\nHorace was the father of Major Bryant, who arrived at Downton to receive treatment due to his injuries in the Great War. Major Bryant would go on to have an affair with maid Ethel, a move which led to both having to leave the home.\n\nThe maid would discover that she was pregnant after and to earn money for her son, who she named Charlie, she turned to prostitution. Major Bryant sadly died during one of the last war battles.\n\nHis parents, including Kevin McNally's character, returned in series three and eventually took Charlie back with them after Ethel gave him up so he could have the life she wanted for him.\n\nIn The Crown, Kevin portrayed Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's chief press secretary during her time as Prime Minister.\n\nHe is also set to guest star in the upcoming season of Doctor Who."
