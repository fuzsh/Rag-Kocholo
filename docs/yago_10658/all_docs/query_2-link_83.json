        "text": "The Downton Abbey cast are hopeful that a movie of the beloved TV series will be made.\n\nPhyllis Logan, who played Mrs Hughes in the long-running drama, insisted she didn't take any props from the set when the show finished because she is sure she will need them again for a big-screen adaptation.\n\nShe told You magazine: \"People ask me if I was tempted to take a wig or that big bunch of keys I carried, but that would be theft, because these things aren’t my property.\n\n\"Besides, if there’s a Downton movie, which I hope will happen, all the props and costumes will be needed.\n\n\"It's like herding cats! We’re all so busy and in different countries, but it would be such fun to get together again. The camaraderie on set was extraordinary.\"\n\nRecently, Jim Carter - who portrayed Mr Carson in the show - revealed that the cast have been asked to clear their diaries to shoot a film of the hit period drama later this year.\n\nHe said: \"We've been asked to keep ourselves available for dates in the future. But nobody has seen a script.\"\n\nJoanne Froggatt - who portrayed Anna Smith in the period drama for five years - set tongues wagging last year when she revealed that Julian Fellowes had penned the script for the forthcoming blockbuster.\n\nShe said at the time: \"We've all heard that the script has been written.\n\n\"There's a hard copy somewhere but none of us have seen it or know what's in it.\n\n\"So we'll all keep our fingers crossed that it all comes together. We're all willing it to happen. I'd absolutely jump at the chance to star in it if I'm asked. I'll squeeze it in.\"\n\nViewers were thrown into mourning in 2015 when 'Downton...' came to a dramatic end following five years on screen but creator Julian has always shared his burning desire to turn the drama into a film.\n\nHe said: \"Let's just say it's not me slowing things down. The difficulty is rounding up the actors. One is in America making a new series, another is in a play. But ,my lips are sealed!\n\n\"It's very unlikely there won't be a film because there is an audience out there for it. I do hope there is going to be a 'Downton Abbey' film. It's going to be fun once everything is sorted but we just need to restructure it.\""
