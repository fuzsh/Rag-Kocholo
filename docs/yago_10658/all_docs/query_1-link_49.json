She added that the new storyline would \"keep audiences on the edge of their seats\".\n\n\"We're very excited to see the show embark on this fantastic new chapter, with its unique blend of haunting atmosphere, rich character and emotional storytelling,\" she said.\n\nLogan, 67, from Paisley, last year featured in Downton Abbey: A New Era and previously played Maggie Smart in The Good Karma Hospital.\n\nShe joins a host of new additions to the cast, including Jamie Sives, who appeared in Guilt, Dawn Steele, who has been in Granite Harbour, and Don Gilet, who starred in EastEnders.\n\nThe cast will also include Ann Louise Ross and Deacon Blue singer, Lorraine McIntosh.\n\nSeries regulars, Alison O'Donnell (DS Alison \"Tosh\" McIntosh), Steven Robertson (Sandy), Lewis Howden (Billy) and Anne Kidd (Cora) will also return.\n\nKate Bartlett, executive producer for Silverprint Pictures, which produces the show, said: \"Paul Logue has created a distinctive and emotionally complex story, set against the stunning and evocative landscape of the Shetland Isles.\n\n\"We're thrilled to be making this new series with such incredible Scottish talent.\""
