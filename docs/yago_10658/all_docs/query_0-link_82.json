        "text": "Which Unforgotten Season 3 star is married to a beloved Downton Abbey cast member? Which one has royal MASTERPIECE ties? And which one appeared on some of the earliest MASTERPIECE shows in the 1970s? Find out when you consult our list of this season’s stars and why you might recognize them!\n\n1.\n\nAlex Jennings\n\nJennings plays Dr. Tim Finch, one of the four friends renting a holiday home at the same time and location of Hayley Reid’s murder in Unforgotten, Season 3. Though all four claim to have no connection to the Reid case, the stories they relay to the police are murky at best, and Cassie and Sunny are determined to get to the truth.\n\nMASTERPIECE fans will recognize Jennings as Queen Victoria and Prince Albert’s uncle Leopold I, King of Belgium, from Victoria, as well as from Cranford, Silk and Churchill’s Secret. Jennings also appeared in The Queen in 2006 as Prince Charles, and in the series The Crown as David, Duke of Windsor, among other roles.\n\nJennings’ Unforgotten performance has already earned him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) nomination for Supporting Actor in 2019.\n\n2.\n\nKevin McNally\n\nMcNally plays TV personality and murder suspect James Hollis, whose version of the fateful night does not add up with the version his ex-wife told to the police.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for his years starring as Joshamee Gibbs, trusty right hand man to Captain Jack Sparrow, in the popular Disney movie series Pirates of the Caribbean. MASTERPIECE fans will recognize him from his appearances across the years, including as Drake Carne in the original Poldark series, as Horace Bryant in Downton Abbey, Season 2, and in productions of Wuthering Heights and I, Claudius.\n\n(Fun fact: McNally is married to actress Phyllis Logan, Downton Abbey‘s very own Mrs. Hughes!)\n\n3.\n\nJames Fleet\n\nFleet plays down-on-his-luck Chris Lowe, an artist living out of his van with his dog by his side. His luck may be finally changing for the better, but a dark past record of his own and his possible connection to the Hayley Reid case may hold him back.\n\nMASTERPIECE fans may recall Fleet as Lord Hawthorne in Indian Summers, as Mr. Bennett in Death Comes to Pemberley, or as Frederik Dorrit in Little Dorrit. He has also appeared in Sense and Sensibility, Four Weddings and a Funeral and The Phantom of the Opera.\n\n4.\n\nNeil Morrissey\n\nMorrissey plays Pete Carr, the friend struggling to keep his life afloat, between a difficult boss, questionable job stability, and a wife who is unhappy with their marriage, their finances, and their life. His checkered business history makes DCI Cassie Stuart and DI Sunny Khan wonder who Pete Carr really is.\n\nMorrissey has previously appeared in The Night Manager, Line of Duty, and even lent his vocal talents to Bob the Builder as the titular handyman. MASTERPIECE fans may know him from Grantchester, as Harding Redmond in the second season of the Mystery! series.\n\n5.\n\nPeter Egan\n\nPeter Egan returns once again this season as DCI Cassie Stuart’s lovable, good-natured father (and roommate), Martin Hughes. With his new relationship growing more serious, however, he’s spending less time at home, but his age and state of mind are concerning Cassie more and more.\n\nEgan has appeared in a number of notable MASTERPIECE shows over the years including Lillie as Oscar Wilde, in Downton Abbey as Hugh ‘Shrimpie’ MacClare, and Paradise Postponed. He was even seen in some of the earliest MASTERPIECE shows from its first season: Elizabeth R and Cold Comfort Farm.\n\n6.\n\nAmanda Root\n\nAmanda Root plays Carol Finch, the soft spoken, supportive second wife of Dr. Tim Finch, and stepmother to his two daughters, Emma and Claire.\n\nRoot has recently been seen on MASTERPIECE in Sherlock (The Six Thatchers as Emma Welsborough), but was also featured in Anna Karenina as Dolly, Persuasion as Anne Elliot, Daniel Deronda as Mrs. Davilow, and The Forsyte Saga as Winifred.\n\nRoot has also starred in films such as The Iron Lady and Jane Eyre (1996).\n\n7.\n\nEmma Fielding\n\nEmma Fielding, who plays James Hollis’ second wife Amy Hollis and stepmother to the troubled, struggling Elliot, can also be seen in MASTERPIECE’s Les Misérables as Nicolette, servant to Monsieur Gillenormand and caretaker of young Marius. Fielding is no strange to MASTERPIECE, having also appeared in Dark Angel, Cranford and Arthur & George.\n\nLooking to binge watch (and then re-watch!) all three seasons of Unforgotten?
