In this episode of Overlooked, the guys look at “Galaxis” (also known as Terminal Force). The sacred crystal, the source of all life, becomes the center of a cosmic struggle. Kyla (Richard Moll) seeks its power, but Ladera (Brigitte Nielsen) races against time to secure the identical crystal on Earth.
