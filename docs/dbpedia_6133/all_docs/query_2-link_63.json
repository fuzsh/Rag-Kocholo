        "text": "After traditional art forms such as painting and photography, film production quickly recognized the potential of NFT technology. The key question here too is what fans get for their money.\n\nFilm stars have attracted a lot of fans in every era. Their emblematic figures, their characters embodied in film, are looked upon with longing by millions of fans. Stars have always been far from ordinary people who adore them. But the latest uses of NFT have brought major changes. The NFTs of well-known stars now offer much more than simple merchandise opportunities and the stars have realized this. They are getting closer to their fans and addressing them with personal messages.\n\nThe recently released and instantly sell-out Anthony Hopkins collection is no longer just a visual artwork. Thanks to the dynamic NFT features, the lucky ones will receive a personalized message, others will enjoy a signed book by the artist, and the luckiest ones will be part of a shared fan video call.\n\nThe Stallone collection which is scheduled to launch soon will also build a community with plenty of personal messages. Discord communities also offer a platform for fans to communicate regularly with this famous action hero. The upcoming campaign’s NFT brings to life characters from his previous films, with humorous, cartoon-like visuals. Stallone is offering prospective NFT customers a joint online presentation and, of course, a much more direct way to interact with him than before.\n\nA Film for Fans by Fans.\n\nThe film industry seems to be democratized with the help of NFTs. The sale of NFTs to raise money for film production is becoming increasingly popular among those who want to break with traditional methods of financing. For example, the Forest Road Company has launched a $20 million NFT fund to help Independent Filmmakers. Independent directors now have a much better chance of competing with the exclusivity of the large Studios.\n\nNFT funding allows filmmakers to find or build a community of people passionate about the subject matter, who, through their NFT purchase, become shareholders in the resulting work.\n\nA technology that enables Filmmakers\n\nGalaxis was one of the first to partner with well-known filmmakers and former movie stars. Its first forays into community-building came with filmmaker-turned-artist Val Kilmer and his team with the Kamp Kilmer project, launched spring of 2022. The artist defines Kamp Kilmer as a place of collaboration, creativity, and real connection between people. A true community of artists and art lovers, a place to collaborate, play and have fun together.\n\nA bright Future for Filmmakers\n\nDiversity and a wealth of ideas characterize the connection between Filmmaking and the NFT world. A true “blue ocean”, where many more surprising and exciting solutions will be created soon. Here too, the community can give new “fuel” to projects that would never have a chance to come to life without fans.\n\nA whole range of examples of use cases could be cited, from the sale of film frames to online fan screenings with NFT passes to a wide range of film meta and multiverses and games, to personal enthusiast activism, the new technology offers thousands of opportunities. The process has already begun, and we are at seed stage of the widespread adoption of cinematic NFTs. So, stay tuned!\n\nAbout Galaxis\n\nGalaxis is a cutting-edge, no-code, out-of-the-box NFT toolkit that transforms and enhances the relationship between any creator and their community by infusing NFTs with unique utility traits, owner-specific benefits, and interactive communication opportunities.
