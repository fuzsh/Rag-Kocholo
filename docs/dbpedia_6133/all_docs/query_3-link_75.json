        "text": "This DMX interface is used to easily control effect devices with a DMX-512 input with a PFE Advanced receiver and to integrate these devices in the system. Typical applications are the control of smoke machines and flame projectors.\n\nIt is required that the receiver is equipped with the Terminal function. This enables the user to program several firing cues to each output and to determine the duration how long the outputs should be active.\n\nThe interface comes with a safety input and five control inputs and is powered from the receiver. In general the safety input is used for the power supply. As soon as voltage is present on the safety input a DMX signal is being generated with DMX channel 1 on 100%. The inputs 1-5 are translated to the DMX channels 2-6 (0% or 100%).\n\nEven though DMX is considered to be an unsafe protocol (no checksums or other safety measures are implemented) the usage of this interface is rather safe, because the DMX signal is only generated if the interface is powered from the receiver’s output.\n\n(Low Voltage Switching Interface)\n\nThis interface has two channels and it can be used whenever a device to be controlled requires a potential-free electrical contact. The outputs are optically isolated from the inputs.\n\nThe typical application for this interface is the control of film and photo cameras, high speed cameras and also smoke machines or all kinds of effect devices.\n\nNormally it is used together with a receiver PFE Advanced 10 Outputs with Terminal function so that the duration how long the contacts will be closed can be programmed in the receiver’s menu. In addition several cues can be programmed to each output of the receiver.\n\nBy connecting this interface to a receiver PFE Profi 3/10 Outputs or PFE Advanced 10/20 Outputs all kinds of devices that are powered with 230V mains supply can be controlled, i.e. switched on and off. This interface acts like a switch in the power cable.\n\nEspecially the usage of an Advanced receiver is meaningful together with the Terminal function, because this way several firing cues can be programmed to each output and in addition the duration how long the output should be active can be determined.\n\nTypical applications are the control of wind machines, electromagnetic valves, electric motors and effect devices of all kinds.\n\nThis interface can be used to control all common digital SLR cameras. Depending on the camera model, this interface is provided with the appropriate connector on the output side. Therefore, please specify which camera is to be controlled when ordering.\n\nThe Photo Interface is designed for operation with the PFE Advanced 10/100 Outputs in 10-Output mode.\n\nThis interface has two channels and takes over the function of the two trigger points of the manual shutter release. The first channel gives the signal for focusing and the second channel releases the shutter. Therefore, the application is ideal together with the Terminal function of the firing module."
