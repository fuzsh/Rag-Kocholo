SEARS A CLOVER PiMMiiM DOLORES FULLER wasn’t just an actress who lived with Ed Wood Jr. and co-starred with him in GLEN OR GLENDA. She went on to a successful new career as a songwriter - for ELVIS movies! Fuller also acted in Ron Ormond movies and was once a regular on the incredible QUEEN FOR A DAY show. S. L. Duff recently was amazed to discover that Fuller (now in her 70s) was his upstairs neighbor (on Fuller Ave. in Hollywood) and foimd out her stranger than fiction show biz story before she moved back to Las Vegas. Duff has been in bands and played on records with people like 45 Grave, Jeff Dahl, Redd Kross and Wayne Kramer and has written for Creem, Billboard, Rip and other publications. CHRIS MITCHUM has been a boxoffice draw in most of the world since the 70s. Mitchum has many incredible tales of shady overseas features, being ripped off and even imprisoned by producers! He worked with John Wayne, for Jesus Franco and of course his father is Robert. Michum was interviewed by Brett McCormick of Fort Worth (who also interviewed Fred Williamson for PV). Brett recently directed BIOTECH WARRIOR and DANGEROUS GAMES for Roger Corman. DON “THE DRAGON^ WILSON is a major star in the direct to video world. Wilson, a former World Kickboxing champion, has been in a surprising number of action movies (most for PM Video and Corman’s Concorde/New Horizons), often with sci fi plots. He was interviewed by Rodd Lott, of Oklahoma City, who is the publisher of Hitch magazine (see Zines). L. Q. JONES returns with part 2 of his career interview. We pick up his long and amazing story with Peckinpah’s THE WILD BUNCH and look into the cult sci fi movie he directed, A BOY AND HIS DOG. Both of these have recently been released uncut on laser disc and after a few years from the screen, L. Q. is back big time with a major role in Scorsese’s CASINO. He was interviewed by Justin Humphreys from Lynchburg, VA, who also interviewed Royal Dano for PV. PSYCHOTRONIC® NUMBER 22, 1996 PUBLISHER/EDITOR Michael J.

Roger Corman now has his own New Horizons Video (and is producing movies for Showtime), Charles Band has his own Full Moon Video, and even Troma has it’s own video company now. Corman and Band are releasing more new titles, (now including “family” features) than ever. Some are even good! Other “B” title video specialists (like A.I.P.) are gone, but others like P.M. and A- Pix and the more respectable sounding Republic and Turner keep cranking them out. With releases from these companies, all the review copies of older rarities we receive from mail order companies and all the indy releases sent by directors and producers, there is no danger of running out of review material. I don’t feel especially paranoid to sometimes think that relentless on line propaganda (do people talk about anything else these days?), seriously escalating paper costs (a criminal investigation has been promised), rising postage rates and recent major distributor mega mergers are part of a conspiracy to end smaller print publications. PV is doing fine, despite all this, but I’m glad that I’ve retained control of this self published zine. It’s unsettling to see my childhood favorite FM (Famous Monsters Of Filmland) taken away from editor and founder Forry Ackerman. In my dreams, PV comes out more often, is always on time and is ad free. In the real world, I want to stop and thank all our reliable advertisers for helping to make PV possible. Meanwhile, yes, this issue is later than usual. Besides the holidays and computer and electricity problems, we experienced record breaking blizzards and severe flooding around here. We were stuck in NYC when only National Guard trucks were on the streets, snowed in at our house, then had to have the basement pumped out twice. It’s still snowing, but here is #22. PSYCHOTRONIC® NUMBER 22, 1996 THANKS TO: Dolores Fuller, L. Q. Jones, Christopher Mitchum, Don “The Dragon” Wilson, Frank Henenlotter, Andrew Klyde, Gordon Smith, Harry Medved, Dave Billman, Murph, Ronald Leyendecker, Terrance Jennings Wharton, Richard C.

DEDICATED TO: The Standard in Cleveland. COVER: Luciana Paluzzi in THE GREEN SLIME (68), a Toho/MGM production. HOW ROCK + ROLL NEARLY ENDED (Pt. 2) 67 OTIS REDDING plane crash, Brian Epstein ODS. Three separate ROLLING STONES drug busts. 68 Lennon, Jagger both busted in London. 69 BRIAN JONES drowns, George Harrison drug bust in London.

JONES Glad you got around to L.Q. Jones, though all that early macho stuff was a bit of a wade for my tastes. Can’t wait for the details of the interesting little production company. One of my favorite movie moments is Strother Martin simpering, “Enter, forget another lifetime.. .in the Brotherhood Of Satan!” - Michael Will (Montreal) 'n)e photo on pg. 50 is from THE HUNTING PART)'. And there is no Ralph Walsh (it was supossed to say Raoul!) BRUCE GLOVER I believe PRIEST WITH A MACHINE GUN must have been the pilot episode of the cop comedy THE PARTNERS. The black actor unamed by I loved the Dean Stockwell interview, so I decided to rent one of his films from my local video store not included in his filmography. It’s a Brazilian film called THE LONG HAUL (88) and plays like a loose remake of the classic WAGES OF FEAR. Top billed Stockwell (featured on the cover art) has a guest role as a ruthless truck company owner called Mario (I). All the cast are Brazillian actors poorly dubbed into English and directed by Paulo Thiago. - Adam Kerrigan (Manly, NSW, Australia) Info also provided by Mikael Bruzell (Karlskrona, Sweden) who added the credits PAPA WAS A PREACHER (85) and JORGE UM BRASIUERO (88) We just watched a new episide of the Australian TV series BANJO PATTERSON’S THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER featuring Dean Stockwell! He starred as a supposedly blind pianist and piano tuner who Choulardi PAPA/BIRD Canton’s late night SON OF GHOUL show, patterned after Ghoulardi’s old program in Cleveland moved to Akron’s Ch 29 in Nov. The first movie on the new (prime time) show was GODZILLA VS. MEGALON. In Oct., WOAC TV 67 fired it’s entire staff including Kevin “Son Of Ghoul” Scarpino to make way for an all infomerical channel. The last movie featured on the Canton show was the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, followed by a special including old skits and nostalgia stuff. The Son Of Ghoul debuted in 86 and Scarpino captured headlines when Ron “The Ghoul” Swede, a protege of Ghoulardi (then on Cleveland’s channel 6l) sued him. The lawsuit was dismissed. - Mark J. Price (North Canton, Ohio) So, a mutant version of Ernie Anderson 's Glmdardi character lives on 33 (!) years after it was created. All three Northern Ohio TV horror hosts frequetitly played the Rivington's original Papa Oom Mow Mow record. Fafis of GHOULARDI (or just fans of great music) should setid $11.50 ^pd) to Dave Billman (3918 Croydon Rd., Norton, Ohio 44203) for his STAY SICK! (The Music Of Ghoulardi) cassette. IPs very complete (even the obscure polkas are tlyere), has the voice of Ernie 'Ghoulardi Anderson from original 60s broadcasts and is well north the bucks. Also urite to Ghoulardi expert and collector Murph (M. G.), (Box 1398, Makawao, Hawaii, 96768) and ask about his annual Ghoulardi Archives. He's a former Clevelander who got smart and moved where its nice and warm (unlike NY State). Hmnks to the several people who pointed out that former Cletolander Dreiv Careys recetUly uore a Ghoulardi siveatshirt on his DREW CARE)'sl)ow. Glover was Rupert Crosse, who had been in John Cassavettes and Monte Heilman movies plus THE MONKEES. A Nicholson pal, he was supposed to play Mulhall in THE LAST DETAIL, but died soon before the film began. Crosse was a martial arts practicioner and I remember reading that he and PARTNERS co-star Don Adams hated each other. - Hugh Shelton (Centerline, MI) The NBC show last for one year (71-2) Jeff Burr's NIGHT OF THE SCARECROW (featuring Glover) has been released by Republic. As manager of Century’s Alan Theatre in New Hyde Park, I ran WALKING TALL for about a month (you don’t think Wynorski PAID to see it “30” times do you?). BIG BAD MAMA II was the first film that I worked on when I moved out here (in 87). I delivered Glover his copy of the BBM2 script (he was conducting an acting class). I wound up doubling him at the film’s climax. After he t^es a fatal shotgun blast, it’s me lying on the ground. I also appeared as the corpse of Charles Cyphers. Bob Sheridan (Culver City, CA) Strand Releasing, who struck a deal with Russ Meyer to rerelease FASTER PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! announced they will also rerelease WHO KILLED TEDDY BEAR. The Spielberg Zorro project (Books column) has now been given to Robert Rodriguez. Mark Edward Heuck (Columbus, Ohio). TEDDY BEAR (65) is a should be cult psycho movie covered in part one of our Glover interview. Heuck also wants to remind mid Ohio readers that although the Drexel North is now a Revco drug store, the two other Columbus area Drexel theatres are alive and well. (MEET THE PEEBLES was a recetit midnight movie!) STOCKWELL 4 P • S • Y • C • H T • R N • I • C steals money from banks. There is a great scene in which he describes the Australian townsfolk as hicks, morons and cretins. - David Tamsitt (Sydney, Australia) 1 was the voice of Price Chamiing for Walt Disney (in person). Perhaps when Dean Stodw-ell was a child, his father misled him so as to be a hero in his son’s eyes. Anyway, my friend, writer Tom Weaver thought I ought to set it straight. 1 recorded it in 49. Release was in 50. - William Edward Phipps (Malibu, CA) Stockwell didn 't say it. We got tl)e u rong info elsewh^e. His stage actor father was probably up for tl)e part. Phipps also acted in Ard) Obler's FIVE (51) and THE TWONKY (52), THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, INVADERS FROM MARS and aT WOMEN OF THE MOON (all 53) and THE SNOW CREATURE (54)! Stockwell was also on a weird COMBAT. He played a fatalistic gloryhog whose soldier father died in WWl iind grandfather perished during the Spanish-American War, so he figured he was doomed anyway and kamakazied through each skirmish. If it was a Robert Altman COMBAT it explains his cameo in THE PLAYER. Stockwell also appears in TWISTED ISSUES in a clip from PSYCHOUT. - Hugh Shelton (Centerline, Ml) Some recent Stockwell credits are MR. WRONG, the TV moines TWIUGHT MAN and CLOSE TO DANGER and roles on NOWHERE MAN and THE COMMISH (a 2 hour episode). For more news about Stockwell, ask Margaret Colchin (Box 30784, Kfioxville, TV 37930) about COMING ATTRAaiONS, her QUANTUM LEAP neusletter. The show is now airing on USA arid the SCI FI Channel. ETC. RE: Paul Petrosky’s letter concerning the late William Girdler. SHEBA BABY with Pam Greer, Austin Stoker and D’Urville Martin (75) and THE ZEBRA KILLER (74), also with Stoker and Martin seem to be two different features. DAY OF THE ANIMALS is also available on video as SOMETHING IS OUT THERE, which could cause some confusion as to the total number of films by Girdler. - Richard Harland Smith (NYC) So a reader recognized Don Calfa on a court TV program. I believe he’s talking about PEOPLE’S COURT. I recognized these PSYCHOTRONIC regulars: Monique Gabrielle (being sued by an ex agent) - she won, director Donald Jackson (FROGTOWN) lost a slander suit, Tony Burton (ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13) was sued by an actress for failure to give her -proper billing in a local stage pay - he won, and poor Louisa Moritz sued a tenant for slander and was sued for non payment in another trial. She lost both. - Mike Shields (Hayward, CA) Dick Dale appeared on BEVERLY HILI^ 90210 recently. He was playing by the pool in Palm Springs and had to stop playing to warn Brandon Walsh and Steve Sanders that he’d get electrocuted if they didn’t stop splashing water everywhere. He toured Sydney recently to amazing reviews. Speaking of amazing. Buck Kartalian had a small but pivitol role as a tailor on a recent episode of FRIENDS. - David Tamsitt (Sydney, Australia) Kartalian starred in PLEASE DONT £47’ A/)' MOTHER! The Cramps also appeared on BEVERLY HILLS 90210 (Halloween show) last year. REVIEWS jerry Gross released THE CAGE as DON’T RING THE DOORBELL. - J. R. Taylor (NYC) THE CAGE, in addition to being entitled THE MAFU CAGE and MY SISTER, M LOVl- was also called DEVIATION. In fact, it played here in Fresno under that title. - Shawn Gadberry (Fresno, CA) Gadbery^ sent a cop}' of tl)e ad CEllefi Hies uith tiio iM animals. ONE OF THEM IS HER SISTER!'), a Jerry' Gross relecLse. Director Karen Arthur also made many TVmoiies and LADY BEWARE (87) starring Diane Lane. RE: Scopitones. I’ve heard that Quebec was the only part of North America that had those machines and one of our vintage clothing stores has one that’s still in rickety operation. Jody Miller’s “Queen Of The House’’ is simply breathtaking. You may already know this, but Mijanou Bardot in SFIX KITTENS... is Brigitte’s kid sister. A friend of mine is a Bardot freak and as an aspiring Quebecois disco star, she’s taken the stage name Mijanou in her honor. - Michael Will (Montreal) Mijanou also starred in French/Italian THE PIRATE Of THE BLACK HAWK (58). The uncut adult version of SEX KITTENS GO TO COLLEGE is available from Video Beat, 107 University Place n6H, NYC 10003. FORBIDDEN ADVENTURE is from 1934. It was directed by J. C. “Doc’’ Cook. The new footage was directed by George M. Merrick. Dwain Esper’s Roadshow Attractions had it in release in the 30s. FORBIDDEN ADVENTURE IN ANGKOR was it’s 1937 Ude. I saw STARK RAVING MAD on WHT in 1984. Their magazine lists it’s release date as 1976. - Harold Pfeffer (The Bronx) 77w/ means REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (36) copied parts of FORBIDDEN ADVENTURE (I had U backivards). As a full time horror/gore/sleaze enthusiast and a sometime contributor to genre publications, I just had to see Ivan Nagy’s SKINNER after reading your review. This SILENCE OF THE LAMBS imitator was everything you said it was, and just as nasty as one would expect from an ex- boyfriend of Heidi Fleiss. Nagy completists should check out his excellent and underrated 75 thriller DEADLY HERO which stars Don Murray as a psychotic New York cop. - Walter L. Gay (Valatie, NY) STARK RAVING MAD is available from Trend Video Concepts (Canada) as EXECUTION - Dion Ventress (Toronto) STARK RAVING MAD is a scene for scene rip-off/remake of Terence Malick’s BADIANDS. It was on video in Australia as EXECUTION then as MURDER RUN. Co-producer Don Gronquist also directed the awful horror cheapie UNHINGED. - Adam Kerrigan (Manly, NSW, Australia) I’ve never seen UNTAMED FURY (aka SWAMP VIRGIN), but I can safely say that the leading lady wasn’t played by Leigh Whipper. He was a Harvard educated black actor who was in the stage and screen versions of OF MICE AND MEN as well as movies like MISSION TO MOSCOW and THE OX-BOW INCIDENT. Much more importantly, he played the butler in KING OF THE ZOMBIES. Whipper wrote his own obit in 1970 and kept revising it until he finally died in 75. - Tom Weaver (North Tarrylown, NY) The actress in SWAMP VIRGIN was Mary' Conwell (I think). I was surprised to read that Kamal Horulu made a badly acted softcore film, SOME LIKE IT VIOLENT and that Barry Mahon served as executive P • S • Y • C • H T • R producer. Horulu later produced and directed hard core features which were generally well received (FEELINGS, WHEN SHE WAS BAD, WOMEN IN LOVT::, blue ECSTAQ'...). speaking of Barr\\' Mahon, 1 have always disliked M^’stery Science Theatre iOOO's treatment of his cold war era opus, ROCKET ATTACK U.S.A. I only hope that the upcoming MST3K movie is one tenth as entertaining as ROCKET ATTACK U.SA, minus the input of the MST3K people of course. - Lou Henken (Flushing, NY). Everi though MST3K on the SCI Fi Cljannel uill be all repeats from now on, Gramercy* Pictures is releasing MASTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000: THE MOVIE which is actually THIS ISLAND EARTH (55). We'll never know wlxit Exeter (Jeff Morrow - PV HI 6) thinks about this. THE ROAD KILLER was released to a very few theatres under the title ROADFLOWER. Also, the “director’s cut” of that that HIGHIANDER flick was actually the version that played theatrically in Canada. - Hal Kelly (Trash Compactor, Toronto) I’m glad I’m not the only person that kinda liked THE SECRET LIFE OF JEFFREY DAHMER. I remember, years ago, the movie was being featured on the MAURY POVICH show and every time a clip was shown, the audience groaned in a politically correct way. - Mike Shields (Hayward, CA) RE: ROLLER BLADE SEVEN (PV #20). Tayna York, the executive producer, threw the “C.C.C.” (Complete Creative Control) ball to Don (director Donald Jackson), who in turn pulled me on board. As Tanya spent a lot of money on name talent, Don and I where left with minimal operating capitol. Thus, 1 was left operating the sound and Don the camera, most of the time. Before a scene would start, I would get the tape up and running, then go slap the clapper in front of the camera, and then go and act with Frank Stallone, Karen Black, Don Stroud or Joe Estevez. You can imagine the effect our self composed crew had on the likes of especially Frank and Karen. • Scott Shaw (Rendondo Beach, CA) O.K, but if ym take a look at the filmographies of these actors (especially Stallone), / imagine they' ’ve experienced worse and everi cheaper conditions on sets. Shaw claims to have starred or co-starred in 16 features (including seieral in Asia) . RE: Manuel Cano’s “illegal\" Tarzan movie TARZAN’S GREATEST CHALLENGE (PV #I6), yes, there are more Cano Tarzans with Steve Hawkes. TARZAN Y EL ARCO IRIS (72) and supposedly, LA FURIA DE TARZAN (if it exists, it never made it to Spain). There was a brief Tarzan rip-off craze in Spain and Italy. TARZAN EN LAS MINAS DEL REY S/M.OMON starred David Carpenter as the ape man, the at the time sex symbol in Spain, Nadiuska, a lot of safari park footage and Paul Naschy. In this movie, directed by Jose Luis Merino, you can actually hear the Johhny Weissmuller yell. Amazing. -Josu Oland (Vizcaya, Spain) STICK IT IN YOUR EAR was filmed in Boston and TOBE HOOPERS NIGHT TERRORS was made in Israel. MAD AT THE WORLD is from Fang (not Sinister). FREAKSHOW is from Arrow Video, IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is from New Line Video and HIDEWAY is from Columbia. T))e version of SWEET GEORGIA revieu^ed here was a cut version. Something Weird's release is 20 minutes longer. Yes, THE TOUCH OF HER FLESH reineiv was a repeat and it should have said SALOME for the early Clive Barker title. It was featured on the Barker segment of A^E's BIOGRAPH)' (they' also did new hour shows on Lon Chaney' Jr., Karloff, Lugosi, H. G. Welles and Jules Verne, to name just a fell). Tl)e uncut ''adult\" version of JACK THE RIPPER is available on tape in France. It includes topless scenes of chorus girls backstage. Some indy titles reinetved here recently (NIGHT OWL, VAMPIRES AND OTHER STEROJl'PES, DARKNESS, DEAD MEAT), titles by f R. Bookwalter and Todd Slmts and some in this issue are available from E. I. Film And Video Dist. Call (201) 893-8192. And by the way, AMOROUS SEX is an adult version (set eral tame strip scenes added) of the British SWEET BEAT (PV H8). You still get the same great 50s singers and groups. THE GIRL AND THE GEEK is tlje adults only PASSION IN THE SUN (PV HI 4) from Texas, uith a better title. Both are from Something Weird. WONDERGUY (PV HI9) should be available from Raven International Video soon. OBITS Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart played themselves in an episode of BEWITCHED, as well as in an 1 DREAM OF JEANNIE. Elizabeth Montgomery’s episode of the TWILIGHT ZONE was the classic “Two.” She and Charles Bronson play survivors of an apocalyptic war. Montgomerey has only one line of dialogue, but she was very effective in this superb speculative drama. (You) also credit her with an episode of the OUTER LIMITS, but 1 believe this is erroneous. - Timothy Walters (Muskogee, OK) One of Heinz Ruhmann’s last perfomiances was in Wim Wender’s FAR AWAY, SO CLOSE (93). One of Vivian Stanshall’s last recordings was on the British compilation The Last Temptation Of Elvis. Viv sang “Teddy Bear.” Peter Cook and Eleanor Bron (both in BEDAZZLED) were bfiefly reunited in the 1994 BIACK BEAUTY. - Marc Edward Heuck (Columbus, Ohio) Ida Lupino also starred in an interesting B flick, JENNIFER (53), a quasi-supematural gothic thriller. - Michael Will (Montreal) Big John Studd (who passed away last year) was listed as 6’ 11” and 450 lbs., from Los Angeles. His real name was John Minton. A “bad guy” in the ring, outside, he was a real gentleman. RE: the late director Cy Endfield. The listed producer of MR. HEX (46) is Jan Grippo. Mr. Endfield wrote the screenplay. He also wrote HARD BOILED MAHONEY (47). - Harold Pfeflfer (The Bronx) Burl Ives narrated RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDER, not FROSTY. He also provided voice work for THE DAYDREAMER (66) and acted in Zalman King’s TWO MOON JUNCTION (88). I was shocked to see Bruno Lawrence’s name among the obits. He was a solid supporting actor who could also do a lean mean. He also appeared in the maniac in the wood feature BRIDGE TO NOWHERE (86) and RACE TO THE YANKEE ZEPHYR with the late Donald Pleasence - Richard Harland Smith (NYC) Launrefice was also in (the excellefit) JACK BE NIMBLE (92). Thanks for another great issue. As an old Castle Of Frankenstein reader. Scott Shaw 6 P • S • Y • C • H T • R N • 1 • C I really appreciate your keeping the tradition going with the obituaries. - Dr. C. P. Negri (Morgantown. W>') / was an avid C.O.F. reader myself, but / think i/)e obits in Famous Monsters were better and more frequent. Wolfman Jack was also in DEADMAN'S CURVE (78), MORE AMERICAN GRAFtm (79), MOTEL HELL (80), MIDNIGHT HOUR (85), MIDNIGHT (88) and MORTUARY ACADEMY (88). Mexican station XERF was featured in BENEATH THE VALLE)^ OF THE ULTRA VIXENS (Kitten Natividad played a DJ). Severn Darden was also in VANISHING POINT (71). Alexander Godunov was also knotni (in Canada) for his LaBatt 's Beer TV ads. John Cameron Swayze was also in WHEN NATURE CALLS (82). OTHER INTERVIEWS my own interview with him has been languishing for years at Filmfax magazine. - Dennis Fischer (Paramount. CA) William Rotsler (PV #18) discusses many of his women, but never mentioned Maria Arnold. She was one of the stars of THE GODSON and was in Ed Wood’s final oddball film NECROMANIA. It appears Maria was overshadov^ed by Rene Bond, Sandy Dempsey or Uschi Digart. What ever became of Maria Arnold? - Frank Sciulii (Pittsburgh) She's alive and well and Rudolph (Nightmare Of Ecstacy) Grey will probably be intervieivmg her in PV soon! Leo Fong (PV it 19) is working on KILLPOINT 2, to star Tadashi Yamashita, Stack Pierce (KILL POINT, LOW BLOW...) and himself Last issues' photo of Arnold Vosloo and Gordon K. Smith was taken by David Decouteau (not the director) of Ft. Lauderdale.

Incredibly, New Line has just released it as an “uncensored\" video (also in a collectors letterboxed edition) plus tlie tliree sequels. All are now available (as low as $9-98 each) or as a box set. Quentin Tarentino was involved with making this happen and he’s also behind Miramax picking up Jack Hill’s incredible SWITCHBLADE SISTERS for a theatrical and video release! Watch for more QT backed cult releases in tlie future. And Bunuel’s BEU.EDEjOUR (67) is on tape from Miramax after the Scorsese backed theatrical re-release. Since Mirimax is owned by Disney, I can’t help but wonder how much Uncle Walt enjoyed the movies of jack Hill and Luis Bunuel! We also reviewed the no longer rare SHAFT IN AFRICA, now available (along with the first two SHAFT movies) from MGM/UA. It took the success of Peter Jackson’s HEAVENLY CREATURES to finally prompt the video release of his MEET THE FEEBLES (covered in PV#15). It’s from MTI Video. Don’t miss it! KINO has released Robert Wiene’s THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (19) with Emil Jannings and F. W. Murnau’s FAUST (26) starring Conrad Veidt.

PHIBES movies and SCREAM AND SCREAM AGAIN by Gordon Hessler. HOME VISION CINEMA has released 8 Paramount studio BULLDOG DRUMMOND movies from the 30s (running around an hour each) in 4 volumes.

LUMIVISION: HEATHERS and HELLRAISER. The most exciting new laser release (from IMAGE) is Jack Hill’s SPIDER BABY!, finally becoming the well known cult movie it deserves to be.

Lorre and Karloff and MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH, COUP DE TORCHON (82), Bertrand Tavernier’s adaptation of Jim Thompson’s nov-el Pop. 1280, the John Barrymore DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (tinted, with the shooting script) and Disney’s ahead of it’s time TRON (a widescreen special edition). MUSIC MPI has new expanded versions of the Beatles HARD DAYS NIGHT and HELP and since the Fab Four are at the top of the charts again, expect more Beatle related video releases (A+E’s recent Beatle segment was the worst). RHINO has rereleased Eric Idle’s hillarious (pre SPINAL TAP) 1978 fake documentary THE RUTTLES - ALL YOU NEED IS CASH in a 70 min. verion. And look for Tom Rainone’s amazing new Motorhead “Sacrifice” video (its been banned in several areas but has been on BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD). We missed Motorhead in NYC (show snowed out!) but this relentless video. Gloria Talbott and THE LEECH WOMAN filled with reel and real historical horror almost makes up for it. Tom also made memorable videos for the Revolting Cocks and the Ramones. CATALOGS Contact our advertisers (see ads) when looking for tapes.

Freuler Two couples go to a remote house where a scientist working on free (solar) power is killed. People constantly sneak around and peer in windows and Kenneth Strickfadden mad lab electronics are seen. Micha Auer (creepy servant) and Martha Mattox (his creepy old lady maid mom) repeat their roles from THE MONSTER WALKS (PV #21) and there’s a comic drunk and a black cab driver they call “Uncle.” Josephine Dunn (who retired after this) stars with jack Mulhall (who went on to Monogram movies). The cheap looking just over an hour long indy from the Big Four company makes little sense. The rare print jumps in spots. Thorpe (who was responsible for 10 other features released in 32) later directed 4 Tarzan movies and JAILHOUSE ROCK! THE INTRUDER (Sinister, 32) D Albert Ray, S Francis Hyland, P M. H. HofiEman Survivors of a cruise ship wreck arrive on a tropical island and a murder investigation continues there. The cast includes Lila Lee (from THE UNHOLY THREE), Monte Blue (later the villain in THE UNDERSEA KINGDOM), a drunk (Arthur Houseman) and a blonde (Gwen Lee). A crazed, bearded man (Mischa Auer again!) who lives in a cave with a skeleton he calls Mary, kidnaps the women and there’s a briefly seen gorilla. This Allied Pictures release runs 66 mins. The same three creators also made THE THIRTEENTH GUEST (32) and A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (33). both better known today because they star Ginger Rogers. NYC VAMPIRES NADJA (October, 94) D/S Michael Almereyda, P Mary Sweeney, Amy Hobby Elina Lowensohn (AMATEUR) is a haunted looking vampire in NYC and Peter Fonda is a long haired Van Helsing. It’s b/w, has Pixlevision segments, some great images, some intentional laughs, flashbacks and parts takes place in Transylvania. Fonda makes a very cool vampire hunter. With Suzy Amis (also in the directors TWISTER with Crispin Glover), Galaxy Craze as Lucy, Martin Donovan as her husband, Karl Gear>^ as Renfield, Jared Harris as the twin brother vampire, executive producer David Lynch as a morgue guard and Lugosi (WHITE ZOMBIE clip). Some music is by My Bloody Valentine. NADJA is slow moving but often fascinating and is much better than Abel Ferarre’s irritating, over serious recent b/w NYC vampire movie (THE ADDICTION). ADDICTED TO MURDER (Brimstone, 95) P/D/S/edit/cin Kevin Lindenmuth, S Tom Piccirilli A series of TV interviews and flashbacks (some b/w) to various time periods show how Joel (Mick McCleery) became a young serial killer known as “the New York Mangier.” It seems like Rachel (Laura McLaughlin), a vampire, got him addicted to killing in his home town and another vampire (Sasha Graham) makes sure he keeps killing in New York. It’s a very serious movie with good location work, many impressive images and interesting FX, but the part where Rachel has Joel kill her over and over (once with a chainsaw!) is pretty hilarious. My main question is what do all the many good looking female characters in this movie see in the sullen, gloomy, dumpy and divorced Joel. By the maker of VAMPIRES AND OTHER STEREOTYPES (PV #20). Available through E. 1. (see letters) or write the director at 3 W. 102 #4B, NYC 10025. YARBROUGH THE CREEPER (King Bee, 48) D Jean Yarbrough, S Maurice Tombragel, P Bernard Small, Ben Pivar Horror movies were completely out of fashion in post war 1948, but 20th Century released this one, running only 64 mins. Nora (Janis Wilson) who sleepwalks, is afraid of cats, has jungle flashbacks and nightmares inside of flashbacks is arrested for the claw murder of her scientist father (Ralph Morgan). A love triangle is also going on around the lab. A likely suspect, Dr. Van Clock (Eduardo Cianelli) sneers and lurks around but another scientist (Onslow Stevens) is the killer (sorry!) who has a cat paw transformation scene. With June Vincent, John Baragrey and Philip Ahn. Yarborough had just done two Rondo Hatton movies. HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE (Shocktoons, 67) D Jean Yarbrough, S Duke Yelton, P Bernard Woolner Ferlin Husky (also in LAS VEGAS HILLBILLYS) stars in this much hated color musical comedy with Joi Lansing ( manager) and Don Bowman (nervous comedy relieO- They become trapped in an old haunted mansion where Basil Rathbone and John Carradine (wearing suits) provide horror cliches in it P • S • Y • C • H T • R the biLsenieiil.

Large chested, platinum blonde Lansing (tlien a semi regular on TUE BBTRLY HlLLBIllIES) has a bizarre dreiuii sequence and also sings (terribly). Also with Richard Webb as a go\\'emment agent, (George Barrows (gorilla), Pat Patterson and a Civil War general ghost. Write to 30 Tobyhanna Trail, Hopalconc, NJ 07843. GERMANY NAUGHTY CHEERLEADERS (SW, 69) D/S Will Tremper, P Horst Wendlandt (HOW DID A NICE GIRL...) 19 year old Barbi Benton (Klein) stare in and narrates her first movie as Lynn, an underage Catholic cheerleader in Scranton who has brainless G^DY-like adventures. She has sex (offscreen) with Lionel Slander (!) on a bus for money, blackmails the host of an American Bandstand type show in Boston, poses as Miss Luxemburg in Miami and ends up in Monte Carlo with Klaus Kinski (!) w'lio has a major role. The cast includes Clyde Ventura, Broderick Crawford and Jeff Cooper and Hugli Hefner even shows up (no lines). Although mostly set in America, its filled with Euro characters (and actors). Independent International released tliis here in 72. The video is from a well worn print. UNNATURAL (Sinister, 52) D Arthur Maria Rabenalt, S Fritz Rotter (ALRAUNE) After an intro about the powers of the Mandrake Root, the secret daughter (Hildegard KneO of a professor (Erich Von Stroheim) escapes from a monastery. An in debt nephew (Karlheinz Bohm, later in PEEPING TOM) first meets her in a basement by a gorilla in a cage. It turns out she’s the soulless result of artificial insemination, the daughter of a hooker and a murderer who was hanged. She leads on several lovesick men, frames people and causes deaths. Stroheim says \"Good people are so uninteresting.” IX]A released it in America in ‘57, llie year Von Stroheim died in Paris. Its dubbed into English but she sings in (jemian and some dialog is in French. The story (based on a novel) had been filmed 5 times including a silent Hungarian version by Michael Curtiz and a sound version by Richard Oswald. Parts of the print are badly burned. RECENT NOSTRADAMUS (Orion, 94) D Roger Christian, S Knut Boeser, Piers Ashworth, P Edward Simons, Harold Reichebner l6th Century scholar and prophet Michel de Nostradame (Tchekw Karyo from \\A FEMME NIKITA) barely lives through the Inquisition (he’s a secret Jew) and the plague (his family dies) and is accused of causing tlie deatli of the King of France. No wonder he had visions (including Hitler, JFK and Tlie Gulf war). It all ends with hope for mankind through space exploration. With Julie Onnond as his brilliant wife, Assumpta Serna (MATADOR), F. Murray Abraham as a wejilthy astrologer, Amanda Plummer as the helpful P • S • Y • C HILLBim^lNA HAVNTED HOUSE Queen, Rutger Hauer as a crazed monk and Michael Gough. Filmed in Romania, France and England. Big time art director Christian also made the underrated THE SENDER (82) and STARSHIP (85) NIGHT OF THE SCARECROW (Rep., 95) D Jeff Burr, S Reed Steiner, Dan Mazur, P Barry Bernard! ,Membere of a family that runs a small famiing town (tlianks to a spell) are offed by a living scarecrow (Howard Swain). Most deaths are caused by roots that w'liip around (like in THE THING remake), puncture bodies and drag victims underground. Elizabeth Barondes (from the recent NOT OF THIS EARTH remake) stare as tlie mayors rebellious daughter and John Mese is her new' boyfriend. Bruce Glover is a preacher (married to Marline Beswicke) w ho cries over an underwear catalog and has his mouth sewn up. A b/w orgy flashback (complete with naked old people) features John (BEYOND IHE VAI.LF:\\' of the D0U.S) I.azar as a warlock. Also with John Hawkes (the star of SCARY MOVIE), Dirk Blocker and Gary' Ixickw'ood. Tom Rainone added some digital FX. MUTANT SPECIES (Live, 9S) P/D/S David A. Prior, William S. Vigil Ted Prior is a soldier who battles a (not bad looking) tall, decapitating replile/dog like (man in a suit) monster in some Texas woods witli some help from a local (Denise Crosby) and her teen brother. Using an idea borrowed from THE FIRST MAN INTO OUTER SPACE (59), the monster (who decapitates soldiers but also cries) used to be a NASA astronaut (briefly seen Ijeo Rossi). Ted asks him ‘‘Have you looked into the fucking mirror lately?!” It was filmed around Mobile, Alabama, uses cliche monster POV scenes and includes the name value Wilford Brimley and Powers Boothe as the good and bad government representatives. Ted also starred in his brother David’s FUTURE ZONE (PV #13). RAW NERVE (PV #11) and others I’m sure you’ll want to spend your hard earned cash on. DANGEROUS PREY (Monarch, 95) D Lloyd A. Simandl, S Christine Hyde, P Michael Mazo After a sex scene. Shannon Whirrey lakes the rap for her smuggler boyfriend (she thought he was a poet!) and ends up in an Eastern Euro jail where women are drugged and trained as killers (shades of L\\ FEMME NIKITA). This movie has lots of cat fights, gun battles and chases and Whirrey has a stand out shower scene followed by a nude walk. Shannon’s best line is \"Who pissed in your Com Flakes?” Tanya (Clara Hunter, Miss Canada of 88) with short blonde hair works for the bad guys for a while then is hung up and tortured. Dr. Drexel (Joseph Uufer) is the talkative, homy mad doctor with a lesbian assistant (Beatrice DeBorg). A dmg induced flashback shows us the whole damn movie again in fast clips. The Canadian production was filmed in the Czech Republic and the music is by Peter Allen. CYTOR BANDITS (CoL, 94) D Eric Fleming, S James Robinson, Winston Beard, P Paul Colichman, Lilli Rouleau Except for some interesting cast members, this is a cliche adventure with some token virtual nonsense and hologram strippers thrown in that should have been rated PG 15. In the future, a hired private ship captain (Martin Kemp) falls for tlie woman (BAWATCH star Alexandra Paul) of the wealtliy villain (Robert Hays) and they go on tlie mn on a Chinese island. Hay's wants her and his valuable disc back. With Adam Ant, Grace Jones looking good as ihe niece of tattoo artist James Hong (!), Heniy Gibson and Catherine Dao (FEMME FONTAINE). The score of the I.R.S. production is by Steve Hunter. GALAXIS (Turner, 95) D William Mesa, S Nick Davis, P Nile Niami, Patrick Choi , , , , u u Brigitte Nielsen is a good TERMINATOR type alien in black leather who leaves her desolate planet for LA to stop an evil warrior (Richard Moll from obtaining a crystal in the possession of a explorer Oohn H. Brenan). Niel*n and Moll just have to look large and imposing. Brenan is the real star Meanwhile various gangsteis are after the frightened hero and the crystal too. With Roger Allen Brown and Cindy Morgan as cops, Louisa Montz as a hooker, Craig Fairbrass and Sam Raimi. U has intentional comedy morphing FX and a briefly seen killer robot but 1 have no idea why it s rated R.TheFXarebyKNB. How far should a Teacher go to protect her students? 70s THE TEACHER (Vid America, 74) P/D/S Hikmct Avedis The best friend of teenage Sean (DENNIS THE MENACE TV star Jay North!) dies and he receives death threats, but remains wide eyed and happy. Every women seems to want him but he s seduced by his friendly, sexy neighbor school teacher (Angel Tompkins who has topless and shower scenes). Meanwhile, Ralph (the always creepy Anthony JamesX a lovesick, Nam vet voyeur killer stalks her in his hearse. With Marlene Schmidt (the associate producer) as Sean’s mom, Barry Atwater and Sivi Aberg from DR. DEATH. The music is funky and characters wear bell bottoms or bikinis. Avedis made several R drive-in features for Crown International, most with young guys with older women. TRIP WITH THE TEACHER (74) P/D/S Earl Barton Two psycho biker brothers (Zalman King and Robert Porter) discover a small group of female students and their teacher (Brenda Foggrty) in a broken down bus in the desert, then terrorize them at an abandoned shack. King’s acting is totally out of control as he rants, snickers, kills, whips and rapes. The females are pretty slow about the escape possibilities and a nice guy who had been with the brothers eventually arrives for a (violent) rescue. King, now a producer shared his thoughts on this role in PV # 13. The drive-in movie is from Crown International. MEDUSA (U.S., 73) D Gordon Hessler, S Christopher Wicking, P/ star George Hamilton UK/Greece (THE RHODES INCIDENT) This is filled with Greek dancing ^d music and two out of control American actois with nobody to tell them when to stop. George Hamilton, a drunken heir in Greece, narrates flashback (after his death). A blonde stewardess is murdered by a masked nm who leaves writing in blood. Ukely suspect Hamilton acts crazy, does wird voices and in one scene dresses like the 70s Elvis. He also has a thing for his own sister (Lucianna Paluzzi) and kidnaps a little girl. Meanwhile, C^eron Mitchell is Angelo, a gangster who laughs a lot, beats people and ki y putting a water hose in a victim’s mouth. Hamilton also produced his more successful EVEL KNIEVTiL (71) and LOVE AT FIRST BITE (79)- DONALD FARMER RED LIPS (95) D/S/act Donald Farmer, P Christopher M. Sy*Chasun (the tall, imposing, body pierced star of GOROTICA) is Caroline, a blood donor who tests a drug for money and beromes a v^pire. In NYC (some scenes were actually shot there), Michelle Bauer (I she retired) becomes her faithful lover who disposes of body parts. The selling point is seNeral lesbian sex scenes, but both leads actually give more (acting^se and unashamed total nudity) than this movie deserves. The sight of a naked, sobbing Kitten Natividad is hard to forget, but you 11 probably tiy. Also with Danny Fendley (COMPELLING EVIDENCE) ^ a pimp and George Stover escaping from some hookers. It’s $29 95 from Video Void, 23915 W. Chicago, Bedford, Ml 48239- COMPELLING EVIDENCE (95) D/S/act Donald Farmer, P Juan biggest action hero\" Rick Stone (Danny Fendley) is bM for the murder of his wife (name value Brigitte Nielsen). Stone evenm^ly up with a TV tabloid reporter (Dana Plato) and they tiy to find the M er. — xhis attempt at a more mainstream erotic thriller (with an obvious 0. J. inspiration) has endless name dropping, too much talk and one of the most absurd endings in memory. The selling point is the form« DIFF’RENT STROKES star (“I can’t believe I’m in bed with America’s most wanted man!”) in two surprisingly graphic fuck scenes. The pre-credit scene from ’’LETHAL ASSAULT” was the best part. With Melissa Ann Moore as Stone’s mistress (in a toples scene) and 70s cult star Lynn Lowry as his agent. It’s set in Beverly Hills but the Atlanta locations and accents cause a few problems. 23 Big Spring Circle, Cookville, '171,38501. STEVE LATSHAW JACKO (Triboro, 95) P/D Steve Latshaw, P/S Patrick Moran A suburban kid (Ryan Latshaw) has nightmares and visions of the past and is eventually buried alive. His parents create a Halloween haunted garage and a legendary pumpkin head scarecrow with a scythe is resurrected by some teens. Top billed Lianna Quigley ' is a baby sitter featured in a very gratuitous shower scene. The monster is pretty scary looking, blood spurts when it decapitates victims, there’s a Rush Limbaugh imitator and Rachel Carter has a topless LPiciu«s«n[»sf_w^ scene. The late Cameron Mitchell (as a TV borrm host) and John Carradine (as a warlock who was lynched) ^ clwriy^t^ into the new footage. The mom is played by Rebecca Wicks ^ka Cathy Moran, a Latshaw regular). Fred Olen Ray was the exec producer and provided the story and the older scenes (Brinke SteveiK and Dawn ^ show up). Utshaw has been making movies m Florida since VAMPIRE TRAI1£R PARK (PV #12). BIOHAZARD THE ALIEN FORCE (Vidmark, 94) D/S Steve Latshaw, P/S/act Patrick Moran A female (man in a suit by John Carl Beuchler) monster in the Miami area wants to mate and is killing off people who were tissue donors to the proieri that created it. Mike, a former security guard (big Steve Zujk), a photographer (Susan Fronsoe who has a topless scenes) and Lyrtch (Moran) try to figure it all out while cops, hitmen and too many other characters run W Mfc -So. If, « » fKk “ ““'k f “T 'iT, has a stand out nude sex scene (and a nightmare). With Christopher Mitchum (he’s behind it all), Catherine Walsh as a bad doctor, Ryan P . S . f • C • H • 0 • T • R I Latshaw, Rebecca Wickes and director William Grefe as a dmnk. Fred Olen Ray and Jim Wynorski were executive producers. MORE CYBORGS COMPANION (MCA, 94) D Gary Fleder, S Ian Seeberg, P Richard Brams A best selling romance novelist (Kathryn Harrold) with a cheating husband is convinced to special order a lifelike robot named Jeffrey (Bruce Greenwood, recently on the NOWHERE MAN series). Jeffrey eventually becomes a perfect attentive and caring lover at her remote summer house, but she programs him a bit too much and he starts killing anyone who tries to get near her. The two stars are excellent in their roles and James Karen (as a cheery cyborg salesman) and Brion James (as an asshole sculpture who uses laser guns) are both memorable. Also with Talia Balsham, Joely Fisher and Tracy Walters. Rated R but it should be PG-13. SUSPECT DEVICE (Cosmic, 95) D Rick Jacobson, S Alex Simon, P Mike Elliot After a number of (intentionally) confusing slo mo scenes of slaughter by gunfire, explosions and sex with his large breasted blonde wife, justifiably paranoid office worker C. Thomas Howell discovers that he’s actually an indestructible cyborg bomb with false memories. Stacy Travis is the scientist he goes on the run with who says “It just doesn’t make any sense\" and eventually helps him in punch out fights before the explosive ending at Yucca Flats. With Jonathon Fuller (CASTLE FREAK), interesting as a long haired hippie scientist, John Beck (lead bad guy) and Jed Allen. It’s part of the “Roger Corman Presents” Showtime series which includes HAUNTED SYMPHONY (PV #21) and remakes of NOT OF THIS EARTH, THE WASP WOMAN and PIRANHA ALIEN SHAPE SHIFTERS AMANDA AND ’HIE ALIEN (Rep., 95) D/S Jon Kroll, P Larry Estes In this amusing mixture of THE HIDDEN and STARMAN, an alien that looks like a mutant inner tube takes over various bodies (morphing FX). Nicole Eggert, a (very short) nonconformist who hangs out at a retro beamik club, teaches and advises the confused female alien (Alex Meneses), then convinces her to take over the body of her cheating boyfriend (Michael Benoetti). They fall in love, then go on the nrn to Bakersfield from government agents. The alien lover later becomes Michael Dom (LL Woif minus the Klingon make-up), then Stacy Keach! Meneses (from BAYWATCH) has a sex scene and a \"how to\" shower scene. With John Diehl and Jessica Hahn as a TV hostess. The music for this I.R.S. production is by Jane Wiedlin from the Go Gos. DEAD WEEKEND (Par. 95) D Amos Poe, S Joel Rose, P Larry Estes Dopey looking Stephen Baldwin stars as Weed, a tattooed near future corporate stud cop who falls for a shape shifter he’s supposed to kill while 70s look punks battle in the streets. The alien becomes (this movie is too cheap for even minimal FX) various women of various races and hair colors. This cheap looking tape (produced by 1. R. S.) could have been scary, funny, sexy, exciting or all of the above but Poe doesn’t have a clue and even the frequent sex scenes are totally botched. Bai Ling is the only actress playing p • S • Y • C • H the alien who doesn't have nude scenes and David Rasche is the cop partner who says “You’re banging the alien!\" With Tom Kenny (irritating as a dmnken DJ) and Alexis Arquette. The only actor who is good here is Nicholas Worth as the leader broadcasting false earthquake scares. Poe also made BLANK GENERATION (76) and ALPHABET Cm’ (84) back in NYC. RECENT FEMME FONTAINE: KILLER BABE FOR THE CIA (Troma. 95) P/D/S/ star Margot Hope Drew Fontaine (Hope, who seems to be part Asian) goes undercover in a blonde wig to infiltrate an American teen Nazi group led by a blonde lisa type, who plans to sell a flesh eating spray to some Arabs. Meanwhile some fake pom producers (posters for GLEN OR GLENDA and BUMMER! are on the wall) work for a dragon lady (Catherine Dao) who eventually helps Fontaine. James Hong is a bald wise man who dies early. I’m not sure if 1 buy the credits but if Hope really did it all, she should be very proud because this is a fun and often funny on purpose 70s type exploitation movie with female leads. With some topless scenes (not the stats) and a bloody murder but it could almost get a PG-13. Gary Graver was the cinematographer. VOODOO (A-Pix, 95) D Rene Efraim, S Brian Dimuccio, Dino Vindeni, P Donald P. Borchers Corey Feldman stats as a nice guy medical college student who ends up in a fraternity of outcasts mn by a satanist (Joel Franklin) who turns his followers into zombies and kills rival college jocks. Corey is drugged, tattooed, has nightmares and is forced to steal (then wakes next to) a female corpse but fights back with advice from Jack Nance (reunited with him from MEATBALLS 4!) as a lurking Van Heking type. With Diana Nadeau is the ex girlfriend (bound and gagged in one scene) and Sarah Douglas as an evil professor. Pierre David was executive producer. SLEEPSTALKER (Prism, 95) D/S Turi Meyer, S A1 Steptien, P Luigi Ginolini 17 years after Griffin Oay Underwood, who used to star in kid movies) survived the slaughter of his family, he's a writer in L.A. plagued by nightmares and people around him die. The killer, known as The Sandman (Michael Harris from SUTURE) recites nursery rhymes and can turn into sand. He was reborn after dying in the gas chamber thanks to a mysterious black preacher with blank eyebalk. This slow going horror movie has some interesting but minimal FX. With Kathryn Morris, William Lucking, Marc McClure and Ken Force. DARKEST SOUL (94) P/D/ star Al Drago, D Doug Ulrich Two losers, both fired from a series of menial jobs, become grave diggers and start stealing bodies for money. Tommy (Drago) who wears all black, gets a new girlfriend but still pays for hookers and apparently becomes an (offecreen) necropheliac. Mark (Jeff Witte), his big faithful friend becomes a junkie. The made in Baltimore indy is completely serious and downbeat to the end. With a bAv flashback, hallucinations and a soundtrack of original songs. Available from E. I. (see Letters). BLONDE FURY (Garage Rock, 94) P/D/act Lee Bennett Sobel, S Lori Bonfitto Two New Jersey housewives (the opening copies a scene from MARRIED TO FEMME FONTAINE KILLER BABE FOR THE C.U THK MOB) tliink their hiisbaiids (who are actually with some huge whores) have been kidnapped. They end up in bed together in a motel and eventually shoot the husbands. They also pick up a lesbian ex con (imitating Rosie O’Donnell) and kill a lady crook with a hook hand. Margaret Lancaster stare in the cartoonish comedy witli Virginia Vanover as her short, thick headed Devil Dog addict best friend. 48 mins. Hi-8 video. $19 95 ppd to 123 W. 93 St. #2C,N^'C 10025. MATERNAL OVERKILL MOMMY (Eagle, 94) P/D/S Max Allan Collins Little Jessica Ann (Rachel Lemiex, wlio narrates) tries hard to figure out if and why her twice widowed mom (Patty McCormack) is killing people. McComiack (who starred in THE BAD SEED as a child) is prett\\^ frightening as the steely, over protective psycho (her character is like a serious version of Kathleen Turner in SERIAL MOM) who frequently says “Wliose your best friend?” With Michael Corvelson as Mommy’s new younger bo)friend, Brinke Stevens as the nice helpful aunt, Jason Miller as a detective (witli no socks), Mickey Spillane (who hasn’t been in a movies since THE GIRL HUNTERS) as a lawyer and Majel Barrett (an early \\ictim). I just wish tlie music wasn’t so boring. The self financed indy feature was filmed in Muscatine, Iowa. Collins has written novels based on movies, scripts (THE FJCPERT) and comics (DICKTRAG’). MOTHER (Triboro, 94) D Frank LaLoggia, S Michael Angelella, P Patrick Peach Young Tom (Morgan Weisser) creates greeting cards for his deranged shop owner mother (Diane Ladd, a co-producer) in Rochester, NY (a Holluvood set) near oil refineries. She sabotages his scholarship and his new relationship (with Ele Keats from LIPSTICK CAMERA) with encouragement from her cynical overbearing best friend (Olvinpia Dukakis in a wig). Characters die by axe, knife and tliat old standby, a radio in a bathtub. Matt Clark and Scott Wilson play other interesting characters. Good acting, interesting art>' cinematography and se\\eral surprises help make this above average. Not to be confused witli MOM or MOMM\\’, it’s by far the best and most focused movie by tlie director of FEAR NO EVIL (81) and L\\DY IN WHITE (88). CANADIAN RARITIES DECOY FOR TERROR (Sinister, 65) D/S Erick Santamaran, P Max A. Sendel (PLAYGIRL KlUilR) Darlene, alone in her family mansion, hires drifter Bill (William Kerwin) as a live in handyman. Bill’s a psycho artist (“Don’t Move!) who kills models and attempts to recreate a surreal scene from his recurring nightmares. Witli Darlene out of the way, more models (including a French singing lounge star) pose and end up in the freezer. Florida exploitation great Kerwin (who wrote the story with brother Harry) went North to star in tliis essential Eastmancolor wonder. It features sexy women in bikinis and see through lingerie, a nude swim, some bondage, strobe light flashbacks, Montreal’s movie theatre district, the then hitless Neal Sedaka doing “Tlie Waterbug’’ and J. B. And The Playboys (an excellent beat group) doing “If You Don't Want To” at the pool part)' (one of the best rock clips from the era). Ijead singer Allan Nicholls later starred in HAIR and JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR on Broadway, acted in many Altman movies and directed a Leonard Cohen T\\^ special! IW LEAGUE KILLERS (Sinister, 59) P/D William Davidson, P/S Norman Klenman (THE FAST ONES) Don (Don Boresenko) leads the all black leather Black Diamonds bikers and falls for a rich blonde (Barbara Bricken). He’s framed for a lakefront dance hall killing by an older golf playing, sports car riding jerk (Don Francis) with two devout followers and she’s kidnapped. The rebels (who resemble characters in BEAT GIRL) are persecuted good guys and the jock is a psycho. Pretty cool - eh? A guy named Igors Cavov sings a rock song (“Get Hip, Love Me”) in a “juke joint ” and the folk standard “Easy Rider ” on a Lake Ontario beach. Davidson later produced the STARLOST TV series. Boresenko also starred in THE lAST GUNFIGHTER (59), a Canadian western. DUDIKOFF VIRTUAL ASSASSIN (Prism, 95) D Robert Lee, S Eric Poppen, P John A. Curtis (CYBERJACK) Nick (Michael Dudikoff, who has gotten a lot better since his AMERICAN NINJA series days) is a traumatized former cop working as as janitor. He becomes the confused hero at a research center when a madman (Brion James) who plots to be ruler of the universe and his terrorists take and kill hostages. James, with poofed up blonde hair and a goatee is described as “a lab rat on steroids’’ and says things like “Nick?, I used to fuck a guy in prison named Nick!’’ His main (kung fu) fighter is a black woman (Topaz Hasfal-Schou) in a metal bra. Nick tries to save a doctor (Suki Kaiser) and meanwhile scar)' (animated) robots sent in by the cops assume he’s the killer. The fun DIE HARD style sci fi movie with BIADE RUNNER trappings (and a hologram stripper) benefits from the robots and an over the top James. It’s a Turner production and was filmed in Vancouver. MIDNIGHT RIDE (Cannon, 90) D/S Bob Bralver, S Russell V. Manzatt, P Olividio G. Assonids In this crazed, convoluted, action packed movie (shelved for over 5 years), Mark Hamill gives his all as a relentless, very psychotic, Polaroid taking, eyeball obsessed killer hitchhiker who is picked up by a Russian woman (Savina Gereak) who is fleeing from her cop husband (DudikofO. Many people die and many vehicles explode on the misty California coastline as the three main characters incredibly continue to separate then meet up again. Hamill ties Dudikoff to the hood of a speeding Taxi and kills a very fat woman then sucks on her glass eye. Name value Robert Mitchum shows up as a shrink, but most of his scenes were obviously shot alone at a different time. Bralver also made RUSH WEEK (PV #9) JUid AssonitLs also produced the amazing SONNY BOY (PV #10), also with Gereak. FRED OLEN RAY CYBERZONE (Cosmic/New Horizons, 95) P/D/acf Fred Olen Ray, S William C. Martell Here we have a typical Ray movie this time released by Roger Gorman. Mark Singer is a futuristic bounty hunter after droids (he carries a head in his bag) who is teamed with the proper looking Beth (Rochele Swanson), wbo soon is posing as a hooker, in an effort to retrieve 4 \"pleasure droids’’ in negligees that were kidnapped by big long haired Mattias Hues. There’s one major sex scene featuring unknowns and Brinke Stevens is pretty hot as an alien cat woman stripper seen at work several times. With a gun battle in a factory and borrowed space ship footage. Ray regulars including Robert Quarry, Ross Hagen, Peter Spellos, Hoke Howell and Richard Gabai all show 14 P • S • Y • C • H T • R N • 1 • C up too. Andrw Stevens was the exec producer. BIKINI DRIVE-IN (Bullseye, 94) P/D Fred Olen Ray, Kim (Ashlie Rhey) inherits the El Monte drive-in. David F. Freidman (in a real acting role) sends his son (Richard Gabai) and two comical goons (Russ Hagen and Peter Spellos) and to drive them away. A lot goes on and HOLLWOOD BOULEVARD type fake trailers, in jokes and gags abound (there’s even a PSYCHOTRONIC calendar), but sex is the main event (especially in this unrated version). Sarah Bellomo (aka pom star Roxanne Blaze) gets top honors for her unrated hot tub fuck. Rhey and Nikki Fritz have sex scenes, Michele Bauer is a naked screen queen star and others strip and dance on cars. With Conrad Brooks as the helpful projecUonist, Gordon Mitchell (in GOLIATH AND THE CHEERLEADERS), Forty Ackerman (a bug repellent gag), Melissa Moore (old footage), Steve Barkett, Hoke Howell and a pic of John Carradine. Jim Wynorski was an exec producer and Gaiy Graver was cinematographer. DO IT AGAIN DEADBEAT (Live, 94) D/S Adam Dubov, S Janice Shapiro, P George MoflQy, Christopher Lambert Here’s a simpler remake of THE TODD KILLINGS (71) that’s more like a comedy than Barry Shear’s disturbing original. Both are (partially) based on real occurrences. In 1965, Rudy (Balthazar Ghetty, who narrates) arrives in Albuquerque, NM and tries to fit in. A cmel, Beatle hating, singing greaser con man (Bruce Ramsey, also in KILLING ZOE) manipulates younger kids and brags that he killed a girl. With Natasha Gregson Wagner as the out of control rich girl (who enjoys sex in a graveyard), Sara Gilbert, Merdith Salenger and Deborah Harry as a mom. The soundtrack includes Link Wray songs (also featured in the recent ROADRACERS and even THE 12 MONKEES) and a Bobby Fuller 4 song for the theme. It was filmed in Tucson, AZ. KILLING OBSESSION (Triboro, 94) P/D/S/edit Paul Leder Believe it or not - here’s a sequel to Leder’s I DISMEMBER MAMA (aka POOR ALBERT AND LITTLE ANNIE) from 72! John Savage replaces Zooey Hall as Albert, released from an asylum after 21 years (and a lobotomy). He has fantasies about little Annie, now a grown photographer (Kimberly Chase), whose mother he had killed. He keeps finding (and killing) the wrong Annies. One is pom star Hypatia Lee and another is a very talkative guy in drag. Savage is a convincing disturbed killer but it s pretty boring. With topless scenes and slo mo flashbacks of little Annie dancing. As in other recent Leder movies, the cast members are introduced at the end. John Saxon is the asylum head, Bernard White is a hip police detective, Victoria Dillard is a doctor and Leder regular Bobby DiCiccio has a role. It wasseenonCinemax. THE MLMMY LIVES (Cannon, 93) D Gerry O’Hara, S Nelson Gidding, P Harry Alan Towers It says “suggested by a Poe story,” but this boring PG-13 movie is basically a remake of the original THE MUMMY with Tony Curtis (with his accent as always) in the modem day Karloff role (!) - but there’s no damned mummy! He says \"I am the protector of the dead” (many times, very slowly) and he wants the blonde (Leslie Hardy, who has a brief shower scene) who he thinks is the reincarnation of a princess. She has hallucinations, dreams and P • S • Y • C nightmares and the ’’scary’’ voice of a god is heard (“Join your friend in Hell!”). With deaths by snakes and cat and you get to see Curtis embalming a man alive. O’ Hara is best known for directing THE BITCH (79) starring Joan Collins. FRITZ LANG SECRET BEYOND THE DOOR (Republic, 48) P/D Fritz Lang, S Sylvia Richards An heiress Ooan Bennett) on vacation in Mexico, meets and marries Michael Redgrave. They go to his mansion and in a plot similar to SUSPICION, she thinks he may have murdered his first wife. He has rooms that are exact recreations of rooms where famous murders were committed. Redgrave (DEAD OF NIGHT) made a good psycho. ’The stylish Universal feature was based on a novel by Rufus King. It includes a dream sequence, was shot by Stanley Cortez and has a Miklos Rosa score with some music that was played and recorded backwards (!). It was Bennett’s 4th, last and least known Lang feature. Her husband Walter Wanger was executive producer. With Anne Revere and Natalie Schaefer. Michael Redgrai>€ in SECRET BEYOND THE DOOR FLORIDA GETTING EVEN (Continental, 76) D Harry E. Kerwin, P/S Wayne Crawford, Andrew Lane (TOMCATS, AVENGED) The bearded gang leader Crawford (aka Scott Lawrence) and his four pot smoking, hooker abusing yahoo followers rob, rape and kill at a diner. The law student brother (Chris Mulkey later on TWIN PEAKS) of a victim turns vigilante with a Colt 45 when the unrepentant killers are freed on a technicality. With the very familiar William Kerwin as a cop and Polly King as the girlfriend (she has nude scenes). This lowly Florida movie was released by Dimension (as ’TOMCA’TS) . Lane also has a role. Crawford is still busy (he’s stars in the new AMERICAN COP). HONEYMOON OF HORROR (Sinister, 64) D Irwin Meyer, S/ act Alexander Panas, P H. D. Meyer ’This is a tame alternate version of ORGY OF THE GOLDEN NUDES (!) made in the Miami area. Blonde Lilly (Abbey Heller, who narrates) marries a Euro artist (Robert Parsons) with a studio house. His insane artist brother (Panas), a creepy East Indian servant, a bitchy, slutty blonde (Beverly Lane), a money hungry lady manager and a jive talking beatnik dwarf (“Snuffy Miller) always seem to be around. Police show up to investigate some model murders and Lilly thinks “I was so confused”. A women is painted gold at party and a waitress does the twist. Mike shadows are visible. It’s terrible but I still wish 1 could see the “adult” version. THE FLORIDA CONNECTION (tnicorn, 78) D/S Robert J. Emery, S Bill Whitlock, P/S Massey Creamer Bad corrupt cops cheat good marijuana dealers in the Everglades. June Wilkinson (!) is a big chested platinum blonde charter pilot with an English accent. She’s hired by a hunk dope smuggler in bell bottoms played by her (at the time) football star husband Dan Pastori. With airboat rides, a dog race, some chases, shootouts, a comic dmnk and a (surprise!) ending. Pretty slow going. Bill Thurman, from Larry Buchanan movies, spies for the cops. The producer also made THE LEGEND OF BLOOD MOUNTAIN/DEMON HUNTER. N • I • C GIRARD A NAME FOR EVIL (Paragon, 70) D/S Bernard Gerard, P Reed Sherman (THE GROVE) Robert Culp drops out, wears love beads and takes his wife (Samantha Eggar) along and overseas the renovation of a huge old lakeside hotel. The incredible part of this muddled movie is when a white horse leads Culp away to a pagan spaghetti feast. Many completely naked people (including the star) writhe to the music (its like a scene from a rock opera) then mn around in the woods were he fucks his blonde dreamgirl Anne (Sheila Sullivan, also in Culp’s HICKY AND BOGGS). With music by Dominic Fontiere and Billy Joe Royal (!) who sings a really good song (written by Ed Cobb of The Standell's fame) amongst the writhing bodies. There’s also underwater nude swimming, a murder, a ghost (also Culp) and a castration scene. It was shot in Canada and Cinerama released it here in 73. MINDSNA’TCHERS (Prism, 72) D Bernard Girard, S Ron Whyte, P George Goodman (THE DEMON WITHIN, THE HAPPINESS CAGE) Christopher Walken stars as a cynical, sarcastic trouble making private stationed in Frankfurt, Germany. He’s arrested by MPs and taken to a remote mental hospital where scientists conduct pain and pleasure experiments. With a young looking Ronny Cox as a manic patient who laughs a lot, Ralph Meeker as a military leader and joss Ackland. Walken didn’t become well known until THE DEER HUNTER 7 years later. The PG rated Cinerama release (based on the novel ’The Happiness Cage) was filmed in Denmark and was backed by Joseph Papp. Walken played Elvis in a one man show at Papp’s Public Theatre in NYC a while back. O’Donnell) and kill a lady crook with a hook hand. Margaret Lancaster stars in the cartoonish comedy with Virginia Vanover as her short, thick headed Devil Dog addict best friend. 48 mins. Hi-8 video. $19-95 ppd to 123 W. 93 St. #2C, NYC 10025. GHOST BRIGADE (Triboro, 93) D George Hickenlooper, S Matt Greenberg, P Steve Stabler, Brad Krevoy All those costumes and guns from TNT’s GETTYSBURG mini series were still around so this useless horror movie full of slo mo scenes, nightmares, very confusing multiple flashbacks and real Civil War death photos was created. Stars Adrian Pasder and Corbin Bemsen both narrate flashbacks. Cynda Williams (ONE FALSE MOVE) is a clairvoyant mute slave woman and it turns out that an African tribe is behind a series of horrible massacres. Also with zombie kids, blood drinking, a soldier crucified up- side-down and a comic relief Brit. With Ray Wise, Alexis and David Arquette and Dean Cameron. Top- billed Martin Sheen is in one scene! Monte Heilman was the editor. TEMPTRESS (Par., 95) D Lawrence Lanoff, S Melissa Mitchell, P Michael Caine Karin (Kim Delaney), a photographer just back from India, b^mes possessed by her Goddess Kali statue. She mediates, chants, wants more, better and rougher sex and dances wildly at a patty in her giant loft. A Van Helsing type (Ben Cross) offers advice and a doctor (Jessica Walters) hypnotizes her but her out of control behavior still leads to tragedy and death. With frequent flashbacks, demon faces, some discreet sex scenes and a sexy photo shoot with Barbara Moore (Playboy’s Miss Dec, 93) in a giant martini glass. Also with Chris Sarandon (confused fiance). Dee Wallace Stone and Corbin Bemsen. It’s one of a new series of movies backed by Playboy. Lanoff also made the Shannon Tweed movie INDECENT BEHAVIOR (93). RECENT TALES FROM THE CRYPT PRESENTS DEMON NIGHT (MCA, 95) D Ernest Dickerson, S Ethan Reiff, Cyrus Voris, Mark Bishop, P Gilbert Adler After a too long and involved comedy Crypt Keeper intro, the supernatural Collector (Billy Zane) arrives at an unrealistic boarding house set that features invading demons. It’s all pretty senseless, dumb, irritating and has gratuitous silicone topless scenes. The second half is suspiciously similar to the mote recent FROM DUSK TO DAWN. William Sadler is the war vet with the magical key filled with the blood of Christ that can keep the demons (like the one on the airplane wing in The ’TWILIGHT ZONE movie) out. With Jada Pinkett as a tough ex con, Brenda Bakke as a hooker, CCH Pounder (who is only slowed down when her ami is ripped off), Dick Miller (in one of his biggest roles since the 50s) as a dmnk and John Larroquette. The ending was reshot. Dickerson also directed JUICE and SURVIVING THE GAME. The FX ate by Todd Masters. The heavy metal Atlantic soundtrack includes loud tunes by Ministry, Henry Rollins, Biohazard and Machine Head. B0RDEL1.0 IN BLOOD is the next in the series. BLONDE FURY (Garage Rock, 94) P/D/act Lee Bennett Sobel, S Lori Bonfitto Two New Jersey housewives (the opening copies a scene from MARRIED TO THE MOB) think their husbands (who are actually with some huge whores) have been kidnapped. They end up in bed together in a motel and eventually shoot the husbands. They also pick up a lesbian ex con (imitating Rosie DBIOMWKHT WILDER NAPALM (Col., 93) D Glenn Gordon Caron, S Vince Gilligan, P Mark Johnson, Stuart Comfeld Two rival brothers can make objects burst into flames. Wallace (Dennis Quaid) works for the circus and wants to be famous as “Dr. Napalm.” He also wants the wife (Debra Winger) of his straight laced brother Wilder (Arliss Howard), a volunteer fireman. She’s a pyromaniac arsonist under house arrest. There’s a fire duel and in cartoonish FX scenes, things melt, boil and blow up. With Jim Varney, M. Emmet Walsh and the Mighty Echoes as doo wop singing firemen. Barry Levinson was a co-producer of the odd Tri Star PG-13 comedy which spent time “on the shelf.” The music is by Michael Kamen. SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION (89) and PmTES (91). also critical and commercial flops, were on the same topic. VIBRATIONS (Dimensions, 94) D/S Michael Paseone, P John Dunning, Dan Lieberstin James Marshall is a curly haired suburban guy \\\\ith a band who looses his hands thanks to some dmnk local pranksters. He becomes a wino witli fake hands in NYC then meets a sympathetic girl (Christina Applegate) who works at a nightclub. Eventually he becomes a hit as “Cyberstorm,” a “robot” keyboard player. This romantic fantasy aimed at teen girls manages to throw in Gen X, and cyberspace cliches along with techno and rave music (90s disco) and the unlikely but popular happy communal apartment setting of the FRIENDS show. Also with Faye Grant and Paige Turco. I have no idea why this is rated R. Akira Fitton helps Jackie Chan promote his new film - RUMBLE IN THE BRONX. MOVIES. LOWEST PRICES! HUGE CATALOG!

Williams met and inter\\’iewed Price several times (both attended Yale although she graduated 44 years after he did) and she screened 94 (!) of his movies preparing for this book. Williams knows that some of his best roles were in lesser known non-horror (CHAMPAGNE FOR CAESAR, THE BARON OF ARIZONA) features and gives equal time to even the most obscure and/or critically hated movies. Everything is here, even his ads (from mink coats and liquor to a Shrunken Head Apple Sculpture) and his guest role on SCOOBY DOO. The long running Citadel Films Of series has improved a lot in recent years. This one looks especially great (with many illos in color) and has rare posters and ads along with the many stills. We sell this and the new French Price Horror Pictures (see Fanzines) through the mail (see pg. 23). LON CHANEY, JR. HORROR FILM STAR (McFarland, $32.50) Don G. Smith Surprisingly, this is the first entire book on Lon Chaney (he was also the topic of a recent A+E Biography show). The chapters on his early life and 30s film career are too short and most of the Universal horror movies have been covered to death but things pick up considerably with chapters on The Inner Sanctum Series, his supporting and character roles and the chapters covering his westerns, TV appearances and his declining exploitation movie years (including FIREBALL JUNGLE and THE FEMALE BUNCH). With plots for most movies, behind the scenes stories and the lyrics to the SPIDER BABY theme! An entire filmography ends the book. His last network TV' appearances were on THE MONKEES and THE TONIGHT SHOW and he did a commercial for Bold detergent. This is a welcome (236 pg.) release but now, I’d like to see a “films of’ Chaney book (like the Price title above). BEIJV LUGOSI (Midnight Marquee, $20) Gary J. + Susan Svehia Various writers cover 24 Lugosi movies in 21 chapters and there are also chapters on his early sound films, Richard Gordon remembering working with Lugosi and the ED WOOD movie. It’s great to see whole sections on MYSTERIOUS MR. WONG, MYSTERY OF MARIE CELESTE, BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA and MOTHER RILEY MEETS A VAMPIRE along with better known Universal and Monogram titles and there’s a filmography and some rare illos. Don’t know how they mixed up a picture of Brown and Carney with Mitchell and Petrillo though. This impressive 312 pg book is the first of a planned series from the world’s longest running horror movie fanzine (see Fanzines). Robert Clarke will be next! THAT’S BLAXPLOITATION (St. Martins, $14.95) Darius James Here’s a book that’s long overdue and thankfully it’s not by a condescending honky that writes books on any topic for the bucks. The facts and expected movies are here with reviews and photos but the “ whole book is irreverent and funny with interviews, choice dialog, art and comics mixed in. You might expect chapters on Fred Williamson (with quotes from the PV interview), Antonio Fargas, Pam Grier (who talks about what she wants), Tamara Dobson and Jim Brown but P-Funk artist Pedro Bell, members of the I.ast Poets and should be a household name director James Fanaka are all here too. James (aka Dr. Snakeskin) even covers THE THING WITH TWO HEADS, FAREWEIl UNCLE TOM and BLACKENSTEIN and there’s a “Whytesploitation’’ section. He also wrote the controversial book Negrophobia, See pg 23 to order. HONG KONG ACTION CINEMA (Titan, £14.99) Bey lx)gan This is the best book I’ve seen from Titan and the best looking and probably the most informative on the subject. Chapters cover Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Samo Hung, Lau Kar Leung, John Woo, fighting females, ghost movies and comedies. Great attention is given to the evolution and history of martial arts movies and family trees and extensive filmographies are included. Some of the many pictures are in color. I’d Lon Chaney has DEAD MAN'S EYES P • S • K • C • H T • R T be surprised if some American publisher didnt pick this up soon. Meanwhile, Titan is at 42-44 Dolben St. London, England SEl OUP. HAMMER FILMS - AN EXHAUSTIVE FILMOGRAPHY (McFarland, $65) Tom Johson + Deborah Del Vecchio All 165 Hammer studio films are here with cast, credits, plots and comments. No otlier book has given equal time to Hammer’s many non and pre horror releases. After a few 30s features, the Hammer story gets going full time after the war with (the lost) murder mystery^ DEATH IN HIGH HEELS (47). The studio becomes a famous horror factory (late 50s to the mid 70s) and goes out with a whimper with a remake of THE LADY VANISHES (78) starring Cybill Shepherd. My favorite parts of this book cover 50s m^'steries (many directed by Terence Fisher) with Diana Dors (great MAN BAIT ads) and American stars like Paulette Goddard, Lisabeth Scott, Barbara Payton, Tom Conway, Dane Clark and Dan Durv^ea. It’s surprising how many Hammer productions were based on T\\' shows. They also cover TV movies (briefly) and 75 Hammer shorts (WE DO BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, YOGA AND YOU, LAND OF THE LEPRECHAUNS...). The selection of stills and ads is excellent This volume, by the authors of Peter Cushing: Gentle Man Of Horror, also has larger pgs. (410 of them) than most previous McFarland books. FASTER AND FURIOUSER (McFarland, $40) Mark Thomas Mcghee This “revised and fattened fable of American International Pictures” has more (350) and larger pg?., more info (but fewer chapters) and more rare illos then the original (from 84). Chapters cover the formation of the company, directors Edward Cahn, Bert Gordon and Roger Corman, double bills, overseas productions, beach party and counter culture movies and direct to TV movies. Many quotes are added from recent interviews and Corman and ArkofPs autobiographies. The new illos (except for the authors drawing of B.I.G.) are great, especially the many sexy promo shots of actresses like Marla English, Fay Spain and Abby Dalton. The filmography (ABBY to ZONTAR) is expanded and many entries include who did what songs. VA VA VOOM! (Rhino, $17.95) Steve Sullivan Sullivan (the knowledgeable editor of the Glamour Girls newspaper) had written the first American book that’s similar to (if tamer than) the Italian Glittering Images books, often reviewed here. The careers of 19 beauties are examined in detail including lists of zine covers and layouts for collectors and film credits. The expected major stars (Marilyn, Jayne, Mamie, BB, Sophia...) are here along with June Wilkinson, Irish McCalla, Bettie Page, Meg Myles, Diane Webber and some strippers (Candy, Tempest and Lilli). It’s 288 pgs. with lots of sexy or nude shots (some are in color). This is the first book from the new Rhino imprint. See pg. 23 for ordering info. CHEAP TRICKS AND CLASS ACTS (McFarland, $49-95) John “JJ.” Johnson Covering the “special effects, makeup and stunts” in just (mostly low budget) 50s sci fi and horror movie is a great idea. This book (which has some excellent illos I’ve never seen) covers every possible type of FX and includes entire chapters on miniatures, contact lenses, backlots, exotic locales, stuntmen, ape suits plus Bronson Canyon and other over familiar California locations. Some of the behind the scenes heroes are George Barrows (he was ROBOT MONSTER!), Paul Blaisdell, Jack Rabin, Bob Bums and Harry Thomas. This has larger pages (404 of them) and better quality paper than most McFarland books and should be inspiring to all you indy filmmakers out there. Also with basic film credits and a personal checklist including many filmographies. NIGHTWALKERS (Taylor, $17.95) Bruce Lanier Wright Movies from the “modem era” of Gothic horror are covered in sections (Hammer’s Frankenstein and Dracula movies, ghost and Poe movies) with credits, plot and comments. Many, but not all of them are from Hammer studios (CARNIVAL OF SOULS, BLACK SUNDAY, HORROR EXPRESS and HOUSE OF DARK SHADOWS are here too) and the newest title is TO THE DEVIL- A DAUGHTER. Other chapters offer overviews and more recent movies and there’s a nice color section. THE DREAMWEAVERS (McFarland, $38.50) Goldherg, R + J-M Lofficier, Rahkin This book looks at I 6 features from the 80s, all big budget major studio releases except for NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET plus a chapter on 80s James Bond movies. Titles range from what I consider great (Cronenberg’s DEAD ZONE and VIDEODROME), neglected (BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA and SOMETHING WICKED...) to who cares!? (BACK TO THE FUTURE and GHOSTBUSTERS). They even cover HOWARD THE DUCK. Actors, directors and FX people are interviewed. Most of this was originally in Starlog, Fangoria, L’Ecran Fantastique and various other publications. 290 pgs. DESTROY ALL MONSTERS - “GEISHA THIS” (DAM, $30) Carey Loren, who formed the art/noise band DESTROY ALL MONSTERS in Ann Arbor around 74, has a mission and it’s to let people know about his original band. In 76, DAM added Ron Ashton (ex- Stooges) and Michael Davis (X- MC5), became heavier (“We had given up abstraction for power”), released singles, abused dmgs and played outside the Detroit area. The revamped group was great (I thought) but Loren was thrown out, spent some time in a mental ward and lost his artist/singer girlfriend, Niagara to Asheton. You can now buy a CD box set of early DAM, a video comp (reviewed elsewhere) and this limited edition combination history of the band and “best of’ Loren’s (part color) xerox DAM magazine (which always sold well in Cleveland’s Drome record store). Niagara is in this book a lot, along with other crazed midwestemers, mind expanding media images - and monsters. Also with a free 3 song flexi-disc featuring “I’m Bored.” Book Beat, 26010 Greenfield Rd., Oak Park, Ml 48237. DR. GOLDFOOT AND THE BIKINI MACHINE 2 P • S • Y • C • H ROCK & ROLL AN UNRULY HISTORY (Harmony, $40) Robert Palmer This was (partially) the basis for last years impressive 10 pt. PBS R+R History. The book also has 10 chapters, going from 50s rock to punk and Rap, but some are entirely different than the TV version. “Church Of The Sonic Guitar,\" for instance, is especially informative and shows who were the first to plug in, feed back and distort (none of them were British). John Coltrane, Julian Beck. Neal Cassady and Tommy lommi are here along with most of the people you’d expect and special attention is given to the innovations of The Velvets and The Stooges, James Brown. Sly and George Clinton. A brief part about 70s Cleveland bands has a nice pic of Pere Ubu’s Peter Laughner and David Thomas and since 1 played drums for Mirrors, Palmer adds that I’m a “trash film theorist”. It’s nice to have your name dropped in a book that also discusses Doug Clark and The Hot Nuts (but you might want to wait for asoftcover edition). THE WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIME (Citadel, $16.95) Michael Sauter Yes, this is a copy of all 4 of the Medved Brothers’ books (the last one was 10 years ago). The main part is a big budget top 50 (from SIGN OF THE CROSS in 32 to CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS: THE DISCOVERY). Most titles were also covered by the Medveds but some newer entries are DUNE, SANTA CLAUS THE MOVIE, - HOWARD THE DUCK, ISHTAR and two Bruce Willis flops. Easier target, older low budget horror and sci fi. movies have shorter write ups in a second section, making this book more fair and less insulting than but not as fun as The 50 Worst Films Of All Time. There’s a third (Golden Turkey Awards - like) section of catagories like Worst Elvis, Madonna or Ronald Reagan movie. We’ve reviewed videos and magazines from Redemption in the past. Now they have a line of movie novels. STRAW DOGS is a re-issue of Gordon Williams’ novel that Peckinpah’s 71 movie was based on. VIRGIN WITCH, by screenwriter Klaus Vogel, was originally published at the time of the 70 movie (PV # 17) and Jean Rollin’s LITTLE ORPHAN VAMPIRES (the slimmest volume) is based on the French director’s new feature. COUNTESS DRACULA is based on an unpublished screenplay by Michael Parry (not the Hammer film). These books each have 12 pg photo sections from the movies (except for COUNTESS which has new posed illos). They all feature nudity except for STRAW. Books are £7/99 each. Redemption (U.S.) is at 41 1 Anderson Ave. #109, Dept VC, Fairview, NJ 07022. We also received: COCKTAILS (St. Martins, $18.95) by Joseph Lanza. This small but excellent book traces the history and importance of mixed drinks in American history (and movies and music). Lanza also wrote Elevator Music. William A. Gordon’s SHOT ON THIS SITE (Citadel, $14.95) is divided by states and cities (or regions) and talks about movie and TV show locations. Cleveland includes THE DEER HUNTER, A CHRISTMAS STORY and even SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS. L.A. includes The Griffith Park Observatory and the Bradbury Building but where the Hell is the Bronson Canyon section? In the new updated 1996 edition of Craig Hosoda’s BARE FACTS VIDEO GUIDE. You can find out exactly where to find scenes with sex and nudity by looking up an actress (about 50% of the book), an ^tor or a movie title. There’s detailed info about some titles that aren’t even in release yet and new stars have been added. (See pg 23 for order info.) ASIAN TRASH CINEMA: THE BOOK (Part 2) (Vital, $1995) by Thomas Weiser includes reviews of many movies not in Vol. 1 (PV #18) plus a section on 70s kung fu movies and extensive actor and director filmographies. The digest size book is available fron Video Search Of Miami (see ad). THE FRANKENSTEIN SCRAPBOOK (PV #20) from England is now out in America (from Citadel). See pg. 23. Chas. Baiun’s delayed (I can relate) MORE GORE SCORE (Fantasma, $12.95) reviews and rates (overall quality and gore content) movies not in his previous book(s) up to 92. Illos include some rare ads. The highest possible rating (4 skulls and a 10) goes to THE KILLER and BAD TASTE. Douglas Brod’s MONEY, WOMEN AND GUNS (Citadel, $17.95) covers 50 modem crime movies from BONNIE AND CLYDE and POINT BLANK to 4 recent movies that Tarentino directed or wrote.
