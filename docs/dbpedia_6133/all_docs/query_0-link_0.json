The bulls escaped and decided to wander down to La Caleta beach for a dip and to sunbathe before being rounded up again. Among other things, this left the producers on the horns of a dilemma.\n\nSome of the Cádiz streets used were Calles Cánovas del Castillo, San José, Presidente Rivadavia and the Plaza de San Antonio.\n\nThe scene with the bulls ends at Sevilla’s bullring, the Plaza de Toros de la Maestranza, but not before passing through various streets of both Sevilla and Cádiz, sneaking between two of Sevilla’s modern trams.\n\nThe whole Spanish section of the film is supposed to take place in Sevilla, and to give it a special flavour, during the internationally famous festival of San Fermín, for which reason we see the authentically dressed ‘runners’ in their white clothing and red bandannas. The only problem is that the festival takes place in northern Spain, in Pamplona. Cruise did something similar with Valencia’s Fallas festival, which he also placed in Andalusia in one of the Mission Impossible episodes.\n\nThe action also takes place in Salzburg, although Sevilla’s Santa Justa station played the part of the Austrian city’s.\n\nThe movie’s biggest chase scene was filmed mostly in Sevilla, near the city’s Cathedral at Plaza Virgen de los Reyes. The Cathedral is the first image we see in the Sevilla section, after scenes in Salzburg, Austria.\n\nThe city with the fortress on the hill, seen from the hotel balcony, was Cádiz, the old town of Cádiz being the setting for the scene where Cruise meets a representative of an arms dealer.\n\nThe port of Cádiz was also used for the end of the car chase, which actually began in Sevilla (80 miles away).\n\nThe big gunfight scene was filmed at the Casa de Pilatos, the same one that was used in ‘Lawrence of Arabia.’ This is probably the most painful part of the film for art lovers, as we have to put up with bullets destroying the exquisite Arabian mosaics while Cruise casually woos Diaz, and the rest of us admire the fountains, arches and gardens, and remember that the word ‘paradise’ actually comes from Arabic and means ‘a walled garden.’\n\nCasa de Pilatos is the hide-out of Spanish villain Antonio (played by Spanish actor Jordi Mollá), and it is by crashing through the main entrance that Cruise and Diaz escape on their motorbike.\n\nThe construction of this palace was begun by Pedro Enriquez de Quiñones and his wife Catalina de Rivera. It was completed by Pedro’s son Fadrique Enriquez de Ribera (first Marquis of Tarifa), whose pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1519 was the origin of the name ‘Pilate’s house.’ On his return, he supposedly discovered that the distance between the ruins of Pontius Pilate’s house and Golgotha was the same as that between his palace and a local temple known as the Cross of the Field. Sevillian imagination did the rest.\n\nDuring their stay, Cruise and Diaz were lodged in the Alfonso XIII hotel, which was also a set for ‘Lawrence of Arabia.’ The entire hotel would later be rented by the cast and crew for the international premiere of the film on June 16th at the Lope de Vega theatre in Sevilla.\n\nMr. Nice (2010)\n\nHoward Marks was one of those drug dealers who it’s hard to dislike; one who partook of his own product.\n\nHis book, largely written in US high security prisons, was the basis of this film about his life as an international drug smuggler based in Mallorca.\n\nIn Alicante province the production team filmed his extradition hearing, making use of Mutxamel Town Hall’s Council Chamber, while the Police Station was the old El Salvador school in the same town.\n\nOne meeting takes place in a bar in front of the Church of the Virgin del Consuelo in Altea.\n\nAnother of the locations used was the old tobacco factory in Alicante, while the City of Light studios were used for interiors.\n\nClash of the Titans (2010)\n\nLiam Neesen and Ralph Fiennes star in this remake of a 1981 classic of angry Gods and slightly worse humans, filmed largely in Spain.\n\nAmong the selected locations used in May and June 2009 in Tenerife were the Teide National Park, where at the base of Spain’s highest mountain most of the filming took place, and the coast in the districts of Icod, Buenavista del Norte and Guía de Isora, plus some pinewoods and mountain areas, as well as the Timanfaya National Park in Lanzarote and the Garajonay park on La Gomera island.\n\nProduction Designer Martin Laing explained that they had looked all around the planet for locations and could have gone anywhere in the world, but that Tenerife had so many beautiful and dramatic landscapes.\n\nThe mines were those of San José, where the first temple in the film was located, while the first camp was situated at la Cañada de Capricho and on the slopes of Mount Guajara.\n\nAt Llano de Ucanca our mythical heroes took their long walk on the backs of the giant scorpions, with whom they initially fought.\n\nDuring their journey with the scorpions they cross the dunes of the natural park at Maspalomas in Gran Canaria.\n\nThe film heroes also walked through the sea of clouds, a strange meteorological phenomenon which separates the very different northern and southern parts of the island.\n\nIn northern Tenerife the film’s producers also took advantage of the forest, known locally as ‘Laurisilva’, an endemic type of humid subtropical forest found on several of the islands of the North Atlantic, such as Madeira and the Azores, a relic of the Pliocene subtropical forests.\n\nThe Way (2010)\n\nTired of playing President Bartlett, and a little bit old to make ‘Apocalypse Later,’ Martin Sheen went to northern Spain to make a film directed by his son Emilio Estevez and set on St. James’ Way, the medieval pilgrim route better known as the ‘Camino de Santiago.’\n\nThe castle of Castrojeriz appears for only a few seconds as the credits roll at the start of the film, just before we see Martin Sheen on a train, on the way to identify his son’s body in Sant Jean Pied de Port.\n\nThe opening credits are a cleverly woven selection of images, music and maps, and the castle, which is at one of the key villages, halfway along the Camino de Santiago, is a silent reference to the Spanish hinterland, steeped in historical conflicts and saturated in castles.\n\nAmong the less than happy visitors to the castle were Leanor of Castile, Queen of Aragon, who was murdered there by her nephew Pedro I of Castile in 1359.\n\nPoor Leanor had a number of unhappy run-ins with the Spanish aristocracy. She was initially engaged to the heir to the kingdom of Aragon, Jaime, but he renounced the material world and became a monk, which is not the most flattering way to woo a young girl. In the end she married his widowed younger brother Alfonso, who became Alfonso IV of Aragon.\n\nShe had two sons; the younger of them, Juan, was murdered by order of King Pedro of Castilla, and the elder was ordered murdered by his own step-brother, Pedro of Aragon, after her death.\n\nMonarchy ain’t what it used to be.\n\nThe Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 severely damaged the castle, as it did many others on the Iberian Peninsular.\n\nIt was a site once occupied by Celts and Romans, and there is even a legend that Julius Caesar founded the place.\n\nThe current castle remains were built by the Arabs in the 9th century, using a Roman tower as a starting point.\n\nSheen follows the French Way, one of several that take pilgrims to Santiago. He starts in France at Saint Jean Pied de Port, before following Napoleon’s Route, in reference to the French Emperor’s unsuccessful (eventually) invasion of Spain, visiting the Navarra villages of Gainecoleta, Ibañeta and Roncesvalles (considered by many as the starting point in Spain, although it is not the first Spanish village).\n\nEven though many of the exterior shots at Roncesvalles are genuine, the interiors of the hostel were shot on a set constructed next to the old town mill, and when Sheen emerges in the morning he is actually leaving the Hotel La Posada, where he spends a night among fellow snorers and where he is attended by famous Spanish actress Angela Molina (Columbus’s wife in Ridley Scott’s ‘1492’).\n\nThe tunnel he walks through however, does lead to the real site of the pilgrims’ hostel.\n\nThe way continues through Mezkiritz, with its watering hole for visitors, where our ‘caminantes’ briefly pause by the village fountain after buying some goat’s cheese. We spoke here to Carlos, who informed us that Anthony Quinn had been in the village filming years ago. He also told us that some scenes from ‘Robin and Marian’ had been shot at a nearby campsite.\n\nAlso on the way were Lintzoain, Larrasoaña and Akerreta (where there is another pilgrim hostel in the film). In reality the hostel is the Hotel Akerrata, where filming took place from 4th to 7th October 2009.\n\nOwner Joxemari informed us that the cast and crew were upset that they couldn’t stay in this rural paradise as the production took up all the available space. For the tiny village of Akerrata the making of the film was an amazing experience. It is here that Sheen meets Sarah, who is suppering with a group of French pilgrims arguing about Charlemagne and Roldan.\n\nThe discussion takes place in the hotel’s front garden with its green, eye-massaging views of the valley.\n\nWe stayed at the hotel ourselves in the summer of 2011 and were able to confirm that the hotel is indeed situated on the pilgrims’ way; in fact it is the clickety clack of pilgrim walking sticks that wakes guests up long before the dawn chorus gets going.\n\nIn the film, bullfighting fan Simón Andreu plays the hosteller.\n\nIrota, Arleta, the River Arga and Zariquiegui also appear until finally Sheen makes it to Navarra’s capital, Pamplona, entering through one of the gates to the old fortress city.\n\nTurning sharp left and up a bit of a slope he would have come to the Restaurante Caballo Blanco, where he finds his corpulent Dutch friend feasting on lamb chops, although in the film he approaches from the arched street next to the restaurant, going completely the wrong way.\n\nHowever, for the most part the film faithfully follows the route of the Camino de Santiago, but we were informed by Koldo Lasa at the Navarra Film Institute (INACC) that a little cheating was necessary for the scene where Sheen drops his rucksack into the river. The bridge from which he drops it can be found at Aoiz, to the west of Pamplona and well off the pilgrim route.\n\nThe need for abundant, fast running water sent the film crew to this medieval bridge just below the Itolz Reservoir, where the last summer waters were being released for agricultural purposes.\n\nOn leaving Pamplona he ascends one of the route’s best known mountains, Monte del Perdón, with its silhouettes of pilgrims marching defiantly onwards, intent no doubt on quixotically taking on the giant modern windmills that share the crest of the mountain range.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill is the church of Santa María de Eunate, a delightfully simple church accompanied only by a pilgrims’ hostel, walking towards which he speaks to the priest with brain cancer.\n\nAlso in Navarra he visits Trinidad de Arre and Irache with its famous Monastery, where he stays in a hostel, in which the pilgrims are sleeping in bunk beds in the cloister.\n\nThe pilgrims don’t really sleep there, as the warden Alberto explained to us. He showed us the courtyard where Napoleon’s troops were once stationed after turning out the monks at what was the first hospital on the Camino.\n\nMoving into La Rioja we enjoy a visit to the police station in the capital, Logroño, after Sheen is arrested for combining drunkenness and patriotism, and frog-marched to Calle Ruavieja number 47 in the historic centre. It’s quite a walk considering that the scene where he gets drunk was filmed in Haro, at the Bodega CVNE.\n\nI’m not especially hostile to monarchy per se, but when King Felipe VI’s visit to Haro in July 2020 coincided with mine, it was inevitable that if either of us was going to be inconvenienced, it would be me, and thanks to the hundreds of police officers protecting him most efficiently, I was forced to drive an extra 50 kilometres on a paying motorway just to get back to my hotel in Briones.\n\nWe were received at CVNE by the delightful, English speaking Natalia, who took us around this winery, now in its 5th generation of Urrutia family ownership.\n\nAlthough the scene from The Way was quite short, they were here three days filming, with their own catering area.\n\nThe bodega was chosen because it looked like a typical Spanish village, where our pilgrims pause to explore Rioja wine and Martin gets patriotically irate.\n\nThe bodega visit is full of surprises, including a cellar designed by none other than Gustav Eiffel, he of the tower, and various rooms full of barrels and 100 year old bottles belonging to a company that started producing its flagship Imperial wine specifically for the UK market.\n\nThe CVNE bodega isn’t on the Camino either in fact.\n\nWe return to Navarra to visit Viana and Torres del Rio (for the scene with the crazy hostel owner Ramón, which I usually fast forward) and Azofra.\n\nIn Burgos province we wind our way through Redecilla del Camino, Castrojeriz (whose castle is seen in an aerial view during the opening credits) and Tosantos, where we visit the church, and San Juan de Ortega.\n\nOur pilgrims enter Burgos through the city gate; although the Camino doesn’t. They gather at the Rincón de España restaurant, just inside the old city, where Sheen’s rucksack is stolen by a young gypsy boy.\n\nIn Burgos we also see Rabé de las Calzadas, Hornillos and El Molino and San Bol, with their pilgrims’ hostels and the ruins of the Convent of San Antón.\n\nIt is near Hornillos, at a cottage called El Molino del Camino, where Joost helps cook a meal for the other pilgrims.\n\nDuring their stay in Burgos, they were lodged in the Velada Hotel.\n\nIn León province Bercianos del Real Camino, El Burgo Ranero, Reliegos, Santa Catalina de Somoza, El Ganso, Foncebadón and Manjarín all turn up along the way.\n\nIn León capital Sheen invites his fellow travellers to a night at the Parador Hotel of San Marcos, previously a 16th century monastery, accompanied by the music of the immortal (dead) Nick Drake. Filming took place during 3 days using rooms 366 and 359. One of the hotel receptionists, Juan Miguel, played the waiter who provided the room service.\n\nThe extraordinary facade of the hotel is lovingly employed during the scene when the pilgrims arrive there.\n\nThey next visit the Cruz de Ferro, an iron cross on a wooden pole where traditionally each pilgrim makes a wish or promise and adds a stone to the pile.\n\nLugo province takes us to O Cebreiro, (for the scene where Jack explains his wish to be a writer like Joyce or Yeats as they walk out of the village), the Alto de San Roque and Lugar de Vilamaior.\n\nSheen’s own father was a Galician immigrant from Salceda de Caselas, in Pontevedra.\n\nOur group end up in Santiago de Compostela with its outstanding Cathedral in the Plaza de Obradoiro, which they visit, although restrictions today would prevent some of their gestures with statues.\n\nAt A Coruña province we first see the spires of Santiago from Monte do Gozo, and after the obligatory visits to the cathedral, Plaza de las Platerías and the Pilgrim office to get their Compostela certificates, the group continues to Muxia near Finisterre (literally Land’s End), where we see the viewpoint (Mirador) do Corpiño, the lighthouse and the Sanctuary of Virxe da Barca. Here his journey ends, and Sheen casts the ashes of his son towards the sea and, we hope, finds closure.\n\nThe Camino de Santiago has existed for over a thousand years and is one of the great Christian pilgrimage routes, along with Rome and Jerusalem.\n\nThe film led directly to a multiplication by 5 of the number of Americans on the Camino the following year.\n\nBuried (2010)\n\nRyan Reynolds wakes up inside a coffin and quite naturally would like to get out.\n\nAlthough filmed by Rodrigo Cortés in Barcelona, nearly the whole story takes place inside the coffin and therefore any plans to pay a visit would require relinquishing group rates.\n\nThe Disciple (2010)\n\nA new take on the story of Jesus, with filming taking place around Baza and Orce in Granada province.\n\nThe opening scenes show us the Holy Land, although it is in reality the Sierra de Baza, and all the scenes with expanses of water (including Mary Magdalen walking on the water) were filmed at the Negratín reservoir.\n\nThe scenes in front of some cliff caves, where the rebels led by Jesus are frequently seen and occasionally put to the sword by Romans, are in fact the Cuevas Almagruz at Purullena, near Guadix in Granada province. The crew and actors stayed at the tourist complex Cuevas Almagruz nearby.\n\nThe films shot there are well documented by Manuel, the manager, who provides cave accommodation (much more upmarket than it sounds), and an amazing educational service documenting and demonstrating cave-life in Granada province throughout the ages.\n\nIn Baza, which represents Galilee, the crew filmed the scenes where Saint John and Saint Luke argue about what Jesus really did, in the Baños Árabes.\n\nHerod’s castle was the Alcazaba de los Siete Torres in Orce and the town’s old city wall provides the backdrop to a market scene replete with conventional Roman repression, and the scenes of Jesus carrying the cross were also filmed there.\n\nFour Lions (2010)\n\nSome people might doubt the wisdom of a comedy about terrorist bombings in London, but here it is anyway. The film is in fact hilarious, an updated version of ‘The Life of Brian’ with clear Monty Python influences, although you can’t help looking over your shoulder as you laugh to check that your head’s still up there on top.\n\nWhen the aspiring suicide bombers go to Pakistan for their training, they are in fact to be found at Las Salinillas in Almería, one of the locations for ‘The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.’\n\nAlmería expert José Enrique Martínez informed us that he identified Monte Alfaro, Viciana and Trujillo (Tabernas) from a trailer.\n\nI Want to Be a Soldier (2010)\n\nA warning about how media violence can affect the young, the film was made entirely in and around Barcelona, including L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, and has performances by Robert Englund and Danny Glover.\n\nGlover plays the director of Alex’s school, which is in reality the Colegio Alemán at Esplugues de Llobregat.\n\nA film guaranteed to dissuade anyone who had ever considered having children.\n\nRoom in Rome (2010)\n\nThe beginning and end of the film were shot in Via del Corso in Rome, and the rest was filmed on a studio set in Madrid, with Roman rooftops added in post-production.\n\nVarious languages were used in the film, in which a Russian and a Spanish girl find some kind of mutually satisfying chemistry.\n\nBut English is the main language in a film directed by Julio Medem, whose ‘Lucia y el Sexo’ has become a cult film all over the world, possibly because of the sex.\n\nThe Russian actress Natasha Yarovenko was living in Barcelona when cast.\n\nMagic Journey to Africa (2010)\n\nA young girl meets an African boy in Barcelona, and begins an imaginary journey to Africa.\n\nThe film tells the story of Namibia; its legends and people.\n\nThe hospital used in Barcelona, where the African boy is recuperating, was the well-known Santa Creu i Sant Pau, designed by architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner.\n\nAlso briefly seen early on during an aerial shot is the 144 metre tall Torre Agbar, completed in 2005 in the Placa de las Glories. It was designed by French architect Jean Nouvel as the HQ for Aguas de Barcelona, a local water company, and its shimmering blue and red phallic shape has become a talking point of Barcelona’s skyline.\n\nThe pizzeria, where girl meets boy while boy is trying to earn a crust nicking mobile phones, was Buongiorno in Calle Comte D’Urgell 239, although the wood panelling has apparently gone now.\n\nWith its talking flowers, jackals and lions, raining, flaming books, fire spirits and old men in white robes, the film clearly demonstrates that the sixties are not quite dead and gone, yet.\n\nExorcismus (2010)\n\nA Spanish version of ‘The Exorcist’ with a largely British and Irish cast and filmed in English, although in Spain they will dub it back into Spanish as usual and then continue wondering why it is that Spanish people find it so hard to learn English, unlike the Portuguese, who don’t dub their films.\n\nTo add a little appropriate spookiness, they used the Casa Arnús, also known as El Pinar. Built in 1903, this turreted palace is to be found in the hills above Barcelona, where the pine forests of Collserola begin, next to the cable car that rises to the Tibidabo amusement park.\n\nThe hospital and morgue scenes were shot at Hospital General de Catalunya, (Sant Cugat) and the Tanatorio at Badalona, while exteriors of the family house were filmed at Palau de Plegamans.\n\nSome of the road scenes were shot in the Maresme area of Barcelona province, to the north east of the city of Barcelona, and the park of Montjuïc also appears.\n\nPuzzled Love (2010)\n\nA romantic story set in Barcelona and directed not by Woody Allen but by 13 cinema students.\n\nPerhaps that’s why the story is about 2 Erasmus students falling in love instead of studying hard and making the most of all that European funding.\n\nAmong the locations were the student flat in the district of Eixample, the Sala Razzmatazz for some scenes of typical student cultural activity, the old Terminal 1 of the airport, the beach at La Mora near Tarragona, and the Delta del Ebro in Tarragona province for the scenes with the wheatfield and desert.\n\nOur thanks to Pau Luzón, who participated in the making of the film, for clarifying these locations.\n\nDi Di Hollywood (2010)\n\nEmilio J Alhambra of the Ciudad de la Luz Film Commission in Alicante informed us that filming took place in November 2009, and that locations included Alicante, Ciudad de la Luz (stage 5 and water tank back lot), Casino Mediterráneo, Plaza Gabriel Miro, Hotel Sidi San Juan, Restaurante Niza, Motel Abril, Discoteca Zeta and San Juan beach.\n\nIn Benidorm they used the Asia Gardens, Terra Natura (for a brief scene with Di Di making a film in which she appears about to be ravaged), Hospital de Levante (where Di Di’s friend María dies after being run over on a bridge by the City of Arts and Sciences, Valencia) and Bahamas.\n\nShooting also took place in Elche’s Hotel Huerto del Cura, in L’Alfàs del Pi at the Sha Welness Clinic, in Mutxamel at the aerodrome and in boring old Miami and Los Angeles, USA.\n\nTowards the end of the picture, with Di Di now a superstar, she stays at Valencia’s Westin Hotel for the premiere of her new film ‘Pacific.’\n\nThe premiere actually takes place at the architecturally Sci Fi complex, the City of Arts and Sciences, which also appears in the opening scene as a flashback, including interior shots of the screening inside the Opera House.\n\nDirector Bigas Luna wrote and directed a film that moves from Spain to the USA and back using both Spanish and English quite sensibly, depending on who is speaking to whom. It stars Elsa Patakay and American film star Peter Coyote, who jangled keys in ‘ET.’\n\nMad Dogs (2010)\n\nMore of a four part, four hour series than a film, although it has the chronological coherence of a feature.\n\nThe story of four old school friends who visit Mallorca looking for the fifth.\n\nSóller, Pollenca and Palma are among the locations.\n\nUnderground (2010)\n\nNo tasty vampires in this one but a creature that lives in the underground, where some young graffiti artists like to display their wares.\n\nShot in Bilbao, Vizcaya, and Lleida by the enigmatically named Galician director Tinieblas Gonzalez, with English with American actors.\n\nMany scenes were shot in the Bilbao underground, particularly in and around Basarrate station.\n\nIn Spain the film is known as ASD.\n\nMaximum Shame (2010)\n\nBarcelona director Carlos Atanes is responsible for this self-described apocalyptic fetish horror musical chess sci-fi weird movie, with lots of S&M in abandoned factory sets, apparently located in Terrassa, Barcelona.\n\nYoung Spanish actors appear to ad-lib their way through some musical numbers, but that’s ok as this is ‘underground.’\n\nCircuit (2010)\n\nIn the world of fashion photography everyone is important and sensitive.\n\nShooting took place at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, and at Sabadell, as well as El Prat de Llobregat.\n\nKatmandu (2011)\n\nLaia leaves her life in Barcelona to work in a poor school in Nepal. Her unhappy childhood includes time spent in a convent school, depicted in the Escola Pia Sabadell.\n\nShooting also took place at El Berguedà and Manllue.\n\nPowder (2011)\n\nPowder is a comedy about a rock band making the big time, with a brief visit to Ibiza for a suicide.\n\nPlaying a small part is The Smiths’ guitarist Johnny Marr.\n\nThe Honey Killer (2011)\n\nRichard Harrison, Director, Co-writer and Producer of The Honey Killer from Razor Films in London told us that the film was made in Ronda, Montejaque and Gaucín in Málaga province in August 2008.\n\nThe Flamenco scene was shot at Anna María’s, in Marbella old town, famous for having some of the best and most authentic Flamenco in Spain. The scene where Janine dances Flamenco was improvised and shot in one and a half hours.\n\nThe bar where Darryl meets Rik was found by accident just 24 hours before it was filmed and the bar owner, Santana, actually plays himself.\n\nThe village, near which Darryl has rented a villa, is Gaucín, with its white houses and castle looming above.\n\nThe Impossible (2011)\n\nEwan McGregor and Naomi Watts star in this film including scenes shot in Alicante, although the true star is a Tsunami.\n\nThe film has a Spanish director, Juan Antonio Bayona, and writer Sergio G. Sanchez, and filming began in Alicante in August 2010, before transferring to Thailand.\n\nNaomi Watts started filming in Alicante’s City of Light in mid-September.\n\nThere were also some underwater scenes, originally supposed to be filmed in Thailand, but later patched together in Barcelona’s Piscina Bernat Picornell i Piscines Muncipals de Montjuïc.\n\nWeekender (2011)\n\nI’d always thought that it was a bad thing to rave, but apparently it is not a symptom of disease, but a scene, and people do it when they’re not chilling out.\n\nWhere did my life go?\n\nIbiza is the place to rave apparently, although the natives may beg to differ. However, Stephen Salter of Benchmark Films informed us that they sneakily used Gaucín, near Estepona in the province of Málaga as a substitute for the island of the beautiful people; perhaps to keep the actors out of the all-night discos!\n\nAccording to the film’s director in the audio commentary, the sumptuous hillside villa once belonged to Richard Burton’s first wife, Sybil Williams.\n\nOur heroes (thieves, drug dealers and they don’t pay taxes; whatever happened to Roy Rogers?) Matt and Dylan supposedly pay a brief visit to Ibiza, where they see the light, and Matt finds his dream beach and opens his dream beach bar.\n\n11-11-11 (2011)\n\nThe title refers to the date when one of those inconvenient gates to a nasty world full of monsters can be opened.\n\nYet another in a now long line of Spanish productions, brewed in Barcelona but with an international cast speaking English.\n\nShooting began on the 17th of January 2011 under the direction of Darren Lynn Bousmann, who was responsible for three of the ‘Saw’ saga, and who loves Spain enough to have proposed to his wife at the Sitges film festival.\n\nBarcelona and Sant Vicenç de Montalt (site of the house with the tower that is destroyed) are the locations, including the maze in Barcelona’s Parque del Laberint, which is where Joseph and Sadie are cornered in the maze by Javier, who threatens Joseph with a gun.\n\nThe cemetery l’Est or de Poblenou also appears.\n\nThere Be Dragons (2011)\n\nAlthough mostly shot in Argentina, Roland Joffré’s film set in the Spanish Civil War, and telling in part the story of José María Escrivá, founder of Opus Dei, also involved two weeks of shooting in Sepúlveda, Segovia.\n\nThe creator of ‘The Mission’ employed mud and earth to transform the streets of Sepúlveda into the ‘authentic’ 1908 streets of Barbastro, Huesca, Escrivá’s hometown. The Streets used were Lope Tablada, San Batolomés, Santos Justo y Pastor, Comandante Cristóbal, Los Fueros, Conde Sepúlveda, Sancho García, the plazas Mayor, Virgen de los Pucherillos and de la Fuente, the arches Ecce Homo and de la Judería, and the cemetery.\n\n150 extras were used and the local council netted a very much welcome 18,000 euros for their trouble.\n\nGeraldine Chaplin, who shot ‘Doctor Zhivago’ in Spain, returned for a role in this film. Both she and director Joffé were among the crew lodged in the Hotel Vado de Duratón during the second fortnight of October.\n\nThe title of the film refers to the comments written by cartographers on maps to describe unexplored areas.\n\nIntruders (2011)\n\nCanary Island director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is responsible for this paranormal drama focused on two children; one in Madrid and one in London.\n\nIn south east Madrid filming focused on Calle Hacienda de Pavones, in the district of Moratalaz, where the entrance to the young boy’s flat was situated, specifically at number 99, although the producers also had to cut a deal with the residents at number 97 in order to erect the scaffolding.\n\nThe children’s playground where two priests stroll while discussing the possible ‘possession’ of the boy was created in a green zone nearby.\n\nFilming also took place in a pedestrian street, Avenida Fernández Ladreda in Segovia in September 2010, when 80 local extras collaborated under the artificial rain of sprinklers hoisted on cranes. The photography shop there is really a bank. Another scene was shot in the old prison.\n\nClive Owen stars, as does Spanish actress Pilar Lopez de Ayala, although the Bogeyman outshines both.\n\nWe Need to Talk about Kevin (2011)\n\nIn a symbolic gesture meant to make the viewer concentrate on the colour red, the film kicks off with the exuberant ‘Tomatina’ tomato throwing festival celebrated every August in Buñol, Valencia.\n\nThe festival dates back to August 1945 when a group of youngsters started throwing vegetables at each other until the police arrived.\n\nDuring the 50s it was briefly banned, but popular demand (not a common occurrence under Franco) brought it back after the local people had carried a coffin containing a tomato, accompanied through the streets by the local band.\n\nIn 1957 the festival was legalized and the Town Hall took over its organization, despite which it has survived and prospered, and now attracts an international crowd almost comparable with San Fermín.\n\nThe film, about a serial killer’s mother (Tina Swinton), is neither as exuberant nor as much fun as the festival, which is in fact her only moment of pleasure as she is covered in Vitamin C while covering the festival for a travel magazine.\n\nHaywire (2011)\n\nIn February 2010 filming started in Barcelona on this Steven Soderbergh thriller starring Michael Douglas, Bill Paxton and Ewan McGregor.\n\nThe rescue of a hostage in this film takes place in Barcelona, with Ciutat Vella; Plaza Reial, la Rambla del Raval, Calle Ample, Mirador de l’Alcalde de Montjuïc, and Plaza George Orwell for the scenes when Gina Carano is betrayed by Antonio Banderas.\n\nJack and Jill (2011)\n\nAdam Sandler does a ‘Victor Victoria,’ playing his own twin sister, whereas Al Pacino plays Al Pacino.\n\nBellver Castle on the outskirts of Palma, Mallorca appears in the scenes seen from the air when Pacino helicopters Jack, disguised as his sister, (double disguised really) into the castle for a seduction supper. The unique circular cloister is also briefly seen.\n\nWork on the castle was commissioned by Jaume II, King of Mallorca in 1300.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Bailén in 1808 it was a prison for Napoleon’s defeated soldiers.\n\nOnly six years later General Lacy, who participated in a failed liberal rebellion against King Fernando VII, faced a firing squad in the castle moat.\n\nIn 1821, the castle was used as a mint.\n\nIn 1931 it was turned over to Palma Council and it now holds various cultural activities such as summer concerts.\n\nSpanish actor Santiago Segura participates playing (who would have guessed?) a Spanish gigolo.\n\nThe Inbetweeners (2011)\n\nBased on the TV series, the film version included bar scenes at Calvià, Mallorca, shot there in March 2011.\n\nCalle de Punta Ballena and the promenade of the Magaluf beach were among the locations, which are supposedly Greece in the film.\n\nAmong the bars used were the Daiquiri Palace and Revolution, with shooting in Palma and Sóller.\n\nBoronia Backpackers (2011)\n\nTwo Australians from back in the woods Boronia decide to ‘do’ Europe and pass through 20 countries, including a visit to Barcelona.\n\nThe Perfect Stranger (2011)\n\nColm Meaney is at the centre of this story, and the only person speaking English for the most part.\n\nHe plays a foreigner whose arrival at a small village causes all sorts of excitement among the locals.\n\nMajorcan director Toni Bestard used his hometown of Bunyola, as well as Llucmajor, Calvià and Campanet, all of which are in Mallorca, for which the rustic film is a showcase, showing the idyllic side of the island.\n\nWhile visiting the Raixa Estate, we were informed that a set had been built there in an old servants’ quarters for the making of the film, and that the end of shooting party had been held at Raixa.\n\nTrangression (2011)\n\nMichael Ironside is part of an international cast for this Spanish film, which also stars Carlos Bardem.\n\nThe transgression in question is four criminals breaking into someone’s home, which is in Barcelona.\n\nZindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011)\n\nThe film was made all over Spain, starting in June 2010. It tells the story, in typical Rom-Com, Buddy-Buddy, Road Movie Indian style with three young men who go to Spain and find all the usual stuff as each overcomes some fear or problem.\n\nBarcelona appears briefly with some shots of the city’s symbol, Gaudí’s Sagrada Familia Cathedral, and further north the camp site of Illa Mateua at L’Escala was the base for the scuba diving scenes.\n\nIn Buñol, Valencia, the internationally famous Tomatina festival that takes place in August was recreated so that tons (16 of them imported from Portugal) of ripe tomatoes could be thrown around by fervent advocates of world famine relief.\n\nIn the film’s climax, a Bollywood version of a song called ´Señorita’ was shot in Alájar, Huelva, with a lot of local extras in typical costume, including the Mayor. The song has apparently made Spain very popular in India and increased the interest in all things Spanish.\n\nIn Pamplona, Navarra, they run with the bulls, and filming also took place in Carmona, Sevilla, Ronda, in the province of Málaga, famous for its gorge and bridge, which appear in an aerial view, and Setenil de las Bodegas, Grazalema and Zahara de la Sierra, all in the province of Cádiz. In Setenil, we see the threesome driving through the narrow streets, and the ridiculous fight scene took place in the picturesque Bar Alhambra.\n\nAlthough the film was made in Hindi for domestic consumption, the characters regularly punctuate their conversations with English words and expressions, which is our excuse for including the film here; that, and the possibility of attracting millions of wealthy Indian set-jetters to Spain. The film was brought to our attention by Gus.\n\nCheckout (2011)\n\nThis black comedy about ‘suicide tourism’ was shot in Sitges, Barcelona, the location of many interesting films since Errol Flynn shot there in the 50s.\n\nIt was made by afilm International Film Workshops.\n\nYolanda Torres, Producer/ Head of Studies of afilm informed us that the film centres on a guest house for suicides (the definitive check out), and one guest whose hesitation causes some concern to the landlady.\n\nThe guest house in question was the delightful Hotel Romantica, a beautiful, historic hotel in the old part of Sitges, which is full of noble mansions.\n\nRoad to Wacken (2011)\n\nWacken is a little town in Germany that is invaded each year by Heavy Metal fans for a rock festival.\n\nAragonese director Pablo Aragués made a film about an all girl band from Zaragoza that travels there to claim their fame and mix with the likes of Alice Cooper.\n\nApartment 143 (2011)\n\nProperty values will plummet in Barcelona, where this film about paranormal activity in a flat was made.\n\nWritten by Rodrigo Cortes, who directed ‘Buried’ and ‘Red Lights.’\n\nHaunted Poland (2011)\n\nA Spanish film with Spanish and Polish actors filmed in Polish and English, set in the USA and Poland although the opening scene was filmed in Girona, home of director Pau Masó.\n\nEvil forces are lurking in Poland, or maybe in childhood, or both.\n\nThose who feel more comfortable with it could call the film ‘Nawiedzona Polska.’\n\nThe Cold Light of Day (2012)\n\nA thriller starring Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver in which an American family is kidnapped during a holiday in Spain; something which almost never happens in reality all Americans may rest assured.\n\nVarious Spanish actors participated, including Simón Andreu as Pizarro, a policeman who threatens Willis.\n\nFilming began in early September 2010 on Cabo (Cape) La Nao near Jávea, Alicante, at the idyllic cove of Granadella, where actor Henry Cavill was to be found, surrounded by 100 extras, all trying hard to look as if they were enjoying themselves playing on the beach. Five power launches and a yacht were involved in filming upon the limpid blue Mediterranean waters of the Costa Blanca.\n\nIt was here that Henry swam ashore to visit a Chemist’s while his family was being kidnapped. The Chemist’s was actually quite a long way off, in the Plaça Sant Antoni in Denia, where Hollywood brought it all back home by filming briefly in the same square where ‘John Paul Jones’ was shot back in 1958.\n\nJust before the kidnapping, Henry’s family, headed by Bruce Willis, had suppered on a yacht in the Nautical Club of Moraira, filming of which took place on the 13th of September.\n\nFrom the marina we can see the 18th century castle on the beach, built to defend against Berber pirates.\n\nThe Madrid Film Office pulled out all the stops when the story switched to the capital for the bleaker scenes where Henry takes on the combined forces of Arab terrorists, Mossad and the CIA; no mean feat. A great number of the capital’s tourist attractions appear as Henry seeks to free his family.\n\nWe see the Puerta de Alcalá and the Cibeles fountain with its chariot towed by lions, carved in stone in order to prevent them from eating the horses.\n\nWillis meets with Sigourney Weaver in a square with the statue of a rearing horse. This was shot in the Plaza de Ramón y Cajál, in front of the Faculty of Medicine of the Complutense University. It is here that Bruce’s fee ran out and he was shot too.\n\nThe chase is on, with Henry sometimes chasing the baddies and sometimes being chased.\n\nHe reaches the Plaza Mayor, where a policeman is shot and he gets the blame, finally finding refuge in the American Embassy.\n\nHe makes his way to Diego Caldra’s house, actually a set built at the Ciudad de Luz studios in Alicante, where he teams up with Spanish actress Verónica Echegui. Weaver pursues them as they speed off on a scooter, sliding to a stop in front of the Delicias Railway Museum, housed in an old railway station in central Madrid.\n\nIn their search for Henry’s father and some answers they take the Madrid underground from the Pitis station, taking in the Puerta del Sol. After a shootout in an underground car park the chase is on again, passing the Puerta de Alcalá and ending up at Las Ventas bullring, where Weaver’s car tries to take the tube unsuccessfully.\n\nAt one point imagination is stretched when Verónica takes Henry to a leisure complex called Fabrik Espacio Multiuso, located between Moraleja and Fuenlabrada, where some of her friends happily help them out, beating up a professional killer as a favour, imagining no doubt that this ruthless assassin will just mutter “fair enough” and leave it at that.\n\nIt all ends happily ever after, and Bruce is hardly missed as the Mossad arrive ages before the Madrid police; which is a fairly common complaint in the capital.\n\nSaving Isis (2012)\n\nA post apocalyptic story of the relationship between mother and daughter, with filming in the province of Tarragona, specifically at Casa Castellarnau (for the decadent palatial scenes) and Pla de la Seu i Catedral; in fact we see a naked woman on the steps leading up to the cathedral, the cemetery and the subterranean tunnels of the Complex Educatiu de Tarragona.\n\nCasa Castellarnau, now the city’s history museum, is lucky enough to have a ghost. A young, sickly girl who lived there and was only allowed to play the piano, and still plays, long after her death.\n\nNevertheless, the action takes place in post-apocalyptic New Mexico.\n\nRed Lights (2012)\n\nAfter shooting ‘The Cold Light of Day’ with Bruce Willis in Spain in 2010, Sigourney Weaver returned in February 2011 with Robert de Niro in tow for another ‘lights’ film.\n\nSpanish Director Rodrigo Cortés obviously earned himself a lot of credit with ‘Buried’ (apparently the producers were delighted with the low budget, an inevitable consequence of filming practically the whole thing inside a coffin) and have since given him a few dollars more.\n\nScience and the supernatural battle it out in this film shot in Barcelona and Canada.\n\nOne of the locations in Barcelona was the Casino L’Alianca del Poble Nou at Rambla de Poble Nou in the north east area of the city in the municipality of Sant Martí de Provensals. The Casino was founded in 1868 and in the film is used for a theatre scene featuring 300 extras.\n\nOther scenes were filmed in the studios of TV3, the Catalan public TV channel, and at the Facultad de Económicas of the Universidad de Barcelona (UB).\n\nFilming also took place in the Teatre Musical, Teatre Tívoli in Barcelona, Cornellà, Sant Andreu de Llavaneres, El Prat de Llobregat and Sant Vicenç de Montalt.\n\nA Puerta Fria (2012)\n\nAlthough it’s a Spanish language film, it’s all about a businessman suffering the handicap of not speaking English. For this reason, Antonio Dechent needs the services of María Valverde in order to communicate with Mr. Battleworth, played by Nick Nolte.\n\nThe film is directed by Catalan Xavi Puebla and was shot entirely in Sevilla in the summer of 2011, with the Hotel Sevilla Center, Avenida De La Buhaira, 24, as the main location.\n\nThe Dictator (2012)\n\nAs the film is about an Arab dictator, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, Sevilla was chosen because of its Arabian architecture.\n\nOne of the dictator’s palaces is none other than the Plaza de España, also used for ‘Attack of the Clones’ and ‘Lawrence of Arabia.’\n\nOn Fuerteventura filming took place at Corralejo, Majanicho, Esquinzo and el Barranco de La Herradura, where the desert scenes were shot with the dictator on horseback and with goats. Self-explanatory.\n\nThe Zig Zag Kid (2012)\n\nIsabella Rosellini filmed the Spanish section of this Belgian film directed by Vincent Bal in the old Rio Tinto mines of Huelva.\n\nThe film is based on a novel by Israeli author David Grossman, and the makers constructed a large wooden house in the area known as Zarandas, which represents Moonberg in the film.\n\nThe film tells the story of a young boy’s journey from Haifa to Jerusalem and was filmed in English and Dutch.\n\nRio Tinto started exploiting the mines in 1873 and ceased operations in 1954. Today you can visit the mining museum, ride the steam train’s remaining 12 kilometres of track, visit the ‘typically English’ house of the mine’s General Manager or visit the Peña de Hierro mines.\n\nCloud Atlas (2012)\n\nFilming took place in Mallorca in September 2011 of this film by the Wachowski Brothers and Tom Twyker.\n\nOf the film’s six parts the ‘Big Island’ and ‘Pacific Islands’ stories were filmed in Mallorca.\n\nAt Sóller, Jim Broadbent takes the familiar tourist tram to the port where an 18th century ship was kept during production, and where at the seafront Hotel Esplendido, 40 rooms were taken over by the film crew.\n\nIt was at Sa Calobra beach, near Sóller, that the opening scene, when Adam Ewing meets Dr Henry Goose (Hanks), was filmed. The beach, at the end of Torrent Pareis, is reached by regular ferries or a torturous mountain road.\n\nTom Hanks is at one point seen on top of a Hawaiian mountain, which is in reality Puigmajor mountain, in the Serra de Tramuntana.\n\nA scene with fires in a slave village was shot next to the Hotel Formentor, a famous hotel in the eastern extreme of the island.\n\nHalle Berry was unfortunate enough to break a bone in her right foot during filming and was treated at the Miramar Private Clinic (Room 119 for all you serious fans!)\n\nWrath of the Titans (2012)\n\nLike its predecessor ‘Clash of Titans,’ Wrath’s exteriors were largely filmed in the Canary Islands, particularly on Tenerife and La Gomera.\n\nOnce again Liam Neeson and Sam Worthington star, joined by Ralph Fiennes as an especially melancholic Hades, no doubt depressed by the fact that the Greeks are losing their religion.\n\nAbades on the southern coast of Tenerife was the site of the village of Perseus at the beginning of the film and the first attack of the Chimera.\n\nNearby Los Desriscaderos, an area of dry gulleys and hills, was the spot chosen for the exterior of the labyrinth leading to Tartarus. Queen Andromeda’s first camp was built at Minas de San Jose, and the Mount of Idols was provided by Llano de Ucanca.\n\nIn the north west, Teno Rural Park, an eroded volcanic mountain next to coastal cliffs, provided the opening scene of Io’s seaside grave, where Perseus, Agenor, Andromeda and her soldiers board their ship, the Nomos, which later would drop anchor in front of the Los Gigantes cliffs, at the extreme west of the island.\n\nA second camera unit did some aerial photography of a five million year old volcano, Roque de Agando in nearby La Gomera island.\n\nThe Strange Case of Wilhelm Reich (2012)\n\nKlaus Maria Brandauer plays the controversial psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich during the last years of his life, and the Tabernas desert in Almería plays Arizona.\n\nAccording to Janine Michtner of Novotny Film Produktion, the petrol station scene towards the end of the film was shot at the restaurant and petrol station ‘Alfaro,’ Autovía A-92 Exit 376 – Tabernas, and the desert scenes, where Reich is seen experimenting with his family, starting in the film’s second scene, at Finca Tecisa.\n\nDeranged (2012)\n\nShot near Madrid and starring Londoner Craig Fairbrass, this horror flick tells the story of four attractive British girls staying at a friend’s place in rural Spain.\n\nThe location of the house is actually a rural hotel called La Tejera de Lozoya, located on the M635 road from Gargantilla to Navarredonda at the edge of the Guadarrama mountains.\n\nNearby, on the road between Rascafría and Lozoya, is the restaurant El Tascón, where Fairbrass hands over the keys of hell to the girls. Sorry; is that a spoiler?\n\nDancing Dogs (2012)\n\nThe trainees at afilm International Film Workshops produced this movie, in which their native Sitges, Barcelona plays a key role.\n\nThe Hotel Romantic, Carrer de Sant Isidre 33, was again a location, representing Elizabeta’s home.\n\nAlso featured are the El Prado theatre, Carrer de Francesc Gumà, 6, where the sisters are forced to dance, and the streets and beaches of the town. The film ends at the Avinguda de Balmins beach, where the dead sister’s ashes are finally scattered.\n\nAt Cami de Santa Bárbara, Lily and River miss the bus, and they are kidnapped at a farmhouse at Vallpineda.\n\nInvader (2012)\n\nA film about right, wrong and Iraq.\n\nThe Iraq scenes were shot in the Canary Islands at Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, where Arrefice was transformed into an Iraqui town, while the Spanish scenes were shot in Galicia on the cliffs of A Coruña, and in its port and prom, with Pablo’s house located in Betanzos.\n\nThe dialogue is in Spanish, English and Arabic, and the director is Daniel Calparsoro.\n\nMiami II Ibiza (2012)\n\nFocusing more on disco strobe lights than the limpid blues of Ibiza’s sea and sky, this musical comedy charts the rise of a new DJ called DJ Hound as he makes it with a little help from some real life DJ friends.\n\nIbiza: My Way or the Highway (2012)\n\nA film that is almost a documentary, but not quite, and which is a homage to not only the nightlife, but also the coves, caves and light that is Ibiza.\n\nOn a more serious note, the film deals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.\n\nAnimals (2012)\n\nA curious film made by the Catalan director Marcel Fores, but with some British actors such as Martin Freeman from ‘The Office,’ playing a teacher at a bi-lingual school where main character, Pol, has a disturbing relationship with his English speaking Teddy bear.\n\nThe school is in fact the Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona and the exteriors were also in Catalonia, where there really are bi-lingual schools, so I suppose the whole teddy bear thing is also fairly believable.\n\nIncluded in the locations are Sant Llorenç de Morunys and Pantà de la Llosa del Cavall, Lleida, which is the reservoir.\n\nAlso used were Sant Esteve de Palautordera, Barcelona and El Port de la Selva, Girona.\n\nThe Corpse Grinders 3 (2012)\n\nOnly 40 years later the third part of this American denouncement of the cat food industry reached the silver screen thanks to Spanish director Manolo ‘Motosierra,’ (which means ‘chainsaw’ and might not actually be his real name).\n\nTed V. Mikel made the original in 1971, and for the third part the director brought some much needed work to his native Alcoy in the province of Alicante.\n\nThe old industrial area of El Molinar, a veterinary clinic in El Terrer and an old building in Calle San Francisco, were used for interiors, while exteriors were filmed in the village of Planes.\n\nThings We Do for Love (2012)\n\nA Portuguese man has to choose between love and home, so, rather than toss a coin, he goes on the road, touring Europe with a discrete film crew, calling on Granada, Sevilla, Madrid and San Sebastián in Guipúzcoa.\n\nThe Sleeper Effect (2012)\n\nThis dystopian vision of the future was mainly filmed in the UK, but with some shooting also done in Marbella, Málaga, a kind of dream sequence involving a supermarket, a beach, a bar and a car park, which, like the rest of the film, I didn’t really understand.\n\nPrometheus (2012)\n\nRidley Scott continued his ‘Alien’ theme making use of the 130 by 95 metre water tank at the Ciudad de la Luz studios in Alicante, where he spent 3 months filming at the end of 2011.\n\nStranger Within (2013)\n\nWilliam Baldwin stars in this Danish production shot mostly in the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range in Mallorca, especially the area between Sóller and Deià. The cliffs and coves of the island were especially praised by the director.\n\nThe Gran Hotel in the village of Sóller featured, and the city of Palma pretends to be Manhattan in one curious fabrication.\n\nThe Wine of Summer (2013)\n\nNear the beginning, Carl, an elderly writer is listening to a man on a balcony paying the trumpet while seated at a bar in Plaza San Felipe Neri, Barcelona, a location used in various films. Later he is joined there by Elsa Patakay.\n\nThey go to watch an awful play in Teatre Tarantana, which is a real theatre and the real name, situated in Carrer de les Flors, 22.\n\nElsa Pataky produces and stars in this film featuring Marcia Gay Harden and Ethan Peck, grandson of Gregory Peck, who arrives, rucksack on back at Barcelona’s airport, with its Miró mural, and then at Franca station, in search of that elusive something.\n\nWe see some rapid sights of Barcelona’s Gothic quarter and then Peck is exiting Hotel Adagio, Carrer de Ferran, 21, which is also real.\n\nOn to a church, and then the Canuda bookshop, where he spots Carl, and they return to Plaza San Felipe Neri for a drink.\n\nThrough the medieval streets of Girona, Peck wanders around with the playwright, and some locations from Game of Thrones and Perfume are easily recognisable, such as the cathedral steps.\n\nEl Parrigur, where the five main characters go for some music, is also real, and can be found at Carrer del Pas de l’Ensenyança, 2.\n\nSpook (2013)\n\nDutch musician and film maker Aldous Byron Clarkson found his haunted house at Beniarbeig, Alicante. The old mansión is in fact the 19th century Casa Santonja, now available for weddings and other natural events.\n\nFor some mellow marsh he used nearby Pego, a coastal wetland where rice is also grown to make the famous Valencian paella.\n\nXàbia and Benicolet were also employed.\n\nThe Nowhere Son (2013)\n\nThis Indian film about corruption and violence in that country was shot all over the world, including Madrid, and was directed by San Benarje.\n\nGrand Piano (2013)\n\nThe film was made in Las Palmas in Gran Canaria, and Barcelona; the old hospital, now film studios at the Parc Audiovisual de Catalunya in Terrassa was used to reconstruct the concert hall in Chicago.\n\nThe film stars John Cusack and Elijah Wood and deals with a pianist (Wood) who suffers from stage fright, although he finds Cusack scarier than a harmless stage.\n\nThe Fast and the Furious 6 (2013)\n\nVin Diesel stars in the sixth part of the saga. In an age when petrol is running out fast, it makes sense to flog a dead horse I suppose.\n\nAmong the international locations is Tenerife, with filming around Santa Cruz de Tenerife and the port of Santa Cruz taking place in September 2012.\n\nFilming also took place on Gran Canaria, on the G2 motorway, under construction at the time, in the section between El Pagador and Santa María de Guía, in the northern part of the island. One of Spain’s highest viaducts, the Puente (bridge) de Silva, seduced the producers with its spectacular views.\n\nThe Counselor (2013)\n\nBrad and Cameron bring on the Hollywood attraction, while Javier and Penelope offer home grown talent for yet another Ridley Scott Spanish movie, filmed in Pego, Elche, Alicante, as well as Cañada de Albatana, the vineyards of Termino de Arriba on the outskirts of Jumilla in Murcia province, and in the Badlands of Bardenas Reales Natural park in Navarra, which simulates the border between Mexico and the USA. Here filming took place around the military base and an area known as Castildeterra, with the main actors and crew staying at the Hotel Aire de Bardenas.\n\nIn the city of Alicante the Town Hall (including its colonial façade and square) was transformed for a day into the courthouse of Ciudad Juárez, while the waste processing plant at Fontcalent was used for a scene where a dead body is found.\n\nIn Alicante’s Calle Ángel Lozano, a scene was shot involving Michael Fassbender and Javier Bardem in front of a lingerie shop.\n\nThe luxury mansión with sea views can be found at the Monte Pego estate, full of villas.\n\nThe Macabre Ayahuasca Hammer Experience (2013)\n\nThe 14 weeks of filming took place at various locations in the Valencia Community, although the key location was the 13th century monastery of San Jeroni at Alfahuir near Gandia, where the horror unfolds.\n\nFilming took place at Burriana and Morella (both in Castellón province), and Alicante, Alcoy and Jávea (all in Alicante province), with studio work at the Ciudad de la Luz, Alicante.\n\nSome filming was also done in Mallorca, at Palma and Cala Sa Ponsa.\n\nDirector Aldous Byron Clarkson returned to Spain in Spring 2012, after making ‘Spook’ in Alicante province.\n\nMindscape (2013)\n\nA psychological thriller from Jorge Dorado filmed in Barcelona, at l’Hospital Clínic, for the scenes where Anna recovers from an attack, and at Col·legi d’Advocats, whose multi-level library represents the private school where Anna studies before her contretemps with some other students (who deserve what they get).\n\nThe Parque Natural del Montseny provides some scenery for driving and chasing young girls through the woods, and the studios of Parc Audiovisual de Catalunya, Terrassa were used for interiors.\n\nThe international cast includes Mark Strong, Taissa Farmiga and Brian Cox.\n\nWax (2013)\n\nAuthor and cinema expert Victor Matellano directed his first full length feature film, ‘Wax’ in 2012 at locations such as Girona, where filming took place at the Sa Conca, Platja D’Aro, a beach well known to film makers, where ‘The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad’ and ‘Nicholas and Alexandra’ were shot, and where in ‘Wax,’ Mike shoots himself and his wife and son with his own camera.\n\nIn Barcelona the quaint old Waxwork Museum played its role, for example in an early scene where the director of the museum Mister Jarrod, in a wheelchair, explains about the security cameras in the area dedicated to Bonnie and Clyde robbing a bank. In fact the décor is real, as the museum was originally the Banco de Crédito y Docks.\n\nA reporter stands in front of a prison where the evil Doctor Knox is held. It is in fact the Modelo Prison of Barcelona, now a cultural centre, but which functioned as a prison from 1904 to 2017. It was here that Salvador Puig Antich was the last person in Spain to be executed by the garrot on 2nd March 1974.\n\nMálaga provided the exterior of the house featured in the same news report on Doctor Knox, at the Señorío de Lepanto estate, a location habitually used as a cheerier venue for weddings.\n\nMike recalls his wife on the beach again and then the 100 year old Raluy Circus, in Paseo de Colón in the port, provides some ambience.\n\nThe funeral dream sequence was shot at Monte de Valdelatas, a popular picnicking area near Alcobendas, Madrid.\n\nThe reporter approaches the entrance of the Museu de Cera and goes inside, where she finds Mike.\n\nThe Madrid Waxworks Museum was also used for other scenes in which a journalist has to spend a night in the museum.\n\nThe international cast included the legendary Geraldine Chaplin of ‘Doctor Zhivago’ fame, and a special appearance by Paul Naschy, who was deceased at the time; a very clever achievement.\n\nAnother legend who participated was costume designer Yvonne Blake, collaborator on an endless number of films such as ‘Robin and Marian,’ ‘The Three Musketeers’ or ‘Presence of Mind,’ all made in Spain.\n\nYou couldn’t wish to meet a nicer person than Victor Matellano; just don’t let him inside your head!\n\nOpen Windows (2013)\n\nFrodo comes to Madrid, but his mission is more sinister in this thriller directed by Nacho Vigalondo, a Cantabrian director shooting his first feature in English.\n\nFilming took place in a steel factory in an industrial estate in Getafe; not a great location for set jetters really.\n\nElijah Wood took advantage of being in Spain to shoot two films here; the other one being ‘Grand Piano.’\n\nPanzer Chocolate (2013)\n\nAnother Spanish production filmed in English and including international stars such as Geraldine Chaplin.\n\nParque Natural del Montseny, Vilanova I la Geltrú, the Mas Viver de Torrebonica in Terrassa and the city of Barcelona are among the locations of the story of hidden Nazi treasures in the Pyrenees.\n\nThe film makes use of new technologies, allowing the audience to choose a different ending. Would that they had thought of that for ‘Doctor Zhivago!’\n\nThe film opens situating us in Barcelona with a view of the twin towers, Torre Mapfre and Hotel Arts.\n\nKid Gloves (2013)\n\nThe story of a young boxer and his father/trainer, with some scenes shot in Palma de Mallorca, which represents Cuba.\n\nA Long Way Down (2013)\n\nPierce Brosnan visited Mallorca to film this version of the Nick Hornby novel about four hapless suicide candidates who make a non-suicide pact.\n\nFilming took place in Camp de Mar near Andrax, where the interiors of the Hotel Playa were used, as was the beach and a beach bar called La Illeta. These scenes in Mallorca represent the Canary Islands, while Mallorca’s Son San Joan airport represents Heathrow.\n\nLeaving Hotel Romantic (2013)\n\nFilmed entirely in the appropriately named hotel in Sitges, near Barcelona, a guest’s death starts the ball rolling in this thriller made by students of the afilm International Film Workshop school.\n\nAnother Me (2013)\n\nIsabel Coixet is one of a new generation of Spanish directors who have begun to make successful English language films mixing the best of Spain with American and British actors.\n\nAmong the actors in this psychological drama were Sophie Turner, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Rhys Ifans and Geraldine Chaplin\n\nAlthough mainly filmed in Wales, some studio scenes were shot at Parc Audiovisual de Catalunya Studios, Terrassa, Barcelona and some swimming pool scenes at Club Natacio, Terrassa, Barcelona.\n\nMama (2013)\n\nA horror film directed by Argentinian Andrés Muschietti and produced by Benito del Toro. Andrés, who lives in Barcelona, first made a short, filming in a house with a spiral staircase in Barcelona, before making the full length film, which was largely shot in Canada, although some studio work was done in Barcelona.\n\nA horror film starring horrible children.\n\nAfflicted (2013)\n\nVampire problems mess up a Euro trip for two friends, Derek and Cliff, who travel to Italy and Paris, setting off from Barcelona, cam recorder in hand. Big mistake.\n\nThe first thing we see in the city is the Barceloneta beach, with the two Port Olímpic skyscrapers and the Frank Gehry golden fish statue in the background.\n\nDerek and Cliff are first seen in the Plaza del Portal de la Pau del moll de les Drassanes, with the Columbus statue standing out.\n\nFinally we see them preparing their yellow convertible in the Plaza del Duc de Medinaceli.\n\nA Night in Old Mexico (2013)\n\nEmilio Aragón, a Spanish comedian and actor tries his hand at directing Robert Duvall, who plays a cantankerous (who’d have him any other way?) old Texas rancher, forced off his ranch, who then decides to take a last, wild car journey to Mexico with a newly acquired grandson.\n\nA few background shots from the cars were done in Madrid, although the film was shot in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nThe World (2013)\n\nWith today’s technology anybody can make a film; and here, anybody just did.\n\nA very home made movie, obviously with a lot of help from his friends, and telling the story of a chess piece and time travel, when a young traveller briefly visits Barcelona through a whirlpool in his California supermarket.\n\nWe see the Sagrada Familia cathedral, the Boqueria market, Plaza Reial and La Rambla before returning to California.\n\nEncontrados en NYC (2013)\n\nA Spanish film in which some friends from Sevilla visit New York, which means that they have to speak English at some point, although not in a NY cab.\n\nIn Sevilla the Guadalquivir river appears quite a bit, as does the university.\n\nThe Liberator (2013)\n\nFrom the tiny Basque village of Bolibar, Simon Bolivar’s ancestors set out for the new world. The Liberator tells his story in this film in Spanish, French (which he spoke) and English (which he didn’t).\n\nBolivar besieges and conquers the South American city of Valencia, although the market in which he fights was in reality in Jeréz, in the province of Cádiz. A bloody battle takes place in the Plaza del Mercado to conquer Valencia.\n\nThe horses were provided by the Real Escuela Andaluza del Arte Ecuestre, who also provided the anecdote when two steeds escaped during the shooting.\n\nOn the beach he fights another battle, upon the endless sands of Zahara de los Atunes.\n\nThe city of Carmona in Sevilla represents Valencia too.\n\nFilming also took place in Segovia, where the Plaza de la Trinidad was transformed into a market, and the royal gardens of La Granja de San Idelfonso provided some classy backdrops for Bolivar’s alleged badminton match with a Prince.\n\nThe Andes mountains were ably portrayed by Granada’s Sierra Nevada, while the drawbridge of Chinchón’s castle gets a cameo as Bolivar rushes across it as hurriedly as he rushed all over the continent, and Alcalá de Henares in Madrid provided some authentic street scenes, offering Calle Bedel for our pleasure.\n\nPaper, Scissors, Stone (2013)\n\nThe film begins in Manchester, England, England, but then moves across the Mediterranean Sea to Almería.\n\nAfter touching down at Almería’s international airport, a number of ranches, known locally as ‘Cortijos’ are employed, such as Cortijo El Coto at Velez-Blanco, and Cortijo Venturillo at María.\n\nThe astounding beauty of Cabo de Gata, where beach scenes were shot at La Isleta del Moro, also makes its presence known in a story of three old friends who reunite in Spain, but each bringing their own unwanted baggage.\n\nViolet (2013)\n\nLike the character in the film, Alex, director Luiso Berdejo moved from Spain to California.\n\nIn this story Alex seeks a woman in a photo and ends up finding his grandfather.\n\nThe Spanish scenes were shot in Luiso’s native San Sebastián, Gipuzcoa.\n\nTasting Menu (2013)\n\nThe clientele of a famous restaurant are from various countries, and so various languages are used, including English.\n\nThe restaurant is closing and everyone want to be present at the final supper.\n\nFilmed at Empúries, Girona, the real restaurant was l’hostal Empúries.\n\nThe Cosmonaut (2013)\n\nThis dreamy sci-fi story with echoes of 2001 and Solaris was filmed by Nicolás Alcalá, who informed us that “we shot a good bunch of ambient shots in the north of Spain, mostly in Galicia and some in Asturias; cliffs and empty beaches and forests; landscapes mostly and some dreamy shots. Some ended up in the film, some ended up in the collateral 35 short films that complemented the movie.\n\nWe also shot all the scenes in which the cosmonaut is inside a spacecraft and on the Moon in a studio in Madrid. Most of them were used in a couple of the short films and some in the film.”\n\nThe Extraordinary Tale of the Times Table (2013)\n\nAn interesting film with an amazing performance by Aïda Ballmann. Directed by José F. Ortuño and Laura Alvea, and filmed over a period of two weeks in a studio at Cora del Rio, Sevilla, the film, described as a macabre fairy tale, shows the danger of taking pen-pals too seriously.\n\nNew York Shadows (2013)\n\nA Spanish film that takes place in Madrid and New York in English and Spanish, about a film producer who travels to the Big Apple to plan his next movie and encounters emotional problems with a woman.\n\nVivir es fácil con los ojos cerrados (2013)\n\nAlthough the film is shot in Spanish, the theme could not be more English; The Beatles, and specifically John Lennon, who made How I Won the War with Richard Lester in Almería, and where English teacher Javier Cámera seeks him out in a Road Trip movie that concludes with a recording in English that does in fact sound a lot like Lennon.\n\nThe title is a translation of a line from Strawberry Fields: Living is Easy with Eyes Closed, a song written by Lennon during his Almeria sojourn, inspired by a bit of homesickness and possibly by the fact that the entrance to the villa he rented, now a cinema museum with a section dedicated to him, looks a bit like what the entrance to the Strawberry Field orphanage used to look like before it was also turned into a museum.\n\nJavier’s journey begins in Madrid, before continuing at La Almadraba de Monteleva, next to the famous salt lakes and church Las Salinas by Cabo de Gata, Almería, where the bar and guest house are located, Desierto de Tabernas, for the scenes where Lennon’s film is being shot, as well as the beach at Playazo de Rodalquilar, Níjar.\n\nApart from the final scene where Javier talks to Lennon, based on a true story apparently, the opening scene is a news programme in English about the Beatles and Lennon’s trip to Almería, followed by Javier teaching an English lesson using the lyrics to ‘Help’.We also hear English when Javier listens to Radio Luxembourg, when he rehearses his meeting with Lennon and when he has an altercation with Lennon’s wife Cynthia.\n\nBlue Lips (2014)\n\nSix characters from six cities with six directors, but with everything converging on the San Fermín bull running festival in Pamplona, Navarra.\n\nBuenos Aires, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro and Matera, Italy are the runners up to Pamplona with familiar locations including the Town Hall square, the bullring and the Caballo Blanco restaurant, filmed during 2012’s San Fermin festival.\n\n10,000 km (2014)\n\nSergi and Alex are happy in Barcelona, but when she is offered a job in Los Angeles, their relationship has to survive through video conferences.\n\nNevertheless, her LA apartment scenes were filmed in a flat in Barcelona’s Gràcia neighbourhood.\n\nExodus: Gods and Kings (2014)\n\nChristian Bale adds a certain sex appeal to the role of Moses, played more intensely by Charlton Heston many parted seas ago.\n\nRidley Scott once again turned the deserts of Almería into the promised land for this promising return to epics.\n\nThe desert of Tabernas became Sinai, while at Cautivo de Tabernas, where part of ‘Lawrence of Arabia’ was filmed, the scenes of the burning bushes were shot, and the great battle scene, elephants included, was shot at Llanura de Búho.\n\nThe battle in question is supposed to be that of Kadesh, fought in 1274 BC. As in Kingdom of Heaven, Scott distorts history. Rameses II was in fact Pharoah by then, his father Seti long dead, and Moses, was nowhere to be seen.\n\nHuge sets were set up at El Chorillo, Pechina in the Sierra Alhamila mountains, and at Macael we can find the quarries where the Jews are abused by their Egyptian masters. Macael’s marble quarries have been in use since Phoenician times.\n\nWhen we drive up towards the Sierra Alhamilla spa, below us to the right we see an avenue of palm trees and various abandoned buildings. The site began as a mining location and the sets were later constructed by Scott for his film.\n\nIt is here, with a fair bit of CGI, that we can see the avenue of palms as Moses arrives in Pithom to inspect the works, meet Ben Kingsley and discover his own true identity.\n\nOn Fuerteventura, the white sand of the beach at Risco del Paso, Sotavento, was digitally joined to other beaches at Marrajo and El Cotillo for the spectacular scenes where the Red Sea opens, with far better special effects than Charlton Heston had available for his version of the story made back in 1956.\n\nScott set up shop at the old Parador of Playa Blanca, now a hotel, from where he directed the massive logistics.\n\nOn the Peninsula of Jandía, at the south west extreme of the island, all kinds of animals, 500 crew and 400 local extras accompanied Moses on his Exodus.\n\nBuen Paso became Madian, where the wedding of Moses takes place, whereas the scene showing the coronation of Ramese II, originally planned for London, was finally filmed at La Caldereta, a village belonging to La Oliva on Fuerteventura.\n\nTraces of Sandalwood (2014)\n\nSet in Barcelona and Mumbai, an Indian girl looks for her lost sister in a film made in English, Hindi and Catalan by the Catalan director María Ripoll.\n\nAmong the locations in Barcelona are Parque Güell, where Mina enjoys the view after arriving in the city looking for Sita/Paula.\n\nOn the rooftop of La Pedrera Sita attends a cocktail party after discovering she was adopted.\n\nIn Port Vell Paula wanders and chats with her new Indian friend from the video club, Prakash, who takes her for an Indian meal at the Veg World restaurant.\n\nMina is staying at the beachside tower, the Hotel Arts, which we see from inside and out, while Paula works in the Center for Regenerative Medicine (Parc de Recerca Biomedica).\n\nAfter visiting her parents’ villa, which is Casa Margara in Valldoreix, Paula returns to the city on the Funicular de Vallvidrera.\n\nA Perfect Day (2014)\n\nTim Robbins and Benicio de Toro star in this black comedy, where the small Sierra Nevada mining village of Alquife, Granada becomes Kosovo during the civil war, and a corpse in a well gets what they call a bit part. The mines, recently reactivated, used to be the most important iron extraction operation in Europe. Today they have the kind of hole that film makers love, although the actual filming took place at the abandoned houses just outside the restricted area.\n\nScenes for Kosovo were filmed at Fuente del Hervidero in the Sierra Nevada National Park.\n\nIn Cuenca they took over an abandoned hotel, the Claridge, on the old main road from Valencia to Madrid at kilometre 187 near the Alarcón reservoir. Both the exteriors and the interiors served as the United Nations base, where they go after picking up the boy in need of a football. Today the building serves as a canvas for graffiti artists.\n\nThe Spanish director, Fernando León de Aranoa, and his stars stayed at the Hotel Palacio ‘Villa de Alarcón’ between the 17th and the 25th of May. The hilltop medieval village of Alarcón, with a small Parador castle, deserves a film of its own.\n\nLet the Die Be Cast: Initium (2014)\n\nTwo brothers are cast adrift in a post apocalyptic world, where they confront an evil philosopher.\n\nAlmería is a pretty good place to imagine the end of the world, although there are no cowboys around as our heroes visit the famous beach at Mónsul, Cabo de Gata, where Sean Connery fought the seagulls in ‘Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,’ or Santuario del Saliente, Albox, for the church scene.\n\nTabernas is always a good place if you’re looking for a photogenic desert, whereas the well scene was shot at the Torre García beach at Cabo de Gata.\n\nEl Marchal, Lubrin, provided the shack, and Cariatiz, Sorbas the girl’s house.\n\nThe ruined bridge was at Santa Bárbara, Huercal Overa, while the rockpool was at Turre.\n\nTahal provided the location for the new village, whereas Marchalico Viñicas was the old one. The almond grove was at the inappropriately named Los Castaños.\n\nOnce again Almería proves to be a striking contrast to the green fields of Oxfordshire where the boys start out.\n\nTwice upon a Time in the West (2014)\n\nKind of truth meets sort of fiction as Claudia Cardinale returns to Almería, and the Western Leone western township at Tabernas for a parody of her role in Sergio Leone’s ‘Once Upon a Time in the West.’\n\nThis time it’s Bulgarian director Boris Despodov calling the shots, with some inappropriate Tchaikovsky music.\n\nThe action begins when Pepe Fonda, who claims to be the illegitimate son of Henry (in real life not in the film) recalls Fonda’s role in Once Upon a Time in the West, in a film within a film shot at the Western Leone township with the almost mythical McBain ranch and the West Bank, both of which can still be seen there today.\n\nThe shootout takes place there in the saloon.\n\nWhen Claudia and Maria drive down to the beach, they are of course at La Almadraba de Monteleva, next to the famous salt lakes and church Las Salinas by Cabo de Gata.\n\nThe film ends with a parade during the annual Tabernas Western Film Festival.\n\nSix Bullets to Hell (2014)\n\nNow here’s a storyline we haven’t heard before in a western; a woman is murdered and her husband, an ex-gunslinger who had renounced his pistols, takes them up again to exact revenge. In order to drag the story out he has the original idea of hunting them down one by one!\n\nAnthropologists say that the pistol is a phallic symbol, but what do they know?\n\nOnce again the authentic American desert of Tabernas in Almería comes into its own and the western townships of Fort Bravo and Parque Oasys see some real action uncluttered by tourists.\n\nSeve the Movie (2014)\n\nThe story of Severino Ballesteros, the great Spanish golf player, is told in his native Cantabria, and particularly at Comillas and Santander, and the golf course at Pedreña, where Seve learnt to play, and where filming took place between 23rd September and 12th October 2013.\n\nAloft (2014)\n\nFilmed mostly in Canada and Madrid, where the scenes of the children underwater at the end were shot in a swimming pool, this story of a mother separated from her daughter was filmed in English and French by Peruvian director Claudia Llosa.\n\nThe Afterglow (2014)\n\nThis movie was made by students and staff at the afilm school in Sitges.

What?\n\nA view of the city from Collserola, and the Telefónica del Fòrum building, and inevitably a quick shot of the Sagrada Familia cathedral begin the Barcelona section.\n\nScenes from this thriller were shot in the streets of Barcelona; specifically Rambla de Catalunya and Calle de Valencia in the summer of 2013.\n\nOther locations used were the arches of Plaça Reial, the Tibidabo fairground above the city (where Penn arranges to meet Terrance Cox, although the Aquarium, in whose bowels a lot of shooting takes place, is nowhere nearby).\n\nThe film makers had a problem when they wanted to film some scenes at Barcelona’s Monumental bullring, as bullfighting is no longer allowed in Catalonia. They were not permitted to use real bulls and so the bullfighting was provided by the San Isidro Fair of Madrid. It is at the bullring that Penn tries to negotiate the release of his kidnapped girlfriend and has to take out three unethical gunmen, while the bull evened up the score by taking out the main villain.\n\nFilming also took place at Caldes d’Estrach, specifically in the castle of Can Jalpí, Arenys de Munt in the Maresme district, and Penn slept in the Hotel L’Arts.\n\nThe Rezort (2015)\n\nI’d always thought that the last resort was Benidorm. However, according to the news broadcast map, it’s the Canary Islands where zombie safaris take place, although the island scenes were actually shot in Mallorca.\n\nA Steve Barker horror film, a kind of ‘Jurrasic Park’ for zombies, but with real weapons. The would be hunters come ashore on the island at Cala Tuent, situated near Sóller.\n\nThe abandoned military barracks at Son Busquets was used for some of the chase scenes, where the zombies were tied up for shooting; until they weren’t!\n\nThe group that camped out among the stars saw the reservoir at Cúber, just inland from Sóller among Mallorca’s emblematic Tramuntana mountains.\n\nLater they escaped through the forest around the Formentor peninsula.\n\nNever Let Go (2015)\n\nA woman’s baby is snatched while she is on holiday, and she does everything physically possible to get it back.\n\nWriter/Director Howard J Ford informed that around 30-40% of the film was shot in Spain, including the opening sequence that used a rented villa, Casa Moleve, situated at Montroy just outside Valencia.\n\nThe other Spanish sequences were shot in Palma, Mallorca, and most of the film in Morocco, although in many cases Morocco was Spain.\n\nAn old Guardia Civil barracks, now the Museu del Calçat I de la Pell, was used as a Moroccan police station. The building, inaugurated in 1915, became a museum in 2010.\n\nA fight scene with a van was shot in C/General Luque at Inca.\n\nThe fight with the first kidnapper and van accident took place at Puig de San Pere, a neighbourhood of Palma, as did the taxi theft and chase, specifically in Plaza Drassanes, while the internet café was in the Barrio Son Gotleu.\n\nThe Police road block in the mountains was at Llucmajor village.\n\nHoward added that the Spanish sequences were the nicest to shoot, assisted by Mallorca Specials and he regretted not shooting more of the film in Spain. The original intention had been to return to film at several Sergio Leone locations, but budget limitations made that inviable.\n\nOur thanks to Production Manager Joan Fontanet and Claudia Joest for their help with the Mallorca locations.\n\nThe Hunting of the Snark (2015)\n\nAlthough it is a stop motion film, made in a London studio, it uses some real scenery, such as the white cliffs of Dover, and a beach, that of Lloret de Mar in Girona, perhaps to save the artists drawing all those waves. The same thing happened with the cartoon version of ‘Lord of the Rings,’ using Belmonte castle.\n\nLawrence Mallinson of The Third Story Productions Limited told us that the Lloret filming was “mostly close-ups of waves lapping against the beach and the rocks and some views of the horizon out to sea.” He added: “It was just an opportunistic grabbing of a few shots as we had taken a short break there as a belated honeymoon, and given that it was February the beaches were deserted, we got the shots that you are not able to get on the English coast at any time of year.”\n\nIn the Heart of the Sea (2015)\n\nRon Howard brings us his version of ‘Moby Dick,’ with Herman Melville as a character this time and telling the true story of the ‘Essex,’ inspiration of the book.\n\nLike John Huston’s version starring Gregory Peck, some of the sea scenes were shot in the Canary Islands, although this time just off Lanzarote at Yaiza, where beach scenes were filmed at El Golfo, with its beachside crater, and around the tiny island of La Gomera, at Alajeró, on the south coast, with additional filming at Playa Santiago at Tapahuga, where rain stopped play.\n\nThe islands represent the coast of Ecuador where the shipwrecked Essex crew washed up.\n\nAt Playa Santiago, Ron and the crew lodged at the Gran Hotel Tecina.\n\nJupiter Ascending (2015)\n\nThe makers of ‘Matrix’, the Wachowskis, were in Bilbao, Vizcaya, in May 2014, taking advantage of the futuristic Guggenheim Museum for their latest film, although they fast forwarded on the futurization, digitally remastering both the museum and La Salve and Zubuzuri bridges and Torre de Iberdrola to represent a city on another planet, where the Abrasax siblings chat about life, the universe and everything’s theirs after the harvest, to quote Neil Young..\n\nSean Bean and Terry Gilliam are among the stars of this sci-fi movie about a girl destined for great things. The film however is destined for obscurity, being another deluge of special effects in absence of a plot, characters or a point. ‘Casablanca’ it ain’t.\n\nTomorrowland (2015)\n\nGeorge Clooney is the star of this Walt Disney story filmed in Canada and Valencia, in the latter case at the emblematic, architectural blockbuster, The City of Arts and Sciences (CACS), where filming took place in January 2014 with Clooney and co-star Hugh Laurie lodged at the police stables turned hotel, The Westin.\n\nCACS is often hard to recognise, but there are four points when we can identify the sci-fi architecture of Valencian Santiago Calatrava.\n\nWhen Britt Robertson (Casey) finally reaches the city across the wheatfield, she finds herself there.\n\nAfter the train ride, the CACS is also recognisable, especially the façade of the Science Museum.\n\nWhen the spaceship escapes Earth and crashes into the CACS, we see the planet in ruins.\n\nWhen Clooney (Frank) crashes into a lake, after destroying the evil machine at the end of the film, we see the first-built building of the complex, the domed Hemisferic, a 3D cinema, where Tomorrowland was premiered.\n\nClooney was kept under wraps in Valencia, but he was spotted at the Lambrusqueria Italian restaurant in C/ Conde Altea (the big table on the left as you go in).\n\nNobody Wants the Night (2015)\n\nSpanish director Isabel Coixet directed Juliette Binoche, Rinko Kikuchi and Gabriel Byrne in a menage a trois with the North Pole to calm the passions.\n\nAlthough mostly filmed in Norway, shooting inside the igloo took place in the slightly warmer ambience of Tenerife, (where else?) making use of the dockside Plató del Atlantico studios.\n\nDon’t Speak (2015)\n\nHorror on the glorious beaches of the Costa Brava as a group of youngsters find out that they would prefer to forget what they did last summer.\n\nThey come ashore from their holiday boat and explore the old fishermen’s houses at Cala S’Alguer, Girona. Then the problems begin.\n\nTaken 3 (2015)\n\nOlivier Megaton directs a film written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, which could quite possibly take off where Taken 2 landed. It once again stars Liam Neeson, who during the summer of 2014 was shooting in Murcia and Alicante provinces.\n\nIn Murcia the airport of San Javier was a location, as it was for ‘Green Zone,’ representing this time not Baghdad but Santa Monica, for the film’s climax when Neeson’s car stops a plane from taking off. This was made possible thanks to the Spanish airforce, owners of the airfield, reminding everyone of the golden days of Samuel Bronston, when the Spanish armed forces spent more time making films than defending the frontiers.\n\nA road was cut off to traffic between Cartagena and Isla Plana and La Azohía so that car chase sequences could be filmed on the RM-E22 road, when Neeson is following Stuart on his way to Malibu in the film, and is attacked.\n\nIn Alicante province, filming took place near Jávea at Cala (Cove) de Ambolo, where a rather shabby boat house was constructed for a scene where Neeson tortures Stuart, pouring petrol over his face.\n\nIt’s estimated that the production contributed a million euros to the local economy.\n\nSweet Home (2015)\n\nThis horror film directed by Rafa Martínez was shot in a deserted building in the district of Sant Martí, on the corner of Calle Wellington, which once housed soldiers and their families in Barcelona, and explains why you shouldn’t make out in an abandoned house.\n\nThe building was close to Barcelona Zoo, although the animals didn’t make it onto the soundtrack.\n\nShadows in the Distance (2015)\n\nOrlando Bosch, a director from Buñol, Valencia, living in Berlin, directs a film about an Italian radio personality who meets a German bookshop employee, with scenes in Berlin, Poland and Valencia, where the beach and streets of the city feature, but not Buñol, famous for its tomato throwing festival and its Masonic cemetery.\n\nValencia contributes some blue seas to contrast with grey Berlin, and the Flamenco scenes with the guitarist Javier Zamora and the dancer Marta Sol.\n\nGerman, Italian, Spanish and English are the film’s languages and professionals from six countries worked on this most European of movies.\n\nThe Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2015)\n\nThe follow up, with Richard Gere included, to ‘The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel’ features Marbella, Málaga, at the Hotel Meliá Don Pepe, and the road between Málaga and Marbella where the opening scenes were shot, as well as Almería.\n\nDev Patel and Maggie Smith appear arriving at the Don Pepe in a grey sportscar for one of the two scenes filmed there by director John Madden.\n\nThey are supposed to be driving along Route 66 to a meeting with a hotel chain in California.\n\nExtinction (2015)\n\nZombies have taken control of the Earth, but the survivors exist in a hotel, in reality situated in Budapest, surrounded by snow and ice, kindly provided by the Pyrenees mountains near Vielha, Lleída.\n\nDon’t Grow Up (2015)\n\n….because if you do, you’ll turn into a zombie, something I can vouch for.\n\nThis is good news; you can never have too many examples of the walking dead, can you?\n\nThe film was shot on the island of Tenerife, with filming at Santa Cruz, La Laguna and the Parque Nacional del Teide.\n\nThe village of Güimar was also an important location for filming during March 2014.\n\nSecond Origin (2015)\n\nA young woman, an unhappy English teacher played by British actress Rachel Hurd-Wood, and a boy of African origin, have escaped the holocaust and they must learn to make a new start, speaking English and Catalan.\n\nFilming took place in Barcelona, where the beach scenes were shot, and where we see Barcelona Football Club’s stadium destroyed; and Lleída, whose city is shown completely devastated, and where the water into which the boy is thrown, and which saves their lives, is in reality the ‘Estany d’Ivars I Vila-Sana,’ just east of Lleída, although the underwater scenes were shot at the INEF swimming pool. The lake where Alba’s house is located is the reservoir of Utxesa.\n\nAlso in Lleída, a fruit and veg stall and bar were constructed on the promenade of the river, with the cathedral in the background, and then blown up.\n\nThe library scenes were shot in the cathedral cloisters with a lot of special destructive effects inevitably.\n\nCarles Porta directed, taking over from Bigas Luna who died during the production phase. The film was finished as a homage to him.\n\nThe Evil that Men Do (2015)\n\nA story of Narcos and kidnapped children set somewhere on the border between Mexico and Texas, but written and directed by downhome good ole boys Daniel Faraldo and Ramón Térmens.\n\nMost of the filming was done in an abandoned washing machine factory at Martorelles, Barcelona, which has since been demolished, and at the nearby quarry. More expensive than filming in a coffin!\n\nThanks to Ramon Térmens and Ivan Llamas for their help.\n\nMonsoon Tide (2015)\n\nMost of the film was shot in India, although the underwater scenes were filmed off the coast of Murcia.\n\nNick Fletcher of Laid Back Films informed us: ‘The underwater scenes were intended to be all shot off the coast of Tarifa. Some shots and angles were filmed there but visibility did not allow us to shoot the ‘rising of the body to the surface shot’ so our dive team travelled down to Murcia where the visibility was better and that shot was filmed there, at Aguilas.’\n\nCarpe Diem: European Escapade (2015)\n\nAny excuse to travel all over Europe looking for a friend who got lost in a train station toilet; very lion, witch and wardrobish!\n\nThe Spanish section includes scenes in, San Sebastián (Guipúzcoa), with views of Monte Igueldo, the cathedral and a scene shot on the Concha beach, and on the streets of Pamplona, Navarra.\n\nFinally in Barcelona we briefly see Port Vell, la Pedrera and the National Art Museum, as well as the Barceloneta beach.\n\nThe Singleton (2015)\n\nA movie about an artist called Kudos, with filming in the UK and around Málaga.\n\nVampyres (2015)\n\nVictor Matellano remakes a 1974 classic by Joseph Larraz, in which two young ladies tempt people back to their mansion to dine. Obviously the menu may not be to their liking.\n\nThe mansion in question was Finca Villa Ángeles, Avenida Alto de León 69, San Rafael, Segovia, the summer residence of Ramón Menéndez Pidal, the famous historian, who was a consultant on the movie El Cid. It is located in San Rafael, Segovia.\n\nThe basement scenes were shot in the Cartuja de Talamanca de Jarama, Madrid.\n\nPursuit (2015)\n\nThe film crew were lodged in three hotels in Nerja, Málaga, for two weeks: the Parador, Perla Marina and Hotel Nerja Club, and shot various chase scenes in the area, particularly on the road between Nerja and Maro and a stretch of the N340 road at the Águila aqueduct, which is seen in the background as the couple, Diarmuid and Gráinne, are finally captured on a bridge.\n\nFilming of this modern version of the ancient Irish legend of Diarmuid and Gráinne also took place near the María Luisa estate, Hotel Marinas de Nerja, where Gráinne gets a job as a "
