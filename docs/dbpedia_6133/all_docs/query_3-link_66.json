        "meta_description": "Season 3 may not be as consistent, but it still brings plenty of hilariously weird and uncomfortable situations.\n\n\n\nNOW STREAMING:\n\n\n  \n    Powered by\n    JustWatch\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s difficult to explain to an average human the madness that is I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson. You could say it’s a sketch comedy show that combines surrealist imagery, social satire, and existential dread into tiny bursts of joyful chaos. Or you could point to the title. Every sketch--usually three to five an episode--features a character that’s so annoying or goes against social norms in such extremely inappropriate ways you want to scream at them to leave the room immediately. \n\n\n\nChicago, by way of Detroit, legend and show creator Tim Robinson plays most of these troubled characters. He has the Charles Grodin-like ability to embody a complete doofus so sure of his own rightness that we feel like the moron. Now in its third season on Netflix, I Think You Should Leave has gone from bizarre curiosity to King of pop culture memedom. The memes should continue to flow after this latest batch of insanity Robinson and friends have unleashed. \n\n\n\nNever ever drive with Tim Robinson. If the show's taught us anything, it is that. \n(Netflix)\n\n\n\nThis collection may not be as consistent as the first two seasons. None of the sketches here reach the hilarious emotional depths of season two’s “Prank Show” or the gut-busting jokes of season one’s “Instagram.” But sketches (especially ones this bizarre and ludicrous) can get better with repeat viewings. Like listening to a great album, songs can open up more the longer you listen and digest the notes. \n\n\n\nFor example, the first time I watched the Walk the Line-inspired “Bones are their dollars” sketch from season one, I honestly didn’t get it. By the 20th time I watched it, I couldn’t breathe from laughing so hard. The same applies to season 3. I didn’t love this sketch, but I assume by next year, I’ll be saying, “Back away, banana breath, what did you just eat? A banana?” under my breath multiple times a day. \n\n\n\nThis season’s sketches run the gamut for typical sketch premises. There are fake commercials, like a spot for a heart monitor aid that Tim’s character needs after partying too hard at the clubs. The show also loves the awkwardness of workplace relationships, as in a sketch where Tim plays a co-worker who hears a loud noise during a meeting and insists it’s a volcano exploding. \n\n\n\n\n[Robinson] has the Charles Grodin-like ability to embody a complete doofus so sure of his own rightness that we feel like the moron.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, what separates I Think You Should Leave from others is that there is no “typical” structure. The sketches usually never end where they start, and things can go from silly to poignant in a second. For instance, that heart monitor sketch turns from a commercial to a story about the relationship between a man and his doctor who just wants to get into exclusive nightclubs. The volcano sketch turns into a meditation on the drudgery of work when Tim’s co-worker gets yelled at for telling him he’s interesting. \n\n\n\nSince none of the episodes have a set theme--only one sketch has a callback in a later episode--the show lets the individual sketches speak for themselves. So instead of rating the season overall, here are the top five sketches of season 3 that sum up what makes the show special. \n\n\n\nWill Forte is one of Tim's famous friends to get in on the fun. (Netflix)\n\n\n\n5. “Pay it Forward”- Ep 3 \n\n\n\nA perfect Tim Robinson character that combines smarmy know-it-all with pathetic desperation. He plays a man at a fast food drive-in who plots a scheme where he pays for the person’s food behind him, only to use that to his advantage to drive back around and order $680 worth of food, hoping the person ahead of him pays for it. When he attempts to escape and gets caught, he tries to escape by saying, “I just wanted to do something nice before alcohol class.”. \n\n\n\n4. “Dad at Wedding”- Ep. 5 \n\n\n\nRobinson loves bringing along some comedic genius friends to help out with the show, like long-time Detroiters pal Sam Richardson and SNL alum Tim Meadows, who puts this sketch on the shortlist by just him screaming, “Three seconds to think of something silly? That’s fucking insane.” \n\n\n\n3. “Darmine Doggy Door”- Ep. 2 \n\n\n\nA sketch that perfectly encapsulates how horrifically silly I Think You Should Leave can be. It starts as a commercial parody about a doggy door that only lets dogs in but then takes a turn when a pig monster straight out of The Thing attacks Tim. It turns out it was just his neighbor’s pig wearing a Richard Nixon mask, but at least it leads him to realize he hates his job. \n\n\n\nShhh! He's concentrating. (Netflix)\n\n\n\n2. “Barley Tonight”- Ep 1 \n\n\n\nThe first sketch of the season and the best pure sketch writing of the batch. Tim plays the host of a political debate show. Anytime he finds himself on the losing side of the argument, he slouches in his chair and pulls out his phone. The sketch gets funnier as it goes when he mumbles about his mom, and his guests genuinely ask about her. “I gotta do something for my mom. She’s not getting any hot water.” \n\n\n\n1. “Shirt Brothers”- Ep 4 \n\n\n\nThis is the emotional high point of the season. Tim plays a father attending his daughter’s school concert. There he runs into Shane, the grandfather of another kid at the school. They also happen to be wearing the same shirt. Shane quickly forms a bond with him about the shirt, even though Tim has no idea why. He creepily smiles at him during the concert and then suddenly taps him on the shoulder. “Shirt brother, you gotta help me. I’m in deep fucking trouble here.” \n\n\n\nHe leads Tim to a destroyed classroom. Turns out Shane has been listening to a song on repeat that tells him there are no rules. The ones people insist exist, he shouldn’t follow. So after “draining his lizard,” he finds an empty classroom and breaks everything. They have a heart-to-heart about feeling inspired when life feels flat. Then Shane makes him promise not to follow another rule again as the score swells. With the fake “No Rules” song playing, Tim runs back to the gym just in time for his daughter’s solo. It’s nonsensical, hilarious, and weirdly moving. It’s the perfect I Think You Should Leave sketch. \n\n\n\nI Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson is making it weird now on Netflix.\n\n\n\nI Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson Trailer:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FzJpbtK5Wg",

They created a dystopia that was vaguely familiar but could still leave you rolling your eyes at its implausibility. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, the concept is as follows: On one night each year, the US government legalizes all crime, including murder, in the hopes of providing an outlet for Americans’ rage. It ultimately leads to an overall decrease in crime and an (ostensibly) utopian society.

There's an expected cognitive dissonance that comes with watching a man-on-a-mission genre piece set in the Middle East. Whether it's a glorified shooting gallery or a power fantasy where the hero stops just short of bleeding red, white, and blue - one needs to practice a mental limbo to either ignore or maybe be pleasantly surprised with the bare minimum concessions to showing the opposite side's perspectives. Ric Roman Waugh's expertly mounted, ambitiously scattered Kandahar is, at its core, a Stagecoach riff. One where our leading man, career CIA operative Tom Harris (Gerard Butler leveraging his soulful full-time divorced dad essence), has 30 hours to make a mad 400-mile dash across an Afghanistan desert from an impossibly large group of following forces. It's a foolproof premise, yet intriguingly, Kandahar refuses to embrace its conceptual neatness.

However, Hardcore 30 Rock fans will quickly discover Netflix’s new animated series feels pretty familiar to the early-aughts sitcom. First, there’s the fast-paced comedic timing, a signature of producers Robert Carlock, Tina Fey, and Sam Means. Next, both series feature the infectious, bouncy music of Jeff Richmond. Finally, both got off to a bit of a rough start. Still, just like hang gliding over an apocalyptic alien attack, Mulligan’s an amusing, wild journey that rewards viewers who hang on for the ride.

Though it’s hardly a new thing at this point, I simply do not understand the concept of looking to strangers on the internet (not even celebrities, just regular people!) for advice on everything from what to wear to what to eat to whether or not to vaccinate your children. How does this happen? Where do these people come from? Frankly, it’s a little creepy. Kurtis David Harder explores some of the aspects of it in Influencer, which doesn’t answer those questions, but is a tense, fun little thriller that takes some unexpected turns.

Even the most well-received entries of the bunch struggle to find reasons they should exist in the first place. Rob Marshall’s The Little Mermaid is no different, but for one crucial factor that sets it apart from the rest: Halle Bailey as Ariel. Bailey is so captivating and winsome in the titular role that this remake almost feels worth it just to launch her into movie stardom. Unfortunately, sub-par CGI effects and clunky changes to Howard Ashman’s classic songs often make it feel like Bailey is left to carry the movie on the strength of her remarkable talent alone. With a shaggy runtime of two hours and fifteen minutes—a full hour longer than the original cartoon—it’s a heavy load for one performer to bear.

If the boys of Only Murders In the Building are Jessica Fletcher for the 2020s and Natasha Lyonne’s Charlie of Poker Face is today’s Columbo, High Desert’s Peggy (Patricia Arquette) is the inheritor of the con artist crime fighter mantel. Think those “Characters Welcome” staples Psych or White Collar. Then trade the charismatic 30-something man running a scam for a charismatic middle-aged woman looking for an angle and maybe some pills.

Granted, there have already been a few, but those were from a time when the threat was neutralized. Now, in our current upside down world, they’re being normalized by both the media and Republican politicians, some of whom, like Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, would rather pretend they don’t know what “white nationalism” is than denounce it. We really don’t need a “but what if they can change?” story right now. But Paul Schrader is doing it anyway with Master Gardener, a movie that is surely well-intentioned, but ill-timed at best, and clumsy and borderline offensive at worst.

Building from its humble roots as a 2001 street-racing Point Break riff to the gargantuan action tentpole it's after a whopping ten movies (eleven if you count Hobbs & Shaw), the series has built quite the convoluted lore over the decades. There are dead characters who come back to life (Sung Kang's Han), living characters who can never come back because their actors are no longer with us (see: Paul Walker's Brian), sworn enemies who join the familiar just one film later. It's dudebro soap opera, fueled by nitrous oxide and every weird, bonkers thing the filmmakers can think to do with a car.

The films in the first program of shorts at this year’s Chicago Critics Film Festival all concern those mythic American values of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” And they do this in both content and form. Though these films never exceed twenty minutes, they are unbounded examples of the human imagination. We open on the “happy family” of Nicole Daddona and Adam Wilder’s deliciously unsettling The Mundanes. This surreal nostalgic PSA about the ideal American family is a delightful work of surreal suspense. What begins as a richly designed comment on the facelessness of the perfect family in the white nostalgic imagination soon amps up into an amusing work of comedy horror. Unspeakable delights feed the happiness of the Happy Family. You can bet ambrosia salad won’t be the most unappetizing thing on this 50s-inspired tablescape. The Mundanes serves up a sensational visual style and keen directorial perspective on a silver platter with a healthy helping of disturbing social commentary on the side.

Movie (2023),\n\nMPAA RatingR\n\nStudioIngenious Media,\n\nThere's at once too much, and somehow not enough, of the whimsical DIY spirit of writer-director Robert Rodriguez in his latest film, the shaky B-thriller Hypnotic. The Austin native made his name in the halcyon days of '90s indie filmmaking, shooting his first feature (El Mariachi) for a mere $7,000 at the tender age of 23. Since then, he's leveraged that inventiveness into a cottage industry of his own based out of his hometown of Austin, Texas, whether it's kid-friendly fare (Spy Kids), big-budget CGI blockbusters (Alita: Battle Angel), moody noirs (Sin City) or grindhouse splatterfests (Planet Terror, From Dusk Till Dawn). Hypnotic is all and none of those things, a chintzy lo-fi Christopher Nolan riff that doesn't have nearly enough life to work. And yet, there are just enough charming elements to save it from outright dismissal.

The new series, created by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, evokes the era matter-of-factly. Besides nailing the look of early 21st Century Manhattan, it captures the sense of a city in transition. The groundwork for the gentrification that swept across Manhattan and Brooklyn had just been activated. Mayor Bloomberg was taking what Giuliani had begun and pushing it farther and faster than “America’s Mayor” ever managed. And while the series eventually stomps the theme into the ground, the tendency to wonder if every adverse event was evidence of terrorism was very alive.
