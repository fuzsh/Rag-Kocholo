        "text": "James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy has always stood out from the other films in the MCU for a number of reasons – from its intergalactic setting to its style of comedy – and one of the other standout features has been the director's use of music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his third and final instalment of the sci-fi Marvel franchise, Gunn has once again packed the soundtrack with a mixture of popular hits and less familiar tunes from years gone by, this time incorporating songs from the '80s and '90s rather than just the '70s.\n\nSpeaking to RadioTimes.com and other media at a press conference ahead of the film's release, Gunn explained how it has become a little more difficult for him to select songs over the years.\n\n\"It has become strange ‘cause the first two albums were huge hits,\" he said. \"They changed the lives of some of these artists who now have big hit songs. And so, I know that when I’m choosing a song, it’s going to be something that a lot of people listen to.\"\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 soundtrack is available to buy now\n\nHe added: \"It was very difficult choosing the music for this movie because in the first two movies, they were basically all ‘70s pop hits. In this one, you know, Yondu gives Peter Quill a Zune at the end of the second movie and it’s music from the ‘70s, ‘80s,‘90s, 2000s. So, it was very difficult because of that.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nKicking off with Radiohead's Creep, the soundtrack for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 also includes songs from the likes of Earth, Wind & Fire, Beastie Boys, and Florence + The Machine.\n\nRead on for the full list of songs in the upcoming movie, which you can listen to now on Amazon Music.\n\nGet exclusive film newsletters from our award-winning editorial team\n\nSign up to get alerts for movie news, reviews and recommendations\n\nEmail address\n\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.
