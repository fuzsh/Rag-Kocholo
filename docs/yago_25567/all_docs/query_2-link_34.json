        "text": "Aug. 1, 2013 – University of Utah President David W. Pershing issued the following statement today on behalf of the university:\n\nThe University of Utah community extends condolences to the family, friends and caregivers of English Professor Brooke Hopkins, who passed away Wednesday, some four-and-a-half years after he was paralyzed in a bicycling accident. Brooke and his wife, philosophy Professor Peggy Battin, are recognized as among the university’s most beloved teachers. Peggy, for years has been a leader in the study of end-of-life issues, and a tireless advocate for human dignity and the right for each person to end their own suffering if they choose. Her academic pursuits became all too personal after Brooke’s accident. Their life together since then has been a tribute to human dignity, perseverance and enduring love. Brooke continued to teach great literature despite his medical ordeal. By sharing their story widely and publicly through their blog and the news media, Brooke and Peggy put the issues of life and death in starkly personal terms that brought the subject home to all who heard their story. By doing that, they both cemented a legacy of great teaching. We wish Peggy well in her life after Brooke’s passing."
