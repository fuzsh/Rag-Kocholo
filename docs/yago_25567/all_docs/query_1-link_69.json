        "text": "WASHINGTON\n\nAT 20 years old, strapped to a polygraph machine, I quietly confessed that “I might be, um ... homosexual.” Technically, I was lying. There was no “might be” about it.\n\nThe machine’s operator, who stood between me and a summer sinecure at the National Security Agency, broke character with a compassionate squint.\n\n“Could your sexual orientation be the basis of a bribery attempt against you?”\n\nI assured her that no one would find out. I got the job.\n\nThat was eight years ago. It was the first time I had ever revealed my sexual orientation. And it was the only time I’d done so, until now. Not even my closest friends know.\n\nThat a prestigious position was on the line at the time is telling, at least according to a recently published study by John Pachankis and Mark Hatzenbuehler. They have substantiated what’s called the “Best Little Boy in the World” hypothesis, first put forward in 1973 in a book by Andrew Tobias, then writing under a pseudonym. It’s the idea that young, closeted men deflect attention from their sexuality by investing in recognized markers of success: good grades, athletic achievement, elite employment and so on. Overcompensating in competitive arenas affords these men a sense of self-worth that their concealment diminishes.\n\nBiographies do not commonly lurk in stuffy academic journals, but there was mine, in that study in the latest issue of Basic and Applied Social Psychology. It might as well have been subtitled: “The Adam Chandler Story.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
