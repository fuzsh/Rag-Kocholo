        "text": "The August 2024 full moon, also known as the Sturgeon Moon, is taking place very soon — but this one is extra special as it will also be a Blue Moon.\n\nAny avid stargazer will know there are two types of Blue Moon: seasonal and monthly.\n\nSeasonal Blue Moons occur when there are four full moons in a single season (spring, summer, fall and winter) instead of the typical three, whereas a monthly Blue Moon refers to the second full moon within a single calendar month.\n\nRead on for everything to know about the upcoming August full moon and when to see it...\n\nWhat is a Blue Moon?\n\nA Blue Moon has nothing to do with the colour of the moon (it's not actually blue). Instead, it's all to do with the timings of full moons during the year.\n\nMany cultures around the world have given names to each of the full moons. For example, February's full moon is named a 'snow moon' and May's full moon is known as the 'flower moon' — a celebration of the flowers that grow during May.\n\n\"A 'Blue Moon' has a couple of different definitions, but each refers to a higher number of full moons than usual occurring within a certain period of time,\"Anna Gammon-Ross, senior astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, tells Country Living.\n\n\"This can happen because it takes 29.5 days for the moon to complete each cycle of phases, so very slightly less than the length of a typical month. When two full moons occur within one month, this is a monthly Blue Moon. Alternatively, a seasonal blue moon is when four occur in one astronomical season, rather than the usual three.\"\n\nWhen it the next Blue Moon?\n\nThe next seasonal Blue Moon will take place very soon on Monday 19th August (18:26 GMT). It's also the first of four Full Supermoons in 2024, taking place from August to November.\n\nHowever, the next monthly Blue Moon will fall on May 31, 2026.\n\nHow often is a Blue Moon?\n\nBlue Moons are actually fairly common, appearing once every two to three years, according to NASA. In 2018, we unusually had two monthly Blue Moons in one year and only two months apart.\n\nAccording to the RMG, the next time we will get two in a year will be 2037.\n\nHow did the Blue Moon get its name?\n\nIt's unclear where the term \"Blue Moon\" came from, but the RGM think it could be a mispronunciation of the disused word \"belewe\", which means \"to betray\". This may be a reference to the betrayal of the usual idea of having one full moon in each month.\n\n\"There are conflicting sources about where the term 'Blue Moon' has come from, but they all refer to the fact that the moon turning blue is a rare or impossible event,\" says Anna."
