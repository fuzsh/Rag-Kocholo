        "text": "As the number of people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) increases, so does the amount of information about the condition and medications used to treat it on social media sites such as TikTok.\n\nBut studies have shown a lot of the information on social media about ADHD, and the medications used to treat it, is factually incorrect.\n\nOnce seen (wrongly) as a condition mostly affecting hyperactive primary and secondary school-aged boys, more Australians are being diagnosed with ADHD, including girls and adults.\n\nAccurate information about the medications used to treat ADHD can be hard to find and many people have questions about the medicines and their effects on patients.\n\nThe ABC consulted experts and clinicians working in the field about how ADHD medicines work, their effectiveness and possible side effects.\n\nWhat is ADHD?\n\nBefore we discuss medications, what exactly is ADHD?\n\nIt is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes poor concentration and reduced impulse control.\n\nPeople with ADHD have differences in the parts of the brain which control executive function, such as the ability to plan, organise and focus.\n\nKey traits can include:\n\nDifficulty with attention, concentration, focus and organisation.\n\nImpulsivity, such as interrupting conversations, or acting without thinking.\n\nHyperactivity, such as fidgeting. Many people with ADHD don't experience this symptom.\n\nAccording to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, the exact causes of ADHD are unknown, but it often runs in families and several biological and environmental risk factors have been identified.\n\nDisruption to the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline is thought to play a role in ADHD.\n\nEstimates vary about the proportion of Australians with ADHD, but it is thought to be around five per cent of children and at least two per cent of adults.\n\nPsychiatrist David Coghill, chair of developmental mental health at the University of Melbourne, said maintaining attention or focus is a consistent problem for people with ADHD.\n\n\"Those are not only a constant part of their life, but they interfere with day-to-day activities,'' Professor Coghill said.\n\nCanberra GP Kerrie Aust, who sees many patients with ADHD, compared the challenge of focus to having too many screens open on a computer screen at once.\n\n\"It's like you're sitting in front of a computer which is your brain and you've got 25 different internet browsers all open at the same time,'' Dr Aust said.\n\n\"Every single one of them is making noise, splashing colours, things are singing out to you and you're unable to figure out where your attention needs to go because your brain's trying to take it all in at once.\"\n\nStimulant medications\n\nThe stimulants methylphenidate (commonly known as Ritalin) and dexamphetamine are the most frequently prescribed medications for ADHD.\n\nProfessor Coghill says about 19 out of every 20 ADHD patients will get a good response from methylphenidate or dexamphetamine.\n\nDr Aust said stimulant medication would probably make a person without ADHD feel \"revved up\" and anxious, but it had a different effect on people with ADHD.\n\n\"When we give a stimulant medication to someone with ADHD, it actually calms their brain, so you find that they can focus better, they can complete tasks more easily because they're not constantly getting distracted,'' she said.\n\nShort-acting doses of stimulants last about four hours, while stronger doses could last six to 12 hours.\n\nResearch by Professor Coghill on the long-terms effects of stimulant medications on ADHD patients in Europe found that long-term negative effects were rare.\n\nPossible stimulant side effects\n\nPaediatrician Daryl Efron is an associate professor in the University of Melbourne Department of Paediatrics, and senior research fellow in the Murdoch Children's Research Institute.\n\nHe said while many patients did not experience any problems with stimulants, the most common side effect was loss of appetite.\n\nSome children who took stimulants in the morning to help them focus at school had limited appetite during the school day but would become hungry later in the afternoon and have extra food as the effects wore off, he said.\n\nA rarer side effect can be \"emotional blunting'', where patients might become withdrawn and quiet or seem depressed.\n\nDr Efron stressed that the purpose of medications was to help patients to function better, not to fundamentally change them.\n\n\"We want them to feel like their normal selves and appear to their parents like their normal selves but be able to focus better and to function better,'' he said.\n\nNon-stimulant medications\n\nSome people with ADHD can't take stimulants due to other medical conditions, or because of side effects.\n\nCommonly prescribed non-stimulants include atomoxetine (also known as Strattera) and guanfacine (also known as Intuniv).\n\nUnlike stimulants, which only work for several hours, the non-stimulants work 24 hours a day.\n\nIn some instances, stimulants and non-stimulants can be prescribed together.\n\nSide effects from non-stimulants could include nausea in some patients who take atomoxetine.\n\nDo patients need to stay on medication forever?\n\nNot all ADHD patients who start medications will need to stay on them long-term, although some will.\n\nIn the case of children, Dr Efron said medication should be reviewed at least every six months, with opportunities looked to reduce doses, or in some instances stopped.\n\n\"The brain continues to develop into adolescence and into early adult life so the children's capacity to regulate their attention and their focus and their impulse control is always improving naturally,'' Dr Efron said.\n\nLikewise, GP Dr Aust said some of the patients she sees were able to stop taking medication.\n\n\"For others it is definitely a lifelong condition and we know that when we take them off medication that they have an increase in their dysfunction and they find that they do need help, and they often come back to us and say actually 'I've had a trial off and I really do think I benefit from it and I think I'd like to go in it again'.''\n\nOther supports include psychologists and occupational therapists\n\nRegardless of whether or not people with ADHD are treated with medications, clinicians agree that education about the condition and other kinds of support, such as behavioural training and coaching, are essential.\n\nProfessor Coghill said it was important that people had an accurate understanding of their ADHD.\n\nIn addition to seeing their GP and specialist, people with ADHD could receive support from psychologists with an interest in neurodiversity and occupational therapists.\n\nSome of the support could include \"life hacks,'' such as how to stay organised and break down tasks at work or school into smaller units.\n\n\"Looking at how you structure work, homework, commitments, even simple things like meal and home organisation, benefit from that additional input,'' Professor Coghill said."
