        "text": "2018-01-02 UPDATE: In process of adding newly discovered episodes or information pertaining to Jan-Jul 1987, all of which will be noted with (NEW), for previous viewers of this page, to find.\n\n*As I have noted in the description of occasional past years, 1987 was a year of recap clip eps. You will find that even though there are many MANY more available full Eps for this year, there are still a lot of episodes which were/are narrowed down to simply a RECAP or a few RECAPs. You will also find times where the original up-loader, (my SOURCE for all of the AMC shows I upload,) has previously uploaded only a RECAP, but at a later date, decided to upload the full episode. I profusely thank her (or him), for this after-thought!\n\n* As I've (many times) previously mentioned, storms OFTEN interfered with recording quality of non-digital television; I ask you to overlook all quality issues of these AMC uploads, as what is here is likely the only available copy of that ep or clip. These programs were uploaded to the internet from the personal video recordings of a person who obviously enjoyed the show and possibly believed there would be other like-minded souls out there who would enjoy watching the by-gone ''Golden Days'' of All My Children .... now that the show is no longer running, the gesture can only be referred to as a loving gift, delivered by a person who truly cared! I hope you enjoy yet another year of All My Children.\n\n*To that person... or those persons .... who took the time to make these wonderful memories available to us: I give thanks to you for your gift to all current and future, viewers!! Because of your saved recordings, regardless of any quality issues, we (the appreciative audience) are fortunate to be able to watch these episodes today ..... not to mention, view them here at archive.org, free of charge - unlike the direction u-tube (spelt wrong for legal purposes) is heading! :)\n\nSYNOPSIS: 1987 Jan 01\n\n*Cliff and Nina, having wed the month before (Dec. 1986), were preparing to move to Hong Kong, when their family and friends surprised them with a going away party.\n\n*Though Mark Dalton's problems with the law were over, his cocaine abuse grew worse. In the month of Feb.. a gas leak took place at Ellen`s restaurant, The Chateau, during the evening of a fundraising benefit. Mark was a piano player at the establishment, and that night, his drug addict friend, Frankie, showed up there, to try to tempt him into joining her in a ``cooking class.`` Trying to stay clean, he refused and left her alone in his dressing room where she eventually threw a lit match into a garbage can.\n\n*The gas leak finally reached that room and the hot flame (and Ellen`s restaurant) blew up. Fortunately, there were no deaths. However, there was one major casualty. Mark had heard Ross speak of the gas leak, prior to the explosion, and knowing she was looking for him in his dressing room, Mark rushed to save Ellen from a possible catastrophe but got to her just as the explosion took place.\n\n*Ellen was found alive (under a heavy beam), by another person, and immediately rushed to PV hospital emergency where she was operated on by Jeff Martin, newly back to PV from California, after a bitter divorce between him and his former wife, a drug addict.\n\n*The operation was a success, but the problem of Mark`s Drug addiction, prompted Jeff to use the knowledge he received during his wife's unsuccessful drug intervention, by summoning together Mark's friend, Brooke English, Mark`s former wife Ellen and also his half-sister Erica, which spearheaded a very successful \"intervention\" for Mark which led Mark to seek professional drug rehabilitation to help him fight his cocaine addiction.\n\n*Jesse went undercover to find the leader of a baby-selling ring and he discovered that \"Mr. Big\" was none other than his very own father-in-law , Les Baxter! Jesse stumbled upon Les's secret life at a time when his father-in-law was blackmailing Senatorial candidate Travis Montgomery. Travis feared that this revelation, preposterously untrue, could cripple his candidacy.\n\n*Without telling Angie, Jesse followed Travis to his meeting with \"Mr. Big,\" hoping to catch him in the act of taking a bribe. In a horrific turn of events, the plan went awry when Les spotted his son-in-law. Angie arrived on the scene just in time to witness the horrifying sight of her husband killing her father in self-defense. Jesse received a commendation for his heroic efforts, but the reward was bittersweet. Angered by her husband's deception, Angie left Jesse.\n\n*Ross Chandler continued to play with fire by carrying on a torrid affair with Palmer's private nurse, Natalie Hunter. Feeling neglected by his wife, Ellen, restless Ross became more and more obsessed with Natalie. Their affair remained safe (and secret), until the January day that Jeremy Hunter stumbled upon the lovers in the throes of a deep kiss. In March, Ross's adopted daughter, Julie witnessed the same stunning sight and recorded exactly what she saw in her diary, which Adam Chandler eagerly found, read, and used to threaten Ross. The walls were closing in on Ross Chandler.\n\n*Ross's life grew more complicated when Palmer proposed marriage to Natalie. Feeling that she would never have Ross all to herself, Natalie accepted Palmer's offer and became his wife. When Ross's marriage to Ellen unraveled, he entered Natalie's room, closed the door behind him, and raped her. Julie, having heard Natalie's screams, fled Cortlandt Manor in tears, boarding a train out of town. Witnessing the rape was the latest in a series of devastating blows for young Julie Chandler, an innocent girl in love with her teenage sweetheart, Charlie Brent.\n\n*In 1987, an overjoyed Julie came to know her natural mother, Elizabeth Carlyle, who made the surprising confession that Mark Dalton was Julie's father. Elizabeth harbored another explosive secret - the reason she gave Julie up for adoption was because she had been a prostitute. Earlier, on the night of Natalie's rape, Julie confronted her mother who was forced to admit this secret. Devastated, Julie fled to New York where she was befriended by Creed Kelly, a smooth-talking man who claimed to be her friend. In reality, Creed (a pimp) was a sworn enemy of Julie's natural mother, Elizabeth, and he was determined to get back at her by seducing Julie. Assisting him was his nephew, Nico Kelly.\n\n*However, Julie came to see that, beneath Nico's frosty exterior, was a heart of gold. Back in Pine Valley, Julie's lonely beau, Charlie, was ripe for seduction at the hands, and lips, of Cecily Davidson, Phoebe's feisty god-daughter who earlier in the year had come to live with Phoebe for a year or so.\n\n*Creed's monstrous plan to rape Julie in front of her mother was thwarted by Nico, who overpowered his uncle, stopping him from committing the abhorrent act. Creed fled, and Julie apologized to Nico for misjudging him. Nico was later apprehended and imprisoned, but by then, he and Julie were very much in love.\n\n*In November 1987, all eyes were on the Pine Valley Courthouse where Ross Chandler stood trial for the rape of Natalie Hunter Cortlandt. While the jury deliberated the case, Julie returned and confronted Ross, who realized that what took place that night was not seduction - it was rape. Just as the Judge was about to announce the verdict, Ross raced in to the packed courtroom and admitted his guilt. He was sentenced to prison, where intense therapy revealed that he had been an abused child.\n\n*Erica found herself more and more attracted to politician Travis Montgomery. However, she soon found herself butting heads with Travis's ex-wife, the chic business-whiz, Barbara. Erica hoped that Travis would propose to her, but caught up with his many business and political interests, Mr. Montgomery did not exactly have marriage on the mind. That situation changed dramatically, when Erica became pregnant with his child. At first, Erica kept the news secret from Travis for fear it would destroy his campaign, but when Barbara blurted it out to him, Travis asked Erica to marry him. While planning her wedding, Erica met and became intrigued with Travis's brother, Jackson Montgomery, an unscrupulous attorney.\n\n*Complicating matters for Erica was the revelation that Noelle Keaton, a young woman suffering from amnesia, was actually her long-lost sister, Silver. While helping Noelle unlock the secret of her past, Jeremy Hunter fell in love with her. Erica joined in the quest which took them to Cobbler's Island in Canada, where they encountered Silver's mother, Goldie Kane, whose hatred of Erica was sparked by stipulations in the will of her dead husband, and Erica's father, Eric Kane, which designated her daughter, Silver, the sole owner of the island -- but only if Erica dies. Erica was stunned to discover that Goldie had hypnotized Silver to carry out her murder. However, it was Goldie who ultimately pulled the trigger, shooting the pregnant Erica in the abdomen. Travis, (who earlier had arrived on the island and married Erica in their own private ceremony) rushed Erica back to Pine Valley, where surgery to remove the bullet endangered the life of her unborn child.\n\n*Goldie Kane's life appeared to come to an end when, in a struggle with Silver, she fell overboard a boat and disappeared into the sea. Traumatized by the tragic events, Silver returned to Pine Valley with Jeremy, and began treatment at Oak Haven Sanitarium with psychiatrist Dr. Damon Lazarre, the head of a mysterious cult.\n\n*It was revealed that the manipulative Dr. Lazarre was Silver's husband, and it was he who masterminded Goldie's plan to kill Erica! The story-line culminated on a bridge where Lazarre, his secret exposed, was about to push Erica and Silver to their deaths, when Jeremy heroically raced to their rescue, and after a struggle, Lazarre toppled to his death.\n\n*Cindy Parker, a sweet and kind young woman in desperate need of a place to stay, arrived in Pine Valley with her young son Scott in tow. Within days of her arrival, Cindy grew instantly smitten with her son's art teacher, the kindly Stuart Chandler.\n\n*On his way home from Hong Kong, Dr. Cliff Warner stopped in a war-torn South American country to deliver emergency supplies. He promised Nina he'd be home within days. However, when the day of Cliff's return came and went, Nina grew increasingly alarmed. Soon, the words Nina dreaded came - Cliff had been shot and killed by the rebel forces. Nina held back her grief, and found solace with Matt Connelly and married him.\n\n*Plagued by memories of Cliff, Nina was never able to give herself totally to Matt, and their new marriage suffered because of it. To everyone's shock and surprise, Cliff turned up alive having been held prisoner by the rebel forces. Cliff and Nina enjoyed a romantic reunion, reaffirming their love with a night of passionate love-making. Nina shared herself with Cliff, but couldn't bring herself to reveal that she had married Matt. Upon hearing the truth that his wife had married another man, Cliff stormed out on Nina.\n\n*I have uploaded, and will continue to upload to the Internet Archive, for educational purposes only!
