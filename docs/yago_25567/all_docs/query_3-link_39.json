        "text": "It was Sandra Ludig Brooke’s first wedding anniversary without her husband of 33 years, who had died in 2019 after more than a decade of health setbacks. That same day, March 1, 2020, her friends Maggi McCormick Gordon and David Sorrell Gordon were hosting a party in Los Angeles to celebrate their own 46th wedding anniversary. Ms. Brooke debated whether to attend.\n\n“I went, there was this lovely party and of course I cried all the way home,” she said.\n\nThe following year, in February 2021, Ms. Gordon was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer and eventually died, on June 6. At the end of a celebration of her life a few weeks later, Ms. Brooke was saying goodbye to Mr. Gordon and the two of them suggested meeting up to talk about losing a beloved partner.\n\n“We thought it would be a nice, companionable lunch and it turned out to be quite a searing conversation about death and loss,” Ms. Brooke said.\n\n[Click here to binge read this week’s featured couples.]\n\nMs. Brooke, 65, is the Avery director of the library at the Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens, in San Marino, Calif. She has a bachelor’s degree in the history of art from Northwestern University, a master’s degree in the history of art from Williams College, and a master’s degree in library science from SUNY Albany. Mr. Gordon, 81, is the president of the Sierra Madre Playhouse and has a bachelor’s degree in politics, philosophy and economics from the University of Oxford."
