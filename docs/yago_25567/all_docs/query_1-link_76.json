        "text": "Richard died peacefully with family by his side at Riddle Hospital in Pennsylvania on April 1, 2024, at the age of 100.\n\nHe was born in Wilmington, DE, in 1923, son of William B. and Marion Zolper. Growing up in the Highlands area, he graduated from Wilmington High School and pursued higher education at the University of Delaware where he was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon. College was interrupted when he volunteered for the U.S. Navy during WWII, participating in officer training at The College of Wooster. He was assigned to flight school and commissioned as an ensign where he served as a flight instructor focusing on sea landings and takeoffs. After his service, he returned to the University of Delaware to pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering and began his career at DuPont to work in international sales and marketing for the Chemicals and Dyes division. In 1966, he married Leann M. Olsick, and they settled in Wilmington where they raised their two children. Dick, as he was known to friends and colleagues, retired from DuPont in 1989 after 47 years. Richard and Leann moved from Wilmington to Glen Mills, PA in 1997.\n\nRichard was an accomplished pilot, sailor, skier, fencer, tennis player, and pianist. He enjoyed flying gliders and deep-sea fishing. His favorite place to ski was Kitzbuhel, Austria. He skied into his 70s and played tennis into his 80s. Richard traveled to over 50 countries and shared that passion for exploration with his wife, children, and grandchildren. Richard and Leann enjoyed spending summers with family and friends at their beach house in Ocean City, NJ.\n\nRichard is survived by his wife Leann; daughter Laura and her husband Eric of Shokan, NY; son Richard of Hockessin, DE; and grandchildren, Raegan, Ellery, Tripp, and Adam. He is also survived by his brother Ted of New Castle, DE, and sister Mary Ellen Cummings of Ithaca, NY. He is predeceased by his brother Ben Zolper, of Wilmington, DE."
