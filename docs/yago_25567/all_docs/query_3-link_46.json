        "text": "Sian Brooke has appeared in various primetime dramas over the years, including the psychological thriller Doctor Foster, popular detective show Sherlock, and of course, BBC One's smash hit police series Blue Lights, which returns with its second season on Monday night. But did you know that her husband isn't a stranger to the small screen either?\n\nRead on to find out more about the star's family life.\n\nSian, 44, is married to actor and director Bill Buckhurst, who has appeared in several major television shows over the years.\n\nIn 2003, he appeared in three episodes of the ITV soap Coronation Street, playing a character named Andrew, before going on to land minor roles in various series, including Doctors, New Tricks and Father Brown. He also featured in the 2012 James Bond film, Skyfall.\n\nViewers may recognise Bill as Mr Allcock from EastEnders, a role he played for seven episodes in 2010. His most recent acting credit is the 2017 action film starring Jackie Chan, The Foreigner, in which he played an airport police officer.\n\nBill has also spent some time behind the camera, having directed several episodes of Hollyoaks in 2022 and 2023, as well as the 2018 drama film, Pond Life, starring Daisy Edgar-Jones, and the West End production of Sister Act.\n\nWhile Sian remains fairly private about her personal life, we do know that the couple share two sons, Ben and Archie, and are thought to reside in southwest London.\n\nSian sometimes shares glimpses of her home life on her Instagram page. In April last year, the actress praised her husband for his work on Sister Act, which was nominated for an Olivier Award. \"What a night….. totally hanging on the coat tails of my incredibly talented husband whose show Sister Act was nominated for an Olivier. I’m beyond proud of you Bill!\" she penned.\n\nShe also marked her husband's birthday in May 2022 by posting a sweet selfie of the pair on social media. The caption read: \"Happy Birthday to this incredible man! We love the bones of you x.\""
