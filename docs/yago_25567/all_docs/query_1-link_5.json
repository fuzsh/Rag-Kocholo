        "text": "It's hard to believe that Adam Chandler, one of Pine Valley's wealthiest men, hails from a place called Pigeon Hollow and has a past working with carnivals. He grew up with Pete Cooney, who later changed his name to Palmer Cortlandt, and the two continued to do battle, but this time in business. Their rivalry began when Pete took an interest in Adam's sister, Charlotte.\n\nAdam has had a long string of romances and marriages, and most have ended in disaster because of underhanded plots, evil schemes and his insatiable need for control. He attempted to swindle Natalie, blackmailed Erica, and tried to drive Dixie, the mother of his son, crazy in order to gain custody of the child.\n\nLiza Colby had her eye on Tad Martin, and Adam wanted Brooke English, so Liza teamed with Adam to destroy the relationship of the two. The plan backfired when their own planned marriage wasn't halted as they hoped, and they ended up legally wed. Although the marriage was a sham, they eventually slept together, and Liza got pregnant. Both were elated and realized they did have feelings for one another. When Liza was traveling on a corporate jet and lost the child because of a mechanical malfunction, she blamed him and filed for divorce.\n\nStress and unhappiness caused Adam to suffer a stroke, and Liza rushed to his bedside. But both had too much pride to admit how they truly felt, so the divorce was finalized.\n\nAdam's meek and mild twin brother, Stuart, was on the receiving end of Adam's nastiness when he paraded a string of Marian Colby's ex-lovers in front of him to convince Stuart what a tramp she was. It didn't work, and he and Marian wed, and remain happy.\n\nLiza, still grieving for her lost child, convinced Dr. Jake Martin to artificially inseminate her. Adam overheard, bought the clinic and switched his sperm for Jake's. He kept the trade a secret, but was later blackmailed by the evil doctor, David Hayward. Eventually Adam and Liza remarried, and little Colby was born, with Liza still believing that Jake was the father. The truth was eventually revealed.\n\nAdam's previous wife, Dixie, had run off to Europe while pregnant with Tad's child, and was reported killed in a car accident. Adam turned his wrath on the Martin clan for trying to steal his son, JR, but Adam's evil doings turned the young man against him. JR delved into drugs and got into trouble with the law, but met Babe Carey, fell hard, and they wed. Adam enlisted the help of money-hungry, Mary Smythe, to help break them up, feeling that Babe was only interested in the Chandler fortune. She failed.\n\nDuring an unhappy moment in JR and Babe's marriage, she slept with his half-brother, Jaime, and when her pregnancy test was positive, she didn't know who had fathered the baby. It proved to be JR, and Babe gave birth at the same time that Bianca Montgomery bore her daughter, Bess. The two women were stranded in a mountain cabin, and during a rescue, one baby was presumed killed in the helicopter crash, and Babe, in her delirium, was convinced that she had given birth to a daughter. In truth, the helicopter pilot stole the male child to replace the child his sister had lost, but that's a whole other story on One Life to Live.\n\nWhile Bianca grieved the loss of her child, JR and Adam doted on little Bess, until the truth was revealed through a series of DNA tests. Bess was eventually returned to her real mother, and Jamie and Babe kidnapped little Adam back from Llanview, but JR won custody through the courts. Babe's mother, Krystal, took responsibility for the kidnapping and ended up in prison. Babe was falling back in love with JR.\n\nAdam was suspicious of the new nanny JR hired to look after little Adam, and Babe, vying for more time with the baby, agreed to help prove Di was a fake if Adam would help get Krystal released from jail. He agreed, and in the end, the nanny, claiming to be Dixie, was revealed for the fake she was. In reality, she was Dixie's sister.\n\nWith Adam's political connections, Krystal was released and moved into the Chandler mansion. In a drunken stupor, the two wed, but their animosity toward one another eventually blossomed into true feelings, and to everyone's surprise, they renewed their vows at JR and Babe's remarriage. Adam is happily awaiting the birth of his daughter, Charlotte, clueless to the fact that the baby is actually Tad Martin's.\n\nAdam learned at the last minute - just before Krystal went into labor - that Charlotte was actually Tad's child. He kicked Krystal out of the mansion and burned everything he had purchased for the baby. When Krystal went into labor, he threw her a dead cell phone and left the mansion. Krystal was alone but when Colby came home she helped with the delivery. Adam remained distant and decided to get back at Krystal and Tad by kidnapping the child. He helped Janet Green escape from the mental institution and told her she could have the baby. When she learned he was really planning to sell it, she kidnapped Jenny and the baby nearly died from a reaction. At the last minute, Amanda and Jamie found the child. During this time, Amanda delivered a box of things from Wildwind to Adam; inside was the adoption record proving Kathy Mershon was Kate Martin.\n\nAdam kept up his stance, refusing to even talk to Krystal or admit any wrongdoing. Since no one could connect him with the kidnapping, he was off the hook. Amanda, however, found proof that he was involved but instead of going to the authorities, she blackmailed Adam for $5 million!\n\nNear the Christmas holidays, Adam realized he still loved Krystal and wanted her back but she wouldn't even talk to him. He began impersonating Stuart to get close to her and the two actually shared a kiss. When Krystal realized he was pretending to be Stuart, she tried to make him see that she still loved him and he could love Jenny. Adam wouldn't admit to anything. Krystal decided she needed to cut her ties to him and married Tad.\n\nOnce she was married, Adam realized he couldn't stop loving Krystal and began trying to woo her back. She wouldn't even talk to him. Colby say how twisted Adam was, too, and decided to move in to Krystal and Tad's place. Eventually she moved back home because she saw how broken Adam was. JR moved back home, too.\n\nDixie began haunting Adam soon after, hoping that he would come forward with the information that Kathy Mershon, Julia's ward, was actually Tad's daughter Kate. Adam refused so Dixie made him appear to be crazy. JR actually had him committed for a short time. When Tad was shot at Jesse Hubbard's wedding, Adam realized how wrong he was. He came up with a plan to tell Tad the truth but not to admit he had known all along. Tad and Kathy were united and Dixie told Adam he had saved his soul.\n\nAdam began working hard to win Krystal's heart. Krystal remained with Tad, though. Colby soon go into a bind when it seemed that she was part of a hit-and-run in which Richie Novak was killed. Adam had Colby's car demolished and tried to protect her but Jesse discovered the truth. The evidence wound up clearing Colby but Adam never admitted his guilt.\n\nAbout this time, JR and Babe began working their way back to one another and decided to take over Fusion. Adam learned about it and wanted in but didn't tell them he was actually conspiring with Petey Cortlandt to win the company for himself and cut out JR and Babe altogether. They worked together to poison the new Bella perfume.\n\nKendall figured things out - to a point. She thought Adam was after the company and accused him of that when word of the tainted Bella perfume came out. She convinced Erica to spy on Adam for her. Adam insisted he was innocent; JR and Babe decided to start fresh in San Diego. Adam had them subpoenaed for his lawsuit of Fusion because of the tainted perfume. They returned as tornadoes hit Pine Valley; Adam and Erica were trapped in the Chandler tunnels and survived the weather system. Adam admitted everything to Erica. They were rescued but learned that Babe was killed. Adam began trying to make things right with JR.\n\nWhile under the influence of drugs administered by David Hayward, Adam shot his brother Stuart and killed him. It took months before he clearly remembered the event. Annie, who stood by him throughout, became his wife. However JR didn't approve of the union and slept with his step mother she wasn't good for him. Adam dumped Annie, turned his back on JR and left town with Brooke English.\n\nAdam returned in 2011 after JR started on a downward spiral, which included losing the house and the company. While home, Adam discovered that David had been keeping Stuart alive since the shooting. Stuart woke up for good once Adam was by his side."
