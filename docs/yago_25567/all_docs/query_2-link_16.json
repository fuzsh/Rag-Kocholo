        "text": "Customer Loyalty is overlooked these days. Many businesses focus on onboarding new customers & they forget about rewarding the loyalty of their existing customers. These are the individuals that helped you grow when your business was just starting out. These are the individuals that believed in you when nobody else would. But you're in a position now where you've got good revenue and you're constantly thinking about \"How can I onboard the next 100 customers?\" The mindset is wrong. Yes, you need to focus on new customers, HOWEVER, if you didn't have your existing customers, you wouldn't be in the position you are in today. We can all learn a lot about Customer Loyalty from the Automotive Industry. Every customer is treated equally. Over the years, we've seen the automotive space develop some unique practices to ensure all of their customers, new and old, are rewarded for their loyalty and trust in the businesses. Since Web3 is still super new, it's important that we learn from existing industries and implement their techniques and strategies to help us all build a better Web3 for the future. Therefore, when Theodor Dantchev of Infinity Collectors Ltd reached out and asked me to Co-Host a LinkedIn Live focused on Rewarding Customer Loyalty, it was a no-brainer that we should source talented business owners from the Automotive space to help us convey a powerful message to our audience. On Wednesday 15th, Theodor & I will be going live on LinkedIn Audio with 4 extremely talented Automotive business owners to discuss the importance of Customer Loyalty and how we can implement these strategies into Web3-related businesses. Our speakers include: Brooke English - GM, Coastal Chevrolet Cadillac Nissan Shaun Baker - Founder, Young Timers Garage (YTG) Joshua Laurent - Managing Partner, Country Classic Cars Walter Laimer - Nostalgic - Classic Car Travel If you're serious about the development of your business & you're willing to learn new techniques and strategies to reward your customer Loyalty, this is the event for you.
