You can’t have it, you can’t have it You can’t have what you want You can’t hide it, you can’t hide it You can’t hide what you are Back then all those years ago My hand was a hammer, my heart was a stone That skin’s been shed, been haunted since By heavy heart, by phantom limb But for as long as I live... You can’t have it, you can’t have it You can’t have what you want You can’t hide it, you can’t hide it You can’t hide what you are For as long as I live I can’t take back anything In Your Light Sanctuary is a mill for the grist A moment spent under peace and quiet An open window with the wind blowing in Right there, right then, your sanctuary ends Off and On a life recollected in flashes The way the light hits the undersides of your eyelids Come and gone with the lift and the lower of your lashes Between the iris and the eyelid In your light, in your light In your light, in your light If it floats away, I’ll follow after it Blown in through a window open Cause what am I if not just dust, just dust Off and On a life recollected in flashes The way the light hits the undersides of your eyelids Come and gone with the lift and the lower of your lashes Between the iris and the eyelid Why not warm inside a while and lay your boots to dry And then where you wake where you are will be where you were in the first place And all I’ve done may brown may rust If it floats away, I’ll follow it And if I lose its scent, I've still got all it left me with All I’ve done may brown, may rust What am I if not just dust, just dust? In your light, in your light In your light, in your light On and On you can’t turn in on yourself On and On you can’t turn in on yourself Pull Me Under Got me by the leg, Got me by the toe Can't keep my head above the water Got my neck, Got my throat Can't keep my head above the water Pull me under, pull me under All that flees is fair all the leaves forgiven All that, all that, I can't keep it All that, all that, I can't keep it All that stays will suffer Left alive but breathing under Water, water Can't keep my head above the water Pull me under, pull me under The motorboat moans in baritone Magnetawan harvest Song sung slow Magnetawan harvest Magnetawan Harvest Got him by the neck Got him by the throat Canopy covering it all Branches on branches on branches above And from the back of the boat There comes a mournful tone Got him by the neck, got him by the throat Your chances are low Pull me under, pull me under Pull me under, pull me under The motorboat moans in baritone Magnetawan harvest Song sung slow Magnetawan harvest Magnetawan Harvest In deep, in deep, drowned in the deep end I bleed for it, as ever, in over my head I reach for it, I reach for it, I reach for it As ever, in over my head Pull me under, pull me under Pull me under the boat Warden Warden, warden, warden Go to sleep Wake up in the morning Roll-call calling for Rolling rain on the horizon Warnin', warnin', warnin' About a rain that never comes Oh warden, warden, warden Gonna be waiting a long time A long time The Shaky embraces Of haunted house generations Come home everyday with grey driftwood hands I wanna make 10 new holes in the ground Start over again Uou're like a house that grew up boarded up Straight out of the ground Loosen up, liberate, tighten up, straight ahead Joyful, tragic, runaround When the world was old and we were young We wanted to care and not care in a good way Bent back to bear it how well you wear it Swept back by the sweep of your own sway Bent back to bear it how well you wear it Scented by the sweet of your own spray A real living promise land Is a draft coming through the door Milk and honey contraband You take in vain for something more Shovelin' smoke in your own home, on your own time Hang the load out on the line A lifetime to the simplest things When you follow the wrong signs The wrong signs. Say Yeah Seeing that face in the window gave him pause And made his blood run like A screen door banging in the wind He said, \"it finally found me... Unsuspecting and alone in the house That wore with age as I grew up That splintered like a muscle from the bone Away from the ground beneath me And when the moment arrives There's no amount of run and hide that can bluff the human blindside Of sooner or later Now it's comin' to find you All around ahead and behind you Now it's comin' to find you All around ahead and behind you Part of me knew it would show up Part of me hoped that it wouldn't But now I see it comin' When the moment arrives There's no amount of run and hide that can bluff the human blindside Of sooner or later Now it's comin' to find you All around ahead and behind you Now it's comin' to find you All around ahead and behind you He said the screen door's swingin’ harder now There's a frosting on the glass (It finally found me) Finally, it found me out And there inscribed in his breath it said Soon what's come to collect you Later on will come to protect you Sooner or later He said the screen door's swinging harder now He said the screen door's swinging harder now I've been found out Open Flame Cut away, cut through The lightning veins, the thunder moves Calling for rain, now a river's let loose It's coming in waves Now the devil's come to roost This devil will lure you in A shower of gifts With a vote of confidence cast and then complimented Lays to rest, your most sordid sins And claims your past may forgive you if Only your body can stand in lieu Can stand to lose Can stand for you An open flame To rid of, to rid of Whatever you've got, whatever you've got Whatever you've got to burn Throw it on the fire Throw it on the Open flame All lit up, all lit up Whatever you've got, whatever you've got Whatever you've got to burn off Throw it on the fire Throw it in the middle the middle the middle of the fire And in the air before the lighting strikes Though it deafens me, the thunder breeds a peace Unholy beast, please, don't spare me Douse my quarters in gasoline A bit of black 'round the corners Won't scare me off that easy I don't need this darkness and doubt I'll greet him with two shrugged shoulders I've only a body to keep These bones have been rattling Too long to hold up Only a body to keep Lay it down before me in ashes Lay it down before me in ashes An open flame To rid of, to rid of Whatever you've got, whatever you've got Whatever you've got to burn Throw it on the fire Throw it on the Open flame All lit up, all lit up Whatever you've got, whatever you've got Whatever you've got to burn off Throw it on the fire Throw it in the middle the middle the middle of the fire\n\nOr So I Dreamed A night of fitful dreaming The day in such a way beyond believing Uphill along no path at all with a nature hard to bear A good man turned bad, badder than the baddest man And his fullness fears unrelief and relief Now he’s doing double time for drawing blood and keeping love alive in grief Oh, marvel at the sight and the sound Of a love that grew up boarded up straight out of the ground Or so it seemed Had a dream in which my garden overgrew my house one year Put my faith in evolution ’cause it said nothing is pure Took a broken window man in abandoned house embrace And lay there in a reminiscent seizure of a long forgotten place And it seemed that the sight and the sound Like an avalanche of memory would have us digging up when up was down Oh, marvel at this fight that I’ve found For a love that grew up boarded up straight out of the ground Or so I dreamed An image like a dying word A memory like a dying fire The sun rising on your resting place Shines on me like a friendly liar An image like a dying word A memory like a dying fire The sun rising where you lay Adrenaline One foot out front and one foot followin' after it Heart-rate racin', I think I heard hollerin' Off in the distance, I did I heard, I heard screamin' And if I pry your fingers from her You can bet your final breath That the last man you'd want to meet is upon thee The sudden blow I plant upon you won't Be the last thing to pass through your skull No, but you can bet it will be a suitable penance Anything goes So you'd better hope beyond hope beyond hope that you didn't That you never laid your hands upon her You've gotta know, goddammit, who I am That I've been, I've been listenin' in The knuckle-splittin' blow I plant upon you won't Be the last thing to pass through your skull No, but you can bet it will have a beautiful finish Anything goes, hot-headed adrenaline In sudden blows, I'll let it take hold and then I'll let go Anything goes So you'd better hope beyond hope beyond hope that you didn't That you never laid your hands upon her You've gotta know, goddammit, who I am That I heard, I hear everythin' Adrenaline Anything goes Adrenaline Cliffs & Coves Your cliffs, your coves, all cloaked in night Bull rushes and reeds do flutter and fly The pressure may change, I think it just might Be rough if by sea and red in the sky Your ship, at shore, by tether and tie Wake washes and weaves and pummels its sides The tides may change, may retreat, may subside But one eye's on the beach and one's in the sky Cold wind, cold wind Blowin' in, blowin' in All clatter and clamour All powerful fist Low cliffs, low cliffs Do hold do protect Oh mountain resist, oh mountain resist Oh mountain resist, oh mountain resist Chupacabra I live inside a body left to wander Soon there’ll be nothing harder than the simple life I know One I, I show One I, I know I’m awake inside a city unawoken Built by invisible hands that shake the sense of signs I know One I, I show One I, I know Oh, I don’t know where My body goes Oh, I don’t know which I I will show A night of fitful dreaming Drawn inside a cave of lights A frame inside a frame inside A body left to wander where No path at all is a nature hard to bear Born out of a pair of open hands intent to gather what I love and what I let become itself Take it to mean More than it seems I worry that I’ll miss out I worry I’ll be misled Toward a statement Fit together too fast Fit together too slight For reply We think the way we We think away the soul A night of fitful dreaming Drawn inside a cave of lights A frame inside a frame inside a frame of mind misled And when the day comes And I’m alone I’m at a loss which I I will show Oh, I don’t know Where my body goes Oh, I don’t know which I I will show One I show, One I know\n\nInside / Outside I guess you don't have to go out If you really don't wanna go out But you could use a walk And lift those shoulders up too Like you wanna Make sure those fangs are showin And greet 'em with a grin that glows red With total radiance Just keep the gradient tuned And keep it on 'em Easier said It's different to do it The thought was well meant But it's different to do it Yourself You used to be a wolf in sheep skin clothes Where did the wolf Where did the wolf Where did the wolf go Well god only knows Something's out there singing like a kettle Something's howlin out in the backyard That rotten ring shrieks so sour, so unsettled Something's howlin out in the backyard Could be sheets of metal all whistlin together Something's howlin out in the backyard And the song it sings tells of demons and of devils Something's howlin out in the backyard And the light that shines from a belly bright yellow Brings (ah) creatures of the night out to bellow To wince and to bark, to coo and to caw To treat you as the yellow-bellied dweller that you are Oh, something's out there screaming like a kettle Something's howlin out in the backyard A racket, a racket, uproarious revel! Something's howlin out in the backyard Could be throat-worn ghosts, lost stalking rebels Something's howlin out in the backyard With one voice raised as a devistating treble Something's howlin out in the backyard And I haven't seen the (ah) wolf in ages now Not even when the mynah birds come calling out You used to have a howl that sent shivers through town You can hardly get a wimper out now Where did the wolf Where did the wolf Where did the wolf go? Well god only knows Steamroller Oh my oh, I'll go for what you know Who I own I know, I owe who knows who I own my home or owe who knows who I owe Why own when you can just Sell it Oh my oh, I'll go for what you know Buy the city sell the farm Either or / Either or Either or / Either or not Cause I could throw a rock And put a hole In the yard behind the beehive rows Set along my road Straighter than the treeline grows We'll see this country in a car Dinner in dining halls Give to the grind and haul out And let 'em tear the barn down And let 'em put up A new line of beehive rows Well, I just couldn't call it my own any more When they blocked up the road Where the first would go So let's die out I know not to meddle To keep off the path this steamroller runs Been all set and settled Since day one they've wanted What I own I know, I owe who knows Who I owe I know, I own who knows Those gloves just take 'em off Move before the city moves to us And sucks the simple parts of living out from under us Move before the city moves to us, to us, to us So let's die out. The greatest forest fire burned our forest down 2nd 4th World War For all those millmen who cut their teeth Whose minds were made up on roof and feed I’ll come and I’ll leave Aching from a night in the city It might ruin me now, but I’d probably already be ruined For skin burned black with coal and grease That stuck to their lungs whenever they’d breathe I’ll come and I’ll leave Tempted by the lights of the city No clowning around T onight we’re going out to get ruined And I probably woulda never have thought If it weren’t written on metal That this is very old ground that you’re running from Can’t look for long, gotta be left and gone by five To be half-seas over by nine And bleeding drunk by midnight Forever indebted to the feats of our fathers But carry it on your back, it’s a sure collapse Laid out flat, gaspin’ All the trouble you attract With cause to match Would bring a quick collapse If you always had to carry that If the gear wheel goes (There’s gonna be a flood comin’) When the wallower rolls (There’s gonna be a flood comin’) Next thing you know (There’s gonna be a flood comin’ on) And the water won’t spare us (The water won’t spare us) If it comes to get us (If it comes to get us) And it won’t let up ‘til all that’s dear and precious is gone And our hearts all screech a hault Whenever there’s a flood coming on And when that flood comes it comes as a canon One that lets you catch the shot in your hands But just to send its shocking tidal wave Through every bone in your body Dealt our hands, mine’s low on luck If you’re all going out you can sign me up Seems the only time that I can collect my thoughts Is if I’m bleeding, stinking drunk (so drink up) We’ll admit in the names of our fathers But carry it on your back, it’s a sure collapse Laid out flat, gaspin’ All the trouble you attract, with cause to match Would bring a quick collapse If you always had to carry that And even though the doubt we all felt Came to prove itself The overflow came down With a force we never dreamed off When that rolling canon shot Rolls along again, our guard is up All the damage and all we’ve lost Lost it all with a canon shot Shutters Like water from a whale spout The spraying veils its ground What's dug inside the body A black gasp bubbling out Oh as the ocean is bled dry A mountain is a mouth eating up the sky Oh as the ocean is bled dry A valley cuts the tongue from its gullet Who knows who will say what now? Old as the water we sigh A mountain is a mouth eating up the sky Oh as the ocean is bled dry A valley cuts the tongue from its gullet Who knows who will say what now? Sigh along and our sighs align We'll set a table and drink some wine Fine tether of the moon-yard view You pause as the pleasure misconstrues Whats real and what's entombed Sigh along or silence be Be our song And it calms me down Don't try to calm me down Hey hoorah Don't try to calm me down And the whale is sleeping The tongue's inclined And we spout and speak to reveal the rush as it bubbles out And it calms me down Weave Myself A Dress The one whose shame is left too long Is the one whose name is lost along the Clear and shallow shore A reflection in the water stays The thing it grew upon is an ashen sail No more Turn straw to gold how can you hold Onto the courage to own a name To think of raising up out of these seas The thing that I will raise up is a dress I weave myself Of freshly plucked anemones So collect the flowers In the shallow water all along the shore And take them away with you The eye and a reflection of an eye Is what that flower sees A space we've learned here too Turn straw to gold What can you hold onto the courage to own a name To think of raising up out of these seas The thing that I will raise up is a dress I weave myself Of freshly plucked anemones And I'll be in the water See my hand come through the water And their eyes do close up tight And when they open again a sail is born"
