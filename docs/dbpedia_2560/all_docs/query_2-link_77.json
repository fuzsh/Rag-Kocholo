When she meets him, Senta’s fate is sealed. This new-to-Chicago production at Lyric Opera of Chicago will bring to life some of the composer’s most magnificent and emotional music, including thrilling, spectacular choruses. Leading an outstanding cast are Tomasz Konieczny (previously the title role in Lyric’s spellbinding Wozzeck) and Tamara Wilson (the radiant heroine of Il trovatore and Ernani), in Christopher Alden’s electrifying production, with Music Director Enrique Mazzola conducting his first Wagner at Lyric.\n\nAn Evening with Audra McDonald (October 6, 2023) – Experience the inimitable talent of Audra McDonald in concert with the Lyric Opera Orchestra conducted by Andy Einhorn in a spellbinding evening of songs, from theater classics to new works and seldom-heard gems. Winner of six Tony Awards, two Grammy Awards and an Emmy Award, Audra McDonald possesses a “lustrous lyric soprano” (The New York Times) and an incomparable gift for dramatic truth-telling. This one-night-only performance is not to be missed.\n\nThe Daughter of the Regiment(November 4-25, 2023) –Lyric Opera of Chicago is delighted to bring this production of Donizetti’s The Daughter of the Regiment — bel canto opera’s equivalent of vintage champagne — to the city for the first time. Marie, the lovable, irrepressible spirited heroine — a foundling, raised by soldiers — loves handsome Tonio. Things get complicated when the Marquise carts her off to refine her with a “proper” education. In one exhilarating number after another, Marie throws off coloratura flourishes like shooting stars, while her tenor sweetheart pops out nine high Cs in a single aria! Bel canto superstar Lawrence Brownlee and comedic veteran Alessandro Corbelli partner with the dazzling Lisette Oropesa in her eagerly awaited Lyric debut. The marvelously stylish Speranza Scappucci conducts Laurent Pelly’s quick-witted, uproarious production.\n\nJanáček’s Jenůfa (November 12-26, 2023) –Janáček’s Jenůfa is a dark and stunning masterpiece, both musically and dramatically. In this profoundly moving story, the Kostelnička secretly drowns her foster-daughter Jenůfa’s illegitimate child, hoping to save Jenůfa — and herself — from shame and humiliation. When the murder is discovered, the Kostelnička accepts the consequences, but Jenůfa ends the opera with hope for the future. Performing Janáček’s magnificent score at Lyric Opera of Chicago will be an enthralling cast led by two of the finest dramatic sopranos of our time: opera’s newest superstar, Lise Davidsen, and the legendary Nina Stemme, Lyric’s sensational Elektra in 2019. Czech maestro Jakob Hrůša will bring unique authenticity to this unforgettable music, leading Claus Guth’s mesmerizing production.\n\nLifeline Theatre kicks off its 2023-24 season with Cat’s Cradle (September 12 – October 22, 2023).
