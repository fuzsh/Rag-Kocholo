Magma Fields\n5. Öskubrot\n6. Gas Warning\n7. New Shield Loop\n\nA Note from Lawrence English on Vakning\r\n\r\n Nothing is fixed, nothing is permanent, nothing holds for anyone, any time or anything.\r\n\r\nAs stable as we might choose to think it is, this planet is anything but that. A paper thin crust, the zone in which we find ourselves, and mostly concern ourselves with, exists as a modest veil cloaking a dynamic seismic turbulence that is as powerful as it is unknowable.\r\n\r\nThere are moments though where ruptures occur. The pressure from within carves its way to, and through, the surface of the planet simultaneously delivering destruction and virgin landscapes, as primordial as any we might care to imagine. It is here, in these places, where we can literally see the living planet, that geologic time is condensed and world building is made visible, and audible to us, in an unrestrained and provocative detail.\r\n\r\nThese volcanic ruptures, such as those captured on Vakning by Francesco Fabris and Ben Frost, speak to the very living geology of Earth. These recordings, captured at close range, exist at a nexus where liquid rock becomes solid. They capture moments of transformation, of obliteration and of creation, often all at once.\r\n\r\nThese are recordings of a living, material planet, dynamic and unrestrained.",
