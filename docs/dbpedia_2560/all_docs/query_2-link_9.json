        "text": "Great write-up Frank. I doubt that anyone is going to match up with my list though I've run into a few from time to time that have overlap with significant sections of my musical tastes. I'm a couple of years younger than you are but not enough for that to be much of a factor. Geography is probably an important consideration. I have always lived in eastern Massachusetts though I did accumulate about 6 months in Texas during business trips 1986-1987.\n\nTo understand some of the twists and turns in my musical journey, the aspects of radio listening and of personal connections - both of similar importance - should be reviewed.\n\nPeople in my family (parents, brother) had varying degrees of influence.\n\nMy dad was 100% classical. He listened to Boston locals WCRB and WGBH as well as WQXR (1560) out of New York City. Though of (Northern) Irish descent, he had developed a love of Italian culture during his World War II service. He was a regular listener to Metropolitan Opera broadcasts on Saturday afternoon. At one time 680 WNAC (later WRKO) covered those. In lighter classical he enjoyed Leroy Anderson (of \"Sleigh Ride\", \"Syncopated Clock\", and \"Waltzing Cat\" fame). Enjoyable to me too. Seems like Kate Smith's patriotic songs, Sousa marches, and Leroy Anderson were part of my earliest musical memories beyond typical children's songs.\n\nMy mother, though also enjoying classical, trended more towards Broadway / Hollywood / American Songbook style stuff and what I'd call \"schmaltz\" pop Irish of the '30s/'40s. John McCormack was the king of that. Daniel O'Donnell would be a contemporary version.\n\nMy brother, a year younger than I, had fairly similar tastes to mine up through high school. By the time he was getting ready for college, he had developed a much deeper interest in jazz and blues than I did. He was also a bit more intense on classical. He and his buddies would hang out and listen to a lot of Grateful Dead, the Band, and other music that fit into the later-defined \"Americana\" genre that would eventually be linked to Dave Matthews and Phish. I worked up some interest in that but wasn't as raving crazy for it compared to Celtic/British folk.\n\nSome of the radio influences on music are covered here (\"How I Got Started in Radio and Electronics\"):\n\nhttps://www.qsl.net/wa1ion/wa1ion_history.htm\n\nDXing, at least of a casual variety, was not a weird or esoteric thing with young people circa 1960. AM was where the hit music was. At night there were a number of skip Top 40 stations strong enough to be heard just fine even on cheap radios.\n\nBoston was a weak soul music town compared to nearby (~200 miles) New York City. That got a lot of kids listening to 570 WMCA, 770 WABC, 1010 WINS, and 1050 WMGM. Signals from 1540 WPTR Albany, NY and 1520 WKBW Buffalo, NY were also good at night.\n\nWhen my family vacationed in the summer on Cape Cod, the New York City stations were local grade day and night. We typically spent two weeks near West Dennis Beach. DXing and entertainment listening were both enhanced.\n\nThe Boston area radio market did have some very talented personalities, especially in the '60s and '70s. For those of you on this list who work, or had worked, in broadcasting, especially those of you with New England and New York connections (Scott Fybush, Paul Walker, others?) some of the names mentioned below will likely \"ring a bell.\"\n\nTurning the clock back to the early '60s when I had really got serious about both entertainment listening and DXing, Boston had four major Top 40s: 1030 WBZ, 1150 WCOP, 1430 WHIL, and 1510 WMEX. Also worth mentioning was \"soul\" WILD on 1090. Both WHIL and WILD were hobbled by being daytime only stations.\n\nWMEX did not have a very good signal at night into the western suburbs: 1500 WTOP (now WFED) and 1520 WKBW (now WWKB) chewed WMEX from each side. Arnie Ginsburg was the best known WMEX DJ, truly a legend. As Murray-the-K did (on WINS NY), Arnie would have oldies blocks so kids that were too young to be paying much attention to things in the '50s could be \"schooled\" - especially in Doo-Wop. WMEX did have a screamer-loud signal at the local sea beaches. At the Revere Beach rides and arcades WMEX boomed out of big speakers to compete with the screams of kids on the roller coaster. The Everly Bros. \"Temptation\" blasting out over the beach in '61, now that's one excellent music memory.\n\nWCOP was located near my Arlington, MA home, thus the big-signal Top 40. They were in the Plough Inc. broadcaster family and, having southern connections, tended to work a bit more country into their mix than did the other local stations. Hence good coverage of Conway Twitty's \"Million Teardrops\" (1960), Patsy Cline's \"I Fall to Pieces\" (1961), etc. The after school program with Ed Mitchell was a whole level more zany than anything else on Boston radio. He'd \"zing\" songs he didn't like by changing speed, dropping in Stan Freberg or Spike Jones tidbits, or inserting stuff from a Radio Shack sound effects record - train wrecks etc. \"Jimmy Love\" (Cathy Carroll, 1961), a weepy teen tragedy song, was a perfect target for Mitchell's on-air antics. This was around the time that Mitchell was doing meet-and-greet road trips to see \"the kids.\" On a steamy hot July '61 day, he showed up in Belmont Center in a Karmann-Ghia plastered with WCOP stickers. He tossed non-hit (basically unknown junk) 45s out to the crowd. Some got caught, some didn't. I was there. It was fun for a 12 year old. Unfortunately WCOP bowed out of Top 40 by mid-1962.\n\nWBZ tended to have a more \"middle of the road\" orientation. Carl DeSuze, their morning man, was almost as easy listening as MoR WHDH 850 of Jess Cain and Bob Clayton fame. The later-in-the-day WBZ jocks covered rock somewhat better. WBZ annoyingly stuck talk shows in during some parts of the evening. The station upgraded its image with younger listeners during the 1963-1964 stretch. Bruce Bradley was your power-pop / rock guy. He was looking at the high school / college local garage band scene, discovering the Rockin' Ramrods, Teddy & the Pandas, the Barbarians, Barry & the Remains, and several others. He hosted \"Battle of the Bands\" competitions at Boston Garden. Jefferson Kaye, who later went to WKBW Buffalo, was a very important part of the staff especially because of his Sunday night \"Hootenanny\" folk show 1963-1966. Besides myself, a number of my Arlington High School classmates were immediately hooked on folk. Jefferson Kaye's show was where many of us heard Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Joni Mitchell, Gordon Lightfoot, Phil Ochs, Jesse Colin Young, Richard & Mini Farina, Jim Kweskin, Eric Andersen, and many others for the first time. Then there was the Nightlight Show with Dick Summer with its quirky and emotionally involving content that could range from comedic to dead serious. Add to that impeccable music selections. Dick's show got many of us through wee hours term paper writing and exam cramming.\n\nOutside Boston were a number of \"rimshot\" stations worth note.\n\n1310 WORC Worcester, MA had the inside track on the British Invasion months before it became a household term. WORC top names were Bob Garcia and Johnny Gardner (later John H. Garabedian of WMEX early '70s, and \"Open House Party\" later on).\n\n550 WPAW (later WXTR, WGNG) Pawtucket, RI had Chuck Stevens, another crazy-man a la Ed Mitchell. Breaking broadcast etiquette of the time - never mentioning other radio stations - he'd throw zingers at Providence area personalities on WICE, WRIB, WPRO, etc. and he'd even goof on WBZ as it had a close to local quality signal in Pawtucket-Providence. Seems to me the term \"Carl DeSnooze\" was used for 'BZ's DeSuze. DeSuze may not have been picked on if he'd laid off the Mantovani, Frank Chacksfield, and 101 Strings a bit. DeSuze, like mush-master Bill Marlowe, had said unfavorable things about rock 'n' roll. Guess that would put you on the radar.\n\n630 WPRO Providence, RI was another out-of-towner with a fair signal during the day. Salty Brine was the best known personality. South of Boston, around the Norwood Automile (section of Route 1 loaded up with car dealers), it was pretty much a local grade signal.\n\nPersonally speaking, I was scooping in music from all around the world via shortwave and medium wave with my \"antenna farm\" at the edge of Menotomy Rocks Park. In 1961 I could listen to the BBC and hear \"You Don't Know\" by Helen Shapiro: one of the greatest songs from one of the greatest singers.\n\nTravel always pumped up involvement with radio and music. Trips to New York City for Christmas shopping (1963, 1964) and the World's Fair (1964, 1965) have tons of musical memories (and some DX ones) attached.\n\nOne write-up (Dec. 1963):\n\nhttps://www.qsl.net/wa1ion/doc1/nyc_train_trip_dec63.htm\n\nBy 1965, WBZ and WMEX were Boston's Top 40 kingpins. For a long time, not much was happening on the FM side. Late in 1966, WRKO-FM 98.5 put on an automated Top 40 with a \"robot\" providing jingles and minimal announcing. As FM portables were still a bit dodgy in the frequency stability department, WRKO-FM, as well as 99.5 WLLH-FM Lowell, had \"niche\" audiences. Without the personality angle, they were not serious competition for WBZ and WMEX. Few cars had FM then.\n\nThings got more interesting in 1967 when 680 WNAC changed to WRKO. They had 50 kW of low dial position Top 40 blasting into the metro area with no talk show interruptions to mess up delivery of the music \"drug.\" I don't think that DJs on WRKO were as interesting as somebody like Dick Summer; it was more just high energy meat-and-potatoes Top 40 with lots of snappy jingles and a tight playlist without too much \"hippie stuff\" intruding. To their favor, they were probably better on Motown and other soul than WBZ and WMEX. The ratings surged just about the time I was starting at Northeastern University in September. WRKO could be heard playing around campus more than anything else ... for awhile.\n\nBy the spring of 1968, progressive music finally had a home on 104.1 WBCN-FM. Mainstream radio had just been throwing crumbs to innovative rock. It needed better. With adverts and listener reviews running in the Boston Phoenix, Real Paper, and Avatar - newspapers popular at colleges - WBCN's popularity soared. It made a serious dent into WRKO and WMEX numbers, at least in the 18-25 age group. With all the high power competition going on and others (WHDH, WVBF) jumping in on the FM side, WBZ gradually eased back to more of a middle-of-the-road approach with substantial news / talk content. The high energy Top 40 days were in its rearview mirror by the close of the '60s.\n\nIn the early '70s, a little 250 watt daytime station in Cambridge, 740 WCAS, picked up a folk music format. Donna Halper, later a teacher and radio historian, had a superb afternoon show. American folk's glory days are often considered to be the mid '60s when Dylan influenced the Byrds and even to an extent the Beatles. By the early '70s, the serious action in folk was British. Groups with Celtic and medieval / traditional influences sprung up: Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span, Strawbs, Lindisfarne, Pentangle, Renaissance, and others. These hit the turntable on Donna's show and I was gobsmacked. Lead singers Maddy Prior, Sandy Denny, Annie Haslam, and Jacqui McShee had voices straight out of heaven.\n\nMeanwhile over on WBCN, a new DJ Maxanne Sartori quickly became Boston's goddess of rock. She was seriously into the local music scene as bands such as Aerosmith, Boston, the Cars (ex-Captain Swing), and the J. Geils Band were breaking out. Besides the big names, she knew and presented lesser known bands from the college / bar scene. Modern Lovers (of \"Roadrunner\" fame) and Reddy Teddy (\"Ooh Wow\") come to mind. Maxanne was also keenly aware of British and continental Europe trends whether glam (David Bowie, Queen, Nutz), dance-trance-electronic (Moroder, Kraftwerk et al.), or - by mid-decade - punk / New Wave.\n\nIn 1972 I was working in Boston along with several others in their early 20s - Jim Buttomer, Dave Flint, and one or two more. We always had the radio playing. In the afternoon we bopped back and forth between Maxanne on WBCN and Donna on WCAS. At that time female DJs were a rarity but Boston wound up with two of the best. Our work group was convinced that the office was bugged because we'd start talking about a song or group and then, Bang! Within a minute or two it was on the radio. Happened with both shows. Definitely weird.\n\nIn the mid '70s, no longer living with my parents (who'd moved to Cape Cod), I rented an apartment in Waltham with one ham friend, Mark Ryan WA1FAF, and then a house in Sudbury, MA with another ham friend, Chris Leary WA1KTZ. Their tastes in music influenced me to some extent. The July 4, 1975 BBQ in Sudbury was a southern rock bash with Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top, Allman Bros., and Outlaws in high rotation. Non-southern but still bluesy rock from Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin also factored in. Echoing what I'd heard at a big BBQ 14 years earlier, country wasn't missing either. Tom T. Hall's current hit \"I Like Beer\" was part of the scene. Some tunes were played ad-lib from records but a lot was on carefully assembled reel-to-reel party mix tapes for such occasions. Two pairs of Advent speakers blasted the tunes over the neighborhood near Willis Pond.\n\nFour more stations got into the listening mix circa 1976.\n\nHard rock without the \"arty\" stuff was purveyed by 94.5 WCOZ Boston and 107.3 WAAF Worcester. These stations had huge numbers with under-30 male blue-collar factory workers. Southern rock and heavy metal ruled.\n\nOn 1060 AM, Boston DJ John H. Garabedian had launched WGTR in the suburb of Natick, about 16 miles west of Boston. This was a daytime 1 kW station then. The daytime mix was a sort of typical light Top 40. Garabedian's afternoon show had more sizzle both on the rock and high-energy disco sides of things. He picked up on European trends as Maxanne on WBCN also did.\n\n1550 WNTN Newton ran somewhat of a progressive mix for awhile. One of the DJs was on the money with the likes of Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Strawbs, Pink Floyd, and Genesis (the good early stuff). This was another station that had to go off at sunset unfortunately.\n\nI married Mary Lou in 1976. She was from an Italian-American family with some Irish mixed in. The family threw some good backyard parties with Italian music (and, of course, food) in the mix. Mary Lou eventually got me to appreciate Johnny Mathis, Tony Bennett, Perry Como, and Frank Sinatra more. Even as a teen I had occasionally dabbled in standards when listening to 1130 WNEW NYC, often on rainy days of Cape vacations. Sometimes I listened to Bill Marlowe's show on several Boston stations. I had a certain amount of curiosity about World War II era music by artists such as Vera Lynn. My dad had fought in that mess in North Africa and Italy. It did take me awhile to make space for crooners, big bands, and standards in my rock-centric head.\n\nIn late summer 1977. Mary Lou and I went to Ireland for two weeks. A Realistic TRF portable and a Panasonic cassette machine were my sources of music after a day of touring castles, museums, gardens, seashores, breweries etc. I was, of course, immersed in Celtic music that I could find on the radio in addition to my own tapes. 1214 BBC Radio One, 1439 Radio Luxembourg, 566 RTE Ireland, 1367 Manx Radio, 1178 Radio Sweden, low-power Radio Na Gaeltachta locals, as well as a few from Holland and Germany were part of the entertainment mix. New Wave was big then so I heard stuff like \"Gary Gilmore's Eyes\" by the Adverts, \"Spanish Stroll\" by Mink DeVille, and several by Thin Lizzy and Boomtown Rats. Probably some Sex Pistols in there too. Disco / soul was still going big. A thoroughly goofy song remembered from the trip: \"Float On\" by the Floaters. DX with the TRF wasn't half bad. Sligo was the best receiving site for North Americans: many stations came in well just before dawn. 850 WHDH Boston, 1130 WNEW NY, and a couple of the Newfies were total blasters.\n\n850 WHDH from Sligo, Ireland - September 1977\n\nhttps://app.box.com/s/pkvfx281vksh8ag792o8ncwl4szvhuz3\n\nMuch of the '80s and '90s were characterized by heavy workloads including second and third shifts as well as travel. I was in the automatic test equipment business programming and designing hardware interfaces for component and circuit board testers. Raytheon, M/A-COM, and Analog Devices were longer term employers. Crazy shifts and travel had impacts on radio listening and the uptake of new music.\n\nFrank mentioned sort of drifting out of music involvement, at least from the radio, after about 1984. Yet for me the mid '80s up to the mid '90s were absolutely loaded with great tunes. Top 40 in the '70s had been, at best, uneven. This led me off onto various FM rock tangents including southern rock, New Wave / punk, and British folk-rock. The relevance of stations such as WRKO, WMEX, and WVBF was slipping away. Things got recharged in the mid '80s by British synthesizer-heavy bands such as Duran Duran and Depeche Mode in the mainstream and the Smiths (of \"How Soon Is Now\" fame) and Midnight Oil (\"Dreamworld\") on the periphery. There was a lot of basic meat-and-potatoes rock that excelled too: Mellencamp, Springsteen, Bryan Adams for starters. As the '90s broke, another layer of interesting material appeared. Most was linked with FM rock stations but some trickled over into Top 40 land. Bands of note included Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Guns N' Roses, and Green Day. There were a lot of good tunes to blast when pulling out of the work parking lot on a Friday afternoon. \"Dr. Feelgood\" (Motley Crue) anyone?\n\nSecond and third shifts often had me in the tester room in front of the computer by myself or maybe with just one or two others. The coffee flowed freely and the music blasted. Had to make it through the night. Both the radio and customized cassettes were used. Here in eastern MA, 104.1 WBCN was often the music source. Sometimes 101.7 WFNX (though its weaker signal got scratchy around all that RF test gear). On numerous trips to El Paso, TX (1986-1987), 95.5 KLAQ was the hard rocker and 102.1 KPRR covered the dance / rhythmic scene. The dance hit \"Fascinated\" by Company B was crazy-big down there. One of my co-workers, Mark Hallberg, was involved with Boston-area local group October. He brought tapes of the band to overnight work sessions. I was impressed. The group took influences from Yes and Genesis. Mark also had other mix tapes. We listened to a lot of Kate Bush, Brian Eno, Pat Metheny, and Laurie Anderson. I'd pop in some of my Planxty, Horslips, Steeleye Span, etc. stuff. The two of us had good chats about tunes to help the late shifts go by.\n\nTowards the mid/late '90s, the health of my parents was declining. Their house in West Yarmouth, MA was close to a two hour drive from where I was living in the Pinehurst section of Billerica, MA, 15 miles northwest of Boston. My brother and I alternated weekends driving down to help them out. His ride was 3 hours from central MA. On some occasions my wife and my son came along on the trips; sometimes I was by myself. The solo trips had more DX packed into them as I would make beach pit-stops if heading for home around sunset. Solo trips were more music intense as well. 950 WROL had (and still has) the long-running Irish Hit Parade show on Saturday afternoons. John Latchford was one of its original presenters. In the '90s and early 2000s, Matt O'Donnell was the show's #1 DJ (in my opinion). He livened things up with Irish rock and folk from the Corrs, Clannad, Solas, Dervish, Sinead O'Connor, Dolores Keane, Cranberries, Saw Doctors, and quite a few of my other favorites. He toned down the \"Rosie O'Grady\" and \"Wild Irish Rose\" sort of waltz-schmaltz other jocks played. Matt O'Donnell's show was a regular feature of the many Cape Cod rides. If a '90s/'00s era ride was on a Friday night, the \"Back to the '80s\" show on 98.5 WBMX was a sure thing. Lots of energetic hits with few stiffs. Besides caffeine, you'll stay awake rocking to \"Love Me Deadly\" by Lita Ford blasting out of the speakers somewhere deep in the Plymouth pinelands.\n\nGoing into the 21st century, the importance of radio in introducing music - old or new - to me has ratcheted down some. The late Bob Bittner's stations including 1240 WBAS West Yarmouth are a bit of an anomaly. Much of what's played is way too mellow (including \"Muzaky\" instrumentals) but once in a while something truly great gets uncorked. Can't say as much for the main commercial stations I use: 102.9 Pixie (classic rock), 93.5 Frank (mostly '80s hits), and 104.7 Ocean (soft rock). Those big stations are so predictable. DJs might as well be robots. Some acts get way too much play. Exhibit A: Eagles.\n\nI like Adele in pop, Alison Krauss and Miranda Lambert in country, also Mumford & Sons and Phil Phillips. Generally not a whole lot after 2012 has made that big an impression on me. Is this just old fart syndrome or does the summer of 1967 really steamroll the summer of any year starting with a 2? Good stuff is probably out there but I'm not listening to the right station or stream. I have never used Sirius/XM except on a plane when I sampled Willie Nelson Roadhouse and Jimmy Buffett Margaritaville channels.\n\nLinks to YouTube from friends Facebook posts have actually gone ahead of both radio and in-person recommendations in this new post-COVID world of isolation. Dean Bianco, Skip Arey, and Eric Cottrell - all hams / DXers - post a considerable amount of music recommendations on Facebook. Dean is mostly garage, power-pop, and psychedelic. Eric is a Celtic specialist. Skip is all over the place but reliably posts \"Tam Lin\" by Fairport Convention around Halloween and \"Gaudete\" by Steeleye Span around Christmas, so brownie points for that. I should also mention Mike Sanburn who occasionally puts up a pick. Knocked it outta the park a few years ago with \"Live\" by the Merry-Go-Round (Emitt Rhodes' group). A total blast-master from the spring of '67. My long walks would not be complete without that song.\n\nAs with my own listening, more Facebook friends' music recommendations are old than new (new meaning last 10 years more or less). Even at that, some had previously been unknown to me. A few have been good enough to make me buy a CD or download.\n\nI wish radio would be as relevant a force connecting people with great music as it used to be. People would come into work in the morning and talk about what Maxanne had played on their drive or train ride home the previous day. This sometimes superseded usual talking points of weather, news, traffic, sports, stocks, and family drama. If everyone's driving around with their own special playlists, the shared experience goes away. Everyone is less likely to be talking about tunes around the water cooler or coffee machine. A bit sad, I suppose, if someone \"beamed in\" from 50 years ago to see how listening evolved.\n\nSome radio & music links:\n\nhttps://www.qsl.net/wa1ion/doc1/musicradio.htm\n\nMark Connelly, WA1ION | South Yarmouth, MA, USA | FN41vq\n\nIn a message dated 8/21/2023 4:02:44 AM Eastern Daylight Time, fmerrilljr@... writes:\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nMARK! Wow, what a hoot reading your faves list! Incredible, and I was surprised how many I didn't know but, then, I've ALWAYS been primarily a 45s kind of guy, and you obviously go toward LP's and CD's, judging from having so many deep tracks on your list. But, I've rarely had this much fun reading such a list.\n\nThe Beatles are surely my favorite recording artist. I can't think of ANY OTHER ARTIST who did well over 100 (more like the high 100s?) songs that I actually LIKE. I can't say there's another artist that I even KNOW that many songs by, though Elvis Presley would come rather close to that.\n\nAgain, because I haven't TENDED to know album cuts all that often...\n\nThough my list (which I've threatened to put together for decades now, and I'd LOVE to, but the assembly of it would be horrific) is primarily Hot 100 stuff, by no means is that all it is. SiriusXM, especially Little Steven's Underground Garage, has been introducing me to some pretty cool deep tracks, and some fun millennial content, though my cranial filing system's index hasn't stayed caught up and they're not always committed to memory. But, some observations which may include DX comments...\n\na) My list would have a far heavier amount of soul on it. Of course, one can consider that I grew up outside of Detroit. My list would possibly be even more \"souly\" if I had had good access to the Detroit soul stations on 1400 and 1440 [Inkster]. They were somewhat listenable, but my \"random wire\" seemed to have a null smack-to-the-east, which is why from Michigan I had as many TP's as I had TA's. That put 1400 and 1440 into the mud a little, bothered by Saginaw and Bay City respectively in the daytime.\n\nIt would have been even more fun if I was aware of longwires AND if I could have gone southeast (I COULDN'T, the road was there). I would have probably logged 40 or 50 Brazilians when most regionals and clears had little on at 0400 Mondays (by when Brazilians were signing on). I still did \"OK\" from the southeast, not nearly as bad as the east...for example I heard the 50-watt Puerto Ricans (U. S. base stations) on 780, and either 1040 or 1200 (forgot which), Uruguay 1090, etc.\n\nb) My favorites would have more 1950s content, and far less after around 1983 or 1984 when it seemed that radio stations almost universally agree never to announce another song again under penalty of death, or something. It took me until the late 00's to find out that the \"burnout oldie\" I was hearing over and over again was \"Kyrie\" by Mister Mister, for example. Sad.\n\nc) I was surprised to see that I recognized/know EVERY of the thirty doowops that you listed. I was even more surprised to see Tommy Manno listed on there. Was that some kind of hit in Boston?? I ask, because I used to know somebody in Winthrop (which is also a street two short blocks from me, lol) who mentioned liking that song. And, somehow, I heard it at the time. I almost have to think maybe on WBZ? I was definitely a listener, especially to Dick Summer more so after 1962. When I was in 11th grade near Ann Arbor, a girl was taking a petition around school to send to UK to have the Beatles knighted. She could have only heard that from WBZ...\n\nd) Fun seeing Conway Twitty \"A Million Teardrops\" on your Country list! I never found anybody else who knew that song. Incredible \"teener\"! My fave too, of his. Also interesting to see The Everlys \"Gone Gone Gone\" high on your list, which IS my favorite of theirs (and Pat St. John agrees!! - he played it Saturday night on his SiriusXM show and said so).\n\ne) Just a few random artists that are on my list, with these my favorites:\n\nTHE HOLLIES Look Through Any Window (your list) and Come On Back tie at #1.\n\nTHE BEATLES NO CONSISTENT #1 FOR ME, but often it's what has come to be called \"The Abbey Road Medley\". It can also rotate to She's Coming Home, In My Life, Devil In Her Heart, Tell Me Why, Ob-la-di Ob-la-da, maybe even Rocky Raccoon...\n\nTHE YARDBIRDS Happenings Ten Years Time Ago (I did NOT like it when it was out!), though I like EVERYTHING of theirs that I've ever heard.\n\nROLLING STONES Dandelion, She's a Rainbow - these two \"take turns\" as my #1, though Dandelion has been ruling the roost for a few months now. I can't keep track of all the incredible deep trax I've heard on Sirius.\n\nSTAN ROGERS I don't know the one you list, but I'm partial to Northwest Passage.\n\nTHE WHO I Can't Explain, Run Run Run (thank you Sirius for the latter)\n\nGEORGE HARRISON All Those Years Ago (yours is Awaiting On You All - for me, instead, I LOVE the version by Silver Hawk!)\n\nDURAN DURAN Girls On Film. Definitely this! Was before any of their hits.\n\nDEEP PURPLE In lieu of Hush, it's Kentucky Woman that nails it for me. I like this remake more than the original which, yes, is probably my favorite Neil Diamond song! (Well, that or Desiree.)\n\nTHE GUESS WHO Star Baby is mine! And...Orly is #2. Albert Flasher is prob'ly my favorite of their actual hits.\n\nELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA...um WHAT, not on your list??? YOU'RE WRONG, LOL. Mine rotate almost like The Beatles: Evil Woman, Hold On Tight, I'm Alive, Strange Magic, Turn To Stone, Don't Bring Me Down. Decisions are impossible.\n\nMARTHA & THE MUFFINS Cheesies and Gum, About Insomnia. (Their debut single has my two favorite songs, yes!) I would have loved to see them live. Why didn't stuff like this get played to round out CanCon rules?\n\nf) Spending no time or thought at all, really, because the list would be intense, some random major favorites which cover a huge span of time. Most likely these would all fall somewhere in my all time Top 500 if I can ever get it together. Of course I'm not touching hits here in general (which, again, would be the majority of my list).\n\nPABLO VALENZUELA Agapito Ven, Ven (1910)\n\nNORA BAYES Over There (1917, World War I song)\n\nSTUFF SMITH AND HIS ONYX CLUB BOYS Here Comes The Man With the Jive (incredible horn, and violin, solos!)(1936)\n\nXAVIER CUGAT Farandole (1941)\n\nSPIKE JONES The Fuehrer's Face (1942) a WILD Daffy Duck 'toon of this exists!\n\nGLENN MILLER ORCHESTRA Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (1942)\n\nDICK HAYMES You'll Never Know (1943)\n\nFATS DOMINO The Fat Man (1949)\n\nJACKIE BRENSTON Rocket 88 (1951)\n\nPERRY COMO Don't Let The Stars Get In Your Eyes (1952)\n\nJO STAFFORD Shrimp Boats (1952)\n\nAMES BROTHERS The Naughty Lady of Shady Lane (1954) perhaps the most-clever song, with its amazing punch line, EVER WRITTEN???\n\n(From here I'll skip the 50s through 80s...but one MUST be included!)\n\nCAEDMON Sea Song (1978) In my TOP TEN. First heard it 28 months ago. It\n\nSLAMMED into my personal all-time Top Ten IMMEDIATELY, to a degree that\n\nhappens less than once per generation. \"Summer In the City\" may be the\n\nonly other that's ever hit quite THAT hard. Circumstances contributed.\n\nPIZZICATO FIVE Twiggy Twiggy (sung in Japanese)(1994)\n\nLUNCHMONEY LEWIS Bills (2015) - for me, this and Australia are forever united.\n\nIt did almost nothing here, but was #1 when I was visiting there. My\n\nfavorite song of this Century so far.\n\nPRIMA DONNA Automatic (2018)\n\nLITTLE MIX Strip (2018) - but I don't know why. NO WAY should I like this\n\nsong!! Their type of voice affectation is usually fingernails on the blackboard for me.\n\nJVKE The Golden Hour (2022)\n\nFAVORITE CANADIAN SONGS: LOVERBOY Hot Girls In Love; FLUDD Cousin Mary.\n\nThese are solid Top 100 for me. I don't remember hearing Fludd in 70s.\n\nTOP TEN LPs not in order: The Beatles Abbey Road, Sparks (Propaganda, Kimono My House, Indiscreet), Eno (Here Come The Warm Jets which was my \"GATEWAY DRUG\" into all kinds of avant-garde, prog, etc. stuff I didn't list above), PINK FLOYD Saucerful of Secrets, Piper At the Gates of Dawn), TANGERINE DREAM Phaedra, MOODY BLUES Days of Future Passed, VELVET UNDERGROUND White Light - White Heat. I can say safely that ENO, and Saucerful, are respectively my #1, #2 albums of all time - though Interstellar Overdrive is my fave Floyd cut. Eno yanked me into virtually all of this (with Can, Nurse With Wound, Throbbing Gristle, Wire, Dead Kennedys, Sex Pistols, Amon Duul II, Gong, etc. waiting in the wings or coming later) in 1974, a majorly transitional year for me musically. Europe rules! This 76-year-old guy definitely has a wild side - and I still ride roller coasters, lol.\n\nMARK! (Capital letters and an exclamation mark are, again, justified.) Your response was incredibly interesting and detailed, with a lot about Boston radio that of course I wasn't aware of; only a \"local\" would, because a good amount of it was of \"You had to be there\" caliber. You mention Dick Summer and his interesting music selection, etc. I-tells-ya, I LIVED FOR HIS SHOW! Remember Theopoulos Q. Waterhouse? He used to play this very cool horror thing from the radio-show era, which I eventually found out was called \"The Dark\" by Arch Oboler. Do you remember that? It's still one of my favorite \"short horror things\" of all time.\n\nStill, in all that detail, some things I remember (or know about) managed to avoid mention. In my collection of radio station charts, I have an incredibly rare one from WTAO/740, which is a rock and roll chart from 1957. Apparently the charts were available only at some specific movie theater. Do you know anything about their rock and roll programming: how many months or years it was around, and whether it was only at specific times (i. e. block programming)?\n\nI wasn't aware of WBZ's dayparting back in those days, because I was never near Boston at all during the daytime, not even once. (Closest would have been the Capital District of NY on a 1957 family trip, and similarly close on a 1966 trip that included NYC-to-Montreal to attend the radio club convention.) It wasn't just WEBZ that dayparted: WLS very much did that as well in the 60s. They were almost AC during the day (\"for the housewives\"??), and almost MOR after midnight!\n\nYou mentioned WROL, but you didn't mention anything about their ancestor WORL. I remember Monday mornings when they were one of the first stations to sign on, onto a 950 that was otherwise devoid of any North American signals. I think WPET Greensboro NC signed on first but they were a lot weaker. I always heard WORL playing top 40/rock and roll while they were audible. Did they do anything at all in the local ratings? Even more pertinent to my own purposes, do you know if they ever had a music chart (survey)? I absolutely would love to get one of those. I know at some point (October 1956, at least) they, and other local stations WHDH etc., showed up in a weekly Friday column of local radio Top Tens in the Boston American and Boston Record. What, if anything, do you know about these columns?\n\nYou also mentioned some FM stations that dared (or didn't try at all, such as WRKO-FM) to do something different. I would assume many of the innovations (such as WBCN) were already being done on some of the small college FM stations? One I was surprised not to see mentioned is WATD/95.9 in Mansfield, on the way to Cape Cod. From what I heard out of them, especially in the 1990s (mostly via E-Skip in western Illinois, but also from rare visits), was pretty good announcing and heavy localization, and a rather eclectic mix of cool oldies. I enjoyed listening to them, and I KNOW that their presence \"cost me\" some potential new catches!\n\nThough I won't go into it much, I never did talk much about the numerous examples of foreign music I've come to love. Actually, I only know/knew the names and artists of a TINY fraction of those, and the names of NONE of the cool stuff that \"went by\" when I was tuned to radio from Jammu (Kashmir), Tunis, Yaounde, Tabriz, etc. Probably my favorite that I can actually name, is \"E Dua Na Siga\" by Kaiviti Kid - FIJI music at its best, and they were clearly having a blast playing it live in what looks like a hotel.\n\nThose who have a desire to explore FOREIGN RADIO STATIONS should try RadioGarden. I can't remember the suffix for sure (.com, .org?), but there's a lot of fun stuff up there.\n\nI don't have a WRTH, but I'd enjoy finding the 540 from Indonesia if it's up there; I heard what I PRESUMED was them when I was in Perth and Bunbury in 2015. I don't remember the city, and it seems unsearchable...\n\nDick Summer's wee hours show on WBZ was indeed a treat. I and many of my classmates had it on when slugging through typing term papers at \"zero dark thirty\" in the morning.\n\nTheophilus Q. Waterhouse was one of his schticks. There was also the \"Shrewsbury versus Sandwich\" debate. Dick claimed that the Duke of Shrewsbury rather than the Earl of Sandwich was the first one to put some meat between two slices of bread; therefore, what has become known as a sandwich should be called a shrewsbury instead. I think late in '63 or early in '64 he interviewed students in a Harvard dorm about this \"burning issue of great importance.\" Heck, we had just gone through a church being blown up in Birmingham and a president being shot in Dallas. Cuba was a mess and so was Berlin. Vietnam loomed. For a few minutes, I guess, Dick felt that we should be allowed some silliness. Dick Summer did have a serious side. A woman was stabbed outside an apartment complex near New York City and people stood around and just let it happen. Dick was infuriated over this and started a group \"Nightlighters Against Gutlessness\" (NAG).\n\nHe used to like to read the poem \"The Highwayman.\"\n\nDick Summer continued his career at several stations including WMEX Boston and then a couple back in his native New York City. Last I heard he's still around, living outside Philadelphia and producing podcasts. I know that flying his private plane is (or was?) one of his great interests.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.dicksummer.com/\n\nhttps://www.mmone.org/dick-summer/\n\nhttps://www.massbroadcastershof.org/hall-of-fame/hall-of-fame-2015/dick-summer/\n\nI did not have my own radio until 1959 and it wasn't until 1960 that I really got serious about both entertainment listening and DXing. Anything I recall prior to that was from incidental exposure: radios playing in stores, restaurants, barber shops, passing cars, etc. My folks had that \"newfangled\" TV on more than the radio and they read books and newspapers a lot. The one car in the family was not radio equipped until 1965.\n\nThrough incidental exposure to music on radio and sometimes TV, I do remember some tunes that must have been \"ginormous\" as they seemed to be audible on every street corner.\n\n\"Let Me Go Lover\" (Joan Weber) - 1954\n\n\"Poor People of Paris\" (Les Baxter) - 1956\n\n\"Wayward Wind\" (Gogi Grant) - 1956\n\n\"Davy Crockett\" (not sure whose version) - 1955\n\n\"Open Up Your Heart and Let the Sun Shine In\" (Cowboy Church Sunday School) - 1955\n\n\"Sixteen Tons\" (Tennessee Ernie Ford) - 1955\n\n\"Hound Dog\" (Elvis Presley) - 1956\n\n\"Whispering Bells\" (Dell Vikings) - 1957 - WINS NYC on Cape Cod vacation\n\nI guess you had to be hiding under a rock to miss those. Need to remember I was only 5 when the Joan Weber song was flying high.\n\nLeroy Anderson's collaborations with the Boston Pops Orchestra played in all the clothing stores from Boston and Cambridge to Belmont and Arlington. It was \"Serenata\" one minute, \"Blue Tango\" the next. Those records must have made a pile of money in the '50s.\n\nWhen I got into control of my own listening (~late '59) I don't remember 740 WTAO or 950 WORL being serious contenders in rock 'n' roll. I'd peg them as more middle-of-the-road like WHDH. I do remember someone on a bus with a portable radio playing WTAO when Laurie London's \"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands\" was a hit. My Billboard book says early 1958 for that. Not sure that song would qualify as rock 'n' roll. I ran across WORL playing Jimmie Rodgers' \"Four Little Girls in Boston\" - 1960 I think. Heard on a Cape vacation with a stupendously strong signal for 5 kW. The salt-marsh transmitting site in Saugus did the job.\n\nTowards the mid '60s WORL did have a Top 40 DJ Ken Carter. The station did not have that format through the entire day. I think even then, blocks were set aside for talk shows, religion, and ethnic content. The Ken Carter show didn't last long.\n\nBoth WTAO and WORL were daytime-only operations. Missing metro-Boston afternoon drive from November through February was not a good thing. The only significant Black station, WILD 1090, was in the same boat.\n\nWBZ did indeed play lighter music on morning shows and into the early afternoon. Carl DeSuze, Dave Maynard, and Jay Dunn had less \"kicked up\" Yardbirds, Rolling Stones etc. than later in the day jocks Jefferson Kaye, Bruce Bradley, and Dick Summer. Guess there was this \"housewives don't like rock\" philosophy going around. Throw them Englebert Humperdinck and Bobby Goldsboro. Turn on the rock guns when the teen kids get out of school.\n\nRegarding WBCN, there were some progressive music blocks on college stations from about 1967 on. The \"Uncle T\" show on MIT's WTBS (88.1) was blues-rock heavy. He loved a lot of the new \"far out\" stuff but also wanted kids to know about the roots: great R&B from the early '50s that was hardly noticed in white suburbia (or known only by wimpy McGuire Sisters or Pat Boone covers). Harvard's WHRB (95.3) also dabbled in album rock. Commercial station WHDH-FM (94.5) experimented a bit. As noted before, Jefferson Kaye on WBZ got the folk side of things rolling before his departure to Buffalo in 1966. Dick Summer's Nightlight show got a bit progressive by 1967. But it all amounted to a little here and a little there until WBCN stepped up to the plate.\n\nWATD (95.9) is Marshfield, not Mansfield. And, yes, right off Route 3 en route from Boston to the Cape. On some of my rides I'd sample an oldies show on Saturday night. This would have been in the '90s. Two guys, one named Ed I think. I called in from the car and got them to play Helen Shapiro.\n\nForeign music? Going back to 1963, there was a great Greek program named something like the \"Kamelakis Hour\" which aired on 1600 WBOS. They played some very good (and lively) music. If you're familiar with the Cat Stevens song \"Rubylove\", that will give you the idea. DXing medium wave and shortwave has exposed me to the music of many nations. Afro-pop became big with mainstream artists Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, Steve Winwood, and Sting. I can understand why: the stuff is great. Once in a while it even goes Top 40 as in 1967 when Miriam Makeba scored with \"Pata Pata\" and in 1968 with Hugh Masekela's \"Grazing in the Grass.\" \"Soul Makossa\" was another biggie. The early '70s movie \"The Harder They Come\" really got me going on reggae though I was aware of Jamaica's blue beat / ska scene as far back as 1964 with \"My Boy Lollipop\" (Millie Small) and \"Jamaica Ska\" (Ska Kings). Of course we had Harry Belafonte way before that. Music from various Hispanic areas has always been blending into the fabric of America's music. Ray Barretto's \"El Watusi\" in the spring of 1963 was a massive hit, especially on New York City radio. Paul Simon echoed Andean folk music with his \"El Condor Pasa\" enough to whet the appetite for the authentic item. When delivered by a scratchy tropical band signal of a low-power back of the barn Peruvian, all the more exotic.\n\nNot quite as \"foreign\" is Celtic and other British Isles / western Europe traditional music and their New World extensions, particularly in Atlantic Canada (but also Louisiana, the Appalachians, Tidewater VA, New England). It's my heritage so I take deep dives into that.\n\nThe late John Bryant went into great detail of how his DX interests meshed with his enjoyment of Indonesian and other Pacific zone music. It's in the Proceedings books and well worth a read. With radio means to hear it not quite as it used to be, Googling web streams, Radio Garden, and YouTube are the more feasible \"World Music\" exploratory tools today.\n\nTo answer a previous question posed by Frank, the Tommy Manno song \"That's For Me To Know (and for you to find out)\" was a big hit in Boston around May-June 1962 even though it didn't seem to do much anywhere else.\n\nMark Connelly, WA1ION | South Yarmouth, MA, USA | FN41vq\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nIn a message dated 8/23/2023 10:27:06 PM Eastern Daylight Time, fmerrilljr@... writes:\n\nMARK!

LW NW/SE\n\nWow, I totally forgot about NAG (Nightlighters Against Gutlessness) but I remember it now. Likewise with The Highwayman, which yes he sometimes read. But, yeah, \"Down with sandwiches, up with Shrewsburys!\" (spoken by a small group of people) was the rallying cry, and that fun controversy was probably his most-prominent schtick. And there's definite truth behind it...\n\nI also barely remember a faux \"Instant Swamp\" kit...and, sometimes he'd be talking about something, leading directly into a song/record like what Dickie Goodman might have done if he had a radio show, except he would do that with only ONE song at a time, not a series of them like, for example, Dickie Goodman's later \"Mr. Jaws\". Ahh, indeed, memories. I have almost no doubt that WBZ was responsible for me having, decades later, one of the world's largest collections of Dickie-Goodman-styled 45s! I no longer collect them, but from about 1970 on into the late 00s, I went after them in a take-no-prisoners sort of way.\n\nI don't remember when we had our first car with a radio in it, but I know that was true BY August 1957. We took a family trip from near Ann Arbor, across the entire south peninsula part of Ontario to New York City, and on to Washington DC where a cousin was in \"reform school\". There must have been some security and such there, but I don't remember it, and we all picnicked outdoors. But earlier in the trip, I remember we had WBUD Trenton on, in the car, playing Bye Bye Love.\n\nI remember all those songs from \"the days\" that you mentioned, Marc - Cowboy Church was actually 1954 and I somehow (don't ask, I have NO idea) equate that song with having gone to the movie theater to see \"Them!\" probably the same day, and I also remember trying Coca-Cola that day and HATING it. Those three things shouldn't correlate, but the human brain works in strange ways, dun'nit? That is also the farthest back I can remember being in a movie theater, though I have no idea if there was anything earlier.\n\nI have the vaguest of all possible memories of \"Chinese Mule Train\" by Spike Jones, though I don't remember the Frankie Laine hit which is wonderful. (Certainly \"CMT\" wouldn't have been played into 1951 as what would decades later become known as a recurrent, would it?) I was only two-and-a-half years old in winter 1950, though I remember a number of songs in later 1950 and in 1951. I remember a LOT from 1952, including hearing and liking BOTH big versions of \"Jambalaya\" etc. I have a memory of the family around a Christmas tree singing \"Dear Hearts and Gentle People\". Is that memory from 1949? PROBABLY! I'll never know for sure. (The song's popularity peaked around Christmas 1949, and I otherwise have no memory of the song itself.) Therefore I can't ever know if I indeed have any memory at all about the 1940s...and my medical records of when I was circumcised are also long lost, which MAY have predated 1950. I just remember an incident of feeling pain while playing in the back yard, and my mother explaining something I couldn't understand yet, because more than likely I probably never noticed earlier what was no longer there.\n\nI just checked my WTAO-740 survey closer, and it's dated November 22, 1957 and it is full-out rock and roll (i. e. Jailhouse Rock, etc.). I always wonder what a station like that sounded like, but it's almost impossible for any airchecks to exist. I also assume this programming was extremely short-lived, because with the poor cold-season daylight hours you mention, how could they have POSSIBLY competed with WBZ and WCOP? It also says something like \"distributed exclusively through your favorite ATC Theatres\" so my memory was fairly accurate on that, but not having that promotional item at hit-music-inclined places (i. e. record stores and such) had to hurt their publicity, too. Surveys were a VERY cheap and effective way to publicize a rock and roll radio station.\n\nAs far as the \"housewives don't like rock\" mention about WBZ, you probably remember when radio stations (usually in the daytime) would occasionally play a \"ladies' choice\" which was invariably a more-MOR hit. What an oddball stereotype because, as I remember during that time period (and back into the 1950s) it was often the GIRLS who bought Top 40 records!\n\nThinking of your mention of the white suburbs growing up on \"wimpy McGuire Sisters or Pat Boone covers\"...like, um, would you believe \"Tutti Frutti\" by Pat Boone?\n\nKILL ME.\n\nPLEASE.\n\nNOW.\n\nYour short treatise on foreign music - YES, entirely true! The strange part is just how \"random\" these hits were, like \"Nel Blu Dipinto di Blu\" by Domenico Modugno and \"Sukiyaki\" by Kyu Sakamoto were HUGE, as well as Millie Small, Hugh Masekela, \"El Watusi\" etc. but none of these kicked off any tsunami that exposed USAns to more music of those types. In 1966, I VERY MUCH loved JOE CUBA SEXTET \"Bang Bang\" - a wonderful slice of Puerto Rico coming out of that \"box\" on the table or the radio in my pocket. I responded greatly to \"Jamaica Ska\" too - and the nonhit \"Patsy Girl\" by ROSS McMANNUS which CKLW was playing, both concurrent with Millie Small. Tom Clay on CKLW, in the evenings, was the greatest! (Of course, the brother of Cassius Clay. NOT. lol) He exposed me to incredible British stuff at the time, as I mentioned here before, and I think he may have even beaten Jamaica to be the first person in the Americas to play \"My Boy Lollipop\". I even remember that, because I had taped it off the radio - \"Millie, from London, England\". Of course that's all he knew, and that it was catchy as all get-out. I found out years later that indeed the first British pressings of the record merely credit her as MILLIE.\n\nWhen I lived in Ohio, another station that I'M SURE \"cost me\" some loggings (because I'd be \"frozen\" listening to it), was when 94.9 Sydney NS would skip in. That Acadian stuff was so much fun.\n\nAnd, though not foreign, some of Les Baxter's music was foreign \"by nature\" if not downright other-worldly, definitely exotic. \"Quiet Village\" comes to mind immediately. Instruments like the gamelon, etc. were not unknown to him. His much-earlier \"April In Portugal\" (from 1953, another one I recall very well) gave a little hint of what would come at the end of the decade.\n\nI meant to address more about Theopuolos Q. Waterhouse on Dick Summer's WBZ Nightlight show. I remember a couple \"mascots\" on Detroit radio. WKNR/1310 [Dearborn/suburb] had a \"Rodney The Rodent\" around 1966-67, but I don't remember which personality there had that. The aforementioned Tom Clay (on CKLW, which wasn't officially a Detroit station either, and it was even in a different COUNTRY, lol) had a \"Soapy\" around 1964, which was obviously meant to be some kind of dog.\n\nI can't remember others offhand, but I can't imagine there weren't.\n\nAlso pertaining to Dick Summer's Nightlight Show on WBZ, I can STILL recite the entire Nightlight Password with the greatest of ease (other than knowing how to spell the guy's name in the \"six...\" part). It's close to sixty years since I've heard it uttered on the radio. \"One hen...\" - anybody else still do this?\n\nTalk about utterly useless, lol.\n\nThe \"One hen, two ducks\" etc. thing - see:\n\nApparently a long-running diction practice exercise for would-be announcers.\n\nA regular feature on Dick Summer's show.\n\nHere's an actual October 1965 recording of a Dick Summer show on WBZ:\n\nhttps://app.box.com/s/5idnzvxo93r3w56vmzxo2abefwm51uf2\n\nIt was made on a US Navy ship docked at Midway Island in the Pacific Ocean. Reel-to-reel copy provided by Roger Perkins K1CZH/W1OJ (now deceased). He was using an R-390A receiver.\n\nSpanish way in the background towards the end is likely XEQR Mexico City.\n\nMark Connelly, WA1ION | South Yarmouth, MA, USA | FN41vq\n\nIn a message dated 8/25/2023 8:56:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time, fmerrilljr@... writes:\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nAlso pertaining to Dick Summer's Nightlight Show on WBZ, I can STILL recite the entire Nightlight Password with the greatest of ease (other than knowing how to spell the guy's name in the \"six...\" part).

I think he stepped it up some around Halloween with lead-ins that started with spooky story lines that were something like a boy and a girl parked on a Lover's Lane in the moonlight when all of a sudden \"it\" came up out of the swamp (chains rattling noise). \"It\" pushed the boy out of the car, then it said to to the girl ..\" >>> \"Do You Love Me\" by the Contours starts. That kind of thing.\n\nDo you remember Mad Daddy on WINS NYC circa 1963-1964? He used a rhyming kind of delivery not unlike the utterances of (then) Cassius Clay. A bit like then-popular talk records by Lord Buckley and Ken Nordine. This was about 8 years before \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\" (Gil Scott Heron) kicked open the door to what would become Rap / Hip Hop.\n\nAnother air personality of note was Joey Reynolds on WKBW (1520) Buffalo. His show was high on the energy and zaniness scales. Easily heard in the western suburbs of Boston and often splashing over on WMEX.\n\nIn late '62 / early '63, he and other 'KB' DJ Danny Neaverth concocted a ditty called \"Rats in My Room.\"\n\nGood sax blasting if nothing else.\n\nIf you can scan that WTAO survey to a decent resolution JPG or PDF, please do so. Attach it to a group post. I think a lot of us would like to see that.\n\n\"Tammy\" (Debbie Reynolds, 1957) is another ancient era song that seemed to be coming out of speakers everywhere. A zillion seller apparently.\n\nFrank, your last several emails have certainly given me a good list of tunes to check out on YouTube (if available). In some cases I may recognize it upon playing even if the title/artist didn't initially ring a bell. A lot of '50s and earlier music had become familiar to me early on as WMEX and WINS had regular oldies shows and WNEW NY (1130) was a frequent stop for old jazz / Big Band swing, crooners, Broadway, Hollywood, Rat Pack etc.\n\nWorld Music - Afro-pop - remember \"Tom Hark\" by Elias and his Zig Zag Jive Flutes (1958)?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR9v485xrnU\n\nMinor hit I guess.\n\nBuffed up sort-of by Bert Kaempfert in '62 as \"Swinging Safari\":\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6bsoyT86LE\n\nBert did a deep wallow into Muzak versions of Afro-pop on numerous tunes. The Tokens' smash \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" (late 1961) also delivered a hint of African music to teens/pre-teens listening to transistor radios under the covers when Mom and Dad thought they were asleep/\n\nJamaican-influenced - \"Just Keep it Up\" by Dee Clark (1959). Contemporary with Belafonte and well before Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yce0Ug5ElWw\n\nWe also had \"Caribbean\" by Mitchell Torok which blended islands music and country as Jimmy Buffett would do later with his \"Gulf and Western\" style.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bnwgyOpL9c\n\nExotica / \"Tiki Lounge\" - Martin Denny had the biggest hit version of \"Quiet Village\" if I recall correctly:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMoyLxply0c\n\nIf anything \"World Music\" may have interacted with the Top 40 more in the '50s than it does now.\n\nMark Connelly, WA1ION | South Yarmouth, MA, USA | FN41vq\n\nIn a message dated 8/24/2023 7:26:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time, fmerrilljr@... writes:\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nWow, I totally forgot about NAG (Nightlighters Against Gutlessness) but I remember it now. Likewise with The Highwayman, which yes he sometimes read. But, yeah, \"Down with sandwiches, up with Shrewsburys!\" (spoken by a small group of people) was the rallying cry, and that fun controversy was probably his most-prominent schtick. And there's definite truth behind it...\n\nI also barely remember a faux \"Instant Swamp\" kit...and, sometimes he'd be talking about something, leading directly into a song/record like what Dickie Goodman might have done if he had a radio show, except he would do that with only ONE song at a time, not a series of them like, for example, Dickie Goodman's later \"Mr. Jaws\". Ahh, indeed, memories. I have almost no doubt that WBZ was responsible for me having, decades later, one of the world's largest collections of Dickie-Goodman-styled 45s! I no longer collect them, but from about 1970 on into the late 00s, I went after them in a take-no-prisoners sort of way.\n\nI don't remember when we had our first car with a radio in it, but I know that was true BY August 1957. We took a family trip from near Ann Arbor, across the entire south peninsula part of Ontario to New York City, and on to Washington DC where a cousin was in \"reform school\". There must have been some security and such there, but I don't remember it, and we all picnicked outdoors. But earlier in the trip, I remember we had WBUD Trenton on, in the car, playing Bye Bye Love.\n\nI remember all those songs from \"the days\" that you mentioned, Marc - Cowboy Church was actually 1954 and I somehow (don't ask, I have NO idea) equate that song with having gone to the movie theater to see \"Them!\" probably the same day, and I also remember trying Coca-Cola that day and HATING it. Those three things shouldn't correlate, but the human brain works in strange ways, dun'nit? That is also the farthest back I can remember being in a movie theater, though I have no idea if there was anything earlier.\n\nI have the vaguest of all possible memories of \"Chinese Mule Train\" by Spike Jones, though I don't remember the Frankie Laine hit which is wonderful. (Certainly \"CMT\" wouldn't have been played into 1951 as what would decades later become known as a recurrent, would it?) I was only two-and-a-half years old in winter 1950, though I remember a number of songs in later 1950 and in 1951. I remember a LOT from 1952, including hearing and liking BOTH big versions of \"Jambalaya\" etc. I have a memory of the family around a Christmas tree singing \"Dear Hearts and Gentle People\". Is that memory from 1949? PROBABLY! I'll never know for sure. (The song's popularity peaked around Christmas 1949, and I otherwise have no memory of the song itself.) Therefore I can't ever know if I indeed have any memory at all about the 1940s...and my medical records of when I was circumcised are also long lost, which MAY have predated 1950. I just remember an incident of feeling pain while playing in the back yard, and my mother explaining something I couldn't understand yet, because more than likely I probably never noticed earlier what was no longer there.\n\nI just checked my WTAO-740 survey closer, and it's dated November 22, 1957 and it is full-out rock and roll (i. e. Jailhouse Rock, etc.). I always wonder what a station like that sounded like, but it's almost impossible for any airchecks to exist. I also assume this programming was extremely short-lived, because with the poor cold-season daylight hours you mention, how could they have POSSIBLY competed with WBZ and WCOP? It also says something like \"distributed exclusively through your favorite ATC Theatres\" so my memory was fairly accurate on that, but not having that promotional item at hit-music-inclined places (i. e. record stores and such) had to hurt their publicity, too. Surveys were a VERY cheap and effective way to publicize a rock and roll radio station.\n\nAs far as the \"housewives don't like rock\" mention about WBZ, you probably remember when radio stations (usually in the daytime) would occasionally play a \"ladies' choice\" which was invariably a more-MOR hit. What an oddball stereotype because, as I remember during that time period (and back into the 1950s) it was often the GIRLS who bought Top 40 records!\n\nThinking of your mention of the white suburbs growing up on \"wimpy McGuire Sisters or Pat Boone covers\"...like, um, would you believe \"Tutti Frutti\" by Pat Boone?\n\nKILL ME.\n\nPLEASE.\n\nNOW.\n\nYour short treatise on foreign music - YES, entirely true! The strange part is just how \"random\" these hits were, like \"Nel Blu Dipinto di Blu\" by Domenico Modugno and \"Sukiyaki\" by Kyu Sakamoto were HUGE, as well as Millie Small, Hugh Masekela, \"El Watusi\" etc. but none of these kicked off any tsunami that exposed USAns to more music of those types. In 1966, I VERY MUCH loved JOE CUBA SEXTET \"Bang Bang\" - a wonderful slice of Puerto Rico coming out of that \"box\" on the table or the radio in my pocket. I responded greatly to \"Jamaica Ska\" too - and the nonhit \"Patsy Girl\" by ROSS McMANNUS which CKLW was playing, both concurrent with Millie Small. Tom Clay on CKLW, in the evenings, was the greatest! (Of course, the brother of Cassius Clay. NOT. lol) He exposed me to incredible British stuff at the time, as I mentioned here before, and I think he may have even beaten Jamaica to be the first person in the Americas to play \"My Boy Lollipop\". I even remember that, because I had taped it off the radio - \"Millie, from London, England\". Of course that's all he knew, and that it was catchy as all get-out. I found out years later that indeed the first British pressings of the record merely credit her as MILLIE.\n\nWhen I lived in Ohio, another station that I'M SURE \"cost me\" some loggings (because I'd be \"frozen\" listening to it), was when 94.9 Sydney NS would skip in. That Acadian stuff was so much fun.\n\nAnd, though not foreign, some of Les Baxter's music was foreign \"by nature\" if not downright other-worldly, definitely exotic. \"Quiet Village\" comes to mind immediately. Instruments like the gamelon, etc. were not unknown to him. His much-earlier \"April In Portugal\" (from 1953, another one I recall very well) gave a little hint of what would come at the end of the decade.\n\nMark -\n\nAwesome signal of WBZ from Midway Island! I've heard most of your recordings but first time for that one. I remember listening to Dick Summer but do not recall him playing Top 40 music. I remember him talking about his Venus Flytrap.

Dick Summer's music format was largely from the WBZ weekly Top 30 chart (sample attached).\n\nTowards 1967 he got more adventurous with the inclusion of deeper progressive rock album cuts. At some point along the line \"Dick Summer's Subway\" became a show title, either in addition to or instead of the \"Nightlight\" designation.\n\nThe Venus Flytrap (Irving was its name I think) was another of Dick's many weird gags.\n\nHere are two more \"WBZ at a distance\" recordings:\n\nWBZ heard from Australia 29 FEB 1996\n\nhttps://app.box.com/s/kydfvk9b18pj1h562f5bq8psc7jv423n\n\nWBZ heard in Iceland at TF4M - 5 MAY 2018 at 0447 UTC\n\nhttps://app.box.com/s/94x7jc74zvzgqswgqw1nc53c9ozfhph5\n\nWith the Australia, Midway, and Iceland receptions, \"I Get Around\" (Beach Boys) would be an appropriate WBZ theme song. Two 500 ft. sticks excited by 50 kW in a Hull, MA salt-marsh definitely crank out the RF.\n\nLifted from the \"remembering WBZ\" Facebook group.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1005052386250309\n\nPhilip Karp\n\nAugust 24 at 10:47 PM ·\n\nThe facility that Westinghouse dedicated in Hull on July 8, 1940 was intentionally modest in design. In a time when many transmitter buildings were Art Deco showplaces, the Hull facility was built to resemble the other Cape Cod-style homes on the residential street it faces.\n\nTo the north of the transmitter building, two 500-foot towers were erected, each a half-wave tall on the station's frequency of 990 kHz, and spaced a quarter-wave apart. (The March 1941 shift to 1030 would make the towers, and their spacing, slightly more than half-wave and quarter-wave, respectively.) To the west, a field of telephone poles stretched into the marsh, carrying the antennas for Westinghouse's shortwave operations. (The shortwave station associated with WBZ, first at Springfield and then at Millis, had used the calls W1XK, then WBOS; with the completion of the Hull facility, Westinghouse moved its Pittsburgh shortwave transmitters, then operating as WPIT, to Hull as well. The WPIT calls were retired early in 1941 and the facility was then known solely as WBOS for its remaining years.)\n\nHull apparently also became the home, for a time, of WBZ's FM operation, which also moved from Millis. The antenna for W67B (46.7 mc) would have most likely been mounted on one of the AM towers; it's hard to imagine that coverage into Boston from such a distance would have been very good, and the FM was quickly relocated to the new TV tower at Soldiers Field Road as that facility was completed in 1948.\n\nAfter almost twenty years of nonstop motion, WBZ had found a permanent home for its huge AM signal, and a most successful one at that. With nothing but salt water between the bases of its towers and the shoreline of Boston, the Hull site provided - and continues to provide - a booming signal to the city itself. With no nulls to the south and west, unlike Boston's other AM stations, WBZ blanketed the rural areas that would someday become booming suburbs, and which other AMs would struggle to reach successfully. The coastal site gave WBZ a huge reach along the water, pumping a strong daytime signal north into Maine and south into Rhode Island. Its clear channel and tall towers gave WBZ's night skywave signal a spectacular reach, with a particularly strong signal into New York City after dark. Only the outer reaches of Cape Cod, on the back side of WBZ's directional pattern, suffered from a less-than-optimal signal - and in 1940, who knew that would be important?\n\nMark Connelly, WA1ION | South Yarmouth, MA, USA | FN41vq\n\nIn a message dated 8/26/2023 11:47:59 AM Eastern Daylight Time, midcapemarc@... writes:\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nMark -\n\nAwesome signal of WBZ from Midway Island!

I've been glued there for about three hours now, and I've heard NOTHING that I didn't like. One, GRAND KALLE & AFRICAN JAZZ \"Rumba On the River\" is worthy of my all-time Top 300. That place had incredibly cool music in the Fifties.\n\nIf I want, I can jump to 1910's Cuba, or 1990's Afghanistan, 1960's Peru, 1930's Indonesia...the imagination boggles...what was music like in Jamaica in the 1930s?\n\nI'm going to be using this website A LOT, I think..."
